1978.77-1378,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,12.273,"We will hear arguments first this morning and first this year, in Japan Line Limited against County of Los Angeles."
1978.77-1378,0,37674,peter_l_briger,,15.699,18.968,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1978.77-1378,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,103.051,108.032,"Are you arguing both the home port doctrine and the Customs Convention, Mr. Briger?"
1978.77-1378,0,37674,peter_l_briger,,108.032,110.168,Yes I'm.
1978.77-1378,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,110.168,114.231,I thought perhaps that you intended to blend them together in that last sentence?
1978.77-1378,0,37674,peter_l_briger,,114.231,115.626,I do indeed.
1978.77-1378,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,146.762,150.749,"But the home port doctrine is constitutionally based, is it not?"
1978.77-1378,0,37674,peter_l_briger,,150.749,151.898,Yes it is.
1978.77-1378,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,151.898,163.826,"And your case would not be as strong, apart from the home port doctrine, without the affirmative adoption of the Customs Convention, would it?"
1978.77-1378,0,37674,peter_l_briger,,163.826,166.863,I think it probably would be.
1978.77-1378,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,204.639,208.645,So what is that they do if they are relying?
1978.77-1378,0,37674,peter_l_briger,,208.645,245.166,"Well, every country Your Honor and this comes out in the Solicitor General's brief, every country with the exception possibly of Afghanistan, in the treatment of the international carriage of goods and persons by aircraft, vessels or containers has followed a policy of reciprocal exemption from local or national taxes upon these instrumentalities and all governments of the world in their trading relations have observed this policy."
1978.77-1378,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,245.166,250.676,"But it's the executive and the legislative branches that speak for this country on foreign policy, isn't it?"
1978.77-1378,0,37674,peter_l_briger,,250.676,251.989,Indeed.
1978.77-1378,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,251.989,260.348,"And Hays Mail didn't -- the Pacific Mail case didn't depend on any action of the executive branch, did it or did it of the legislative branch?"
1978.77-1378,0,37674,peter_l_briger,,260.348,264.073,It did not but there are really two policies that coalesce.
1978.77-1378,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,284.986,288.286,"Hays wasn't an international case, was it?"
1978.77-1378,0,37674,peter_l_briger,,288.286,289.873,It dealt with ocean carriage and it dealt.
1978.77-1378,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,289.873,294.384,"Well, I know, but it is between two ports of the United States?"
1978.77-1378,0,37674,peter_l_briger,,294.384,295.214,Indeed.
1978.77-1378,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,295.214,300.525,And to and the problem was amongst states of the United States?
1978.77-1378,0,37674,peter_l_briger,,300.525,305.176,"Well, Justice White, while the case did deal with --"
1978.77-1378,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,305.176,309.954,It wasn't one that dealt with an international trade?
1978.77-1378,0,37674,peter_l_briger,,309.954,313.598,But we are dealing with international trade in this case I would --
1978.77-1378,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,313.598,318.539,"I know, but just give me another one under Hays or any other one that dealt with an international?"
1978.77-1378,0,37674,peter_l_briger,,318.539,320.034,The Court has never dealt with.
1978.77-1378,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,320.034,323.02,"Well, that's what I thought."
1978.77-1378,0,37674,peter_l_briger,,333.023,335.322,Those were the specific facts of the Hays case.
1978.77-1378,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,335.322,337.301,"Yes, yes."
1978.77-1378,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,337.301,345.604,Was the argument about the container convention presented to the California Courts?
1978.77-1378,0,37674,peter_l_briger,,345.604,347.758,"No I don't believe it was, Your Honor."
1978.77-1378,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,347.758,351.115,"Well if not, can we mainly consider here?"
1978.77-1378,0,37674,peter_l_briger,,351.115,427.827,"There were arguments that various treaties invalidated the imposition of the tax, specifically the Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, so that the argument was made that in general there were Treaty obligations of the United States which indicated its interest in this area of the international carriage of goods in connection with foreign-owned instrumentalities, but we would argue that the Commerce Clause by itself gives the federal government without the necessity of any specific legislation or Treaty, the exclusive interest because this is an area that impacts upon the foreign relations of the United States and there have been governments which for more than almost two hundred years have relied upon this exemption from taxation."
1978.77-1378,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,459.266,462.454,Do you think Hays was not the same today --
1978.77-1378,0,37674,peter_l_briger,,462.454,462.817,I believe.
1978.77-1378,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,462.817,469.67,-- on traffic between two states?
1978.77-1378,0,37674,peter_l_briger,,469.67,476.817,Not at all Justice White and that is because the apportionment rule is the law for all of the states.
1978.77-1378,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,476.817,486.942,You are saying that something like the Hays rule of the Court and everyone thought appropriate for a long time is still appropriate for international trade?
1978.77-1378,0,37674,peter_l_briger,,486.942,495.665,"Yes Your Honor where the apportionment rule cannot be enforced upon foreign governments either by state, local governments or by the federal government."
1978.77-1378,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,542.62,549.303,"You say that there will be a violation with the Commerce Clause, would you if the international practice had been just to the contrary?"
1978.77-1378,0,37674,peter_l_briger,,549.303,579.004,"No Your Honor, not at all and we would argue that if there had been an international practice whether by practice custom, treaty, multilateral agreement that would not then involve the foreign relations of the United States, but the point is that for 200 years this country has followed the practice of not imposing local property taxes upon foreign-owned containers."
1978.77-1378,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,579.004,583.103,But you say it wouldn't involve the foreign relations of the United States.
1978.77-1378,0,37674,peter_l_briger,,610.902,618.538,It would depend on how significantly Justice Rehnquist it interfered with the foreign relations of the country.
1978.77-1378,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,627.739,635.113,Would there be the same reciprocity factor that we have in international trade and in the hypothetical presented by Mr. Justice Rehnquist?
1978.77-1378,0,37674,peter_l_briger,,635.113,652.417,"Well, this was the point I was just going to make, Your Honor, that here we are dealing with a clear situation where in the letter of the State Department where they canvassed, more than a hundred embassies there seems to be a clearly established policy."
1978.77-1378,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,663.147,671.532,"But then the authority of a state to impose the tax depends on head count of what other countries think about it, is that right?"
1978.77-1378,0,37674,peter_l_briger,,671.532,673.918,"Not necessarily, Your Honor, but it may."
1978.77-1378,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,676.204,681.517,Can you conceive of a country that could say I think I should be taxed?
1978.77-1378,0,37674,peter_l_briger,,681.517,685.892,"I could, Justice Marshall that could be if the governments --"
1978.77-1378,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,685.892,689.437,And you may think that please tax me?
1978.77-1378,0,37674,peter_l_briger,,689.437,704.497,"Yes Your Honor, I could see that if the governments decided that apportionment made more sense and was more rational and they adopted rules through some type of multilateral treaty."
1978.77-1378,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,714.853,720.414,"Well then why not turning it all over to them, let them decided it all, what do you here for?"
1978.77-1378,0,37674,peter_l_briger,,720.414,724.722,It might will be a good idea and it's or -- but since there has been this --
1978.77-1378,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,724.722,728.897,You have to change the constitution a little bit and --
1978.77-1378,0,37674,peter_l_briger,,728.897,730.431,I don't think so at all.
1978.77-1378,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,747.853,751.091,But that's not the way you approached it?
1978.77-1378,0,37674,peter_l_briger,,751.091,752.18,No Your Honor that that --
1978.77-1378,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,752.18,753.773,"Well, is it?"
1978.77-1378,0,37674,peter_l_briger,,753.773,780.488,"We brought it here because there has been this clear custom and where there has been a custom and a reliance interest by foreign governments what we are suggesting is that the states even in their power to tax cannot change a fundamental principle which has been recognized by the international community of nations for more than 200 years, probably longer."
1978.77-1378,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,780.488,783.455,"Well, you are familiar with our Michelin Tire case, are you not?"
1978.77-1378,0,37674,peter_l_briger,,783.455,784.221,Yes I'm indeed.
1978.77-1378,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,784.221,792.101,What if the State Department had taken a census of foreign nations in that case and they have come out the same way that they objected to this form of taxation.
1978.77-1378,0,37674,peter_l_briger,,795.465,825.763,"Well, no I think Michelin is correct and I think that Michelin and the Court was very careful to indicating Michelin by the way that they would not tax under the Import-Export Clause or under the Commerce Clause property that was merely in transit and I believe the Court left that exception there because they were concerned with the burdens of multiple taxation in an area where apportionment was not recognized by our trading partners."
1978.77-1378,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,825.763,851.6,"Mr. Briger, your reference to this canvas of the 100 other embassies, I take it is not to suggest that we take a poll of what they think about it, but the implications of their answer and that those implications are that if you tax the components of our vessels, we are going to tax the components of your vessels, isn't that true?"
1978.77-1378,0,37674,peter_l_briger,,851.6,863.899,Indeed that's the sum and substance of it and also it's the perception of that Department of the United States government which is charged with foreign relations.
1978.77-1378,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,904.289,909.528,"But Mr. Briger, are you making either an Import-Export or Tonnage Clause argument?"
1978.77-1378,0,37674,peter_l_briger,,909.528,915.952,"Well, we made in our brief a Tonnage Clause argument and it's there."
1978.77-1378,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,920.352,928.024,"Because if the Tonnage Clause prohibited this, there will be nothing Congress could do about it, is that right?"
1978.77-1378,0,37674,peter_l_briger,,928.024,928.606,That's correct.
1978.77-1378,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,930.095,935.517,Are you suggesting none of the Tonnage Clause is a straw in the wind that --
1978.77-1378,0,37674,peter_l_briger,,935.517,949.83,It is a possible argument which if one looks at the impact of the tax and we find that the tax can apply only because of the repeated events of importation and exportation.
1978.77-1378,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,976.392,980.733,Mr. Briger may I get back to the question my brother Blackmun put to you before?
1978.77-1378,0,37674,peter_l_briger,,995.105,997.034,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1978.77-1378,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,997.034,1004.77,"Now it does support you though in the Customs Convention on containers argument, but you never raised that in California Courts?"
1978.77-1378,0,37674,peter_l_briger,,1004.77,1007.54,"No, that was not raised specifically in the California."
1978.77-1378,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1007.54,1013.73,"Well, I think my brother Blackmun asked you before, then how can you be heard on the customs conventional argument here?"
1978.77-1378,0,37674,peter_l_briger,,1013.73,1016.424,Because it is a law of the country and the fact that –
1978.77-1378,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1016.424,1017.556,The treaty?
1978.77-1378,0,37674,peter_l_briger,,1017.556,1020.656,The Treaty is a law of the country.
1978.77-1378,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1020.656,1023.481,"But it is a Treaty as I recall it, am I --"
1978.77-1378,0,37674,peter_l_briger,,1023.481,1024.137,"Yes, it is a treaty."
1978.77-1378,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1024.137,1032.319,"I mean, but it deals only with import duties and taxes, import prohibitions and that sort of thing, doesn't it?"
1978.77-1378,0,37674,peter_l_briger,,1032.319,1032.505,Yes.
1978.77-1378,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1032.505,1037.718,It doesn't deal with the type of tax we are dealing with here?
1978.77-1378,0,37674,peter_l_briger,,1037.718,1041.432,"Conceivably it does, I'm not – I am not --"
1978.77-1378,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1041.432,1043.022,Under what --
1978.77-1378,0,37674,peter_l_briger,,1043.022,1065.668,Well again under this concept that it talks about duties or taxes of any type whatsoever by reason of import and we believe that there is an argument that can be made that the tax applies only by virtue of the repeated import and export of the containers but we would -- we look to the Treaty and --
1978.77-1378,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1065.668,1072.241,"Well, if it is an inapplicable treaty, I take it that should end the case, shouldn't it, in your favor?"
1978.77-1378,0,37674,peter_l_briger,,1072.241,1073.399,Yes Justice Brennan.
1978.77-1378,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1073.399,1074.41,If it is inapplicable --
1978.77-1378,0,37674,peter_l_briger,,1074.41,1079.096,If it is inapplicable Treaty.
1978.77-1378,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1121.942,1132.85,It certainly would have been sensible if convention addressed itself to containers and to taxes?
1978.77-1378,0,37674,peter_l_briger,,1139.633,1140.705,"This is a great, this –"
1978.77-1378,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1140.705,1146.175,And then to reflect this international custom?
1978.77-1378,0,37674,peter_l_briger,,1146.175,1150.143,"Justice White, it is very difficult in dealing a codified world."
1978.77-1378,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1159.897,1171.878,"Well, they certainly considered import taxes because they use that expression in the convention, but was there any discussion at all in connection with the convention of the type of tax we are talking about?"
1978.77-1378,0,37674,peter_l_briger,,1171.878,1193.055,"Your Honor, the reason why I believe that there was not, was that the perception at the time the convention was entered into was that these were properly dealt with under the home port doctrine, that would be the our best analysis of the situation."
1978.77-1378,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1193.055,1195.281,"When was it negotiated, this convention?"
1978.77-1378,0,37674,peter_l_briger,,1195.281,1205.838,"Well, the container conventions began to be negotiated in the 1960s as containers began to be used at that time."
1978.77-1378,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1257.479,1270.576,"But you agree that the home port doctrine has heretofore never been applied by this Court to anything except domestic commerce, that has been applied to international commerce?"
1978.77-1378,0,37674,peter_l_briger,,1270.576,1271.596,Indeed.
1978.77-1378,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1271.596,1276.938,But well then – and do other countries have a similar home port doctrine to ours?
1978.77-1378,0,37674,peter_l_briger,,1276.938,1292.412,"Yes, for instance Japan not only that the trial court find that Japan applied a home port doctrine but we submitted to this Court a translation of the property tax law of Japan."
1978.77-1378,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1321.502,1333.083,Why would our negotiators be so confident that the home port doctrine would govern property taxes when this Court had never applied it to international trade?
1978.77-1378,0,37674,peter_l_briger,,1333.083,1335.992,It seemed to be the practice Your Honor and that --
1978.77-1378,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1335.992,1339.412,"When you say it seemed to be the practice, what do you mean by that?"
1978.77-1378,0,37674,peter_l_briger,,1339.412,1347.483,"That for more than 200 years, states have not levied personal property taxes on things such as airplanes."
1978.77-1378,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1403.533,1409.257,Are the containers here as handler containers were in Michelin?
1978.77-1378,0,37674,peter_l_briger,,1434.914,1439.913,"In Michelin, these containers are not containers with wheels."
1978.77-1378,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1445.901,1449.394,"And they once get to California, how do they get to the other states?"
1978.77-1378,0,37674,peter_l_briger,,1449.394,1452.7,"By rail or truck Your Honor, they carried flat bed --"
1978.77-1378,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1452.7,1454.948,"But not themselves, they are trailers?"
1978.77-1378,0,37674,peter_l_briger,,1454.948,1458.81,"No they are not themselves, they hold on trailers."
1978.77-1378,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1508.32,1517.485,"You say that Congress couldn't by legislation impose such a tax as this or authorize the states to impose such tax, is it?"
1978.77-1378,0,37674,peter_l_briger,,1517.485,1520.47,"I believe it, I believe it could."
1978.77-1378,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1520.47,1527.57,I thought a minute ago you said that not even the federal government could authorize the imposition of this tax?
1978.77-1378,0,37674,peter_l_briger,,1527.57,1537.937,"No it could not -- not the imposition of this tax, but it could not require foreign governments to accept apportionment as a means of the international taxation of these containers."
1978.77-1378,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1542.492,1564.822,You think the Secretary of the Treasury has any regulatory power pursuant to the convention on containers or pursuant to any other statute to affect this tax?
1978.77-1378,0,37674,peter_l_briger,,1574.722,1575.376,Yes.
1978.77-1378,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1575.376,1579.173,You think that he could reach this question?
1978.77-1378,0,37674,peter_l_briger,,1579.173,1586.985,"No, I believe that this question can be reached only by the Court."
1978.77-1378,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1586.985,1588.751,Can I ask you a question?
1978.77-1378,0,37674,peter_l_briger,,1595.138,1597.054,"Yes, Your Honor in."
1978.77-1378,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1597.054,1600.23,"They didn't have anything like it before, did they?"
1978.77-1378,0,37674,peter_l_briger,,1600.23,1602.089,No but in the 200.
1978.77-1378,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1602.089,1608.194,[Inaudible]
1978.77-1378,0,37674,peter_l_briger,,1608.194,1613.614,"No it has to be, it has to be hold by something or carried by something, but --"
1978.77-1378,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1613.614,1617.381,"How is that, that is not a vessel?"
1978.77-1378,0,37674,peter_l_briger,,1617.381,1619.268,There is a great deal of --
1978.77-1378,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1619.268,1623.48,"Yeah it is a vessel, like teapots of vessel --"
1978.77-1378,0,37674,peter_l_briger,,1623.48,1630.723,"Well, for want of a better term, Justice Marshall, it is referred to as an instrumentality."
1978.77-1378,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1630.723,1632.645,Like a box?
1978.77-1378,0,37674,peter_l_briger,,1632.645,1637.067,Like a box and I suppose an airplane or a vessel is something like a box.
1978.77-1378,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1637.067,1640.927,"An airplane moves on its own, this box doesn't?"
1978.77-1378,0,37674,peter_l_briger,,1640.927,1656.481,"No this box has to be hold, but we are analogizing it to vessels or to aircraft from the standpoint that it carries things in commerce and it may not have its own motive power."
1978.77-1378,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1656.481,1659.31,Wouldn't they go to a warehouse?
1978.77-1378,0,37674,peter_l_briger,,1659.31,1664.96,"The containers Your Honor, it's not my understanding that they are carried to a warehouse --"
1978.77-1378,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1664.96,1674.637,"[Voice Overlap] between a container sitting down on the ground and a warehouse, if you don't move the container?"
1978.77-1378,0,37674,peter_l_briger,,1674.637,1678.676,I think that's perhaps a different case because our containers are constantly in transit.
1978.77-1378,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1678.676,1683.208,"I agree they are different but there wouldn't be any difference in my case, would there?"
1978.77-1378,0,37674,peter_l_briger,,1683.208,1684.73,If the container would --
1978.77-1378,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1684.73,1698.396,"In a warehouse that holds a 1000 tires and a container that holds a 1000 tires and they both sit there for a year, the difference is what?"
1978.77-1378,0,37674,peter_l_briger,,1698.396,1707.045,"It would depend on the facts of the case and in your illustration the container could be used as a warehouse, the containers that we are dealing with --"
1978.77-1378,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1707.045,1709.817,And then you can tax it?
1978.77-1378,0,37674,peter_l_briger,,1709.817,1712.73,If it were sedentary I suppose --
1978.77-1378,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1712.73,1716.891,"If it were used as a warehouse, could California tax it?"
1978.77-1378,0,37674,peter_l_briger,,1716.891,1721.863,"If it were continually there, yes I would think that there are many distinctions."
1978.77-1378,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1765.904,1776.724,"Would you think that if you think the -- if the basis for ruling in your favor is the danger of double taxation, is that it – is that really --"
1978.77-1378,0,37674,peter_l_briger,,1776.724,1778.89,It's part of the danger.
1978.77-1378,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1792.886,1797.546,So what should California do about containers from Afghanistan if they are --
1978.77-1378,0,37674,peter_l_briger,,1797.546,1801.89,Well what -- we feel that California can do two things.
1978.77-1378,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1829.911,1835.813,"And now you are talking about all containers, not just containers from Afghanistan."
1978.77-1378,0,37674,peter_l_briger,,1840.687,1859.727,"Well, we think because of the foreign relations aspects of it, whether there is going to be retaliatory taxes imposed is something better left to the State Department and not to be determined by any number of local governments."
1978.77-1378,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1908.347,1911.082,Mr. Jones?
1978.77-1378,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,1911.082,1914.359,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1978.77-1378,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1974.025,1998.572,"Mr. Jones, what if this container had been used not only to ship material from Japan to Long Beach, but in inland from Long Beach say to Sacramento, but then a separate trip had been made in the container shipping goods from Sacramento down to the Imperial Valley and then it had gone back to Long Beach?"
1978.77-1378,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,1998.572,2004.79,"Yes, if all -- as I understand your question, at least part of that commerce was domestic commerce?"
1978.77-1378,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2004.79,2005.588,Right.
1978.77-1378,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2005.588,2019.021,Well in that context the international custom wouldn't apply because the international rule would not purport to intervene with the regulation of the domestic commerce between points within in the nation.
1978.77-1378,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2019.021,2032.227,"So the container could, a prorate tax could be levied on the container based on the portion of the time that it spent making the journey from Sacramento to another point in California carrying cargo?"
1978.77-1378,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2032.227,2044.35,If that journey were in domestic commerce as opposed to simply carrying imported goods further along and bringing exported goods out that would not be in consistent with our understanding of the international practice.
1978.77-1378,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2044.35,2049.492,"Well Mr. Jones, your footnote 14 suggests another answer."
1978.77-1378,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2060.155,2068.039,"Article 11 deals with the question of – no, I think that Article 11 is exactly consistent with what I have said."
1978.77-1378,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2068.039,2072.572,"Well I would suggest may be another answer to Mr. Justice Rehnquist, is it?"
1978.77-1378,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2072.572,2081.618,"Well, but our position with regard to the Customs Convention on Containers is that by its terms, it only restricts the imposition of duties."
1978.77-1378,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2085.737,2089.377,"What does your footnote 14 mean? It is yours, isn't it?"
1978.77-1378,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2089.377,2091.478,Yes it is.
1978.77-1378,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2091.478,2105.24,"And you say that the Customs Convention, 11 says containers used even occasionally for domestic traffic may be subjected to duties and taxes even in that nation?"
1978.77-1378,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2105.24,2107.467,"Well, I don't see, I'm having trouble seeing --"
1978.77-1378,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2107.467,2111.371,"But it's not another answer, it's a different ground for the same answer?"
1978.77-1378,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2111.371,2114.269,"Yes, I wouldn't argue with that."
1978.77-1378,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2196.421,2202.169,"Tell me Mr. Jones, the government makes neither a tonnage nor Import-Export Clause, are not they?"
1978.77-1378,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2202.169,2203.127,That's correct.
1978.77-1378,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2203.127,2207.085,You rely exclusively on the Commerce Clause right now?
1978.77-1378,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2207.085,2217.256,"Well, we rely exclusively on the Commerce Clause that we think the Import-Export Clause argument could be investigated, but it is wholly subsidiary to the Commerce Clause argument."
1978.77-1378,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2223.778,2229.468,Your Customs Convention argument isn't an independent one either?
1978.77-1378,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2229.468,2230.979,"It is an independent argument which, I --"
1978.77-1378,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2230.979,2233.83,That isn't necessarily common?
1978.77-1378,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2233.83,2237.371,No I would say it's a Supremacy Clause argument.
1978.77-1378,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2331.712,2336.552,"Well, would you say that was consistent with the Bob-Lo case which you just said?"
1978.77-1378,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2336.552,2338.024,"Yes, I would."
1978.77-1378,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2338.024,2343.228,There had been either reciprocal negotiations or uniform practice?
1978.77-1378,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2343.228,2354.143,No I would say that the Court's conclusion in that case was that there was no need for a uniform national rule or in any event that the states rule didn't conflict with any such need.
1978.77-1378,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2354.143,2362.079,"But that isn't quite what you said in the sentence before that, is it, that it has to depend either on uniform international practice or negotiations reciprocal?"
1978.77-1378,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2362.079,2376.01,The uniform rule that we think is needed in this case would have to come either from the accepted international practice or a revision of that practice that could only be obtained by reciprocal negotiations.
1978.77-1378,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2376.01,2381.862,"But you say in some cases, international commerce does not “need” a uniform rule?"
1978.77-1378,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2381.862,2385.219,I would say that that's correct.
1978.77-1378,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2502.748,2506.849,Do you agree this wasn't raised before the Supreme Court of California?
1978.77-1378,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2506.849,2524.106,"My understanding of the record is that the effect of the container, the possibility that the state tax was inconsistent with the container convention was raised now the way in which the argument was framed below was different than the way it is framed here."
1978.77-1378,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2542.894,2551.313,"But another Treaty was presented I take it, and the treaty Clause or the Supremacy Clause was -- that kind of an argument was presented?"
1978.77-1378,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2551.313,2552.089,That's true.
1978.77-1378,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2562.336,2564.556,Wasn't it a Treaty of Friendship --
1978.77-1378,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2564.556,2565.27,Yes it was raised also.
1978.77-1378,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2565.27,2568.16,"-- relied up on too, which was another Supremacy Clause argument?"
1978.77-1378,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2568.16,2568.827,Yes.
1978.77-1378,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2568.827,2587.62,"Well, do you think it would be sufficient in a State Court for a party to rely on the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and come up here and say I abandoned my Equal Protection Clause argument, I am now relying on the Due Process Clause and say I talked about the Fourteenth Amendment in the state Supreme Court?"
1978.77-1378,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2587.62,2596.826,"Well, with the last caveat that you added I would say that yes he could raise it, if he talked about it in the state Supreme Court?"
1978.77-1378,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2596.826,2600.281,Is it in the briefs?
1978.77-1378,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2600.281,2601.675,"Oh, yes sir."
1978.77-1378,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2601.675,2604.981,In the state court.
1978.77-1378,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2605.908,2609.973,"I would have to defer to counsel on that, I can't say for certain."
1978.77-1378,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2609.973,2617.068,"Well, how can we be sure that it was raised, if we can't find it in the brief?"
1978.77-1378,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2617.068,2618.116,"Well, my understanding was that it was --"
1978.77-1378,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2618.116,2636.413,"If you want to say that it is raised, wouldn't it be more helpful if we get to show on the briefs?"
1978.77-1378,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2636.413,2673.425,"As I recall the decision of the State Supreme Court, which of course incorporated the decision of the appellate court, the container convention argument had been rejected in the case that Court had previously considered the Sea-Land case and it's my recollection which may be incorrect and I cannot find the source at this point that there was reference made in the opinion in this Court to the fact that the Customs Convention had been held to be inapplicable in its prior decision."
1978.77-1378,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2677.016,2679.584,[Voice Overlap] for us to look it up?
1978.77-1378,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2679.584,2680.838,I don't want you to look it up.
1978.77-1378,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2761.395,2766.907,Where does the secretary's authority come from the issue of regulations?
1978.77-1378,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2766.907,2778.486,We don't think that the regulations themselves here in this case control our analysis under the McGoldrick theory any more than the regulations we thought relevant by the Court in McGoldrick.
1978.77-1378,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2784.76,2786.828,So you rely only on the treaty and not on the rights?
1978.77-1378,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2786.828,2790.924,That's correct.
1978.77-1378,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2790.924,2793.378,The regulatory authority rises under a separate statute?
1978.77-1378,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2793.378,2820.736,"The regulatory authority -- there is regulatory authority to amplify the substantive scheme and we wouldn't contend that the incidental domestic use exception was inconsistent with the container convention, but we would say that it is not supported by the container convention and that it is only the objectives of the container convention to protect the use the use of instruments in exclusively as they are used exclusively in foreign commerce."
1978.77-1378,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2849.562,2851.081,Mr. Clark?
1978.77-1378,2,29481,james_dexter_clark,,2851.081,2854.868,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1978.77-1378,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2921.8,2923.115,Before you do that --
1978.77-1378,2,29481,james_dexter_clark,,2923.115,2923.527,"Mr. Justice Stevens, yes sir."
1978.77-1378,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2923.527,2934.216,"-- the points you just made about the home port doctrine, would it apply -- would there be any difference if in this case involved the taxation on the vessel itself rather than the containers?"
1978.77-1378,2,29481,james_dexter_clark,,2934.216,2934.675,Quite frankly --
1978.77-1378,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2934.675,2937.153,And vessels where there are you know 10 or 15 days at a time?
1978.77-1378,2,29481,james_dexter_clark,,2937.153,2943.323,Quite frankly Mr. Justice Stevens it would depend upon whether that presence was created there.
1978.77-1378,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2952.51,2958.396,Suppose they are precisely as the same as your same amount of time in the port and exactly the same protection?
1978.77-1378,2,29481,james_dexter_clark,,2958.396,2969.656,"If those vessels came in and stayed there for an average of three weeks and came in on a rotated basis, as far as the Constitution is concerned I believe there is no difference whatsoever."
1978.77-1378,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2969.656,2973.833,"That will be the same if the average were three days, wouldn't it?"
1978.77-1378,2,29481,james_dexter_clark,,2973.833,2978.923,"Yes, that is correct Mr. Justice Stewart if the continuous presence were there and if the benefits --"
1978.77-1378,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2978.923,2982.251,"On average, three days per annum."
1978.77-1378,2,29481,james_dexter_clark,,2982.251,2989.567,"Per individual ship is that correct Mr. Justice Stewart, that would be the case I think."
1978.77-1378,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2989.567,3022.559,"And that was the case, wasn't it in the Hays case the – that was a New York Corporation with New York shareholders and but their ships rightly went to San Francisco and said the opinion states I don't have in front of me that the ships were in San Francisco regularly and spent enough time in San Francisco to unload and get new stores aboard and so on, and presumably they were there for an average length of time each ship for each year."
1978.77-1378,2,29481,james_dexter_clark,,3022.559,3031.535,"Mr. Justice Stewart, the problem in the Hays of course not only had it not considered the apportioned idea, but in addition there was no continues presence cited in that case."
1978.77-1378,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3034.111,3039.124,"There was in fact an average person per ship obviously, wasn't there?"
1978.77-1378,2,29481,james_dexter_clark,,3039.124,3057.977,"That's correct Your Honor, but the tax was a full ad valorem tax and the tax dealt with not an apportion tax, but a tax on each ship as it's full value and that is I think the real distinction in terms of Hays' factual situation and this one, that we do not pretend that we can tax each container on a full ad valorem basis."
1978.77-1378,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3113.669,3131.303,"Mr. Clark, I understand you are right that in the good old days when Queen Mary and Queen Elizabeth were coming every week that [Inaudible] could be taxed, because if so, we wouldn't have all this financing problem?"
1978.77-1378,2,29481,james_dexter_clark,,3131.303,3132.674,"Mr. Justice Marshall, if that can --"
1978.77-1378,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3132.674,3139.211,If you can tax a ship that came back and forth and say you are not tax the government?
1978.77-1378,2,29481,james_dexter_clark,,3139.211,3140.007,Mr. Justice Marshall.
1978.77-1378,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3140.007,3144.091,"Oh, [Inaudible] ship that is in commerce."
1978.77-1378,2,29481,james_dexter_clark,,3144.091,3159.142,"I think the logical extension of that is if you take it, if you say that the railroad cars in Pullman's Palace Cars may be taxed then I believe that if the benefits and protections are there, you are not taxing commerce as such."
1978.77-1378,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3167.892,3171.024,What benefits do you give a ship?
1978.77-1378,2,29481,james_dexter_clark,,3171.024,3171.477,Mr. Justice Marshall --
1978.77-1378,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3171.477,3173.144,Don't the ship have its own firefighting equipment?
1978.77-1378,2,29481,james_dexter_clark,,3173.144,3175.04,It may have and it may have a separate port authority.
1978.77-1378,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3175.04,3177.394,"Yeah, but it require they have [Inaudible]"
1978.77-1378,2,29481,james_dexter_clark,,3177.394,3204.19,"Yes Mr. Justice Marshall that is true too and also ports have their own fire fighting equipment as the appellants pointed out as far as Long Beach is concerned whether or not the fee imposed by the port would negate the idea of a benefits and protections test as applied to a vessel, I don't know because I have not looked into the question of a local jurisdictions benefits and protections as applied to a vessel."
1978.77-1378,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3235.547,3238.808,Any more of them truck itself that bears them?
1978.77-1378,2,29481,james_dexter_clark,,3238.808,3247.939,"Mr. Chief Justice, that is in more probability, no, as long as that truck has the same kind of existence in the taxing jurisdiction."
1978.77-1378,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3247.939,3257.424,"The carrier, the container here does not wear the highway out any more than the truck would if they had taken everything out of the container and --"
1978.77-1378,2,29481,james_dexter_clark,,3257.424,3261.129,"Yes it would, Your Honor, quite frankly it would with the added weight."
1978.77-1378,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3262.296,3264.626,Does the record show what the added weight is?
1978.77-1378,2,29481,james_dexter_clark,,3264.626,3269.668,"No, it is not Your Honor, that is absolutely true."
1978.77-1378,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3613.302,3620.19,"And tell me Mr. Clark, if you prevail, could Congress constitutionally prohibit this tax?"
1978.77-1378,2,29481,james_dexter_clark,,3620.19,3627.034,"Mr. Justice Brennan, it is not simply the power to prohibit that the United States or the Solicitor General seeks."
1978.77-1378,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3627.034,3629.345,"No, no, my question is if you prevail?"
1978.77-1378,2,29481,james_dexter_clark,,3629.345,3629.754,Yes sir.
1978.77-1378,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3629.754,3630.404,If you prevail --
1978.77-1378,2,29481,james_dexter_clark,,3630.404,3630.802,Right.
1978.77-1378,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3630.802,3635.35,-- could Congress nevertheless prohibit the county from imposing this tax?
1978.77-1378,2,29481,james_dexter_clark,,3635.35,3639.858,Right Mr. Justice Brennan what I believe it goes two ways.
1978.77-1378,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3639.858,3640.282,I see.
1978.77-1378,2,29481,james_dexter_clark,,3640.282,3644.248,I think that Congress can prohibit perhaps.
1978.77-1378,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3655.9,3656.739,How does it do that?
1978.77-1378,2,29481,james_dexter_clark,,3656.739,3673.599,"Well, the Solicitor General is urging this Court to adopt a position that would say in essence Congress can exempt a piece of property from state taxation whereas at the same time it leaves the state holding the bag for providing the benefits and protections to that particular piece of property."
1978.77-1378,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3688.544,3703.33,"But isn't the state of California perfectly free of the judgment the Supreme Court of California has reversed here to say the hell with these containers, we are not going to provide any protection to them because they don't contribute -- we are not allowed to exact an aliquot share of their tax burden?"
1978.77-1378,2,29481,james_dexter_clark,,3703.33,3706.26,I have -- that may be true Mr. Justice Rehnquist.
1978.77-1378,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3711.523,3715.977,If you don't [Inaudible] there are containers next to them?
1978.77-1378,2,29481,james_dexter_clark,,3715.977,3729.211,"I think that's true Mr. Justice Marshall, we have both sides to that question that I believe that number -- I do not know that a state could simply say for one specific person, we are not going to protect you because you don't pay."
1978.77-1378,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3768.215,3774.039,"What Article 1 power would that be, the power over international commerce?"
1978.77-1378,2,29481,james_dexter_clark,,3774.039,3779.792,I believe that it would either be the Commerce Clause power over commerce or perhaps the treaty power.
1978.77-1378,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3781.674,3796.834,"The President of United States negotiates treaties and then only one house of Congress gets involved in those, that's the senate, but I am telling you my brother Brennan's question to you had to do with what Congress could do, not what the President and, if there is a Senate --"
1978.77-1378,2,29481,james_dexter_clark,,3796.834,3802.217,"Well, I think Mr. Justice Stewart if -- I hope that I have answered the question with regard to Congress."
1978.77-1378,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3809.17,3826.16,"Therefore, they couldn't, Congress under that explicitly conferred power totally exempt these things from taxation, local, state or national and why wouldn't that be preemptive of any county or state?"
1978.77-1378,2,29481,james_dexter_clark,,3826.16,3829.903,Because number one regulation and taxation are two entirely different things.
1978.77-1378,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3865.196,3881.186,"We must talk and see that of course we have a federal system, but we must talk and see it further than the Framers chose to confer a great deal of power upon the Congress of the United States in the area of interstate and international commerce, that's correct isn't it?"
1978.77-1378,2,29481,james_dexter_clark,,3881.186,3882.564,"That is correct, Mr. Justice Stewart."
1978.77-1378,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3882.564,3894.738,And if Congress would -- if these things or these instrumentalities as they have been called are in the international commerce then why wouldn't Congress have complete power to exempt them from taxation?
1978.77-1378,2,29481,james_dexter_clark,,3894.738,3900.771,Because the regulation of commerce is different from the taxation of the property within the taxing jurisdiction.
1978.77-1378,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3927.057,3931.564,Then I -- did I misunderstand your answer to my brother Brennan's question?
1978.77-1378,2,29481,james_dexter_clark,,3934.095,3934.276,Oh!
1978.77-1378,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3955.478,3958.075,What your answer you are talking about now?
1978.77-1378,2,29481,james_dexter_clark,,3963.677,3992.118,"Mr. Justice Burger if, I am sorry, Mr. Chief Justice, the very idea of a tax or a piece of property being imposed, my envision would be perhaps that if the federal government decided that all foreign goods would remain immune from state taxation that in order to proceed in the national interest with national resources as was done in Missouri versus Holland."
1978.77-1378,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4009.718,4027.799,"While you mean Mr. Clark, the federal government, if it were to exempt these containers would have at least provide the county is the same -- with the amount that it losses in taxes in order to help support the police and fire?"
1978.77-1378,2,29481,james_dexter_clark,,4027.799,4044.894,"I believe Mr. Justice Brennan if there is anything to be said about that particular point, if we go so far as to say that federal government can make a non-discriminatory tax into a federal regulation, then I believe they have to take the burdens with the benefits."
1978.77-1378,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4044.894,4046.263,"Well then, you didn't answer my question."
1978.77-1378,2,29481,james_dexter_clark,,4046.263,4047.779,"Yes sir, it is."
1978.77-1378,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4047.779,4051.397,What would be duration of mandamus [Inaudible]
1978.77-1378,2,29481,james_dexter_clark,,4051.397,4053.107,"No, Mr. Justice Marshall."
1978.77-1378,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4053.107,4062.16,"How would you get this equipment out there that the federal government asked to, how would you get it?"
1978.77-1378,2,29481,james_dexter_clark,,4062.16,4062.339,Oh!
1978.77-1378,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4073.278,4075.431,But it is no federal enclave?
1978.77-1378,2,29481,james_dexter_clark,,4075.431,4076.118,"No, it is not Mr. Justice Marshall."
1978.77-1378,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4076.118,4077.56,We are speaking about Long Beach.
1978.77-1378,2,29481,james_dexter_clark,,4077.56,4079.214,That's right.
1978.77-1378,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4079.214,4081.317,Do you want Congress to take over Long Beach?
1978.77-1378,2,29481,james_dexter_clark,,4081.317,4085.135,"No Mr. Justice Marshall, I do not. [Attempt to Laughter]"
1978.77-1378,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4088.079,4089.533,I don't know what you are talking about.
1978.77-1378,2,29481,james_dexter_clark,,4089.533,4089.715,I am sorry Mr. Justice Marshall.
1978.77-1378,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4089.715,4098.955,Do you say this federal government has to give fire protection to Japanese containers in Long Beach.
1978.77-1378,2,29481,james_dexter_clark,,4098.955,4099.473,Mr. Justice Marshall.
1978.77-1378,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4099.473,4101.216,Is that what you say?
1978.77-1378,2,29481,james_dexter_clark,,4101.216,4102.301,What I am saying is this sir.
1978.77-1378,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4102.301,4105.316,Is that what you said?
1978.77-1378,2,29481,james_dexter_clark,,4105.316,4119.089,I think I said that if the federal -- it is logical to do that if the federal government claims the privilege of immunizing a piece of property from tax which is the recoupment for those benefits and protections.
1978.77-1378,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4119.089,4124.154,"Well, can't we rule against you without all of that?"
1978.77-1378,2,29481,james_dexter_clark,,4124.154,4126.423,You have to reach I believe Mr. Justice.
1978.77-1378,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4126.423,4127.92,Can't we?
1978.77-1378,2,29481,james_dexter_clark,,4127.92,4131.339,"You have to reach the congressional power, you have to at least say that Congress can."
1978.77-1378,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4131.339,4132.312,Do we have to?
1978.77-1378,2,29481,james_dexter_clark,,4132.312,4133.557,If you rely on the enactments of the treaties.
1978.77-1378,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4133.557,4135.782,"We don't have to, can't you say so?"
1978.77-1378,2,29481,james_dexter_clark,,4135.782,4139.241,"No sir, no sir of course not."
1978.77-1378,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4139.241,4143.411,"But, for you."
1978.77-1378,2,29481,james_dexter_clark,,4143.411,4144.526,"I am sorry, Mr. Justice Marshall."
1978.77-1378,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4148.098,4151.828,You said Congress had to.
1978.77-1378,2,29481,james_dexter_clark,,4165.647,4166.622,I think under the --
1978.77-1378,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4166.622,4167.455,Don't you say it?
1978.77-1378,2,29481,james_dexter_clark,,4167.455,4169.68,"Logically under the federal system, yes sir."
1978.77-1378,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4169.68,4170.505,That's what you said.M
1978.77-1378,2,29481,james_dexter_clark,,4170.505,4172.237,Yes sir.
1978.77-1378,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4172.237,4201.664,"Let's assume that someone in New Jersey starts a steamboat line running up or a diesel would be today I suppose, a diesel running up the Hudson River and then it obviously make stops at Hudson River ports, can New York tax the diesel barges and vessels that are going from New Jersey up the Hudson."
1978.77-1378,2,29481,james_dexter_clark,,4201.664,4202.388,I think only.
1978.77-1378,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4202.388,4205.221,Let's say they have exactly what we have got here can –
1978.77-1378,2,29481,james_dexter_clark,,4205.221,4212.826,If they have a continuous presence in the taxing jurisdiction and I think that those benefits and protections are there then the tax I think automatically follows.
1978.77-1378,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4212.826,4216.516,"Well, now Gibbons against Ogden didn't involve the tax."
1978.77-1378,2,29481,james_dexter_clark,,4216.516,4217.165,"No sir, it did not."
1978.77-1378,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4217.165,4229.869,"It involved the licensing, but you suggest that New York could tax New Jersey's diesel barges going up to Hudson, Pullman's Palace Cars."
1978.77-1378,2,29481,james_dexter_clark,,4229.869,4238.994,"Assuming what Pullman's Palace Car says Mr. Chief Justice, then the other side though too is that the regulation that's what Gibbons versus Ogden I think is all about."
1978.77-1378,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4263.613,4293.767,"Mr. Clark, supposing that we were -- the President were to negotiate a treaty with Japan confirmed by the -- ratified by the Senate and Congress has implementing legislation under the interstate commerce power saying exactly what the treaty said that no property imported from Japan should ever be subjected to any state property tax so long as it was in existence, no matter how long it had been in this country, do you think it will be constitutional for Congress to do?"
1978.77-1378,2,29481,james_dexter_clark,,4293.767,4297.66,"Mr. Justice Rehnquist, I have gotten into trouble with the Court on this."
1978.77-1378,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4302.124,4306.768,When you say proper did you think that would be constitutional for Congress to do that?
1978.77-1378,2,29481,james_dexter_clark,,4306.768,4308.549,No sir it would not.
1978.77-1378,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4336.525,4337.19,In fact --
1978.77-1378,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4337.19,4348.665,"You are urging that as an economic argument, advancing it that way or as a constitutional argument that there is a constitutional obligation to provide a substitute for the tax revenue?"
1978.77-1378,2,29481,james_dexter_clark,,4348.665,4353.928,Mr. Chief Justice I think the constitutional argument is that there is no power in Congress to do that in the first place.
1978.77-1378,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4356.205,4359.734,"Well, you said they could it if they made the substitute provision?"
1978.77-1378,2,29481,james_dexter_clark,,4359.734,4374.57,I'm sorry Your Honor I meant to say if they could do it I believe that that would follow and I believe that is an economic argument following I think the federal relationship between the state and the federal government.
1978.77-1378,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4375.451,4379.08,I just want to be sure what you are suggesting here about the quid pro quo.
1978.77-1378,2,29481,james_dexter_clark,,4380.824,4382.479,"No sir, they are not."
1978.77-1378,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4382.479,4384.757,I'm just wondering why you make the argument so strenuously.
1978.77-1378,2,29481,james_dexter_clark,,4390.283,4395.657,"Well, I think that quite frankly tactically that's, I'm sorry it is true, the enactment is not there."

1978.77-1378,2,29481,james_dexter_clark,,4457.832,4460.664,"Well, under California law we cannot."

1978.77-1378,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,4478.36,4491.95,"If we should affirm the decision of the California court, could the counter tax of the aircraft owned by foreign lands and based in foreign countries, but they use your airport?"
1978.77-1378,2,29481,james_dexter_clark,,4491.95,4505.612,"If the continuous presence is there, actually on the scheduled airlines I think that Ott versus Mississippi Barge Lines would go along with a regular presence as well as continuous, I would say yes."
1978.77-1378,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,4505.612,4508.441,The aircraft also use containers?
1978.77-1378,2,29481,james_dexter_clark,,4508.441,4527.5,"They have their own interior containers which are however are not used in the same way as these containers, they are simply taken off the airplane, perhaps taken to the warehouse often unloaded directly at the airport and kept with the airplane itself."
1978.77-1378,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4527.5,4532.363,But Mr. Clark you would say you could tax not only the containers but the aircraft itself?
1978.77-1378,2,29481,james_dexter_clark,,4532.363,4537.411,Oh yes Mr. Justice Brennan I think there was a question to whether we could tax the aircraft and I think that's correct.
1978.77-1378,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4537.411,4550.387,Is it possible to distinguish the aircraft from the taxation and the containers here so that we could affirm the decision of the Supreme Court of California and yet nonetheless not foreclose the question of the taxability of the aircraft?
1978.77-1378,2,29481,james_dexter_clark,,4550.387,4553.107,"Yes, Mr. Justice Rehnquist I think so."
1978.77-1378,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4599.632,4609.52,"Yes Mr. Clark if you are right and you could tax the aircraft, I take it if Japan airlines has scheduled stop at Los Angeles."
1978.77-1378,2,29481,james_dexter_clark,,4609.52,4609.837,Yes Sir.
1978.77-1378,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4609.837,4621.004,"And another scheduled stop at Chicago and another scheduled stop at New York, at (Inaudible) that Illinois and New York could also tax the aircraft?"
1978.77-1378,2,29481,james_dexter_clark,,4621.004,4623.418,That's correct Mr. Justice Brennan.
1978.77-1378,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4628.251,4629.663,Presence of what?
1978.77-1378,2,29481,james_dexter_clark,,4629.663,4632.537,Only in keeping with its apportioned presence.
1978.77-1378,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4632.537,4636.272,Could you also tax the trains that stop at each place?
1978.77-1378,2,29481,james_dexter_clark,,4636.272,4638.628,"Mr. Justice Marshall, we do."
1978.77-1378,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4638.628,4639.4,You could?
1978.77-1378,2,29481,james_dexter_clark,,4639.4,4639.903,Yes sir.
1978.77-1378,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4639.903,4642.253,"And the Pullman, what about the Pullman case?"
1978.77-1378,2,29481,james_dexter_clark,,4642.253,4649.296,"The Pullman case has been followed by every state imposing personal property taxes ever since its inception, yes sir."
1978.77-1378,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4649.296,4653.088,And you put the trains and planes on the same level?
1978.77-1378,2,29481,james_dexter_clark,,4653.088,4653.979,"Sir, I think the difference between --"
1978.77-1378,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4653.979,4659.379,"I should take a whole lot of weight, you are only talking about -- this case only involves containers?"
1978.77-1378,2,29481,james_dexter_clark,,4659.379,4660.143,Yes Mr. Justice Marshall.
1978.77-1378,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4660.143,4664.29,"[Inaudible] ships and everything else, how far you going?"
1978.77-1378,2,29481,james_dexter_clark,,4664.29,4665.744,"Mr. Justice Marshall, I think that there are --"
1978.77-1378,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4665.744,4669.921,[Inaudible] just a container point [Inaudible] decided by this Court?
1978.77-1378,2,29481,james_dexter_clark,,4669.921,4688.444,"I believe that it can be decided that way Mr. Justice Marshall, that's correct and I don't mean to assert or push anybody Mr. Justice Marshall, but what I'm saying in essence is that the apportionment doctrine logically applies to the benefits and protections conferred to all of these instrumentalities."
1978.77-1378,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4692.105,4694.94,You won't be satisfied that we just stop on containers.
1978.77-1378,2,29481,james_dexter_clark,,4694.94,4696.682,"Oh no sir, I'll be satisfied."
1978.77-1378,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4696.682,4701.727,"Well, it wasn't your idea to make this broad argument, you are simply trying to answer the questions from members of the Court."
1978.77-1378,2,29481,james_dexter_clark,,4701.727,4703.293,That is correct Mr. Justice Stewart and --
1978.77-1378,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4703.293,4704.389,I started it.
1978.77-1378,2,29481,james_dexter_clark,,4704.389,4721.35,[Attempt to Laughter] The home port doctrine then deals with the exceptions to it and the argument regarding the home port doctrine deals with that exception by means of apportionment.
1978.77-1378,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4790.215,4790.874,Thank you gentlemen.
