1982.81-1581,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,8.965,We will hear arguments next in Olim against Wakinekona.
1982.81-1581,0,36229,michael_a_lilly,,59.601,77.015,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the question presented by this case is whether state-created pretransfer procedures prior to an interstate transfer of an inmate implicate a liberty interest protected by the Fourteenth Amendment."
1982.81-1581,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,269.073,276.214,"Mr. Lilly, in reading the Ninth Circuit's opinion, I had some difficulty, because I couldn't find any place where the rules were set out."
1982.81-1581,0,36229,michael_a_lilly,,281.602,285.865,--The rules are attached in the Joint Appendix.
1982.81-1581,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,292.517,294.362,Thank you.
1982.81-1581,0,36229,michael_a_lilly,,294.362,298.89,And if you will read in the... Those rules provide two basic processes that are addressed.
1982.81-1581,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,351.727,354.274,What happens when he goes to Folsome?
1982.81-1581,0,36229,michael_a_lilly,,354.274,363.707,"When Mr. Wakinekona goes to Folsome, then he comes under the programs and the operation of the Folsome prison system."
1982.81-1581,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,363.707,367.115,Which wouldn't be as present inmates.
1982.81-1581,0,36229,michael_a_lilly,,367.115,373.0,"He would be the same as a Folsome inmate if he went to Folsome, as he did."
1982.81-1581,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,373.0,377.983,"And another thing is, how does his family visit him in Folsome?"
1982.81-1581,0,36229,michael_a_lilly,,377.983,383.497,"There is no question that when you have an interstate transfer, that it makes it more onerous."
1982.81-1581,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,383.497,386.651,This is a little more than a normal interstate transfer.
1982.81-1581,0,36229,michael_a_lilly,,400.007,416.998,"I agree with you that it presents different situations, except it is not unlike, for example, the Court's consideration in the Howe versus Smith case last session, in which an inmate was transferred from Vermont to the federal prison in Georgia."
1982.81-1581,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,418.983,424.777,The Pacific Ocean isn't between Vermont and Georgia.
1982.81-1581,0,36229,michael_a_lilly,,424.777,427.651,--It's... if I may say... I agree with that.
1982.81-1581,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,465.995,469.165,"Well, it always involves a balancing of all the interests, does it not?"
1982.81-1581,0,36229,michael_a_lilly,,469.165,471.259,--It is a very delicate balancing.
1982.81-1581,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,499.917,510.991,"Mr. Lilly, what specific rules were not followed by the state in connection with the process of this transfer?"
1982.81-1581,0,36229,michael_a_lilly,,517.176,529.093,"Apparently, what is alleged, that it was... the composition is the... claiming that Mr. Wakinekona did not have an impartial tribunal."
1982.81-1581,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,529.093,533.277,Is that the only alleged failure to follow the rule?
1982.81-1581,0,36229,michael_a_lilly,,533.277,534.447,I think that's probably the basic--
1982.81-1581,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,534.447,536.417,As you understand it?
1982.81-1581,0,36229,michael_a_lilly,,536.417,537.025,--As I understand it.
1982.81-1581,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,543.272,552.86,"But as you understand it, the sole defect here, if there is one, would be in the composition of the program committee that--"
1982.81-1581,0,36229,michael_a_lilly,,552.86,553.987,"--Yes, Justice O'Connor."
1982.81-1581,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,553.987,554.689,--provided the hearing.
1982.81-1581,0,36229,michael_a_lilly,,565.14,567.262,"For purposes of this argument, we will."
1982.81-1581,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,567.262,572.074,May I ask just a question about your prisons?
1982.81-1581,0,36229,michael_a_lilly,,576.542,580.524,He was transferred... He was housed in the Hawaii State Prison.
1982.81-1581,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,580.524,582.477,"Which is where, just out of curiosity?"
1982.81-1581,0,36229,michael_a_lilly,,582.477,583.554,Just outside of Honolulu.
1982.81-1581,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,583.554,584.693,It is on Oahu?
1982.81-1581,0,36229,michael_a_lilly,,584.693,585.726,It is on Oahu.
1982.81-1581,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,594.238,597.954,Do they have similar institutions on other islands in the state?
1982.81-1581,0,36229,michael_a_lilly,,597.954,606.607,"Every island has an institution, basically medium security facilities for people who live in that locality."
1982.81-1581,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,606.607,607.434,I see.
1982.81-1581,0,36229,michael_a_lilly,,615.073,617.242,We have had a number of contests.
1982.81-1581,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,621.087,621.992,I see.
1982.81-1581,0,36229,michael_a_lilly,,621.992,626.519,And a number of state actions contesting interstate transfers.
1982.81-1581,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,790.189,792.314,"We will resume there at 1:00 o'clock, Mr. Lilly."
1982.81-1581,0,36229,michael_a_lilly,,809.573,810.712,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1982.81-1581,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,937.427,942.862,"Mr. Lilly, what is the doctrine you say you think has little vitality after Meachum?"
1982.81-1581,0,36229,michael_a_lilly,,942.862,952.467,The notion that grievous loss in any way on its face implicates a liberty interest.
1982.81-1581,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,952.467,966.927,"I think the decisions from this Court, maybe some have avoided use of the term and some haven't, perhaps just because of its vagueness, but in a sense Hawaii has brought its problems on itself here."
1982.81-1581,0,36229,michael_a_lilly,,973.536,978.952,They were... the rules are... I think it is probably a poor choice of words.
1982.81-1581,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1021.281,1026.343,"Well, you say he complains about being transferred, but he doesn't complain about the decision to transfer."
1982.81-1581,0,36229,michael_a_lilly,,1026.343,1028.964,About the actual decision.
1982.81-1581,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1046.878,1053.16,How would you know what the result would be before a different kind of a tribunal?
1982.81-1581,0,36229,michael_a_lilly,,1053.16,1073.025,"If... in this particular case, Hawaii has adopted rules and regulations to provide for procedures, which gives him a modicum of process, but has not said that Mr. Wakinekona has in any respect a right to remain in Hawaii."
1982.81-1581,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1080.149,1084.536,"Is the right to have family visits within liberty, do you consider?"
1982.81-1581,0,36229,michael_a_lilly,,1084.536,1094.985,"I don't believe... I don't believe that that's before the Court, but I don't think that the right to have family per se visit is necessarily a constitutional right."
1982.81-1581,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1094.985,1096.999,I said a liberty.
1982.81-1581,0,36229,michael_a_lilly,,1096.999,1106.17,"I don't think that the right to have family visit is in itself a liberty, a freedom."
1982.81-1581,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1106.17,1108.997,I didn't think so.
1982.81-1581,0,36229,michael_a_lilly,,1108.997,1116.274,"And our rules and regulations due use the term ""grievousness"", but those are the state's rules and regulations."
1982.81-1581,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1165.002,1167.736,I thought he was transferred because he was such an unruly prisoner.
1982.81-1581,0,36229,michael_a_lilly,,1167.736,1171.846,"That is... There are two parts of the decision, the recommendation--"
1982.81-1581,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1171.846,1172.594,"Well, give us both."
1982.81-1581,0,36229,michael_a_lilly,,1174.376,1179.59,--What happened was that they were evaluating in one respect his classification.
1982.81-1581,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1218.499,1220.449,Benefitting him with those programs?
1982.81-1581,0,36229,michael_a_lilly,,1220.449,1221.794,--That's right.
1982.81-1581,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1221.794,1228.385,"I suppose the alternative would have been to put him in solitary confinement, create a special cell somewhere and put him in solitary confinement permanently."
1982.81-1581,0,36229,michael_a_lilly,,1228.385,1233.084,That is exactly what we are faced with in Hawaii in this period of construction.
1982.81-1581,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1244.471,1249.766,Are there any prisons... You said there were prisons on a number of the islands in the chain.
1982.81-1581,0,36229,michael_a_lilly,,1252.078,1255.374,"--One on Kauai, one on Maui, and one on the big island, Hawaii."
1982.81-1581,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1255.374,1256.185,The big islands.
1982.81-1581,0,36229,michael_a_lilly,,1257.701,1258.638,Now--
1982.81-1581,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1258.638,1277.694,"I have been bothered, and perhaps my colleagues don't share this trouble, by the kind of generality of the discussion in the Ninth Circuit's opinion and a little bit by the character of the... kind of... as opposed to focusing down on just what was involved in this particular case."
1982.81-1581,0,36229,michael_a_lilly,,1297.091,1298.294,--We don't believe--
1982.81-1581,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1298.294,1299.2,It doesn't give him any--
1982.81-1581,0,36229,michael_a_lilly,,1299.2,1300.588,--It doesn't make any difference.
1982.81-1581,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1320.502,1325.299,"--But I thought his claim of bias was just, it was the same tribunal that had had this hearing--"
1982.81-1581,0,36229,michael_a_lilly,,1325.299,1325.767,Yes.
1982.81-1581,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1325.767,1328.251,--and they already knew more about him than maybe he wanted them to know.
1982.81-1581,0,36229,michael_a_lilly,,1328.251,1352.397,"Well, the... if you understand the process of a classification within a prison system, you will know that they have... the same bodies will review inmates periodically and on an ongoing basis, and they become familiar with inmates in the system, and how things are done, and this has a utility, because then they can make a more informed decision about placement of inmates."
1982.81-1581,1,39626,robert_gilbert_johnston,,1693.491,1702.145,"Your Honor, I believe under Vitek we could establish a liberty interest under the change in conditions."
1982.81-1581,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1707.407,1711.674,Were there any regulations or any controlling state law in Vitek?
1982.81-1581,1,39626,robert_gilbert_johnston,,1711.674,1715.405,"In Vitek, you have a two-prong approach, as I understand it."
1982.81-1581,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1738.18,1751.314,"Would you not think there is some difference between being transferred from an institution of pure confinement, that is, a prison, and to a mental institution, different from being transferred from one classification of prison to another?"
1982.81-1581,1,39626,robert_gilbert_johnston,,1751.314,1753.844,"There would be a difference on that, Your Honor."
1982.81-1581,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1757.0,1762.341,"Vitek didn't rest just on the substantiality of the change of conditions, did it?"
1982.81-1581,1,39626,robert_gilbert_johnston,,1762.341,1776.458,"Not entirely, Your Honor, but I believe the precise language is that there was a qualitative change in the conditions of confinement not substantiated by the terms of the sentence."
1982.81-1581,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1776.458,1782.74,"But those words, that language must be read in the context of the facts of the case."
1982.81-1581,1,39626,robert_gilbert_johnston,,1782.74,1805.946,"Yes, Your Honor, it must, but I think that this case is sufficiently analogous, because I would submit that a transfer of a person such as Wakinekona from Hawaii under the circumstances he was transferred to the mainland indeed raises the same kind of liberty interest that is raised in Vitek on the transfer from the penal institution to the mental hospital."
1982.81-1581,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1805.946,1811.6,Suppose Hawaii had another... I don't know how... what's the sweep of the islands.
1982.81-1581,1,39626,robert_gilbert_johnston,,1815.179,1817.613,I would say about 350 diagonally.
1982.81-1581,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1817.613,1834.56,"Well, let's assume that the only maximum prison was 300 miles away from Honolulu, and he was... Would you say that the same constitutional factors were raised if he was transferred to the only maximum security institution available 350 miles away?"
1982.81-1581,1,39626,robert_gilbert_johnston,,1834.56,1843.229,"That would raise a very difficult question, Your Honor, and I am not sure that I could justify a change of that distance."
1982.81-1581,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1843.229,1851.476,"It would be not as difficult, but it would be certainly difficult for family to make visits, would it not, 350 miles?"
1982.81-1581,1,39626,robert_gilbert_johnston,,1851.476,1860.379,"Yes, it would, if he were to be transferred to a different island entirely, because he would still have the problem of interisland or intercounty transport for the family to visit him, unless he had family on the island that it was on."
1982.81-1581,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1945.22,1948.656,But that isn't the basis on which the court of appeals proceeded--
1982.81-1581,1,39626,robert_gilbert_johnston,,1948.656,1949.202,"No, it's--"
1982.81-1581,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1949.202,1955.418,"--and the issue here is violation of state procedures, is a withholding of state procedures."
1982.81-1581,1,39626,robert_gilbert_johnston,,1955.418,1960.261,"--Yes, based upon whether or not there is indeed a liberty interest created."
1982.81-1581,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1960.261,1961.073,Under state law.
1982.81-1581,1,39626,robert_gilbert_johnston,,1962.885,1970.848,"And also, Your Honor, whether or not there is a residual of liberty that would be protected regardless of the existence of state law."
1982.81-1581,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1970.848,1976.222,"Well, that isn't what the court of appeals said."
1982.81-1581,1,39626,robert_gilbert_johnston,,1976.222,1981.642,"No, the court of appeals, though it cited Vitek, went on the rules alone."
1982.81-1581,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1981.642,1985.53,It went strictly on the liberty interest created by state law.
1982.81-1581,1,39626,robert_gilbert_johnston,,1985.53,1986.294,That is correct.
1982.81-1581,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1986.891,1990.077,Do you think the opinion of the court of appeals is internally consistent?
1982.81-1581,1,39626,robert_gilbert_johnston,,1993.559,1995.794,"--I don't know why they did that, Your Honor."
1982.81-1581,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2010.662,2020.048,But you would agree that the questions presented to us on review of the Ninth Circuit simply don't involve that issue?
1982.81-1581,1,39626,robert_gilbert_johnston,,2020.048,2022.517,They don't involve the issue of bias.
1982.81-1581,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2027.484,2033.373,So we should assume that the tribunal which did pass on this thing was totally unprejudiced?
1982.81-1581,1,39626,robert_gilbert_johnston,,2033.373,2037.012,"No, just to the contrary, because we have alleged that it was biased."
1982.81-1581,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2037.012,2041.524,"Well, but we have to somewhat segregate the issue that is before us for decision."
1982.81-1581,1,39626,robert_gilbert_johnston,,2049.318,2061.64,"Mr. Justice Rehnquist, I would believe that we should, regarding the question of personal animosity, the bias, that should be determined in the first instance by the district court."
1982.81-1581,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2061.64,2065.122,"We would certainly leave that open in any decision we rendered, I think."
1982.81-1581,1,39626,robert_gilbert_johnston,,2065.122,2079.898,"Yes, and I would think that it would be appropriate, if there is a liberty interest here, to remand for that specific issue, because there is indeed a jury asked for in this action as to the facts, and we definitely, I believe, on the record, have a question of fact as to that point."
1982.81-1581,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2079.898,2083.116,The court of appeals hasn't decided a question which he raised.
1982.81-1581,1,39626,robert_gilbert_johnston,,2084.633,2091.066,"It was raised in the trial court, and the trial court didn't address it, and therefore the court of appeals didn't address it."
1982.81-1581,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2119.229,2137.142,"Well, to that extent, and to the extent of a statutory scheme or, you know, things peculiar to the Hawaii system that courts not in Hawaii might not be familiar with, I should think the best authority on that is the Supreme Court of Hawaii, and they have spoken on the question, haven't they?"
1982.81-1581,1,39626,robert_gilbert_johnston,,2137.142,2152.355,"--Your Honor, in that regard, the Lono case addressed only Rule 4, because that apparently was all that was presented to it, rather than considering the other rules that should be read in conjunction."
1982.81-1581,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2152.355,2154.901,"Well, you say should be read in conjunction."
1982.81-1581,1,39626,robert_gilbert_johnston,,2163.052,2172.235,"I would submit that perhaps counsel didn't present the other rules to the court, and that could well explain what happened."
1982.81-1581,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2188.464,2191.463,How are Rules 3 and 5 involved in this case?
1982.81-1581,1,39626,robert_gilbert_johnston,,2211.361,2232.556,"If I may, the... looking at the rules in total, particularly Rule 5, there are four circumstances in which an inmate is entitled to have a lawyer present at a hearing, two of which are in essence the disciplinary hearings."
1982.81-1581,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2272.491,2274.757,Didn't he have a lawyer?
1982.81-1581,1,39626,robert_gilbert_johnston,,2278.929,2279.522,Yes.
1982.81-1581,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2308.838,2320.163,"Well, I suppose even conceding that the consequences of an interstate transfer are significant and important, that doesn't answer the question, does it?"
1982.81-1581,1,39626,robert_gilbert_johnston,,2325.392,2340.732,"No, I think we have to look to the rules and see what has occurred in the context of this case, in view of the particular concerns that we would have for transferring somebody interstate, and in addition the rules and practices of giving a hearing in this."
1982.81-1581,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2341.73,2350.93,"Now, there are no substantive standards set forth in Hawaii procedure, are there, to govern when an interstate transfer will be--"
1982.81-1581,1,39626,robert_gilbert_johnston,,2350.93,2361.783,"--I would refer you to the Joint Appendix and the Rule 4, the general considerations."
1982.81-1581,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2365.846,2366.626,--What page?
1982.81-1581,1,39626,robert_gilbert_johnston,,2366.626,2369.017,"--I am sorry, Mr. Justice Rehnquist."
1982.81-1581,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2400.953,2414.028,"Well, it could be just kind of a joint right of allocation, kind of a best interest hearing, where everybody... anybody affected is entitled to be heard, but it is totally discretionary with the deciding authority."
1982.81-1581,1,39626,robert_gilbert_johnston,,2414.028,2421.086,"Well, no, I don't think we can... well, I guess we could disagree on that and make such a conclusion."
1982.81-1581,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2453.355,2470.443,"But then as determined by the Hawaii Supreme Court, the final decision is made by the facility administrator, and he is free to disregard those findings, apparently, without any substantive standard, and make the determination."
1982.81-1581,1,39626,robert_gilbert_johnston,,2475.441,2476.721,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1982.81-1581,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2514.737,2522.813,"Well, so what you want us to do is say the Hawaii Supreme Court was wrong, and we aren't bound by its determination."
1982.81-1581,1,39626,robert_gilbert_johnston,,2522.813,2527.044,"--On one point, yes, Your Honor."
1982.81-1581,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2604.512,2609.714,"Well, doesn't Folsome have a prison advocacy group and social workers surrounding it?"
1982.81-1581,1,39626,robert_gilbert_johnston,,2611.792,2621.052,"As a matter of fact, when he was transferred to Folsome, he was kept in maximum security there without any programs."
1982.81-1581,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2621.052,2624.909,"Well, but I mean, you say, no access to counsel."
1982.81-1581,1,39626,robert_gilbert_johnston,,2628.657,2649.694,"I am suggesting that in Wakinekona's case, a factor which is unique to this situation among the questions of distance is also the consideration that Wakinekona, if in Hawaii, would have access to workers who are trained to deal with a person such as Wakinekona who is a native Hawaiian."
1982.81-1581,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2649.694,2653.644,"--Well, but you can say the same thing in southern California."
1982.81-1581,1,39626,robert_gilbert_johnston,,2668.264,2670.639,I am not saying it turns solely on that.
1982.81-1581,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2670.639,2673.84,Do you suggest that is a constitutional factor?
1982.81-1581,1,39626,robert_gilbert_johnston,,2673.84,2699.845,"I am suggesting the total impact of all these factors I am addressing raises a liberty interest which gives Wakinekona an entitlement to a due process hearing which would basically in any prison situation include an impartial or a fair tribunal, because we don't have many of the other accoutrements of due process in prison hearings."
1982.81-1581,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2720.37,2733.599,"Mr. Johnston, you don't need to show the deprivation of a constitutionally protected liberty interest in order to show that you may be entitled to an unbiased tribunal, do you?"
1982.81-1581,1,39626,robert_gilbert_johnston,,2733.599,2742.736,I would think that you are entitled as a matter of course to an unbiased tribunal.
1982.81-1581,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2751.359,2762.663,"I think the Ninth Circuit's opinion has really balled up this whole thing, if you will pardon me for saying so, because I think that it is very indistinct just what the parties are arguing about."
1982.81-1581,1,39626,robert_gilbert_johnston,,2777.11,2783.451,"No, Your Honor, and that is the position we took in the lower court, in the trial court, but we didn't win on that point."
1982.81-1581,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2783.451,2785.062,So you changed your strategy.
1982.81-1581,1,39626,robert_gilbert_johnston,,2785.062,2786.906,"No, I didn't change the strategy, if I may."
1982.81-1581,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2798.215,2809.94,"You were entitled to ask for affirmance on another ground, even if you lost on it below and didn't cross appeal or anything."
1982.81-1581,1,39626,robert_gilbert_johnston,,2814.581,2815.72,"Well, yes, Your Honor."
1982.81-1581,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2826.03,2838.353,"That claim, that is not on the... on a claim that the due process clause of the federal constitution has been violated because you have been deprived of your life, your liberty, or your property, and probably your liberty, without due process of law."
1982.81-1581,1,39626,robert_gilbert_johnston,,2838.353,2849.489,"That is the only thing I think Mr. Wakinekona can claim here, and that he has indeed been deprived of his liberty because there was an interest where he should be entitled to somebody that made this decision."
1982.81-1581,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2849.489,2858.158,The Ninth Circuit said you win based on liberty interest created by the procedural protections of state law.
1982.81-1581,1,39626,robert_gilbert_johnston,,2858.158,2862.732,"Yes, they went on that point, Your Honor, but that was not the only point we had been arguing."
1982.81-1581,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2862.732,2870.075,Is there any evidence in this record on which any court at this stage could pass on the claims of bias?
1982.81-1581,1,39626,robert_gilbert_johnston,,2870.075,2878.322,"Your Honor, again, I would refer you to the various pages I did, but the answer is yes."
1982.81-1581,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2886.8,2887.271,That is the complaint.
1982.81-1581,1,39626,robert_gilbert_johnston,,2891.471,2892.375,There was an affidavit attached to that.
1982.81-1581,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2902.39,2905.373,Did the district court make any findings on that issue?
1982.81-1581,1,39626,robert_gilbert_johnston,,2905.373,2907.935,"No, the district court did not address any of the discovery."
1982.81-1581,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2916.635,2921.506,"Then you could not rely on that issue in this court or in the court of appeals, absent some evidence, could you?"
1982.81-1581,1,39626,robert_gilbert_johnston,,2921.506,2926.099,"Well, Your Honor, I don't think we should be thrown out on that point."
1982.81-1581,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2928.13,2928.629,Yes.
1982.81-1581,1,39626,robert_gilbert_johnston,,2933.095,2934.077,"No, Your Honor."
1982.81-1581,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2934.077,2936.908,--because there is a limited amount of evidence.
1982.81-1581,1,39626,robert_gilbert_johnston,,2936.908,2958.758,"I would agree that... if the Court agrees that Wakinekona has an interest that entitles him to a due process hearing, that that matter should be remanded back down to the federal district court of Hawaii to resolve that matter, and then perhaps we could ignore the Ninth Circuit opinion, if it is going to cause the grief that it seems to be causing."
1982.81-1581,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2958.758,2960.867,I may have spoken too hastily.
1982.81-1581,1,39626,robert_gilbert_johnston,,3008.939,3020.686,"As I understand it, really, the question is, Fano would insist that there be a liberty interest created in order to have procedural protections."
1982.81-1581,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3020.686,3024.729,"Well, in order to guarantee an unbiased tribunal it would be a constitutional dimension."
1982.81-1581,1,39626,robert_gilbert_johnston,,3024.729,3043.331,"I would believe that Fano would take that position, but, Your Honor, I think that Fano has been rather severely cut back by the case of Vitek, and I would suggest that our case is almost on all fours with Vitek on both of the points that we are addressing."
1982.81-1581,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3043.331,3043.677,"Well, it isn't--"
1982.81-1581,1,39626,robert_gilbert_johnston,,3045.284,3047.175,"Yes, I am aware of that, Your Honor."
1982.81-1581,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3047.175,3049.611,"Yes, you are about to be asked about it, too."
1982.81-1581,1,39626,robert_gilbert_johnston,,3100.184,3107.461,"I am suggesting this particular interstate transfer is out of bounds, because it in essence, as we have argued--"
1982.81-1581,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3107.461,3119.487,"So you do agree, you have to say that it is just out of bounds in the sense that no prison administrator should contemplate making this kind of a transfer without a hearing, whether there are regulations or not."
1982.81-1581,1,39626,robert_gilbert_johnston,,3119.487,3122.876,"--Yes, that is one point, Your Honor, and as I said--"
1982.81-1581,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3122.876,3125.013,You have to make that point to rely on Vitek.
1982.81-1581,1,39626,robert_gilbert_johnston,,3125.013,3125.983,"--Correct, Your Honor."
1982.81-1581,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3125.983,3129.669,Which is not the basis the court of appeals went on.
1982.81-1581,1,39626,robert_gilbert_johnston,,3129.669,3130.901,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1982.81-1581,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3130.901,3137.199,"Then what would be your position, again, on an interisland transfer if it were 350 miles apart?"
1982.81-1581,1,39626,robert_gilbert_johnston,,3137.199,3147.365,"Your Honor, as in any case where we begin to move the distances back and forth a little bit, the distance should be a factor to be taken into account."
1982.81-1581,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3186.551,3195.672,What if he had been assigned to that prison by the State of Hawaii in the first instance on the ground that they had no facilities adequate to take care of him?
1982.81-1581,1,39626,robert_gilbert_johnston,,3195.672,3208.419,"Mr. Chief Justice, that raises the issue that we have made a finding that they have no facilities adequate, which presupposes, I take it, a hearing."
1982.81-1581,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3250.105,3258.946,A hearing even if there are no standards to determine whether the transfer should be ordered or not?
1982.81-1581,1,39626,robert_gilbert_johnston,,3260.475,3262.162,"In this case, yes."
1982.81-1581,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3274.282,3281.918,"Well, that is debatable, I guess, isn't it, if you read the Hawaii court decision?"
1982.81-1581,1,39626,robert_gilbert_johnston,,3281.918,3318.343,"I am afraid that I can't dispute that point, but I do think that this Court can look past the Hawaii decision in this instance, because of the underlying due process concerns of an impartial tribunal, and I do think that this Court can even ignore the question of the regulations and look to the question of whether or not a transfer of this nature for Wakinekona is so outrageous that there should be a hearing to decide if there is justifiable reason to send him across the sea."
1982.81-1581,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3318.343,3323.244,"Well, you are bound to have to mix your procedural argument with a substantive argument, aren't you?"
1982.81-1581,1,39626,robert_gilbert_johnston,,3334.834,3336.429,"Well, I don't... I--"
1982.81-1581,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3336.429,3338.258,Which isn't really a procedural--
1982.81-1581,1,39626,robert_gilbert_johnston,,3338.258,3348.158,"--I would think that we could contrive as an advocate for somebody almost any argument we wished, but I would hope that we wouldn't go that far, Justice White."
1982.81-1581,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3349.452,3355.326,--You think you could shame them into not transferring if you had some procedures?
1982.81-1581,1,39626,robert_gilbert_johnston,,3355.326,3356.155,--I would think--
1982.81-1581,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3356.155,3357.076,Or talk them into--
1982.81-1581,1,39626,robert_gilbert_johnston,,3357.076,3381.66,"--I would think that we would have perhaps had a very good chance of prevailing at that time if indeed we had a neutral or an impartial hearing board rather than the one that was personally biased against Wakinekona, and I do think we should be entitled to give that at least a chance, because otherwise, as I say, Mr. Wakinekona is gone forever, as far as we can tell at this point."
1982.81-1581,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3397.124,3402.042,"--The kind of procedural rules, was this ""lawyer"" a fellow inmate?"
1982.81-1581,1,39626,robert_gilbert_johnston,,3402.042,3403.137,--No.
1982.81-1581,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3403.137,3404.4,It was a regular lawyer?
1982.81-1581,1,39626,robert_gilbert_johnston,,3404.4,3412.399,"It was a regular lawyer who asked for an extension of time in order to prepare the case, and then the whole problem--"
1982.81-1581,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3412.399,3412.883,Right.
1982.81-1581,1,39626,robert_gilbert_johnston,,3412.883,3431.872,"--began to develop when we complained about the character of the particular tribunal as being a tribunal that was biased, and the bias goes to personal animosity and violation of the rules, both, not just violation of the rules, and I think that that makes it an important difference."
1982.81-1581,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3443.025,3445.946,"How about the right of allocution, which is strictly a procedural rule?"
1982.81-1581,1,39626,robert_gilbert_johnston,,3464.969,3477.871,"--Well, I think that under these rules that we do have a hearing, that they are entitled to find these points because of the introductory paragraphs to Rule 3."
1982.81-1581,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3478.978,3480.511,"Do you have anything further, Mr. Lilly?"
1982.81-1581,2,36229,michael_a_lilly,,3480.511,3481.447,Very briefly.
1982.81-1581,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3481.447,3483.463,You have four minutes remaining.
1982.81-1581,2,36229,michael_a_lilly,,3483.463,3508.326,"I don't believe that it is inconceivable that a procedural rule cannot implicate some kind of liberty interest if it is construed by the state that it does so, that another liberty interest by virtue of the rules do, but in this case we have the Lono versus Ariyoshi opinion, that specifically says that this rule does not give rise to any expectation of liberty."
1982.81-1581,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3521.713,3523.367,"May I ask you this question, Mr. Lilly?"
1982.81-1581,2,36229,michael_a_lilly,,3548.358,3549.7,Not federal claim.
1982.81-1581,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3549.7,3551.575,You don't think he would have a federal claim.
1982.81-1581,2,36229,michael_a_lilly,,3555.136,3558.291,"That is what he is claiming, is some kind of personal animosity."
1982.81-1581,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3558.291,3566.66,"Yes, and your position is, there is no constitutional protection to an arbitrary transfer in the sense of just motivated by hatred, personal hatred, or something."
1982.81-1581,2,36229,michael_a_lilly,,3566.66,3572.439,"Yes, Justice Stevens, and also, it was the administrator that made the decision, not the hearing body."
1982.81-1581,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3576.031,3582.106,"Well, I think we have to assume, because the complaint is dismissed on its face, that there was an adequate allegation of bias."
1982.81-1581,2,36229,michael_a_lilly,,3586.044,3593.804,"There is no allegation of bias in the complaint against the decision-maker, Antone Olim, the person who made the decision to transfer, the one who has--"
1982.81-1581,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3593.804,3596.807,"Well, but wasn't it made by a hearing board of several people?"
1982.81-1581,2,36229,michael_a_lilly,,3596.807,3603.49,"--You have a hearing body of four people who make a recommendation to the administrator, who makes the decision."
1982.81-1581,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3607.191,3607.69,I see.
1982.81-1581,2,36229,michael_a_lilly,,3607.69,3608.439,But not--
1982.81-1581,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3608.439,3612.128,"But from your point of view, it would be the same case even if the administrator were biased."
1982.81-1581,2,36229,michael_a_lilly,,3612.128,3612.643,--That's right.
1982.81-1581,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3637.225,3638.429,A form of therapy?
1982.81-1581,2,36229,michael_a_lilly,,3638.429,3651.298,--One of the reasons why prisons traditionally have these kinds of procedures is because they find inmate frustrations and tensions lowered when they have some kind of input.
1982.81-1581,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3663.652,3665.324,Even if it is just kind of a charade?
