1992.91-8199,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.198,"We'll hear argument next in No. 91-8199, Thomas Lee Deal v. the United States."
1992.91-8199,0,21733,dola_j_young,,15.571,17.104,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1992.91-8199,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,65.883,71.808,"It's your position, Ms. Young, that the rule of lenity is required by the Fifth Amendment?"
1992.91-8199,0,21733,dola_j_young,,71.808,78.542,"No, Your Honor, it is required by the rulings of this Court when a statute is ambiguous."
1992.91-8199,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,130.181,134.911,"Ms. Young, if you prevail here what will be the ultimate outcome?"
1992.91-8199,0,21733,dola_j_young,,136.222,138.445,"--Of 105, yes, sir."
1992.91-8199,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,138.445,139.674,--105.
1992.91-8199,0,21733,dola_j_young,,142.225,155.846,"Well, 30 years on the 924(c) counts, plus he received approximately 14 years on the bank robberies which was to run concurrently with 10 years for being a felon in possession of a weapon."
1992.91-8199,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,160.198,166.863,"But the six counts were bank robbery, was it?"
1992.91-8199,0,21733,dola_j_young,,166.863,168.646,"Yes, sir, that was the crime of violence."
1992.91-8199,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,168.646,174.209,"They were different dates and different places, I suppose?"
1992.91-8199,0,21733,dola_j_young,,174.209,174.917,"Yes, sir, they were."
1992.91-8199,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,183.593,200.235,"So if there had just been, if there had just been separate indictments for the six bank robberies, one indictment for each bank robbery, you wouldn't be here, I suppose?"
1992.91-8199,0,21733,dola_j_young,,200.235,206.289,"Yes, Your Honor, we would still be here because looking at the operation of the statute, the statute is in two parts."
1992.91-8199,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,223.119,230.974,"But suppose the, there was a bank robbery by your client and he was indicted and convicted for it?"
1992.91-8199,0,21733,dola_j_young,,230.974,232.206,"Yes, sir."
1992.91-8199,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,232.206,234.797,And similarly for the other five.
1992.91-8199,0,21733,dola_j_young,,240.501,255.82,"No, Your Honor, because the second part of the statute, in the case of his second or subsequent conviction, is a recidivist statute, and that language, in the case of, is linking the second part of the statute to the first, and it's--"
1992.91-8199,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,255.82,258.362,"Well, when would enhancement ever apply?"
1992.91-8199,0,21733,dola_j_young,,258.362,266.466,--When the offense occurs after a previous sentence has become final.
1992.91-8199,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,266.466,271.82,"Well, that's... I thought I was posing that in my last hypothetical."
1992.91-8199,0,21733,dola_j_young,,271.82,279.086,The offense would have to occur after the previous 5-year sentence had become final.
1992.91-8199,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,281.497,283.808,"Oh, after, you mean after he had served the 5-year sentence?"
1992.91-8199,0,21733,dola_j_young,,283.808,284.889,--Yes.
1992.91-8199,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,299.589,303.812,Wouldn't your argument be served going back to Justice White's hypo?
1992.91-8199,0,21733,dola_j_young,,323.274,324.146,Well--
1992.91-8199,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,324.146,327.917,Even on your theory that it's a recidivism statute?
1992.91-8199,0,21733,dola_j_young,,327.917,333.162,"--Well, I think we would have to look at the general policy of recidivist statutes, and that is for--"
1992.91-8199,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,333.162,342.017,"Well, I don't mean to cut you off there, but I just thought on your own argument that in the case that I give he would be subject to the second enhancement."
1992.91-8199,0,21733,dola_j_young,,344.519,354.594,"--The position is that the offense would have to have become final, the offense would have to occur after."
1992.91-8199,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,369.905,370.576,Okay.
1992.91-8199,0,21733,dola_j_young,,398.853,406.67,"Well, we don't know that Congress intended this to be a habitual--"
1992.91-8199,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,406.67,410.524,"We don't know, so we have to look to the text, I assume."
1992.91-8199,0,21733,dola_j_young,,441.232,449.019,"--Well, given that situation we don't know which of the counts would be the second conviction."
1992.91-8199,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,453.45,456.042,"Well, it means second in time, don't you think?"
1992.91-8199,0,21733,dola_j_young,,460.255,467.769,"It could mean second in order or it could mean subsequent, take the meaning of subsequent, which would refer to later in time."
1992.91-8199,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,595.493,601.116,--You say... what meaning is it you attach to the words in the case of?
1992.91-8199,0,21733,dola_j_young,,601.116,602.888,--A legal proceeding.
1992.91-8199,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,602.888,612.125,"Well why, don't we use the phrase in the case of very often just to identify a particular episode that doesn't necessarily have anything to do with a legal proceeding?"
1992.91-8199,0,21733,dola_j_young,,612.125,636.219,"Yes, we do, but as this Court has noted, when a term has more than one meaning and there is a meaning that is applicable in a legal sense, then the legal sense is the one that governs, and that would be the reason for construing in the case of as a legal proceeding."
1992.91-8199,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,636.219,640.292,And what case would you cite for the proposition that you just stated?
1992.91-8199,0,21733,dola_j_young,,640.292,652.5,"That case comes, that comes from the case... I don't have it on the tip of my tongue right now, but there is a case and it is cited in our brief for that proposition."
1992.91-8199,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,656.594,663.297,So you would read the statute as if it said after conviction in a second or subsequent case?
1992.91-8199,0,21733,dola_j_young,,663.297,666.039,--I would--
1992.91-8199,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,666.039,668.72,That's the way you would have us interpret the statute?
1992.91-8199,0,21733,dola_j_young,,668.72,670.803,--I would read it after conviction--
1992.91-8199,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,670.803,673.364,In a second or subsequent case.
1992.91-8199,0,21733,dola_j_young,,673.364,686.892,"--If an offense after conviction, an offense that is sentenced in a proceeding after conviction would receive a 20-year sentence."
1992.91-8199,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,686.892,690.635,"Well, actually you would say after conviction and after the sentence has been served?"
1992.91-8199,0,21733,dola_j_young,,690.635,692.635,Yes.
1992.91-8199,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,692.635,695.317,Yes.
1992.91-8199,0,21733,dola_j_young,,724.756,726.549,"That's correct, Justice Scalia."
1992.91-8199,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,726.549,736.854,"You insist not just that the case be second, but that the criminal, alleged criminal activity upon which the case is based be second."
1992.91-8199,0,21733,dola_j_young,,736.854,737.746,That's correct.
1992.91-8199,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,737.746,754.717,"That's... I mean, I can follow you the first step, that the case has to be second, although I can't see why anyone would want such a disposition, why you would insist on six separate trials instead of one trial in order to get the enhancement."
1992.91-8199,0,21733,dola_j_young,,768.016,772.909,"That's exactly the point, Justice Scalia, that we don't get it from the language."
1992.91-8199,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,808.552,812.836,"Well, it certainly could, I suppose."
1992.91-8199,0,21733,dola_j_young,,838.813,853.982,"That is one possibility, but I think, as this Court has recognized, that a mere possibility, a mere construction is not sufficient to provide a person with notice."
1992.91-8199,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,868.632,877.218,Do you think the conviction word used in this enhancement provision refers to a criminal judgment?
1992.91-8199,0,21733,dola_j_young,,877.218,878.588,"--Yes, sir, I do."
1992.91-8199,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,880.42,882.421,It's not return of the jury verdict?
1992.91-8199,0,21733,dola_j_young,,882.421,883.773,"Not, absolutely not."
1992.91-8199,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,935.876,938.817,How about a finding of guilt plus a sentence?
1992.91-8199,0,21733,dola_j_young,,938.817,942.77,There there would be an indicia of finality.
1992.91-8199,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,942.77,960.373,"Well, then if the judge, on the basis of the jury's verdict, says with respect to the first count, you know, I sentence you to 5 years, why isn't that then final if you agree with the question that I just asked you?"
1992.91-8199,0,21733,dola_j_young,,972.049,980.525,"Then yes, you're correct, then it's final because the sentence has been imposed."
1992.91-8199,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,996.076,1016.288,"Well, to what was your argument about lack of finality addressed, Ms. Young, because I assume from your answers that you have just given that you do not think that a jury verdict of guilt plus a sentence indicates lack of finality?"
1992.91-8199,0,21733,dola_j_young,,1016.288,1017.51,It does not.
1992.91-8199,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1017.51,1023.264,So wherein does the lack of finality occur that you object to?
1992.91-8199,0,21733,dola_j_young,,1023.264,1038.253,"I don't recall which justice it was, but asked me if a conviction would refer to a finding of guilt, and that's when I responded that a conviction would not refer to a simple finding of guilt."
1992.91-8199,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1038.253,1042.325,But a conviction would refer to a finding of guilt plus a sentence?
1992.91-8199,0,21733,dola_j_young,,1042.325,1042.996,Yes.
1992.91-8199,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1042.996,1047.939,"And in this case, Ms. Young, how many judgments were entered?"
1992.91-8199,0,21733,dola_j_young,,1047.939,1049.801,One single judgment.
1992.91-8199,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1049.801,1054.493,"One judgment including, all the sentences on all the counts were incorporated in a single judgment?"
1992.91-8199,0,21733,dola_j_young,,1054.493,1055.124,"Yes, sir."
1992.91-8199,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1055.124,1059.588,"So you say in this case there was one conviction, as you define the term?"
1992.91-8199,0,21733,dola_j_young,,1059.588,1060.537,That's correct.
1992.91-8199,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1062.69,1073.447,But the trial court could have changed all that on the basis of the same jury verdict had he simply entered six judgments?
1992.91-8199,0,21733,dola_j_young,,1073.447,1078.951,"--That would not be proper, Your Honor."
1992.91-8199,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1080.54,1091.118,"Well, should it then depend on whether or not there was one judgment based on six convictions or six different judgments based on six findings of guilt?"
1992.91-8199,0,21733,dola_j_young,,1091.118,1094.29,"--I'm sorry, I did not follow your question."
1992.91-8199,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1094.29,1117.258,"Well, ought the outcome in this case, whether your client is sentenced to 40 years, as you say he should be, or 105, ought it to depend on whether the trial court says I am going to enter six different judgments here because there have been six different findings of guilt by the jury, or if he says there have been six different findings of guilt by the jury but I am going to enter just one judgment?"
1992.91-8199,0,21733,dola_j_young,,1117.258,1129.843,"No, because then that still does not take care of the notice requirement that a defendant would not know when he would be subject to that 20-year sentence."
1992.91-8199,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1185.9,1199.541,"Subsequent offense would be better for your position, wouldn't it, I mean if it had read subsequent offense it would make your argument easier, I assume?"
1992.91-8199,0,21733,dola_j_young,,1199.541,1216.861,"If it had read subsequent offense, I don't think so, because that's the exact structure that the Government is relying on in order to get this 105-year sentence, because the Government says for any subsequent offense then it's 20 years."
1992.91-8199,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1221.175,1226.198,"May I ask you, following up on the Chief Justice's question, what is your experience?"
1992.91-8199,0,21733,dola_j_young,,1233.104,1236.393,It has been my experience one judgment covering the whole case.
1992.91-8199,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1236.393,1244.949,"Isn't your strongest argument that the ambiguity simply in here is in the word, in the referent to the word subsequent?"
1992.91-8199,0,21733,dola_j_young,,1256.117,1256.927,"Yes, sir."
1992.91-8199,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1258.75,1259.43,"Well, but no."
1992.91-8199,0,21733,dola_j_young,,1278.873,1293.991,"--No, because as one of the other justices pointed out, if the person had been incarcerated and escaped and committed an offense, then the 20 years would be applicable in that situation."
1992.91-8199,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1293.991,1297.335,"You have to have at least begun to serve your sentence, is that it?"
1992.91-8199,0,21733,dola_j_young,,1297.335,1306.401,"That's correct, Your Honor, because that puts you on, the imposition of the sentence puts you on notice for any subsequent offenses."
1992.91-8199,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1306.401,1310.171,"Not the imposition of the sentence, the serving of the sentence."
1992.91-8199,0,21733,dola_j_young,,1310.171,1311.083,"Well, correct."
1992.91-8199,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1314.856,1315.745,Immediately.
1992.91-8199,0,21733,dola_j_young,,1325.723,1327.502,--But then the offense has not occurred--
1992.91-8199,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1327.502,1328.844,The offense hasn't occurred yet.
1992.91-8199,0,21733,dola_j_young,,1328.844,1333.536,--Another aspect--
1992.91-8199,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1333.536,1345.364,"Of course that is inconsistent with your own interpretation of the second use of the term conviction, where the statute directs that the sentence not be suspended."
1992.91-8199,0,21733,dola_j_young,,1352.921,1356.163,--You could not suspend--
1992.91-8199,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1356.163,1374.535,"Well, you were arguing that the second use of the word conviction in the statute, which says that the judge shall not place on probation, the court shall not place on probation or suspend the sentence of any person convicted, has bearing on the definition of the word conviction in the statute."
1992.91-8199,0,21733,dola_j_young,,1390.214,1394.488,--That's... I did not say it would require the serving of the sentence.
1992.91-8199,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1402.673,1410.35,"Yes, because you answered an earlier question of mine in which I posed the situation in which the individual is sentenced and immediately escapes."
1992.91-8199,0,21733,dola_j_young,,1419.953,1420.745,"Yes, sir, I did."
1992.91-8199,1,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,1592.557,1603.124,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1992.91-8199,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1628.531,1630.132,What do you think a conviction is?
1992.91-8199,1,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,1630.132,1637.007,"--A conviction is a finding of guilt by a court or jury, Justice White."
1992.91-8199,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1637.007,1637.715,"Or jury, you think."
1992.91-8199,1,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,1637.715,1638.616,Yes.
1992.91-8199,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1638.616,1643.392,So that the conviction happens when the jury verdict is returned?
1992.91-8199,1,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,1643.392,1645.602,"That is right, or when a plea of guilty is entered."
1992.91-8199,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1645.602,1650.035,You don't have to enter a judgment on it before there is a conviction?
1992.91-8199,1,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,1650.035,1654.108,Not as the word is used in context in this case.
1992.91-8199,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1654.108,1656.738,"Well, what did we say in Dickerson?"
1992.91-8199,1,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,1656.738,1665.814,"In Dickerson the Court was dealing with section 922(g), which is part of the same chapter where section 924(c) is now."
1992.91-8199,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1675.782,1686.008,"Well, and we said conviction meant it didn't occur with the entry of the plea, but only after the sentence and judgment were imposed."
1992.91-8199,1,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,1686.008,1692.353,"--With all respect, Justice O'Connor, that is in fact not what the Court said."
1992.91-8199,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1704.95,1713.436,"Well, even if you say the conviction occurs with the return of the jury verdict, there was only one conviction here."
1992.91-8199,1,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,1729.876,1730.687,--No.
1992.91-8199,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1750.799,1755.013,"Yes, but it wasn't a second finding, was it?"
1992.91-8199,1,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,1755.013,1758.326,"Well, the word second in this--"
1992.91-8199,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1758.326,1760.567,So you rely on second rather than subsequent?
1992.91-8199,1,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,1760.567,1765.82,"--No, we think that each of the two terms has a distinct meaning in the statute, Justice White."
1992.91-8199,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1789.034,1808.629,"So the jury must have, the jury couldn't have considered all counts at the same time, so at least they had to consider them separately and so their finding of guilt on each, for each bank robbery, they were... some were later and some were earlier."
1992.91-8199,1,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,1808.629,1819.755,"The significant point is that they made seven different findings of guilt under section 924(c), and that is all that the statutory language calls for in this case, Justice White."
1992.91-8199,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1844.671,1856.879,"Why wouldn't that be clear if the enhancement were the same in each instance, but in this case the enhancement is 4 times for the second or subsequent what it is in the first, which indicates that it's something other than just a dangerous person statute, isn't it?"
1992.91-8199,1,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,1856.879,1866.085,"That is not right, Justice Souter, because the first sentence of the statute makes clear that what Congress is doing in the statute is two things."
1992.91-8199,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1881.957,1886.408,"Well, when you get into comparative danger you are getting into recidivism, aren't you?"
1992.91-8199,1,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,1889.341,1893.785,"--That is not necessarily so as a general matter, Justice Souter."
1992.91-8199,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1963.75,1973.005,"Mr. Estrada, is Ms. Young correct when she told us that from 1968 to 1987 the prosecutors did not read the statute this way?"
1992.91-8199,1,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,1973.005,1983.581,That is not right in the sense that the issue did not come up in a litigated case until 1987.
1992.91-8199,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1983.581,1989.795,You mean in all those years there were no charges where the defendant had robbed more than one bank?
1992.91-8199,1,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,1989.795,1992.096,The issue wouldn't be really--
1992.91-8199,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1992.096,2000.464,"I mean, obviously it wasn't appealed on this issue if the practice was always to do as she says the right reading of the statute is."
1992.91-8199,1,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,2004.385,2016.243,"--I don't know, and I think that the reason it did not come up is because until the mid eighties the penalties for a first and/or second were quite close to one another."
1992.91-8199,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2020.026,2022.347,But you're telling me you really don't know what the practice was?
1992.91-8199,1,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,2022.347,2023.168,--That's correct.
1992.91-8199,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2023.168,2028.24,But she is correct that it wasn't litigated until 1987?
1992.91-8199,1,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,2028.24,2038.428,"It was not... the first court of appeals case dealing with the issue was Rawlings coming from the circuit in Florida, the--"
1992.91-8199,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2038.428,2040.61,Eleventh Circuit.
1992.91-8199,1,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,2040.61,2041.0,--Right.
1992.91-8199,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2041.0,2042.72,In 1987.
1992.91-8199,1,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,2042.72,2043.912,In 1987.
1992.91-8199,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2043.912,2046.253,19 years after the statute had been passed.
1992.91-8199,1,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,2046.253,2046.964,19 years.
1992.91-8199,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2049.445,2050.136,Rather strange.
1992.91-8199,1,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,2050.136,2056.909,--the important point is that the penalty ranges with the first few years were overlapping.
1992.91-8199,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2056.909,2063.112,Were not sufficient to justify a defendant having an interest in appealing if he wanted to challenge this statute.
1992.91-8199,1,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,2063.112,2067.235,"Well, there were two different issues, Justice Stevens."
1992.91-8199,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2094.355,2096.105,When was that?
1992.91-8199,1,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,2098.828,2101.588,--I think they did that in the early eighties.
1992.91-8199,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2101.588,2102.58,Okay.
1992.91-8199,1,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,2102.58,2103.989,Justice Scalia.
1992.91-8199,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2104.88,2107.302,I just wanted to get the date.
1992.91-8199,1,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,2108.374,2126.586,"And following that the range was 5 under the first clause and 10 under the next, so it was not the type of issue that would be actively litigated because even though it obviously mattered it didn't matter as much as it does now."
1992.91-8199,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2127.575,2133.799,You mean you didn't think a defendant would appeal a 10-year enhancement but he would appeal a 30-year enhancement?
1992.91-8199,1,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,2135.071,2143.706,"--Well, I think that he is more likely to take issue with the plain meaning of the statute if more turns on it than not."
1992.91-8199,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2234.685,2256.851,"I suppose, Mr. Estrada, that if a person robs a single bank on a single day and takes both money and Government securities as part of the hold up and there are two counts, that the consecutive sentence rule or the enhanced sentence rule would apply here?"
1992.91-8199,1,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,2256.851,2273.761,"It is generally the case, Justice Kennedy, that if a person is guilty of two crimes of violence that he does as part of the same episode, it is true that two 924(c) crimes could be charged."
1992.91-8199,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2289.253,2290.893,"Well, suppose there were two counts charged."
1992.91-8199,1,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,2300.99,2303.461,"I am answering yes to your question, Justice Kennedy."
1992.91-8199,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2326.977,2328.406,Even though it's really one episode.
1992.91-8199,1,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,2328.406,2329.287,That is right.
1992.91-8199,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2446.644,2452.697,"Mr. Estrada, do you take the position that there is no ambiguity whatever in this statute?"
1992.91-8199,1,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,2452.697,2459.563,"Well, there is none as to the issue raised in this case, Your Honor."
1992.91-8199,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2462.154,2463.476,"Well, I'm asking you about the statute."
1992.91-8199,1,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,2467.867,2470.899,--None as used in this statute.
1992.91-8199,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2488.051,2491.253,How about the term in the case of a second or subsequent?
1992.91-8199,1,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,2491.253,2495.748,--There is no ambiguity whatever in those words.
1992.91-8199,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2592.77,2594.199,How about the word subsequent?
1992.91-8199,1,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,2594.199,2603.045,"Again, I think it is possible to read the word subsequent in isolation to have more than one meaning."
1992.91-8199,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2650.256,2652.79,"Excuse me, after the first in time?"
1992.91-8199,1,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,2660.054,2663.847,"--No, I think it can mean in addition to the first."
1992.91-8199,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2756.225,2759.838,I assume that would only be a problem for the second one.
1992.91-8199,1,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,2761.541,2765.962,"--Well, I think it's a problem for any of them, Justice Scalia."
1992.91-8199,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2765.962,2771.927,"Well, you would have two before."
1992.91-8199,1,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,2775.539,2779.392,Certainly.
1992.91-8199,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2894.528,2896.128,--May I just ask one more question?
1992.91-8199,1,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,2902.172,2920.003,"I cannot agree with that, Justice Stevens, for the reason that we have taken the view that if one were to read the word conviction to mean a judgment the statute would make no sense."
1992.91-8199,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2931.23,2939.077,"Well, you would know there have to be at least two judgments, because it has talked about a second or subsequent conviction or judgment."
1992.91-8199,1,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,2944.821,2956.509,"On that theory, and if that were all the Court said, Justice Stevens, the judgment would be vacated and sent back to the district court where we would move to sever the sentences."
1992.91-8199,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2956.509,2962.282,"But you would agree there would have to be some, at least have to be sent back to the district?"
1992.91-8199,1,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,2962.282,2963.751,"There would have, on that reading--"
1992.91-8199,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2963.751,2967.364,You'd have to do that in every case where the district judge made a mistake of entering just one judgment.
1992.91-8199,1,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,2967.364,2968.774,--That's correct.
1992.91-8199,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2968.774,2971.729,Which is what normally happens at the end of criminal trials.
1992.91-8199,1,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,2971.729,2981.403,"Well, that is what does normally happen at the end of what happens in the district court."
1992.91-8199,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2981.403,2992.43,"One piece of paper entitled judgment, I suppose, could, you could say that that really is several judgments because he has entered judgment on several counts."
1992.91-8199,1,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,2992.43,3000.476,"That is right, Justice White, and I think the, how that is treated tends to vary from district to district."
1992.91-8199,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3035.719,3051.01,"Because on your, if I recall, your argument is that judgment can never mean final judgment here because that doesn't occur until after the sentencing and therefore you would have the anomaly of having an addition to the sentence after the sentencing was complete and judgment had been entered."
1992.91-8199,1,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,3051.01,3051.448,Right.
1992.91-8199,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3084.26,3092.748,Certainly the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure contemplate that the judgment will occur after the sentence.
1992.91-8199,1,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,3092.748,3093.276,That is right.
1992.91-8199,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3102.443,3104.205,"Thank you, Mr. Estrada."
1992.91-8199,2,21733,dola_j_young,,3106.325,3119.643,I would begin by taking issue with Mr. Estrada's position that conviction means a finding of guilt.
1992.91-8199,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3157.299,3161.19,"What you had there, was it not, Ms. Young, was a plea of guilty?"
1992.91-8199,2,21733,dola_j_young,,3167.124,3167.755,"Yes, sir."
1992.91-8199,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3167.755,3171.738,And the Court said that's enough to amount to a conviction?
1992.91-8199,2,21733,dola_j_young,,3171.738,3172.449,"Yes, sir."
1992.91-8199,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3177.222,3181.663,But there was not any finding of guilt in the case.
1992.91-8199,2,21733,dola_j_young,,3181.663,3182.635,"Well, that's true."
1992.91-8199,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3190.259,3204.948,"Well, I guess Dickerson does point in the direction that supports Mr. Estrada more than it supports your view that there has to be a sentence actually imposed."
1992.91-8199,2,21733,dola_j_young,,3204.948,3212.184,"--It does not require that sentence has to be actually imposed, you are correct, Justice O'Connor."
1992.91-8199,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3212.184,3212.945,Right.
1992.91-8199,2,21733,dola_j_young,,3212.945,3223.361,"However, I think that it does not support Mr. Estrada's position that simply a finding of guilt is sufficient for a conviction."
1992.91-8199,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3237.59,3251.7,"Well, we do have here ultimately a determination by the judge on each count that there is guilt and the imposition of a sentence on each count."
1992.91-8199,2,21733,dola_j_young,,3253.142,3256.605,"This was a jury trial, and the jury found Mr. Deal guilty on each count."
1992.91-8199,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3256.605,3261.747,"Yes, but then the judge followed through and imposed a sentence separately on each count."
1992.91-8199,2,21733,dola_j_young,,3261.747,3262.248,That's correct.
1992.91-8199,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3263.669,3274.186,So for your purposes we just have to come to grips with any ambiguity perhaps in the case of any second or subsequent--
1992.91-8199,2,21733,dola_j_young,,3274.186,3274.907,That's correct.
1992.91-8199,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3274.907,3276.317,--the meaning of that language.
1992.91-8199,2,21733,dola_j_young,,3276.317,3277.188,"Yes, Your Honor."
1992.91-8199,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3349.595,3350.556,"Thank you, Ms. Young."
