1969.655,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,13.496,"The next case for argument is Number 655, Mulloy against the United States."
1969.655,0,40558,robert_allen_sedler,,14.938,16.346,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1969.655,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,156.71,164.369,Do you think it can be -- this record -- what reading for the board's action?
1969.655,0,40558,robert_allen_sedler,,164.369,165.279,"No, Your Honor."
1969.655,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,343.241,352.494,Does that necessarily or possibly rest on an assumption that they haven't read it a little bit sooner?
1969.655,0,40558,robert_allen_sedler,,352.494,361.099,"They so stated at the trial, there were three -- there were three members present, Your Honor at the November 9th hearing."
1969.655,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,756.206,766.575,"Where he -- he had pitched his claim for non-draft status for considerable period on an occupational deferment, hadn't he?"
1969.655,0,40558,robert_allen_sedler,,766.575,772.749,He had an occupational deferment until May of 1967.
1969.655,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,857.979,862.027,"Now, you have been rather severe on the draft board people and their lack of grasp of --"
1969.655,0,40558,robert_allen_sedler,,862.027,862.827,"Yes indeed, Your Honor."
1969.655,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,862.827,875.011,Lack of grasp of what they were supposed to be doing but wasn't it rather late for this man to discover himself what a conscientious objector was in circumstances?
1969.655,0,40558,robert_allen_sedler,,875.011,883.467,"Well, I want to make clear Your Honor that this is a pre-induction case, that there was no outstanding order for induction."
1969.655,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,883.682,885.103,There was a classification though?
1969.655,0,40558,robert_allen_sedler,,885.103,885.492,Pardon?
1969.655,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,885.492,886.533,There was a classification?
1969.655,0,40558,robert_allen_sedler,,886.533,887.197,"Yes, You're Honor."
1969.655,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,887.197,891.652,"So, he knew that he was subject to call?"
1969.655,0,40558,robert_allen_sedler,,891.652,896.353,"Well, this, I think, is true of any registrant in class I-A."
1969.655,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,912.009,918.654,"Well, I'm just relating this to your argument that you offered it hadn't occurred to me until you offered it."
1969.655,0,40558,robert_allen_sedler,,942.41,946.641,"Well, it wouldn't have -- I think I have two answers to that, Your Honor."
1969.655,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1063.018,1077.751,"Isn't the issue of law in this case very narrow, namely, what does it take to trigger a consideration of a reopening of a classification."
1969.655,0,40558,robert_allen_sedler,,1077.751,1078.3,"Exactly, You're Honor."
1969.655,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1078.3,1079.954,You got all there is to this case.
1969.655,0,40558,robert_allen_sedler,,1079.954,1082.365,That is the -- that is what I called the first issue.
1969.655,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1082.365,1105.007,"You got the Second Circuit or some other Circuits, principally the second saying all you got to do is to show a prima facie case on paper and you got other Circuits including this one saying, “No, there's more discretion in the board didn't ask even though its prima facie showing on paper that they didn't like to do some kind of an evaluation of it."
1969.655,0,40558,robert_allen_sedler,,1105.007,1109.813,I would submit Your Honor that with regard to pre-induction --
1969.655,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1109.813,1111.201,Have I so stated the issue correctly?
1969.655,0,40558,robert_allen_sedler,,1111.201,1116.991,I think you stated -- I think that's -- I think it's a perfectly correct statement of the first issue.
1969.655,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1258.597,1274.782,"But now let's say, according to -- as I understand it then, you already said the board is without discretion if they are presented to at allegations that if true would entitle the registrant to a new or different classification."
1969.655,0,40558,robert_allen_sedler,,1274.782,1275.118,That is --
1969.655,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1275.118,1275.829,Would that be right?
1969.655,0,40558,robert_allen_sedler,,1281.391,1281.871,Assuming its --
1969.655,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1281.871,1286.579,"Personal appearance or reopening of personal appearance set on appeal is a matter of months, I suppose all know it?"
1969.655,0,40558,robert_allen_sedler,,1286.579,1288.023,"Exactly, and you know --"
1969.655,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1288.023,1303.89,"So, I suppose the registrant could say I am now a member of the United States Senate even though that word demonstrably false and therefore I ask her reclassification as member of the United States Senate."
1969.655,0,40558,robert_allen_sedler,,1339.738,1356.733,"Well, it wont do him any good until he reach 26 because under 1631.7 (a) of the regulations, if his number come up, he is liable and he is called notwithstanding that he reaches 26."
1969.655,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1358.138,1361.47,"Well, I suppose you went long enough, he could reach 46, if he had not --"
1969.655,0,40558,robert_allen_sedler,,1361.47,1372.902,"There are only a limited number of classifications but if I may suggest, I was going to answer Your Honors question, “No, because I don't want to get into a box of advocating something ridiculous.”"
1969.655,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1479.438,1484.543,"Well, I suppose you can, so long as there's an allegation, does this have to be made under oath?"
1969.655,0,40558,robert_allen_sedler,,1484.543,1490.924,"I believe that it is provided that all, there are severe penalties for making false statements to the board."
1969.655,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1505.01,1507.72,Does it have to be made under oath?
1969.655,0,40558,robert_allen_sedler,,1510.25,1510.957,I believe --
1969.655,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1510.957,1512.351,"You just write him a letter, don't you?"
1969.655,0,40558,robert_allen_sedler,,1512.351,1514.198,"Well, true, the board held --"
1969.655,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1514.198,1515.643,Or maybe out of form provided the board?
1969.655,0,40558,robert_allen_sedler,,1515.643,1516.883,But the board couldn't provide.
1969.655,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1537.444,1538.599,Thank you counsel.
1969.655,1,29797,joseph_j_connolly,,1541.038,1544.585,Mr. Chief Justice and May it please the Court.
1969.655,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1988.66,1997.135,Would you agree Mr. Connolly with your adversary that the circuits are at odds on what the standard for reopening is?
1969.655,1,29797,joseph_j_connolly,,1997.135,2001.248,"There is some disagreement among the circuits, Mr. Justice, on this."
1969.655,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2002.783,2006.611,"Second Circuit is partly against these decisions, isn't it?"
1969.655,1,29797,joseph_j_connolly,,2006.611,2007.406,"Yes, it is."
1969.655,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2125.262,2141.629,"But you said the board finds by reliable means that -- that what he says is not true or they find that they think it's not true, what kind or what sort of reliable means are they going to find out about this?"
1969.655,1,29797,joseph_j_connolly,,2148.083,2148.568,That's right because --
1969.655,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2148.568,2150.61,It's not an adversary proposition.
1969.655,1,29797,joseph_j_connolly,,2150.61,2153.78,"Well, they could write a letter."
1969.655,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2194.653,2200.861,Do Selective Service Boards actually write letters to these --
1969.655,1,29797,joseph_j_connolly,,2200.861,2201.336,I don't know.
1969.655,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2214.264,2224.435,"The usual practice, I suppose, is to have the registrant himself, when he asked for a classification is supply the documentary support for it, isn't that the basic --"
1969.655,1,29797,joseph_j_connolly,,2224.435,2231.931,That's usually done but I believe that there is some practice of verifying with him.
1969.655,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2245.241,2247.794,But nothing like that was done in this case?
1969.655,1,29797,joseph_j_connolly,,2247.794,2248.922,"No, sir."
1969.655,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2249.387,2256.928,But how long would it take you or I to find out whether the man was a conscientious objector?
1969.655,1,29797,joseph_j_connolly,,2256.928,2264.312,"It depends on the type of claims that he makes to support his claim for being a conscientious objector, Mr. Justice Marshall."
1969.655,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2264.312,2269.687,You think you could do it in 10 minutes?
1969.655,1,29797,joseph_j_connolly,,2269.687,2269.852,If --
1969.655,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2269.852,2272.318,In order to satisfy your own conscience --
1969.655,1,29797,joseph_j_connolly,,2272.318,2291.649,"If I were faced with a fully ripened claim of conscientious objection which appeared to be based upon some long standing belief, some basis in -- at the individuals -- in the registrant's religious doctrines."
1969.655,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2303.437,2304.043,Could it take you -
1969.655,1,29797,joseph_j_connolly,,2304.043,2306.704,"No, I don't think I could do that in 10 minutes, Mr. Justice."
1969.655,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2306.704,2307.243,Could it take you?
1969.655,1,29797,joseph_j_connolly,,2307.243,2308.951,But that's not the case here.
1969.655,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2308.951,2314.136,Could it take as long as the Second Circuit took to decide Seager?
1969.655,1,29797,joseph_j_connolly,,2314.136,2315.039,Sir?
1969.655,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2315.039,2320.71,Could it take you as long as it took the Second Circuit to decide Seager?
1969.655,1,29797,joseph_j_connolly,,2320.71,2325.939,"I am not sure -- I don't know the full, the fact to which you refer."
1969.655,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2325.939,2327.121,The Seager case.
1969.655,1,29797,joseph_j_connolly,,2327.121,2327.685,Seager case.
1969.655,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2327.685,2328.627,Yeah.
1969.655,1,29797,joseph_j_connolly,,2328.627,2330.176,I don't know how long it took them to resolve --
1969.655,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2330.176,2341.573,"Where it could take that long – I don't find a little merit in this ten minute hearing or something is serious as this is, admittedly serious."
1969.655,1,29797,joseph_j_connolly,,2341.573,2345.338,"Mr. Justice, well, I intend to get to in a few minutes --"
1969.655,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2345.338,2346.047,"Oh, I am sorry."
1969.655,1,29797,joseph_j_connolly,,2347.062,2354.66,-- is the phrasing of what issue was before the Local Selective Service Board in this case and what inquiry it was making.
1969.655,2,40558,robert_allen_sedler,,3524.267,3526.666,You're Honor.
1969.655,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3862.993,3865.274,"Thank you, Mr. Sedler."
