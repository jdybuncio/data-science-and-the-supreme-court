1992.91-1657,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,13.24,"We'll hear argument now in No. 91-1657, Charlene Leatherman v. Tarrant County Narcotics Intelligence and Coordination Unit."
1992.91-1657,0,39314,richard_gladden,,14.532,20.626,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1992.91-1657,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,260.601,263.894,Rule 20(a) of the Rules of Civil Procedure?
1992.91-1657,0,39314,richard_gladden,,263.894,265.424,"Yes, Chief Justice."
1992.91-1657,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,265.424,266.686,What does that provide?
1992.91-1657,0,39314,richard_gladden,,266.686,272.35,"Chief Justice, if I recollect, it says that you have a common transaction in question element."
1992.91-1657,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,289.761,293.755,This was a motion to--
1992.91-1657,0,39314,richard_gladden,,293.755,296.967,"Well, it was... we just amended the complaint."
1992.91-1657,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,503.563,517.571,"--Well, is there some indication or do you believe, I... do you think the district judge would have allowed you the discovery that he previously didn't allow you if he had denied the motion to dismiss?"
1992.91-1657,0,39314,richard_gladden,,517.571,521.384,I have no way of knowing.
1992.91-1657,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,521.384,522.505,Because--
1992.91-1657,0,39314,richard_gladden,,522.505,523.404,That would be just speculation.
1992.91-1657,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,523.404,534.791,"--You know, one of the things you're telling us about is how you couldn't get any information through discovery, and I'm wondering how that is related to the heightened pleading requirement."
1992.91-1657,0,39314,richard_gladden,,534.791,552.462,"Well, Your Honor, I think the court denied the discovery, and it's my impression that he denied the discovery on the basis that the heightened pleading requirement foreclosed the lawsuit proceeding further to discovery because under a heightened pleading requirement, you wouldn't be allowed discovery unless you could get through a motion to dismiss."
1992.91-1657,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,552.462,562.871,"So, then perhaps your answer to my question should be yes, that had the district court denied the motion to dismiss, it would have been more lenient about allowing discovery."
1992.91-1657,0,39314,richard_gladden,,562.871,563.471,I certainly think so.
1992.91-1657,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,727.028,734.284,How about a heightened pleading rule where you're dealing with individuals who will claim qualified immunity?
1992.91-1657,0,39314,richard_gladden,,734.284,750.924,"Well, I don't think that... first of all, I don't think that issue is presented to the Court, but I would take the position in Anderson v. Creighton, Justice Scalia noted that when you do have issues of fact involved, that you can have discovery limited to the fact issue involved go forward."
1992.91-1657,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,753.415,755.869,"Well, who wrote the opinion in Anderson?"
1992.91-1657,0,39314,richard_gladden,,756.277,756.528,No.
1992.91-1657,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,757.309,758.618,Justice Scalia.
1992.91-1657,0,39314,richard_gladden,,767.216,785.417,"I think Anderson would suggest that qualified immunity or not would... there is no need for a heightened pleading requirement or it would be inconsistent to apply a heightened pleading requirement at the same time that you said before that you could allow discovery to go forward where qualified immunity has been raised, only limited to the specific issue."
1992.91-1657,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,792.352,797.304,"So, the discovery in a case would be only limited to facts bearing on qualified immunity."
1992.91-1657,0,39314,richard_gladden,,797.304,801.408,"In the district courts... well, now, for local governmental entities, they don't--"
1992.91-1657,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,801.408,802.019,No.
1992.91-1657,0,39314,richard_gladden,,803.679,803.899,--Okay.
1992.91-1657,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,804.35,808.183,"--that, I meant one where there are individuals involved who can claim qualified--"
1992.91-1657,0,39314,richard_gladden,,808.183,808.802,"Oh, certainly."
1992.91-1657,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,814.485,819.339,"--Now, I take it... maybe I'm wrong."
1992.91-1657,0,39314,richard_gladden,,823.331,824.182,That's correct.
1992.91-1657,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,841.663,848.238,Is the municipality's claim here just characterized as a defense?
1992.91-1657,0,39314,richard_gladden,,848.238,854.152,It's their position that the heightened pleading requirement is a substantive form of immunity.
1992.91-1657,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,914.121,943.091,"Mr. Gladden, can I ask you, is there... what in the Federal rules, if anything... and if your theory is adopted... would prevent a plaintiff routinely, whenever there has been any malfeasance on the part of a police officer, for example, to file a lawsuit claiming that it is a policy of the city?"
1992.91-1657,0,39314,richard_gladden,,950.233,951.074,I think there's--
1992.91-1657,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,951.074,961.052,"And you just file a complaint saying this is a policy of the city and then it can't be dismissed on the pleadings, so you get to the summary judgment stage."
1992.91-1657,0,39314,richard_gladden,,974.21,975.121,"--Okay, well--"
1992.91-1657,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,975.121,975.402,What stops it?
1992.91-1657,0,39314,richard_gladden,,975.402,975.882,--Yes.
1992.91-1657,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,987.26,991.62,"Yes, but that only applies to the facts that are asserted in the complaint, doesn't it?"
1992.91-1657,0,39314,richard_gladden,,991.62,998.876,"Well, it doesn't say that they have to plead the facts, but it says they do have an obligation to make a reasonable investigation into the facts."
1992.91-1657,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,999.416,1001.948,I assume that means the facts pleaded.
1992.91-1657,0,39314,richard_gladden,,1001.948,1004.71,"--Well, not necessarily."
1992.91-1657,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1016.999,1019.159,Do you have to find something in that reasonable investigation?
1992.91-1657,0,39314,richard_gladden,,1026.506,1036.42,"--I don't think you would necessarily have to find something, but you'd have to have good reason to believe that discovery would bring forth factual specifics to support your claim."
1992.91-1657,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1043.155,1044.925,You don't want to keep attributing this to me.
1992.91-1657,0,39314,richard_gladden,,1046.788,1047.128,--Okay.
1992.91-1657,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1047.128,1048.407,I don't always speak for the whole Court.
1992.91-1657,0,39314,richard_gladden,,1048.407,1049.37,"Yes, I understand."
1992.91-1657,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1049.37,1050.739,Often... I often don't.
1992.91-1657,0,39314,richard_gladden,,1050.739,1062.498,"But under 12(b)(6), general allegations, unlike a summary judgment motion... under 12(b)(6) general allegations are presumed to have particular facts supporting them."
1992.91-1657,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1093.178,1106.268,What would the significance under rule 11 be in a case in which the plaintiff did all the prefiling investigation he could do and just couldn't find out anything?
1992.91-1657,0,39314,richard_gladden,,1132.885,1133.386,I don't think so.
1992.91-1657,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1188.34,1196.765,"What was the basis for the knowledge, information, or belief in this case that this was a municipal policy?"
1992.91-1657,0,39314,richard_gladden,,1196.765,1201.549,"It had been my experience... mostly a lot of rumors, of course."
1992.91-1657,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1223.964,1225.556,That doesn't show a policy.
1992.91-1657,0,39314,richard_gladden,,1227.306,1231.439,"Well, of course, there was a statement that was made to the plaintiff in that case, Mrs. Leatherman, by one of the officers."
1992.91-1657,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1318.216,1335.34,"--So, in any case, in theory you could win this case and still leave open the question as to whether the... an allegation of unreasonable conduct against one officer in one incident would be sufficient under rule--"
1992.91-1657,0,39314,richard_gladden,,1335.34,1343.345,"Yes, but I think for future plaintiffs that have to file these cases, it's going to excruciating for them to determine how the Court has ruled and what's going to be specific enough or particular enough."
1992.91-1657,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1365.13,1386.972,"--Counsel, did you allege in the complaint a policy of the city to... or the county to always shoot dogs, or was the allegation really a failure to train?"
1992.91-1657,0,39314,richard_gladden,,1386.972,1393.107,It was... our allegation was more or less loosely patterned on Tennessee v. Garner.
1992.91-1657,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1393.107,1396.719,I read it as a failure to train allegation--
1992.91-1657,0,39314,richard_gladden,,1396.719,1396.909,It was a failure to train.
1992.91-1657,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1397.848,1399.761,--not a municipal policy allegation.
1992.91-1657,0,39314,richard_gladden,,1399.761,1400.78,--Okay.
1992.91-1657,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1410.658,1419.324,"I think that's sort of a strange way to plead a policy, but in any event, I wanted to clarify what it was you've alleged."
1992.91-1657,0,39314,richard_gladden,,1419.324,1420.575,Okay.
1992.91-1657,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1453.836,1455.258,Yes.
1992.91-1657,0,39314,richard_gladden,,1459.822,1466.334,"Yes, that's correct, as well as an allegation of who the policymaker was and causation and under color of law."
1992.91-1657,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1466.334,1476.2,And the court below alternatively ruled for the defendants on a summary judgment motion?
1992.91-1657,0,39314,richard_gladden,,1476.2,1477.35,The district court did.
1992.91-1657,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1477.35,1478.301,The district court did.
1992.91-1657,0,39314,richard_gladden,,1478.301,1479.493,"Yes, the district court did."
1992.91-1657,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1479.493,1481.984,And the court of appeals did not address that.
1992.91-1657,0,39314,richard_gladden,,1481.984,1482.966,That's correct.
1992.91-1657,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1482.966,1488.92,And the court of appeals did not address the collateral estoppel question.
1992.91-1657,0,39314,richard_gladden,,1488.92,1490.019,No.
1992.91-1657,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1492.453,1495.483,"So, those would be open in any event."
1992.91-1657,0,39314,richard_gladden,,1495.483,1496.935,"I believe so, certainly."
1992.91-1657,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1540.673,1544.397,"There's no issue before this Court about collateral estoppel, is there?"
1992.91-1657,0,39314,richard_gladden,,1544.397,1546.617,"--Well, I believe it was raised in terms of mootness."
1992.91-1657,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1571.554,1573.134,"Yes, very well, Mr. Gladden."
1992.91-1657,1,17978,brett_a_ringle,,1574.245,1587.934,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1992.91-1657,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1746.376,1755.113,"Mr. Ringle, this is a fairly elaborate heightened pleading requirement that you're suggesting."
1992.91-1657,1,17978,brett_a_ringle,,1793.937,1799.791,"First, rule 8 has been represented not in the terms that it's written."
1992.91-1657,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1854.818,1858.732,"Well, did the court of appeals suggest that the complaint was deficient under rule 8?"
1992.91-1657,1,17978,brett_a_ringle,,1862.515,1864.516,The court did not address that question.
1992.91-1657,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1866.168,1871.751,"So, I think we take the case on the assumption that it's the heightened pleading requirement that's the defect in the pleading."
1992.91-1657,1,17978,brett_a_ringle,,1871.751,1873.16,"--Yes, that's correct."
1992.91-1657,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1939.976,1954.135,"Well, we would really be opening a big door if we bought that argument because every defendant in the country would be here saying that we have a right not to be held liable just on an allegation of negligence."
1992.91-1657,1,17978,brett_a_ringle,,1974.057,1981.752,"There is no question that this is not and could not be an across-the-board rule, nor do I suggest that it should be."
1992.91-1657,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1983.284,1999.902,"Why is your client, which is a municipal corporation, more entitled to a heightened pleading requirement than a railroad such as we heard this morning... a heightened pleading requirement at a crossing accident?"
1992.91-1657,1,17978,brett_a_ringle,,1999.902,2005.797,--I assure you I won't suggest that the pattern requirement I'm suggesting has anything to do with RICO as an analog either.
1992.91-1657,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2035.176,2037.61,Are you talking about the municipality has immunity from suit?
1992.91-1657,1,17978,brett_a_ringle,,2037.61,2039.78,--The Puerto Rico Aqueduct case--
1992.91-1657,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2039.78,2042.983,"No, but we don't have a State here or a territory."
1992.91-1657,1,17978,brett_a_ringle,,2042.983,2043.821,"--No, that's correct."
1992.91-1657,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2043.821,2045.304,What is the immunity you're referring to?
1992.91-1657,1,17978,brett_a_ringle,,2045.304,2049.505,The immunity is the immunity from respondeat superior liability.
1992.91-1657,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2049.505,2049.826,Oh.
1992.91-1657,1,17978,brett_a_ringle,,2049.826,2054.44,That was an immunity which I think was recognized at the common law.
1992.91-1657,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2063.757,2066.609,"But they're not suing on a respondeat superior theory, are they?"
1992.91-1657,1,17978,brett_a_ringle,,2066.609,2068.902,"Well, that is our problem."
1992.91-1657,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2073.594,2077.748,We're back to whether the complaint states a cause of action now without a heightened pleading requirement.
1992.91-1657,1,17978,brett_a_ringle,,2088.533,2111.128,"--That's correct, and this is the perfect example of why that heightened pleading is necessary because if there isn't a heightened pleading requirement, we get what we have in this case, a case asserting allegedly unconstitutional activities by police officers without the barest determination or factual support that it is pursuant to a policy."
1992.91-1657,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2111.128,2113.041,"Well, how many officers were involved?"
1992.91-1657,1,17978,brett_a_ringle,,2113.041,2120.004,"Well, there were two officers perhaps who were involved in the shooting of the dogs."
1992.91-1657,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2120.004,2122.696,And how many were sitting on the lawn afterwards?
1992.91-1657,1,17978,brett_a_ringle,,2122.696,2124.839,That I do not know.
1992.91-1657,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2136.456,2137.876,Weren't other officers present?
1992.91-1657,1,17978,brett_a_ringle,,2137.876,2140.049,Certainly other officers were present.
1992.91-1657,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2140.049,2143.211,How many officers were present in the two combined incidents?
1992.91-1657,1,17978,brett_a_ringle,,2143.211,2144.962,"I don't know the answer to that, Your Honor."
1992.91-1657,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2144.962,2146.802,How big is this entire police force?
1992.91-1657,1,17978,brett_a_ringle,,2146.802,2148.935,"Well, they are both small police forces."
1992.91-1657,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2149.834,2152.396,Maybe we have 75 percent of the police force involved?
1992.91-1657,1,17978,brett_a_ringle,,2152.396,2153.858,"--No, not in either situation."
1992.91-1657,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2161.812,2162.764,Some inference of policy.
1992.91-1657,1,17978,brett_a_ringle,,2162.764,2163.695,Absolutely.
1992.91-1657,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2164.504,2166.236,How large did you say the police force is?
1992.91-1657,1,17978,brett_a_ringle,,2166.236,2170.757,--I don't know how large the police force in these two municipalities are.
1992.91-1657,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2175.98,2176.861,How big are they?
1992.91-1657,1,17978,brett_a_ringle,,2176.861,2178.433,I don't know--
1992.91-1657,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2178.433,2179.043,You don't know.
1992.91-1657,1,17978,brett_a_ringle,,2179.043,2179.814,--the population of--
1992.91-1657,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2179.814,2181.166,"100,000 or 5,000?"
1992.91-1657,1,17978,brett_a_ringle,,2181.166,2182.715,"--Grapevine is over 100,000."
1992.91-1657,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2182.715,2194.363,You claim that something more was necessary to state a cause of action than was stated in the amended complaint.
1992.91-1657,1,17978,brett_a_ringle,,2194.363,2195.464,"Yes, I do, Your Honor."
1992.91-1657,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2195.464,2202.03,And you say the amended complaint did not allege a failure in training?
1992.91-1657,1,17978,brett_a_ringle,,2202.03,2205.891,It only stated that there was a failure to train.
1992.91-1657,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2207.163,2223.492,"Well, it's... as I read it, it says the defendant City of Lake Worth failed to formulate and implement an adequate policy to train its officers on the proper manner in which to respond."
1992.91-1657,1,17978,brett_a_ringle,,2223.492,2227.015,"--That is correct, Justice White."
1992.91-1657,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2227.015,2229.338,"Now, you say that... why is that inadequate?"
1992.91-1657,1,17978,brett_a_ringle,,2229.338,2238.572,"Because that is nothing more than a boiler plate assertion of the conclusion, and under rule 12, certainly the facts that are alleged in a complaint must be--"
1992.91-1657,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2238.572,2241.534,What more should it have said?
1992.91-1657,1,17978,brett_a_ringle,,2241.534,2249.739,"--I think what more it has to do is first state clearly the constitutional violation, and we have two different circumstances here."
1992.91-1657,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2284.613,2295.77,"So, you think that they should have recounted in the complaint various other acts, similar acts--"
1992.91-1657,1,17978,brett_a_ringle,,2295.77,2296.982,I think that there needs--
1992.91-1657,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2296.982,2305.157,--and that they would have to prove perhaps at trial to show that there was a deliberate indifference--
1992.91-1657,1,17978,brett_a_ringle,,2305.157,2305.918,--Precisely.
1992.91-1657,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2305.918,2306.489,--to the training.
1992.91-1657,1,17978,brett_a_ringle,,2312.343,2314.254,I think that something beyond--
1992.91-1657,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2314.254,2314.494,Yes.
1992.91-1657,1,17978,brett_a_ringle,,2315.395,2315.646,--Yes.
1992.91-1657,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2317.635,2330.844,"Well, beyond the policy reasons that you have given us for your yes answer, is there any textual basis in the rules for a yes answer because we're considering a question under the rules?"
1992.91-1657,1,17978,brett_a_ringle,,2330.844,2333.326,There is certainly a textual basis under rule 11.
1992.91-1657,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2334.155,2338.529,"Well, why don't... may I just start with the contrast between 8 and 9?"
1992.91-1657,1,17978,brett_a_ringle,,2360.153,2362.244,--Only to an extent.
1992.91-1657,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2390.312,2404.743,"Well, you're suggesting that on your sort of analysis that this case is involving a kind of municipal immunity, that the immunity is being abrogated by the failure to demand the heightened pleading."
1992.91-1657,1,17978,brett_a_ringle,,2404.743,2405.082,That is correct.
1992.91-1657,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2405.082,2407.685,"Well, then what do you do about Anderson and Creighton?"
1992.91-1657,1,17978,brett_a_ringle,,2409.936,2410.327,No.
1992.91-1657,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2410.697,2416.879,"Because Anderson and Creighton assumes that before the resolution of the immunity issue, there may be some discovery."
1992.91-1657,1,17978,brett_a_ringle,,2423.594,2425.845,"--No, I don't believe it does at all."
1992.91-1657,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2425.845,2450.321,"Well, if Anderson and Creighton doesn't imply that, why would it be implied by a rule of pleading or the recognition of a rule of pleading here that may allow some discovery of fact, i.e., leading... prior to and leading to summary judgment before you resolve what you refer to as the immunity to any municipal liability beyond respondeat superior?"
1992.91-1657,1,17978,brett_a_ringle,,2450.321,2464.301,"Because I believe that rule 11 requires more than a plaintiff to just have done an investigation and have found nothing, and having found nothing, that plaintiff is then free to allege a cause of action."
1992.91-1657,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2506.371,2507.332,May I just ask one question?
1992.91-1657,1,17978,brett_a_ringle,,2514.246,2545.748,"--The problem with rule 11 sanctions typically is they're assessed at the end of the case, and if in fact there's an immunity or protection for a municipality to be free from both liability and suit in a context that would otherwise allege only vicarious liability, it seems like that municipality has lost the benefit of that immunity if they must, in fact, defend the suit and rely on rule 11 sanctions down the road after the municipality--"
1992.91-1657,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2545.748,2546.536,"Well, you--"
1992.91-1657,1,17978,brett_a_ringle,,2546.536,2550.2,"--has gone through all of the defense, costs, and potentially even costs of settlement."
1992.91-1657,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2550.2,2554.704,--You seem to be positing in a rhetorical way a full-blown trial.
1992.91-1657,1,17978,brett_a_ringle,,2562.408,2565.861,"Well, they could be resolvable on summary judgment if the--"
1992.91-1657,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2565.861,2568.353,"Well, and this very case was."
1992.91-1657,1,17978,brett_a_ringle,,2568.353,2574.667,"--It's exactly what I was going to say, if the summary judgment is something that is ruled on prior to discovery."
1992.91-1657,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2601.013,2602.733,"If that's true, why did you oppose discovery?"
1992.91-1657,1,17978,brett_a_ringle,,2606.817,2608.938,--It was additional discovery.
1992.91-1657,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2617.482,2619.625,Did you give the names of the officers and their rank and all the rest?
1992.91-1657,1,17978,brett_a_ringle,,2619.625,2620.154,--The police--
1992.91-1657,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2620.154,2620.865,Did you do that?
1992.91-1657,1,17978,brett_a_ringle,,2620.865,2621.496,--Yes.
1992.91-1657,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2640.748,2656.66,"You claim that the complaint should have stated these details, and I thought the complaint was dismissed based on the fact that the complaint itself was inadequate."
1992.91-1657,1,17978,brett_a_ringle,,2656.66,2664.714,"The complaint was dismissed on that grounds and the district court also, as an alternative ground for his holding, granted summary judgment."
1992.91-1657,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2664.714,2672.009,"Well, what's the... what was the affirmance based on?"
1992.91-1657,1,17978,brett_a_ringle,,2672.009,2675.722,The affirmance was based on the dismissal under rule 12(b)(6).
1992.91-1657,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2675.722,2678.055,"Exactly, and that's the issue we got before us."
1992.91-1657,1,17978,brett_a_ringle,,2678.055,2679.615,"Yes, it is."
1992.91-1657,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2679.615,2687.78,"Well, if there's any other ground that judgment could be affirmed on, it's not before us right now."
1992.91-1657,1,17978,brett_a_ringle,,2687.78,2688.201,That's--
1992.91-1657,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2688.201,2690.414,We got to rule on the 12(b)(6) issue.
1992.91-1657,1,17978,brett_a_ringle,,2690.414,2692.004,"--That is correct, Justice White."
1992.91-1657,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2692.004,2701.41,"Getting back to your rule 11 point, it seems to me that rule 11 doesn't inform rules 8 and 9."
1992.91-1657,1,17978,brett_a_ringle,,2719.363,2722.164,I don't think it did alter rules 8 or 9.
1992.91-1657,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2722.164,2727.658,"Well, then that's the issue, whether or not rules 8 or 9 are complied with."
1992.91-1657,1,17978,brett_a_ringle,,2741.976,2768.043,"Even if the protection of a municipality from a vicarious liability case is judged to be predicated upon a construction of section 1983, and the fact that Congress in enacting the Ku Klux Klan Act did not grant a claim for vicarious liability, the result I suggest is the same as whether that protection from suit arises from an actual immunity."
1992.91-1657,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2787.316,2793.08,"Well, it's true if there had been respondeat superior, there would be no need to sue the city for negligent training."
1992.91-1657,1,17978,brett_a_ringle,,2793.08,2796.142,"Well, except there is no--"
1992.91-1657,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2796.142,2804.298,"But given the fact that there is no respondeat superior liability, the Court has said that the city is directly liable for failure of training."
1992.91-1657,1,17978,brett_a_ringle,,2806.989,2813.364,"--It's directly liable for failure to train, but not for negligence in doing so."
1992.91-1657,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2917.402,2924.695,"Mr. Ringle, you keep referring to this as immunity from liability."
1992.91-1657,1,17978,brett_a_ringle,,2937.635,2940.697,I think it is a protection from suit.
1992.91-1657,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2941.568,2941.788,No.
1992.91-1657,1,17978,brett_a_ringle,,2946.65,2972.227,"--Yes, but the point I think that we're looking at is we are going to be in a situation with municipalities that unless there is at least some allegation to indicate the implication of a municipal policy, then what we are really doing are defending the kinds of cases that whether it's because of immunity or because Congress never conferred the right to sue for vicarious liability under 1983--"
1992.91-1657,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2972.227,2978.582,"But that happens all the time, that people have to defend suits which turn out to be baseless."
1992.91-1657,1,17978,brett_a_ringle,,2978.582,2985.684,"--It does happen all the time, but not in the circumstances where there is an impact, an intrusion on the affairs of a municipal government."
1992.91-1657,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2986.045,2987.577,"So, you're saying municipalities are different."
1992.91-1657,1,17978,brett_a_ringle,,2987.577,2989.618,"--I think municipalities, indeed--"
1992.91-1657,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2989.618,2990.309,That's what the case comes down to.
1992.91-1657,1,17978,brett_a_ringle,,2990.619,2994.042,"--are different, and I would suggest--"
1992.91-1657,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2994.042,2995.642,It should have been in rule 9 then.
1992.91-1657,1,17978,brett_a_ringle,,3001.316,3002.027,"--Well, there have been--"
1992.91-1657,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3002.027,3004.438,"You could say, you know, when there's a municipality, you have to plead everything."
1992.91-1657,1,17978,brett_a_ringle,,3005.91,3016.345,"--There have been a variety of cases, though, where lower courts, and indeed this Court, seems to have sanctioned the possibility that something more than bare notice pleading is going to be required."
1992.91-1657,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3039.091,3068.701,"Mr. Ringle, take paragraph 25 of one of these complaints which appears on page 39 of the tan appendix, and reading midway through that, the allegation is that defendant City of Lake Worth failed to formulate and implement an adequate policy to train its officers on the proper manner in which to respond when confronted by family dogs."
1992.91-1657,1,17978,brett_a_ringle,,3071.44,3073.413,It's deficient--
1992.91-1657,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3073.413,3078.346,"Even under the approach you've been talking about, why is that deficient?"
1992.91-1657,1,17978,brett_a_ringle,,3078.346,3080.367,--It's not deficient perhaps to state a claim.
1992.91-1657,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3085.302,3087.712,"Well, what does it lack?"
1992.91-1657,1,17978,brett_a_ringle,,3087.712,3095.227,"--Well, I think if that is held to state a constitutional violation, perhaps that allegation is sufficient to state a claim."
1992.91-1657,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3108.495,3115.24,"But I thought your complaint was that to go further and hold a municipality, you have to allege a policy."
1992.91-1657,1,17978,brett_a_ringle,,3115.24,3116.29,Yes.
1992.91-1657,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3116.29,3118.931,Here they allege a policy.
1992.91-1657,1,17978,brett_a_ringle,,3118.931,3122.925,"Yes, again without any basis in fact."
1992.91-1657,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3124.815,3130.051,"If the thing has no basis in fact, that's not a pleading problem."
1992.91-1657,1,17978,brett_a_ringle,,3141.829,3151.683,"--That's perhaps so as a factual basis, but there is some reason to believe when the claim is asserted that there is a factual basis for it."
1992.91-1657,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3208.421,3210.712,"Well, they also alleged deliberate indifference."
1992.91-1657,1,17978,brett_a_ringle,,3210.712,3211.723,"--I'm sorry, Your Honor."
1992.91-1657,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3211.723,3217.247,The amended complaint also alleges deliberate indifference.
1992.91-1657,1,17978,brett_a_ringle,,3217.247,3220.269,Again without basis.
1992.91-1657,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3236.658,3239.58,Wouldn't you also agree these facts are a little bit unusual?
1992.91-1657,1,17978,brett_a_ringle,,3239.58,3246.796,"--I think the facts are highly unusual, but I don't think the facts are sufficient to put a policymaker on notice of--"
1992.91-1657,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3246.796,3250.329,They don't give rise to any suggestion that anybody might have trained these officers a little bit better?
1992.91-1657,1,17978,brett_a_ringle,,3257.803,3258.985,--That is an allegation.
1992.91-1657,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3261.336,3265.91,It's fairly routine to go out shooting dogs and hanging around afterwards talking on the lawn and all that?
1992.91-1657,1,17978,brett_a_ringle,,3272.421,3279.196,"Well, standing around and doing the things they're alleged to do may, indeed, be outrageous, perhaps even wrongful behavior, but--"
1992.91-1657,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3279.196,3284.94,"And also somewhat indicative of not well disciplined, professional officers."
1992.91-1657,1,17978,brett_a_ringle,,3289.685,3292.697,"--That, indeed, could be something that is assumed."
1992.91-1657,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3297.179,3302.953,"--Oh, no, it couldn't because these are rather... these... you say any allegation, but these are rather unusual facts."
1992.91-1657,1,17978,brett_a_ringle,,3304.763,3305.665,The fact--
1992.91-1657,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3305.665,3306.366,At least I don't think it is.
1992.91-1657,1,17978,brett_a_ringle,,3308.138,3312.741,"--The facts are bizarre, but I'm not sure that the facts are egregious, Justice Stevens."
1992.91-1657,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3312.741,3314.043,"Well, as soon as you say they're bizarre, they're not typical."
1992.91-1657,1,17978,brett_a_ringle,,3314.043,3315.733,They are not typical.
1992.91-1657,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3360.035,3364.066,"Sitting around in lawn chairs drinking beer, as I got it."
1992.91-1657,1,17978,brett_a_ringle,,3364.066,3367.108,"--That is, indeed, the allegation."
1992.91-1657,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3390.553,3399.339,"But if all... if they had just said that, well, and last week and the week before they did the same thing or something very similar, you wouldn't be here I suppose."
1992.91-1657,1,17978,brett_a_ringle,,3399.339,3400.621,Absolutely not.
1992.91-1657,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3409.266,3410.357,"Thank you, Mr. Ringle."
