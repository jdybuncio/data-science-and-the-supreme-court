1983.82-5298,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,8.607,We will hear arguments first this morning in Segura against the United States.
1983.82-5298,0,37895,peter_j_fabricant,,19.003,22.976,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1983.82-5298,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,226.909,229.942,Where did all of this take place?
1983.82-5298,0,37895,peter_j_fabricant,,232.103,238.487,"It occurred in Queens, New York, part of New York City."
1983.82-5298,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,238.487,239.757,Only one magistrate up there?
1983.82-5298,0,37895,peter_j_fabricant,,239.757,240.227,No.
1983.82-5298,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,264.024,265.346,What day of the week was February 12?
1983.82-5298,0,37895,peter_j_fabricant,,265.346,266.534,It was not a holiday.
1983.82-5298,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,271.519,281.485,Do you feel that had the magistrate known of the 18 or 19 hour occupancy of the home that his action would have been any different?
1983.82-5298,0,37895,peter_j_fabricant,,281.485,284.236,When he finally signed the warrant the next day?
1983.82-5298,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,315.866,329.797,"Counsel, I suppose you would concede that there was probable cause for the issuance of a warrant on the afternoon that you described where the police saw the delivery of this parcel to the two other people."
1983.82-5298,0,37895,peter_j_fabricant,,329.797,338.993,"Well, a warrant was eventually signed and it was based on the information that the police had before they entered the apartment."
1983.82-5298,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,338.993,340.734,You concede that was probable cause.
1983.82-5298,0,37895,peter_j_fabricant,,340.734,343.576,"Yes, as has been so held by the District Court and the Court of Appeals."
1983.82-5298,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,343.576,344.537,Yes.
1983.82-5298,0,37895,peter_j_fabricant,,344.537,359.216,"But I believe, Justice Powell, that it is the neutral and detached magistrate who in the first instance must make the determination of probable cause."
1983.82-5298,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,383.472,402.243,"Well, Mr. Fabricant, there is certainly some of our cases dealing with say a suitcase or whatever it was in Arkansas v. Sanders and the footlocker in Chadwick that say even though the police may not inspect a container without a warrant they can detain it while they are getting a warrant."
1983.82-5298,0,37895,peter_j_fabricant,,405.044,410.859,It is different because it is in a home where one has the highest expectation of privacy.
1983.82-5298,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,469.158,484.289,"Mr. Fabricant, in your view could the police have secured the house from the outside for 19 hours while they got the warrant not letting anybody in or out?"
1983.82-5298,0,37895,peter_j_fabricant,,484.289,484.98,Yes.
1983.82-5298,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,486.749,489.581,And in your view would have been acceptable.
1983.82-5298,0,37895,peter_j_fabricant,,500.527,502.9,That would be a closer question.
1983.82-5298,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,504.721,506.323,"Well, valid or invalid?"
1983.82-5298,0,37895,peter_j_fabricant,,506.323,512.047,"--It would be a closer question as to... Well, it would be invalid because I think that--"
1983.82-5298,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,512.047,514.438,The subsequent warrant in your view.
1983.82-5298,0,37895,peter_j_fabricant,,514.438,523.815,"--The subsequent warrant would still be invalid because I think what the Fourth Amendment seeks to protect more than anything else is the physical entry into the home, but it would be a different situation."
1983.82-5298,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,523.815,535.9,"What if the initial entry then had been on exigent circumstances and valid, let's say, in hot pursuit of someone or something and then 19 hours expired before the warrant?"
1983.82-5298,0,37895,peter_j_fabricant,,535.9,538.594,That would be... And they stayed outside?
1983.82-5298,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,538.594,542.525,"Inside, but a legal entry."
1983.82-5298,0,37895,peter_j_fabricant,,542.525,549.511,"Well, that would... They would be in a place where they had a right to be."
1983.82-5298,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,563.92,566.222,"Right, and the subsequent warrant valid?"
1983.82-5298,0,37895,peter_j_fabricant,,566.222,570.065,And the subsequent warrant might very well have been valid.
1983.82-5298,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,606.088,623.259,At the time of the entry and/or shortly thereafter do you think the officers could have taken the parcels and removed them from the apartment and secured them and then left the apartment and then ultimately opened them at the time they got the warrant?
1983.82-5298,0,37895,peter_j_fabricant,,623.259,624.528,Absolutely not.
1983.82-5298,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,673.602,682.07,Under your theory when the police are outside would they prevent people from going in?
1983.82-5298,0,37895,peter_j_fabricant,,682.07,686.142,I believe that they could.
1983.82-5298,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,686.973,688.483,On what ground?
1983.82-5298,0,37895,peter_j_fabricant,,688.483,690.776,--If they acted reasonably it would be--
1983.82-5298,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,690.776,693.447,On what ground?
1983.82-5298,0,37895,peter_j_fabricant,,693.447,696.338,--On the grounds that they are securing the premises.
1983.82-5298,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,718.922,721.764,I am having great difficulty with what is the difference.
1983.82-5298,0,37895,peter_j_fabricant,,726.008,726.649,--That is right.
1983.82-5298,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,726.649,729.05,If they are outside you cannot come in or go out.
1983.82-5298,0,37895,peter_j_fabricant,,729.849,731.331,There is no difference in that respect.
1983.82-5298,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,731.331,733.602,You said there was a difference.
1983.82-5298,0,37895,peter_j_fabricant,,733.602,734.013,No.
1983.82-5298,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,745.029,752.946,There is a difference I submit by people moving in and out because moving in and out can carry in and out.
1983.82-5298,0,37895,peter_j_fabricant,,752.946,754.236,Correct.
1983.82-5298,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,754.236,755.948,So there is a difference.
1983.82-5298,0,37895,peter_j_fabricant,,766.254,773.18,"No, I do not believe, Justice White, that you have to say that in this case."
1983.82-5298,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,773.18,774.039,Why not?
1983.82-5298,0,37895,peter_j_fabricant,,774.039,783.514,I don't think that the warrant and the discovery of the contraband is secondary evidence.
1983.82-5298,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,783.514,791.3,The only thing that was admitted was the materials that were found after the warrant was issued.
1983.82-5298,0,37895,peter_j_fabricant,,791.3,792.74,That is correct.
1983.82-5298,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,792.74,797.024,The warrant rested on independent grounds did it not?
1983.82-5298,0,37895,peter_j_fabricant,,797.024,797.935,That is correct.
1983.82-5298,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,801.246,811.644,Why doesn't it indicate... Suppose there had never been any warrant issued and no search under a warrant.
1983.82-5298,0,37895,peter_j_fabricant,,824.611,826.063,That is absolutely... and was.
1983.82-5298,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,826.063,827.152,--Just like it was in this case.
1983.82-5298,0,37895,peter_j_fabricant,,827.152,827.783,That is correct.
1983.82-5298,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,827.783,842.673,So why isn't that a sufficient remedy for the illegal entry just render inadmissible what they seized prior to the warrant?
1983.82-5298,0,37895,peter_j_fabricant,,842.673,847.766,"Well, I think that depends on your definition of seizure."
1983.82-5298,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,863.176,876.095,So you think that it is a product because if they had not been there the evidence might have been destroyed or it might have gone somewhere else.
1983.82-5298,0,37895,peter_j_fabricant,,876.095,877.765,"Well, it might have been destroyed."
1983.82-5298,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,879.938,889.664,But that is the only way you think the occupation of that house taints the later seizure?
1983.82-5298,0,37895,peter_j_fabricant,,889.664,891.356,"No, that is not the only reason."
1983.82-5298,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,891.356,892.636,What is it?
1983.82-5298,0,37895,peter_j_fabricant,,892.636,901.671,The reason is that to allow the entry without a search warrant I think you are assuming that because the police feel--
1983.82-5298,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,901.671,902.913,Nobody is allowing it.
1983.82-5298,0,37895,peter_j_fabricant,,902.913,903.674,--What is that?
1983.82-5298,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,903.674,905.474,Nobody is allowing it.
1983.82-5298,0,37895,peter_j_fabricant,,905.474,909.087,"Well, by not suppressing--"
1983.82-5298,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,909.087,910.066,The court here held it was an illegal entry.
1983.82-5298,0,37895,peter_j_fabricant,,910.066,912.36,"--Well, nobody is denying that."
1983.82-5298,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,930.365,942.751,"Do you want your argument to be understood, counsel, as meaning that the government may never gain any advantage out of an illegal entry?"
1983.82-5298,0,37895,peter_j_fabricant,,942.751,945.583,Into a home?
1983.82-5298,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,945.583,947.793,Into a home is what we are talking about here.
1983.82-5298,0,37895,peter_j_fabricant,,947.793,948.854,Yes.
1983.82-5298,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,959.941,975.221,My question was intended to put it on the first part of the question that the government may never profit or secure any advantage toward a prosecution if it flows from an illegal entry of a home.
1983.82-5298,0,37895,peter_j_fabricant,,975.221,978.423,--Yes.
1983.82-5298,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,978.423,997.458,The advantage that was secured in this case with respect to the seizures made after the warrant was issued was just that the evidence was still there and it might not have been if they had not been in the home.
1983.82-5298,0,37895,peter_j_fabricant,,997.458,1002.24,"Well, it probably would have still been there even if they had secured the premises."
1983.82-5298,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1002.24,1007.043,What kind of advantage then did the government get by the illegal entry?
1983.82-5298,0,37895,peter_j_fabricant,,1007.043,1010.575,They do not really get an advantage.
1983.82-5298,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1043.416,1052.363,Is it your position that the police could have got a warrant on the information they had before they entered the home?
1983.82-5298,0,37895,peter_j_fabricant,,1052.363,1054.313,They had five hours to do so.
1983.82-5298,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1060.537,1065.241,I know it was an opportunity and there may always be time.
1983.82-5298,0,37895,peter_j_fabricant,,1078.239,1083.023,"Yes, it was because they presented that same information 19 hours after the illegal entry."
1983.82-5298,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1083.023,1088.327,"Well, they had the advantage of knowing some things that they did not know 19 hours before."
1983.82-5298,0,37895,peter_j_fabricant,,1088.327,1091.199,But they did not put them in their affidavit for the warrant.
1983.82-5298,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1111.26,1119.696,They were taking some risk I suppose that a warrant might not have issued.
1983.82-5298,0,37895,peter_j_fabricant,,1119.696,1123.94,"Well, if that is so then they are not supposed to go in."
1983.82-5298,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1123.94,1128.911,"Well, you never know in advance whether a warrant is going to issue do you?"
1983.82-5298,0,37895,peter_j_fabricant,,1128.911,1141.791,"I think the point of the Fourth Amendment particularly the warrant clause as applied to homes is that it is not a determination to be made in the first instance by law enforcement officers, by police."
1983.82-5298,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1145.652,1147.575,But that is all pretty well settled.
1983.82-5298,0,37895,peter_j_fabricant,,1159.543,1161.554,That is correct.
1983.82-5298,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1169.818,1175.701,"Well, the evidence they found pursuant to their illegal entry was suppressed."
1983.82-5298,0,37895,peter_j_fabricant,,1175.701,1178.393,All the evidence they discovered was.
1983.82-5298,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1178.393,1179.264,Sure.
1983.82-5298,0,37895,peter_j_fabricant,,1205.402,1218.591,"No, I do not think it is enough of a deterrent to deter the police from illegal entry in homes because in a great deal of situations contraband is not on kitchen tables."
1983.82-5298,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1238.444,1245.39,Do you understand the government to argue that the entry was actually legal?
1983.82-5298,0,37895,peter_j_fabricant,,1245.39,1253.874,"Well, they admit that it is not an issue but then they do argue that it is legal."
1983.82-5298,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1253.874,1274.778,Because if you can stay on the premises to prevent the destruction of evidence you should be able to enter the... If you stay on the premises legally to prevent the destruction of evidence why shouldn't you be able to enter the premises legally in the first place to prevent the destruction of evidence?
1983.82-5298,0,37895,peter_j_fabricant,,1274.778,1275.817,Because the--
1983.82-5298,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1275.817,1281.012,Isn't that the logical end of the government's position?
1983.82-5298,0,37895,peter_j_fabricant,,1281.012,1284.615,"--Well, it is the end of their position, but I do not agree with it."
1983.82-5298,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1285.014,1298.063,"Well, I know you do not agree, but if you lose this case wouldn't that be the necessary result that the entry is legal in the first place?"
1983.82-5298,0,37895,peter_j_fabricant,,1298.063,1307.139,"--That would be the result if the convictions were affirmed, and I submit that the warrant clause would almost disappear."
1983.82-5298,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1314.172,1315.014,How can that--
1983.82-5298,0,37895,peter_j_fabricant,,1331.844,1337.527,"--But that is a clearly defined exception to the warrant requirement, the hot pursuit."
1983.82-5298,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1337.527,1350.636,You said there is no exception as of now at least that allows the police to occupy a premises to preserve the status quo with respect to evidence.
1983.82-5298,0,37895,peter_j_fabricant,,1350.636,1353.368,Not from the inside.
1983.82-5298,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1543.653,1546.615,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1983.82-5298,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1780.209,1785.504,"You confess a place of business is distinguished from a residence, a home."
1983.82-5298,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1785.504,1798.991,"Well, with a place of business there would be a question as to what the zone of privacy or private areas are, but they would require a warrant or exigent circumstances in private areas of a place of business as a home."
1983.82-5298,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1835.366,1840.458,The connection according to the other side is that they stayed there.
1983.82-5298,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1869.778,1870.509,--I do not know.
1983.82-5298,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1914.327,1918.878,Under your rule what is the incentive for them to leave?
1983.82-5298,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1918.878,1920.591,"Well, anything--"
1983.82-5298,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1920.591,1925.363,It is desirable as you conceded it that they should not stay.
1983.82-5298,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1927.616,1935.201,"--Well, one would be civil liability if the Court made it clear that they were not permitted to stay inside once the premises were secured."
1983.82-5298,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1964.399,1972.434,"Well, you think there is a qualitative difference between seizing a home from the inside without a warrant and seizing it from the outside?"
1983.82-5298,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1972.434,1976.728,"Well, I do not think the difference resides in seizure doctrine."
1983.82-5298,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1998.45,2001.652,"Well, you do not ordinarily seize real property do you?"
1983.82-5298,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2001.652,2002.824,--No.
1983.82-5298,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2007.156,2011.67,But if you could do it I suppose there would be a seizure involved if you secured it from the outside.
1983.82-5298,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2011.67,2013.731,--There would be.
1983.82-5298,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2030.762,2034.315,Even if it is labeled seizure?
1983.82-5298,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2034.315,2036.127,Even if it is labeled seizure.
1983.82-5298,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2038.158,2040.228,"Mr. Frey, the Fourth Amendment does not just use the term ""seizure""."
1983.82-5298,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2041.9,2043.48,--Unreasonable--
1983.82-5298,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2043.48,2051.485,Is it not at least theoretically possible that one could say that the seizure when you are outside is reasonable but when you are inside it is unreasonable?
1983.82-5298,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2051.485,2052.957,"--Well, I think what--"
1983.82-5298,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2052.957,2055.319,At least that is conceptually possible to say that.
1983.82-5298,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2055.319,2059.643,"--I could conceive of somebody saying it, yes, and I--"
1983.82-5298,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2059.643,2063.604,I think you have almost admitted it because you said you thought they ought to go outside.
1983.82-5298,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2063.604,2069.498,--I think that where they enter the house without exigent circumstances they are committing a Fourth Amendment violation.
1983.82-5298,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2069.498,2070.099,Right.
1983.82-5298,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2070.099,2075.492,In my opinion the Fourth Amendment violation they are committing is illegal search--
1983.82-5298,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2075.492,2080.984,But you said you thought they ought to get out as soon they could and why unless you think one condition is more reasonable than the other?
1983.82-5298,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2080.984,2082.756,--Not with respect to seizure.
1983.82-5298,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2124.715,2128.217,"Well, I think they have an incentive to stay in in February in New York."
1983.82-5298,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2129.767,2134.83,--I assume the corridors of this apartment building were also heated.
1983.82-5298,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2134.83,2136.242,Do not bet on it.
1983.82-5298,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2161.107,2164.051,"Well, I do not think actually--"
1983.82-5298,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2164.051,2180.461,"If they had known that there were people on the premises and they had probable cause to believe that there are easily disposable narcotics on the premises, could they make a legal entry for the purpose of removing the people?"
1983.82-5298,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2180.461,2192.63,--That would be... If they in addition had sufficient reason to believe there was a danger of destruction of the narcotics they could make an entry for the purpose of preventing the destruction of the evidence.
1983.82-5298,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2192.63,2197.274,In which event although the entry was legal if they stayed too long it would become illegal.
1983.82-5298,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2197.274,2211.272,"Equally whether the legal... Whether the initial entry was legal or illegal does not relate to whether it is illegal for them to continue staying here, but I think this whole 19 hour business is a complete red herring in this case."
1983.82-5298,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2228.043,2240.271,The affidavit as I understand it was not only based on facts that were in the hands of the police before the entry but was actually turned in earlier wasn't it?
1983.82-5298,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2240.271,2240.912,No.
1983.82-5298,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2240.912,2242.741,Was the affidavit turned in later?
1983.82-5298,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2242.741,2243.933,After the entry.
1983.82-5298,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2243.933,2245.683,When was it executed?
1983.82-5298,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2245.683,2251.968,What the record shows is that they entered at 11 o'clock at night.
1983.82-5298,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2287.521,2307.747,"Well, you also have a problem that you really have not met yet of saying that the illegal entry tainted the later search under the warrant because it did keep the people who were found to be on the premises from destroying the evidence."
1983.82-5298,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2307.747,2308.175,"--Well, let me turn to--"
1983.82-5298,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2308.175,2309.447,You still have to get to that.
1983.82-5298,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2309.447,2310.178,--Yes.
1983.82-5298,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2415.706,2417.125,What about removing it?
1983.82-5298,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2418.768,2423.54,It is illegal I think to remove or destroy for purposes of evading--
1983.82-5298,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2423.54,2434.477,You think it would have been a crime for somebody to pick up the briefcase and walk off and go to somebody else's house with it?
1983.82-5298,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2434.477,2440.431,--I do not think it would be a crime if it were not for the purpose of removing evidence from... In any event the entry did not prevent them from removing the evidence.
1983.82-5298,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2452.499,2454.211,I do not know.
1983.82-5298,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2454.211,2458.834,"Well, they were staking out the place from the outside."
1983.82-5298,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2465.439,2471.042,Did they have probable cause to arrest anybody they found in there that came out of the building?
1983.82-5298,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2471.042,2471.453,Not necessarily.
1983.82-5298,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2474.764,2478.126,Do you think they could have searched anybody who came out of the apartment?
1983.82-5298,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2479.446,2496.589,"Well, in Pawlings v. Kentucky the Court adverted to but did not decide the question, and in Michigan v. Summers I think the Court suggested that they could require people not to leave unless they would agree to subject themselves to a search."
1983.82-5298,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2509.787,2513.5,Do we have a case... There are so many Fourth Amendment cases.
1983.82-5298,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2521.094,2523.818,Mincey v. Arizona.
1983.82-5298,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2523.818,2545.15,"We applied it at least if not stated it in the search case last June, the name of which eludes me now other than Mincey where the customs agents found and then they had a controlled delivery."
1983.82-5298,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2546.131,2549.934,"Oh, Illinois v. Sandreyas."
1983.82-5298,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2612.544,2617.007,Isn't there another problem here?
1983.82-5298,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2646.266,2650.119,"Well, I am not sure that the fact that an illegal entry has been made would be the critical question."
1983.82-5298,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2677.238,2686.031,What if this was a home out in the country somewhere and they just moved in for 30 days just waiting and for some reason there was--
1983.82-5298,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2686.031,2690.636,--There would probably be... Just compensation clause might be applicable to that.
1983.82-5298,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2690.636,2694.817,--But you don't think that would have any impact at all on this issue no matter how long a period of time involved?
1983.82-5298,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2694.817,2697.361,"Well, I am reluctant to say that it wouldn't."
1983.82-5298,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2728.149,2733.545,"Well, 30 days would be ""unreasonable"" wouldn't you say?"
1983.82-5298,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2733.545,2736.164,I would say ordinarily 30 days would be--
1983.82-5298,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2736.164,2745.031,"Because I mean, for example, if the agents stayed in that apartment for 30 days that would be an unreasonable amount of food."
1983.82-5298,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2746.612,2750.284,"--Well, it would be unreasonable."
1983.82-5298,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2767.516,2769.306,They were both arrested.
1983.82-5298,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2769.306,2770.738,They were both arrested.
1983.82-5298,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2906.606,2913.349,You went a little too fast for me to catch the basis for the issuance of the warrant.
1983.82-5298,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2913.349,2917.523,Some after-acquired information which gives probable cause.
1983.82-5298,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2925.898,2931.352,Red briefcase that was put in locker 16 contains narcotics or some such thing?
1983.82-5298,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2931.352,2934.564,--Yes and assuming there is probable cause and they got a warrant.
1983.82-5298,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2970.809,2982.536,"Mr. Frey, would your hypothetical produce the same answer if the telephone call from the informant was after the owner of the briefcase went to the check room and said I want my briefcase?"
1983.82-5298,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2982.536,2983.266,No.
1983.82-5298,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2988.268,2999.025,"So that in this case if they could prove that ten hours later the cleaning woman would have come and cleaned out the apartment, not to destroy evidence but she does not like these little bags around or something like that."
1983.82-5298,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3000.427,3006.141,--Except for the fact that they could have kept the cleaning woman out from outside.
1983.82-5298,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3006.141,3006.882,I see.
1983.82-5298,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3011.374,3013.076,One can imagine--
1983.82-5298,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3013.076,3014.306,I do not know what all this trouble is about.
1983.82-5298,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3019.191,3022.53,--This is not a shooting gallery.
1983.82-5298,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3038.272,3040.435,"Well, there was no cleaning people involved in this case."
1983.82-5298,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3040.435,3042.077,No cleaning people involved in this case.
1983.82-5298,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3042.077,3054.767,I do not recall from the findings of the District Court or the District Court's observations but was there any treatment of whether this was a place of business or home or residence by the District judge?
1983.82-5298,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3054.767,3056.447,I think it is treated as a residence.
1983.82-5298,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3056.447,3060.14,"Treated it, but was there any analysis directed?"
1983.82-5298,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3060.14,3079.311,"I do not recall that there was any, and I would not ask the Court to rest its decision in this case on the notion that this is a place of business because I believe even as a place of business it has protection from the warrant clause."
1983.82-5298,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3079.311,3081.772,The same degree?
1983.82-5298,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3081.772,3083.515,"Well, it would not necessarily be the same."
1983.82-5298,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3098.805,3104.989,The reason it was unlawful is that they actually were mistaken about exigent circumstances.
1983.82-5298,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3104.989,3109.701,--That is what the Court of Appeals said that there were not exigent circumstances--
1983.82-5298,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3109.701,3110.902,You have not brought that up.
1983.82-5298,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3110.902,3111.882,--Huh?
1983.82-5298,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3111.882,3113.455,You have not challenged that.
1983.82-5298,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3113.455,3114.433,We have not challenged that.
1983.82-5298,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3145.585,3149.706,But you are not defending the result below on the grounds that the entry in the first place was legal?
1983.82-5298,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3149.706,3151.579,No.
1983.82-5298,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3281.675,3283.504,"Mr. Fabricant, do you have anything further?"
1983.82-5298,2,37895,peter_j_fabricant,,3283.504,3284.345,"Yes, I do."
1983.82-5298,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3284.345,3286.827,You have five minutes remaining.
1983.82-5298,2,37895,peter_j_fabricant,,3286.827,3293.141,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1983.82-5298,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3343.846,3347.337,Do you think it would make a difference if it were a place of business?
1983.82-5298,2,37895,peter_j_fabricant,,3347.337,3349.418,--Yes.
1983.82-5298,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3367.851,3368.209,Then what about--
1983.82-5298,2,37895,peter_j_fabricant,,3368.209,3369.541,But not so much as the home.
1983.82-5298,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3369.541,3383.43,"--Then what about a home which is used as a place of business with the home if it could be shown merely a front, a cover and it is really a place for distributing narcotics?"
1983.82-5298,2,37895,peter_j_fabricant,,3383.43,3394.037,I would think that if that could be shown by the prosecution then your expectation of privacy might be lessened at least somewhat.
1983.82-5298,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3405.104,3414.982,"Are you saying that there is no expectation, no legitimate expectation of privacy in the conduct of criminal affairs, criminal activity?"
1983.82-5298,2,37895,peter_j_fabricant,,3414.982,3421.635,"Well, the decisions of this Court dealing with the Constitution do not just deal with criminals."
1983.82-5298,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3428.85,3435.004,"Well, but you spoke of it in terms of the expectation of privacy which is the way the courts have spoken of it."
1983.82-5298,2,37895,peter_j_fabricant,,3455.087,3459.42,Perhaps because home is mentioned in the Fourth Amendment.
1983.82-5298,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3588.905,3613.119,"Suppose the officers stayed 19 hours and then left and the next day a warrant was issued on independent grounds, on grounds that were not tainted and they went and discovered what they discovered here."
1983.82-5298,2,37895,peter_j_fabricant,,3626.51,3636.814,"I would still argue it, but I think my argument would carry less weight because in that situation there would at least be a break in the continuous seizure."
1983.82-5298,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3636.814,3641.919,"I know, but in terms of the connection between the entry and the discovery under the warrant--"
1983.82-5298,2,37895,peter_j_fabricant,,3641.919,3643.96,"I would argue the same, Your Honor."
1983.82-5298,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3643.96,3646.201,"--I know, but you would have to."
1983.82-5298,2,37895,peter_j_fabricant,,3646.201,3646.972,I would--
1983.82-5298,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3646.972,3654.816,Do you think your argument is any weaker or any stronger now than if it were the next day?
1983.82-5298,2,37895,peter_j_fabricant,,3657.899,3660.342,--Only in the respect that--
1983.82-5298,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3660.342,3666.855,Suppose that you would have to lose the case if it were the next day.
1983.82-5298,2,37895,peter_j_fabricant,,3669.717,3673.441,"--No, right."
1983.82-5298,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3673.441,3673.832,"Thank you, gentlemen."
