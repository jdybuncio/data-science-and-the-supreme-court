1989.89-275,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.189,"We'll hear argument next in No. 89-275, Cooter & Gell v. Hartmarx Corporation."
1989.89-275,0,42004,stephen_allan_saltzburg,,54.301,57.17,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.89-275,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,210.586,219.192,Is it clear that both the attorneys and the client here brought forth these allegations?
1989.89-275,0,42004,stephen_allan_saltzburg,,219.192,224.845,"Mr. Chief Justice, what's clear is... is the following."
1989.89-275,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,242.391,244.507,But I take it it is the record you're going to deal with.
1989.89-275,0,42004,stephen_allan_saltzburg,,244.507,253.747,--It is the record we must deal with and... and the reason for that is Rule 11 had just taken effect in its revised form in August of 1983.
1989.89-275,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,428.41,434.48,"We don't have before us, do we, the question of whether it was appropriate for the district court to impose sanctions?"
1989.89-275,0,42004,stephen_allan_saltzburg,,434.48,435.914,"No, sir."
1989.89-275,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,475.891,480.093,"What standard do... do you think the court of appeals used, Mr. Saltzman?"
1989.89-275,0,42004,stephen_allan_saltzburg,,484.663,487.215,"--Justice O'Connor, I think that's a very fair conclusion."
1989.89-275,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,510.997,519.086,"A moment ago, Mr. Saltzburg, I asked you do we have here the question of the propriety of the district court imposing sanctions."
1989.89-275,0,42004,stephen_allan_saltzburg,,527.942,528.776,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice."
1989.89-275,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,541.017,544.469,"Well, that may be so but you win if the... if there shouldn't have been any sanctions at all."
1989.89-275,0,42004,stephen_allan_saltzburg,,544.469,546.171,"Justice White, you're correct and I suggest that--"
1989.89-275,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,546.171,547.538,"And that's what you're going to argue, I take it."
1989.89-275,0,42004,stephen_allan_saltzburg,,547.538,548.606,--Immediately.
1989.89-275,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,586.565,597.336,"Mr. Salzman, would a court, a district court, have continued power to go after a lawyer on a contempt sanction after a voluntary dismissal?"
1989.89-275,0,42004,stephen_allan_saltzburg,,597.336,599.872,"In our view, Justice O'Connor, yes."
1989.89-275,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,599.872,614.465,"Well, how is that different in any way from a Rule 11 sanction which does seem to be one designed to address what the attorney did, not what the client did so much?"
1989.89-275,0,42004,stephen_allan_saltzburg,,614.465,618.767,"Justice O'Connor, to give a full answer to that, I want to be clear."
1989.89-275,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,704.105,706.205,"Well, I don't see why you need an exception."
1989.89-275,0,42004,stephen_allan_saltzburg,,723.667,735.125,"--Well, it's... Justice O'Connor, I would like to argue to you that the plain language of Rule 41 requires the reading that we urge upon the Court, but--"
1989.89-275,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,735.125,735.459,What's that?
1989.89-275,0,42004,stephen_allan_saltzburg,,735.459,736.411,--but we cannot do that.
1989.89-275,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,736.411,736.694,Without prejudice?
1989.89-275,0,42004,stephen_allan_saltzburg,,736.694,737.244,But part of--
1989.89-275,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,737.244,739.946,"The words ""without prejudice""?"
1989.89-275,0,42004,stephen_allan_saltzburg,,739.946,742.096,"--The... I think the words ""without prejudice"" are important in--"
1989.89-275,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,742.096,745.932,But doesn't that just refer to the right to file another lawsuit?
1989.89-275,0,42004,stephen_allan_saltzburg,,749.884,751.753,"--Well, perhaps I can add to... to that."
1989.89-275,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,777.219,777.904,"Well, but--"
1989.89-275,0,42004,stephen_allan_saltzburg,,777.904,778.588,--Rule 11 violations.
1989.89-275,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,778.588,791.128,"--But I practiced for 16 years in a state which had the federal rules, as well in the federal courts, and a voluntary dismissal under Rule 41... the only benefit you thought you got from it was that it wasn't res judicata."
1989.89-275,0,42004,stephen_allan_saltzburg,,791.128,796.882,"Well, Chief Justice Rehnquist, let me perhaps answer that in two... two ways."
1989.89-275,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,842.68,844.846,"Well, you could... you could argue it that way."
1989.89-275,0,42004,stephen_allan_saltzburg,,867.311,870.43,"The Court could say that, Justice Scalia, and it--"
1989.89-275,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,870.43,870.73,Yeah.
1989.89-275,0,42004,stephen_allan_saltzburg,,871.83,872.449,--It would be.
1989.89-275,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,950.365,960.055,--What would it... a sanction that made it more difficult but not impossible to bring a subsequent... you would treat that as a dismissal with prejudice?
1989.89-275,0,42004,stephen_allan_saltzburg,,960.055,971.279,"To the extent that the difficult but not impossible involved fact-finding and collateral estoppel that might make the second action if not wholly barred... I mean, it may make the second action precluded at least in part."
1989.89-275,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,971.279,979.069,"Well, what... what do you interpret the phrase 41 to mean beyond it not being res judicata?"
1989.89-275,0,42004,stephen_allan_saltzburg,,979.069,987.99,"I think that it is a... that the with prejudice language, or without prejudice, means without having any preclusive effects upon a subsequent suit."
1989.89-275,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1017.01,1019.577,"That's kind of around Robin Hood's barn, isn't it?"
1989.89-275,0,42004,stephen_allan_saltzburg,,1026.281,1027.732,Yes.
1989.89-275,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1061.789,1069.978,"Mr. Saltzburg, I thought that collateral estoppel requires that the found facts have been necessary to the... to the earlier decision."
1989.89-275,0,42004,stephen_allan_saltzburg,,1080.134,1080.617,"--Yes, sir."
1989.89-275,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1080.617,1085.654,I don't see how any facts must be found for a Rule 11 decision.
1989.89-275,0,42004,stephen_allan_saltzburg,,1102.45,1102.8,Justice Scalia--
1989.89-275,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1102.8,1105.402,--as to what the objective facts are.
1989.89-275,0,42004,stephen_allan_saltzburg,,1105.402,1116.673,--There is... there is nothing that is inherent in any case that says a judge in making findings would necessarily make fact findings about the merits of an issue or the case.
1989.89-275,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1121.927,1128.481,To the extent it is it does not have any collateral estoppel effect because it's... it's not essential to the judgment.
1989.89-275,0,42004,stephen_allan_saltzburg,,1128.481,1131.767,"Well, it could be in a given case, Justice Scalia."
1989.89-275,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1142.425,1151.446,"What Justice Scalia is saying, as I understand it, is even if A, B and C are true, you can nevertheless hold the lawyer... sanction the lawyer because he didn't really find out that they were true in time."
1989.89-275,0,42004,stephen_allan_saltzburg,,1151.446,1162.321,"--Justice Stevens, that's theoretically possible, that the judge will say that in some cases that A, B and C are true, the lawyer alleged them to be true, but the lawyer didn't really know that they were true, and could impose sanctions for that reason."
1989.89-275,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1166.39,1170.927,"In other words, he could be sanctioned for filing a meritorious complaint if he didn't investigate it thoroughly enough to begin with."
1989.89-275,0,42004,stephen_allan_saltzburg,,1170.927,1171.91,--That's possible.
1989.89-275,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1171.91,1172.227,Yeah.
1989.89-275,0,42004,stephen_allan_saltzburg,,1172.227,1184.485,"He may also be sanctioned... and this is a problem with the construction of Rule 11 that allows sanctions to be imposed after a dismissal... that it may also be the case that the judge will say facts A, B and C are untrue."
1989.89-275,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1281.648,1291.373,"Well, that was certainly unfortunate and perhaps the courts need to tighten up on additional rules or times to act on things."
1989.89-275,0,42004,stephen_allan_saltzburg,,1297.277,1298.927,"I'm not sure, Justice O'Connor."
1989.89-275,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1315.571,1320.892,Is there a time limit on contempt sanctions?
1989.89-275,0,42004,stephen_allan_saltzburg,,1320.892,1325.51,"I don't... Mr. Chief Justice, I don't know of a time limit on contempt sanctions."
1989.89-275,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1336.402,1338.418,How about civil contempt?
1989.89-275,0,42004,stephen_allan_saltzburg,,1338.418,1346.091,"Civil contempt is... is, to the best of my knowledge, no... I don't know of any sanctions."
1989.89-275,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1457.681,1460.816,I... I really can't understand this argument that you've made in your brief.
1989.89-275,0,42004,stephen_allan_saltzburg,,1469.739,1470.489,--Justice Scalia--
1989.89-275,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1470.489,1475.392,"I think it's your obligation to make sure it's accurate, and the other side is fully intended to say: You want to file it?"
1989.89-275,0,42004,stephen_allan_saltzburg,,1480.296,1485.414,"--Justice Scalia, I'm glad you put the question that way because I'd like to give you as direct an answer as that question is."
1989.89-275,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1523.456,1524.273,Play cat and mouse.
1989.89-275,0,42004,stephen_allan_saltzburg,,1533.431,1542.787,"Well, in this case I would like to remind the Court, Justice Scalia, there has been no determination at all as to whether the facts alleged by the clients of petitioner are true."
1989.89-275,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1544.937,1550.357,But didn't your client try to... didn't your client succeed in publicizing the filing of the complaint in this case?
1989.89-275,0,42004,stephen_allan_saltzburg,,1550.357,1553.559,"--I don't believe... I don't think that that's a fair characterization, Justice Rehnquist."
1989.89-275,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1570.954,1578.726,"Well, of course, the complaint was presented in the context of bargaining in an action on a debt, was it not?"
1989.89-275,0,42004,stephen_allan_saltzburg,,1578.726,1580.662,"That's correct, Justice Kennedy."
1989.89-275,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1597.538,1614.966,"You say when a Plaintiff files a claim for $500,000 damages as a result of an accident and he says to the other side, I think we have a tort problem here... I mean, that isn't what most people think the filing of a complaint is, kind of a starting of a discussion."
1989.89-275,0,42004,stephen_allan_saltzburg,,1614.966,1616.418,"I think that's correct, Mr. Chief Justice."
1989.89-275,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1738.797,1740.149,"Very well, Mr. Saltzburg."
1989.89-275,1,39270,richard_joseph_favretto,,1743.118,1748.07,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.89-275,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1769.133,1774.037,"Please do it, Mr. Favretto, with a mind to the three questions before the Court, will you?"
1989.89-275,1,39270,richard_joseph_favretto,,1774.037,1774.87,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice."
1989.89-275,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1861.643,1861.993,May I just ask--
1989.89-275,1,39270,richard_joseph_favretto,,1861.993,1862.928,--upon their client--
1989.89-275,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1862.928,1863.945,--one question since you've raised that point?
1989.89-275,1,39270,richard_joseph_favretto,,1873.534,1873.917,--That's--
1989.89-275,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1873.917,1874.236,"That's fairly routine, huh?"
1989.89-275,1,39270,richard_joseph_favretto,,1874.236,1877.438,"--Mr. Justice Stevens, that's the Federal Trade Commission."
1989.89-275,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1891.662,1892.53,"Not, but assume they thought they had a good case."
1989.89-275,1,39270,richard_joseph_favretto,,1894.899,1896.149,"Oh, absolutely not."
1989.89-275,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1896.949,1900.268,And isn't it an appropriate subject for discussion during a settlement conference?
1989.89-275,1,39270,richard_joseph_favretto,,1904.755,1906.624,"No, I was just clarifying the--"
1989.89-275,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1906.624,1908.74,"--Like the Chief Justice, I'm more interested in the issues than this particular--"
1989.89-275,1,39270,richard_joseph_favretto,,1908.74,1910.842,--Okay.
1989.89-275,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2035.307,2039.025,--Shouldn't the sanctions at least be imposed within a reasonable time?
1989.89-275,1,39270,richard_joseph_favretto,,2046.447,2053.701,"Well, Justice O'Connor, let me just respond by giving you a little background about what happened here and then responding to your question."
1989.89-275,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2153.467,2155.752,"Well, of course, we're not really talking about immunity baths."
1989.89-275,1,39270,richard_joseph_favretto,,2159.204,2159.804,--That's true.
1989.89-275,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2160.388,2161.59,"But, of course, no benefit to your client."
1989.89-275,1,39270,richard_joseph_favretto,,2163.791,2177.582,"Well, Rule 11, I think, is the... is the appropriate vehicle for dealing with this kind of issue in the most efficient manner rather than to have perhaps a separate proceeding that would call these questions up in a... in a completely different context."
1989.89-275,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2182.236,2182.719,--I don't disagree with that.
1989.89-275,1,39270,richard_joseph_favretto,,2184.771,2186.188,It's not a... it's... I... I--
1989.89-275,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2186.188,2187.907,It's nothing like an immunity bath.
1989.89-275,1,39270,richard_joseph_favretto,,2187.907,2192.425,--I accept your... your modification.
1989.89-275,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2282.352,2287.588,"Did the appellate court apply an abuse of discretion standard, do you think?"
1989.89-275,1,39270,richard_joseph_favretto,,2287.588,2298.128,"Explicitly as to the selection of the sanction and the amount of the sanction, I'm not certain of that, Justice O'Connor."
1989.89-275,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2311.871,2316.156,And what standard do you tell us should be applied?
1989.89-275,1,39270,richard_joseph_favretto,,2316.156,2322.41,--We... we are beyond... going beyond the application in this case because we don't think it would make a difference in this case.
1989.89-275,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2328.832,2329.965,"Well, what if--"
1989.89-275,1,39270,richard_joseph_favretto,,2341.473,2342.073,I think--
1989.89-275,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2342.073,2347.377,"Now, does that pose some kind of mixed law of fact question?"
1989.89-275,1,39270,richard_joseph_favretto,,2347.377,2349.413,--It may well be a mixed question of fact and law.
1989.89-275,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2360.352,2363.071,And you think even there an abuse of discretion standard--
1989.89-275,1,39270,richard_joseph_favretto,,2363.071,2377.496,--I do because I... I think the preamble to that... to that provision in the rule suggests that after a reasonable inquiry... after a reasonable inquiry that it is based upon the good faith.
1989.89-275,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2387.336,2391.84,"--Well, that sounds like there would be just some historical facts at issue."
1989.89-275,1,39270,richard_joseph_favretto,,2404.131,2414.355,"If there is... if there is... if there are historical facts at issue, a clearly erroneous standard may be appropriate as to those disputed facts."
1989.89-275,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2416.438,2416.838,"Well, what about the--"
1989.89-275,1,39270,richard_joseph_favretto,,2416.838,2419.007,--an abuse of discretion standard in a factual context.
1989.89-275,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2419.007,2419.657,--All right.
1989.89-275,1,39270,richard_joseph_favretto,,2426.996,2430.698,That's the application of the facts to the standard or the standard to the facts.
1989.89-275,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2430.698,2431.131,Yes.
1989.89-275,1,39270,richard_joseph_favretto,,2437.719,2440.487,I think under an abuse of discretion standard if there was a clear--
1989.89-275,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2440.487,2442.356,That shouldn't be de novo?
1989.89-275,1,39270,richard_joseph_favretto,,2442.356,2442.789,--No.
1989.89-275,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2456.932,2463.602,Are you saying there's no difference in the clearly erroneous standard and the abuse of discretion standard?
1989.89-275,1,39270,richard_joseph_favretto,,2463.602,2468.073,"Well, it's hard for me to... I... I... I... it's not clear to me--"
1989.89-275,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2468.073,2470.942,"Because if there isn't, then we can say clearly erroneous and you don't care."
1989.89-275,1,39270,richard_joseph_favretto,,2470.942,2476.762,"--Well, I... I... I think the two are very close."
1989.89-275,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2487.952,2489.17,"Well, I... I liked the way you put it earlier."
1989.89-275,1,39270,richard_joseph_favretto,,2495.74,2496.107,That's right.
1989.89-275,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2496.107,2502.227,"But most of these abuse of discretion things have some factual judgments, they have some discretion as to remedy, which are not factual."
1989.89-275,1,39270,richard_joseph_favretto,,2508.281,2509.983,"That's where I come out, Justice Scalia."
1989.89-275,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2509.983,2510.917,But may I ask this?
1989.89-275,1,39270,richard_joseph_favretto,,2517.673,2521.808,I think the trial judge should make clear his basis for his judgment.
1989.89-275,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2521.808,2522.758,"Well, that's not an answer to my question."
1989.89-275,1,39270,richard_joseph_favretto,,2522.758,2527.529,"Well... but if that amounts to findings, then there should be findings."
1989.89-275,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2529.48,2536.884,"See, what I'm concerned about is that... as I read your brief, that your abuse of discretion standard might not require any factual findings."
1989.89-275,1,39270,richard_joseph_favretto,,2553.096,2556.964,"--I... I think if there... again, if there are--"
1989.89-275,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2556.964,2566.92,It seems to me the argument for an abuse of discretion standard is an argument for not being required to make specific factual findings.
1989.89-275,1,39270,richard_joseph_favretto,,2566.92,2578.877,"--I... I would... I would... I would think that a... that a district court should be... should be required to state the reasons, the factual basis, whether they are disputed or undisputed."
1989.89-275,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2605.629,2630.962,"Well, if one were to compare different standards of review and if you were to say clearly erroneous on facts and de novo on law, as opposed to just abusive discussion generally, certainly the abusive discussion standard would spawn less litigation over this subject than this trifurcated type of thing, wouldn't it?"
1989.89-275,1,39270,richard_joseph_favretto,,2630.962,2632.046,No question about that.
1989.89-275,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2709.548,2712.148,Are you going to talk about the award of fees for the appellate litigation?
1989.89-275,1,39270,richard_joseph_favretto,,2712.148,2712.766,"--Oh, yeah."
1989.89-275,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2769.42,2779.443,"Well, did the court below hold that appellate expenses must be awarded in a reasonable amount if the sanction is affirmed?"
1989.89-275,1,39270,richard_joseph_favretto,,2779.443,2786.882,"The court of appeals sent the case back to the district court for... for an award of reasonable appellate expenses, that's correct."
1989.89-275,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2786.882,2789.049,As an automatic sort of thing?
1989.89-275,1,39270,richard_joseph_favretto,,2789.049,2796.837,"As a necessary component of the... of the sanction which was invoked in this case, which was a fee should be sanctioned."
1989.89-275,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2796.837,2805.01,"Well, that certainly is kind of a disincentive to non-frivolous appeals, isn't it?"
1989.89-275,1,39270,richard_joseph_favretto,,2805.01,2805.476,Well--
1989.89-275,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2805.476,2809.045,"I mean, certainly we saw fit to take the case here."
1989.89-275,1,39270,richard_joseph_favretto,,2820.686,2831.993,"--Well, the... the... the inclusion of appellate fees in the sanction award in our view turns upon the invocation by the district court of the fee-shifting aspect of the rule."
1989.89-275,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2868.251,2868.634,Excuse me.
1989.89-275,1,39270,richard_joseph_favretto,,2893.068,2894.801,--He... he may say that.
1989.89-275,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2898.722,2899.105,That's right.
1989.89-275,1,39270,richard_joseph_favretto,,2901.072,2901.59,Under the rule--
1989.89-275,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2901.59,2904.14,"--say just... just costs in the district court, not on appeal?"
1989.89-275,1,39270,richard_joseph_favretto,,2904.14,2912.877,--But we believe that... we believe that Judge Gasch here in the district court explicitly invoked the fee-shifting... the fee-shifting provisions of the rule.
1989.89-275,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2939.194,2940.813,Suppose he said no... no appellate fees?
1989.89-275,1,39270,richard_joseph_favretto,,2940.813,2944.781,"We don't feel... we don't feel he has that discretion at this point, Justice Scalia."
1989.89-275,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2966.463,2973.884,But what... what particular language is it of Rule 11 that you think authorizes the automatic imposition of attorney's fees on appeal?
1989.89-275,1,39270,richard_joseph_favretto,,2973.884,2987.46,"The language that entitles... entitles the adversary, or the victim, to reasonable expenses... and it's including attorney's fees... incurred because of the filing, the improper filing."
1989.89-275,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2991.596,2994.614,And so... and you say the appeal is caused by that?
1989.89-275,1,39270,richard_joseph_favretto,,2994.614,2995.131,Absolutely.
1989.89-275,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2995.131,3001.118,"One... one could equally well argue the appeal was caused by the imposition of sanctions, I suppose."
1989.89-275,1,39270,richard_joseph_favretto,,3001.118,3006.256,"Well, but... but... but the imposition of sanctions is a mandatory... is mandatory in Rule 11."
1989.89-275,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3017.563,3029.287,Do you think our client's attorneys fees in... in opposing the Rule 41 argument should be paid by the other side?
1989.89-275,1,39270,richard_joseph_favretto,,3029.287,3030.721,"Absolutely, Justice White."
1989.89-275,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3030.721,3031.389,"Well, why?"
1989.89-275,1,39270,richard_joseph_favretto,,3032.506,3032.923,Let me--
1989.89-275,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3032.923,3034.275,--Was that a frivolous issue?
1989.89-275,1,39270,richard_joseph_favretto,,3034.275,3034.758,--No.
1989.89-275,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3075.518,3082.606,Suppose that this is... suppose the only issue that went to the court of appeals was the 41?
1989.89-275,1,39270,richard_joseph_favretto,,3082.606,3084.291,--And as well as the--
1989.89-275,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3084.291,3084.708,No.
1989.89-275,1,39270,richard_joseph_favretto,,3084.708,3086.491,--the district court abused its discretion in--
1989.89-275,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3086.491,3086.924,"No, no."
1989.89-275,1,39270,richard_joseph_favretto,,3088.576,3089.242,--Okay.
1989.89-275,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3089.242,3093.646,--They said sanctions shouldn't have been imposed at all because of Rule 41.
1989.89-275,1,39270,richard_joseph_favretto,,3099.633,3112.441,We don't... we think it would have been equally beneficial for society as a whole if the Petitioner here had assessed his chances and felt that his chances were... were a long-shot and had decided not to appeal.
1989.89-275,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3124.583,3132.104,Has... hade any other courts ever held that the Rule 41 bars sanctions after a dismissal?
1989.89-275,1,39270,richard_joseph_favretto,,3132.104,3135.14,"--When... one court, the Second Circuit."
1989.89-275,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3137.14,3137.525,One... one--
1989.89-275,1,39270,richard_joseph_favretto,,3137.525,3137.925,--or eleven.
1989.89-275,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3137.925,3139.908,"--misinformed, badly misinformed federal court?"
1989.89-275,1,39270,richard_joseph_favretto,,3141.044,3143.044,We... we don't find the reasoning persuasive.
1989.89-275,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3143.044,3144.162,"Well, I know."
1989.89-275,1,39270,richard_joseph_favretto,,3153.535,3154.068,Not at all.
1989.89-275,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3167.278,3168.128,"Yes, but suppose there are three issues--"
1989.89-275,1,39270,richard_joseph_favretto,,3168.128,3172.563,"--value the... value the experience of being here, my client didn't want to be here."
1989.89-275,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3172.563,3179.752,"--Yeah, but supposing there's three issues on appeal and you win on two and lose on one, you still get all your fees?"
1989.89-275,1,39270,richard_joseph_favretto,,3185.489,3187.525,If the sanction is sustained--
1989.89-275,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3187.525,3187.858,Sure.
1989.89-275,1,39270,richard_joseph_favretto,,3187.858,3191.31,"--If the sanction is sustained, would--"
1989.89-275,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3191.31,3199.064,"But they say you... you charged too much for your time or you put in your time from the time they showed you the complaint to the time they filed, or something like that, which shouldn't have been done."
1989.89-275,1,39270,richard_joseph_favretto,,3207.503,3213.656,"--Justice Stevens, we... we just want to come out the same place we came out when we went in."
1989.89-275,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3228.233,3238.79,"May I ask in that regard, are you... you entitled to compensation for your attorney's fees for time spent between the time they showed you the complaint and the time they filed it?"
1989.89-275,1,39270,richard_joseph_favretto,,3238.79,3240.14,We... we didn't--
1989.89-275,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3240.14,3241.742,I suppose you went right to work on the case as soon as--
1989.89-275,1,39270,richard_joseph_favretto,,3241.742,3252.115,"--We didn't... no, we didn't see... I... I... I'm not familiar whether or not... what... what those fees amounted to or whether or not... well, what they amounted to."
1989.89-275,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3255.633,3260.971,"--So, what you... any work you did on the complaint before it was filed was... was gratis as far as the plaintiff is concerned?"
1989.89-275,1,39270,richard_joseph_favretto,,3260.971,3262.789,"Oh, absolutely."
1989.89-275,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3263.223,3267.108,Why... why did the district judge cut your fees as badly as he did?
1989.89-275,1,39270,richard_joseph_favretto,,3267.108,3272.762,He... he just felt that we shouldn't have prepared as much as we did for the ultimate class action proceedings.
1989.89-275,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3278.299,3279.416,It's a major frivolous matter.
1989.89-275,1,39270,richard_joseph_favretto,,3280.167,3281.634,"--The motion... well, we thought we were going to prevail."
1989.89-275,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3308.102,3312.637,"Well, how does that [inaudible] this Court to allow sanctions?"
1989.89-275,1,39270,richard_joseph_favretto,,3315.856,3325.362,The... the reasonable amount of the appellate fees incurred because of this original filing should be awarded to us once the--
1989.89-275,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3325.362,3327.528,"--You really treat it as a fee-shifting statute,--"
1989.89-275,1,39270,richard_joseph_favretto,,3327.528,3327.862,--Absolutely.
1989.89-275,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3327.862,3328.212,--don't you?
1989.89-275,1,39270,richard_joseph_favretto,,3328.212,3328.614,Absolutely.
1989.89-275,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3328.614,3330.13,But it doesn't... it doesn't say that.
1989.89-275,1,39270,richard_joseph_favretto,,3330.48,3331.266,It's a sanction.
1989.89-275,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3331.266,3334.301,"--You know, 1988 says the prevailing party--"
1989.89-275,1,39270,richard_joseph_favretto,,3334.301,3334.701,Right.
1989.89-275,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3334.701,3335.651,--gets attorney fees.
1989.89-275,1,39270,richard_joseph_favretto,,3339.67,3341.538,It doesn't have to do with prevailing or not prevailing.
1989.89-275,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3342.138,3344.804,"Well, it's the sanctions... it's the sanctions for someone--"
1989.89-275,1,39270,richard_joseph_favretto,,3344.804,3345.34,--Absolutely.
1989.89-275,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3345.34,3346.073,--and I... I--
1989.89-275,1,39270,richard_joseph_favretto,,3346.073,3347.073,It's a sanction.
1989.89-275,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3347.073,3357.345,--Why should the other side be sanctioned for pressing this Rule 41 problem that they've had perfectly good authority for pressing?
1989.89-275,1,39270,richard_joseph_favretto,,3358.529,3357.345,Don't do it with our money.
1989.89-275,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3360.214,3360.564,No.
1989.89-275,1,39270,richard_joseph_favretto,,3360.564,3363.749,Let us come out as whole as we were when we went in.
1989.89-275,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3365.534,3370.402,"Well, that's... you are just talking like... like just because you win you get your fees."
1989.89-275,1,39270,richard_joseph_favretto,,3370.402,3371.271,--Absolutely not.
1989.89-275,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3376.023,3377.275,"Well, what are we sanctioning for?"
1989.89-275,1,39270,richard_joseph_favretto,,3387.264,3392.018,"There's no... there's no basis for sanctioning and for taking that appeal, or for the conduct of the appeal."
1989.89-275,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3400.708,3401.124,"Yeah, but you're--"
1989.89-275,1,39270,richard_joseph_favretto,,3401.124,3401.791,--the appropriate--
1989.89-275,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3401.791,3410.313,"--But you're going to... you want... you want your fees, including fees for your arguing the Rule 41 issue."
1989.89-275,1,39270,richard_joseph_favretto,,3410.313,3415.217,--My client wants to be no worse off as a consequence of this misconduct--
1989.89-275,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3415.217,3416.067,I don't blame him.
1989.89-275,1,39270,richard_joseph_favretto,,3416.067,3421.121,--than... than he was when the frivolous filing was made.
1989.89-275,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3442.118,3451.473,You made the argument in... in your brief that in the vast majority of cases the fees on appealing these things would be greater than the fees to be recovered from the--
1989.89-275,1,39270,richard_joseph_favretto,,3451.473,3451.74,That's true.
1989.89-275,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3451.74,3453.592,"--especially in a Rule 41 situation, I would assume."
1989.89-275,1,39270,richard_joseph_favretto,,3453.592,3454.075,That's true.
1989.89-275,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3455.592,3459.246,In this particular case is that... do you have any idea whether that's so?
1989.89-275,1,39270,richard_joseph_favretto,,3459.729,3460.746,--It's true in this case as well.
1989.89-275,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3461.812,3469.035,"--But if... if you don't get your appellate... fees for the appellate litigation, you... your client ends up... ends up in the whole, or you do?"
1989.89-275,1,39270,richard_joseph_favretto,,3469.035,3469.402,--Right.
1989.89-275,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3469.402,3469.735,Somebody does.
1989.89-275,1,39270,richard_joseph_favretto,,3469.735,3470.152,That's correct.
