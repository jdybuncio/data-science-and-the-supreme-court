1982.65_orig,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,11.949,"We will hear arguments first this morning in the original jurisdiction case, the State of Texas against the State of New Mexico."
1982.65_orig,0,40619,r_lambeth_townsend,,14.713,22.626,"Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court, this is a suit to enforce the Pecos River Compact."
1982.65_orig,1,20248,charlotte_uram,,1664.728,1692.858,"Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court, Justice Stevens, you asked whether all sides agreed that the Master could make all the necessary determinations, and Mr. Townsend answered yes, and that's correct, except that the parties disagree on the nature of the Court's review and the extent to which it can take action on behalf of the Commission or action that's delegated to the Commission."
1982.65_orig,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1695.018,1705.286,But isn't it true that one of the problems is getting an understanding of some of the basic underlying facts... how much water... how much of the water was flowing in 1947 and so forth?
1982.65_orig,1,20248,charlotte_uram,,1715.143,1715.642,"--No, Your Honor."
1982.65_orig,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1716.894,1717.515,I see.
1982.65_orig,1,20248,charlotte_uram,,1717.515,1725.489,The Court in this case is presented with two very different ways of dealing with disputes from interstate compact agencies.
1982.65_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1758.762,1772.59,"I take it from your brief and what you say that you say we have no more authority to do what Texas suggests or the Master has, that he has no more authority to go forward than we have to appoint a tie-breaker."
1982.65_orig,1,20248,charlotte_uram,,1772.59,1775.702,That's correct... not to do the things that Texas asked.
1982.65_orig,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1789.279,1792.332,"Well, then, how is this problem going to be resolved?"
1982.65_orig,1,20248,charlotte_uram,,1798.867,1802.97,There is something for the Court to review to resolve the dispute.
1982.65_orig,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1899.853,1914.923,"Miss Uram, the Master found that the review of basic data was developed only for the period of 1950 to 1961 and so it does not answer the questions for the future."
1982.65_orig,1,20248,charlotte_uram,,1918.225,1935.677,"That's what the Master said, and the first time he said it was in 1979 in his last report, but at the time that he said it then he also he had not yet reached the consequence of that decision or that issue and indeed there had been no discussion of it before 1979."
1982.65_orig,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1935.677,1952.119,"The United States in its brief also, if I remember correctly, indicated that we certainly can't decide everything based on the review of basic data, that maybe it's a guideline to be employed but that it won't solve all the problems."
1982.65_orig,1,20248,charlotte_uram,,1952.119,1965.145,"The review of basic data may not solve all the problems, but the Master's understanding or ruling that the review of basic data was not to be applied in the future was wrong."
1982.65_orig,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2082.321,2100.254,Basically are you requesting that the Master quantify the water as of 1947 and then provide for annual distribution techniques?
1982.65_orig,1,20248,charlotte_uram,,2100.254,2100.714,No.
1982.65_orig,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2132.165,2143.643,"Well, Miss Uram, what is the authority for your position that the Master and, ultimately, this Court can sit as a reviewing court to review the findings of the Compact agency?"
1982.65_orig,1,20248,charlotte_uram,,2155.732,2157.622,"--You're correct, Your Honor."
1982.65_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2158.413,2165.326,Doesn't the Compact itself say that the determinations of the Commission are reviewable in the Court?
1982.65_orig,1,20248,charlotte_uram,,2165.326,2165.806,--Yes.
1982.65_orig,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2168.588,2169.66,Does it say in what court?
1982.65_orig,1,20248,charlotte_uram,,2169.66,2170.759,No.
1982.65_orig,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2176.643,2181.308,"Well, this would be the first agency, I think, that had its findings directly reviewable in the Supreme Court."
1982.65_orig,1,20248,charlotte_uram,,2181.308,2183.338,"That's probably true, Your Honor."
1982.65_orig,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2240.326,2250.143,Do these more recent compacts that you refer to which specify agency authority and court review specify the court in which the review shall take place?
1982.65_orig,1,20248,charlotte_uram,,2250.143,2251.703,"In some instances, they do."
1982.65_orig,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2268.323,2270.396,"Neither specify this Court, I take it."
1982.65_orig,1,20248,charlotte_uram,,2270.396,2272.527,I don't recall that they do.
1982.65_orig,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2311.362,2312.982,What standard of review?
1982.65_orig,1,20248,charlotte_uram,,2317.617,2327.902,"--Well, the standard... I would think the appropriate standard would be the one that the Court used to apply before it had statutes such as the Administrative Procedure Act."
1982.65_orig,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2352.91,2360.574,But isn't it true that all the examples you give are situations in which there is a neutral factfinder or a neutral administrative law judge of some kind to start with?
1982.65_orig,1,20248,charlotte_uram,,2375.564,2377.875,"Well, we have here a special situation."
1982.65_orig,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2384.2,2389.305,It seems to me one of the initial problems is you have a lot of decisions that haven't even been made in the first instance.
1982.65_orig,1,20248,charlotte_uram,,2389.305,2392.925,"--Oh, well, you see, Your Honor, the situation is really a little simpler than it looks."
1982.65_orig,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2401.33,2405.214,You identified four specific controversies that remain unresolved.
1982.65_orig,1,20248,charlotte_uram,,2405.214,2405.945,Yes.
1982.65_orig,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2405.945,2413.157,"Now is it possible that the Master could, if he felt himself qualified to do so, could have decided each of those four issues?"
1982.65_orig,1,20248,charlotte_uram,,2413.157,2414.149,Yes.
1982.65_orig,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2415.01,2416.59,"Well, why do we have to worry about administrative review?"
1982.65_orig,1,20248,charlotte_uram,,2419.893,2427.627,"--Well, because Texas says that... Texas tells the Court not to look at those four issues any more but to choose another method."
1982.65_orig,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2427.627,2432.151,"Well, he agreed a few minutes ago that the Master simply hadn't decided some things that would have moved the case along."
1982.65_orig,1,20248,charlotte_uram,,2432.151,2432.963,That's correct.
1982.65_orig,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2432.963,2434.662,You seem to be saying the same thing.
1982.65_orig,1,20248,charlotte_uram,,2434.662,2436.643,We say the Master--
1982.65_orig,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2436.643,2437.795,You identify different issues.
1982.65_orig,1,20248,charlotte_uram,,2440.817,2443.248,--We agree on the same four issues.
1982.65_orig,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2454.435,2458.398,"But they also have an alternative position, that even if he doesn't buy the double mass analysis argument, go ahead and use the routing approach."
1982.65_orig,1,20248,charlotte_uram,,2458.398,2458.999,That's correct.
1982.65_orig,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2460.199,2460.93,And you won't get either.
1982.65_orig,1,20248,charlotte_uram,,2460.93,2470.768,Because New Mexico says after you've made this basic decision the dispute will be resolved and the matter should go back to the Commission for administration.
1982.65_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2484.808,2486.738,"Well, has the Commission already decided all those four?"
1982.65_orig,1,20248,charlotte_uram,,2489.841,2492.222,--The Commission adopted the review of basic data.
1982.65_orig,2,40619,r_lambeth_townsend,,3326.208,3329.069,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1982.65_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3418.89,3426.113,So you think any determination of the Commission would be subject to de novo determination in a court.
1982.65_orig,2,40619,r_lambeth_townsend,,3426.113,3440.243,"According to its express terms, it would be prima facie evidence and the party would have an opportunity to rebut and to contradict findings of the Commission."
1982.65_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3440.243,3442.284,So you wouldn't review it on the record?
1982.65_orig,2,40619,r_lambeth_townsend,,3442.284,3443.463,You would not review it on the record.
1982.65_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3465.439,3466.351,Tell me.
1982.65_orig,2,40619,r_lambeth_townsend,,3485.972,3489.205,The disagreement started--
