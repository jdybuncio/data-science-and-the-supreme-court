2019.18-587,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,11.84,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 18-587, the Department of Homeland Security versus Regents of the University of California, and the related cases. General Francisco."
2019.18-587,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,11.84,24.0,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In 2017, the Fifth Circuit held that DAPA and the expansion of DACA were likely unlawful, a judgment this Court affirmed by an equally divided Court."
2019.18-587,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,143.56,169.6,"General Francisco, there's a strange element to your argument because you're arguing this is a discretionary matter; it's not reviewable because it's committed to agency discretion. But, on the other hand, you say the agency had no discretion because this program was illegal."
2019.18-587,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,182.92,184.32,"For two reasons, Your Honor."
2019.18-587,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,216.28,217.04,What's your --
2019.18-587,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,217.04,217.76,"But, secondly --"
2019.18-587,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,217.76,219.0,"Oh, I'm sorry. Go ahead."
2019.18-587,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,219.0,238.6,"Secondly, even if we were making purely a legal argument, and we're not, but even if we were, review would be foreclosed by this Court's decision in BLE. What the BLE case held was that if an action is committed to an agency's unreviewable discretion, then it doesn't matter what reason it gives for taking that action; it's still unreviewable."
2019.18-587,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,259.36,268.44,"What if the Attorney General said he, in his exercise of prosecutorial discretion, was not going to enforce any of the immigration laws?"
2019.18-587,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,268.44,268.64,Uh --
2019.18-587,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,268.64,270.32,Would that still be non-reviewable?
2019.18-587,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,270.32,279.12,"Your Honor, then I think that you might run into Chaney's exception for a complete abdication of authority, but there's a critical difference between that and this."
2019.18-587,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,325.16,326.12,Was DACA --
2019.18-587,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,326.12,340.72,"Just to -- just to understand what you're saying, General, you -- that would suggest that the original DACA is reviewable, but the rescission of DACA is not. In other words, are you suggesting that there's an asymmetry in what's reviewable?"
2019.18-587,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,340.72,340.88,There --
2019.18-587,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,340.88,342.36,That they don't stand and fall together?
2019.18-587,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,342.36,346.12,"Yeah, there is, because there's a difference in the two policies."
2019.18-587,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,433.88,434.4,Can I go back --
2019.18-587,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,434.4,435.96,-- from enforcing the laws we pass.
2019.18-587,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,435.96,452.96,"The response that you -- that you gave to me, I didn't see -- I thought that what you call it, the Duke Memorandum, Duke Memorandum said DACA is illegal."
2019.18-587,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,464.96,466.08,Uh-huh.
2019.18-587,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,466.44,467.84,I didn't see that.
2019.18-587,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,467.84,468.56,Yeah.
2019.18-587,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,468.56,470.96,You said there were alternate arguments.
2019.18-587,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,480.8,482.44,"So two responses, Your Honor."
2019.18-587,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,535.08,538.6,"I thought the point -- I mean, this is an old argument."
2019.18-587,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,538.6,539.0,Yeah.
2019.18-587,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,539.0,541.08,And there have been two bases.
2019.18-587,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,565.04,565.36,Right.
2019.18-587,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,565.36,591.36,"Okay? That isn't here, I don't think. The Chaney argument, I thought was the reason this is unreviewable, is because there's a long history and tradition of a prosecutor saying, I know that guy over there, or that woman here, and they may be guilty, but, in my discretion, no, I don't want to prosecute them. There's a long history of that."
2019.18-587,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,591.36,591.36,Uh-huh.
2019.18-587,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,591.36,600.72,"And if that history, an understandable power to give to a prosecutor, is to be valid, courts, stay out of it."
2019.18-587,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,611.08,611.64,Right.
2019.18-587,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,611.64,622.84,"-- generalized, written down, and I can't think of a reason why in such a case you wouldn't review it in a court."
2019.18-587,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,622.84,641.56,"So, respectfully, Your Honor, I strongly disagree because Chaney itself involved not a prosecutor but an agency and not a single shot enforcement action but a general policy. Here's what the FDA said in the letter denying the petition brought by the inmates to have it regulate the state exercise of the death penalty."
2019.18-587,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,643.04,643.4,Yeah.
2019.18-587,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,643.4,657.56,"""For the reasons given below, we conclude that the use of lethal injection by state penal systems is a practice over which FDA has no jurisdiction and, therefore, that FDA has no authority to take the actions your petition requests."
2019.18-587,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,715.84,722.72,"Wouldn't what -- wouldn't what you just read also have made DACA itself unreviewable, to pick up on Justice Kagan's question from earlier?"
2019.18-587,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,722.72,727.12,"No, Your Honor, and, again, because, critically, it falls within --"
2019.18-587,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,727.12,730.56,What -- what's the distinction between DACA and the FDA policy?
2019.18-587,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,730.56,732.76,"Oh, the DACA and the FDA policy?"
2019.18-587,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,732.76,733.2,Yeah.
2019.18-587,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,733.2,740.44,"Well, because, in the FDA policy, nobody was claiming that somehow a statute restricted the FDA's ability to not enforce the law."
2019.18-587,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,755.8,756.12,"Well, one of the --"
2019.18-587,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,756.12,756.6,"And, again --"
2019.18-587,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,756.6,782.8,"-- things that -- one of the things that Texas argued in the DAPA case was that the agency action in question there conferred certain benefits on the individuals who were affected. And if that was sufficient to make that reviewable, does the wind-down of DACA remove certain benefits that individuals would have?"
2019.18-587,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,782.8,783.16,Right.
2019.18-587,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,783.16,785.36,"And, if it does, would that make this reviewable?"
2019.18-587,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,785.36,788.68,I -- I -- I think the answer is no and no.
2019.18-587,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,897.04,897.36,General --
2019.18-587,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,897.36,898.08,-- that it passes.
2019.18-587,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,898.08,904.64,"-- are you -- is this an appropriate moment to move to, assuming reviewability, the merits?"
2019.18-587,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,904.64,906.04,"Any time you want to move there, Your Honor --"
2019.18-587,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,906.04,906.6,All right.
2019.18-587,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,906.6,907.72,-- I'll move there.
2019.18-587,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,907.72,924.24,"One -- one -- one argument that the other side makes along those lines is similar to this one we've just been considering, the reliance interests that have grown up around DACA. And what do -- what do you say to that and whether they've been adequately considered in this case?"
2019.18-587,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,924.24,924.96,Sure.
2019.18-587,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,969.12,969.6,May I ask --
2019.18-587,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,969.6,969.84,If I --
2019.18-587,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,969.84,970.36,I'm sorry.
2019.18-587,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,970.36,970.88,I'm sorry.
2019.18-587,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,970.88,972.52,"No, no, continue."
2019.18-587,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,972.52,973.52,Thank you.
2019.18-587,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1001.52,1001.64,So --
2019.18-587,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1001.64,1003.96,"As I understand that, that's the nature of the argument."
2019.18-587,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1003.96,1004.56,Right.
2019.18-587,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1080.76,1101.72,"If I could continue the same question because, look, the best statement of the law in my mind -- this is a very old principle -- again, was Justice Scalia's writing for the Court in Fox. He says, when an agency's ""prior policy has engendered serious reliance interests, it must be taken into account."" All right."
2019.18-587,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1103.44,1103.72,Uh-huh.
2019.18-587,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1103.72,1104.04,All right.
2019.18-587,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1110.56,1110.92,Right.
2019.18-587,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1110.92,1112.2,-- they've never been anywhere else.
2019.18-587,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1150.56,1150.68,Uh-huh.
2019.18-587,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1150.68,1155.24,"And they all list reliance interests, or most of them list interest reliance --"
2019.18-587,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1155.24,1155.64,Right.
2019.18-587,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1155.64,1166.4,"-- interests applicable to them, which are not quite the same, they are not quite the same as those of the 700,000 who have never seen any other country."
2019.18-587,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1169.48,1170.08,Uh-huh.
2019.18-587,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1170.08,1178.8,Now you want to say anything about the statement you just read to me being adequate to take into account that broad range of interests?
2019.18-587,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1178.8,1203.76,"Yes, Your Honor, I do, because the first thing I want to say is that State Farm itself says, and, here, I've got the quote, you violate the APA only where you ""entirely fail to consider an important aspect of the problem."" Here, Secretary Nielsen explicitly considered the reliance interests, including all of the things that you just listed that were set forth in -- in excruciating detail in the numerous district court decisions that have ruled -- had ruled against us --"
2019.18-587,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1203.76,1204.08,But -- but not --
2019.18-587,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1204.08,1204.96,-- which she says --
2019.18-587,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1204.96,1205.08,-- but not in her --
2019.18-587,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1205.08,1206.4,-- she specifically considered.
2019.18-587,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1206.4,1207.16,-- but not in her memo.
2019.18-587,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1207.16,1209.56,"Well, Your Honor, I, frankly, think that she does."
2019.18-587,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1231.12,1232.48,Just -- just back --
2019.18-587,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1232.48,1233.24,If --
2019.18-587,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1233.24,1236.44,-- DACA program would have had.
2019.18-587,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1236.44,1236.96,Go ahead.
2019.18-587,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1236.96,1238.08,Go ahead. (Laughter.)
2019.18-587,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1238.08,1239.08,"I'll take either one, Your Honor. (Laughter.)"
2019.18-587,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1239.08,1267.4,"If -- if I understand Secretary Nielsen's memo correctly, Secretary Nielsen said that she -- she did have a -- a conclusory statement about weighing the reliance interests, but she weighs them against what she calls -- I think it's the questionable legality of the program. Now that assumes one of the things that we're all here to discuss, which is that the program was of questionable legality."
2019.18-587,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1283.84,1284.56,Sure.
2019.18-587,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1310.08,1310.36,But in her --
2019.18-587,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1310.36,1311.68,-- is a separate and independent basis.
2019.18-587,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1311.68,1318.6,"-- in her statement about reliance, she particularly says it outweighs this questionably legal program."
2019.18-587,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1318.6,1341.28,"I think what she is saying here is that it outweighs -- is that, given that there are extremely limited reliance interests in the first place, any limited reliance interests that exist are outweighed -- are -- are outweighed by all of the different reasons that she has articulated as separate and independent grounds for rescinding DACA. I think that's the only fair way --"
2019.18-587,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1341.28,1341.68,General --
2019.18-587,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1341.68,1343.72,-- that you can read that memorandum.
2019.18-587,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1343.72,1351.6,-- I'm -- I have always had some difficulty in understanding the illegality of DACA.
2019.18-587,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1356.32,1356.64,Right.
2019.18-587,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1356.64,1366.52,-- there was actually a process for attaining a pathway to residency.
2019.18-587,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1375.96,1376.2,Uh-huh.
2019.18-587,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1376.2,1387.2,But there -- I don't see anything in the INA that takes away the discretion of the agency in ordering its enforcement policies.
2019.18-587,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1387.2,1387.4,Right.
2019.18-587,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1387.4,1390.36,We all know it has limited resources.
2019.18-587,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1394.52,1394.76,Uh-huh.
2019.18-587,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1394.76,1400.04,-- remove the vast majority of aliens we have here.
2019.18-587,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1413.12,1413.72,Right.
2019.18-587,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1413.72,1431.24,"-- who haven't committed crimes, who are lawfully employed, who are paying taxes, who pose no threat to our security, and there's a whole list of prerequisites, we're not going to exercise our limited resources --"
2019.18-587,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1431.24,1431.48,Yeah.
2019.18-587,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1431.48,1434.32,-- to try to get rid of those people.
2019.18-587,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1440.08,1440.28,Sure.
2019.18-587,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1442.68,1442.76,All right.
2019.18-587,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1444.32,1444.6,"Oh, sure."
2019.18-587,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1444.6,1445.32,Okay?
2019.18-587,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1445.32,1445.72,Yeah.
2019.18-587,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1445.72,1500.08,"So putting aside that, the Secretary, in giving these extra reasons, because none of this was in the Duke memo, and I thought basic administrative law is you look at what's first given to you, not what this -- you add later, but assuming you ignore that and even look at the Nielsen memo, I think my colleagues have rightly pointed there's a whole lot of reliance interests that weren't looked at, including the very President of -- current President telling DACA-eligible people that they were safe under him and that he would find a way to keep them here. And so he hasn't and, instead, he's done this."
2019.18-587,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1506.0,1506.36,Right.
2019.18-587,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1506.36,1509.24,Not just say I'll give you six months to do it --
2019.18-587,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1509.24,1509.6,Right.
2019.18-587,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1510.0,1511.32,-- to destroy your lives.
2019.18-587,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1511.32,1511.48,So --
2019.18-587,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1511.48,1515.68,Putting all of that aside -- and I'm going to get to my question. (Laughter.)
2019.18-587,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1515.68,1519.52,And maybe we'd have an opportunity to hear the three answers.
2019.18-587,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1519.52,1520.76,"Well, don't forget the three."
2019.18-587,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1527.88,1528.88,"Sure, Your Honor."
2019.18-587,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1528.88,1534.68,Where -- where is all of this really considered and weighed?
2019.18-587,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1534.68,1534.92,So --
2019.18-587,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1534.92,1539.56,And where is the political decision made clearly?
2019.18-587,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1539.56,1540.68,So -- so I --
2019.18-587,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1540.68,1545.72,That this is not about the law; this is about our choice to destroy lives?
2019.18-587,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1545.72,1546.44,Yeah.
2019.18-587,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1551.2,1565.08,"The first one is that I -- I think that the prior President didn't, couldn't, and hasn't made any kind of promise that DACA would remain in effect in perpetuity because it would have been impossible to make that promise."
2019.18-587,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1622.36,1630.24,"But don't you have to -- don't you have to set up some kind of categories? I mean, everybody agrees, what is that, how many, 11 million people?"
2019.18-587,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1630.24,1630.48,Right.
2019.18-587,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1630.48,1633.68,"They don't have the resources, so you have to prioritize."
2019.18-587,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1635.36,1636.12,"Absolutely, Your Honor."
2019.18-587,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1636.12,1639.0,How do you -- how do you do it other than categorically?
2019.18-587,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1639.0,1640.36,"Well, and that's my second point, Your Honor."
2019.18-587,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1673.0,1685.84,"So the -- the forbearance would be okay if it -- there weren't attendant benefits? This -- we're not going to -- we're not going to immediately deport the Dreamers, period?"
2019.18-587,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1685.84,1699.72,"I think that would be -- if -- if you provided just the advanced forbearance, I think that would be a lot closer of a question, but, here, it's a lot easier because you're coupling that with work authorization. And my final and critical point is that there's no limiting principle."
2019.18-587,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1719.76,1720.8,"Well -- well, if --"
2019.18-587,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1720.8,1721.76,-- I don't think you --
2019.18-587,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1721.76,1734.16,"You know, the INA does give quite a lot of discretion to administrative officers, as you yourself admit and have argued on previous occasions and, indeed, in part here."
2019.18-587,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1734.16,1734.52,Right.
2019.18-587,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1734.52,1747.4,So are you saying that -- are you saying that DACA was -- violated any particular provision of the INA? What are you saying it violated?
2019.18-587,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1747.4,1747.48,Sure.
2019.18-587,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1747.48,1747.84,Because --
2019.18-587,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1747.84,1748.4,So I'm saying --
2019.18-587,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1748.4,1753.4,"-- because there's a big delegation, right, that says you get to make national policy."
2019.18-587,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1755.88,1757.36,"I'm saying two things, Your Honor."
2019.18-587,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1761.52,1761.96,I got that.
2019.18-587,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1761.96,1767.68,"-- reasons are more than sufficient. But, secondly, we're not saying that there's a specific provision that it conflicts with."
2019.18-587,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1778.12,1778.56,"Well, they did --"
2019.18-587,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1778.56,1779.12,And this goes --
2019.18-587,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1779.12,1786.12,"-- you know, they located the authority in the INA's grant of broad discretion over national immigration enforcement policy."
2019.18-587,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1786.12,1803.36,"Your Honor, I think that the most that does is it gives you the authority to set policies and priorities, but there's a big leap between that and saying that you can affirmatively facilitate violations of the INA by hundreds of thousands of individuals to whom Congress has repeatedly declined a pathway to lawful status."
2019.18-587,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1803.36,1803.8,What about --
2019.18-587,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1803.8,1804.2,I guess --
2019.18-587,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1804.2,1830.48,"Again, though, I -- I don't think this is an issue you need to ultimately resolve because I think the other reasons we've given for rescinding DACA are more than sufficient to justify it, including our serious doubts about its legality alone. Simply as a matter of law enforcement policy, it is eminently reasonable for a law enforcement agency to say, I'm not going to push this doubtful authority to its logical extreme when it does three things: It undermines confidence in the rule of law itself."
2019.18-587,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1840.36,1840.96,"Counsel, you --"
2019.18-587,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1840.96,1842.04,-- the agency's control.
2019.18-587,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1842.04,1850.88,"-- if -- if DACA was illegal, that means that when the government was giving out these benefits it was acting illegally, right?"
2019.18-587,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1850.88,1851.36,Yes.
2019.18-587,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1851.36,1879.0,"Now it's not always the case when the government acts illegally in a way that affects other people that we go back and untangle all of the consequences of that. Did Secretary Nielsen, when she was considering the reliance interests, was she looking simply to the question of a wind-down, or was she looking more generally, for example, to the application of something like the de facto officer doctrine --"
2019.18-587,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1879.0,1879.32,Right.
2019.18-587,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1879.72,1884.88,"-- when officers acted illegally, but we don't go back and invalidate their prior actions?"
2019.18-587,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1884.88,1887.8,"I think both, Your Honor, both."
2019.18-587,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1919.84,1937.08,"So now the basic -- the basic hornbook rule -- we have three hornbook rules in this case, is -- is -- was mentioned, Chenery: ""It is a foundational principle of administrative law that a court may uphold agency action only on the grounds that the agency invoked when it took the action."""
2019.18-587,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1937.08,1937.44,Right.
2019.18-587,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1937.44,1941.52,"In which case we look to Ms. Duke's memo, not to Ms. Nielsen's."
2019.18-587,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1963.36,1964.24,For two related --
2019.18-587,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1964.24,1964.8,"With very -- yeah, go ahead."
2019.18-587,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1964.8,1965.88,"For two related reasons, Your Honor."
2019.18-587,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1965.88,1966.12,Yeah.
2019.18-587,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1966.12,1970.76,"First, sending it back would make no sense because the agency has already acted."
2019.18-587,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1991.4,1992.52,Not reinstate it.
2019.18-587,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1992.52,1992.92,"Well, but -- but --"
2019.18-587,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1992.92,2015.64,"What you do is, there are 50 cases on this, if it's important, what you do is you say it is good reason for holding the status quo until we can go back, and courts have affirmed that, we hold the status quo, and we go back now and we look if there are reasons beyond the contemporaneous reason, which is the Duke memo."
2019.18-587,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,2015.64,2016.4,"Well, that's --"
2019.18-587,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2016.4,2017.2,And we see if there will --
2019.18-587,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,2017.2,2020.4,-- that's precisely what Secretary Nielsen's memo did.
2019.18-587,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2031.96,2038.24,You mean we have all these 100 and 350 briefs with all these different reasons and she had that in front of her?
2019.18-587,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,2038.24,2046.08,"Your Honor, that may go to whether you think her memo is sufficient, but it doesn't go to whether you think her memo is an operative document with this -- in this litigation."
2019.18-587,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2083.88,2098.0,"Can I pick up on Justice Kagan's question earlier? Does the Nielsen memo ever say, even if DACA was lawful, I would still exercise my policy discretion to discontinue?"
2019.18-587,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,2098.0,2099.92,"Yes, Your Honor. So, if you look at the memo --"
2019.18-587,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2099.92,2101.8,What -- what -- what sentence are you looking at?
2019.18-587,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,2101.8,2102.24,Okay.
2019.18-587,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2132.44,2135.68,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Olson."
2019.18-587,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2135.68,2247.48,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The government's termination of DACA triggered abrupt, tangible, adverse consequences and substantial disruptions in the lives of 700,000 individuals, their families, employers, communities, and Armed Forces. That decision required the government to provide an accurate, reasoned, rational, and legally sound explanation. It utterly failed to do so, asserting only the Attorney General's unexplained assertion that he had no discretion because DACA was an unconstitutional exercise of authority by the executive branch. The decision overturned a five-year enforcement policy of deferred action that had enabled DACA recipients under other unchallenged laws and regulations to apply for employment authorization, seek driver's licenses, and other benefits. Its abrupt reversal removed a condition precedent to these rights and exposed DACA recipients and their employers to immediate, potential, coercive government measures. It was impermissible to do so based on an unexplained, unsupported, and erroneous legal conclusion that the policy that two administrations had enforced and implemented, had supported and implemented for five years, was unlawful and unconstitutional. The decision to rescind DACA was reviewable."
2019.18-587,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2307.44,2328.24,"Would you say that whenever a law enforcement agency has guidelines for the exercise of prosecutorial discretion and it then tightens those guidelines so that cases that previously would not have been prosecuted may now be prosecuted, that is agency action that is subject to review under the APA?"
2019.18-587,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2328.24,2330.32,"I would not say that, Justice Alito."
2019.18-587,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2371.2,2371.84,"Well, I'm not sure --"
2019.18-587,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2371.84,2372.12,-- out of 11 --
2019.18-587,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2372.12,2376.84,"-- I'm not sure that really responds to my question, so I'll give you an example."
2019.18-587,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2407.52,2408.32,"No, I don't think it would be."
2019.18-587,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2408.32,2409.48,"What is -- well, what's the difference?"
2019.18-587,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2409.48,2444.44,"Well, I think that the Justice Department, through the attorney general, every new attorney general establishes new enforcement priorities with respect to pornography or drug cases or things like that. Those -- that's completely different than this, which singled out a category of persons and, pursuant to congressional authorization, invited them into the program, provided other statutes which have not been challenged by the government, provided benefits that were associated with that decision, and other people -- and individuals relied upon that for five years."
2019.18-587,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2466.2,2471.12,But you're -- you're saying it's reviewable because DACA conferred certain benefits.
2019.18-587,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2471.12,2472.16,DACA did not confer --
2019.18-587,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2472.16,2474.52,Beyond deferred prosecution.
2019.18-587,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2474.52,2474.88,DACA --
2019.18-587,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2474.88,2476.92,Is that -- is that what you just said?
2019.18-587,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2476.92,2506.48,"DACA -- no, I said the benefits were conferred -- were triggered by the decision of enforcement policy in DACA, but those benefits are triggered by other statutes enacted by Congress, funded by Congress throughout all this entire period of time, and the government hasn't challenged those. So those benefits, the driver's license business and the -- and the work authorization, if you apply for it, if you come forward, identify yourself, put yourself into the program, take risks --"
2019.18-587,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2506.48,2512.68,"But, Mr. Olson, the whole thing was about work authorization and these other benefits."
2019.18-587,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2530.4,2530.92,Yeah.
2019.18-587,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2530.92,2539.6,"So I don't understand sort of putting what the policy really was about, which is the work authorization and the other things, off to one side is very helpful."
2019.18-587,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2539.6,2551.48,"Well, I think that it -- you -- one has to focus on the fact that this was -- Congress authorized the IN -- the Department of Homeland Security to identify enforcement priorities."
2019.18-587,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2663.56,2670.88,"Mr. Olson, I -- I think you've moved on to the merits, and I -- I guess I'm still struggling with Justice Alito's question on -- on reviewability."
2019.18-587,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2700.72,2701.48,Heckler --
2019.18-587,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2701.48,2703.72,-- what's the -- what's the limiting legal principle --
2019.18-587,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2703.72,2704.2,"Well, there's a --"
2019.18-587,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2704.2,2705.24,-- you'd have this Court adopt?
2019.18-587,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2705.24,2715.04,"-- it's a composite -- in this case, it's a composite of principles, a determination that -- a categorical determination involving a substantial number of people --"
2019.18-587,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2715.04,2715.24,Okay.
2019.18-587,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2715.44,2715.92,-- to make decisions --
2019.18-587,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2715.92,2716.2,-- I think --
2019.18-587,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2716.2,2716.96,-- based upon that.
2019.18-587,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2716.96,2717.28,All right.
2019.18-587,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2741.88,2742.36,Yes.
2019.18-587,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2742.36,2745.16,"-- and you're not -- you -- you, I think, would not have us review those decisions."
2019.18-587,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2745.16,2747.48,"That's -- no, but may I refer to --"
2019.18-587,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2747.48,2751.16,"So, if it's not categorical and it's not a large number of people --"
2019.18-587,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2751.16,2751.32,Well --
2019.18-587,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2751.32,2753.08,-- what's the limiting principle?
2019.18-587,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2753.08,2770.44,"-- there -- as I said, it's a combination of factors which include the government inviting people to rely upon and make decisions based upon that policy, the provision of benefits connected with it, individuals making choices, and -- and then -- and the Heckler case --"
2019.18-587,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2770.44,2770.76,Don't -- don't other --
2019.18-587,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2770.76,2771.4,MR. OlSON: -- specifically --
2019.18-587,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2771.4,2788.0,"-- people rely on the attorney general guidance memos and documents? There's an entire industry in a lot of states involving marijuana that would argue they're relying on memos issued by the attorney general that we will not enforce marijuana laws, for example."
2019.18-587,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2790.6,2792.36,"No, I think that is completely different."
2019.18-587,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2798.76,2799.32,"Well, they --"
2019.18-587,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2799.32,2800.08,-- of benefits --
2019.18-587,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2800.08,2813.24,"-- have a lot of economic interests at stake that, I think, under Fox and -- what we heard about earlier from Justice Breyer, they would say our economic interests are very real, billions of dollars are at stake, we've relied on the attorney general's guidance memos."
2019.18-587,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2813.24,2821.72,But there's -- but there -- but -- and I just would like to quote this one paragraph -- or one sentence from the Heckler versus Chaney decision itself.
2019.18-587,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2838.56,2842.12,Doesn't every prosecutorial decision affect individual liberty or property?
2019.18-587,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2842.12,2845.24,Prosecution -- prosecutorial --
2019.18-587,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2845.24,2846.52,"I think the answer is yes, isn't it?"
2019.18-587,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2846.52,2850.04,"Prosecutorial decisions, yes, of course."
2019.18-587,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2850.04,2850.28,Okay.
2019.18-587,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2850.28,2861.4,"This is a -- an announcement of a policy -- this is a reversal of a policy that the government created that triggered -- to use the words of this Court, engendered reliance interests."
2019.18-587,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2902.2,2907.12,"Well, if I might ask a question about that if we're talking about the merits then, and then I -- I'll pass off the baton."
2019.18-587,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2940.08,2941.56,It's -- it's what this Court has said --
2019.18-587,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2941.56,2944.88,"What do you say to -- what do you say to that? And that's the line of argument, as I understand it, from the government."
2019.18-587,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2944.88,2945.72,"Yes, I know it is."
2019.18-587,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2967.04,2967.64,I -- I understand that.
2019.18-587,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2979.92,2980.28,We don't --
2019.18-587,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2980.28,2981.24,-- explanation serve?
2019.18-587,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2981.24,2983.2,-- we don't know what the administration would do.
2019.18-587,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2991.72,2993.96,I guess I'm asking about the reliance interests question.
2019.18-587,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2993.96,2995.0,I -- I'm trying to get to that.
2019.18-587,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2995.0,2996.64,I -- I wish -- I wish you would.
2019.18-587,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2996.64,3010.08,"The reliance interests were triggered, to use the words of this Court in the Fox case, the LTV case, and various other cases, those reliance interests were engendered by the decision by the government that caused people to come forward --"
2019.18-587,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3010.08,3021.88,"I understand that. The question is: What more would you have the government say about those reliance interests? If it's a failure of adequacy of explaining, what more is left to be said?"
2019.18-587,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3021.88,3050.24,"What -- what they could have said is that we understand all of these people, working for all these people, we understand what people are going through, provide a reasoned, rational explanation, to use the words of this Court just a few months ago in the Census case, to explain those things, to explain why a policy is being changed and make a contemporaneous decision. The Nielsen memorandum came along nine months later, was based upon a different individual -- by a different individual."
2019.18-587,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3050.24,3050.44,But --
2019.18-587,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3050.44,3053.4,It didn't have an administrative record.
2019.18-587,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3053.4,3056.0,"Assuming -- well, go ahead and finish."
2019.18-587,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3056.0,3058.52,"Well, well, it'll take another sentence or two."
2019.18-587,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3072.28,3091.24,"But the Nielsen memo then goes on to say, as you heard Mr. Francisco say to my question, that regardless of whether these concerns about the DACA policy rendered it illegal or legally questionable, there are sound reasons of enforcement policy to rescind the DACA policy. And it goes on to explain the policy rationales to rescind it."
2019.18-587,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3091.8,3091.8,Well --
2019.18-587,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3091.8,3092.92,-- response to Mr. Francisco?
2019.18-587,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3092.92,3095.08,"-- in the first place, they were not independent."
2019.18-587,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3098.72,3098.92,She --
2019.18-587,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3098.92,3099.08,They were not --
2019.18-587,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3099.08,3101.52,-- she says -- she says they're independent in that sentence.
2019.18-587,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3101.52,3102.56,She says they're independent.
2019.18-587,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3102.56,3104.92,At least that's what Mr. Francisco says to you.
2019.18-587,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3104.92,3112.36,"Well, Mr. Francisco said that and she said that, but they weren't independent because she was bound by the Attorney General's decision."
2019.18-587,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3129.36,3129.96,Mr. Olson --
2019.18-587,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3129.96,3131.28,That's basically all it was.
2019.18-587,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3134.6,3135.08,Right.
2019.18-587,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3136.28,3139.68,-- is like a rubber stamp that the agencies can put on anything.
2019.18-587,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3142.76,3146.72,Do you -- do you agree that the executive has the legal authority to rescind DACA?
2019.18-587,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3146.72,3147.44,Yes.
2019.18-587,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3147.44,3147.96,Okay.
2019.18-587,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3156.28,3159.28,"Well, it wasn't -- it -- first of all, it was not explained --"
2019.18-587,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3159.28,3179.08,"Just -- can I just ask the question in this way, which is, assume the Nielsen memo comes in and assume it comes down to whether the Nielsen memo adequately explained the reliance interests. What was the shortfall in the Nielsen memo in addressing reliance interests? Because she does acknowledge that a lot of people have relied."
2019.18-587,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3179.84,3180.84,And she --
2019.18-587,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3180.84,3181.36,-- briefly.
2019.18-587,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3181.36,3182.72,"Yeah, she says just too bad."
2019.18-587,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3195.56,3196.44,Do you -- do you think --
2019.18-587,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3196.44,3196.68,This is a new --
2019.18-587,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3196.68,3205.68,-- do you think you could explain the reliance or the justifications for the policy in a way that would overcome the reliance interests?
2019.18-587,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3205.68,3208.36,"They would -- yes, I -- I believe that that's possible."
2019.18-587,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3220.04,3263.2,"Mr. Olson, can I go back to something Justice Gorsuch asked, which is what's the benefit of delaying this further? It has been -- at least looking at the deferred action decisions, the dozens that have gone on through the decades, Congress has responded, sometimes changing the policy, sometimes limiting it, sometimes expanding it. It -- it has responded. But the dynamic is very different, isn't it, when an executive says, I don't have the power, and when it says, even if I had the power --"
2019.18-587,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3263.2,3264.16,Hypothetical.
2019.18-587,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3264.16,3266.88,-- I choose not to do this.
2019.18-587,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3273.4,3274.12,Exactly.
2019.18-587,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3301.76,3316.08,"That's your point about given the Attorney General decision and the law that says they have to change it. That's a very different circumstance than saying, even if I don't have to, I won't."
2019.18-587,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3316.08,3317.32,That's exactly right.
2019.18-587,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3335.0,3337.36,"Mr. Olson, I -- I understand that litany."
2019.18-587,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3368.84,3369.28,Well --
2019.18-587,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3369.28,3373.24,"-- every -- every factor, every basis."
2019.18-587,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3373.24,3374.32,Certainly.
2019.18-587,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3374.32,3396.68,"If they explained and provided a rational explanation instead of just pushing a button or putting a rubber stamp on it, that's what judicial review is all about. That means the agency would have taken responsibility for making the consequences of those decisions, explaining why it thought about it and why it decided what to do. That's what your decisions require by judicial review."
2019.18-587,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3396.68,3398.76,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Mongan."
2019.18-587,2,63183,michael_j_mongan,,3398.76,3425.2,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: It was up to Petitioners to decide how to frame their decision to terminate DACA."
2019.18-587,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3601.96,3608.84,"Well, that -- that history is not close to the number of people covered by DACA."
2019.18-587,2,63183,michael_j_mongan,,3608.84,3626.04,"Well, Your Honor, there's a history of class-based deferred action policies, and they are narrower, to be sure, but there are other class-based policies that have applied to hundreds of thousands of individuals. The family fairness policy, when announced, would have applied to up to 40 percent of --"
2019.18-587,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3626.04,3631.52,"Fifty -- 50,000 people, right? That's the number that availed themselves of that policy?"
2019.18-587,2,63183,michael_j_mongan,,3631.52,3634.88,"That's right, because it was short-lived."
2019.18-587,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3664.32,3672.72,"That sounds -- that percentage was 1.5 million people, very comparable to this decision."
2019.18-587,2,63183,michael_j_mongan,,3672.72,3701.52,"Yes, and at a time when the total undocumented population was much smaller than it is today. Now it -- it is critical for the executive, in an area where it has broad discretionary authority, to be able to set policies that channel the exercise of that authority, and this is a transparent framework that has the benefit of allowing for some measure of consistency and an even-handed approach in the exercise of deferred action."
2019.18-587,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3701.52,3723.84,"General, suppose that this administration had not relied on legal grounds to rescind the policy, which is very different from what they did, but let's just suppose otherwise, that they had immediately and only relied on policy considerations. Are you saying even then it would -- the -- the rescission would be reviewable? And why would that be?"
2019.18-587,2,63183,michael_j_mongan,,3723.84,3729.24,"So, if it were a pure policy rationale, it would fall outside of Chaney."
2019.18-587,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3744.2,3747.2,"Why would it fall outside of Chaney, do you think?"
2019.18-587,2,63183,michael_j_mongan,,3747.2,3752.24,I think that Chaney was very specific about the type of agency action that it addressed.
2019.18-587,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3775.6,3787.72,"Well, when you say ""particular actors,"" did it not apply to anybody who was facing execution using -- using -- by -- by lethal injection?"
2019.18-587,2,63183,michael_j_mongan,,3787.72,3805.84,"Well, as General Francisco has noted, there were broad policy considerations underlying the decision, but, as it was described by the Court, it was a decision not to enforce with respect to particular prison administrators and drug companies. And I think a -- a different point here is that --"
2019.18-587,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3805.84,3812.04,"Well, hasn't that been FDA policy for all of the years since Chaney?"
2019.18-587,2,63183,michael_j_mongan,,3812.04,3813.44,"Sure, Your Honor, but that's a --"
2019.18-587,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3813.44,3814.96,"Well, that's a big class of people."
2019.18-587,2,63183,michael_j_mongan,,3814.96,3828.56,"But that's a flat determination not to enforce, as opposed to a policy guiding future decisions about whether to grant deferred action, which itself is not a flat or final non-enforcement decision."
2019.18-587,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3839.96,3856.0,"Well, what is it exactly? I mean, look, I -- I -- I've always thought, well, it means the individualized kind of decision, but, quite rightly, the -- the solicitor general reads me the language, which is programmatic."
2019.18-587,2,63183,michael_j_mongan,,3899.0,3902.04,"Well, I think we can look to the language of the Chaney decision."
2019.18-587,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3914.6,3926.16,Imagine an SEC rule or imagine an HHS rule and what it says is we are not going to take action to give a certain category of people their benefits.
2019.18-587,2,63183,michael_j_mongan,,3929.84,3930.08,Well --
2019.18-587,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3930.08,3933.2,So -- so -- so we're struggling still.
2019.18-587,2,63183,michael_j_mongan,,3933.2,3933.44,Yes.
2019.18-587,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3933.44,3935.84,And I'm saying honestly I am struggling to get the right rule.
2019.18-587,2,63183,michael_j_mongan,,3935.84,3947.76,"I -- I understand and there may be ambiguities at the margins here, but I do want to focus it on this case because, here, Acting Secretary Duke identified one ground for terminating this policy."
2019.18-587,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3963.8,3970.68,"So you're saying at the minimum, one, an action to enforce is different from an action not to enforce."
2019.18-587,2,63183,michael_j_mongan,,3988.48,3989.32,"That's right, Your Honor."
2019.18-587,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3989.32,3989.84,Anything else?
2019.18-587,2,63183,michael_j_mongan,,3989.84,3993.48,I think those are what we have focused on in this case and that --
2019.18-587,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3993.48,4000.68,"Well, counsel, I -- I'm sorry to interrupt there, but I actually had understood your answer on the second one to be different when you were posed that question by Justice Kagan."
2019.18-587,2,63183,michael_j_mongan,,4012.44,4027.2,"So, to be more precise, if we're operating in a world where we assume that Chaney applies, our point is, regardless, this is reviewable because this is within a sub-category where the agency has disclaimed any discretionary choice."
2019.18-587,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,4031.8,4055.28,"That wasn't my -- I'm sorry, that wasn't my question. So -- so if -- if -- assuming we're living in a world in which the agency had alternative grounds and one of which was policy grounds, I had thought you told Justice Kagan that this would be reviewable. And now I thought I understood you to say something slightly different to -- to -- to Justice Breyer."
2019.18-587,2,63183,michael_j_mongan,,4056.8,4059.2,"Well, let me try and -- and clarify."
2019.18-587,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,4070.64,4081.6,"Well, I think Justice Breyer -- that just takes us back to the beginning of the discussion with Justice Breyer, which is that can't be so necessarily because every prosecutorial discretion affects a lot of people."
2019.18-587,2,63183,michael_j_mongan,,4090.04,4105.56,"Well, it may be a difficult line to draw in the general case, but, in this case, with respect, it is an easy line to draw because we know that this decision was founded on a binding legal determination by the Attorney General that they could not continue this policy."
2019.18-587,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4105.56,4106.04,What if it --
2019.18-587,2,63183,michael_j_mongan,,4106.04,4106.68,And that's the --
2019.18-587,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4106.68,4131.4,"-- what if it were less, as you view, in categorical terms? What if the Attorney General said, I've looked at this, it's -- it's -- it's a close case, but, on balance, I don't think we have the authority? Or if he said, I'm pretty sure we don't have the authority, but a court might come out differently? Does your analysis change, or is it only when he says this is -- as far as I'm concerned, this is definite; it's illegal?"
2019.18-587,2,63183,michael_j_mongan,,4131.4,4151.52,"No, Your Honor, we would argue that it's a type of action that's presumptively reviewable, and if the agency decides to base a decision on some discretionary choice but with an explanation or rationale that's founded on litigation risk or legal doubt, that that would be a rationale that courts --"
2019.18-587,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4151.52,4152.24,Is it enough --
2019.18-587,2,63183,michael_j_mongan,,4152.24,4153.16,-- would be equipped to review.
2019.18-587,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4153.16,4162.8,"-- for him to say, look, I've got a decision from the Fifth Circuit that tells me this is illegal, it's been affirmed by the Supreme Court by an equally divided vote? That's enough for me to say we're not going to do it?"
2019.18-587,2,63183,michael_j_mongan,,4162.8,4165.68,"It's not enough to sustain the decision, Your Honor."
2019.18-587,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,4182.68,4201.24,"Well, even if you went through a legitimate balancing exercise, in other words, you talked about the law and what you were worried about, and then you talked about the reliance interests, and -- and then you said here's is what we're weighing and here's our judgment, do you think that that would be sufficient?"
2019.18-587,2,63183,michael_j_mongan,,4201.24,4229.96,"I think, as a general matter, an agency could base a discretionary decision on a -- a reasoned analysis like that. I suspect that if we saw that decision, we would challenge it under the particular circumstances here. But a court might agree that if there were some substantial and detailed consideration of the actual costs of this and the reasoned legal analysis, then maybe that would be, in a court's eyes, sufficient, but that's absolutely not what we have here."
2019.18-587,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4229.96,4230.4,So --
2019.18-587,2,63183,michael_j_mongan,,4230.4,4230.76,We have a --
2019.18-587,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4230.76,4250.96,"-- so if this -- if you prevail and the case goes back, is it enough to say, look, we've read the amicus briefs that Justice Breyer pointed out about the reliance interests; we've read, you know, the Fifth Circuit's opinion in -- in the Texas litigation, presumably, they would cite that as well, would that be enough?"
2019.18-587,2,63183,michael_j_mongan,,4250.96,4265.52,"I think that it would have to begin with the deficiencies that Judge Bates identified, which is that the agency has not actually identified with any particularity the legal grounds that it's concerned with."
2019.18-587,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4266.08,4266.44,"Well, it's not --"
2019.18-587,2,63183,michael_j_mongan,,4266.44,4266.92,-- the DAPA case.
2019.18-587,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4266.92,4272.96,"Yeah, I mean, what -- do you need more than that? You've got a court of appeals decision affirmed by an equally divided Supreme Court."
2019.18-587,2,63183,michael_j_mongan,,4277.56,4281.48,"Your Honor, no, and I think Judge Bates is exactly right on this."
2019.18-587,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,4304.52,4312.88,"Well, what would an adequate explanation look like? I mean, what do you think they would have to do to be in the clear on this?"
2019.18-587,2,63183,michael_j_mongan,,4312.88,4336.48,"Well, I think that they would at least have to identify the particular grounds that they're relying on to facilitate further judicial review of their underlying legal conclusion and explain why they believe it applies to the DACA policy when they pointed to a case about a different policy, and then have some serious, and more serious than what we see in the Nielsen memo, accounting of the very substantial --"
2019.18-587,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,4336.48,4340.04,"But suppose they say, yeah, we'll do that, we'll do that."
2019.18-587,2,63183,michael_j_mongan,,4401.88,4408.72,"I think that there is a very substantial meaning to a remand in this case, Your Honor."
2019.18-587,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,4433.08,4433.28,But it --
2019.18-587,2,63183,michael_j_mongan,,4433.28,4433.76,-- said --
2019.18-587,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,4433.76,4460.56,"-- it was remanded by Judge Bates or -- or given time, and Secretary Nielsen did what you just said and said, even if DACA was legal, you heard Mr. Francisco on that, I would exercise my discretion to rescind, and then explained her consideration of the reliance interests. So why is -- there's already been, in effect, a remand."
2019.18-587,2,63183,michael_j_mongan,,4460.56,4465.4,"There -- there is a boilerplate assertion in that memo of independence, I will grant you that."
2019.18-587,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,4467.08,4468.68,"Well, can I just stop you on boilerplate?"
2019.18-587,2,63183,michael_j_mongan,,4468.68,4468.8,Yeah.
2019.18-587,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,4468.8,4470.6,"I mean, this is a serious decision."
2019.18-587,2,63183,michael_j_mongan,,4491.76,4513.32,"Yes, and I think it's important to look to the penultimate paragraph in that memorandum, where she conducts her collective weighing and she considers those policy rationales along with the legal rationales and say that, together, they outweigh the purported costs of terminating DACA. I also think it's critical to understand the context of this in that --"
2019.18-587,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,4513.32,4521.8,"So your point, just so I understand, I think this is your point, is that the legal considerations, while she said that, end up being intertwined in the subsequent paragraphs with the policy considerations?"
2019.18-587,2,63183,michael_j_mongan,,4521.8,4523.12,That -- that's absolutely right.
2019.18-587,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,4572.76,4578.72,"In that penultimate paragraph, what is the shortfall in the discussion of reliance interests, in your view?"
2019.18-587,2,63183,michael_j_mongan,,4578.72,4583.64,"Well, I'm not sure that there are -- there is much of a discussion."
2019.18-587,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,4606.68,4609.32,"Well, she does say that in a sentence."
2019.18-587,2,63183,michael_j_mongan,,4615.88,4619.24,I think the great value of a remand is that --
2019.18-587,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4619.24,4622.04,Please.
2019.18-587,2,63183,michael_j_mongan,,4622.04,4628.88,"-- to date, they have not made a decision that actually takes ownership of a discretionary choice to end this policy."
2019.18-587,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4639.28,4643.48,"Thank you, counsel. Five minutes, Mr. -- oh, I'm sorry, General Francisco."
2019.18-587,3,37093,noel_j_francisco,,4643.48,4650.28,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. I think I want to focus on three basic points."
2019.18-587,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,4738.6,4739.92,But we don't know from --
2019.18-587,3,37093,noel_j_francisco,,4739.92,4741.36,-- I don't understand --
2019.18-587,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,4741.36,4756.84,"-- from all of that, we don't know how she would respond if there were a clear recognition that there was nothing illegal about DACA. Her whole memo is infected by the idea that this is, one, illegal."
2019.18-587,3,37093,noel_j_francisco,,4787.28,4792.24,"Respectfully, Your Honor, I very much disagree."
2019.18-587,3,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,4848.56,4863.76,"But even what you just read, General, in that key paragraph where the Secretary weighs the -- the -- the -- the reliance interests against the reasons in her memo, everything's wrapped up."
2019.18-587,3,37093,noel_j_francisco,,4873.68,4875.08,I -- I simply disagree with that.
2019.18-587,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,4888.36,4889.72,Look at the independent grounds.
2019.18-587,3,37093,noel_j_francisco,,4924.6,4926.08,"With respect, may I finish? May I finish?"
2019.18-587,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4926.08,4926.32,Yes.
2019.18-587,3,37093,noel_j_francisco,,4926.32,4929.12,I'm going to try to squeeze in two points in a single sentence.
2019.18-587,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,4929.12,4930.48,That's all right. Good luck.
2019.18-587,3,37093,noel_j_francisco,,4931.52,4976.4,"The first -- the -- the first point is that I very much disagree. All of those articulate the basic same policy rationale that this is a law enforcement agency. They are against general policies that actively facilitate violations of the law. And the last point I will make is, while we don't think you need to address the legality question if you agree with us on any of our other arguments, if you disagree with us on any of our other arguments, you absolutely must address the ultimate legality question because we simply cannot be forced to maintain a policy that this Court concludes that is illegal. So, if you decide to get there, then we do think that DACA is illegal and was justifiably -- was justifiably rescinded on that basis as well. Thank you, Your Honor."
2019.18-587,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4976.4,4977.36,"Thank you, counsel."
