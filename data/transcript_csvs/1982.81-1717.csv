1982.81-1717,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,7.07,We will hear arguments next in American Bank and Trust Company against Dallas County.
1982.81-1717,0,36692,marvin_s_sloman,,73.046,76.548,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1982.81-1717,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,646.001,648.203,What about gift taxes?
1982.81-1717,0,36692,marvin_s_sloman,,648.203,650.738,"Gift taxes are not mentioned, Your Honor."
1982.81-1717,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,650.738,652.524,"Well, what happens then?"
1982.81-1717,0,36692,marvin_s_sloman,,660.278,665.182,Certainly in the view of the Solicitor General that's so.
1982.81-1717,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,727.405,727.855,Very well.
1982.81-1717,1,21899,ernest_j_brown,,737.594,740.444,Mr. Chief Justice and it it please the Court:
1982.81-1717,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,985.102,990.239,"Mr. Brown, let me interrupt you right there, because that Idaho example raised a question in my mind."
1982.81-1717,1,21899,ernest_j_brown,,1006.867,1009.985,The dividends distributed by the corporation--
1982.81-1717,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1009.985,1010.885,"To the shareholders, yes."
1982.81-1717,1,21899,ernest_j_brown,,1010.885,1011.735,"--No, Justice Stevens."
1982.81-1717,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1011.735,1018.841,"Why wouldn't that be indirectly a tax on income, just as the tax on value of the shares is a tax on the underlying Government bond?"
1982.81-1717,1,21899,ernest_j_brown,,1018.841,1021.96,"Well, it hasn't been thus far."
1982.81-1717,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1044.457,1047.092,But in this case you're arguing the corporation is not an insulator.
1982.81-1717,1,21899,ernest_j_brown,,1047.092,1051.979,"Well, no... yes, after the statute I am arguing that it's not."
1982.81-1717,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1051.979,1055.864,"That it's an insulator for income purposes, but not for asset purposes."
1982.81-1717,1,21899,ernest_j_brown,,1055.864,1062.085,"Well, I don't know that I would make that classification if it's not essential here."
1982.81-1717,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1180.329,1183.297,"Mr. Brown, let me be sure I follow you."
1982.81-1717,1,21899,ernest_j_brown,,1191.284,1192.736,"--Yes, I do, I do."
1982.81-1717,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1192.736,1195.521,And intentionally so on the part of Congress?
1982.81-1717,1,21899,ernest_j_brown,,1195.521,1197.088,"Yes, I feel that's clear."
1982.81-1717,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1362.757,1365.626,"Very well, Mr. Brown."
1982.81-1717,2,18996,carroll_r_graham,,1370.846,1373.547,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1982.81-1717,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1470.759,1475.246,You say prior to '59 the tax would unquestionably have been upheld?
1982.81-1717,2,18996,carroll_r_graham,,1475.246,1476.129,Yes.
1982.81-1717,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1476.129,1480.198,And you don't think anything changed that in '59?
1982.81-1717,2,18996,carroll_r_graham,,1480.198,1481.817,No.
1982.81-1717,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1581.745,1586.783,"You would concede, wouldn't you, you'd rather have the Government's case after '59 than before?"
1982.81-1717,2,18996,carroll_r_graham,,1586.783,1588.501,"No, sir."
1982.81-1717,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1632.28,1643.553,Do you think the '59 amendment invalidated any tax that would have been valid before?
1982.81-1717,2,18996,carroll_r_graham,,1644.422,1645.638,The gift tax--
1982.81-1717,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1645.638,1646.305,What about Idaho?
1982.81-1717,2,18996,carroll_r_graham,,1646.305,1647.874,--Idaho would have been invalid before.
1982.81-1717,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1647.874,1651.409,Why did they even... why was anybody ever worried about it?
1982.81-1717,2,18996,carroll_r_graham,,1651.409,1651.959,I don't know.
1982.81-1717,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1651.959,1653.544,"Well, Congress was."
1982.81-1717,2,18996,carroll_r_graham,,1653.544,1658.329,"But the Congressional Record said they probably wouldn't have prevailed, but they wanted to--"
1982.81-1717,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1658.329,1664.066,"So they made sure that Idaho wasn't... the tax wasn't going to pass muster, is that it?"
1982.81-1717,2,18996,carroll_r_graham,,1664.066,1668.97,--Or that that particular type of tax was not going to be tried by anyone else.
1982.81-1717,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1695.787,1709.279,"Mr. Graham, is it not true that your opponent's theory is not limited to extending the exemption on bank stock, but it covers all kinds of corporations under their reading of the '59 Act?"
1982.81-1717,2,18996,carroll_r_graham,,1719.319,1736.698,"The General Motors, the question of the General Motors stock, the applicability there is a different question, Mr. Justice, because I know of no statute which authorizes the taxation of those shares specifically."
1982.81-1717,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1736.698,1749.506,"No, but if a state sought to impose some kind of a tax on any corporate entity measured by its net worth, under the Government's view they would have to exclude from the computation that portion that represented federal obligations."
1982.81-1717,2,18996,carroll_r_graham,,1755.326,1766.55,"I do not take a position on other corporations, because I do not--"
1982.81-1717,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1766.55,1767.067,I don't know why you're afraid to.
1982.81-1717,2,18996,carroll_r_graham,,1784.095,1785.329,--Correct.
1982.81-1717,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1785.329,1786.964,--of the banking provisions?
1982.81-1717,2,18996,carroll_r_graham,,1786.964,1792.701,"Correct, sir, for a number of reasons."
1982.81-1717,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1807.96,1827.439,"I guess you would feel comfortable with the proposition that the state could tax everybody... that banks are different from other corporations, that the state could not tax anyone except banks?"
1982.81-1717,2,18996,carroll_r_graham,,1827.439,1831.993,"On this point, on the federal obligation point?"
1982.81-1717,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1834.778,1835.912,Banks are different.
1982.81-1717,2,18996,carroll_r_graham,,1835.912,1838.063,"That may well be true, yes, sir."
1982.81-1717,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1860.429,1865.797,So a state could tax banks but couldn't tax anything else?
1982.81-1717,2,18996,carroll_r_graham,,1865.797,1872.737,"Oh, taxation... if we're staying on the proposition of federal obligation, yes, sir."
1982.81-1717,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1872.737,1882.358,"You'd think it would almost run the other way, wouldn't you?"
1982.81-1717,2,18996,carroll_r_graham,,1893.333,1908.426,"That's right, because the Congress has provided that, and for a long time set out the precise methods by which those taxes, the tax methods that had to be followed."
1982.81-1717,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2034.759,2036.976,Very well.
1982.81-1717,3,22662,earl_luna,,2040.246,2042.246,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1982.81-1717,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2632.559,2642.665,"Well, would you be making the same argument if Section 5719 had never been on the books?"
1982.81-1717,3,22662,earl_luna,,2642.665,2669.232,"If Section 5719 would have never been on the books, I would be making the same argument, because we believe Van Allen stands for two propositions which permit bank stock to be taxable: One, because of the separate ownership of the stock and the corporation; and then number two, the consent statute, 5219 itself, either one of which--"
1982.81-1717,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2669.232,2674.72,You don't think the '59 amendment had any impact on that Van Allen line of cases at all?
1982.81-1717,3,22662,earl_luna,,2674.72,2691.08,"--I don't believe it had one iota on Van Allen, because I cannot believe that in all of the hearings of Congress they would have overruled almost 100 years of cases of this Court and never told anybody that's what they were doing."
1982.81-1717,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2848.967,2853.002,"Do you have anything further, Mr. Sloman?"
1982.81-1717,4,36692,marvin_s_sloman,,2853.002,2855.787,"If I may briefly, Mr. Chief Justice."
1982.81-1717,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2892.996,2896.031,Do you think this tax would have been permissible before '59?
1982.81-1717,4,36692,marvin_s_sloman,,2896.031,2900.333,"The tax in the case at bar, Your Honor?"
1982.81-1717,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2901.935,2911.207,"So the '59 amendments you think did have the affect of overturning that line of cases, Van Allen and the whole crowd?"
1982.81-1717,4,36692,marvin_s_sloman,,2911.207,2916.611,It had the effect of overturning the results of those cases.
1982.81-1717,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2916.611,2918.277,"Yes, yes."
1982.81-1717,4,36692,marvin_s_sloman,,2918.277,2938.624,"Those cases stood, beginning with the Van Allen case in 1866 and ending with the Bowers case in 1955, those cases rested not on an interpretation of Section 5219, but on the shareholder-corporation distinction."
1982.81-1717,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2938.624,2939.34,"Yes, yes."
1982.81-1717,4,36692,marvin_s_sloman,,2939.34,2942.476,"Now, under that distinction--"
1982.81-1717,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2942.476,2943.559,But isn't it true that--
1982.81-1717,4,36692,marvin_s_sloman,,2943.559,2944.059,"--Excuse me, Justice."
1982.81-1717,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2944.059,2947.594,--Isn't it true that your view of '59 is it really destroys that distinction?
1982.81-1717,4,36692,marvin_s_sloman,,2947.594,2951.498,"Well, I think that it goes--"
1982.81-1717,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2951.498,2955.386,At least for this kind of tax?
1982.81-1717,4,36692,marvin_s_sloman,,2958.556,2962.164,--It overturns the result of the cases by--
1982.81-1717,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2962.164,2963.322,"Well, as well as that theory--"
1982.81-1717,4,36692,marvin_s_sloman,,2963.322,2964.102,--providing a different test.
1982.81-1717,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2964.102,2965.022,--As well as that theory.
1982.81-1717,4,36692,marvin_s_sloman,,2972.578,2985.653,"That theory was germane only, Justice White, to a prohibition against a tax upon United States obligations."
1982.81-1717,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2991.457,2999.913,So that that distinction was... it isn't germane any more because of the '59 amendments?
1982.81-1717,4,36692,marvin_s_sloman,,2999.913,3000.463,Exactly.
1982.81-1717,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3000.463,3013.655,"What do you say to the argument he makes that making that significant a change in the law, where you had 90-some years of settled rule, would have invoked some comment in the legislative deliberations?"
1982.81-1717,4,36692,marvin_s_sloman,,3013.655,3019.04,"Well, it did evoke some comment, Justice Stevens."
1982.81-1717,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3025.38,3029.082,"Well, that really says nothing about the differences between a corporation--"
1982.81-1717,4,36692,marvin_s_sloman,,3029.082,3029.415,--Exactly.
1982.81-1717,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3030.315,3039.354,--There really is nothing in the legislative history that would tell the Congressmen who weren't as sophisticated in this area as lawyers who practice all the time just what was happening.
1982.81-1717,4,36692,marvin_s_sloman,,3039.354,3041.473,"--Well, the words of the statute--"
1982.81-1717,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3041.473,3047.293,"Unless they just read into the words of the statute the ""indirectly"" language and the computation and the concern language."
1982.81-1717,4,36692,marvin_s_sloman,,3047.293,3075.313,"--And they did make that, those words, those 52 words of the statute, not four words to deal with an Idaho problem... they put the 52 words of the statute into the Act in furtherance of a stated purpose, which was stated by the Congress and the Congressional Committee, to make United States obligations more attractive as investments, and indeed to encourage banks to hold them."
1982.81-1717,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3075.313,3076.746,Was this statute debated on the floor?
1982.81-1717,4,36692,marvin_s_sloman,,3079.515,3082.3,"I can't answer the question, Your Honor."
1982.81-1717,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3088.62,3096.826,Didn't the Secretary of the Treasury indicate that the purpose of the amendment was to make federal... U.S. Government bonds more attractive to investors?
1982.81-1717,4,36692,marvin_s_sloman,,3096.826,3098.509,"Yes, indeed, Your Honor."
1982.81-1717,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3098.509,3100.178,That's certainly part of the legislative history.
1982.81-1717,4,36692,marvin_s_sloman,,3100.178,3101.344,"Mr. Chief Justice, and to the banks."
