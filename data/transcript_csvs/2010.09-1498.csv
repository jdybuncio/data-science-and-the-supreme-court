2010.09-1498,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,5.202,"We'll hear argument next in Case 09-1498, United States v. Tinklenberg."
2010.09-1498,0,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,5.987,7.087,Thank you.
2010.09-1498,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,75.298,77.833,"Well, all that might be true."
2010.09-1498,0,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,86.939,88.289,"No, Your Honor."
2010.09-1498,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,123.395,130.301,But the Chief Justice says only if it -- it's really a circular argument -- only if it results in a delay.
2010.09-1498,0,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,133.503,141.074,"--That's assuming that delay is referring to delay of the trial, to a postponement in the trial."
2010.09-1498,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,179.416,190.506,"But that doesn't -- that prove the point that I think is the concern of the Chief Justice's question, that in some cases the delay -- there's a delay that results and in other cases there isn't."
2010.09-1498,0,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,190.506,201.897,"--But, Your Honor, the statute excludes the period of delay, and then it says the period of delay is the time from the filing through the disposition."
2010.09-1498,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,295.859,319.058,"Mr. Roberts, is there -- is there any, anything to indicate that what Congress might have had in mind is that in criminal cases inevitably there are going to be motions, and so the trial judge is likely to set the trial date for after that period runs?"
2010.09-1498,0,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,319.058,320.524,"Yes, Your Honor."
2010.09-1498,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,473.558,476.343,You said at the outset that things have been working fine.
2010.09-1498,0,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,499.292,517.753,"Well, I -- I can't point to anything particular, but there's been no outcry that -- that there's been a problem from pretrial motions being filed as a -- as an attempt to extend the Speedy Trial Act deadline."
2010.09-1498,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,540.536,558.997,"Counsel, on that issue, do you accept the First Circuit's rule in U.S. v. Hood that if the government is found to be attempting to frustrate the operation of the Speedy Trial Act, that those motions and their delays won't be counted?"
2010.09-1498,0,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,558.997,565.651,"Well, first, Your Honor, I don't think that -- that Hood adopted any such rule."
2010.09-1498,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,566.936,568.736,It suggests that qualification?
2010.09-1498,0,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,568.736,571.638,--It suggests that there might be that qualification.
2010.09-1498,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,598.872,599.824,"Sanctionable against the government, or--"
2010.09-1498,0,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,599.824,602.443,The attorney could be sanctioned for that.
2010.09-1498,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,602.443,607.061,--How does that help a defendant whose speedy trial rights have been violated?
2010.09-1498,0,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,607.061,615.501,"Well, the -- the court doesn't need to put off trial just because time is excluded, Your Honor, and the court has other mechanisms that it can use--"
2010.09-1498,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,615.501,616.953,You haven't answered my question.
2010.09-1498,0,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,641.818,653.792,"--Well, the statute provides the circumstances in which time is excludable and in which time is not, and it doesn't create an exception for certain kinds of motions."
2010.09-1498,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,684.411,706.344,"Counsel, I hope you won't sit down without addressing the (h)(1)(F) issue and explain why we shouldn't reach it, because the issue is, as I see it, one of law, not like Nobles, one of discretion."
2010.09-1498,0,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,725.472,739.732,"Well, the Court -- the Court does decline to address questions if it doesn't consider them of sufficient importance to -- general importance to warrant a review."
2010.09-1498,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,781.892,782.625,Two?
2010.09-1498,0,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,784.594,789.146,"--Two other circuits, but there aren't any that have -- that have held to the contrary."
2010.09-1498,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,789.146,805.423,"If we were to decide this based on subsection (F) involving the counting of 10 days, wouldn't that render our decision on anything that we had to say about subsection (D) dictum?"
2010.09-1498,0,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,805.423,808.023,"I don't think it would render it dictum, Your Honor."
2010.09-1498,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,828.137,828.873,It's not part of the rationale.
2010.09-1498,0,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,852.904,862.677,"--Well, Your Honor, the Respondent offered this argument as a ground not to grant certiorari in its -- in his brief in opposition."
2010.09-1498,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,867.112,869.214,I'm not disagreeing with you.
2010.09-1498,0,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,870.533,884.09,"--Well, I think you could -- I'm not sure that I think that it would be impermissible for -- for the Court to decide the issues in that order, but if you think so and you think that that's a reason--"
2010.09-1498,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,884.09,894.731,"I'm sure it's not impermissible, but I'm also sure that if we do it, what we say about the ground for which we took the case would be -- would be the purest dictum."
2010.09-1498,0,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,894.731,897.6,--I can see how you might think so.
2010.09-1498,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,897.6,898.917,Courts of appeal--
2010.09-1498,0,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,898.917,899.885,I think the courts of appeals would follow it.
2010.09-1498,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,903.254,904.554,"It's their fault; they shouldn't follow dictum, you know?"
2010.09-1498,0,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,904.554,906.706,--I'm not trying to argue you should decide the issue.
2010.09-1498,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,908.206,929.488,"Is it because, Mr. Roberts, as you pointed out, it's not a continuing problem since the amendment to Rule 45, it's calendar days, and so there's no problem, and so what you're suggesting is we would not have granted cert on that question?"
2010.09-1498,0,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,929.488,930.171,Exactly.
2010.09-1498,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,965.661,977.302,--It -- it may be pertinent on this question: Mr. Tinklenberg was designated for transfer to MCC in Chicago on November 10th.
2010.09-1498,0,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,982.087,990.443,I believe what happened is the court ordered -- the court ordered on the 2nd that there should be a competency examination.
2010.09-1498,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,998.549,999.665,"--So the BOP did it, not a court?"
2010.09-1498,0,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,999.665,1000.5,--would take place.
2010.09-1498,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1034.972,1036.508,"Well, I don't know--"
2010.09-1498,0,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1036.508,1037.508,They make three stops.
2010.09-1498,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1037.508,1038.792,--You seem to be getting into this.
2010.09-1498,0,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1045.029,1047.815,Yes.
2010.09-1498,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1047.815,1059.123,"Is -- is it right that the Rules Committee then changed it, and it basically said the way the defendant here thinks it should be is that's what it should be?"
2010.09-1498,0,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1061.206,1061.773,Yes.
2010.09-1498,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1061.773,1062.325,Okay -- now--
2010.09-1498,0,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1062.325,1063.608,The Rules--
2010.09-1498,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1063.608,1066.277,--The Rules Committee said count calendar days.
2010.09-1498,0,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1066.277,1067.36,--Changed the rule--
2010.09-1498,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1067.36,1068.145,They changed the rule.
2010.09-1498,0,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1068.145,1070.312,"--for -- for Rule 45, yes."
2010.09-1498,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1070.312,1078.918,"And now you think that the Federal courts are right in saying, judge, when you have a Speedy Trial Act case, look to Rule 45; you think that's right to do?"
2010.09-1498,0,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1078.918,1079.501,"Yes, we do."
2010.09-1498,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1079.918,1080.401,Okay.
2010.09-1498,0,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1083.37,1089.524,"--Because at the time, that wasn't -- at the time that -- that the transportation was done then--"
2010.09-1498,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1089.524,1090.726,I know it was under a different rule.
2010.09-1498,0,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1114.924,1121.745,"--I think -- I think that -- that at the time that was the method that -- that dictated the transportation for him, and--"
2010.09-1498,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1121.745,1122.261,I understand.
2010.09-1498,0,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1124.78,1125.43,--retroactively--
2010.09-1498,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1125.43,1126.649,They've changed the rule.
2010.09-1498,0,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1132.053,1135.088,--Because it's not -- it's not a -- a rule of law that we're talking about.
2010.09-1498,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1139.373,1140.457,No.
2010.09-1498,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1140.908,1141.874,It wasn't anybody's fault.
2010.09-1498,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1158.62,1178.248,"--May I suggest that perhaps the reason not to do it is, assuming this person was treated entirely fairly on the basis of the law that existed at the time, the consequence of what Justice Breyer proposes is to set free someone who has been duly convicted of a crime."
2010.09-1498,0,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1178.248,1179.015,--That's right.
2010.09-1498,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1179.015,1192.257,"And to do that simply because, although the -- the process was perfectly fair when it was applied, there's been a change in the rule and therefore we don't redo it, but we let this person go; right?"
2010.09-1498,0,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1192.257,1193.441,I agree.
2010.09-1498,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1193.441,1194.543,And can't be tried again.
2010.09-1498,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1194.543,1194.859,Any other reason?
2010.09-1498,0,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1194.859,1195.993,"I agree completely, Your Honor."
2010.09-1498,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1196.493,1208.969,"I mean, I'm thinking that we normally -- although all this is quite true, what Justice Scalia says, normally we do apply new rules to those who are on appeal at the time."
2010.09-1498,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1208.969,1210.136,I don't -- I don't agree with that.
2010.09-1498,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1210.803,1211.319,"Well, maybe--"
2010.09-1498,0,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1211.319,1212.171,--I--
2010.09-1498,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1212.171,1212.905,--Do you agree with that?
2010.09-1498,0,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1212.905,1218.492,--I don't think that you -- I don't think that this is a new rule of law that you're talking about.
2010.09-1498,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1223.277,1223.728,Who wants the benefit of this new rule?
2010.09-1498,0,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1229.966,1234.918,We -- we don't want the -- we don't want the new rule.
2010.09-1498,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1236.036,1236.503,Counsel--
2010.09-1498,0,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1236.503,1237.67,"--what we think the rule, what the rule means."
2010.09-1498,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1237.67,1238.186,--there's a lot--
2010.09-1498,0,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1238.186,1239.038,I don't -- I don't understand--
2010.09-1498,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1239.038,1244.892,"--Counsel, there's a lot of discussion about the applicability or nonapplicability of this rule to this case."
2010.09-1498,0,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1260.236,1261.369,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2010.09-1498,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1265.305,1269.091,So this whole debate about whether the rule applies or not is irrelevant.
2010.09-1498,0,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1272.626,1273.493,Yes.
2010.09-1498,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1273.493,1274.078,All right.
2010.09-1498,0,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1279.213,1279.815,I agree with that.
2010.09-1498,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1279.815,1283.684,"--between the old rule or the revised rule, correct?"
2010.09-1498,0,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1284.567,1285.084,"Yes, I like that."
2010.09-1498,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1285.084,1286.219,--made an amendment; correct?
2010.09-1498,0,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1286.219,1287.436,I like the way we're going.
2010.09-1498,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1288.505,1290.021,But I think you don't.
2010.09-1498,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1290.021,1299.294,"Will you like the way we're going if I accept your proposition that when Congress uses 10 days, it really means 10 business days?"
2010.09-1498,0,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1307.682,1311.251,"Well, Your Honor, I think that there's no plain meaning."
2010.09-1498,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1319.94,1325.944,"--But Congress has used 10 -- has used business days in other provisions, hasn't it?"
2010.09-1498,0,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1325.944,1329.046,--I -- I don't know whether it's used business days or not.
2010.09-1498,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1338.854,1346.007,Let's go back to -- I don't think you should have been so happy with the way the argument was going--
2010.09-1498,0,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1391.636,1394.588,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2010.09-1498,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1423.675,1426.96,So Congress changed its mind between the two rules?
2010.09-1498,0,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1426.96,1428.845,"--No, I don't think Congress changed its mind."
2010.09-1498,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1433.315,1434.182,How do I know that?
2010.09-1498,0,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1437.934,1438.467,--Well--
2010.09-1498,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1438.467,1442.171,"Where in the statute does it -- say, apply the criminal rules?"
2010.09-1498,0,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1442.171,1464.169,"--Well, I think that -- that my point is that when it doesn't specify whether it's business or calendar days, that Congress anticipated the courts would say, okay, let's look to the background rule; and the place, the sensible place to look to the background rule is the rule -- is a rule of criminal procedure in analogous contexts."
2010.09-1498,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1479.178,1497.723,"When you're trying -- when you're trying to figure out -- when you're dealing with procedural rules that involve filing things in court, it was once thought to make sense to exclude weekends because things couldn't be filed on the weekends, but when you're talking about transporting a prisoner."
2010.09-1498,0,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1501.044,1501.61,Well--
2010.09-1498,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1501.61,1511.399,"--Do these flights of prisoners from one facility to another come to a stop when -- you know, when the whistle blows on Saturday -- on Friday afternoon?"
2010.09-1498,0,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1511.399,1515.886,"--Yes, Your Honor, generally the flights don't occur on the weekends or holidays."
2010.09-1498,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1599.29,1600.023,"Thank you, counsel."
2010.09-1498,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1607.194,1610.027,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2010.09-1498,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1660.293,1680.123,"Suppose the petition here had simply raised one question, and that is the question of how you count time under -- under a version of Rule 45 of the Federal Rules Of Criminal Procedure that is not -- no longer in effect and as to which there is no conflict in the circuits."
2010.09-1498,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1685.194,1691.431,"Well, I'll take your hypothetical, Justice Alito, but I do want to be able to correct the notion that it's of no longer continuing importance."
2010.09-1498,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1838.123,1841.908,If I could just come back to where you started before you go on to these additional points.
2010.09-1498,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1865.726,1868.093,"You're not duty-bound to decide it, Justice Alito."
2010.09-1498,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1975.78,1993.076,"Why wouldn't Congress think, we have a bunch of statutes that have times and we have a bunch that don't and the ones that don't, they should be interpreted into the Federal rule, that Rule 45?"
2010.09-1498,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1993.076,1999.312,"I think the much more natural reading, Justice Ginsburg, in light of the traditional rule, which is not just cited in Am."
2010.09-1498,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2067.724,2078.681,"Under the 2009 amendment, Rule 45 includes statutes it didn't before and now it does?"
2010.09-1498,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2078.681,2082.216,"It does now, but two things are telling about the 2009 amendments."
2010.09-1498,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2089.87,2092.536,You're not relying on the 2009--
2010.09-1498,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2092.536,2092.988,No.
2010.09-1498,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2092.988,2096.774,--You don't say -- you say this was wrong when it was decided?
2010.09-1498,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2096.774,2097.24,Yes.
2010.09-1498,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2097.24,2099.476,Regardless of the 2009?
2010.09-1498,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2099.476,2100.392,"That's right, that's right."
2010.09-1498,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2139.081,2149.639,"Congress thought about the Speedy Trial Act when it made those technical amendments, isn't it likely to have thought the courts had interpreted it as excluding the weekends up to that point?"
2010.09-1498,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2149.639,2153.591,"--No, my point, Justice Alito, is Congress didn't think of the Speedy Trial Act, it didn't do anything with the Speedy Trial Act."
2010.09-1498,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2153.591,2154.591,Didn't think about -- okay.
2010.09-1498,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2154.591,2161.696,"Well, maybe we leave that where it was, but let me make one final point that I think is the clincher here."
2010.09-1498,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2209.76,2218.033,"And if we don't agree with you on your Rule 45 argument, you say we would have to reach this third argument, right?"
2010.09-1498,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2218.033,2218.566,Yes.
2010.09-1498,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2239.28,2248.719,"Well, why aren't they trying -- why isn't the effect of what you're doing to prompt us to dismiss this case that the petitioner has improvidently granted?"
2010.09-1498,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2267.716,2270.266,I think you would be very happy if we didn't.
2010.09-1498,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2270.266,2272.318,"I think you could do that, Justice Ginsburg."
2010.09-1498,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2289.212,2299.234,"But then you would have to -- we would have to wait for another case to decide this issue, one which is a split, that is, the delay resulting from."
2010.09-1498,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2299.851,2301.853,And I can't stand the suspense.
2010.09-1498,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2306.055,2306.574,Right.
2010.09-1498,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2335.191,2352.453,"I'm sorry to interrupt you so early, but what about Justice Ginsburg's point, which I understood to be there's always delay resulting from these pretrial motions; it's just that the district judge takes that into account, says, well, I'm going to have a lot of the usual pretrial motions, so I'm going to set the trial date at this point."
2010.09-1498,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2363.559,2366.51,"--That's exactly our argument, Mr. Chief Justice."
2010.09-1498,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2397.482,2399.448,How would you ever know that?
2010.09-1498,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2423.013,2427.834,"--Well, ordinarily, Justice Ginsburg -- remember, this is only a small subset of cases."
2010.09-1498,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2451.566,2452.532,Why -- why would the defendant stipulate?
2010.09-1498,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2452.532,2453.151,Pardon me?
2010.09-1498,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2453.151,2457.87,Why would -- why would a defendant who would benefit from the clock running stipulate?
2010.09-1498,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2457.87,2461.305,"Defendants don't always benefit from the clock running, Justice Ginsburg."
2010.09-1498,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2485.469,2510.802,"How do you reconcile your argument with the situation in which the motion is pending for 30 days, so that's the period from the filing until the prompt disposition, and as a result of that motion, the trial judge says this has caused -- this is going to force me, this is going to result in 10 days' delay in the date on which the case can begin, so the trial date is pushed back 10 days?"
2010.09-1498,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2514.988,2519.808,I think the -- the text of the statute allows you to say either 30 or 10.
2010.09-1498,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2595.023,2597.725,"Excuse me, but isn't that what the statute says?"
2010.09-1498,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2648.658,2653.626,"I think for two reasons, I would disagree, respectfully, Justice Sotomayor."
2010.09-1498,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2667.752,2668.285,That's the--
2010.09-1498,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2668.285,2671.254,--Solicitor General's argument is that you start from the premise.
2010.09-1498,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2676.225,2684.431,"--Well, but that's what (h) says; (h) says you compute the start date of the trial, when it must start, by excluding all of these periods of delay."
2010.09-1498,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2686.366,2688.666,"Well, if -- if there was delay."
2010.09-1498,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2761.331,2775.923,"So it doesn't matter how substantial and important a motion is, whether it was your motion to dismiss for Speedy Trial Act reasons or the administrative motions here that you say really didn't require time?"
2010.09-1498,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2791.35,2800.956,"The distinction between administrative and nonadministrative motions, I think, doesn't matter in this case because trial wasn't--"
2010.09-1498,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2800.956,2801.658,Why wouldn't it matter?
2010.09-1498,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2801.658,2813.097,"--Well, it would matter, I think, Justice Sotomayor, in a circumstance where the trial date hadn't been set yet and then was set, and an argument might arise -- well, I think we've had this dialogue already to some degree."
2010.09-1498,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2834.943,2837.145,"Well, actually it happens all the time."
2010.09-1498,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2855.09,2862.077,"That may well be correct, but I don't know why it would matter, because it doesn't matter until you get outside of the 70 days to begin with."
2010.09-1498,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2863.695,2871.533,"It matters because the trial judges have to know what to do, and while your reading might fit the language in ordinary English better, I think it does."
2010.09-1498,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2904.856,2907.641,"--Let me say a couple things, Justice Breyer."
2010.09-1498,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3037.823,3038.623,Why do you think that--
2010.09-1498,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,3038.623,3039.24,And you walk in--
2010.09-1498,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3039.24,3048.762,"--your motion -- I mean, the government had administrative motions, but you had a Speedy Trial Act motion; and you say that doesn't count, either?"
2010.09-1498,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,3048.762,3051.612,"--I -- well, two things, Justice Ginsburg."
2010.09-1498,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3078.697,3094.957,"Counsel, I don't believe I had a trial in my district court days where between the time I had the pretrial conference and the time trial started, there wasn't a slew of motions, because that's about the time counsel tends to wake up."
2010.09-1498,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,3094.957,3095.324,--Yes.
2010.09-1498,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3095.993,3096.626,Okay?
2010.09-1498,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,3099.945,3100.278,Yes.
2010.09-1498,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3100.278,3109.217,Why should we care whether it's an administrative motion or simply to clarify the functioning of the trial?
2010.09-1498,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,3125.31,3148.426,"I think that might be an argument for writing the Speedy Trial Act a different way, Justice Sotomayor; but if the question is whether the motion delayed trial -- and that's the question that the Speedy Trial Act requires the judge to ask and answer -- then the administrative piece of paper going across the judge's desk when the judge knows ahead of time it isn't going to cause any difficult, simply doesn't delay trial."
2010.09-1498,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3171.391,3176.028,"Mr. Fisher -- delay, you make an argument about the meaning of delay."
2010.09-1498,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,3197.775,3199.225,"--I think that's right, and I think that's--"
2010.09-1498,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3199.225,3201.391,"Well, where do you -- where to you get that ""not to exceed""?"
2010.09-1498,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,3207.128,3211.198,"--I think the difficulty is with the word ""from"", Justice Scalia."
2010.09-1498,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3241.052,3242.568,It's a funny way to say it.
2010.09-1498,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,3242.568,3244.17,"I don't think it's a perfect way to say it, either, Justice Scalia."
2010.09-1498,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3309.612,3311.481,"Thank you, counsel."
2010.09-1498,2,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,3313.714,3315.933,"Thank you, Your Honor."
2010.09-1498,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3501.821,3511.843,"So given the choice between a dismissal and an affirmance with good dictum about subsection (d), you would prefer the latter?"
2010.09-1498,2,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,3511.843,3516.931,"--Yes, I think that we would like the Court to address the issue on which cert was granted."
2010.09-1498,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3529.472,3530.923,"Thank you, Counsel."
