1962.69,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,28.42,"Number 69, United States, Appellant, versus Ralph L. Sampson, et al."
1962.69,0,28314,howard_p_willens,,34.871,37.654,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1962.69,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,44.764,46.556,Very well.
1962.69,0,28314,howard_p_willens,,46.556,60.313,This case comes before the Court on direct appeal from the District Court for the Northern District of Georgia under the provisions of the Criminal Appeal Acts and involves the construction of the federal mail fraud statute.
1962.69,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,350.766,365.009,"Mr. Willens, was that -- were those checks in final -- suppose to be in the final payment of everything that they owed to these people or was there -- was there more to come when the transaction was completed?"
1962.69,0,28314,howard_p_willens,,365.009,370.381,"Mr. Chief Justice, the contracts varied in that respect and I’ll be addressing myself to that point in a minute."
1962.69,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,370.381,372.62,It’s alright.
1962.69,0,28314,howard_p_willens,,372.62,385.771,"According to the indictment after the mailing of this accepted contract and form letter, the scheme entailed a continued relationship between the defendants on the one hand and their victims on the other."
1962.69,1,40596,randolph_w_thrower,,2585.301,2587.564,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1962.69,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2587.564,2589.487,Is it Thrower or Thrawer?
1962.69,1,40596,randolph_w_thrower,,2589.487,2589.968,Thrower.
1962.69,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2589.968,2590.534,Thrower?
1962.69,1,40596,randolph_w_thrower,,2590.534,2592.761,Yes.
1962.69,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2790.543,2794.429,Did that end the transaction?
1962.69,1,40596,randolph_w_thrower,,2794.429,2816.622,That Your Honor executed the offensive fraud and as this Court stated within it’s holding within the very holding in Kann -- in the Kann case that executed the scheme or artifice to obtain money by false pretenses.
1962.69,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2816.622,2841.047,"But I -- I notice here on this exhibit that’s on page 51 of the transcript, the agreement that the victim -- so-called victim signed and which the defendant promised to sign if it was agreeable to him said this."
1962.69,1,40596,randolph_w_thrower,,2875.944,2876.62,Your Honor --
1962.69,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2876.62,2886.393,"Now, isn’t that a -- isn’t that vital part of the transaction and isn’t it just the other side of the coin so far as these parties are concerned?"
1962.69,1,40596,randolph_w_thrower,,2886.393,2888.19,"We would think not, Your Honor."
1962.69,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2888.19,2888.524,What?
1962.69,1,40596,randolph_w_thrower,,2888.524,2908.128,"I think that the -- our position would be that the underlying offense of fraud has been committed, the state offense, the crime of fraud has been committed and when the proceeds when the fruits had been received and that the fraud has been executed."
1962.69,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2908.128,2926.051,"This is on the premise of the allegation that was never contemplated by the alleged defrauders that any more money be -- would be accepted, all the rest was a facade around the central purpose of getting that money and once they got it, as far as they were concerned the fraud was --"
1962.69,1,40596,randolph_w_thrower,,2926.051,2927.75,"According to the allegations, yes."
1962.69,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2928.105,2938.563,Your position is that it makes no difference once the money is received that it was clearly contemplated that there would be further mailing.
1962.69,1,40596,randolph_w_thrower,,2938.563,2939.611,"Oh, we do not --"
1962.69,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2939.611,2940.137,But (Voice Overlap) --
1962.69,1,40596,randolph_w_thrower,,2940.137,2944.255,-- we take the issue with the fact that it was contemplated that there would be further mailing.
1962.69,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2944.255,2950.041,In connection with all of the accounts that were dismissed you concede that these mailings were within the contemplation of the scheme.
1962.69,1,40596,randolph_w_thrower,,2950.041,2951.333,"We would concede that, yes."
1962.69,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2951.976,2967.817,"Mr. Thrower, may I ask was it -- I gather some of this material, particularly that at 52 and 53, that was -- this is material mailed before the money was paid or what?"
1962.69,1,40596,randolph_w_thrower,,2967.817,2970.527,"Yes, if I may come to that subject -- yes, that would --"
1962.69,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2970.527,2971.845,"Well, can I just ask you, when you [Inaudible] --"
1962.69,1,40596,randolph_w_thrower,,2971.845,2972.572,[Inaudible]
1962.69,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2972.572,2979.24,"-- discussing it, are there any counts that relate to the -- that mailing is based on --"
1962.69,1,40596,randolph_w_thrower,,2979.24,2980.61,Seven of the accounts --
1962.69,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2980.61,2980.786,Yes.
1962.69,1,40596,randolph_w_thrower,,2980.786,2982.18,-- not dismissed by the District Court --
1962.69,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2982.18,2983.015,Right.
1962.69,1,40596,randolph_w_thrower,,2983.015,2988.193,-- related to that mailing and it was because of that that the Court did not dismiss it.
1962.69,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2990.493,2991.334,Yes.
1962.69,1,40596,randolph_w_thrower,,2991.334,3025.168,But with respect to the subsequent mailings our position is that the reference to the scheme or artifice to obtain money by false pretenses stated within the statute refers to the offense of fraud or obtaining money by false pretenses that that offense is committed finally and irrevocably when the wrong doer receives all of the money which he is seeking and which he expects to get.
1962.69,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3038.168,3044.485,Are these the ones clear even though all of these other mailings were contemplated by the scheme in advance?
1962.69,1,40596,randolph_w_thrower,,3044.485,3045.582,They may be related.
1962.69,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3061.442,3064.258,"Well, did you base on Parr and Kann?"
1962.69,1,40596,randolph_w_thrower,,3064.258,3075.78,On Parr and Kann and I would like to discuss those cases to the extent of pointing out that that was a clear holding of each of those cases.
1962.69,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,3336.523,3354.558,"Mr. Thrower, [Inaudible]"
1962.69,1,40596,randolph_w_thrower,,3354.558,3360.148,That is our position exactly with respect to the mailings here.
1962.69,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3362.112,3370.891,"Well, under the law of conspiracy if they join together for the purposes of doing that isn’t that a -- doesn’t that make it a continuing conspiracy?"
1962.69,1,40596,randolph_w_thrower,,3370.891,3386.095,"Mr. Chief Justice, to bring a conspiracy within the coverage of this statute, it must be shown that they conspired to use the mails to defraud."
1962.69,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3433.575,3433.915,[Inaudible] --
1962.69,1,40596,randolph_w_thrower,,3433.915,3434.491,I beg --
1962.69,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3434.491,3469.527,"If it was to keep the scheme alive and operative in the community as against all of these people that they named that says that it been -- beginning prior to March 9th, 1956 and continuing until June 1, 1959, the defendants, a corporation devised and intended to devise a scheme and artifice to defraud then naming about 40 people and numerous and diverse other persons throughout the United States were owners of businesses and so forth."
1962.69,1,40596,randolph_w_thrower,,3503.084,3511.654,"Well, that depends upon what statute intends to refer to when it uses the ten -- the term scheme or artifice."
1962.69,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3717.101,3719.397,At what point was it executed?
1962.69,1,40596,randolph_w_thrower,,3719.397,3737.133,"It was executed when they wrongfully obtained and converted to their possession the gas and the oil and the services even though it remained later for the burden to fall, through their efforts and according with -- to their plans upon the School District."
1962.69,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3737.133,3745.698,And those subsequent events involved the mailings I gather of the -- by the gas station of the bill and the return by mail of the check.
1962.69,1,40596,randolph_w_thrower,,3745.698,3757.622,And this Court held that that was controlled by the Kann case and that those mailings was not a part of the execution of the fraud.
1962.69,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3762.19,3771.23,Was there any argument in that case that they were made for the purpose of those things related on for the purpose of concealing the fraud?
1962.69,1,40596,randolph_w_thrower,,3771.23,3802.221,"Well, I think it was -- I think it was very -- I think Your Honor that it was apparent from the face of the transaction that the sending of the bill and the return of the check was essential to the concealment of the transaction because it had to be cleared through the books and the payment office of the School District as a normal and routine business expense of the School District."
1962.69,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3803.775,3811.633,"That was not a part of the scheme by which the money was obtained, was it, that they would do this to conceal it?"
1962.69,1,40596,randolph_w_thrower,,3811.633,3822.651,"Well, it was essential that it be concealed that the School District would not -- could not pay their personal gas and oil expenses."
1962.69,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3830.677,3833.467,"Well, who did the mailings?"
1962.69,1,40596,randolph_w_thrower,,3833.467,3844.738,The mailing was done by the -- first by the gas company and then it was done by the School District which was controlled by the defendants.
1962.69,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3844.738,3847.914,"Well, the defendants could have [Inaudible]?"
1962.69,1,40596,randolph_w_thrower,,3847.914,3848.579,I beg your pardon?
1962.69,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3848.579,3851.412,The defendants themselves did the [Inaudible]?
1962.69,1,40596,randolph_w_thrower,,3851.412,3858.393,"They -- alright, to the extent that they controlled the School District, they did the mailing --"
1962.69,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3858.393,3858.86,Who did the mailing --
1962.69,1,40596,randolph_w_thrower,,3858.86,3859.413,-- to the extent --
1962.69,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3859.413,3862.189,-- in the Kann case?
1962.69,1,40596,randolph_w_thrower,,3862.189,3863.624,The bank did the mailing.
1962.69,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3863.624,3868.877,The bank in Kann did the -- after the money had been received by the people who had defrauded the others to get it?
1962.69,1,40596,randolph_w_thrower,,3868.877,3869.562,Yes.
1962.69,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3870.15,3875.818,What did you do with this [Inaudible] in Kann in reference to your answers to the Chief Justice?
1962.69,1,40596,randolph_w_thrower,,3898.061,3912.773,I think Your Honor that what is referred to there are mailings subsequent to one fraud which a part of the execution and contribute to the execution of a further fraud.
1962.69,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3929.158,3929.451,Does it have to --
1962.69,1,40596,randolph_w_thrower,,3929.451,3930.017,-- a mailing --
1962.69,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3930.017,3930.642,-- [Inaudible]?
1962.69,1,40596,randolph_w_thrower,,3930.642,3938.036,A mailing may lull that victim so as to persuade in to invest more money in the enterprise.
1962.69,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3938.036,3939.547,Does there have to be a single victim?
1962.69,1,40596,randolph_w_thrower,,3940.546,3941.433,Where there have been cases --
1962.69,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3941.433,3942.893,-– to bring these numbers of people.
1962.69,1,40596,randolph_w_thrower,,3942.893,3943.15,Yes.
1962.69,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4181.466,4187.988,"Well, aren’t there other things besides concealment involved here Mr. Thrower?"
1962.69,1,40596,randolph_w_thrower,,4266.184,4290.017,"May it please Your Honor, I would answer that by saying that there is no federal statute which makes it a federal offense to conspire to defraud nor is there a federal statute which makes it an offense to mail letters that are related to such a conspiracy."
1962.69,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4300.618,4301.151,Yes.
1962.69,1,40596,randolph_w_thrower,,4301.151,4306.11,And this Court held in the Kann case and the execution of fraud.
1962.69,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4306.11,4308.09,"Yes, but the execution of the scheme?"
1962.69,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4308.09,4309.331,The scheme?
1962.69,1,40596,randolph_w_thrower,,4309.331,4327.829,"Well this Court, there was a scheme in Kann and in Parr which was a continuing scheme and this Court held that the terms scheme or artifice as referred to in Kann and Parr met the particular transaction."
1962.69,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4354.825,4360.858,"But you -- do you say that they're not quite [Inaudible], that there were -- the Government alleged 44 schemes --"
1962.69,1,40596,randolph_w_thrower,,4360.858,4362.15,Within the meaning of the statute?
1962.69,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4362.15,4363.089,[Inaudible]
1962.69,1,40596,randolph_w_thrower,,4363.089,4363.404,"Yes, yes."
1962.69,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4363.404,4368.217,But then you deny it -- you do not [Inaudible] one ongoing scheme.
1962.69,1,40596,randolph_w_thrower,,4368.217,4378.207,"We concede -- the question is, what is the statute referring to, words or scheme or artifice to obtain money by false pretenses?"
1962.69,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4383.181,4385.383,Are you going to argue the [Inaudible]?
1962.69,1,40596,randolph_w_thrower,,4385.383,4392.734,"Well, I hope to Your Honor and I have an intermediate point which I will have to --"
1962.69,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4392.734,4394.794,I -- I don’t want to take too much of your time --
1962.69,1,40596,randolph_w_thrower,,4394.794,4395.222,Yes.
1962.69,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4395.222,4398.454,-- but may I just on this first point.
1962.69,1,40596,randolph_w_thrower,,4419.576,4420.905,We see no distinction.
1962.69,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4459.88,4460.105,"Well, --"
1962.69,1,40596,randolph_w_thrower,,4460.105,4460.96,Excuse me (Voice Overlap) --
1962.69,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4460.96,4469.088,-- as to the facts to what you answered me before that the real objective of the fraud was to get this money and once they had it the fraud was executed.
1962.69,1,40596,randolph_w_thrower,,4469.088,4471.654,"Now, let me refer to the preliminary mailings."
1962.69,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4696.454,4698.234,What the District Court says about its dismissal?
1962.69,1,40596,randolph_w_thrower,,4698.234,4698.889,It paid no --
1962.69,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4698.889,4699.148,Didn’t say anything --
1962.69,1,40596,randolph_w_thrower,,4699.148,4700.026,-- comment about it.
1962.69,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4700.134,4701.845,I was looking but I couldn’t --
1962.69,1,40596,randolph_w_thrower,,4701.845,4703.442,Left it to us to --
1962.69,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4703.442,4705.005,Didn’t say a word about -- about its reason?
1962.69,1,40596,randolph_w_thrower,,4705.005,4708.507,"Except for the dismissal it said nothing further, it did not explain."
1962.69,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4716.867,4722.558,That was the only basis on which -- the only basis stated in the motion?
1962.69,1,40596,randolph_w_thrower,,4722.558,4733.457,"There was the further basis that the -- a further argument, that not of the substantive counts alleged federal expense but presumably, it did not move on that basis because it upheld some of the --"
1962.69,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4733.457,4734.796,Because he didn’t throw all the counts out.
1962.69,1,40596,randolph_w_thrower,,4734.796,4737.409,"So, we have assumed that it was on that basis."
1962.69,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,4859.628,4873.299,[Inaudible]
1962.69,1,40596,randolph_w_thrower,,4873.299,4883.86,"Well, I think that reference to the salesmen best illustrates the scope of this charge because it’s indicated that the salesmen had a limited function."
1962.69,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4924.308,4934.788,"Well, I thought he hired out to do these things and was trained to do them, specifically trained in the school to perform these kind of acts?"
1962.69,1,40596,randolph_w_thrower,,4934.788,4936.609,"Well -- well, that is true."
1962.69,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4944.289,4945.901,"Yes, I -- that’s --"
1962.69,1,40596,randolph_w_thrower,,4945.901,4946.421,"Yes, yes."
1962.69,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4946.421,4946.52,(Inaudible)
1962.69,1,40596,randolph_w_thrower,,4946.52,4959.626,"There was no -- and Your Honor, we recognize that each of the salesmen maybe indicted as a part of this total conspiracy."
1962.69,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4959.626,4960.254,Yes.
1962.69,1,40596,randolph_w_thrower,,4960.254,4969.089,We are questioning whether each salesman can be included within each substantive offense.
1962.69,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5009.026,5012.435,"Now, wouldn’t that be a matter of proof at the trial?"
1962.69,1,40596,randolph_w_thrower,,5012.435,5018.261,"Well, we think this is apparent on the face of the indictment, Your Honor."
1962.69,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5095.524,5142.557,"But here as I understand it, he did play a part because he had -- it was the salesman who went to the -- to Chester J. French in this case and told him what the transaction was to be and gave him this Lender Service Corporation contract which includes the statement, this agreement shall become effective when accepted at any regional office and so forth that notifications shall be made, he got the man’s signature on that and then took it to his principles with the understanding by all parties concerned, the salesman included that that was to be returned as a part of the transaction."
1962.69,1,40596,randolph_w_thrower,,5142.557,5143.398,"True, Your Honor."
1962.69,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5156.688,5157.897,"Well, they all didn’t --"
1962.69,1,40596,randolph_w_thrower,,5157.897,5158.651,"Then, that gives the question --"
1962.69,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5158.651,5159.809,They all had their own transactions.
1962.69,1,40596,randolph_w_thrower,,5159.992,5171.717,"They -- well, we would acknowledge too that the salesman could be indicted to participate for the participation in the substantive offense where he made the sale."
1962.69,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,5192.013,5203.176,"So, assuming if your argument [Inaudible] would not be dismissed?"
1962.69,1,40596,randolph_w_thrower,,5203.176,5203.567,Well --
1962.69,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,5203.567,5224.328,[Inaudible]
1962.69,1,40596,randolph_w_thrower,,5224.328,5249.262,"Well, my argument would indicate that each of the substantive counts is in reality a conspiracy count drawn as such encompassing everyone in every substantive offense so that the so-called substantive offense is really -- there were 43 conspiracies, each naming a particular overt act and --"
1962.69,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,5249.262,5255.132,[Inaudible]?
1962.69,1,40596,randolph_w_thrower,,5255.132,5267.55,We would recognize that one of those counts is a good count if any one of them faced a conspiracy to use the mails and -- for the purpose of executing.
1962.69,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5299.925,5305.229,You -- you apparently agree with the District Court’s dismissal?
1962.69,1,40596,randolph_w_thrower,,5305.229,5305.799,"Oh, yes."
1962.69,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5305.866,5331.969,And the – [Inaudible] I assume the -- your position must be include that the individual counts are conspiracy [Inaudible] and all of whom connected with the conspiracy [Inaudible] evidence?
1962.69,1,40596,randolph_w_thrower,,5331.969,5334.078,"Well, we think that would be the result."
1962.69,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5369.9,5383.488,"But that must be on the premise as Mr. Justice White has said that what's -- are already pending without the conspiracy count are themselves, conspiracy count scheme."
1962.69,1,40596,randolph_w_thrower,,5383.488,5383.784,Yes.
1962.69,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5415.595,5422.686,Your authority for this [Inaudible] or do you have some other [Inaudible]?
1962.69,1,40596,randolph_w_thrower,,5422.686,5432.154,I think that this -- there is -- I find no precedent for this kind of an indictment coming before this Court.
1962.69,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5449.763,5451.473,Thank you Mr. Thrower.
1962.69,2,28314,howard_p_willens,,5453.3,5465.64,"Mr. Chief Justice, I just like to take a moment to correct a misunderstanding that I may have caused in response to a question from Mr. Justice Goldberg."
1962.69,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5556.481,5563.922,"Well, does your (Inaudible) -- is it your contention that the substantive counts for themselves conspiracies, or do you deny that?"
1962.69,2,28314,howard_p_willens,,5563.922,5575.622,We really grant that there's a similarity in substantive mail fraud counts with conspiracy counts but we don’t think that the similarity is particularly relevant to the issue now before this Court.
1962.69,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5575.622,5581.2,"Well, it’s -- you mean, it isn’t relevant at all as to whether or not you can have an additional conspiracy count?"
1962.69,2,28314,howard_p_willens,,5581.2,5584.58,"No, we think the conspiracy count was improperly been dismissed."
