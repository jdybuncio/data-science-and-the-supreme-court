2008.07-901,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,5.118,"We will hear argument next in Case 07-901, Oregon v. Ice."
2008.07-901,0,36859,mary_h_williams,,6.57,25.781,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The factfinding at issue in this case is significantly different than the factfinding at issue in this Court's recent Sixth Amendment cases, in which the Court struck down changes in sentencing practice that had the effect of removing factfinding from the province of the jury."
2008.07-901,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,83.32,113.839,"Well, but it, it, by reason of the unusual law at issue here I think it's unusual, I don't I'm unaware of any other State that has one the sentences the defendant has an entitlement to have the sentences run concurrently unless a certain additional fact exists and that additional fact is to be found by the judge rather than by the jury."
2008.07-901,0,36859,mary_h_williams,,137.205,155.0,"Justice Scalia, first on the point in terms of how unique this statute is, there are other States that have similar requirements, that there is initial a presumption that multiple sentences will be concurrent unless there is additional nonjury factfinding that authorizes the judge to impose consecutive sentences."
2008.07-901,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,156.535,157.118,How many others?
2008.07-901,0,36859,mary_h_williams,,158.118,173.812,"--It's difficult actually to come up with an exact count, and the numbers vary when you look at how other courts have sort of combined cases, but perhaps as many as 13, but as different States have sort of changed their practice some of those have fallen away."
2008.07-901,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,221.561,230.333,"You know, this fact can can turn out to be the most significant fact for the defendant."
2008.07-901,0,36859,mary_h_williams,,240.689,254.699,"Yes, Your Honor, and in this case, for example, the additional factfinding extends the whole duration of the of Mr. Ice's period of incarceration from 90 months to 340 months."
2008.07-901,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,281.683,298.311,"But you could say the same about sentencing in general, and we held that the Sixth Amendment does impose a limitation upon judicial power where at least there is an entitlement by law to a certain lower sentence."
2008.07-901,0,36859,mary_h_williams,,307.583,314.487,I think what's important is the foundation for that holding and the foundation for the Apprendi rule.
2008.07-901,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,363.837,364.32,The rule--
2008.07-901,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,364.32,376.161,"The rule does bear on culpability, and culpability sounds like part of the definition of an offense or a more serious offense."
2008.07-901,0,36859,mary_h_williams,,376.161,377.811,"Yes, Your Honor."
2008.07-901,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,396.855,400.807,I don't understand why this happenstance is required to do it under the statute.
2008.07-901,0,36859,mary_h_williams,,404.092,404.711,Well--
2008.07-901,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,404.711,405.978,You said it's only happenstance.
2008.07-901,0,36859,mary_h_williams,,408.413,430.177,"--No, what I'm trying to say is that I think the Oregon Supreme Court viewed the fact that so far in this Court's cases you had only been dealing with a single offense and a single sentence, as -- as not foreclosing the possibility that there would be a different statutory maximum when you have multiple sentences being imposed for multiple convictions."
2008.07-901,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,456.577,460.129,"Well, didn't we furnish the premise for that broader reasoning?"
2008.07-901,0,36859,mary_h_williams,,515.616,521.0,That the jury does not lose anything that the jury historically had within its--
2008.07-901,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,521.0,541.545,"No, but isn't the problem with that argument the problem that Justice Scalia raised a moment ago, where you could have made the same argument with respect to a mandatory State guideline, but nonetheless, the change in the law brought to bear on the new law an old concept."
2008.07-901,0,36859,mary_h_williams,,571.766,593.763,"--But there's something different here in terms of looking back on history and what we have presently, compared to when you are looking at the offense-specific sentence associated with a specific conviction, because the changes in practice there had the effect of taking away the ability to find an element or something that was the equivalent of an element, of removing that from the jury."
2008.07-901,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,600.952,644.445,"So I gather from your argument that you would -- you would be taking the other side and you would be saying that it has to go to the jury if, instead of being a statute that applies to concurrent sentences from various crimes, there was added to a particular crime, if this crime was committed with the use of a gun, any sentence imposed shall not run concurrently but shall run consecutively with any other sentence arising out of this same occurrence?"
2008.07-901,0,36859,mary_h_williams,,644.445,646.664,I think--
2008.07-901,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,646.664,648.766,There it's attached to a particular crime.
2008.07-901,0,36859,mary_h_williams,,654.468,668.144,"--No, Your Honor, I don't, although I think that makes it a more difficult situation to try to analyze, because there it is -- it is focused on a specific sentence for a specific offense."
2008.07-901,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,702.567,710.887,"You could say the same thing about the length of the sentence, that it was up to them and they considered a wide array of facts."
2008.07-901,0,36859,mary_h_williams,,724.78,742.575,"--But I think what's different is that the history at issue and underlying Apprendi actually wasn't that the judge could simply make nonjury factfinding and expand the sentence beyond what the sentence was that was associated with the jury's verdict; that, in fact, that was the problem."
2008.07-901,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,814.421,818.956,Am I right in -- I just want to get the facts right.
2008.07-901,0,36859,mary_h_williams,,842.738,845.94,--It is an overstatement only in the sense that I did not go back as far as--
2008.07-901,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,845.94,846.824,I didn't say how far you went back.
2008.07-901,0,36859,mary_h_williams,,849.325,850.141,--As far as I went--
2008.07-901,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,850.141,856.812,"I don't know what Nebuchadnezzar found, but I take it you did look to see what was true at the time of the writing of the Constitution."
2008.07-901,0,36859,mary_h_williams,,856.812,857.414,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2008.07-901,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,857.414,872.757,"And at the time of the writing of the Constitution, which sometimes some of us feel is relevant, in that instance they did have the judge, not the jury, decide how to create a total sentence where the person had committed two crimes on the same occasion."
2008.07-901,0,36859,mary_h_williams,,872.757,873.424,"Yes, exactly."
2008.07-901,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,880.828,883.13,But you could say the same in Apprendi.
2008.07-901,0,36859,mary_h_williams,,892.902,893.469,--But where--
2008.07-901,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,893.469,907.859,"And yet when you constrain the judge and you say, judge, you cannot give more than 20 years unless the crime was committed with a -- with a gun, we said suddenly that that matter can no longer be left to the judge."
2008.07-901,0,36859,mary_h_williams,,918.934,938.914,"--But what this Court focused on with the Apprendi rule is that, although judges made decisions about sentencing within a range of possible sentences, what judges could not do was to find additional facts that were the functional equivalent of an element of a greater offense."
2008.07-901,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,941.033,958.744,"But we defined in effect what was the functional element of the greater offense in terms of the -- the power or the capacity of the judge to increase the sentence beyond the range that would have been -- that would have established the maximum in the absence of that factfinding, right?"
2008.07-901,0,36859,mary_h_williams,,958.744,959.377,--Correct.
2008.07-901,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,959.377,960.111,All right.
2008.07-901,0,36859,mary_h_williams,,1009.858,1015.496,"Your Honor, I do not accept that it is a -- an enhanced penalty for any of the specific convictions."
2008.07-901,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1015.496,1017.364,Everybody agrees.
2008.07-901,0,36859,mary_h_williams,,1017.364,1019.65,And it would be--
2008.07-901,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1019.65,1027.57,"If you had a choice between two concurrent sentences and two consecutive sentences, you know which one you are going to choose."
2008.07-901,0,36859,mary_h_williams,,1032.04,1039.544,--It does have certainly a harsher effect on the defendant than serving each of the sentences beginning at the same time.
2008.07-901,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1055.339,1065.095,But the mandatory minimum is at least within the range of sentencing possibilities that the judge could impose anyway without any further factfinding by the jury.
2008.07-901,0,36859,mary_h_williams,,1065.095,1079.021,"And depending on how you view this in terms of if you are looking at it with an offense-specific frame, each sentence imposed for each of the six convictions is also within the range of what the judge can impose."
2008.07-901,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1093.178,1101.701,"What about the -- what about restitution, forfeiture, taking a child and having him tried as an adult?"
2008.07-901,0,36859,mary_h_williams,,1126.149,1140.743,"Yes, Your Honor, and we are now litigating some of those very questions in light of the Oregon Supreme Court decision about what is the scope when you look beyond the specific sentence imposed for a specific conviction and look at this greater quantum of punishment--"
2008.07-901,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1140.743,1160.239,"It's a lot easier to limit it to sentence than it is to limit it to sentence for a particular conviction as opposed to sentence for the whole ball of wax, all of the -- all of the horribles that Justice Breyer proposes would -- would be overcome if -- if you just adopted a rule that only applies to sentences."
2008.07-901,0,36859,mary_h_williams,,1160.239,1171.112,"--Although, Your Honor, some of these Douse-Greene decisions that are made again by nonjury factfinding do affect what the defendant's period of incarceration is going to be."
2008.07-901,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1171.112,1182.253,"And doesn't the sentencing -- doesn't the Federal law define a sentence to include restitution, to include what is the equivalent of probation?"
2008.07-901,0,36859,mary_h_williams,,1191.192,1209.053,"Yes, Your Honor, and the same is true for Oregon, that the sentence imposed and if you -- the -- the judgments are set out in the joint appendix in this case, that set out each of the sentences imposed for each of the six convictions, and you will see that there are a number of things in addition to the term of incarceration that are a part of that sentence being imposed."
2008.07-901,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1209.053,1214.957,--May I ask you a question that may seem totally irrelevant?
2008.07-901,0,36859,mary_h_williams,,1222.747,1224.197,I--
2008.07-901,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1224.197,1227.967,It seems to me under your reasoning in your case you might say that case was wrong.
2008.07-901,0,36859,mary_h_williams,,1233.537,1262.271,"--No, Your Honor, I don't think that it is necessary to say that that decision is wrong to be consistent with the position I am asserting here or the decision in Harris, because there the Court made a distinction between what the jury traditionally would have been -- been doing and determined that that jury role was limited to deciding facts that increased only the -- the maximum penalty that the defendants faced."
2008.07-901,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1267.259,1267.792,"No, I understand."
2008.07-901,0,36859,mary_h_williams,,1285.753,1306.217,"And -- and what I have done is to start with the proposition that we have in place the Apprendi rule as it has been construed in McMillan and in Harris, but that this is a -- a very different extension of that rule beyond anything that this Court has addressed in these cases."
2008.07-901,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1357.065,1363.969,"And, of course, it's part of your position that historically sentences were always consecutive, if you go way back."
2008.07-901,0,36859,mary_h_williams,,1363.969,1373.091,"But, Your Honor, in the older cases we actually do find that they were -- there was discretion for the judge to have the sentences be served concurrently."
2008.07-901,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1426.543,1434.066,What happens with sentences from multiple States?
2008.07-901,0,36859,mary_h_williams,,1473.357,1492.835,"I think that if the -- the law required the sentences be concurrent unless additional factfindings were made, then under the -- the rule announced by the Oregon Supreme Court and advocated by Respondent that question would have to then go to the jury even if it arises in -- basically in separate proceedings."
2008.07-901,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1527.175,1529.342,"Thank you, counsel."
2008.07-901,1,22699,ernest_g_lannet,,1534.496,1540.382,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This case presents yet another application of the bright-line rule from Apprendi."
2008.07-901,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1563.228,1578.757,"Mr. Lannet, there -- there is one significant difference, I think, between -- the -- in Apprendi it doesn't matter whether the State labels something a ""sentencing factor"" or an ""element""."
2008.07-901,1,22699,ernest_g_lannet,,1652.702,1654.738,"Well, two points on that."
2008.07-901,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1712.224,1724.116,"In Oregon traditionally if a burglar had broken into a house and while he was in the house commits a rape, traditionally in Oregon that would not be considered two crimes?"
2008.07-901,1,22699,ernest_g_lannet,,1724.116,1729.935,At a certain point in time there were judicial rules in place regarding merger that may have resulted in the entry of one--
2008.07-901,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1729.935,1736.708,Can you cite me an Oregon case which says a burglar who breaks in and commits rape is only guilty of one crime?
2008.07-901,1,22699,ernest_g_lannet,,1736.708,1740.243,--I would be happy to submit some in a memorandum.
2008.07-901,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1741.827,1778.468,"Mr. Lannet, in -- in connection with Justice Ginsburg's question, do you think that Apprendi would apply differently to a statute which, instead of imposing a higher penalty for a crime committed with a firearm, said that the penalty will be 30 years for burglary unless the defendant did not commit the crime with a firearm, in which case it will be 15 years?"
2008.07-901,1,22699,ernest_g_lannet,,1790.51,1807.12,"I certainly it would raise an issue about whether -- a different statutory interpretation, of course, that if the State was merely shifting a burden on a fact to the defendant to disprove, I think that that would run into problems with this Court's due process -- case law."
2008.07-901,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1807.12,1824.731,"Well, regardless of who proved it, I mean, the issue is can it be left to the judge to decide whether the -- the -- the beneficent determination that he did not use a firearm could be left to the judge instead of sending it to the jury?"
2008.07-901,1,22699,ernest_g_lannet,,1824.731,1834.622,I think it would be very likely if this Court looked at this State's interpretation of the statute and found that the -- that the judge had no authority to impose the greater sentence?
2008.07-901,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1834.622,1840.026,I don't see a dime's worth of difference between that and Apprendi.
2008.07-901,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1840.026,1841.226,How are you to prove these?
2008.07-901,1,22699,ernest_g_lannet,,1868.343,1875.762,"Well, again I think there would be a question about whether that would be proper, if that would be in fact shifting an element over to the defendant to disprove."
2008.07-901,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1877.012,1885.218,"No, you are saying that the standard they use here for a separate sentencing, that it has to be a separate crime and so forth, has to go to the jury."
2008.07-901,1,22699,ernest_g_lannet,,1885.218,1886.068,"--Yes, sure."
2008.07-901,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1886.068,1887.151,Okay.
2008.07-901,1,22699,ernest_g_lannet,,1896.425,1903.162,"Well, actually, Your Honor, a decision affirming the Oregon Supreme Court at this point would have little impact in Oregon."
2008.07-901,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1917.922,1920.207,"That way, you have to have two--"
2008.07-901,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1920.207,1923.159,"Booker/Fanfan as well, as adopted, right?"
2008.07-901,1,22699,ernest_g_lannet,,1929.563,1930.029,--Yes.
2008.07-901,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1930.463,1932.931,Are you saying it would have to be a bifurcated proceeding?
2008.07-901,1,22699,ernest_g_lannet,,1932.931,1936.883,"In many instances, just based on--"
2008.07-901,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1936.883,1941.335,Is there historic evidence that bifurcated proceedings were required before Apprendi?
2008.07-901,1,22699,ernest_g_lannet,,1941.335,1948.024,"--No, but I think that this is just a development of changing legislative choices in identifying facts."
2008.07-901,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1956.427,1961.164,Could I get back to the question Justice Scalia asked about Apprendi.
2008.07-901,1,22699,ernest_g_lannet,,1987.749,1998.123,In Apprendi I am not sure that -- that -- I mean it's a question of whether all the facts have been found by the -- by the jury authorize the maximum punishment.
2008.07-901,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1998.889,1999.589,Then it does.
2008.07-901,1,22699,ernest_g_lannet,,2016.099,2037.862,"--Well, the potential penalty the defendant faces -- and I think that if the penalty of whether a gun is present or whether a gun is not present, assuming that that would be enacted by a legislature, I think that as long as -- I mean the core question in Apprendi has been is the judge imposing a penalty within the range authorized by the jury verdict."
2008.07-901,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2037.862,2048.586,"--The core question is is the defendant entitled, entitled, to get no more than a certain penalty if a particular fact is found."
2008.07-901,1,22699,ernest_g_lannet,,2048.586,2049.303,"Yes, sir."
2008.07-901,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2049.303,2056.342,"And the answer would be, yes, he is entitled if the fact is found that he didn't use a gun to get a lesser penalty."
2008.07-901,1,22699,ernest_g_lannet,,2063.163,2063.98,"Yes, Your Honor."
2008.07-901,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2063.98,2074.721,"--And in addition, it must be true too that the defendant is entitled not to pay restitution if the facts show that there was no money taken."
2008.07-901,1,22699,ernest_g_lannet,,2087.611,2095.634,"Well, if only because the legislative scheme in place doesn't give the court authority to impose restitutions based solely on the jury's verdict."
2008.07-901,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2095.634,2103.823,"No, couldn't impose restitution without making a finding as to how much money was taken."
2008.07-901,1,22699,ernest_g_lannet,,2108.209,2109.894,The Oregon appellate court doesn't--
2008.07-901,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2109.894,2110.711,--All right.
2008.07-901,1,22699,ernest_g_lannet,,2130.574,2135.942,"--If -- if it was a fact that was necessary for the punishment, I think that follows within the rule of Apprendi."
2008.07-901,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2135.942,2136.811,It's a punishment.
2008.07-901,1,22699,ernest_g_lannet,,2136.811,2139.763,Although in Apprendi there was a concern about elements being shifted from--
2008.07-901,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2139.763,2140.53,Maybe not.
2008.07-901,1,22699,ernest_g_lannet,,2170.665,2171.515,--I believe--
2008.07-901,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2171.515,2175.686,I'm not sure which of these things would actual follow from your rule and which wouldn't.
2008.07-901,1,22699,ernest_g_lannet,,2175.686,2185.392,--I think legislatively that the general statutes would set the maximum penalty as being punished as an adult and the juvenile system would be a different type of system.
2008.07-901,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2185.392,2195.516,But they will say no one can get this lower punishment for the juvenile system unless the person is indeed a juvenile.
2008.07-901,1,22699,ernest_g_lannet,,2198.349,2207.824,"Well, Your Honor, the brightline rule of Apprendi as it applies in the sentencing in this case is a question of what the judge can impose in a proceeding that was initiated--"
2008.07-901,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2207.824,2227.386,"If we are going to depart from what the Framers did in fact foresee in this kind of case and we do accept Apprendi as something different from what they did apply, does that require us to depart as well in all these other cases which have the kinds of differences that you have listened to?"
2008.07-901,1,22699,ernest_g_lannet,,2227.386,2229.654,--I believe that this Court already has.
2008.07-901,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2252.5,2255.869,May I ask you a rather broad question?
2008.07-901,1,22699,ernest_g_lannet,,2255.869,2256.404,"Yes, sir."
2008.07-901,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2256.404,2261.439,In Apprendi the opinions were rather lengthy and discussed precedents at great length.
2008.07-901,1,22699,ernest_g_lannet,,2274.531,2279.833,I believe I would have Jones v. the United States and I think that it would be--
2008.07-901,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2279.833,2281.302,I didn't hear that.
2008.07-901,1,22699,ernest_g_lannet,,2281.302,2285.004,"--Jones, where the--"
2008.07-901,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2285.004,2285.537,Jones--
2008.07-901,1,22699,ernest_g_lannet,,2285.537,2290.408,"--Jones v. the United States, where this Court interpreted this as a matter of constitutional balance."
2008.07-901,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2290.408,2293.058,--What if it had arisen before Jones?
2008.07-901,1,22699,ernest_g_lannet,,2293.058,2299.947,"Then I think that it would -- that this Court, if it engaged in the historical analysis it did and see that, yes--"
2008.07-901,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2299.947,2304.315,And then the historical analysis was to prove citation to what cases?
2008.07-901,1,22699,ernest_g_lannet,,2304.315,2308.035,--I believe the cases that were cited -- I don't think--
2008.07-901,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2308.035,2312.071,All the cases in Apprendi dealt with elements of the crime and that sort of thing.
2008.07-901,1,22699,ernest_g_lannet,,2312.071,2312.704,--Yes.
2008.07-901,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2334.085,2349.946,"What if under the law the judge upon sentencing is supposed to make a determination of where the defendant should be sent, which facility, based on determination of which one has the most room."
2008.07-901,1,22699,ernest_g_lannet,,2353.398,2361.42,"I believe that that -- that can be distinguished, because it was would be a determination not based on punishment and not to impose a punishment on defendant."
2008.07-901,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2362.104,2370.193,"Even if one was, you know, the most horrendous prison in history and the other was one of -- a country club?"
2008.07-901,1,22699,ernest_g_lannet,,2370.193,2386.952,"--No, I believe this Court has repeatedly stated in -- in downstream like decisions after convictions that whenever someone was convicted of an offense and sentenced to incarceration by executive agency, you are subject to the policies of that agency and there may be certain due process."
2008.07-901,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2386.952,2391.689,"Yes, but here in my hypothetical it's something that a judge puts in the sentence."
2008.07-901,1,22699,ernest_g_lannet,,2400.145,2412.27,"Well, this Court has identified a bright line rule that it's not the particular of the fact whether it would be something that would be historically found by the jury, but rather a fact that functions to increase punishment."
2008.07-901,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2430.831,2483.466,"Mr. Lannet, if we agree with your position and let's say you are engaged by the Oregon legislature and they say to you: We don't want to make this just be the judge's discretion alone, what can we do to achieve Constitution of what we were trying to achieve, that is to say encourage as the main rule but -- that is, if we have to leave it to the judge's discretion but we want to rein in that discretion so that you don't have arbitrary differences going from one judge to another?"
2008.07-901,1,22699,ernest_g_lannet,,2499.975,2510.683,"I think they could do as they are doing in what this Court has decided is juries are finding those facts, and that a trial court does not have to impose a consecutive sentence."
2008.07-901,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2511.383,2517.421,"The juries are find -- that's what is going on now, the juries are part of this trial of guilt?"
2008.07-901,1,22699,ernest_g_lannet,,2517.421,2524.825,--If ordering the bifurcated proceeding much the way the aggravating factors under Oregon's guidelines assumes everything handles in the wake of--
2008.07-901,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2524.825,2525.225,Which is it?
2008.07-901,1,22699,ernest_g_lannet,,2529.479,2535.633,--It falls into the condition of what is defined as offense-related or offender-related factors.
2008.07-901,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2543.202,2550.392,Where -- where a defense attorney might not want all of that stuff to come out.
2008.07-901,1,22699,ernest_g_lannet,,2550.392,2559.664,"Well, this Court has observed repeatedly that -- that the right to a jury trial is one that can be waived, and so the defendants have the opportunity to not exercise those rights."
2008.07-901,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2574.674,2588.148,What if the -- what if the rule were that all sentences should be concurrent unless the defendant has been convicted of a prior federal offense and then the sentence runs consecutive to the federal sentence?
2008.07-901,1,22699,ernest_g_lannet,,2588.148,2614.382,"Well, if that was -- if the Almendarez-Torres prior conviction exception is a Sixth Amendment issue, which the Court has stated that it is, then I believe that there would not be required a jury finding, much like if the legislature identified facts that would be reflected in the jury's verdict, or reverted back to the common law rule which gave the trial court authority to impose consecutive sentences merely on the basis of if there was a conviction."
2008.07-901,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2659.827,2674.087,"Mr. Lannet, one of the -- or perhaps the driving force behind Apprendi was the fear of abuse by a combination of the charging power and the sentencing power."
2008.07-901,1,22699,ernest_g_lannet,,2679.49,2700.654,"Well, I think that it would send a message to legislatures that they can enact statutory schemes that have -- that allow for many instances where consecutive sentences are authorized based on the facts and that those facts do not implicate a Apprendi role, and therefore is a--"
2008.07-901,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2700.654,2701.154,That it would--
2008.07-901,1,22699,ernest_g_lannet,,2701.154,2701.671,--Yes.
2008.07-901,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2703.956,2705.289,"--No, I didn't mean to interrupt."
2008.07-901,1,22699,ernest_g_lannet,,2705.289,2714.562,"To set maximum punishment based on consecutiveness rather than, as they were doing under the guideline system, by allowing a range and requiring facts to exceed that range."
2008.07-901,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2714.562,2724.62,"They -- they would do by consecutive sentencing the same sort of thing that they were trying to do or some legislatures, Congress was trying to do by the sentencing factors?"
2008.07-901,1,22699,ernest_g_lannet,,2724.62,2727.737,"I believe there's at least a great possibility of that, yes."
2008.07-901,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2727.737,2730.104,Is there any room for harmless error here?
2008.07-901,1,22699,ernest_g_lannet,,2740.462,2755.655,"Well, I think this Court should not find those errors harmless beyond a reasonable doubt for several reasons: First, the State has the burden of proof that it's harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, and has not attempted to do before the Oregon courts, the appellate courts; it has not done so before this Court."
2008.07-901,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2759.773,2763.909,"I mean, is there any doubt that he wanted to commit an offense twice?"
2008.07-901,1,22699,ernest_g_lannet,,2763.909,2767.361,--I think that praises an issue of statutory interpretation.
2008.07-901,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2768.979,2771.581,But statutory interpretation questions aren't for the jury.
2008.07-901,1,22699,ernest_g_lannet,,2771.581,2797.065,"--You are right, Your Honor, but they are the ones for the Oregon Supreme Court in this instance, and the Oregon Supreme Court narrowly concluded that the findings of the jury found -- did not establish the factual predicate to impose consecutive sentences; however, they did not go into a comprehensive analysis of what precisely those facts are, and in fact the State -- the Petitioner here is actively litigating the meaning of the statutory provisions at this point."
2008.07-901,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2821.597,2825.465,"It held as far as the State constitution went, this is fine."
2008.07-901,1,22699,ernest_g_lannet,,2830.286,2841.844,"Yes, I would acknowledge that there is no analysis in the written decision, and that is part of the problem because it didn't identify the particular facts and conduct a harmless error analysis for the benefit of this Court."
2008.07-901,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2935.204,2955.017,One way of -- if you are right about the application of Apprendi -- the Oregon legislature could say as a main rule is we leave it to the judge's discretion.
2008.07-901,1,22699,ernest_g_lannet,,2969.027,2987.255,"I believe so, if that kind of statutory provision was interpreted like you are suggesting, that the court has authority based solely on the jury's verdict and is merely exercising its discretion and there is no requisite factfinding or the -- even the requirement to find a fact to impose a consecutive sentence, then I think it wouldn't praise an Apprendi issue."
2008.07-901,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2987.255,2988.555,No entitlement to a lesser sentence?
2008.07-901,1,22699,ernest_g_lannet,,2988.555,2989.94,"No entitlement to a lesser sentence, Your Honor."
2008.07-901,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2991.64,2995.858,Even if it's subject to judicial review for judicial review for abuse of discretion?
2008.07-901,1,22699,ernest_g_lannet,,2995.858,2996.892,I believe so.
2008.07-901,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2999.06,3004.964,"That doesn't give you an entitlement to that, to the exercise of discretion that isn't abused?"
2008.07-901,1,22699,ernest_g_lannet,,3004.964,3009.435,--Not an entitlement that is based solely on the facts found by the jury's verdict.
2008.07-901,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3086.516,3093.089,"Counsel, don't -- well, the case that I mentioned on my account."
2008.07-901,1,22699,ernest_g_lannet,,3096.207,3098.541,Thank you very much.
2008.07-901,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3098.541,3099.243,Ms. Williams.
2008.07-901,2,36859,mary_h_williams,,3100.593,3102.36,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
