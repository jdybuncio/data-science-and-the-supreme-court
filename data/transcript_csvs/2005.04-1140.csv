2005.04-1140,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,5.376,We'll hear argument first this morning in Martin versus Franklin Capital Corporation.
2005.04-1140,0,41514,samuel_h_heldman,,6.476,10.324,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
2005.04-1140,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,169.421,175.474,"Well, Rule 11 is about frivolous arguments and motions, is it not?"
2005.04-1140,0,41514,samuel_h_heldman,,175.474,179.506,"It is... yes, Your Honor, that's the shorthand of Rule 11."
2005.04-1140,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,179.506,184.621,Yes. And Christiansburg Garment is about unreasonable arguments.
2005.04-1140,0,41514,samuel_h_heldman,,189.747,206.57,"I would... I agree with you, Your Honor, there is that... there is a possible sliver of a distinction, but I... and, I submit, any lawyer advising a client and any lawyer advising himself or herself... would have a hard time differentiating between the two standards, in practice, so as actually--"
2005.04-1140,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,206.57,207.814,Don't you think you know it when you see it?
2005.04-1140,0,41514,samuel_h_heldman,,209.574,213.19,"--I try to avoid all of them, Your Honor, the frivolous and the unreasonable, both."
2005.04-1140,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,214.306,222.598,"But, when Congress passed this language, the scope of Rule 11 was not as well defined and understood as it is now."
2005.04-1140,0,41514,samuel_h_heldman,,227.214,236.972,"The overlap may not have been perfect, at least, among other things, in the sense that some courts were still under the misimpression that there was a subjective element to Rule 11, as well."
2005.04-1140,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,260.647,285.768,"When you talk about the text, though... and I understand that the ""may"" language here has been read by the Court in very different ways, depending upon the statute... but you have a statute that literally alternates sentences between ""shall/may"", ""shall/may"", and it seems to me that if your rule is closer to ""shall"" than ""may"", it seems that it was an odd choice of words for Congress to employ."
2005.04-1140,0,41514,samuel_h_heldman,,285.768,295.176,"--I think the reason why I would disagree with that, respectfully, Your Honor, is, we are not suggesting that it means ""shall"" in all instances in which a case is remanded."
2005.04-1140,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,322.973,340.696,"But that... it could be remanded sua sponte for any number of reasons, so... so, you're saying not that there is some wiggle room to allow ""may"" to operate, you're simply saying it depends on the party that initiates the remand."
2005.04-1140,0,41514,samuel_h_heldman,,354.136,354.586,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2005.04-1140,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,377.551,389.847,What about the plaintiff who waits over a year to move for remand when it appears as though the case is going in the defendant's favor?
2005.04-1140,0,41514,samuel_h_heldman,,408.148,420.244,"--I think, even in that hypothetical case, which I will say, next, is not this case... even in that hypothetical case, it is still the plaintiff who has the cleanest hands of all."
2005.04-1140,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,424.693,431.58,Just... you say that your presumptive fees are included would cover that case.
2005.04-1140,0,41514,samuel_h_heldman,,441.499,443.343,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
2005.04-1140,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,469.296,473.994,"Well, indeed, wasn't there a change in the law after the case was removed?"
2005.04-1140,0,41514,samuel_h_heldman,,473.994,478.787,"--There were relevant changes in law in some Circuits, Your Honor."
2005.04-1140,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,485.84,503.563,"Well, the Tenth Circuit, I thought, held that the District Court was within its discretion to deny the award, because, at the time of the removal, the defendants had objectively reasonable grounds to believe that removal was proper."
2005.04-1140,0,41514,samuel_h_heldman,,503.563,504.396,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2005.04-1140,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,587.215,592.924,"Well, you stated, at the outset... and, I think, properly so... that we're interested in what incentives--"
2005.04-1140,0,41514,samuel_h_heldman,,592.924,594.268,"Yes, Your Honor."
2005.04-1140,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,594.268,598.05,--are put in place by whatever rule we adopt.
2005.04-1140,0,41514,samuel_h_heldman,,625.098,635.101,"I... my basic answer as to why that would be the policy, Your Honor, are, again, the textual reasons and the large objective reasons."
2005.04-1140,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,692.383,697.26,Was it a big issue when the provision did not provide for counsel fees?
2005.04-1140,0,41514,samuel_h_heldman,,697.26,698.354,I'm sorry--
2005.04-1140,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,698.354,698.954,When it--
2005.04-1140,0,41514,samuel_h_heldman,,698.954,699.204,"--Your Honor, I didn't--"
2005.04-1140,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,699.204,702.408,--when the statute provided for costs--
2005.04-1140,0,41514,samuel_h_heldman,,702.408,703.269,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2005.04-1140,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,703.269,713.738,"--which, in our system, do not include counsel fees, was it a big issue when all that was included was costs?"
2005.04-1140,0,41514,samuel_h_heldman,,713.738,720.958,It was a big enough issue to be the subject of comment among many courts over the decades.
2005.04-1140,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,730.45,732.805,May I ask a question?
2005.04-1140,0,41514,samuel_h_heldman,,766.572,767.916,"I believe that's correct, Your Honor."
2005.04-1140,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,779.468,780.595,And that--
2005.04-1140,0,41514,samuel_h_heldman,,780.595,780.678,--incurred as--
2005.04-1140,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,780.678,780.795,--And that would--
2005.04-1140,0,41514,samuel_h_heldman,,780.795,780.795,--a result of the removal.
2005.04-1140,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,780.795,793.557,"--conceivably, could include all sorts of discovery and arguments on motions and so forth that might actually save time in the subsequent proceeding, if it goes back to the State Court."
2005.04-1140,0,41514,samuel_h_heldman,,793.557,812.124,"My anticipation would be that most courts would use their factfinding authority to try to figure out what work would have to be reduplicated in the State Court, to compensate that work, or the work that only arose by virtue of it being in Federal Court."
2005.04-1140,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,812.124,820.188,"So, the judge's discretion includes both whether or not to include any fees, and he also has quite a bit of discretion on what to include in the fee award, I suppose."
2005.04-1140,0,41514,samuel_h_heldman,,820.188,821.616,"I think that's right, Your Honor."
2005.04-1140,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,832.535,833.296,But--
2005.04-1140,0,41514,samuel_h_heldman,,833.296,833.396,--authority.
2005.04-1140,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,833.396,839.933,--shouldn't we know what the rule is with reference to the extensive fees Justice Stevens requires?
2005.04-1140,0,41514,samuel_h_heldman,,850.768,851.385,"Yes, Your Honor."
2005.04-1140,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,873.8,876.904,"Well, why doesn't... why doesn't that also go for counsel fees?"
2005.04-1140,0,41514,samuel_h_heldman,,883.291,887.24,"--Yes, Your Honor, that is... that is what I'm suggesting, that the same rule would apply."
2005.04-1140,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,888.667,890.761,I want to know what it is you're arguing for.
2005.04-1140,0,41514,samuel_h_heldman,,905.795,906.245,--Yes.
2005.04-1140,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,906.245,907.305,"The plaintiff, anyway."
2005.04-1140,0,41514,samuel_h_heldman,,933.475,933.742,I--
2005.04-1140,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,933.742,935.913,"I know you're not arguing for ""You always don't""."
2005.04-1140,0,41514,samuel_h_heldman,,936.413,938.684,"--I think that is a good characterization, Your Honor."
2005.04-1140,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,938.684,939.517,"All right. Then, which one do you want?"
2005.04-1140,0,41514,samuel_h_heldman,,939.517,940.861,Of those three--
2005.04-1140,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,940.861,940.977,--Yes.
2005.04-1140,0,41514,samuel_h_heldman,,940.977,944.065,"--Your Honor, we would prefer the ""almost always""."
2005.04-1140,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,944.065,944.249,All right.
2005.04-1140,0,41514,samuel_h_heldman,,977.15,983.109,"First of all, Your Honor, I would suggest that it is not we who would close the doors of Federal Court."
2005.04-1140,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,989.413,989.413,I--
2005.04-1140,0,41514,samuel_h_heldman,,989.413,989.546,--Federal Court.
2005.04-1140,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,989.546,993.878,"--unfortunately, I guess, from your position, I don't know what Congress meant here."
2005.04-1140,0,41514,samuel_h_heldman,,993.878,994.789,"No, Your Honor--"
2005.04-1140,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,994.789,997.893,"Therefore, I'm trying to figure it out in terms of the policy--"
2005.04-1140,0,41514,samuel_h_heldman,,997.893,998.343,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2005.04-1140,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,998.343,999.77,--as well as the language.
2005.04-1140,0,41514,samuel_h_heldman,,1014.971,1017.926,"--First of all, Your Honor, I apologize for not being clear enough."
2005.04-1140,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1107.21,1107.643,Why?
2005.04-1140,0,41514,samuel_h_heldman,,1134.507,1144.844,"--I don't know, Your Honor, whether the Seventh Circuit would follow up its presumption language by saying the presumption can only be overcome in extraordinary circumstances."
2005.04-1140,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1183.821,1185.415,But there's such a different in the context.
2005.04-1140,0,41514,samuel_h_heldman,,1235.727,1237.582,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
2005.04-1140,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1294.032,1299.491,"Well, but that's a general... you're... you seem to be arguing more generally for the British rule, rather than the American rule."
2005.04-1140,0,41514,samuel_h_heldman,,1313.265,1320.401,"--In that aspect of Fogerty, Your Honor, the Court had already gotten to the point of saying,"
2005.04-1140,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1382.644,1395.073,"Those were all the, you know, private attorneys general type cases, where you're... where the view is that the plaintiff is carrying out a mission of ferreting out and enforcing the law."
2005.04-1140,0,41514,samuel_h_heldman,,1397.445,1404.565,"I don't think so, Your Honor, because, first of all, it is true that usually you're awarding fees against a violator of Federal law."
2005.04-1140,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1450.346,1463.036,"Every party who prevails on a motion to admit evidence or to exclude evidence is promoting the policies and the rules of evidence, but we don't think that those motions should result in a... in fee shifting."
2005.04-1140,0,41514,samuel_h_heldman,,1463.036,1470.256,"--That is largely because, Your Honor, the Congress does not pass statutes allowing for fee shifting."
2005.04-1140,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1523.768,1525.112,"Thank you, Mr. Heldman."
2005.04-1140,0,41514,samuel_h_heldman,,1525.112,1525.395,"Thank you, Your Honor."
2005.04-1140,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1525.395,1527.883,"Mr. Chilton, we'll hear now from you."
2005.04-1140,1,29517,jan_t_chilton,,1527.883,1535.203,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
2005.04-1140,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1640.866,1650.441,You're saying that it allows Rule 11 fees to be imposed--
2005.04-1140,1,29517,jan_t_chilton,,1650.441,1651.702,"Yes, Your Honor."
2005.04-1140,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1651.702,1654.823,--which otherwise wouldn't be imposable.
2005.04-1140,1,29517,jan_t_chilton,,1691.012,1699.326,"My response would be that, as the questioning already today in the Court has revealed, there are two questions on a fee motion."
2005.04-1140,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1708.9,1716.137,But I'm... I don't... I'm not sure that I agree with you that Rule 11 applies.
2005.04-1140,1,29517,jan_t_chilton,,1728.895,1735.104,"Just costs and expenses, including attorneys fees, yes."
2005.04-1140,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1736.448,1740.163,"I think the standard is different than that, under Rule 11."
2005.04-1140,1,29517,jan_t_chilton,,1740.163,1743.101,"--Well, if the Court interprets--"
2005.04-1140,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1743.101,1744.362,"I mean, why--"
2005.04-1140,1,29517,jan_t_chilton,,1744.362,1745.106,--You--
2005.04-1140,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1745.106,1748.644,--is it in your interest to ask us to apply Rule 11?
2005.04-1140,1,29517,jan_t_chilton,,1754.432,1761.918,"--Well, we're proposing our first argument, because we think it's textually correct and historically correct."
2005.04-1140,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1793.409,1802.139,"Now, the Solicitor General, I guess, suggests that the Christiansburg Garment standard is the appropriate one."
2005.04-1140,1,29517,jan_t_chilton,,1802.139,1803.483,"That is true, he does."
2005.04-1140,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1803.483,1805.838,And do you disagree with that?
2005.04-1140,1,29517,jan_t_chilton,,1805.838,1811.048,"Well, our two standards, I believe, are relatively close."
2005.04-1140,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1859.35,1862.121,"Well, but there had been case law changes, hadn't there?"
2005.04-1140,1,29517,jan_t_chilton,,1862.121,1870.769,"--There had been, but that was not the reason for their delayed motion for remand."
2005.04-1140,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1932.345,1946.88,"I thought a comparative advantage of the Solicitor General's approach, and, by the same token, of the Petitioner's contrary approach, is that it avoids a lot of litigation over a collateral issue, like which court you ought to be in."
2005.04-1140,1,29517,jan_t_chilton,,1963.174,1969.217,"Well, first you have the jurisdictional dispute, of course, resolved."
2005.04-1140,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2017.353,2023.562,It's hard to have three different kinds of standards with attorneys fees statutes.
2005.04-1140,1,29517,jan_t_chilton,,2050.21,2051.204,Well--
2005.04-1140,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2051.204,2053.047,"--let's say they pass this... and it's ""unusual""?"
2005.04-1140,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2061.228,2061.478,I--
2005.04-1140,1,29517,jan_t_chilton,,2061.478,2061.71,--No--
2005.04-1140,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2061.71,2072.746,"--think we do have three, if you count Fogerty, because you have the Christianson, which is the most defendant friendly."
2005.04-1140,1,29517,jan_t_chilton,,2082.154,2082.603,--You're--
2005.04-1140,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2082.603,2083.498,--test.
2005.04-1140,1,29517,jan_t_chilton,,2083.498,2086.186,"--quite correct, in our view, Justice Ginsburg."
2005.04-1140,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2102.731,2109.618,"You know, it would really improve the dignity of this Court if we referred to ""Piggie Park"" as ""Newman""."
2005.04-1140,1,29517,jan_t_chilton,,2111.712,2124.818,"--I have no response to that remark, Your Honor."
2005.04-1140,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2202.772,2218.323,"I suppose that one could assume that to be the congressional intent, if Congress often has such an intent for such substantial imposition of financial liability."
2005.04-1140,1,29517,jan_t_chilton,,2237.883,2239.395,"--Yes, Your Honor, I do--"
2005.04-1140,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2239.395,2239.862,What are--
2005.04-1140,1,29517,jan_t_chilton,,2239.862,2240.028,--as a matter of fact.
2005.04-1140,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2240.028,2250.614,--what are some other examples where Congress has allowed this degree of financial liability to be subjected to the discretion of a District judge?
2005.04-1140,1,29517,jan_t_chilton,,2250.614,2269.681,"The Freedom of Information Act, Your Honor, which was passed in 1974, which, interestingly, I think, undermines the Petitioner's argument that, in using the word ""may"", Congress somehow incorporated the ""Newman"" standard."
2005.04-1140,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2347.885,2349.062,And this is liability for what?
2005.04-1140,1,29517,jan_t_chilton,,2350.739,2352.084,"Denying benefits, for example."
2005.04-1140,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2352.084,2354.856,Why isn't Fogerty an example.
2005.04-1140,1,29517,jan_t_chilton,,2368.379,2372.161,"Well, Your Honor, I believe it's not pure discretion."
2005.04-1140,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2408.117,2414.259,"Well, as it was just mentioned, ""multifactor"", in a footnote, it said it would be neutral."
2005.04-1140,1,29517,jan_t_chilton,,2422.058,2429.705,"That much is true, but the footnote does say that, in applying the neutral standard, the District Courts are free to follow--"
2005.04-1140,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2429.705,2439.03,"You've given us, in your multifactor test, you said, ""objectively reasonable basis to remove""."
2005.04-1140,1,29517,jan_t_chilton,,2458.43,2467.338,"--Well, we outlined several in our brief, Your Honor, at page... let me see... page 41."
2005.04-1140,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2516.157,2520.522,What is your position on what fees we're talking about.
2005.04-1140,1,29517,jan_t_chilton,,2530.097,2532.785,"I absolutely do not agree, Your Honor."
2005.04-1140,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2558.322,2559.666,Have the lower courts addressed that issue?
2005.04-1140,1,29517,jan_t_chilton,,2559.666,2561.26,"--Not to my knowledge, Your Honor."
2005.04-1140,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2561.26,2572.69,"Are there... are there instances, under your view of the statute, in... under the standard you propose, where costs would be awarded, but not fees?"
2005.04-1140,1,29517,jan_t_chilton,,2572.69,2587.724,"Well, if you view 1447(c) as an... a power enabling bill, not a fee shifting statute, the answer is yes."
2005.04-1140,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2608.052,2608.052,"And, once--"
2005.04-1140,1,29517,jan_t_chilton,,2608.052,2608.979,--combination.
2005.04-1140,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2608.979,2614.355,"--again, can you advise us of their practice or lower court opinions addressing that issue?"
2005.04-1140,1,29517,jan_t_chilton,,2614.355,2626.701,"I cannot, but there certainly are lower court decisions that allow fees on remand in very small amounts that could not possibly have been sufficient to compensate for the work done."
2005.04-1140,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2626.701,2630.65,Because we think of costs as really a matter of course.
2005.04-1140,1,29517,jan_t_chilton,,2638.548,2641.319,"Well, as the statute is written, that's true."
2005.04-1140,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2641.319,2645.351,May I return to Fogerty for a minute?
2005.04-1140,1,29517,jan_t_chilton,,2670.888,2672.482,"Well, that may be, Your Honor."
2005.04-1140,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2675.337,2675.637,But you're--
2005.04-1140,1,29517,jan_t_chilton,,2675.637,2676.347,--incorrectly--
2005.04-1140,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2676.347,2676.747,--but you're--
2005.04-1140,1,29517,jan_t_chilton,,2676.747,2677.014,--as steer--
2005.04-1140,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2677.014,2679.619,"--the part of the decision on which you rely is the footnote at the end of the opinion, is that right?"
2005.04-1140,1,29517,jan_t_chilton,,2679.619,2680.296,--Yes.
2005.04-1140,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2680.296,2680.529,Yes.
2005.04-1140,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2680.529,2691.631,"--If the... the broader discretion we give to the District Court, the less litigation there is likely to be on this subject."
2005.04-1140,1,29517,jan_t_chilton,,2691.631,2694.236,That is certainly true.
2005.04-1140,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2947.333,2949.605,"Well, it's not those very cases."
2005.04-1140,1,29517,jan_t_chilton,,2953.043,2954.22,--The--
2005.04-1140,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2954.22,2957.919,"So, it's not the cases that Congress wanted to be removed that we're talking about."
2005.04-1140,1,29517,jan_t_chilton,,2957.919,2983.622,"--But, as this Court explained in Piggie... no, excuse me, Christiansburg Garment, Your Honor... the imposition of fees discourages activity when it's a Federal right that's being enforced, saying that fees are imposed whenever there's a near miss, a reasonable case that's brought to enforce the Federal right."
2005.04-1140,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3100.22,3101.647,I wonder if that's a correct statement.
2005.04-1140,1,29517,jan_t_chilton,,3109.896,3112.234,"--Yes, but those can be removed, Your Honor."
2005.04-1140,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3112.234,3117.71,"Oh, I thought you said the State Court would never be enforcing a Federal... I may--"
2005.04-1140,1,29517,jan_t_chilton,,3117.71,3117.926,Well--
2005.04-1140,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3117.926,3118.509,--I may have misunderstood your point--
2005.04-1140,1,29517,jan_t_chilton,,3118.509,3118.676,--I--
2005.04-1140,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3118.676,3118.926,--I'm sorry.
2005.04-1140,1,29517,jan_t_chilton,,3118.926,3121.364,"--I, perhaps, was overgeneralizing."
2005.04-1140,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3134.393,3139.753,"In other words, it was an improperly removed case."
2005.04-1140,1,29517,jan_t_chilton,,3139.753,3141.43,That's right.
2005.04-1140,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3146.973,3148.65,"Thank you, Counsel."
2005.04-1140,2,41514,samuel_h_heldman,,3152.365,3176.042,"First, regarding the continued insinuation of some manipulative intent by the timing of the... of the removal, there was, in this case, no finding by the District Court, no suggestion by the District Court, that there was any such intent, or that that was a reason to deny fees, no suggestion by either of the lower courts to that effect."
2005.04-1140,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3288.947,3289.841,Why--
2005.04-1140,2,41514,samuel_h_heldman,,3289.841,3289.841,--of the law.
2005.04-1140,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3289.841,3294.306,"--not, then, just say ""objectively reasonable basis to remove""?"
2005.04-1140,2,41514,samuel_h_heldman,,3296.066,3307.996,"That standard is appropriate, as in Christiansburg, Your Honor, where the party who is potentially subject to the award is the favorite of the law in question."
2005.04-1140,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3387.561,3396.619,"If the law was so anti removal, then one would expect there would be some kind of threshold check once you get to District Court."
2005.04-1140,2,41514,samuel_h_heldman,,3411.16,3412.171,My experience--
2005.04-1140,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3412.171,3413.182,--by rapid transit.
2005.04-1140,2,41514,samuel_h_heldman,,3413.182,3413.848,"--I'm sorry, Your Honor."
2005.04-1140,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3440.313,3440.996,"Thank you, Counsel."
2005.04-1140,2,41514,samuel_h_heldman,,3440.996,3440.996,"Thank you, Your Honor."
2005.04-1140,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3440.996,3444.996,The case is submitted.
