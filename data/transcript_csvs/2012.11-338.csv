2012.11-338,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,12.741,"We will hear argument next in Case 11-338, Decker v. Northwest Environmental Defense Center and Georgia-Pacific v. The Northwest Environmental Defense Center."
2012.11-338,0,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,13.191,16.809,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2012.11-338,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,25.081,28.283,"Well, before -- before we get into that, congratulations to your clients--"
2012.11-338,0,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,28.283,28.783,Thank you.
2012.11-338,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,28.783,33.152,--getting almost all the relief they're looking for under the new rule issued on Friday.
2012.11-338,0,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,33.152,34.104,Thank you.
2012.11-338,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,34.104,35.72,And thank you for calling it to our attention.
2012.11-338,0,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,35.72,36.354,Thank you.
2012.11-338,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,84.001,86.37,But there was no ruling in the court of appeals.
2012.11-338,0,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,95.845,96.761,--No.
2012.11-338,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,97.145,97.478,So is--
2012.11-338,0,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,97.478,100.38,That is an argument that Respondents have made in this Court.
2012.11-338,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,100.38,104.515,--And so that's not a point that this Court could resolve in the first instance.
2012.11-338,0,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,104.515,108.152,"Well, I don't think that's -- I don't think that's right."
2012.11-338,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,119.424,128.816,"Yes, you can do that; but, this Court is a court of review, not first view, and we don't take questions that haven't been aired below."
2012.11-338,0,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,128.816,135.653,"Well, there is an additional reason why we don't think that the rule here moots -- moots the issue."
2012.11-338,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,170.659,180.915,"Well, but it's -- it's an unusual situation for us to rule in a case where the issue has ongoing significance and that's taken away."
2012.11-338,0,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,192.639,196.876,"--Well, let me argue -- let me -- maybe--"
2012.11-338,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,196.876,212.136,"I thought the case law was fairly clear that when the EPA changes its rules in your favor, that they can't -- the court can't impose penalties for a past violation."
2012.11-338,0,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,212.136,214.22,"--Well, I wish it were so clear."
2012.11-338,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,242.822,252.695,"Is this a -- is this a new rule that they -- I too haven't had much of a chance to look at it, but is this a new rule, or is it an amendment of the existing rule?"
2012.11-338,0,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,252.695,254.48,It's an amendment of the existing rule.
2012.11-338,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,274.293,275.476,Are you sure you want what you're asking for?
2012.11-338,0,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,278.095,281.364,"Well, we are -- we are hoping that you rule -- you'll rule with us."
2012.11-338,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,283.616,285.132,That's usually the objective.
2012.11-338,0,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,285.132,305.83,"On the basis of this rule, you have to understand that the challenge to this rule is the claim that the -- the words “ associated with industrial activity ” must be interpreted by EPA to include harvesting activities and the -- the moving of the logs out of the harvest area."
2012.11-338,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,305.83,315.287,"Now, I suppose that your clients and others similarly situated, or I -- I guess it would be the Respondents, can challenge the new rule, right?"
2012.11-338,0,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,315.287,315.753,Yes.
2012.11-338,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,315.753,324.643,So you would have simultaneously pending a case involving the interpretation of the old rule and a challenge to the new rule.
2012.11-338,0,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,324.643,325.109,Right.
2012.11-338,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,325.109,326.928,Each of which would have the same issue.
2012.11-338,0,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,326.928,334.682,"And this Court can cut through all of that by deciding this case, which the simplest way to decide this case is under the stormwater rule."
2012.11-338,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,391.315,404.909,"But, Mr. Bishop, as -- as Justice Ginsburg said, that question was not decided below, and in the context of this case, which, of course, was very different when it was briefed, Mr. Fisher spent a grand total of 2 pages, and rightly so."
2012.11-338,0,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,419.251,420.701,"Well, I think there is briefing on it."
2012.11-338,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,430.274,430.607,"Well, that isn't really quite fair."
2012.11-338,0,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,439.73,441.265,"--Now, the issue is before this Court."
2012.11-338,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,456.258,460.059,You wouldn't have to do anything if the Court vacated the decision below.
2012.11-338,0,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,462.095,465.713,"Well, obviously, if the Court held the case was moot, then we'd like the -- the vacatur."
2012.11-338,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,466.982,467.732,Would you be--
2012.11-338,0,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,467.732,468.815,--But if there's going to be a challenge to the new rule--
2012.11-338,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,468.815,469.517,--Would you be entitled to it?
2012.11-338,0,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,469.517,471.967,"--Yes, we believe we are entitled to vacatur."
2012.11-338,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,471.967,476.855,"So -- so if you're right that you're entitled to it and we agree with you, then there is nothing."
2012.11-338,0,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,480.64,481.492,"Well, what's left of--"
2012.11-338,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,481.492,482.192,--of the prior decision.
2012.11-338,0,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,482.192,494.967,"--what's left at that point is another 5 or 6 years of litigation under the new rule on an issue that is briefed in this Court, before this Court, and I think relatively easy to decide under the stormwater rule."
2012.11-338,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,494.967,495.65,Which issue are you talking about?
2012.11-338,0,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,497.768,498.368,The industrial activities issue.
2012.11-338,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,553.538,562.127,"How do we -- how do we avoid, under your reading -- assuming we agreed with you with what the rule says, that there is a difference between logging roads and access roads."
2012.11-338,0,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,569.717,571.117,--The public--
2012.11-338,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,571.117,573.002,--Do we have to reach that issue then?
2012.11-338,0,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,573.002,573.685,--The public -- no.
2012.11-338,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,632.957,633.523,So how do we--
2012.11-338,0,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,633.523,636.242,--absolutely clear that timber harvesting is not industrial activity--
2012.11-338,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,636.242,636.942,--It may not--
2012.11-338,0,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,636.942,637.944,"--and, therefore, it does not get to the “ associated ”."
2012.11-338,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,637.944,649.919,"--It may not be, but these are pipes, ditches, and channels which the CWA explicitly defines as point sources--"
2012.11-338,0,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,649.919,650.469,"Well, you can--"
2012.11-338,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,650.469,652.119,--that are not part of the harvesting.
2012.11-338,0,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,659.275,661.976,"--Well, remember that the stormwater rule applies to point sources."
2012.11-338,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,734.589,744.296,Am I correct or incorrect that a considerable number of these roads are -- a significant number of these roads were built initially by the logging industry?
2012.11-338,0,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,744.296,748.182,"--Yes, some -- some of them surely -- surely were."
2012.11-338,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,748.182,758.121,"And it's a little hard for you to say that when these were built by the logging industry and presumably maintained to some respect by the logging industry, to say, oh, well, these are used by hunters and so forth."
2012.11-338,0,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,758.504,759.504,But -- but they are public roads.
2012.11-338,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,860.053,867.273,"Mr. Bishop, could I -- I'm sorry that I don't understand this well enough yet, but can I understand what's still at stake for you in -- in the case?"
2012.11-338,0,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,881.449,889.572,"Well, if there is -- if there is a vacatur, so that we don't have to worry about remedies below--"
2012.11-338,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,889.572,891.222,Which remedies are you worried about?
2012.11-338,0,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,891.222,896.059,"--Well, the remedies -- we are obviously not worried about injunctive relief."
2012.11-338,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,936.786,937.52,"Thank you, counsel."
2012.11-338,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,961.835,964.103,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2012.11-338,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,987.485,991.087,Were you as surprised as we were to learn about that final rule?
2012.11-338,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,991.087,991.956,"No, we were not."
2012.11-338,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,991.956,995.674,When did you learn that the final rule would be issued on Friday?
2012.11-338,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,995.674,999.11,I learned on Friday morning that the final rule would be issued.
2012.11-338,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1007.632,1010.418,You had no idea before Friday that this was coming out?
2012.11-338,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1010.418,1015.738,--I knew that it was a strong possibility -- I knew that it was a strong possibility that it would come out.
2012.11-338,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1031.681,1032.481,In early November?
2012.11-338,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1032.481,1033.616,In early November.
2012.11-338,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1033.616,1038.501,Maybe in the future you could let us know when something as definite as that comes.
2012.11-338,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1049.726,1050.576,"I'm sorry, Your Honor."
2012.11-338,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1055.713,1056.982,"Oh, I know, that there was a proposed rule."
2012.11-338,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1062.885,1070.722,"--No, I think that -- well, I think this happened more quickly than it usually does, but I think we intended respect for the Court's processes rather than disrespect."
2012.11-338,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1084.982,1085.866,"Well, maybe."
2012.11-338,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1088.418,1102.011,"With respect to the impact of the rule on this case, the new rule was not intended to change the meaning of the preexisting definition, and in our view it renders the case moot."
2012.11-338,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1104.129,1111.699,How do you deal with his points about the ex-fact remedies of attorney's fees and remediation.
2012.11-338,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1114.251,1129.411,"--Well, I think the question of attorney's fees, if the Ninth Circuit's decision was vacated on the ground that the case would become moot, attorney fee's are available under the Clean Water Act and citizen suits only to prevailing or substantially prevailing parties."
2012.11-338,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1182.38,1193.02,"Do you -- are you saying that the private companies would not be liable for civil penalties, even though the alleged violation was ongoing at the time of the district court litigation?"
2012.11-338,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1193.02,1193.553,That's correct.
2012.11-338,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1208.963,1210.246,"Well, can I stop you just for a moment?"
2012.11-338,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1229.126,1229.609,--That's correct.
2012.11-338,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1263.698,1268.334,That would have to be based on the assumption that the Ninth Circuit decision was wrong.
2012.11-338,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1268.334,1300.973,"--It would not have to be based on the assumption that the Ninth Circuit decision was wrong at the time that it was entered; that is, even if EPA had done something that was explicitly characterized as a change in the law, if EPA had issued a rule-making that said, what Petitioners had been doing was unlawful up to this point, but we've decided that it shouldn't be unlawful, and, therefore, we're amending the rule to make it legal, if EPA had done that there would still be no prospect of future illegality, assuming that the rule is taken to be valid."
2012.11-338,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1315.648,1317.598,What if -- what if the rule is held invalid?
2012.11-338,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1335.127,1350.921,"It certainly is possible that the rule will be challenged, but, as Petitioners have emphasized in their brief, and we agree, the proper forum for adjudicating challenges to the validity of an EPA regulation is through a suit brought against EPA based on the administrative record."
2012.11-338,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1353.69,1362.213,"I understand that, but my point is until that suit is concluded, you don't know whether there is a possibility of future violation or not, do you?"
2012.11-338,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1362.213,1363.196,--You don't know.
2012.11-338,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1381.658,1385.21,Is what you said true also of the remediation piece of this?
2012.11-338,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1395.017,1397.386,--I think we would want to study that a little further.
2012.11-338,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1427.072,1435.927,Is it your submission that we should issue an order vacating this moot or issue an order for the Court of Appeals to consider whether it's moot?
2012.11-338,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1435.927,1437.361,--I think either one would be--
2012.11-338,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1437.361,1438.561,What is your submission?
2012.11-338,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1438.561,1447.283,"--Our preference would be that the Court issue an order vacating as moot; but, it would also be an appropriate decision to leave that to the Court of Appeals in the first instance."
2012.11-338,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1472.1,1485.008,"I -- I'm having trouble seeing how we can dismiss it as moot when there would remain pending claims for civil penalties and injunctive relief, which you've already said you want to take a closer look at, and attorney's fees."
2012.11-338,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1490.912,1504.906,"--Well, I think the one piece that we would want to take a closer look at is the specific question of remediation for past harm, that is, concrete steps on the ground to undo the results of past discharges."
2012.11-338,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1506.172,1517.313,"It seems strange that you would -- there would be an order of remediation to undo the results of past discharges when at this point the law going forward is, go ahead and discharge."
2012.11-338,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1517.313,1535.175,"--I think that's correct, that, as I say, we haven't -- we haven't specifically focused on this question; but, my instinct is that an order of remediation would be an aspect of prospective injunctive relief that would be governed by the general rule that injunctive relief is to be determined under the law at the time of the Court's decisions."
2012.11-338,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1564.694,1570.281,"Is this something that, in terms of mootness, we should evaluate under the voluntary cessation doctrine?"
2012.11-338,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1570.281,1571.231,"No, I don't believe so."
2012.11-338,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1581.156,1582.972,EPA has changed its ways.
2012.11-338,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1582.972,1590.445,"--Well, EPA is -- EPA is not the defendant in the case; so, even if this were viewed as a change in ways, it wouldn't be voluntary cessation."
2012.11-338,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1590.445,1591.145,"Thank you, counsel."
2012.11-338,2,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1599.367,1601.735,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2012.11-338,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1654.918,1669.795,"So if we do that, if we dismiss as improvidently granted, you still go back and you -- you get your attorney's fees, you get the civil penalties, you get remediation because the law governing your case would be the existing Ninth Circuit opinion."
2012.11-338,2,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1669.795,1675.265,"--Well, if that's where the case ends up when it's over and they bring it back and you deny cert.--"
2012.11-338,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1675.265,1675.965,"Well, the case is not--"
2012.11-338,2,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1675.965,1676.699,--But there's a much--
2012.11-338,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1676.699,1679.05,--I was just going to say the case is not going to be over if we dismiss.
2012.11-338,2,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1679.05,1679.633,--No.
2012.11-338,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1679.633,1681.018,"Because, as you just said, it's interlocutory."
2012.11-338,2,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1681.018,1682.152,"But that's my point, yes."
2012.11-338,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1685.304,1696.862,"But, in other words, it goes -- under your view, it would go back to the district court; the district court would try all this; and, as the Chief Justice says, we know what the law of the case is, if -- if the opinion stands."
2012.11-338,2,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1696.862,1698.88,"Well, the law of the case would be--"
2012.11-338,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1698.88,1705.451,"And -- and so isn't -- isn't it fairly clear, well, we know that the district court must do under the court of appeals' decision?"
2012.11-338,2,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1705.451,1717.026,"--All the district court must do under the Ninth Circuit decision is consider this to be a point source, for the reason that Justice Sotomayor mentioned, and that -- the other side has virtually walked away from that argument, anyway."
2012.11-338,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1763.989,1764.789,Is this a--
2012.11-338,2,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1764.789,1766.274,--all discharges associated with industrial activity.
2012.11-338,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1766.274,1776.964,--So you're disclaiming that you have to go to the court of appeals; you think you can bring a citizen suit to challenge the validity of the regulation?
2012.11-338,2,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1776.964,1779.682,"Well, I wouldn't put it exactly that way, Justice Sotomayor."
2012.11-338,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1803.881,1804.816,But we didn't--
2012.11-338,2,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1804.816,1805.183,"It is, A--"
2012.11-338,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1805.183,1811.237,"--But that -- that is the question, the question of what the statute requires, was not decided below."
2012.11-338,2,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1811.237,1813.939,"--That's correct, Justice Ginsburg."
2012.11-338,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1821.326,1822.778,And you're not urging that we reach it.
2012.11-338,2,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1822.778,1831.051,"--I think the most prudent thing, as I've said, is for this Court not to reach that, and to let -- as you described, to let a lower court look at it first, and to bring it back."
2012.11-338,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1879.579,1881.031,"Mr. Fisher, why would you proceed that way?"
2012.11-338,2,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1894.604,1899.206,"Well, I think that what we'll do is proceed whatever way we can."
2012.11-338,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1922.071,1926.559,"Do you think that, on your view of 1369, you can't go to the Ninth Circuit?"
2012.11-338,2,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1926.559,1926.909,Exactly.
2012.11-338,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1991.417,1992.784,"Active, what does that mean?"
2012.11-338,2,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1992.784,1993.784,It means under--
2012.11-338,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1993.784,1996.669,"They -- they cut maybe, what, every -- every 10 years?"
2012.11-338,2,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1998.155,1998.805,--Well -- well--
2012.11-338,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1998.805,2000.957,What about the 9 years in between?
2012.11-338,2,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2002.79,2003.875,"--No, Justice Scalia."
2012.11-338,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2099.237,2099.604,Excuse me.
2012.11-338,2,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2102.239,2108.893,"--It's page 18, the last page of -- at least, I'm -- I hope your copy is the same as mine, but on the PDF that -- that was sent up to the Court."
2012.11-338,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2108.893,2111.712,And -- and so I'm reading under where it says “ stormwater discharges ”?
2012.11-338,2,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2111.712,2112.113,Yes.
2012.11-338,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2117.665,2117.934,Thank you.
2012.11-338,2,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2117.934,2119.417,And they list those four things.
2012.11-338,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2234.476,2235.776,I thought -- I thought -- I'm sorry.
2012.11-338,2,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2237.761,2240.379,"--Well, that's what they are standing here today saying."
2012.11-338,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2270.399,2278.338,"Well, if we -- if we dismiss as improvidently granted, are you suggesting that the Ninth Circuit would then be the -- be a court to consider this?"
2012.11-338,2,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2278.338,2279.588,Yes.
2012.11-338,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2279.588,2288.61,"I'm -- I'm just thinking if we vacate, perhaps another court will consider it, but if we dismiss as improvidently granted the Ninth Circuit will, quite reasonably, think they are done."
2012.11-338,2,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2288.61,2292.264,"No, because we have a forward look at the -- the first thing we'll tell the Ninth Circuit is--"
2012.11-338,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2292.264,2297.816,"Well, I mean, they're done -- they are done in terms of their interpretation of the regulation and the applicable law."
2012.11-338,2,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2297.816,2304.489,"--I think only as to the backward-looking regulation, but now we have -- our complaint, you know, as a citizen suit does--"
2012.11-338,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2304.489,2315.195,But then -- but then why -- why isn't your -- aren't your concerns met if we vacate for the court of appeals to consider in the first instance the extent to which this regulation may bear on its opinion?
2012.11-338,2,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2315.195,2318.998,"--Well, I -- I think that gets you very close to the same place, Justice Kennedy."
2012.11-338,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2329.321,2334.508,"Well, I think the point -- the Ninth Circuit had the, of course, EPA's views before it."
2012.11-338,2,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2341.929,2344.447,Do you mean the backward-looking ruling?
2012.11-338,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2344.447,2347.733,I mean the ruling in the decision that they--
2012.11-338,2,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2347.733,2348.351,Right.
2012.11-338,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2348.351,2349.951,--issued that's before us today.
2012.11-338,2,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2349.951,2352.387,"Well, I don't know that they would reconsider that--"
2012.11-338,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2352.387,2352.87,No.
2012.11-338,2,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2352.87,2363.944,"--but the -- but the main event going forward is the new rule, because the citizen suit seeks cessation of ongoing violations of the Act, and that remains the core of our lawsuit which is still seeking damages--"
2012.11-338,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2363.944,2375.668,"But that's the whole point, which is if you go back what's the value of the backward-looking construction if what you're seeking is injunctive relief that has to be based on the new rule."
2012.11-338,2,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2375.668,2378.204,"--It doesn't matter very much, Justice Sotomayor."
2012.11-338,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2696.762,2701.797,I'm looking at page 7 and it doesn't say the authority to designate additional roads.
2012.11-338,2,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2704.832,2705.182,Right.
2012.11-338,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2705.182,2709.32,That could be stormwater discharges that have nothing to do with logging.
2012.11-338,2,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2709.32,2715.724,"I think if that's all we had, Justice Scalia, it might be a little bit ambiguous, although of course this is in the context of logging the roads."
2012.11-338,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2761.704,2767.524,"But if you were challenging the new rule, you would have EPA as your adversary."
2012.11-338,2,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2778.38,2785.57,"Well, EPA of course is an amicus, Justice Ginsburg, and EPA has an ongoing right to intervene in any citizen suit."
2012.11-338,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2798.894,2804.781,Does that include a right to intervene and dismiss the action?
2012.11-338,2,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2804.781,2816.172,"Well, I think that EPA has a right to intervene and make an argument that the case is moot or any other substantive argument they would like to make back in the Ninth Circuit."
2012.11-338,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2830.599,2832.215,"Yes, they are just intervening."
2012.11-338,2,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2841.157,2841.79,Right.
2012.11-338,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2841.79,2842.773,They don't take it over.
2012.11-338,2,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2843.59,2845.024,I think that's what would happen.
2012.11-338,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2860.534,2861.701,"Thank you, counsel."
2012.11-338,3,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,2864.938,2868.807,Thank you.
2012.11-338,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2953.311,2954.477,"Thank you, counsel."
