1977.77-5549,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,79.352,We will hear arguments next in Taylor against Kentucky.
1977.77-5549,0,28760,j_vincent_aprile_ii,,82.621,83.907,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1977.77-5549,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,204.891,210.956,Would your constitutional issues be different if there had been ten witnesses on each side?
1977.77-5549,0,28760,j_vincent_aprile_ii,,210.956,211.414,No Your Honor.
1977.77-5549,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,332.699,334.622,Did the indictment go the jury room?
1977.77-5549,0,28760,j_vincent_aprile_ii,,334.622,342.41,"No Your Honor, the indictment did not go to the jury room, but it was read in toto to them by the prosecutor at the inception of the trial."
1977.77-5549,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,350.224,360.0,"In this jurisdiction, is any criminal case ever tried without the essence if not the exact contents of the indictment communicated to the jury?"
1977.77-5549,0,28760,j_vincent_aprile_ii,,360.0,361.582,"Yes, Your Honor."
1977.77-5549,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,361.582,364.598,How does the jury find out what the charge is?
1977.77-5549,0,28760,j_vincent_aprile_ii,,364.598,372.393,"It is unique I suspect with regard to other jurisdictions, but I have reviewed many transcript of records in which indictment is never given to the jury nor read."
1977.77-5549,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,372.393,376.794,"I do not mean given, but someone tell us the jury what the crime --"
1977.77-5549,0,28760,j_vincent_aprile_ii,,376.794,391.771,"Normally, the prosecutor gives a synopsis of the charge in his opening statement and I want to make it clear Your Honor that it is not an attack made on the procedure of the telling the jurors about the content of the indictment or reading it to them or even giving it to them."
1977.77-5549,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,426.003,440.415,"Would you think that that would be more important, more critical in the situation where as in some jurisdictions the indictment goes to the jury room with the jurors along with other pieces of paper that are evidence?"
1977.77-5549,0,28760,j_vincent_aprile_ii,,440.415,444.811,"Your Honor, it might be in certain cases, but I will say in this case there was not one exhibit introduced."
1977.77-5549,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,681.152,688.138,Are you challenging the instruction given by the Trial Court on the question of reasonable doubt?
1977.77-5549,0,28760,j_vincent_aprile_ii,,688.138,722.846,"Your Honor, number one, in all candors I tried to point out in my brief that number one, it was not challenged by the defense attorney in trial, but under the teaching of this Court in Boyd v. United States and as you applied them in Cupp v. Naugten and Kibbe vs. Henderson, this Court said that you must evaluate all of the instructions and I submit that this particular instruction while it may not be constitutionally bankrupt on the issue of reasonable doubt, it is deficient because it did not allot the jury to utilize the fact that reasonable doubt could be generated for the want of or lack of evidence."
1977.77-5549,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,722.846,732.56,"If it is not bankrupt as you say and not constitutionally deficient, what business does this Court have addressing itself to it?"
1977.77-5549,0,28760,j_vincent_aprile_ii,,732.56,740.556,"Your Honor, as I understand it, this Court does not wish to evaluate instructions and it is some sort of isolation."
1977.77-5549,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,759.495,766.098,"Well, the Kentucky Appellate Court and your petition for certiorari do not raise that as a separate point, does it?"
1977.77-5549,0,28760,j_vincent_aprile_ii,,766.098,779.538,"No Your Honor and I am not trying to litigate it separately, but I do not believe that we can take the Kentucky Courtâ€™s position which is if you have give an instruction on the reasonable doubt standards, you do not have to give an instruction on the presumption of innocence."
1977.77-5549,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,836.208,838.858,There are thousands of cases like that.
1977.77-5549,0,28760,j_vincent_aprile_ii,,840.98,842.549,"Your Honor, I only want you to accept those cases --"
1977.77-5549,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,842.549,847.87,"You are the one to set a special rule where there is only one witness on the side, do you?"
1977.77-5549,0,28760,j_vincent_aprile_ii,,847.87,848.602,"No, your Honor, I certainly do not."
1977.77-5549,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,848.602,850.486,Then why do you keep pushing that point?
1977.77-5549,0,28760,j_vincent_aprile_ii,,850.486,855.148,"Because Your Honor, I think it clearly demonstrates the problem that we had in this case."
1977.77-5549,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,892.206,903.041,"That was not in constitutional terms, Mr. Aprile and that leads me to ask you a question that has troubled me from the time I read the briefs in this case."
1977.77-5549,0,28760,j_vincent_aprile_ii,,986.502,993.408,"Your Honor if I may just speak to that, I was not the trial attorney, but I certainly was the appellate attorney and I wrote the brief in the Kentucky Court of Appeals."
1977.77-5549,1,26099,guy_c_shearer,,1822.091,1829.851,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1977.77-5549,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1959.695,1964.71,"Now, jury has settled all these issues so the only issue before the court is the --"
1977.77-5549,1,26099,guy_c_shearer,,1964.71,1970.679,The balancing contest was the only reason from my being that up Your Honor.
1977.77-5549,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2036.167,2038.399,General Shearer may I interrupt you with one question please.
1977.77-5549,1,26099,guy_c_shearer,,2038.399,2039.697,Yes sir.
1977.77-5549,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2039.697,2047.644,Do you dispute the fact that the defendant comes in the court with a clean slate as far as the jury is concerned?
1977.77-5549,1,26099,guy_c_shearer,,2049.955,2051.639,I do not understand.
1977.77-5549,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2051.639,2055.911,You argued that the instruction that the defendant tendered was not correct as I understood?
1977.77-5549,1,26099,guy_c_shearer,,2055.911,2060.907,"Yes sir, it was not correct as to form and it would have been in there form to have accepted it."
1977.77-5549,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2060.907,2061.606,And why is that?
1977.77-5549,1,26099,guy_c_shearer,,2065.589,2069.84,"You have to ask this counsel, Mr. Justice."
1977.77-5549,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2086.038,2092.9,But is it not true that for purposes of the matter on trial he was presumed to be innocent and presumed to come in with a clean slate.
1977.77-5549,1,26099,guy_c_shearer,,2092.9,2098.412,"Yes, I agree with you 100%."
1977.77-5549,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2106.156,2111.048,As far as his charge was concerned did he not have a clean slate?
1977.77-5549,1,26099,guy_c_shearer,,2111.048,2114.422,"No, Yes, but here is the point."
1977.77-5549,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2139.791,2142.413,"As long as we have had common law courts, we have had the presumption of innocence -"
1977.77-5549,1,26099,guy_c_shearer,,2142.413,2144.09,That is correct sir.
1977.77-5549,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2172.929,2185.823,Mr. Attorney General is it the practice in Kentucky if a man has the kind of clean slate where he has never been on probation or parole or anything at all then does he get the instruction?
1977.77-5549,1,26099,guy_c_shearer,,2188.251,2192.041,"No, he was not entitled to it at all with that word clean slate in there."
1977.77-5549,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2192.041,2193.478,Even if he had it completely clean slate?
1977.77-5549,1,26099,guy_c_shearer,,2193.478,2199.73,It said that presumption of innocence is proved until he is proved to be guilty.
1977.77-5549,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2202.203,2206.487,"Yes, and that is not what the Court of Appeals of said."
1977.77-5549,1,26099,guy_c_shearer,,2216.674,2219.536,That is absolutely the law of Kentucky.
1977.77-5549,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2219.536,2234.581,Up till now?
1977.77-5549,1,26099,guy_c_shearer,,2234.581,2251.112,In the case of Coffin the court did hold that the presumption of innocence was evidence.
1977.77-5549,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2399.137,2409.358,"According to your brother these were not brought up for the first time here, but were brought up in the Court of Appeals of Kentucky in its brief, its constitutional arguments."
1977.77-5549,1,26099,guy_c_shearer,,2415.082,2417.162,"No, they did not."
1977.77-5549,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2421.917,2425.427,"No, that they argued that Kentucky Law was unconstitutional under the federal constitution?"
1977.77-5549,1,26099,guy_c_shearer,,2425.427,2429.1,"No, no sir."
1977.77-5549,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2429.1,2430.606,You said they did not argue that in the Court of Appeals?
1977.77-5549,1,26099,guy_c_shearer,,2430.606,2439.195,They did not.
1977.77-5549,2,28760,j_vincent_aprile_ii,,3133.508,3138.429,I would just like to of course take issue with the point that was made by the representative of the Commonwealth.
