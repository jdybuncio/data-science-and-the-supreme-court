1988.87-5259,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.57,"We'll hear evidence next in Number 87-5259, Frank Dean Teague against Michael Lane."
1988.87-5259,0,38401,patricia_unsinn,,62.888,77.88,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the petitioner in this case was tried before a jury from which all black representation was removed by use of the peremptory challenge."
1988.87-5259,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,134.801,155.047,"Ms. Unsinn, may I interrupt you there to inquire whether... if this Court were to adopt the other part of Justice Harlan's view of retroactivity on collateral review, whether we would be able to reach your Sixth Amendment argument at all?"
1988.87-5259,0,38401,patricia_unsinn,,155.047,160.284,"Yes, Judge, I believe you would because--"
1988.87-5259,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,160.284,161.168,Why?
1988.87-5259,0,38401,patricia_unsinn,,165.438,166.305,"--Yes, Judge, but--"
1988.87-5259,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,166.305,172.592,"And under Justice Harlan's view, any new right recognized wouldn't be retroactive."
1988.87-5259,0,38401,patricia_unsinn,,180.365,189.653,"--No, Justice O'Connor, we don't believe that we're proposing any new rule in our Sixth Amendment argument."
1988.87-5259,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,197.291,207.765,"Well, suppose we continue to follow our holding in Allen against Hardy, rather than your view of when that rule was adopted."
1988.87-5259,0,38401,patricia_unsinn,,207.765,212.753,"Judge, my answer remains the same."
1988.87-5259,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,274.124,277.093,"It was accepted in Lockhart v. McCree, wasn't it?"
1988.87-5259,0,38401,patricia_unsinn,,277.093,279.461,--The fair cross section requirement?
1988.87-5259,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,279.461,281.877,Extended to a petit jury?
1988.87-5259,0,38401,patricia_unsinn,,281.877,287.448,"Well, Judge, as I said, there was language in the opinion suggesting that this was correct."
1988.87-5259,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,287.448,294.721,"Well, you think that that does not mean that that was accepted, if it was simply language in the opinion, as you refer to it?"
1988.87-5259,0,38401,patricia_unsinn,,294.721,297.173,"Well, Judge, it was certainly a conclusion--"
1988.87-5259,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,297.173,299.156,"Yes, I'm the Chief Justice, I'm not a judge."
1988.87-5259,0,38401,patricia_unsinn,,299.156,301.89,"--Pardon me, Justice Rehnquist."
1988.87-5259,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,496.202,539.029,"Do you think that forcing parties to a lawsuit to accept jurors of a certain racial composition... Italian background, or Hispanic in certain parts of the country, or whatever it might be... on the basis of their race or their religion at the petit jury level might work at cross purposes with the goal of giving parties through the peremptory challenge the right to obtain a degree of impartiality, in effect?"
1988.87-5259,0,38401,patricia_unsinn,,539.029,550.752,"Judge... Justice O'Connor, it's our position that there's nothing inconsistent with our argument and the achievement of a fair and impartial jury."
1988.87-5259,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,609.458,613.445,"Excuse me, you made some assumptions based on group identity."
1988.87-5259,0,38401,patricia_unsinn,,632.523,635.525,--It may be done all the time.
1988.87-5259,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,663.462,679.554,"Well, what about, let's say, a trial concerning a killing that has become a racial incident in the community in question, and let's assume that it's a group of young white men who have caused the death of a black man."
1988.87-5259,0,38401,patricia_unsinn,,699.485,713.56,"No, Judge, our position... although this case doesn't present that question... we would be willing to concede that any rule that this Court would adopt should apply equally to the defense as well as the prosecution."
1988.87-5259,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,728.154,741.545,"No individual basis, it just knows that this matter in the newspapers and elsewhere has just polarized the races in the community... just to be sure, if I can, I would like to keep as many whites as possible off the jury."
1988.87-5259,0,38401,patricia_unsinn,,743.128,744.663,--No.
1988.87-5259,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,763.041,774.182,"Well, Ms. Unsinn, under... if your client were being tried today, by virtue of Batson against Kentucky, this situation that you're complaining about couldn't occur, I assume."
1988.87-5259,0,38401,patricia_unsinn,,774.182,782.436,"Under the facts of this particular case, my client would succeed under either an Equal Protection analysis--"
1988.87-5259,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,782.436,785.455,"And would succeed under our holding, this Court's holding in Batson."
1988.87-5259,0,38401,patricia_unsinn,,797.429,798.881,"--Yes, that's correct."
1988.87-5259,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,798.881,802.933,"Well, Batson... what did it rest on?"
1988.87-5259,0,38401,patricia_unsinn,,802.933,805.035,The Equal Protection Clause.
1988.87-5259,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,805.035,807.487,And it's a racial case?
1988.87-5259,0,38401,patricia_unsinn,,807.487,812.891,Batson itself involved a black defendant.
1988.87-5259,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,812.891,813.074,"Yes, yes."
1988.87-5259,0,38401,patricia_unsinn,,813.074,814.641,I don't know that there were any--
1988.87-5259,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,814.641,820.461,And your argument would go beyond Batson because it would apply to any distinctive group in the community.
1988.87-5259,0,38401,patricia_unsinn,,820.461,821.247,--Yes.
1988.87-5259,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,822.797,828.651,"And furthermore, there are some people who say that Batson only applies in favor of the member of the group excluded."
1988.87-5259,0,38401,patricia_unsinn,,828.651,830.185,--This is correct.
1988.87-5259,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,830.185,839.041,"So your rule, if established, has a considerably broader impact than Batson?"
1988.87-5259,0,38401,patricia_unsinn,,839.041,841.174,In some respects it would.
1988.87-5259,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,857.253,866.026,"Do you think... who do you think could win on an Equal Protection basis, other than racial claimants?"
1988.87-5259,0,38401,patricia_unsinn,,866.026,868.292,--Perhaps a woman--
1988.87-5259,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,868.292,868.644,Religious?
1988.87-5259,0,38401,patricia_unsinn,,868.644,874.964,--A woman defendant who complains about exclusion of women jurors.
1988.87-5259,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,874.964,876.897,On an Equal Protection basis?
1988.87-5259,0,38401,patricia_unsinn,,876.897,878.166,On an Equal Protection basis.
1988.87-5259,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,878.166,879.366,Who else?
1988.87-5259,0,38401,patricia_unsinn,,879.366,883.487,"Judge, I don't know."
1988.87-5259,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,883.487,886.772,"But Batson would not automatically apply to them, I don't suppose?"
1988.87-5259,0,38401,patricia_unsinn,,886.772,889.557,"Pardon me, Justice?"
1988.87-5259,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,889.557,891.924,Batson wouldn't automatically apply to them?
1988.87-5259,0,38401,patricia_unsinn,,891.924,895.045,To every distinctive group in the community?
1988.87-5259,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,906.936,913.089,"Lower courts have gone considerably further in identifying other groups, I take it."
1988.87-5259,0,38401,patricia_unsinn,,913.089,923.028,"I am not aware of any widespread recognition of other groups, and I think that as I--"
1988.87-5259,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,923.028,926.814,I thought I had spotted a number in the cases around the country.
1988.87-5259,0,38401,patricia_unsinn,,926.814,930.634,--As the opinion in Taylor makes clear--
1988.87-5259,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,930.634,932.368,"Pretty much limitless, actually."
1988.87-5259,0,38401,patricia_unsinn,,945.228,958.201,"--There is that language in Lockhart v. McCree, although unnecessary to the result reached there, it suggests that the Court would be unwilling to do so."
1988.87-5259,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,958.201,974.913,"But I take it, under your Sixth Amendment theory, you want a jury that's representative of the community at large, which would include representative numbers of race, gender, I take it wealth?"
1988.87-5259,0,38401,patricia_unsinn,,974.913,980.032,"We're asking for the possibility that the jury be representative, yes."
1988.87-5259,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,980.032,985.436,At what point do you test whether or not this jury has been selected?
1988.87-5259,0,38401,patricia_unsinn,,1001.814,1014.288,"The test that we've proposed would require that the ultimate composition of the jury be unrepresentative of the community, so I don't know that after--"
1988.87-5259,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1014.288,1021.692,So you have to wait until all of the peremptory challenges have been exercised before you can determine whether the Constitution has been in violation?
1988.87-5259,0,38401,patricia_unsinn,,1021.692,1024.811,"--In many instances, I believe that would be so."
1988.87-5259,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1026.18,1029.382,"And at that point, you'd simply have to select an entirely new jury, I take it?"
1988.87-5259,0,38401,patricia_unsinn,,1029.382,1032.584,--I think that that's an open question.
1988.87-5259,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1050.211,1056.282,So you're proposing a standard where the judge could not make rulings on a challenge by challenge basis?
1988.87-5259,0,38401,patricia_unsinn,,1056.282,1061.75,No more so than I think he would be able to do in the Batson case.
1988.87-5259,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1061.75,1081.894,"I would think that anybody exercising a peremptory challenge is doing so at his peril unless he gives a reason for it, and would say I don't know whether this person is a member of a representative or a distinctive group or not, but if he or she is, here's why I'm throwing her or him off."
1988.87-5259,0,38401,patricia_unsinn,,1096.137,1097.72,"No, we're not saying that he needs cause."
1988.87-5259,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1116.032,1119.836,"At what point during the trial, Ms. Unsinn, does that happen?"
1988.87-5259,0,38401,patricia_unsinn,,1131.374,1140.047,"--I would imagine whenever it became evident that the representative nature of, character of the jury was being impaired."
1988.87-5259,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1140.047,1142.516,And how would one know when that had happened?
1988.87-5259,0,38401,patricia_unsinn,,1142.516,1150.688,"Whenever the... I would imagine it would be in the later stages of jury selection, when the parties are--"
1988.87-5259,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1150.688,1157.842,"Well, it only takes two or three weeks, or maybe a couple of months to get 12 jurors seated now in the State courts, sometimes."
1988.87-5259,0,38401,patricia_unsinn,,1162.096,1173.72,--I think the example of two or three weeks is probably an extreme situation and is not the case in the majority of situations.
1988.87-5259,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1214.095,1222.034,What rule of law would a prosecutor invoke if he wanted to challenge the peremptories exercised by a defendant?
1988.87-5259,0,38401,patricia_unsinn,,1222.034,1224.586,"--Judge, I--"
1988.87-5259,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1224.586,1225.253,Bad cross section?
1988.87-5259,0,38401,patricia_unsinn,,1225.253,1227.438,"--No, I don't believe so."
1988.87-5259,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1238.663,1241.198,"Is that a Federal, Constitutional requirement?"
1988.87-5259,0,38401,patricia_unsinn,,1241.198,1242.315,No.
1988.87-5259,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1242.315,1253.189,"Well, so you're saying there would be no Federal Constitutional basis for the prosecutor making, challenging peremptories of a defendant."
1988.87-5259,0,38401,patricia_unsinn,,1253.189,1258.993,"No, but the Court could allow the state to exercise--"
1988.87-5259,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1258.993,1259.426,Which?
1988.87-5259,0,38401,patricia_unsinn,,1259.959,1261.528,"--This Court, or a State court."
1988.87-5259,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1261.528,1265.813,"Well, we can't do anything except to a State court, except based on the Constitution."
1988.87-5259,0,38401,patricia_unsinn,,1265.813,1276.705,Then State courts could allow prosecutors to question the basis on which the defense counsel are making use of their challenges.
1988.87-5259,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1332.457,1333.441,How about age groups?
1988.87-5259,0,38401,patricia_unsinn,,1333.441,1350.336,"Justice, that would depend upon whether or not the defendant was able to persuade the trial judge that an age group would be a distinctive group in the community."
1988.87-5259,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1367.362,1373.249,"But even if a defendant doesn't persuade the trial judge, if he persuades the appellate court, he gets the same result, doesn't he?"
1988.87-5259,0,38401,patricia_unsinn,,1373.249,1373.951,--Yes.
1988.87-5259,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1373.951,1381.688,"Well, counsel, if we rule on this on the basis of Teague being a Negro, why did they have to get into all these other groups?"
1988.87-5259,0,38401,patricia_unsinn,,1381.688,1383.307,We don't.
1988.87-5259,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1383.307,1385.307,"Well, why are you arguing, then?"
1988.87-5259,0,38401,patricia_unsinn,,1385.307,1394.179,I'm just trying to remind the Court that this... adoption of this rule isn't going to lead to some horrendous consequence.
1988.87-5259,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1448.665,1453.967,Have you been involved in the criminal trials that have occurred since Batson?
1988.87-5259,0,38401,patricia_unsinn,,1453.967,1457.271,"No, Justice White, I have not."
1988.87-5259,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1459.038,1462.823,I was just wondering how the Batson rule is working out in practice then.
1988.87-5259,0,38401,patricia_unsinn,,1471.496,1483.673,"--Well, I think this case itself demonstrates when a defendant would attempt to make the complaint."
1988.87-5259,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1484.805,1487.207,On Federal habeas corpus.
1988.87-5259,0,38401,patricia_unsinn,,1487.207,1492.176,"--No, I'm speaking about when the complaint was made in the trial court."
1988.87-5259,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1558.804,1560.654,"Thank you, Ms. Unsinn."
1988.87-5259,1,20615,david_e_bindi,,1562.256,1584.752,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, your Honors, the Petitioner invokes the Sixth Amendment as the Constitutional basis for the relief he seeks in this case."
1988.87-5259,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1746.208,1777.513,"Well, let's say that in a post-Batson trial a defendant challenges a prosecutor's use of his peremptories, and the judge asks the prosecutor to justify striking all these women, or all these Blacks, and the prosecutor says well, I just don't think any Black or any woman sitting in this case can be an impartial juror."
1988.87-5259,1,20615,david_e_bindi,,1779.447,1783.733,"--Your Honor, in a post-Batson situation, that would not be a satisfactory reply."
1988.87-5259,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1783.733,1784.416,Why wouldn't it?
1988.87-5259,1,20615,david_e_bindi,,1784.416,1806.766,"Well, because Batson stands for the proposition that the Equal Protection Clause does not permit the peremptory challenges to be exercised on the basis of a stereotypical notion that jurors of a particular race will, in all cases, be favorable or more partial to, a defendant who is also a member of that same race."
1988.87-5259,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1806.766,1824.643,"But you say that in a fair cross section case, the prosecutor should have complete freedom to exercise those sort of stereotypical views by striking all members of a particular group?"
1988.87-5259,1,20615,david_e_bindi,,1824.643,1827.845,"Your Honor, yes, I contend that that's permissible."
1988.87-5259,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1847.857,1854.747,So you say Batson's got nothing to do with the rights of a defendant or just with potential jurors?
1988.87-5259,1,20615,david_e_bindi,,1854.747,1867.387,"No, your Honor, I agree that Batson v. Kentucky has to do not only... and the language in the opinion indicates this... that it has not only to do with the interests of the jurors, but with the interests of the defendants."
1988.87-5259,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1873.291,1879.445,"The interest the defendant can have is the interest in impartiality, I would assume, isn't it?"
1988.87-5259,1,20615,david_e_bindi,,1879.445,1892.086,"If that were in fact the case, your Honor, it would be difficult to explain Batson as an Equal Protection holding, because it was not a case that was brought by individual jurors who had been excused, but rather by a criminal defendant."
1988.87-5259,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1929.961,1951.41,"I suppose that our jury size case... was it Ballew v. Georgia, did rely in part on the fair cross section concept in saying you can't reduce the petit jury size beyond a certain level."
1988.87-5259,1,20615,david_e_bindi,,1951.41,1952.726,"That's true, your Honor."
1988.87-5259,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1960.682,1969.205,"So apparently there is some concern, then, with fair cross section at the petit jury level?"
1988.87-5259,1,20615,david_e_bindi,,1969.205,1970.372,"--Absolutely, your Honor."
1988.87-5259,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2003.343,2019.305,"If you have a case of a white civil rights worker who's been beaten and he is the victim, and whites are being tried, can blacks be stricken from the jury?"
1988.87-5259,1,20615,david_e_bindi,,2019.305,2023.773,Consistent with the cross section requirement--
1988.87-5259,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2023.773,2027.892,Consistent with Batson and consistent with the Sixth Amendment.
1988.87-5259,1,20615,david_e_bindi,,2027.892,2034.98,"--First of all, it would not be inconsistent under the Sixth Amendment to strike jurors on that basis on that factual situation."
1988.87-5259,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2172.203,2179.875,"What about... I just wanted to avoid all this wrangling about fair cross section, and Batson."
1988.87-5259,1,20615,david_e_bindi,,2190.932,2193.382,--There would be nothing at all un-Constitutional about that.
1988.87-5259,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2197.503,2202.824,And so a State could just do away with them?
1988.87-5259,1,20615,david_e_bindi,,2202.824,2204.157,"That's true, your Honor."
1988.87-5259,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2230.641,2231.926,What is that?
1988.87-5259,1,20615,david_e_bindi,,2231.926,2234.878,"The purpose the peremptory challenge serves, your Honor--"
1988.87-5259,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2234.878,2235.695,Appearance or actuality?
1988.87-5259,1,20615,david_e_bindi,,2235.695,2236.328,--Pardon me?
1988.87-5259,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2236.328,2247.603,You say that... you say that it really wouldn't affect the impartiality of a jury if peremptories were eliminated.
1988.87-5259,1,20615,david_e_bindi,,2251.721,2254.523,"That's correct, your Honor."
1988.87-5259,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2275.336,2279.371,Are you saying that some impartial juries are more impartial than others?
1988.87-5259,1,20615,david_e_bindi,,2279.371,2282.006,"No, your Honor, I don't--"
1988.87-5259,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2282.006,2282.756,That's what you're saying.
1988.87-5259,1,20615,david_e_bindi,,2282.756,2287.291,--I don't believe that that's what our position leads to.
1988.87-5259,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2287.291,2293.112,"Well, unless that's true, the peremptory challenge doesn't have any purpose at all, or any purpose that serves the society."
1988.87-5259,1,20615,david_e_bindi,,2293.112,2309.324,"Well, again, the purpose the peremptory challenge serves is first of all, because the process of voir dire examination and cause challenge has its limitations, the peremptory serves as a backstop."
1988.87-5259,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2331.57,2333.772,Enables you to get a really impartial jury?
1988.87-5259,1,20615,david_e_bindi,,2337.891,2341.961,"--Well, your Honor, I don't believe it's necessary to go that far."
1988.87-5259,2,38401,patricia_unsinn,,3020.315,3021.566,Thank you.
1988.87-5259,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3053.971,3055.904,One last question.
1988.87-5259,2,38401,patricia_unsinn,,3072.599,3076.717,"--No, Justice White, that has never been our position."
1988.87-5259,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3076.717,3078.102,"Well, you just said it was."
1988.87-5259,2,38401,patricia_unsinn,,3078.102,3080.704,"No, I think there's a distinction--"
1988.87-5259,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3080.704,3085.74,"If you don't get a fair cross section, you don't have the kind of a fair and impartial jury."
1988.87-5259,2,38401,patricia_unsinn,,3086.942,3100.416,"--No, our position is that we're entitled to the possibility of a fair cross section on our jury, and that's the reason that the Sixth Amendment requires that all distinctive groups in the community be included on the jury pool."
1988.87-5259,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3109.206,3111.974,With the law of chance?
1988.87-5259,2,38401,patricia_unsinn,,3111.974,3119.746,"--With the law of chance, which is not directly related to the ability of the individual jurors to be fair and impartial."
1988.87-5259,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3119.746,3123.698,The Government doesn't have an obligation to provide an impartial jury?
1988.87-5259,2,38401,patricia_unsinn,,3129.435,3130.419,That is correct.
1988.87-5259,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3131.054,3134.006,"Gee, I thought it had an obligation to provide an impartial jury."
1988.87-5259,2,38401,patricia_unsinn,,3134.006,3142.16,--It provides the possibility of a cross sectional jury whenever it includes all distinctive groups in the community in the pool.
1988.87-5259,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3151.385,3159.204,"Well, it says here that in all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial by an impartial jury."
1988.87-5259,2,38401,patricia_unsinn,,3179.302,3180.052,No--
1988.87-5259,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3180.052,3184.187,"If cross section is necessary for impartial, then the State must produce a cross section."
1988.87-5259,2,38401,patricia_unsinn,,3184.57,3187.372,"--No, I don't agree with that."
1988.87-5259,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3299.378,3300.495,"Thank you, Ms. Unsinn."
