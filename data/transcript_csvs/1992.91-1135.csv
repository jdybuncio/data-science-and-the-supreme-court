1992.91-1135,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.122,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Number 91-1135, the Newark Morning Ledger v. The United States."
1992.91-1135,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1911.311,1915.429,"Thank you Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1992.91-1135,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2072.379,2073.647,Is it really only that?
1992.91-1135,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2116.074,2135.886,"Well, the value that was measured here was a projection of the expected duration of continued patronage by these particular customers."
1992.91-1135,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2162.953,2165.721,"It's not just a relationship with customers, it seems to me."
1992.91-1135,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2180.147,2180.414,Even--
1992.91-1135,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2180.414,2181.932,--Unless and until they cancel the subscription.
1992.91-1135,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2183.116,2204.882,"--Even when there's a contract for a term, if it's one where regular renewal is anticipated, the commissioner does not allow depreciation for that term contract because that is just a symbol of an expectancy of continued patronage."
1992.91-1135,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2204.882,2216.689,Even if you have thousands of such contracts and you can show statistically that a certain percentage of those thousands will invariably be renewed?
1992.91-1135,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2216.689,2233.965,"Well, that's exactly the point, that the likelihood of renewal of a continued... that it's really just an evidence of a continuing patronage, even though the particular contract may be for a few months time or a year's time."
1992.91-1135,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2257.481,2264.17,What if it's a lease that continues from year to year unless affirmatively cancelled?
1992.91-1135,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2266.12,2279.43,"Well, that's what most tenants have a right to do when their lease expires, is to stay on until they give notice that they're moving with a month-to-month notice provision."
1992.91-1135,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2283.048,2287.916,"Well, there just isn't any depreciation."
1992.91-1135,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2289.618,2290.468,That's correct--
1992.91-1135,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2290.468,2291.904,--Because it's constantly renewing.
1992.91-1135,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2291.904,2293.404,--And that's the same situation we have here.
1992.91-1135,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2312.381,2313.15,So that the phrase is wrong?
1992.91-1135,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2317.268,2321.82,"--Well, it's an expectancy of continued patronage in whatever forms."
1992.91-1135,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2321.82,2329.993,"Well, is the mistake of the taxpayer here trying to make divisible what's really a single asset?"
1992.91-1135,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2332.326,2351.239,"That is part of our position, and we've pointed to cases in which owners of land or stocks have tried to give themselves a term of years' interest in what they own in order to try to depreciate over that term of years, and that has been disallowed in the case law."
1992.91-1135,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2351.239,2359.512,But there is a finding of the district court that the customer base is not self-renewing.
1992.91-1135,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2359.512,2361.845,"Well, it's not self-regenerating."
1992.91-1135,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2380.426,2384.394,"Well, I don't know about the behavior of these newspaper subscribers, but--"
1992.91-1135,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2384.394,2385.961,No business has--
1992.91-1135,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2385.961,2396.269,"--But the experts said that they could value this and that these people would not be subscribers after more than... well, 14 to 21 years."
1992.91-1135,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2396.269,2406.307,"--Well, of course it can be valued, there was evidence of that, but not everything measurable is amortizable, as I said."
1992.91-1135,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2424.603,2442.416,"Well, Mr. Wallace, isn't it possible to say that when proof and findings such as were made here, then it takes it out of the definition of goodwill and puts it squarely within the meaning of a statute as a wasting asset?"
1992.91-1135,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2447.201,2456.557,"Well, as a matter of fact, the customer base was not a wasting asset, as I pointed out."
1992.91-1135,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2456.557,2460.461,"Well, was that a finding here in the district court that it was?"
1992.91-1135,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2460.461,2471.936,"The district court said that it was irrelevant whether the subscribers were in fact increasing, so the district court did not make a finding."
1992.91-1135,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2483.909,2503.971,"Well, Mr. Wallace, I thought the 68 million dollars was the value to the paper of just the existing seasoned customers, whether or not they over got any subscribers at all to replace them."
1992.91-1135,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2514.596,2515.579,That was projected income--
1992.91-1135,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2515.579,2516.063,Isn't that right?
1992.91-1135,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2516.063,2518.215,--That was... not exactly.
1992.91-1135,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2523.951,2526.32,"From those 400,000 people."
1992.91-1135,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2526.32,2544.781,"--On the assumption that the newspaper would still be in business to receive it, but if it didn't do anything to generate additional customers, it would be unlikely to be able to receive it, and it would be unlikely to continue to have advertisers, which are the major source of income for a newspaper."
1992.91-1135,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2560.124,2570.016,"It nevertheless measured its value by the expected income from these 400,000 subscribers, isn't that right?"
1992.91-1135,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2570.016,2582.406,It tried to break away from the overall expectancy of continued patronage what they would expect to receive from the particular customers at the particular time.
1992.91-1135,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2584.373,2601.301,I suppose you can say if you can give a value to goodwill it must be because they're going to have just... they expect to keep the same number of customers or more over the years.
1992.91-1135,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2601.301,2604.919,"--Well, their goodwill depends on the same number... the same persons."
1992.91-1135,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2604.919,2607.871,"In which event, there's no depreciation."
1992.91-1135,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2607.871,2612.739,"Well, that's right, there's no depreciation of goodwill in whatever form it takes."
1992.91-1135,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2618.893,2635.319,"That means that we, if you're going to prevail in this case, have to define goodwill in a way other than the residual value which you yourself set out at page 3 in your brief."
1992.91-1135,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2650.078,2651.197,And it is recognized--
1992.91-1135,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2651.197,2659.034,--But it seems to me it is not consistent with the residual definition that you yourself embraced in the case.
1992.91-1135,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2659.034,2689.489,"--Well, we don't... there's some confusion between the residual method of allocating the purchase price and after you've allocated the purchase price to all the other assets that can be identified, the premium left over is what is associated with goodwill and with going-concern value, both of which are nondepreciable."
1992.91-1135,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2689.489,2695.393,So you say we have to define going-concern value?
1992.91-1135,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2695.393,2710.403,"Going-concern value is an accounting concept that is associated largely with the fact that facilities are in place, and particularly with the fact that there's a trained work force--"
1992.91-1135,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2710.403,2724.376,"Well, what is the definition of goodwill that you want us to apply, other than the residual method of determining?"
1992.91-1135,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2724.376,2725.178,--Yes.
1992.91-1135,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2729.13,2732.749,Is the essence of goodwill and may not be depreciated.
1992.91-1135,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2732.749,2734.268,--That is the essence.
1992.91-1135,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2990.936,3015.201,"Well, Mr. Wallace, it seems to me that none of those examples involve the kind of thing we have here, which is a contractual arrangement to have a newspaper delivered at the door unless and until the customer says I don't want it any more, or a relationship that you might have as a depositor in a bank... I want you to keep my assets until I terminate it."
1992.91-1135,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3015.201,3016.251,--Until I withdraw them.
1992.91-1135,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3016.251,3035.948,"Now, none of your examples have dealt with that kind of situation, which seems to me to be able to be analyzed for its expected life in a different way than in the examples you pose."
1992.91-1135,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3035.948,3043.534,"Well, only... only in a very limited way."
1992.91-1135,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3156.704,3157.037,I--
1992.91-1135,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3183.571,3185.573,"Well, I would agree with that--"
1992.91-1135,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3185.573,3209.005,"All right, then why didn't the... and perhaps the Government did, but did the Government oppose, then, the relevance of the expert testimony, or perhaps, indeed, even the foundation for the expert testimony, about there being a probable... I was going to say life expectancy to the asset."
1992.91-1135,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3221.563,3225.117,"--Well, we didn't... we in effect did."
1992.91-1135,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3265.675,3268.694,"Well, was that your position in the district court?"
1992.91-1135,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3268.694,3270.562,"So far as I'm aware, because--"
1992.91-1135,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3270.562,3277.899,"Well, the... your opposition suggests that the Government changed its position between the district court and the court of appeals."
1992.91-1135,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3277.899,3300.664,"--Well, I'm sure we refined it, as we often do, but we certainly did not take the position that they would be entitled to a depreciation deduction if they could show that the particular subscribers on the list would last over a particular period of time."
1992.91-1135,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3317.024,3323.028,One question I'm not sure I understood in your dialogue earlier with Justice Scalia.
1992.91-1135,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3343.573,3351.595,"Well, I am not aware that we conceded that contrary to all the case law--"
1992.91-1135,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3351.595,3363.836,"Well, what the court of appeals said was, the service does not dispute that the value of the paid subscribers would constitute... would not constitute goodwill if Morning Ledger's expectation of continued patronage were contractually based."
1992.91-1135,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3368.223,3391.486,"--If we... we... well, because it was not contractually based we didn't perhaps caution the court about the refinement between contracts that are expected to be renewed regularly, which are not depreciable, and term contracts that are."
1992.91-1135,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3391.486,3408.114,"But if the proper definition of the asset is given in terms of the probability of customers buying, as opposed to the probability of customers returning, or indeed, having to return, then you would not make that concession, would you?"
1992.91-1135,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3424.474,3446.989,"Well, the fact is that sufficiently long-term contractual obligations can be valued as a particular asset in situations where they don't represent just the normal short-term contracts that are expected to be renewed."
1992.91-1135,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3454.476,3461.582,Your objection is not to the valuation rather than in principle to the depreciability.
1992.91-1135,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3515.566,3552.841,"--Of course it has value, and a subscription list that is sold separately from an on-going business that is to be continued can be evaluated for its value as a marketing tool by the purchaser, and it has value to the purchaser of the on-going business, but that value is put into its capital account and it is offset against the price received when the asset is sold, when the business is sold."
1992.91-1135,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3561.428,3570.184,"Oh, I can show that those 5 percent of subscribers that I would not have gotten if I had not had the right to drop the newspaper on their stand, they're just lazy."
1992.91-1135,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3596.768,3616.165,"Well, it's contractual only in the sense that you have to hear from the subscriber to cut off the service of the particular subscriber, if, in fact, that would even be a transferable obligation to someone who wasn't carrying on the same business."
1992.91-1135,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3622.236,3639.28,"In your hypothetical regarding the fast-food chain across from the college, if it had been announced that the college was closing in 4 years, I take it an accountant would be required to depreciate the so-called goodwill, or the customer list, over 4 years."
1992.91-1135,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3639.28,3657.326,"Well, it might depend on what was going to happen to those campus facilities, and I rather doubt that the purchaser in those circumstances would have paid a premium that could be attributed to--"
1992.91-1135,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3657.326,3669.8,"Well, he might have paid for 4 years of revenue, and if it's measurable, it can be depreciated."
1992.91-1135,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3669.8,3690.313,--The valuation of the rest of the assets that were bought would probably preclude any premium left over for goodwill for an expectancy of future patronage in a situation where the expectancy does not look good.
1992.91-1135,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3697.383,3699.419,"Thank you, Mr. Wallace."
