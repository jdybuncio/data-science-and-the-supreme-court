1960.48,0,39817,richard_r_lyman,,208.936,217.2,"It appears at page 14 of our brief Your Honor, our original brief."
1960.48,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,217.2,222.6,Thank you.
1960.48,0,39817,richard_r_lyman,,222.6,239.211,"What we asked the Courts to do was not to vacate the injunction, not to open the door to any unlawful discrimination against these original plaintiffs and members of their class, but simply to give us a pro tanto modification."
1960.48,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,386.758,389.733,"(Inaudible) decree, there's a contract did you say?"
1960.48,0,39817,richard_r_lyman,,389.733,397.973,"Yes Your Honor, and of course in the Swift case, this Court discussed that concept in considerable length."
1960.48,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,504.803,508.425,Is the District Court opinion printed in the record on page --
1960.48,0,39817,richard_r_lyman,,508.425,520.245,Yes Your Honor that -- Judge Sherburne's opinion appears at page 69 of the record.
1960.48,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,524.644,529.973,"Oh, yes."
1960.48,0,39817,richard_r_lyman,,529.973,549.207,"Now, I think it's important to have in mind the nature of the discrimination that was charged in the original complaint, it illustrates that I have nothing to do with this so-called bitterness or hostility."
1960.48,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,952.71,955.245,"Mr. Lyman, may ask you please?"
1960.48,0,39817,richard_r_lyman,,968.323,971.974,"I don't know what Your Honor means, but -- but types ---"

1960.48,0,39817,richard_r_lyman,,973.641,976.132,That was a racial discrimination case.
1960.48,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,976.132,976.828,I beg your pardon?
1960.48,0,39817,richard_r_lyman,,976.828,978.787,That was a racial discrimination case.
1960.48,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,978.787,981.187,Steele and Tuns -- Steele and Tunstall dealt with --
1960.48,0,39817,richard_r_lyman,,981.187,981.55,Yes.

1960.48,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,986.802,991.353,They couldn't be members of the union but nevertheless what members of the bargaining union.
1960.48,0,39817,richard_r_lyman,,991.353,994.621,"Well they -- they are -- sorry, the answer to your question Your Honor is yes."
1960.48,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,994.621,995.356,They can be.
1960.48,0,39817,richard_r_lyman,,995.356,996.607,They can be.
1960.48,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1127.847,1131.74,Did the District Court take the position that he did not have the power?
1960.48,0,39817,richard_r_lyman,,1131.74,1150.93,"No, the District Court said he had power to modify the injunction but then he cons -- construed this consent decree as I've said as being a contract, an agreement, strictly contradiction to what this Court has so plainly and clearly stated in the Swift case."
1960.48,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1150.93,1154.021,You mean as being an agreement that you would never seek a modification on the decree?
1960.48,0,39817,richard_r_lyman,,1154.021,1155.613,Yes -- yes Your Honor.
1960.48,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1155.613,1158.397,Where is it -- why did he say this?
1960.48,0,39817,richard_r_lyman,,1158.397,1161.022,Not that we would never seek a modification.
1960.48,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1169.15,1171.152,"Well that would be the same thing, isn't it?"
1960.48,0,39817,richard_r_lyman,,1171.152,1172.501,And we didn't agree to that.
1960.48,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1186.181,1189.79,The language of the injunction permanent or did the court retain jurisdiction?
1960.48,0,39817,richard_r_lyman,,1189.79,1193.482,The Court retain jurisdiction expressly in the injunction.
1960.48,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1193.482,1194.332,"Well, what purpose?"

1960.48,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1235.139,1249.492,"Unless suppose that you had -- I don't -- I don't know, but I suppose if you had made a contract based on the valuable consideration which was valid that you would never seek a modification, it might be that the rule was not popular."
1960.48,0,39817,richard_r_lyman,,1249.492,1263.421,"Well, Mr. Justice Black if -- if such a contract rather than the Railway Labor Act were the basis for the Court's order of injunction, the Court would have no jurisdiction under the Norris-LaGuardia Act."
1960.48,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1294.053,1299.205,Was there any effort made -- or was any evidence open to show that there was a contract?
1960.48,0,39817,richard_r_lyman,,1299.205,1299.476,"No, Your Honor."
1960.48,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1299.476,1302.47,Despite of the fact that it's simply been sent decree here?
1960.48,0,39817,richard_r_lyman,,1302.47,1305.061,That is all the evidence through this.

1960.48,0,39817,richard_r_lyman,,1329.383,1333.731,-- except to say that this must be construed as cascading one.
1960.48,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1367.945,1374.971,What is the exact language where the Court said that?

1960.48,0,39817,richard_r_lyman,,1384.81,1386.809,"The Court says, ""When the injunction was issued?"
1960.48,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1446.063,1450.068,In perpetuity -- in perpetuity?
1960.48,0,39817,richard_r_lyman,,1453.295,1462.399,"The Court of Appeals as they have a counsel for response and as I recollect, he said he did claim it was in perpetuity."
1960.48,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1462.399,1470.606,Where is that record -- the record with reference to the $4000 -- $5000 payment that you referred too?
1960.48,0,39817,richard_r_lyman,,1474.194,1485.601,"No, it was the separate release but I don't recall whether that release was ever entered into the record in this case."

1960.48,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1507.155,1512.712,"Well, did the Court, which decided the case have agree before it?"
1960.48,0,39817,richard_r_lyman,,1512.712,1514.765,There was no agreement but they could have referral.
1960.48,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1514.765,1517.001,"But, I'm talking about the one that's now in the brief."
1960.48,0,39817,richard_r_lyman,,1521.567,1526.421,What is in the brief is not an agreement Mr. Justice Black.
1960.48,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1526.421,1526.708,"Oh, whatever it is."
1960.48,0,39817,richard_r_lyman,,1526.708,1528.477,It is -- it is a release.
1960.48,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1528.477,1529.194,"Well, is the -- was the release (Voice Overlap) --"
1960.48,0,39817,richard_r_lyman,,1529.194,1531.118,The Court -- the Court did have that before --
1960.48,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1531.118,1532.914,-- or it did have so it's -- it's really part of the record (Voice Overlap) --
1960.48,0,39817,richard_r_lyman,,1532.914,1535.547,Not and -- I don't believe he did in 1945.
1960.48,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1539.12,1543.958,So it is to be considered as a part of the record then you say.
1960.48,0,39817,richard_r_lyman,,1543.958,1560.641,"If it's reproduced here, I -- I don't find it in here so I -- I guess we can't consider it part of the record except that I have no quarrel with the statement of counsel that that is what took place."
1960.48,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1560.641,1562.095,"Now, what is what took place?"
1960.48,0,39817,richard_r_lyman,,1564.748,1577.969,It's recited at page 5 and 6 on the brief for counsel other than the respondent now and then.

1960.48,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,1681.192,1688.341,"What is your -- I suppose what the technical issue is, is to whether this is an abusive discretion when the Court begun."
1960.48,0,39817,richard_r_lyman,,1688.341,1689.256,We have --
1960.48,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,1689.256,1689.895,-- that it isn't a (Voice Overlap)--
1960.48,0,39817,richard_r_lyman,,1689.895,1692.893,We have mentioned that on our brief Your Honor.

1960.48,1,35756,marshall_p_eldred,,1979.426,1980.197,Yes.
1960.48,1,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,1980.197,1984.252,You're talking about something underlying the decree that --
1960.48,1,35756,marshall_p_eldred,,1984.252,1993.326,"That is the agreement, that's the parties reach -- the understanding that the parties reached when this case will settle."
1960.48,1,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,1993.326,1994.604,Before the decree.
1960.48,1,35756,marshall_p_eldred,,1994.604,1995.149,Yes sir.
1960.48,1,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,1995.149,1999.563,"Now, where is the -- what -- what is there to show that underlying agreement?"
1960.48,1,35756,marshall_p_eldred,,1999.563,2010.138,"That is shown in the release which the 28th named plaintiffs executed on December the 1st, 1945."

1960.48,1,35756,marshall_p_eldred,,2011.828,2016.705,That appears on page 138 of the record.
1960.48,1,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,2016.705,2021.17,What could provision of that release?
1960.48,1,35756,marshall_p_eldred,,2021.17,2029.197,"This provision if Your Honor please, the premises refer to the filing of the suit."
1960.48,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2039.357,2040.079,Where you reading at?
1960.48,1,35756,marshall_p_eldred,,2040.079,2043.213,In the -- of page 138 of the record.
1960.48,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2043.213,2046.735,Yes.
1960.48,1,35756,marshall_p_eldred,,2046.735,2084.449,"They agreed to settle and dispose of all the issues and dispute in the following manner, one, the entering of a consent decree and the forth said actions, the purpose of which will be to protect the undersigned against any future acts of practices of or by the defendants which will deny to the undersigned any of their rights and benefits under the collective bargaining agreements now in effect are which may hereafter be entered into, in accordance with the Railway Labor Act find between the L&N and System Federation 91 a copy of which consent decree is a test here too."
1960.48,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2084.449,2085.851,May I ask you that?
1960.48,1,35756,marshall_p_eldred,,2085.851,2087.429,"Yes, sir."
1960.48,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2087.429,2096.563,"You said which was denied of the undersigning of their rights and benefits, at that time, they had a right not to be asked by reason of a union shop agreement, doesn't it?"
1960.48,1,35756,marshall_p_eldred,,2096.563,2097.798,"Yes, sir."
1960.48,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2097.798,2100.309,"And the 1951 Act changed it, doesn't it?"
1960.48,1,35756,marshall_p_eldred,,2100.309,2103.144,The 1951 Act merely made it permissive.
1960.48,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2103.144,2105.799,"Yes, but it made it permissive for them to negotiate further."
1960.48,1,35756,marshall_p_eldred,,2105.799,2107.154,"Yes, yes, sir."
1960.48,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2107.154,2119.04,"As I gather, you're real disputed whether this denies to them the right to negotiate which was granted absence agreement under the Act of 1951."
1960.48,1,35756,marshall_p_eldred,,2119.04,2131.382,We say that since the amendment is permissive only that an agreement now not to have a union shop is legal under the amendment.
1960.48,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2131.382,2132.552,It's legal but --
1960.48,1,35756,marshall_p_eldred,,2132.552,2133.192,It was legal
1960.48,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2133.192,2137.193,"-- it would not be illegal if they have one, would it?"
1960.48,1,35756,marshall_p_eldred,,2137.193,2138.934,If they have an agreement not to have a union shop?
1960.48,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2138.934,2144.357,If it would not be illegal if they would have an agreement now to have that kind of a union shop?
1960.48,1,35756,marshall_p_eldred,,2144.357,2146.03,"Oh no, no it would not be illegal."
1960.48,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2146.03,2149.108,So it wouldn't deprived anybody of any right --
1960.48,1,35756,marshall_p_eldred,,2149.108,2149.311,"Well, then --"
1960.48,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2149.311,2152.267,-- the employee of any right unless they have it under a contract.
1960.48,1,35756,marshall_p_eldred,,2152.267,2153.377,Exactly.
1960.48,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2153.995,2163.97,"And at the -- at the time of the contract, could an agreement had been entered into for -- for a union shop on the label?"
1960.48,1,35756,marshall_p_eldred,,2163.97,2165.037,No sir.
1960.48,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2165.037,2175.304,Well then that which stay -- that's what you rely on as having been a consensual arrangement.
1960.48,1,35756,marshall_p_eldred,,2175.304,2178.261,And contractor.
1960.48,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2178.261,2188.107,"But in that, I can set you a contractual arrangement, wasn't really a contractual arrangement because they weren't free to have the opposite arrangement."
1960.48,1,35756,marshall_p_eldred,,2188.107,2194.161,It was in this sense of the word.
1960.48,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2235.259,2256.117,"But, that you go further here Mr. Eldred, in effect, aren't you saying what this agreement says, this agreement, the -- without preferring the release, you can't, by law, have a union shop agreement, if ever the day comes when you may negotiate for one, we now say we'll not exercise our right to negotiate (Voice Overlap) --"
1960.48,1,35756,marshall_p_eldred,,2256.117,2256.859,Precisely.
1960.48,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2256.859,2257.699,That's what you're saying?
1960.48,1,35756,marshall_p_eldred,,2257.699,2258.315,Exactly.
1960.48,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2258.315,2260.011,And you read all of that into this?
1960.48,1,35756,marshall_p_eldred,,2260.011,2265.192,"Yes, because the unions went farther than they were -- were required to go."
1960.48,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2290.3,2301.06,"Well, before you get to that, I wonder if they did go that far in this -- this paragraph that you have just written -- or just read."
1960.48,1,35756,marshall_p_eldred,,2344.757,2355.335,"By reason of their failure to join or maintain membership in the union, at that time of course, the Railway Labor Act forbad the union shop."

1960.48,1,35756,marshall_p_eldred,,2392.025,2393.777,-- no matter how much the amended here.
1960.48,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2393.777,2397.836,"Either one of the parties contemplated at that time the Act of 1951, sir?"
1960.48,1,35756,marshall_p_eldred,,2397.836,2398.518,Yes.
1960.48,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2398.518,2399.093,But that's --
1960.48,1,35756,marshall_p_eldred,,2399.093,2399.197,And I'll (Voice Overlap) --
1960.48,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2399.197,2405.233,"Well, why wouldn't they've -- couldn't they have said that very well and very easily if that's what they intended?"
1960.48,1,35756,marshall_p_eldred,,2405.233,2417.201,"I think they said it very well indeed if you will look at the language of the decree and you remember that a copy of this degree -- decree was attached to the release, a week before the decree was ever entered."
1960.48,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2417.201,2451.618,"Would you agree Mr. Eldred (Inaudible) questions come to my head namely, would you agree that you have to show that at the time of this release, it's the time of the injunction, the import is going to have -- or the amendment of the Railway Labor Act goes to allow union shop, was an active issue in the railway -- in the railroad world or in the part of the railroad and in part of the Brotherhood."
1960.48,1,35756,marshall_p_eldred,,2452.699,2452.798,I'm not --
1960.48,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2452.798,2469.519,"Would you agree that you have to find out that it had that kind of reality or -- or immediacy rather that to say that by just general language, they foreclose themselves against calling and unanticipated legislation."
1960.48,1,35756,marshall_p_eldred,,2469.519,2473.476,I'm not that all sure that was necessary to show in the action.
1960.48,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2475.357,2478.82,I don't mean in the action but in the -- in the word -- in the world that which they were moved.
1960.48,1,35756,marshall_p_eldred,,2478.82,2479.711,It was well.
1960.48,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2583.251,2585.339,That wasn't the only -- that wasn't the only thing.
1960.48,1,35756,marshall_p_eldred,,2588.108,2589.383,"No, sir."
1960.48,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2607.978,2626.214,"I thought you're arguing it was that that this -- that this conflict that there wasn't any today, 1960 under these facts that existed at the time of his conflict in this record."
1960.48,1,35756,marshall_p_eldred,,2632.478,2636.713,I'm not sure if I understand Your Honor's question.
1960.48,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2636.713,2649.084,"I -- it's been assumed that there's -- that the injunction was issued under the -- on the facts existing prior to the 1951 amendment under a law that was different form the 1951 amendment, is that right?"
1960.48,1,35756,marshall_p_eldred,,2649.084,2653.067,"It was issued, Mr. Justice, because --"
1960.48,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2653.067,2653.353,Yes.
1960.48,1,35756,marshall_p_eldred,,2653.353,2657.861,-- there was discrimination which the Railway Labor Act forbade under this Court's --
1960.48,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2657.861,2682.935,"I -- I thought that your argument was that if there was a -- the conflict, an intense conflict disturbing the railroad management for rolling of the -- of the -- by this -- by the stop, the movement of train because of a union disputed this character that today, a District Court could enter precisely this kind of a decree in spite of the 1951."
1960.48,1,35756,marshall_p_eldred,,2682.935,2685.102,It could do so.
1960.48,1,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,2749.805,2754.793,"(Voice Overlap) said that this doesn't say that though, this -- this agreement, does it?"
1960.48,1,35756,marshall_p_eldred,,2754.793,2757.556,Yes.
1960.48,1,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,2759.539,2765.544,"Perhaps, there are extra words in there why -- [Laughter] alright."
1960.48,1,35756,marshall_p_eldred,,2765.544,2767.256,That maybe zeal of advocacy --
1960.48,1,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,2767.256,2767.747,"Well, --"
1960.48,1,35756,marshall_p_eldred,,2767.747,2769.402,-- but Mr. Justice --
1960.48,1,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,2769.402,2772.336,"Undoubtedly, that goes with the heart of the case, wasn't it?"
1960.48,1,35756,marshall_p_eldred,,2786.985,2807.594,"First, on the middle paragraph of page 7, we have the declaration of rights that the non-union employees be entitled irrespective and without regard to whether said employees or any of them were members or join or retain membership in any of the defendant labor organizations or in any labor organization."
1960.48,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2807.594,2809.522,What page is this?
1960.48,1,35756,marshall_p_eldred,,2809.522,2811.871,37 Mr. Chief Justice.
1960.48,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2811.871,2812.882,37.
1960.48,2,39817,richard_r_lyman,,3710.87,3720.977,"Mr. Chief Justice, I wanted to state that particularly with respect to this agreement argument."
1960.48,2,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,3765.33,3769.454,I thought he was reading record on 138.
1960.48,2,39817,richard_r_lyman,,3769.454,3779.063,"-- he turned -- he read the -- from the release for a while and then we he got down to the declaration of rights, he was reading from page 37 of the record, the decree."
1960.48,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3795.171,3818.373,"May I ask you this question and -- these 28 plaintiffs, the original plaintiffs for the class which they represent, do they -- was there any -- any differentiation between them and the other members of your -- the members of your unions except for these people have principles regarding union empathy?"
1960.48,2,39817,richard_r_lyman,,3818.373,3829.977,"Well, I think that 28 people were just a -- a group that claimed they could show some wage loss or (Inaudible) missed out on some overtime assignments or promotions and --"
1960.48,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3829.977,3832.509,Were there -- were there any racial problems about this?
1960.48,2,39817,richard_r_lyman,,3832.509,3832.904,"No, this is not --"
1960.48,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3832.904,3833.425,Were they colored or white?
1960.48,2,39817,richard_r_lyman,,3833.425,3835.235,This is not a racial case.
1960.48,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3835.235,3836.577,I mean what the -- what were these plaintiffs?
1960.48,2,39817,richard_r_lyman,,3837.223,3838.949,I think there are probably some of both.
1960.48,3,35756,marshall_p_eldred,,3844.496,3844.888,There were both.
1960.48,4,39817,richard_r_lyman,,3844.888,3845.828,-- correct me on that.
1960.48,4,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3847.851,3851.024,"Those 28, about some of total of those who were (Voice Overlap) --"
1960.48,4,39817,richard_r_lyman,,3851.024,3864.155,That's all that there were in the original action and I might say that -- I propose Your Honor's question to Mr. Eldred down the consideration concept and settlement of this thing for $5000.
1960.48,4,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3886.019,3895.379,"What they did -- the settlement or the claim which was settled in there and something for them, was a claim of discrimination, wasn't it?"
1960.48,4,39817,richard_r_lyman,,3900.504,3902.847,"Well, we learn as we go along."
1960.48,4,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3934.704,3935.43,All I'm suggesting --
1960.48,4,39817,richard_r_lyman,,3935.43,3940.462,But they -- they argued that they had gotten deprive over fair share because they were not members of the union.
1960.48,4,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3940.462,3941.949,"They have a grievance, didn't they?"
1960.48,4,39817,richard_r_lyman,,3941.949,3945.662,"Yes, it was a grievance based under the language of the collective bargaining agreement."
1960.48,4,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3945.662,3948.936,And -- and that is under the agreement itself they --
1960.48,4,39817,richard_r_lyman,,3948.936,3949.377,Yes.
1960.48,4,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3949.377,3951.161,-- their claim was recognized --
1960.48,4,39817,richard_r_lyman,,3951.161,3951.455,The agreement --
1960.48,4,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3951.455,3951.473,-- and if maybe --
1960.48,4,39817,richard_r_lyman,,3951.473,3952.893,-- is called for equal distribution of overtime.
1960.48,4,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3952.893,3958.679,"-- (Inaudible), maybe that's -- maybe they -- they had from experience."
1960.48,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3967.796,3980.554,"One -- I've just had one other question, is the injunction against you are entering into open sub-agreement under the new Act with reference to everybody, the employees now or is it limited to these 28?"
1960.48,4,39817,richard_r_lyman,,3980.554,3982.071,It's not limited to the 28.
1960.48,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3982.071,3983.434,A general blanket.
1960.48,4,39817,richard_r_lyman,,3983.434,3984.274,It's a blanket injunction against the railroad and the --
1960.48,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3984.274,3987.931,Injunction that you have upon the obligation under --
1960.48,4,39817,richard_r_lyman,,3987.931,3988.919,Yes.
1960.48,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3988.919,3989.141,-- whether the person (Voice Overlap) --
1960.48,4,39817,richard_r_lyman,,3989.141,4007.617,"And of course in the Swift case, the Court clearly pointed out that so far as the interveners were concerned, people other than the original parties to that case, they couldn't take advantage of the thing if it were contractual (Inaudible) because they weren't parties that running contractual undertake."
1960.48,4,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4007.617,4019.315,Was there a -- was the -- was the (Inaudible) hearing before to Judge Sherburne joined in -- in entering the decree which is not on the record?
1960.48,4,39817,richard_r_lyman,,4019.315,4020.811,I wasn't there Your Honor.
1960.48,4,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4020.95,4022.4,Which is not in the record?
1960.48,4,39817,richard_r_lyman,,4022.4,4022.82,But I don't believe there was --
1960.48,4,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4022.82,4023.591,(Voice Overlap) --
1960.48,4,39817,richard_r_lyman,,4023.591,4026.404,-- any hearing -- you're talking about the 1945 decree.
1960.48,4,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4026.404,4027.166,That's what I'm talking about.
1960.48,4,39817,richard_r_lyman,,4027.166,4040.374,The decree was drawn up by the parties in conferences between the parties to the lawsuit and exchanged drafts and proposals as to what the decree are to recite and then it was --
1960.48,4,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4040.374,4040.736,And before (Voice Overlap) --
1960.48,4,39817,richard_r_lyman,,4040.736,4043.945,-- stipulated that it would be submitted to the judge for a signature.
1960.48,4,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4043.945,4046.546,Before it was submit -- when it was submitted to him?
1960.48,4,39817,richard_r_lyman,,4046.546,4046.701,It was explained to him I'm sure.
1960.48,4,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4046.701,4050.729,"And before it was done, were there any arguments (Inaudible)?"
1960.48,4,39817,richard_r_lyman,,4050.729,4052.206,I don't believe there was argument --
1960.48,4,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4052.206,4056.825,From the lieu that I know of Judge (Inaudible) satisfied himself as (Inaudible).
1960.48,4,39817,richard_r_lyman,,4056.825,4060.527,I'm sure you wanted to know what the case all about.
1960.48,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4060.527,4066.586,What percent of the total employees are members now?
1960.48,4,39817,richard_r_lyman,,4066.586,4071.437,"Well, that's a subject to disputed propaganda claims."
1960.48,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4086.261,4087.609,50% what?
1960.48,4,39817,richard_r_lyman,,4087.609,4091.565,50% members and 50% non-members in the classes.
1960.48,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4099.798,4106.703,"I suppose, over 15 years, it's been turnover in person now or union officers and the like have --"
1960.48,4,39817,richard_r_lyman,,4106.703,4111.453,"Yes, there has been considerable turnover in the officers."
1960.48,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4112.316,4112.58,All the 28 --
1960.48,4,39817,richard_r_lyman,,4112.58,4113.06,-- happy to the general chairman --
1960.48,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4113.06,4115.807,"-- plaintiffs, are they still employed?"
1960.48,4,39817,richard_r_lyman,,4115.807,4117.25,No.
1960.48,5,35756,marshall_p_eldred,,4124.067,4125.109,Original plaintiffs left?
1960.48,6,39817,richard_r_lyman,,4125.109,4126.479,"(Inaudible) originally, yes."
1960.48,7,35756,marshall_p_eldred,,4126.479,4132.986,About eight of the 28 but we had a great many interveners.
1960.48,8,39817,richard_r_lyman,,4132.986,4141.147,There would be eight of the original plaintiffs initially imposed in which to modify and then a number of other employees came in and joined with them in imposing that.
1960.48,8,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4141.147,4146.834,"But how many employees are there all total, you said 50% -- 50% of about what?"
1960.48,8,39817,richard_r_lyman,,4146.834,4150.34,It's between 4000 and 5000 in the shop crafts group.
1960.48,8,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4150.34,4153.151,4000 to 5000.
1960.48,8,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4153.151,4155.537,Where were these employees?
1960.48,8,39817,richard_r_lyman,,4155.537,4162.087,They are all over the system of the Louisville National Railroad Company in the (Inaudible).
1960.48,8,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4170.977,4172.892,"I mean these 28, where were they from?"
1960.48,8,39817,richard_r_lyman,,4172.892,4174.843,They were all from around Louisville.
