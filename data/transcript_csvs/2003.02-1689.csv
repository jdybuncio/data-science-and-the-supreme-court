2003.02-1689,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.031,"We'll hear argument next No. 02-1689, Grupo Dataflux v. Atlas Global Group."
2003.02-1689,0,43826,william_j_boyce,,51.164,54.036,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2003.02-1689,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,75.418,77.442,May I ask you with respect to that?
2003.02-1689,0,43826,william_j_boyce,,94.903,97.604,"There are two answers to your question, Justice Ginsburg."
2003.02-1689,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,123.139,126.733,There's a curious thing about what Dataflux did.
2003.02-1689,0,43826,william_j_boyce,,135.482,136.225,Correct.
2003.02-1689,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,136.225,140.229,And why would it do that if they were members of the partnership.
2003.02-1689,0,43826,william_j_boyce,,151.253,153.853,"Two answers to that... that question, Your Honor."
2003.02-1689,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,198.147,205.245,"But at that stage, you called them employees or former employees."
2003.02-1689,0,43826,william_j_boyce,,213.501,225.473,"--There... there was some confusion early on in terms of what exactly their status was and we, Dataflux, did not thoroughly explore that issue early on."
2003.02-1689,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,247.105,248.135,"Well, you've admitted it."
2003.02-1689,0,43826,william_j_boyce,,251.396,252.799,"Yes, Your Honor."
2003.02-1689,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,307.867,310.262,"Well, there was in the constitutional sense."
2003.02-1689,0,43826,william_j_boyce,,314.266,331.15,"--I think the... there is some room to discuss that, Justice Ginsburg, in light of the dissent's contention that there was, in fact, no diversity where you have one litigant here, one plaintiff, one defendant, and both are citizens of Mexico at that time."
2003.02-1689,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,332.925,336.452,"But that's not what... well, correct me if I'm wrong."
2003.02-1689,0,43826,william_j_boyce,,339.695,340.438,--That is correct.
2003.02-1689,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,340.438,345.64,And that it... and that there are three players involved... five.
2003.02-1689,0,43826,william_j_boyce,,348.446,349.81,There... there--
2003.02-1689,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,349.81,356.498,So then you would have on one side Texan and Mexican and the other side Texan.
2003.02-1689,0,43826,william_j_boyce,,365.536,384.483,"--Atlas is one entity with multiple citizenships, and... and if... if the question suggests that there was some kind of a... a dismissal mechanism available to make the... the Mexican citizenship go away, I don't believe that that is available under the facts of this case because it's... it... there were--"
2003.02-1689,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,384.483,384.855,But it's what happened.
2003.02-1689,0,43826,william_j_boyce,,388.198,397.652,--Pursuant to Atlas' decision to change the constitution of its partnership after the time of filing and before the case was submitted to the... to the jury.
2003.02-1689,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,398.728,400.253,"Yes, long before the case was tried."
2003.02-1689,0,43826,william_j_boyce,,400.253,402.732,Before the... approximate--
2003.02-1689,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,402.732,405.416,"Well, so when the case... when this case was tried, there was complete diversity."
2003.02-1689,0,43826,william_j_boyce,,405.416,406.242,--That is correct.
2003.02-1689,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,437.244,440.504,I thought in Mollan v. Torrance exactly what I described happened.
2003.02-1689,0,43826,william_j_boyce,,450.164,470.598,"--I think that the statement in Mollan, as reflected in Conolly and then applied in Anderson v. Watt, Your Honor, is that if the change in circumstances is the result of the addition or subtraction of a party, that's one circumstance, but here we have something entirely different, which is a change in citizenship."
2003.02-1689,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,477.368,477.585,"No, it's not the same."
2003.02-1689,0,43826,william_j_boyce,,485.719,486.546,"Correct, under Carden."
2003.02-1689,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,486.546,494.635,"So you have, just as if you'd have five individuals... that's what they are in fact... in effect, because they're jointly and severally liable."
2003.02-1689,0,43826,william_j_boyce,,516.1,534.47,"I would respectfully disagree, Your Honor, because I think Atlas' citizenship changed by virtue of changing the composition of its partnership, and that is on all fours the same circumstance as if a... a litigant had lived in one State and then tried to move to another State in an effort to create retroactive diversity jurisdiction."
2003.02-1689,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,534.47,534.926,But it didn't leave Texas behind.
2003.02-1689,0,43826,william_j_boyce,,554.161,580.844,"The... the function of Atlas changing its citizenship after the time of filing and thereafter claiming... this is Atlas' argument... that that cures our jurisdictional defect, I would submit to the Court, is the same thing as a citizen moving from one State to the other because, in effect, what Atlas is saying, by relying on that argument, is we moved out of... move out of Mexico and... and resided exclusively in Texas as of the time of suit."
2003.02-1689,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,593.913,599.858,"If Atlas had been a corporation incorporated in Texas, then there would have been complete diversity."
2003.02-1689,0,43826,william_j_boyce,,600.312,601.51,--I'm... I didn't--
2003.02-1689,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,601.51,612.861,"If Atlas... instead of being a partnership composed of five members, it had organized as a corporation, as a Texas corporation."
2003.02-1689,0,43826,william_j_boyce,,612.861,616.947,--Then it would be under the... the different provision of 1332.
2003.02-1689,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,623.513,631.519,"But would... would... my question is wouldn't the... if these... if this entity had been organized as a corporation, there would have been complete diversity."
2003.02-1689,0,43826,william_j_boyce,,631.519,647.428,"There... there... yes, there would not be an issue here because of a different operation of 1332 as applied to corporations, but the point of Carden was, as... as I read the case, is that limited partnerships are going to be treated differently."
2003.02-1689,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,647.428,647.966,Yes.
2003.02-1689,0,43826,william_j_boyce,,647.966,649.247,There is no analog from corporate--
2003.02-1689,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,649.247,665.427,"But I don't want to belabor this any further, but you do see the difference between an individual moving from New York to New Jersey, say, and a... a partnership with five partners, all of whom remain where they are."
2003.02-1689,0,43826,william_j_boyce,,673.562,693.002,"--I understand the... the point, and our position is that when Atlas contends that it has cured the jurisdictional defect by changing the composition of its partnership, that is effectively the same as the litigant moving from New Jersey to New York and claiming I have... I have fixed the jurisdictional problem because my citizenship has changed."
2003.02-1689,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,700.311,703.405,"Mr. Boyce, can I ask you a question about how far your position extends?"
2003.02-1689,0,43826,william_j_boyce,,725.324,726.4,"Yes, Your Honor."
2003.02-1689,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,726.855,727.226,All right.
2003.02-1689,0,43826,william_j_boyce,,737.174,745.969,--I don't think it would be the proper subject of a collateral attack after the initial case in which it has been adjudicated is over with.
2003.02-1689,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,752.385,759.238,"So you say it can always be raised on direct... while... until final judgment is entered, but it can never be raised on collateral attack."
2003.02-1689,0,43826,william_j_boyce,,759.238,761.284,--That is my understanding.
2003.02-1689,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,799.818,807.603,"We have to punish some other way, maybe fine you or make you pay costs for the other side, but we cannot punish you for that by expanding our own jurisdiction."
2003.02-1689,0,43826,william_j_boyce,,808.596,809.172,--That... that's our point.
2003.02-1689,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,809.172,813.426,"Capron against Noorden was one party on one side, one party on the other."
2003.02-1689,0,43826,william_j_boyce,,830.82,840.851,I... I would like to address the circumstances under which this case is distinguishable from Caterpillar because that obviously is... is what Atlas relies very heavily on in its briefing.
2003.02-1689,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,858.024,873.173,"So if the... this would be the same if the... Atlas had come to the court and said, now, court, I want you to dismiss the two Mexicans because they're no longer part of the corporation, and gotten an order to... to do that."
2003.02-1689,0,43826,william_j_boyce,,873.173,875.009,That would be a different circumstance.
2003.02-1689,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,917.384,928.901,"My question was could they have dismissed and... and as far as removal, I perhaps don't remember Caterpillar that well, but of course, it arose out of a removal."
2003.02-1689,0,43826,william_j_boyce,,933.609,960.525,"--Your Honor, I... I would not presume to... to say what the... the Court meant to do, but I would highlight the discussion in the subsequent Lexicon case where the point, I think, was made that indeed Caterpillar was grounded on the removal statute and specifically section 1441, the issue being in Caterpillar that the case was not fit for Federal adjudication at the time of removal and that that was the error."
2003.02-1689,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,962.261,962.383,Yes.
2003.02-1689,0,43826,william_j_boyce,,985.933,996.811,"--I would submit, Your Honor, that there are different... there's a different statutory overlay that... that was being addressed in Caterpillar, the overlay of the removal statutes."
2003.02-1689,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1052.971,1067.277,"Well, I don't... I don't follow that because it was wrongfully removed by the defendant, had no right to be in the Federal forum when he got there, and... and the poor plaintiff who wanted to be in the State court got stuck with losing a Federal court case."
2003.02-1689,0,43826,william_j_boyce,,1078.961,1085.443,--I... I would go back to Lexicon's description of Caterpillar which is that there was an--
2003.02-1689,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1085.443,1088.332,Why don't you go back to Caterpillar's description of Caterpillar?
2003.02-1689,0,43826,william_j_boyce,,1088.332,1089.241,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2003.02-1689,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1099.56,1104.761,Do you rely on a distinction between a defendant's right to a Federal forum and the plaintiff's to a Federal forum?
2003.02-1689,0,43826,william_j_boyce,,1109.591,1119.788,--I think that under certain circumstances Congress has made a distinction between a defendant's right to invoke a Federal forum and a plaintiff's right to invoke a Federal forum.
2003.02-1689,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1119.788,1125.816,Then are you... are you saying this is... is the rule you rely on a constitutional rule or a statutory rule?
2003.02-1689,0,43826,william_j_boyce,,1125.816,1131.882,It is a... primarily a statutory rule operating--
2003.02-1689,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1131.882,1136.135,"In other words, you don't say the Constitution would prohibit us from affirming."
2003.02-1689,0,43826,william_j_boyce,,1136.135,1151.201,"--I... I need to qualify my answer, Justice Stevens, because under some circumstances there may be Article III implications here because if... if it's a circumstance where you have just an issue of whether or not there's complete diversity, then that's a statutory issue."
2003.02-1689,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1169.86,1175.698,"So there's a... there's no subject jurisdiction as a matter of constitutional law, just no subject matter jurisdiction."
2003.02-1689,0,43826,william_j_boyce,,1185.713,1197.973,"I think that... and I... I cannot cite the case that... that I'm relying on for that, but in the... in the course of reviewing, I... I believe that I saw the... the statement regarding collateral attack."
2003.02-1689,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1198.528,1200.757,You are correct in that respect.
2003.02-1689,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1200.757,1201.379,"I think you're right, but I'm just wondering why."
2003.02-1689,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1201.379,1214.382,"If there... if there was... if there was an adjudication of the jurisdiction in the direct case, that's binding on the parties when the thing has become final, just as well as the merits."
2003.02-1689,0,43826,william_j_boyce,,1214.382,1226.186,--But I... I think maybe the... the primary focus here in terms of the applicability of the time of filing rule is one that... that turns on the... the purposes of the time of filing rule.
2003.02-1689,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1228.953,1230.439,May I take you back a little way?
2003.02-1689,0,43826,william_j_boyce,,1244.268,1244.807,--Correct.
2003.02-1689,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1244.807,1256.24,"When Marshall first mentions that you can't oust jurisdiction by something that happens after, he doesn't talk about the statute."
2003.02-1689,0,43826,william_j_boyce,,1270.729,1284.847,"I... I have to agree that... that both Conolly v. Taylor and Mollan v. Torrance do not specifically anchor it in the statute, and to... to some extent, I would... I would have to acknowledge that they're somewhat cryptic."
2003.02-1689,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1305.819,1306.683,What was the date of Anderson?
2003.02-1689,0,43826,william_j_boyce,,1307.676,1308.169,--1891.
2003.02-1689,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1344.661,1352.091,"As I understand the bottom line of what the situation would be, there was a trial between totally diverse parties."
2003.02-1689,0,43826,william_j_boyce,,1383.67,1392.465,"I... I would focus on one portion of Your Honor's question, which is in terms of an assumption that this case automatically would go back to Federal court."
2003.02-1689,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1394.877,1395.027,"No, no."
2003.02-1689,0,43826,william_j_boyce,,1409.349,1417.373,"--I think an underlying assumption of that question is that Atlas has not yet again changed its... its partnership, and I do not know the answer to that question."
2003.02-1689,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1417.373,1423.923,May... may I ask you is there another impediment that you do know about like the statute of limitations?
2003.02-1689,0,43826,william_j_boyce,,1423.923,1438.616,There will be an issue... the answer to your question is that... that whether or not limitations would prevent... present an obstacle to Atlas is going to be determined under the Texas savings statute and/or the New York savings statute.
2003.02-1689,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1441.3,1443.446,"Well, I assumed... I assumed you looked into this."
2003.02-1689,0,43826,william_j_boyce,,1443.446,1452.445,"And there is a... a savings statute, assuming Texas law applies, that would allow Atlas to refile suit."
2003.02-1689,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1485.427,1489.104,At what point did they file and refile?
2003.02-1689,0,43826,william_j_boyce,,1491.909,1507.347,"They filed after the trial court dismissal and before the Fifth Circuit held in their favor, and I believe that the... the second suit was filed in December of 2000 and dismissed in approximately October of 2001."
2003.02-1689,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1508.833,1511.062,Dismissed after they won on appeal or before?
2003.02-1689,0,43826,william_j_boyce,,1511.062,1514.284,I think it was before the... the Fifth Circuit ruled in the case.
2003.02-1689,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1524.77,1525.346,What is it?
2003.02-1689,0,43826,william_j_boyce,,1565.387,1578.185,"--Justice Breyer, the worst thing that can happen is uncertainty in what was formerly a bright line rule in terms of litigants being able to determine with some certainty whether or not they belong in Federal court."
2003.02-1689,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1619.135,1619.978,"Very well, Mr. Boyce."
2003.02-1689,1,39411,roger_b_greenberg,,1621.819,1634.162,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2003.02-1689,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1673.793,1685.97,"Yes, but Caterpillar involved a... a situation in which the jurisdictional defect was cured by a change in which parties were in the case."
2003.02-1689,1,39411,roger_b_greenberg,,1688.692,1689.436,--That's correct.
2003.02-1689,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1689.436,1692.658,"The party is the same, and that makes it a different case."
2003.02-1689,1,39411,roger_b_greenberg,,1695.091,1716.805,"With all due respect, Justice Scalia, our position is that Caterpillar and the thread through Caterpillar of Newman-Green and Grubbs points out that that is not an issue that was determinative of the decision."
2003.02-1689,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1740.045,1744.11,"Well, Caterpillar certainly is not a white horse case for you."
2003.02-1689,1,39411,roger_b_greenberg,,1751.812,1763.329,"--Respectfully, Chief Justice Rehnquist, our position is that the facts in this case are much narrower than Caterpillar."
2003.02-1689,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1784.506,1789.995,But there was something that you overlooked or whoever was representing Atlas.
2003.02-1689,1,39411,roger_b_greenberg,,1810.512,1832.803,"Justice Ginsburg, I don't know if the record reflects that issue, but answering your question, I don't think either party in the record adverted to that issue until the motion to dismiss was filed by Grupo Dataflux."
2003.02-1689,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1850.802,1860.667,Is it your understanding that the... that the attorney for Atlas in this case would have the obligation to advise the court of the problem the moment it was discovered?
2003.02-1689,1,39411,roger_b_greenberg,,1873.299,1876.976,"--Justice Kennedy, I believe so, yes."
2003.02-1689,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1958.543,1962.342,What... what's the latest time it can be raised in the view of the Fifth Circuit?
2003.02-1689,1,39411,roger_b_greenberg,,1962.342,1973.859,"In the... in the view of the Fifth Circuit, raised before trial... cured before trial, but not raised... but raised after is what the court's test was."
2003.02-1689,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1973.859,1978.279,"Yes, but in your time of filing rule, you... you have a very definite period."
2003.02-1689,1,39411,roger_b_greenberg,,1984.883,2001.739,"I would... would... respectfully, Chief Justice Rehnquist, I would think before trial is... is the last time it can be raised because Caterpillar says once a case has been tried."
2003.02-1689,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2038.132,2043.705,Does... does the record tell us why the partnership was changed in its composition?
2003.02-1689,1,39411,roger_b_greenberg,,2043.705,2045.069,The... the record does not.
2003.02-1689,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2077.674,2088.803,Did the same attorneys represent the partnership in... in this change of partner transaction as were representing the... Atlas in the litigation?
2003.02-1689,1,39411,roger_b_greenberg,,2088.803,2089.545,--No.
2003.02-1689,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2093.799,2098.379,Do you see any impediment?
2003.02-1689,1,39411,roger_b_greenberg,,2103.664,2103.83,Yes.
2003.02-1689,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2103.83,2105.705,--that you filed a second complaint.
2003.02-1689,1,39411,roger_b_greenberg,,2105.705,2126.881,"That is not in the record, but what occurred is when the judge dismissed this case after the jury trial, the thought process was, well, let's start anew so that whatever happens on appeal, that case will be advanced so much it would be tried right away, we thought."
2003.02-1689,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2142.302,2144.986,So you did that before you knew what the outcome was--
2003.02-1689,1,39411,roger_b_greenberg,,2144.986,2145.441,"Oh, yes."
2003.02-1689,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2151.673,2154.168,--Do you know of any impediment?
2003.02-1689,1,39411,roger_b_greenberg,,2177.391,2212.868,"Mr. Boyce is a bright lawyer and I don't know what's in his mind, but as for me, I believe there's a savings clause in the Texas statutory scheme that upon ruling by this Court, if it were not to uphold the Fifth Circuit and this case had to be refiled in district court, I... I believe that that savings clause would pertain except... except... that in the record it shows that New York law is to apply to this litigation."
2003.02-1689,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2226.515,2243.028,"Under the Fifth Circuit rule, suppose there's no diversity when the suit is filed because the plaintiff resides in the same State as one of the defendants, and then the plaintiff moves in order to create diversity."
2003.02-1689,1,39411,roger_b_greenberg,,2250.952,2252.975,--I'll answer--
2003.02-1689,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2252.975,2254.833,Then let's say this is done just before trial.
2003.02-1689,1,39411,roger_b_greenberg,,2254.833,2260.034,--And the issue then is raised after the trial?
2003.02-1689,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2260.034,2260.406,Yes.
2003.02-1689,1,39411,roger_b_greenberg,,2260.406,2268.042,"I would respectfully say this, not only do I think the Fifth Circuit rule allows that, I think Caterpillar allows that."
2003.02-1689,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2268.042,2269.407,You think which?
2003.02-1689,1,39411,roger_b_greenberg,,2269.407,2270.354,I think Caterpillar--
2003.02-1689,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2270.354,2270.893,Caterpillar.
2003.02-1689,1,39411,roger_b_greenberg,,2270.893,2274.487,"--the unanimous decision of this Court, would allow that same fact situation, but--"
2003.02-1689,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2274.487,2284.722,"It's... it's really... it's really quite different to say, look it, it's the same party here who was here at the outset of the trial, this very same person, and he's been here all through."
2003.02-1689,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2309.242,2318.985,It seems to me that that situation is just what Justice Marshall dealt with when he said you cannot oust a court of jurisdiction once lodged.
2003.02-1689,1,39411,roger_b_greenberg,,2368.685,2396.799,"--I... I noted in Caterpillar at page 11 that the Court cited the McMahan case from the Third Circuit in which there was a change in the partnership after the filing, but before the trial so as to empower the court with complete diversity and the court had the judicial power to decide the case."
2003.02-1689,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2471.723,2473.247,"Well, Grubbs... what... what... Grubbs was a removal case."
2003.02-1689,1,39411,roger_b_greenberg,,2473.247,2474.528,"Yes, that is true."
2003.02-1689,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2479.563,2480.639,I'm glad to know that.
2003.02-1689,2,43826,william_j_boyce,,3344.475,3346.599,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2003.02-1689,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3372.422,3373.044,"Well, he says it's the opposite."
2003.02-1689,2,43826,william_j_boyce,,3385.054,3391.369,"The... the rule... if... if the line is drawn there, then I... I think that raises implications of manipulation."
2003.02-1689,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3397.358,3414.365,"Only if the court says... only if the court says so because the rule, even the timely filing rule was... was something that John Marshall said and it's been that way ever since, with exceptions and recognizing that a human individual is different from a corporation is different from a partnership."
2003.02-1689,2,43826,william_j_boyce,,3426.171,3431.743,--If... there... there may be... the... the court will do what it will do.
2003.02-1689,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3439.257,3438.597,What are they?
2003.02-1689,2,43826,william_j_boyce,,3439.795,3457.173,"--And... and I submit that if the bright line rule is no longer bright, if it... if it turns on the fact of how far into the trial court proceedings before this came up, then it's... the... the time when you need certainty most, in terms of being able to decide whether or not you have jurisdiction, that's when there's going to be the least amount of clarity."
2003.02-1689,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3490.299,3490.566,No.
2003.02-1689,2,43826,william_j_boyce,,3491.785,3499.754,"But prior to the time of that curing of that defect, you have a circumstance as you had here for 3 years, for example, where you've got a Federal district court issuing summary--"
2003.02-1689,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3499.754,3502.355,And as you had in Caterpillar.
2003.02-1689,2,43826,william_j_boyce,,3502.355,3505.66,--And... and I guess the point I would make is... is this.
2003.02-1689,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3530.364,3535.193,Can you imagine a plaintiff's lawyer deliberately filing a Federal lawsuit where he knows there's no Federal jurisdiction?
2003.02-1689,2,43826,william_j_boyce,,3536.968,3542.048,"--That may not be a... a circumstance that... that is likely to happen, but--"
2003.02-1689,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3542.048,3546.422,"But you're talking about deliberate manipulation, and I just don't understand why a competent lawyer would ever do that."
2003.02-1689,2,43826,william_j_boyce,,3546.422,3560.085,--I... I think the... the greater issue is... is one of uncertainty and of having a circumstance like this case or going back as early as... as the Capron case where the case gets filed and gets tried and then the issue comes up.
2003.02-1689,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3563.346,3566.484,"Thank you, Mr. Boyce."
