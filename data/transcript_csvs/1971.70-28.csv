1971.70-28,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,13.047,The number 28 United States against Edna Generes and Allen Generes.
1971.70-28,0,36970,matthew_j_zinn,,18.532,21.888,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the court.
1971.70-28,1,36418,max_nathan_jr,,1449.042,1452.77,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1971.70-28,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1504.182,1507.344,"Where do we find that in the record, I would like to see the scope."
1971.70-28,1,36418,max_nathan_jr,,1507.344,1512.597,"That is in the Pretrial Order, Your Honor, in the Pretrial Order that is issued."
1971.70-28,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1512.597,1513.906,Can you give me the page?
1971.70-28,1,36418,max_nathan_jr,,1513.906,1514.745,I do not recall it right now.
1971.70-28,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1514.745,1528.58,It will not take any of your time.
1971.70-28,1,36418,max_nathan_jr,,1528.58,1534.018,We have also agreed that it was stipulated with this that the taxpayer may have more than one trade or business.
1971.70-28,2,36970,matthew_j_zinn,,3195.755,3197.877,Thank you Mr. Chief Justice.
1971.70-28,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3347.804,3360.634,Would you agree with Mr. Zinn that if Congress had put the word 'primarily' before the words 'in connection with' the whole task would be a big deal simplifying --
1971.70-28,2,36970,matthew_j_zinn,,3360.634,3367.38,I do not think we would be here Mr. Chief Justice but I think if they had put the word significantly and we would not be here either.
1971.70-28,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3368.495,3372.811,"They have used this term 'primarily' in many, many other contexts?"
1971.70-28,2,36970,matthew_j_zinn,,3372.811,3398.231,"Yes, they have but under one Section 165(c) 2 which appears on page 35 of our brief, it is referred to there as whether a loss is incurred in the transaction entered into the profit and the very same Second Circuit which held adversely to the government in Waddell has held that if loss incurred in a transaction entered into for profit, you have to look at the primary motivation of the taxpayer."
1971.70-28,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3486.898,3503.02,"Can I ask you, it is accepted on both sides that a loss form a debt incurred just to protect an investment isn't a business debt, isn't a business loan?"
1971.70-28,2,36970,matthew_j_zinn,,3503.02,3504.06,We of course agree with that.
1971.70-28,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3504.641,3510.209,"I know, but that is a --"
1971.70-28,2,36970,matthew_j_zinn,,3510.209,3515.782,We agreed Mr. Justice White that the Trent case was correctly decided.
1971.70-28,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3531.632,3541.32,And a loss of a kind that I was asking you about wouldn't be a deductible loss?
1971.70-28,2,36970,matthew_j_zinn,,3545.201,3550.642,It is deductible as a capital loss but not as an ordinary loss.
1971.70-28,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3550.642,3553.408,It is not a transaction entered in to the profit.
1971.70-28,2,36970,matthew_j_zinn,,3553.408,3559.0,"That is right, but it is a transaction, are you talking about the stock investment?"
1971.70-28,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3559.0,3563.44,I am talking about 155.
1971.70-28,2,36970,matthew_j_zinn,,3563.44,3564.622,An investment loss?
1971.70-28,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3564.622,3565.641,Yes.
1971.70-28,2,36970,matthew_j_zinn,,3565.641,3566.237,It is deductible.
1971.70-28,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3566.237,3570.803,"I mean I guess, a loss from a transaction entered into for profit is deductible loss."
1971.70-28,2,36970,matthew_j_zinn,,3570.803,3571.856,"Yes, it is."
1971.70-28,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3571.856,3573.835,"But an investment, isn't such a thing."
1971.70-28,2,36970,matthew_j_zinn,,3573.835,3577.402,That is right because it is subject to the capital asset limitations.
1971.70-28,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3578.625,3580.651,"Thank you Mr. Zinn, thank you Mr. Nathan."
