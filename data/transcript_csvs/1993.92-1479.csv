1993.92-1479,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,11.808,"We'll hear argument first this morning in number 92-1479, McDermott, Inc., v. AmClyde and River Don Castings Limited."
1993.92-1479,0,16385,arden_j_lea,,13.37,19.365,"Mr. Chief Justice, Justices of this honorable Court, may it please the Court:"
1993.92-1479,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,241.263,248.767,"Mr. Lea, you... you refer to the... the rule your espousing, I believe, you're referring to as the proportionate fault rule?"
1993.92-1479,0,16385,arden_j_lea,,248.767,251.278,"--Proportionate fault rule, yes, sir, Your Honor."
1993.92-1479,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,447.512,466.444,"But what... what about, counsel, the unseemliness of, if you go with the proportionate fault way, the settling defendant determining that defendant's portion of the liability when that... that person is a nonparty to the litigation."
1993.92-1479,0,16385,arden_j_lea,,466.444,493.042,"--Your Honor, that's precisely what does not happen in the proportionate method, because, in the proportionate method that we're advocating, what happens is that the jury, in the trial of the non-settling defendant, is charged to render a verdict relating only to the percentage of fault that the defendant decides... who decides to go to trial contributed to the ultimate--"
1993.92-1479,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,493.042,504.52,"But would... wouldn't necessarily the jury have to determine if it's proportioning the fault, what is the respective fault of the settling defendant and the non-settling defendant?"
1993.92-1479,0,16385,arden_j_lea,,504.52,505.981,"--Yes, ma'am, it would."
1993.92-1479,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,549.412,552.084,"And, in any event, the statute of limitations has run."
1993.92-1479,0,16385,arden_j_lea,,552.825,557.378,"--And anything else that can be thrown into the hopper, Mr. Chief Justice."
1993.92-1479,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,557.378,559.78,"If you joined the Government you could plead sovereign immunity, too."
1993.92-1479,0,16385,arden_j_lea,,560.248,565.794,"I don't often have that benefit, Your Honor."
1993.92-1479,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,587.209,593.313,"Well, well, but Justice Ginsburg is... is correct, is she not, that each... each of the rules we're going to be discussing has certain disadvantages?"
1993.92-1479,0,16385,arden_j_lea,,615.629,617.449,"--It is, Your Honor."
1993.92-1479,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,630.158,651.791,"Is it practicable or does it ever occur that a settling defendant would say, I'll assume that I am responsible for 10 percent, and... and the... the settling plaintiff will accept that, but then they leave a... a certain amount to be deducted or added, depending on the jury's verdict, say, within the range of another $50,000?"
1993.92-1479,0,16385,arden_j_lea,,651.791,654.793,It is not that common.
1993.92-1479,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,661.839,663.031,As... as a what?
1993.92-1479,0,16385,arden_j_lea,,663.031,665.331,"A Mary Carter agreement, so named--"
1993.92-1479,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,665.331,666.022,"Yes, yes."
1993.92-1479,0,16385,arden_j_lea,,666.022,670.284,"--In my experience, that is not common."
1993.92-1479,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,685.273,699.035,"But it still is possible to enter into such an agreement, and... and thereby, by contract, reduce the concerns... what one party or both parties have about receiving too much and too little?"
1993.92-1479,0,16385,arden_j_lea,,702.785,703.436,It is.
1993.92-1479,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,705.337,716.616,"But what you're saying is whether they do that or whether they don't, they are... they're still adjusting their rights and liabilities by agreement, and nobody has to weep if they get it wrong... they're... they're both over 21?"
1993.92-1479,0,16385,arden_j_lea,,716.616,717.976,"As in any contract, Your Honor."
1993.92-1479,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,725.281,743.644,"No, it's not unfair to the... to the plaintiff or to the settling defendant, but... but is there not... and it seems to me this the problem... the non-settling defendant is hauled into court in order to pay the plaintiff, by the power of Government, more... more than the plaintiff has actually suffered."
1993.92-1479,0,16385,arden_j_lea,,780.289,782.82,"No, sir."
1993.92-1479,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,837.728,847.446,"Is this case unusual in that respect, that the settling defendant paid more than what turned out to be the proportionate share?"
1993.92-1479,0,16385,arden_j_lea,,851.877,866.017,"I would say, in my experience, that usually a plaintiff will discount in exchange for a certainty of recovery in acceptance of a settlement of a lesser amount than he would anticipate getting at trial."
1993.92-1479,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,866.017,871.18,"In that case, the plaintiff would end up short?"
1993.92-1479,0,16385,arden_j_lea,,874.173,881.407,"He would, but he would have the stability and the certainty of receiving a sum certain in exchange for gambling and going to trial--"
1993.92-1479,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,881.407,882.168,Right.
1993.92-1479,0,16385,arden_j_lea,,882.168,883.918,--Which is usually what happens in any contract.
1993.92-1479,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,883.918,884.899,Don't feel sorry for him.
1993.92-1479,0,16385,arden_j_lea,,886.342,886.95,He did.
1993.92-1479,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,886.95,890.443,It's really only... it's really only the non-settling defendant who has any cause to complain.
1993.92-1479,0,16385,arden_j_lea,,894.647,895.395,Exactly.
1993.92-1479,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,895.395,902.21,"But the non-settling defendant is still being made by the court to do more, in fact, than make the plaintiff whole."
1993.92-1479,0,16385,arden_j_lea,,915.76,919.791,"Well, only if you equate settlement dollars with judgment dollars, Your Honor, as I mentioned earlier."
1993.92-1479,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1028.915,1032.178,"Of course, your... your answer assumes there's no contribution against him."
1993.92-1479,0,16385,arden_j_lea,,1032.178,1040.583,"My answer is, under the... the proportionate method, there is no contribution, because there is no necessity there for, because the trier of fact has determ--"
1993.92-1479,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1040.583,1048.146,"No, but in the... in the... in the... the horrible example you just gave, the solution to the horrible example could be simply to allow contribution against the settling defendant."
1993.92-1479,0,16385,arden_j_lea,,1048.146,1052.34,"--It would be, but in any proceed... judicial efficiency--"
1993.92-1479,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1052.34,1053.53,I grant you that.
1993.92-1479,0,16385,arden_j_lea,,1056.322,1056.853,--You're correct.
1993.92-1479,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1060.405,1062.616,"Thank you, Mr. Lea."
1993.92-1479,1,45217,william_k_kelley,,1064.158,1075.265,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1993.92-1479,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1099.932,1105.896,"Now, Mr. Kelley, we've heard that, I believe, described as pro... pro... proportionate fault rule."
1993.92-1479,1,45217,william_k_kelley,,1108.618,1110.978,"--In substance, it is, Mr. Chief Justice."
1993.92-1479,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1114.552,1117.012,And that is as opposed to pro tanto?
1993.92-1479,1,45217,william_k_kelley,,1117.012,1117.653,Yes.
1993.92-1479,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1204.27,1211.135,"When... when you say, we cannot equate judgment and settlement dollars, what you're really saying is that the... the parties place their own value on them."
1993.92-1479,1,45217,william_k_kelley,,1219.881,1222.092,"--I... I agree with that, Justice Souter."
1993.92-1479,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1253.362,1280.88,"Mr. Kelley, what's wrong with the solution that Justice Scalia referred to earlier, that one thing they shouldn't have is that the plaintiff gets over 100 percent recovery, so that when the settlement is... turns out to be too high, that the non-settling defendant should not have to pay more than what would be enough to give the plaintiff a hundred percent of what the jury finds to be the total damages?"
1993.92-1479,1,45217,william_k_kelley,,1280.88,1292.209,"We think that argument is... is incorrect, Justice Ginsburg, because what it does is it requires the plaintiff to transfer the benefit of his good settlement bargain to the non-settling defendant."
1993.92-1479,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1318.577,1323.057,"Well, the... the basis is, if he had settled with everybody, that... that's fair enough."
1993.92-1479,1,45217,william_k_kelley,,1348.877,1350.246,"--Justice Scalia, I disagree."
1993.92-1479,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1399.42,1410.966,"Which rule would encourage more settlements, the rule that you just... that you are advocating or the rule suggested by Justice Scalia's question?"
1993.92-1479,1,45217,william_k_kelley,,1410.966,1414.228,"I... I believe, Justice O'Connor, the rule that... that we are advocating."
1993.92-1479,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1472.438,1498.626,"Is there any rule like the one that Justice Scalia suggested... and outlining... and all the briefs outlined the three different positions that courts take... and the position that you're advocating is essentially you don't look at the settlement, the settlement doesn't count, whether it's high, whether it's low, it's out of it under the... what you call the proportionate fault system... is there any variant of... of these rules?"
1993.92-1479,1,45217,william_k_kelley,,1498.626,1501.607,"There... there is a variant of the rule, which is the pro tanto rule."
1993.92-1479,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1502.699,1503.9,I mean... not the pro tanto rule.
1993.92-1479,1,45217,william_k_kelley,,1503.9,1504.899,"--Well, I... I don't--"
1993.92-1479,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1504.899,1509.244,"But a rule that says, you don't look at the settlement when it's too low, but you do when it's too high."
1993.92-1479,1,45217,william_k_kelley,,1509.244,1518.761,"--Well, a... a couple of States... Texas, I believe, and perhaps New York... have adopted systems that give the non-settling... that defendant the option of choosing which system he wants."
1993.92-1479,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1545.201,1548.443,Why is it inefficient in terms of the tort system?
1993.92-1479,1,45217,william_k_kelley,,1548.443,1557.299,"Because what it does, Justice Ginsburg, is it makes a defendant's liability payment to a plaintiff depend on a factor other than its level of care in... in the maritime marketplace."
1993.92-1479,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1582.297,1589.912,"What, you... you think... you think he is going to... when... that... that the actor, before he commits the tort, is going to predict that there's going to be a settlement of... of the other actor?"
1993.92-1479,1,45217,william_k_kelley,,1589.912,1591.994,"--No, no, no, Justice Scalia--"
1993.92-1479,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1591.994,1597.937,"I... I don't see how it has any relevance, whatever, to predictable behavior by... by people in maritime commerce."
1993.92-1479,1,45217,william_k_kelley,,1597.937,1599.439,--It... it does in the following sense.
1993.92-1479,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1641.654,1644.476,"Thank you, Mr. Kelley."
1993.92-1479,2,38991,robert_e_couhig_jr,,1646.677,1651.929,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1993.92-1479,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1798.767,1799.498,"Well, why isn't it?"
1993.92-1479,2,38991,robert_e_couhig_jr,,1817.18,1831.978,"Justice Souter, what happens in an instant like that is that the plaintiff who, up until now, had been attempting to prove fault on both A and B, at that moment, becomes the defender of... of defendant A."
1993.92-1479,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1831.978,1832.448,"Oh, that's true."
1993.92-1479,2,38991,robert_e_couhig_jr,,1836.591,1840.324,It also puts the non-settling defendant in a difficult position.
1993.92-1479,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1858.627,1860.089,"Well, I mean, is that realistic?"
1993.92-1479,2,38991,robert_e_couhig_jr,,1872.816,1894.18,"With respect, sir, I disagree to this extent: As one prepares... as in this case, two years of discovery... and you get there and you know what your case is about, and you know that you're going to defend your product, and you know the... the approach that the plaintiff is going to take, then you have control over your witnesses and you have the responsibility to get there and do it."
1993.92-1479,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1913.003,1917.847,"When you speak of allegiances, are you speaking of allegiances of witnesses to... to your cause?"
1993.92-1479,2,38991,robert_e_couhig_jr,,1917.847,1919.126,"Simple, practical matters."
1993.92-1479,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1919.126,1920.027,Like what?
1993.92-1479,2,38991,robert_e_couhig_jr,,1920.027,1924.602,Will all the witnesses be there that the defendant had heretofore thought would be there?
1993.92-1479,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1926.182,1927.384,"Yes, surely, we don't have to--"
1993.92-1479,2,38991,robert_e_couhig_jr,,1927.384,1927.915,Right.
1993.92-1479,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1927.915,1930.365,--drastically alter a basic rule in order to see that witnesses--
1993.92-1479,2,38991,robert_e_couhig_jr,,1930.365,1933.008,"And... and... and I'm not suggesting that we do so, Mr. Chief Justice."
1993.92-1479,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1936.758,1937.399,"--Well, okay."
1993.92-1479,2,38991,robert_e_couhig_jr,,1943.814,1958.142,"If, in... well, if, in fact, we were to adopt or the pro rata approach is adopted, the first and most obvious to me approach is that we get away from the... the... the idea of full compensation to the plaintiff."
1993.92-1479,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1958.142,1963.335,"No, I mean the... the... you've talked about all the practical problems that arise when the settlement is announced on the morning of trial."
1993.92-1479,2,38991,robert_e_couhig_jr,,1967.058,1973.583,"I... I think the... it's difficult to describe, but the orientation in the case changes markedly then."
1993.92-1479,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1975.043,1991.466,"But isn't... you know, isn't that one reason, counsel, while a plaintiff will often discount the value of his claim against the first settling defendant, because, A, he has less adversaries in the courtroom, and, B, he's got a little money to play with to finance the rest of the litigation, so you often will get a... a discounted settlement from the first defendant?"
1993.92-1479,2,38991,robert_e_couhig_jr,,1991.466,1992.815,"--You're exactly correct, Your Honor."
1993.92-1479,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2017.722,2018.172,No.
1993.92-1479,2,38991,robert_e_couhig_jr,,2028.94,2030.021,--He does.
1993.92-1479,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2031.24,2033.834,"So he gets the benefit of the discounted settlement, too."
1993.92-1479,2,38991,robert_e_couhig_jr,,2033.834,2053.568,"--He... he does, Your Honor, except he gets that benefit... and I don't disagree with that... but he also gets the... the unbenefit or... or it's not a benefit to the extent that perhaps at the real trial, under the real circumstances, as I believe in this instance the Court of Appeals talked about, there would have been a higher finding of fault on the non-existent defendant."
1993.92-1479,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2053.568,2054.527,Yes--
1993.92-1479,2,38991,robert_e_couhig_jr,,2054.527,2055.438,"I mean, so... so we--"
1993.92-1479,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2055.438,2057.518,--That's one of the risks of the whole pro... process.
1993.92-1479,2,38991,robert_e_couhig_jr,,2057.518,2062.414,"--But the point is, as I believe Justice Scalia accurately pointed it out, who should bear that risk?"
1993.92-1479,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2066.705,2072.331,"Well, if your policy is to encourage settlements as much as possible, what's wrong with saying a non-settling defendant should bear that risk?"
1993.92-1479,2,38991,robert_e_couhig_jr,,2072.331,2076.292,"--Well, if that was the only poss... policy, you'd be absolutely correct."
1993.92-1479,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2099.318,2101.52,"Yes, but the... the principle victim of the... not getting full recovery is the plaintiff."
1993.92-1479,2,38991,robert_e_couhig_jr,,2109.605,2114.309,"--Or he gets significantly more, and he has been rewarded for that decision."
1993.92-1479,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2119.501,2121.201,"Yes, but don't you think the settlement in this case is... is atypical?"
1993.92-1479,2,38991,robert_e_couhig_jr,,2125.375,2128.016,"--I... I don't know that to be the case, Your Honor."
1993.92-1479,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2178.42,2185.776,"Mr. Couhig, we've been told by other counsel that perhaps there were two, possible three, different rules that could govern this."
1993.92-1479,2,38991,robert_e_couhig_jr,,2190.509,2200.226,"Your Honor, in our case, it was my belief, and I think the Fifth Circuit law was to the effect that only the pro tanto rule applied."
1993.92-1479,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2213.585,2214.306,But you--
1993.92-1479,2,38991,robert_e_couhig_jr,,2214.306,2218.239,"What I have just suggested is a case for... is a... is a rule for the future; yes, Your Honor."
1993.92-1479,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2218.239,2221.873,"--Well, which has not heretofore commended itself to any other court?"
1993.92-1479,2,38991,robert_e_couhig_jr,,2221.873,2227.856,"It has, Your Honor, with respect, in Texas; that election is allowed under Texas State law."
1993.92-1479,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2247.267,2255.493,"Well, now, if you did that, then the settling defendant would never know whether that was the end of the... the line for him or not."
1993.92-1479,2,38991,robert_e_couhig_jr,,2258.035,2261.777,"--Your Honor, if I might disagree for one moment."
1993.92-1479,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2337.258,2339.649,I... I don't understand.
1993.92-1479,2,38991,robert_e_couhig_jr,,2369.131,2372.751,"Your Honor, let me suggest that there are two possible cures to that."
1993.92-1479,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2414.759,2415.86,"Mr. Couhig, when--"
1993.92-1479,2,38991,robert_e_couhig_jr,,2415.86,2416.399,--Yes.
1993.92-1479,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2416.399,2422.045,"--When does... under your system, when... when does the non-settling defendant make this election... after... after the fact?"
1993.92-1479,2,38991,robert_e_couhig_jr,,2425.457,2426.147,Absolutely not.
1993.92-1479,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2426.147,2427.659,"Oh, he makes it at the outset of the trial?"
1993.92-1479,2,38991,robert_e_couhig_jr,,2427.659,2430.901,He makes it as soon as practical after the announcement.
1993.92-1479,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2434.371,2435.853,"This is very sportsmanlike, it really is."
1993.92-1479,2,38991,robert_e_couhig_jr,,2436.404,2440.015,"--Well, there is no easy answer to this."
1993.92-1479,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2473.878,2477.19,Does the defendant exercising the option always know the amount of the settlement?
1993.92-1479,2,38991,robert_e_couhig_jr,,2477.19,2478.61,He should.
1993.92-1479,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2484.196,2488.447,"Of course, they... they can white that out in the settlement agreement, too."
1993.92-1479,2,38991,robert_e_couhig_jr,,2499.744,2501.086,One... one--
1993.92-1479,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2501.086,2506.239,"So we're chasing our own tail in all of this, aren't we, if... if we're trying to guarantee no more than 100 percent recovery?"
1993.92-1479,2,38991,robert_e_couhig_jr,,2508.761,2512.613,"--the parties, Justice Scalia, can contract in many different ways."
1993.92-1479,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2537.471,2552.3,"Do I understand your system, the one... the election system, the non-settling defendant elects between proportionate fault and pro tanto... that that would wipe out any suggestion of a right of contribution?"
1993.92-1479,2,38991,robert_e_couhig_jr,,2552.3,2553.59,"Yes, ma'am."
1993.92-1479,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2581.6,2584.631,"Would... would you identify them and us, because there's so many parties here?"
1993.92-1479,2,38991,robert_e_couhig_jr,,2584.631,2585.262,"--Yes, sir."
1993.92-1479,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2602.473,2607.586,"Is it correct, just so I get the figure, that if there had been no settlement at all, it would have paid 798,000?"
1993.92-1479,2,38991,robert_e_couhig_jr,,2607.586,2611.65,"--I don't believe, Justice Stevens, we can say that."
1993.92-1479,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2616.202,2622.827,"If... if the various factors that affect the judgment are just taken out of the picture, that... that's the figure they would have paid?"
1993.92-1479,2,38991,robert_e_couhig_jr,,2622.827,2625.768,--If there was a holding of 38 percent--
1993.92-1479,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2625.768,2626.499,Yes.
1993.92-1479,2,38991,robert_e_couhig_jr,,2626.499,2634.374,"--responsibility and a $2.1 million judgment, and if only McDermott was held to be 30 percent responsible, yes, sir."
1993.92-1479,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2634.374,2648.252,"But it's... it's correct to say that if... if your case is decided on the pro rata method, your client cannot be required to pay more than your client's share of the proportionate fault?"
1993.92-1479,2,38991,robert_e_couhig_jr,,2659.932,2667.034,"Justice Souter, in this case I don't believe that the record reflects enough to... to make that decision."
1993.92-1479,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2676.501,2677.753,But that's... that's... that's a separate problem.
1993.92-1479,2,38991,robert_e_couhig_jr,,2681.354,2682.135,--Yes.
1993.92-1479,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2682.135,2686.708,"--it doesn't go to the... to the question of whether... the... the broad question, whether... whether we should choose pro rata or... or pro tanto?"
1993.92-1479,2,38991,robert_e_couhig_jr,,2686.708,2691.002,"If... if you take our case out of it, I agree with you, yes, sir... that--"
1993.92-1479,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2691.002,2695.516,And... and that particular point that you raise is not what we've... what we've taken cert on?
1993.92-1479,2,38991,robert_e_couhig_jr,,2695.516,2696.496,"--Yes, sir."
1993.92-1479,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2713.685,2714.837,"Well, I grant... I grant you that."
1993.92-1479,2,38991,robert_e_couhig_jr,,2735.952,2736.613,--That is correct.
1993.92-1479,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2736.613,2737.492,Okay.
1993.92-1479,2,38991,robert_e_couhig_jr,,2737.492,2742.637,"If one pretermits the arguments about how the trial would take place and... and the things that we've been through before, yes, sir."
1993.92-1479,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2742.637,2745.939,"Counsel, by pro rata, you mean proportionate?"
1993.92-1479,2,38991,robert_e_couhig_jr,,2745.939,2746.77,"Proportionate, yes, ma'am."
1993.92-1479,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2792.381,2803.008,"But if you carry that argument to extremes, you say any... any defendant who pays too much in a settlement ought to be able to challenge the settlement afterwards, because the point of the lawsuit was simply to make the plaintiff whole."
1993.92-1479,2,38991,robert_e_couhig_jr,,2811.075,2815.227,"As to those two parties, it makes no difference."
1993.92-1479,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2818.199,2831.428,"Which is simply... which is simply to say that a total recovery which does not go above damages is not an absolute requirement of the system under... under... under anybody's view, including yours?"
1993.92-1479,2,38991,robert_e_couhig_jr,,2865.208,2870.213,"--Well, let... let me, Justice Souter, try this as a... by way of explanation."
1993.92-1479,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2883.303,2888.348,"The settling defendant would be firing his lawyer, I presume, and bringing a lawsuit."
1993.92-1479,2,38991,robert_e_couhig_jr,,2892.192,2893.534,"Well, those things happen."
1993.92-1479,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2919.6,2945.277,"Mr. Couhig, I... I think your response to Justice Souter is that it's one thing to let somebody who, by private agreement, has gotten more money than he's entitled to, which money has been voluntarily given to him by the other person to let him skip off with it... that's one thing... it's another thing to use the power and majesty of the State to wring from somebody, who... who was not a party to that voluntary agreement, more money than the other person deserves."
1993.92-1479,2,38991,robert_e_couhig_jr,,2961.718,2963.769,"Exactly correct, Justice--"
1993.92-1479,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2963.769,2976.408,And... and isn't the problem with that answer that there is no excess as between the non-settling defendant and the plaintiff; the non-settling defendant is paying just what the non-settling defendant has caused for harm?
1993.92-1479,2,38991,robert_e_couhig_jr,,2976.408,2983.023,"--Justice Souter, at that point, the plaintiff is no... has been compensated for his injury."
1993.92-1479,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2999.895,3000.956,"Look, I'll... I'll grant you that."
1993.92-1479,2,38991,robert_e_couhig_jr,,3050.458,3055.073,"You are correct, sir, with... with this one caveat."
1993.92-1479,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3080.518,3081.049,Sure.
1993.92-1479,2,38991,robert_e_couhig_jr,,3083.49,3090.225,--So that there... I don't think it... it... the... there's no real savings in terms of time.
1993.92-1479,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3093.597,3094.008,No.
1993.92-1479,2,38991,robert_e_couhig_jr,,3094.449,3094.939,--claim.
1993.92-1479,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3094.939,3101.665,"--With respect, my... my... my suggestion is there is a savings of a... a hearing on the collateral issue, either a contribution issue or a... or a good faith settlement issue."
1993.92-1479,2,38991,robert_e_couhig_jr,,3141.399,3145.283,"And I see the Court's... your point, sir."
1993.92-1479,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3152.198,3160.332,"Mr. Couhig, why... why do we... I... I guess I don't understand your... your... the King Solomon approach that you've offered us here."
1993.92-1479,2,38991,robert_e_couhig_jr,,3168.477,3169.198,That's correct.
1993.92-1479,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3169.198,3170.168,There isn't any good faith hearing.
1993.92-1479,2,38991,robert_e_couhig_jr,,3170.168,3171.179,There's no good faith hearing.
1993.92-1479,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3171.179,3171.93,And that... that's the advantage of that.
1993.92-1479,2,38991,robert_e_couhig_jr,,3174.502,3175.513,That's correct.
1993.92-1479,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3175.513,3190.564,"But even in your suggestion... the same amount of trial... when you put in the case against the settling defendant, to... to enlarge that percent... his percentage of liability, one of the advantages is the settling defendant won't care, so he won't resist that case."
1993.92-1479,2,38991,robert_e_couhig_jr,,3196.296,3206.364,"That's... it sounds so, sir, except that, at that point, the plaintiff, just as he does now under a pro rata system, if we were to try it under... steps forward and, in effect, defends him."
1993.92-1479,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3210.577,3215.2,"Another complication, it seems to me, is that some of these settlements are not just simply for dollars."
1993.92-1479,2,38991,robert_e_couhig_jr,,3222.747,3223.345,"Yes, sir."
1993.92-1479,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3223.345,3224.837,Which makes it kind of hard to measure the dollars sometimes.
1993.92-1479,2,38991,robert_e_couhig_jr,,3224.837,3233.703,"There... there are difficulties with measurement, but I think those can be overcome through... through the use of either experts or in-house people, and they can be quantified, sir."
1993.92-1479,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3233.703,3244.26,I... I'm not sure how to evaluate your argument that an in... insolvency would skew the symmetry of the scheme under the pro rata... or proportionate fault theory.
1993.92-1479,2,38991,robert_e_couhig_jr,,3259.15,3263.264,"I agree with how you've just laid out the question, sir."
1993.92-1479,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3264.645,3274.913,I had thought you said that the risks of an insolvency on the part... of a judgment-proof defendant were a reason for adopting your rule.
1993.92-1479,2,38991,robert_e_couhig_jr,,3276.275,3305.424,"--If, for example, under the pro tanto regime, the dollar-for-dollar regime, the... the court of the law's principle purpose of allowing full recovery is satisfied... because if there is an insolvent defendant, just as one can do, you... you would go against the other defendant that would not... that would have a contribution right, but without real remedy, but the plaintiff could receive his full recovery."
1993.92-1479,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3346.072,3348.305,"I think you... I think you've answered the question, Mr. Couhig."
1993.92-1479,2,38991,robert_e_couhig_jr,,3348.305,3348.926,"--Thank you, sir."
1993.92-1479,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3348.926,3351.387,"Mr. Lea, you have one minute remaining."
1993.92-1479,3,16385,arden_j_lea,,3351.387,3354.69,May it please the Court:
1993.92-1479,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3412.268,3413.61,"Thank you, Mr. Lea."
