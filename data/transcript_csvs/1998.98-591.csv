1998.98-591,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.239,"We'll hear argument next in No. 98-8... 591, Albertsons, Inc. v. Hallie Kirkingburg."
1998.98-591,0,19015,corbett_gordon,,63.172,67.105,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1998.98-591,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,148.079,153.56,Let... let me talk about what we have before us here for just a minute.
1998.98-591,0,19015,corbett_gordon,,160.766,162.288,"That's correct, Justice O'Connor."
1998.98-591,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,162.288,169.111,And only on the grounds that the respondent was not qualified for driving?
1998.98-591,0,19015,corbett_gordon,,169.111,170.003,That's correct.
1998.98-591,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,170.003,175.095,And did not ask for summary judgment on the issue of whether the respondent was disabled.
1998.98-591,0,19015,corbett_gordon,,175.095,176.066,That's correct.
1998.98-591,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,176.066,182.371,"And yet, on cert, we are to address whether he was disabled."
1998.98-591,0,19015,corbett_gordon,,182.371,190.445,That's I believe appropriately before this Court because the Ninth Circuit ruled on that question and found him to be disabled.
1998.98-591,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,190.445,201.302,How could the Ninth Circuit have... Ninth Circuit grants a summary judgment to the other side or to... grants... says that the other side should get summary judgment when they didn't ask for it and you didn't ask for it?
1998.98-591,0,19015,corbett_gordon,,201.302,202.574,That's correct.
1998.98-591,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,202.574,207.477,"Well, then isn't the obvious thing to do, we say they're wrong on that and just send it back and try it out?"
1998.98-591,0,19015,corbett_gordon,,207.477,214.942,"I think the Ninth Circuit is certainly wrong on that question, and this Court has before it other issues that came up on cert.--"
1998.98-591,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,214.942,216.082,The Ninth Circuit remanded.
1998.98-591,0,19015,corbett_gordon,,219.484,221.106,"--The Ninth... I'm sorry, Justice Ginsburg."
1998.98-591,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,221.106,225.668,--go back and... and do something more on the qualified issue.
1998.98-591,0,19015,corbett_gordon,,244.571,249.975,"That's... that's correct, and the Ninth Circuit remanded on regarded as and on the qualification issue--"
1998.98-591,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,249.975,250.646,Right.
1998.98-591,0,19015,corbett_gordon,,250.646,256.82,--and found against the company and in favor of Mr. Kirkingburg on his disability question.
1998.98-591,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,256.82,264.445,"That... that's the only one that was a judgment, not... not a question open for the district court."
1998.98-591,0,19015,corbett_gordon,,264.995,266.545,That's correct.
1998.98-591,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,266.545,274.569,"--And the... so, if we were to say the Ninth Circuit was wrong on that, then everything else should go back."
1998.98-591,0,19015,corbett_gordon,,288.65,297.116,"Well, I think we're entitled to more than that, Justice Ginsburg, because the qualification standard is the standard that was tried to the district court."
1998.98-591,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,338.663,348.628,"But... but the Ninth... the Ninth Circuit, Ms. Gordon, said that the DOT provided waivers under certain circumstances and the respondent got a waiver?"
1998.98-591,0,19015,corbett_gordon,,348.628,350.791,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice."
1998.98-591,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,378.337,381.22,And... so... and did the waiver expire or--
1998.98-591,0,19015,corbett_gordon,,381.22,391.507,"The waiver has been grandfathered in for people that got it during that period of time who kept up their reporting procedures, and the record ends, of course, at the point when discovery closed."
1998.98-591,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,392.927,402.733,--But we take this case on the basis that the respondent did obtain a waiver from DOT and a valid waiver at the time.
1998.98-591,0,19015,corbett_gordon,,404.464,413.222,"--Well, if... this case was taken on the petition for certiorari which questions the waiver as a reasonable accommodation."
1998.98-591,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,446.482,458.451,"Do you acknowledge at... at the time the employee obtained the waiver, Albertsons could have hired him to drive a truck if it had chosen to do so, relying on the waiver?"
1998.98-591,0,19015,corbett_gordon,,458.451,464.474,I agree that the waiver gave him a license to drive recognized by the Federal Government.
1998.98-591,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,464.474,479.884,"Is it your position that Albertsons has a right to set a safety standard, in effect, with the same unreviewable autonomy that the regs give a... a manufacturer the right to set production standards?"
1998.98-591,0,19015,corbett_gordon,,481.264,485.758,I think that is... that is the position under the statute itself.
1998.98-591,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,496.067,504.231,"But you don't... you don't concede that there is, in effect, any reasonableness limitation on the standards that you can set?"
1998.98-591,0,19015,corbett_gordon,,504.231,509.644,I think the reasonableness limitations are twofold on the face of the statute.
1998.98-591,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,521.202,523.182,But doesn't this just mean there's another issue for trial?
1998.98-591,0,19015,corbett_gordon,,540.393,541.114,I think--
1998.98-591,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,541.114,551.832,"So, if DOT says you're not sure, then your client thinks they're not safe, the other side thinks they are... their client is safe, and... and therefore, we have a proceeding in a court and work out who's right."
1998.98-591,0,19015,corbett_gordon,,553.542,583.182,"--Possibly that would be the answer, but I would suggest that the EEOC itself has given another defense, and that is in the Technical Assistance Manual at page 4-16, they say that if you have a Government regulation that requires an employer to have a certain standard, if the employer is following that standard, which this employer was doing at that time and continues to do, that that operates as a defense and you don't have to look at the business... the job related and business necessity test."
1998.98-591,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,583.182,596.111,"But is that... have they taken into account the very unusual situation where there is such a reg, but then the agency itself gets a subgroup of people and says, we don't really know whether it should or should not apply here?"
1998.98-591,0,19015,corbett_gordon,,596.111,597.19,Yes.
1998.98-591,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,597.42,599.952,"I mean, I would imagine the EEOC reg is silent on that point."
1998.98-591,0,19015,corbett_gordon,,599.952,604.787,"--There are a lot of regulations on the ADA that the EEOC has promulgated, but I haven't found that example--"
1998.98-591,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,604.787,605.255,Exactly.
1998.98-591,0,19015,corbett_gordon,,608.139,621.106,"--I don't think so because I think you can find, as a matter of law, that when safety is an issue and an agency has issued a mandatory safety requirement... and again, the waiver program was not deemed safe."
1998.98-591,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,637.648,638.047,Ms.--
1998.98-591,0,19015,corbett_gordon,,663.205,669.84,Certainly this Court can take care of this case as a matter of law if you go with the mandatory defense.
1998.98-591,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,678.535,679.674,That wasn't the question.
1998.98-591,0,19015,corbett_gordon,,679.674,680.194,--I'm sorry.
1998.98-591,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,680.194,682.776,Whether we can decide it as a matter of law.
1998.98-591,0,19015,corbett_gordon,,687.92,688.4,That's correct.
1998.98-591,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,688.4,693.414,Can I ask another thing about... about the status of... of this case?
1998.98-591,0,19015,corbett_gordon,,739.867,746.17,Our position on that is that it's reasonably included in the first question presented.
1998.98-591,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,746.17,747.051,In disabled per se?
1998.98-591,0,19015,corbett_gordon,,747.051,748.271,Disabled per se.
1998.98-591,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,750.584,754.655,"Yes, but what... what do the words per se mean?"
1998.98-591,0,19015,corbett_gordon,,754.655,756.497,As a matter of law.
1998.98-591,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,756.497,761.941,What do they add to the sentence whether a monocular individual is disabled under the Americans with Disabilities Act?
1998.98-591,0,19015,corbett_gordon,,761.941,763.131,That's a direct--
1998.98-591,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,763.131,765.592,Just sort of thrown in there for no reason at all.
1998.98-591,0,19015,corbett_gordon,,765.592,765.832,--No.
1998.98-591,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,771.198,775.54,"But doesn't per se mean disabled, not regarded as disabled, but disabled?"
1998.98-591,0,19015,corbett_gordon,,791.671,792.51,Actually--
1998.98-591,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,792.51,794.302,On... on that issue I mean.
1998.98-591,0,19015,corbett_gordon,,798.985,800.066,--That's exactly right.
1998.98-591,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,803.84,814.266,"But it's... it's no use deciding in... in your petition... to take the questions in your petition, it's no use deciding 1a in your favor unless we're also prepared to decide 1b in your favor."
1998.98-591,0,19015,corbett_gordon,,818.359,821.351,"You could say every little bit helps, and--"
1998.98-591,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,821.351,822.35,Of the brief.
1998.98-591,0,19015,corbett_gordon,,823.371,829.657,--The qualified portion of our defense certainly would take care of either one of those first two questions.
1998.98-591,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,829.657,838.531,"Is... is it right, if I... just to understand it, the term disability in the statute is defined in terms of three prongs."
1998.98-591,0,19015,corbett_gordon,,841.864,842.605,That's correct.
1998.98-591,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,842.605,853.571,"--And so, what your question raised is whether the Ninth Circuit is correct in saying that your client... that their client was disabled under either A or C.--"
1998.98-591,0,19015,corbett_gordon,,853.571,854.372,That's right.
1998.98-591,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,854.372,860.186,"--So, you say you raised it and weren't particularly specific as to which prong you were pointing to in the question."
1998.98-591,0,19015,corbett_gordon,,860.186,860.947,That's right.
1998.98-591,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,866.571,869.192,Did the Ninth Circuit use per se in reference to one prong but not the other?
1998.98-591,0,19015,corbett_gordon,,869.192,873.855,--The Ninth Circuit made a per se decision in terms of prong one.
1998.98-591,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,879.19,882.9,"Well, per se is a rather... you mean as a matter of law?"
1998.98-591,0,19015,corbett_gordon,,882.9,883.352,--Yes.
1998.98-591,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,985.838,989.951,Why isn't the company regarding him as disabled?
1998.98-591,0,19015,corbett_gordon,,989.951,993.714,The company isn't regarding him as disabled for two reasons.
1998.98-591,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1008.843,1014.016,What was the pay differential on the job that they did... that they did say he could have?
1998.98-591,0,19015,corbett_gordon,,1014.016,1018.979,--They offered him the tire mechanic job and the pay differential was a little more than a dollar an hour.
1998.98-591,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1036.481,1041.506,That was driver in terms of the driver in the yard as opposed to the driver on the highway?
1998.98-591,0,19015,corbett_gordon,,1041.506,1042.605,That's any driver.
1998.98-591,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1042.605,1043.175,Any driver?
1998.98-591,0,19015,corbett_gordon,,1043.175,1043.877,Yes.
1998.98-591,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1073.386,1081.622,Don't you think truck driver is one category of... I just don't... I just don't know how to... how to do the regarded as thing.
1998.98-591,0,19015,corbett_gordon,,1092.078,1092.807,Tire mechanic?
1998.98-591,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1092.807,1094.269,That--
1998.98-591,0,19015,corbett_gordon,,1094.269,1096.29,I think it would be a tougher--
1998.98-591,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1096.29,1096.62,--What's the criterion?
1998.98-591,0,19015,corbett_gordon,,1118.075,1121.438,"--I'm not sure that that isn't correct, Justice Scalia."
1998.98-591,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1138.468,1142.209,"No, but the category can't be as broad as working, can it?"
1998.98-591,0,19015,corbett_gordon,,1142.209,1144.913,"Well, there are subcategories within working."
1998.98-591,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1149.275,1149.876,Yes.
1998.98-591,0,19015,corbett_gordon,,1163.204,1179.945,"I would suggest that with reference to driving as a subcategory of the major life activity of working, that it may be helpful to look at all driving, someone who can't do leisure driving, someone who can't drive at all, so would be completely unemployable in any category of driving."
1998.98-591,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1189.232,1200.779,"Under the Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act, determinations are made as to what work is available in the economy for the particular individual."
1998.98-591,0,19015,corbett_gordon,,1204.34,1204.831,The--
1998.98-591,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1204.831,1207.482,It doesn't seem to me to quite fit with its language.
1998.98-591,0,19015,corbett_gordon,,1207.482,1215.489,"--The EEOC would suggest I think that that is too broad if you look at the entire national economy, and I can't say that I would disagree with that."
1998.98-591,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1230.239,1232.339,"Well, how are we supposed to work it out?"
1998.98-591,0,19015,corbett_gordon,,1253.403,1268.713,"Well, the median seems to... as it percolates up through the courts in regards to driving and in regard to working as a major life activity, most of the courts that have examined it are looking at it more broadly than simply saying driving in one job category."
1998.98-591,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1268.713,1275.226,Are they doing it as a matter of law or are they... are they doing it as a matter of reviewing reasonable jury discretion?
1998.98-591,0,19015,corbett_gordon,,1275.226,1276.598,They're doing it as a matter of law.
1998.98-591,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1276.598,1286.646,"Well, the EEOC has, at least, offered an interpretive guideline I assume or a regulation on the subject."
1998.98-591,0,19015,corbett_gordon,,1286.646,1287.084,Yes.
1998.98-591,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1287.084,1297.201,"And it says, the inability to perform a single, particular job does not constitute a substantial limitation in the major life activity of working."
1998.98-591,0,19015,corbett_gordon,,1303.255,1319.586,"My answer to seeing, Justice O'Connor, is that I think this record is clear that this employer didn't perceive this individual as unable to see or substantially restricted in seeing because the other jobs offered him required someone can see."
1998.98-591,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1319.586,1323.949,"But you do say that this was a single, particular job."
1998.98-591,0,19015,corbett_gordon,,1323.949,1331.773,"I do say that the job of truck driver for this company is a single, particular job, and there are lots of other kinds, van driving--"
1998.98-591,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1331.773,1340.019,"And therefore, you don't get to the is he qualified question, in effect."
1998.98-591,0,19015,corbett_gordon,,1340.019,1345.714,--You don't get... you don't get to the is he qualified question if he's found not to be disabled and not to be perceived as disabled.
1998.98-591,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1348.385,1352.877,"Of course, all of these cases involve a single, particular job."
1998.98-591,0,19015,corbett_gordon,,1372.122,1378.723,"Well, clearly in this case, this employer perceived him as able to work in other positions for this employer, so it didn't perceive him--"
1998.98-591,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1378.723,1382.507,"And you'd say that's the criterion, so long as that employer will give him another job."
1998.98-591,0,19015,corbett_gordon,,1383.708,1386.38,"--Well, that's one of the criteria."
1998.98-591,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1386.38,1386.981,Wow.
1998.98-591,0,19015,corbett_gordon,,1386.981,1394.304,"And another is to look at whether this person is employable in that geographic area, which is one of the things the EEOC directs us to look at."

1998.98-591,0,19015,corbett_gordon,,1421.712,1423.044,But--
1998.98-591,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1423.044,1424.775,--even though he can do a lot of other surgery.

1998.98-591,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1429.219,1432.491,The left nostril from... from the time he went to medical school.

1998.98-591,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1443.167,1453.353,"But you acknowledge that the regarded as decision requires you to look at the individual, not... it's not the same test for everybody."
1998.98-591,0,19015,corbett_gordon,,1462.208,1473.728,I think the correct analysis is to look at the mental status of the employer and whether... and what the perception of the employer was when you're looking at the regarded as prong.
1998.98-591,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1475.929,1478.851,It's a purely subjective test.
1998.98-591,0,19015,corbett_gordon,,1478.851,1486.425,"A subjective test based on the evidence in the record as to what that employer was doing or thinking, yes."
1998.98-591,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1486.425,1495.861,"What do you make of the regs that... that speak of... of regarding in terms of treating, i.e., it seems to be a functional objective test?"
1998.98-591,0,19015,corbett_gordon,,1502.165,1508.961,"Well, not... I don't believe entirely because how you treat someone is indicative of how you're thinking about the person."
1998.98-591,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1508.961,1517.766,"It is but you may also... I mean, you may also apply a treatment test as a purely functional objective test."
1998.98-591,0,19015,corbett_gordon,,1517.766,1524.91,They treated him as if he were substantially limited in a major life activity.

1998.98-591,0,19015,corbett_gordon,,1525.41,1525.991,Therefore--

1998.98-591,0,19015,corbett_gordon,,1530.045,1535.468,--I think it has to come back to intent because the... because of the use of the word regarded in the statute.
1998.98-591,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1535.468,1538.549,"Well, why mustn't it then go back to the district court?"

1998.98-591,0,19015,corbett_gordon,,1603.793,1613.598,I think the... the statement is better understood as simply defining the... the impairment that this individual has.
1998.98-591,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1615.889,1619.301,What does it mean to be legally blind in one eye?

1998.98-591,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1627.576,1631.62,"Well, but who says the person is legally blind?"
1998.98-591,0,19015,corbett_gordon,,1640.156,1642.457,I haven't found it articulated and I--
1998.98-591,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1642.457,1648.661,Then why do you use the term legally... or perhaps why does your employer... why does your client use the term legally blind?
1998.98-591,0,19015,corbett_gordon,,1648.661,1651.803,"--In various materials, that is the term that's applied."
1998.98-591,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1651.803,1653.115,"Well, what materials?"
1998.98-591,0,19015,corbett_gordon,,1653.115,1654.645,Secondary studies.
1998.98-591,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1668.953,1670.044,You can't--
1998.98-591,0,19015,corbett_gordon,,1676.56,1678.721,I... I agree it is.
1998.98-591,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1678.721,1682.854,"So, is it driving statutes or benefit statutes?"
1998.98-591,0,19015,corbett_gordon,,1682.854,1688.678,"I think it may be the benefits and the tax statutes, but I... I can't cite you to one particularly at this time."

1998.98-591,0,19015,corbett_gordon,,1694.002,1694.593,"Yes, thank you."
1998.98-591,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1694.593,1696.322,Mr. Hunt.

1998.98-591,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1759.634,1760.613,Let me ask this.
1998.98-591,1,41488,scott_n_hunt,,1772.441,1775.293,"--Putting aside the waiver program, yes."
1998.98-591,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1775.293,1775.483,Yes.
1998.98-591,1,41488,scott_n_hunt,,1788.573,1792.546,"Well, to begin with, it wasn't ultimately set aside."
1998.98-591,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1830.86,1832.38,"So... so, it did."
1998.98-591,1,41488,scott_n_hunt,,1842.148,1859.41,"The way it occurred was when he came back from an extended period of time off, he did not pass the DOT certification exam, was informed by the examining doctor that he needed to obtain a waiver."
1998.98-591,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1868.985,1869.944,Who had given him the waiver?
1998.98-591,1,41488,scott_n_hunt,,1871.156,1874.69,"DOT, through the Federal Highway Administration."
1998.98-591,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1874.69,1875.508,"So, he went to the employer."
1998.98-591,1,41488,scott_n_hunt,,1882.344,1882.994,No.
1998.98-591,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1893.052,1894.752,But then did he ultimately get a waiver?
1998.98-591,1,41488,scott_n_hunt,,1894.752,1895.484,"Yes, he did."
1998.98-591,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1895.484,1896.142,All right.
1998.98-591,1,41488,scott_n_hunt,,1921.6,1927.133,I'm not... I'm not certain that it would be an absolute defense.
1998.98-591,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1931.177,1943.913,"Well, this... would this be a legitimate concern of the company, tort liability for hiring a driver who may or may not be safe, was in a category at least where the DOT was going to experiment with him for a while?"
1998.98-591,1,41488,scott_n_hunt,,1943.913,1948.787,"Well, I don't think the may or may not be safe is sufficient."
1998.98-591,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1952.689,1965.668,"Well, the tort plaintiff in the hypothetical case would... would allege that Albertsons was guilty of negligence in hiring somebody that had... had less than adequate vision because of the peripheral limitation."
1998.98-591,1,41488,scott_n_hunt,,1965.668,1981.778,"And... and I think the employer could defend on the grounds that the... the agency in charge of determining safety standards had determined that the individual who received the waiver, through an individual assessment, was safe to drive."
1998.98-591,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1981.778,1984.769,But could the employer defend the employment action?
1998.98-591,1,41488,scott_n_hunt,,1990.505,1992.276,No.
1998.98-591,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1992.276,1996.747,I don't... we don't want to hire the driver and take the chance of having to defend him in... in court.
1998.98-591,1,41488,scott_n_hunt,,1996.747,2019.234,"I believe that that needs to be... when they are asserting that sort of safety threat defense under the ADA, under the statutory language, they must... and under the terms... this Court's ruling last term, they need to rely on objective evidence, objective scientific evidence to justify that safety risk."
1998.98-591,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2019.234,2030.21,"Well, what if they've got objective scientific evidence that shows just what Justice Kennedy's hypothetical assumed, and that is that, in fact, there is a... a lack of a certain percentage of peripheral vision?"
1998.98-591,1,41488,scott_n_hunt,,2073.268,2083.304,I believe in that case it would... they would meet the necessity of supplying objective evidence to justify their direct threat defense.
1998.98-591,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2093.641,2100.046,"So, their... their failure in your view was simply that they... they were too blunt about going about what they... they were doing."
1998.98-591,1,41488,scott_n_hunt,,2109.171,2121.89,"Well, I think the company would have to provide evidence that they had considered that objective evidence that Your Honor refers to at the time that it refused to accept the waiver."
1998.98-591,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2135.631,2147.095,"You mean if... if new objective evidence were discovered as a result of independent scientific inquiry between the beginning of the action and the time they put in the defense, they could not put in the defense?"
1998.98-591,1,41488,scott_n_hunt,,2147.095,2151.68,"If... if new... if it's additional information, I believe they could."
1998.98-591,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2177.639,2178.58,Why is... why is your answer what it is?
1998.98-591,1,41488,scott_n_hunt,,2190.407,2199.201,"I believe it would come under the... the sense of after acquired evidence, that sort of analogy, that you can't rely upon--"
1998.98-591,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2199.201,2200.393,"Well, is there anything in the statute?"
1998.98-591,1,41488,scott_n_hunt,,2200.393,2208.798,--I can't think of anything in the statute that would prevent them from adding that evidence.
1998.98-591,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2208.798,2210.411,"Mr. Gordon, you--"
1998.98-591,1,41488,scott_n_hunt,,2210.411,2211.44,It's Mr.--
1998.98-591,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2211.44,2212.061,--Hunt.
1998.98-591,1,41488,scott_n_hunt,,2223.137,2224.088,--Correct.
1998.98-591,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2224.088,2243.711,"I... I worry about... about the... the proposition that the regarded as provision can eat the statute, can essentially transform it into a statute that outlaws all unreasonable employment decisions."
1998.98-591,1,41488,scott_n_hunt,,2277.493,2285.689,"To be honest with you, I have trouble following all the details of that question... of that hypothetical."
1998.98-591,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2285.689,2323.653,"I am worried about the fact that whenever an employer establishes a physical characteristic for the job, which turns out to be an unreasonable one and therefore would not qualify for the... for the bona fide qualification defense under this statute, whenever that's the case... it's an unreasonable qualification... the person turned down for employment would be able to say, you used a physical characteristic that was not proper, and therefore, you were regarding me as disabled, and therefore, you are liable to me."
1998.98-591,1,41488,scott_n_hunt,,2364.669,2377.458,I... I believe this case presents that... that situation where they regard him as legally blind even though he's not legally blind.
1998.98-591,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2384.413,2388.274,Is there any case where that... where it wouldn't work out that way?
1998.98-591,1,41488,scott_n_hunt,,2422.348,2425.6,I... I--
1998.98-591,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2425.6,2427.691,--on regarded as?
1998.98-591,1,41488,scott_n_hunt,,2427.691,2433.706,"--I think the... I think the... excuse me, Your Honor."
1998.98-591,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2438.758,2440.501,"Well, the Ted Williams example would be--"
1998.98-591,1,41488,scott_n_hunt,,2478.585,2485.988,"--I believe it does because in addition to the blind in one eye perception, there is the legally blind perception."
1998.98-591,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2495.445,2505.362,But... but if... but if he's not under... prevented from a... limited in a substantial life activity.
1998.98-591,1,41488,scott_n_hunt,,2505.362,2506.972,--He would still have to be.
1998.98-591,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2508.955,2510.816,Then... then I don't see how the regarded prong helps you.
1998.98-591,1,41488,scott_n_hunt,,2520.873,2522.254,"--Well, I think--"
1998.98-591,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2522.254,2523.604,"You tell me if I'm... I'm wrong, please."
1998.98-591,1,41488,scott_n_hunt,,2523.604,2543.897,"--Well, I think legally blind, although there is a question as to what exactly legally blind means, but I think the perception of someone being legally blind and then treating that person by... by eliminating their employment, by terminating them completely from employment is a substantial limitation."
1998.98-591,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2556.026,2560.207,"Well, then, why don't you qualify under the basic definition of disability?"
1998.98-591,1,41488,scott_n_hunt,,2561.75,2571.035,There's... there's a potential difference in monocular vision versus legally blind.
1998.98-591,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2604.105,2610.6,"Is... is... can I go for one second to the other part of the case, which is the... the question of this test?"
1998.98-591,1,41488,scott_n_hunt,,2629.974,2630.485,Yes.
1998.98-591,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2630.485,2630.863,All right.
1998.98-591,1,41488,scott_n_hunt,,2662.926,2675.663,"First of all, it's not an experimental... the waiver program is not experimental as to the safety of the individuals who are assessed by the Federal Highway Administration and granted a vision waiver."
1998.98-591,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2731.138,2735.472,"Well, then the experimental program becomes... becomes a mandatory program."
1998.98-591,1,41488,scott_n_hunt,,2744.408,2752.103,"Again, it was not meant to be an experiment as to the... allowing those particular drivers to drive."
1998.98-591,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2752.103,2754.266,"I know, but it was meant not to apply to all drivers."
1998.98-591,1,41488,scott_n_hunt,,2765.152,2765.623,"No, and--"
1998.98-591,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2765.623,2768.935,Maybe we should have an experimental program for people who don't get waivers.
1998.98-591,1,41488,scott_n_hunt,,2776.819,2784.173,"--Indeed, the standards, Justice Ginsburg, to get into the program were stricter than it was to drive in general."
1998.98-591,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2784.173,2789.679,"So, a lot of people who drive a lot and get a ticket every now and then wouldn't qualify for it."
1998.98-591,1,41488,scott_n_hunt,,2789.679,2799.875,"There was a requirement of 3 years of safe driving with no suspensions, no revocations, no disqualifying traffic violations."
1998.98-591,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2810.96,2818.838,"Mr. Hunt, before you finish, with all that's unclear about this case, there's one I think that we could at least focus on and say it's wrong or right."
1998.98-591,1,41488,scott_n_hunt,,2831.454,2837.268,I think the... I think that statement by the Ninth Circuit needs to be read in context of the entire paragraph.
1998.98-591,2,22157,edward_c_dumont,,2917.841,2934.882,"Well, I would say that with respect to this case, Your Honor, the best way out of that problem for this case is to say that what happened here was that the employer clearly viewed respondent as substantially limited in the life activity of seeing."
1998.98-591,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2956.617,2956.907,Wait.
1998.98-591,2,22157,edward_c_dumont,,2976.648,2977.55,"--Well, and I think--"
1998.98-591,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2977.55,2980.392,Why is that... what is there that's absurd about that?
1998.98-591,2,22157,edward_c_dumont,,2981.093,3006.79,"--I think within some limits imposed by the word substantially, that's the right analysis; that if a company is going to take an employment action based on... based on... admittedly based on a physical limitation that goes to one of your major life activities... in this case it's seeing... then they are in a poor position to turn around and say that, nonetheless, your vision is so good that you are not even substantially limited enough to be within the coverage of the act."
1998.98-591,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3006.79,3014.493,It depends on how broad you think the category of disqualification has to be in order to render you substantially impaired.

1998.98-591,2,22157,edward_c_dumont,,3120.006,3123.579,"--I think the two are very closely related, and let me address that point this way."
1998.98-591,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3144.22,3152.638,"Except there's a defense if a Government agency requires a certain standard, as the DOT did here for vision for drivers."
1998.98-591,2,22157,edward_c_dumont,,3152.638,3153.397,There's that defense--
1998.98-591,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3153.397,3158.121,"You have to get a license, and there's a defense if the person doesn't have that license."
1998.98-591,2,22157,edward_c_dumont,,3158.732,3158.98,--Absolutely.
1998.98-591,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3185.567,3188.869,But this statute... this statute wasn't meant to apply to all Americans.
1998.98-591,2,22157,edward_c_dumont,,3225.104,3225.845,"--Yes, absolutely."
1998.98-591,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3225.845,3226.116,Okay.
1998.98-591,2,22157,edward_c_dumont,,3226.897,3227.364,Blue eyes.
1998.98-591,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3227.364,3229.508,Blue eyes.
1998.98-591,2,22157,edward_c_dumont,,3229.508,3231.388,"Blue eyes, which is not an impairment."
1998.98-591,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3234.601,3234.771,Blue eyes.
1998.98-591,2,22157,edward_c_dumont,,3238.902,3239.703,"--Right, which--"
1998.98-591,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3239.703,3243.266,"And, therefore, it's a... it's a job qualification and--"
1998.98-591,2,22157,edward_c_dumont,,3243.266,3243.947,--That's right.
1998.98-591,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3243.947,3248.47,"--But you say under your theory, I would not be regarding you as disabled because you have blue eyes."
1998.98-591,2,22157,edward_c_dumont,,3248.47,3251.611,Because it's not an impairment which the statute requires.
1998.98-591,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3253.414,3253.482,"Well, wait, wait."
1998.98-591,2,22157,edward_c_dumont,,3258.087,3264.761,"No, because we look to the language of the statute and some language... some language is open to interpretation and, in fact, requires interpretation like substantially limit."
1998.98-591,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3274.057,3274.275,An occasional headache.
1998.98-591,2,22157,edward_c_dumont,,3274.275,3274.956,Here's another example.
1998.98-591,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3288.016,3288.377,--is right.
1998.98-591,2,22157,edward_c_dumont,,3288.377,3293.78,"That person is impaired, but it would be unreasonable I think for any employer to base a job qualification on that--"
1998.98-591,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3293.78,3294.969,Be a little more realistic.
1998.98-591,2,22157,edward_c_dumont,,3314.486,3320.678,--I think it's a... probably not because you have--
1998.98-591,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3320.678,3321.54,Here's the example.
1998.98-591,2,22157,edward_c_dumont,,3341.724,3345.765,--I think we are and I think that's all we want is to go... all the respondent wants is to go back for trial here.
1998.98-591,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3352.49,3353.171,You say a little too broadly.
1998.98-591,2,22157,edward_c_dumont,,3358.734,3362.456,"--If it's different manner equals, but I wouldn't say it's entirely the wrong inquiry."
1998.98-591,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3415.642,3422.074,Suppose we say that under section (a) of the statute there is no substantial limitation on the life... life activity.
1998.98-591,2,22157,edward_c_dumont,,3431.821,3437.888,I certainly think it is helpful to the extent that... I would say as I said before.
1998.98-591,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3463.651,3464.612,That... that has to help.
1998.98-591,2,22157,edward_c_dumont,,3499.567,3499.978,"--Thank you, Your Honor."
1998.98-591,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3499.978,3502.399,"Ms. Gordon, you have 2 minutes remaining."
1998.98-591,3,19015,corbett_gordon,,3502.399,3504.892,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1998.98-591,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3565.962,3570.584,But how can you reconcile that with the decision to allow all existing waivers to remain in effect?
1998.98-591,3,19015,corbett_gordon,,3570.584,3572.517,I can't.
1998.98-591,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3572.517,3573.396,"Oh, okay."
1998.98-591,3,19015,corbett_gordon,,3573.396,3575.168,I can't.
1998.98-591,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3585.193,3586.575,Close enough for Government work.
1998.98-591,3,19015,corbett_gordon,,3587.206,3606.757,I would refer the Court to pages 12 to 16 of our reply brief where various criticisms are taken of the Federal Highway Administration's protocol and studies that were in effect and available to them and noted in their... in the Federal Register that they ignored.
1998.98-591,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3620.556,3621.137,"Thank you, Ms. Gordon."
