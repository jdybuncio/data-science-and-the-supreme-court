1964.292,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,21.579,"Number 292, the Atlantic Refining Company, Petitioner versus Federal Trade Commission and number 296, the Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company versus Federal Trade Commission."
1964.292,0,23601,frederic_l_ballard,,26.648,29.63,May it please the Court.
1964.292,1,29010,justice_bernnan,,318.132,332.097,"[Inaudible] of pages B68 and 69 -- Section 7, 8 and 9?"
1964.292,2,23601,frederic_l_ballard,,332.097,334.49,"Your Honor, I don't have this."
1964.292,3,29010,justice_bernnan,,360.99,363.362,Well I'm looking at the Commission's order.
1964.292,4,23601,frederic_l_ballard,,363.362,371.754,"Now in the Commission's order sir, the Commission's order against Atlantic is on page 68 and 69."
1964.292,5,29010,justice_bernnan,,380.419,381.574,-- and six.
1964.292,6,23601,frederic_l_ballard,,381.574,401.378,"-- which of course, must be read with the preamble, prevents Atlantic directly or indirectly from intimidating or coercing or attempting to intimidate or coerce any wholesaler or retailer of Atlantic Petroleum products to purchase any brand or brands of TBA products."
1964.292,7,29010,justice_bernnan,,431.046,437.559,"Well then, do I understand the issue that the Atlantic raises that it is limited then the one, two, three, and four?"
1964.292,8,23601,frederic_l_ballard,,437.559,439.392,"Precisely, Your Honor."
1964.292,8,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,439.684,444.981,"It was not -- it was not so limited in the questions presented in your petition, was it?"
1964.292,8,23601,frederic_l_ballard,,444.981,445.621,Yes it was Your Honor.
1964.292,8,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,445.621,446.148,It was.
1964.292,8,23601,frederic_l_ballard,,446.148,454.158,"Yes sir, we specifically and expressly disavowed any effort to bring to this Court paragraphs five and six."
1964.292,8,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,455.438,460.271,You are with that question under the -- under the sanction of those paragraphs --
1964.292,8,23601,frederic_l_ballard,,460.271,460.448,Yes sir.
1964.292,8,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,460.448,461.074,--right now that order?
1964.292,8,23601,frederic_l_ballard,,461.074,462.093,"Yes sir, we are."
1964.292,8,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,463.461,468.09,"And if you presume if you do any thing you're going to be entitled with the Federal Trade Commission, that's the end of that."
1964.292,8,23601,frederic_l_ballard,,468.09,471.825,"Precisely, it's the assumption that I've been going on, Your Honor."
1964.292,8,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,475.555,485.856,"-- take at the word coercion means to the Commission, do you something besides whatever it flows from what the Commission called power?"
1964.292,8,23601,frederic_l_ballard,,485.856,493.138,"Your Honor, I believe coercion means the use of the power to deprive the dealer of his freedom of choice."
1964.292,9,29010,justice_bernnan,,527.107,542.638,"Well let's see what is happening Mr. Ballard is that your dealers now, you are going to say make this kind of contract and nevertheless free to go out, as is said here in six, displaying TBA products of his own independent choice?"
1964.292,10,23601,frederic_l_ballard,,542.638,545.031,"Yes sir, yes sir."
1964.292,10,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,603.868,606.637,What did Atlantic agreed under the contract [Inaudible]
1964.292,10,23601,frederic_l_ballard,,606.637,619.001,"Atlantic agreed Your Honor, to promote the sale of Goodyear TBA through its dealers and through the dealers to the motoring public."
1964.292,10,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,745.061,761.368,"I suppose in most cases, Atlantic could take care of that by provisioning or leasing through or rather arrangement with the dealer saying that a dealer in order to continue this arrangement, you must have an adequate supply of the tires and batteries?"
1964.292,10,23601,frederic_l_ballard,,761.368,763.353,"That is precisely what they do, Your Honor."
1964.292,10,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,782.453,793.418,"But the -- as I read the Commission order, it doesn't concern itself with the proposition that Justice Goldberg mentioned?"
1964.292,10,23601,frederic_l_ballard,,793.418,796.431,"The Commission's order does not concern itself, but that is correct Your Honor."
1964.292,10,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,796.431,806.908,It concerns itself was pressure by Atlantic like threats to cancel or renew at least if he doesn't take a particular supplier's product?
1964.292,10,23601,frederic_l_ballard,,806.908,810.669,"Yes Your Honor, but my point is that that is no longer in the case."
1964.292,10,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,811.436,816.138,Well -- but you mentioned just five and six.
1964.292,10,23601,frederic_l_ballard,,820.322,830.114,"If you have read paragraph one of their order and two, and three, and four, you'll find in every case an exception."
1964.292,10,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,850.441,865.984,Well I have the commission report and its bound volume; number one is inducing or attempting to induce the purchase of TBA products of a particular supplier by Atlantic dealers by threatening to cancel.
1964.292,10,23601,frederic_l_ballard,,865.984,870.618,"Well Your Honor, I believe you have the -- I believe you'll have the examiner's --"
1964.292,10,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,870.618,871.577,Was that the examiners?
1964.292,10,23601,frederic_l_ballard,,871.577,874.207,"Yes sir, that's the examiner's."
1964.292,10,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,878.253,879.592,Well thank you very much.
1964.292,10,23601,frederic_l_ballard,,882.239,892.431,"Now to get back if I may to the argument today, we have the fact that all oil companies provide a TBA program for their dealers."
1964.292,11,29010,justice_bernnan,,894.867,906.288,"I don't want any [Inaudible] without the -- I understood you to say that in fact things like other than the Atlantic Refining Company would mean what, that Atlantic could buy all these from Goodyear --"
1964.292,12,23601,frederic_l_ballard,,906.288,906.729,"Yes, sir precisely."
1964.292,13,29010,justice_bernnan,,906.729,909.488,--directly and then market it to its dealer?
1964.292,14,23601,frederic_l_ballard,,909.488,910.18,Yes sir.
1964.292,15,29010,justice_bernnan,,910.18,912.094,But what it may not do is what?
1964.292,16,23601,frederic_l_ballard,,912.094,926.406,"What -- well this is a very good question, Your Honor, but what it may not do, what it may not do, is to have its present arrangement under which the TBA instead of coming down through a distribution --"
1964.292,17,29010,justice_bernnan,,926.406,926.569,By Atlantic?
1964.292,18,23601,frederic_l_ballard,,926.569,931.367,"-- system -- by Atlantic, goes down through a distribution system by Goodyear."
1964.292,19,29010,justice_bernnan,,931.367,936.191,For which you get a -- Atlantic get suppose some kind of overwriting?
1964.292,20,23601,frederic_l_ballard,,936.191,936.796,"That's correct, sir."
1964.292,21,29010,justice_bernnan,,936.796,937.361,Yes.
1964.292,22,23601,frederic_l_ballard,,937.361,954.284,"Now you -- Your Honor, has just articulated the two methods by which oil companies handle this TBA problem and under both these methods, they sell the TBA to the dealer and they help him sell it to the public, and they train him in its use, that's identical."
1964.292,22,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,954.284,956.596,And in both of these they recommend the --
1964.292,22,23601,frederic_l_ballard,,956.596,970.889,"Yes sir, the difference is simply how the TBA gets to the dealer, but this difference is very vital and it couldn't be better illustrated than by -- this case, the facts of this case."
1964.292,23,29010,justice_bernnan,,1058.267,1059.361,Well your precedents.
1964.292,23,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,1059.361,1060.721,Have no money at all.
1964.292,24,23601,frederic_l_ballard,,1060.721,1061.454,Sir?
1964.292,24,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,1061.454,1063.474,Your Company has no money at all.
1964.292,24,23601,frederic_l_ballard,,1063.859,1065.727,That is correct.
1964.292,24,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,1065.727,1066.285,The sale.
1964.292,24,23601,frederic_l_ballard,,1066.285,1073.406,"Well the money that we have in it, Your Honor, is our rather extensive efforts to train and help the dealer."
1964.292,25,29010,justice_bernnan,,1073.406,1075.215,Well that's what you pay that expense.
1964.292,26,23601,frederic_l_ballard,,1075.215,1077.261,We pay that expense out of our 10% yes sir.
1964.292,26,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1077.261,1080.869,And you make no money at this present system really I mean in the -- in the --
1964.292,26,23601,frederic_l_ballard,,1080.869,1082.486,"As the record shows, that's right Your Honor."
1964.292,26,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1082.486,1085.168,"Is that -- is that what commission found, that you make no money at all?"
1964.292,26,23601,frederic_l_ballard,,1085.168,1087.765,The Commission didn't dispute it.
1964.292,26,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1188.267,1192.652,Well that majors that the use the purchase resale?
1964.292,26,23601,frederic_l_ballard,,1192.652,1217.342,"The record seems to show, Your Honor, that the majors do and the -- this point is made very strongly also in the amicus brief that the smaller companies, those with smaller resources, find it more convenient in effect to leave TBA distribution which is a pretty specialized thing to the tire companies, which who are specialized in it."
1964.292,26,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,1229.903,1236.726,Suppose [Inaudible] eliminate would not go that way.
1964.292,26,23601,frederic_l_ballard,,1244.5,1245.548,Instead of a dealer --
1964.292,26,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,1245.548,1248.09,Instead of a dealer thing to charge.
1964.292,26,23601,frederic_l_ballard,,1258.945,1263.356,"Your Honor, that's a - that's a question that is suppose to be pass."
1964.292,26,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1311.128,1319.75,"Mr. Ballard, you - you referred to me a fact that there were exception in each one of the four paragraphs of the Commission quarter."
1964.292,26,23601,frederic_l_ballard,,1319.75,1320.135,Yes sir.
1964.292,26,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1320.135,1323.496,I don't quite see what you mean in this --
1964.292,26,23601,frederic_l_ballard,,1323.496,1323.816,Well I --
1964.292,26,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1323.816,1326.308,-- to be the first and other than the Atlantic Refining Company.
1964.292,26,23601,frederic_l_ballard,,1326.308,1327.45,In number two --
1964.292,26,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1327.45,1329.132,There is one to four.
1964.292,26,23601,frederic_l_ballard,,1329.132,1339.395,"In - in number two, you don't need the exception because number two, prevents us from receiving any commission for acting as sales commission."
1964.292,26,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1343.346,1344.805,The commission [Inaudible]
1964.292,26,23601,frederic_l_ballard,,1344.805,1370.164,"Now in number three, you will find it again toward the end, three is using any contractual device such as a training program, promotions, dealer meetings, service station identifications to sponsor, recommend, urge, induce or otherwise promote the sale of TBA products by any distributor or marketer other than the Atlantic Refining Company."
1964.292,26,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1370.164,1373.21,And then you find other the Atlantic Refining Company down in number four.
1964.292,26,23601,frederic_l_ballard,,1373.21,1374.159,Yes sir.
1964.292,26,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1374.159,1377.155,Is that the phrase that you meant when you called the --
1964.292,26,23601,frederic_l_ballard,,1377.155,1379.225,Yes sir.
1964.292,26,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1433.732,1438.436,If these TBA products had been purchased by your client --
1964.292,26,23601,frederic_l_ballard,,1438.436,1438.639,Yes sir.
1964.292,26,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1438.639,1440.43,-- to you and you can do all this.
1964.292,26,23601,frederic_l_ballard,,1440.43,1441.572,They do.
1964.292,26,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1442.133,1445.207,Then that's the purpose of observing that --
1964.292,26,23601,frederic_l_ballard,,1445.207,1447.532,"Yes sir that's -- I have no doubt about it, sir."
1964.292,26,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1540.925,1546.979,So how about the problem with distribution of the small tire company?
1964.292,26,23601,frederic_l_ballard,,1559.83,1562.638,"No, the truth of the matter was that they did not."
1964.292,26,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1587.433,1593.51,But do you know of any small tire companies so-called small rooms would cover your home to [Inaudible]
1964.292,26,23601,frederic_l_ballard,,1593.51,1595.617,"No, Your Honor, I do not."
1964.292,26,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1656.661,1673.675,"As I read the Commission's important state 367, they don't ask you to require you to go to any -- go back to any small company that you say that tied - tied to one forecloses the market from all others."
1964.292,26,23601,frederic_l_ballard,,1673.675,1674.361,Yes Your Honor.
1964.292,26,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1686.675,1689.454,[Inaudible] commission plan?
1964.292,26,23601,frederic_l_ballard,,1689.454,1691.506,"Yes sir, no question about it."
1964.292,27,29010,justice_bernnan,,1764.009,1776.049,[Inaudible] all of you retailers are now using those Goodyear distribution points and continue to buy to them rather than from your new [Inaudible] --
1964.292,28,23601,frederic_l_ballard,,1776.049,1794.617,"Yes sir, they can, -- under the -- that's perfectly correct, Your Honor and it's quite possible that many of the dealers who have - that if we went to -- if we went to purchase resale that many of the dealers who have established long standing relationships with those stores, will continue to buy --"
1964.292,29,29010,justice_bernnan,,1794.617,1808.933,"What I gather, if you understand this order to require, to return to the purchase resale and to establish your own distribution system with your own distribution centers, is that it?"
1964.292,30,23601,frederic_l_ballard,,1808.933,1810.866,"We believe under yes, Your Honor."
1964.292,31,29010,justice_bernnan,,1829.104,1833.554,Can you use one of the present Goodyear distribution point though?
1964.292,32,23601,frederic_l_ballard,,1833.554,1835.352,"Not the independent ones, I believe Your Honor."
1964.292,32,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1838.227,1839.721,You mean the Goodyear storage.
1964.292,32,23601,frederic_l_ballard,,1839.721,1840.363,Sir?
1964.292,32,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1840.363,1841.328,You mean the Goodyear storage?
1964.292,32,23601,frederic_l_ballard,,1841.328,1841.491,Yes sir.
1964.292,32,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1841.491,1842.521,Do you believe that?
1964.292,32,23601,frederic_l_ballard,,1842.521,1845.613,We believe we could not use the independent ones but we could use the company ones.
1964.292,33,29010,justice_bernnan,,1845.613,1847.179,Those that they operate themselves.
1964.292,34,23601,frederic_l_ballard,,1847.179,1848.246,Yes sir.
1964.292,34,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1920.997,1925.975,Well wouldn't Goodyear get a chunk of business anyway if you went back to your purchase --
1964.292,34,23601,frederic_l_ballard,,1925.975,1927.603,"Yes sir, Goodyear --"
1964.292,34,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1927.603,1932.376,I suppose you'd make a requirement's contract with them sometime or (Voice Overlap) on the year's basis.
1964.292,34,23601,frederic_l_ballard,,1932.376,1933.215,"Presumably, Your Honor."
1964.292,34,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1935.355,1938.196,And that would go out through their own stores.
1964.292,34,23601,frederic_l_ballard,,1938.196,1940.033,It would go out that they would get --
1964.292,34,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1940.033,1940.295,They would --
1964.292,34,23601,frederic_l_ballard,,1940.295,1941.321,"That's right, yes sir."
1964.292,34,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1944.228,1946.562,The difference is you wouldn't get the Commission.
1964.292,34,23601,frederic_l_ballard,,1946.562,1951.596,"No, we get -- we would get -- now we would get Your Honor, the profit, the profit."
1964.292,34,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1961.392,1962.806,Well you are talking about purchase and resale --
1964.292,34,23601,frederic_l_ballard,,1962.806,1966.409,Yes Your Honor (Voice Overlap).
1964.292,34,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1966.409,1977.956,I thought the question was that this sort of maintenance in effect that the -- that this Court should affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit and your independent dealers would be free to deal with Goodyear.
1964.292,34,23601,frederic_l_ballard,,1977.956,1978.792,Oh certainly.
1964.292,34,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1979.665,1987.477,"And as they are now, they then would be and that through Goodyear's distribution system and then the only difference is that you wouldn't get the Commission."
1964.292,34,23601,frederic_l_ballard,,1987.477,1988.853,We wouldn't get the Commission on their sales.
1964.292,34,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1995.736,1996.283,Yeah.
1964.292,34,23601,frederic_l_ballard,,1996.283,2001.483,"And they would be free, of course, to - and now, I may say this."
1964.292,35,29010,justice_bernnan,,2040.444,2049.393,"Well in any event, that you say it -- at the outset Mr. Ballard that this Atlantic can't afford not to do sponsoring --"
1964.292,36,23601,frederic_l_ballard,,2049.393,2050.338,That's right.
1964.292,37,29010,justice_bernnan,,2050.338,2054.619,"Operation with all these entail, they got a training, and --"
1964.292,38,23601,frederic_l_ballard,,2054.619,2054.94,That's right.
1964.292,39,29010,justice_bernnan,,2054.94,2057.444,Keeping them supply (Voice Overlap) well that's --
1964.292,39,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2057.444,2061.071,"Well excuse me, is that -- is that contested at all by the Commission?"
1964.292,40,23601,frederic_l_ballard,,2061.071,2062.072,"I don't think so, Your Honor."
1964.292,40,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2083.719,2086.885,Well that doesn't mean that you have to make sure they do it.
1964.292,40,23601,frederic_l_ballard,,2086.885,2093.069,"No sir, it doesn't say -- it says every major oil company offers some kind of TBA program."
1964.292,40,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2093.069,2099.428,"You might require to do but does it require you to undertake, to choose the brand that they have in."
1964.292,40,23601,frederic_l_ballard,,2099.428,2107.341,"Your Honor, we've given a great deal of thought to this and this suggestion is made, of course, in the Solicitor's brief, Solicitor General's brief."
1964.292,40,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2111.181,2113.554,Do you think the Commission deals with this at all?
1964.292,40,23601,frederic_l_ballard,,2113.554,2115.077,"I don't believe they did, Your Honor."
1964.292,40,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2115.889,2119.932,But do you think this is -- do they just assume that you do have to do this?
1964.292,40,23601,frederic_l_ballard,,2119.932,2120.79,"I believe they did, Your Honor."
1964.292,40,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2120.79,2123.066,Do you assume that you're going to do it one way or another?
1964.292,40,23601,frederic_l_ballard,,2123.066,2124.104,"I think they do, Your Honor."
1964.292,40,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2125.621,2127.858,They don't purport to forbid you from doing at all.
1964.292,40,23601,frederic_l_ballard,,2127.858,2129.09,"No sir, I think they did not."
1964.292,41,29010,justice_bernnan,,2129.09,2136.767,"Well it's not a fact I would suppose that exceptions 1, 3, and 4 (Voice Overlap)"
1964.292,42,23601,frederic_l_ballard,,2136.767,2138.687,"That's the way we read it, yes Your Honor."
1964.292,42,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2138.687,2148.44,"Well they do it -- they do accept from legitimacy if you're pursuing carefully and insidiously the handling of the specific brand, wouldn't you?"
1964.292,42,23601,frederic_l_ballard,,2148.44,2149.323,"Yes they do, Your Honor."
1964.292,42,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,2149.912,2153.624,"Mr. Ballard, I didn't quite read the commission's report that way."
1964.292,42,23601,frederic_l_ballard,,2192.907,2193.067,Yes sir.
1964.292,42,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,2193.067,2194.329,Being in wholesale --
1964.292,42,23601,frederic_l_ballard,,2194.329,2198.823,"It was to that paragraph that I was referring when I told Justice White, I found that a highly equivocal paragraph."
1964.292,42,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2309.786,2315.303,"But you tell me, they are not allowing these principles because it begins to their paragraphs five and six, wouldn't that be right?"
1964.292,42,23601,frederic_l_ballard,,2315.303,2316.776,"Quite right, quite right, Your Honor."
1964.292,42,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2320.272,2321.347,I don't intend to let you.
1964.292,42,23601,frederic_l_ballard,,2321.347,2323.497,"Yes sir, I'm sure they don't."
1964.292,42,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2330.049,2345.06,Alright.
1964.292,43,33118,john_f_sonnett,,2345.79,2348.54,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1964.292,43,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2378.673,2379.225,Who's brief?
1964.292,43,33118,john_f_sonnett,,2379.225,2394.687,"Atlantic's brief, a reference to the fact that smaller tire companies do have sales commission plans with other oil companies and specifically, Mr. Justice White, you will find there a reference to Lee."
1964.292,43,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2406.68,2411.13,"But nevertheless this is one of the underpinnings of the Commission's opinion, I gather?"
1964.292,43,33118,john_f_sonnett,,2411.13,2412.672,"Yes, Mr. Justice White."
1964.292,44,29010,justice_bernnan,,2489.802,2492.743,Is this the same thing at 370 in your Appendix?
1964.292,45,33118,john_f_sonnett,,2492.743,2494.527,"Yes, Your Honor."
1964.292,45,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2578.844,2586.151,"So that there was a violation, flagrant violation of -- assuming there was that was not beyond unusual provision in a brief."
1964.292,45,33118,john_f_sonnett,,2586.151,2591.832,"I intend, Mr. Justice Douglas to concentrate my file after lunch on that particular point."
1964.292,45,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2745.734,2748.127,"Mr. Sonnett, you may continue your argument."
1964.292,45,33118,john_f_sonnett,,2748.127,2755.028,"Mr. Chief Justice, I will, may it please the Court, advance four points on behalf of Goodyear."
1964.292,45,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2852.056,2855.137,[Inaudible]
1964.292,45,33118,john_f_sonnett,,2855.137,2858.324,"I don't have the cross reference, Mr. Justice Stewart."
1964.292,46,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,3489.306,3492.701,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1964.292,47,29010,justice_bernnan,,4329.424,4333.811,Are you going to distinguish non coercive use in the ordinary [Inaudible]
1964.292,48,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,4333.811,4341.494,"No, we don't distinguish that the - we think the overt act of coercion asymptomatic with the basic power."
1964.292,49,29010,justice_bernnan,,4341.802,4345.622,You are talking about non-coercive.
1964.292,50,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,4345.622,4348.991,"Well instead of using non-coercion, I use pressure."
1964.292,51,29010,justice_bernnan,,4350.322,4351.583,Is that coercion?
1964.292,52,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,4351.583,4352.396,Pardon?
1964.292,53,29010,justice_bernnan,,4352.396,4354.121,Pressure is not coercion.
1964.292,54,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,4354.121,4356.673,Well pressure is something less than explicit coercion.
1964.292,54,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4373.235,4376.191,Does the power alone is in the --
1964.292,54,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,4376.191,4376.873,Well the power alone --
1964.292,54,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4376.873,4379.954,"The power apparently, you're just think are non-coercive."
1964.292,54,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,4379.954,4385.918,"Well the power maybe coercive but in this case, in this case we have the power and its use."
1964.292,55,29010,justice_bernnan,,4391.641,4397.411,Do you have power in use meaning pressure not power in use meaning pressure.
1964.292,56,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,4397.411,4402.532,"Power in use meaning pressure with some coercion, with some coercion."
1964.292,57,29010,justice_bernnan,,5650.211,5651.409,May I get back to [Inaudible]
1964.292,58,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,5651.409,5652.238,Yes sir.
1964.292,59,29010,justice_bernnan,,5652.238,5659.404,Are you suggesting that the first sentence that we find in the appellants has a --
1964.292,60,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,5659.404,5659.522,Yes.
1964.292,61,29010,justice_bernnan,,5659.522,5666.164,"Then we further find, are you suggesting me through alternative basis, alternative findings?"
1964.292,62,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,5666.164,5674.043,Well there -- there double find - the two findings as the first finding that they are actually coerced.
1964.292,63,29010,justice_bernnan,,5683.393,5684.785,Well that's what I'm trying to get it.
1964.292,64,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,5693.705,5703.321,"Well I think again of the Commission, the Commission said that it would go out of the coercion as merely symptomatic of the basic vice of the plan."
1964.292,64,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5703.321,5709.165,Yeah but they certainly go on here and they have the power even without the whole coercive acts --
1964.292,64,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,5709.165,5709.829,Yes.
1964.292,65,29010,justice_bernnan,,5709.829,5714.673,"And that if they have the power, all they have to do with the power is to sign the Commission plan."
1964.292,66,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,5714.673,5715.129,Well they say the acts of --
1964.292,66,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5715.129,5716.484,That's all they have to do.
1964.292,66,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,5716.484,5718.128,They said they exercise the power.
1964.292,66,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5718.128,5719.323,Yeah by signing the Commission plan.
1964.292,66,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,5719.323,5721.704,Through the use of the sales commission plan.
1964.292,66,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5721.704,5722.711,That's what I say --
1964.292,66,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,5722.711,5722.821,Yes.
1964.292,66,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5722.821,5726.969,"Through the use of the sales commission plan, all they have to do is sign it up with Goodyear and there's the violation."
1964.292,66,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,5726.969,5728.716,"Well no, I think they have to do more than sign."
1964.292,66,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,5746.534,5755.961,[Inaudible] what I'm reading from B37 of the Appendix which is the part where they mentioned [Inaudible] Now do I read this wrong?
1964.292,66,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5847.215,5852.392,And isn't that exactly what the Court of Appeals affirmed?
1964.292,66,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,5852.392,5867.919,"Well I think Mr. Justice, it maybe to some extent a semantic problem because when you say this type of contract and when they speak of this type of contract, they mean this contract as the record shows that we view --"
1964.292,66,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,5867.919,5868.938,As symptomatic.
1964.292,66,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,5905.326,5911.986,"Now that's (Voice Overlap) that's said, Mr. Justice, that the overt act of coercion were mere as instances."
1964.292,66,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,5911.986,5913.441,"Yes, I -- I agree."
1964.292,66,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,5913.884,5933.022,"And I think what the Commission was really saying is that when you have this relationship between an oil company and its dealers and when you have this agreement by which the oil company agrees to sponsor the thing, that the inevitable effect of this is to believe this kind of pressure."
1964.292,66,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,5947.354,5976.438,"[Inaudible] to fact that this type of arrangement by reason of the inherent quality of pressure, there is an anticompetitive arrangement which the Commission may properly prevent."
1964.292,66,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,5976.438,5984.289,"I think it does, Mr. Justice, but I just want to emphasize this, that this finding, this conclusion, is not made in the abstract."
1964.292,66,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,5987.252,5992.468,And I find no objection to that because it's better that the case be proved than assumed.
1964.292,66,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,5992.468,5992.818,But --
1964.292,66,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,5992.818,5994.286,And I think that's --
1964.292,67,29010,justice_bernnan,,5994.286,6001.016,"Well aren't you just - exactly, this was to say the sales contract - it says that sales commission system --"
1964.292,68,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,6001.016,6001.53,System --
1964.292,69,29010,justice_bernnan,,6001.53,6002.543,-- itself.
1964.292,70,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,6019.498,6021.018,I think -- that's right.
1964.292,71,29010,justice_bernnan,,6076.306,6083.374,That's not a hypothetical issue?[Laughter]
1964.292,72,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,6083.374,6084.743,And I - I mean if this is - this --
1964.292,73,29010,justice_bernnan,,6084.743,6086.368,How can he give?
1964.292,74,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,6086.368,6097.894,"This is -- unfortunately, I was only enlisted man so I never had that kind of offer made to me but again it's the reality and this is the way things work."
1964.292,75,29010,justice_bernnan,,6250.563,6266.354,"I suppose Mr. Friedman you answered to Mr. Sonnett's suggestions about the government's attorney talking about the contract, there's enough of this, that the system you --"
1964.292,76,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,6266.354,6266.765,That's right.
1964.292,77,29010,justice_bernnan,,6266.765,6268.722,- and not just a contract standing alone.
1964.292,78,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,6268.722,6269.037,That's right.
1964.292,79,29010,justice_bernnan,,6324.561,6326.779,[Inaudible]
1964.292,80,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,6326.779,6340.991,"Yes, the contract is specifically does refer to that."
1964.292,81,29010,justice_bernnan,,6420.337,6451.296,"I'm still puzzled that Goodyear laying aside now what all that the samples of the three other oil companies, how -- I've forgotten some said were 150 -- you said they're eight -- eight or nine or whatever it is, how the Board can conclude it necessarily, whatever the arrangement maybe other oil dealers do anymore than what you said that eliminated at least the thought maybe permissible."
1964.292,82,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,6453.259,6455.456,"Well let me - let me explain that, Mr. Justice."
1964.292,83,29010,justice_bernnan,,6520.998,6523.411,You mean that the actual operation --
1964.292,84,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,6523.411,6524.222,The actual --
1964.292,85,29010,justice_bernnan,,6524.222,6529.641,-- were similar to those that were proved in greater detail than the operation in the Atlantic company.
1964.292,86,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,6529.641,6530.394,That's correct.
1964.292,87,29010,justice_bernnan,,6530.394,6535.237,"Well as to the problem, I don't know how that apprise to eight or nine."
1964.292,88,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,6535.237,6551.711,"Well if there - it seems to me the Commission having found that this having made findings as to the system, the operation of a plan between Goodyear and Atlantic having found that, had then found that Goodyear had similar arrangements with eight or nine other companies."
1964.292,89,29010,justice_bernnan,,6551.711,6555.044,Which -- oh and -- three of which operated the same as the Atlantic company.
1964.292,90,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,6555.044,6555.702,That's right.
1964.292,91,29010,justice_bernnan,,6686.446,6688.744,I forgot [Inaudible]
1964.292,92,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,6688.744,6689.334,Pardon sir?
1964.292,93,29010,justice_bernnan,,6689.334,6692.072,"[Inaudible] order or something like this, something like the Broch order?"
1964.292,94,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,6692.072,6694.025,Well the Broch order was a little different problem.
1964.292,95,29010,justice_bernnan,,7024.309,7069.352,"[Inaudible] a sales commission plan or a system were modified as between Atlantic and Goodyear [Inaudible] well let's put it in the context, we submit that it'd be alright on purchase and resale namely that Atlantic could be willing to pay Commission for doing it really encourage their dealers to buy from Goodyear and from Goodyear to sales points but made it clear that they were free and they didn't care if they didn't go shop around anywhere else, would that kind of thing be a sort of thing to the parties to get a modification in this order?"
1964.292,96,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,7069.352,7072.698,"Well I'm not sure, Mr. Justice."
1964.292,97,29010,justice_bernnan,,7085.865,7100.932,"Well I difficulty when I asked the question is I thought you told me earlier, there's no contention of the government that the sales commission contract in and of itself runs afoul of such requirement."
1964.292,98,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,7103.144,7103.798,That's right.
1964.292,99,29010,justice_bernnan,,7103.798,7106.169,The method of operation --
1964.292,100,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,7106.169,7106.607,I --
1964.292,101,29010,justice_bernnan,,7106.607,7116.393,"I would suppose that would mean, there would be a number of the method employed in the performance of the contract if eliminated that would satisfy."
1964.292,102,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,7116.393,7123.368,Well they're -- they're conceivably might but again it would depend on precisely what the modifications were I would think.
1964.292,103,29010,justice_bernnan,,7123.368,7133.273,But you do not -- the government does not suggest that there may not be commission sales arrangements which wouldn't - which would satisfy Section 5.
1964.292,104,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,7133.273,7134.612,No we don't go that far.
1964.292,104,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7215.912,7229.327,"Mr. Friedman, the Court of Appeals referred to the company's arguments that they should be free to recommend a particular line of TBA."
1964.292,104,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,7244.362,7249.734,They can't recommend as they -- in the way which they recommend it here.
1964.292,104,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7253.479,7274.397,"But why wouldn't you argue that is it is the contract with the recommendation, it's the contract with the recommendation has done here that that's really bad why shouldn't - why shouldn't the Commission be able to bar them entering into a contract by which the company promises to do this."
1964.292,104,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,7278.706,7290.506,Well I think that -- I think again I suppose that the Commission would have to -- the Commission in effect has done that here saying that on the basis of what they have done --
1964.292,104,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7290.506,7298.309,"Then why can't you just order Goodyear, bar Goodyear from entering into such contracts which require people to do this solely."
1964.292,104,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,7298.309,7298.773,Well we think --
1964.292,104,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7298.773,7302.788,Without any regard to coercion or --
1964.292,104,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,7302.788,7304.187,Well I think the coercion is --
1964.292,104,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7304.187,7310.313,So he would just say -- this would just say these kinds promises in the contract it is bad contract.
1964.292,104,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,7310.313,7335.165,"Well I think, Mr. Justice, he probably needs something more than that because the basis on which the Commission's decision holding the Atlantic contract to be invalid rests is the power that Atlantic has and the fact that in these circumstances that the power is brought to bear and I think we need something probably more than that to indicate that the power is brought to bear in this case against others as well."
1964.292,104,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7335.165,7341.143,And you - and you think that satisfies Goodyear by saying three of the others operated in that same way.
1964.292,104,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,7341.143,7351.966,Well a little more -- three of the -- three of the eight operated in the same way and we show that all of them had substantially the same basic contract.
1964.292,104,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7352.934,7354.594,How about 156?
1964.292,104,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,7354.594,7358.798,"Well we -- the 156, Mr. Justice, is merely the number of oil companies --"
1964.292,104,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7358.798,7359.762,I'm understand that.
1964.292,104,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,7365.044,7368.814,"To sign one of these contracts, Goodyear maybe able if Goodyear think --"
1964.292,104,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7368.814,7373.674,How about all those fellows with the power in the sense?
1964.292,104,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,7373.674,7376.044,Well we don't - we don't know again if it seems to me --
1964.292,104,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7376.044,7378.859,But less prevented for entering into the contract --
1964.292,104,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,7378.859,7379.265,If they could --
1964.292,104,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7379.265,7381.745,The only thing about their power --
1964.292,104,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,7381.745,7383.235,We know nothing about their power.
1964.292,104,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7383.945,7387.384,But I thought you just said you needed that element in there.
1964.292,104,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,7387.384,7407.2,"As to the existing contract -- as to the existing contract but as to the others, there is the prohibition on entering into with any other favor again, it seems that this is the kind of situation where if Goodyear can show that a particular contract is unlikely to have this vice, ti can come forward and demonstrate this to commission."
1964.292,104,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7407.2,7413.57,"Having permitted and get around without filing the order, giving around the [Inaudible] 156."
1964.292,104,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,7413.57,7418.402,Well the - the order doesn't prohibit them as I understand it from really initiating discussions.
1964.292,104,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,7429.046,7431.114,Mr. Simon.
1964.292,105,46195,william_simon,,7431.114,7438.141,"Briefly in reply, Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court."
