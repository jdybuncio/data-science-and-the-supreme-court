1996.95-1726,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.628,"We'll hear argument now in Number 95-1726, United States v. LaBonte."
1996.95-1726,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,8.628,13.19,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1996.95-1726,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,131.158,133.569,Your position is that maximum means maximum.
1996.95-1726,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,133.569,135.792,"That is absolutely correct, Justice Scalia."
1996.95-1726,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,135.792,137.442,But authorized by what?
1996.95-1726,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,137.442,141.626,Maximum term authorized by statute.
1996.95-1726,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,141.626,143.156,"No, I know, but by what statute?"
1996.95-1726,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,157.196,159.818,Controlled substance.
1996.95-1726,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,159.818,188.74,"--controlled substance, and then we have statutes that say if you do this near a school it's an extra thing, and then if you did it with... another extra thing... I mean, like, there... does it mean the maximum authorized by whatever combination of statutes put together produces the most individually tailored, statutorily tailored sentence for this defendant, or does it mean authorized by the statute that deals with the substantive crime, or some combination in between?"
1996.95-1726,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,188.74,196.343,"Well, I think that it actually means the maximum term authorized by statute for the particular offender."
1996.95-1726,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,196.343,220.06,"So in other words they have to have a whole proliferating schedule within the guidelines so that you'd have, for a person who, in fact, is a second offender of a cocaine possession with intent to distribute, and in the course of that he injures another person, and he does it near a school, and you know, there you have a footnote with about six other things, and then there are... and there has to be one schedule for that person."
1996.95-1726,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,232.969,239.273,I think this would have been the easiest statute in the commission's repertoire for it to implement.
1996.95-1726,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,241.244,245.317,"--Yes, but I mean I understand that we could have taken it that way, but I'm--"
1996.95-1726,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,245.317,264.99,"--a sentence at or near the maximum is a sentence within 15 or 20 percent or 25 percent of the maximum, and for any defendant who's covered by section 994(h), when the sentencing court determines what his authorized statutory maximum term is, the range is X percent less than that up to the top."
1996.95-1726,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,264.99,266.852,"--Well, this is pretty much near a two-thirds."
1996.95-1726,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,268.995,275.269,"Well, it is not... it is not for an offender like LaBonte, and I think that it's important to keep in mind exactly what is going on here."
1996.95-1726,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,326.914,332.178,"--Yes but... I'm sorry, I didn't get an answer to my original question, which I... because I unfortunately got distracted."
1996.95-1726,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,354.211,355.002,--Yes.
1996.95-1726,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,355.002,358.275,So you'd have to go through the... that's the only way... and you think that's clear?
1996.95-1726,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,360.028,364.94,"I think that the term, maximum statutory term authorized means maximum statutory term authorized--"
1996.95-1726,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,364.94,365.902,--For this individual--
1996.95-1726,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,365.902,366.413,--for an individual.
1996.95-1726,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,366.413,370.513,--So one would have to go through and individualize all of these--
1996.95-1726,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,370.513,371.314,"Well, that is done, of course--"
1996.95-1726,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,371.314,372.385,--You have to do that in any sentence.
1996.95-1726,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,372.385,375.117,--Any time a sentencing court--
1996.95-1726,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,375.117,376.119,"No, no, that's a--"
1996.95-1726,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,376.119,377.531,--It will do a presentence--
1996.95-1726,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,377.531,380.062,"--Under that reading, why do you need the word categories?"
1996.95-1726,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,380.062,399.733,"--I don't think the word categories does add a lot under the statute, Justice Kennedy, and I wouldn't suggest to the Court that under our view of the statute it has huge operative significance, but I think in the context of section 994(h) it has plenty of significance in the following respect:"
1996.95-1726,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,437.53,440.792,May I ask a fact question before you get too deeply into the argument?
1996.95-1726,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,440.792,440.983,Certainly.
1996.95-1726,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,440.983,445.006,You say that under the career view of the statute the maximum is 30 years.
1996.95-1726,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,445.006,445.327,Correct.
1996.95-1726,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,445.327,448.469,And it's... under the commission's view the maximum is 20 years.
1996.95-1726,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,448.469,448.739,Correct.
1996.95-1726,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,448.739,451.931,Because you're not taking into the career offender factors there.
1996.95-1726,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,461.928,462.139,Yes.
1996.95-1726,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,473.424,476.356,"Would it have been roughly a third, or... a third or a half, something like that?"
1996.95-1726,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,476.356,477.557,--I'd be willing to accept that.
1996.95-1726,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,477.557,481.07,"If... so in other words, if it was a third it might have been 7 or 8 years."
1996.95-1726,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,481.07,481.671,Correct.
1996.95-1726,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,481.671,498.974,"Whereas... and if you then say that you should take... and the normal third of the 30 years would have been 10 years, absent the requirement that it be at or near the maximum, but now the... under the commission's view it is at or near the maximum of 20 years because of the guideline provision, isn't it?"
1996.95-1726,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,498.974,499.195,Right.
1996.95-1726,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,507.799,519.368,"No, I understand that, but even interpreting the at or near maximum the way the commission does, you do get a substantially higher sentence for a career offender than you would absent the statute."
1996.95-1726,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,519.368,519.898,"Yes, you do."
1996.95-1726,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,519.898,520.227,Yes.
1996.95-1726,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,520.227,525.672,"And if the statute had only said substantial sentence, or substantially higher sentence, we would have a different case."
1996.95-1726,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,612.549,625.098,"Mr. Dreeben, the problem we have in this case stems from a new commentary adopted by the commission to section 4B1.1 of the guidelines."
1996.95-1726,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,625.098,626.169,"That is right, Justice O'Connor."
1996.95-1726,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,626.169,632.413,And what precise relief are you asking us to provide if that commentary is wrong?
1996.95-1726,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,632.413,633.434,Invalidate--
1996.95-1726,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,633.434,636.897,"What are you asking us to do, invalidate... invalidate the commentary?"
1996.95-1726,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,636.897,637.278,--That is right.
1996.95-1726,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,637.278,641.74,And we treat the commentary as a rule or regulation or something?
1996.95-1726,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,641.74,645.593,"Well, not even so exalted a status as rule or regulation."
1996.95-1726,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,659.383,661.633,Have we ever struck down a commentary?
1996.95-1726,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,663.176,669.22,"--Well, I think the point of Stinson is that the commentary does carry the force of law in this sense."
1996.95-1726,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,733.077,737.81,"--It's... I mean, the ambiguity, if there is one, I think is in the word authorized."
1996.95-1726,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,810.026,821.885,"--Well, I think, Justice Breyer, that the only thing that you can clearly attribute to Congress is that it identified a category of repeat offenders who are worse than other categories of repeat offenders--"
1996.95-1726,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,821.885,821.933,Yes.
1996.95-1726,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,821.933,823.745,--that came to the legislature's mind.
1996.95-1726,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,823.745,823.936,All right.
1996.95-1726,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,835.414,835.634,Okay.
1996.95-1726,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,838.606,838.806,Yes.
1996.95-1726,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,838.806,841.227,The court of appeals advanced something similar.
1996.95-1726,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,841.227,841.978,"No, they didn't get... yes, all right."
1996.95-1726,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,842.159,842.87,They did it on the basis of--
1996.95-1726,1,21731,david_n_yellen,,1508.819,1514.353,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1996.95-1726,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1581.217,1587.402,"Well, how... why was Congress... why was the commission in a position to second guess Congress on that?"
1996.95-1726,1,21731,david_n_yellen,,1598.439,1612.488,"Mr. Chief Justice, the discretion that the prosecutor has under 851 and 841 is to raise the ceiling, to raise the maximum term allowed, and it's then not up to the prosecutor to decide what the actual sentence is."
1996.95-1726,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1634.493,1636.095,When they passed 994(h).
1996.95-1726,1,21731,david_n_yellen,,1636.095,1648.661,"That's right, and 994(h) directs a sentence at or near the maximum applicable to the categories of defendants, not defined clearly as Mr. Dreeben suggested in this statute, but very broadly."
1996.95-1726,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1676.981,1677.211,Well--
1996.95-1726,1,21731,david_n_yellen,,1677.211,1681.766,--under the guidelines or aggravating factors that warrant a departure above the guidelines.
1996.95-1726,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1681.766,1707.611,"--Well, that goes to explain the ambiguity, I guess, but even assuming the ambiguity... I do assume the ambiguity... it's difficult for me to understand why the authorization would be to eliminate the possibility, if not the effect of prosecutorial discretion when Congress has expressly granted prosecutorial discretion."
1996.95-1726,1,21731,david_n_yellen,,1724.675,1736.422,"Well, Justice Souter, the discretion... the prosecutorial discretion that Congress has said is a good thing is the prosecutor's discretion to seek a higher maximum term, not to seek a higher specific term."
1996.95-1726,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1756.367,1787.937,"Well, that's quite true, but the presumed effect will be, by giving prosecutors that discretion and by giving courts authority based upon the prosecutorial exercise of that discretion, the natural effect in the mind run of cases will be to increase sentences, and why should... why is it an appropriate policy to eliminate an effect which has so explicitly been granted and, I have to assume, intended?"
1996.95-1726,1,21731,david_n_yellen,,1787.937,1812.633,"--But the effect is still there, the effect of raising the ceiling, that all of the defenders in this case could have received sentences... under the commission's Amendment 506 they could have received sentences longer than 20 years, up to and including 30 years, if, as is very commonly the case with career offenders, there was a large quantity of drugs, or there was the use of a gun, or there were any other aggravating factors."
1996.95-1726,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1846.854,1853.64,"Well, that was because in addition to his violation of 841 he had, what, two prior convictions?"
1996.95-1726,1,21731,david_n_yellen,,1853.64,1856.251,"That's right, Mr. Chief Justice, and--"
1996.95-1726,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1856.251,1857.262,What were those for?
1996.95-1726,1,21731,david_n_yellen,,1857.262,1864.847,--One was another drug offense and one was a commercial burglary that the lower court considered to be a crime of violence.
1996.95-1726,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1886.481,1887.692,"Mr. Yellen, why is that unthinkable?"
1996.95-1726,1,21731,david_n_yellen,,1908.077,1910.488,"--Justice Scalia, I'm not saying it's unwise at all."
1996.95-1726,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1922.455,1925.477,"Well then, give me the more horrible example that will apply if you will lose--"
1996.95-1726,1,21731,david_n_yellen,,1925.477,1925.967,--His sentence--
1996.95-1726,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1925.967,1927.159,--and I will make the same comment.
1996.95-1726,1,21731,david_n_yellen,,1936.205,1949.815,"--Certainly, I understand that position completely, but the issue here is not what any member of this Court thinks is the appropriate sentence, of course, but did Congress intend precisely to answer this question about--"
1996.95-1726,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1949.815,1957.009,I'm saying I'm not shocked by the notion that they would have been... much of your argument has gone to that Congress couldn't have meant to increase the sentence.
1996.95-1726,1,21731,david_n_yellen,,1960.382,1961.514,--I don't suggest that they--
1996.95-1726,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1961.514,1963.153,"Or better, depending on whether you like it or don't like it."
1996.95-1726,1,21731,david_n_yellen,,1963.153,1966.195,--Congress has certainly enacted statutes that are more punitive than this.
1996.95-1726,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1967.347,1980.937,"But that's... Justice Scalia I think has put his finger on what's really the difficult underlying question here, because he said the fairest reading of the statute, and I suppose what's really at stake is... and sometimes you'll be on one side of this and sometimes the other side."
1996.95-1726,1,21731,david_n_yellen,,1992.994,1993.255,--Yes.
1996.95-1726,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2008.385,2010.807,Have we said the commission enjoys full-fledged Chevron deference?
1996.95-1726,1,21731,david_n_yellen,,2010.807,2027.479,"The Court has not said that specifically, but the lower courts have generally said that and the statute, 994(h) in particular, instructing the commission to do all of these things, says quite clearly that the commission has very broad authority."
1996.95-1726,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2050.063,2059.989,"Mr. Yellen, before we get to Chevron, Judge Stahl on the First Circuit said that he didn't consider the reading you're proposing a plausible one."
1996.95-1726,1,21731,david_n_yellen,,2081.244,2084.967,"No, Justice Ginsburg, I disagree with that, and maybe I haven't said it clearly."
1996.95-1726,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2175.412,2192.102,"Mr. Yellen, I'm not sure I fully grasp your answer, because I thought the very purpose of the Sentencing Commission's exercise here was to treat alike cases where the prosecutor had asked for enhancement and cases where they hadn't where the defendant's conduct was the same."
1996.95-1726,1,21731,david_n_yellen,,2192.102,2194.383,--They're only alike as a starting point.
1996.95-1726,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2241.679,2254.778,"But it's still... it lets the judge then treat alike two defendants who have the same history in every respect, but in one case the prosecutor went for enhancement and the other the prosecutor didn't."
1996.95-1726,1,21731,david_n_yellen,,2254.778,2260.371,"That's right, and the commission's rationale for that is to do otherwise would be to invite unwarranted disparity."
1996.95-1726,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2262.825,2273.58,"But why is the disparity unwarranted when the authority which is the predicate of the disparity... that is, the prosecutor's discretion... is specifically conferred by law?"
1996.95-1726,1,21731,david_n_yellen,,2278.112,2286.049,"--In the commission's view it's unwarranted because you have, under the Government's view of the statute, two defendants who have committed the same crime."
1996.95-1726,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2297.326,2299.627,"Oh, I think I understand that."
1996.95-1726,1,21731,david_n_yellen,,2345.89,2352.605,"--It is, because Congress has not expressly answered this question before the court."
1996.95-1726,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2352.605,2387.497,"Well, it hasn't expressly answered it, but what it has done is to give a general rule and then a very specific authorization to prosecutors, which will in the natural course have an effect of creating, in fact, two different levels of sentencing for the base offense, and don't we generally say the specific governs the general, and if that's the case here, does the commission really have a legitimate option to say no, we think the general philosophy is more important than the effect of the specific authorization to prosecutors?"
1996.95-1726,1,21731,david_n_yellen,,2387.497,2394.383,"The specific authorization to prosecutors in 851, as I've tried to suggest, doesn't mandate any sentencing--"
1996.95-1726,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2394.383,2405.338,"It doesn't mandate it, but its natural effect is to facilitate it, and it must have been the intention of Congress that in a certain number of cases that judicial option would be exercised."
1996.95-1726,1,21731,david_n_yellen,,2405.338,2406.099,--In a certain number of cases.
1996.95-1726,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3202.96,3206.62,"Unless the Court has any questions, the Government waives rebuttal."
1996.95-1726,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3206.62,3208.942,The case is submitted.
