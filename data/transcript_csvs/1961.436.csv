1961.436,0,21463,david_rein,,27.627,31.059,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1961.436,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,169.119,170.646,He made a pertinency before?
1961.436,0,21463,david_rein,,170.646,171.725,"Oh, yes, he did."
1961.436,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,171.725,172.54,After --
1961.436,0,21463,david_rein,,172.54,172.962,"Yes, he --"
1961.436,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,172.962,174.228,-- (Inaudible)
1961.436,0,21463,david_rein,,174.228,179.046,"-- he made a pertinency objection by saying, ""I don't think that the question is pertinent""."
1961.436,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,297.315,298.628,He is sapient?
1961.436,0,21463,david_rein,,298.628,300.548,"Well, that's their terminology."
1961.436,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,303.581,305.629,Then why -- why was it peculiar about the language?
1961.436,0,21463,david_rein,,306.098,309.533,"Well, it's peculiar because I don't know that they have a classification."
1961.436,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,332.313,334.635,"Well, they have pigeonholes in which they put witnesses --"
1961.436,0,21463,david_rein,,334.635,334.938,Yes.
1961.436,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,334.938,335.302,-- in advance.
1961.436,0,21463,david_rein,,335.302,339.093,"That's correct, in advance."
1961.436,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,496.552,497.798,Where is it in your brief?
1961.436,0,21463,david_rein,,497.798,498.787,6 to 7.
1961.436,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,498.787,499.647,6 to 7.
1961.436,0,21463,david_rein,,499.647,501.612,I'm sorry.
1961.436,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,628.385,632.479,"We'll recess now, Mr. --"
1961.436,0,21463,david_rein,,635.234,640.638,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1961.436,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1390.374,1393.528,What are the indictments alleged that the subject under inquiry was?
1961.436,0,21463,david_rein,,1393.528,1396.489,"It didn't allege anything, Your Honor."
1961.436,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1399.362,1405.063,"Well on the previous case, in the Yellin case, the indictment did allege in some specific detail of the subject under inquiry."
1961.436,0,21463,david_rein,,1405.063,1419.565,"Well, we have briefed in our brief and I won't have time to get into it, that the Government in the District of Columbia has adopted the practice of never alleging the subject under inquiry or never alleging pertinence."
1961.436,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1444.243,1444.507,Well in here --
1961.436,0,21463,david_rein,,1444.507,1444.889,-- both of those problems.
1961.436,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1444.889,1448.604,"-- in this case you don't know what the theory of the grand jury was, do you?"
1961.436,0,21463,david_rein,,1448.604,1450.087,"Well, I don't know."
1961.436,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1454.656,1456.46,Do you ask -- do you ask for a bill of particular?
1961.436,0,21463,david_rein,,1456.46,1458.093,"Yes, I did Your Honor."
1961.436,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1458.093,1458.446,(Inaudible)
1961.436,0,21463,david_rein,,1458.446,1459.375,Yes.
1961.436,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1459.375,1461.326,Did you take an exception for that?
1961.436,0,21463,david_rein,,1461.326,1468.928,"Well, it's not -- I'm sure it's preserved in the record without the necessity of taking exception under our procedure."
1961.436,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1652.559,1659.027,"Now, let me just -- you -- you were to concede with.Sure that was just an indirect way of asking him whether he'd been in those conference meetings."
1961.436,0,21463,david_rein,,1659.027,1659.808,I don't concede.
1961.436,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1659.808,1660.257,(Voice Overlap)
1961.436,0,21463,david_rein,,1660.257,1662.332,In fact but let's assume that.
1961.436,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1663.551,1663.561,It's an --
1961.436,0,21463,david_rein,,1663.561,1663.763,Let's assume --
1961.436,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1663.763,1663.981,alternate way of --
1961.436,0,21463,david_rein,,1663.981,1664.381,the question --
1961.436,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1664.381,1665.052,-- stating that question.
1961.436,0,21463,david_rein,,1665.052,1668.954,Whether he was at communist meetings in 1936 to 1940.
1961.436,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,1686.257,1690.691,You think the Committee is bound by this statement (Inaudible)?
1961.436,0,21463,david_rein,,1690.691,1692.996,"The Committee is not bound by it, as a matter of fact that -- it wasn't."
1961.436,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,1692.996,1698.522,"And you can't any further, you can't cross-examine and can't go to find out whether he's telling the truth?"
1961.436,0,21463,david_rein,,1698.522,1710.384,"Well, let's put it this way, if the Committee is not interested and -- and the Staff Director there has made it perfectly clear, not only under the annual report reflects that."
1961.436,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1828.022,1830.241,Mr. Terris.
1961.436,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,1830.241,1834.27,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1961.436,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2180.492,2182.84,All those are three separate --
1961.436,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,2182.84,2188.04,"Well, the first two are quite -- are -- are really -- are really the same thing."
1961.436,1,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,2204.774,2207.18,(Inaudible)
1961.436,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,2207.18,2208.193,That's right.
1961.436,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2374.101,2379.153,I noticed on footnote 33 on page 108 of brief that you --
1961.436,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,2379.153,2379.434,That was not a holding.
1961.436,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2379.434,2380.761,-- exchanged your positions?
1961.436,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,2380.761,2381.211,"Yes, that is not a --"
1961.436,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2381.211,2382.763,As to what Markham case holds?
1961.436,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,2382.763,2384.403,"No, that is not a holding."
1961.436,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2386.144,2388.664,"Now, in Shelton, it was represented to us that was a holding and in --"
1961.436,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,2388.664,2388.687,There was a mistake.
1961.436,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2388.687,2389.864,"-- Markham case, it was not."
1961.436,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,2389.864,2390.926,"There was a mistake, Your Honor."
1961.436,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2564.762,2579.949,"Instead, you've given us the two tests by which the sufficiency of an indictment isn't measured according to your position, would they be any different with respect to an information?"
1961.436,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,2582.507,2583.428,I would think so.
1961.436,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2583.428,2588.399,-- well then what's the deference between -- what's -- what's the purpose then in requiring an indictment?
1961.436,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,2588.551,2588.663,Well --
1961.436,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2588.663,2590.802,-- there any further additional test applicable --
1961.436,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,2590.802,2591.082,You go to a grand jury.
1961.436,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2591.082,2593.432,-- to an indictment which are not applicable to an information?
1961.436,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,2593.432,2595.79,"Well, there's -- there's one of course additional protection for the defendant."
1961.436,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2595.79,2596.384,What's that?
1961.436,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,2596.384,2599.566,They goes -- they go to a grand jury and the grand jury supposedly --
1961.436,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2599.566,2604.943,And the grand jury supposedly indicts somebody for his specific offense?
1961.436,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,2604.943,2605.384,That's right.
1961.436,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2622.847,2628.764,"Well, his first argument is that the indictment should -- that the grand jury should have said what the subject was."
1961.436,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,2628.764,2630.471,"Well, that's part of why they're pertinent."
1961.436,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2635.872,2637.195,"Well, but this -- his first step --"
1961.436,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,2637.195,2637.207,Okay.
1961.436,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2637.207,2637.773,-- would be based --
1961.436,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,2637.773,2637.923,Okay.
1961.436,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2637.923,2639.615,-- should have said identified the subject.
1961.436,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,2639.615,2641.829,Okay.
1961.436,1,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,2725.727,2728.793,Why was it made below (Inaudible)?
1961.436,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,2728.793,2734.419,"I -- it was -- it was raised before trial, Your Honor."
1961.436,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2739.767,2746.967,"Mr. Terris, how -- how was the grand jury informed with the pertinency of -- of these questions?"
1961.436,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,2746.967,2751.072,"Your Honor, I've -- I have no way of knowing -- I assume --"
1961.436,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2751.072,2753.124,Doesn't it need to be?
1961.436,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,2753.124,2759.123,"I would -- yes -- yes, I -- I -- just because we don't have it -- the transcript of the grand jury testimony, I don't know."
1961.436,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2772.546,2783.489,"Well, suppose the grand jury was thinking of pertinency and in one light and the -- the trial jury was thinking of it in another light."
1961.436,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,2783.489,2783.827,That's --
1961.436,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2783.827,2792.743,Would -- would you -- would they be prosecuting him for the same offense that the grand jury was charging?
1961.436,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,2792.743,2805.813,"Well, You honor, I submit that that's a danger which the -- this Court's -- the trend of this Court's decisions leave possible, the idea that you don't have to specify every detail that has -- that's going to be proved."
1961.436,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2914.609,2927.698,What do you take that to mean that requirement if it is one that the Committee must not utilize indiscriminate dragnet procedures on some of the witnesses?
1961.436,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,2927.698,2932.962,"I would think that they cannot call somebody off the street and say, ""Dude, what do you know about communism?"""
1961.436,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2932.962,2934.484,Would they be very likely to do something like that?
1961.436,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,2934.484,2936.084,"No, no, they wouldn't."
1961.436,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2951.954,2955.832,It's alleged in the Shelton case that they did something fairly close to that.
1961.436,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,2955.832,2958.951,"It was alleged, Your Honor but I think that -- but the Government's position at least --"
1961.436,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2958.951,2959.145,Yes.
1961.436,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,2959.145,2961.205,-- was that the facts were quite different.
1961.436,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2984.722,2988.637,Is that the extent of the dragnet definition?
1961.436,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,2988.637,3015.796,"Well, I don't want to say that that's the full extent but it seems to me that -- that Barenblatt and the other cases stand for the proposition that -- that this Court and the other federal courts have to presume that Congress of the United States is -- is acting lawfully and that they will not have a full scale inquiry into whether it had justification, probable cause as you will or -- or the --"
1961.436,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3015.796,3026.45,You mean there's a -- are -- are you suggesting that the indiscriminate dragnet means that it would violate that principle if you did not have probable cause to subpoena the witness?
1961.436,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,3026.45,3031.338,"No, I did I -- I tried to answer Mr. Justice Stewart --"
1961.436,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3031.338,3032.1,"Well, I --"
1961.436,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,3032.1,3032.239,-- by saying that --
1961.436,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3032.239,3034.631,-- you tru but you haven't --
1961.436,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,3034.631,3035.063,To say that --
1961.436,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3035.063,3036.293,-- for me that what's you think.
1961.436,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,3036.293,3038.717,The clear cases if they have no information.
1961.436,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3049.404,3051.163,But couldn't that be a legitimate inquiry?
1961.436,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,3063.432,3094.516,"As I read the -- the Barenblatt and the -- and of course this is picked up to some extent in Wilkinson and Braden that although that might have reasonableness that this may -- might well be how an investigator would proceed, that the important First Amendment Rights which are being weighed and I think contrary to petitioners that -- that this Court in those three cases gave very great weight to the First Amendment Right and weighing those important rights that -- that there had to be some more basis than the fact that anybody in that stables."
1961.436,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3094.516,3097.028,"Well, that's not the point but what's the basis?"
1961.436,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,3098.559,3099.163,"No, I don't -- I don't --"
1961.436,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3099.163,3102.997,"Well, then but less than problem where you're phrasing?"
1961.436,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,3102.997,3121.738,I think I'd rather take with the -- the Court's phrasing Your Honor.
1961.436,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3139.992,3145.191,And if I would oppose -- like the opposite of lacking improbable causes but you have probable cause.
1961.436,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,3145.191,3152.45,"Well, one of the difficulties is that -- that words often mean something -- different words than their -- depending on their context."
1961.436,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3226.689,3248.13,"If you -- unless you can point to some constitutional provisions, I find it difficult to follow the idea that a grand jury or a committee that has full power to investigate this matter can prohibit this from summoning everybody it want to summon."
1961.436,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,3251.069,3255.34,"I think I -- well, Your Honor, I think that is the basic principle."
1961.436,1,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,3648.391,3650.695,Was this witness represented at that time?
1961.436,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,3650.695,3651.877,"Oh, yes."
1961.436,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3668.31,3670.39,Can he ask questions?
1961.436,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,3670.39,3671.575,He may not ask questions.
1961.436,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3681.431,3685.137,He cannot raise and object to a question.
1961.436,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,3685.137,3686.496,"No, he -- he is entitled --"
1961.436,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3686.496,3686.756,He can't --
1961.436,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,3686.756,3687.994,-- to whisper in his -- in his --
1961.436,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3687.994,3691.651,He can't address the Chairman?
1961.436,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,3692.768,3702.363,The rules say not but -- but it is so -- as long as the -- the colloquy doesn't go on too long if that the -- the rules seems to be -- not to be honored too well.
