1967.27,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,31.377,"Number 27, Federal Trade Commission petitioner versus Fred Meyer, Incorporated, et al."
1967.27,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,32.899,36.755,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1967.27,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,138.023,149.031,Are you -- are you asking us to consider this case in terms of the limitation of Section 5?
1967.27,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,157.73,158.535,That is correct.
1967.27,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,174.108,184.778,"Well, if that's -- and you agree that Section 5 could not be violated unless there is some technical terms in violation of 2(d) of the Robinson-Patman Act."
1967.27,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,184.778,185.399,That is correct.
1967.27,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,655.971,659.177,"But that's not his injury, is it, Mr. Friedman?"
1967.27,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,663.199,663.632,That's right.
1967.27,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,665.346,683.182,"And as I read the Commission's order, it makes no provision for the qualitative affair of this problem by making a promotional allowance available to the retailer advised from the wholesaler."
1967.27,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,705.863,710.339,"Well, we think the -- it requires him to make it available to the retailer."
1967.27,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,710.339,712.035,That is not what it says.
1967.27,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,712.035,713.652,"I'm sorry, to make it available to the wholesaler."
1967.27,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,713.652,714.562,Wholesaler.
1967.27,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,714.562,732.399,"To make it available to the wholesaler, but we think that this is basically what the statute contemplates, that what is likely to happen in this case as we have developed in our brief is very much going to be the interest of the wholesaler to see to it that these allowances that are -- have been given to the large retailers will be --"
1967.27,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,732.399,737.876,"On the contrary, it may be the interest of the wholesaler to put the allowances right in his own pocket."
1967.27,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,737.876,740.038,"Well, that he could not do Mr. Justice --"
1967.27,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,740.038,740.546,Why?
1967.27,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,740.546,745.219,That he could not do under provisions of the Robinson-Patman Act.
1967.27,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,756.39,758.182,You're riding a little fast there.
1967.27,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,758.182,761.731,Now take it a little -- let's go back a minute.
1967.27,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,789.628,792.981,"Too bad they didn't think of that -- think of that whether that's in the statute, Mr. Friedman."
1967.27,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,795.852,796.01,Well --
1967.27,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,796.01,802.049,"What you've got to do is to say that 2(f) it and that's a long, hard job, isn't it?"
1967.27,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,802.049,825.911,"Well, it's a difficult argument or I would also suggest that it would be an unfair method of competition, Mr. Justice, for the wholesaler to take this allowance given to him because it's necessary to ensure competitive equality between the distribution system on one hand involving the wholesalers and retailers as we say and the other cases which buying retail and thus -- and then just put it in the pocket."
1967.27,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,834.509,841.973,"Well, he just have to use it with his own customers who are competing with the other retailers who were getting the allowance."
1967.27,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,841.973,843.735,Well in this -- he would.
1967.27,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,908.729,916.136,The way you read it now doesn't sound as too much (Inaudible).
1967.27,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,916.136,919.121,But there is this difference -- I think there is a basic difference.
1967.27,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,925.535,927.609,I know but the end result -- there is no difference.
1967.27,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,934.836,935.576,He would have to.
1967.27,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,935.958,939.323,And the end result would be the same.
1967.27,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,939.323,947.469,"Except that under Commissioner Elman's theory, the wholesaler would have no discretion whether to accept it or not."
1967.27,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,954.588,961.272,So the wholesalers can make up his mind as to whether the retailer is competitive disadvantage.
1967.27,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,961.272,967.029,"Well, the wholesaler -- the wholesaler can decide where he wants to make it available to the retailers."
1967.27,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,967.029,972.555,And if the -- whether or not the retailer will or will not be at a competitive disadvantage.
1967.27,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,972.555,975.381,"Well, in that sense, yes."
1967.27,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1147.22,1176.813,"But you have any difficulty in looking at this acrobatic fee that's so often has to be in the form of the statute, looking at it upside down and saying that -- and saying that the retailer in these circumstances, the retailers buys from the wholesalers through indirect customer or the supplier and indirect customer is still a customer that you will be dealing with tomorrow."
1967.27,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1195.564,1197.615,"I have to answer it this way, Mr. Justice."
1967.27,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1211.929,1233.509,I'm aware of that but what bothers me is what the Commission did is that the supplier lacks the -- it seems that they were down to the enrichment of wholesalers and not trickle down to retailers whom the Act by hypothesis has intended to benefit and protect.
1967.27,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1264.248,1276.308,"Well, I think Mr. Justice that we have no assurance any more than we have assurance that if one of these allowances has made available to someone who is directly competing, that he will accept it."
1967.27,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1330.307,1334.155,(Inaudible)
1967.27,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1334.155,1341.009,I think that what is involved in this case basically is that this may not be a perfect solution to the problem.
1967.27,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1427.877,1433.461,"But in that case, you do call the retailer-purchaser, the indirect purchaser, don't you?"
1967.27,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1433.461,1434.514,No we do not Mr. Justice --
1967.27,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1434.514,1435.456,What do you say?
1967.27,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1435.456,1444.784,"No, no we would not call an indirect purchaser unless there was some direct relationship between the seller and the customer."
1967.27,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1444.784,1447.285,"Well, but the 2(a) says purchasers."
1967.27,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1447.285,1451.518,2(a) says purchasers or customers of purchasers.
1967.27,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1452.839,1454.185,"Yes, I --"
1967.27,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1454.185,1462.377,2(a) -- now they rely -- they rely upon -- our opponents rely on that distinction in the language.
1967.27,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1548.804,1558.728,"Mr. Friedman, would you measure the offer that has to be made to the wholesaler in terms of the wholesaler's volume."
1967.27,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1579.84,1580.891,I would think so.
1967.27,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1580.891,1596.176,"And then when he passes it on to a retailer, he may -- as a result favor one retailer who over another who was a direct buying customer from the supplier."
1967.27,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1596.176,1597.929,"I would think Mr. Justice, he has to pass --"
1967.27,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1597.929,1616.92,"I mean -- the question again, I don't want to take more of your time but the question again is whether you don't get this whole thing out of the sculpture, once you start measuring it in terms of the wholesaler, which I take the Commission order to affirm?"
1967.27,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1616.92,1625.467,I would think Mr. Justice that he would be obligated to pass it on to his retail customers in the same basis which he got it.
1967.27,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1625.467,1637.35,"Well, then a retailer customer who buys to the wholesaler gets an advantage over a retailer who buys direct from the supplier in the same volume."
1967.27,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1644.127,1645.969,I have to think about it Mr. Justice.
1967.27,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1647.256,1651.578,You may.
1967.27,1,22482,edward_f_howrey,,1652.571,1656.448,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1967.27,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1973.755,1982.75,But you don't have any question Mr. Howrey about the congressional intent here being inconsistent with what the Commission did.
1967.27,1,22482,edward_f_howrey,,2031.935,2048.822,"Basically, Mr. Justice Fortas, that is correct but I do not believe that it would interpret the statute differently from the words which the statute used which is â€˜competing customers'."
1967.27,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2088.28,2091.328,"But that doesn't help you at all, does it?"
1967.27,1,22482,edward_f_howrey,,2126.406,2127.015,Not the slightest --
1967.27,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2127.015,2130.929,Then the 2(d) allowance would have to be offered.
1967.27,1,22482,edward_f_howrey,,2139.006,2141.489,"Well, the Court of Appeals if that's what you're saying."
1967.27,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2409.102,2426.895,"Why shouldn't every retailer competing with the direct retailer or purchaser to get that opportunity to get that $350, that's what -- isn't that the intent of the Act by getting the barbarous language."
1967.27,1,22482,edward_f_howrey,,2426.895,2432.927,"Well, if the intent of the Act is proportionalize based on dollar volume or --"
1967.27,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2432.927,2450.298,"I understand that but I say that here, what's happening is that $350 is given for a page and that if any retailer wants to provide the same service or to be able to get the $350 and that's the theory of the Act."
1967.27,1,22482,edward_f_howrey,,2450.298,2452.357,That's the theory of the Act.
1967.27,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2453.385,2463.869,It's not that the wholesaler in getting and then fragmented as you've stated and that's my problem (Voice Overlap) the Commission's approach to this --
1967.27,1,22482,edward_f_howrey,,2463.869,2479.288,The Government as -- I mean the Federal Trade Commission and its order hasn't provided the retailer to get it and the Government in its brief rejects the dissenting opinion.
1967.27,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2809.07,2813.07,"I merely haven't quite got that facet, Mr. Howrey."
1967.27,1,22482,edward_f_howrey,,2871.575,2873.793,I don't think the Act says that here.
1967.27,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3068.621,3069.776,Mr. Friedman.
1967.27,2,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,3069.776,3072.96,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
