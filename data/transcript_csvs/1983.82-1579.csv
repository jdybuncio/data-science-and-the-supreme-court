1983.82-1579,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,12.259,We will hear arguments first this morning in Hayfield Northern Railroad Company against the Chicago and North Western Transportation Company.
1983.82-1579,0,38524,robert_s_abdalian,,19.995,23.756,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1983.82-1579,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,58.1,62.851,"Counsel, just what it now at issue in the case?"
1983.82-1579,0,38524,robert_s_abdalian,,64.373,65.403,That's correct.
1983.82-1579,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,73.62,79.972,Do your people propose to put down new rails?
1983.82-1579,0,38524,robert_s_abdalian,,79.972,80.994,That's correct.
1983.82-1579,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,476.146,488.213,"Are you saying, counsel, that after the commission has acted as it has here, that there is nothing in the case except some real estate with some iron rails resting on it?"
1983.82-1579,0,38524,robert_s_abdalian,,489.693,490.574,--That's correct.
1983.82-1579,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,490.574,491.516,It isn't a carrier any more.
1983.82-1579,0,38524,robert_s_abdalian,,491.516,492.615,Excuse me?
1983.82-1579,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,492.615,494.087,It's not a carrier any more.
1983.82-1579,0,38524,robert_s_abdalian,,494.087,495.076,That's correct.
1983.82-1579,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,656.413,672.583,"Will the new company, will your client, in starting rail service if you win this case have to get another certificate from the ICC?"
1983.82-1579,0,38524,robert_s_abdalian,,672.583,678.918,"That's correct, a certificate of public convenience and necessity, and we would have to--"
1983.82-1579,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,678.918,686.282,Even though just a short while ago the Commission authorized the abandonment of the line?
1983.82-1579,0,38524,robert_s_abdalian,,686.282,689.314,"--That's correct, that's correct."
1983.82-1579,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,703.293,711.939,Would that mean that... would you be litigating the same issue that were litigated in the abandonment proceeding?
1983.82-1579,0,38524,robert_s_abdalian,,711.939,713.351,"--No, not at all."
1983.82-1579,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,726.658,731.43,"Well, did it find that the public interest and necessity did not require the use of the railroad?"
1983.82-1579,0,38524,robert_s_abdalian,,731.43,731.921,--That's correct.
1983.82-1579,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,736.936,741.258,But now it'll have to find that the public interest and necessity requires that it be started again?
1983.82-1579,0,38524,robert_s_abdalian,,741.258,747.422,"--Not required, but permits, which is an easier standard under the Act."
1983.82-1579,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,765.484,771.497,"After the abandonment, can the carrier sell the property to you?"
1983.82-1579,0,38524,robert_s_abdalian,,771.497,777.782,The carrier can sell the property if a state interest doesn't surface.
1983.82-1579,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,777.782,779.472,Does it need ICC approval?
1983.82-1579,0,38524,robert_s_abdalian,,779.472,783.285,It does not need ICC approval.
1983.82-1579,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,804.691,807.772,Did your client make any effect to buy the property from the carrier?
1983.82-1579,0,38524,robert_s_abdalian,,807.772,808.541,"--No, not at all."
1983.82-1579,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,828.895,855.462,Suppose as part of the balance that you spoke of that the Commission arrives at it was determined or it was proposed by the railroad and approved by the ICC that rails were going to be taken up and used in another segment by the carrier and that was in contemplation.
1983.82-1579,0,38524,robert_s_abdalian,,862.507,884.794,"If the Interstate Commerce Commission conditioned the abandonment on the CNW's taking its rail lines and taking it from Hayfield someplace else because interstate commerce interests required that, that would be a different case."
1983.82-1579,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,884.794,885.843,That's not this one.
1983.82-1579,0,38524,robert_s_abdalian,,885.843,887.255,That's not this case--
1983.82-1579,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,1032.82,1035.021,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the court:
1983.82-1579,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1264.702,1269.127,"How long do those opportunity costs run, forever?"
1983.82-1579,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,1269.127,1275.512,I believe that the Commission's determination is essentially retrospective or contemporaneous.
1983.82-1579,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1284.177,1285.87,Would that still be true ten years from now?
1983.82-1579,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,1285.87,1293.844,"If there were a federal service requirement that required the service, the railroad to maintain the service and therefore prohibited other use--"
1983.82-1579,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1293.844,1301.738,"I mean as to this particular property, if there is an opportunity, how long will that exist?"
1983.82-1579,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,1301.738,1307.753,--It would exist up to the time that the ICC's abandonment certificate takes effect.
1983.82-1579,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1307.753,1308.714,"Well, that's over."
1983.82-1579,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,1308.714,1310.096,"And that's over, that's correct."
1983.82-1579,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1310.096,1311.696,So it doesn't exist.
1983.82-1579,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,1311.696,1312.587,That's correct.
1983.82-1579,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1399.083,1419.865,"Are you saying, Mr. Levy, that at the present time, once the ICC has acted and there is no longer a railroad, that the Minnesota Railroad and Warehouse Commission would have no authority to tell them they must run an intrastate line?"
1983.82-1579,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,1419.865,1425.12,"Well, intrastate lines are subject to the jurisdiction of the ICC."
1983.82-1579,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1425.12,1439.92,"They're subject to, but could the Minnesota Railroad and Warehouse Commission have any authority at all with respect to ordering the continuance of this line?"
1983.82-1579,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,1439.92,1440.729,"No, it couldn't."
1983.82-1579,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1445.974,1447.284,Let me ask one question.
1983.82-1579,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,1454.309,1461.473,I think there's no question it would have the authority if it found such a condition to be necessary or appropriate to the interests of the interstate rail system.
1983.82-1579,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1461.473,1463.596,Part of its balance of why it was willing to allow the abandonment.
1983.82-1579,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,1463.596,1464.594,That's exactly right.
1983.82-1579,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1464.594,1465.816,Does it over do that?
1983.82-1579,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,1465.816,1470.501,I'm not aware of any incident where it can be definitively said that the Commission did it.
1983.82-1579,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1483.158,1486.701,And that case is still pending in the Second Circuit.
1983.82-1579,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,1486.701,1488.361,--I wasn't aware of that.
1983.82-1579,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1489.853,1491.273,It's been pending there for 20 years.
1983.82-1579,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,1491.273,1494.625,--I think this was a first Circuit decision that is long since over.
1983.82-1579,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1524.324,1527.627,"Mr. Levy, you've mentioned equipment several times."
1983.82-1579,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,1529.958,1532.609,I mean that only in the generic sense.
1983.82-1579,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1532.609,1536.082,Only the rail and real estate--
1983.82-1579,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,1536.082,1536.803,I'm sorry?
1983.82-1579,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1536.803,1542.567,"--Only the land and the rail, which I suppose must be viewed as a fixture, are at issue?"
1983.82-1579,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,1542.567,1550.992,"I think that's right, although I can't say authoritatively that there may not be some incidental pieces of property used in connection with the track at issue."
1983.82-1579,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1556.104,1563.23,Ms. Keating.
1983.82-1579,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1563.23,1568.483,"Ms. Keating, at the outset will you explain to me why the railroad is opposing this."
1983.82-1579,2,16362,anne_e_keating,,1571.826,1574.558,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1983.82-1579,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1614.986,1621.31,I quite understand why the railroad would wish to abandon a line on which it was losing a lot of money.
1983.82-1579,2,16362,anne_e_keating,,1628.453,1649.416,"--Well, Your Honor, we believe... first of all, I should preface that there has been previous indications in the record that the principals and incorporators of the Hayfield Northern Railroad, the Appellant, were members of this Minnesota shippers group that invoked Section 10905 before the Commission."
1983.82-1579,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1649.416,1654.041,But wouldn't you like to keep the shippers feeding on a feeder line?
1983.82-1579,2,16362,anne_e_keating,,1656.372,1665.979,"Your Honor, in the meantime... when we received abandonment authority, at that point the finding is put into the Federal Register."
1983.82-1579,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1702.683,1705.666,Are you saying you're afraid you'll get a lower price under state condemnation?
1983.82-1579,2,16362,anne_e_keating,,1705.666,1707.566,"Your Honor, that is a possibility."
1983.82-1579,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1729.111,1733.763,"What has your client got to lose, specifically, if he loses?"
1983.82-1579,2,16362,anne_e_keating,,1733.763,1738.427,"--Your Honor, in the meantime from receiving our final abandonment certificate, which was in November--"
1983.82-1579,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1738.427,1739.647,You've received that?
1983.82-1579,2,16362,anne_e_keating,,1739.647,1740.618,"--Yes, sir."
1983.82-1579,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1817.679,1820.521,"As of now, you could use it elsewhere."
1983.82-1579,2,16362,anne_e_keating,,1820.521,1822.06,"Yes, sir."
1983.82-1579,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1822.06,1822.962,In this case.
1983.82-1579,2,16362,anne_e_keating,,1822.962,1824.013,"Yes, sir."
1983.82-1579,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1857.163,1859.667,"You're talking only about the rail, aren't you?"
1983.82-1579,2,16362,anne_e_keating,,1859.667,1866.951,"In this particular situation, Your Honor, it was 115-pound rail, which was very reusable."
1983.82-1579,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1896.78,1901.672,"Well, why wasn't that all taken up in the ICC in the abandonment?"
1983.82-1579,2,16362,anne_e_keating,,1901.672,1905.996,"Your Honor, we submit that Section--"
1983.82-1579,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1905.996,1912.601,"I get the impression that somebody made a mistake in the abandonment, namely the railroad."
1983.82-1579,2,16362,anne_e_keating,,1912.601,1914.201,"--Well, Your Honor, we believe--"
1983.82-1579,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1914.201,1915.753,Did you make a mistake?
1983.82-1579,2,16362,anne_e_keating,,1915.753,1917.663,"--No, I don't believe, Your Honor--"
1983.82-1579,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1945.733,1952.308,"But if you get in the condemnation the fair value of the rails, why don't you come out ever?"
1983.82-1579,2,16362,anne_e_keating,,1952.308,1968.438,"Well, Your Honor, I believe the Eighth Circuit has indicated that there's a delay that could be caused, because we have to remember that in this situation, though the Hayfield Northern obtained its temporary restraining order in April of 1982, it has yet to file a condemnation action."
1983.82-1579,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1975.834,1977.623,Isn't that covered by the bond?
1983.82-1579,2,16362,anne_e_keating,,1977.623,1981.146,"--Your Honor, we had in the state court--"
1983.82-1579,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1981.146,1982.726,"You have a lawsuit on the bond if you win, don't you?"
1983.82-1579,2,16362,anne_e_keating,,1982.726,1995.184,"--We had in the state court a $2,000 bond, and a $100,000 bond was issued in the Eighth Circuit for property that was valued at the Commission at $1.7 million."
1983.82-1579,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1995.184,1997.886,"Yes, but if you ultimately win you would get the property."
1983.82-1579,2,16362,anne_e_keating,,1999.548,2005.823,"In this particular instance, there was the temporary restraining order."
1983.82-1579,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2020.964,2023.488,"Well, the rail's gone, isn't it?"
1983.82-1579,2,16362,anne_e_keating,,2023.488,2024.92,"Yes, Your Honor, it is."
1983.82-1579,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2024.92,2028.983,"So the condemnation action isn't going to condemn the rail, isn't it?"
1983.82-1579,2,16362,anne_e_keating,,2028.983,2046.808,"At this point, Your Honor, the major controversy I expect would be whether the injunction was proper to begin with and whether or not there are damages that should be available to the railroad as a result of the delay."
1983.82-1579,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2046.808,2048.621,"But you're going to keep the rail anyway, in any event."
1983.82-1579,2,16362,anne_e_keating,,2048.621,2051.165,"The rail has been reused, Your Honor."
1983.82-1579,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2051.165,2055.398,"But the state still wants to condemn whatever is there, I take it, is that right?"
1983.82-1579,2,16362,anne_e_keating,,2055.398,2058.46,"This is what counsel for Appellant has indicated, Your Honor."
1983.82-1579,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2058.46,2074.753,Is there any reason why the North Western after the line has been abandoned should be immune from the vicissitudes of state condemnation action like delay that every other property owner in Minnesota is subjected to?
1983.82-1579,2,16362,anne_e_keating,,2074.753,2087.883,"Well, we believe that the federal system that was created under 10905 is a separate and unique system and that is the exclusive method for continued rail service."
1983.82-1579,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2116.621,2130.512,"What if Hayfield had made its move three years after the abandonment certificate, and the North Western was just doing nothing with its rails."
1983.82-1579,2,16362,anne_e_keating,,2134.433,2148.871,"--Well, Your Honor, in the history of our abandonments... and we've, in the last 15 years, had several thousand miles of abandonments... we have always attempted to remove our materials as quickly as possible."
1983.82-1579,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2184.885,2190.098,"Is part of your case right now that the right of way... you still own some real estate, don't you?"
1983.82-1579,2,16362,anne_e_keating,,2190.098,2191.24,"Yes, Your Honor."
1983.82-1579,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2192.98,2199.425,Is part of your case that Minnesota may not condemn or that Hayfield may not condemn the right of way?
1983.82-1579,2,16362,anne_e_keating,,2199.425,2201.288,"Well, I think--"
1983.82-1579,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2201.288,2205.84,"Isn't that a yes or no case, answer?"
1983.82-1579,2,16362,anne_e_keating,,2213.925,2220.419,"--We're talking about an intact rail line, that is the procedure of 10905."
1983.82-1579,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2221.07,2225.133,"Well, the railroad, that rail line, is not intact now."
1983.82-1579,2,16362,anne_e_keating,,2225.133,2226.102,--I agree with you.
1983.82-1579,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2226.102,2229.014,The rail is off and the ties are gone.
1983.82-1579,2,16362,anne_e_keating,,2233.548,2235.348,It would be subject to condemnation.
1983.82-1579,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2246.526,2247.016,I know.
1983.82-1579,2,16362,anne_e_keating,,2276.596,2278.446,"--No, Your Honor, because Section 10905--"
1983.82-1579,3,38524,robert_s_abdalian,,3058.36,3076.812,"If there is a reasonable time in which the rail ties and track should be left intact... or not intact; in which the CNW could remove the rail ties, that should have been asked."
1983.82-1579,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3168.413,3170.005,"Thank you, counsel."
