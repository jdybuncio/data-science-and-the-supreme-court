2005.05-5705,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,3.813,We'll hear argument next in Hammon v. Indiana.
2005.05-5705,0,39264,richard__d_friedman,,4.922,7.641,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
2005.05-5705,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,64.873,75.75,"When, for example, there's an undercover agent, a law enforcement officer... let's think of the mafia or the Ku Klux Klan reveals himself."
2005.05-5705,0,39264,richard__d_friedman,,90.519,94.535,"Statements in furtherance of a conspiracy, if I understand--"
2005.05-5705,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,94.535,95.254,Yes.
2005.05-5705,0,39264,richard__d_friedman,,110.272,111.601,--If it's an undercover law enforcement--
2005.05-5705,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,111.601,111.945,But known.
2005.05-5705,0,39264,richard__d_friedman,,111.945,114.617,"--By... by known, I mean to the declarant."
2005.05-5705,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,114.617,115.336,Yes.
2005.05-5705,0,39264,richard__d_friedman,,115.336,117.336,"By known, I mean to the declarant."
2005.05-5705,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,117.821,118.336,Yes.
2005.05-5705,0,39264,richard__d_friedman,,118.336,122.354,--if it's an undercover agent and so it's a statement to an undercover--
2005.05-5705,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,122.354,123.792,So you're saying my hypothetical could never come up.
2005.05-5705,0,39264,richard__d_friedman,,139.935,144.843,--I... I'm afraid I... I don't fully understand the hypothetical.
2005.05-5705,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,152.438,152.798,He's known.
2005.05-5705,0,39264,richard__d_friedman,,152.798,158.503,--If he's... he's known to the law enforcement officer and the member of the conspiracy is making a--
2005.05-5705,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,158.503,159.518,It's continuing.
2005.05-5705,0,39264,richard__d_friedman,,159.518,169.145,"--It's a continuing conspiracy, but... but that statement to the law enforcement officer saying that somebody else in the conspiracy has committed a crime, would not, in fact, be in furtherance of the conspiracy."
2005.05-5705,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,170.599,170.911,All right.
2005.05-5705,0,39264,richard__d_friedman,,173.365,186.477,"I... I don't think it's... Your Honor, I feel duty bound to say there are no bad hypotheticals, but there are... there are easy ones, and I think if... if it's a known officer... it's... in that situation, it's going to be accusatorial."
2005.05-5705,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,188.633,198.776,"What if a statement is made to a known law enforcement officer providing information that's... that's very incriminating against somebody, but it doesn't specifically identify that person?"
2005.05-5705,0,39264,richard__d_friedman,,200.527,202.027,--I... I believe it does.
2005.05-5705,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,207.513,212.341,So it's an accusation even though it doesn't identify the person who is alleged to be the perpetrator?
2005.05-5705,0,39264,richard__d_friedman,,212.341,214.732,We could call it what we will.
2005.05-5705,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,221.688,227.94,"So really, your test is any evidence that's... any statement made to the police or... is an... is testimony."
2005.05-5705,0,39264,richard__d_friedman,,227.94,228.33,"--No, Your Honor."
2005.05-5705,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,235.925,239.472,Any relevant evidence given to law enforcement is testimonial.
2005.05-5705,0,39264,richard__d_friedman,,239.472,251.241,"--Well, when you say... when you say relevant, I think that if the law enforcement officer... if... if it's a statement to a known law enforcement officer in the line of duty, it's... it's almost always going to be testimonial."
2005.05-5705,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,262.852,274.09,"If somebody calls and says, I just saw a blue Toyota with Ohio plates commit a hit and run, that's testimonial?"
2005.05-5705,0,39264,richard__d_friedman,,274.09,275.98,--I believe... I believe so.
2005.05-5705,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,298.626,301.298,"But if it's relevant that Jack is back in town, then that's testimonial."
2005.05-5705,0,39264,richard__d_friedman,,301.298,313.442,"If... if at the moment that it's made, the declarant understands that Jack being back in town might be useful in an investigation, or if a reasonable person in the position of the declarant would understand it, that would be testimonial."
2005.05-5705,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,326.929,335.728,And the people who are making all these statements are... are to be understood as witnesses against somebody within the... the language of the Confrontation Clause?
2005.05-5705,0,39264,richard__d_friedman,,335.728,352.389,"I think within the... within the meaning of the Confrontation Clause, if those statements are allowed at proof... as proof at trial without the person coming in, then what we have essentially done is created a system by which people can create evidence for use by the legal system, by engaging those statements without coming into court."
2005.05-5705,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,387.271,388.615,Statutes that... that say what?
2005.05-5705,0,39264,richard__d_friedman,,388.615,406.743,"That say... that say accusations to a... made to a law enforcement officer, in the case of Oregon and the pending Michigan bill, accusations of domestic violence are admissible so long as they are made reasonably freshly... but they give a 24-hour time frame... they... they are admissible."
2005.05-5705,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,424.029,424.935,And those... those--
2005.05-5705,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,424.935,429.373,And... and what... what is the theory on which the statutes are... are adopted?
2005.05-5705,0,39264,richard__d_friedman,,429.373,430.139,The--
2005.05-5705,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,430.139,433.858,What's the argument that they propose to say it's not testimonial?
2005.05-5705,0,39264,richard__d_friedman,,435.171,439.907,"--Justice Kennedy, the... I don't think there is a theory."
2005.05-5705,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,463.38,468.413,What's... what's worrying me on this is... I'll tell you my concern without the hypothetical.
2005.05-5705,0,39264,richard__d_friedman,,527.816,529.144,"--Your Honor, let... let me be very clear."
2005.05-5705,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,552.838,570.092,"--Such as in Crawford, but in Crawford, it was the kind of formal statement, the Court said, materials such as affidavits, custodial examinations, prior testimony that the defendant was unable to cross examine, or similar pretrial statements."
2005.05-5705,0,39264,richard__d_friedman,,589.815,590.612,Right.
2005.05-5705,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,601.631,602.068,Yes.
2005.05-5705,0,39264,richard__d_friedman,,607.881,608.632,Right.
2005.05-5705,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,608.632,610.43,Not... not the totality of--
2005.05-5705,0,39264,richard__d_friedman,,610.43,625.448,"Certainly not the totality, and if you say, well, this statement was informal, it... it doesn't make sense and I think it conflicts with a comment in Crawford in footnote 3 to say, well, informal testimony is... is okay, as the Court said in... in Crawford."
2005.05-5705,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,665.973,686.15,Did the legislatures that have passed laws of the kind you describe have before them information that there is a rather high incidence of the victim being intimidated and therefore not showing up in court to testify?
2005.05-5705,0,39264,richard__d_friedman,,686.15,698.605,"Your... Your Honor, in the... in the Old Bailey sessions papers there were approximately 2 percent of the cases, the victim who was the prosecutor did not show up."
2005.05-5705,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,735.926,750.179,"--Well, you... you have to assume not only that the victim is unwilling or reluctant to testify, you have to assume that the victim has disappeared because the victim, unwilling or not, could be subpoenaed."
2005.05-5705,0,39264,richard__d_friedman,,751.429,763.15,"The... the victim could be subpoenaed, and in... in this case, as in Davis, the victim was subpoenaed, but subpoenas have to be enforced."
2005.05-5705,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,771.652,784.905,"No, but I'm saying the scope of the problem is... is much more narrow than what is suggested by simply describing how often it is that the... that the complaining witness is reluctant to testify."
2005.05-5705,0,39264,richard__d_friedman,,787.093,787.359,--Well--
2005.05-5705,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,787.359,790.125,"Reluctant or not, that witness can be... can be subpoenaed."
2005.05-5705,0,39264,richard__d_friedman,,790.125,792.563,"--That is... that is correct, Justice Scalia."
2005.05-5705,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,833.681,837.026,I don't know why the or would necessarily follow.
2005.05-5705,0,39264,richard__d_friedman,,849.121,849.638,They--
2005.05-5705,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,849.638,851.841,Nothing at all compels the State to do that.
2005.05-5705,0,39264,richard__d_friedman,,851.841,856.406,"--They... they would not be compelled to do that, but... they would not be compelled constitutionally to do that."
2005.05-5705,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,864.22,868.048,"Your point, I thought, was that that would be the incentive for--"
2005.05-5705,0,39264,richard__d_friedman,,868.048,868.705,That... that--
2005.05-5705,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,868.705,869.877,"--for police departments, of course--"
2005.05-5705,0,39264,richard__d_friedman,,869.877,871.346,--That... that... that is correct.
2005.05-5705,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,871.346,871.877,--if they want to make their cases.
2005.05-5705,0,39264,richard__d_friedman,,871.877,872.424,That is correct.
2005.05-5705,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,886.427,889.474,What about present sense perceptions?
2005.05-5705,0,39264,richard__d_friedman,,890.631,892.882,And... and--
2005.05-5705,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,892.882,896.664,Apparently 803(1) has the first exception--
2005.05-5705,0,39264,richard__d_friedman,,896.664,897.008,--Right.
2005.05-5705,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,897.008,897.68,--to the hearsay rule.
2005.05-5705,0,39264,richard__d_friedman,,899.446,899.711,Yes.
2005.05-5705,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,899.711,910.307,"So on the phone, somebody is describing very calmly... very calmly to the policeman the terrible crime that he sees going on in front of him."
2005.05-5705,0,39264,richard__d_friedman,,918.214,921.402,"Well, it would have been under Roberts presumably."
2005.05-5705,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,921.402,922.201,Yes.
2005.05-5705,0,39264,richard__d_friedman,,932.28,933.219,It's... it's an exception.
2005.05-5705,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,935.906,937.751,"Well, there it is, 803(1)."
2005.05-5705,0,39264,richard__d_friedman,,937.751,938.126,--That's right.
2005.05-5705,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,938.126,939.783,"I mean, and you practiced this for years."
2005.05-5705,0,39264,richard__d_friedman,,951.425,963.491,"Yes, but until... until White v. Illinois basically let the guard down, these... these statements could not come... accusatory statements that might have been in present sense impressions did not... were... were not the basis for prosecutions."
2005.05-5705,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,969.664,979.009,"--So if we adopt your rule, a person calls up on the phone and says, I'm here at the baseball game, there's a terrible crime going on in front of me, and he describes it--"
2005.05-5705,0,39264,richard__d_friedman,,979.009,979.634,Right.
2005.05-5705,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,979.634,981.854,"--to the police officer, that no longer could come in."
2005.05-5705,0,39264,richard__d_friedman,,981.854,985.261,I... I believe that is correct because that--
2005.05-5705,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,985.261,985.933,I should hope not.
2005.05-5705,0,39264,richard__d_friedman,,987.199,988.105,--It... it shouldn't.
2005.05-5705,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1006.109,1006.438,"No, no."
2005.05-5705,0,39264,richard__d_friedman,,1007.422,1007.969,Yes.
2005.05-5705,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1007.969,1008.61,--trying to reduct you out of--
2005.05-5705,0,39264,richard__d_friedman,,1008.61,1008.844,Right.
2005.05-5705,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1008.844,1011.533,--I just wanted to know what the facts are about the rule.
2005.05-5705,0,39264,richard__d_friedman,,1013.235,1020.831,The... the rule is that the hearsay law... the rule against hearsay provides... the modern rule against hearsay provides no... no restriction.
2005.05-5705,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1056.621,1059.325,--Edmund Burke say that?
2005.05-5705,0,39264,richard__d_friedman,,1059.325,1062.122,"Edmund Burke said that, yes."
2005.05-5705,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1062.122,1080.063,"Mr. Friedman, can I go back to your answer that the police will then... in response to the position that you're urging, will then protect the victim and all these fine things?"
2005.05-5705,0,39264,richard__d_friedman,,1101.287,1105.616,"Well, I... I hope not, Your Honor, and I... I believe that we've gotten past the point."
2005.05-5705,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1148.468,1150.469,"That's very powerfully hard to prove, isn't it?"
2005.05-5705,0,39264,richard__d_friedman,,1150.469,1151.953,"--I don't think so, Your Honor."
2005.05-5705,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1173.443,1180.054,"But you are back... as Justice Breyer pointed earlier, you're making the prosecution prove two crimes instead of one."
2005.05-5705,0,39264,richard__d_friedman,,1180.054,1185.633,"--Well, intimidation is... is a crime, but it wouldn't... it wouldn't be a full criminal case."
2005.05-5705,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1199.354,1208.592,"Well, but every evidentiary problem, the... the root of the problem is not the inability of the... or the unwillingness of the primary victim to testify."
2005.05-5705,0,39264,richard__d_friedman,,1222.359,1227.22,"--Well, it... it would remain for the Court to determine what the standards are for proving--"
2005.05-5705,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1227.22,1229.298,"Well, you wouldn't have to prove beyond a reasonable doubt, would you?"
2005.05-5705,0,39264,richard__d_friedman,,1229.298,1229.642,--I... I--
2005.05-5705,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1229.642,1236.425,This is a criminal... this is a pretrial hearing on whether the... the... there's been intimidation.
2005.05-5705,0,39264,richard__d_friedman,,1241.771,1245.615,--Prior decisions of the Court suggest that that would most likely be the... the standard.
2005.05-5705,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1246.303,1249.163,"But the... the judge can't make that finding if the witness doesn't testify, can he?"
2005.05-5705,0,39264,richard__d_friedman,,1249.163,1253.476,"--Oh, I think that... that the judge may well, and I think it would remain--"
2005.05-5705,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1253.476,1254.022,How's that?
2005.05-5705,0,39264,richard__d_friedman,,1269.416,1276.231,--I think it remains an open question what the standards would be for... for proof and whether that would be constitutionally accepted.
2005.05-5705,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1315.74,1317.786,Do you have a second choice rule?
2005.05-5705,0,39264,richard__d_friedman,,1321.975,1322.225,Yes.
2005.05-5705,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1322.225,1330.133,"We have the rule that you just enunciated, and I don't want, before you sit down, to... I want to find out if you have an intermediate position, a fall back position."
2005.05-5705,0,39264,richard__d_friedman,,1330.133,1340.574,"Well, our... our narrow rule is... is simply the... an accusation to a law enforcement officer."
2005.05-5705,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1395.866,1402.555,Where... where do you come out on the person running out of the house and yelling to her neighbor with the law enforcement officer standing by?
2005.05-5705,0,39264,richard__d_friedman,,1402.555,1403.571,And... and--
2005.05-5705,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1403.571,1407.697,"It's not... the statement is not to the law enforcement officer, but he or she overhears it."
2005.05-5705,0,39264,richard__d_friedman,,1407.697,1412.635,--If... if the... if the speaker knows that the law enforcement officer is there--
2005.05-5705,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1412.635,1412.932,Doesn't.
2005.05-5705,0,39264,richard__d_friedman,,1412.932,1419.277,--then... then I... then... then it's not within the narrow categorical rule for which we're... we're asking now.
2005.05-5705,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1422.356,1425.779,Is anybody... is anybody working for the State a law enforcement officer?
2005.05-5705,0,39264,richard__d_friedman,,1425.779,1432.187,"No, not... not within the... within the narrow categorical rule that we're asking."
2005.05-5705,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1438.157,1441.329,Or a 911 operator who was an agent of... of the police.
2005.05-5705,0,39264,richard__d_friedman,,1441.329,1446.392,"--A 911 operator is a direct conduit to the police, and the police are a direct conduit to the court."
2005.05-5705,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1476.431,1478.29,--I'm not sure what... what sense it makes.
2005.05-5705,0,39264,richard__d_friedman,,1493.95,1496.56,"--Well, I'm... I'm not saying there necessarily should be a difference."
2005.05-5705,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1497.889,1501.436,"Well, I thought your test was if she knows that he's a police officer, it's testimonial."
2005.05-5705,0,39264,richard__d_friedman,,1501.436,1503.03,--We're saying that is an easy case.
2005.05-5705,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1506.64,1507.75,"Well, let me put it this way."
2005.05-5705,0,39264,richard__d_friedman,,1509.532,1516.564,I think it's an easier case because the police officer is a direct conduit to the... to the machinery of... of justice.
2005.05-5705,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1523.363,1524.363,"Thank you, counsel."
2005.05-5705,1,42698,thomas_m_fisher,,1528.208,1531.474,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
2005.05-5705,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1549.212,1554.745,"She's sitting down at... at a table, as I recall it, with the... with the police officer on the other side of the table."
2005.05-5705,1,42698,thomas_m_fisher,,1554.745,1556.011,She... yes.
2005.05-5705,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1556.011,1556.902,Has a cup of coffee.
2005.05-5705,1,42698,thomas_m_fisher,,1556.902,1557.839,"Well, I don't know about that."
2005.05-5705,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1558.511,1559.887,"I thought there was a cup of coffee, too."
2005.05-5705,1,42698,thomas_m_fisher,,1563.684,1564.652,"--Well, what we know is that the--"
2005.05-5705,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1564.652,1569.748,It didn't seem to me a terribly emergency situation in... in that kind of a context.
2005.05-5705,1,42698,thomas_m_fisher,,1569.748,1571.139,"--I respectfully disagree, Your Honor."
2005.05-5705,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1586.657,1589.315,"At the time, the officer is right there in the house."
2005.05-5705,1,42698,thomas_m_fisher,,1602.286,1613.476,"Well, I think it's... the... the moment to consider is not just the moment when the officers are present, but in fact, what would happen if the officers were to do nothing, which is one of the choices that, I suppose, the officers have."
2005.05-5705,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1687.289,1692.946,"Isn't... isn't the problem, though... I mean, as Crawford said, those examples defined the core."
2005.05-5705,1,42698,thomas_m_fisher,,1707.59,1714.232,"--Your Honor, I think the important lesson from Crawford in that regard is... is the methodology, and the methodology was let's look at history."
2005.05-5705,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1740.269,1753.772,"Well, I'm not sure that that was the only concern of the Founders, I mean, the... the... you know, the... the fact that... that the State could corrupt the... the statement through the interrogation."
2005.05-5705,1,42698,thomas_m_fisher,,1804.377,1813.91,"--Well, except that we do know that... that affidavits, I agree, would have been prohibited, and that's one of the classic forms of testimony, indeed, that was enumerated in Crawford and that was kept out at the founding."
2005.05-5705,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1816.488,1823.177,But one of the reasons for that is... let's assume you had a completely honest police officer.
2005.05-5705,1,42698,thomas_m_fisher,,1832.774,1835.477,"Well, I think it ostensibly could be."
2005.05-5705,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1852.949,1860.95,But I'm suggesting to you that it often happens that there are false charges made that the... that the police believe to be true.
2005.05-5705,1,42698,thomas_m_fisher,,1860.95,1863.578,The false charges scenario is--
2005.05-5705,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1863.578,1867.969,And this is fully consistent with prohibiting testimonial statements.
2005.05-5705,1,42698,thomas_m_fisher,,1867.969,1884.55,"--Again, I think what Crawford was talking about, in terms of trying to understand the Confrontation Clause, was not simply to hypothesize various problems that different types of evidence could present if it weren't cross examined, but instead to examine more particularly what the Founders were concerned about."
2005.05-5705,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1888.144,1889.394,"May I ask this, Mr. Fisher?"
2005.05-5705,1,42698,thomas_m_fisher,,1897.46,1900.398,"--I think that... well, certainly it's testimonial, and so--"
2005.05-5705,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1900.398,1902.788,So that would be prohibited by the Confrontation Clause.
2005.05-5705,1,42698,thomas_m_fisher,,1906.992,1908.93,"--Well, whether it would have come in--"
2005.05-5705,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1908.93,1910.947,"I mean, it doesn't resemble it is what I'm saying."
2005.05-5705,1,42698,thomas_m_fisher,,1910.947,1914.525,--Whether it would have been a problem under the Marian practice I think is only part of the story.
2005.05-5705,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1930.139,1936.421,"Before you leave that, surely the affidavit isn't... isn't what's magical."
2005.05-5705,1,42698,thomas_m_fisher,,1951.33,1957.487,"--Well, I... I don't know that I would because, again, you've got the... you've got the form that Crawford was concerned about."
2005.05-5705,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1958.957,1959.645,That would make no sense at all.
2005.05-5705,1,42698,thomas_m_fisher,,1969.663,1971.694,"Well, I don't know that the analysis has to end there."
2005.05-5705,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1990.651,1992.808,"Mr. Fisher, let me again be sure I understand your position."
2005.05-5705,1,42698,thomas_m_fisher,,1999.903,2007.811,"I think that there is evidence historically that a letter would be testimonial, certainly coming out of Cobham's case and... and other circumstances."
2005.05-5705,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2007.811,2009.748,So then you don't rely on the affidavit point.
2005.05-5705,1,42698,thomas_m_fisher,,2009.748,2013.28,"Well, I think it's... it's a matter of what... what is covered, what is mentioned in history."
2005.05-5705,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2021.095,2025.175,"If that's your criterion, are you going to draw the distinction between the letter and the tape recording?"
2005.05-5705,1,42698,thomas_m_fisher,,2025.175,2034.989,"--Well, I think that that is the... whether we have the resemblance test doesn't require us to answer that question because I think that the examination the Court would undertake would again--"
2005.05-5705,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2034.989,2035.521,"Well, let's answer it."
2005.05-5705,1,42698,thomas_m_fisher,,2039.865,2053.617,"--I think it's... I think it is very similar to the letter and... and could well be inadmissible, but I don't know that it's... if the Court adheres to the test that it set forth in Crawford, that it's looking for forms of testimony that were prohibited at common law, certainly that would not have been one of them."
2005.05-5705,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2053.617,2057.963,A videotape... a videotape of a crime scene is admissible.
2005.05-5705,1,42698,thomas_m_fisher,,2058.166,2060.088,I think that's... that's right.
2005.05-5705,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2065.136,2065.386,Yes.
2005.05-5705,1,42698,thomas_m_fisher,,2065.386,2070.012,But a videotape of a crime scene again would be... would be not testimonial.
2005.05-5705,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2070.012,2077.951,"But a tape recording by the same person who videotaped the crime scene, describing what he saw, you agree would be excluded."
2005.05-5705,1,42698,thomas_m_fisher,,2077.951,2080.029,I think that there's a high chance that could be... be excluded.
2005.05-5705,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2080.029,2081.889,So what's the test?
2005.05-5705,1,42698,thomas_m_fisher,,2081.889,2083.358,"It's the resemblance test, and the question--"
2005.05-5705,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2083.358,2085.108,Resemblance to?
2005.05-5705,1,42698,thomas_m_fisher,,2085.108,2087.563,--To the historical abuses that the Founders were trying to address.
2005.05-5705,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2088.266,2088.704,Which were?
2005.05-5705,1,42698,thomas_m_fisher,,2088.704,2092.141,"--Well, which were in particular, we know, affidavits."
2005.05-5705,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2098.55,2099.862,Do you accept the Government's--
2005.05-5705,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2099.862,2101.598,I think the problem with the examples is that none of these are abuses.
2005.05-5705,1,42698,thomas_m_fisher,,2108.036,2112.303,"Well, I think the abuse comes not simply in how they were created, but... but then in how they were later used."
2005.05-5705,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2121.93,2142.606,"--Why isn't the... the bright line that the Government asserts that this is a crime made in an urgent situation, when one doesn't... the declarant doesn't think rationally will this be used eventually in a trial, where the declarant wants to stop an imminent threat?"
2005.05-5705,1,42698,thomas_m_fisher,,2142.606,2148.122,--I certainly think that that follows from the... the overall test we propose.
2005.05-5705,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2148.122,2151.655,But that's a different test than the resemblance test that you're proposing.
2005.05-5705,1,42698,thomas_m_fisher,,2151.655,2153.921,Our position is it's a corollary to it.
2005.05-5705,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2203.432,2212.231,Was there... was there any showing at all of whether they made the police... or the prosecutor made any effort to enforce the subpoena?
2005.05-5705,1,42698,thomas_m_fisher,,2212.231,2214.621,"There was no such effort, Your Honor."
2005.05-5705,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2232.297,2244.41,"Well, let's assume your... you have here a woman who's sitting down in the kitchen with the police officer, talks to the police officer, and then signs an affidavit."
2005.05-5705,1,42698,thomas_m_fisher,,2246.347,2246.738,"That's right, yes."
2005.05-5705,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2246.738,2252.238,And that affidavit was not admissible because it's an affidavit.
2005.05-5705,1,42698,thomas_m_fisher,,2252.238,2253.52,Correct.
2005.05-5705,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2253.52,2265.023,"But the police officer who testified to what she said and what he wrote down in the affidavit that she signed, that does get in."
2005.05-5705,1,42698,thomas_m_fisher,,2265.023,2265.695,Correct.
2005.05-5705,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2265.695,2268.836,I... I can't see why that makes any sense at all.
2005.05-5705,1,42698,thomas_m_fisher,,2288.153,2296.248,"Well, I think whether you look at it from her perspective or from the officer's perspective, that something did change in the moment between the oral statement and the affidavit."
2005.05-5705,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2331.756,2334.257,"Well, but it's a... it's a classic mixed motive case."
2005.05-5705,1,42698,thomas_m_fisher,,2344.118,2353.339,"Well, I think it's reasonable to assume that officers, faced with an emergency situation, are primarily going to be working for... from a concern of safety, for their own and for others."
2005.05-5705,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2366.717,2368.108,Why does his motive matter?
2005.05-5705,1,42698,thomas_m_fisher,,2387.565,2423.714,"Well, let me be clear that we're not suggesting a subjective inquiry into the officer's motive, but what we are saying is that whether a statement is testimonial depends on whether the government is... is purely collecting evidence, making someone undergo an interrogation, for example, or whether they are performing tasks that really were not part of... of any type of police function at the founding, which is sort of a community caretaking, public safety function, so that by definition in eliciting statements concerning the immediate safety issue, the police officer could not have been engaged in the kinds of abuses that gave rise--"
2005.05-5705,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2423.714,2424.01,All right.
2005.05-5705,1,42698,thomas_m_fisher,,2459.581,2460.924,--I'm not sure if I'm following.
2005.05-5705,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2461.581,2470.208,"I'm making the distinction you're making between she's in tears, excited utterance or res gestae, around there, just what you were talking about."
2005.05-5705,1,42698,thomas_m_fisher,,2499.23,2510.545,"--Well, again, the... the difficult task of understanding the Confrontation Clause is to figure out what limits there might be, and... and in Crawford, the methodology was what does history tell us the Framers were concerned about."
2005.05-5705,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2542.928,2551.304,"But your answer, I take it, assumes that the Framers had no concern with the capacity of the court to test the... the validity or the truth of the statement."
2005.05-5705,1,42698,thomas_m_fisher,,2551.304,2556.148,"Well, I'm not entirely sure if that's the case."
2005.05-5705,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2570.901,2571.682,"Well, but... no."
2005.05-5705,1,42698,thomas_m_fisher,,2596.391,2607.41,"--I think it was with respect to... to the abuses that... testimony elicited through the abuses that gave rise to the clause, the... the common... or I'm sorry... the civil law type abuses."
2005.05-5705,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2610.02,2629.008,"So that your... your... you would then say they want a... they want to test certain... in certain cases where they think there may have been an abuse in the elicitation of the statement, but if there is... there is no reason to suspect that the statement was taken under untoward circumstances, they were not concerned to test its validity."
2005.05-5705,1,42698,thomas_m_fisher,,2629.008,2633.618,"--I think that... that that's largely accurate, but they were dealing with, I think, a rather set form."
2005.05-5705,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2633.618,2634.15,But is that your position?
2005.05-5705,1,42698,thomas_m_fisher,,2634.15,2653.779,"Well, yes, but... but if I may add a clarification, which is to say, the reason I think that we could circumscribe affidavits, regardless of whether the elicitation abuses are present, is simply for ease of administration, that abuses known to the Framers would have been arising in the circumstance where there would have been those abuses, and... and as a--"
2005.05-5705,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2653.779,2671.813,"Don't... don't you think the Framers were aware of the fact that although there were law enforcement abuses, Raleigh's case and so on, there were also abuses every day of the week on the part of people who gave false testimony because they had grudges against the defendant?"
2005.05-5705,1,42698,thomas_m_fisher,,2679.644,2685.004,--We don't know exactly all of the details that would have... that they were contemplating.
2005.05-5705,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2685.004,2698.444,"But why would... why would we impute that... that unconcern to the Framers about the... the need to test statements which may very well have... have been given because of envy, grudge, and so on?"
2005.05-5705,1,42698,thomas_m_fisher,,2698.444,2709.368,"Because of... of what we do know and what Crawford said that we do know, which is that we know that they were responding to things like Raleigh's trial and to Stamp Act, you know, enforcement, other--"
2005.05-5705,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2709.368,2719.199,"Well, but doesn't... doesn't that get us back to the fact that those examples were given in Crawford as paradigm examples, if, you know, those were... I think the word poor was used."
2005.05-5705,1,42698,thomas_m_fisher,,2737.406,2740.375,"--Again, if I may be permitted to finish."
2005.05-5705,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2750.769,2752.41,"Thank you, counsel."
2005.05-5705,2,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,2761.74,2764.271,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
2005.05-5705,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2783.979,2786.543,"May I ask, under your view, was the affidavit admissible?"
2005.05-5705,2,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,2786.543,2788.949,--The affidavit is not admissible.
2005.05-5705,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2788.949,2789.417,Why not?
2005.05-5705,2,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,2789.417,2800.609,"The affidavit is... is not admissible because, by that point, the officer had the information that he needed to resolve the emergency, and what he was soliciting at that point--"
2005.05-5705,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2800.609,2810.266,I would suggest the reason it was not admissible is it's very clear that the affidavit is the testimonial statement by a witness that the defendant has a right to confront.
2005.05-5705,2,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,2813.861,2815.705,"--I was just getting to that, Justice Stevens--"
2005.05-5705,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2815.705,2815.955,Oh.
2005.05-5705,2,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,2815.955,2819.143,"--that the... the emergency was resolved, and at that point, he was--"
2005.05-5705,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2819.143,2825.659,"But you say if the officer independently repeats what is said in the affidavit, then he's the witness against rather than the--"
2005.05-5705,2,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,2825.659,2825.956,"--No, not... no."
2005.05-5705,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2847.227,2848.712,What was the immediate danger?
2005.05-5705,2,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,2848.712,2850.478,When... the immediate danger was--
2005.05-5705,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2850.478,2854.603,"I mean, there's the policeman in the room across the kitchen table from... from the woman."
2005.05-5705,2,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,2854.603,2855.698,--The--
2005.05-5705,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2855.698,2857.276,He's not on the end of a phone line.
2005.05-5705,2,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,2859.574,2859.949,--That's correct.
2005.05-5705,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2894.034,2900.552,"In a situation like that, what was needed to resolve the situation, if he believed what Mrs. Hammon said, was to arrest Mr. Hammon."
2005.05-5705,2,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,2900.849,2901.599,--That's correct.
2005.05-5705,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2901.599,2906.694,So he could... you think he could gather as much evidence as was necessary to arrest Mr. Hammon.
2005.05-5705,2,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,2906.694,2907.241,I do not.
2005.05-5705,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2908.662,2909.428,Why... why not?
2005.05-5705,2,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,2909.881,2922.572,"--Well, at some point, what... what turns into emergency resolution moves over into interrogation, and once you reach interrogation, then you have reached the core of what Crawford talks about--"
2005.05-5705,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2922.572,2924.228,How do we know when that line is crossed?
2005.05-5705,2,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,2936.997,2959.049,"--I... I think this is going to be a line drawing question, but when you have a situation like this one where you have an officer who's just on the scene in the immediate wake of a... of a domestic dispute, he asks a single question, what happened, in... in circumstances in which he needed to know the answer to that question to make sure he could leave and leave her there safely."
2005.05-5705,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2976.958,2977.239,Why?
2005.05-5705,2,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,3001.651,3005.214,The Confrontation Clause bars under Crawford police interrogation.
2005.05-5705,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3036.221,3050.443,"That... that assumes... this... your... your focus on whether the... you know, the... it's an interrogation or not... it... it assumes that the only focus of the Confrontation Clause is on prosecutorial abuse somehow."
2005.05-5705,2,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,3055.209,3070.774,"--No, we don't... we don't think that's the exclusive focus either, and we think interrogation can capture both, too, that when you get to the point of interrogation, what's happening with the witness is getting an increasing understanding that what this is being sought for is to build a case."
2005.05-5705,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3110.08,3112.8,"Of course, the Sixth Amendment doesn't use the word testimony, does it?"
2005.05-5705,2,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,3112.8,3113.582,"--No, it does not."
2005.05-5705,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3122.631,3129.679,"And maybe that... and maybe you're not a witness when you make the call, but when that same call is admitted into court, then... then it strikes me that you are a witness."
2005.05-5705,2,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,3129.679,3133.133,--But... but that's not the definition of witness that... that Crawford adopted.
2005.05-5705,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3133.742,3147.902,"--As it happens in the other... in the companion case today, the prosecution itself, in its summation to the jury, referred to the 911 call and said, you have heard the testimony of... of the victim and referred to it as testimony."
2005.05-5705,2,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,3147.902,3149.714,"--Justice Scalia, if he--"
2005.05-5705,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3149.714,3152.215,"I mean, it's not beyond the pale to consider this testimony."
2005.05-5705,2,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,3152.215,3164.686,"--if... if he... he had made a statement about a coconspirator's statement during the course of the conspiracy and he had said, we have here the testimony of the... his coconspirator, that would not make it testimony."
2005.05-5705,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3166.702,3170.562,"No, but it would prove that... that it's not beyond the pale to call it testimony."
2005.05-5705,2,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,3170.562,3172.687,"--Well, it just does not make it testimony."
2005.05-5705,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3180.283,3181.768,--Mr. Gornstein?
2005.05-5705,2,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,3181.768,3185.082,"--of a cry for help, that wouldn't make it not testimony."
2005.05-5705,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3185.754,3188.27,"Mr. Gornstein, is this a fair summary of your position, if I may?"
2005.05-5705,2,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,3210.072,3211.009,--He's... he's still a--
2005.05-5705,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3211.009,3212.837,He's still the witness we're concerned about.
2005.05-5705,2,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,3212.837,3213.275,--He is the witness--
2005.05-5705,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3213.275,3214.541,"Therefore, he's subject to cross examination."
2005.05-5705,2,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,3214.541,3216.744,--He's the... he's the... he is subject to cross examination.
2005.05-5705,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3216.744,3219.589,"And so during the emergency period, he can repeat what she said."
2005.05-5705,2,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,3219.589,3223.996,But I... what I'm saying is that she's not a witness during the emergency period itself.
2005.05-5705,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3223.996,3224.668,I understand what you're saying.
2005.05-5705,2,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,3224.668,3225.512,It has to be both.
2005.05-5705,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3225.512,3231.263,That we focus not on whether it's testimony but whether he's the witness at the critical time or whether she's the witness.
2005.05-5705,2,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,3231.263,3234.482,"I... I think that that's one way of looking at it, Justice Stevens, but--"
2005.05-5705,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3234.482,3236.498,That's not the way the Court looked at it in Crawford.
2005.05-5705,2,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,3236.498,3237.045,--No.
2005.05-5705,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3279.133,3284.243,I'm not sure that the two were... were as separated as you... as you claim.
2005.05-5705,2,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,3294.543,3297.558,"I don't think that there's any evidence in the record to support that, Justice Scalia."
2005.05-5705,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3317.501,3326.533,"But under your test, the whole question is whether the emergency continued at the time the witness' words are being repeated."
2005.05-5705,2,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,3326.533,3334.394,It's not the whole question because if the statement... the question has nothing to do with and the answer had nothing to do with the emergency.
2005.05-5705,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3336.739,3338.053,"No, I'm not arguing that."
2005.05-5705,2,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,3354.243,3356.727,"Well, Justice Stevens, I'm--"
2005.05-5705,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3356.727,3357.853,And I think your argument is--
2005.05-5705,2,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,3357.853,3361.557,--I'm happy to have your approach if it... if it leads to my approach to this case.
2005.05-5705,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3361.557,3361.791,--I think I'm trying to help you.
2005.05-5705,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3366.682,3369.183,"Thank you, Mr. Gornstein."
2005.05-5705,3,39264,richard__d_friedman,,3371.529,3386.062,"I... I think that whenever there is a... an out of court accusation repeated, there is a witness in court, but that is not the witness that... or that doesn't satisfy the confrontation right because as the... the--"
2005.05-5705,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3386.062,3392.391,"No, but you would agree that the officer could testify to some of the things that happened during the emergency, and he's a witness to that extent."
2005.05-5705,3,39264,richard__d_friedman,,3392.391,3394.736,"--Yes, absolutely, the officer was--"
2005.05-5705,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3394.736,3395.845,And the question is whether he can cover this as well.
2005.05-5705,3,39264,richard__d_friedman,,3395.845,3399.127,"--That's... that, of course, is the... that... that's the question."
2005.05-5705,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3544.112,3548.503,What about the resemblance idea to get around your problem?
2005.05-5705,3,39264,richard__d_friedman,,3553.958,3558.209,I'm not sure I quite understand.
2005.05-5705,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3558.209,3566.18,"It's purely the formal criteria, plus anything that's the same."
2005.05-5705,3,39264,richard__d_friedman,,3572.431,3572.977,Well--
2005.05-5705,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3572.977,3573.9,So what do you think of that?
2005.05-5705,3,39264,richard__d_friedman,,3573.9,3577.619,"--I... I... not much, Your Honor."
2005.05-5705,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3653.058,3653.464,"Thank you, counsel."
