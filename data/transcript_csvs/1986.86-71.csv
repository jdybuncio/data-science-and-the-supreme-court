1986.86-71,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,53.37,"Mr. Strain, you may proceed whenever you are ready."
1986.86-71,0,32953,james_a_strain,,53.37,56.212,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1986.86-71,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,178.022,190.392,"Mr. Strain, may I inquire what you think the purpose of the statute is?"
1986.86-71,0,32953,james_a_strain,,190.392,191.079,Of course.
1986.86-71,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,191.079,200.045,"Do you think, at least in part, it is to try to keep jobs and corporate headquarters and so forth within the State of Indiana?"
1986.86-71,0,32953,james_a_strain,,200.045,200.996,"No, I do not."
1986.86-71,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,200.996,202.699,It is not a purpose at all?
1986.86-71,0,32953,james_a_strain,,202.699,204.698,It is my belief that is not the purpose.
1986.86-71,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,204.698,217.991,"We should in making our findings and decision here conclude that that has no part for consideration in this case, is that right?"
1986.86-71,0,32953,james_a_strain,,217.991,222.489,"Based on the theory that we argue, Justice O'Connor, it makes no difference."
1986.86-71,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,222.489,232.531,"Well, is it a purpose then to provide protection to stockholders of public corporations incorporated in Indiana?"
1986.86-71,0,32953,james_a_strain,,232.531,235.062,"Ultimately, that has to be the purpose."
1986.86-71,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,235.062,235.968,You think that is the purpose?
1986.86-71,0,32953,james_a_strain,,235.968,236.279,"Yes, ma'am."
1986.86-71,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,236.279,246.838,Is it kind of a strange form of stockholder protection to in fact strip the stockholders of their right to transfer voting shares?
1986.86-71,0,32953,james_a_strain,,249.681,255.053,"Stripping the shareholders of the vote, of course, is one way to put what goes on."
1986.86-71,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,293.085,305.252,"Well, do you think the state could pass an outright prohibition of the transfer of voting shares in takeover bids?"
1986.86-71,0,32953,james_a_strain,,305.252,314.279,This Court squarely held in Aldridge that among the bundle of rights that the state creates is the right of transferability.
1986.86-71,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,328.039,332.741,"You think there would be no commerce clause violation or concern, in any event?"
1986.86-71,0,32953,james_a_strain,,332.741,333.725,Indeed I do not.
1986.86-71,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,349.094,354.342,May I follow up on the question... I am over here.
1986.86-71,0,32953,james_a_strain,,354.342,356.606,"I beg your pardon, Justice Scalia."
1986.86-71,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,356.606,370.008,"Justice O'Connor asked about one of the purposes served perhaps by this statute, and other similar statutes, is to retain major corporate headquarters in a state."
1986.86-71,0,32953,james_a_strain,,383.002,384.315,There is no doubt that that is--
1986.86-71,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,384.315,387.142,You have perhaps read about the uproar down in North Carolina.
1986.86-71,0,32953,james_a_strain,,387.142,387.876,"--Yes, sir."
1986.86-71,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,387.876,391.625,Where there was some talk that R.J. Reynolds will no longer be in that state.
1986.86-71,0,32953,james_a_strain,,400.418,402.76,"Well, I don't view what I have said as a concession."
1986.86-71,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1063.087,1065.163,"That was a little too quick, there."
1986.86-71,0,32953,james_a_strain,,1079.923,1083.5,"--Justice Scalia, you raise, really for me two issues."
1986.86-71,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1196.955,1202.701,"Thank you, Mr. Strain."
1986.86-71,1,32301,john_f_pritchard,,1209.183,1211.932,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1986.86-71,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1211.932,1222.304,May I ask at the outset... I don't know why whenever I speak somebody looks over there... what is the status of this controversy now?
1986.86-71,1,32301,john_f_pritchard,,1225.35,1227.349,--The shares have been purchased.
1986.86-71,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1233.753,1234.783,"So, no question of mootness?"
1986.86-71,1,32301,john_f_pritchard,,1234.783,1235.111,No.
1986.86-71,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1291.884,1298.882,You deny that the statute would have the effect that Judge Posner speculated it would?
1986.86-71,1,32301,john_f_pritchard,,1298.882,1299.664,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1986.86-71,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1299.664,1303.099,You don't think it would have any effect on takeovers?
1986.86-71,1,32301,john_f_pritchard,,1303.099,1313.829,We believe that takeovers would be able to occur on essentially the same time schedule and using essentially the same procedures that they occur on now.
1986.86-71,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1314.765,1315.406,Where they occur?
1986.86-71,1,32301,john_f_pritchard,,1315.406,1317.422,"--Excuse me, Your Honor?"
1986.86-71,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1317.422,1318.265,Where they occur.
1986.86-71,1,32301,john_f_pritchard,,1318.265,1322.372,"Where they occur... tender offers do not always succeed, Your Honor."
1986.86-71,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1340.224,1342.645,I would be interested to hear.
1986.86-71,1,32301,john_f_pritchard,,1342.645,1353.734,"Judge Posner concluded in his opinion that the statute, in his words, set up a gauntlet that few tender offers could run."
1986.86-71,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1665.406,1666.248,His votes are excluded.
1986.86-71,1,32301,john_f_pritchard,,1666.248,1667.576,"No, Your Honor."
1986.86-71,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1674.574,1686.07,"He is trying to get another 11 percent... suddenly instead of needing just an 11 percent vote of the entire corporation he needs 50 percent of 60 percent, right?"
1986.86-71,1,32301,john_f_pritchard,,1686.07,1686.505,"I am sorry, Your Honor."
1986.86-71,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1697.876,1700.297,"More than 11 percent, he would need 30 percent."
1986.86-71,1,32301,john_f_pritchard,,1700.297,1702.765,"Well, he would need 30 percent."
1986.86-71,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1703.203,1704.685,But that's 30 percent--
1986.86-71,1,32301,john_f_pritchard,,1704.685,1708.232,But that's 30 percent of the disinterested shareholders.
1986.86-71,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1708.232,1709.964,--It's 50 percent of the disinterested.
1986.86-71,1,32301,john_f_pritchard,,1709.964,1712.402,"Right, Your Honor, it is 50 percent of the disinterested."
1986.86-71,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1712.402,1713.433,But it's 70.
1986.86-71,1,32301,john_f_pritchard,,1716.978,1720.086,"But his 40 percent does not vote, Your Honor."
1986.86-71,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1720.086,1720.571,I understand.
1986.86-71,1,32301,john_f_pritchard,,1720.571,1721.039,So that you are having--
1986.86-71,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1721.039,1723.257,By virtue of the statute.
1986.86-71,1,32301,john_f_pritchard,,1723.257,1724.382,--By virtue of the statute.
1986.86-71,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1724.382,1726.599,"So, it's pretty much tantamount to a super-majority."
1986.86-71,1,32301,john_f_pritchard,,1726.599,1735.595,It is a majority of the very shareholders who are interested in the outcome of the election and in tendering their shares.
1986.86-71,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1750.261,1766.146,"Of the persons to whom it is directed, to get control, all he needs is 11 percent of the whole company, and you are now converting that into, he has to get 50 percent of all of the remaining shares in order to get--"
1986.86-71,1,32301,john_f_pritchard,,1766.146,1766.722,"Your Honor, that is another question."
1986.86-71,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1787.387,1794.697,"Thank you, Mr. Pritchard."
1986.86-71,2,35090,lowell_e_sachnoff,,1798.149,1803.897,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1986.86-71,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1861.998,1867.214,"Mr. Sachnoff, when you said ten percent about the number of shareholders, did you mean ten percent don't vote?"
1986.86-71,2,35090,lowell_e_sachnoff,,1867.214,1869.229,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1986.86-71,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2275.221,2289.326,"Mr. Sachnoff, if you use the term ""chill"" to mean in any way discourage, as some of our cases have used that term, any added state requirement to federal requirements will ""chill"", in a sense."
1986.86-71,2,35090,lowell_e_sachnoff,,2293.558,2295.011,"Yes, it is, Mr. Chief Justice."
1986.86-71,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2441.374,2444.841,"Of course, we may not agree with you on the Williams Act analysis."
1986.86-71,2,35090,lowell_e_sachnoff,,2444.841,2445.451,You may not.
1986.86-71,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2445.451,2447.232,Do you plan to address the commerce clause?
1986.86-71,2,35090,lowell_e_sachnoff,,2447.232,2447.574,I certainly do.
1986.86-71,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2476.392,2478.392,May I ask--
1986.86-71,2,35090,lowell_e_sachnoff,,2478.392,2478.611,--Surely.
1986.86-71,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2478.611,2530.465,"--what the implications are of the Seventh Circuit's holding on the internal affairs doctrine, and does that holding mean that the courts are going to be faced with commerce clause challenges to a whole range of provisions such as cumulative voting and staggered boards and partnership voting and non-voting shares and all of that, because the whole panoply of corporation law and these restrictions that we find in state law can be said to affect the market for corporate control someway and that is sort of the theory of the Seventh Circuit."
1986.86-71,2,35090,lowell_e_sachnoff,,2530.465,2545.381,"I think, Justice O'Connor, you are asking about the limiting principle, where does all this stop, and is it really true as appellants say that an affirmance here is going to end up federalizing all the state corporation law."
1986.86-71,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2603.935,2614.634,"Suppose the state just passed a law that said that acquisition of more than a certain percentage of shares is going to require the voting of all the stockholders, period."
1986.86-71,2,35090,lowell_e_sachnoff,,2614.634,2634.799,"--If that happened midstream and that was where I part with the government in this case, if that happened in midstream, let's say that Indiana passed a statute that says no one can own and vote more than five percent of the stock of a corporation, that would make it almost impossible for that corporation to be taken over by any other corporation."
1986.86-71,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2642.045,2655.899,"No, a statute that just says, before there can be an acquisition by an outsider of more than ""X"" percentage of the shares we are going to require all the other shareholders in the corporation to vote."
1986.86-71,2,35090,lowell_e_sachnoff,,2655.899,2657.196,That's this statute.
1986.86-71,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2657.993,2659.351,"Well, this has a lot of other things."
1986.86-71,2,35090,lowell_e_sachnoff,,2659.351,2666.27,"--Part of the statute is that you don't get the vote, the bidder doesn't get the vote, without the vote of these so-called disinterested shareholders."
1986.86-71,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2684.309,2686.839,"Yes, but what about the question I posed?"
1986.86-71,2,35090,lowell_e_sachnoff,,2686.839,2702.287,"--What I am saying is that that's this statute, Justice O'Connor, and I believe that this statute fails both under the Williams Act and under the commerce clause because it is an obstacle to the accomplishment of the purpose of the Williams Act and because it does unduly burden interstate commerce."
1986.86-71,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2721.043,2730.978,"Yes, but in a sense some of these obstacles actually can be said to enhance the ability of the shareholder to protect himself or herself."
1986.86-71,2,35090,lowell_e_sachnoff,,2749.471,2761.731,I think that may be true but I think that that's got to be a political decision in the interstate market for corporate control that ought to be done by Congress and not by individual states.
1986.86-71,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2761.731,2768.009,"Isn't that exactly the kind of thing that's a legitimate thing for a state to be concerned about, if the corporation is incorporated in that state?"
1986.86-71,2,35090,lowell_e_sachnoff,,2768.009,2779.381,"Your Honor, I think that would be true if this were the 51st state that were incorporated behind some John Rolls veil of ignorance and there were no shares outstanding, I think that analysis would be absolutely correct."
1986.86-71,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2810.133,2817.302,"Are you saying the statute is perfectly all right, then, for corporations which are organized after the passage of the statute?"
1986.86-71,2,35090,lowell_e_sachnoff,,2817.302,2827.782,--If a state wanted to do something as foolish as to have two different kinds of voting requirements... that is grandfather clause... I think it probably would be.
1986.86-71,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2847.868,2856.755,"Doesn't the... the target corporation is the one that chooses to be governed by it, isn't that--"
1986.86-71,2,35090,lowell_e_sachnoff,,2856.755,2863.159,"The target corporation starts out, of course, Justice White, governed by the particular laws of the chartering state."
1986.86-71,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2864.345,2874.902,"--But could it decide not to, didn't want to have to comply with these provisions?"
1986.86-71,2,35090,lowell_e_sachnoff,,2874.902,2879.276,"--It's a book-of-the-month, sort of, it's a negative enrollment scheme in Indiana."
1986.86-71,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2920.135,2921.51,I don't understand that.
1986.86-71,2,35090,lowell_e_sachnoff,,2922.149,2923.837,"I might lose you, Justice."
1986.86-71,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2923.837,2934.301,"Since nobody else is subject to it anyway except Indiana corporations, how can the opting out provision lean in favor of Indiana corporations only?"
1986.86-71,2,35090,lowell_e_sachnoff,,2934.301,2956.823,"Because if the management of an Indiana corporation is faced with a friendly... management opts in the statute, it doesn't opt out after August of '87, so they are within the statute and they are opposing a prospective takeover by a Connecticut corporation or a New York corporation, and what they do then is they arrange to have a friendly takeover with an Indiana corporation and then they can simply opt out of the statute."
1986.86-71,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2964.632,2966.85,But not just an Indiana corporation.
1986.86-71,2,35090,lowell_e_sachnoff,,2967.318,2969.24,--Or any friendly corporation.
1986.86-71,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2969.24,2970.209,--Any friendly corporation.
1986.86-71,2,35090,lowell_e_sachnoff,,2975.004,2976.034,That's true.
1986.86-71,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2976.753,2977.909,It's not only true.
1986.86-71,2,35090,lowell_e_sachnoff,,2978.986,2990.137,"--But it puts in management's hands, Justice Scalia, the option to be able to say, I favor this prospective bidder over the other one, which is not the purpose of the Williams Act and the tender offer."
1986.86-71,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2990.137,2990.668,Different point.
1986.86-71,2,35090,lowell_e_sachnoff,,2990.668,2991.559,Different point.
1986.86-71,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3149.495,3156.712,What if the State changes its corporate law to say that shares are not transferable at all?
1986.86-71,2,35090,lowell_e_sachnoff,,3160.898,3167.27,"Yes, it would, Justice Scalia."
1986.86-71,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3197.882,3200.851,"But it would be okay in the future, it's just--"
1986.86-71,2,35090,lowell_e_sachnoff,,3200.851,3201.476,--It would be okay in the future.
1986.86-71,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3212.642,3217.92,--I really don't see the distinction you draw between present and future as far as the commerce clause is concerned.
1986.86-71,2,35090,lowell_e_sachnoff,,3227.323,3229.119,It's because there is a present market.
1986.86-71,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3234.321,3251.392,"You mean, if a state... if New York enacts a law that says no Florida grapefruit can come into New York, it would be good if Florida grapefruit had previously been coming in or bad if they had previously been coming in but good if there had never been any Florida grapefruit before?"
1986.86-71,2,35090,lowell_e_sachnoff,,3251.392,3253.454,I think that that's a different situation.

1986.86-71,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3302.964,3320.098,"Well, Mr. Sachnoff, your argument strikes me as a little bit at odds with this Court's case in Exxon against Maryland where the state law was enacted and it clearly favored in-state retailers at the expense of out-of-state suppliers."
1986.86-71,2,35090,lowell_e_sachnoff,,3325.378,3342.73,"Your Honor, in Exxon... I view Exxon as analogous to the blue sky laws because it had to do with products coming into Maryland and it had to do with the fact that the state regulation there didn't interfere with the ability of interstate suppliers to sell their wares in Maryland."
