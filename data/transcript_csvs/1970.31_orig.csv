1970.31_orig,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,30.543,"We'll hear arguments next in number 31 original, the State of Utah against the United States."
1970.31_orig,0,38336,peter_l_strauss,,34.667,39.108,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1970.31_orig,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,249.545,263.334,"Does this mean Mr. Strauss, that if Utah should prevail here that the proposed decree of the Special Master would not be proper?"
1970.31_orig,0,38336,peter_l_strauss,,263.334,268.241,"Well, I think it's question of construction, indeed whether the decree is inconsistent."
1970.31_orig,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,491.469,498.406,"Did he find what the ordinary and natural condition was, Mr. Strauss, for finding on that?"
1970.31_orig,0,38336,peter_l_strauss,,498.406,516.268,"I -- he found that on that date, the lake was approximately 77 miles long and taking its greatest length about 33 miles wide and exposed approximately 100 and -- excuse me, 15,000 square miles of water and to the sun."
1970.31_orig,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,549.535,558.32,What I was really getting at it is what is meant by body of water in its natural state or condition as applied to this lake?
1970.31_orig,0,38336,peter_l_strauss,,558.32,561.22,Oh.
1970.31_orig,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,637.783,651.274,A lot of the or to say a lot pf -- there are there few methods of I gather of traveling in very shallow waters and I remember down the everglades with these aired propel boats?
1970.31_orig,0,38336,peter_l_strauss,,651.274,652.931,"That's right, Mr. Justice Douglas."
1970.31_orig,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,672.73,674.551,"That's pretty well settled, isn't it?"
1970.31_orig,0,38336,peter_l_strauss,,674.551,675.447,I believe it is.
1970.31_orig,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,710.729,738.093,"Of course here, the master very clearly found that as of the date of statehood in January 1896 the lake was physically capable of being used in its ordinary condition as a highway for floating and affording passage to watercraft in the manner over which trade and travel was or might be conducted in the customary modes of travel on water at that time."
1970.31_orig,0,38336,peter_l_strauss,,738.093,738.535,"That's correct, he did."
1970.31_orig,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,738.535,755.772,"And he went on to say, that the areas of the lake didn't have a depths sufficient for that purpose, was -- were not narrow or short channels but were several miles wide extending substantially through the length and width of the lake and covered an area of more than a thousand square miles."
1970.31_orig,0,38336,peter_l_strauss,,755.772,756.448,That's right.
1970.31_orig,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,756.448,765.258,"That a vessel could travel from the one tip of the lake to the whole length of it, virtually on a straight line."
1970.31_orig,0,38336,peter_l_strauss,,765.258,773.272,I think it might be appropriate at this time to refer to this map which I've asked the Clerk to distribute.
1970.31_orig,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,966.59,970.308,Does it have to be very useful in commerce in order to be navigable?
1970.31_orig,0,38336,peter_l_strauss,,970.308,972.692,It has to be substantially useful.
1970.31_orig,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,977.147,980.069,"That's little different from being very useful for commerce, isn't it?"
1970.31_orig,0,38336,peter_l_strauss,,980.069,985.796,I think it comes well within the bounds of the United States' argument case.
1970.31_orig,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,985.796,989.172,"Very well, very well."
1970.31_orig,0,38336,peter_l_strauss,,989.172,1012.762,"In its natural condition, there is a capacity for commerce only between that point on the southern shore, that point of the northern tip, and a few of the islands are now in a lake, an enormous body of water of this sort, it seems to us that that is not sufficient to establish navigability."
1970.31_orig,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1130.06,1131.559,It's been heavily polluted?
1970.31_orig,0,38336,peter_l_strauss,,1131.559,1132.007,Hmm?
1970.31_orig,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1132.007,1133.817,"It is being heavily polluted, isn't it?"
1970.31_orig,0,38336,peter_l_strauss,,1133.817,1138.423,"It is being heavily polluted, I certainly agree with that."
1970.31_orig,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1138.423,1160.418,"Well, Mr. Strauss, this is on the premise, I suppose of what findings 45 which deal with harvesting of brine shrimp and 67 would still deal with the chemical compounds on the commercial that goes on in that connection."
1970.31_orig,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1179.142,1181.51,Does it have to be transportation?
1970.31_orig,0,38336,peter_l_strauss,,1181.51,1182.628,I believe so.
1970.31_orig,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1182.628,1184.072,Where do we find that?
1970.31_orig,0,38336,peter_l_strauss,,1184.072,1189.625,I believe it comes from the Court's decision in the Jonas Chief and the Daniel Ball.
1970.31_orig,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1189.625,1195.299,"It's a decision for others, for hire, that's really what you are arguing isn't it?"
1970.31_orig,0,38336,peter_l_strauss,,1195.299,1195.958,That is essentially.
1970.31_orig,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1195.958,1197.672,As a common carrier?
1970.31_orig,0,38336,peter_l_strauss,,1197.672,1233.764,"I don't -- I would not say that -- I don't think that I would want to or that I have to take that argument to a complete, to a complete extreme, but I do think again, that on a historical view, these lands, or these waters rather were important because they provided a means for goods and people to get from place to place."
1970.31_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1247.662,1250.035,May I get this very clear?
1970.31_orig,0,38336,peter_l_strauss,,1254.816,1255.117,Right.
1970.31_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1255.117,1257.456,-- and the only way to get to the island was by boat.
1970.31_orig,0,38336,peter_l_strauss,,1257.456,1257.643,Right.
1970.31_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1257.643,1259.842,The only way to get the minerals out was by boat --
1970.31_orig,0,38336,peter_l_strauss,,1259.842,1260.169,Right.
1970.31_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1260.169,1265.239,-- and the lake was perfectly adequate to sustain that kind of transportation.
1970.31_orig,0,38336,peter_l_strauss,,1277.734,1280.77,I think not.
1970.31_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1280.77,1282.746,"Well, why not?"
1970.31_orig,0,38336,peter_l_strauss,,1282.746,1308.107,"Well, I would have to take it down to -- I suppose, what may be a somewhat more prosaic, somewhat more prosaic description one may also imagine an island which is being used for farming purposes as there are in this lake, which is surrounded by a body of water, which is not navigable."
1970.31_orig,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1323.732,1325.391,They bring their products out and back.
1970.31_orig,0,38336,peter_l_strauss,,1325.391,1328.184,"And bring their products out and back, of course they do."
1970.31_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1328.184,1335.569,"Well, isn't that a -- that certainly is a commercial use of the water and it's being used for transportation of goods being taken to market?"
1970.31_orig,0,38336,peter_l_strauss,,1335.569,1354.074,"It is being used for transportation of goods being taken to market, but I do feel that the Court's cases have been concerned with commercial use in a broader sense as in -- it might so well as, be a marsh, be a swamp, the one of these areas which is passable only by airboat."
1970.31_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1379.698,1387.497,What if the -- what about a river that's used as a highway for getting logs to market?
1970.31_orig,0,38336,peter_l_strauss,,1391.186,1402.829,I'm not entirely sure of it but I'm -- I will say that they are -- there are certainly are cases which have held that that was one use that showed that it --
1970.31_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1402.829,1410.919,"If there is a valuable stand that timber on this island in the lake and they floated the logs over, it would be alright?"
1970.31_orig,0,38336,peter_l_strauss,,1410.919,1412.257,No.
1970.31_orig,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1483.576,1486.36,"You said Mr. Strauss, I think earlier."
1970.31_orig,0,38336,peter_l_strauss,,1493.5,1497.749,A substantial or permanent commercial use for the transportation of passengers and goods.
1970.31_orig,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1497.749,1504.861,"Is this a matter of degree or a matter of what, general variety of uses or what?"
1970.31_orig,0,38336,peter_l_strauss,,1504.861,1506.993,"To be sure, it's a matter of degree, I believe."
1970.31_orig,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1506.993,1508.078,Of degree?
1970.31_orig,0,38336,peter_l_strauss,,1508.078,1510.814,That's right.
1970.31_orig,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1565.341,1573.277,"Mr. Strauss, the Great Lakes are lakes, they're considered rather good for navigation?"
1970.31_orig,0,38336,peter_l_strauss,,1573.277,1574.068,And they are.
1970.31_orig,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1590.77,1596.044,But wouldn't the great lakes be navigable even if they were not in fact a boat being used on them?
1970.31_orig,0,38336,peter_l_strauss,,1596.044,1597.067,Of course.
1970.31_orig,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1597.067,1602.842,"Because it's susceptible, capable of bearing navigation, isn't that the test?"
1970.31_orig,0,38336,peter_l_strauss,,1602.842,1615.584,"It is susceptible and capable of bearing navigation, but in the sense that one may expect that navigation to be there that has some permanent and substantial use as this Court has put it."
1970.31_orig,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1643.685,1654.12,"Mr. Strauss, do you question the accuracy of the master's findings 48 and 49 on pages 42 and 43 of his report."
1970.31_orig,0,38336,peter_l_strauss,,1654.12,1654.416,We have not accepted it --
1970.31_orig,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1654.416,1655.273,Showing a --
1970.31_orig,0,38336,peter_l_strauss,,1655.273,1656.293,-- and so we do not.
1970.31_orig,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1656.293,1666.697,Showing more than a dozen or so modes or uses of water transportation on the lake?
1970.31_orig,0,38336,peter_l_strauss,,1666.697,1682.937,"No, we do explain -- we do explain those uses in the brief before the Special Master which is now before this Court and I think the Court will find that many of them occurred during periods of time when the lake was much higher than it is now."
1970.31_orig,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1683.413,1689.263,"Well, it was much higher than it is now, in 1896 when it became a State and that's a critical time, isn't it?"
1970.31_orig,0,38336,peter_l_strauss,,1689.263,1691.736,It was much higher than it was in 1896.
1970.31_orig,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1691.736,1694.632,Significantly higher in 1896 than it is now.
1970.31_orig,0,38336,peter_l_strauss,,1694.632,1695.373,That's right.
1970.31_orig,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1706.101,1714.795,"You have a testimony of that woman, Zela somebody, who was born before the statehood, and grew up on Antelope Island until she was 12 years old."
1970.31_orig,0,38336,peter_l_strauss,,1714.795,1715.668,That's right.
1970.31_orig,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1715.668,1723.053,"And of course, I suppose people couldn't have lived and worked on that Antelope Island unless the lake were navigable, could they?"
1970.31_orig,0,38336,peter_l_strauss,,1723.053,1728.268,They couldn't have lived and worked on Antelope Island unless they could get from the island to the shores.
1970.31_orig,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1729.366,1730.511,With their products.
1970.31_orig,0,38336,peter_l_strauss,,1730.511,1732.719,"With their products, that's right."
1970.31_orig,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1732.719,1733.527,With their livestock.
1970.31_orig,0,38336,peter_l_strauss,,1733.527,1734.518,With their livestock.
1970.31_orig,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1782.85,1786.516,Very well.
1970.31_orig,1,21058,dallin_w_jensen,,1789.836,1793.983,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1970.31_orig,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2308.765,2309.871,Any at the time of statehood?
1970.31_orig,1,21058,dallin_w_jensen,,2309.871,2310.874,Prior to statehood.
1970.31_orig,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2310.874,2311.709,Prior to statehood.
1970.31_orig,1,21058,dallin_w_jensen,,2311.709,2315.873,"Now, Saltair was built in 1893."
1970.31_orig,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2333.933,2336.293,Is Saltair where they use to have the amusement park right in the --
1970.31_orig,1,21058,dallin_w_jensen,,2336.293,2354.989,"Yes, Saltair is the old pavilion where they have the dance hall out over the lake and where the lake probably got primarily known for its ability for people to get in and float around."
1970.31_orig,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2361.183,2363.92,Is anybody -- can anybody swim in the lake anymore?
1970.31_orig,1,21058,dallin_w_jensen,,2363.92,2369.031,"Yes, there are three beaches on the lake now."
1970.31_orig,2,38336,peter_l_strauss,,2945.388,2952.275,I would only say very briefly while it's evident that this is the best of close case for United States.
1970.31_orig,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3033.969,3036.068,"Well, if you, kindly lodge with the clerk."
1970.31_orig,2,38336,peter_l_strauss,,3038.652,3038.954,Thank you.
1970.31_orig,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3038.954,3039.895,"Thank you, Mr. Strauss."
