1969.40,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,31.452,"Number 40, Conway against California Adult Authority."
1969.40,0,19940,charles_stephen_ralston,,34.175,39.782,Thank you Your Honor.
1969.40,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,416.116,432.188,"Mr. Ralston is it -- if you know is it usual for the Adult Authority to come in at a point and fix the sentence in the way it was done here, generally?"
1969.40,0,19940,charles_stephen_ralston,,432.188,437.555,"You mean in -- Well, under the statute, it has the duty to do so."
1969.40,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,437.555,449.63,"Yes, I understand they have the power and the duty, is there any pattern that is reflected as to when that power is exercised in --"
1969.40,0,19940,charles_stephen_ralston,,449.63,455.34,I do not have any specific information as to -- at what point this power is exercised.
1969.40,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,496.419,500.529,Is that apparently his challenge to?
1969.40,0,19940,charles_stephen_ralston,,500.529,507.208,"No, this -- I do not believe the Attorney General has challenges his contention about the initial fixing."
1969.40,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,556.865,570.226,Unless that -- unless we know the factual basis for that action were how can we know that we have federal question here?
1969.40,0,19940,charles_stephen_ralston,,570.226,579.401,"Well, that's the problem in this case Mr. Justice Douglas is that there isn't -- there is an essence no record in this case."
1969.40,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,664.896,668.569,"The state says you're out of time in the Court of Appeals, is that so?"
1969.40,0,19940,charles_stephen_ralston,,668.569,669.268,"No, Your Honor."
1969.40,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,752.435,761.171,"Technically at least to what we only have here is a denial of a certificate of probable cause by Chief Judge Chambers, is that correct?"
1969.40,0,19940,charles_stephen_ralston,,761.171,762.436,"Yes, Your Honor."
1969.40,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,777.243,791.089,Under the statute after a denial by a circuit judge of the certificate of probable that can every in an application to justice for such a certificate?
1969.40,0,19940,charles_stephen_ralston,,791.089,794.131,"I am not sure, Mr. Justice Stewart."
1969.40,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,796.205,799.097,That would be what 2241 or 2242?
1969.40,0,19940,charles_stephen_ralston,,799.097,808.984,I think it's clear from cases such as House versus Mayo that the certiorari does lie from the denial of the certificate of probable itself.
1969.40,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,808.984,809.97,By a judge?
1969.40,0,19940,charles_stephen_ralston,,813.124,813.581,"Yes, Your Honor."
1969.40,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,813.581,816.555,How about by the District Judge?
1969.40,0,19940,charles_stephen_ralston,,816.555,822.692,"Well, from the district judge but then -- then what has to be done as to go to the Circuit Court."
1969.40,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,822.692,824.486,But not on the appeal?
1969.40,0,19940,charles_stephen_ralston,,829.816,830.523,Yes.
1969.40,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,830.523,833.695,And if that denied.
1969.40,0,19940,charles_stephen_ralston,,847.521,851.411,"Quite frankly, I have not looked into the specific matter."
1969.40,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,872.788,877.11,"Well, I think you have some cases on your side, doesn't it?"
1969.40,0,19940,charles_stephen_ralston,,877.11,885.916,I believe in the case of Maxwell versus Bishop as I recall and one of prior appearances this was a situation.
1969.40,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,885.916,894.661,"Well, how long these are -- when you're denied as strictly probable cause of the District Court and you don't -- you're not -- you don't go up on appeal then but you go to the Court of Appeals."
1969.40,0,19940,charles_stephen_ralston,,901.316,910.466,"Your Honor, the Third Circuit has essentially -- I don't believe set any particular time limit on it and their particular rule."
1969.40,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,910.466,915.743,"If the appeal -- if the appeal time applied, you would be out of time?"
1969.40,0,19940,charles_stephen_ralston,,915.743,919.227,If were the appeal from the denial for the certificate of probable cause.
1969.40,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,919.227,919.447,Yes.
1969.40,0,19940,charles_stephen_ralston,,919.447,921.92,If that were the thirty day period.
1969.40,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,942.289,948.475,That was a wrong route where his mistaken to say he was going to appeal.
1969.40,0,19940,charles_stephen_ralston,,948.475,951.527,To mean appeal to from the denial of --
1969.40,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,951.527,954.299,He should have gone -- He should have gone to the Court of Appeal?
1969.40,0,19940,charles_stephen_ralston,,954.299,955.667,"Well, he attempted to do that."
1969.40,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,972.42,976.941,But nevertheless his proper procedure was to ask the Court of Appeals for certificate of probable cause.
1969.40,0,19940,charles_stephen_ralston,,976.941,982.1,"Yes, Your Honor and the Judge Chambers treated the affidavit he filed as that."
1969.40,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,982.1,991.526,But the moment that you would say that he eventually did that and you would say there isn't any time limit on when you been asked for that certificate of probable cause?
1969.40,0,19940,charles_stephen_ralston,,991.526,993.3,There might be some --
1969.40,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,993.3,999.189,"Well, isn't that -- Isn't what happens when you get a certificate of probable cause then there is an appeal?"
1969.40,0,19940,charles_stephen_ralston,,999.189,1000.405,"Yes, Your Honor."
1969.40,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1000.405,1018.985,So what you're really saying is that you're going to have to perfect in the appeal and I were supposed the appellant time limit might relevant to when you have get organized to get a certificate of probable cause?
1969.40,0,19940,charles_stephen_ralston,,1018.985,1019.494,"Yes, Your Honor."
1969.40,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1388.879,1392.64,I think Mr. Ralston that permanently you're warning right?
1969.40,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1392.64,1394.107,The act of this --
1969.40,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1394.107,1399.686,I see.
1969.40,0,19940,charles_stephen_ralston,,1399.686,1424.023,That to an essence revoke a previous he set sentence and put a prisoner back on like term merely because he wishes to prove his innocence once he gets out.
1969.40,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1557.727,1580.182,"Would you concede Mr. Ralston that in this kind of sentencing scheme or system was that some considerable flexibility must be allowed to the state to deal with it, is that your point but you claim it needs procedural devices to protect it?"
1969.40,0,19940,charles_stephen_ralston,,1580.182,1581.27,"Yes, Your Honor."
1969.40,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1598.79,1601.694,"Yes, as I read your brief accurately."
1969.40,0,19940,charles_stephen_ralston,,1606.096,1616.379,This is the second part of the argument which is an independent from the first part and that very briefly and then -- unless there are any questions.
1969.40,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1670.918,1672.463,Can I ask you please?
1969.40,0,19940,charles_stephen_ralston,,1672.463,1672.711,"Yes, Your Honor."
1969.40,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1672.711,1684.428,"Where in the petition for habeas corpus in the District Court, it is alleged that he was denied, his a parole -- his parole was revoke because he wouldn't confess?"
1969.40,0,19940,charles_stephen_ralston,,1684.428,1685.007,"Yes, Your Honor."
1969.40,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1741.208,1751.531,And but your only federal question you raised in the petition was that the California law was void as vague.
1969.40,0,19940,charles_stephen_ralston,,1751.531,1754.325,And also the double jeopardy --
1969.40,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1754.325,1754.904,Yes.
1969.40,0,19940,charles_stephen_ralston,,1754.904,1756.581,-- issue was raised.
1969.40,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1772.938,1780.763,"Well, they ask but you just say it on the ground that's a sentences vague and uncertain?"
1969.40,0,19940,charles_stephen_ralston,,1780.763,1800.311,"Well, yes Your Honor but I think it was can be reasonably construed to include the issues of when the grant of this time has been giving that allows the Adult Authority to act again freely and had its own will in caprice."
1969.40,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1814.948,1816.585,"Thank you, Mr. Ralston."
1969.40,1,16982,arlo_e_smith,,1820.233,1830.455,"Your Honors, I might reply to your question if you look at page 4 Mr. Justice White will note --"

1969.40,1,16982,arlo_e_smith,,1845.933,1848.157,Page 4 of the Appendix.
1969.40,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1848.157,1849.013,For what of your Appendix?
1969.40,1,16982,arlo_e_smith,,1849.013,1852.446,"Oh, C, 10C the printed appendix that --"
1969.40,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1852.446,1854.492,California includes submitting new evidence --
1969.40,1,16982,arlo_e_smith,,1854.492,1856.593,"C, under both 10 and 11."
1969.40,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1866.045,1872.083,"What's -- you have it -- that's what it raises state court and also, I'm trying to say that --"
1969.40,1,16982,arlo_e_smith,,1872.083,1874.716,He's trying to raised those well --
1969.40,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1874.716,1875.113,What --
1969.40,1,16982,arlo_e_smith,,1875.113,1876.311,We don't contest the --
1969.40,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1876.311,1883.235,On page he says what the question he's presenting to the federal court in the California?
1969.40,1,16982,arlo_e_smith,,1883.235,1885.341,I can see directly the record is very confusing.
1969.40,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1885.341,1886.058,"Well, I think --"
1969.40,1,16982,arlo_e_smith,,1886.058,1886.785,I -- there are
1969.40,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1886.785,1896.873,"It does or does not California concede that repetition of serve, I mean, the petition for habeas alleged a federal question."
1969.40,1,16982,arlo_e_smith,,1903.268,1904.494,Alleged the federal question?
1969.40,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1904.494,1905.54,Yes.
1969.40,1,16982,arlo_e_smith,,1906.506,1910.388,It alleges of a violation of a constitutional right.
1969.40,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1947.281,1948.427,"Well, what I'm trying to get at --"
1969.40,1,16982,arlo_e_smith,,1948.427,1949.283,Third --
1969.40,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1949.283,1957.544,"In Federal District Court, if you say does the allegation of the habeas petition alleges as a substantial federal questions."
1969.40,1,16982,arlo_e_smith,,1963.969,1975.424,But we say that federal -- we say that was no improper denial of the certificate of probable cause is our third point.
1969.40,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2014.46,2023.306,-- that the only federal question raised was the constitutionality generally of the California statute?
1969.40,1,16982,arlo_e_smith,,2023.306,2024.724,That is the raised also the question that cause --
1969.40,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2024.724,2027.167,Well after get at some point a little more.
1969.40,1,16982,arlo_e_smith,,2050.844,2054.717,"We say that was not properly before the District Court, those facts."
1969.40,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2054.717,2055.925,"Anyway, well this allegation --"
1969.40,1,16982,arlo_e_smith,,2055.925,2061.864,That allegation was not properly before the Court and not properly before this Court for two reasons.
1969.40,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2061.864,2063.898,Why wasn't adopt properly before the District Court?
1969.40,1,16982,arlo_e_smith,,2065.054,2074.889,This is a footnote to a supplement to a petition for a writ of habeas corpus which is unsworn to.
1969.40,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2103.785,2105.28,-- claim the supplement were --
1969.40,1,16982,arlo_e_smith,,2105.28,2107.645,"Yes, yes I can."
1969.40,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2110.48,2112.145,Where's that appear that it is a supplement?
1969.40,1,16982,arlo_e_smith,,2112.145,2121.357,"Well, the petition for habeas corpus has starts at page 2."
1969.40,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2122.293,2123.95,"Wait a minute now, page 2?"
1969.40,1,16982,arlo_e_smith,,2123.95,2126.154,Yes.
1969.40,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2131.631,2133.557,What it is that start of page 8?
1969.40,1,16982,arlo_e_smith,,2133.557,2134.397,Page 7.
1969.40,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2134.397,2135.543,"Yes, what's start at page 8?"
1969.40,1,16982,arlo_e_smith,,2135.543,2139.972,"You'll that is your affidavit of property, that is sworn to."
1969.40,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2194.03,2200.481,"Does it appear whether the District Court acted -- well, let me put rather the other way."
1969.40,1,16982,arlo_e_smith,,2204.503,2205.896,It doesn't.
1969.40,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2207.028,2210.838,Do we know that it did not act on this for which you call supplement?
1969.40,1,16982,arlo_e_smith,,2210.838,2212.375,What we say it's --
1969.40,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2212.375,2212.904,"No, no."
1969.40,1,16982,arlo_e_smith,,2214.95,2216.685,"No, we do not."
1969.40,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2226.382,2234.804,"But if the certificate had been issued, you would have had hearing and you would have had to record?"
1969.40,1,16982,arlo_e_smith,,2234.804,2235.471,That's correct.
1969.40,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2235.471,2238.443,And would have had quotes wrong testimony in Court?
1969.40,1,16982,arlo_e_smith,,2238.443,2244.221,What you mean if the district judge had issued in order to show cause.
1969.40,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2244.221,2244.878,Sure!
1969.40,1,16982,arlo_e_smith,,2244.878,2248.529,"Yes, we would have -- the record have been developed that's correct."
1969.40,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2249.365,2255.852,Are these Adult Authority proceedings was transcribed?
1969.40,1,16982,arlo_e_smith,,2259.27,2261.244,They are not transcribed.
1969.40,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2317.948,2330.159,"Well, how can we ever find out as to whether or not the Adult Authority requires everybody to admit their guilt or they stay in?"
1969.40,1,16982,arlo_e_smith,,2332.512,2344.358,"Well, I think that there are two answers and I was hoping to summarize my argument but let me summarize that point of our argument right now."
1969.40,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2368.981,2371.374,How do we find out whether its arbitrary?
1969.40,1,16982,arlo_e_smith,,2371.374,2397.508,"Well, under the rule in the California Courts, it can call for and does call for the records of the Adult Authority which include the kind of document attached here, disciplinary proceedings, and the case summary, the correctional officer's case summary."
1969.40,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2404.737,2409.98,"You mean if you change your sentence from five years to light, you don't have to give any reasons for it?"
1969.40,1,16982,arlo_e_smith,,2409.98,2411.327,No.
1969.40,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2416.607,2416.815,Well --
1969.40,1,16982,arlo_e_smith,,2416.815,2418.001,That under California law --
1969.40,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2418.001,2418.977,"Well, whether it state --"
1969.40,1,16982,arlo_e_smith,,2418.977,2421.282,It's only tentative.
1969.40,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2427.814,2431.275,"Yes, it's tentative in case he dies ahead of that."
