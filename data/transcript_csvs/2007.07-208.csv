2007.07-208,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.087,"We'll hear argument first today in Case 07-208, Indiana versus Edwards."
2007.07-208,0,42698,thomas_m_fisher,,7.87,20.663,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The trial court was justified in requiring a higher level of competency for self representation in order to prevent the trial of Ahmad Edwards from descending into a farce."
2007.07-208,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,30.552,39.475,But why is it necessary to have a special rule in order to prevent the trial from descending into a farce?
2007.07-208,0,42698,thomas_m_fisher,,69.227,71.012,"Well, I certainly hope so."
2007.07-208,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,94.545,96.428,The problem with taint would be his own fault.
2007.07-208,0,42698,thomas_m_fisher,,124.997,132.235,--I don't think that Mr. Edwards's sort of waiver by conduct in that context is the only thing to consider.
2007.07-208,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,142.125,146.844,As you understand the Respondent's position... and perhaps the question is better addressed to the Respondent.
2007.07-208,0,42698,thomas_m_fisher,,158.718,160.17,"You know, it's not clear to me that they would."
2007.07-208,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,186.637,194.658,What would happen if you started out with pro se representation and then the trial turned into a farce?
2007.07-208,0,42698,thomas_m_fisher,,198.779,207.401,"Well, it seems to me that we're in a world here where we don't really know what the precise rules would be because of the lack of clarity for the trial courts."
2007.07-208,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,220.959,222.495,"Well, there must be precedents."
2007.07-208,0,42698,thomas_m_fisher,,248.995,260.019,"Well, I think in the cases where this happened, whether it's because the trial was turned into a farce or because the defendant was excluded from the courtroom, as in Illinois v. Allen, I think the trial often proceeds."
2007.07-208,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,260.019,261.536,"Proceeds, that's what I thought."
2007.07-208,0,42698,thomas_m_fisher,,261.536,280.181,"But I guess what I'm suggests is that there is always going to be the possibility in terms of a discretionary judgment call, whether it's a systematic rule or whether it's something up to the trial judge, that the court may decide that in interest of fairness, that the... you know... all the... all that's gone on needs to be restarted, particularly if it hasn't gone on very far."
2007.07-208,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,283.631,286.083,What is your test that you're going to apply ex ante?
2007.07-208,0,42698,thomas_m_fisher,,291.137,291.67,"--Oh, the test."
2007.07-208,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,291.67,293.37,"--Yes, what's the test?"
2007.07-208,0,42698,thomas_m_fisher,,293.37,305.896,"Well, the rule that we are suggesting... and again let it caution that this is not a rule adopted by the Indiana Supreme Court yet... is That it is within the State's authority to override this right where the defendant cannot communicate coherently with the court or the jury."
2007.07-208,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,305.896,309.698,Cannot communicate coherently?
2007.07-208,0,42698,thomas_m_fisher,,320.239,323.191,I don't think it's any worse in terms of vagueness than what we deal with in Dusky.
2007.07-208,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,328.76,337.349,Let me give you a concrete illustration that was brought up by the other side.
2007.07-208,0,42698,thomas_m_fisher,,360.628,361.13,No.
2007.07-208,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,393.852,404.574,"So your standard of coherent communication, you would not require the defendant, for example, to understand the hearsay rule, or other things of that sort?"
2007.07-208,0,42698,thomas_m_fisher,,404.574,405.326,No.
2007.07-208,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,405.326,410.045,"Well, even if you don't, I mean, how is he going to effectively participate in the trial?"
2007.07-208,0,42698,thomas_m_fisher,,416.032,420.0,We're not asking to get into that kind of level of detailed knowledge.
2007.07-208,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,439.078,450.919,"But surely his total ignorance of all of the trial rules, the hearsay rule and the other details of conducting a trial, is a great disadvantage."
2007.07-208,0,42698,thomas_m_fisher,,481.224,483.926,"Well, we can, but we need not, I think is the point."
2007.07-208,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,518.313,523.817,"What if he... what if he wants to communicate not self defense, but that, you know, Martians did it?"
2007.07-208,0,42698,thomas_m_fisher,,533.157,540.596,"--Well, I think we're getting hopefully not into an area where there would be legitimate questions about underlying Dusky competency."
2007.07-208,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,561.859,566.494,"Well, I mean, I'm trying to find some level that is above competency."
2007.07-208,0,42698,thomas_m_fisher,,584.375,599.651,"Well, I do think there's a line that can be drawn between a ridiculous defense that's within the bounds of sort of relevance and possibility, such as, you know, a very ill advised self defense theory, and the idea that the Martians did it, which I think raises substantial questions as to Dusky competency as well."
2007.07-208,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,635.741,651.334,"Do you think... there is always a concern in these cases whether or not we're going to be creating more inefficiencies for the judicial system; that is to say, the trial judge was incorrect in ruling that the trial was becoming a farce."
2007.07-208,0,42698,thomas_m_fisher,,662.225,679.003,"--Well, I think the benefits of the rule, first and foremost, is that the State has and the judicial system has greater certainty that there was a fair trial, that the adversarial process played out in a way that gave the jury, you know, a meaningful decision to make, and also that it conveys to the public that this is a reliable system."
2007.07-208,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,703.385,710.322,Do you think your rule would create an incentive for trial judges in close cases to always deny self representation?
2007.07-208,0,42698,thomas_m_fisher,,716.276,722.88,"Well, I think that they're... trial courts are always going to be concerned about going too far and being reversed on those grounds."
2007.07-208,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,740.658,742.26,What would the standard of review be?
2007.07-208,0,42698,thomas_m_fisher,,751.649,752.099,I think so.
2007.07-208,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,753.382,754.034,Abuse of discretion?
2007.07-208,0,42698,thomas_m_fisher,,754.034,756.201,--very much akin to what we look at with Dusky.
2007.07-208,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,762.59,765.124,But I assume if there is error it would be structural error--
2007.07-208,0,42698,thomas_m_fisher,,765.124,765.475,--Yes.
2007.07-208,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,765.475,767.875,--There would be no room for harmless error analysis.
2007.07-208,0,42698,thomas_m_fisher,,767.875,769.077,I agree with that.
2007.07-208,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,769.077,781.651,"If the State's objective is to make sure that there is a reasonably fair trial or something that resembles a fair trial, isn't that going to result in the denial of self representation in a great number of cases?"
2007.07-208,0,42698,thomas_m_fisher,,781.651,787.039,"Well, I think that... we're not suggesting a rule that is unlimited in that regard."
2007.07-208,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,809.468,823.726,"If it is the case, as a lot of people believe, that it is very... it's the rare case in which a lay defendant can adequately represent himself or herself, then where do you draw the line?"
2007.07-208,0,42698,thomas_m_fisher,,823.726,836.701,"Well, again, I think that there is a qualitative, a real... a sort of realistic line to be drawn between someone who maybe has bad ideas and bad judgments and someone who just cannot communicate what those judgments are."
2007.07-208,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,846.907,850.026,"But in either case, there's a farce."
2007.07-208,0,42698,thomas_m_fisher,,850.026,851.545,"--Well, I think that there--"
2007.07-208,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,851.545,856.699,A very rational highly competent person might want to make the trial a farce.
2007.07-208,0,42698,thomas_m_fisher,,864.453,878.045,"--Because I think that the... the kinds of decisions that someone would make that would be... I think even if well communicated, would demonstrating a farcical trial, would threaten the Dusky competency standard."
2007.07-208,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,891.753,892.122,The State's interests are the same.
2007.07-208,0,42698,thomas_m_fisher,,906.03,922.224,"Well, again, I think that there are limits on what we're arguing, and I think that... that the Wheat case demonstrates how there can be flexibility here in terms of pursuing these fairness interests without overriding completely the self representation interests... or, I'm sorry, the Sixth Amendment interests of a larger set of defendants."
2007.07-208,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,922.224,926.443,"Mr. Fisher, are you making essentially a"
2007.07-208,0,42698,thomas_m_fisher,,971.038,972.074,Right.
2007.07-208,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,987.1,990.536,"Thank you, counsel."
2007.07-208,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,994.753,1025.373,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: There are instances in the trial courts, particularly with respect to mentally ill defendants, where a defendant may have the degree of rational understanding to satisfy the relatively low standard of competence established in Dusky and reaffirmed thereafter, but not have the capability of carrying out the tasks that are needed to be performed in order to try a case without it degenerating into a farce."
2007.07-208,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1065.931,1071.952,"And what's your test, the same test: Inability to communicate no matter how idiotic?"
2007.07-208,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1089.646,1090.315,"--Well, Justice Scalia--"
2007.07-208,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1090.315,1093.533,--Why pick on just the ability to communicate?
2007.07-208,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1099.371,1100.871,"--We agree with that, Justice Scalia."
2007.07-208,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1135.177,1155.608,"Do you worry at all that if we adopt a separate test for the ability to represent yourself, that the inevitable effect will be for the test for being able to be tried to become less and less rigorous?"
2007.07-208,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1155.608,1156.874,"Well, I think--"
2007.07-208,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1156.874,1164.114,"After all, there's no harm done so long as the person can't... is not allowed to represent himself."
2007.07-208,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1179.123,1182.575,"--Well, Justice Scalia, I think that the tests serve different purposes."
2007.07-208,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1292.479,1299.05,"If it gets to be bad, the court can terminate it and say, you know, you can't represent yourself."
2007.07-208,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1300.402,1310.024,"Well, Justice Scalia, I think under existing law that could not be done if the Respondent's view of Faretta is adopted as an absolute rule."
2007.07-208,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1310.024,1313.643,"Sure, it could be done if the trial is, indeed, turning into a farce."
2007.07-208,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1313.643,1316.945,"Well, I think it depends on what you mean by ""turning into a farce""."
2007.07-208,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1372.798,1381.304,May I ask this question: Do you think the inability to speak English would be a factor that the judge could take into account in making this judgment?
2007.07-208,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1381.304,1383.056,"No, I don't think so, Justice Stevens."
2007.07-208,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1417.979,1425.916,"Could we have a rule that even if you are highly competent, if you make the trial into a farce, you forfeit your Faretta right?"
2007.07-208,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1425.916,1428.518,"Yes, you certainly could, Justice Kennedy."
2007.07-208,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1456.52,1461.756,"Well, why not just change the rule about what you can do, once the trial is under way?"
2007.07-208,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1511.57,1532.753,"I think to force the State to have the train wreck occur, when the evidence is very firm and reliable that it will occur, infringes the State's interests in starting the trial from the beginning in a coherent and orderly way and not basically subjecting the defendant to the risk of an unfair trial based on the defendant's own incompetence."
2007.07-208,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1559.536,1562.705,And these were communications made to the judge before the trial started?
2007.07-208,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1562.705,1563.372,That's correct.
2007.07-208,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1605.115,1605.949,"Thank you, Mr. Dreeben."
2007.07-208,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1605.949,1609.586,Thank you.
2007.07-208,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1609.586,1616.007,Mr. Stancil.
2007.07-208,2,36616,mark_thomas_stancil,,1616.007,1626.795,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The expressed premise of the Sixth Amendment and of our adversarial system generally is that the defense belongs to the accused and not to the State."
2007.07-208,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1664.837,1669.741,Do you argue that the State has no interest to be considered in this calculus?
2007.07-208,2,36616,mark_thomas_stancil,,1679.163,1679.997,"No, Your Honor."
2007.07-208,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1696.725,1702.945,"Well, but an individual doesn't have to know and appreciate the rules of courtroom procedure to be judged competent to stand trial."
2007.07-208,2,36616,mark_thomas_stancil,,1702.945,1703.478,--Correct.
2007.07-208,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1709.632,1712.068,"Well, but that's suggesting to me that you give no weight to the State interest."
2007.07-208,2,36616,mark_thomas_stancil,,1726.661,1727.761,"--Two responses, Your Honor."
2007.07-208,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1765.419,1770.173,Can I ask the... it's really the flip side of the question Justice Scalia asked.
2007.07-208,2,36616,mark_thomas_stancil,,1805.83,1809.432,"--Well, I assume you're speaking about competency to stand trial under Dusky?"
2007.07-208,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1809.432,1809.948,Yes.
2007.07-208,2,36616,mark_thomas_stancil,,1809.948,1811.882,"Well, first of all, the States have that option."
2007.07-208,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1819.69,1828.795,"I thought your argument is it's not a choice, that there is only one standard, either you're competent or you're not competent?"
2007.07-208,2,36616,mark_thomas_stancil,,1840.603,1844.405,"Justice Ginsburg, we're speaking about the competency to stand trial."
2007.07-208,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1847.84,1856.796,"When you say they have their choice, you meant they have the choice of elevating the standard that applies to the competency to stand trial if they wish?"
2007.07-208,2,36616,mark_thomas_stancil,,1856.796,1857.496,Correct.
2007.07-208,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1857.496,1865.234,"Well then, why don't they have the choice of elevating the standard for ability to represent themselves in a coherent way at trial?"
2007.07-208,2,36616,mark_thomas_stancil,,1865.234,1865.551,Because--
2007.07-208,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1865.551,1873.824,"That's what understood Godinez to say, that you certainly don't have to elevate your standard, but I didn't understand it to say you can't."
2007.07-208,2,36616,mark_thomas_stancil,,1873.824,1882.18,"--Because the Sixth Amendment says once you get to the adversarial proceeding in court, the State cannot cross to the other side of the courtroom and second guess the defendant's decision."
2007.07-208,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1882.18,1884.296,"Well, it actually doesn't say that."
2007.07-208,2,36616,mark_thomas_stancil,,1884.296,1904.209,"Well, with respect, Your Honor, every Sixth Amendment decision that I'm aware of does not let the court, in the name of second guessing the defendant, whether a decision would benefit the defendant come in and say: Well, for example, you may not want to take the stand in your own defense, because, well, look at you; you've got unsightly tattoos that this jury may find offensive."
2007.07-208,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1909.163,1916.401,"It seems to me that both sides are kind of raising these, taking the arguments to extremes and they don't have to do that."
2007.07-208,2,36616,mark_thomas_stancil,,1924.857,1926.792,The logic I believe is the same.
2007.07-208,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1973.537,1979.791,"But this is a trial judge who has a very practical, immediate concern."
2007.07-208,2,36616,mark_thomas_stancil,,2027.688,2028.754,"No, Your Honor."
2007.07-208,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2050.817,2073.366,"Do you disagree with the point that's made by the American Psychiatric Association that competency is not a unitary concept, that a person can be competent to assist an attorney at trial but not competent to make all of the decisions and perform in some minimally reasonable way the various tasks that have to be performed during the course of a trial?"
2007.07-208,2,36616,mark_thomas_stancil,,2073.366,2074.998,"As a legal matter, yes."
2007.07-208,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2077.251,2079.687,Why shouldn't the law track medicine?
2007.07-208,2,36616,mark_thomas_stancil,,2083.822,2093.51,"--That might have been a fair argument before Godinez, where the APA and other medical organizations advanced this exact argument, and the Court said... and if you'll indulge me, I'd like to quote... it said that:"
2007.07-208,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2108.353,2112.305,"Well, I didn't think this case has been decided by prior precedent."

2007.07-208,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2279.246,2290.271,"Well, but you're putting a heavy burden on the State to say, all right, now... and the prosecution... to say, now we've got to look out for what this guy is going to say, and now we've got to appoint standby counsel."
2007.07-208,2,36616,mark_thomas_stancil,,2303.097,2309.001,"--Well, one, certainly the State's rule has nothing to say about that either."
2007.07-208,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2316.438,2319.356,"Yes, that the State has to incur these extra burdens?"
2007.07-208,2,36616,mark_thomas_stancil,,2319.356,2322.992,--I don't think that's much more of a burden than they do when they're facing a defense lawyer.
2007.07-208,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2322.992,2335.15,"Well, you've presumed in your answer to Justice Breyer... I don't know if you fully answered all of the questions he raised... that this defendant would immediately obey the objection."
2007.07-208,2,36616,mark_thomas_stancil,,2336.484,2336.801,And that--
2007.07-208,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2336.801,2339.103,They don't communicate.
2007.07-208,2,36616,mark_thomas_stancil,,2368.806,2374.027,"--Justice Kennedy, the tool is right in front of the Court in Illinois versus Allen."
2007.07-208,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2385.834,2397.992,"Your response to that, as it was to me, I take it to be: Well, focusing on this subclass, the judge has other ways of dealing with the problem."
2007.07-208,2,36616,mark_thomas_stancil,,2420.505,2426.075,"--Except that, Your Honor, it undermines the fundamental premise of the Sixth Amendment, which is it's his defense."
2007.07-208,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2426.659,2431.796,Are there any psychiatric studies that show how accurate psychiatric studies are?
2007.07-208,2,36616,mark_thomas_stancil,,2433.731,2434.048,--Well--
2007.07-208,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2434.048,2442.837,"That... that estimate, for example, how accurately one can predict whether a particular defendant will indeed be able to defend himself?"
2007.07-208,2,36616,mark_thomas_stancil,,2442.837,2444.021,"--Not to my knowledge, Justice Scalia."
2007.07-208,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2444.021,2444.554,I didn't think so.
2007.07-208,2,36616,mark_thomas_stancil,,2444.554,2449.258,I believe the APA acknowledges in its brief that there's not a lot of literature about--

2007.07-208,2,36616,mark_thomas_stancil,,2464.317,2465.2,--But.
2007.07-208,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2473.24,2476.675,"But Mr. Stancil, I mean, you say make the record."
2007.07-208,2,36616,mark_thomas_stancil,,2556.11,2558.812,"--Extraordinarily remote, for two reasons."

2007.07-208,2,36616,mark_thomas_stancil,,2632.427,2639.7,"Justice Ginsburg, I'm very glad you brought that up, because it illustrates two problems with this... with the armchair psychiatry that the State is urging here."
2007.07-208,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2663.315,2664.748,"Well, take the rest of the paragraph."
2007.07-208,2,36616,mark_thomas_stancil,,2664.748,2666.35,"Yes, but... and if I may--"
2007.07-208,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2666.35,2667.733,You have to stop.
2007.07-208,2,36616,mark_thomas_stancil,,2673.254,2673.954,--Yes.
2007.07-208,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2673.954,2684.895,But the judge says: Does that means I have to sit here and every time he makes a statement like that explain to the jury what he meant?
2007.07-208,2,36616,mark_thomas_stancil,,2701.022,2701.773,"No, Your Honor."
2007.07-208,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2711.962,2713.012,What difference does it make?
2007.07-208,2,36616,mark_thomas_stancil,,2713.012,2714.014,Because that's the reason--
2007.07-208,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2714.014,2720.418,"Because the trial judge has got a problem, and it doesn't matter whether he was on medication or not on medication."
2007.07-208,2,36616,mark_thomas_stancil,,2724.537,2742.766,"--Justice Souter, this defendant was rendered competent to stand trial only by psychiatric medication; and before taking away the right that is... that is inherent in the Sixth Amendment, the judge has to make a record: Is he still competent to stand trial or did he not take his medication this week and that's why, that's why he slipped into incoherence?"
2007.07-208,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2750.921,2758.027,"Well, a great... frankly, a great deal of psychiatric testimony is irreconcilable with the facts."

2007.07-208,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2775.822,2784.927,"Mr. Stancil, can I ask this question: Do you agree that at a certain point in the trial it could become a farce and the judge could declare a mistrial for this reason?"
2007.07-208,2,36616,mark_thomas_stancil,,2784.927,2785.494,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2007.07-208,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2785.494,2788.462,"If he did so, he's going to have a second trial."
2007.07-208,2,36616,mark_thomas_stancil,,2808.726,2809.326,"No, Your Honor."
2007.07-208,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2811.845,2813.212,"Well, you've got a record in open court here."
2007.07-208,2,36616,mark_thomas_stancil,,2813.212,2815.647,"--No, Your Honor, with respect, we do not."
2007.07-208,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2816.982,2825.336,"Well, assume he had a record in open court before the trial started that was just as persuasive as events going sour during a trial."
2007.07-208,2,36616,mark_thomas_stancil,,2825.336,2828.454,"Well, again, I respectfully submit that is not this case."
2007.07-208,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2836.877,2839.479,You don't just have a record in open court.
2007.07-208,2,36616,mark_thomas_stancil,,2843.297,2843.883,--Correct.
2007.07-208,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2843.883,2846.199,That's more than just the stuff that was on the record.
2007.07-208,2,36616,mark_thomas_stancil,,2848.185,2853.172,"As Justice Brennan's concurring opinion in Illinois versus Allen explains, that sort of misconduct can't--"
2007.07-208,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2853.172,2858.141,"Well, Allen was a disruptive conduct case, where he was yelling and he was put out of the court."
2007.07-208,2,36616,mark_thomas_stancil,,2872.733,2875.168,"--I respectfully disagree, Justice Kennedy."
2007.07-208,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2888.162,2891.447,"Well, there's a difference between disrespectful and disruptive."
2007.07-208,2,36616,mark_thomas_stancil,,2902.922,2907.623,"Well, I agree that Mr. Edwards... the record is clear that he was certainly respectful toward the court."
2007.07-208,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2925.101,2937.159,Did the trial judge in this case cite the findings and the observations he made during the competency hearing in open court as... for the support of the ruling?
2007.07-208,2,36616,mark_thomas_stancil,,2937.159,2940.811,He referred seriatim to a list of reports that he had considered.
2007.07-208,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2940.811,2945.281,What about the competency hearing that was held in open court with the defendant?
2007.07-208,2,36616,mark_thomas_stancil,,2945.281,2951.952,"The... it's my understanding that the most recent, the actual hearing where he was rendered competent, did not have a hearing with it."
2007.07-208,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2959.608,2966.528,May I ask this one other question: Do you think the Faretta right includes a right to have no standby counsel?
2007.07-208,2,36616,mark_thomas_stancil,,2966.528,2967.095,"--No, Your Honor."
2007.07-208,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2976.803,2996.797,"Why do you concede that if the trial is not disruptive, the mere fact that this fellow is making an incompetent defense or, indeed, may be making no sense is justification for terminating the trial?"
2007.07-208,2,36616,mark_thomas_stancil,,3043.362,3046.245,"--Justice Scalia, let me make it clear that... I don't know if I've made a concession here."
2007.07-208,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3062.424,3062.79,Right.
2007.07-208,2,36616,mark_thomas_stancil,,3062.79,3064.209,But if I may just return to this fundamental--
2007.07-208,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3064.209,3066.559,Your position is it has to be disruptive.
2007.07-208,2,36616,mark_thomas_stancil,,3070.879,3071.779,--Yes.
2007.07-208,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3086.755,3100.199,"Of course, one way to control these defendants is to say: Mr. Defendant, if you persist in this irrelevant line of inquiry, the court is going to consider whether or not you are competent under the Indiana standard to conduct your self defense."
2007.07-208,2,36616,mark_thomas_stancil,,3101.299,3111.256,"--It would certainly be preferable to what happened here, although I think it still... I think it still has the problem analytically of being inconsistent with the nature of the Sixth Amendment."
2007.07-208,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3111.506,3146.68,"Mr. Stancil, I'm not sure that I'm following your argument, Because if I understand your most recent answers to these questions, it is no longer your position that an individual who is not disruptive, but merely incoherent and making the trial farcical by his incoherent responses or actions... it is no longer your position that an individual who is merely incoherent could be forced in the midst a trial, after this has been demonstrated, to accept standby counsel to manage the trial."
2007.07-208,2,36616,mark_thomas_stancil,,3151.815,3154.383,--I think... let me be perfectly precise.
2007.07-208,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3157.985,3159.437,So to the disruptive point?
2007.07-208,2,36616,mark_thomas_stancil,,3159.437,3160.22,--No.
2007.07-208,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3175.613,3194.51,"Somebody who is totally polite to the Court, who does not scream and yell, who talks only when he is allowed to talk, but talks total and complete nonsense, can never be replaced, in your view, by a standby counsel in the middle of the trial after this has been shown to be the way he's acting; isn't that correct?"
2007.07-208,2,36616,mark_thomas_stancil,,3194.51,3196.862,--I believe we're dealing with... two responses.
2007.07-208,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3196.862,3198.795,"How about ""yes"" or ""no""?"
2007.07-208,2,36616,mark_thomas_stancil,,3200.764,3203.532,"No, Your Honor."
2007.07-208,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3215.257,3222.944,"Well, now you're falling back on the very psychiatric evaluation in the first part of the trial that you disparage in the second."
2007.07-208,2,36616,mark_thomas_stancil,,3222.944,3223.596,"--No, Justice Kennedy."
2007.07-208,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3244.443,3250.247,"In your judgment, was the Dusky determination in this case erroneous?"
2007.07-208,2,36616,mark_thomas_stancil,,3257.001,3261.303,"--I think the record... on the current state of the record, yes, because his--"
2007.07-208,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3261.303,3263.321,He should have been found incompetent.
2007.07-208,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3263.321,3267.107,"Except, as you say, we don't know whether he was on his medication or not."
2007.07-208,2,36616,mark_thomas_stancil,,3267.107,3267.44,--Correct.
2007.07-208,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3272.777,3273.778,"I still don't know your ""yes"" or ""no"" answer."
2007.07-208,2,36616,mark_thomas_stancil,,3281.116,3282.182,--I believe it comes and goes.
2007.07-208,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3284.684,3290.222,"Was he competent to stand trial, in your view as you now understand this record?"
2007.07-208,2,36616,mark_thomas_stancil,,3290.222,3291.822,"At the time of trial, yes, he was."
2007.07-208,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3308.617,3312.235,There are all kinds of nuts who could get 90 percent on the bar exam.
2007.07-208,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3320.424,3344.123,"Mr. Stancil, you do agree that the basic precedent on which you rely, Faretta, you would be... you are asking for an extension of it because that case starts out with a defendant who is described as literate, competent, understanding."
2007.07-208,2,36616,mark_thomas_stancil,,3344.123,3344.907,"No, Justice Ginsburg."
2007.07-208,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3363.018,3372.207,"And was there anything in the record showing that he had, that Faretta had, mental delusions, mental disease?"
2007.07-208,2,36616,mark_thomas_stancil,,3372.207,3374.192,"Not that I'm aware of, but in Godinez there was."
2007.07-208,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3390.671,3393.622,But the judicial posture there was a little different.
2007.07-208,2,36616,mark_thomas_stancil,,3398.291,3399.526,"--Correct, Justice Ginsburg."
2007.07-208,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3418.388,3419.755,Finish your thought.
2007.07-208,2,36616,mark_thomas_stancil,,3419.755,3425.009,--A criminal defendant's ability to represent himself has no bearing upon his competence for self representation.
2007.07-208,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3425.009,3427.044,"Thank you, Mr. Stancil."
2007.07-208,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3431.746,3439.518,"Mr. Fisher, what if the defendant here promised to sit silent during the trial as the defendant did in Godinez?"
2007.07-208,3,42698,thomas_m_fisher,,3442.036,3445.155,"Well, I think the defendant in Godinez was pleading guilty."
2007.07-208,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3461.098,3462.684,"But, he could certainly sit silent."
2007.07-208,3,42698,thomas_m_fisher,,3466.319,3475.341,I think it does present a different situation if the defendant sits silent and relies only on the reasonable doubt instruction than to have a defendant who is going to present an actual defense.
2007.07-208,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3507.978,3510.545,Maybe he writes badly.
2007.07-208,3,42698,thomas_m_fisher,,3510.545,3511.014,"Well, no."
2007.07-208,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3602.857,3609.594,"How fair does a trial seem to the public where the defendant stands up and says, Your Honor, I want to represent myself?"
2007.07-208,3,42698,thomas_m_fisher,,3621.401,3624.536,--I think it... I think many in the public would think that that was fair.
2007.07-208,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3639.296,3646.967,I take it standard competency principles laid down by this Court require that the defendant be present and that he testify if requested.
2007.07-208,3,42698,thomas_m_fisher,,3653.287,3653.671,Right.
2007.07-208,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3666.862,3667.729,"Thank you, Mr. Fisher."
