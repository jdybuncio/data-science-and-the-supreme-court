1973.72-1603,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,27.366,"We’ll hear arguments next in 72-1603, Cardwell against Lewis."
1973.72-1603,0,34246,leo_j_conway,,29.617,33.516,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1973.72-1603,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,441.724,443.449,Who issued the arrest warrant?
1973.72-1603,0,34246,leo_j_conway,,443.449,451.865,"The arrest warrant was issued by the justice in Delaware County, Ohio wherein the crime was committed."
1973.72-1603,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,451.865,455.442,"And that was servable anywhere in the state, was it not?"
1973.72-1603,0,34246,leo_j_conway,,455.442,456.868,That’s right.
1973.72-1603,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,461.109,463.942,And the same judge could’ve issued the search warrant?
1973.72-1603,0,34246,leo_j_conway,,463.942,464.485,I beg your pardon?
1973.72-1603,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,464.485,466.965,The same judge had authority to issue a search warrant?
1973.72-1603,0,34246,leo_j_conway,,466.965,477.044,"The same judge had authority to issue a search warrant, Your Honor, but only for those things that they wanted to search in the County of Delaware."
1973.72-1603,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,483.394,488.383,"Now, it was served you say by a -- not a common police judge."
1973.72-1603,0,34246,leo_j_conway,,489.851,490.979,By a municipal judge.
1973.72-1603,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,490.979,491.719,By a municipal judge.
1973.72-1603,0,34246,leo_j_conway,,491.719,504.023,"That’s right, Your Honor, but it wouldn’t have made any difference because had a common police judge of Delaware County issued a search warrant, it would’ve been invalid in Franklin County where the car or automobile was seized."
1973.72-1603,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,504.023,516.705,"Did I understand that, at the time the arrest warrant was obtained, the authorities, at least some of the authorities, already knew that it was something involving the gold automobile?"
1973.72-1603,0,34246,leo_j_conway,,516.705,517.967,"That’s right, Your Honor."
1973.72-1603,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,517.967,523.932,Do they know -- have they found the automobile that had been pushed over the embankment?
1973.72-1603,0,34246,leo_j_conway,,523.932,526.686,"Well, that was found on the day of the crime, Your Honor."
1973.72-1603,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,544.907,556.747,"Well, to get a warrant – the search -- the seize and search of the gold automobile, to whom would the authorities have to apply to get that one?"
1973.72-1603,0,34246,leo_j_conway,,556.747,562.446,"Well, they would have had to apply to a justice in the county wherein they knew the automobile was."
1973.72-1603,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,562.446,563.965,And what county was that?
1973.72-1603,0,34246,leo_j_conway,,563.965,569.97,"Ultimately, the car was seized in Jackson County -- in Franklin County and --"
1973.72-1603,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,569.97,571.634,Adjoining Delaware?
1973.72-1603,0,34246,leo_j_conway,,571.634,573.421,Immediately adjoining Delaware County.
1973.72-1603,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,573.421,579.971,"Well, is there any reason why at the same time they went to a municipal judge to get the arrest warrant in Delaware?"
1973.72-1603,0,34246,leo_j_conway,,584.92,585.332,"Yes, sir."
1973.72-1603,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,597.624,599.545,When did they find out where the automobile was?
1973.72-1603,0,34246,leo_j_conway,,599.545,612.103,"At 5 o’clock in the afternoon of the -- or 5 or 5:30, the record is not exactly clear, but it was on the late afternoon of the 20th day of October."
1973.72-1603,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,612.103,612.745,Following the arrest?
1973.72-1603,0,34246,leo_j_conway,,612.745,614.686,Following the arrest.
1973.72-1603,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,614.686,620.524,And was that the same day the -- was the arrest the same day the arrest warrant was obtained?
1973.72-1603,0,34246,leo_j_conway,,620.524,621.184,That’s right.
1973.72-1603,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,621.184,624.498,And how did they find out?
1973.72-1603,0,34246,leo_j_conway,,624.498,634.352,"At the time that he was arrested, Mr. Lewis took a ticket out of his pocket."
1973.72-1603,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,638.396,639.131,A parking ticket?
1973.72-1603,0,34246,leo_j_conway,,639.131,641.273,A parking ticket presumably --
1973.72-1603,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,641.273,642.011,For a parking lot?
1973.72-1603,0,34246,leo_j_conway,,642.011,652.708,"That’s right, Your Honor and the parking lot was two doors from the Office of the Attorney General wherein the arrest was made."
1973.72-1603,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,697.937,711.993,"Was there any reason once they got the parking ticket, whatever version was the correct, once they discovered where the automobile was, any reason they didn’t then go to a municipal judge in Jackson County and get a search warrant?"
1973.72-1603,0,34246,leo_j_conway,,711.993,716.934,"I think there was a very good reason, Your Honor."
1973.72-1603,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,751.9,756.692,How far was the judge from the Attorney General’s Office?
1973.72-1603,0,34246,leo_j_conway,,756.692,760.127,"Well, I would say within half a mile, Your Honor."
1973.72-1603,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,767.616,768.956,And there was a judge available.
1973.72-1603,0,34246,leo_j_conway,,768.956,772.84,I’m sure there would’ve been a judge available.
1973.72-1603,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,786.512,789.788,They couldn’t have stopped the car from being driven away?
1973.72-1603,0,34246,leo_j_conway,,789.788,791.918,"Well, certainly they can, Your Honor."
1973.72-1603,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,807.182,808.604,For about 15 minutes?
1973.72-1603,0,34246,leo_j_conway,,808.604,809.386,That’s right.
1973.72-1603,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,809.386,811.112,And he could’ve sued for that again?
1973.72-1603,0,34246,leo_j_conway,,811.112,812.375,I think he could’ve.
1973.72-1603,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,812.375,813.546,So that would be horrible.
1973.72-1603,0,34246,leo_j_conway,,814.964,816.618,Well --
1973.72-1603,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,816.618,823.07,Would you say that would constitute a seizure of the car at that time if they put four policemen hypothetically?
1973.72-1603,0,34246,leo_j_conway,,823.07,835.587,"It is my contention, Your Honor, Mr. Chief Justice, that had they put a policeman on the car at that time to guard it against seizure that they, in effect, would’ve been seizing it right then."
1973.72-1603,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,835.587,837.888,Who had the parking ticket?
1973.72-1603,0,34246,leo_j_conway,,837.888,840.49,You mean at the time the car was seized?
1973.72-1603,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,840.49,841.249,Yes.
1973.72-1603,0,34246,leo_j_conway,,841.249,847.031,"Well, it’d been turned over by the attorney to the arresting officer --"
1973.72-1603,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,847.031,847.864,The police had it.
1973.72-1603,0,34246,leo_j_conway,,847.864,848.456,And they then--
1973.72-1603,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,848.456,851.045,"I take it the keys are in the car, is that it?"
1973.72-1603,0,34246,leo_j_conway,,851.045,855.478,There’s also some difference in that.
1973.72-1603,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,859.231,859.727,To the police?
1973.72-1603,0,34246,leo_j_conway,,859.727,868.0,"To the police at the same time he returned the parking lot ticket over and as a matter of fact, that is actually --"
1973.72-1603,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,868.0,871.787,"Now, if that were true, who was going to drive it away?"
1973.72-1603,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,872.507,887.963,We’ll resume there after lunch.[Luncheon Recess]
1973.72-1603,0,34246,leo_j_conway,,890.076,891.097,Thank you.
1973.72-1603,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,932.119,934.648,Without the parking ticket?
1973.72-1603,0,34246,leo_j_conway,,934.648,944.005,"Not without the parking ticket, but I was assuming of course that the keys and the parking ticket went together regardless."
1973.72-1603,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,944.005,946.148,I thought you said the police had the parking ticket.
1973.72-1603,0,34246,leo_j_conway,,946.148,948.704,The police had the parking ticket.
1973.72-1603,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1308.867,1310.63,Was the lot opened to the public?
1973.72-1603,0,34246,leo_j_conway,,1313.48,1316.141,"That’s right, Your Honor."
1973.72-1603,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1316.881,1321.687,Would that not be the equivalent of the seizure if they’d taken part of the car?
1973.72-1603,0,34246,leo_j_conway,,1321.687,1326.017,"It is -- I do not believe so, Your Honor."
1973.72-1603,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1327.016,1327.344,Even a small part?
1973.72-1603,0,34246,leo_j_conway,,1327.344,1327.393,Even the --
1973.72-1603,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1327.393,1328.807,Even the small part like the paint?
1973.72-1603,0,34246,leo_j_conway,,1328.807,1333.793,"They would’ve been seizing something in plain view, it was our position."
1973.72-1603,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1582.064,1587.707,"General Conway, this case comes through some federal habeas, doesn’t it?"
1973.72-1603,0,34246,leo_j_conway,,1587.707,1588.669,"That’s right, Your Honor."
1973.72-1603,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1588.669,1597.594,And I take it from your brief that you’re not questioning the integrity of Kaufman against the Untied States?
1973.72-1603,0,34246,leo_j_conway,,1597.594,1608.956,"No, I’m not, Your Honor."
1973.72-1603,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1608.956,1611.084,Mr. Frey.
1973.72-1603,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1611.084,1615.047,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1973.72-1603,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2016.179,2017.126,Mr. Frey.
1973.72-1603,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2017.126,2018.296,Yes?
1973.72-1603,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2018.296,2030.666,"You’re talking in terms of privacy, but the Court in Katz did say that the Fourth Amendment can’t be translated into a general constitutional right to privacy, isn’t it?"
1973.72-1603,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2030.666,2038.899,"Well, but it recognized also in Katz that property interests too are protected by the Fourth Amendment."
1973.72-1603,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2071.623,2096.596,"I understand your privacy argument directed to distinguishing this case from Coolidge where in order to take the car in the Coolidge case, they had to invade at least the privacy of the man’s home and dwelling and garage and here, it was a private parking lot and no expectation of that kind of privacy?"
1973.72-1603,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2096.596,2106.733,"That is true, although I think our argument -- that consideration is a consideration which distinguishes Coolidge from this case in two respects."
1973.72-1603,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2509.012,2510.605,"Very well, Mr. Frey."
1973.72-1603,2,17513,bruce_a_campbell,,2517.132,2521.498,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1973.72-1603,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3184.504,3193.803,"Mr. Campbell, do you understand that, here, in this argument in this Court, that either Mr. Conway or Mr. Frey are relying on consent?"
1973.72-1603,2,17513,bruce_a_campbell,,3195.875,3207.577,"Well, Your Honor, in the brief for the State of Ohio, consent is raised at least in the way that the state presents its case."
1973.72-1603,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3231.447,3232.54,I perhaps missed it.
1973.72-1603,2,17513,bruce_a_campbell,,3238.588,3240.863,I think in the case of the --
1973.72-1603,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3240.863,3244.698,The holding is against him in both of the Federal Courts.
1973.72-1603,2,17513,bruce_a_campbell,,3244.698,3246.534,"Yes, it is, Your Honor."
1973.72-1603,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3246.534,3248.869,I didn’t understand that that was being attacked?
1973.72-1603,2,17513,bruce_a_campbell,,3248.869,3275.706,"I think in the case of the Solicitor General’s brief that it is something of an argument in passing, but he does raise the possibility that there may have been sufficient consent here to merit a taking into custody and then he argues from that that what followed was not really a search at all and that it was justified very much in the line that this Court justified Cooper."
1973.72-1603,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3336.592,3339.401,"Would it make any difference to our questions here, do you think?"
1973.72-1603,2,17513,bruce_a_campbell,,3339.401,3343.122,"None, Your Honor, from my point of view."
1973.72-1603,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3426.536,3433.032,"Mr. Campbell, how about the -- and maybe there have been cases of this kind, I don’t have any in mind."
1973.72-1603,2,17513,bruce_a_campbell,,3469.554,3470.538,"I’m not aware of any, Your Honor."
1973.72-1603,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3470.538,3471.795,Not either.
1973.72-1603,2,17513,bruce_a_campbell,,3471.795,3475.538,I believe that that case would be precisely the same as this case.
1973.72-1603,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3475.538,3476.52,It would be very close in that.
1973.72-1603,2,17513,bruce_a_campbell,,3476.52,3477.602,The warrant would be required.
1973.72-1603,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3477.602,3479.163,"Analytically, anyway, wouldn’t it?"
1973.72-1603,2,17513,bruce_a_campbell,,3479.163,3479.749,I would think so.
1973.72-1603,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3479.749,3498.031,"And why if the police had the key perfectly lawfully, as by the hypothesis of my hypothetical question they do, why they can’t they simply use the key?"
1973.72-1603,2,17513,bruce_a_campbell,,3498.031,3507.052,Because the key does not subsume the identity of the object to which it admits one.
1973.72-1603,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3536.326,3541.164,Let me give you a slight variation of Justice Stewart’s hypothetical.
1973.72-1603,2,17513,bruce_a_campbell,,3580.092,3584.492,"I believe that they would have to have a warrant, Your Honor, under the same rational."
1973.72-1603,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3584.492,3587.688,You really got to take that position or abandon your own --
1973.72-1603,2,17513,bruce_a_campbell,,3587.688,3587.967,Yes.
1973.72-1603,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3587.967,3588.565,-- don’t you?
1973.72-1603,2,17513,bruce_a_campbell,,3588.565,3589.805,And I do take that position.
1973.72-1603,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3589.805,3603.354,"Well, I take it if you didn’t take that position you’d have some difficulty distinguishing in this very case, if he had a key ring and on that ring were not only the keys to the car, but the keys to his house."
1973.72-1603,2,17513,bruce_a_campbell,,3613.454,3625.983,"I would think if the Court were to hold that the seizure of the car key was tantamount to the seizure of the car itself, then the logical extension of that would be that the seizure of the house key was indeed the seizure of the house."
1973.72-1603,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3625.983,3629.834,"The courts made some distinctions between automobiles and homes, has it not?"
1973.72-1603,2,17513,bruce_a_campbell,,3629.834,3630.946,"It has, Your Honor."
1973.72-1603,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3630.946,3633.234,But not between keys?
1973.72-1603,2,17513,bruce_a_campbell,,3633.234,3634.169,No.
1973.72-1603,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3634.169,3652.531,"Mr. Campbell, as I understand the position, if he’d driven that car and left it outside the Attorney General’s Office parking lot, could they stay to have chipped a piece of that paint off and test it?"
1973.72-1603,2,17513,bruce_a_campbell,,3652.531,3653.794,"At the parking lot, Your Honor?"
1973.72-1603,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3653.794,3660.477,"No, sir, in the street right in front of the Attorney General’s Office?"
1973.72-1603,2,17513,bruce_a_campbell,,3660.477,3677.581,"Your Honor, I would make no distinction in this case between the parking on a commercial parking lot and the parking in any area that is legally designated for the parking of an automobile."
1973.72-1603,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3684.37,3687.813,"Well, is it the private nature of the car?"
1973.72-1603,2,17513,bruce_a_campbell,,3687.813,3690.41,"Yes, Your Honor, as long as that car --"
1973.72-1603,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3690.41,3693.159,But this was the bumper.
1973.72-1603,2,17513,bruce_a_campbell,,3714.296,3730.576,"The thing that’s wrong with that, Your Honor, is that, in my view it is a seizure and, as such, it should have been justified by a warrant if indeed there was time to get a warrant."
1973.72-1603,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3730.576,3734.088,"Well, that would go for things in plain view?"
1973.72-1603,2,17513,bruce_a_campbell,,3734.088,3735.879,"No, Your Honor, I do not --"
1973.72-1603,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3735.879,3744.904,"Well, suppose laying on the front of the bumper was a can of paint, could you seize that?"
1973.72-1603,2,17513,bruce_a_campbell,,3744.904,3747.675,"Quite possibly, yes."
1973.72-1603,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3747.675,3751.296,"But once you touch the bumper, you get in trouble?"
1973.72-1603,2,17513,bruce_a_campbell,,3751.296,3758.34,"Well, the can of paint, I would take it, would not be an integral part of the car itself and not --"
1973.72-1603,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3758.34,3774.955,"I understand that Solicitor General’s position is that the car, there’s no question of going into or violating anything to just chip a piece of paint off of the outside of the car?"
1973.72-1603,2,17513,bruce_a_campbell,,3774.955,3776.364,That seems to be his position.
1973.72-1603,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3778.162,3780.513,"Well, I wonder if you could take it a little further."
1973.72-1603,2,17513,bruce_a_campbell,,3788.004,3789.355,"Absolutely, Your Honor."
1973.72-1603,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3789.355,3790.369,Why?
1973.72-1603,2,17513,bruce_a_campbell,,3790.369,3793.88,Because it is an integral part of that house.
1973.72-1603,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3794.965,3798.274,"Well, there is no search involved, is there?"
1973.72-1603,2,17513,bruce_a_campbell,,3798.274,3801.791,There is at the point after the seizure.
1973.72-1603,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3806.232,3813.053,Oh!
1973.72-1603,2,17513,bruce_a_campbell,,3813.053,3821.747,I do not believe that any of the cases cited by the petitioner are helpful here.
1973.72-1603,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3893.934,3924.739,"If after they got the keys and the ticket to the parking lot so that the police had access, they had then placed four policemen over on the parking lot with orders to the parking lot attendant not to permit anyone to take that car away and informing the attendant that they were there to enforce that direction."
1973.72-1603,2,17513,bruce_a_campbell,,3938.661,3943.286,"Your Honor, first, let me say that I do not believe that was required in this case."
1973.72-1603,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4028.207,4053.977,"Well, to make that analysis, if I may interrupt you a moment more, to make that analysis that you’ve just made you must confront the situation that while the four policemen were standing guard on the car on this restriction on its movement, some member of the family or some other person came to the parking lot with a set of keys, made claim to the car and sought to take it away."
1973.72-1603,2,17513,bruce_a_campbell,,4064.97,4066.095,"No, Your Honor, I do not believe --"
1973.72-1603,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4066.095,4072.205,"The police refuse to let the man’s wife take the car away, let us say, or his lawyer?"
1973.72-1603,2,17513,bruce_a_campbell,,4072.205,4093.353,"I believe that it is possible to distinguish that kind of temporary keeping for a reasonable time while a warrant is sought from a seizure itself and I believe that that kind of distinction might be helpful in another case, but I don’t believe that it was the reality of this case and necessary here."
1973.72-1603,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4263.544,4267.919,"Mr. Campbell, Mr. Lewis live in Franklin County?"
1973.72-1603,2,17513,bruce_a_campbell,,4267.919,4272.167,"Your Honor, it is not clear to me whether his home was in Franklin County or Delaware County."
1973.72-1603,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4276.427,4278.507,And the record just doesn’t show.
1973.72-1603,2,17513,bruce_a_campbell,,4278.507,4280.381,"If it does, I’m sorry."
1973.72-1603,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4481.236,4488.786,"Mr. Lewis was there in the office of the special branch of the Attorney General’s Office most of the day, wasn’t he?"
1973.72-1603,2,17513,bruce_a_campbell,,4488.786,4501.71,"He was there from 10 o’clock in the morning until arrested at 5:30 with the exception of a brief period when he left in the company of the officers and went to his home and with his own consent, he searched his house for --"
1973.72-1603,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4501.71,4505.287,That was back in Delaware County which is a contiguous county?
1973.72-1603,2,17513,bruce_a_campbell,,4505.287,4510.402,"Well, Your Honor, I still don’t know precisely whether the house was in Delaware County or Franklin County."
1973.72-1603,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4510.402,4511.731,"I see, but --"
1973.72-1603,2,17513,bruce_a_campbell,,4511.731,4512.172,Mr. Conway --
1973.72-1603,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4512.172,4521.803,"-- in any event, for six or seven hours, is there anything that we know as to what occurred during that long period of time?"
1973.72-1603,2,17513,bruce_a_campbell,,4521.803,4530.79,"Well, Your Honor, other than the transcript that we have of that interrogation, no or do I understand your question correctly?"
1973.72-1603,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4530.79,4536.237,"Well, what -- do we have a transcript of what occurred there for that whole period from 10:00 a.m. until 5:30 p.m. --"
1973.72-1603,2,17513,bruce_a_campbell,,4536.237,4536.557,We have a trans--
1973.72-1603,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4536.557,4539.551,-- with the exception of that period that he went back to his house?
1973.72-1603,2,17513,bruce_a_campbell,,4539.551,4558.132,"We have what the state has claimed to be an accurate transcript of the questioning that took place starting about 10:30 until about 3:00 in the afternoon when -- or 3:30 in the afternoon, when Mr. Lewis finally said that “I want a lawyer.”"
1973.72-1603,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4562.102,4577.48,And you’re just starting to tell us now that nothing emerged from that interrogation or that discussion that was any different with the exception of one minor change in his version of something.
1973.72-1603,2,17513,bruce_a_campbell,,4578.565,4581.404,"The only -- yes, that’s the only thing that emerged during that."
1973.72-1603,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4726.693,4739.714,"Mr. Campbell, I suppose you would concede that a number of cases of this Court, Carol and Chambers and Cady, have said that a car is quite different for a Fourth Amendment purposes than a man’s home."
1973.72-1603,2,17513,bruce_a_campbell,,4739.714,4740.17,"I do, Your Honor."
1973.72-1603,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4740.17,4746.863,"That doesn’t, I realize, answer the question you’re addressing yourself to, whether conceding that difference, it still has Fourth Amendment protection."
1973.72-1603,2,17513,bruce_a_campbell,,4746.863,4768.23,"Well, I think the difference is that whether you start at the outset and say automobiles are to be set apart under the Fourth Amendment or whether you say that they are included in Fourth Amendment coverage, but the way in which we deal with them may have to be different based on their mobility."
1973.72-1603,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4768.23,4773.469,Would you say a motorcycle is tantamount to a car for purposes of your argument?
1973.72-1603,2,17513,bruce_a_campbell,,4773.469,4775.181,"Yes, I would."
1973.72-1603,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4775.181,4776.554,How about a bicycle?
1973.72-1603,2,17513,bruce_a_campbell,,4776.554,4779.91,"Yes, sir."
1973.72-1603,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4805.768,4817.938,"Well, that would be an interesting analogy if this were a search inside the automobile, but this is not quite that and the Government makes a good deal of that and, I guess, Mr. Conway does too."
1973.72-1603,2,17513,bruce_a_campbell,,4820.792,4821.219,"Well, Your Honor, there were --"
1973.72-1603,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4821.219,4824.069,If you are analogizing it to a dwelling and --
1973.72-1603,2,17513,bruce_a_campbell,,4824.069,4824.745,"There was, Your Honor--"
1973.72-1603,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4824.745,4825.906,There was no entry into it.
1973.72-1603,2,17513,bruce_a_campbell,,4830.866,4838.089,"Well, I would take the position that scraping is an entry into the automobile and, also, I would point out --"
1973.72-1603,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4838.089,4842.603,"Well, he didn’t live -- he may have lived in his automobile, but he didn’t live sitting on the bumper, that’s the point?"
1973.72-1603,2,17513,bruce_a_campbell,,4842.603,4846.338,"I grant you that, Your Honor."
1973.72-1603,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4846.533,4849.313,How much of clothing did you find in the car?
1973.72-1603,2,17513,bruce_a_campbell,,4849.313,4850.191,"I beg your pardon, Your Honor?"
1973.72-1603,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4850.191,4851.982,They didn’t find any clothing in the car.
1973.72-1603,2,17513,bruce_a_campbell,,4853.873,4854.448,"No, Your Honor."
1973.72-1603,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4854.448,4857.394,"Well, where do you get this living in the car business?"
1973.72-1603,2,17513,bruce_a_campbell,,4857.394,4857.933,Well --
1973.72-1603,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4857.933,4860.237,"You pulled that right out of the sky, didn’t you?"
1973.72-1603,2,17513,bruce_a_campbell,,4860.237,4861.588,"No, Your Honor, I don’t think so."
1973.72-1603,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5039.081,5043.308,I don’t quite understand what you mean by prospective or retrospective probable cause?
1973.72-1603,2,17513,bruce_a_campbell,,5043.308,5057.374,"Well, I’m speaking of going to a magistrate in the first instance and securing a warrant as opposed to going ahead, making the search, and then later in court justifying the probable cause."
1973.72-1603,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5057.374,5058.096,I see.
1973.72-1603,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,5058.096,5062.309,"Mr. Campbell, may I ask you a very different question before you sit down."
1973.72-1603,2,17513,bruce_a_campbell,,5062.309,5063.648,"Yes, Your Honor."
1973.72-1603,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,5063.648,5074.15,"There’s no question in this case, is there, that the Fourth Amendment issue that you’ve been arguing was considered at every stage of the State Court proceedings?"
1973.72-1603,2,17513,bruce_a_campbell,,5074.15,5075.761,"There is no question of that, Your Honor."
1973.72-1603,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,5075.761,5081.45,And those proceedings included the Trial Court and the Intermediate Appellate Court and the Supreme Court of Ohio?
1973.72-1603,2,17513,bruce_a_campbell,,5081.45,5082.456,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1973.72-1603,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,5082.456,5087.549,A single Federal District Judge just set all of that aside?
1973.72-1603,2,17513,bruce_a_campbell,,5087.549,5092.522,"He has on the basis, Your Honor, that those courts improperly applied --"
1973.72-1603,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,5092.522,5094.03,I understand what basis is.
1973.72-1603,2,17513,bruce_a_campbell,,5094.03,5098.276,The constitutional principles involved.
1973.72-1603,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5137.951,5138.892,"Thank you, Mr. Campbell."
1973.72-1603,3,15933,andrew_l_frey,,5145.61,5148.333,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1973.72-1603,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5169.96,5172.833,"When did -- are you going to suggest, when they did --"
1973.72-1603,3,15933,andrew_l_frey,,5172.833,5181.253,I think they learned of it at the time that the arrest took place and they obtained the claim check for that parking lot.
1973.72-1603,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5181.253,5183.515,They could’ve asked.
1973.72-1603,3,15933,andrew_l_frey,,5183.515,5184.178,They could’ve asked.
1973.72-1603,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5184.178,5185.945,At 10 o’clock.
1973.72-1603,3,15933,andrew_l_frey,,5185.945,5190.408,They could’ve asked at 10 o’clock yes.
1973.72-1603,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5260.007,5265.459,Is Mr. Campbell correct if there was no finding in any of the Ohio --
1973.72-1603,3,15933,andrew_l_frey,,5265.459,5267.054,There was no finding with consent.
1973.72-1603,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5267.054,5268.583,In any of the Ohio courts?
1973.72-1603,3,15933,andrew_l_frey,,5271.25,5274.688,I believe that’s right.
1973.72-1603,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5406.234,5407.032,Thank you gentlemen.
