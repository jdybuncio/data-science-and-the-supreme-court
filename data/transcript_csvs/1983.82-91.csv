1983.82-91,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,10.859,We will hear first this morning Immigration and Naturalization Service v. Padungsri Phinpathya.
1983.82-91,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,15.742,22.796,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1983.82-91,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,235.986,241.69,"Mr. Schulder, did the Service bring any kind of proceeding against the husband?"
1983.82-91,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,241.69,242.659,"Yes, it did."
1983.82-91,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,242.659,244.141,What is the status of that one?
1983.82-91,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,244.141,268.147,"The husband's proceeding... The Immigration judge found the husband had met the requirements of the statute and was eligible, and I believe the judge found that the husband should be granted relief under the suspension of deportation statute."
1983.82-91,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,284.717,286.817,"As far as you know he, too, is still in this country."
1983.82-91,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,286.817,288.139,That is correct.
1983.82-91,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,288.139,294.735,"Mr. Schulder, as long as you are interrupted what is the status of any reapplication now by the Petitioner?"
1983.82-91,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,294.735,318.74,Petitioner reapplied for suspension of deportation before the Board of Immigration Appeals while after this Court granted certiorari she argued that more than seven years had elapsed since the 1974 trip and claimed that she was entitled to have her deportation proceedings reopened for a new application for suspension of deportation.
1983.82-91,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,324.882,334.329,It is your position that that does not make this case moot because of the discretionary nature of that proceeding.
1983.82-91,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,334.329,335.39,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1983.82-91,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,432.663,437.196,You said you accept the Fleuti standards for the purposes of this case.
1983.82-91,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,441.25,450.666,"--No, Your Honor, but just in the... I am arguing this case in the context of the Court's decision and the issues that are--"
1983.82-91,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,450.666,455.818,--Put you are not suggesting that the Agency no longer wants to follow the Fleuti standard?
1983.82-91,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,455.818,456.179,"--Oh, no."
1983.82-91,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,518.64,530.698,"Mr. Schulder, is it not also true that the Court relied on the comparison of the test of residence where there could be more substantial interruptions under the residence standard in the Fleuti opinion?"
1983.82-91,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,541.424,542.867,You are saying the Court of Appeals in this case?
1983.82-91,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,542.867,543.365,"No, no."
1983.82-91,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,559.456,559.937,That is true.
1983.82-91,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,563.37,563.848,Right.
1983.82-91,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,563.848,571.485,"Of course, this case involves a separate statute which does not refer to residence but which refers to physical presence."
1983.82-91,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,571.485,572.086,Right.
1983.82-91,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,572.086,578.361,"In fact, the statute had been amended to exclude residence and to insert physical presence into the statute."
1983.82-91,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,578.361,580.574,Did Fleuti involve the same statute?
1983.82-91,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,580.574,583.789,"No, Fleuti involved a different provision of the Immigration Act."
1983.82-91,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,583.789,585.649,In your opinion that makes no difference?
1983.82-91,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,585.649,610.754,"Well, as I said before since 1964 when the Ninth Circuit applied the same test that had been developed by this Court in Fleuti for the separate statutory context of the suspension of deportation statute both the courts and the Board of Immigration Appeals have applied the Fleuti standards."
1983.82-91,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,653.303,658.906,Under the plain language of the statute where do you find the flexibility?
1983.82-91,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,658.906,665.501,The plain language of the statute I would--
1983.82-91,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,665.501,667.151,Is not flexible is it?
1983.82-91,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,667.151,670.214,--certainly would not tend to support a flexible reading.
1983.82-91,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,670.214,673.787,Is there anything in the legislative history that suggests flexibility?
1983.82-91,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,673.787,687.354,The only thing in the legislative history that might suggest flexibility is the history of the suspension of deportation statute before the insertion of the particular language at issue here.
1983.82-91,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,704.217,712.913,Is there anything in the legislative history that suggests an absence of congressional intent to provide flexibility?
1983.82-91,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,712.913,725.711,"Yes, there are indications in the legislative history that indicate that Congress meant the statute to be construed quite strictly if not literally."
1983.82-91,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,725.711,729.522,"If so, why does the Solicitor General take the position you have stated here?"
1983.82-91,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,729.522,747.885,The reason for our position essentially is that the Board of Immigration Appeals which is the delegate of the Attorney General and has been administering this statute has in a sense acquiesced in the application of the Fleuti standards to this particular statute.
1983.82-91,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,808.202,810.874,Did the government seek certiorari in the Wadman case?
1983.82-91,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,810.874,813.207,"--No, I do not believe so."
1983.82-91,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,880.522,884.225,"Mr. Schulder, could I ask one question?"
1983.82-91,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,905.576,910.922,I think it would be the government's position that three months is simply too substantial a period of time.
1983.82-91,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,910.922,912.792,How about one month?
1983.82-91,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,912.792,913.613,Excuse me?
1983.82-91,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,913.613,914.993,How about one month?
1983.82-91,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,914.993,926.9,"Well, as we say in our brief we do not think that the Fleuti test establishes bright lines as to what the quantum is of--"
1983.82-91,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,926.9,930.003,What is the standard of judicial review?
1983.82-91,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,930.003,935.656,--The standard of judicial--
1983.82-91,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,935.656,939.67,You are asking us to say this is unreasonable?
1983.82-91,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,939.67,952.798,"--Well, we are asking the Court to apply the test that was established in Fleuti and to conclude that the test that was created by the Court of Appeals in this case is totally inconsistent with Fleuti."
1983.82-91,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,952.798,954.2,Totally inconsistent.
1983.82-91,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,954.2,955.031,That is correct.
1983.82-91,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,955.031,958.393,Because of all of the factors or just the three months?
1983.82-91,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,958.393,993.516,"No, because what the Court of Appeals did here was essentially ignored all of the factors that were enumerated in Fleuti and said that even though there was an absence of three months, even though there were travel documents obtained, even though there was a misrepresentation about status in order to reenter so long as the alien can show that there are hardships associated with deportation then the alien has established continuous physical presence for a seven-year period even though she was gone for three months."
1983.82-91,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,996.926,1018.841,What would you say about a three-month absence which was explained by the individual showing that he became ill on arriving in Thailand and was not permitted by the doctors to leave until he had fully recovered three months later?
1983.82-91,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,1021.823,1031.931,It would seem to me that that certainly would satisfy the standards of the Immigration Service because in that situation the alien simply would have no choice in the matter.
1983.82-91,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1031.931,1033.992,Was there any explanation offered here?
1983.82-91,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,1033.992,1035.882,"No, there was not."
1983.82-91,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1057.987,1076.948,"Mr. Schulder, my first hypothetical is if somebody goes to Thailand because her mother is ill and it develops that her mother has appendicitis which is over in a week, that would be okay I would assume."
1983.82-91,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,1076.948,1078.971,"I would assume so, Your Honor."
1983.82-91,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1078.971,1084.345,Suppose it develops it was cancer and it took three months.
1983.82-91,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,1086.155,1089.366,I think it would make a difference.
1983.82-91,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1111.743,1115.134,Would that apply to the one-week trip to Thailand?
1983.82-91,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,1115.134,1121.999,--In the case of an alien who had been here illegally I would say--
1983.82-91,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1121.999,1122.79,I did not get through with that.
1983.82-91,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,1124.44,1137.399,--In the case of an alien who has been here illegally and leaves while the alien is here illegally I would submit that that alien might very well be found not to have--
1983.82-91,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1137.399,1139.38,Go to Thailand at all--
1983.82-91,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,1139.38,1147.646,--I think the alien would not be able to meet the Fleuti test absolutely because any alien who is here illegally--
1983.82-91,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1147.646,1150.686,--You just destroyed the statute.
1983.82-91,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,1150.686,1152.559,--That is not true.
1983.82-91,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1153.508,1155.511,You say there is no way.
1983.82-91,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,1155.511,1164.657,"--No, well Wadman itself involved an alien who had been here lawfully prior to the trip, and the factors--"
1983.82-91,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1164.657,1174.442,But you say the statute does not apply if the alien is here having overstayed his time.
1983.82-91,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,1176.923,1179.637,"--No, I am not saying that."
1983.82-91,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1189.993,1192.775,You say three months it is.
1983.82-91,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,1195.927,1196.929,--That is correct.
1983.82-91,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1196.929,1200.712,You would not consider that an interruption would you?
1983.82-91,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,1200.712,1205.094,I would consider that a disruption in the context of this particular statute.
1983.82-91,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1212.937,1230.378,"Mr. Schulder, is it not true that unlike the situation that arose in Fleuti where the question is whether an entry was made which could involve a permanent resident who is lawfully here, is it not true that by hypothesis under this statute where the consideration whether to suspend deportation that there is an illegal presence in every case?"
1983.82-91,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,1230.378,1233.721,There is not necessarily an illegal presence before the trip.
1983.82-91,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1235.443,1239.865,But at least it is illegal as of the time of application to suspend deportation.
1983.82-91,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,1239.865,1240.256,That is correct.
1983.82-91,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1245.16,1246.4,Mr. Schulder--
1983.82-91,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,1287.097,1290.499,That may well be true if you apply the statute literally.
1983.82-91,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1290.499,1291.811,Perhaps in a court but--
1983.82-91,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,1291.811,1301.055,The point is though that the Immigration authorities have been applying this test with some success over the years for almost 20 years.
1983.82-91,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1301.055,1302.176,--And here we are.
1983.82-91,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,1302.176,1310.051,"Here we are, but the reason we are here is that the Ninth Circuit totally jettisoned that test."
1983.82-91,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1310.792,1325.581,"Mr. Schulder, it is very difficult, though, to understand why you should apply Fleuti to a different statute and to an alien who is illegally here, not someone who has permanent resident status."
1983.82-91,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,1334.957,1336.567,--I have no idea.
1983.82-91,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1336.567,1338.64,I know you were not there and probably were not even born then.
1983.82-91,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,1339.81,1342.233,"I am not that young, Your Honor."
1983.82-91,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1361.595,1369.25,"Mr. Schulder, is it not true that in last analysis the question is whether these decisions shall be made by Congress, by private bills or by the Attorney General?"
1983.82-91,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,1376.234,1377.346,That is correct.
1983.82-91,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1496.692,1497.954,Very well.
1983.82-91,1,17644,bert_d_greenberg,,1505.128,1508.12,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1983.82-91,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1555.041,1574.736,"Mr. Greenberg, if the statute simply allows discretion in the Attorney General assuming someone has been continuously present here for that interval of time to grant relief or not, how can you argue that it is moot?"
1983.82-91,1,17644,bert_d_greenberg,,1586.243,1589.277,"--Well, I believe it can be, Your Honor."
1983.82-91,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1629.944,1637.708,"Well, even if she met all the qualifications, is there not a residuum of discretion in the Attorney General whether to apply it or not?"
1983.82-91,1,17644,bert_d_greenberg,,1637.708,1639.398,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1983.82-91,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1657.609,1658.711,But you are arguing for a deferral.
1983.82-91,1,17644,bert_d_greenberg,,1661.693,1667.108,"--I am not sure I understand the technical mootness doctrine, Your Honor."
1983.82-91,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1668.618,1670.549,Let's just say it is not moot today is it?
1983.82-91,1,17644,bert_d_greenberg,,1670.549,1671.74,"Okay, Your Honor."
1983.82-91,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1671.74,1690.193,But your position would simply allow an alien who can postpone the inevitable for a while to come in at the end by virtue of seven years' residence even though three or four years might have been simply pursuant to fighting something that the alien ultimately loses.
1983.82-91,1,17644,bert_d_greenberg,,1690.193,1707.815,"Well, it is our position that the Respondent was eligible then at the time of the hearing, but since there was an adverse decision on that one issue and since seven years has passed we did not see why the Respondent should get a hearing on that matter prior to coming to this tribunal."
1983.82-91,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1707.815,1720.544,"Mr. Greenberg, we have been testing hypotheticals from three months down."
1983.82-91,1,17644,bert_d_greenberg,,1733.341,1737.264,"Listening to that, Mr. Chief Justice, it really goes to the heart of my argument."
1983.82-91,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1749.363,1751.706,Here we are dealing with three months so let's start there.
1983.82-91,1,17644,bert_d_greenberg,,1751.706,1752.705,--All right.
1983.82-91,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1804.479,1808.173,You say second-guessing by the Immigration judges.
1983.82-91,1,17644,bert_d_greenberg,,1811.292,1831.957,"Each other in effect, Your Honor, because one judge in one Immigration courtroom in one state may feel that a trip involving any travel documents out of the United States constitutes a break and another Immigration judge may not depending upon the purpose of that trip and the brevity of that trip."
1983.82-91,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1831.957,1843.105,Is that not a very good reason for going back to the statutory language which we are dealing with of physically present in the United States for a continuous period of not less than seven years?
1983.82-91,1,17644,bert_d_greenberg,,1843.105,1844.745,It would solve the problem.
1983.82-91,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1851.751,1855.722,"Well, the question is not how the government ""wants the problem solved""."
1983.82-91,1,17644,bert_d_greenberg,,1858.573,1863.227,"Well, Respondent here believes that this remedy--"
1983.82-91,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1863.227,1869.322,You cannot answer my last question whether it does not depend on the intent of Congress?
1983.82-91,1,17644,bert_d_greenberg,,1869.322,1871.082,"--Yes, it does, Your Honor."
1983.82-91,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1893.157,1899.73,What authority do you have for the proposition that this is in the nature of an equitable remedy as you put it?
1983.82-91,1,17644,bert_d_greenberg,,1899.73,1910.98,"--Discussions in the administrative reports and the legislative reports about when the bill was drafted and redrafted, Your Honor."
1983.82-91,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1910.98,1918.965,I thought that the legislative history indicated the desire for a fairly literal interpretation.
1983.82-91,1,17644,bert_d_greenberg,,1920.333,1921.876,"No, I do agree with you, Your Honor."
1983.82-91,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1932.091,1933.453,Why do you think that?
1983.82-91,1,17644,bert_d_greenberg,,1933.453,1950.433,"Because it allows for a person who has no other eligibility for permanent residence to show that by their ties to the United States, by their devotion to this country, by their commitments to this country that they can have the normal laws suspended on their behalf."
1983.82-91,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1950.433,1956.418,"That is an argument that one might well make to Congress, but where do you find that Congres has accepted that argument?"
1983.82-91,1,17644,bert_d_greenberg,,1956.418,1961.042,"I cannot speak to that, Your Honor."
1983.82-91,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1961.042,1966.234,I am not sure you responded to my question.
1983.82-91,1,17644,bert_d_greenberg,,1972.539,1985.388,"Depending upon other factors in the case, Mr. Chief Justice, if other family members were here, if there were a reason for going abroad, if there were certain ties to the United States--"
1983.82-91,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1985.388,1988.348,Whose burden is it to show and explain those things?
1983.82-91,1,17644,bert_d_greenberg,,1988.348,1989.53,"--The alien's, Your Honor."
1983.82-91,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1989.53,1999.988,"Did he show that he had an illness while he was abroad, for example, as one reasonable explanation for prolonging the absence?"
1983.82-91,1,17644,bert_d_greenberg,,1999.988,2000.788,"No, Your Honor."
1983.82-91,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2000.788,2003.338,Where do we draw this line?
1983.82-91,1,17644,bert_d_greenberg,,2003.338,2005.391,Where would the line be drawn?
1983.82-91,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2005.391,2006.38,Yes.
1983.82-91,1,17644,bert_d_greenberg,,2008.563,2036.48,"Our basic approach, Your Honor, is that we cannot draw the line that a test on this particular issue has to be a test of totality of circumstances and that there is no better way to draw the line than to say to the Immigration judge and to the Board of Immigration Appeals you must look at the factors in each case and make an independent decision but look at each factor of the statute independently."
1983.82-91,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2037.351,2052.341,The government has conceded if I understood the Solicitor General's Office correctly that if an explanation could be made that the man was ill and could not return that would be satisfactory.
1983.82-91,1,17644,bert_d_greenberg,,2055.914,2057.764,"--In our case, Your Honor, none."
1983.82-91,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2093.137,2098.092,Do I understand that if the absence were two years you would not be here?
1983.82-91,1,17644,bert_d_greenberg,,2098.092,2120.527,"--Once again, if we apply this type of test, a totality of circumstance test, which we feel is applied in other areas of law which is a logical extension of the Fleuti-Wadman doctrine that the Immigration judge can look at the factors involved and make a decision whether the absence was interruptive of the seven-year period."
1983.82-91,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2126.138,2127.13,Or two years.
1983.82-91,1,17644,bert_d_greenberg,,2127.13,2128.101,Or two years.
1983.82-91,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2128.851,2137.055,What do you get for the unexplained?
1983.82-91,1,17644,bert_d_greenberg,,2155.699,2156.76,"Yes, Your Honor."
1983.82-91,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2156.76,2163.944,We do not have that in this case because there was no explanation.
1983.82-91,1,17644,bert_d_greenberg,,2163.944,2165.226,That is correct.
1983.82-91,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2165.226,2167.456,What do you do with that?
1983.82-91,1,17644,bert_d_greenberg,,2167.456,2182.306,You go back to the actual trial judge who was the trier of fact on the spot and look at what he decided as to the cause of sufficiency of the absence.
1983.82-91,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2182.306,2184.219,"You mean he ""explained""?"
1983.82-91,1,17644,bert_d_greenberg,,2184.219,2187.058,"No, there was no explanation on the record."
1983.82-91,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2187.058,2189.95,Did he go outside the record in his explanation?
1983.82-91,1,17644,bert_d_greenberg,,2189.95,2191.022,"No, Your Honor."
1983.82-91,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2191.022,2202.75,I have problems on the nonexplanation and you have not helped me yet.
1983.82-91,1,17644,bert_d_greenberg,,2205.06,2206.542,"I have not helped you, no, Your Honor."
1983.82-91,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2206.542,2211.083,It was of record that she went to visit her mother?
1983.82-91,1,17644,bert_d_greenberg,,2211.083,2212.205,That is correct.
1983.82-91,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2217.769,2221.722,I understand but nevertheless the explanation was she went to visit her mother.
1983.82-91,1,17644,bert_d_greenberg,,2221.722,2222.901,That is correct.
1983.82-91,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2222.901,2228.557,"Well, I know it is outside the record but why did you not say that?"
1983.82-91,1,17644,bert_d_greenberg,,2228.557,2232.198,"I hoped it was the truth, Your Honor."
1983.82-91,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2405.441,2411.945,How do you square the Court of Appeals test in this case with the Fleuti factors?
1983.82-91,1,17644,bert_d_greenberg,,2411.945,2417.749,Fleuti mentioned several factors involved in an entry statute.
1983.82-91,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2435.912,2441.806,What would you say if the factors mentioned in Fleuti were exclusive?
1983.82-91,1,17644,bert_d_greenberg,,2461.239,2464.632,--With Fleuti alone without Wadman?
1983.82-91,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2464.632,2465.591,Yes.
1983.82-91,1,17644,bert_d_greenberg,,2465.591,2467.463,I think that you--
1983.82-91,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2467.463,2475.217,"No, not with... Wadman just applied the Fleuti factors in this context."
1983.82-91,1,17644,bert_d_greenberg,,2475.217,2476.267,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1983.82-91,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2476.267,2482.281,But the Ninth Circuit said the Fleuti factors and the Wadman factors were just evidentiary.
1983.82-91,1,17644,bert_d_greenberg,,2482.281,2483.182,Yes.
1983.82-91,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2483.182,2486.094,And came up with this test.
1983.82-91,1,17644,bert_d_greenberg,,2486.094,2487.126,Yes.
1983.82-91,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2487.126,2492.331,What if the Fleuti factors were the only factors you should look at?
1983.82-91,1,17644,bert_d_greenberg,,2492.331,2500.356,"You would still have some latitude on the part of the Immigration judges to say what is casual, what is innocent."
1983.82-91,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2500.356,2509.902,"My question is, would the Ninth Circuit's judgement in this case be wrong, wouldn't it, under the Fleuti factors?"
1983.82-91,1,17644,bert_d_greenberg,,2509.902,2527.384,"If I understand your honor correctly, if these was no latitude in the Ninth Circuit to interpolate other factors into that Fleuti decision, or even to say what the factors in the Fleuti decision really are, yes, I think they that would be bound by that."
1983.82-91,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2527.384,2539.743,"Well, Fleuti certainly didn't suggest that just because the hardship remained the same, that there could be relief."
1983.82-91,1,17644,bert_d_greenberg,,2540.972,2542.394,No.
1983.82-91,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2542.394,2545.436,"Fleuti said, that's not what Wadman said either, is it?"
1983.82-91,1,17644,bert_d_greenberg,,2545.436,2559.655,"It was a taking off point for how to interpret in Wadman, how to interpret a statute that does not seem to, on a literal reading of it, permit anything to be read into it that is not there on the printed page."
1983.82-91,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2559.655,2575.055,"Mr. Greenberg, while I have you interrupted, I think I asked your opponent, is whether Congress or the Attorney General shall decide questions like this."
1983.82-91,1,17644,bert_d_greenberg,,2578.906,2597.599,"Well, the private bill remedy, Your Honor, is practically an academic issue today because Rule 6 in the House and very few private bills are... The old benefit of the private bill where they would be introduced and they would sit during two sessions of Congress does not happen realistically any more."
1983.82-91,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2602.431,2607.777,This is the same statute that was involved in the Chadha case is it not?
1983.82-91,1,17644,bert_d_greenberg,,2607.777,2609.537,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1983.82-91,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2609.537,2612.449,That case does not really shed any light on our problem does it?
1983.82-91,1,17644,bert_d_greenberg,,2612.449,2615.241,There is one analogous issue in that case.
1983.82-91,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2648.293,2649.932,Let me go back.
1983.82-91,1,17644,bert_d_greenberg,,2671.377,2672.188,"No, Your Honor."
1983.82-91,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2714.995,2715.736,I see.
1983.82-91,1,17644,bert_d_greenberg,,2715.736,2721.881,I do not think many practicing immigration lawyers rely on private bills to assist them with their clients.
1983.82-91,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2721.881,2729.675,The thought that was running through my mind is that maybe a strict construction would be very appropriate if there is a congressional remedy as there had been in the past.
1983.82-91,1,17644,bert_d_greenberg,,2739.101,2740.203,I understand.
1983.82-91,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2740.203,2749.389,May I ask whether there was a quota on immigration from Thailand at the time of the case?
1983.82-91,1,17644,bert_d_greenberg,,2749.389,2752.181,"Yes, there was, Your Honor."
1983.82-91,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2752.181,2758.084,Where there Thai citizens awaiting their turn to come into the United States under that quota?
1983.82-91,1,17644,bert_d_greenberg,,2758.084,2761.926,"With these particular people, the Respondent here, no."
1983.82-91,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2761.926,2763.949,"From Thailand, not these people."
1983.82-91,1,17644,bert_d_greenberg,,2763.949,2764.58,"Yes, Your Honor."
1983.82-91,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2764.58,2770.183,But there were Thai people awaiting their turn to come into the United States lawfully.
1983.82-91,1,17644,bert_d_greenberg,,2770.183,2770.902,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1983.82-91,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2770.902,2787.054,Was it not the intention of Congress to protect the interest of people who were operating in accordance with the laws of the United States primarily rather than people who were deportable who had disobeyed our laws?
1983.82-91,1,17644,bert_d_greenberg,,2787.054,2788.594,"I believe so, Your Honor."
1983.82-91,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2883.295,2886.097,"Very well, Mr. Greenberg."
1983.82-91,2,23151,elliott_schulder,,2887.679,2888.711,"No, Your Honor."
1983.82-91,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2888.711,2890.163,"Thank you, gentlemen."
