1971.70-283,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,3.809,"-- in number 70-283, Adams against Williams."
1971.70-283,0,20582,donald_a_browne,,5.153,7.29,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1971.70-283,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,478.851,485.641,Did the officer testify that the man's coat was open?
1971.70-283,0,20582,donald_a_browne,,485.641,488.736,"Yes, that appears in several places within the appendix, within his testimony."
1971.70-283,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,497.409,500.503,"Mr. Browne, he was convicted on three counts here, wasn't he?"
1971.70-283,0,20582,donald_a_browne,,500.503,502.194,"Yes, he was Justice --"
1971.70-283,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,502.194,506.989,I can't make out from the record whether those are concurrent sentences or consecutive ones?
1971.70-283,0,20582,donald_a_browne,,506.989,513.207,He received a sentence on the possession of the heroin of not less than three and not more than six years in state's prison.
1971.70-283,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,560.696,569.21,"You in this case, question Mr. Browne the availability of federal habeas corpus to attack the --"
1971.70-283,0,20582,donald_a_browne,,569.21,569.539,No I do not --
1971.70-283,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,569.539,571.975,-- permissibility of the evidences in a state trial?
1971.70-283,0,20582,donald_a_browne,,571.975,573.871,"No, we have never contested that."
1971.70-283,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,599.466,602.069,In the federal system by the District Court and twice by the --
1971.70-283,0,20582,donald_a_browne,,602.069,605.813,Twice by the Second Court of Appeals for Second Circuit and today it makes the fourth time.
1971.70-283,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,605.813,606.341,Mr. Browne --
1971.70-283,0,20582,donald_a_browne,,606.341,607.138,Yes sir.
1971.70-283,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,607.138,615.15,"You said earlier, you said the crux was whether there was sufficient cause for reaching into the car."
1971.70-283,0,20582,donald_a_browne,,632.582,634.704,"That's correct, into the car and into his waistband."
1971.70-283,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,635.554,637.623,"Well, it says for reaching into Williams' waistband?"
1971.70-283,0,20582,donald_a_browne,,637.623,639.248,"Into the waistband, that's correct."
1971.70-283,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,641.551,644.355,Wasn't the window uped and the officer ask to --?
1971.70-283,0,20582,donald_a_browne,,644.355,646.094,Williams rolled the window down.
1971.70-283,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,646.311,647.335,He was asked to --
1971.70-283,0,20582,donald_a_browne,,647.335,658.7,"He was asked to open the door, and he in response rolled the window down and the officer then placed his car -- his hand into the automobile and right on to the handle of the revolver."
1971.70-283,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,658.7,663.993,"Well, does this imply that there was a sufficient cause for reaching into the car, but not at --"
1971.70-283,0,20582,donald_a_browne,,663.993,673.254,"I assume that the -- no, I assume that the implication of the per curiam sentence is that there was no sufficient cause to reach into the automobile or into the waistband."
1971.70-283,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,679.435,686.857,Do you think it goes beyond that and suggest that there was no probable cause to go over and tap on the window?
1971.70-283,0,20582,donald_a_browne,,686.857,691.873,"Well, unfortunately that's the reason I have tried to framed the issues in the way that I have."
1971.70-283,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,748.833,754.551,"Well, Judge Friendly I gather and dissenter, if I read that correctly, it seemed that is in the panel dissent?"
1971.70-283,0,20582,donald_a_browne,,754.551,755.621,That's correct.
1971.70-283,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,755.621,770.349,"Seem to indicate that it turned on whether or not he should have approached the car, he didn't have probable cause for arrest, but was he justified in approaching the car on the basis of the information from the unnamed informer?"
1971.70-283,0,20582,donald_a_browne,,770.349,774.476,I don't think that -- my recollection of the opinion of justice -- his dissenting opinion.
1971.70-283,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,782.844,784.377,I am just looking at the sentence.
1971.70-283,0,20582,donald_a_browne,,796.252,802.501,My recollection of the dissent of Judge Friendly was he held that there was not a sufficient basis for a stop.
1971.70-283,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,820.909,826.35,So it simply has to be on these facts whether he was justified in the approaching the car at all?
1971.70-283,0,20582,donald_a_browne,,826.35,828.971,Whether he is justified first in approaching the car?
1971.70-283,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,830.652,838.841,"Surely, if he was justified in approaching the car, then I expect no one can call that he then reached for the gun in open view?"
1971.70-283,0,20582,donald_a_browne,,838.841,840.582,"Well, that would be my position."
1971.70-283,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,840.582,844.753,"Well, then it does have to narrow down to whether he was justified in approaching the car car at all?"
1971.70-283,0,20582,donald_a_browne,,844.753,851.514,And again I have taken that into and tried to frame it in two particular issues as I indicated under the law as set forth in the Terry.
1971.70-283,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,865.978,878.984,"Is it clear in your view that he received the information, or I will put it this way, where do you say this record shows the police officer received the tip?"
1971.70-283,0,20582,donald_a_browne,,878.984,887.316,"Well, the appendix -- I think the testimony of the officer is clear that he received the tip in the gasoline station."
1971.70-283,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,926.265,927.26,Mr. Browne.
1971.70-283,0,20582,donald_a_browne,,927.26,927.51,"Yes, sir."
1971.70-283,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,927.51,953.268,"Following up on Justice Steward's question of a moment ago, if this crime took place in 1966 and the ultimate decision of this Court should be to hold that the evidence was improperly seized in 1972, I take it you would agree that if the purpose of the rule against to discipline the police, it would have somewhat attenuated effect, if it's handed down six years after the event?"
1971.70-283,0,20582,donald_a_browne,,953.268,954.276,No question about it.
1971.70-283,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1026.452,1042.81,"Well, didn't Terry proceed on the assumption that in any circumstances such as in Terry, officers wouldn't be deterred at all, because they felt that the situation demanded some action and there was no use in trying to deter?"
1971.70-283,0,20582,donald_a_browne,,1042.81,1061.953,"Well, I can't read necessarily that Your Honor's conclusion into that particular decision, but I think that -- I think Terry clearly points out in a number of locations that one, that there is no prohibition against the officer for example from walking -- from stopping a person on the street and asking him a questions, that is I don't think that a big deal."
1971.70-283,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1061.953,1076.789,"Well, let's suppose it Mr. Browne that instead of sitting in the car, Williams had been standing at curb and Sergeant Connolly acted on precisely the same information on which he did act here?"
1971.70-283,0,20582,donald_a_browne,,1076.789,1080.784,Yes.
1971.70-283,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1080.784,1082.964,Would that be covered by Terry?
1971.70-283,0,20582,donald_a_browne,,1082.964,1092.761,It would be covered a number of the general phrases contained within the Terry decision as to whether or not the officer is acting as a reasonably prudent person under all of the circumstance.
1971.70-283,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1140.618,1155.054,"Well, do you think this case should be decided as it would be decided if the hypothetical I put you was the case, that is of standing there and the officer acting on --"
1971.70-283,0,20582,donald_a_browne,,1155.054,1156.663,"I cannot, I cannot --"
1971.70-283,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1156.663,1158.513,"(Voice Overlap) simply if he is in the automobile, it doesn't like that --"
1971.70-283,0,20582,donald_a_browne,,1158.513,1178.185,"No, I cannot submit to Your Honor any grave justification or a distinction between the fact that he was standing on the street corner or the fact that he was sitting in the automobile other than the fact that being in the automobile it might have been considerably more difficult for Connolly to observe furtive movement such as a moment to go for as his gun."
1971.70-283,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1178.185,1192.825,"The Judge Friendly, I suppose would have conceded, however, that if the informer had just simply said, I saw the gun in his waistband, that the officer could have done what he did?"
1971.70-283,0,20582,donald_a_browne,,1192.825,1194.131,I would assume on a basis of Judge Friendly --
1971.70-283,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1194.131,1197.294,Reliable informant and there is a basis given for the informant's --
1971.70-283,0,20582,donald_a_browne,,1197.294,1204.34,"I can only submit that if the informant had said I saw the gun there, then quite possibly the officer Connolly may have basis to go over and make an arrest --"
1971.70-283,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1204.34,1206.112,"Well, why wouldn't he?"
1971.70-283,0,20582,donald_a_browne,,1206.112,1209.152,"I think, I submit that he would have, I submit that he would have."
1971.70-283,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1223.753,1231.073,And I suppose Officer Connolly had been at the police station blocks away when the informant told him just what he told him on the gas station.
1971.70-283,0,20582,donald_a_browne,,1238.088,1244.504,"Well, I submit that -- are you including the fact that he indicated that he saw the gun or are you excluding that?"
1971.70-283,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1244.504,1246.394,I am checking precisely these facts --
1971.70-283,0,20582,donald_a_browne,,1246.394,1247.082,Precisely the --
1971.70-283,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1247.082,1254.011,Except that he got the information at the police station several blocks away from informant rather than the gas station across the street?
1971.70-283,0,20582,donald_a_browne,,1254.011,1264.29,"Well that of course, it relates again to the propriety of an investigation, obviously he wouldn't have had probable course for an arrest in those -- we really even know that he knew Mr. Williams' name --"
1971.70-283,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1264.29,1270.761,"Wouldn't that be stronger because he actually went there and found what the informant said he found, I mean, at least there was a man there?"
1971.70-283,0,20582,donald_a_browne,,1270.761,1272.054,"That's right, that's correct."
1971.70-283,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1324.409,1327.38,The search at all wasn't a protective search?
1971.70-283,0,20582,donald_a_browne,,1327.38,1337.63,"No, the search of the automobile itself hinges upon obviously whether or not the disclosure of the pistol supplied sufficient probable cause for him to place him under arrest."
1971.70-283,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1337.63,1340.068,"I thought you said, he did place him under arrest?"
1971.70-283,0,20582,donald_a_browne,,1340.068,1345.149,"After he found the pistol, he proceeded to place him under arrest for possession of that pistol."
1971.70-283,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1359.737,1360.926,Where was the machete?
1971.70-283,0,20582,donald_a_browne,,1360.926,1366.993,The machete was under the passenger seat of the front -- the passenger side of the automobile and that's where Williams was sitting.
1971.70-283,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1366.993,1368.777,Was it in open view or --
1971.70-283,0,20582,donald_a_browne,,1368.777,1369.754,"No, it was under the seat --"
1971.70-283,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1369.754,1370.375,Underneath --
1971.70-283,0,20582,donald_a_browne,,1370.375,1379.679,Under the seat because only Williams knew it was there and nobody else knew it was there and so I think that it was -- it's not illogical to say that he still could have made an attempt to pull the machete out --
1971.70-283,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1379.679,1382.425,Where was he when the cop searched the car?
1971.70-283,0,20582,donald_a_browne,,1382.425,1385.382,"On Hamilton Street, right next to the automobile, on Hamilton Street."
1971.70-283,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1385.382,1388.508,And how was he go and get the machete standing out on the street?
1971.70-283,0,20582,donald_a_browne,,1388.508,1393.511,"Well, it of course, he is standing right next to the automobile, he is the only one that knows that machete is there."
1971.70-283,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1401.209,1403.855,"At that stage, the policeman has got two guns."
1971.70-283,0,20582,donald_a_browne,,1403.855,1404.637,What's that?
1971.70-283,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1404.637,1407.105,This policeman now has two guns in his hands?
1971.70-283,0,20582,donald_a_browne,,1407.105,1411.232,That's correct and still the guy might get the machete.
1971.70-283,0,20582,donald_a_browne,,1411.232,1413.186,I still say he could make an attempt to obtain it.
1971.70-283,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1414.829,1415.981,"Well, then he was --"
1971.70-283,0,20582,donald_a_browne,,1415.981,1419.228,"It might be a foolish attempt, but he is standing next to the automobile, he is not --"
1971.70-283,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1419.228,1422.494,"You know I seriously say that, that was a search to protect the life?"
1971.70-283,0,20582,donald_a_browne,,1422.494,1422.679,Oh!
1971.70-283,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1428.25,1430.516,What was the basis of the search of the the car?
1971.70-283,0,20582,donald_a_browne,,1430.516,1434.553,"That was a contemporaneous search, contemporaneous to his arrest there on Hamilton Street."
1971.70-283,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1447.586,1452.7,There is nothing in the record about this informant except that he knew him?
1971.70-283,0,20582,donald_a_browne,,1452.7,1469.322,"There is a considerable description of testimony in which he describes information that the informant had given him before which did not lead to an arrest, but rather related to particular criminal activities taking place at a particular location in which the officer proceeded to investigate."
1971.70-283,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1528.894,1530.07,Mr. Hennessey.
1971.70-283,1,22478,edward_f_hennessey,,1530.07,1530.57,Yes sir.
1971.70-283,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1717.104,1718.028,May I just ask a question?
1971.70-283,1,22478,edward_f_hennessey,,1718.028,1718.247,Yes sir.
1971.70-283,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1718.247,1720.821,What crime connected with the gun was he convicted?
1971.70-283,1,22478,edward_f_hennessey,,1720.821,1728.828,He was convicted of a crime under 29-35 which is carrying a gun without a permit and then he was -- the machete --
1971.70-283,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1728.828,1732.538,And what if he didn't fall within one of the exceptions where he didn't need a permit?
1971.70-283,1,22478,edward_f_hennessey,,1732.538,1745.246,"As it was ultimately proved in a trial, he was not for example, carrying the gun as part of transporting his household goods or carrying his gun for merchandising purposes or carrying a gun from a dealer to his home."
1971.70-283,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1745.246,1751.495,"Was it likely that he would have fallen under those circumstances being found as he was in this area, 2 o'clock in the morning?"
1971.70-283,1,22478,edward_f_hennessey,,1751.495,1758.933,"Well, and I would submit it would be -- be likely that a man could be out at 2 o'clock in the morning with a gun at his waist and have a permit for it."
1971.70-283,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1762.78,1767.667,(Voice Overlap) the burden of proof on the person to show that he has a permit after the gun is found?
1971.70-283,1,22478,edward_f_hennessey,,1767.667,1769.665,Not under the statute of Connecticut no.
1971.70-283,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1779.275,1787.095,What does an officer do in that situation if he discovers a man with a gun and doesn't believe he is within the ten exceptions?
1971.70-283,1,22478,edward_f_hennessey,,1791.685,1794.481,"I would say, usually ask the man."
1971.70-283,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1820.618,1825.024,There was no indication that Mr. Williams made any representation that he did have a permit?
1971.70-283,1,22478,edward_f_hennessey,,1825.024,1834.852,"No, Mr. Williams, according to the record was, one he was never asked the gun was taken and the policeman said, get out of the car you are under arrest."
1971.70-283,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1848.981,1849.843,"Well, I don't get this --"
1971.70-283,1,22478,edward_f_hennessey,,1849.843,1855.359,Excuse me?
1971.70-283,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1855.359,1858.827,"He was arrested and the basis of the arrest was the gun, wasn't it?"
1971.70-283,1,22478,edward_f_hennessey,,1858.827,1860.329,That's right.
1971.70-283,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1863.553,1869.55,"And you suggest that the mere fact that he has a gun does not justify under Connecticut law an arrest, is that it?"
1971.70-283,1,22478,edward_f_hennessey,,1869.55,1871.142,That's right.
1971.70-283,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1880.878,1889.819,And you say that Sergeant Connolly had to know or have probable cause to believe for making an arrest for possession of the gun that he did not have a permit for it?
1971.70-283,1,22478,edward_f_hennessey,,1889.819,1891.493,That's right.
1971.70-283,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1903.444,1913.483,"When you find a man with a gun on the street in Hartford, Connecticut and you take the gun out of his belt, what do you do?"
1971.70-283,1,22478,edward_f_hennessey,,1915.733,1918.233,"In Hartford, they arrest him."
1971.70-283,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1922.912,1924.285,Well what's wrong with that?
1971.70-283,1,22478,edward_f_hennessey,,1924.285,1925.282,"Well, because --"
1971.70-283,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1925.282,1927.463,"Well, what would you suggest they do?"
1971.70-283,1,22478,edward_f_hennessey,,1927.463,1932.187,"Well, the first question is do they have a right to lay a hand on him in the first place before we get to the --"
1971.70-283,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1932.187,1947.131,"Well, you see a man walking on the street with coat hanging wide open and a 45 stuck down in there and the policeman walks up and says, do you have a permit, the guy says nothing, what can the police do?"
1971.70-283,1,22478,edward_f_hennessey,,1947.131,1961.142,"I would say that the policeman, that would then come in to the issue of whether or not the policeman has a right to make an investigative detention which is often discussed as to whether or not at that point they have a right to hold a man for purposes of checking."
1971.70-283,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1961.142,1961.506,Mr. Hennessey --
1971.70-283,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1961.506,1963.822,What do you think a policeman should do at that point?
1971.70-283,1,22478,edward_f_hennessey,,1963.822,1965.016,Alright.
1971.70-283,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1966.967,1968.604,What do you think they should do?
1971.70-283,1,22478,edward_f_hennessey,,1968.604,1972.373,"I think they should hold him and check, I think so."
1971.70-283,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1972.373,1974.544,"Well, what did they do in this case?"
1971.70-283,1,22478,edward_f_hennessey,,1974.544,1979.685,"This was not -- at this point, they had already seized the gun."
1971.70-283,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1982.931,1988.786,"A man has a loaded revolver, and the policeman is supposed to hold him, but he can't take the gun away from him?"
1971.70-283,1,22478,edward_f_hennessey,,1988.786,1990.852,"Yes, he can take the gun away from him, I would submit."
1971.70-283,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1990.852,1991.775,I thought you meant that.
1971.70-283,1,22478,edward_f_hennessey,,1991.775,1992.68,Yes.
1971.70-283,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1992.68,1995.445,"And he could detain him, you admit that?"
1971.70-283,1,22478,edward_f_hennessey,,1995.445,2003.089,"No, I don't get to the point of arguing whether or not that that is constitutionally permissible, no."
1971.70-283,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2006.357,2008.701,I asked what would you suggest they do?
1971.70-283,1,22478,edward_f_hennessey,,2008.701,2010.405,Alright.
1971.70-283,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2010.405,2011.498,Now let's try it again.
1971.70-283,1,22478,edward_f_hennessey,,2011.498,2012.242,Alright.
1971.70-283,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2012.242,2021.726,Under the Constitution what would you suggest is the most that the policeman could do looking at a loaded 45 in a man's trousers?
1971.70-283,1,22478,edward_f_hennessey,,2021.726,2033.531,"I would say in Connecticut if the officer observed a man walking down the street, he may have the right to stop him to inquire as to what he is doing."
1971.70-283,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2033.531,2035.372,And if the man doesn't say anything --
1971.70-283,1,22478,edward_f_hennessey,,2035.372,2038.809,Yes and the man doesn't say anything.
1971.70-283,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2044.795,2056.42,Because your point as I understand it Mr. Hennessey is that under Connecticut law the possession of a gun is no more a badge of criminality and the fact the man might have a hat on him?
1971.70-283,1,22478,edward_f_hennessey,,2056.42,2057.395,That is true.
1971.70-283,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2057.395,2063.614,"Or gold clubs or anything of that might be perfectly, it's as innocent as a golf club?"
1971.70-283,1,22478,edward_f_hennessey,,2063.614,2069.141,"Well, it isn't to me, but it is under our law."
1971.70-283,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2069.141,2070.683,Let me ask you this hypothetical question.
1971.70-283,1,22478,edward_f_hennessey,,2070.683,2070.902,Alright.
1971.70-283,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2070.902,2085.496,"Suppose in exactly the circumstances of the information that came to the officer in this case except that the automobile is removed one block away so it's out of the sight, the tip is exactly the same."
1971.70-283,1,22478,edward_f_hennessey,,2101.377,2101.576,Oh!
1971.70-283,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2102.234,2104.884,Well what?
1971.70-283,1,22478,edward_f_hennessey,,2104.884,2107.601,If he saw a man crouched pointing a gun at him --
1971.70-283,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2107.601,2112.443,"No, no just pointing a gun at somewhere not at the policeman?"
1971.70-283,1,22478,edward_f_hennessey,,2112.443,2118.758,"Yes, I think at that point he would have some indication of additional element of criminal activity just by the point that the man --"
1971.70-283,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2118.758,2120.617,"Alright, let's take it back there."
1971.70-283,1,22478,edward_f_hennessey,,2132.292,2132.698,Alright.
1971.70-283,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2132.698,2144.371,"On your theory of the immunity of gun carriers in Connecticut, could he do anymore to that man than he could to the man sitting in the car?"
1971.70-283,1,22478,edward_f_hennessey,,2144.371,2152.899,He may because he doesn't have to believe the man and he does have some indications in the first instance that the man --
1971.70-283,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2152.899,2157.224,"(Voice Overlap) He hands off to the officer, in the same set of facts that Chief Justice gave --"
1971.70-283,1,22478,edward_f_hennessey,,2157.224,2167.132,"Well, then the question would go down, you might again get into the right privilege dichotomy which you supplied to automobile operation, the question being --"
1971.70-283,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2167.132,2169.809,"No, the hypothetical that Chief Justice gave you."
1971.70-283,1,22478,edward_f_hennessey,,2169.809,2170.122,Alright.
1971.70-283,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2170.122,2180.826,"He sees that he is pointing the gun and he is crouched over pointing it, and the officer turns up, what are you doing, he gives the same story that Chief suggested but then he adds to it, here is my permit?"
1971.70-283,1,22478,edward_f_hennessey,,2180.826,2185.038,"Alright, well he still is confronted with the situation of potential assault."
1971.70-283,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2190.679,2206.553,"Well, but my hypothetical included an assumption that he answered, I will add Justice Brennan's, here is my pistol license and I am exercising my right of self-defense, there is a man over here out of sight who is going to attack me?"
1971.70-283,1,22478,edward_f_hennessey,,2206.553,2214.559,"Well, I think the police officer is justified and I don't think that the police officer has to rely on the citizen's characterization at the legality of his conduct."
1971.70-283,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2214.559,2223.086,"If as you say Connecticut lets him carry a gun for self-defense, why should the officer disbelieve him, it might be true?"
1971.70-283,1,22478,edward_f_hennessey,,2223.086,2226.242,"Because, excuse me -- why should the officer disbelieve him?"
1971.70-283,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2226.242,2226.534,Yeah.
1971.70-283,1,22478,edward_f_hennessey,,2226.534,2234.57,It's not -- I don't think the officer's ultimate determination at that juncture is to decide facts or belief or not.
1971.70-283,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2252.256,2264.771,"Well, if Connecticut lets people carry gun so freely, for their own defense what's so bad about doing what I suggest in the hypothetical question?"
1971.70-283,1,22478,edward_f_hennessey,,2267.724,2304.13,"Well, that -- I seem to be going across purposes, but the point is not whether or not it's good or bad, the point is whether or not the policeman was justified in interfering with the citizens liberty or take some action vis-a-vis that citizen at a point where, where the citizen has told him, he is holding a gun within an intent to use it, notwithstanding that he tells to me that he intends to use it for defensive reasons and I think that the point is that the policeman is justified in acting, notwithstanding whether or not the person might have the right to use it for that reason."
1971.70-283,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2309.501,2314.612,Your claim that the officer wasn't (Inaudible)
1971.70-283,1,22478,edward_f_hennessey,,2314.612,2316.393,Yes.
1971.70-283,1,22478,edward_f_hennessey,,2353.149,2355.459,"No, it depends on --"
1971.70-283,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2355.459,2358.531,I said assuming the reasonable suspicion under (Inaudible)
1971.70-283,1,22478,edward_f_hennessey,,2358.531,2361.463,"Well, that depends on how one reads Terry."
1971.70-283,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2364.126,2367.702,(Inaudible) suspicion that he does have a gun.
1971.70-283,1,22478,edward_f_hennessey,,2367.702,2412.105,"Well, if Terry -- I think that, as I read Terry trying to square it with the Fourth Amendment limitations on any invasion, I read Terry as saying that where situations arose which justified a police officer in making an initial stop or interfering with a citizen's liberty for the purpose of inquiry that there may also be contemporaneous right to make a body search or a body frisk, a pat down for defensive purposes, but I do not think that it follows that every time a police officer has a right to make a stop that he has a concomitant right to make a frisk."
1971.70-283,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2412.105,2423.46,"Well, I am just saying that here the suspicion that he had included that of a gun, he had some reasonable suspicions, thinking he might be in a dangerous situation?"
1971.70-283,1,22478,edward_f_hennessey,,2423.46,2425.243,"Well, that takes you on further."
1971.70-283,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2425.243,2428.377,"Well, further assume the reasonableness of the suspicion?"
1971.70-283,1,22478,edward_f_hennessey,,2428.377,2428.91,Alright.
1971.70-283,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2475.302,2478.437,But suppose there were no gun involved in this at all?
1971.70-283,1,22478,edward_f_hennessey,,2478.437,2478.868,Excuse me?
1971.70-283,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2478.868,2496.494,"Suppose where no gun involved in this at all, but the machete and the informant had simply said that the officer look at this fellow is a heroin addict and he has got a machete on this person, and you need to of careful, he is likely use it?"
1971.70-283,1,22478,edward_f_hennessey,,2496.494,2499.737,It is no different because you have a right to carry a machete in Connecticut.
1971.70-283,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2503.346,2509.439,"Well, not a machete, but he has got an iron -- a fire iron on him."
1971.70-283,1,22478,edward_f_hennessey,,2512.891,2527.21,"Well, that would may make it fairly -- that is not even a registrable that a golf club has in fact been held in Connecticut not to be a deadly weapon and not subject to registration, if there was a case on that."
1971.70-283,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2578.678,2597.106,"Suppose the informant at the filling station had said to the officer, there is a car over there and I think there is a hold up at that bank going on, but watch out because he has got a gun in his belt and when the officer approached the car, the engine was running."
1971.70-283,1,22478,edward_f_hennessey,,2597.106,2597.619,Yes sir.
1971.70-283,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2597.619,2603.447,What is your position about his -- scope of the officer's duties and powers then?
1971.70-283,1,22478,edward_f_hennessey,,2603.447,2608.88,"Well, I think the scope, it is really not, my opinion the scope of officers' duties or powers."
1971.70-283,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2651.511,2653.904,Investigate further is by doing what?
1971.70-283,1,22478,edward_f_hennessey,,2653.904,2655.375,"Well, first of all he would have --"
1971.70-283,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2655.375,2657.456,Tap on -- could he tap on the window?
1971.70-283,1,22478,edward_f_hennessey,,2657.456,2664.347,"Well, I would assume if the officer would probably be more interested in what was going on inside the bank, not what was going on inside the car."
1971.70-283,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2664.347,2674.159,"Well, should he wait till to see if the bank robbery is really completed and then try to have a shootout as they come out of the bank to the getaway car?"
1971.70-283,1,22478,edward_f_hennessey,,2674.159,2676.018,"Well, that I suppose different."
1971.70-283,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2701.424,2729.527,"Well, let us accept that, that every officer would not act the same way but has not this Court, and other courts as well said many occasions that the conduct of the police officer must be judged ultimately as it was seen through the eyes of an experienced, prudent police officer at the time and place and in all the circumstances?"
1971.70-283,1,22478,edward_f_hennessey,,2729.527,2731.856,"No, I do not believe this Court has ever said that totally."
1971.70-283,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2767.076,2773.764,You don't think that the motor of the car running adds any dimension that will alter this case?
1971.70-283,1,22478,edward_f_hennessey,,2773.764,2776.36,"I think it adds, yes I think it would a fact."
1971.70-283,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2887.933,2893.488,"Certainly, there is language in Terry that goes beyond your rather narrow reading of this, isn't there?"
1971.70-283,1,22478,edward_f_hennessey,,2893.488,2897.972,Yes I'd say depending on whose opinion one draws upon.
1971.70-283,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2904.438,2916.507,But Terry isn't -- wasn't -- the officer in Terry was a man of some 40 odd years of police experience in that type of work in that area?
1971.70-283,1,22478,edward_f_hennessey,,2916.507,2918.245,That is right.
1971.70-283,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2918.245,2922.134,"But I do not think Terry is limited to that at all, do you?"
1971.70-283,1,22478,edward_f_hennessey,,2922.134,2943.586,"Well, looking at the facts in Terry and those that seem to be most persuasive were that when the officer McFadden in the Terry case went towards the three suspects, he at that point believed that he was looking at a daylight stick up, that was part of --"
1971.70-283,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2943.586,2945.815,"Well, that wasn't his business."
1971.70-283,1,22478,edward_f_hennessey,,2951.502,2954.377,That was officer McFadden's business?
1971.70-283,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2959.306,2961.737,I would not try to get particular.
1971.70-283,1,22478,edward_f_hennessey,,3014.406,3036.984,"That is -- yes, that isn't in the context of Terry that seems to be one of the suggestions of Terry, and the implication as I read Terry was that it was -- that's why I said that it seemed in Terry that this Court was speaking in terms of the street confrontation situation."
1971.70-283,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3036.984,3057.346,"Well, why did you say that this was a reliable informer, that he would have given this man or some other policemen six different pieces of good information which rely in six criminal convictions that that would give him the same rights that the detective in Terry did."
1971.70-283,1,22478,edward_f_hennessey,,3058.661,3059.964,I got far.
1971.70-283,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3079.073,3080.324,It means there is probable cause?
1971.70-283,1,22478,edward_f_hennessey,,3080.324,3101.027,Yes he has probable cause and this then gives him the right to go forward and actually confront him and then it would have been irrelevant and that's why to a certain extent even the application of Terry by the Connecticut Supreme Court was irrelevant because the Connecticut Supreme Court decided that there was a reliable informant here.
1971.70-283,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3124.29,3139.258,Do you think we can redetermine the credibility issue in the case here or are we bound by the fact determination made in Connecticut and endorsed by the highest court of Connecticut?
1971.70-283,1,22478,edward_f_hennessey,,3139.258,3150.086,"Well, I think this Court can make that inquiry to determine whether or not the case presents one that requires a certain decision."
1971.70-283,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3211.626,3221.063,What was the decision about the informant insofar as telling the truth is concerned?
1971.70-283,1,22478,edward_f_hennessey,,3221.063,3237.897,"No, I said it's not of telling the truth, I said so far as the test of reliability, the informant in this case according to Officer Connolly had once six months before told Officer Connolly there was a homosexual activity going on in the Bridgeport Railroad Station and --"
1971.70-283,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3237.897,3253.022,"I thought that Judge Friendly indicated that if the informant had said in addition to who he was, and what is his experience with the police had been, if he had said in addition, I saw the gun, that this is -- there would have been probable cause."
1971.70-283,1,22478,edward_f_hennessey,,3253.022,3256.616,"No, I don't read that at all, as being what Judge Friendly said."
1971.70-283,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3285.831,3293.924,Assuming for the moment that the informer was reliable in the sense of the first leg of the informant reliability --
1971.70-283,1,22478,edward_f_hennessey,,3293.924,3294.47,Right.
1971.70-283,1,22478,edward_f_hennessey,,3295.408,3295.768,Yes sir.
1971.70-283,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3295.768,3299.267,So that the officer was justified in believing the informant was telling the truth.
1971.70-283,1,22478,edward_f_hennessey,,3299.267,3300.305,Alright.
1971.70-283,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3300.305,3309.086,"Your position still is that that doesn't give him reasonable cause, or reasonable suspicion under Terry to make a stop?"
1971.70-283,1,22478,edward_f_hennessey,,3309.086,3311.124,"Yes, that's right."
1971.70-283,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3311.124,3324.327,"Well, don't you go beyond that, that even if it did, even if it did, that that would not justify, the fact that he can make a stop would not justify the seizures of the machete and narcotics and arrest?"
1971.70-283,1,22478,edward_f_hennessey,,3324.327,3326.022,"Ultimately yes, yes."
1971.70-283,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3329.407,3330.141,You may answer.
1971.70-283,1,22478,edward_f_hennessey,,3330.141,3330.65,Oh!
1971.70-283,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3369.08,3377.222,[Voice Overlap] has decided though that under its law when an officer finds a gun in somebody's waistband they can be arrested and convicted for it.?
1971.70-283,1,22478,edward_f_hennessey,,3377.222,3380.392,"Well, yes, but they --"
1971.70-283,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3380.392,3382.907,That's a result of the state court proceedings of this case?
1971.70-283,1,22478,edward_f_hennessey,,3382.907,3399.78,"Yes, but the Terry application was merely dictum to that because the Court found in 19 that there was a reliable informant and that it therefore went upon the rights of arrest based on reliable informant."
1971.70-283,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3399.78,3408.53,"That doesn't get you very far because your point is either the informant was reliable, when he finds a gun you can't arrest because it doesn't give you probable cause to arrest."
1971.70-283,1,22478,edward_f_hennessey,,3413.034,3420.888,"Well, no because then the tip, if it came from a reliable informant was a tip of two crimes, one being gun and the other being drugs."
1971.70-283,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3426.293,3429.992,I know but they -- they jet him convicted of carrying the gun?
1971.70-283,1,22478,edward_f_hennessey,,3429.992,3430.289,Of course.
1971.70-283,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3430.289,3432.055,And they let him seize the gun?
1971.70-283,1,22478,edward_f_hennessey,,3432.055,3447.383,"That would be true, that would make no difference whether or not the gun was ever mentioned because the drugs themselves would have given him the right to arrest and finding of the gun would have been permissible as an incidental body search after he had the initial right to arrest."
1971.70-283,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3447.383,3458.461,But you don't have a right to take everything you find in an incidental body search unless it's contraband for use in committing a crime and I take it your argument is that the gun doesn't meet those tests?
1971.70-283,1,22478,edward_f_hennessey,,3458.461,3473.755,"No, I think he has the right to remove it temporarily and then the question would be whether or not he had the right to return it, and additionally whether or not he had the right to -- he has the right to remove it part of the self protective body search."
1971.70-283,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3486.935,3509.652,"But now when we come to trying to evaluate what is the law of Connecticut under the statute that you have been arguing namely that he can lawfully sit there 2:30 in the morning with a loaded gun in his belt is not the decision of the Supreme Court of Connecticut, the state law binding on this Court?"
1971.70-283,1,22478,edward_f_hennessey,,3509.652,3524.98,"Well, my only answer I can give you to that Your Honor is that the State Court decision in Williams which was decided in -- actually the whole case was framed before Terry was even thought of."
1971.70-283,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3569.479,3570.723,Thank you Mr. Hennessey.
1971.70-283,2,20582,donald_a_browne,,3573.083,3577.405,"I would if I have time left, and I don't know whether I do or not."
1971.70-283,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3579.592,3585.21,"Let me say we will enlarge your time three minutes to conform with the additional time, so you got time enough?"
1971.70-283,2,20582,donald_a_browne,,3585.21,3595.753,The question of the possibility of a pistol permit appears for the first time in 1970 when the matter is argued to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals.
1971.70-283,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3797.984,3814.542,"Mr. Browne, do I get your -- the state's position accurately that you do concede that you can't support the searches, that is machete and the heroin seized from the person without a finding that the arrest was on probable cause?"
1971.70-283,2,20582,donald_a_browne,,3814.542,3816.673,"The arrest for carrying a pistol, absolutely no."
1971.70-283,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3821.23,3832.055,"In other words, you don't try to support them on any theory that this was a Terry kind of search and to the extent that -- I mean, Terry kind of detention and to the extent it was, that that would support searches?"
1971.70-283,2,20582,donald_a_browne,,3832.055,3834.98,"We maintain Terry supports, his seizing that pistol."
1971.70-283,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3834.98,3835.987,"Yes, but not the evidence?"
1971.70-283,2,20582,donald_a_browne,,3835.987,3860.329,"Step two, we submit he is legally arrested for possession of a pistol without a permit and step three, we submit that he is validly contemporaneously searched incidental to his arrest which discloses the heroin and which discloses the machete under the seat and incidentally for the purpose of the record as long as the machete is more than four inches in length, it is a crime in the State of Connecticut to carry it."
1971.70-283,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3865.651,3870.306,You don't claim the informer's statement was probable cause for a search of heroin?
1971.70-283,2,20582,donald_a_browne,,3870.306,3882.114,"No, I don't submit that the informer's tip was probable cause to search for heroin, but I do make the claim relative to the possession of the pistol that the location of the pistol --"
1971.70-283,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3882.114,3884.395,"This was Terry, a reasonable suspension?"
1971.70-283,2,20582,donald_a_browne,,3884.395,3886.606,"The search for the seizure of the pistol, yes."
1971.70-283,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3903.939,3911.564,You aren't making the argument that finding of the gun was collaboration enough of the informer's tip?
1971.70-283,2,20582,donald_a_browne,,3911.564,3914.499,To proceed to arrest for narcotics.
1971.70-283,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3919.093,3920.39,You haven't made the (Inaudible)
1971.70-283,2,20582,donald_a_browne,,3920.39,3921.443,I have not as yet.
1971.70-283,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3922.401,3923.822,You're about to -- you are about to --
1971.70-283,2,20582,donald_a_browne,,3923.822,3928.182,"Well, of course obviously it depends again as to whether or not the pistol was validly ceased."
1971.70-283,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3937.34,3945.324,The informer did tell the officer that the man sitting in the car across the street had narcotics in his possession?
1971.70-283,2,20582,donald_a_browne,,3945.324,3945.559,Yes.
1971.70-283,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3945.559,3948.934,And the officer testified that he had reason to believe that this as a reliable informer?
1971.70-283,2,20582,donald_a_browne,,3948.934,3949.919,That's correct.
1971.70-283,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3949.919,3957.154,Why wasn't there -- why don't you at least argue that there is probable cause to search for narcotics?
1971.70-283,2,20582,donald_a_browne,,3957.154,3976.091,"Well, essentially on the basis that there has been no showing sufficiently that this informer himself had previously presented sufficient information to make him a reliable informant or truly he doesn't state the basis of his knowledge, he doesn't say that he saw the narcotics or that Williams told him he had the narcotics."
1971.70-283,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3987.184,3994.964,"Judge Friendly said there is a difference between expert on homosexuality and expert on drugs, you agree?"
1971.70-283,2,20582,donald_a_browne,,3994.964,3995.98,I can't speak.
1971.70-283,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3995.98,4000.224,This is an age of specialization?[Attempt to Laughter]
1971.70-283,2,20582,donald_a_browne,,4000.224,4024.628,"The only other thing I would say is that I was a little surprised this afternoon when my brother did make the claim that he felt that it was improper, illegal, unconstitutional whatever you have for Connolly to walk out of the gas station across Hamilton street, in view of the statement in this brief that the case law of recognizing the right to stop applies fairly broad standards in support of such action, the right to execute a search is more reasonably defined."
1971.70-283,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4068.207,4069.988,"Thank you Mr. Browne, thank you Mr. Hennessey."
