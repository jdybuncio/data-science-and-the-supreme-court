1993.93-5256,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.621,"We'll hear argument next in Number 93-5256, Fredel Williamson v. The United States."
1993.93-5256,0,18135,benjamin_s_waxman,,35.642,46.592,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1993.93-5256,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,125.263,128.434,The declarant is what you're--
1993.93-5256,0,18135,benjamin_s_waxman,,128.434,131.729,"Harris, which was the person whose statement we're concerned with."
1993.93-5256,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,131.729,132.729,--You pronounced it declarant.
1993.93-5256,0,18135,benjamin_s_waxman,,132.729,133.838,The declarant.
1993.93-5256,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,133.838,136.804,"Well, just so I understand what you're talking about."
1993.93-5256,0,18135,benjamin_s_waxman,,136.804,138.366,I'm sorry.
1993.93-5256,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,195.905,205.182,"But the declarant did admit his own criminal liability, at least to something in this area."
1993.93-5256,0,18135,benjamin_s_waxman,,205.182,211.367,"He admitted very minimally that he was a courier, that he was someone who was following directions, he was a mule."
1993.93-5256,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,211.367,222.224,"He was found in position, and he knew what it was, and he was transporting it, so that would be enough to convict the declarant of several offenses, I--"
1993.93-5256,0,18135,benjamin_s_waxman,,222.224,233.189,"That's correct, and even without his statements the courts have sustained conviction after conviction based on an individual's presence in a vehicle under these statements without even the incriminating statements."
1993.93-5256,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,233.189,236.892,--Were there conspiracy charges brought against the two defendants?
1993.93-5256,0,18135,benjamin_s_waxman,,236.892,238.422,There was a conspiracy charge.
1993.93-5256,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,238.422,244.871,"Well, are you saying this entire class of statements can't be admitted, Mr. Waxman?"
1993.93-5256,0,18135,benjamin_s_waxman,,256.523,278.671,"The broad exclusionary principle would be that these types of statements... in other words, statements of uncross-examined, alleged accomplices such as Harris, which are made in the throngs of custodial interrogation which implicate in a self-serving way a defendant such as Williamson, should categorically be excluded."
1993.93-5256,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,278.671,283.231,"Well, you put so many qualifications on it, though, that it's hard to know how general your principle is."
1993.93-5256,0,18135,benjamin_s_waxman,,304.457,316.703,"We do disagree with that, but I think the focus of this Court should be on this peculiar narrow category of statements that falls within the general category, and this is what the Court discussed in Lee."
1993.93-5256,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,316.703,316.967,Well--
1993.93-5256,0,18135,benjamin_s_waxman,,325.947,331.353,"I believe that it is, but I don't believe the Court needs to get to that issue."
1993.93-5256,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,331.353,349.985,"In Lee, and in a subsequent case coming out of New Mexico, didn't we really describe a presumption against admitting the evidence, rather than making it a categorical rule?"
1993.93-5256,0,18135,benjamin_s_waxman,,349.985,351.344,That's correct.
1993.93-5256,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,351.344,359.982,And do you... can you prevail here only if the Court adopts a categorical rule?
1993.93-5256,0,18135,benjamin_s_waxman,,359.982,360.373,No.
1993.93-5256,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,373.882,379.16,But you don't want us to just stick by Lee and the other cases that we've decided.
1993.93-5256,0,18135,benjamin_s_waxman,,380.394,404.151,"--I think in... today, with 30 years of experience of these types of statements, and seeing the validity of the presumption and, indeed, that these statements are categorically, inherently, and uniquely untrustworthy... any person in this position instinctively will seek to curry favor and to lay blame elsewhere."
1993.93-5256,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,404.151,412.304,"Why shouldn't... as a matter of general principle, why shouldn't we leave it to the jury to figure this out and maybe give them some instructions?"
1993.93-5256,0,18135,benjamin_s_waxman,,412.304,418.988,Because the jury was never presented with the facts and the circumstances to be able to fairly evaluate this statement.
1993.93-5256,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,443.495,449.492,"Well, you're giving us a lot of facts here about why Harris' declaration wasn't trustworthy."
1993.93-5256,0,18135,benjamin_s_waxman,,452.74,454.13,Some of them could be.
1993.93-5256,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,477.684,483.119,"Well, you've certainly got the ability to bring some of the facts before the jury, as you indicate."
1993.93-5256,0,18135,benjamin_s_waxman,,488.428,502.564,"That's correct, but under this set of circumstances, we're presented with a situation that in every case is going to bring before the Court statements that are inherently untrustworthy."
1993.93-5256,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,502.564,507.609,What about... is it untrustworthy to the extent that they incriminated Harris himself?
1993.93-5256,0,18135,benjamin_s_waxman,,510.327,513.654,I think that that's a way that the Court could go.
1993.93-5256,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,557.495,561.869,On the ground that those are not against Harris' penal interest--
1993.93-5256,0,18135,benjamin_s_waxman,,561.869,562.744,"--Correct, and indeed--"
1993.93-5256,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,562.744,568.585,--and on the contrary they tend to make him a lesser actor in this criminal affair.
1993.93-5256,0,18135,benjamin_s_waxman,,568.585,571.022,"--Correct, and particularly on the facts of this case."
1993.93-5256,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,604.321,618.081,What would your rule be if the statement which inculpated the defendant also included admissions against the declarant which went beyond anything the police might have known at that point?
1993.93-5256,0,18135,benjamin_s_waxman,,622.299,639.244,"I think the broad principle, and the primary factor, is that we are in the context of custodial interrogation, a context that this Court has recognized in numerous cases is fraught with the possibility of coercion, is fraught with the concern of what the state--"
1993.93-5256,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,639.244,641.962,"Well, if we're worried about that, we won't let anything in."
1993.93-5256,0,18135,benjamin_s_waxman,,678.573,696.065,"--I would urge that the Court should adopt a broad principle that would be protective of circumstances such as this, where the danger that the statement may be not true and untrustworthy is great enough that we may indeed have--"
1993.93-5256,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,696.065,701.064,But the danger is less... I take it you would agree the danger is less in the case that I put.
1993.93-5256,0,18135,benjamin_s_waxman,,701.064,702.032,--Absolutely.
1993.93-5256,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,774.44,775.142,Because he was afraid--
1993.93-5256,0,18135,benjamin_s_waxman,,778.0,780.39,"That was brought out to the jury, absolutely."
1993.93-5256,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,780.39,786.248,So it's not as if you can't bring this to the attention of the factfinder.
1993.93-5256,0,18135,benjamin_s_waxman,,786.248,802.928,"Some of the facts and circumstances can be brought to the attention of the factfinder, but the concern is that they do not get the full flavor that they're entitled to when dealing with this witness who, whether present or absent, was the most crucial witness in the entire case."
1993.93-5256,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,825.7,828.855,"Well, did the defendant take the stand here, in this case?"
1993.93-5256,0,18135,benjamin_s_waxman,,828.855,830.495,"--No, the defendant did not take the stand."
1993.93-5256,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,830.495,839.35,"Did Harris... was Harris called to testify in front of the jury, and did he take the Fifth in the presence of the jury?"
1993.93-5256,0,18135,benjamin_s_waxman,,839.35,839.568,No.
1993.93-5256,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,841.178,841.959,But he could have been?
1993.93-5256,0,18135,benjamin_s_waxman,,846.894,849.049,--I would say... excuse me.
1993.93-5256,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,859.437,864.45,"I thought that happened all the time, because that's one of the circumstances the jury can then consider."
1993.93-5256,0,18135,benjamin_s_waxman,,868.011,888.3,"--It's always been my understanding as a defense attorney that if I know a particular party is going to invoke the Fifth, then I'm not permitted to call that party and to have them invoke their constitutional rights in front of the jury, and then to argue from that invocation that... you know, inferences about what the person might have said or might not have said."
1993.93-5256,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,888.3,892.079,"But here the invocation was before the judge, right?"
1993.93-5256,0,18135,benjamin_s_waxman,,892.079,892.361,Correct.
1993.93-5256,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,892.361,895.609,And the judge offered the witness immunity.
1993.93-5256,0,18135,benjamin_s_waxman,,895.609,895.968,Correct.
1993.93-5256,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,895.968,899.842,"And the witness said no, and then what happened?"
1993.93-5256,0,18135,benjamin_s_waxman,,899.842,922.036,"Ultimately, the witness was held in contempt, and that was the end of Harris' position in court, and at that point the Government went behind its severance motion and put on the agent to testify about what Harris said out of court, not under oath, about what he claims Williamson did."
1993.93-5256,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,943.886,953.352,"Mr. Waxman, what are your best authorities for... under the Federal rule here that the state would invoke?"
1993.93-5256,0,18135,benjamin_s_waxman,,967.096,971.578,--The case that we relied on most heavily would be Flores out of the Fifth Circuit.
1993.93-5256,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,996.427,1013.514,"It's sort of surprising that there isn't more authority for the meaning of the rule in terms of what comes in along with the statement, whether related statements come in, or they don't, or whether redaction is required."
1993.93-5256,0,18135,benjamin_s_waxman,,1013.514,1021.606,"Well, quite frankly I think that there has been some confusion under the rule, and the courts have adopted numerous different ways of approaching these issues."
1993.93-5256,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1072.006,1079.284,"Well, if this statement had been redacted to strike out the name of Williamson, would you be here today?"
1993.93-5256,0,18135,benjamin_s_waxman,,1079.284,1082.564,"--No, nor would the statement have been introduced, because it would have--"
1993.93-5256,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1082.564,1083.424,It wouldn't be relevant--
1993.93-5256,0,18135,benjamin_s_waxman,,1083.424,1084.36,--It would have had no--
1993.93-5256,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1084.36,1085.141,"--perhaps, or would it?"
1993.93-5256,0,18135,benjamin_s_waxman,,1086.313,1089.03,--It would have had no relevance in Williamson's trial.
1993.93-5256,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1098.465,1099.213,"Well, why wouldn't it be relevant?"
1993.93-5256,0,18135,benjamin_s_waxman,,1121.33,1123.032,I think Your Honor--
1993.93-5256,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1123.032,1123.75,--so it would get in.
1993.93-5256,0,18135,benjamin_s_waxman,,1123.75,1125.141,--I think Your Honor is correct.
1993.93-5256,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1126.937,1127.234,Right.
1993.93-5256,0,18135,benjamin_s_waxman,,1127.234,1132.873,"--Cuban male at some point in Fort Lauderdale, and it's true there was a conspiracy charge here."
1993.93-5256,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1132.873,1133.216,Right.
1993.93-5256,0,18135,benjamin_s_waxman,,1133.216,1133.998,I take back what I said.
1993.93-5256,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1133.998,1134.621,I think it would get in.
1993.93-5256,0,18135,benjamin_s_waxman,,1145.961,1151.709,"I think the Court could find that it was applied incorrectly, and I would be satisfied with a ruling to that extent."
1993.93-5256,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1151.709,1153.256,Why would we want to go beyond that?
1993.93-5256,0,18135,benjamin_s_waxman,,1172.296,1188.6,"Because I think what the Court needs to do is to give guidance to the lower courts on how to deal with these type of statements which are often the most strong and possibly the only evidence that the Government has to convict a defendant, and in cases that have been decided by this Court--"
1993.93-5256,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1188.6,1199.487,"Why should the guidance be anything more than, take that line seriously, and you can say, to the extent that the statement is purely self-serving, that it doesn't satisfy that requirement."
1993.93-5256,0,18135,benjamin_s_waxman,,1204.938,1211.154,"--Again, with that kind of a ruling the petitioner would prevail, and we would certainly be satisfied."
1993.93-5256,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1254.903,1260.713,"But you conceded earlier, and I think you're sticking to it, that to the extent it incriminated Harris, it could come in."
1993.93-5256,0,18135,benjamin_s_waxman,,1267.507,1268.991,"Yes, there was."
1993.93-5256,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1268.991,1279.564,"So there would be some relevance to having Harris say, yes, I was the courier, and then there were at least three items of evidence that connected Williamson to the car."
1993.93-5256,0,18135,benjamin_s_waxman,,1279.564,1281.548,"There were, that's correct."
1993.93-5256,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1281.548,1283.828,"What was that evidence, just his name on the rental agreement?"
1993.93-5256,0,18135,benjamin_s_waxman,,1283.828,1285.889,His name was on the rental agreement.
1993.93-5256,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1301.776,1304.322,Is that the extent of the evidence that connected him with the vehicle?
1993.93-5256,0,18135,benjamin_s_waxman,,1304.322,1306.789,--That was the extent of it.
1993.93-5256,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1306.789,1316.067,"Was there some correspondence, something with... or am I confusing this with another situation, something with a girlfriend?"
1993.93-5256,0,18135,benjamin_s_waxman,,1316.067,1322.346,"The girl... the connection with the girlfriend, I believe, was the initials on the luggage in which the cocaine was found."
1993.93-5256,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1322.346,1323.612,I thought that was a relative.
1993.93-5256,0,18135,benjamin_s_waxman,,1323.612,1325.719,"No, that was his sister."
1993.93-5256,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1325.719,1326.219,Yes.
1993.93-5256,0,18135,benjamin_s_waxman,,1328.343,1331.17,"I'm sorry, I apologize."
1993.93-5256,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1357.816,1369.919,"What if they're inextricably intertwined, that in two or three sentences, each sentence has some declaration against penal interest, but also some inculpation of third parties?"
1993.93-5256,0,18135,benjamin_s_waxman,,1369.919,1396.832,"I think, for instance... the example that comes to my mind is Lee, where there were references to ""we did this"", and ""we did that"", and I would urge the Court that... the Court conceivably could separate that situation out and suggest that those circumstances be separately analyzed, but again, what I believe is the crucial factor here is the fact that these statements again are made in the coercive atmosphere of custodial interrogation, and even those--"
1993.93-5256,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1396.832,1409.577,"Of course, if they're coercive statements, custodial atmosphere, that's a... presumably the Miranda warnings take care of that, so I mean, we're not... I would think we wouldn't be arguing that point here."
1993.93-5256,0,18135,benjamin_s_waxman,,1409.577,1426.132,"--Well, I think this Court's cases have recognized that even given Miranda warnings, it could still be determined that a statement was involuntary due to the coercive circumstances of the custodial interrogation, but yes, that conceivably could address these circumstances."
1993.93-5256,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1426.132,1435.691,So you don't agree that the parts that incriminated Harris and the parts that incriminated Williamson were inextricably intertwined here.
1993.93-5256,0,18135,benjamin_s_waxman,,1435.691,1444.656,"Absolutely not, and again I think the contrast here would be Lee, where there's a much better argument that these statements were inextricably intertwined."
1993.93-5256,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1448.702,1449.56,"Very well, Mr. Waxman."
1993.93-5256,1,31702,john_f_manning,,1450.996,1461.899,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1993.93-5256,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1537.726,1573.337,"Well, Mr. Manning, under the plain language of the rule, how much of this statement can the Government get in, or is there some requirement that we analyze the statement and each part of it to see whether a reasonable person in the declarant's shoes would have made it and thought it... wouldn't have made it unless he thought it were true, because there is some concern here that insofar as the statement implicates Williamson, perhaps it doesn't meet that requirement."
1993.93-5256,1,31702,john_f_manning,,1573.337,1576.195,"Well, there are two distinct answers to that."
1993.93-5256,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1600.374,1605.059,But wouldn't it have to meet the requirement of the rule itself to be admitted?
1993.93-5256,1,31702,john_f_manning,,1605.059,1605.496,"--Oh, absolutely, Your Honor."

1993.93-5256,1,31702,john_f_manning,,1609.62,1612.525,"Well, yes, we think it absolutely can, for a couple of reasons."
1993.93-5256,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1636.922,1654.742,"Yes, but insofar as the declarant is seemingly trying, or could be seen as trying to minimize the declarant's own role when caught red-handed and have the major offender be somebody else, maybe it doesn't meet that test."
1993.93-5256,1,31702,john_f_manning,,1654.742,1664.519,"--Well, we think that the Court absolutely has to look at the statement as a whole and make a determination of whether the entire statement is actually in the declarant's penal interest."

1993.93-5256,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1693.071,1693.868,--what the Court can do?
1993.93-5256,1,31702,john_f_manning,,1693.868,1707.783,"--It would certainly be appropriate in the right kind of case, but we would say that the right kind of case would be a case where the other statement would not be related, or would not be against the declarant's penal interest, and let me give you an example, if I may, of the distinction that we would draw in this situation."

1993.93-5256,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1918.138,1918.558,"Of this very case, yes."
1993.93-5256,1,31702,john_f_manning,,1918.558,1920.058,"Well, we think that there are several circumstances."

1993.93-5256,1,31702,john_f_manning,,1936.176,1937.629,We think--
1993.93-5256,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1937.629,1939.691,--and that no one would try to pass the blame onto a third party?

1993.93-5256,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1945.875,1970.256,"Mr. Manning, isn't the most logical inference that when somebody is caught red-handed, has every incentive to put the blame on somebody else, and that that... putting the blame on the other person has no reasonable... why would anyone have reason to believe that putting the blame on somebody else is true?"
1993.93-5256,1,31702,john_f_manning,,1975.067,1975.488,--Well--
1993.93-5256,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1975.488,1976.567,Williamson was the big guy.
1993.93-5256,1,31702,john_f_manning,,1981.752,1990.998,"--Well, in fact, we think that he did not try to minimize his role in the offense in the way that you describe, with respect, Justice Ginsburg."
1993.93-5256,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2048.929,2051.786,"But as far as Harris is concerned, Harris paints himself as the courier, right--"
1993.93-5256,1,31702,john_f_manning,,2051.786,2052.802,--But--
1993.93-5256,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2052.802,2055.77,--the one who arranged it and not the one to whom the delivery was being made?
1993.93-5256,1,31702,john_f_manning,,2055.77,2065.469,"--But in this case, painting yourself as a courier is a very significant role in the offense, and it subjected him to charges not only of possession with intent to distribute, but also conspiracy."
1993.93-5256,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2065.469,2069.969,"That much is against his penal interests, and I don't think there's any quarrel about that."
1993.93-5256,1,31702,john_f_manning,,2083.493,2090.6,"Well, certainly in a case like this, where you're describing your role in a conspiracy, every detail that you give to the police helps to sink you further."
1993.93-5256,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2096.051,2097.582,May I just ask one question?
1993.93-5256,1,31702,john_f_manning,,2097.582,2098.301,Sure.
1993.93-5256,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2098.301,2119.182,"In determining whether it's against penal interest, it is not merely a kind of a schoolroom textbook analysis of whether there's an additional element of criminal liability, but also on the other side of the balance is maybe he thought this would give him more lenient treatment from the prosecutor because he was cooperating with the police, and shouldn't that be evaluated in determining whether the net value was against his penal interest?"
1993.93-5256,1,31702,john_f_manning,,2119.182,2123.385,That is certainly a factor for the district court to consider in considering the totality of the circumstances.
1993.93-5256,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2123.385,2135.973,"And so if we have a case in which the substantial motive for making the statement is to obtain more lenient treatment, what ought the result to be?"
1993.93-5256,1,31702,john_f_manning,,2135.973,2140.456,"Well, again, it depends on what other circumstances obtain."
1993.93-5256,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2192.701,2200.839,"But if the substantial motive is to obtain leniency, it seems to me that that undercuts the rationale of the rule."
1993.93-5256,1,31702,john_f_manning,,2217.271,2235.575,"If the district court finds, based upon a preponderance of the evidence, that the statement that the declarant made was in his penal interest in the sense that he inculpated someone else in an effort to gain leniency, then that certainly would be a finding that should be sustained and it would be a proper application of the rule."
1993.93-5256,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2248.507,2251.148,"Well, I just want to make clear what your position is."
1993.93-5256,1,31702,john_f_manning,,2261.597,2271.124,"Again, I think that it's very difficult to answer that question without knowing all of the facts that surround the statement, but it would be a factor--"
1993.93-5256,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2271.124,2275.027,"Well, why is it against penal interest if the dominant motive is to obtain leniency?"
1993.93-5256,1,31702,john_f_manning,,2275.027,2306.797,"--Well, because if the dominant motive is to obtain leniency, but the declarant makes a statement that is very, very strongly against his penal interest and the district court concludes that no one in the declarant's position under all of the circumstances of the case... for example, he has admitted to a murder, and his quest for leniency will gain him very little... if the district court in those circumstances makes the determination that no reasonable person in the declarant's circumstances would have made the statement unless believing it to be true, then the district court would appropriately admit that statement under Rule 804(b)(3)."
1993.93-5256,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2306.797,2315.137,Is the district court always well-situated to determine what a person's dominant motive or prevailing motive was in making a statement?
1993.93-5256,1,31702,john_f_manning,,2315.137,2322.697,"Well, the district court has to consider all of the evidence that is submitted by the Government and by the defendant in making the determination."
1993.93-5256,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2328.022,2335.238,Why should we ask any factfinder involved in this evidentiary... to make a finding as to what someone's dominant motive was?
1993.93-5256,1,31702,john_f_manning,,2335.238,2354.7,"Well, because what the district court has to... the determination that the district court has to make is whether a reasonable person in the declarant's position would have a motive to fabricate his confession, and in that sense the district court inevitably is making an inquiry into what a reasonable person in the declarant's position would be motivated by."
1993.93-5256,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2408.21,2410.069,"But that's true with respect to any hearsay, isn't it?"
1993.93-5256,1,31702,john_f_manning,,2410.069,2424.328,"--That's true about any hearsay, and the Court has relied on Rule 806 in holding that, for example, coconspirator's statements can be admitted pursuant to a firmly rooted hearsay exception, because it mitigates the concern that surrounds the admission of hearsay."
1993.93-5256,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2424.328,2445.821,"Mr. Manning, at least getting away from the question of motive, you would at least... I take it you would admit that it would be a correct statement to say that if the trial court reasonably reads the statement as conferring a net benefit on its face as conferring a net benefit upon the declarant, that it would be inadmissible."
1993.93-5256,1,31702,john_f_manning,,2447.585,2468.967,"Well, I think we would prefer to put it in terms of the rule itself, that the district court found that a reasonable person in the declarant's position would make the statement even though he did not believe it was true, that is, if he had some benefit, something to gain by fabricating a statement, then absolutely the district court would properly exclude that evidence."
1993.93-5256,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2468.967,2475.948,"Well, don't you always have something to be gained by making a statement which is in effect net in your favor?"
1993.93-5256,1,31702,john_f_manning,,2475.948,2481.93,"Well, I suppose if you put it that way you would have something to gain if the statement were net in your favor."

1993.93-5256,1,31702,john_f_manning,,2526.084,2533.691,"Well, that's right, Your Honor, and that's why it's important to give the district court the latitude it needs to look at all the circumstances of the case."

1993.93-5256,1,31702,john_f_manning,,2634.603,2644.27,"--Well, it would have to suppose that a reasonable person calculating the advantage of telling a lie would tell a lie in these circumstances."

1993.93-5256,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2699.234,2709.556,"Well, you do, but there has been a lot of strong language in a number of this Court's cases, a recent one being Lee v. Illinois, about the untrustworthiness of this kind of statement."
