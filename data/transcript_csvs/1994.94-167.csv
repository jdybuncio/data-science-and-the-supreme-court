1994.94-167,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,12.158,"We'll hear argument first this morning in number 94-167, Katia Gutierrez de Martinez v. Dirk Lamagno."
1994.94-167,0,28667,isidoro_rodriguez,,13.741,15.601,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1994.94-167,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,115.785,120.0,"Well, they did change the statutory language, didn't they?"
1994.94-167,0,28667,isidoro_rodriguez,,120.0,120.47,--Yes.
1994.94-167,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,137.151,141.842,And what did the Federal Drivers Act say about judicial review?
1994.94-167,0,28667,isidoro_rodriguez,,141.842,150.22,"It said nothing, with the exception on the issue of removal from the State court to the Federal court, which permitted a challenge by the individual."
1994.94-167,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,159.945,161.137,"Well, now, now, wait a minute."
1994.94-167,0,28667,isidoro_rodriguez,,166.539,170.673,--I... I... in reviewing the decision--
1994.94-167,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,170.673,173.245,"No; you can answer that question yes or no, surely."
1994.94-167,0,28667,isidoro_rodriguez,,173.245,176.498,"--Specifically, no... within the Drivers--"
1994.94-167,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,176.498,177.116,Yes.
1994.94-167,0,28667,isidoro_rodriguez,,177.116,177.857,--The Federal Drivers Act.
1994.94-167,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,180.989,183.94,"Well, was it any other kind of letter law within the statute?"
1994.94-167,0,28667,isidoro_rodriguez,,183.94,184.722,"No, Your Honor."
1994.94-167,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,231.993,237.365,"And what is the argument that that would deny due process... this accident took place in Colombia, right?"
1994.94-167,0,28667,isidoro_rodriguez,,237.365,238.126,Correct.
1994.94-167,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,238.126,241.399,"And you're perfectly free to sue in the courts of Colombia, I take it?"
1994.94-167,0,28667,isidoro_rodriguez,,241.399,242.188,"No, Your Honor."
1994.94-167,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,250.525,252.857,As against him as an individual?
1994.94-167,0,28667,isidoro_rodriguez,,260.011,260.841,Correct.
1994.94-167,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,260.841,261.994,--In the United States either.
1994.94-167,0,28667,isidoro_rodriguez,,261.994,269.456,"Well, you could not under Colombian civil law sue him as an individual as a result of his being in the service of a foreign embassy."
1994.94-167,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,269.456,270.648,With diplomatic immunity?
1994.94-167,0,28667,isidoro_rodriguez,,270.648,271.009,Correct.
1994.94-167,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,285.408,288.9,This... this accident occurred after the Westfall Act was passed?
1994.94-167,0,28667,isidoro_rodriguez,,288.9,289.309,Correct.
1994.94-167,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,289.309,289.84,Not before?
1994.94-167,0,28667,isidoro_rodriguez,,289.84,290.781,It occurred in... in January of '91.
1994.94-167,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,290.781,293.934,It's not as though the right to sue existed and then the Act took it away.
1994.94-167,0,28667,isidoro_rodriguez,,302.829,303.53,Correct.
1994.94-167,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,303.53,305.131,So why is that a denial of due process?
1994.94-167,0,28667,isidoro_rodriguez,,305.131,312.325,"Well, because essentially, even under the Federal Drivers Act you had a right to challenge the issue of the scope of employment to determine whether in fact at the time--"
1994.94-167,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,312.325,314.246,"Yes, but they changed that before this accident--"
1994.94-167,0,28667,isidoro_rodriguez,,314.246,317.068,--That is... that is the issue before this Court... whether in fact it was changed.
1994.94-167,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,317.068,327.764,"--Suppose... suppose the Federal Government says, ex ante, before... before an accident occurs, they... they say you cannot sue personally any Federal employee?"
1994.94-167,0,28667,isidoro_rodriguez,,327.764,330.218,Before the accident occurs?
1994.94-167,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,330.218,330.767,Yes.
1994.94-167,0,28667,isidoro_rodriguez,,347.908,349.058,Based on that hypothetical--
1994.94-167,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,349.058,352.21,Is that a denial of... of equal... of due process?
1994.94-167,0,28667,isidoro_rodriguez,,352.21,354.762,"--Well, it... no, based on that hypothetical."
1994.94-167,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,355.854,357.025,"Well, this is just one step short of that."
1994.94-167,0,28667,isidoro_rodriguez,,363.107,370.282,--I think... I think there's a large distinction between the hypothetical you presented and the facts with regard to the Westfall Act and the antecedent Federal Drivers Act.
1994.94-167,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,381.78,382.03,"No, wait."
1994.94-167,0,28667,isidoro_rodriguez,,394.368,395.43,--If it did--
1994.94-167,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,395.43,396.489,And that's all I'm speaking... yes--
1994.94-167,0,28667,isidoro_rodriguez,,396.489,397.33,--On your hypothetical--
1994.94-167,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,397.33,398.83,--You said... you said it would be a denial of due process.
1994.94-167,0,28667,isidoro_rodriguez,,398.83,399.151,--No.
1994.94-167,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,413.28,413.561,Right.
1994.94-167,0,28667,isidoro_rodriguez,,413.561,415.353,"Now, whether or not that was challenged subsequent--"
1994.94-167,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,415.353,419.975,Leaving it to the Attorney General is what... is what causes it to be a denial of due process?
1994.94-167,0,28667,isidoro_rodriguez,,419.975,424.259,--Leaving both issues... both the factfinding and the defending of the... of the... of the employee.
1994.94-167,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,428.52,441.109,"Well, before the Federal Tort Claims Act, you couldn't sue the Government for... for any injury inflicted by a... an employee acting in the course of... of his employment."
1994.94-167,0,28667,isidoro_rodriguez,,441.109,443.029,But that is the issue.
1994.94-167,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,465.506,469.406,But you have nothing at all before the Federal Tort Claims Act?
1994.94-167,0,28667,isidoro_rodriguez,,469.406,472.04,We had this lawsuit against the individual.
1994.94-167,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,480.195,489.021,"And you say the diplomatic immunity is so total that even acting outside the scope of employment, it would... there is no remedy in... in Colombia?"
1994.94-167,0,28667,isidoro_rodriguez,,489.021,492.403,There would be no way of getting into the court because of the diplomatic immunity.
1994.94-167,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,492.403,496.094,"Well, how can you lay venue against him back here in the United States?"
1994.94-167,0,28667,isidoro_rodriguez,,496.094,498.127,Because... because he is a resident of Virginia.
1994.94-167,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,509.303,511.104,And was... was he served with process in the action?
1994.94-167,0,28667,isidoro_rodriguez,,511.104,517.308,"--We served process both on... on the Agency head and also on... on the Agency in his name, which was accepted."
1994.94-167,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,517.308,524.895,"Well, was it... yes, but I... this is collateral, but I... I doubt that they could accept service for him personally, could they?"
1994.94-167,0,28667,isidoro_rodriguez,,524.895,527.917,"Well, they... we never received it back to our process server, Your Honor."
1994.94-167,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,527.917,534.75,"You... you sued him personally based on all-purpose jurisdiction, you sued him where he resided, his all-purpose forum where he resided?"
1994.94-167,0,28667,isidoro_rodriguez,,534.75,535.261,Yes.
1994.94-167,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,535.261,541.565,"You said you would be left without a remedy, but isn't there some kind of administrative proceeding ongoing before the DEA?"
1994.94-167,0,28667,isidoro_rodriguez,,541.565,544.046,Theoretically there is an administrative process.
1994.94-167,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,571.524,573.745,Could you tell me a little bit more about your due process argument?
1994.94-167,0,28667,isidoro_rodriguez,,588.335,595.52,"Well, the... the... the line of reason from this Court starts out that there is a property right in a common law action."
1994.94-167,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,606.096,609.308,And what's your... your closest case in point from this Court?
1994.94-167,0,28667,isidoro_rodriguez,,609.308,611.431,"Okay, one moment, Your Honor."
1994.94-167,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,629.153,633.324,"Well, of course, you're making an argument of a property right."
1994.94-167,0,28667,isidoro_rodriguez,,651.217,652.178,But--
1994.94-167,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,652.178,661.064,"There was no cause of action expected or anticipated, except one that was subject to this Attorney General's specification."
1994.94-167,0,28667,isidoro_rodriguez,,661.064,669.089,"--But that's only if you abide by the analysis that when the Westfall Act was passed, it was designed to remove judicial review."
1994.94-167,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,672.651,677.743,Let... let me ask one... one more variation about the due process question.
1994.94-167,0,28667,isidoro_rodriguez,,694.774,699.169,I believe that... that you'd have the same sort of... of problem of having the factfinder--
1994.94-167,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,699.169,700.571,"Well, he's not finding any facts."
1994.94-167,0,28667,isidoro_rodriguez,,705.423,705.693,--Yes.
1994.94-167,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,706.454,706.933,The same problem.
1994.94-167,0,28667,isidoro_rodriguez,,706.933,716.9,--The issue of bias by the factfinder is one of the key ingredients of... of... of this particular case.
1994.94-167,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,728.187,729.659,Are your clients American citizens?
1994.94-167,0,28667,isidoro_rodriguez,,729.659,731.088,"No, they are Colombian citizens."
1994.94-167,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,731.088,732.821,And the accident occurred in Colombia?
1994.94-167,0,28667,isidoro_rodriguez,,732.821,733.349,"In Barranquilla, Colombia."
1994.94-167,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,733.349,735.082,And they're protected by the due process clause?
1994.94-167,0,28667,isidoro_rodriguez,,735.082,737.353,They're... they're--
1994.94-167,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,737.353,740.385,Is the whole world protected by the due process clause of the American Constitution?
1994.94-167,0,28667,isidoro_rodriguez,,740.385,741.847,"--It's sad to say, no."
1994.94-167,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,764.411,768.772,The whole... the whole world has a right protected by the United States Constitution to litigate in Virginia?
1994.94-167,0,28667,isidoro_rodriguez,,768.772,769.283,No.
1994.94-167,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,777.398,777.668,Right.
1994.94-167,0,28667,isidoro_rodriguez,,779.882,783.573,--To ensure that he has due process within the judicial system to have his case litigated.
1994.94-167,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,783.573,784.434,That's new to me.
1994.94-167,0,28667,isidoro_rodriguez,,791.069,794.171,We're not... we're not extending the due process clause to France.
1994.94-167,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,802.616,805.628,What's... what's your authority from this Court for that proposition?
1994.94-167,0,28667,isidoro_rodriguez,,805.628,809.14,"--I... I have none, Your Honor."
1994.94-167,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,809.14,811.712,"Mr. Rodriguez, did you make this constitutional argument in your brief?"
1994.94-167,0,28667,isidoro_rodriguez,,811.712,812.941,Not in my brief.
1994.94-167,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,813.632,815.843,I'm surprised you spent all the time on a constitutional argument.
1994.94-167,0,28667,isidoro_rodriguez,,817.325,818.896,"--It is a statutory case, Your Honor."
1994.94-167,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,822.999,824.509,It was suggested in your brief.
1994.94-167,0,28667,isidoro_rodriguez,,825.47,825.971,It was suggested--
1994.94-167,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,825.971,828.042,"--It's the point in your brief that most troubles me, as a matter of fact."
1994.94-167,0,28667,isidoro_rodriguez,,828.042,836.479,--It was suggested in my brief in the sense that it follows the Petrousky argument in the... that... that the Westfall Act assured that there would be judicial review and that--
1994.94-167,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,836.479,846.544,"Your point isn't that it's unconstitutional; your point is that it would be... since it would be unconstitutional if it were interpreted the... the way you don't want it interpreted, we shouldn't interpret it that way."
1994.94-167,0,28667,isidoro_rodriguez,,849.316,849.767,"--Correct, Your Honor."
1994.94-167,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,854.06,854.95,"Very well, Mr. Rodriguez."
1994.94-167,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,856.101,874.113,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1994.94-167,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,925.415,929.688,"And where abouts in the statute does the word ""shall"" that you're referring to--"
1994.94-167,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,929.688,936.484,"The word 2679 (d)(1) says,"
1994.94-167,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,942.218,943.137,"--Oh, you're going a little fast."
1994.94-167,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,943.137,943.728,"--Oh, I'm sorry."
1994.94-167,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,943.728,945.548,Would you repeat?
1994.94-167,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,945.548,969.123,"""Upon certification by the Attorney General that the defendant employee was acting within the scope of his office or employment at the time of the incident out of which the claim arose, any civil action or proceeding commenced upon such claim in the United States District Court shall be deemed an action against the United States under the provisions of this Title and all references thereto, and the United States shall be substituted as the party defendant. """
1994.94-167,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,974.889,981.054,"No, it contains more than similar language, it goes on to say, (2)... which relates to removal... it says,"
1994.94-167,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,986.976,987.546,Right.
1994.94-167,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,987.546,991.549,"Now, what is the position of the United States when... when something is removed?"
1994.94-167,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1000.595,1001.376,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1994.94-167,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1021.078,1022.258,"Well, that's very strange, isn't it?"
1994.94-167,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1022.258,1025.371,"Well, it's certainly the normal rule in--"
1994.94-167,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1025.371,1026.992,What is the basis for jurisdiction then?
1994.94-167,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1026.992,1031.435,"--The... the normal rule of Federal jurisdiction, obviously, is that a Federal defense, by itself, won't confer jurisdiction."
1994.94-167,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1056.772,1063.615,"Yes, but even... even assuming that it's constitutional to do that... and I think there is some question about it... it is certainly weird to do that."
1994.94-167,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1074.134,1074.474,Well--
1994.94-167,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1074.474,1077.966,"And not allow the Federal court, once having decided that, to send it back to the State court."
1994.94-167,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1079.365,1090.633,"--Well, I think, as Mr. Kellogg has pointed out in his brief, there is a divergence of opinion among the Circuits as to the factors to be taken into account in certifying and the factors to be taken into account in judicial review."
1994.94-167,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1129.258,1143.179,"But could... it could well be that the scheme makes a lot more sense if we just say that it's not reviewable at all, whether it's for removal or anything else... once that certification is filed?"
1994.94-167,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1143.179,1143.528,--Well--
1994.94-167,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1143.528,1157.018,And of course I assume that the United States administratively could nevertheless allow the claim in this case even though the United States itself wouldn't be liable.
1994.94-167,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1157.018,1158.08,--It certainly--
1994.94-167,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1158.08,1158.447,Couldn't it?
1994.94-167,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1158.447,1167.613,"--In this case there is, 21 U.S.C. 904, the administrative claim procedure to which Mr. Rodriguez referred... doesn't apply across the board."
1994.94-167,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1176.98,1177.23,Yes.
1994.94-167,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1180.522,1180.993,That's correct.
1994.94-167,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1180.993,1182.173,Yes.
1994.94-167,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1193.83,1194.972,It's--
1994.94-167,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1194.972,1197.073,Why don't you protect defendants from you?
1994.94-167,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1197.073,1204.558,--There is certainly something unusual about the Department of Justice affirmatively asserting the position that one of its acts is judicially reviewable.
1994.94-167,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1238.671,1248.497,"Well, it's also true, isn't it, that the statute does provide that the defendant can get protected from you by appealing an adverse... a refusal to certify?"
1994.94-167,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1248.497,1249.058,--That's correct.
1994.94-167,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1257.473,1262.435,"I should have said it's the plaintiffs that... that have to be protected from you, right, not the defendants."
1994.94-167,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1266.199,1267.408,That's correct.
1994.94-167,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1281.369,1283.068,"Well, let... let me ask you this."
1994.94-167,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1298.7,1306.314,--That... that has sometimes been the base... basis of the scope certification; that a tort was alleged to have occurred.
1994.94-167,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1318.633,1321.484,"So, what kind of a certification is entered then?"
1994.94-167,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1328.429,1332.543,"--Well, typically, the certification itself would be a fairly sparse document."
1994.94-167,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1372.448,1379.733,"But isn't it correct that in Justice O'Connor's hypothetical you would have the case removed, and then you would file an answer denying your liability?"
1994.94-167,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1393.823,1394.183,--That's correct.
1994.94-167,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1400.957,1401.357,"Oh, I understand."
1994.94-167,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1401.357,1403.728,--The plaintiff could seek a judicial review of that... that process.
1994.94-167,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1405.951,1408.441,Why would the plaintiff seek judicial review?
1994.94-167,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1423.562,1424.113,--That's correct.
1994.94-167,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1439.301,1440.133,"Well, I... I take--"
1994.94-167,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1465.219,1469.661,I... I don't know the answer to that either in gross terms or... or percentage terms.
1994.94-167,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1491.025,1496.419,"Mr. Steward, I... I must... I'm really impressed with the generosity of the Government's position in this case."
1994.94-167,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1528.31,1530.931,I... I guess I'd have... I guess I'd have three responses to that.
1994.94-167,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1555.768,1564.053,"I can see the Attorney General coming in and saying, DEA agents, you don't know, Your Honor, what the DEA agent is like."
1994.94-167,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1579.413,1589.171,"Well, clearly there are some... some cases at the margins in which normal scope of employment principles will be more difficult to apply to a particular Government employee."
1994.94-167,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1601.299,1607.113,"Well, you don't think the language is somehow inadequate, do you, when it says ""shall be substituted""?"
1994.94-167,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1607.113,1609.494,"Well, the... I think the proper--"
1994.94-167,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1609.494,1611.644,"Do they have to say ""and we really mean it"" or what?"
1994.94-167,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1613.326,1613.885,"--Well, I... two questions."
1994.94-167,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1662.648,1665.059,Why require the determination to be made at all then?
1994.94-167,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1676.777,1690.247,"Well, as Justice Ginsburg quest... Ginsburg's question points out, without knowing the... the percentages, there will certainly be a large number of cases in which the certification will not be challenged, because it's not in the plaintiff's interest to challenge it... in the plaintiff's interest to sue the United States."
1994.94-167,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1695.881,1705.685,"Well, aren't there instances in which in State courts there is a pleading of malice or assault and battery, and there's an attempt to get a jury trial in the State court?"
1994.94-167,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1705.685,1706.977,--That's correct.
1994.94-167,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1722.627,1733.384,"Do... do you, in any event, share the Petitioners' view that there are some constitutional concerns if, say, a State cause of action in... before a jury trial, was foreclosed by reason of the certification that's non-reviewable?"
1994.94-167,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1733.384,1734.005,"--No, we don't."
1994.94-167,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1734.005,1736.416,"Thank you, Mr. Stewart."
1994.94-167,2,16490,andrew_j_maloney_iii,,1738.857,1745.062,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1994.94-167,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1763.624,1765.725,"And where are you reading from, so that we might follow you?"
1994.94-167,2,16490,andrew_j_maloney_iii,,1765.725,1767.705,"Well, on page 9 of Respondent's brief."
1994.94-167,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1767.705,1768.426,Thank you.
1994.94-167,2,16490,andrew_j_maloney_iii,,1768.426,1787.62,"""Should a United States district court determine on a hearing on a motion to remand held before a trial on the merits that the case so removed is one in which a remedy by suit within the meaning of subsection (b) of this section is not available against the United States, the case shall be remanded to State court. """
1994.94-167,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1805.522,1810.785,"But now 2679 (d) just talks about on a motion to remand, doesn't it?"
1994.94-167,2,16490,andrew_j_maloney_iii,,1810.785,1812.795,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1994.94-167,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1818.279,1818.96,Yes.
1994.94-167,2,16490,andrew_j_maloney_iii,,1831.549,1834.25,"That's correct, Mr. Chief Justice."
1994.94-167,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1871.455,1874.638,May I go back to the provision you quote earlier?
1994.94-167,2,16490,andrew_j_maloney_iii,,1895.539,1897.161,"Well, that's... that's correct, Your Honor."
1994.94-167,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1906.348,1913.284,"Yes, but when the United States cannot be held accountable, then the individual remains accountable, even though he was acting in the scope of his employment."
1994.94-167,2,16490,andrew_j_maloney_iii,,1913.284,1916.353,"Well, I don't believe that's correct, Justice Stevens."
1994.94-167,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1935.336,1939.48,You... you mean you can't name the employee as a... as a second party?
1994.94-167,2,16490,andrew_j_maloney_iii,,1939.48,1941.12,"--Well, you can name him--"
1994.94-167,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1941.12,1947.795,"Suppose the allegation is the employee acted... it was an assault and battery or acted with malice, I assume that's beyond recovery under the Federal Tort Claims Act?"

1994.94-167,2,16490,andrew_j_maloney_iii,,2001.079,2001.89,"That... that's correct, Justice Ginsburg."
1994.94-167,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2002.209,2002.509,--Yes.
1994.94-167,2,16490,andrew_j_maloney_iii,,2017.008,2017.519,--That's correct.
1994.94-167,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2093.628,2094.248,"Well, let me ask you this."
1994.94-167,2,16490,andrew_j_maloney_iii,,2119.207,2120.926,That's correct.
1994.94-167,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2123.899,2125.311,"Which is kind of curious, isn't it?"
1994.94-167,2,16490,andrew_j_maloney_iii,,2125.311,2128.393,"Well, it's... it's... it's not for me to speculate."
1994.94-167,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2153.9,2158.451,"Well, there's no doubt that Congress did just that with respect to removal at least."
1994.94-167,2,16490,andrew_j_maloney_iii,,2170.679,2190.715,"Well, Justice Scalia, the... the language in (d)(2)... (d)(1), does not undermine the clear and plain language in the (d)(1) clause, which says that upon certification by the Attorney General, this shall be deemed an action against the United States,"
1994.94-167,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2193.744,2210.686,"So once the United States is substituted, even if it's determined that it comes within an exception to the Tort Claims Act, why isn't it just like you have an ordinary diversity suit, and the defendant, two days after the complaint is filed, moves to the same State as plaintiff, so you have no more diversity?"
1994.94-167,2,16490,andrew_j_maloney_iii,,2215.318,2216.149,No.
1994.94-167,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2219.072,2223.363,So then you... then you have Federal courts trying a case between two people of the same citizenship.
1994.94-167,2,16490,andrew_j_maloney_iii,,2244.056,2246.429,"--Well, that wouldn't be different."
1994.94-167,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2257.526,2259.327,But the diversity has in fact ended.
1994.94-167,2,16490,andrew_j_maloney_iii,,2267.982,2269.324,That's correct.
1994.94-167,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2278.931,2296.823,"But that once existed, just as diversity once existed in my other case, so once Federal jurisdiction having latched on, the court can continue to hear the case, even if the basis for Federal jurisdiction terminates after the proceeding begins?"
1994.94-167,2,16490,andrew_j_maloney_iii,,2296.823,2299.515,"--Well, that's correct, under appendant jurisdiction, a district judge--"
1994.94-167,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2299.515,2301.695,You wouldn't acknowledge that it once existed?
1994.94-167,2,16490,andrew_j_maloney_iii,,2331.094,2332.865,"--That... that is absolutely correct, Justice Scalia."
1994.94-167,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2337.629,2338.828,"Thank you, Mr. Maloney."
1994.94-167,3,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,2340.671,2347.444,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1994.94-167,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2412.048,2412.577,You mean the defendant?
1994.94-167,3,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,2412.577,2413.919,"No, the plaintiff."
1994.94-167,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2419.252,2425.996,Is it not correct that in that case he can get the... a State judge to review the United States Attorney General's refusal to certify?
1994.94-167,3,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,2425.996,2426.697,--No.
1994.94-167,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2431.04,2434.893,"No, I'm thinking in cases in which the United States refused to certify... the (d)(3) situation."
1994.94-167,3,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,2434.893,2435.293,That's correct.
1994.94-167,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2476.18,2480.601,"Or you'd say you don't really get down to the... to the implications when you have a ""shall""?"
1994.94-167,3,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,2480.601,2481.523,--Exactly.
1994.94-167,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2486.496,2492.309,"Or that each side has an expressio unius argument going for it, so it cancels out?"
1994.94-167,3,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,2492.309,2498.603,"They cancel out, and we're left with the plain language that says ""shall"", and mandates this result by the district court."
1994.94-167,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2500.786,2502.967,But I don't quite understand why that plain language carries you that far.
1994.94-167,3,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,2510.3,2512.734,"--It says there shall be substitution, period."
1994.94-167,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2512.734,2513.703,"All right, that there's substitution."
1994.94-167,3,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,2513.703,2517.226,"Now, I don't think you can go on and say, well, okay, but the district court could resubstitute."
1994.94-167,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2517.226,2517.487,Why can't you?
1994.94-167,3,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,2527.821,2533.345,"Well, if you look at an analogous statute... let's say 24(a) of the Federal--"
1994.94-167,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2533.345,2536.828,"Yes, but if you have to get outside this statute, then it isn't quite as plain as you were representing it to--"
1994.94-167,3,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,2536.828,2538.74,"--No, I think... I think it is quite plain."
1994.94-167,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2563.466,2563.776,--Correct.
1994.94-167,3,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,2563.776,2564.337,Now get out.
1994.94-167,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2564.337,2568.941,"But that is always subject to review by the court of appeals and said, well, we took a second look at it and say they weren't... those criteria--"
1994.94-167,3,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,2568.941,2570.18,But those criteria were not met.
1994.94-167,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2570.18,2570.761,--Right.
1994.94-167,3,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,2570.761,2576.055,But the criteria in the statute are the only criteria that the court is charged with determining.
1994.94-167,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2576.055,2576.345,Right.
1994.94-167,3,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,2576.345,2578.295,That's why they call it intervention as a right.
1994.94-167,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2578.295,2578.766,The same thing here.
1994.94-167,3,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,2580.058,2581.778,"No, that is not what the statute says."
1994.94-167,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2586.422,2588.833,"Well, certainly the Attorney General doesn't have the authority to certify if the man was not in the scope of his employment?"
1994.94-167,3,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,2588.833,2594.367,The Attorney General is charged with determining whether he's within the scope of employment.
1994.94-167,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2594.367,2594.858,Right.
1994.94-167,3,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,2594.858,2595.098,That is correct.
1994.94-167,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2595.098,2597.86,"And it's... and it is reviewable in some situations, you admit?"
1994.94-167,3,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,2597.86,2600.522,At the behest of the defendant.
1994.94-167,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2600.522,2600.842,Right.
1994.94-167,3,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,2600.842,2602.615,And the reason for that is that--
1994.94-167,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2602.615,2603.135,By statute?
1994.94-167,3,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,2603.135,2604.155,--By statute.
1994.94-167,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2604.155,2604.676,Right.
1994.94-167,3,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,2604.676,2614.723,"In the ordinary course of events, of course, the admission of the Attorney General that the employee acted within the scope of the employment is going to be contrary to the interest of the United States."
1994.94-167,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2614.723,2615.174,But--
1994.94-167,3,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,2615.174,2621.067,And there was needed to be some mechanism which the defendant employee could challenge that certification.
1994.94-167,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2621.067,2625.989,"--Yes, but can you go back for a minute, which I... I thank you very much for your brief, by the way, which was very helpful."
1994.94-167,3,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,2648.243,2648.544,That's correct.
1994.94-167,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2648.544,2649.645,"And said, well, sometimes you can."
1994.94-167,3,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,2705.804,2706.793,There is two reasons.
1994.94-167,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2719.813,2742.206,"The policy purposes of having the Attorney General decide whether an assault and battery took place, the policy and purposes for having the Attorney General decide the facts of the case, to decide... the Attorney General should decide if the action is taken away from the plaintiff rather than a judge and a jury... or at least a judge?"
1994.94-167,3,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,2742.206,2756.776,--The policy purpose is to allow the Attorney General to articulate the circumstances under which the United States is prepared to take responsibility for the action of its employee as taken within the scope of employment.
1994.94-167,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2763.321,2773.428,"Immunity always is decided after an initial determination, say, by an agency or someone, by the judge or the jury or both."
1994.94-167,3,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,2773.428,2775.039,--Immunity--
1994.94-167,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2775.039,2790.279,"Is there something in the legislative history that says that Congress wanted not only to restore scope of immunity... scope of employment immunity, but also to take the plaintiff's right to have review of that question by a judge and hand it to one of the parties in the case?"
1994.94-167,3,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,2790.279,2794.563,--It's... it's not handing it to one of the parties.
1994.94-167,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2802.387,2804.698,"But in this case, to be the judge of her own case."
1994.94-167,3,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,2807.509,2808.251,"--No, it's--"
1994.94-167,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2808.251,2811.774,"Here if there is a certification, everybody is off the hook."
1994.94-167,3,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,2827.123,2828.063,--That is correct.
1994.94-167,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2828.063,2831.696,"It is the Attorney General being judge in her cause, in that sense, is it not?"
1994.94-167,3,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,2831.696,2835.238,"Not... not in her own cause of action, but in the cause of action of her employee."
1994.94-167,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2837.109,2837.59,And... and of the Government?
1994.94-167,3,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,2837.59,2848.176,"--In the vast bulk of cases, as you yourself pointed out, the admission of the Attorney General that the employee was acting within the scope of employment will be essentially against interest."
1994.94-167,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2861.615,2863.135,I'm not sure that's correct to say that it's against the Government's interest.
1994.94-167,3,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,2876.746,2878.997,"--No, that's the whole point of immunity, of course."
1994.94-167,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2888.273,2891.586,Or they're willing to have the Federal Government pick up the tab on the liability... is what they're--
1994.94-167,3,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,2891.586,2893.215,"--That's correct, they... they are."
1994.94-167,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2894.966,2897.888,--If that's in the overall best interest of the work force and the United States.
1994.94-167,3,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,2897.888,2898.349,--That's correct.
1994.94-167,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2898.349,2902.912,"Mr. Kellogg, could you say something about the... the due process argument?"
1994.94-167,3,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,2915.431,2916.261,"No, I don't think so."
1994.94-167,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2920.383,2920.914,Is there--
1994.94-167,3,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,2920.914,2923.747,The statute was passed before the acts in question occurred.
1994.94-167,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2933.982,2935.765,"--Well, the greater doesn't always include the lesser."
1994.94-167,3,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,2945.929,2951.253,--I... I see no problem with that.
1994.94-167,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2951.253,2951.834,--What about a--
1994.94-167,3,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,2951.834,2958.289,And I certainly have not seen any cases cited by the Petitioner in this case that would indicate that that was a problem.
1994.94-167,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2958.289,2960.67,"--May I ask one question about the word ""shall""... great emphasis on it?"
1994.94-167,3,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,2974.838,2977.65,"No, I don't believe that's correct."
1994.94-167,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2981.793,2984.284,"So the point is that the ""shalls"" don't resolve the question of judicial review."
1994.94-167,3,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,2998.246,2999.204,--That's correct.
1994.94-167,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2999.204,2999.805,I mean you--
1994.94-167,3,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,3078.057,3080.837,"I don't believe so, Justice... Justice Breyer."
1994.94-167,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3116.361,3122.695,The reason being that the admission was adverse to the dec... declarant's interest.
1994.94-167,3,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,3122.695,3123.827,--That's correct.
1994.94-167,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3123.827,3132.032,"But here... but here, the... the admission is taken as defeating a cause of action, say, in a State court with a jury trial for a malicious act."
1994.94-167,3,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,3132.032,3141.218,"That is precisely what this Court, in United States v. Smith acknowledged was the result of the Westfall Act, and the intent of Congress."
1994.94-167,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3152.895,3156.738,"Well, that's... but there was a judicial determination there of the fact of immunity."
1994.94-167,3,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,3159.399,3162.162,"No, there was no judicial determination--"
1994.94-167,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3162.162,3165.174,The judicial... the determination here is a unilateral determination by the... by the executive.
1994.94-167,3,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,3165.174,3168.225,--There was no determination in Smith.
1994.94-167,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3179.523,3181.276,But there was no... there was no issue about the certification.
1994.94-167,3,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,3183.136,3183.365,--That's correct.
1994.94-167,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3186.668,3189.78,"Nobody said that he acted outside the scope of his employment, as I understand it?"
1994.94-167,3,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,3189.78,3190.401,--That's correct.
1994.94-167,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3203.148,3208.492,"Do you think a certification is reviewable somehow under the Administrative Procedure Act, the final Agency action?"
1994.94-167,3,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,3208.492,3219.941,"I... I don't think so, Justice Scalia, because this statute really sort of occupies the field, and sets up its own standards for how the determination is made."
1994.94-167,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3226.703,3231.598,"What are the standards... you said... you just used the words, set up standards for how the determination is made."
1994.94-167,3,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,3238.09,3240.554,I was unable to find any.
1994.94-167,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3244.726,3250.83,"So we don't even know if there's any uniformity in the way these certifications are being handed out, do we?"
1994.94-167,3,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,3250.83,3251.891,That's correct.
1994.94-167,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3285.311,3320.794,"Is it not conceivable that apart from this procedure, apart from challenging it when... when the... when the certification is made to... to the court that has the tort action, might there not be an action against the... let's suppose an Attorney General who is... or a U.S. Attorney who is making these certifications just randomly, just in order to help both the employee at no expense to the Government, without any investigation whatever... is there a possibility of a separate action under the Administrative Procedure Act to get that... to get that decision overturned?"
1994.94-167,3,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,3320.794,3321.034,"Well, I think--"
1994.94-167,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3321.034,3322.186,You'd have a different standard to review.
1994.94-167,3,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,3329.693,3330.501,--I think--
1994.94-167,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3330.501,3333.703,Which would be quite different from what... what... what is... what is asked for here.
1994.94-167,3,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,3333.703,3334.224,--True.
1994.94-167,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3363.503,3371.498,"If it's not... if it's not reviewable by the court, how does the court get into it at all for purposes of Rule 11 sanctions?"
1994.94-167,3,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,3371.498,3381.876,"--Well, in... in many instances, you'll find where a particular side wins the argument, but still could be subject to Rule 11 sanctions for misrepresenting some aspect."
1994.94-167,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3430.626,3436.071,"I thought the United States ""shall be substituted""... so why isn't it a case against the United States?"
1994.94-167,3,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,3436.071,3442.514,"It does say, ""shall be substituted"", but if it's subject to review by the district court, then--"
1994.94-167,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3442.514,3443.635,I didn't understand you either.
1994.94-167,3,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,3447.028,3447.418,--Right.
1994.94-167,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3447.418,3449.53,--You don't know it's the United States when you get to court?
1994.94-167,3,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,3449.53,3450.081,Right.
1994.94-167,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3450.081,3451.59,"But on the basis of your case, you do know?"
1994.94-167,3,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,3451.59,3452.301,You do know.
1994.94-167,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3471.342,3473.805,Why is it any different from pendant jurisdiction?
1994.94-167,3,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,3473.805,3477.737,--Pendant jurisdiction involves two claims generally.
1994.94-167,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3478.147,3480.448,"Yes, but here they came into Federal court on a good basis."
1994.94-167,3,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,3492.888,3499.502,"--Because I don't think it makes sense to say it came in on a good basis if it's the district court that makes the determination, not the Attorney General."
1994.94-167,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3499.502,3501.352,"Thank you, Mr. Kellogg."
