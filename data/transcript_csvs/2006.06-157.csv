2006.06-157,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.654,"We will hear argument this morning in case 06-157, Hein versus Freedom From Religion Foundation."
2006.06-157,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,9.012,12.589,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2006.06-157,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,105.474,144.287,"If I understand your position correctly, if Congress enacts a program that favors religion over non-religion, which is supposedly what the establishment clause prohibits, that's bad; but if Congress enacts a perfectly valid general program and the President implements it in a fashion that favors religion over non-religion, that's okay, insofar as the ability of anybody to challenge it is concerned."
2006.06-157,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,146.928,149.285,"Well, I don't think so, Justice Scalia."
2006.06-157,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,149.895,150.239,Why not?
2006.06-157,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,150.239,152.722,"--I mean, I think that may be sort of over inclusive and under inclusive."
2006.06-157,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,152.722,153.143,Okay.
2006.06-157,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,153.143,158.595,"Which is to say, it's not a congressional program, it's a congressional spending statute that is the key predicate."
2006.06-157,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,171.417,182.851,"If this... if Congress had enacted this executive order that's in question here, if it had been congressional legislation, would there be standing?"
2006.06-157,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,182.851,186.38,"I don't think so, Justice Ginsburg, but let me just be clear."
2006.06-157,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,204.092,208.683,"I had the same question as Justice Ginsburg, and I think was also suggested by Justice Scalia's question."
2006.06-157,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,222.006,225.27,"--I don't think so, Justice Kennedy, because I look at this Court's--"
2006.06-157,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,225.27,233.002,"But... and I of course want the answer, but then, why is that consistent with what you told us at the beginning that there had to be a statute?"
2006.06-157,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,233.002,235.875,--Because there has to be two things.
2006.06-157,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,265.332,284.934,"So you're saying if the Government, the executive, or the Congress, if the congressional statute authorizes the giving of money for the billing of a church, that's bad; but if it authorizes... it makes a general authorization to the President... no."
2006.06-157,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,294.477,297.881,"--Well, importantly, Justice Scalia, it's not a matter of it being okay."
2006.06-157,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,299.974,301.161,"Well, as far as standing is concerned."
2006.06-157,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,301.161,303.286,"--Yeah, it logically gives rise to taxpayer standing."
2006.06-157,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,303.926,304.879,What is your answer to that?
2006.06-157,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,312.08,314.891,--What I would say is in either case it's bad.
2006.06-157,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,323.575,326.183,There is no standing for the internal Government church?
2006.06-157,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,326.183,327.556,Not taxpayer standing.
2006.06-157,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,332.196,336.053,"No, we're not forcing anybody in at gunpoint."
2006.06-157,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,338.897,348.361,"--With respect, Justice Scalia, nobody forced Van Orden to walk by the Ten Commandments display in Texas at gunpoint, and yet this Court said that he could bring an establishment clause challenge."
2006.06-157,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,354.187,355.515,But we're talking taxpayer standing.
2006.06-157,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,375.068,382.144,--I think there's a difference in the extent to which there is a conceptually direct injury for the taxpayer as taxpayer.
2006.06-157,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,385.174,391.547,"In both cases money is being used for a purpose that is contrary to the establishment clause, according to the taxpayer."
2006.06-157,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,391.547,399.809,"But with respect, in the context of the internal Government church, the fact that money is being spent to establish that church is the--"
2006.06-157,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,399.809,400.731,Taxpayer money.
2006.06-157,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,400.731,401.418,--least of your concerns.
2006.06-157,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,405.432,408.275,"I don't care whether it's the least of the concerns, it's a concern."
2006.06-157,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,425.674,446.244,"Well, Justice Scalia, I think it's a difference suggested by this Court's cases, and they do make an important distinction between the distribution of money outside the Government where the spending itself is the injury and what this Court has termed the incidental expenditure of money in the context of an executive branch activity that itself is alleged to violate the establishment clause."
2006.06-157,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,446.244,457.505,"And why should that make any difference if the entire theory behind it is sort of a Madisonian theory, if not threepence from the pocket for a religious purpose?"
2006.06-157,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,463.846,470.937,"I'm not quite sure that's right, Justice Souter, because I think that there's really two ways the Government can establish religion."
2006.06-157,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,479.995,484.915,"No, but let's talk about establishing... maybe this is what you're going to do, establishing religion by spending the threepence."
2006.06-157,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,484.915,486.008,--Exactly.
2006.06-157,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,487.508,503.003,"And in this case, when you build the church, you're spending the threepence whether... whether a... a Government employee is laying the bricks or a contract... an outside contractor is laying the bricks or a third party institution to which a grant has been made is laying the bricks."
2006.06-157,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,504.611,509.859,--With respect in the one respect it is the three pence itself that is the establishment violation.
2006.06-157,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,514.169,523.477,"Taking the money out of the pocket and using it for a particular purpose, and the money comes out of the pocket in each case."
2006.06-157,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,525.368,536.238,"--Again, I would take issue with that and say the primary concern that Madison was focused on was the taking of the money and then giving it to the outside religious entity."
2006.06-157,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,536.238,547.234,"Would... you've covered the case where the Government itself, the executive is the actor and said that's not covered by Flast."
2006.06-157,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,570.459,574.286,I think it might depend on the nature of the claim actually.
2006.06-157,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,575.597,593.996,"This claim, these conferences are run now instead of within the executive branch by various agencies, they are run by contractors, specialists in conferences that have been engaged by the executive to help people make grant applications."
2006.06-157,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,593.996,604.695,"--But I think the better view, is the challenge is exactly this one, which is not that there's something wrong with the recipient, but that there's something wrong with what goes on at these conferences."
2006.06-157,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,607.679,610.224,That's... that's a question on the merits.
2006.06-157,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,651.27,656.659,"--Again, I think if I understand the question, I would say that there's no taxpayer standing there."
2006.06-157,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,695.925,715.714,"There wouldn't be tax... taxpayer standing, but of course there would be regular Article III standing in the sense that in a party claiming to be injured because they didn't get a grant, and a religious organization did, and the reason was religion, can bring any kind of claim they want under Article III."
2006.06-157,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,722.961,723.226,That's exactly right.
2006.06-157,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,737.517,739.845,"--just one, one more question on this, on this line."
2006.06-157,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,758.526,761.508,--I think there would be taxpayer standing if I understand that.
2006.06-157,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,786.015,799.291,"But not... but not if the President just gives the money out of a general appropriation, authorizing him to give money to people who are helping in the programs that the Faith-Based Initiative was... was designed to help?"
2006.06-157,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,799.291,799.978,Well--
2006.06-157,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,799.978,802.147,"If the President hands over the money, that's okay?"
2006.06-157,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,802.147,806.193,"--Not necessarily, Justice Scalia, but it's important to focus on what this case is about."
2006.06-157,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,806.193,807.068,"Why, why not necessarily?"
2006.06-157,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,812.3,812.644,Right.
2006.06-157,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,817.032,820.172,"He's getting the money from Congress under a general, under a general appropriation."
2006.06-157,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,825.685,827.154,--He--
2006.06-157,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,827.154,828.638,"As far as standing is concerned, he can't be sued?"
2006.06-157,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,828.638,840.304,"--If he, if he's taking it from a general appropriation that makes no indication it's to go outside the Government so one could not in any way articulate that as an as-applied challenge to the appropriations, then I suppose that there would not be standing."
2006.06-157,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,841.022,841.476,I don't understand.
2006.06-157,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,883.475,886.504,--I would say that that's a much harder case than this--
2006.06-157,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,886.504,886.833,"Yes, but--"
2006.06-157,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,886.833,887.583,--but I say no.
2006.06-157,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,888.097,888.472,--Why not?
2006.06-157,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,891.736,892.455,No.
2006.06-157,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,915.009,917.664,Then you go to a private group?
2006.06-157,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,917.664,918.164,--Right.
2006.06-157,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,919.492,927.988,"So you're saying that if the Government has the most amazing, let's... I'm trying to think of something more amazing that what I just thought of."
2006.06-157,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,952.946,954.665,--Horrible hypothetical.
2006.06-157,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,954.665,956.133,"Is that what you're saying, then?"
2006.06-157,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,956.133,960.116,"I mean, I think the bottom line is that there would not be taxpayer standing."
2006.06-157,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,962.224,963.38,"I don't know, I mean--"
2006.06-157,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,963.38,963.677,Probably--
2006.06-157,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,963.677,965.644,--everybody else who doesn't want to go just avoids it.
2006.06-157,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,968.237,978.827,"Any, presumably any other denomination that is not of the established church could bring a challenge that they're being discriminated against, because they're favoring a particular church over them."
2006.06-157,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,988.541,990.682,"--Exactly, and not just the person in Oregon."
2006.06-157,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,998.694,999.194,--Who?
2006.06-157,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1000.365,1006.518,--As... as the Chief Justice suggested I think anybody from a different denomination that said that this was discriminatory probably could bring a claim.
2006.06-157,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1012.453,1015.749,"Maybe they don't walk into it because it is not ""our church""."
2006.06-157,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1017.264,1017.857,"--Well, we--"
2006.06-157,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1017.857,1021.716,"And moreover, they don't... they don't feel it's discriminatory."
2006.06-157,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1028.213,1043.083,"--With respect... with respect, Justice Breyer, I think you're underestimating the ingenuity of plaintiffs to think that somebody that walked by going to Plymouth Rock okay thinking I was going to see a nice historical exhibit, and is and to see a church, wouldn't bring a... an action."
2006.06-157,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1047.47,1052.172,"General Clement, are you... are arguing that these lines that you're drawing make a lot of sense in an abstract sense?"
2006.06-157,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1059.481,1061.808,"--The latter, Justice Alito."
2006.06-157,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1064.48,1069.196,Why didn't you say so?
2006.06-157,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1070.087,1072.289,"Well, and I've been trying to make sense out of this Court's precedents."
2006.06-157,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1077.49,1080.395,Do we think have a duty to follow precedents that don't make any sense?
2006.06-157,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1080.395,1084.144,"--Well, I think... as a matter of first course, the Court tries."
2006.06-157,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1103.276,1109.399,"The difference was that it was because it was under the property clause, and made a distinction between property and money."
2006.06-157,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1109.399,1110.321,"--Well, Justice--"
2006.06-157,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1110.321,1112.335,"We are talking about money, not property?"
2006.06-157,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1112.335,1119.145,"--But Justice Ginsburg, in fairness, the Court could not have been more clear in Valley Forge that there were two reasons that there weren't taxpayer standing there."
2006.06-157,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1161.597,1162.144,Was it just--
2006.06-157,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1162.144,1163.658,--That mean that it's Executive Branch action?
2006.06-157,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1163.658,1172.185,"--Was it just a ministerial act or did the Executive have discretion involved, about who would receive the grant?"
2006.06-157,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1172.185,1174.545,"Well, Justice Ginsburg, two things."
2006.06-157,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1229.866,1245.124,"But you can reconcile Valley Forge simply by saying when it's money from the Federal Treasury, whether it is a general appropriation or a specific appropriation, it is money from the Treasury, and that's what Flast is about."
2006.06-157,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1263.945,1269.241,"Well, Justice Ginsburg, it is certainly not the line I would draw from reading these cases side by side and together."
2006.06-157,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1269.241,1287.42,"Or to, or to put it another way, to put Justice Ginsburg's point another way, every Executive action that involves the expenditure of congressionally authorized funds is an as-applied challenge to an expenditure statute."
2006.06-157,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1305.194,1311.067,"Justice Scalia, I would have said that no one would have conceptualized that as an as-applied challenge to a general appropriation statute."
2006.06-157,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1312.629,1313.098,It's a--
2006.06-157,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1313.098,1316.16,"--Even, even if you would do that in another case, I don't see how you could do it in this case."
2006.06-157,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1325.717,1328.841,--That's the essence of an as-applied challenge.
2006.06-157,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1344.257,1350.832,"--With respect, Justice Scalia, I've never heard of an as-applied challenge to a statute that doesn't identity that's unconstitutional as applied."
2006.06-157,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1352.362,1365.077,"Under that, under that approach, when a U.S. Marshal executes a search and there's a Fourth Amendment claim that the search is illegal, that's really a challenge to the appropriation of the Marshals Service on an as-applied basis."
2006.06-157,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1365.077,1367.388,"--That's exactly right, Mr. Chief Justice."
2006.06-157,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1377.932,1392.659,"So what's wrong with just saying that Flast stands for the proposition that when the Government spends money in violation of the establishment clause, a taxpayer... after all, the money comes from the taxpayer... can bring a lawsuit?"
2006.06-157,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1424.021,1426.021,Can I just add this thought before you answer.
2006.06-157,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1429.739,1431.565,Absolutely.
2006.06-157,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1448.762,1463.287,"--Because there is a real case or controversy, because people become terribly upset when they see some other religion getting the money from the State for the... for building a church, for example, and that's why: There's a real controversy."
2006.06-157,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1463.287,1468.722,Getting upset is a constitutionally adequate reason to bring a lawsuit?
2006.06-157,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1479.859,1486.919,"--I suppose under that theory, and obviously the plaintiffs in Richardson and Schlesinger were very upset as well, and the Court said that--"
2006.06-157,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1486.919,1503.286,It is the kind of upset that is a genuine injury if you look to the objectives of the establishment clause and possibly that kind of genuine injury is not the case when you look to objectives of various other clauses of the Constitution.
2006.06-157,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1503.286,1505.956,"--Justice Breyer, let me try to answer in two ways if I can."
2006.06-157,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1517.53,1518.514,That's what I was saying.
2006.06-157,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1529.496,1530.229,"Well, again, but he--"
2006.06-157,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1530.229,1530.713,Based on money.
2006.06-157,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1530.713,1541.707,"--But again, he didn't say just spending of money to do the Executive Branch's everyday operations and maybe... and one day they go a little too far in praising religion."
2006.06-157,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1590.626,1599.42,You're talking about an incidental expenditure as part of a regulatory program is quite different from looking at a discrete program.
2006.06-157,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1618.114,1624.096,"But Justice Ginsburg, their challenge is not that the money that's spent on conferences can't be spent on conferences."
2006.06-157,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1634.358,1635.841,"Thank you, General Clement."
2006.06-157,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1637.498,1659.878,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Government's argument here is that Flast needs major surgery and, as the discussion I think in the first part of the argument shows, it's proposing two very substantial limitations that bear no relation to the relevant establishment clause principles, the history of the clause, or the history of this Court's decisions."
2006.06-157,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1694.146,1695.817,"Well, that's... I guess that's my first question."
2006.06-157,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1715.919,1722.338,"--Well, I don't... I don't think that lawsuit could be brought, Mr. Chief Justice, and let me explain why."
2006.06-157,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1735.457,1737.284,It's very... I can identify it.
2006.06-157,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1742.548,1749.03,"--But, Your Honor, those appropriations don't do the trick, and maybe I can just explain our test and explain why."
2006.06-157,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1776.972,1777.846,"Well, Mr. Pincus--"
2006.06-157,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1777.846,1779.706,--that there was a tie between... I'm sorry.
2006.06-157,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1779.706,1793.325,"--there have been Federal spending programs declared unconstitutional under the establishment clause, and can you cite any instance in which such a holding ing has caused a reduction in tax rates?"
2006.06-157,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1793.325,1805.414,"No, and this Court has said and the lower courts have said that that is not the requirement, because the injury here that the taxpayer complains of, as the Court said in Daimler Chrysler, is not an increased tax burden."
2006.06-157,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1810.63,1813.285,"See, your traceability either covers every case or it covers no case."
2006.06-157,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1833.73,1837.635,"Well, respectfully, Your Honor, that's not what the Court said in Doremus in describing Everson."
2006.06-157,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1845.819,1847.725,Let me give you something more measurable.
2006.06-157,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1881.055,1887.724,"I don't think so, because, as the court of appeals said, that this Court has identified a second limitation, which is not incidental."
2006.06-157,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1894.924,1895.487,"--Well, I don't understand."
2006.06-157,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1897.188,1900.375,--The money has to be central to the violation.
2006.06-157,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1900.375,1902.453,"You mean Congress has to, has to say that--"
2006.06-157,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1902.453,1902.64,No.
2006.06-157,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1916.681,1917.228,"--Well, what about Bowen?"
2006.06-157,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1919.946,1921.116,"I'm sorry, Justice Scalia?"
2006.06-157,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1921.116,1934.111,"It was, you know, a pregnancy program and the executive added to it certain, certain restrictions that were challenged as being religiously based."
2006.06-157,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1934.111,1934.767,But the--
2006.06-157,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1934.767,1937.204,And we allowed an as-applied challenge.
2006.06-157,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1937.204,1940.297,"--You did, an as-replied challenge to the specific grants."
2006.06-157,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1944.842,1946.575,But this is a specific grant.
2006.06-157,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1960.18,1970.222,"--Yes, Your Honor, but the money that's identified in the budget is not... well, it's not the entire Air Force one appropriation that would be challenged in the kind of claim you're talking about."
2006.06-157,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1970.222,1971.472,It wasn't in Bowen either.
2006.06-157,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1971.472,1978.796,But it was a specific... there was a specific action that allocated a specific amount of money to those grantees.
2006.06-157,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1999.631,2008.098,"I really don't think... there's an identified sum of money that goes to pay the costs of Air Force One, too, to buy the gas and everything else."
2006.06-157,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2016.89,2021.67,"Well, Your Honor, I think, I think, as I say, there are two tests."
2006.06-157,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2042.677,2046.238,Take Justice Breyer's Pilgrim church.
2006.06-157,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2062.591,2066.121,--If the Government then singled out some of that money--
2006.06-157,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2066.121,2067.855,The Government singles it out.
2006.06-157,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2073.367,2073.899,--Yes.
2006.06-157,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2074.835,2078.476,"How do they... in other words, if they spend the money are they singling it out?"
2006.06-157,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2088.331,2093.705,"--Well, I don't think the singling out... I don't think whether it's discrete and identifiable depends on the amount, Your Honor."
2006.06-157,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2114.383,2117.632,"Well, it doesn't have to be a grant, just that you can say it costs so much money."
2006.06-157,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2117.632,2118.085,--Or a contract.
2006.06-157,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2118.085,2118.538,Yes.
2006.06-157,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2118.538,2121.1,"If the Government let the contract for the building of the church, yes."
2006.06-157,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2121.1,2126.629,"Or the contract hiring the security guards who protect the President, right?"
2006.06-157,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2128.393,2129.955,"Well, they are, and that--"
2006.06-157,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2129.955,2132.58,And they're protecting him for a religious purpose.
2006.06-157,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2134.312,2136.406,"--Well, they're protecting him for a protection purpose."
2006.06-157,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2142.823,2150.134,--This is money that is expended in order to enable the President to do something for a religious purpose.
2006.06-157,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2154.555,2165.801,"But... but, as with buying the bagels at a prayer breakfast, the cost of the bagels, like the cost of the security, is not... is not paying for the center of what the violation is."
2006.06-157,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2172.812,2175.546,"It wasn't, it wasn't the center in Bowen either."
2006.06-157,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2193.632,2202.816,But their claim was that the spending of this entire grant is unconstitutional because of the way the money is going to be used by the grantees.
2006.06-157,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2215.593,2215.999,I see.
2006.06-157,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2234.959,2236.709,"Yes, and we think--"
2006.06-157,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2236.709,2238.067,And that makes a lot of sense?
2006.06-157,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2238.067,2255.045,"--Well, it does make sense because, unlike the Government's limitations, which have nothing to do with the rationale of Flast or the underlying threepence here of James Madison, that does... that is a particular amount of money that the Government is spending and it's identifiable just because of religion."
2006.06-157,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2255.654,2262.182,"So if we rule in your favor, then every Government agency has to make sure that whatever activities they undertake are part of a broader office?"
2006.06-157,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2267.508,2269.055,"--Well, they may--"
2006.06-157,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2269.055,2271.21,It's purely... a purely formalistic distinction.
2006.06-157,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2271.21,2274.458,"--Well, I don't think so, Your Honor, because I think it preserves--"
2006.06-157,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2274.458,2277.239,"Well, that would decide whether it's central or not."
2006.06-157,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2287.468,2288.515,"--Well, but if there are--"
2006.06-157,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2288.515,2290.53,But the Marshall in both--
2006.06-157,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2290.53,2298.512,"--if there are particular people in that office for a particular, separately called out program in that office that is focused on faith-based initiatives only, yes."
2006.06-157,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2298.512,2300.636,--We're trying to decide whether it is central.
2006.06-157,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2311.068,2316.473,"Your Honor, I think I haven't been clear in the test that I'm suggesting."
2006.06-157,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2316.473,2321.705,"Mr. Pincus, I would like you to go back to an answer you gave because it sounds to me like it wasn't right."
2006.06-157,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2357.487,2362.735,"Well, I think that's right, and I think that's because there are two steps to our analysis, Justice Ginsburg."
2006.06-157,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2383.429,2389.63,"But in response to Justice Ginsburg's point, you could have said the same thing about the expenditure in Bowen."
2006.06-157,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2391.271,2392.364,--But the question--
2006.06-157,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2392.364,2395.956,"It happened to have been spent badly, but it would have been spent anyway."
2006.06-157,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2395.956,2398.595,"--But it would have been spent differently, Your Honor, and I think that's the critical--"
2006.06-157,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2398.595,2401.657,"That was her point, that it would have been spent differently."
2006.06-157,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2410.169,2412.87,"--Well, I think--"
2006.06-157,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2412.87,2418.727,"The fact is it was spent for a bad purpose, and that's the essential grievance of the plaintiff, it seems to me."
2006.06-157,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2418.727,2421.508,--We agree completely.
2006.06-157,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2442.015,2446.014,"So in fact, you have... just help me with one point here."
2006.06-157,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2540.509,2544.334,"Well, respectfully, I think that's exactly what Justice Stewart said."
2006.06-157,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2561.389,2575.884,"So you're saying that what Justice Stewart's view, insofar as it was rejected, that Flast suggested even broader standing, but it suggested at least what Justice Stewart said?"
2006.06-157,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2575.884,2576.117,Yes.
2006.06-157,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2576.648,2577.211,Is that right or not?
2006.06-157,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2577.211,2577.82,--Yes.
2006.06-157,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2577.82,2581.679,"If Justice Stewart agreed completely with what the Court said, why did he write a separate opinion?"
2006.06-157,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2581.679,2589.394,"Well, in the... sometimes despite the Court's desire sometimes to have a less separate opinion, sometimes justices do."
2006.06-157,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2622.131,2644.011,It seems to me unduly intrusive for the courts to tell the President that it cannot talk to specific groups to see if they have certain talents that the Government may use to make sure that all of their energies are used properly by the Federal Government.
2006.06-157,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2678.264,2690.29,"Well, Your Honor, we believe that the incidental test, and what I've been talking about in terms of what the limits are, that it has to be a non-incidental expenditure protects against that."
2006.06-157,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2713.108,2727.79,"You really want to condemn the Federal courts to deciding case by case at the instance of all these people who feel passionately about this, case by case whether the expenditure was incidental or not."
2006.06-157,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2732.46,2733.21,Well--
2006.06-157,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2733.21,2737.678,"And just to add to the question, before you answer, at the jurisdictional stage."
2006.06-157,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2746.611,2754.201,"--Well, Your Honor, I think the fact that there hasn't been a lot of these challenges that the Government has been able to point to, indicates that this may not be a big problem."
2006.06-157,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2754.201,2757.622,Maybe they're reading Flast different than you read it.
2006.06-157,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2760.434,2768.025,"But the Court also said in Allen against Wright, you know, the absence of precise standards does not leave the courts at sea in applying the law of standing."
2006.06-157,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2787.985,2788.985,"Well, what would happen if--"
2006.06-157,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2788.985,2791.203,--Even if it's true... even if it's true--
2006.06-157,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2791.203,2794.655,"--Well then, five meetings isn't enough."
2006.06-157,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2794.983,2795.905,What about 10?
2006.06-157,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2795.905,2796.419,20?
2006.06-157,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2796.419,2797.497,"I was about to ask, 20."
2006.06-157,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2797.497,2800.216,"--Well, Your Honor, our position--"
2006.06-157,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2800.216,2800.606,We'll litigate it.
2006.06-157,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2802.917,2825.018,"--Well, you know, in Allen against Wright, and Linda R.F., there are a whole series of cases where this Court has set up guidance, and the lower courts have evaluated whether the connection between the challenged conduct and the claimed injury... here the expenditure... is close enough for there to be standing."
2006.06-157,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2827.938,2832.421,"What would happen if when this program was set up, nothing said about faith whatsoever?"
2006.06-157,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2848.383,2860.958,"If their challenge was that the entire... the whole program essentially, as the court of appeals characterized the complaint here, the whole program essentially is facially neutral, but in reality is a preference, yes."
2006.06-157,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2862.643,2865.626,It depends totally on how they characterize?
2006.06-157,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2865.626,2870.062,"--Well, that's true in many standing questions."
2006.06-157,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2872.108,2881.822,"But the problem here is the claim, the gravamen here is the Government is doing stuff with money that's been taxed from me that it shouldn't do."
2006.06-157,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2916.949,2921.713,"Well, Your Honor, it is a standard that the Court established in Flast."
2006.06-157,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2922.072,2926.196,And you also acknowledge we're not here to try to make sense.
2006.06-157,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2926.196,2926.477,--No.
2006.06-157,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2930.834,2933.615,"But not neatly, I mean, in terms of the purposes of the thing."
2006.06-157,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2940.502,2942.612,--No.
2006.06-157,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2942.612,2942.924,No.
2006.06-157,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2961.337,2963.978,You want a way to keep them out--
2006.06-157,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2963.978,2965.539,It's Justice Kennedy's concern.
2006.06-157,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2965.539,2965.836,--Exactly.
2006.06-157,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2966.289,2967.662,But what they're worried--
2006.06-157,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2987.061,2989.654,"--Well, our submission is that it does, Your Honor, because we think--"
2006.06-157,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2989.654,2993.651,"Again... I asked this before, and I think you were cut off before you had a chance."
2006.06-157,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,3008.631,3010.959,--It's incidental to what... what's the focus of the claim?
2006.06-157,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3035.416,3049.583,"So even if the expenditure is very small, but to take a particular religious symbol that might be offensive to some other people, is that incidental because the meeting went on longer and cost more than the particular religious symbol?"
2006.06-157,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,3049.583,3049.817,No.
2006.06-157,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3057.502,3063.859,"So if it was 2 dollars, you would say it's not incidental because it covered the whole cost of purchasing the religious symbol?"
2006.06-157,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,3063.859,3066.467,"--Yes, but I don't think this... and I think the Government agrees with this."
2006.06-157,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3079.539,3092.893,So there's no standing to challenge a presidential directive which says we are going to buy bagels for all evangelistic Christian breakfasts.
2006.06-157,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,3096.94,3099.049,"No, I think there would be standing."
2006.06-157,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3099.049,3099.94,--Why would there be standing?
2006.06-157,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,3099.94,3102.564,Because there the challenge is to the discriminatory purchase.
2006.06-157,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3108.483,3109.232,Of course.
2006.06-157,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,3109.857,3110.92,So there absolutely would be standing.
2006.06-157,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3110.92,3115.448,--But that shows how totally manipulable your incidental test is.
2006.06-157,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,3119.228,3119.51,"But, Your Honor--"
2006.06-157,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3119.51,3120.65,--is offending you.
2006.06-157,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,3125.569,3135.784,"--Your Honor, I think it does, because there would have to be an allegation in that situation that bagels were being purchased on a religious basis, and that's going to be awfully hard for a lawyer to sign in good faith."
2006.06-157,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3138.517,3139.97,How does that confer standing?
2006.06-157,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,3139.97,3147.248,--The purchase... the idea that bagels are being purchased only for evangelicals and not for Jewish breakfasts?
2006.06-157,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3147.248,3147.498,Right.
2006.06-157,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,3147.498,3149.186,Because the Government--
2006.06-157,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3149.186,3160.774,"Standing by Joe Doaks, not from somebody who's starting a Jewish prayer breakfast and says, you know, what could be worse than not buying bagels for a Jewish prayer breakfast."
2006.06-157,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,3180.547,3182.047,--I don't think general passion is enough.
2006.06-157,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3201.304,3202.929,"Mr. Pincus, may I ask you this question?"
2006.06-157,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,3205.599,3215.205,"--Yes, Your Honor, we do, because in Valley Forge, first of all, as Justice Ginsburg said, the Court relied on the fact that it was a property clause claim."
2006.06-157,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3248.472,3253.907,"Do you think the distinction between taxing, between taxing and spending and the property clause, makes any sense?"
2006.06-157,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,3265.95,3274.244,"Well, I think that the core of what was the concern was... was the taking of the money and the using it for religious purposes."
2006.06-157,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3275.103,3276.744,"--Well, it's not the same money used."
2006.06-157,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,3278.039,3278.68,"--No, it's not the same money."
2006.06-157,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3278.68,3282.038,It goes into some pot of fungible money and it's other money used.
2006.06-157,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,3286.021,3308.386,"Well, I think that the Court decided that it made a difference, and I think in terms of cabining, in terms of the worry that perhaps Flast is going to be overbroad and the need to have Congress involved, which I think is key... there was no congressional involvement at all in designating those properties and there is in the appropriations context, and I think that's a key difference."
2006.06-157,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3408.642,3409.86,"Thank you, Mr. Pincus."
2006.06-157,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,3413.203,3415.0,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2006.06-157,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3568.423,3569.579,"Thank you, general."
