1982.81-1120,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,7.854,We'll hear arguments next in United States against Rylander.
1982.81-1120,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,127.822,130.602,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1982.81-1120,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,729.233,730.34,"Mr. Wallace, could I interrupt you for a moment?"
1982.81-1120,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,748.551,750.083,That would be a very different case.
1982.81-1120,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,752.848,753.66,"Oh, I see."
1982.81-1120,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,753.66,755.285,That's what we're leading up to.
1982.81-1120,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,758.829,763.216,"Let's assume for a moment, Mr.... are you finished?"
1982.81-1120,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,773.152,775.34,If he had submitted himself to cross examination--
1982.81-1120,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,775.34,775.637,"No, no."
1982.81-1120,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,777.041,777.446,"--Oh, no."
1982.81-1120,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,778.354,788.178,"In other words, if he'd done what he did in the Curcio case, which was get on the stand, say I don't have the records, and I refuse to say why because of the privilege, which is exactly--"
1982.81-1120,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,788.178,799.563,"--The... the... but in the Curcio case, the only thing contested at the appellate level was his refusal to testify rather than his refusal to produce the records."
1982.81-1120,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,836.345,838.547,--But the Curcio case holds that the claim of privilege is proper.
1982.81-1120,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,839.468,843.25,With respect to the testimony that the subpoena asked him for.
1982.81-1120,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,843.25,843.811,Right.
1982.81-1120,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,853.478,855.791,With... with respect to--
1982.81-1120,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,855.791,857.663,Nonpossession of the records.
1982.81-1120,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,857.663,864.927,--With respect to the... the order in the subpoena requiring him to testify with respect to the records.
1982.81-1120,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,866.737,875.484,"Under the Curcio opinion would Curcio have been subject to cross examination on his answer ""I don't have the records""?"
1982.81-1120,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,881.64,895.71,"--He would be subject to cross examination in the context of enforcing the order to produce the records, if that was the way he chose to respond to that order through his own testimony."
1982.81-1120,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,895.71,897.909,"Well, that doesn't really... that doesn't really answer my question, I don't think."
1982.81-1120,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,897.909,900.206,I... I... I... I... yes.
1982.81-1120,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,900.206,904.298,He gets on the stand and says
1982.81-1120,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,920.994,939.423,"Well, in... in our view he could be cross examined on both of those issues in the context of the need to get compliance with the order to produce the records."
1982.81-1120,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,997.027,999.292,"Mr. Wallace, kill the hypothetical case."
1982.81-1120,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1007.883,1011.225,"Well, he... he has that problem."
1982.81-1120,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1013.923,1015.722,"You don't know any way out of that problem, do you?"
1982.81-1120,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1015.722,1045.022,"--Well, what I think should not be the way out is to have the law reward him for destroying the records when process issues by allowing him through refusing to testify and pleading his privilege against self-incrimination to defeat a... a production order that would otherwise result from the showing that the Government made."
1982.81-1120,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1045.022,1053.831,Is there any holding in this Court that prohibits a judicial inquiry into the good faith of the assertion of the Fifth Amendment?
1982.81-1120,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1053.831,1055.173,Not at all.
1982.81-1120,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1057.345,1072.495,"It's done constantly in trial courts, isn't it, when... when there is an apparently dubious assertion of the Fifth Amendment and cross examination develops that there is no basis for a genuine Fifth Amendment claim?"
1982.81-1120,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1072.495,1075.181,--That is... is... is precisely the case.
1982.81-1120,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1116.603,1118.775,Curcio held squarely to the contrary.
1982.81-1120,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1118.775,1128.3,"Well, that is not our view of Curcio, because the production question was not what was at issue."
1982.81-1120,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1129.66,1132.285,"Well, would you tell me what you think Curcio holds?"
1982.81-1120,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1132.285,1143.844,--It... it... it holds that he can refuse to testify in response to the subpoena requiring him to produce and testify.
1982.81-1120,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1146.09,1154.272,"Well, it holds he... he testified that he didn't have the records, and then he said I won't tell you where they are because I assert the Fifth as to the cross examination."
1982.81-1120,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1156.366,1175.714,--That... that... that is correct and... but all I can do is repeat that what was contested was that whether he... he responded adequately and waived his Fifth Amendment privilege with respect to the order that he testified concerning the records.
1982.81-1120,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1202.033,1207.515,"Mr. Wallace, I'm not quite sure yet that I understand your position."
1982.81-1120,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1234.068,1243.033,"He... then I think he would be subject to civil contempt, because he has done nothing to satisfy his burden of production."
1982.81-1120,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1243.033,1249.766,"So he would at least have had to bring in the... a witness, a third party, for example, to explain his situation."
1982.81-1120,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1249.766,1252.765,We have made the requisite showing.
1982.81-1120,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1259.667,1270.102,"Well, if he gets on the stand and says I don't have them, even if he may not be cross examined beyond that, you say that he hasn't made the requisite showing."
1982.81-1120,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1270.102,1273.397,Well--
1982.81-1120,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1273.397,1274.115,Don't you?
1982.81-1120,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1274.864,1276.022,--That is correct.
1982.81-1120,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1282.269,1293.043,His uncross-examined... his uncross-examined assertion is not... he cannot use an uncross-examined assertion to satisfy his burden of showing why he can't produce.
1982.81-1120,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1293.043,1294.559,That is our position.
1982.81-1120,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1294.559,1295.183,Yes.
1982.81-1120,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1295.183,1300.214,And that is precisely the error that we think the Court of Appeals made in this case.
1982.81-1120,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1311.617,1313.692,In your view could he be then asked and required to answer
1982.81-1120,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1316.472,1329.452,"I think that would be a proper question on cross examination, and that if he chose to testify on the subject he would have waived that."
1982.81-1120,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1333.886,1334.557,I'm not talking about a waiver.
1982.81-1120,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1363.359,1370.2,"I rather doubt it, not in the face of this Fifth Amendment claim, because it could be a step in the chain of proof against him."
1982.81-1120,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1370.652,1377.307,Without any explanation of how the Fifth Amendment protection is required to explain whether he ever had possession of them?
1982.81-1120,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1377.307,1380.883,--That... that... that might be a proper inquiry into whether he has a basis for the claim.
1982.81-1120,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1380.883,1393.986,"But if he... if he invokes the Fifth Amendment in response to a question like that, the District Court is entitled to weigh that invocation of privilege against him in making a factual determination as to whether he testified truthfully on the original question, isn't it?"
1982.81-1120,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1396.08,1399.032,"Yes, yes, that is correct also."
1982.81-1120,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1399.032,1413.183,"You can also say if you're going to take the Fifth Amendment and not make a showing, you're going to have to produce the records because you just haven't made... unless you permit cross examination, you just haven't satisfied your burden."
1982.81-1120,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1413.183,1414.103,That is precisely our position.
1982.81-1120,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1414.103,1421.352,"Well, I suppose... doesn't the court have to, on your motion to strike, simply strike the preceding testimony and the answer?"
1982.81-1120,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1428.691,1429.081,That is our position.
1982.81-1120,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1441.046,1443.0,But if he takes the stand and says
1982.81-1120,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1452.525,1458.398,"--It... it... it may well be, but it would be subject to the test of cross examination."
1982.81-1120,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1458.398,1462.114,"And you ask him ""Did you ever have them"", and--"
1982.81-1120,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1462.114,1462.523,"Well, we might ask--"
1982.81-1120,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1462.523,1463.677,"--And then he says,"
1982.81-1120,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1474.019,1481.327,"--Well, then we... we might... he might still not satisfy his burden with... with that kind of testimony."
1982.81-1120,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1490.963,1492.136,When I take the Fifth Amendment--
1982.81-1120,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1492.136,1504.272,--The fact that he's taken the Fifth Amendment does not require the District Court to give credence to his testimony prior to his taking the Fifth Amendment.
1982.81-1120,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1508.612,1517.545,"--Well, I don't understand what else he can do after he asks and says that my answer would incriminate me."
1982.81-1120,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1517.545,1521.64,"Well, that... that is up to him."
1982.81-1120,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1524.483,1525.981,But isn't that what he did here?
1982.81-1120,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1529.619,1536.805,Here he didn't submit himself to any cross examination whatsoever.
1982.81-1120,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1539.273,1542.101,"All you're saying is that the Government can't have... all you're saying is that he can't have his cake and eat it, too."
1982.81-1120,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1542.101,1543.364,That is correct.
1982.81-1120,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1587.097,1591.391,"Well, of course, you're really disagreeing again with Curcio, because of course that same thing happened there."
1982.81-1120,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1604.029,1605.261,That is correct.
1982.81-1120,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1605.261,1607.121,And what do you understand that means?
1982.81-1120,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1611.821,1614.133,As far as I can tell.
1982.81-1120,1,30754,joseph_h_harbison_iii,,1656.8,1661.067,Mr. Chief Justice Burger--
1982.81-1120,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1661.067,1662.705,Mr. Harrison.
1982.81-1120,1,30754,joseph_h_harbison_iii,,1662.705,1665.282,"Mr. Chief Justice Burger, and may it please the Court:"
1982.81-1120,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1852.985,1856.452,You say... you say at the contempt trial he said he didn't have them.
1982.81-1120,1,30754,joseph_h_harbison_iii,,1859.201,1859.685,--Yes.
1982.81-1120,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1890.081,1891.516,"He said, ""Where are the records""?"
1982.81-1120,1,30754,joseph_h_harbison_iii,,1898.095,1900.295,No.
1982.81-1120,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1917.912,1923.472,"Well, what was he held in contempt for... failure to produce the records or failure to testify?"
1982.81-1120,1,30754,joseph_h_harbison_iii,,1923.472,1924.927,"That's a very interesting question, Judge White."
1982.81-1120,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1925.426,1928.191,"Well, let's assume for the moment that the judge had said,"
1982.81-1120,1,30754,joseph_h_harbison_iii,,1951.412,1951.665,--Okay.
1982.81-1120,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1952.352,1954.321,That's Curcio.
1982.81-1120,1,30754,joseph_h_harbison_iii,,1954.321,1955.148,--Okay.
1982.81-1120,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1968.61,1975.235,"Well, he certainly never made any claim that producing the records would... would violate his Fifth Amendment rights."
1982.81-1120,1,30754,joseph_h_harbison_iii,,1975.235,1975.578,No.
1982.81-1120,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1976.436,1976.935,No.
1982.81-1120,1,30754,joseph_h_harbison_iii,,1977.356,1977.684,I think this Court--
1982.81-1120,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1977.684,1979.278,--So there is quite a difference between those--
1982.81-1120,1,30754,joseph_h_harbison_iii,,1979.278,1979.715,--Certainly.
1982.81-1120,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1979.715,1980.495,--Two things.
1982.81-1120,1,30754,joseph_h_harbison_iii,,1981.7,1984.091,"Well, that... I haven't finished yet."
1982.81-1120,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2013.25,2015.372,"Well, has he made any showing that they don't exist?"
1982.81-1120,1,30754,joseph_h_harbison_iii,,2015.372,2019.026,"My point is, Your Honor, that he doesn't have to make that showing."
1982.81-1120,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2032.46,2045.547,"Well, suppose they... let's make this concrete... suppose the treasurer of... or the secretary of General Motors Corporation is called as a witness and he's asked to produce the minutes of the last five meetings of the board."
1982.81-1120,1,30754,joseph_h_harbison_iii,,2049.563,2050.951,He would have to show up--
1982.81-1120,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2050.951,2056.559,He's presumptively in charge of those records unless he can demonstrate that he is not.
1982.81-1120,1,30754,joseph_h_harbison_iii,,2056.559,2064.214,"--No, Your Honor, I disagree with the so-called presumption that he is in possession of those records without at least some showing."
1982.81-1120,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2070.865,2072.255,Are those cases from this Court?
1982.81-1120,1,30754,joseph_h_harbison_iii,,2072.255,2073.911,"--No, but Fleischman is, Your Honor."
1982.81-1120,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2098.104,2102.152,"I suppose the point is, though, that if all he says is"
1982.81-1120,1,30754,joseph_h_harbison_iii,,2114.177,2115.878,"--I disagree, Justice O'Connor."
1982.81-1120,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2129.949,2131.964,He wouldn't let himself be cross examined on that.
1982.81-1120,1,30754,joseph_h_harbison_iii,,2135.229,2135.962,--No.
1982.81-1120,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2146.631,2153.065,"Well, I know, but they... they... they held him... want to hold him in criminal contempt for failing to testify any farther."
1982.81-1120,1,30754,joseph_h_harbison_iii,,2157.986,2160.953,"Well, that... that was answered in O'Henry."
1982.81-1120,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2164.92,2166.48,Is O'Henry a case from this Court?
1982.81-1120,1,30754,joseph_h_harbison_iii,,2166.48,2167.076,"No, it is not."
1982.81-1120,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2221.038,2223.787,"Even the question ""Did you ever have them""?"
1982.81-1120,1,30754,joseph_h_harbison_iii,,2226.474,2230.719,"--That's one of the questions in Curcio, one of the 15 written questions: ""Did you ever have them""?"

1982.81-1120,1,30754,joseph_h_harbison_iii,,2257.693,2258.161,No.
1982.81-1120,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2306.082,2312.515,Does the law in... does the law in California say who is to have custody of corporate records?
1982.81-1120,1,30754,joseph_h_harbison_iii,,2312.515,2315.514,"No, it does not, and that's why the Ninth Circuit held that on the--"
1982.81-1120,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2315.514,2322.931,"Isn't that about the only one of the 50 states, isn't it, that says that a corporation doesn't have to keep records?"
1982.81-1120,1,30754,joseph_h_harbison_iii,,2322.931,2323.668,--No.
1982.81-1120,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2325.119,2327.557,And whose possession are they in?
1982.81-1120,1,30754,joseph_h_harbison_iii,,2327.557,2334.334,"There is no presumption as to whose possession they are in, but it is reasonable to assume that a corporate officer might possess them."
1982.81-1120,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2338.304,2339.848,Including... including the president.
1982.81-1120,1,30754,joseph_h_harbison_iii,,2339.848,2341.693,Including the president.
1982.81-1120,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2341.693,2350.953,And is it presumed under California law that this president we are now talking about did at one time have possession of those records?
1982.81-1120,1,30754,joseph_h_harbison_iii,,2350.953,2359.824,"Well, apparently someone made that presumption that since he might have had them in 1975, he still ought to have them in 1980, but there's no proof."
1982.81-1120,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2359.824,2362.854,"Well, do you agree that they... he presumed to have had them in '75?"
1982.81-1120,1,30754,joseph_h_harbison_iii,,2362.854,2364.227,"No, I do not."
1982.81-1120,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2364.227,2367.713,You presume that he violated the California laws?
1982.81-1120,1,30754,joseph_h_harbison_iii,,2369.741,2379.19,"No, I do not, because one of the documents that the Government introduced at trial was an affidavit from the Secretary of State saying that the corporation they wanted the records from was defunct in 1975."
1982.81-1120,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2383.41,2384.517,Why?
1982.81-1120,1,30754,joseph_h_harbison_iii,,2384.517,2390.56,"Because they proved that the corporation was defunct; therefore, there's no presumption that it was keeping any records."
1982.81-1120,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2390.56,2411.395,"If the biggest rum running, dope peddling corporation in a state is caught by IRS or somebody and the ring leader is subpoenaed to bring in the records, if we follow this case, will his best defense be to burn them up?"
1982.81-1120,1,30754,joseph_h_harbison_iii,,2411.395,2419.02,"Well, that's apparently what the Solicitor General is arguing, that it will be very difficult to enforce the law."
1982.81-1120,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2424.658,2427.08,I said in my hypothetical case.
1982.81-1120,1,30754,joseph_h_harbison_iii,,2427.08,2428.172,--Is it going to be difficult?
1982.81-1120,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2428.172,2429.814,Yes.
1982.81-1120,1,30754,joseph_h_harbison_iii,,2429.814,2433.7,I would need more facts.
1982.81-1120,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2442.15,2460.19,But wouldn't that be the normal thing for a corrupt law... not law-abiding but law-destroying organization to do would be the best way would be to burn them up?
1982.81-1120,1,30754,joseph_h_harbison_iii,,2460.19,2461.501,If they had records--
1982.81-1120,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2461.501,2466.157,"And the lawyer would say if you burn them up, I've got a good case that'll support you."
1982.81-1120,1,30754,joseph_h_harbison_iii,,2466.157,2471.17,"--Well, you'd have a better case, because the Government could not--"
1982.81-1120,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2471.17,2475.012,"Wouldn't this be a good one, if we come out your way?"
1982.81-1120,1,30754,joseph_h_harbison_iii,,2475.012,2478.884,--I don't think it would be good.
1982.81-1120,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2488.505,2492.115,My point is... I thought I made it clear... this is the only evidence they had.
1982.81-1120,1,30754,joseph_h_harbison_iii,,2492.115,2495.208,"Well, if that's the only evidence they have, then it's impossible."
1982.81-1120,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2495.208,2496.004,That's right.
1982.81-1120,1,30754,joseph_h_harbison_iii,,2497.427,2498.69,That's true.
1982.81-1120,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2498.69,2508.357,"Mr. Harbison, I just glanced over Curcio again, and it didn't involve... the issue on appeal didn't involve production at all."
1982.81-1120,1,30754,joseph_h_harbison_iii,,2516.729,2518.23,I agree--
1982.81-1120,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2518.23,2530.942,The... the Court said that the fact that they were union records and not his personal records didn't mean that he couldn't invoke this privilege against self-incrimination if questions about the union records would in fact incriminate him.
1982.81-1120,1,30754,joseph_h_harbison_iii,,2545.968,2552.527,"--Yes, but he was sentenced for that because he is unable because of the Fifth Amendment to meet his burden."
1982.81-1120,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2552.527,2553.638,He's not unable.
1982.81-1120,1,30754,joseph_h_harbison_iii,,2554.823,2557.011,"Well, see, no one knows that."
1982.81-1120,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2561.32,2574.395,"But at this stage the Government has come forward with enough, the Government says, so that your client should take the laboring oar for a while, and if he refuses, he's entitled to refuse under the Fifth Amendment, but he's not entitled to go scott-free of the summons order."
1982.81-1120,1,30754,joseph_h_harbison_iii,,2574.395,2576.797,"Well, therein lies the issue."
1982.81-1120,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2598.693,2602.097,It doesn't force him to give up anything because--
1982.81-1120,1,30754,joseph_h_harbison_iii,,2602.097,2603.22,He's going to go to jail if he doesn't.
1982.81-1120,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2604.393,2606.768,"--Well, he's going to go to jail under one of two theories."
1982.81-1120,1,30754,joseph_h_harbison_iii,,2609.299,2610.984,That's compulsion.
1982.81-1120,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2610.984,2637.801,"But a defendant... but a defendant... counsel, in a criminal case where a defendant, for instance, is charged with murder and the only people present at the scene of the alleged murder were the deceased and the defendant, now, if the defendant wants to plead the Fifth Amendment so he can't take the stand and say well, it was self-defense, then he risks going to jail because he's convicted possibly of the offense charged."
1982.81-1120,1,30754,joseph_h_harbison_iii,,2661.198,2665.448,"He's in a much worse position, Your Honor, because in your hypothetical that gentlemen is not compelled."
1982.81-1120,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2703.523,2720.877,"Mr. Harbison, suppose... suppose that... that... that you would agree that... at the... at the enforcement hearing the Government made a prima facie showing that the records existed and that... and that you would agree to it, that that showing had been made."
1982.81-1120,1,30754,joseph_h_harbison_iii,,2723.718,2734.669,"--Then I would... I would say to you, Your Honor, if you were the District Court judge and we had legitimate presumption of possession because somebody had shown it at the summons enforcement, which wasn't done here, I would cite to you the case of Maggio."
1982.81-1120,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2743.369,2753.959,--So you're... what you're really saying is that the Government... that there's no way the Government can come back and meet its burden here when he takes the Fifth Amendment.
1982.81-1120,1,30754,joseph_h_harbison_iii,,2753.959,2754.583,--No.
1982.81-1120,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2754.583,2757.645,"All he has to do is say I'm sorry, I just can't... I don't have them."
1982.81-1120,1,30754,joseph_h_harbison_iii,,2760.924,2761.423,No.
1982.81-1120,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2776.729,2777.026,All right.
1982.81-1120,1,30754,joseph_h_harbison_iii,,2782.415,2783.039,Yes.
1982.81-1120,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2783.039,2785.429,All right.
1982.81-1120,1,30754,joseph_h_harbison_iii,,2791.769,2792.616,Yes.
1982.81-1120,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2820.914,2832.535,"Well, it sounds to me like what you really should argue is that... is that the turnover order was infirm in that there never was a requisite showing to substantiate or to support a turnover order."
1982.81-1120,1,30754,joseph_h_harbison_iii,,2832.535,2835.128,"If we were in a bankruptcy proceeding, that would be precisely what I'm doing."
1982.81-1120,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2855.151,2868.13,Is it... do you think the Government... I'll ask the other side... but do you think the Government agrees that at some point it has the burden of showing existence?
1982.81-1120,1,30754,joseph_h_harbison_iii,,2868.13,2881.033,"I think they have, Your Honor, because every case they've cited for the proposition that they have this continuing presumption or that there was a final appeal of our order... that is, res judicata... those cases that they cite found possession."
1982.81-1120,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2882.546,2890.622,"Well, the only difference between... it sounds to me like the only difference between you two then is whether the Government has made an ample showing of possession."
1982.81-1120,1,30754,joseph_h_harbison_iii,,2890.622,2891.542,Ever.
1982.81-1120,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2891.542,2895.742,"If they have, if they have, you just a while ago, I thought, indicated--"
1982.81-1120,1,30754,joseph_h_harbison_iii,,2895.742,2896.104,I did.
1982.81-1120,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2896.104,2899.837,--That your client would have... could not just take the Fifth and be quiet.
1982.81-1120,1,30754,joseph_h_harbison_iii,,2899.837,2900.507,No.
1982.81-1120,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2904.695,2908.162,So this isn't a question of the Fifth Amendment or anything else.
1982.81-1120,1,30754,joseph_h_harbison_iii,,2914.845,2917.47,"Well, you're right to a certain extent, but here--"
1982.81-1120,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2917.47,2918.203,Thank you.
1982.81-1120,1,30754,joseph_h_harbison_iii,,2919.283,2931.278,"--Here, after my client makes his showing and the burden goes back to them, they want to cross examine him to make their showing instead of them going out and getting the third party or introducing the extrinsic evidence."
1982.81-1120,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2932.51,2948.222,"Well, how can your client make a showing... that is, at a hearing where there's presumably the facts are adduced by oral testimony... if he simply gets up and makes an assertion, albeit orally, and refuses to be cross examined on it."
1982.81-1120,1,30754,joseph_h_harbison_iii,,2952.737,2961.203,"--Your... that hypothetical is akin to a Fleischman-type situation where the Government did show some possession, and the person failed to say anything."
1982.81-1120,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2963.714,2969.996,"Well, the discussion... the discussion in Fleischman was not in the context of anyone having taken a witness stand and offered a partial explanation."
1982.81-1120,1,30754,joseph_h_harbison_iii,,2973.869,2974.118,That's true.
1982.81-1120,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2975.572,2980.006,But utterly worthless so far as cross examination is concerned.
1982.81-1120,1,30754,joseph_h_harbison_iii,,2999.141,3000.405,That's precisely my argument.
1982.81-1120,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3002.058,3009.728,"Which is a... it's, a) a question of law, and it's also a question of fact: is there some kind of a showing in the record?"
1982.81-1120,1,30754,joseph_h_harbison_iii,,3009.728,3010.727,Correct.
1982.81-1120,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3010.727,3016.022,I'm not sure your responses now are consistent with your responses to me on my hypothetical.
1982.81-1120,1,30754,joseph_h_harbison_iii,,3044.638,3045.402,No.
1982.81-1120,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3051.57,3053.445,"Well, that is given."
1982.81-1120,1,30754,joseph_h_harbison_iii,,3053.445,3055.177,"No, it's not given in this case."
1982.81-1120,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3055.177,3057.427,In my... I'm talking about my hypothetical.
1982.81-1120,1,30754,joseph_h_harbison_iii,,3068.159,3074.687,"Then I would retract that answer and say to your hypothetical once there has been proven possession, the Fifth Amendment is no longer bona fide."
1982.81-1120,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3081.153,3083.044,They still can't make him answer.
1982.81-1120,1,30754,joseph_h_harbison_iii,,3085.072,3086.027,--He's in contempt.
1982.81-1120,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3088.024,3090.242,--He might be in jail for not producing.
1982.81-1120,1,30754,joseph_h_harbison_iii,,3090.242,3097.175,"And he wasn't sent there because he wouldn't violate his Fifth Amendment right like he is in this case, because they never carried a burden, either at the summons enforcement or at the trial."
1982.81-1120,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3124.854,3125.478,"Let me ask you a question, if I may."
1982.81-1120,1,30754,joseph_h_harbison_iii,,3138.253,3139.816,The summons enforcement hearing.
1982.81-1120,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3139.816,3142.02,"The summons... no, the General Motors example."
1982.81-1120,1,30754,joseph_h_harbison_iii,,3167.601,3168.163,Absolutely.
1982.81-1120,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3168.163,3169.398,You think he can be held in civil contempt?
1982.81-1120,1,30754,joseph_h_harbison_iii,,3169.398,3176.004,"Absolutely, because they proved... they have a legitimate presumption that the records exist, and he has not rebutted it."
1982.81-1120,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3182.874,3184.407,"Well, I understand that, but you think that your--"
1982.81-1120,1,30754,joseph_h_harbison_iii,,3184.407,3186.252,And there's no proof at the contempt hearing that they ever existed.
1982.81-1120,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3186.252,3192.405,--You think under Maggio that he could be held in civil contempt even though he has testified under oath that the documents no longer exist.
1982.81-1120,1,30754,joseph_h_harbison_iii,,3192.405,3192.748,Sure.
1982.81-1120,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3201.589,3210.117,"Is it your position that once he says they're not, you can't any questions about those records, is that right?"
1982.81-1120,1,30754,joseph_h_harbison_iii,,3210.117,3216.581,"My position is that if the Government at the summons enforcement shows that they exist, they're entitled to a continuing presumption."
1982.81-1120,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3226.124,3228.437,"What do you mean when you say... oh, excuse me."
1982.81-1120,1,30754,joseph_h_harbison_iii,,3232.044,3233.104,Prima facie is--
1982.81-1120,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3233.104,3237.776,"Well, why isn't it prima facie when he says ""I don't have the records""?"
1982.81-1120,1,30754,joseph_h_harbison_iii,,3240.073,3241.68,"--That carries his burden, yes."
1982.81-1120,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3241.68,3243.742,"Well, he said he didn't have the records."
1982.81-1120,1,30754,joseph_h_harbison_iii,,3243.742,3244.569,Yes.
1982.81-1120,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3244.569,3247.911,So he admitted that the records existed.
1982.81-1120,1,30754,joseph_h_harbison_iii,,3247.911,3251.004,No.
1982.81-1120,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3256.407,3257.363,He said he didn't have them at this time.
1982.81-1120,1,30754,joseph_h_harbison_iii,,3258.548,3261.157,"No, absolutely not."
1982.81-1120,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3283.46,3288.677,Why not get a man for treason if you're going to give a hypothetical.
1982.81-1120,1,30754,joseph_h_harbison_iii,,3290.412,3293.613,"Well, I'm trying to make a demonstration of the Fifth Amendment."
1982.81-1120,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3318.664,3325.161,"I don't think you're defending everything that you can find in the Court of Appeals opinion then, are you?"
1982.81-1120,1,30754,joseph_h_harbison_iii,,3338.313,3338.984,Yes.
1982.81-1120,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3338.984,3340.406,--Are in his possession or under his control.
1982.81-1120,1,30754,joseph_h_harbison_iii,,3340.406,3340.796,Yes.
1982.81-1120,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3342.325,3346.108,"Well, that is not... that isn't what... that isn't what the Court of Appeals is saying."
1982.81-1120,1,30754,joseph_h_harbison_iii,,3349.138,3350.698,--Absolutely.
1982.81-1120,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3379.905,3380.716,Do you think--
1982.81-1120,1,30754,joseph_h_harbison_iii,,3380.716,3384.012,"In fact, on page 21 they say it's on us by clear and convincing to prove inability."
1982.81-1120,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3384.012,3403.849,"--If you think... do you think that at an enforcement proceeding in connection with one of these subpoenas the issue of presumption or existence comes up, that the Government then before it gets a turnover order or an enforcement order must show by clear and convincing evidence that they are then in possession and control of the defendant?"
1982.81-1120,1,30754,joseph_h_harbison_iii,,3403.849,3404.473,No.
1982.81-1120,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3409.238,3412.892,"So they can get a turnover, or they can get an order for him to produce."
1982.81-1120,1,30754,joseph_h_harbison_iii,,3412.892,3413.406,Right.
1982.81-1120,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3413.406,3414.423,And then--
1982.81-1120,1,30754,joseph_h_harbison_iii,,3414.423,3416.0,An order enforcing the summons.
1982.81-1120,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3416.0,3417.516,--An order enforcing the summons.
1982.81-1120,1,30754,joseph_h_harbison_iii,,3431.62,3432.15,Yes.
1982.81-1120,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3435.306,3435.727,I'm not sure.
1982.81-1120,1,30754,joseph_h_harbison_iii,,3438.102,3438.788,--If he doesn't have--
1982.81-1120,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3438.788,3441.07,I understand your... I understand you think the judgment was wrong.
1982.81-1120,1,30754,joseph_h_harbison_iii,,3441.07,3446.115,"--Well, if he doesn't have a valid Fifth Amendment, then under Transocean he has to show detail why he doesn't have."
1982.81-1120,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3446.115,3448.221,"Do you have anything further, Mr. Wallace?"
1982.81-1120,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3448.221,3450.83,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice."
1982.81-1120,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3458.497,3459.811,Exactly.
1982.81-1120,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3459.811,3464.276,But we don't agree with what the Ninth Circuit said we have to show by clear and convincing evidence.
1982.81-1120,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3464.276,3475.693,"Well, Mr. Wallace, don't you... do you think that at some place in this whole proceeding the Government must produce at least probable cause to believe that these records are in existence and that he has them?"
1982.81-1120,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3478.614,3482.595,"I wouldn't use the term ""probable cause""."
1982.81-1120,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3483.063,3483.613,"Well, all right."
1982.81-1120,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3484.58,3486.487,--We... it can be shown by inference.
1982.81-1120,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3650.84,3656.073,"--The court's order didn't make clear that third party witnesses would also suffice, did it?"
1982.81-1120,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3656.073,3660.148,"I... I... I would prefer that it be more explicit, but this portion--"
1982.81-1120,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3660.148,3662.523,But it's your position that that would have sufficed.
1982.81-1120,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3662.523,3663.038,--That's right.
1982.81-1120,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3668.458,3670.505,"Thank you, gentlemen."
