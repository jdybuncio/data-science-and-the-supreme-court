1961.234,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,52.835,"Number 234, Benz versus New York State Thruway Authority."
1961.234,0,35024,lauren_d_rachlin,,54.111,58.27,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1961.234,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,499.893,500.994,(Voice Overlap) may I ask you?
1961.234,0,35024,lauren_d_rachlin,,517.871,518.214,Yes sir.
1961.234,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,518.214,519.39,-- that I understand you?
1961.234,0,35024,lauren_d_rachlin,,519.39,523.121,"Yeah, yes sir I perhaps use the term meeting of the minds loosely."
1961.234,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,533.301,535.252,Would you take two minutes of your time?
1961.234,0,35024,lauren_d_rachlin,,535.252,536.881,Sure.
1961.234,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,536.881,539.946,Makes such comment as you will.
1961.234,0,35024,lauren_d_rachlin,,621.66,659.907,"Well, if it please the Court, our contention from the very beginning was that if the state court refused to accept jurisdiction of this case that such refusal to accept jurisdiction and refusal thereby to give the plaintiff, the petitioner of a just compensation which he was guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment would then constitute a deprivation of property without just compensation and therefore, constitute a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment."
1961.234,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,659.907,674.322,"If New York chooses not to have courts which entertain these claims, this Court can confer that jurisdiction by saying you have a federal right, the federal constitution amply enforceable in federal courts."
1961.234,0,35024,lauren_d_rachlin,,674.322,693.221,"The fact is that the New York courts -- let's say prior to the decision in the Benz case, and in fact constitutionally under the New York State Constitution have established the Supreme Court of the State of New York as a court of general jurisdiction in law and equity."
1961.234,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,711.335,712.091,You may be right.
1961.234,0,35024,lauren_d_rachlin,,717.581,718.554,Well --
1961.234,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,718.554,724.839,They do not suggest remotely that you have no -- that no property was taken here.
1961.234,0,35024,lauren_d_rachlin,,728.145,735.208,Well the -- this was of course -- our contention from the very first of this -- in this case.
1961.234,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,875.711,884.957,"Have you -- I haven't looked at the briefs, is the distinction of the Court of Claims set forth in statute giving the Court of Claims jurisdiction?"
1961.234,0,35024,lauren_d_rachlin,,884.957,886.818,It is not -- it is not set forth.
1961.234,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,898.161,903.201,"But you also -- you also got -- this isn't merely an equity suit, is it?"
1961.234,0,35024,lauren_d_rachlin,,904.803,905.745,I -- yes.
1961.234,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,907.219,909.778,Do you want money damages?
1961.234,0,35024,lauren_d_rachlin,,909.778,915.638,"We would rely on the clean-up doctrine, the -- the traditional power of the court of equity to grant damages."
1961.234,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,915.638,920.323,"Therefore you could go -- it could go into the Court of Claims and ask for the money, couldn't you?"
1961.234,0,35024,lauren_d_rachlin,,920.323,923.488,"No sir, we clearly cannot in the Court of Appeals --"
1961.234,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,923.488,924.257,Why not?
1961.234,0,35024,lauren_d_rachlin,,924.257,926.589,-- the Court of Appeals has in fact so held in this case.
1961.234,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,926.589,928.028,Why not?
1961.234,0,35024,lauren_d_rachlin,,928.028,941.012,"Because once having executed our agreement of adjustment, we were then foreclosed because the Court of Appeals has no -- not the Court of Appeals, the Court of Claims has no equitable jurisdiction and can do nothing about this."
1961.234,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,941.012,947.577,"And but as to moneys, as to moneys, that you get your money from the Court of Claims?"
1961.234,0,35024,lauren_d_rachlin,,947.577,948.421,No sir.
1961.234,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,951.068,954.097,But you mean all you can get is the $3500 which you --
1961.234,0,35024,lauren_d_rachlin,,954.097,966.299,"I would imagine so but I don't think -- I feel that once having executed this agreement of adjustment, we are then -- the statute being in the alternative, we are then foreclosed from the Court of Claims."
1961.234,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,966.299,973.116,"Well, are saying this to the face of that agreement, you can't get $70,000 unless somehow that agreement is reformed, is that it?"
1961.234,0,35024,lauren_d_rachlin,,973.116,974.465,"Yes sir, yes sir."
1961.234,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,977.644,987.664,"As Mr. Justice Frankfurter suggest, couldn't you cash your complaint in the Court of Claims in the form of a demand for $70,000 for the property that was taken?"
1961.234,0,35024,lauren_d_rachlin,,998.996,999.42,No sir.
1961.234,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,999.42,999.658,No.
1961.234,0,35024,lauren_d_rachlin,,1000.98,1007.756,"No, this was one of the contentions made by the respondent in this case."
1961.234,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1012.675,1013.076,This case?
1961.234,0,35024,lauren_d_rachlin,,1013.076,1014.005,-- for this case.
1961.234,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1023.274,1026.17,The statute of limitation is at run I would suggest and that might (Voice Overlap) --
1961.234,0,35024,lauren_d_rachlin,,1026.17,1032.175,This was the suggestion made by respondent but there is nothing in the case to show that this was the reason.
