2017.16-1140,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,9.04,"We'll hear argument this morning in Case Number 16-1140, the National Institute of Family and Life Advocates versus Becerra. Mr. Farris."
2017.16-1140,0,35793,michael_p_farris,,9.04,31.88,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: California took aim at pro-life pregnancy centers by compelling licensed centers to point the way to an abortion and imposing onerous advertising rules on unlicensed centers that do not provide ultrasounds or any other medical services. The state then provided exemptions for all other medical providers who serve pregnant women."
2017.16-1140,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,40.92,85.64,"What would be the situation, taking the other side, if the state law were that all women's health providers that perform abortions would have to tell the patients, if you would like to carry the pregnancy to term, you will have access to a clinic that will assist them, provide adoption facilities they might contact, or provide instruction on how to care for infants? Suppose that were the statute."
2017.16-1140,0,35793,michael_p_farris,,87.88,88.52,"No, Your Honor."
2017.16-1140,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,115.28,120.12,But why isn't this also informed consent?
2017.16-1140,0,35793,michael_p_farris,,120.12,120.48,"Well, Your Honor --"
2017.16-1140,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,120.48,126.76,So -- so that the patient will know what are the array of services available to her?
2017.16-1140,0,35793,michael_p_farris,,126.76,132.44,"Your Honor, the services provided by our licensed centers are not medical interventions."
2017.16-1140,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,151.36,155.52,"Well, may -- Justice Ginsburg can protect her own question, but I was interested."
2017.16-1140,0,35793,michael_p_farris,,157.92,158.4,Yes.
2017.16-1140,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,158.4,169.08,"The hypothetical case is doctors who are offering abortion services have to say that if the pregnancy is carried to a full -- full term, there's assistance."
2017.16-1140,0,35793,michael_p_farris,,169.08,171.16,"Your Honor, that would be --"
2017.16-1140,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,171.16,171.88,It's a hypothetical case.
2017.16-1140,0,35793,michael_p_farris,,171.88,186.68,"I understand, Your Honor. If the state anchors that in the informed consent framework, then it would be considered under the Casey legal principles, because, in Casey, this Court recognized that --"
2017.16-1140,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,186.68,191.64,"It doesn't anchor it under any -- it's just -- that's what the law is, what it says."
2017.16-1140,0,35793,michael_p_farris,,203.56,204.56,"Your Honor, yes."
2017.16-1140,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,224.28,230.28,"But you're -- but you're saying that if there is a non-medical facility -- I mean, I don't want to put words in your mouth."
2017.16-1140,0,35793,michael_p_farris,,276.36,295.76,"Your Honor, that would be decide -- since it's in an unlicensed facility that the requirement is being framed up, that would be judged under strict judicial scrutiny, and I don't believe it would be required. If in the license context, however, it would still be the same framework, but the analysis would be slightly different because it's -- here, in this case, it's being --"
2017.16-1140,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,295.76,297.52,"I guess I'm not sure, licensed, unlicensed."
2017.16-1140,0,35793,michael_p_farris,,336.56,345.92,"Yes, Your Honor, because, under your hypothetical, it's a targeted law. It's aimed at particular people, and not given to all doctors who diagnose and confirm pregnancies."
2017.16-1140,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,345.92,374.44,"But what if it wasn't targeted? What if there were a state law that required every doctor or facility that provides medical treatment for pregnant women to post a notice setting out the full range of options available to those women and where they might obtain services at no cost, if those -- if -- if those are available? Would there be anything wrong with a law like that?"
2017.16-1140,0,35793,michael_p_farris,,374.44,388.64,"Well, Your Honor, if it's done in a manner similar to what's being done here in California, to require pro-life doctors, whether at a clinic or otherwise, to point the way to an abortion facility and to facilitate abortion would be constitutionally problematic."
2017.16-1140,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,388.64,402.28,"What if it did that to -- what if this notice provided for -- set out all of the options and it applied to everybody, so it would apply to pro-life facilities, but it would also apply to clinics that perform abortions?"
2017.16-1140,0,35793,michael_p_farris,,402.28,403.36,I understand --
2017.16-1140,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,403.36,408.88,And provide no other form of assistance for pregnant women?
2017.16-1140,0,35793,michael_p_farris,,408.88,413.84,"Your Honor, I -- the -- I think the outcome would still be the same. Perhaps it would arise under a free exercise --"
2017.16-1140,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,413.84,415.4,"I'm sorry, the outcome would still be the same as?"
2017.16-1140,0,35793,michael_p_farris,,415.4,415.92,As my prior answer.
2017.16-1140,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,416.68,417.28,And that was what?
2017.16-1140,0,35793,michael_p_farris,,417.28,437.36,"And that is it would be unconstitutional to require that statement to a doctor who is pro-life, principally because of the free exercise issues that would arise in that case. But this case is different because not only is the requirements of which doctors have to give the notice gerrymandered, the notice itself is gerrymandered."
2017.16-1140,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,449.12,455.76,"There are a lot of different things, I mean, the simple basic thing, if you can just say it as simply as possible."
2017.16-1140,0,35793,michael_p_farris,,503.64,504.08,"Well, your Honor --"
2017.16-1140,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,504.08,508.8,"-- that you're a pro-choice state, then you can make these people tell them about abortions?"
2017.16-1140,0,35793,michael_p_farris,,508.8,515.88,"Your Honor, if it is simply a line of demarcation about your position on abortion, that would be unconstitutional in any state."
2017.16-1140,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,522.04,529.08,"No, I said do you want to draw a line as to whether it's actually the doctor, medical treatment about to do it, as not?"
2017.16-1140,0,35793,michael_p_farris,,529.08,529.92,Yes.
2017.16-1140,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,529.92,531.0,"Okay, I got it."
2017.16-1140,0,35793,michael_p_farris,,559.56,560.0,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2017.16-1140,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,560.0,560.6,Okay.
2017.16-1140,0,35793,michael_p_farris,,582.92,587.88,"Well, Your Honor, the -- the gerrymandering of the statute is evidence from the face of the statute."
2017.16-1140,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,646.12,667.4,"Well, along those lines, one other question occurs to me that is similar to Justice Breyer's with respect to the adequacy of the record we have for unlicensed clinics. We don't have a lot of evidence with respect to the nature of the burden that would be imposed by the 48-font requirement on all ads."
2017.16-1140,0,35793,michael_p_farris,,679.04,679.68,Your Honor --
2017.16-1140,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,679.68,681.28,-- as the government suggests?
2017.16-1140,0,35793,michael_p_farris,,681.28,693.36,"Your Honor, this Court faced a similar situation in the Ibanez case where there was a detailed disclosure required in a certain financial profession. And this Court didn't have a financial record."
2017.16-1140,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,726.64,727.4,We don't know what kind --
2017.16-1140,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,727.4,728.4,Can we separate --
2017.16-1140,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,728.4,763.04,"We don't know what kind of adjustments might have been made because this case went off without any kind of an evidentiary hearing, as was pointed out. But to -- to test what your position is, suppose the -- the -- the law had been simply the people who don't provide abortions or contraceptive services would have to say we don't perform abortions and we don't provide contraceptive services free."
2017.16-1140,0,35793,michael_p_farris,,767.76,768.2,"Well, Your Honor --"
2017.16-1140,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,768.2,769.84,Would that be -- would that be constitutional?
2017.16-1140,0,35793,michael_p_farris,,769.84,771.64,Not if it's under the targeted fashion.
2017.16-1140,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,790.12,798.44,"Counsel, can you please explain to me what the difference is between the licensed and unlicensed in terms of the services?"
2017.16-1140,0,35793,michael_p_farris,,798.44,799.52,Certainly.
2017.16-1140,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,799.52,801.64,And then I have a question based on that.
2017.16-1140,0,35793,michael_p_farris,,811.52,813.72,They're not providing any medical services as --
2017.16-1140,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,813.72,816.64,"Well, they are advertising themselves."
2017.16-1140,0,35793,michael_p_farris,,879.32,888.92,"Your Honor, to answer the first part of your question, our unlicensed facilities do not provide any medical services being defined as --"
2017.16-1140,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,888.92,892.16,But they do provide medical advice?
2017.16-1140,0,35793,michael_p_farris,,892.16,895.84,"Well, they -- they provide advice on the topic of pregnancy, which is basically --"
2017.16-1140,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,895.84,925.12,"So let me ask you, how's that different from what a doctor does? When you go in for a pregnancy, you see the doctor, and the doctor will describe, hopefully, the benefits of a pregnancy and perhaps its risk because, depending -- not all pregnancies are without complications. So this is consulting about a medical condition."
2017.16-1140,0,35793,michael_p_farris,,940.0,942.28,Your Honor --
2017.16-1140,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,942.28,955.2,"So if you're going to choose to talk to people about -- if you're an unlicensed facility, about pregnancy, why shouldn't you tell people that you're not a doctor?"
2017.16-1140,0,35793,michael_p_farris,,955.2,962.4,"Well, Your Honor, in -- in Casey, again, the -- the doctors that were being regulated were -- were the ones that were performing abortion."
2017.16-1140,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,978.48,994.96,"So is it okay for -- is it wrong for a state to tell agencies who give advice on immigration rights -- there's a couple of states like this -- who say if you are going to give advice on immigration matters, you better tell people you're not a lawyer."
2017.16-1140,0,35793,michael_p_farris,,996.64,998.16,"No, Your Honor."
2017.16-1140,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1019.76,1020.88,Now you're redefining medicine.
2017.16-1140,0,35793,michael_p_farris,,1020.88,1022.2,-- if they give a disclaimer.
2017.16-1140,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1022.2,1024.72,Medicine is defined by the state.
2017.16-1140,0,35793,michael_p_farris,,1026.8,1027.24,True.
2017.16-1140,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1028.84,1058.72,"So if you're giving people advice about pregnancy when you are not a licensed facility, please explain to me what is both misleading, incorrect, or suggestive in any way that a person has to do something like go to this doc -- to a doctor, how is it doing anything other than telling people that, despite how the picture looks on the website, this is not a medical facility?"
2017.16-1140,0,35793,michael_p_farris,,1058.72,1062.72,"Your Honor, it's illegal in California to practice medicine without a license."
2017.16-1140,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1071.72,1072.04,Mr. Farris --
2017.16-1140,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1072.04,1093.48,"Well, in this case I didn't go beyond the record to look on the Internet because I don't think we should do that, but I do have a hypothetical. What would happen if an unlicensed entity, unlicensed center, just had a billboard that said ""Choose Life."" Would they have to make the disclosure?"
2017.16-1140,0,35793,michael_p_farris,,1093.48,1094.12,"Yes, Your Honor."
2017.16-1140,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1094.12,1094.8,All right.
2017.16-1140,0,35793,michael_p_farris,,1099.84,1100.16,Right.
2017.16-1140,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1101.32,1102.76,29 words.
2017.16-1140,0,35793,michael_p_farris,,1102.76,1104.36,In -- in the same size font --
2017.16-1140,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1104.36,1106.08,"In the same size as ""Choose Life."""
2017.16-1140,0,35793,michael_p_farris,,1106.08,1108.8,"And in a number of languages, whatever is required by that county."
2017.16-1140,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1108.8,1112.2,It's -- we can ask -- we can ask the State of California.
2017.16-1140,0,35793,michael_p_farris,,1116.64,1118.4,I -- I don't think they'll disagree with that.
2017.16-1140,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1118.4,1124.88,Because it seems to me that that means that this is an undue burden in that instance and that should suffice to invalidate the statute.
2017.16-1140,0,35793,michael_p_farris,,1124.88,1126.44,"Yes, Your Honor, that's our position."
2017.16-1140,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1126.44,1134.4,"Mr. -- Mr. Farris, can I ask -- you've been pinning a lot when you've tried to distinguish Casey on the idea of informed consent."
2017.16-1140,0,35793,michael_p_farris,,1190.0,1196.52,"Your Honor, they are triggered by a medical intervention, rather than -- in this case, it's triggered by a discussion."
2017.16-1140,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1196.52,1204.28,"Well, I realize that that's a factual difference, that there's a doctor in the room, and in one case, there's not, but these are not informed consent requirements."
2017.16-1140,0,35793,michael_p_farris,,1204.28,1216.16,"Well, Your Honor, this Court held they were in Casey because they were components of informing women about the alternatives to the abortion process. I see that my time has got to the point that I'd like to reserve the balance for rebuttal."
2017.16-1140,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1216.96,1226.76,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Wall."
2017.16-1140,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1226.76,1239.88,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The First Amendment allows states to require truthful, factual disclosures about one's own goods or services."
2017.16-1140,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1256.24,1270.12,"What about -- what about if the -- the law were instead, if you are providing women's health services, you have to list all the services that you provide? And that would apply to everybody."
2017.16-1140,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1290.04,1290.28,Yes.
2017.16-1140,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1315.68,1319.84,I didn't understand the question to be along the lines that you've answered.
2017.16-1140,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1330.92,1341.76,"And that wasn't -- my question was, does everyone in the women's healthcare business -- if the state decides we want you to tell the public what you provide, what you provide, that's -- that's all."
2017.16-1140,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1341.76,1343.4,I may have misunderstood the question.
2017.16-1140,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1345.64,1345.92,Yes.
2017.16-1140,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1345.92,1348.36,We -- we think that it's permissible.
2017.16-1140,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1358.72,1364.32,"So, in your view, family planning clinics do not have to tell any woman about abortion -- adoption?"
2017.16-1140,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1364.32,1366.12,I think it depends on whether it's tied --
2017.16-1140,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1366.12,1368.0,"No, they don't provide adoption; it's not their service."
2017.16-1140,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1368.0,1374.28,"As Petitioners were saying, if it is just a center that counsels people on abortion in a general sense --"
2017.16-1140,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1374.28,1375.12,"No, it doesn't."
2017.16-1140,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1455.92,1458.28,"Justice Breyer, that is the crucial distinction."
2017.16-1140,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1469.6,1471.52,"Yeah, I kept -- it was about doctors."
2017.16-1140,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1472.56,1473.2,That's right.
2017.16-1140,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1473.2,1480.04,"But I think for most people you'd think family planning, you know, family planning."
2017.16-1140,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1500.08,1507.92,"Because, Justice Breyer, that -- when you are going in to have a procedure and you've got to make certain disclosures, that's a disclosure related to --"
2017.16-1140,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1507.92,1508.76,"I'm sorry, but isn't the --"
2017.16-1140,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1508.76,1510.92,"Maybe could we let him finish the answer, please?"
2017.16-1140,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1510.92,1513.92,That's a disclosure related to the service that you're providing.
2017.16-1140,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1518.96,1521.24,"But, Mr. Wall, why -- go ahead."
2017.16-1140,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1521.6,1523.0,You've got to make an informed choice.
2017.16-1140,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1536.88,1542.64,"But I think the question is why shouldn't there -- a state says, you know what, this is the regime we want."
2017.16-1140,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1578.92,1601.84,"Well, I think because once it's no longer tied to the specific goods or services that the -- the clinic or center or whomever is -- is providing, then the more we ought to be worried that they're making you just advertise what other people are doing. And this case is even one step beyond your hypothetical because it's not even saying to the clinics, say what you do and don't do. It's saying, look, we want people to know about services that the state provides and --"
2017.16-1140,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1601.84,1633.36,"Mr. Wall, how is that different than Casey? In Casey, we require doctors to hand out state-created materials telling the women about what services the state and others provided, adoption centers, fathers had to pay things. Now I think your distinction, and you keep repeating it, is these centers, I'm assuming both the licensed and unlicensed ones, are not doing procedures."
2017.16-1140,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1661.04,1661.28,So --
2017.16-1140,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1661.28,1679.04,"Both of them are doing medical-related procedures, and both are being asked -- the Chief said there's a distinction in not advertising someone else's services, but in Casey, we permitted it. So please explain to me again why there's a difference here."
2017.16-1140,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1679.04,1683.72,"So, Justice Sotomayor, I agree with everything you said in the back half there."
2017.16-1140,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1731.24,1731.56,I'm sorry --
2017.16-1140,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1731.56,1733.04,"Mr. Wall, before your --"
2017.16-1140,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1733.04,1735.2,-- and tell people about what it provides.
2017.16-1140,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1735.2,1780.92,"-- before your time expires, can I -- can I ask you something about your brief that -- that troubles me and, that is, the government's request that we recognize a new category of speech called professional speech, which is subject to a -- a lesser standard of review. I mean, this case is very important in itself, but adopting this new category of speech would have far-reaching consequences. And I -- I -- I'd like you to explain why that is consistent with Stevens and other cases where the Court has recently said we are not going to recognize any new categories of unprotected speech and how you would define the boundaries of professional speech. And there have been a lot of cases on -- there have been some cases on this in the lower courts."
2017.16-1140,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1808.48,1814.92,"So, Justice Alito, there's a lot there, and I just want to make a few points, and I think the Third Circuit's opinion in King does a pretty nice job of this."
2017.16-1140,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1881.0,1881.8,"Thank you, Mr. Wall."
2017.16-1140,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1881.8,1885.84,Thank you.
2017.16-1140,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1885.84,1887.8,Mr. Klein.
2017.16-1140,2,62966,joshua_a_klein,,1887.8,1924.92,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The interests served by the licensed disclosure is very much like that of the disclosure in Casey, promoting informed choice by a patient. More specifically, it allows -- it empowers the woman by explaining that her financial circumstance does not make her unable to access alternative and supplemental care, including full prenatal and delivery care that Petitioners do not themselves supply. And it gives her that knowledge in time to be useful, because pregnancy and medical care is extraordinarily time-critical."
2017.16-1140,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1924.92,1940.44,"There is a -- a sense when you read this statute, Mr. Klein, there's at least a question that arises as to whether this statute has been gerrymandered. So would you speak to that? Because if it has been gerrymandered, that's a serious issue."
2017.16-1140,2,62966,joshua_a_klein,,1952.88,1975.56,"Your Honor, the disclosure is targeted at women who seek free care for pregnancy, not at any particular viewpoint. And clinics that by their very licensing status provide free or sliding scale low-cost pregnancy care are the ones where those women are going to be found and where this information is immediately useful to them."
2017.16-1140,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1975.56,2003.52,"If you have a law that's neutral on its face, but then it has a lot of crazy exemptions, and when you apply all the exemptions, what you're left with is a very strange pattern and, gee, it turns out that just about the only clinics that are covered by this are pro-life clinics. Do you think it's possible to infer intentional discrimination in that situation?"
2017.16-1140,2,62966,joshua_a_klein,,2003.52,2004.12,Yes.
2017.16-1140,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2006.24,2006.48,Okay.
2017.16-1140,2,62966,joshua_a_klein,,2043.72,2060.96,"Well, Your Honor, that serves the purpose of having the disclosure mostly made in the context in which it's useful as opposed to being made in a lot of contexts where it's not. And this Court has said that legislatures should be encouraged to apply speech requirements more narrowly when they can rather than --"
2017.16-1140,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2060.96,2062.24,"Well, I mean, I don't understand that."
2017.16-1140,2,62966,joshua_a_klein,,2089.52,2105.04,"Your Honor, as a category, for-profit clinics do not seem to treat primarily women who need free and sliding-cost scale -- sliding-cost care in the same way. Now I will say it's always possible to imagine a new boundary for the law."
2017.16-1140,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2114.44,2117.68,What about individual doctors? Why are they exempt?
2017.16-1140,2,62966,joshua_a_klein,,2117.68,2130.08,"Your Honor, individual doctors specialize as a category in treating people who have a way to pay for care, whether they're already enrolled in Medicaid or health insurance or whether they just have the finances."
2017.16-1140,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2132.0,2136.52,"So, when you put all this together, you get a very suspicious pattern."
2017.16-1140,2,62966,joshua_a_klein,,2164.52,2166.64,"Your Honor, yes."
2017.16-1140,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2184.76,2187.6,So what is your position on that? What's the percentage?
2017.16-1140,2,62966,joshua_a_klein,,2187.6,2191.76,"Your Honor, the state does not have firm numbers on this."
2017.16-1140,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2215.04,2246.88,"Well, could you say -- could you say a few words about how these boundaries came about? In other words, you have these various lines that the statute draws and then it has these exemptions. And what was the state thinking -- I mean, you know, and I realize that the state -- you know, there are lots of people who were thinking different things, but is there -- give me a little bit more about your theory of the case even as to why these exemptions exist and why these lines are drawn. You've been saying, well, we go where the problem is."
2017.16-1140,2,62966,joshua_a_klein,,2256.16,2258.76,"Well, let me start with the question of what the problem is."
2017.16-1140,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2318.6,2344.28,"I mean, one way to think about how a statute like this gets enacted is to say we're -- you know, we're really concerned that there are low-income women, don't have a lot of access to information, don't realize what all their options are, want to make sure in general and across the board that they get the best information that's available to them. Another way to think about what the problem is and how a statute like this comes about is more targeted."
2017.16-1140,2,62966,joshua_a_klein,,2376.76,2380.36,"It's the first kind of statute, and the author's verbatim statements about this --"
2017.16-1140,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2380.36,2400.84,"Well, if it's the first kind of statute, then why shouldn't this Court take cognizance of the state's other available means to provide messages? If -- if it's about just ensuring that everyone has full information about their options, why should the state free-ride on a limited number of clinics to provide that information?"
2017.16-1140,2,62966,joshua_a_klein,,2400.84,2421.16,"Well, Your Honor, the state -- the legislature is aware of the shortcomings of other methods, as evidenced by the gap that has remained despite their efforts to publicize. Now what you described as -- as free-riding, I'd respectfully submit, is a permissible speech requirement in the professional context."
2017.16-1140,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2421.36,2433.68,"Well, but if you're trying to educate a class of -- of persons about their rights, it's -- it's pretty unusual to force a private speaker to do that for you under the First Amendment."
2017.16-1140,2,62966,joshua_a_klein,,2433.68,2446.52,"Your Honor, I don't think it's unusual to require a professional to explain alternatives, as -- or additional options that are available, as in Casey and also as in the laws that have been cited in our brief, the New York brief --"
2017.16-1140,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2446.52,2447.76,"Well, put -- put aside --"
2017.16-1140,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2447.76,2448.24,"Counsel, maybe --"
2017.16-1140,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2448.24,2448.68,I'm sorry.
2017.16-1140,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2448.68,2452.76,I'm sorry. Maybe you could finish your answer to Justice Kagan's question.
2017.16-1140,2,62966,joshua_a_klein,,2452.76,2454.12,Let me ask first what is the part --
2017.16-1140,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2454.12,2454.28,Yeah.
2017.16-1140,2,62966,joshua_a_klein,,2454.28,2456.08,-- of Justice Kagan's question she would like for me to --
2017.16-1140,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2456.08,2460.24,"Yeah, I don't -- I don't even remember which was the first kind of statute anymore and which was the second kind of statute."
2017.16-1140,2,62966,joshua_a_klein,,2492.36,2492.76,Right.
2017.16-1140,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2523.24,2524.72,"You see, that's what I gave up on."
2017.16-1140,2,62966,joshua_a_klein,,2602.8,2604.04,"Your Honor, we agree."
2017.16-1140,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2604.04,2604.68,You agree with that?
2017.16-1140,2,62966,joshua_a_klein,,2604.68,2610.92,"And the record at the preliminary injunction stage, which is all this concerns, was not sufficient to support an injunction."
2017.16-1140,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2617.32,2646.96,"Mr. Klein, can we go back to the question Justice Kennedy asked the other side, which was for you to affirm or disaffirm that if one of these facilities wrote an ad that just said pro-life and put their name, it appears as if the law would require them to have the statement ""This is not a medical facility"" in 48-point font?"
2017.16-1140,2,62966,joshua_a_klein,,2646.96,2665.24,"I don't think so, Your Honor, unless the facility was -- I mean, what subjects a facility to the law, if it's unlicensed, is -- are -- this is on page 79a of the Petitioners' appendix, are things like offering obstetric ultrasounds, sonograms --"
2017.16-1140,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2665.24,2665.76,Right.
2017.16-1140,2,62966,joshua_a_klein,,2697.36,2698.88,"I don't think so, Your Honor."
2017.16-1140,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2716.12,2732.52,"So what additional, what, ultrasounds or discussion of family planning, what more would it take to require the adoption center to be covered? Any one of the ones that you have listed for licensed centers?"
2017.16-1140,2,62966,joshua_a_klein,,2732.52,2738.4,"In other words, what would make it subjected to the same kind of requirement as a licensed center?"
2017.16-1140,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2738.4,2738.72,Yeah.
2017.16-1140,2,62966,joshua_a_klein,,2749.16,2752.16,I don't think the ultrasounds per se make the difference.
2017.16-1140,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2760.84,2766.64,"Like pregnancy testing, if -- if the adoption center also provided pregnancy testing, could you cover them?"
2017.16-1140,2,62966,joshua_a_klein,,2766.64,2780.64,"If it provided it as a -- as a licensed medical service through licensed medical providers, then the state would have to justify the sufficiently important state interest with the -- and the --"
2017.16-1140,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2780.64,2791.72,"What's your -- what's your answer, though? It provides two services, adoption and pregnancy testing. Could you impose the disclosure requirement on that facility?"
2017.16-1140,2,62966,joshua_a_klein,,2791.72,2794.8,"Your Honor, I think it would be much more difficult to justify here."
2017.16-1140,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2794.8,2797.0,I know. That's why I'm asking the question. (Laughter.)
2017.16-1140,2,62966,joshua_a_klein,,2797.0,2797.16,Right.
2017.16-1140,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2797.16,2800.84,I'm trying to figure out -- I'm trying to figure out the limits of your argument.
2017.16-1140,2,62966,joshua_a_klein,,2818.6,2821.68,"Through a licensed provider, yes, they could, except --"
2017.16-1140,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2821.68,2822.8,"No, that's all they do."
2017.16-1140,2,62966,joshua_a_klein,,2839.28,2841.32,"On reflection, I think probably not."
2017.16-1140,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2850.96,2891.36,"Mr. Klein, can we go back to my question? I have read the law with respect to facility, and it requires a facility to do one of -- two of four things before it qualifies under the law. So abortion -- you appear right that they have to, one, offer ultrasounds, obstetrics, sonograms, or prenatal care, pregnancy -- or pregnancy testing or diagnosis or, three, prenatal monogram tests or pregnancy and, four, collect health data."
2017.16-1140,2,62966,joshua_a_klein,,2913.68,2916.96,"And the answer is no, they're not required to."
2017.16-1140,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2918.0,2921.36,Because they're not offering in the advertising one of these services?
2017.16-1140,2,62966,joshua_a_klein,,2921.36,2923.92,"Because they're not -- right, they're not doing two of the --"
2017.16-1140,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2923.92,2927.16,"No, that's not -- that's not -- show me where that is in the statute."
2017.16-1140,2,62966,joshua_a_klein,,2938.24,2943.04,"But, in order to be a covered unlicensed facility, it has to do two or more of the list of things."
2017.16-1140,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2943.04,2944.2,"Yes, it has to do those things."
2017.16-1140,2,62966,joshua_a_klein,,2955.52,2960.88,"If it -- yes, in that circumstance, they may be required to do that. And --"
2017.16-1140,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2960.88,2969.84,"Do you agree that mandating speech that the speaker would not otherwise give -- indeed, does not agree with -- alters the content of the message?"
2017.16-1140,2,62966,joshua_a_klein,,2969.84,2971.96,"Yes, it does, Your Honor."
2017.16-1140,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2971.96,2972.2,All right.
2017.16-1140,2,62966,joshua_a_klein,,2982.2,3007.64,"Yes, Your Honor, because the criteria are designed not to see who is providing medical services, that's taken care of by our unlicensed practice law, it is designed to address instances where the services that are offered and provided could make a woman believe that she is going to have -- be accessing medical services and is spending her time and resources to -- to do that and is unable to evaluate what she is doing."
2017.16-1140,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3007.64,3025.84,"Now if we uphold your -- your argument, if we agree with your argument, could the state then amend its statute and say that any evangelical group that has a seven-day rally for pro life has to give required information of this sort?"
2017.16-1140,2,62966,joshua_a_klein,,3025.84,3030.44,"No, Your Honor, I don't think that would follow."
2017.16-1140,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3030.44,3030.76,Why not?
2017.16-1140,2,62966,joshua_a_klein,,3030.76,3035.76,"Well, and even putting aside the -- the free exercise targeting, the --"
2017.16-1140,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3035.76,3040.2,"Oh, so religion is not a part of this calculus in the case that you have?"
2017.16-1140,2,62966,joshua_a_klein,,3040.2,3044.64,"Well, Your Honor, your hypothetical statute did target evangelical groups."
2017.16-1140,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3049.24,3051.4,It didn't target it. It included it.
2017.16-1140,2,62966,joshua_a_klein,,3051.4,3069.04,"So I think the statute is reasonably read and applied in -- in recognition of its purposes, which are the purpose to prevent women from making their decisions about where to go based on mistake and confusion about what's offered."
2017.16-1140,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3071.0,3071.28,May I ask --
2017.16-1140,2,62966,joshua_a_klein,,3071.28,3072.52,"Now, if in --"
2017.16-1140,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3072.52,3079.96,-- the -- there was a question raised about 13 different languages and what burden that -- that would be.
2017.16-1140,2,62966,joshua_a_klein,,3096.4,3111.72,"Your -- Your Honor, if the statute -- if in application to a kind of ad that the centers otherwise have been running and would run, if it makes it too burdensome to place those ads, the statute would be unconstitutional as applied to that."
2017.16-1140,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3111.92,3115.44,"Well, what is the situation for Los Angeles County? This is California law."
2017.16-1140,2,62966,joshua_a_klein,,3129.92,3131.48,It would be 13.
2017.16-1140,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3145.32,3146.16,What kind of ad --
2017.16-1140,2,62966,joshua_a_klein,,3146.16,3147.68,-- some sort of demonstration.
2017.16-1140,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3147.68,3153.08,-- if it's -- what kind of an ad would -- as to what type of ad would that not be unconstitutional?
2017.16-1140,2,62966,joshua_a_klein,,3153.08,3159.48,"Well, Your Honor, there is nothing in the record about what ads these plaintiffs do, in fact, run."
2017.16-1140,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3167.44,3172.0,"So you want me to have a remand for them to tell the court what a billboard is, I -- because I don't know that?"
2017.16-1140,2,62966,joshua_a_klein,,3172.0,3172.2,Your Honor --
2017.16-1140,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3172.2,3177.36,"There is a lot of things we don't know, but I think we know what a billboard is. (Laughter.)"

2017.16-1140,2,62966,joshua_a_klein,,3208.72,3210.56,I'm not aware that the state has.
2017.16-1140,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3234.56,3242.4,"But counsel, it would have the virtue of applying evenly to all persons and all industries in a law that is very familiar."

2017.16-1140,2,62966,joshua_a_klein,,3309.68,3351.76,"For -- for the same reason that it wasn't a necessary step in Casey, because in the regulation of professional speech, the government, given the close and reliant relationship that the patient has on her physician, can require a certain amount of speech to ensure that the -- that the patient makes informed decisions about very important matters. The main difference from Casey is how much less burdensome this disclosure is because there's more flexibility in how it can be delivered and because it's only giving a phone number for the patient to call and get information from the government, rather than requiring the physician to herself hand over a complete state-written pamphlet, which is what the disclosure in Casey required."
2017.16-1140,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3351.76,3370.48,"Would it be fair to say -- and I still don't have a full answer to my question -- all right, pro-life, nothing else, an unlicensed facility, it meets all of the criteria, has an ad that says just ""pro-life"" and puts its name."
2017.16-1140,2,62966,joshua_a_klein,,3373.96,3376.4,"Yes, if it meets the other criteria."
2017.16-1140,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3378.12,3391.64,That seems to me more burdensome and wrong because it's not tied to an advertisement that is promoting medical services.
2017.16-1140,2,62966,joshua_a_klein,,3391.64,3406.16,"May I continue? It's possible that that kind of as-applied challenge would result in invalidating that application, but as in Ayadi, injunctive relief addresses particular problems."
2017.16-1140,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3407.08,3412.16,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Farris, you have five minutes remaining."
2017.16-1140,3,35793,michael_p_farris,,3412.16,3460.68,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. I would like to first address Justice Kagan's concern about the gerrymandering issue. On page 5 of our reply brief in Note 2, we point out the state's website for where the state tells low-income women how they can go to private doctors and get information or get services for pregnancy. Yet those doctors are all exempt from the -- from this ad -- this Act, as are all non-profit clinics that have the general kind of practice that Justice Alito's question described. As to the ad burden, the amicus Heartbeat International on page 24 of their brief gave a mock-up of what an ad would look like when you have simply pregnancy questions and a phone number, and all the -- the languages required in Los Angeles County. That's what it would look like."
2017.16-1140,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3472.96,3478.0,The answer was that this was not brought up in this case until now --
2017.16-1140,3,35793,michael_p_farris,,3478.0,3478.56,Your Honor --
2017.16-1140,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3478.56,3480.0,-- and it should be aired below.
2017.16-1140,3,35793,michael_p_farris,,3480.0,3481.96,"Your Honor, that's not correct."
2017.16-1140,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3528.6,3535.92,"I mean, that's -- since it was mine, it's -- it's -- it's you have to be a professional group giving advice in a professional way."
2017.16-1140,3,35793,michael_p_farris,,3539.6,3540.56,But --
2017.16-1140,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3540.56,3545.32,"It has to do -- and -- and there are things called family planning clinics, et cetera."
2017.16-1140,3,35793,michael_p_farris,,3545.32,3581.44,"Certainly, Your Honor. And so taking it on a narrow and then a broader construction, the narrow construction, as I understood your hypothetical, was a family planning center that didn't actually perform abortions but did all the other services. I believe it would be unconstitutional in a pro-life state to require that center because -- to give a pro-life kind of disclaimer that's -- that was required in Pennsylvania because they're not doing anything that relates to the practice of medicine in that context. But taking the broader construction, if we're not going to gerrymander this and say: All doctors who treat pregnant women have to give all the options."
2017.16-1140,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3607.6,3608.92,"Thank you, counsel."
