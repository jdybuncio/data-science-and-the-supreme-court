2014.13-1174,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,6.754,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 13-1174, Gelboim v. Bank of America."
2014.13-1174,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,7.554,10.289,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
2014.13-1174,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,78.35,93.126,"Could you tell me, first, what difference there is, if any, pursuant to your reasons, that would not apply to a consolidated case for all purposes, number one?"
2014.13-1174,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,107.285,111.421,"As to the first, there are different forms of consolidation."
2014.13-1174,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,133.1,135.369,"That's, frankly, not the majority of the cases."
2014.13-1174,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,136.036,137.552,That doesn't happen most of the time.
2014.13-1174,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,138.071,139.454,--In -- in most of the MDLs--
2014.13-1174,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,139.454,139.771,Yes.
2014.13-1174,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,139.771,145.592,"--most of the cases retain their individual character, even though they're consolidated for all purposes."
2014.13-1174,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,162.62,166.756,One preliminary point and then the question about what our rule produces.
2014.13-1174,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,232.95,236.752,"Well, does the 150-day provision kick in?"
2014.13-1174,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,251.428,252.928,"--Two things, Mr. Chief Justice."
2014.13-1174,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,259.533,264.085,Doesn't Rule 58 say unless otherwise provided?
2014.13-1174,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,264.085,264.685,--Yes.
2014.13-1174,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,265.421,272.508,So they -- automatic entry of judgment doesn't happen if the district judge specifically otherwise provides.
2014.13-1174,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,272.508,273.777,--That is correct.
2014.13-1174,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,290.237,291.07,"Oh, we could do it ourselves."
2014.13-1174,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,291.572,303.044,"--The MDL litigation -- as you well could -- the MDL litigation in the Chocolate litigation, there the district court used the tool that we're discussing right now."
2014.13-1174,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,308.798,309.616,How do you do that?
2014.13-1174,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,313.902,317.454,There is a--
2014.13-1174,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,317.904,336.765,"The rule does say that the clerk, once the -- once the judge denies all relief, he says to you or somebody, I deny all relief in your case, then the clerk is supposed to just enter the judgment."
2014.13-1174,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,336.765,337.517,With one--
2014.13-1174,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,337.517,341.402,So how -- how is the judge supposed to not do that?
2014.13-1174,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,341.402,345.621,--Just noting that I do want to return to the other tools the district court has.
2014.13-1174,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,350.075,351.308,Why not just answer what I just asked you.
2014.13-1174,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,351.308,351.775,--Okay.
2014.13-1174,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,354.81,355.229,Yeah.
2014.13-1174,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,355.229,362.816,--that the district court -- and this is the provision Justice Ginsburg is talking about -- the district court may direct the clerk not to enter a judgment.
2014.13-1174,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,363.316,363.482,"Oh, I get it."
2014.13-1174,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,370.753,371.153,--Yes.
2014.13-1174,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,371.153,374.624,--who actually don't have to look these up because every day they work with them.
2014.13-1174,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,374.624,376.507,"Well, they are actually -- they are not--"
2014.13-1174,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,376.507,380.442,"And tell us your rule -- if we agree with you, we are going to produce a mess."
2014.13-1174,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,400.905,401.274,--Okay.
2014.13-1174,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,431.46,433.126,Has -- has that happened to a lot of district judge?
2014.13-1174,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,456.859,459.878,There is an MDL in which this happened.
2014.13-1174,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,459.878,460.228,What?
2014.13-1174,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,460.228,461.163,It is the Chocolate MDL.
2014.13-1174,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,461.163,462.53,All right.
2014.13-1174,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,462.53,466.548,"Well, the reason it doesn't happen very often, Justice Breyer, is this problem doesn't happen very often."
2014.13-1174,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,468.65,469.067,Okay.
2014.13-1174,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,471.769,472.236,--No.
2014.13-1174,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,472.236,474.221,"And then in the future, no one else is--"
2014.13-1174,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,474.221,476.505,"Justice Breyer, that is not correct."
2014.13-1174,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,481.893,482.293,--54.
2014.13-1174,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,482.293,486.628,"Now, they can do it under 54 or they can enter a final judgment in the case."
2014.13-1174,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,493.299,498.503,"Mr. Goldstein, as -- as your view of the case is 54(b) would not be appropriate--"
2014.13-1174,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,498.503,498.786,Yes.
2014.13-1174,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,498.786,503.657,"--when the -- when the judge says, I dismiss this claim entirely."
2014.13-1174,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,518.416,519.016,That's correct.
2014.13-1174,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,542.448,550.554,"But -- but your -- your answer is that, oh, well, the district judge can find plenty of ways, disingenuously perhaps, to say this isn't going to be entered yet, we're just going to wait."
2014.13-1174,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,565.147,566.43,"Well, Justice Kennedy, we don't think it's--"
2014.13-1174,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,566.43,569.282,It seems to me you're asking the judge to be almost disingenuous.
2014.13-1174,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,569.282,585.211,"--Well, we disagree for the following reason, and that is, if the point of Mr. Waxman's side is that district judges need discretion to decide when to enter judgments, whether they're 54(b), partial final judgments, or final judgments under Rule 58, the discretion should be the same."
2014.13-1174,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,590.679,595.833,Are you then saying that there's no practical difference between your position and Mr. Waxman's position?
2014.13-1174,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,599.401,599.72,--Yes.
2014.13-1174,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,599.72,600.786,And that's an important point.
2014.13-1174,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,600.786,601.136,Yes.
2014.13-1174,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,601.136,606.124,"It's important to get the rules right, whether it's Rule 54 or something else."
2014.13-1174,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,609.509,611.528,I'm saying there's little practical difference.
2014.13-1174,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,628.054,629.74,There's one huge difference.
2014.13-1174,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,653.105,659.859,"The reason it's not a huge difference, Justice Ginsburg, is that the district court doesn't have to enter a final judgment."
2014.13-1174,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,702.636,709.025,"I don't think this court of appeals said as a matter of its discretion, and that was one thing that puzzled me about your presentation."
2014.13-1174,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,715.096,715.346,--Ah.
2014.13-1174,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,737.442,738.794,They said we had no jurisdiction.
2014.13-1174,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,738.794,740.044,"Right, they did."
2014.13-1174,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,746.398,755.421,"They said they -- they -- there was a -- there's a phrase that the Second Circuit uses, and it -- something to the effect of an extraordinary case, an exceptional case."
2014.13-1174,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,755.421,756.339,"Yes, that's correct."
2014.13-1174,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,756.706,759.225,But their main rule is there's no jurisdiction.
2014.13-1174,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,759.225,759.525,Right.
2014.13-1174,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,770.53,775.917,Can we go back to Justice Kennedy's question about the disingenuous nature of this?
2014.13-1174,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,775.917,776.217,--Yeah.
2014.13-1174,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,776.217,779.552,"So we write an opinion and say, no, it's a final judgment."
2014.13-1174,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,780.454,780.771,Yes.
2014.13-1174,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,780.771,784.606,"But district courts, you have other tools not to enter the judgment?"
2014.13-1174,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,784.606,784.956,Yes.
2014.13-1174,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,784.956,785.792,You can delay it?
2014.13-1174,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,785.792,786.458,I--
2014.13-1174,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,786.458,792.429,That -- that does sound like all we're saying that this is a very formalistic ruling.
2014.13-1174,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,800.383,801.352,--It is--
2014.13-1174,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,801.352,804.069,--and that efficiency is part of the calculus?
2014.13-1174,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,804.069,814.025,"--The Court has said that there is a practical inquiry in one important respect, and that is the Court has broadened the notion of what could be an appealable final judgment."
2014.13-1174,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,822.981,825.667,"That is, if you look at it as narrowly as you do."
2014.13-1174,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,825.667,831.821,"--Your Honor, let me just -- in the MDL, these cases were brought together because there was a common factual allegation."
2014.13-1174,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,842.31,846.83,"But you asked -- you asked to be part of the MDL case, didn't you?"
2014.13-1174,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,846.83,847.863,"--Yes, that's correct."
2014.13-1174,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,865.642,871.479,"Mr. -- Mr. Goldstein, following up the -- what has been called disingenuous."
2014.13-1174,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,880.318,881.002,--Yes.
2014.13-1174,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,881.002,883.02,That party still is in the case--
2014.13-1174,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,883.02,883.387,Yes.
2014.13-1174,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,883.387,885.555,--and can participate in discovery.
2014.13-1174,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,897.013,897.296,Right.
2014.13-1174,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,897.296,904.533,--and yet I have to wait six years or however -- however long the MDL proceedings go on.
2014.13-1174,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,907.902,908.737,Yes.
2014.13-1174,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,948.129,948.346,I don't understand that.
2014.13-1174,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,959.087,960.204,"--I'm sorry, Your Honor, no--"
2014.13-1174,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,960.204,963.906,If he can say it for as long as he thinks is appropriate--
2014.13-1174,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,963.906,964.156,--Yes.
2014.13-1174,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,964.156,966.191,--what's the difference?
2014.13-1174,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,966.191,968.125,What's the practical difference between the parties?
2014.13-1174,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,968.125,970.042,In terms of the effect on you.
2014.13-1174,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,972.761,973.946,That's -- that is correct.
2014.13-1174,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,988.623,995.86,"Yeah, but what they tell us, these judges, who are experienced, I stress, on pages 12 and 13,"
2014.13-1174,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1039.639,1041.241,"--That is not correct, Justice Breyer."
2014.13-1174,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1041.657,1042.991,So are they wrong or I'm not reading it right?
2014.13-1174,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1043.607,1051.862,"--They -- there is some -- a piece of the puzzle that's missing, and that is that ours is the rule that for decades has been applied in the great majority of the country."
2014.13-1174,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1052.112,1071.61,"In 54 -- in -- in the majority of the country judges have said, when we have four cases in front of us, we have consolidated and we wish to dismiss one but keep the others going, they have said, we cannot use 54(b)."
2014.13-1174,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1073.16,1073.962,"--No, Justice Breyer."
2014.13-1174,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1078.264,1079.014,I'm not talking about MDL.
2014.13-1174,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1081.566,1084.851,"--Well, if it's consolidated for all purposes, that's quite different."
2014.13-1174,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1085.218,1085.52,Okay.
2014.13-1174,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1085.52,1086.036,--a single action.
2014.13-1174,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1086.036,1086.536,Okay.
2014.13-1174,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1087.303,1087.62,Okay.
2014.13-1174,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1117.189,1119.424,"But if I could understand, Mr. Goldstein, what you're saying."
2014.13-1174,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1134.766,1137.318,The answer to that question is I am agnostic on it.
2014.13-1174,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1220.889,1222.991,Doesn't -- doesn't it become clear once we announce it?
2014.13-1174,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1230.997,1231.714,It does not.
2014.13-1174,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1231.714,1232.58,And there is an order.
2014.13-1174,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1235.149,1235.882,Justice--
2014.13-1174,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1235.882,1243.155,"--and sending the cases that are going to be sent back and the ones who are finalized, those are finalized."
2014.13-1174,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1243.155,1243.922,--Here's what happens.
2014.13-1174,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1319.488,1337.366,"If -- if there's an MDL for pretrial purposes and the district court thinks that one -- that some cases like yours just should not proceed, does the district judge have authority on its own to dismiss those few cases from the MDL?"
2014.13-1174,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1340.901,1346.639,The district judge cannot -- the district judge can dismiss cases in the MDL and frequently does.
2014.13-1174,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1352.209,1352.859,That's my question.
2014.13-1174,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1352.859,1355.661,--They will send a recommendation to the JPML.
2014.13-1174,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1453.841,1454.525,"Thank you, counsel."
2014.13-1174,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1461.512,1463.947,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"

2014.13-1174,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1528.307,1530.425,And that is Petitioner's brief.
2014.13-1174,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1530.425,1540.364,"--The text of 54(b) refers to a separate appeal for a claim, counterclaim, cross-claim, or third-party claim."
2014.13-1174,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1563.13,1563.88,Yes.
2014.13-1174,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1563.88,1566.582,On that theory it could fit within 54(b).
2014.13-1174,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1571.569,1572.286,"No, I don't."
2014.13-1174,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1580.591,1587.011,"Well, how did -- where do we look to find that -- that his complaint became part of a single action?"
2014.13-1174,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1587.011,1587.778,"Well, the--"
2014.13-1174,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1587.778,1592.063,The MDL statute doesn't -- doesn't make any reference to that.
2014.13-1174,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1592.815,1593.482,--Yes.
2014.13-1174,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1602.188,1611.561,"Where they remain separate actions, and Rule 54(b) was designed for a single action with multiple claims."
2014.13-1174,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1611.561,1612.494,--And my--
2014.13-1174,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1612.494,1626.737,"I don't see a single reference in the rule, nothing by the advisory committee that so much as suggests that a consolidation for pretrial purposes only makes it one action for purposes of 54(b)."
2014.13-1174,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1626.737,1658.556,"--Let me -- before I get to the -- to the terminology, let me just underscore -- I realize this may be waving a red flag in front of this body, but there -- not a single court or commentator anywhere has suggested that in consolidated cases, whether they are -- that -- that are all consolidated under Rule 42 whether they come in by an MDL or not, that -- that action refers to the consolidated proceedings for such a length as they are consolidated."
2014.13-1174,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1677.019,1678.069,"Well, you know, maybe they're wrong."
2014.13-1174,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1678.069,1679.086,"Now, it's possible that everyone is wrong."
2014.13-1174,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1679.086,1688.375,"Yes, maybe they are wrong, Mr. Waxman, because I mean, they're -- they're obviously looking for a certain kind of flexibility, which is important, and which I take it both sides have agreed is important."
2014.13-1174,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1709.272,1713.091,I think that is quite incorrect as an historical matter.
2014.13-1174,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1765.275,1765.658,But in this--
2014.13-1174,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1765.658,1766.125,Not any--
2014.13-1174,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1766.125,1766.741,--were not.
2014.13-1174,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1766.741,1773.129,"--But in this -- in this case, at the end of the day, the actions are, in effect, unconsolidated."
2014.13-1174,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1798.512,1804.066,That -- that is exactly the dynamic for whatever length of time the consolidation occurs.
2014.13-1174,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1804.066,1815.874,"But his last point, this in my mind is that if we take your route -- one problem with his route -- one problem with your route is you have to muck around with the word “ action ”."
2014.13-1174,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1882.033,1885.652,"Well, let me just make -- I have your question firmly in mind."
2014.13-1174,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1903.097,1914.238,"--Well, that's because the parties, either they get dismissed pretrial, or they settle, or the parties agree that the transferee court can be the trial court."
2014.13-1174,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1926.445,1928.814,That -- that's--
2014.13-1174,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1928.814,1938.17,And I think it was quite clear that Congress didn't give multidistrict forum the option to be the trial court.
2014.13-1174,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1938.17,1940.039,"--Justice Ginsburg, I totally agree."
2014.13-1174,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1981.616,1990.222,"But these statutes do not speak of consolidation of cases, they speak of consolidated proceedings."
2014.13-1174,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2009.785,2012.82,"I'm not quibbling at all, Justice Scalia, with the language."
2014.13-1174,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2018.405,2019.074,It makes a big difference.
2014.13-1174,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2019.074,2024.393,"--Well, the -- I don't -- I think it doesn't really make a big difference."
2014.13-1174,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2040.488,2052.812,"So please answer Justice Breyer's question, because that is trouble me as well, at what moment, and if it's a notation from -- if it's a settled case, when does he appeal?"
2014.13-1174,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2052.812,2068.572,"--The -- the -- the appeal period runs from the time that all of the -- that there is -- that all of the other consolidated proceedings, cases, have resolved or been transferred, and so--"
2014.13-1174,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2068.572,2069.672,What does he appeal from?
2014.13-1174,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2069.955,2070.388,--Excuse me?
2014.13-1174,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2070.388,2080.38,"--There is an awkwardness here, because he's not appealing from the judgment entered on behalf of or against the other parties."
2014.13-1174,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2080.38,2085.265,"Let's be very, very clear about what he says he's appealing from."
2014.13-1174,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2104.511,2111.082,"He has the word of the district judge you have an appeal of right, that's what she said."
2014.13-1174,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2111.082,2141.101,"Well, what she said in adjudicating the request by other parties for a 54(b) certification, this is on Page 220 of the petition appendix is that these plaintiffs and the Schwab plaintiffs have an appeal of right, there is no question that she misapprehended the rule in the Second Circuit that just because she had dismissed all of the claims in their suit they have an appeal of right."
2014.13-1174,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2142.703,2151.14,"She thought that she needed to the to do the 54(b) for the other cases that had more than one claim, not just the antitrust claim."
2014.13-1174,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2151.14,2195.336,"--Correct, and let me say something about their subsequent motion under -- the Gelboim subsequent motion under 54(b) after the dismissal for lack of jurisdiction by the court of appeals, but first point out to you that the order that she's referring to, 43, which says that the case is terminated pursuant to instructions from chambers, you know, I wondered, well, why isn't there anything in the docket that in fact terminates it, and the answer is on page -- pages 15 through 19 of the joint appendix where, as you can see on Page 19, she has reissued the same memorandum and order as modified, three days later."
2014.13-1174,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2207.813,2210.764,"Well, then you're just -- let's go back to my question."
2014.13-1174,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2250.406,2251.323,"--That's right, yes."
2014.13-1174,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2251.323,2268.301,"Now, what I said Watts, some time ago, that I thought he had a point, is in such a case, if we treat the consolidation of approximate proceedings like we treat a consolidation of cases without the multidistrict, he cannot appeal from that piece of paper."
2014.13-1174,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2292.918,2296.636,The same piece of paper that he lacks even to this day.
2014.13-1174,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2296.636,2298.02,That's a red herring at the moment.
2014.13-1174,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2298.02,2301.622,Let me at least finish my sentence.
2014.13-1174,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2341.665,2349.438,"Mr. Waxman, have you made this argument before, did you make this argument in opposition to the petition for certiorari, namely that there was no final judgment here."
2014.13-1174,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2349.438,2361.246,"We did, and it got discouraged when the Court granted cert. But I mean, I'm not here just making a jurisdictional argument, my point in this case is--"
2014.13-1174,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2361.246,2368.583,"Mr. Waxman, the Second Circuit didn't think that there was a problem because the -- a judgment hadn't been entered."
2014.13-1174,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2403.24,2411.079,"--Justice Ginsburg, I respectfully suggest that you're mistaken in reading what the Second Circuit said."
2014.13-1174,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2438.963,2445.917,Are you telling me that the Second Circuit doesn't have that rule if there is a piece of paper that says judgment on it?
2014.13-1174,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2445.917,2485.21,"--The piece of -- the Second Circuit's rule, which is the rule we think that ought to be applied throughout the country is that the -- when there is -- when all of the claims of a party or, in a -- in any multi claim, multidistrict proceeding, whether it's a single consolidated complaint or consolidated proceedings, judgment is entered by district courts when a rule 54(b)(1) certification is made, or, assuming the court of appeals agrees, when there is a recommendation under section 1292(b)."
2014.13-1174,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2485.66,2486.31,But aren't--
2014.13-1174,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2486.31,2493.982,--the way courts issue judgments during the period of consolidation when the other cases are proceeding.
2014.13-1174,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2493.982,2498.634,"Well, 1292(b) can't be applicable here."
2014.13-1174,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2498.634,2499.636,"No, it's not."
2014.13-1174,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2499.636,2504.271,1292(b) is when you don't have a final judgment.

2014.13-1174,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2555.571,2556.337,"--Yes, but that's quite different."
2014.13-1174,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2583.821,2587.023,"Well, I guess, you know, we can speculate about what they meant."
2014.13-1174,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2598.081,2601.283,"Well, I -- that's a very strange way to read that."
2014.13-1174,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2601.283,2602.016,"I mean, our look--"
2014.13-1174,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2602.016,2603.116,Given the opinion of--
2014.13-1174,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2603.116,2633.901,"--My case isn't turning on what actually happened here, but I think in thinking about the meaning of “ final decision ” under 1291, which doesn't use the word “ action ” what a final decision is, with an eye toward what is a healthy legal system, this case, I think -- I think it's important to focus on just the features of this case as one of many, many examples why the rule that they're advocating is not correct."
2014.13-1174,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2633.901,2646.878,"You raised the argument before us this morning that there wasn't a final judgment and Petitioner argues that there was under Rule 58(c)(2)(b) and you didn't address that, I believe, in your brief."
2014.13-1174,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2649.111,2653.649,58(c)(2)(b).
2014.13-1174,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2765.555,2767.255,"Well, that would seem to be very efficient."
2014.13-1174,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2785.785,2791.189,"--Just to be clear, Mr. Chief Justice, what she's considering are not requests to reconsider."
2014.13-1174,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2805.03,2805.28,Okay.
2014.13-1174,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2811.603,2813.386,"That's right, although--"
2014.13-1174,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2813.386,2814.971,Then what problem is it to appeal?
2014.13-1174,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2814.971,2815.721,--Excuse me?
2014.13-1174,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2815.721,2818.607,Then what's the problem with going ahead with the Gelboim appeal?
2014.13-1174,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2818.607,2826.945,"Well, the problem with going ahead with the Gelboim appeal is the inefficiency and the lack -- and the threat to the--"
2014.13-1174,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2826.945,2827.828,But it's a different reason.
2014.13-1174,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2842.388,2842.755,"--No, they do."
2014.13-1174,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2866.838,2879.497,"Well, I think what the Chief Justice is indicating is to the extent that the issues, the claims are the same, the efficiency argument can cut both ways; to the extent that the claims are different, what's the problem with an appeal?"
2014.13-1174,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2879.497,2897.123,"Well, the -- the court of appeals is being asked to consider the -- the sufficiency of the allegations as to antitrust injury with respect to a common core of -- of -- of alleged facts, a course of conduct, and different parties--"
2014.13-1174,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2897.123,2900.075,"But is that the only thing, that they're going to have to learn the facts twice?"
2014.13-1174,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2900.075,2906.481,"--Well, there -- look, you can always argue that there are certain efficiencies in taking immediate piecemeal appeals."
2014.13-1174,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2918.305,2944.773,"But if the district judge had been right the first time, she said I have a claim that's totally been dismissed, it's out, then there are these other people that have antitrust claims and other claims, so what I'm going to do is this, final judgment for the one that has no other claims, 54(b) on the antitrust claims for the others so that the Second Circuit will then hear antitrust standing all at once."
2014.13-1174,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2944.773,2963.934,"--And the -- the point is that there are other parties in the consolidated pre -- pleadings that say that their claims and their Plaintiffs stand in a different position under the Sherman Act with respect to antitrust injury than Gelboim does, and why wouldn't a healthy system--"
2014.13-1174,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2963.934,2973.707,"Well, the district judge obviously didn't think so because she said, I'm -- one party has an appeal of right and I am going to do the 54(b) order for the others."
2014.13-1174,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2973.707,2980.363,"--She didn't consider, Justice Ginsburg, the seven parties that are now claiming that they are different."
2014.13-1174,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3070.187,3075.507,"Well, there's efficiencies -- there's efficiency to the system and you have arguments about that, but there's also fairness to the parties."
2014.13-1174,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3084.196,3092.286,"--Well, the -- the -- it is a feature of the rule against piecemeal litigation that individual litigants sometimes have to wait."
2014.13-1174,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3093.402,3096.854,That just kind of begs the question whether this is piecemeal or not for these people.
2014.13-1174,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3096.854,3126.123,"--Well, I think here's the point, there is no case, they have found not a single case in 46 years of MDL litigation where any party in their position or a similar position has had to wait an inordinate amount of time and that is because in appropriate cases, whether the cases are consolidated for all purposes or some limited purpose, the courts exercised their discretion under Rule 54(b)."
2014.13-1174,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3141.983,3144.652,"Well, then that sort of contradicts what you said before."

2014.13-1174,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3209.344,3209.977,--the advantage of--
2014.13-1174,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3209.977,3212.279,--What is obscure about a stay?

2014.13-1174,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3223.871,3224.487,--obscure.
2014.13-1174,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3224.487,3225.289,--Here's the difference.
