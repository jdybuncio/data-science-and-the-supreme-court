1979.79-253,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,11.376,"We'll hear arguments first this morning in Number 79-253, Marshall, the Secretary of Labor against Jerrico, Incorporated."
1979.79-253,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,15.231,16.859,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1979.79-253,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,193.471,202.002,Is there any reason why he couldn't raise that on a -- at an earlier stage in -- within the framework of this case?
1979.79-253,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,202.002,211.265,"Appellee could, we believe, have sought judicial review of the Administrative Law Judge's assessment of the $18,500 and raised this constitutional objection as well as any other objections --"
1979.79-253,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,211.265,216.309,Without having raised it before the Administrative Law Judge.
1979.79-253,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,216.309,226.275,"It -- it was raised -- I don't believe it was raised before the Administrative Law Judge, although the Administrative Law Judge could not have given relief on that ground, so I'm not sure that that precludes raising it."
1979.79-253,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,226.275,229.703,"For the first time, he could've raised, it would've been on --"
1979.79-253,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,229.703,230.711,On --
1979.79-253,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,230.711,232.414,-- review in an Article III court?
1979.79-253,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,232.414,239.367,"That -- well, that's -- he could've raised it earlier, but I think the first time he could have had -- it could have had any expectation of relief was in an Article III court."
1979.79-253,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,389.532,408.384,"Mr. Geller, let's assume on mine run prosecutor, just an ordinary prosecutor and -- and let's say that his compensation depended entirely upon the fines assessed against people, he was able to get a court to convict."
1979.79-253,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,411.792,419.358,"I don't -- well, there is a case in fact, because Tumey against Ohio and there was another aspect of Tumey which involved that and was not challenged by anyone."
1979.79-253,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,443.913,447.79,"Well, we -- we have a great deal of prosecutorial discretion as --"
1979.79-253,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,447.79,447.962,That's right.
1979.79-253,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,447.962,452.568,-- also on our system and -- but if that discretion were distorted by --
1979.79-253,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,452.568,453.045,"Well, I --"
1979.79-253,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,453.045,455.636,"-- economic motive, one wonders."
1979.79-253,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,455.636,472.248,"I think that in light of the traditional deference which courts have given to decisions by the executive branch of who to prosecute and what to prosecute for, that there would -- there would not be a prophylactic or pro se rule -- per se rule such as the Court imposed on judges in cases like Tumey."
1979.79-253,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,486.778,494.507,"In this case, could any individual anywhere in the chain of command in the labor departments have profited personally?"
1979.79-253,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,494.507,494.833,No.
1979.79-253,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,496.579,506.125,"If this -- this apparently, is a means of -- of getting some funds without having them appropriated by Congress directly."
1979.79-253,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,507.278,519.025,"Well, the -- one of the unfortunate aspects of this case is that there's nothing in the legislative history to explain why the reimbursement provision worked its way into the statute, but I think that that is a very reasonable speculation."
1979.79-253,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,821.783,828.639,"Maybe not personally, but it -- it can get into the regional office in a way, can't it?"
1979.79-253,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,828.639,837.206,"It can, but that is dependent upon a number of other things happening over which the Assistant Regional Administrator has no control."
1979.79-253,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,852.675,861.204,This -- this whole argument is based on the assumption that the -- the Administrator is the decision maker.
1979.79-253,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,861.204,861.527,I think --
1979.79-253,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,861.527,861.552,And --
1979.79-253,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,861.552,861.9,-- that's right.
1979.79-253,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,910.223,913.215,"Nevertheless, you're -- you're speaking of fairly large sums."
1979.79-253,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,913.215,919.013,"Well, I don't think we're talking of fairly large sum -- sums in comparison to ESA's total budget."
1979.79-253,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,919.06,920.004,Where (Voice Overlap) --
1979.79-253,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,920.004,920.605,"-- in Tumey and Ward, the fines --"
1979.79-253,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,920.605,923.889,Even though the total budget to create bias.
1979.79-253,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,923.889,938.681,"Well, in Tumey and Ward, the amounts that were involved represent that almost half of the town's budget is quite substantial and there was direct evidence in each of those cases that the mayor was quite concerned about the possible loss of that revenue source."
1979.79-253,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,991.689,1004.982,What happens if the Washington office notifies all the regional officers that you haven't reported any money in the last year and we need money?
1979.79-253,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1004.982,1009.754,"I assume that would be a -- why, I don't know that any such communication would -- would go out."
1979.79-253,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1018.97,1019.407,No.
1979.79-253,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1023.847,1025.561,I think that would be a proper communication.
1979.79-253,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1026.965,1027.58,When they urged him --
1979.79-253,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1027.58,1028.941,"-- has crossed to fair it out, child labor violations."
1979.79-253,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1028.941,1034.088,When they urged him to sort of bend somebody's arm.
1979.79-253,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1034.088,1034.733,No.
1979.79-253,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1036.373,1038.944,I'm not saying that surely it would happen.
1979.79-253,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1038.944,1040.73,"Well, I'm sure it wouldn't happen, but even if it did --"
1979.79-253,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1040.73,1041.114,I beg your pardon --
1979.79-253,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1041.114,1044.069,-- it wouldn't have the influence that Judge Gasch attributed to it.
1979.79-253,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1180.549,1184.819,"Very well, Mr. Geller."
1979.79-253,1,43203,thomas_w_power,,1186.628,1190.965,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1979.79-253,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1274.149,1279.693,"Mr. -- Mr. Power, don't -- don't you concede that there's a good deal of attenuation here?"
1979.79-253,1,43203,thomas_w_power,,1279.693,1281.066,"I'm sorry Justice, I dont think --"
1979.79-253,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1281.066,1296.075,Don't -- don't you concede that there's a good deal of attenuation here between what in fact happens and what might be a genuinely undesirable and perhaps unconstitutional situation?
1979.79-253,1,43203,thomas_w_power,,1296.075,1307.204,"Well, Your Honor, I think that what in fact actually happened was an unconstitutional situation and in fact, you had actual bias in this particular case."
1979.79-253,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1331.3,1344.165,"Well, admittedly, it's unique, but a -- an entire series of steps would have to occur before the actual bias could be reached, wouldn't it?"
1979.79-253,1,43203,thomas_w_power,,1344.165,1353.492,"Well, the statute provides for example, Your Honor, that the fund shall be used to reimburse the assessor of the fines."
1979.79-253,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1359.935,1366.018,But do the particular individuals aren't going to get more money because they levy more funds?
1979.79-253,1,43203,thomas_w_power,,1366.018,1369.507,"I think that that's entirely possible, if not likely."
1979.79-253,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1378.84,1381.631,They'll get a raise -- you mean they'll get a raise in pay?
1979.79-253,1,43203,thomas_w_power,,1381.631,1383.299,I think that's entirely possible.
1979.79-253,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1497.59,1514.947,"Are you suggesting that the Secretary exercising this discretion could provide that annually, he would give awards of $1000 each to every Administrative Law Judge that sustained a fine?"
1979.79-253,1,43203,thomas_w_power,,1514.947,1517.921,"Pardon, Mr. -- Mr. Chief Justice, did you say could or he would?"
1979.79-253,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1517.921,1518.361,No.
1979.79-253,1,43203,thomas_w_power,,1518.798,1519.942,Could.
1979.79-253,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1541.553,1547.013,"He could give it and he could be fired too, could --"
1979.79-253,1,43203,thomas_w_power,,1547.013,1548.308,I would say that by virtue of Section 6 --
1979.79-253,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1548.308,1551.007,He could be fired for doing it.
1979.79-253,1,43203,thomas_w_power,,1551.007,1553.543,That the -- the Secretary of Labor could be fined.
1979.79-253,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1553.543,1556.8,Yes.
1979.79-253,1,43203,thomas_w_power,,1556.8,1557.546,Justice Marshall --
1979.79-253,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1557.546,1559.469,"That would stop him from doing, it would --"
1979.79-253,1,43203,thomas_w_power,,1559.469,1559.785,It -- it --
1979.79-253,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1559.785,1560.388,-- slow him down.
1979.79-253,1,43203,thomas_w_power,,1560.388,1567.468,"Although I think that would be -- that would be sufficient to hold that he couldn't do it, if he was going to be subject to a fine."
1979.79-253,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1567.719,1569.019,I say fired --
1979.79-253,1,43203,thomas_w_power,,1569.019,1569.166,I beg your pardon?
1979.79-253,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1569.166,1570.933,-- discharged --
1979.79-253,1,43203,thomas_w_power,,1570.933,1570.971,"Oh, he could be fired."
1979.79-253,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1570.971,1572.065,-- permitted to resign.
1979.79-253,1,43203,thomas_w_power,,1572.065,1572.67,I'm sorry.
1979.79-253,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1573.182,1574.198,Submitted to resign.
1979.79-253,1,43203,thomas_w_power,,1574.198,1578.35,"Yes, he could but that would be -- that would be political consideration."
1979.79-253,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1621.714,1622.486,"Excuse me, Mr. Power."
1979.79-253,1,43203,thomas_w_power,,1622.486,1623.526,"Yes, Justice."
1979.79-253,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1623.526,1627.228,"Which is the provision of 9 (a), I guess it's 9 (a), but --"
1979.79-253,1,43203,thomas_w_power,,1627.228,1627.722,I think both in --
1979.79-253,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1627.722,1632.194,-- but you -- but which is it that covers the Administrative Law Judge?
1979.79-253,1,43203,thomas_w_power,,1632.194,1633.472,The Administrative Law Judge?
1979.79-253,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1633.472,1634.613,Yes.
1979.79-253,1,43203,thomas_w_power,,1634.613,1640.385,The -- the Section 16 (e) of which 9 (a) is --
1979.79-253,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1640.385,1640.496,Yes.
1979.79-253,1,43203,thomas_w_power,,1640.496,1641.907,-- a part.
1979.79-253,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1646.591,1656.394,"Well, it says, “For the ordinary expenses of the agency and or to secure the special services of persons who are neither officers nor employees of the United States.”"
1979.79-253,1,43203,thomas_w_power,,1660.211,1676.964,"Well, the language that says that the money shall be credited to the appropriation of the office, let me see, this one of (Inaudible)."
1979.79-253,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1676.964,1687.821,"Well, I'll read in 16 (e), “Sums collected shall be applied toward reimbursement of the cost of determining in violations -- violations in assessing, collecting such penalties.”"
1979.79-253,1,43203,thomas_w_power,,1688.666,1692.942,"No, Justice, I -- I'm referring to the -- the language that says on this -- under --"
1979.79-253,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1692.942,1693.042,29 (a)?
1979.79-253,1,43203,thomas_w_power,,1693.042,1695.274,"-- 29 U.S. 9 (a), “All moneys --"
1979.79-253,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1695.274,1695.768,"Oh, yes."
1979.79-253,1,43203,thomas_w_power,,1695.768,1714.843,"-- here and after received by the Department of Labor in payment of the cost of such work and this would be the work of collecting the -- determining and assessing the fines shall, not may, shall be deposited to the credit of the appropriation of that bureau, service, office division or the agency of the Department of Labor.”"
1979.79-253,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1748.889,1756.49,"Well, in any event, the Administrative Law Judge says within that language “Bureau, service, office, division or other agencies.”"
1979.79-253,1,43203,thomas_w_power,,1756.532,1758.774,"Yes, it would be."
1979.79-253,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1758.774,1763.344,But how -- how would he benefit from the collection of fines?
1979.79-253,1,43203,thomas_w_power,,1763.344,1769.051,"Well, he would increase -- he would be reimbursed -- he would be reimbursed from --"
1979.79-253,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1769.051,1771.797,"Well, his salary is set, isn't it?"
1979.79-253,1,43203,thomas_w_power,,1771.797,1785.88,"Well, again, he -- his salary and the amount of work or the expenses of his office are definitely restricted by the budgets under which he operates both as recommended by the President and as approved by Congress."
1979.79-253,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1785.88,1786.056,Well --
1979.79-253,1,43203,thomas_w_power,,1786.056,1787.562,"Now, he could substantially increase --"
1979.79-253,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1787.562,1791.242,Don't all Administrative Law Judges get the same?
1979.79-253,1,43203,thomas_w_power,,1793.936,1795.434,"I am not certain with that, Justice White."
1979.79-253,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1795.434,1797.5,"Well, don't you have to be sure to the answer of that question?"
1979.79-253,1,43203,thomas_w_power,,1797.5,1798.759,I beg your pardon?
1979.79-253,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1798.759,1803.336,Don't you have to be sure to the -- of the answer to that question?
1979.79-253,1,43203,thomas_w_power,,1803.336,1804.288,"Well, when you -- when you get it --"
1979.79-253,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1804.288,1809.462,Even if -- if what Administrative Law Judges get is set by statute.
1979.79-253,1,43203,thomas_w_power,,1809.462,1809.943,Yes.
1979.79-253,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1809.943,1814.208,And regardless to how many cases they hear or what the fines are collected.
1979.79-253,1,43203,thomas_w_power,,1817.711,1821.323,"Well, I think he expands his overall operation."
1979.79-253,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1821.323,1821.473,"Well, how do you --"
1979.79-253,1,43203,thomas_w_power,,1821.473,1821.918,It gets --
1979.79-253,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1821.918,1825.214,-- how do you -- just explain that.
1979.79-253,1,43203,thomas_w_power,,1825.214,1829.057,"He gets an increased appropriation, if you will."
1979.79-253,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1829.216,1830.982,How -- how do you know that?
1979.79-253,1,43203,thomas_w_power,,1830.982,1832.949,"Well, I'm -- I'm sorry, Justice White."
1979.79-253,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1839.544,1848.446,It just -- it just goes into the -- it just goes into the -- into the -- into the entire -- it just goes to defray the overall budgetary expenses.

1979.79-253,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1850.195,1850.986,"No, no."
1979.79-253,1,43203,thomas_w_power,,1867.653,1868.676,That's only a potential.
1979.79-253,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1870.034,1871.452,"Well, maybe they will not."
1979.79-253,1,43203,thomas_w_power,,1871.452,1871.614,But --
1979.79-253,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1871.614,1877.72,"Well, you must be saying Mr. Power that this authorizes something in the way of a -- of a bonus to the Administrative Law Judge."
1979.79-253,1,43203,thomas_w_power,,1877.72,1878.614,Yes.
1979.79-253,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1882.955,1887.441,"Well, surely you don't suggest that it's going to get -- increases his income for that year."
1979.79-253,1,43203,thomas_w_power,,1887.441,1890.101,"I am suggesting very definite of that, Your Honor."
1979.79-253,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1897.183,1898.518,The Administrative Law Judge's --
1979.79-253,1,43203,thomas_w_power,,1898.518,1899.15,Yes.
1979.79-253,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1899.15,1900.041,-- her own salary?
1979.79-253,1,43203,thomas_w_power,,1900.041,1901.589,"Oh, I'm -- I'm sorry."
1979.79-253,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1910.698,1916.118,"You don't suggest the Secretary has ever given at that interpretation, do you?"
1979.79-253,1,43203,thomas_w_power,,1916.118,1916.208,"No, sir."
1979.79-253,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1916.208,1916.922,And you're just suggesting --
1979.79-253,1,43203,thomas_w_power,,1916.922,1917.864,But I am -- but I am --
1979.79-253,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1917.864,1919.481,-- that that might happen under this language.
1979.79-253,1,43203,thomas_w_power,,1919.481,1919.527,That's -- that's correct.
1979.79-253,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1919.527,1920.179,Are you --
1979.79-253,1,43203,thomas_w_power,,1926.936,1939.078,"I -- I -- again, with the language, this is notwithstanding any other provision of law on discretion of the Secretary, can use it for -- to meet the ordinary expenses, I think perhaps he could."
1979.79-253,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1939.078,1943.726,And he would then raise his salary above that of Congress?
1979.79-253,1,43203,thomas_w_power,,1946.025,1949.127,"Well, again, that's a -- that's a political consideration, but I don't know whether he'd be in --"
1979.79-253,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1949.127,1954.414,"Well, you maybe he's talking about this broad -- that language, because you say, it's so broad."
1979.79-253,1,43203,thomas_w_power,,1959.144,1960.732,That's correct.
1979.79-253,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1960.732,1964.289,And do you know of any statute that has ever been passed like that?
1979.79-253,1,43203,thomas_w_power,,1964.289,1965.274,"No, sir."
1979.79-253,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1965.642,1967.468,And do you think Congress meant to do that?
1979.79-253,1,43203,thomas_w_power,,1967.468,1969.569,"No, Your Honor."
1979.79-253,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2043.118,2044.992,"Well, wait a minute."
1979.79-253,1,43203,thomas_w_power,,2047.526,2049.87,The office of the Administrative Law Judge.
1979.79-253,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2050.0,2055.378,An Administrative Law Judge doesn't have an appropriation anymore than a law clerk that this Court has.
1979.79-253,1,43203,thomas_w_power,,2055.378,2055.895,I'm sorry.
1979.79-253,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2060.318,2061.6,He has a line item.
1979.79-253,1,43203,thomas_w_power,,2061.6,2063.333,He has a line item.
1979.79-253,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2063.333,2076.869,"Mr. Power, on your -- going back to the detail concerning the Administrative Law Judge, it would seem so have exercise some of the brother and up here, Judge Gasch was not with you on this point, was he?"
1979.79-253,1,43203,thomas_w_power,,2076.869,2080.118,I think that Judge Gasch was responding to a --
1979.79-253,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2080.118,2081.731,"Well, let me read to you -- this is from his findings."
1979.79-253,1,43203,thomas_w_power,,2097.545,2098.013,Well --
1979.79-253,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2098.013,2103.536,That seems to me to cut directly against your argument as to detail on his salary.
1979.79-253,1,43203,thomas_w_power,,2103.536,2111.489,"Again, I -- I agree with you although I do not think that it was necessary for Judge Gasch in that proceeding to consider that question."
1979.79-253,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2118.663,2122.242,"That maybe true, but you're -- you're certainly arguing here."
1979.79-253,1,43203,thomas_w_power,,2122.242,2123.848,That -- that is correct.
1979.79-253,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2141.188,2152.633,Do you say that each Administrative Law Judge assigned to the Labor Department has a line item appropriation for his salary?
1979.79-253,1,43203,thomas_w_power,,2152.633,2154.06,Not for his individual salary.
1979.79-253,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2159.065,2173.272,"If they have a 150 Administrative Law Judges, there's a lump sum in the budget which is a line item compensation, but no Administrative Law Judge has any budget or any part of any budget allocated to him."
1979.79-253,1,43203,thomas_w_power,,2173.272,2173.323,That --
1979.79-253,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2173.323,2174.813,More than any other branch of the Government.
1979.79-253,1,43203,thomas_w_power,,2174.813,2180.381,"That -- that, I understand."
1979.79-253,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2393.417,2401.808,"Is this the same -- is this the same pattern of assessing fines as under the Mine Safety Act, if -- if you know."
1979.79-253,1,43203,thomas_w_power,,2401.808,2402.244,No.
1979.79-253,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2423.283,2433.119,"Well, we had a case argued here last session two or three weeks ago in which they were not criminal fines, but they were as -- as here --"

1979.79-253,1,43203,thomas_w_power,,2466.758,2468.468,-- the assessor of the fines.
1979.79-253,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2469.044,2470.792,And that's not an issue in that case.
1979.79-253,1,43203,thomas_w_power,,2470.792,2471.162,I see.
1979.79-253,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2471.162,2473.887,The question was whether there were civil penalties or criminal fines.
1979.79-253,1,43203,thomas_w_power,,2473.887,2477.116,I question the constitutionality even of that provision.
1979.79-253,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2556.669,2568.582,"Mr. Power, are you suggesting that of that $39,000, the Regional Administrator in Atlanta could simply decide to put it in his own private bank account?"
1979.79-253,1,43203,thomas_w_power,,2568.582,2570.329,"No, I am not, Justice Rehnquist."
1979.79-253,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2580.867,2583.855,The -- the Secretary of Labor could --
1979.79-253,1,43203,thomas_w_power,,2583.855,2584.221,Could use the money.
1979.79-253,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2584.221,2588.215,-- so the Regional Administrator in Atlanta.
1979.79-253,1,43203,thomas_w_power,,2594.37,2604.989,"I -- it -- it appears to me, unless -- since the Act has such broad language and says notwithstanding any other provisional law that he has this kind of discretion."
1979.79-253,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2604.989,2607.695,And did you suggest he could put it in his own pocket?
1979.79-253,1,43203,thomas_w_power,,2607.695,2608.903,The Secretary of Labor could --
1979.79-253,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2608.903,2609.056,Yes.
1979.79-253,1,43203,thomas_w_power,,2609.056,2610.248,-- put it in his own pocket?
1979.79-253,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2610.248,2611.222,Yes.

1979.79-253,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2616.266,2627.478,"Well, I suppose the Secretary of Labor could take all the furniture out of his office and take it home and -- and try to keep it, but he might run into some other problems (Voice Overlap) --"
1979.79-253,1,43203,thomas_w_power,,2627.478,2629.461,"Yes, I think that would be in violation."
