1983.81-757,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,10.456,We will hear arguments first this morning in Allen against Wright and the consolidated case.
1983.81-757,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,12.991,17.959,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1983.81-757,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,408.649,415.453,"Well, I suppose, however, the Court had to assume standing existed to have entered the order it did."
1983.81-757,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,418.655,431.046,"It is correct, Justice O'Connor, that any court necessarily holds that there is standing in any decision where it renders a substantive decision on the merits."
1983.81-757,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,456.113,459.815,"As long as you're interrupted, may I ask you another question."
1983.81-757,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,516.669,541.1,"Under the present procedure that is followed by the Internal Revenue Service, and a perfectly acceptable procedure, knowledge is gained by the devices that are available to the Internal Revenue Service, and certainly they cannot revoke the tax exemptions of any entity whom they do not know to be discriminating."
1983.81-757,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,593.234,596.536,"Mr. Solicitor General... I'm sorry, had you finished your answer?"
1983.81-757,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,596.536,597.386,Yes.
1983.81-757,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,597.386,603.709,Justice O'Connor's question and your reference to Title VI prompts this question from me.
1983.81-757,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,629.324,634.061,I think there would be standing to challenge the direct subsidy--
1983.81-757,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,634.061,636.644,To sue the federal official.
1983.81-757,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,636.644,638.013,--but not to sue the Internal Revenue Service.
1983.81-757,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,638.013,638.713,"No, no."
1983.81-757,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,645.433,645.817,I see.
1983.81-757,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,645.817,646.719,And you sue them.
1983.81-757,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,654.439,658.592,I believe there would be standing in such a case--
1983.81-757,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,658.592,659.442,What's the difference?
1983.81-757,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,659.442,666.615,"--to bring suit directly against HEW, HHS, to prevent the payment."
1983.81-757,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,666.615,675.554,"In terms of impact on the individual litigant, what's the difference whether it's a subsidy in the form of cash or in the form of tax exemption?"
1983.81-757,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,675.554,696.801,"Well, whether it's a difference between... there is a difference between tax cases and non-tax cases, which I will get to, in that, reaching all the way back to Louisiana versus McAdoc, this Court has recognized that tax cases may fit in a different category."
1983.81-757,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,714.679,718.63,"Well, let me restate it."
1983.81-757,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,757.006,759.291,"--All right, I think I understand your question now."
1983.81-757,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,833.923,836.208,"Mr. Lee, could I ask you one thing."
1983.81-757,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,841.01,841.445,Indeed.
1983.81-757,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,841.445,845.23,"It was a five to four decision, wasn't it?"
1983.81-757,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,845.23,846.097,"Yes, sir."
1983.81-757,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,846.097,848.43,But it's very correct?
1983.81-757,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,848.43,849.215,Excuse me?
1983.81-757,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,849.215,850.249,It's very correct?
1983.81-757,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,850.249,851.782,It is very correct.
1983.81-757,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,854.767,857.1,You're always so positive and I just wondered.
1983.81-757,1,45339,william_j_landers_ii,,1132.579,1135.598,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1983.81-757,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1480.223,1489.179,"Mr. Landers, can I ask you, if these people had applied for admission to the school you represent and been denied admission, do you think they'd have standing?"
1983.81-757,1,45339,william_j_landers_ii,,1489.179,1494.816,--They would have standing under Runyon versus McCrary to bring a direct action against that school.
1983.81-757,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1494.816,1498.702,"I understand that, but would they have standing to bring a suit against the revenue department?"
1983.81-757,1,45339,william_j_landers_ii,,1498.702,1499.804,"No, sir."
1983.81-757,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1499.804,1501.654,"Then that's really irrelevant, isn't it?"
1983.81-757,1,45339,william_j_landers_ii,,1506.04,1519.448,"It does because it shows that they have even less interest in the tax exempt status of this school than did the plaintiffs in Eastern Kentucky, where they had applied to the hospitals and been denied."
1983.81-757,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1528.989,1543.314,"Mr. Landers, in your petition in this Court you challenge the Court of Appeals holding that the appropriation riders in 1980 and '81 barred the claimed relief."
1983.81-757,1,45339,william_j_landers_ii,,1551.502,1570.4,"The riders expired in 1982, but I think that the fact that Congress considered those and addressed this question shows that this matter is appropriately one to be decided by the Executive Branch with oversight by Congress, as Solicitor Lee said."
1983.81-757,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1712.806,1718.024,"Mr. Landers, as I understand your position there would be no standing even if there were no remedy."
1983.81-757,1,45339,william_j_landers_ii,,1725.547,1727.314,--They didn't have to do any of these things.
1983.81-757,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1730.684,1736.422,"But if the IRS had a policy of not caring at all about these issues, they could not be challenged?"
1983.81-757,1,45339,william_j_landers_ii,,1736.422,1740.89,"But that's not the issue, that's not the case before this Court at this time."
1983.81-757,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1740.89,1747.528,Does the constitutional issue then turn on the fact that they have in fact been diligent in pursuing these goals?
1983.81-757,1,45339,william_j_landers_ii,,1747.528,1748.23,"No, sir."
1983.81-757,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1776.713,1783.653,Mr. Kapp.
1983.81-757,2,39717,robert_h_kapp,,1783.653,1787.438,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1983.81-757,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1816.457,1844.607,"Mr. Kapp, I suppose in the complaint below two different types of injuries were alleged, I think: first, the pure stigma injury; second was the reliance on diminished ability to obtain a desegregated public school education."
1983.81-757,2,39717,robert_h_kapp,,1850.392,1861.283,"I think the injury, Your Honor, consists of a multitude of facets."
1983.81-757,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1943.854,1951.542,"Well, do you think that any citizen would have a right to file a suit to complain about that?"
1983.81-757,2,39717,robert_h_kapp,,1951.542,1952.892,"Certainly not, Your Honor."
1983.81-757,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1967.802,1971.104,"Well, so you aren't claiming the pure stigma injury."
1983.81-757,2,39717,robert_h_kapp,,1991.75,1997.254,"Stigma is only part of the injury that is suffered, Your Honor."
1983.81-757,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2022.119,2024.054,"Well, or perhaps all white citizens as well."
1983.81-757,2,39717,robert_h_kapp,,2024.054,2027.173,--It may stigmatize all white citizens as well.
1983.81-757,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2027.173,2031.042,"Do all those people have a cause of action, then, under your theory?"
1983.81-757,2,39717,robert_h_kapp,,2032.827,2033.96,"No, they do not, Your Honor."
1983.81-757,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2033.96,2035.194,Why?
1983.81-757,2,39717,robert_h_kapp,,2038.481,2058.375,Because the black students that attend public schools in desegregating public school districts are particularly injured by the fact that the Government is supporting racially segregated private schools in those districts.
1983.81-757,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2112.696,2140.596,"Mr. Kapp, if you are correct that the Government grant of a tax exemption to a school such as Briarcrest is equivalent to the Government in effect operating the school, wouldn't that line of reasoning carry you over to say that if the Government grants a tax exemption to a church it's tantamount to the Government operating the church and therefore would be barred under the First Amendment?"
1983.81-757,2,39717,robert_h_kapp,,2140.596,2171.75,"I think there is a well-developed constitutional rule here that derives from Norwood, which says that at least when the Government is providing financial assistance, either in the form of tuition grants or tax exemptions, that that is the legal equivalent of operating the school simply for the purposes of analysis."
1983.81-757,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2171.75,2172.284,"Well, all right."
1983.81-757,2,39717,robert_h_kapp,,2182.523,2192.648,"I think the reason for that, Your Honor, is the reason that Justice Burger, Chief Justice Burger, indicated in the Norwood case itself."
1983.81-757,3,39761,rex_e_lee,,3518.905,3520.606,"Not unless the Court has questions, Your Honor."
1983.81-757,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3520.606,3522.558,I hear none.
