1965.692,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,27.659,"Number 692 Pure Oil Company Petitioner, versus Pascual Suarez."
1965.692,0,22180,eberhard_p_deutsch,,28.786,33.149,Mr. Chief Justice may it please the Court.
1965.692,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,265.36,271.805,"Well that you referred, it applied to [Inaudible] that would put it on the same basis as FELA's, is that right?"
1965.692,0,22180,eberhard_p_deutsch,,271.805,272.148,That's correct.
1965.692,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,272.148,272.904,As you mentioned?
1965.692,0,22180,eberhard_p_deutsch,,272.904,273.569,That's correct.
1965.692,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,274.146,278.137,"The 1948 statute is more a general application, is that right?"
1965.692,0,22180,eberhard_p_deutsch,,278.137,299.384,The 1948 statute is the general judicial code 1391 (c) which does provide without question and unequivocally that the term residence for venue purposes shall be taken to include any district in which the respondent corporation is licensed to do or is doing business.
1965.692,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,299.384,302.615,But your proposition is going to be not so as the Jones Act?
1965.692,0,22180,eberhard_p_deutsch,,302.615,305.085,Right.
1965.692,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,306.352,308.094,Yes.
1965.692,0,22180,eberhard_p_deutsch,,308.094,332.538,"Now, this Court has had a case to consider that question with regard to a somewhat similar and somewhat different provision of the judicial code itself dealing with patent litigation which also provides a specific venue within which patent litigation may be instituted."
1965.692,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,342.454,343.904,Is that code you're --
1965.692,0,22180,eberhard_p_deutsch,,343.904,344.409,Pardon?
1965.692,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,344.409,345.544,What code you're --
1965.692,0,22180,eberhard_p_deutsch,,345.544,346.515,1400 (b)
1965.692,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,346.515,348.778,"No, I mean the Fourco decision."
1965.692,0,22180,eberhard_p_deutsch,,348.778,352.079,"Fourco, Fourco Glass."
1965.692,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,637.532,642.671,Mr. Roth?
1965.692,1,16814,arthur_roth,,642.671,645.565,Mr. Chief Justice and members of the Court.
1965.692,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,696.141,704.883,"I gather the fact is Mr. Roth that this at all happened before 1948 he could not have sued it in Florida, could he?"
1965.692,1,16814,arthur_roth,,704.883,706.756,Well he could have in state courts but –
1965.692,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,706.756,708.128,No I mean he'd decide --
1965.692,1,16814,arthur_roth,,708.128,711.707,For a civil and jury trial in the federal courts I don't think --
1965.692,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,711.707,716.724,He would have to go either where Pure Oil was incorporated or where it has principal offices.
1965.692,1,16814,arthur_roth,,716.724,718.645,"That's right, that's what he would have gone before 1940 --"
1965.692,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,718.645,730.711,Well suppose the issue really is not based on how hard it may be if upon him to do it but whether indeed the 1948 statute did allow him to bring an action further doesn't it?
1965.692,1,16814,arthur_roth,,731.639,746.19,"Yes, the question is whether or not the Congress had intended to make a – to facilitate the bringing of suits by plaintiffs against large corporations."
1965.692,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,746.19,748.995,Where would the suit have to be tried?
1965.692,1,16814,arthur_roth,,748.995,749.378,Sir?
1965.692,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,749.378,751.289,If the other side wins?
1965.692,1,16814,arthur_roth,,751.289,752.788,In Chicago.
1965.692,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,752.788,753.777,Chicago?
1965.692,1,16814,arthur_roth,,753.777,754.831,Yes sir.
1965.692,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,754.831,755.491,He could bring it.
1965.692,1,16814,arthur_roth,,758.006,791.002,There's no question about that but the problem in the state court is basically one of the discovery where we don't have the privilege of taking a subpoena and sending it out to a marshal in Texas or a marshal in Savannah where the man was treated for his injuries and having a subpoena issued and this is really the basic issue and the second basic issue is that the state judges have – do not have the same understanding concept of the Jones Act that seamen problems says to the federal judges --
1965.692,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,791.002,796.514,Does the forum non conveniens statute have any relevance in your mind to this issue?
1965.692,1,16814,arthur_roth,,796.514,827.348,"We were asked that below and I would put it this way Mr. Justice Black that the forum non conveniens statute would be, I think basically, available to a defendant rather than to a plaintiff because if we were to file a suit to say in Chicago and then come in and say to the judge in Chicago we want to go down to Tampa or Miami which is the real forum where this case should be trialed we would somewhat be I mean how can we ask the judge when he says you came here to stop well this was your election."
1965.692,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,828.064,838.777,I assume he did sue in Miami in the federal courts that the defendant could have – if they could prove it and have it removed in Chicago under – be more convenient forum.
1965.692,1,16814,arthur_roth,,838.777,884.402,"Yes because this was the very purpose of 1404 where they point that at the FELA was the real reason that 1404 and that is Federal Employees Liability Act which is incorporated in the Jones Act that 1404 revise's purpose clause that it was the FELA that made 1404 the forum non conveniens statute a necessity because the railroad workers were bringing their cases in the most profitable forum and the railroads couldn't change the forum and the 1948 revision amended the venue of -- and in fact amended the venue, the general venue provisions and permitted the transfer to a more convenient forum where the witness would be –"
1965.692,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,884.402,887.376,When was the forum non conveniens statute passed?
1965.692,1,16814,arthur_roth,,887.376,888.469,1948.
1965.692,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,888.469,889.385,1948?
1965.692,1,16814,arthur_roth,,889.385,890.279,Yes it is –
1965.692,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,890.279,894.051,"When did this take place, this statute?"
1965.692,1,16814,arthur_roth,,894.051,897.118,1391 and 1948 they are both –
1965.692,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,897.118,898.471,Both in 1948?
1965.692,1,16814,arthur_roth,,898.471,899.671,Yes sir.
1965.692,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,899.671,903.171,Were they a part of the same procedure?
1965.692,1,16814,arthur_roth,,903.171,904.785,Yes of the same revision of the judicial code.
1965.692,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,904.785,905.725,Same revision?
1965.692,1,16814,arthur_roth,,905.725,907.528,Yes sir.
1965.692,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,979.445,990.514,Have there been any cases that plaintiffs have filed in the jurisdiction 408 from the place where it happened and then plaintiff asked to have it moved to a place where it's more convenient?
1965.692,1,16814,arthur_roth,,990.514,998.133,I couldn't find a single case on point.
1965.692,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1107.6,1112.596,But suppose it might have had some special reference to diversity cases?
1965.692,1,16814,arthur_roth,,1112.596,1120.787,"No sir, I look through the revision and I couldn't find in the notes or the revises and there is no reference to anything specific."
1965.692,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1120.787,1131.214,"Well it would be very significant though wouldn't it if diversity cases, suits against the corporations that they might be sued with any – might spread the work around instead of concentrating in some district?"
1965.692,1,16814,arthur_roth,,1131.214,1134.431,"Yes, this is what I'm going to come to Mr. Justice Brennan."
1965.692,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1203.594,1205.52,Now get at them in what way?
1965.692,1,16814,arthur_roth,,1205.52,1209.639,Sir they wouldn't be filed in inconvenient forms.
1965.692,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1213.755,1216.027,I don't follow that.
1965.692,1,16814,arthur_roth,,1222.646,1223.555,That's right.
1965.692,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1223.555,1229.293,"It was Jones Act cases that were limited to principal office or state of incorporation, is that right?"
1965.692,1,16814,arthur_roth,,1229.293,1230.534,That's right.
1965.692,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1230.534,1233.858,But now you say what revise would say about the FELA is?
1965.692,1,16814,arthur_roth,,1233.858,1254.631,"When section 1404 was enacted in 1948 at the same time of the revision, the intent of the Congress was to get at this provision of the FELA where they could bring it in any district they wanted so that these railroads could transfer to the more convenient forum."
1965.692,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1295.076,1295.882,Let me see if I follow this Mr. Roth.
1965.692,1,16814,arthur_roth,,1295.882,1297.641,Yes.
1965.692,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1297.641,1303.904,You say FELA actions before 1948 to be brought at any district or the corporation business?
1965.692,1,16814,arthur_roth,,1303.904,1304.124,Yes sir.
1965.692,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1304.124,1306.742,"Where the railroad business, anyone."
1965.692,1,16814,arthur_roth,,1317.976,1318.904,Yes.
1965.692,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1336.061,1343.459,"In other words a railroad could come in the District Court the suit was brought to say no, this is not the phase that should be tried, transfer it somewhere else."
1965.692,1,16814,arthur_roth,,1343.459,1358.513,"No, they would have to come and make a showing under the section to say so we have all the witnesses here the man was injured in this district, he was treated in this district, most of our witnesses live in this district that means when the railroad made a proper showing --"
1965.692,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1358.513,1371.16,"Now if you say had to make a showing, you say the reason for 1404 is that the number in the 1948 Act was in the railroad to have it transferred out of the District Court where it was brought to some other more convenient forum if there was one?"
1965.692,1,16814,arthur_roth,,1371.16,1373.456,That's right and the same thing of course --
1965.692,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1373.456,1377.072,Now what bearing does that have an issue before us?
1965.692,1,16814,arthur_roth,,1377.072,1389.385,Well it was to answer the argument of the petitioner that we could bring a case against Pure Oil Company in any district of the country practically because they are doing business in any district of the country and –
1965.692,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1389.385,1398.956,"Your point is if you prevail here what will happen is that the Pure Oil Company could do at any railroad can do as the FELA suit namely transfer it to a more convenient forum, doesn't it?"
1965.692,1,16814,arthur_roth,,1398.956,1411.83,"Yes, this is -- now I would say this that if they can do that with the Jones Act case, this is a change of venue in a Jones Act case."
1965.692,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1441.188,1462.105,"I wonder if I understand this Mr. Roth that are you suggesting here that we should agree that Congress by the 1948 provision permitted Jones Act cases to be brought wherever the corporate defendant did business because the corporate defendant's interest could be protected by the transfer provisions under 1404, is that the same?"
1965.692,1,16814,arthur_roth,,1462.105,1465.227,Exactly.
1965.692,2,22180,eberhard_p_deutsch,,1701.182,1708.162,If the Court remains in session a few minutes longer I would be particularly brief.
1965.692,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1753.564,1754.861,Transfer it to where?
1965.692,2,22180,eberhard_p_deutsch,,1754.861,1759.122,To the principal place of business of the corporation.
1965.692,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1759.122,1759.905,Where is that?
1965.692,2,22180,eberhard_p_deutsch,,1760.224,1761.925,The northern district of Illinois.
1965.692,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1761.925,1762.759,Illinois?
1965.692,2,22180,eberhard_p_deutsch,,1762.759,1764.689,"It's Palatine, Illinois I'm not sure."
1965.692,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1764.689,1771.468,Did you move to dismiss it on the ground that the witnesses are there and it would be more convenient to trial on the grounds of the statute?
1965.692,2,22180,eberhard_p_deutsch,,1771.468,1773.147,Strictly under the statute.
1965.692,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1777.51,1778.417,Under the statute?
1965.692,2,22180,eberhard_p_deutsch,,1778.417,1779.324,Under the statute.
1965.692,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1779.324,1782.39,You didn't ask to move it on the ground of forum non conveniens?
1965.692,2,22180,eberhard_p_deutsch,,1782.39,1784.433,Not at all that question didn't arise.
1965.692,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1784.433,1801.119,"I asked that question because it was rather my impression that the Congress took a new look at all of these thing on forum non conveniens and most of these other troublesome questions were ended by it, I'd hoped?"
1965.692,2,22180,eberhard_p_deutsch,,1801.119,1813.376,"As long as the Congress sits, not as this Court said, as long Congress sits there will be questions which will bother this Court and us, I'm sure at least that it has been my experience --"
1965.692,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1813.376,1834.738,But I would – it bothered me in the respect that I had an idea that gave a new deal and all that legislation 1948 and they did not intend to have a forum non conveniens statute affect this ploy by keeping old interpretations that no longer fitted the term.
1965.692,2,22180,eberhard_p_deutsch,,1834.738,1836.714,That forum non conveniens statute.
1965.692,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1845.442,1847.184,That's right.
1965.692,2,22180,eberhard_p_deutsch,,1847.184,1850.7,That wouldn't help him in this case.
1965.692,2,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,1850.7,1852.364,"So it wouldn't be available to him, wouldn't it?"
1965.692,2,22180,eberhard_p_deutsch,,1852.364,1853.575,That's right.
1965.692,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1853.575,1855.217,So he couldn't move it.
1965.692,2,22180,eberhard_p_deutsch,,1857.101,1865.111,"As plaintiff he could seek to move to any jurisdiction he saw fit, that is within the scope of that statute."
1965.692,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1882.723,1886.522,But he couldn't move it back to Miami under your argument.
1965.692,2,22180,eberhard_p_deutsch,,1886.522,1889.04,That's correct.
1965.692,2,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,1890.493,1894.786,But he couldn't transfer it of the 1404.
1965.692,2,22180,eberhard_p_deutsch,,1894.786,1894.961,I'm sorry.
1965.692,2,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,1894.961,1897.867,I say he wouldn't be able to transfer it under 1404.
1965.692,2,22180,eberhard_p_deutsch,,1897.867,1899.481,He could not transfer them to 1404.
1965.692,2,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,1899.481,1902.206,But you wouldn't – that's right.
1965.692,2,22180,eberhard_p_deutsch,,1902.206,1914.324,"I want to mention very briefly as long as Barron & Holtzoff have been brought up as not, if I understand it, as making the distinction that only the patent cases should be involved."
1965.692,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1950.357,1952.366,What did Mr. Moore say about that?
1965.692,2,22180,eberhard_p_deutsch,,1952.366,1955.546,Substantially not quite the same thing.
1965.692,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1971.226,1972.805,"Well don't waste your time, it's all right."
1965.692,2,22180,eberhard_p_deutsch,,1972.805,1977.004,I'm sorry I don't -- I did have it here on separate page.
1965.692,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1983.03,1986.133,Do you remember what his attitude was before Fourco?
1965.692,2,22180,eberhard_p_deutsch,,1986.133,1989.16,Well you will find it quoted in Fourco.
1965.692,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1989.16,1990.589,"And it was to the contrary, wasn't it?"
1965.692,2,22180,eberhard_p_deutsch,,1990.589,2006.961,It says that we did not intend the Congress did not intend the change at these special venue provisions by this general provision in 1391 (c) and this Court quoted into that effect as the consultant who certainly should be in authority on this point.
1965.692,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2062.795,2066.842,Is it your argument that they must all be together?
1965.692,2,22180,eberhard_p_deutsch,,2089.837,2092.677,I think that is the effect of it sir.
1965.692,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2099.104,2102.193,"Well I thought you were going outside of your case, was the reason I asked --"
1965.692,2,22180,eberhard_p_deutsch,,2102.193,2105.598,I'm trying to avoid it frankly sir.
1965.692,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2125.904,2132.216,Thank you.
