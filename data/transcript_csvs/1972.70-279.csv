1972.70-279,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,40.567,"We’ll hear arguments next in 70-279, United States against Florida East Coast Railway."
1972.70-279,0,41452,samuel_huntington,,46.453,49.617,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1972.70-279,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,373.536,377.011,Purchasing railroads own the new freight cars outright?
1972.70-279,0,41452,samuel_huntington,,377.011,379.724,"Yes, they would."
1972.70-279,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,426.912,447.324,"What way, if any, should be given here now to the fact determinations of the District Court or at least a mixed fact in law determination that-- relating to prejudice?"
1972.70-279,0,41452,samuel_huntington,,447.324,456.8,"Well, in our view, it’s not so much a question of fact as it is a question of the proper standard to be applied in determining prejudice."
1972.70-279,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,689.008,704.538,"But your opponents come back there and argue that because of the 1966 amendment, in its language, saying that the additional determination should be made whether upon these considerations, that that is an implied requirement."
1972.70-279,0,41452,samuel_huntington,,704.538,729.516,"Well, they do and our response to that is that the 1966 amendment simply builds on what was there before and it does require the Commission to take into account certain factors before imposing an incentive element but, in no way, suggested that, in considering those factors, the Commission must do so only on the basis of the record."
1972.70-279,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1125.813,1131.694,What if they challenged-- they wanted to challenge the underlying data itself?
1972.70-279,0,41452,samuel_huntington,,1131.694,1138.706,"Well, they have not chosen to do that, other than to-- well, I’ll backtrack a little bit."
1972.70-279,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1395.541,1400.302,"Mr. Huntington, what are the practical aspects of this?"
1972.70-279,0,41452,samuel_huntington,,1414.253,1427.319,"Well, I think had to-- had it rule-- at this point, the rules are, in effect, against-- apply to every railroad in the country except Florida East Coast and Seaboard."
1972.70-279,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1460.677,1465.414,"You mean by that, years or months or--"
1972.70-279,0,41452,samuel_huntington,,1465.414,1468.253,"I think, probably, years."
1972.70-279,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1468.253,1481.086,"But you don’t anticipate, or do you, many interveners and their participation in this kind of thing?"
1972.70-279,0,41452,samuel_huntington,,1481.086,1485.2,"Well, I could backtrack on what I said a minute ago."
1972.70-279,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1505.314,1511.08,"Because of its rule making, they wouldn’t be bound by their failure to themselves?"
1972.70-279,0,41452,samuel_huntington,,1511.08,1513.001,"Well, I think that might be one factor."
1972.70-279,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1532.66,1540.063,"I understand that your reference involves to strike, initially anyway, only these two rules would be involved."
1972.70-279,0,41452,samuel_huntington,,1544.544,1552.175,"Yes, the rest of the-- the rules have been applied since September 1, 1970 to the rest of the railroads in the country."
1972.70-279,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1552.175,1555.487,"In the Long Island case, how many railroads were actually appearing?"
1972.70-279,0,41452,samuel_huntington,,1556.935,1558.281,How many were appearing?
1972.70-279,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1566.907,1568.119,Multiple parties.
1972.70-279,0,41452,samuel_huntington,,1568.119,1573.205,"Yes, there were multiple parties and numerous verified statements, and the proceedings went on for some time."
1972.70-279,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1573.205,1580.221,"And some of the railroads in Allegheny were satisfied with the proceedings of the ICC, were they not?"
1972.70-279,0,41452,samuel_huntington,,1580.221,1581.516,"Some of them were, yes."
1972.70-279,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1684.541,1686.577,Mr. Layne.
1972.70-279,1,16466,a_alvis_layne,,1686.577,1690.709,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1972.70-279,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1819.889,1831.452,"Mr. Layne, is your claim based on something outside the Administrative Procedure Act or is it based on the Administrative Procedure Act alone?"
1972.70-279,1,16466,a_alvis_layne,,1831.452,1833.926,"It-- on two, Mr. Justice Rehnquist."
1972.70-279,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1833.926,1834.258,What other--
1972.70-279,1,16466,a_alvis_layne,,1834.258,1860.037,"I would say that the Administrative Procedure Act itself, as this Court noted in Allegheny-Ludlum, would say that the scope and nature of the hearing required to discharge the duty in this case, in this kind of instance, fixing compensation, is within 556 and 557 and the hearing to which Section 114 (a) refers must be a hearing on the record."
1972.70-279,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1912.421,1914.343,Are you saying that you have a constitutional--
1972.70-279,1,16466,a_alvis_layne,,1914.343,1919.519,"Yes, I say that there is also beyond the Administrative Procedure Act, there’s a due process issue."
1972.70-279,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1919.519,1922.34,Do the constitutional claim read Allegheny?
1972.70-279,1,16466,a_alvis_layne,,1922.34,1923.188,"Certainly, sir."
1972.70-279,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1924.997,1926.594,You had a good deal of process.
1972.70-279,1,16466,a_alvis_layne,,1928.056,1942.153,"That’s right but, of course, in Londoner v. Denver, 210 US, the Supreme Court-- this Court said no matter how brief, no matter how informal, you cannot delegate someone simply to filing papers."
1972.70-279,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1949.583,1954.716,"Mr. Layne, let me oversimplify it and I think I’m asking the same question Justice Rehnquist did."
1972.70-279,1,16466,a_alvis_layne,,1968.473,1986.618,"No, because I think the next question arises as to whether you can-- the Commission can be invested with the kind of power that it exercised in this case to take the money or, as it has been somewhat popularly said in the railroad industry, a kind of reverse Robin Hood effect."
1972.70-279,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1996.684,2003.614,"Let me, while I have you interrupted, let me ask you the same questioned I asked Mr. Huntington."
1972.70-279,1,16466,a_alvis_layne,,2016.102,2022.11,"Certainly, and I think that the question of delay is minimum."
1972.70-279,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2051.351,2065.284,"But, of course if Florida East Coast can request oral argument, presumably 200 other railroads can too and, by then, you are talking about a rather significant delay factor."
1972.70-279,1,16466,a_alvis_layne,,2065.284,2079.069,"If those railroads could show that the failure to grant them a hearing prejudiced them as so far as the Florida East Coast Railway showed to the Court below and as I hope to show to this Court, and I think they would be entitled to that hearing."
1972.70-279,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2079.069,2082.927,You say that the delay factor there ought not to prevail over their claims to that--
1972.70-279,1,16466,a_alvis_layne,,2082.927,2086.713,"Certainly not, and this Court’s repeatedly said it shouldn’t."
1972.70-279,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2086.713,2093.739,Would that kind of participation be limited to the people who are involved in this case or all the affected railroads?
1972.70-279,1,16466,a_alvis_layne,,2093.739,2125.28,"Well, I should think, when we started out with this case, it would’ve been limited to people in this case but, to be Frank with you Mr. Chief Justice, the Interstate Commerce Commission has had a petition pending forth since-- before, since July 17, 1972 by a number of railroad, including among them, the largest creditor railroad, the largest one to receive incentive per diem, asking the Commission to reopen this because of the failure of incentive per diem."
1972.70-279,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2126.877,2127.079,Any chance--
1972.70-279,1,16466,a_alvis_layne,,2127.079,2128.006,But so far--
1972.70-279,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2128.006,2132.724,Is there any chance that the problem would be solved by the time the hearings were over?
1972.70-279,1,16466,a_alvis_layne,,2132.724,2135.519,"There is no shortage, sir."
1972.70-279,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2175.164,2177.735,Does the ICC agree with you or--
1972.70-279,1,16466,a_alvis_layne,,2177.735,2179.745,I don’t know whether they do or not.
1972.70-279,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2202.556,2209.474,"But I take it, implicit in your position that you just taken as to absent to shortage, surely these rules are involved."
1972.70-279,1,16466,a_alvis_layne,,2209.474,2225.319,"Certainly, but I thought that I could-- I thought that I would be able to prove before the Commission some of the things that I held were essential to their taking action in the first place, if they had given me an opportunity to do so."
1972.70-279,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2430.882,2435.676,Did you want to find out from him what his interpretation of the word “adequate” was?
1972.70-279,1,16466,a_alvis_layne,,2435.676,2463.959,"No, I wanted to ask him what an adequate supply would be and whether a railroad could respond to a request for a-- whether, in his expert judgment, a supply could be termed adequate, whether you could measure the adequacy of a supply by saying you must report that car-- you must place that car on the day it’s ordered, which is the standard that the Commission applied in this case."
1972.70-279,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2504.842,2512.705,"Isn’t this problem, largely, one of having the right kind of cars at the right place when they’re needed, not necessarily what the total picture is?"
1972.70-279,1,16466,a_alvis_layne,,2512.705,2521.455,"Well of course, obviously, and this is what I was trying to prove and what I was trying to reach and get at in proving."
1972.70-279,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2528.517,2532.558,"Tell me again, why is it not available to you?"
1972.70-279,1,16466,a_alvis_layne,,2535.002,2566.972,"Because I had no such expert with nationwide experience, and the best and on-- the expert outside the railroad business that would know about this was precisely the same people that the Commission had had testify on the same points in prior proceeding, and I had every reason to know how they would testify because I had copies of their testimony or at least I had indications of their testimony."
1972.70-279,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2589.413,2592.897,"Thank you, Mr. Layne."
1972.70-279,2,39447,richard_a_hollander,,2594.953,2599.15,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1972.70-279,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2721.305,2728.439,Was it in the Second Circuit case-- was Judge Friendly’s-- was that a three-judge Court too?
1972.70-279,2,39447,richard_a_hollander,,2728.439,2729.531,"Yes, it was, Your Honor."
1972.70-279,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2729.531,2734.349,Was Judge Friendly’s opinion in conflict with the Florida Court?
1972.70-279,2,39447,richard_a_hollander,,2734.349,2735.884,"It was not, Your Honor."
1972.70-279,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2736.504,2739.653,"Well, was it in conflict on the record question?"
1972.70-279,2,39447,richard_a_hollander,,2739.653,2742.443,"It was not, Your Honor, because of this reason."
1972.70-279,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2769.707,2773.149,"Well, did Judge Friendly decide the on the record question or not?"
1972.70-279,2,39447,richard_a_hollander,,2773.149,2778.119,He decided very definitely that 556 and 557 governed.
1972.70-279,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2778.119,2784.594,But you don’t think that was in conflict with Allegheny-Ludlum because it deals with different sections of the Act?
1972.70-279,2,39447,richard_a_hollander,,2784.594,2789.225,"For the reasons stated by Mr. Layne, and that’s correct, yes."
1972.70-279,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3018.299,3030.569,"But you had 90 days, didn’t you, after receiving the interim report in which to make objection on the grounds of the inadequacy of the originating notice if you wanted to?"
1972.70-279,2,39447,richard_a_hollander,,3030.569,3032.176,Let me say several things.
1972.70-279,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3147.544,3163.737,"Well, Mr. Hollander, as a matter at least of theoretical operation, you’re not required to use other freight carriers and you’re not required, are you, to lend you freight cars to anyone else?"
1972.70-279,2,39447,richard_a_hollander,,3163.737,3171.941,"Let me say, Your Honor, that we are required to use other railroad’s boxcars."
1972.70-279,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3366.376,3368.189,"Mr. Hollander, lead me on a little further."
1972.70-279,2,39447,richard_a_hollander,,3368.189,3368.48,"Yes, sir."
1972.70-279,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3368.48,3376.869,Both you and Mr. Layne have spoken of this petition reopen being pending-- having been pending since July.
1972.70-279,2,39447,richard_a_hollander,,3378.085,3383.307,"There had been a serious-- may I stop and say that there had been a serious, since July up until September."
1972.70-279,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3383.307,3388.267,"Well, is that a long period in ICC experience or is it a very short one?"
1972.70-279,2,39447,richard_a_hollander,,3388.617,3389.017,If--
1972.70-279,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3389.017,3389.657,Take me on.
1972.70-279,2,39447,richard_a_hollander,,3389.657,3400.267,"If there is a critical shortage of boxcars, I would say they should’ve acted immediately upon some suspicion that this experiment is not working."
1972.70-279,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3514.65,3515.825,Thank you.
1972.70-279,3,41452,samuel_huntington,,3675.079,3521.104,Thank you.
1972.70-279,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3676.301,3677.144,"Thank you, Gentlemen."
