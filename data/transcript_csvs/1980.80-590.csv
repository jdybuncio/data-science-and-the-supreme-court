1980.80-590,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,8.513,We'll hear arguments next in Gulf Offshore Company against Mobil Oil.
1980.80-590,0,19335,charles_d_kennedy,,59.585,62.912,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1980.80-590,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,226.486,233.391,Do you think the '53 Act was primarily thought of in terms of personal injury jurisdiction?
1980.80-590,0,19335,charles_d_kennedy,,233.391,247.276,"No, Your Honor, I think it was thought of to encompass the entire activities on the Outer Continental Shelf beyond the Submerged Land Act's ceding of rights to territorial waters of the state."
1980.80-590,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,451.506,455.393,You're paraphrasing now from pages 3 and 4 of your brief?
1980.80-590,0,19335,charles_d_kennedy,,455.393,456.315,I'm paraphrasing; yes.
1980.80-590,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,498.454,512.716,"I was just going to say, it's on page three of your brief, Section B of the statute says the United States district courts shall have original jurisdiction of cases and controversies."
1980.80-590,0,19335,charles_d_kennedy,,535.955,551.199,"Yes, Your Honor, that's correct, and I think you have to look to the enactment, in its entirety, to see the Congressional scheme, and after we get through that, I think that the Congressional scheme within the Act itself will be sufficient."
1980.80-590,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,582.749,584.623,"And again, it doesn't say ""exclusively""."
1980.80-590,0,19335,charles_d_kennedy,,584.623,585.544,No.
1980.80-590,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,585.544,589.2,"But you want us to read it that way, I take it?"
1980.80-590,0,19335,charles_d_kennedy,,589.2,589.84,"Yes, Your Honor."
1980.80-590,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,592.666,613.735,"In our own Article III jurisdiction, as you no doubt know, the provision is, with respect to some kinds of cases our jurisdiction is original and exclusive, and with respect to others it's just original but not exclusive."
1980.80-590,0,19335,charles_d_kennedy,,613.735,614.72,That's right.
1980.80-590,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,645.176,673.416,"A state court is generally a court of general jurisdiction and if one party from Venezuela sues another party from Holland over an accident that happened 500 miles out at sea, unless there is some federal prohibition or statutory enactment prohibiting it, the federal court can take jurisdiction or the state court can take jurisdiction of that, can't it?"
1980.80-590,0,19335,charles_d_kennedy,,673.416,681.973,"--I think... of course, if we're getting out to sea I think we're getting into an entirely different area, where we're getting into the admiralty and maritime courts."
1980.80-590,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,694.438,695.626,How about Bremen v. Zapata?
1980.80-590,0,19335,charles_d_kennedy,,695.626,699.263,The federal courts took jurisdiction over that.
1980.80-590,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,742.528,745.387,"But it says, ""the provisions of this section""."
1980.80-590,0,19335,charles_d_kennedy,,753.148,773.14,"--Well, Your Honor, I don't know of any existing law at the time of the passage of the 1953 Act that gave any general jurisdiction to state courts over what happens on the high seas or, at that time, the Outer Continental Shelf."
1980.80-590,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,901.932,911.116,Is there any reason why the Texas state courts can't apply federal law the way they do under FELA and under 1983?
1980.80-590,0,19335,charles_d_kennedy,,911.116,918.285,I think you have to look at the compelling reasons for this under the Outer Continental Shelf Act itself.
1980.80-590,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,945.852,957.879,Isn't there an intermediate ground where you don't cede the territory back but you say that federal law may be applied in the courts of the adjacent state?
1980.80-590,0,19335,charles_d_kennedy,,957.879,964.639,But there is nothing in the Act to indicate that this was an intent of Congress.
1980.80-590,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1330.07,1333.023,Did these accidents take place on artificial islands?
1980.80-590,0,19335,charles_d_kennedy,,1333.023,1333.46,"Yes, Your Honor."
1980.80-590,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1333.46,1353.358,"Well, then, don't you have some trouble with Rodrigue on which you rely and the passage that says a compromise emerged, that federal law would prevail but that the states would have some jurisdiction to apply that federal law on artificial islands?"
1980.80-590,0,19335,charles_d_kennedy,,1353.358,1357.825,"I don't believe Rodrigue, Your Honor, in Rodrigue, that was at all the holding."
1980.80-590,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1367.041,1388.484,"Well, in Rodrigue it says, on page 365, that the special relationship between the men working on these artificial islands and the adjacent shore to which they commute to visit their families was also recognized by dropping the treatment of these structures as vessels and instead over the objections of the Administration that these islands were not really located within the states."
1980.80-590,0,19335,charles_d_kennedy,,1406.977,1413.506,--The whole approach there is applicable law.
1980.80-590,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1486.696,1489.07,I thought you said a moment ago that it was just a codification.
1980.80-590,0,19335,charles_d_kennedy,,1489.07,1498.644,"Well, it was a codification as far as all of these piecemeal legislations that have been adopted over the 25-year period from '53 to '78."
1980.80-590,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1564.508,1571.458,"Take your mind back to this construction, how do you think the Texas Court of Appeals viewed that construction?"
1980.80-590,0,19335,charles_d_kennedy,,1577.221,1580.096,"You're referring to the Liepelt construction now, Your Honor?"
1980.80-590,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1629.887,1633.48,Don't you think we should know or have some idea?
1980.80-590,0,19335,charles_d_kennedy,,1633.48,1635.277,As to whether this is Texas law?
1980.80-590,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1650.535,1654.597,"Well, is it clear now that this kind of an instruction could be given under federal law?"
1980.80-590,0,19335,charles_d_kennedy,,1654.597,1655.846,I think it's very clear.
1980.80-590,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1655.846,1656.752,But it wasn't then?
1980.80-590,0,19335,charles_d_kennedy,,1656.752,1657.736,"It was not, at that time."
1980.80-590,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1683.537,1685.865,Then you did ask for the instruction?
1980.80-590,0,19335,charles_d_kennedy,,1685.865,1687.896,We did ask for the instruction; it was refused.
1980.80-590,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1698.11,1701.999,"You anticipated the Liepelt decision, in effect, didn't you?"
1980.80-590,0,19335,charles_d_kennedy,,1701.999,1712.901,"Well, I didn't really anticipate the Liepelt decision but I knew sooner or later that the law had to recognize the fact that juries were continuously being confused by the fact that nobody would tell them what effect taxes had on them."
1980.80-590,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1739.437,1748.339,"So what if we disagree with you on the jurisdictional question, on the jurisdiction of the state courts, but agree with you on the instruction?"
1980.80-590,0,19335,charles_d_kennedy,,1748.339,1750.541,Then I think the case should be reversed and remanded.
1980.80-590,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1750.541,1751.495,It would be a new trial?
1980.80-590,0,19335,charles_d_kennedy,,1751.495,1752.166,What?
1980.80-590,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1752.166,1753.541,Would it be a new trial then?
1980.80-590,0,19335,charles_d_kennedy,,1753.541,1755.057,"If remanded, yes, sir."
1980.80-590,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1755.057,1756.773,On liability or damages or what?
1980.80-590,0,19335,charles_d_kennedy,,1756.773,1758.398,At least on damages.
1980.80-590,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1758.398,1763.849,"But, of course, if we agreed with you on this first... it would wipe out the entire--"
1980.80-590,0,19335,charles_d_kennedy,,1763.849,1765.051,"Yes, Your Honor."
1980.80-590,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1766.754,1771.393,--Is it... the jury set the damages?
1980.80-590,0,19335,charles_d_kennedy,,1771.393,1772.815,--Is what?
1980.80-590,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1772.815,1774.063,The jury found the damages?
1980.80-590,0,19335,charles_d_kennedy,,1774.063,1775.219,The jury found the damages.
1980.80-590,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1775.219,1775.985,All in one proceeding?
1980.80-590,0,19335,charles_d_kennedy,,1775.985,1777.359,All in one proceeding.
1980.80-590,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1787.417,1800.35,"But if we disagree with you on the jurisdictional issue and conclude that the state courts do have jurisdiction, might it not also follow that the state courts can apply their own rules of damages?"
1980.80-590,0,19335,charles_d_kennedy,,1805.629,1809.003,Not as long as it's inconsistent with federal law.
1980.80-590,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1818.702,1824.48,Is there a federal measure of damages in things like mental suffering and loss of consortium and all that?
1980.80-590,0,19335,charles_d_kennedy,,1826.043,1827.556,"--There is about taxes, there is about interest."
1980.80-590,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1828.806,1834.195,"No, but, you know, some of these like the Death on the High Seas Act and all, there have been different rules of damages with the state or federal--"
1980.80-590,0,19335,charles_d_kennedy,,1834.195,1836.225,"--Rodrigue has thrown that out, sir; that is not applicable."
1980.80-590,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1836.225,1842.723,"--So there's no federal rule of damages applicable with respect to just the measure of damages, putting aside taxation for the moment?"
1980.80-590,0,19335,charles_d_kennedy,,1842.723,1844.488,"There may be in certain areas, Your Honor."
1980.80-590,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1856.92,1858.357,There is now--
1980.80-590,0,19335,charles_d_kennedy,,1858.357,1859.981,--In this area--
1980.80-590,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1859.981,1860.294,--Federal law.
1980.80-590,0,19335,charles_d_kennedy,,1860.294,1860.7,--Right.
1980.80-590,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1860.7,1861.2,Your time has expired--
1980.80-590,0,19335,charles_d_kennedy,,1861.2,1861.872,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1980.80-590,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1861.872,1863.763,--Mr. Kennedy.
1980.80-590,1,23797,frank_e_caton,,1864.826,1869.885,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1980.80-590,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2205.813,2209.233,"Res judicata would prevent that, would it not?"
1980.80-590,1,23797,frank_e_caton,,2223.164,2224.538,"--I agree with that, Your Honor."
1980.80-590,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2564.31,2571.681,"Well, maybe you could suggest some way that we could hold that the state courts have exclusive jurisdiction?"
1980.80-590,1,23797,frank_e_caton,,2571.681,2577.554,"--No, that is something I'm sure that a number of judges I know would like to see happen, Your Honor."
1980.80-590,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2577.554,2580.163,You mean federal court judges?
1980.80-590,1,23797,frank_e_caton,,2580.163,2580.709,Federal courts.
1980.80-590,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2620.818,2624.832,Was Liepelt on the books when the trial took place?
1980.80-590,1,23797,frank_e_caton,,2624.832,2626.082,"--Well, Your Honor, it was on the books."
1980.80-590,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2631.064,2632.298,"About to be, but it wasn't?"
1980.80-590,1,23797,frank_e_caton,,2632.298,2634.828,But the arguments that were being made in this court--
1980.80-590,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2634.828,2636.359,"Yes, I know, but it wasn't, but it wasn't--"
1980.80-590,1,23797,frank_e_caton,,2636.359,2637.89,"--That's right, it was not binding, Your Honor."
1980.80-590,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2637.89,2644.34,--Your argument goes at least as far as that we shouldn't decide the instruction should have been given.
1980.80-590,1,23797,frank_e_caton,,2656.57,2658.725,"Your Honor, there's a very simple explanation for that."
1980.80-590,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2667.487,2670.235,It may be but then we ought to have the district judge decide that.
1980.80-590,1,23797,frank_e_caton,,2675.249,2675.999,"Your Honor, I think--"
1980.80-590,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2675.999,2678.357,"What's the evidence that's missing, Mr. Caton?"
1980.80-590,1,23797,frank_e_caton,,2678.357,2684.089,"--There is no evidence, Your Honor, but... All right, I'll tell you the evidence that I think should have been put in, briefly, one of the instructions."
1980.80-590,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2695.273,2695.818,1040 what?
1980.80-590,1,23797,frank_e_caton,,2695.818,2699.036,--The Form 1040; the IRS 1040 instruction book.
1980.80-590,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2744.643,2753.249,"So you're just saying that if we remand it for reconsideration in the light of Liepelt, it would just be a useless act?"
1980.80-590,1,23797,frank_e_caton,,2753.249,2755.655,You'd give them the second chance to do what they should have done the first time.
1980.80-590,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2759.778,2765.635,Mr. Jamail.
1980.80-590,2,31159,joseph_d_jamail,,2765.635,2769.524,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1980.80-590,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2909.779,2920.978,"What about a case in the federal court, the same kind of a case as this one, in the federal court that's filed and tried tomorrow?"
1980.80-590,2,31159,joseph_d_jamail,,2923.836,2929.115,--I believe that it would be error not to give it in a FELA case.
1980.80-590,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2929.115,2929.928,Not to give it; yes; not to give it.
1980.80-590,2,31159,joseph_d_jamail,,2929.928,2930.521,An FELA case.
1980.80-590,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2930.521,2932.004,"Well, I didn't ask you about that."
1980.80-590,2,31159,joseph_d_jamail,,2933.77,2935.598,A common law tort action?
1980.80-590,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2935.598,2951.294,"I'm asking you about it, about this kind of a case that arises on the Outer Continental Shelf and under this... and it's federal law borrowing state law except to the extent that it's inconsistent?"
1980.80-590,2,31159,joseph_d_jamail,,2951.294,2967.568,"I think that unless this Court desires to extend the Liepelt rule to a common law tort damage element action, which it did not do in the FELA case, because you were looking at a net pecuniary loss, where income taxes may have been--"
1980.80-590,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2967.568,2976.721,"Well, we aren't... we were extending it to a statutory, to a claim under a statute, aren't we?"
1980.80-590,2,31159,joseph_d_jamail,,2976.721,2978.346,"--Aha, Your Honor, but that's not so."
1980.80-590,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2978.346,2980.876,You didn't say we'd borrowed state law.
1980.80-590,2,31159,joseph_d_jamail,,2982.611,2986.843,This action was brought under a common law tort.
1980.80-590,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2991.45,2993.215,"Well, it certainly wasn't brought under state law."
1980.80-590,2,31159,joseph_d_jamail,,2993.215,2994.246,--The action?
1980.80-590,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2994.246,2995.183,Yes.
1980.80-590,2,31159,joseph_d_jamail,,2995.183,2997.027,"Well, it most certainly was, Your Honor."
1980.80-590,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2997.027,2997.509,How could it be?
1980.80-590,2,31159,joseph_d_jamail,,2997.509,3004.725,"Because, Your Honor, of the savings to suitors clause of the 1789 Judiciary Act gave them this right unless--"
1980.80-590,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3004.725,3009.52,"Oh, so you're saying this Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act doesn't apply at all?"
1980.80-590,2,31159,joseph_d_jamail,,3009.52,3010.317,"--No, I'm not."
1980.80-590,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3010.317,3014.956,"Is it federal or law or not, that controls this case?"
1980.80-590,2,31159,joseph_d_jamail,,3014.956,3016.643,"It is state law, and you've so stated--"
1980.80-590,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3016.643,3017.534,It's only borrowed.
1980.80-590,2,31159,joseph_d_jamail,,3021.453,3024.014,"--Borrowed, begged, or bought, Your Honor, it's still state law."
1980.80-590,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3024.014,3027.67,"Well, it isn't a cause of action under state law then?"
1980.80-590,2,31159,joseph_d_jamail,,3027.67,3028.764,"It is, Your Honor."
1980.80-590,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3028.764,3029.545,"Well, okay."
1980.80-590,2,31159,joseph_d_jamail,,3030.981,3037.557,"Well, Your Honor, unless we're ready to repeal the 1789 Judiciary Act, the savings to suitors clause, it's still state law."
1980.80-590,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3116.243,3132.44,"Well, the exclusive argument... if you're right, the exclusive argument is beside the point, because it's state law, and obviously you're not going to have some exclusive jurisdiction in the federal court over a state law cause of action."
1980.80-590,2,31159,joseph_d_jamail,,3132.44,3138.625,"But we have to address it, because this Court does have the right to interpret that statute, and I must address myself--"
1980.80-590,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3138.625,3140.718,So it is a cause of action under the statute?
1980.80-590,2,31159,joseph_d_jamail,,3140.718,3148.12,"--No, it is a cause of action applying state law, and if we're going to be semantical, state law under the statute."
1980.80-590,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3231.868,3235.257,"Mr. Jamail, may I get back to the Liepelt question again?"
1980.80-590,2,31159,joseph_d_jamail,,3235.257,3235.492,Yes.
1980.80-590,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3235.492,3238.366,I gather... do I correctly understand your argument?
1980.80-590,2,31159,joseph_d_jamail,,3243.863,3248.081,"I would have to, because Liepelt was talking about an FELA case."
1980.80-590,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3248.081,3248.393,I know.
1980.80-590,2,31159,joseph_d_jamail,,3256.624,3258.857,"Yes, and I hope and pray that that's what this Court will write."
1980.80-590,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3258.857,3260.965,"Well, you would say it would be error to give it."
1980.80-590,2,31159,joseph_d_jamail,,3264.808,3276.694,"I think it would be under the existing Louisiana law, as it was at the time, Justice White, because we had case law, Louisiana law, and incidentally, there is no confusion under which law this case was tried under."
1980.80-590,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3297.044,3298.777,There's nothing wrong with being cross-wise with me.
1980.80-590,2,31159,joseph_d_jamail,,3299.574,3302.324,--I'm crosswise with too many people already.
1980.80-590,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3564.141,3566.454,"Thank you, gentlemen."
