1985.85-5319,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,6.746,We will hear arguments next in Darden against Wainwright.
1985.85-5319,0,39543,robert_a_harper_jr,,80.063,81.034,Thank you.
1985.85-5319,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,373.297,375.619,"What is wrong with that sort of an argument, counsel?"
1985.85-5319,0,39543,robert_a_harper_jr,,377.529,382.902,"--Well, Your Honor, I think he does have to say something, but I think it has to be proper."
1985.85-5319,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,382.902,388.605,Is there some constitutional standard of propriety that you see in our cases?
1985.85-5319,0,39543,robert_a_harper_jr,,388.605,393.35,"Yes, sir, particularly in a death case."
1985.85-5319,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,405.447,419.316,"You say, then, that the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution prohibits a prosecutor in a death case from saying to the jury, members of the jury, it might have been you who was killed?"
1985.85-5319,0,39543,robert_a_harper_jr,,419.316,422.639,"--Well, that is just one of the first instances."
1985.85-5319,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,422.639,425.07,"But I take it, though, that is what you are saying."
1985.85-5319,0,39543,robert_a_harper_jr,,425.07,426.579,That is one thing he said.
1985.85-5319,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,427.771,429.852,And you say it is unconstitutional for him to say that.
1985.85-5319,0,39543,robert_a_harper_jr,,429.852,437.358,"--What I am saying more particularly is unconstitutional is, there should be another defendant in this courtroom, but alas, I know of no charges to bring against--"
1985.85-5319,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,437.358,448.605,"Well, but you started out ticking off your claims as to how this prosecutor had fallen short, and I thought the first one you gave was, he said to the members of the jury, this might have been you."
1985.85-5319,0,39543,robert_a_harper_jr,,452.977,460.213,"--Well, Your Honor, that golden rule argument, I was saying... what I have said was, there were 27 instances of misconduct."
1985.85-5319,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,460.213,461.074,"Well, how... you--"
1985.85-5319,0,39543,robert_a_harper_jr,,461.074,463.285,And not all of them maybe rise to the constitutional level.
1985.85-5319,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,687.01,694.356,--Your point is that that is an unconstitutional... that argument rises to the level of a constitutional standard.
1985.85-5319,0,39543,robert_a_harper_jr,,694.356,696.057,"I am sorry, sir?"
1985.85-5319,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,696.057,710.386,"The argument that he shouldn't have been let out of the prison before, and that if he is let out again, he might be out on the public, do you say that is an improper, impermissible argument constitutionally?"
1985.85-5319,0,39543,robert_a_harper_jr,,710.386,743.028,"Your Honor, future dangerousness is a different issue from what I am trying to say is overall, considering the total circumstances of a racially charged courtroom setting in a rural area of mid-Florida in 1973, where the prosecutor entreats the jury during voir dire that, can you try Willie Darden as if he was white, then saying that their particular argument, that, you know, there are particular words that are permissible, but they are included in the context of impermissible argument."
1985.85-5319,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,757.66,759.509,Constitutionally impermissible?
1985.85-5319,0,39543,robert_a_harper_jr,,760.448,761.45,Your Honor--
1985.85-5319,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,761.45,763.731,Improper may be one thing--
1985.85-5319,0,39543,robert_a_harper_jr,,763.731,764.232,--Yes.
1985.85-5319,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,764.232,765.534,--as a matter of good taste.
1985.85-5319,0,39543,robert_a_harper_jr,,769.454,785.466,"I think there are certain segments of the argument that pass constitutional muster, but considering the argument as a whole, the calculated and designed effect it had to inflame the jury, it was a model in its total context."
1985.85-5319,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,794.422,796.513,When was this crime committed?
1985.85-5319,0,39543,robert_a_harper_jr,,796.513,800.235,"This crime was committed on September the 8th, 1973."
1985.85-5319,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,800.235,801.497,1973.
1985.85-5319,0,39543,robert_a_harper_jr,,801.497,801.975,"Yes, sir."
1985.85-5319,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,801.975,812.924,So you think it is constitutionally impermissible for a lawyer in the courtroom to criticize the system of justice that lets this kind of a matter run that long?
1985.85-5319,0,39543,robert_a_harper_jr,,817.328,818.21,"Yes, sir."
1985.85-5319,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,818.21,826.505,--the prosecutor to be critical of the system of justice that takes 13 years to get something completed?
1985.85-5319,0,39543,robert_a_harper_jr,,826.505,830.947,"Your Honor, it wasn't 13 years old when he said that."
1985.85-5319,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,903.173,906.135,Did you say it is the third time it has been here?
1985.85-5319,0,39543,robert_a_harper_jr,,906.135,908.676,"Yes, sir."
1985.85-5319,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,984.117,990.331,"Well, Murphy was sitting there while the judge had made his introductory statements in that regard, wasn't he?"
1985.85-5319,0,39543,robert_a_harper_jr,,990.331,999.768,"Your Honor, that cannot be gleaned from the record, and I would submit, Justice Rehnquist, that a contrary inference could be drawn from the record."
1985.85-5319,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1019.661,1027.535,"Well, but if there is a debate on that, I think that our cases on federal habeas review say that you presume the judge applied the correct standard."
1985.85-5319,0,39543,robert_a_harper_jr,,1027.535,1035.84,"Yes, sir, but I don't think that presumption can apply in this case, and the reason I say that are two."
1985.85-5319,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1061.576,1071.833,"If you should prevail, counsel, on the juror Murphy issue, what is the result, vacation of the conviction or only of the death penalty?"
1985.85-5319,0,39543,robert_a_harper_jr,,1071.833,1073.653,"Only of the death penalty, Your Honor."
1985.85-5319,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1084.442,1094.958,Mr. Prospect.
1985.85-5319,1,40185,richard_w_prospect,,1094.958,1115.662,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, with regards to the first remarks that Mr. Harper made, I would like to relate to the Court historically that nine years ago when we argued this case another lawyer appeared on behalf of Mr. Darden and gave essentially the same attack on the statements of the prosecutor."
1985.85-5319,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1326.6,1332.745,Has there ever been a finding about effective assistance of counsel in this case?
1985.85-5319,1,40185,richard_w_prospect,,1332.745,1333.944,"Yes, sir."
1985.85-5319,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1333.944,1334.775,There has been?
1985.85-5319,1,40185,richard_w_prospect,,1336.047,1338.489,That has been consistent throughout.
1985.85-5319,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1342.83,1354.979,"Well, while I have you interrupted, do you agree that there are some arguments that get to the point where they are constitutionally impermissible?"
1985.85-5319,1,40185,richard_w_prospect,,1354.979,1361.443,"If viewed by themselves under different circumstances and perhaps in a different case, yes, sir."
1985.85-5319,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1367.587,1375.292,"I keep hearing that, but I have difficulty finding a case that after saying that they reversed."
1985.85-5319,1,40185,richard_w_prospect,,1375.292,1377.725,--That is true.
1985.85-5319,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1496.754,1500.356,Was this the issue before us when it was here before?
1985.85-5319,1,40185,richard_w_prospect,,1500.356,1502.157,"Yes, sir, and only the issue."
1985.85-5319,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1502.157,1503.627,And that is when you were here before?
1985.85-5319,1,40185,richard_w_prospect,,1503.627,1504.388,"Yes, sir."
1985.85-5319,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1504.388,1506.631,And we dismissed as improvidently granted?
1985.85-5319,1,40185,richard_w_prospect,,1506.631,1507.12,"Yes, sir."
1985.85-5319,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1507.12,1509.911,"It was just a line, no opinion?"
1985.85-5319,1,40185,richard_w_prospect,,1509.911,1511.334,"Just a line, sir."
1985.85-5319,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2118.051,2124.094,"May I ask, because it was argued, are you going to comment on the Witherspoon problem in your presentation?"
1985.85-5319,1,40185,richard_w_prospect,,2127.817,2128.198,"Yes, sir."
1985.85-5319,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2129.858,2142.557,"And in your brief, I notice you state that the venirman Murphy told the trial judge his principles were such that he could not vote to recommend a penalty regardless of the facts, but that is not what he told the jury, is it?"
1985.85-5319,1,40185,richard_w_prospect,,2145.678,2147.501,Of Mr. Murphy?
1985.85-5319,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2147.501,2150.333,He was asked whether he could do that without violating his own scruples.
1985.85-5319,1,40185,richard_w_prospect,,2150.333,2150.782,His principles.
1985.85-5319,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2150.782,2151.333,Yes.
1985.85-5319,1,40185,richard_w_prospect,,2152.745,2153.683,"Yes, I do."
1985.85-5319,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2172.367,2175.059,I wanted to break my question in two parts.
1985.85-5319,1,40185,richard_w_prospect,,2184.124,2185.995,Perhaps--
1985.85-5319,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2185.995,2188.408,They were asked there whether they had scruples against the death penalty.
1985.85-5319,1,40185,richard_w_prospect,,2188.408,2195.842,"--Perhaps relating to the statute, but the question asked in Witherspoon had nothing to do with the statute in terms of the language."
1985.85-5319,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2206.568,2212.892,"Well, the statute provided if you have conscientious scruples against capital punishment, you can be excused for cause."
1985.85-5319,1,40185,richard_w_prospect,,2212.892,2214.204,And I--
1985.85-5319,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2214.204,2225.05,"Do you think today if a venirman is asked if he has conscientious scruples against capital punishment, and he says yes, would that be sufficient to justify his using it for cause?"
1985.85-5319,1,40185,richard_w_prospect,,2225.05,2225.991,"--No, I don't think it would."
1985.85-5319,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2225.991,2228.533,"Well, why isn't that precisely the question that was asked here?"
1985.85-5319,1,40185,richard_w_prospect,,2228.533,2238.17,"Because Mr. Murphy was asked, do you have any principles in opposition such that you could not participate in a recommendation of the sentence of death."
1985.85-5319,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2238.17,2239.95,Without violating those principles.
1985.85-5319,1,40185,richard_w_prospect,,2239.95,2241.653,Without violating those principles.
1985.85-5319,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2241.653,2248.288,Do you think it is impossible that a person could violate his own principles if the law required him to do so?
1985.85-5319,1,40185,richard_w_prospect,,2248.288,2250.038,Is it possible to violate?
1985.85-5319,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2250.038,2251.819,"Yes, that is exactly what--"
1985.85-5319,1,40185,richard_w_prospect,,2251.819,2252.86,"Yes, I think it is possible."
1985.85-5319,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2252.86,2256.103,--Then he hasn't said you couldn't vote against the death penalty.
1985.85-5319,1,40185,richard_w_prospect,,2259.746,2267.19,"Well, it would be my position that the violating of his principles would represent an impairment of his ability to follow the law."
1985.85-5319,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2267.19,2267.971,I see.
1985.85-5319,1,40185,richard_w_prospect,,2267.971,2269.363,That is my position on that.
1985.85-5319,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2269.363,2278.807,Then I suppose you would say that the statute held invalid... the Illinois statute held invalid in Witherspoon is now valid under the later case?
1985.85-5319,1,40185,richard_w_prospect,,2278.807,2279.778,"Yes, sir."
1985.85-5319,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2279.778,2282.59,"Witherspoon has been overruled, is your position."
1985.85-5319,1,40185,richard_w_prospect,,2285.111,2286.303,I don't know I would go that far.
1985.85-5319,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2286.303,2288.324,You just did.
1985.85-5319,1,40185,richard_w_prospect,,2288.324,2295.5,"If I could explain my answer, I don't think the statute was as much in issue in Witherspoon as it was the lack of questioning which trapped the statute."
1985.85-5319,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2315.762,2322.296,"In other words, you are saying if they had asked that additional question, which of course they didn't ask here, either, as to whether they could--"
1985.85-5319,1,40185,richard_w_prospect,,2322.296,2328.759,"--No, no, they didn't ask additional questions, but previous questions were asked at least 14 times."
1985.85-5319,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2328.759,2330.582,--Of this juror?
1985.85-5319,1,40185,richard_w_prospect,,2330.582,2331.641,"No, sir."
1985.85-5319,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2422.372,2438.992,"Well, may I ask, do you think that the record before the particular question was asked of Murphy is clear enough so that if the judge had just said to Mr. Murphy, is there any reason why you can't sit in this case, and he had said no, that he could then have been... I am sorry."
1985.85-5319,1,40185,richard_w_prospect,,2449.109,2452.593,"That is quite all right, sir."
1985.85-5319,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2457.365,2462.688,"You are relying heavily on what was said in the general discussion rather than on this particular question, is really what I am trying to--"
1985.85-5319,1,40185,richard_w_prospect,,2462.688,2472.926,"--I am relying on it, Your Honor, but I still don't abandon the position that the question is sufficient under Witt to demonstrate that Mr. Murphy could not follow the law."
1985.85-5319,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2472.926,2477.267,"--If it weren't for Witt, would you agree it was plainly insufficient under Witherspoon."
1985.85-5319,1,40185,richard_w_prospect,,2484.323,2491.186,"To a certain degree, but no, I believe it would have been sufficient under Witherspoon simply because we don't know the exact questions asked in Witherspoon."
1985.85-5319,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2491.186,2508.977,"But we do know from the first paragraph of the Witherspoon opinion that questions complying with the Illinois statute were not sufficient, and the questions complying with the Illinois statute are substantially in the language that this trial judge, who had had no experience in death cases, as I understand it, asked in this case."
1985.85-5319,1,40185,richard_w_prospect,,2508.977,2509.898,That is true.
1985.85-5319,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2846.558,2849.67,"Do you have anything further, Mr. Harper?"
1985.85-5319,2,39543,robert_a_harper_jr,,2849.67,2851.691,"Yes, sir, Your Honor."
1985.85-5319,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2912.803,2917.065,What do you have to say about the failure of an objection?
1985.85-5319,2,39543,robert_a_harper_jr,,2920.738,2937.657,"The magistrate found there was an objection, firstly, Mr. Chief Justice, and what was at... it is in the appendix at Page 240... excuse me, the appendix at 214, late and tentative."
1985.85-5319,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2951.097,2955.309,What does the transcript of the trial show with respect to an objection?
1985.85-5319,2,39543,robert_a_harper_jr,,2955.309,2965.818,"Your Honor, in my opinion it shows defense counsel alternatively rising to object to the argument in two separate instances."
1985.85-5319,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2965.818,2974.162,And what was the specific objection made in those two instances?
1985.85-5319,2,39543,robert_a_harper_jr,,2976.994,2987.1,One... the second objection was... that is about the fifth time the state has said he wished the defendant would kill himself.
1985.85-5319,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3022.402,3036.503,"Mr. Harper, how do you read the magistrate's... is it a finding, defense counsel's objection to the prosecutor's argument was late and tentative?"
1985.85-5319,2,39543,robert_a_harper_jr,,3037.462,3049.84,"I read it to mean that there was an objection, albeit late, albeit a little weak, but there was an objection."
1985.85-5319,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3049.84,3054.174,What about the testimony of the lawyer at the habeas hearing?
