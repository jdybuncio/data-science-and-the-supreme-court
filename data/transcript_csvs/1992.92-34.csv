1992.92-34,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,12.199,"We'll hear argument next in Number 92-34, Musick, Peeler & Garrett, et al. v. Employers Insurance of Wausau."
1992.92-34,0,18439,charles_a_bird,,60.982,66.754,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1992.92-34,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,300.669,309.595,I suppose that footnote sort of grandfathered the implied cause of action under 10(b).
1992.92-34,0,18439,charles_a_bird,,309.595,314.168,--That footnote did not discuss the implied contribution under section 10(b).
1992.92-34,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,314.168,316.561,"No, not contribution, just cause of action."
1992.92-34,0,18439,charles_a_bird,,316.561,322.726,The implied cause of action under 10(b) itself was grandfathered as far back as Bankers Life.
1992.92-34,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,431.959,440.374,Did we ever pretend when we created the 10(b) cause of action that Congress intended that cause of action to exist?
1992.92-34,0,18439,charles_a_bird,,440.374,454.444,"--No, Justice Scalia, you acquiesced in the lower court's 10b-5 cause of action under standards which differ profoundly from the standards that this Court now uses to determine whether there shall be implied rights of--"
1992.92-34,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,454.444,477.961,"So under a Lampf kind of analysis, having created 10b-5 actions, which you might say without any express indication of congressional intent, why shouldn't we continue to round out the scheme without any indication of congressional intent?"
1992.92-34,0,18439,charles_a_bird,,477.961,480.643,--Contribution is not rounding out.
1992.92-34,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,521.938,531.684,You think we're just... we think we'd just be off-base if we tried to devine what Congress' intention might be if it thought about it.
1992.92-34,0,18439,charles_a_bird,,531.684,533.677,"I do, Your Honor, very much so."
1992.92-34,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,563.877,572.473,Congress... don't you think Congress has embraced the notion of a cause of action under 10(b)?
1992.92-34,0,18439,charles_a_bird,,572.473,582.04,"I believe Congress has... beyond any question, has embraced the notion that victims of violations of section 10(b)--"
1992.92-34,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,582.04,583.001,So your answer's yes.
1992.92-34,0,18439,charles_a_bird,,583.001,583.362,--Yes.
1992.92-34,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,583.362,584.203,It's just plain yes.
1992.92-34,0,18439,charles_a_bird,,584.203,584.724,Yes.
1992.92-34,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,603.179,610.021,But it has said in comparable sections... maybe you don't think they're comparable... that there should be contribution.
1992.92-34,0,18439,charles_a_bird,,610.021,613.715,"--I do not believe they are comparable, though I would--"
1992.92-34,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,613.715,614.526,What if they were?
1992.92-34,0,18439,charles_a_bird,,627.242,639.23,"--I would still argue that the Court should not engage in that kind of reasoning by analogy that says well, Congress did it here, and Congress did it there, so Congress would have done it if it had only known."
1992.92-34,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,639.23,641.433,"Well, we did it for the statute of limitations."
1992.92-34,0,18439,charles_a_bird,,641.433,645.214,"But that was an entirely different situation, Your Honor where you were--"
1992.92-34,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,645.214,646.284,"Well, it always is."
1992.92-34,0,18439,charles_a_bird,,665.201,670.183,"--The analysis in... you could have, but you did not."
1992.92-34,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,670.183,670.704,Right.
1992.92-34,0,18439,charles_a_bird,,670.704,672.247,"The Court did not do that, Your Honor."
1992.92-34,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,705.438,707.259,"Well, why doesn't... I'm sorry."
1992.92-34,0,18439,charles_a_bird,,774.322,780.395,"Because initially, Your Honor, you do not approach these people as defendants."
1992.92-34,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,797.838,808.676,"Well, if... may I just interrupt you and ask this: if we get over the question of whether to call them plaintiffs or whether to call them defendants, do they not have essentially the same equitable argument to make:"
1992.92-34,0,18439,charles_a_bird,,828.368,832.251,"--Justice Souter, that is an issue of pure policy."
1992.92-34,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,847.482,857.627,"May I... first of all, you don't really draw a distinction between whether the contribution claim is asserted after a judgment or after settlement or before, do you?"
1992.92-34,0,18439,charles_a_bird,,857.627,859.289,"I do not, Justice Stevens."
1992.92-34,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,859.289,863.199,"I just wanted to be sure, because then it wouldn't matter whether you call them plaintiff or defendant in that context."
1992.92-34,0,18439,charles_a_bird,,888.739,891.73,"Your Honor, you do not."
1992.92-34,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,902.876,909.211,"It's certainly more than an acorn, and there are a lot of cases out there and there have been for a good many years."
1992.92-34,0,18439,charles_a_bird,,913.865,928.525,"--Well, perhaps it's a little sapling, but it certainly does not have the dignity that the 10b-5 cause of action had when it reached this Court in Bankers Life, nor does it have even the theoretical underpinnings of that."
1992.92-34,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1528.402,1537.488,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1992.92-34,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1592.623,1599.318,"Well, is this contribution between defendants, or contribution from nonparty defendants?"
1992.92-34,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1599.318,1604.422,It's contribution among the persons who would be liable to the plaintiff under section--
1992.92-34,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1604.422,1607.854,So they are people who weren't parties.
1992.92-34,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1607.854,1624.855,"--They are people who may not necessarily have been parties, but people whose liability was established by the conduct that gave rise to the 10(b) action or in the comparable Securities Act express remedies, the violation of section 9, section 18, and section 11."
1992.92-34,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1627.048,1638.144,"That's point to be tried, though, isn't it, or not... whether, indeed, their conduct made them liable for this damage?"
1992.92-34,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1638.144,1645.578,"--Yes, it would be, but their liability would be established by the conduct that occurred at the time of the violation of section 10(b)."
1992.92-34,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1755.225,1758.797,"If it's such a terrific approach, why have we abandoned it--"
1992.92-34,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1758.797,1759.877,You have not abandoned--
1992.92-34,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1759.877,1760.378,--For everything except 10(b)?
1992.92-34,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1760.378,1799.814,"--We submit that the Court has considered 10(b) cases... 10 10(b) cases over the last 22 years, and for all intents and purposes that precise methodology, visited most recently 2 years ago in Lampf, involved that same process, consulting the statutory framework from which 10(b) arose, the analogue... most comparable provisions of the section comparable to section 10(b) section... in that case section 11, section... and particularly section 9 and 18 of the 1934 act, and that is the methodology that the Court applied."
1992.92-34,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1816.477,1826.324,"Well, Mr. Olson, though, don't Texas Industries and Northwest Airlines indicates that a contribution action is separate?"
1992.92-34,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1830.846,1831.577,"Well, we have--"
1992.92-34,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1831.577,1835.761,--Which might move it beyond Lampf.
1992.92-34,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1835.761,1837.69,--I've several responses to that.
1992.92-34,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2133.794,2138.368,"Well, maybe--"
1992.92-34,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2144.812,2146.823,"You don't have to elect, but--"
1992.92-34,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2146.823,2151.708,--Why can't you just plead them all and ask for contribution as to the former but not as to 10(b)?
1992.92-34,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2151.708,2152.789,--You could do that.
1992.92-34,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2172.653,2173.625,"Well, that may be true."
1992.92-34,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2179.409,2185.643,"--Well, but it could be used by a plaintiff as a repealer to avoid--"
1992.92-34,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2185.643,2186.522,Only if he elects.
1992.92-34,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2186.522,2199.181,"--If he elects, but Congress, when it established a mechanism for enforcement through private remedies of securities fraud clearly wanted contribution to be a part."
1992.92-34,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2503.962,2506.206,"Thank you, Mr. Olson."
1992.92-34,2,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,2508.376,2520.204,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1992.92-34,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2604.049,2613.836,"Mr. Long, do you think in recent cases we've said that the courts have the power to create causes of action?"
1992.92-34,2,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,2613.836,2623.343,"Well, I think what we have here is, we would agree this is a cause of action, but it's not an independent cause of action."
1992.92-34,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2659.001,2678.263,"Well, you might think that if Congress has expressly created the cause of action and we lack the power to create a right of contribution that a fortiori there wouldn't be such a right if it's only an implied cause of action in the first place."
1992.92-34,2,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,2678.263,2713.957,"Well, again, the approach the Court has followed is when it has implied the cause of action it has undertaken the necessary process of defining the contours of that action of rounding it out, and where the question is whether there should be a right of contribution, we see no essential difference between answering that question and answering the kinds of questions that this Court has answered in many prior cases under section 10(b), whether to recognize a defense, the measure of damages... this is really, we think, just another question in that line."
1992.92-34,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2713.957,2725.347,"Well, to the extent that it is a new cause of action, it seems to me it's a step beyond questions about whether there should be a statute of limitations or a defense."
1992.92-34,2,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,2725.347,2735.271,"I would agree with you that it's a step beyond in that sense, but again, I would emphasize this is quite different from implying a freestanding cause of action."
1992.92-34,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2776.171,2783.313,"I wonder what underlies that policy choice in these other sections, or under 10b-5."
1992.92-34,2,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,2797.955,2814.047,The Commission reached this conclusion because it decided as a matter of fairness and as a matter of evenhanded administration of the securities laws that a contribution right ought to be recognized under section 10(b).
1992.92-34,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2814.047,2815.008,"Well, how does that work out?"
1992.92-34,2,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,2831.309,2832.2,That's part of it.
1992.92-34,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2867.466,2869.219,In our--
1992.92-34,2,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,2879.503,2887.949,"To the... well, of course, that would... it's possible for the plaintiff, the victim, not to name all the possible defendants."
1992.92-34,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2894.553,2897.087,But that would be within the plaintiff's own power?
1992.92-34,2,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,2897.087,2898.087,Yes.
1992.92-34,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2900.578,2902.591,"So I mean, if the plaintiff suffers, it's the plaintiff's own fault--"
1992.92-34,2,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,2902.591,2902.761,--Oh--
1992.92-34,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2902.761,2904.251,--On Justice White's hypothesis.
1992.92-34,2,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,2904.251,2914.248,"--Well, the plaintiff may be quite confident, or reasonably confident on getting a full recovery, because it is joint and several liability, and if the plaintiff knows it's got a deep pocket--"
1992.92-34,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2914.248,2924.974,"Well, wouldn't you... would you guess that most plaintiffs would be in favor of the Commission's suggested policy... contribution?"
1992.92-34,2,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,2927.175,2931.088,--I think most plaintiffs would not want to have contribution.
1992.92-34,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2931.088,2931.799,Because--
1992.92-34,2,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,2931.799,2940.816,"The absence of contribution I think gives plaintiffs additional control over the lawsuit, I think is the short answer to that."
1992.92-34,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3033.485,3034.937,"--Thank you, Mr. Long."
1992.92-34,3,18439,charles_a_bird,,3037.94,3040.46,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1992.92-34,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3202.045,3203.867,"Thank you, Mr. Bird."
