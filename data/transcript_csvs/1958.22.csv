1958.22,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,708.043,711.981,Did they -- the majority apply New York law?
1958.22,0,22715,edward_j_malament,,711.981,716.644,"It is not quite clear, sir, whether they did or not from the opinion."
1958.22,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,755.905,758.841,What law do you think?
1958.22,0,22715,edward_j_malament,,758.841,775.872,"In my opinion, sir, I think there's absolutely no question from the decisions of this Court that this was a maritime tort and therefore, the general or federal maritime law applies exclusively."

1958.22,0,22715,edward_j_malament,,845.793,846.51,There's negligence.

1958.22,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,909.514,912.488,"But negligence is a common law action, is it not?"
1958.22,0,22715,edward_j_malament,,912.488,912.985,"Well, no."

1958.22,0,22715,edward_j_malament,,930.206,930.948,"Exactly, sir."
1958.22,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,931.156,932.17,"Oh, that's what I thought."
1958.22,0,22715,edward_j_malament,,932.17,932.719,Precisely.
1958.22,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,947.592,951.411,Was that -- was that -- please inform me.
1958.22,0,22715,edward_j_malament,,971.32,989.673,"My recollection is, sir, and I authored this differently, my recollection is that these -- the cases in which the doctrine of comparative negligence was adopted, Max Morris case, then later on annunciated, and the Pope & Talbot case were cases involving both negligence and unseaworthiness."
1958.22,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1114.266,1127.694,"Of course, in this case, in view of the jury's verdict in favor of the plaintiff, is the question merely before us as to whether comparative negligence -- as to whether contributory negligence is a complete bar or -- or (Voice Overlap) --"
1958.22,0,22715,edward_j_malament,,1127.694,1130.087,I'm just about to address myself to that.
1958.22,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1166.81,1179.513,"Now, in view again of the jury's verdict in favor of the plaintiff, doesn't it follow that the jury necessarily found that the -- that there was actual notice in -- because of the instructions?"
1958.22,0,22715,edward_j_malament,,1179.513,1179.958,"Well, except --"
1958.22,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1179.958,1180.325,(Voice Overlap) --
1958.22,0,22715,edward_j_malament,,1180.325,1183.379,"-- that -- I would say so, I would say so."
1958.22,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1536.693,1542.425,(Inaudible)
1958.22,0,22715,edward_j_malament,,1542.425,1563.236,"I wish that were so but I think you will find -- in fact, there is one case that's now pending before this Court, the McDaniel's case, I believe, where there is some question as to whether these government officials, in one fashion or another, may be invitees."
1958.22,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1581.191,1583.849,"By confusion, you mean different States have different view?"
1958.22,0,22715,edward_j_malament,,1583.849,1584.339,Precisely.
1958.22,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1604.23,1606.459,"Well, this very -- this very case illustrates that."
1958.22,0,22715,edward_j_malament,,1616.212,1616.693,Correct.
1958.22,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1618.623,1619.588,"Well, that's -- that's different."
1958.22,0,22715,edward_j_malament,,1620.281,1626.3,"Well, any -- I agree with you, Your Honor, and just a right ahead of myself a little bit."
1958.22,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1626.3,1634.348,But it makes a difference (Inaudible) whether -- what the answer to Justice Douglas' question.
1958.22,0,22715,edward_j_malament,,1646.714,1648.693,"I agree, Your Honor, if -- in New York state law --"
1958.22,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1648.693,1660.29,What you call confusion is no more of confusion than the -- than different shades of decisions on rightly a different fact from this Court and offers every subject to the law.
1958.22,0,22715,edward_j_malament,,1660.29,1663.597,"If I may, sir, I would say that -- well, that is basically correct."
1958.22,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1686.093,1696.054,"I have a very different problem if my job, as to the best of my ability, to be able to state with my conscience and my mind what the New York law on that subject is."
1958.22,0,22715,edward_j_malament,,1704.715,1705.72,I agree with Your Honor.
1958.22,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1705.72,1710.469,And so there's a different problem if you ask us and in a way you should or should (Inaudible)
1958.22,0,22715,edward_j_malament,,1710.469,1710.908,"Well, I --"
1958.22,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1710.908,1713.79,But you'd rather not that we should decide what the federal law is about.
1958.22,0,22715,edward_j_malament,,1713.79,1714.486,Exactly what --
1958.22,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1714.486,1715.872,Made out of false laws.
1958.22,0,22715,edward_j_malament,,1715.872,1728.979,"But precisely, you'll find out in my -- in my third point and which I say the time has come to exorcise this body of law and to do, by judicial declaration, what was done last year in 1957 in England."
1958.22,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1728.979,1730.18,You've put in an appendix.
1958.22,0,22715,edward_j_malament,,1734.379,1734.719,There -- I --
1958.22,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1734.719,1735.432,Did you put in that appendix?
1958.22,0,22715,edward_j_malament,,1735.432,1736.267,"I did, sir."
1958.22,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1736.267,1740.215,"So that's another way of doing it, if may say so, much better way, I believe."
1958.22,0,22715,edward_j_malament,,1740.215,1743.0,I -- I thought that it was time to -- to bring it to the attention of the Court.
1958.22,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1743.0,1748.877,"Yes, but that's not -- it's not having the Court exorcise all the past."
1958.22,0,22715,edward_j_malament,,1748.877,1751.565,I will accept the suggestion.
1958.22,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2017.084,2018.01,That's the British.
1958.22,0,22715,edward_j_malament,,2018.01,2019.002,The British Act.
1958.22,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2068.525,2073.636,"If New York law governed, there would be liability for negligence."
1958.22,0,22715,edward_j_malament,,2073.636,2074.82,"There certainly would, sir, in any event."
1958.22,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2074.82,2080.871,"Well, that's your statement of rewarding a person with negligent that means -- cover this case."
1958.22,0,22715,edward_j_malament,,2080.871,2081.045,Except --
1958.22,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2081.045,2086.565,And the problem really is whether New York law should govern or whether this is action of general admiralty law.
1958.22,0,22715,edward_j_malament,,2093.205,2100.028,I consulted the Court in that distinction except that I think that these -- these are not separate issues.
1958.22,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2123.97,2124.749,I understand that.
1958.22,0,22715,edward_j_malament,,2139.161,2140.982,"Except for one observation, Your Honor."
1958.22,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2170.733,2181.538,"All I'm saying is -- I don't know what the facts are and what the jury found, all they are saying is that you can't (Inaudible) negligence to them, to the shipowner, you should be held liable."
1958.22,0,22715,edward_j_malament,,2181.538,2184.776,"Well, I suppose that is perhaps a permissible interpretation."
1958.22,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2215.912,2218.202,"Well, that's a negligence claim."
1958.22,0,22715,edward_j_malament,,2226.169,2226.412,Correct.
1958.22,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2226.412,2233.039,(Inaudible) and it's found there wasn't any (Inaudible) found there was no negligence.
1958.22,0,22715,edward_j_malament,,2233.039,2255.938,"That was the holding of the case except that there were overtones in that case if the Court recalls, that as to the father, there was no danger, no real -- that the vessel in a sense was unseaworthy because of the arrangement of the place for that tack, if I recall the holding correctly."
1958.22,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2278.553,2279.255,He was a guest.
1958.22,0,22715,edward_j_malament,,2279.255,2280.841,He was a guest.

1958.22,0,22715,edward_j_malament,,2629.788,2637.078,Where it is -- the act of negligence is an affirmative act of an employee acting within the scope of his duties.

1958.22,0,22715,edward_j_malament,,2826.685,2827.345,Well --
1958.22,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2827.345,2828.539,Is it a corporation?
1958.22,0,22715,edward_j_malament,,2828.539,2833.689,"Yes, the Court said that under certain circumstances, knowledge could be imputed."

1958.22,0,22715,edward_j_malament,,2840.724,2852.762,"I think, in fairness to what Judge Murphy was trying to say in his request to charge where a colloquy with counsel, it was that a corporation can only be held responsible through the acts of employees, he did say that."
1958.22,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2852.762,2860.897,"Well, I -- I just haven't quite understood yet with your argument, what the Court held with reference to knowledge."

1958.22,1,25370,george_a_garvey,,3746.95,3749.082,I think it'd become a law in any event because I --

1958.22,1,25370,george_a_garvey,,3749.671,3751.058,-- I think it would be a common law.
1958.22,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3751.058,3751.989,Why?
1958.22,1,25370,george_a_garvey,,3751.989,3757.217,"Well, I don't see why it would be anything else and the relationship between the -- the plaintiff here and the shipowner."

1958.22,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3784.933,3788.723,And you say that because the vessel was moored?
1958.22,1,25370,george_a_garvey,,3788.723,3790.034,Not necessarily because it was moored.
1958.22,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3790.034,3790.332,But suppose --

1958.22,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4159.06,4170.533,"But wouldn't negligence be enough if -- if acting on behalf of the shipowner, a fellow had carelessly in -- in putting down carelessly?"
