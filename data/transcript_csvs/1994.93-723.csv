1994.93-723,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.022,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Number 93-723, the United States v. X-Citement Video, Inc.--"
1994.93-723,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,10.889,14.76,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1994.93-723,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,99.597,108.702,"General Days, the Government I would think could also have argued that the Ninth Circuit was wrong because no such scienter requirement was required by the Constitution."
1994.93-723,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,108.702,118.827,"Your Honor, we're not here to argue whether there was in fact an unconstitutionality presented in this case, but merely that there was a constitutional problem."
1994.93-723,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,129.449,130.717,Why not?
1994.93-723,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,130.717,143.542,"Well, because Federal courts are required, according to principles of interpretation, to try to avoid constitutional problems unless it would be clearly contrary to the intent of Congress."
1994.93-723,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,143.542,151.131,But what if a majority of the Court were to conclude that fairly reading the statute there was no such scienter requirement?
1994.93-723,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,151.131,154.666,"Well, if this Court was to so decide, that would conclude the matter."
1994.93-723,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,154.666,155.433,Why?
1994.93-723,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,162.254,162.789,That's what I'm suggesting.
1994.93-723,1,41299,stanley_fleishman,,1668.709,1692.075,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1994.93-723,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1722.761,1724.813,Is the word knowingly in the Mann Act?
1994.93-723,1,41299,stanley_fleishman,,1726.296,1733.486,"I believe not, Justice Ginsburg, but the--"
1994.93-723,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1733.486,1738.89,"So in using that model, they should have just said transport in interstate commerce."
1994.93-723,1,41299,stanley_fleishman,,1738.89,1763.188,"--Whatever that may be, Your Honor, I'm saying that if you look at the text of the statute and its legislative history, that is the model, I believe, that Congress used, and that therefore Congress deliberately and unambiguously omitted knowledge of minority because that's the way these statutes traditionally have been dealt with."
1994.93-723,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1763.188,1768.992,Did they omit knowledge of pornographic character?
1994.93-723,1,41299,stanley_fleishman,,1768.992,1774.127,"That's an arguable point, Your Honor, because the--"
1994.93-723,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1774.127,1775.229,Why is it... I don't see why it's any more arguable--
1994.93-723,1,41299,stanley_fleishman,,1775.229,1775.629,--Well--
1994.93-723,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1775.629,1776.146,--than the other.
1994.93-723,1,41299,stanley_fleishman,,1781.65,1782.083,--My--
1994.93-723,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1782.083,1784.852,--but does not require knowledge of minority.
1994.93-723,1,41299,stanley_fleishman,,1787.471,1819.756,"--My position, Your Honor, is that the text, the statute read literally does not require knowledge with regard to either minority or the... and I prefer not to use the word pornographic, if Your Honors don't mind, because the term is sexually explicit conduct, and the term sexually explicit conduct is extraordinarily broad, and it includes... all nudity, frontal nudity has been interpreted as being sexually explicit conduct, so we're not talking about pornographic material alone."
1994.93-723,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1824.227,1825.66,Adult material?
1994.93-723,1,41299,stanley_fleishman,,1825.66,1828.881,"Adult material, Your Honor, as we talk about it in this context."
1994.93-723,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1828.881,1830.548,And this is different from pornographic--
1994.93-723,1,41299,stanley_fleishman,,1830.548,1833.266,"Yes, Your Honor, in many respects."
1994.93-723,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1833.916,1834.702,--Call it what you--
1994.93-723,1,41299,stanley_fleishman,,1895.09,1916.57,"--Well, if... to answer you, Justice Scalia's question a little further, because one answer that I've given is that the text itself does not require knowingly with regard to either minority or the nature and character of material, but if we go beyond the text of the statute, and we go to the legislative history, we have the answer to your question, Justice--"
1994.93-723,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1916.57,1940.971,"Well, but without getting to legislative history, if I understand your position to be that the statute, properly read, is read as having only shipment of visual material as the object of knowingly, as the portion of the sentence modified by knowingly, by the adverb--"
1994.93-723,1,41299,stanley_fleishman,,1940.971,1941.921,"--Yes, sir."
1994.93-723,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1941.921,1955.914,"--then my question arises, and that is, what could the object of Congress have been in wanting to make sure that the defendant knew that he was engaging in a form of conduct which is by and large innocent?"
1994.93-723,1,41299,stanley_fleishman,,1958.181,1958.766,Correct.
1994.93-723,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1958.766,1960.433,--shipment of pornography.
1994.93-723,1,41299,stanley_fleishman,,1960.433,1963.151,I agree with what has been said by Justice Scalia.
1994.93-723,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1971.24,1974.208,"Well, it's a grammatical answer, but it doesn't answer the problem of meaning."
1994.93-723,1,41299,stanley_fleishman,,1974.725,1975.242,"Well, I--"
1994.93-723,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1975.242,1988.535,"--you've got to give some meaning to this thing, and wouldn't anyone read that and say, well, surely they weren't wasting their time putting knowingly in there just to make sure that the shipper knew that he was shipping and knew that he was shipping visual material?"
1994.93-723,1,41299,stanley_fleishman,,1988.535,1995.956,"--And that's why I say, Your Honor, if we go to the next step, we go to what the legislative intent is, and that legislative intent is clear."
1994.93-723,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1995.956,2004.878,"Well, do you agree with me that if you don't go to legislative intent, we have, on your reading, what may be a grammatical reading, but a very foolish statute?"
1994.93-723,1,41299,stanley_fleishman,,2004.878,2007.764,"Oh, I agree 100 percent it's a poor statute, Your Honor."
1994.93-723,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2010.616,2020.154,"Well, apart from unconstitutionality, we have a statute in which we just couldn't imagine why Congress was even bothering to put in the adverb, isn't that fair to say?"
1994.93-723,1,41299,stanley_fleishman,,2020.154,2039.735,"That is... the textual reading does lead to that result, Your Honor, and when you get to an absurd result, as that would do, then you go to, as I understand the rules, to the legislative history, and you go to the legislative history, it says that what we mean by the word knowingly is, the nature and character of the material."
1994.93-723,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2051.693,2062.0,"It does present you with another serious grammatical problem, doesn't it, because grammatically, how do you separate in the text of this the nature and the character of the material from the minority status of the act?"
1994.93-723,1,41299,stanley_fleishman,,2062.0,2063.366,"--One could do that, Your Honor."
1994.93-723,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2079.542,2083.428,"Knowing... you could have an illustrated Bible, visual depiction."
1994.93-723,1,41299,stanley_fleishman,,2083.428,2088.496,"--I... Your Honor, the question that I'm trying to answer is--"
1994.93-723,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2088.496,2093.467,"If you pick up a bunch of photographs at the drug store in an envelope, you don't necessarily know what's on the photographs."
1994.93-723,1,41299,stanley_fleishman,,2142.049,2145.001,"--My position is very clear, Your Honor."
1994.93-723,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2171.218,2172.418,Why would you do that in a criminal statute?
1994.93-723,1,41299,stanley_fleishman,,2180.091,2182.793,"--Your Honor, I have no wish to save the statute."
1994.93-723,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2195.934,2208.426,"--But we've also not simply gone to legislative history, perhaps we've gone to that less than said there's an implied mens rea requirement, you know, recklessly, knowingly, even where it's not written in the statute."
1994.93-723,1,41299,stanley_fleishman,,2209.81,2219.199,Sure you did it last... but the rule that came out of the Staples case is that's only done when Congress has not manifested a contrary intent.
1994.93-723,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2227.822,2231.959,"Well, we also did it in the Nevada cash-reporting case."
1994.93-723,1,41299,stanley_fleishman,,2238.046,2242.082,"Well, that was read to include a specific intent requirement, Your Honor."
1994.93-723,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2274.619,2280.957,What is your basis for the statement that Congress did not want to require knowledge of minority?
1994.93-723,1,41299,stanley_fleishman,,2280.957,2303.722,"--We... with regard to the text, Your Honor, when the S. 101, the Roth amendment was before the Congress, it was completely restructured in terms of the indentations and the place where the if was put to make it very clear that they were accepting the recommendation of the Department of Justice."
1994.93-723,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2349.434,2354.921,"This was testimony of Judge Wald when she was in the Justice Department, before the committee."
1994.93-723,1,41299,stanley_fleishman,,2354.921,2355.773,--Exactly.
1994.93-723,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2355.773,2358.809,"I mean, that doesn't necessarily represent the final view of the committee."
1994.93-723,1,41299,stanley_fleishman,,2358.809,2382.69,"No, it does not, but what does help us along that line was that that... it was not just testimony, it was written testimony which was appended to the Senate bill and the equal statement made by Attorney Keeney was attached to the House bill, both making the same statement with regard to why the word knowingly remained in 2252 but was not in 2251."
1994.93-723,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2405.956,2420.28,"Mr. Fleishman, could you tell me why, assuming we accept your interpretation of it that it does require knowledge of a visual depiction, or one of your interpretations, but does not require knowledge of minority, why that would be unconstitutional?"
1994.93-723,1,41299,stanley_fleishman,,2443.396,2444.348,Because--
1994.93-723,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2444.348,2445.431,Why is that unconstitutional?
1994.93-723,1,41299,stanley_fleishman,,2445.431,2461.107,"--Well, as the general stated, that the single fact that transfers constitutionally protected material from criminal activity is the age of the person depicted and, therefore, what you would have is a very substantial infringement upon constitutionally protected--"
1994.93-723,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2461.107,2461.657,You mean--
1994.93-723,1,41299,stanley_fleishman,,2462.792,2463.476,--I'm sorry.
1994.93-723,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2463.476,2467.946,"I say, the same is true of the Mann Act, and with all the statutory rape cases."
1994.93-723,1,41299,stanley_fleishman,,2467.946,2476.45,"Of course, that's true, Your Honor, but that does not involve any First Amendment problems, because here what we're talking about are books, all forms of media, and most of the--"
1994.93-723,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2476.45,2482.004,"We've said the right to procreate is covered by the Constitution, haven't we?"
1994.93-723,1,41299,stanley_fleishman,,2482.004,2487.508,"--I'm not sure the analogy is one that is as powerful as it might be, Your Honor--"
1994.93-723,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2518.713,2519.179,Not all of it.
1994.93-723,1,41299,stanley_fleishman,,2531.354,2549.315,"--Your Honor, sexually explicit material involves everything, if you don't... if I may say so because, first of all, the definition of sexually explicit material includes the actual or simulated lascivious exhibition of the genitals or pubic area of any person."
1994.93-723,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2551.617,2560.123,"I understand, and I'm willing to rely upon prosecutorial discretion not to go after the fellow who publishes a medical book or something like that."
1994.93-723,1,41299,stanley_fleishman,,2560.64,2562.242,"I'm not talking about that, your Honor."
1994.93-723,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2579.267,2581.719,"--Lascivious exhibition, right, so--"
1994.93-723,1,41299,stanley_fleishman,,2581.719,2582.803,--Of any person.
1994.93-723,2,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,3424.247,3426.98,"Mr. Chief Justice, I will waive my rebuttal time."
1994.93-723,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3427.697,3428.18,Very well.
