1984.84-325,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,11.239,We will hear arguments next in Metropolitan Life Insurance Company against Massachusetts and the companion case.
1984.84-325,0,30653,jay_greenfield,,14.87,17.973,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1984.84-325,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,225.621,231.354,"The Supreme Judicial Court held invalid the part that attempted to directly regulate the plan, didn't it?"
1984.84-325,0,30653,jay_greenfield,,231.354,237.459,"--The Commonwealth conceded its invalidity before that time and the Supreme Judicial Court noted that, Justice Rehnquist."
1984.84-325,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,237.459,241.262,"Well, didn't it also hold it was invalid?"
1984.84-325,0,30653,jay_greenfield,,241.262,242.732,"Not in the words ""we hold it is invalid""."
1984.84-325,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,244.491,245.573,Assumed by everybody.
1984.84-325,0,30653,jay_greenfield,,245.573,250.516,--That is not a serious question and I don't think the Commonwealth would contend otherwise now.
1984.84-325,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,425.169,439.331,"But that is true of any resident of Massachusetts operating under this statute, isn't it, that they may have to give up some benefits that they want in order to get the unwanted perhaps mental health benefit."
1984.84-325,0,30653,jay_greenfield,,439.331,443.422,"That is not only true, that is one of the reasons why the opinion below is incorrect, Justice Rehnquist."
1984.84-325,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,443.422,445.884,I don't see why it follows that it is incorrect.
1984.84-325,0,30653,jay_greenfield,,445.884,451.647,Because Congress made it quite clear that it wanted the benefit package to be a matter of private choice.
1984.84-325,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,465.388,472.221,But it also exempted from the preemption state laws pertaining to insurance.
1984.84-325,0,30653,jay_greenfield,,472.221,478.034,"I submit that that does not answer the question, that raises the question."
1984.84-325,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,543.0,549.454,"I suppose in the legislative history, in the comments of Senators Javits--"
1984.84-325,0,30653,jay_greenfield,,549.454,551.437,Williams and Dent.
1984.84-325,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,551.437,558.68,"--and Dent there was no direct reference to benefits under the policies of insurance, was there?"
1984.84-325,0,30653,jay_greenfield,,558.68,559.902,There was not.
1984.84-325,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,573.08,593.863,"Mr. Greenfield, does the McCarran-Ferguson Acts provision have any aspects that merit our attention as well wherein it says that no subsequent act of Congress is going to be construed to invalidate a state law regulating the business of insurance?"
1984.84-325,0,30653,jay_greenfield,,593.863,608.603,"Well, I think it has been held, and I don't think seriously disputed by the Commonwealth... It was held in the Hewlett-Packard case in the Ninth Circuit... that ERISA is a statute which relates to the business of insurance, so that aspect of the McCarran Act doesn't apply to."
1984.84-325,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,609.555,621.442,"Well, it occurs to me that the language is so similar to the exemption that is enacted here in the ERISA Act that it might have something."
1984.84-325,0,30653,jay_greenfield,,621.442,624.624,"--Well, let me go to McCarran for a second, Justice O'Connor."
1984.84-325,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,668.632,676.287,"Well, but the terminology in McCarran-Ferguson, I guess, is the regulation of the business of insurance, isn't it?"
1984.84-325,0,30653,jay_greenfield,,676.287,679.83,"The purpose of regulating the business of insurance, yes."
1984.84-325,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,679.83,684.494,"And that has been interpreted to cover insurance policy benefits, hasn't it?"
1984.84-325,0,30653,jay_greenfield,,684.494,691.199,"I don't think... Well, this Court has considered that clause on many occasions, of course."
1984.84-325,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,763.996,774.692,"How about a law that says insurance companies have to insure people who are otherwise uninsurable, kind of a risk pool, would you say that is a regulation of insurance?"
1984.84-325,0,30653,jay_greenfield,,774.692,776.662,I would say that is a different question.
1984.84-325,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,776.662,780.535,Would you say it is a regulation of insurance under the McCarran-Ferguson Act?
1984.84-325,0,30653,jay_greenfield,,780.535,785.708,I would say under the McCarran-Ferguson Act it might be but I really haven't considered that question until this second.
1984.84-325,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,852.203,861.759,But these kinds of statutes are requiring an insurance policy to cover certain risks if they covered others are not brand new as I understand it.
1984.84-325,0,30653,jay_greenfield,,861.759,873.257,"Well, the statute that says that the insured must purchase a policy with that risk, that didn't exist when the savings clause first came in in 1970."
1984.84-325,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,880.641,888.608,I can see that each law has a different effect but why is one less the regulation of insurance than the other?
1984.84-325,0,30653,jay_greenfield,,888.608,899.214,Because regulation of insurance traditionally has meant protecting the insured and insuring the... and guaranteeing the insurance company's solvency.
1984.84-325,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,899.955,908.17,I would think regulating the business of insurance would mean doing whatever the legislature thought wise to govern how that business is carried out.
1984.84-325,0,30653,jay_greenfield,,908.17,925.501,"--But, this is regulating... If you take the literal definition the way the state is taking it and you say that whenever there is the word ""insurance"" it is saved and it is not preempted there is nothing left to the preemption statute, the preemption clause."
1984.84-325,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,930.215,932.787,"Well, there is certainly a lot left of a preemption clause."
1984.84-325,0,30653,jay_greenfield,,940.5,941.742,--That is right.
1984.84-325,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,984.038,988.372,Part of that stands for the way Congress phrased the exemption from the preemption clause.
1984.84-325,0,30653,jay_greenfield,,995.506,1004.863,"Well, when Congress first put... I think there is quite a good reason for that because they didn't want... the preemption clause is quite broad and it became broader during the summer of 1974."
1984.84-325,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1031.62,1040.085,"Those regulations certainly as well create pockets of differing rules in different states, do they not?"
1984.84-325,0,30653,jay_greenfield,,1040.085,1041.437,--What type of regulation?
1984.84-325,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1041.437,1047.371,"The type of regulation you are talking about, your so-called traditional regulations."
1984.84-325,0,30653,jay_greenfield,,1047.371,1049.925,"Yes, but they are not regulation of plans."
1984.84-325,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1088.881,1090.36,One factual question about the statute.
1984.84-325,0,30653,jay_greenfield,,1092.321,1098.155,--It applies to any Massachusetts resident no matter where the statute is issued.
1984.84-325,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1098.155,1108.622,"You could write a policy on a multi-state plan that did not have the mental coverage in it for the people who are not in Massachusetts, is that right?"
1984.84-325,0,30653,jay_greenfield,,1108.622,1114.746,That plan couldn't violate Massachusetts statute unless there were employees--
1984.84-325,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1114.746,1117.177,Even though the issuing insurance company... I don't know where your headquarters are.
1984.84-325,0,30653,jay_greenfield,,1119.509,1126.805,--The statute is designed to apply no matter where the policy is issued so long as it is a Massachusetts resident.
1984.84-325,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1138.293,1139.712,"They are not sitting next to each other, but I understand the example."
1984.84-325,0,30653,jay_greenfield,,1145.446,1147.766,We are--
1984.84-325,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1147.766,1150.42,Or aren't any policies issued in Massachusetts?
1984.84-325,0,30653,jay_greenfield,,1150.42,1153.75,--I don't want to say none are because I am not sure.
1984.84-325,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1165.819,1179.78,Mr. McGovern?
1984.84-325,1,16588,addison_lane_mcgovern,,1179.78,1183.23,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1984.84-325,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1727.976,1736.952,Ms. Kelly?
1984.84-325,2,41587,sally_a_kelly,,1736.952,1751.031,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1984.84-325,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2045.733,2057.942,"Can you contribute anything to our understanding, Ms. Kelly, about why this insurance modification of the general preemption section was enacted by Congress?"
1984.84-325,2,41587,sally_a_kelly,,2057.942,2074.213,"Your Honor, on that point I would say that the legislative history, while scant on the subject of the insurance savings clause, recognizes that Congress intended that there be certain exceptions to the broad preemption scheme."
1984.84-325,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2114.578,2115.71,"Ms. Kelly, may I ask one question?"
1984.84-325,2,41587,sally_a_kelly,,2122.014,2127.378,--The record reveals that the vast majority are in insured plans.
1984.84-325,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2127.378,2128.647,Most of them are insured?
1984.84-325,2,41587,sally_a_kelly,,2128.647,2132.29,"That were before the Massachusetts court at a trial, Justice Stevens."
1984.84-325,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2198.263,2216.717,"Ms. Kelly, in your view could a state like Massachusetts specify the pregnancy benefits that insurance policies must provide through its regulation of insurance savings clause?"
1984.84-325,2,41587,sally_a_kelly,,2216.717,2235.26,"In our view, the state... in the absence of other laws regulating pregnancy benefits, the state might seek to enact a law that provided a certain minimum amount of coverage for pregnancy."
1984.84-325,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2235.26,2239.581,How would you then reconcile that with the Shaw case?
1984.84-325,2,41587,sally_a_kelly,,2239.581,2253.05,The Commonwealth believes that in Shaw the Court was dealing with an exception from the ERISA preemption scheme for disability benefit plans.
1984.84-325,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2286.641,2295.798,"But, the state could operate indirectly insofar as insurance policies are issued by requiring the same thing in a way."
1984.84-325,2,41587,sally_a_kelly,,2295.798,2310.797,"--In a sense the state could, although to my knowledge, the pregnancy benefits are usually provided in disability insurance laws which, as I say, are exempt from ERISA coverage in their entirety."
1984.84-325,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2771.197,2785.917,"May I ask right there, do you agree or disagree with the thrust of the argument that at the very least it does control one of the substantive terms of the collective bargaining agreement that would ordinarily be a subject of mandatory bargaining?"
1984.84-325,2,41587,sally_a_kelly,,2785.917,2790.061,"I do not agree with that as stated, Justice Stevens."
1984.84-325,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2798.295,2811.696,"Well, if you had a collective bargaining agreement that said in so many words we will have health insurance, dental insurance, about six different things, but we will not provide any coverage for mental illness and then you impose the statute on it."
1984.84-325,2,41587,sally_a_kelly,,2814.287,2817.48,"Well, Justice Stevens, there would be two answers to that."
1984.84-325,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2821.992,2822.442,I forgot.
1984.84-325,2,41587,sally_a_kelly,,2825.515,2826.045,Okay.
1984.84-325,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3009.944,3012.297,"Do you have anything further, Mr. Greenfield?"
1984.84-325,3,30653,jay_greenfield,,3012.297,3014.547,"Yes, Your Honor."
1984.84-325,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3014.547,3015.669,You have two minutes remaining.
1984.84-325,3,30653,jay_greenfield,,3015.669,3016.528,Fine.
1984.84-325,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3120.259,3121.669,"Thank you, counsel."
