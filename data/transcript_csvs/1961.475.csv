1961.475,0,20257,charles_s_vigil,,455.044,455.193,That is correct.

1961.475,0,20257,charles_s_vigil,,463.788,465.39,And I think that's the --

1961.475,0,20257,charles_s_vigil,,465.498,466.107,-- explanation to that.

1961.475,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,907.983,910.728,"Well, how does it material to --"
1961.475,0,20257,charles_s_vigil,,910.728,922.426,It was material merely to show that no statement was taken which is what I'm attempting to show here and no statement was taken at the beginning of the time that was involved here.

1961.475,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3530.52,3532.282,"It has to be released, doesn't it?"
1961.475,1,29220,j_f_brauer_jr,,3532.282,3535.029,He would have to get out of the State Industrial School.
1961.475,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3535.032,3536.462,He hadn't been convicted of any offense.

1961.475,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6460.897,6464.621,"Well now, how -- how could they converse if they're -- each one of them was in solitary?"
1961.475,2,20257,charles_s_vigil,,6464.621,6469.305,"Well as -- as it's been stated here, they had released Richard."
1961.475,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6512.63,6514.91,But -- but Robert was not in the room apparently.
1961.475,2,20257,charles_s_vigil,,6518.127,6521.558,"No, Robert was apparently not in the room at least as far as the testimony (Voice Overlap) --"
1961.475,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6521.558,6528.979,Now I gather you didn't ask for the testimony to be stricken after Eddie and Richard were out of the case because of your --
1961.475,2,20257,charles_s_vigil,,6528.979,6529.248,No.
1961.475,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6529.248,6535.648,"-- theory that the police got this information overhearing that conversation and then just put it in writing, is that it?"
1961.475,2,20257,charles_s_vigil,,6537.731,6538.651,At that point?
1961.475,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6538.651,6539.62,Yes.
1961.475,2,20257,charles_s_vigil,,6539.62,6549.108,"No, the -- the case of course, all this information was secured prior to the trial, this -- the sequence of these events is Mr. --"
1961.475,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6549.108,6549.285,No.
1961.475,2,20257,charles_s_vigil,,6563.727,6564.959,I think that is correct.
1961.475,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6564.959,6566.875,"Now, you didn't ask that it'd be stricken."
1961.475,2,20257,charles_s_vigil,,6566.875,6567.857,"No, I did not."
1961.475,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6567.857,6569.621,Nor object to its introduction.
1961.475,2,20257,charles_s_vigil,,6569.621,6604.352,"Well, I think previously we had objected and the page 196, we have an objection that the Court overruled and the objection goes to the question of permitting the officer to testify at all as to any oral statements or alleged oral statements because the Court had had this hearing outside the presence of the jury to determine what statements are going to be admitted and ultimately, the Court determines that the written statement, Exhibit D could be admitted."
1961.475,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6605.872,6616.395,"No, but -- what I'm trying to get to is, you never asked that the evidence, the overheard conversation, what was said between Richard and Eddie, to be stricken as against your client."
1961.475,2,20257,charles_s_vigil,,6616.395,6617.337,No.
1961.475,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6617.337,6619.928,Against whom was the information filed (Inaudible)
1961.475,2,20257,charles_s_vigil,,6619.928,6628.687,The information was filed originally against only Eddie Martinez who was age 12 and Bobby Gallegos who was age 14.
1961.475,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6628.687,6628.747,Bobby --
1961.475,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6628.747,6628.868,Did you say --
1961.475,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6628.868,6630.705,-- is the defendant here?
1961.475,2,20257,charles_s_vigil,,6630.705,6631.131,Yes.
1961.475,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6631.152,6631.45,Bobby?
1961.475,2,20257,charles_s_vigil,,6631.45,6633.607,-- Gallegos is the defendant here.
1961.475,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6646.756,6651.939,There's no -- so counsel was in there when he said they were all originally charged.
1961.475,2,20257,charles_s_vigil,,6651.939,6652.999,"I think, yes."
1961.475,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6659.169,6660.846,Yes.
1961.475,2,20257,charles_s_vigil,,6660.846,6674.219,"-- the youngster, Richard Martinez or Richard Gallegos, I should say, was not charged in the information nor was he charged in the juvenile court."
1961.475,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6694.283,6694.905,"Well, now that was (Voice Overlap)."
1961.475,2,20257,charles_s_vigil,,6694.905,6695.693,(Voice Overlap).
1961.475,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6695.693,6698.839,I suppose it was your option or his option that he did not testify before a jury.
1961.475,2,20257,charles_s_vigil,,6698.839,6699.684,Oh yes.
1961.475,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6704.907,6705.167,Yes.
1961.475,2,20257,charles_s_vigil,,6705.167,6708.2,"-- yes, before the jury, but he did not testify."
1961.475,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6711.66,6712.107,Yes.
1961.475,2,20257,charles_s_vigil,,6712.107,6716.105,-- argument that had been made.
1961.475,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7036.488,7040.081,May I ask you a question about your practice?
1961.475,2,20257,charles_s_vigil,,7049.662,7050.927,That is correct.
1961.475,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7050.927,7055.026,"And in that theory, the defendant testified."
1961.475,2,20257,charles_s_vigil,,7055.026,7056.348,That is correct.
1961.475,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7056.348,7058.057,And the officers testified.
1961.475,2,20257,charles_s_vigil,,7058.057,7059.362,That is correct.
1961.475,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7059.362,7067.306,Was it is his duty to pass merely preliminarily upon the admissibility of this confession with --
1961.475,2,20257,charles_s_vigil,,7067.306,7067.55,No --
1961.475,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7067.55,7069.125,-- the law of the state?
1961.475,2,20257,charles_s_vigil,,7069.125,7069.646,No.
1961.475,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7074.889,7076.627,Whether it's voluntary or not voluntary.
1961.475,2,20257,charles_s_vigil,,7076.627,7077.708,That is correct.
1961.475,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7077.708,7081.807,He did that on the basis of the evidence of the officers and your defendant?
1961.475,2,20257,charles_s_vigil,,7081.807,7082.076,That is correct.
1961.475,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7082.076,7085.142,"Was there anyone else, offered this evidence?"
1961.475,2,20257,charles_s_vigil,,7085.142,7088.456,There was no one else offered this evidence.
1961.475,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7088.456,7089.196,No other witness.
1961.475,2,20257,charles_s_vigil,,7089.196,7092.571,No other witnesses.
1961.475,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,7093.646,7100.945,Very well.
