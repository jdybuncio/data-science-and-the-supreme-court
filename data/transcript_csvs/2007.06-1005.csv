2007.06-1005,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,6.154,"We'll hear argument next in case 06-1005, United States versus Santos."
2007.06-1005,0,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,7.237,17.259,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Seventh Circuit has seriously misconstrued the Federal money laundering statute by interpreting the term ""proceeds"" to mean profits."
2007.06-1005,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,83.987,86.037,Where... so what?
2007.06-1005,0,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,86.037,87.939,"Well, Congress was trying--"
2007.06-1005,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,87.939,92.224,Is there some rule up there that says every criminal statute has to cover as much as possible?
2007.06-1005,0,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,92.224,93.176,"--No, Your Honor."
2007.06-1005,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,109.519,125.314,"I think it... I think it much more remarkable than that, more extraordinary than that, that Congress would want to make all... all betting operations like this a violation automatically of two criminal statutes."
2007.06-1005,0,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,125.314,126.564,"Well, Your Honor--"
2007.06-1005,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,126.564,129.616,"I find that sort of, you know, very strange."
2007.06-1005,0,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,129.616,136.103,"--it is certainly true that illegal gambling and money laundering are going to occur together, but that isn't a cause for concern."
2007.06-1005,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,148.811,155.583,"It is hard to see this... that, just in the sense of laundering, nothing is being concealed."
2007.06-1005,0,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,196.993,208.884,"Well, it's not the same conduct in that the conduct here, the paying the winners and paying the collectors is not a required element of the gambling offense."
2007.06-1005,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,208.884,210.784,"Oh well, I mean... come on."
2007.06-1005,0,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,217.24,218.69,"And, true--"
2007.06-1005,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,218.69,225.68,To make the paying off of the winners a separate crime from running the gambling operation seems to me quite extraordinary.
2007.06-1005,0,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,225.68,231.916,"--It... it... it's true, Your Honor, that they're not going to last very long."
2007.06-1005,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,237.987,239.737,But even if--
2007.06-1005,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,239.737,254.247,"Can you tell me what happens if there's a... two bank robbers, the one's with the get-away car; the other one going into the bank teller, and the robber that goes into the bank gets $1,000 and comes out and gives 500 to the get-away guy."
2007.06-1005,0,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,257.949,276.612,"That is, if the... if the payment would promote the continuing... if they've got a continuing robbery operation and by paying him he's going to say, he's saying, you know, keep on continuing in the operation and let's expand it further."
2007.06-1005,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,276.612,284.766,"Then under your theory the employee who gets paid shows up for work the next morning; and so, of course, under your theory it would be promotion."
2007.06-1005,0,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,284.766,297.526,"Your Honor, your question and a lot of the questions I'm getting, I think express concern about treating these transactions as promotion under the statute."
2007.06-1005,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,298.292,300.91,I would have the same concern if we were dealing with concealment.
2007.06-1005,0,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,300.91,302.027,--What I don't--
2007.06-1005,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,302.027,307.314,"If the robbery takes place in a dark alley, is that automatically concealment?"
2007.06-1005,0,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,307.314,317.689,"--No, because what needs to be concealed, what there needs to be is a financial transaction that's designed, the transaction itself, to conceal the nature and source of the proceeds."
2007.06-1005,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,317.689,320.239,That's going into the alley instead of doing it out on the--
2007.06-1005,0,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,320.239,332.463,I don't think that doing a robbery in the alley would be a financial transaction... would be designing a financial transaction to conceal the unlawful nature and source of the proceeds.
2007.06-1005,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,334.113,347.972,"Mr. Roberts, isn't it true that the problems that are being highlighted are problems that result from expansive interpretations of other concepts that are not before us here, expansive interpretation of promotion, expansive interpretation of concealment?"
2007.06-1005,0,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,366.518,368.553,"--I agree with that, Your Honor."
2007.06-1005,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,390.499,401.107,"What about the qualification that Judge Easterbrook made when he said, at least where the crime is a business-like operation?"
2007.06-1005,0,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,420.688,434.512,"--Well, I think it's difficult to interpret the proceeds, the term ""proceeds"", to mean something different for business operations than for other crimes because it's the same word."
2007.06-1005,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,436.928,438.297,Why don't you continue.
2007.06-1005,0,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,439.48,440.38,--Okay.
2007.06-1005,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,472.618,481.057,"I thought your answer to the line of questioning that we were having was that the problem would still be there, even if you limited this statute to profits."
2007.06-1005,0,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,502.637,503.271,That's right.
2007.06-1005,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,514.193,515.894,--It will solve a lot them.
2007.06-1005,0,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,531.323,541.512,"--It's not going to... it's not... first of all, this case doesn't present the interpretation of promotion and the Court would be free to address that in--"
2007.06-1005,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,541.512,543.714,Maybe the question presented doesn't present it--
2007.06-1005,0,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,543.714,544.231,--Yes.
2007.06-1005,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,544.231,545.814,--But I think the facts of the case do present it.
2007.06-1005,0,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,553.652,555.104,"You certainly could, Your Honor."
2007.06-1005,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,568.162,575.852,"I understand all that, but we can still do it if it's perfectly obvious that that's the right way to dispose of the case."
2007.06-1005,0,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,575.852,579.554,"--You can obviously address any issue that you want to, Your Honor."
2007.06-1005,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,590.695,591.995,Wouldn't it be--
2007.06-1005,0,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,591.995,614.993,"We do submit that it was resolved correctly in this case, because, as the Seventh Circuit held and as all the other courts of appeals have held about promotion, the payments to the winners and the payments to the collectors encourage the continued participation of the collectors and encourage the increased participation by gamblers."
2007.06-1005,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,614.993,629.32,"--Mr. Roberts, the Seventh Circuit in this case was following a precedent in another case and it thought that the defendant would prevail under its theory."
2007.06-1005,0,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,659.255,674.181,"You could do that, but the question that I think that is concerning the Court was resolved by the Seventh Circuit in this very case on direct appeal."
2007.06-1005,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,693.743,698.38,You might well reject it if you're going to have a narrow definition of proceeds.
2007.06-1005,0,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,720.21,733.018,"Well, we certainly would prefer that you did that than that you interpreted proceeds to mean profits because of the violence that it would do to the remainder of the statute, Your Honor."
2007.06-1005,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,761.053,779.082,"I've got that point, but what is your suggestion as to how to deal with what is underlying disturbing me and it seems like a lot of others, if prima facie Congress did not intend that you launder money where the activity is an essential part of the underlying crime itself?"
2007.06-1005,0,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,815.288,825.146,"Well, I think you decide the question presented here and you decide that proceeds means that... that proceeds means gross receipts, because that's the only meaning that makes sense with the statute."
2007.06-1005,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,856.749,861.153,But still your answer leaves me... and I have no answer to this; I want yours.
2007.06-1005,0,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,884.768,891.255,"--Well, I think that you can't have all of them together, Your Honor, unfortunately."
2007.06-1005,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,900.611,902.011,I find that extraordinary.
2007.06-1005,0,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,923.393,929.88,"It's not... Your Honor, it's just not exactly the same activity, because people can commit gambling without commit money laundering."
2007.06-1005,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,933.248,936.534,"Straighten that out in the definition of the crime, rather than in the--"
2007.06-1005,0,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,936.534,938.517,"--But they can be... even under this definition, Your Honor."
2007.06-1005,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,965.819,974.992,"--Mr. Roberts... that the gambling offense is conducting a gambling business, so it makes it... it is not just the gambling itself--"
2007.06-1005,0,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,974.992,984.265,"--It is... but the statute defines what the three... the statue defines what the three elements of the gambling business are, Your Honor."
2007.06-1005,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,995.721,996.489,--What continues?
2007.06-1005,0,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1009.13,1012.415,"The gambling business... it might be gambling and fraud, Your Honor."
2007.06-1005,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1029.977,1040.15,"And... if your definition of proceeds is problematic, it is something like an abstract question you're asking us to answer."
2007.06-1005,0,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1054.825,1056.444,Yes.
2007.06-1005,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1080.06,1084.677,"Mr. Robert, may I go back to something you said about... of the options that Justice Breyer mentioned."
2007.06-1005,0,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1111.262,1113.031,"--I'm sorry, Your Honor."
2007.06-1005,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1163.546,1165.13,I have it in front of me actually.
2007.06-1005,0,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1189.245,1211.658,"--Well, because he does engage in something more than what he needs to do to be punished for the underlying offense, and that conduct is... and that conduct is... promotes ongoing crime or can conceal ongoing crime in ways that are just what Congress was getting at in the statute."
2007.06-1005,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1212.374,1218.514,Because gambling under the definition has the three elements that do not include paying off the winners.
2007.06-1005,0,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1220.297,1226.251,"--Because... well, that's one thing, but the other thing is, Your Honor, if I could talk about the ways that the proceeds definition just doesn't make sense here."
2007.06-1005,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1284.289,1290.86,"--You are saying it would not be covered as money laundering, but nevertheless it would be illegal and be punished as gambling."
2007.06-1005,0,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1290.86,1292.312,"Yes, it would, Your Honor."
2007.06-1005,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1294.745,1295.68,And everything they've done here would be punished as gambling--
2007.06-1005,0,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1295.68,1304.786,"--the concealment conduct is additional conduct, and it is what Congress wanted to get at here, and a profits definition would mean that it is excluded from the statute."
2007.06-1005,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1308.238,1313.725,"Well, you see the problem we have is we're not sure that it is within the statute."
2007.06-1005,0,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1318.093,1327.033,"--Well, I guess if you don't think that concealing expense payments should be covered, if you don't think concealing money that is--"
2007.06-1005,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1327.033,1331.687,--Can you imagine running a illegal gambling business and advertising your expenses?
2007.06-1005,0,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1333.02,1334.503,"--It's not a question of advertising them, Your Honor."
2007.06-1005,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1340.107,1341.626,--But it's not additional conduct.
2007.06-1005,0,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1342.426,1343.745,It is additional conduct.
2007.06-1005,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1347.78,1350.065,--What if he puts it in a tin can and buries it in the garden?
2007.06-1005,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1351.182,1352.35,--Of course it is.
2007.06-1005,0,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1352.35,1357.735,"It's additional conduct, but it's not designed to conceal the unlawful nature--"
2007.06-1005,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1357.735,1358.754,Why isn't it?
2007.06-1005,0,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1362.039,1371.978,"--I might like to keep my money in the cookie jar... and it's perfectly legitimate money, Your Honor... because I don't want when someone comes into my house that... for them to steal the cash."
2007.06-1005,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1371.978,1377.632,"I just don't see how you can make the distinction you're making, and therefore I don't see how you can avoid Justice Stevens's problem."
2007.06-1005,0,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1377.632,1399.395,"If he takes the money, Your Honor, and he structures his payments to his employees by making them... or to his suppliers, by making them in $9,000 increments in order to evade transaction reporting requirements, that wouldn't be covered either under this interpretation of the statute."
2007.06-1005,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1399.395,1409.167,"Mr. Roberts, isn't it true that the Seventh Circuit's interpretation of proceeds doesn't really solve these problems except in the case of an unprofitable business?"
2007.06-1005,0,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1413.703,1421.559,"I think there are many situations, as the Chief Justice pointed out, in which a profits definition isn't going to be enough to solve it."
2007.06-1005,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1544.29,1544.84,"Thank you, counsel."
2007.06-1005,0,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1544.84,1545.506,Thank you.
2007.06-1005,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1545.506,1550.61,Mr. Vare.
2007.06-1005,1,43414,todd_g_vare,,1550.61,1564.184,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Justice Ginsburg, you have suggested correctly that the only conduct in this case was the payment of ordinary and necessary expenses of the business."
2007.06-1005,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1584.831,1592.771,"Didn't Justice Alito correctly suggest that these merger problems would still persist even under your definition of ""proceeds""?"
2007.06-1005,1,43414,todd_g_vare,,1592.771,1596.889,I think that that is not necessarily true.
2007.06-1005,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1616.902,1628.444,"No, but I mean if you have a ""profits"" definition and the enterprise has profits, all of these problems we've been talking about in terms of the merger, as I call it, between the money laundering and the underlying offense would still be there, right?"
2007.06-1005,1,43414,todd_g_vare,,1628.444,1629.996,"Yes, Your Honor."
2007.06-1005,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1648.523,1665.152,"So why are you urging us to create two problems, to drag along all of the problems that you object to with... with interpreting proceeds to include simply covering your expenses?"
2007.06-1005,1,43414,todd_g_vare,,1717.933,1720.469,"I think you're absolutely correct, Justice Scalia."
2007.06-1005,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1734.027,1739.447,Did you argue at any point that these were not proceeds?
2007.06-1005,1,43414,todd_g_vare,,1739.447,1741.549,"Yes, Your Honor, we did."
2007.06-1005,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1755.357,1756.643,Did you argue that in the court of appeals?
2007.06-1005,1,43414,todd_g_vare,,1756.643,1769.533,That was presented as... that was presented as part of the Febus decision as an argument that those transactions did not constitute distinct and separate transactions from gambling.
2007.06-1005,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1809.193,1823.787,"The question is can you violate the statute by financial transactions which... have you promoted the crime, when those transactions are no more than part of the crime itself?"
2007.06-1005,1,43414,todd_g_vare,,1835.761,1842.764,"I think that that is a question that this Court could resolve on the facts of this case, or--"
2007.06-1005,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1842.764,1844.7,And was it raised in the court below?
2007.06-1005,1,43414,todd_g_vare,,1844.7,1852.187,"--It was... it was raised in the court below as... as inherent... well, it was certainly raised in the Febus, in the direct appeal."
2007.06-1005,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1878.07,1881.624,"Well, I think it is a stretch so far as the question presented."
2007.06-1005,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1888.893,1891.062,That's not your question presented.
2007.06-1005,1,43414,todd_g_vare,,1891.062,1893.431,"--Absolutely not, Justice Ginsburg."
2007.06-1005,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1906.571,1909.857,I didn't see that you presented... a separate question presented in your opposition.
2007.06-1005,1,43414,todd_g_vare,,1909.857,1911.407,"We did, Your Honor."
2007.06-1005,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1911.407,1914.075,Where is that?
2007.06-1005,1,43414,todd_g_vare,,1914.075,1918.296,In the... Mr. Chief Justice--

2007.06-1005,1,43414,todd_g_vare,,1922.664,1925.2,--In Mr. Santos' brief.
2007.06-1005,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1930.068,1932.987,Brief in opposition--
2007.06-1005,1,43414,todd_g_vare,,1932.987,1936.174,--The brief in opposition on the very first page.
2007.06-1005,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1936.174,1939.292,"Oh, but I am looking at the orange one, not the red one."
2007.06-1005,1,43414,todd_g_vare,,1946.279,1953.349,"No, we did not... in the opposition to the cert petition we did not present a different question presented as a question presented."
2007.06-1005,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1971.06,1994.61,"If we adopt your position, we will have to decide a question like, for example, if the argument is I didn't have any profits because I had to pay $10,000 for a hit man to kill somebody, we would have to have a judicial decision that, yes, paying hit men is the ordinary and necessary business expense in carrying out illegal gambling operations, right?"
2007.06-1005,1,43414,todd_g_vare,,1994.61,2005.401,"I think, Mr. Chief Justice, in any case you're going to have to look at what the specified unlawful activity is in the context of a money laundering prosecution, because that is part of the context."
2007.06-1005,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2031.283,2040.472,"Let's take two illegal gambling operations that are identical in every way except that the one pays the runners, you know, $200 a week."
2007.06-1005,1,43414,todd_g_vare,,2057.25,2059.118,"--No, Mr. Chief Justice."
2007.06-1005,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2064.735,2065.438,But the--
2007.06-1005,1,43414,todd_g_vare,,2065.438,2072.025,--when in both situations the gambling operator is simply paying off ordinary business expenses.
2007.06-1005,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2083.714,2095.856,"--No, I'm focusing on the question presented... that was the only question presented when we considered whether to grant certiorari by either of the parties, and that focuses solely on the question of whether ""proceeds"" is considered gross revenues or profits."
2007.06-1005,1,43414,todd_g_vare,,2095.856,2106.746,"Well, Mr. Chief Justice, what I... what I believe is the answer to your question is... is you cannot look at the term ""proceeds"" in isolation."
2007.06-1005,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2129.779,2134.147,"But this doesn't... ""proceeds"" must mean the same thing in every money laundering case, doesn't it?"
2007.06-1005,1,43414,todd_g_vare,,2140.051,2140.836,Well--
2007.06-1005,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2140.836,2145.954,Can it mean something different in... depending on the underlying illegal activity?
2007.06-1005,1,43414,todd_g_vare,,2145.954,2159.548,"--I think there is certainly a suggestion, but that this Court itself has made recently in the Duke Energy case, that a term can have multiple meanings, multiple shades of meanings, and that will depend upon the context."
2007.06-1005,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2186.179,2203.141,"Mr. Vare, you know, I'm... I'm unwilling to decide the definition of transaction question in the present case because, frankly, I think that's a... in itself, a very difficult question which we haven't had adequately argued."
2007.06-1005,1,43414,todd_g_vare,,2221.02,2221.703,--You could have--
2007.06-1005,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2221.703,2227.257,--You can... you can view that as something beyond the mere... the mere gambling crime.
2007.06-1005,1,43414,todd_g_vare,,2238.648,2242.266,"--Well, you can have a gambling business without runners per se."
2007.06-1005,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2242.266,2242.999,Exactly.
2007.06-1005,1,43414,todd_g_vare,,2242.999,2246.068,"But you do need, Justice Scalia, you do need five or more participants."
2007.06-1005,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2312.51,2321.033,"So someone who simply paid off whoever it is that ships in, you know, a ton of heroin, you'd say is not guilty then?"
2007.06-1005,1,43414,todd_g_vare,,2329.472,2349.683,"Well, I... I think in that case, Mr. Chief Justice, I would... I would suggest it might be an incomplete hypothetical, because simply paying the expenses of a crime or simply buying more drugs is not in and of itself... and I think the government has conceded that in their opening... that's not in and of itself money laundering."
2007.06-1005,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2375.751,2382.07,"Let me go back to the question of the definition of ""proceeds""."
2007.06-1005,1,43414,todd_g_vare,,2465.674,2470.978,"Well, Justice Alito, I don't think it's an impossible situation, number one, and I'll get to that in a second."
2007.06-1005,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2523.993,2525.477,I'm sure that's true.
2007.06-1005,1,43414,todd_g_vare,,2534.183,2536.468,"--Absolutely, Justice Alito."
2007.06-1005,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2536.468,2537.337,--proving that it's profitable.
2007.06-1005,1,43414,todd_g_vare,,2537.337,2538.62,And the proof problem--
2007.06-1005,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2538.62,2548.108,"Not just proving that it's profitable; proving that the person laundering it knew that it was profits because that's part of the definition of the crime, that scienter."
2007.06-1005,1,43414,todd_g_vare,,2556.964,2564.237,"--Well, Justice Scalia, the intent or the knowledge or the scienter requirement is going to be present."
2007.06-1005,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2595.256,2598.375,"Well, how do they know even what the fiscal year of these enterprises is?"
2007.06-1005,1,43414,todd_g_vare,,2608.731,2618.67,"--No, I'm not saying that at all, Mr. Chief Justice, and I think my point would be the government would not even need to look at a fiscal year to prove profits."
2007.06-1005,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2625.108,2631.096,"My point is the profits may not come in immediately, even though the underlying activity is exactly the same."
2007.06-1005,1,43414,todd_g_vare,,2631.096,2632.946,--That may be the case.
2007.06-1005,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2640.885,2642.57,I mean what... what's the total stage you look at?
2007.06-1005,1,43414,todd_g_vare,,2652.843,2655.128,"Certainly, based upon the profits in the first month."
2007.06-1005,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2657.045,2659.264,"One day they could pick then, they have one good day."
2007.06-1005,1,43414,todd_g_vare,,2661.032,2664.734,--And they could profit on that one good day if there are other transactions involved in the profits.
2007.06-1005,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2664.734,2667.435,--What about the bank robber... there's just one bank robbery.
2007.06-1005,1,43414,todd_g_vare,,2686.683,2688.733,I don't think that that--
2007.06-1005,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2688.733,2690.718,That would be a very silly result.
2007.06-1005,1,43414,todd_g_vare,,2690.718,2699.907,"--Well, I... I don't think that, under that hypothetical, even the government would charge those criminals with money laundering."
2007.06-1005,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2699.907,2700.724,No.
2007.06-1005,1,43414,todd_g_vare,,2703.026,2704.243,"Well, if there's--"
2007.06-1005,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2704.243,2705.66,"8,000, 8 million."
2007.06-1005,1,43414,todd_g_vare,,2705.66,2710.731,--Simply giving money to somebody else does not meet the concealment and disguisement element.
2007.06-1005,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2718.285,2720.737,Assume that it's proceeds.
2007.06-1005,1,43414,todd_g_vare,,2726.224,2733.645,I suppose I would say no.
2007.06-1005,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2755.243,2757.393,Well that's... but we don't try to solve every case.
2007.06-1005,1,43414,todd_g_vare,,2786.513,2790.547,"I think, Mr. Chief Justice, I'm not asking this Court to avoid any question."
2007.06-1005,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2837.358,2840.127,"Well, let's take this context."
2007.06-1005,1,43414,todd_g_vare,,2883.506,2892.195,"Justice Ginsburg, I think that it is slightly more difficult in the case the government has now, which is really no difficulty at all."
2007.06-1005,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2914.71,2917.412,--Why does it have to be the ordinary expense of that?
2007.06-1005,1,43414,todd_g_vare,,2938.075,2940.709,"No, I don't think so at all, Justice Scalia."
2007.06-1005,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2940.709,2946.079,You think paying the hit man would be part of the murder transaction?
2007.06-1005,1,43414,todd_g_vare,,2946.079,2947.598,Absolutely.
2007.06-1005,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2947.598,2948.181,Uh-huh.
2007.06-1005,1,43414,todd_g_vare,,2948.181,2954.585,But I don't think that that necessarily parlays into whether or not it is money laundering or not.
2007.06-1005,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2954.585,2955.335,"No, I understand."
2007.06-1005,1,43414,todd_g_vare,,2955.335,2988.945,"If, for example, the murderer paid the hit man with money to kill somebody and then paid... you know, used proceeds from the insurance premium that somebody might have been his wife or her husband, and used the proceeds to pay off the money... the hit man for the next crime or to reward him or something else, to carry on the business or used the insurance proceeds to conceal where they came from, then I think you could create a hypothetical situation of money laundering."
2007.06-1005,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2988.945,2995.302,"--I thought it would depend on whether or not the insurance proceeds exceeded how much he had to pay the hit man, right?"
2007.06-1005,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3000.697,3003.447,"He wanted to kill his wife, right?"
2007.06-1005,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3003.447,3004.065,--Yes.
2007.06-1005,1,43414,todd_g_vare,,3013.938,3028.197,"If we assume the expansive interpretations of a transaction promoting the underlying crime that have been presented in this case and then we apply the profits definition, that might not be money laundering."
2007.06-1005,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3101.293,3107.363,I thought their answer was the money laundering statute covers a whole waterfront of activities besides illegal gambling.
2007.06-1005,1,43414,todd_g_vare,,3123.825,3134.783,"Well, I think what the money laundering statute was intended to do was punish different conduct, separate and distinct from the underlying crime."
2007.06-1005,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3181.931,3183.047,"Thank you, Mr. Vare."
2007.06-1005,2,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,3185.548,3190.167,Thank you.
2007.06-1005,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3329.687,3330.498,"Thank you, counsel."
