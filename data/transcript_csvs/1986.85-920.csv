1986.85-920,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.356,We will hear arguments next in Alaska Airlines against Brock.
1986.85-920,0,44300,william_t_coleman_jr,,57.17,62.24,"Good afternoon, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1986.85-920,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,331.33,334.699,"Mr. Coleman, could I interrupt you right there, because it's something I'm not clear about in the statute."
1986.85-920,0,44300,william_t_coleman_jr,,344.305,346.84,"--We don't think it had any effect at all, Your Honor."
1986.85-920,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,360.516,361.233,The first hire provision?
1986.85-920,0,44300,william_t_coleman_jr,,361.233,369.955,"It's not spelled out in the statute, and this raises a question that you get from time to time, where there's a statutory provision which doesn't say you have a private cause of action; do you?"
1986.85-920,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,386.834,387.317,"Well, I understand that."
1986.85-920,0,44300,william_t_coleman_jr,,390.035,390.768,"--Yes, yes."
1986.85-920,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,390.768,394.57,"But your position is that until the regulations were promulgated, the statute was basically a nullity?"
1986.85-920,0,44300,william_t_coleman_jr,,394.57,396.606,"That's our position, Your Honor."
1986.85-920,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,435.147,436.783,"Well, at least to completely effectuate it."
1986.85-920,0,44300,william_t_coleman_jr,,438.649,439.635,"It says, effectuate it."
1986.85-920,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,439.635,445.087,"It might be arguable that even without the regulations, there were some employee rights that were--"
1986.85-920,0,44300,william_t_coleman_jr,,445.087,446.972,But not clearly these regulations.
1986.85-920,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,449.507,450.174,--Right.
1986.85-920,0,44300,william_t_coleman_jr,,450.174,470.571,"And also, since you also have before you the record, I'd like you to look at page 46A, where you see... where the Administrator says, his authority that he's acting under is Section 43(f), and that's the section that has the one-house veto in it."
1986.85-920,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,470.571,498.674,"Mr. Coleman, do you disagree with the argument that the... that what the legislative veto was mainly directed at, what consisted of the main degree of discretion here, was not the issuance of regulations dealing with the right of first hire, but rather, the regulations dealing with the obtaining of Federal assistance, that that's what the Congress was worried that the Secretary was going to do something--"
1986.85-920,0,44300,william_t_coleman_jr,,498.674,501.074,"We disagree 100 percent, Your Honor."
1986.85-920,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,709.121,711.188,--Section 43(f).
1986.85-920,0,44300,william_t_coleman_jr,,711.188,725.798,"43(f), yes, sir, which is on page 42A."
1986.85-920,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,843.391,849.961,"Mr. Coleman, I presume all of this goes to formulating the answer which you think we should come to to the proper question."
1986.85-920,0,44300,william_t_coleman_jr,,849.961,850.411,--Yes.
1986.85-920,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,850.411,852.33,Now what is the question we should ask?
1986.85-920,0,44300,william_t_coleman_jr,,852.33,868.839,"The question you should ask is, whether, when you read this statute, would Congress have enacted the statute in the form it did if it did not have the legislative veto?"
1986.85-920,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,878.445,880.814,What if we are in equipoise?
1986.85-920,0,44300,william_t_coleman_jr,,883.099,887.67,"Judge... Mr. Justice, that-would be very unfamiliar to almost anybody on this Court to be in equipoise."
1986.85-920,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,890.705,892.622,Just imagine.
1986.85-920,0,44300,william_t_coleman_jr,,892.622,893.74,--Pardon?
1986.85-920,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,893.74,898.542,"If we really... you know, we're very honest, and we say, I really can't tell what Congress would have done."
1986.85-920,0,44300,william_t_coleman_jr,,899.561,900.644,"Well, you then should say, the one thing--"
1986.85-920,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,900.644,901.494,Then who wins?
1986.85-920,0,44300,william_t_coleman_jr,,902.211,919.689,"--the one thing that's clear, you should say at that point, how can I let them issue regulations which clearly were subject to be rewritten by the Congress, and let those regulations stand."
1986.85-920,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,919.689,927.145,"So you're saying, unless we can find that they would have adopted it in this form without this provision, we should strike down the whole thing?"
1986.85-920,0,44300,william_t_coleman_jr,,927.145,928.061,You strike down the whole thing.
1986.85-920,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,928.061,933.865,And the burden is on those who want to retain the provision without the legislative veto to show that that is--
1986.85-920,0,44300,william_t_coleman_jr,,933.865,942.221,"Yes, that one ought not to be able to come in and say, I have authority to do something, but the person who gave me authority also put a restriction on it."
1986.85-920,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,952.612,958.682,"--Put another way, perhaps, the question is, would the principal have given the agent that authority knowing that he could not restrict it?"
1986.85-920,0,44300,william_t_coleman_jr,,958.682,960.266,"That's right, yes, sir."
1986.85-920,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,960.266,967.538,"Of course, this principal could have restricted it any time after the Chadha decision by simply repealing this Section of the Act, couldn't it?"
1986.85-920,0,44300,william_t_coleman_jr,,967.538,972.424,"It could have restricted it... well, but that's a whole new legislative process."
1986.85-920,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,972.424,974.609,It requires two Houses of Congress instead of one.
1986.85-920,0,44300,william_t_coleman_jr,,974.609,975.709,"Oh, not only that."
1986.85-920,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,975.709,976.644,And the President has to--
1986.85-920,0,44300,william_t_coleman_jr,,976.644,981.446,It also requires the action by the President.
1986.85-920,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1001.359,1006.68,"--No, but my question is directed to the period after the legislative veto was clearly no longer out there."
1986.85-920,0,44300,william_t_coleman_jr,,1013.901,1030.694,"No, nobody... nobody... nobody said that, because, frankly, we had a legislative situation which has existed, that on the one hand, the unions wanted much more money."
1986.85-920,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1451.218,1452.318,"Mr. Coleman, can I ask you one other question?"
1986.85-920,0,44300,william_t_coleman_jr,,1452.318,1452.952,--Yes.
1986.85-920,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1452.952,1470.18,"How do you respond to Judge Starr's argument that one thing is fairly clear, and that is, that after the Congress compromised... he didn't use these words... between the union position and the employer position, they at least decided this much, that there should be some form of employee protection."
1986.85-920,0,44300,william_t_coleman_jr,,1481.469,1490.642,"Well, number one, I think when you reread the battle that went on, you realize that most of the certificated airline did not want the deregulation."
1986.85-920,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1491.826,1492.393,"No, but--"
1986.85-920,0,44300,william_t_coleman_jr,,1492.393,1495.059,This is not something that the airlines wanted.
1986.85-920,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1496.628,1498.963,--I mean... I mean... I'm just directing my remarks to employee protection.
1986.85-920,0,44300,william_t_coleman_jr,,1498.963,1499.413,--Yes.
1986.85-920,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1499.413,1500.547,They didn't want employee protection.
1986.85-920,0,44300,william_t_coleman_jr,,1501.665,1516.924,"Well, what I say to that is, Your Honor, when you reread that legislative history, you will find what the unions really, really wanted was the financial payments by the government."
1986.85-920,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1516.924,1517.674,Which they're not getting.
1986.85-920,0,44300,william_t_coleman_jr,,1517.674,1518.824,That they don't get.
1986.85-920,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1519.543,1520.709,Now they don't even get their second choice.
1986.85-920,0,44300,william_t_coleman_jr,,1520.709,1542.039,"--Now I really think... I really think it's unfair for the Government to be here saying that even though Section 43(a)(1) says, there should be financial payments, and if you look at the... if you look at the provision that they say is the determination was, that this changed the public should pay for, they're not going to pay for a penny."
1986.85-920,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1583.367,1584.3,"Thank you, Mr. Coleman."
1986.85-920,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,1591.639,1597.126,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1986.85-920,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1648.308,1650.391,0 xxx.
1986.85-920,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,1650.391,1651.26,Yes.
1986.85-920,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1651.26,1652.893,"That makes a big difference, don't you think?"
1986.85-920,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,1652.893,1654.628,But what the Court said in Chadha--
1986.85-920,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1654.628,1659.43,"I mean, there Congress told us what to do; that basically, it wants us to salvage as much as we can."
1986.85-920,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,1659.43,1660.03,--That's correct.
1986.85-920,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1697.222,1703.459,"Well, are you suggesting that the task is the same regardless of whether or not there's a severability clause, Mr. Cohen?"
1986.85-920,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,1703.459,1715.583,"--Yes, I'm suggesting that it is perhaps easier to satisfy the test when there is a severability clause in which Congress has told you what its intent is."
1986.85-920,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1728.01,1736.347,"You would factor in the existence of a severability clause, then, as simply... as weighing evidence of what Congress wanted?"
1986.85-920,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,1736.347,1740.651,"--As Congress' direct statement of its intention, yes."
1986.85-920,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1740.651,1746.888,"Mr. Cohen, do you think there's a presumption of severability in the absence of a severability clause?"
1986.85-920,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,1746.888,1787.215,"Well, I think that when the Court stated the test as being whether it is evident that Congress would not have enacted the otherwise valid portion in the absence of the unconstitutional part, it was certainly suggesting a presumption or suggesting that the burden of proof must be on those who would strike down more of the legislation than Congress... than the Constitution requires."
1986.85-920,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1787.215,1795.718,"Mr. Cohen, while you're interrupted, what is the present status of the monthly assistance clause?"
1986.85-920,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,1795.718,1803.824,"First, it is dormant, and will remain dormant unless and until Congress--"
1986.85-920,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1803.824,1804.324,Appropriates--
1986.85-920,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,1804.324,1808.295,--appropriates funds.
1986.85-920,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1848.203,1854.841,"--Do you think it ever will be made undormant, if there is such a word?"
1986.85-920,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,1854.841,1857.609,I have no reason to believe that it will.
1986.85-920,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1857.609,1875.254,"Do you also... well, I'll ask you: Could we come out with one answer about severability with respect to the monthly assistance provision and another answer with respect to the hire provision?"
1986.85-920,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,1875.254,1883.01,I think there would be no occasion to reach the first of those questions in this case.
1986.85-920,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1903.924,1910.411,"Mr. Cohen, I'd like to come back to the difference between statutes that contain a severability clause and those that don't."
1986.85-920,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,1931.424,1944.334,"I think that the presence of a severability clause does not change the test; it changes the task of the Court, which is applying the test."
1986.85-920,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1960.926,1964.33,"What guide is the... I don't... you say it, but I don't understand it."
1986.85-920,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,1966.847,1985.244,"What the Court said in Chadha was, that the severability clause told the Court that it was Congress' intention that one of the... that the substantive provision in that case should survive not withstanding the demise of the veto."
1986.85-920,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1985.244,1988.03,"Well, then, that's a different test, I would say."
1986.85-920,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,2015.947,2031.44,I think that you can come to a conclusion in this case based on the evidence derived from the structure and the legislative history of this statute.
1986.85-920,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2082.574,2084.907,"Well, may I just pursue that a moment?"
1986.85-920,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,2099.334,2099.667,Yes.
1986.85-920,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2218.28,2221.398,"Mr. Cohen, how does Congress know how we're going to come out on this thing?"
1986.85-920,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,2275.866,2276.716,--I don't think that works.
1986.85-920,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2357.001,2367.458,I have some doubt as to the correctness... perhaps the Court did say this in Jackson... that the presence or absence of a severability clause should never... should seldom make any difference.
1986.85-920,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,2375.064,2389.056,"I think that you have in this case, also from Congress, the adoption of the remaining portion of the statute as an indication of what it wanted done."
1986.85-920,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2422.593,2428.228,"Well, at least with the legislative veto provision, which... and there are a lot of them out there."
1986.85-920,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,2434.484,2436.817,The only number I know is Justice White's 200.
1986.85-920,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2436.817,2441.555,"Yes, but some of those may have... I mean the legislation may have lapsed since then, I don't know."
1986.85-920,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,2441.555,2446.708,"And this Court, of course, has affirmed the severance of several."
1986.85-920,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2446.708,2461.051,"But at least as to the legislative veto provision, you could say that the entire regulation provision to which the veto is attached falls if there is no severability clause, and it doesn't fall, so long as it can mechanically work, if there is one."
1986.85-920,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,2468.455,2484.999,"First of all, even if that were said in this case, the duty-to-hire program would not, I suggest, fall with the legislative veto."
1986.85-920,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2537.016,2541.67,"Mr. Cohen, can I interrupt, because I just realized, I'm not sure I know what the issue is here."
1986.85-920,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,2550.442,2555.144,--I think they are contending that Section 43(f) and Section 43(d)--
1986.85-920,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2555.144,2555.61,"""D""?"
1986.85-920,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,2555.61,2557.012,--are both invalid.
1986.85-920,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2557.012,2567.701,"But the... but using Justice Scalia's test, only Section 43(f) would fall, and Section 43(d) would survive, because there's no legislative veto with regard to 43(d); is that right?"
1986.85-920,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,2567.701,2573.204,"Well, the answer to that is that there are two different parts of 43(d)."
1986.85-920,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2573.204,2580.175,"Right, but one of them deals with the preferential hiring; one of the two."
1986.85-920,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,2580.175,2586.781,Section 43(d)(1) imposes a duty to hire as a direct obligation.
1986.85-920,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2586.781,2587.547,That's right.
1986.85-920,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,2587.547,2592.083,That is not subject to any veto or any other contingency.
1986.85-920,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2592.685,2596.387,"And my question is whether that section... I should have said, not just (d), but (d)(1)."
1986.85-920,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,2599.339,2600.272,--I think it is.
1986.85-920,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2600.272,2607.695,I thought... I thought Mr. Coleman said he'd be willing to take his chances with the statute; that it's only the regulations that give him trouble.
1986.85-920,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,2612.33,2615.531,"Well, I'm very happy if he's conceded that Section 43(d)(1)--"
1986.85-920,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2615.531,2616.55,"--Well, that's what I thought he said."
1986.85-920,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,2617.466,2624.304,"--that Section 43(d)(1) is valid, because it imposes a duty to hire--"
1986.85-920,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2624.304,2626.572,"And it's your view, I take it--"
1986.85-920,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,2626.572,2634.762,"--a well defined on, directly on a well defined class of carriers, and it confers a right of first hire directly on--"
1986.85-920,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2634.762,2639.916,--And it's your view that duty existed during the period before the promulgation of the regulations?
1986.85-920,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,2639.916,2662.845,"--Yes, and that, by the way, to answer something that Mr. Coleman said, is also the Secretary's view of the regulations, say, at page 47A, nothing in these regulations shall preclude the exercise of statutory rights and duties between October 24, 1978, and the effective date of these regulations."
1986.85-920,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2662.845,2667.899,Certainly (d)(1) doesn't appear to depend for its efficacy on the issuance of regulations.
1986.85-920,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,2667.899,2669.351,I think it does not.
1986.85-920,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3157.233,3170.458,"Am I correct that the only regulations that are required to be issued under the Act are the guidelines under (b)(1), the financial assistance guidelines?"
1986.85-920,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,3172.826,3173.643,Yes.
1986.85-920,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3173.643,3182.532,"So everything else, in implementing that chapter, the Secretary could have done by adjudication instead of... instead of by rule, right?"
1986.85-920,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,3182.532,3208.249,"Well, let me qualify it to say that the Secretary's own assignments, the assignments to prepare and maintain and publish lists of available jobs, and to obtain information from the airlines for that purpose, are assignments that presumably called for him to issue regulations."
1986.85-920,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3208.249,3208.933,Really?
1986.85-920,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,3214.587,3214.97,No.
1986.85-920,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3214.97,3215.637,That's not a regulation.
1986.85-920,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,3215.637,3216.289,"No, no, no."
1986.85-920,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3232.864,3233.398,I'm not sure.
1986.85-920,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,3260.016,3279.595,"Well, I think it's correct that Congress not only... that Congress did not... not only didn't expect to veto any regulations with respect to the duty to hire, but that there's no sign that they had any affirmative expectation that whole provision, which is the only thing before us, would involve the issuance of regulations at all."
1986.85-920,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3279.595,3282.231,There's no requirement there that he issue any regulations.
1986.85-920,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,3287.785,3288.268,That's correct.
1986.85-920,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3315.769,3316.802,"Thank you, Mr. Cohen."
1986.85-920,2,44300,william_t_coleman_jr,,3320.237,3326.891,"Justice Scalia, your question, that's the reason why I called your attention to 46A of the record."
1986.85-920,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3337.996,3341.384,This is on page 46A of--
1986.85-920,2,44300,william_t_coleman_jr,,3341.384,3344.169,"Of the appendix, which is the record in the case."
1986.85-920,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3344.169,3344.936,"--Right, right."
1986.85-920,2,44300,william_t_coleman_jr,,3344.936,3347.019,He says--
1986.85-920,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3347.019,3349.638,"Oh, authority, Section 43(f) of the Airline Deregulation Act."
1986.85-920,2,44300,william_t_coleman_jr,,3349.638,3352.34,--That's what he says he's acting under.
1986.85-920,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3361.612,3363.648,"Oh, but that's not the point."
1986.85-920,2,44300,william_t_coleman_jr,,3366.6,3367.149,--Yes.
1986.85-920,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3367.149,3376.055,What I doubt is that he had to be... he had to act under... he had to issue any rules and regulations under 43(f).
1986.85-920,2,44300,william_t_coleman_jr,,3376.055,3376.388,Well--
1986.85-920,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3376.388,3388.179,"You see, by reason of... by reason of 43(d)... I'm sorry, (b)(1), he had to proceed by regulation with respect to financial assistance."
1986.85-920,2,44300,william_t_coleman_jr,,3394.5,3397.135,"--Well, I'd like to disagree with you, Your Honor, because--"
1986.85-920,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3397.135,3397.819,"I mean, he might do it."
1986.85-920,2,44300,william_t_coleman_jr,,3399.621,3413.746,"--if you go on and read that... if you go on and read the rest of the section, that he's also required to issue the other rules and regulations which the Secretary deems necessary to carry out this Section."
1986.85-920,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3413.746,3414.78,--Where are you reading from?
1986.85-920,2,44300,william_t_coleman_jr,,3414.78,3417.882,"I'm reading the same Section you're reading from, from (f)(2)."
1986.85-920,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3428.34,3429.056,If he wants to.
1986.85-920,2,44300,william_t_coleman_jr,,3430.542,3431.175,That's right.
1986.85-920,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3431.175,3433.827,But there's nothing that says he has to issue any regulations.
1986.85-920,2,44300,william_t_coleman_jr,,3435.544,3438.612,But the one issue he had to issue was the financial regulation; he's never done it.
1986.85-920,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3438.612,3439.398,"Well, that's right."
1986.85-920,2,44300,william_t_coleman_jr,,3440.348,3460.744,"And it seems to me that if you have a statute where the one thing it's clear that he was supposed to do, he hasn't done, I don't think you then say, well, I'm going to save another part of the statute where it's clear that the regulations that he's trying to issue is to enforce the second part of that statute."
1986.85-920,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3460.744,3462.777,--I have no doubt he's proceeding under (f).
1986.85-920,2,44300,william_t_coleman_jr,,3467.648,3472.719,"I mean, if he moved on another... if he cited some other authority, I may not be in Court."
1986.85-920,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3482.825,3485.61,"I'm not sure you understand why I think it important, Mr. Coleman."
1986.85-920,2,44300,william_t_coleman_jr,,3508.042,3508.608,--He could not.
1986.85-920,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3555.989,3557.974,"Your time has expired, Mr. Coleman."
