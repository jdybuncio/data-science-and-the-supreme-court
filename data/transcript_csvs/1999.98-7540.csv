1999.98-7540,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.286,"We'll hear argument next in No. 98-7540, Scott Leslie Carmell v. Texas."
1999.98-7540,0,38604,richard_d_bernstein,,18.934,19.926,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1999.98-7540,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,45.795,52.539,"Why do you call this a change in the substantive law, Mr. Bernstein, rather than a change in the evidentiary rules?"
1999.98-7540,0,38604,richard_d_bernstein,,52.539,57.272,"Well, I think both precedent and history indicate that it's a change in the substantive law."
1999.98-7540,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,89.953,94.906,"Well, it was sort of a witness competency statute, wasn't it?"
1999.98-7540,0,38604,richard_d_bernstein,,94.906,95.878,--I... I don't believe--
1999.98-7540,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,95.878,97.15,"I mean, that's what it's dealing with."
1999.98-7540,0,38604,richard_d_bernstein,,104.025,104.776,"--I don't believe so, Your Honor."
1999.98-7540,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,112.741,124.097,"Well, I thought it was pretty close to Hopt where... where convicted felons were originally not considered competent to testify, and then there was a change and they were."
1999.98-7540,0,38604,richard_d_bernstein,,124.097,124.658,Well--
1999.98-7540,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,124.658,132.105,And someone would have been convicted after the change but not before if that's the only witness.
1999.98-7540,0,38604,richard_d_bernstein,,132.105,142.38,"--Well, as Hopt makes clear, it four times distinguishes changes in sufficiency of the evidence from changes in evidentiary rules."
1999.98-7540,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,147.315,150.077,"Well, it was a witness competency issue, wasn't it?"
1999.98-7540,0,38604,richard_d_bernstein,,150.077,150.357,--Yes.
1999.98-7540,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,173.723,176.895,"Well, but the statute, the Texas statute, talks about the testimony being corroborated or not--"
1999.98-7540,0,38604,richard_d_bernstein,,176.895,177.555,That's correct.
1999.98-7540,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,177.555,182.268,--which is exactly what the... some of the other witness competency statutes talk about.
1999.98-7540,0,38604,richard_d_bernstein,,182.268,183.911,I... I don't believe so.
1999.98-7540,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,192.997,203.665,"Well, take... take the traditional common law rule that you can't convict someone on their own confession without some corroboration."
1999.98-7540,0,38604,richard_d_bernstein,,207.448,209.859,I would call that a sufficiency of the evidence rule.
1999.98-7540,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,218.455,222.258,--You spoke of the comparability of Mr. Fenwick.
1999.98-7540,0,38604,richard_d_bernstein,,231.945,232.526,Yes.
1999.98-7540,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,232.526,244.483,"That, it seems to me, is not the kind of rule that we have here because, as I read the... the prior Texas statute, it didn't require a second witness to the sexual act."
1999.98-7540,0,38604,richard_d_bernstein,,267.708,267.879,Sure.
1999.98-7540,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,281.786,282.999,It is certainly written broader.
1999.98-7540,0,38604,richard_d_bernstein,,282.999,283.189,--Right.
1999.98-7540,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,283.189,283.789,There's no question.
1999.98-7540,0,38604,richard_d_bernstein,,286.791,291.806,"Well, you do need a second witness here in that some form of corroboration--"
1999.98-7540,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,291.806,294.468,But not a witness... not an eye witness to the act.
1999.98-7540,0,38604,richard_d_bernstein,,294.468,299.1,"--Well, the... there's a split in the Texas courts as to whether you need an eye witness."
1999.98-7540,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,302.443,304.553,I thought it was enough if there was an outcry.
1999.98-7540,0,38604,richard_d_bernstein,,306.847,307.157,--Yes.
1999.98-7540,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,307.157,309.66,"If she had simply told her mother earlier, that would have been it."
1999.98-7540,0,38604,richard_d_bernstein,,309.66,312.412,"Yes, but even that requires a second witness."
1999.98-7540,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,316.877,317.047,No question.
1999.98-7540,0,38604,richard_d_bernstein,,319.758,320.099,Right.
1999.98-7540,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,320.099,320.77,--to get the evidence in.
1999.98-7540,0,38604,richard_d_bernstein,,320.77,326.834,"So, under the old rule, the testimony of KM was not sufficient by itself."
1999.98-7540,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,332.737,332.927,Yes.
1999.98-7540,0,38604,richard_d_bernstein,,332.927,337.652,--or to come in and testify that there was a timely outcry.
1999.98-7540,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,337.652,346.889,"What about... what about the corroboration here that the... the defendant himself passed that note to his wife, adultery with KM?"
1999.98-7540,0,38604,richard_d_bernstein,,346.889,351.693,"Well, we believe the corroboration issue, for purposes of this Court, has been waived."
1999.98-7540,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,371.035,374.638,"Well, what about as a matter of Texas law, though, since we're talking about the nature of this thing?"
1999.98-7540,0,38604,richard_d_bernstein,,381.213,382.254,"Well, I think--"
1999.98-7540,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,382.254,384.445,Can you answer that question yes or no?
1999.98-7540,0,38604,richard_d_bernstein,,384.445,390.45,--There are two Texas cases that indicate eye witness corroboration is required.
1999.98-7540,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,393.512,393.932,Well--
1999.98-7540,0,38604,richard_d_bernstein,,393.932,395.735,"Under other Texas cases, that would be."
1999.98-7540,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,395.735,396.915,--but presumably the defendant is an eye witness.
1999.98-7540,0,38604,richard_d_bernstein,,396.915,400.117,Presumably the defendant is an eye witness.
1999.98-7540,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,400.117,402.371,"And he has said, adultery with KM."
1999.98-7540,0,38604,richard_d_bernstein,,403.78,408.322,"Well, I think the principal reason it's not good enough is because the issue was not waived below."
1999.98-7540,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,408.322,418.98,"Well, but as I say, I'm not... I'm not talking about what's before us in this particular ex post facto issue, but I'm trying to get some feel for exactly what the Texas statute requires."
1999.98-7540,0,38604,richard_d_bernstein,,418.98,421.04,It... it might well be good enough.
1999.98-7540,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,437.813,452.914,"Mr. Bernstein, would the argument you're making carry over to a case where the evidentiary rule that was changed was the rule that a defendant could bring up the victim's past sexual conduct?"
1999.98-7540,0,38604,richard_d_bernstein,,452.914,455.243,"No, it would not, Your Honor."
1999.98-7540,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,551.838,556.842,"But when you say... as you say, the line is very difficult to draw."
1999.98-7540,0,38604,richard_d_bernstein,,569.119,595.087,"Well, the Fenwick's defenders... and we submitted yesterday a lodging of relevant pages of the debate in Fenwick's case... specifically took the position that a change in the required number of witnesses was a substantive change equivalent to a change in the offense itself and specifically said that such a change in the minimum amount of proof was an ex post facto change."
1999.98-7540,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,615.051,619.631,"But Fenwick's case was very much a bill of attainder, was it not?"
1999.98-7540,0,38604,richard_d_bernstein,,619.631,620.152,No.
1999.98-7540,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,622.504,623.245,They were out to get him.
1999.98-7540,0,38604,richard_d_bernstein,,625.727,629.109,"--It was a bill of attainder, but it was also an ex post facto situation."
1999.98-7540,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,713.117,718.562,"Mr. Bernstein, all of these cases seem to be quite far afield from what we're dealing with here."
1999.98-7540,0,38604,richard_d_bernstein,,749.814,753.236,"--Well, but the same would have been true in Fenwick's case."
1999.98-7540,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,785.269,790.441,"But I don't see how you can call it substantive, if it's just going to witness competency."
1999.98-7540,0,38604,richard_d_bernstein,,796.666,799.988,I think it is more than labeling because it is the rule here.
1999.98-7540,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,835.634,840.186,"Well, the statute is... is set out in the Texas courts... I mean, it doesn't read quite the way you say."
1999.98-7540,0,38604,richard_d_bernstein,,843.77,844.04,Right.
1999.98-7540,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,844.04,844.26,--on the--
1999.98-7540,0,38604,richard_d_bernstein,,844.26,845.992,Is supportable only if.
1999.98-7540,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,845.992,847.994,"--It doesn't say, only if."
1999.98-7540,0,38604,richard_d_bernstein,,847.994,852.387,"Well, it says if the victim informed any person, other than the defendant."
1999.98-7540,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,852.387,856.87,"Well, I'm simply suggesting that if you're going to quote a statute, you should probably do it in hic verba."
1999.98-7540,0,38604,richard_d_bernstein,,856.87,857.521,"Absolutely, Your Honor."
1999.98-7540,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,887.785,893.678,"Well, let me ask a question about this witness... as I understand it, this witness was competent before."
1999.98-7540,0,38604,richard_d_bernstein,,893.678,894.038,--Sure.
1999.98-7540,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,894.038,895.21,The witness could testify before.
1999.98-7540,0,38604,richard_d_bernstein,,895.21,895.248,Absolutely.
1999.98-7540,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,912.421,922.758,What is the law in Texas in respect to a person who's not a minor accused... a person accused of a crime involving a victim who's not a minor?
1999.98-7540,0,38604,richard_d_bernstein,,922.758,927.351,There is still a corroboration or outcry requirement for those above 18.
1999.98-7540,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,927.351,940.35,"I don't know whether to think about this as a witness... as a witness qualification case, in which case I guess you'd have a hard time, or to think of it as a change in the amount of proof case, which is what you're arguing."
1999.98-7540,0,38604,richard_d_bernstein,,940.35,940.861,It's--
1999.98-7540,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,940.861,943.452,"So, looking at it in context, I don't know what to make of the context."
1999.98-7540,0,38604,richard_d_bernstein,,951.278,951.719,--Right.
1999.98-7540,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,951.719,956.952,"But where an adult is the victim, you need either corroboration or outcry."
1999.98-7540,0,38604,richard_d_bernstein,,956.952,957.703,Right.
1999.98-7540,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,957.703,959.674,Is there any rationale for that?
1999.98-7540,0,38604,richard_d_bernstein,,959.674,962.966,I... I think there is no competency rationale for that.
1999.98-7540,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,983.682,996.4,"In other words, you're saying that... is this right... that with an adult who's a victim we think, for whatever set of circumstances, whether right or wrong... and they may be wrong in my opinion or yours or somebody else's and right in theirs."
1999.98-7540,0,38604,richard_d_bernstein,,1007.798,1012.33,When the... when the victim under the current statute is below--
1999.98-7540,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1012.33,1014.11,"I mean, that's... that's the way you want me to look at this statute."
1999.98-7540,0,38604,richard_d_bernstein,,1014.11,1015.642,"--18, yes."
1999.98-7540,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1035.513,1045.211,"Well, but we've already seen that this is scarcely a bright line rule since both from the bench and... and I think your response, it's very difficult to draw the line you're talking about."
1999.98-7540,0,38604,richard_d_bernstein,,1045.211,1047.924,I don't think it is difficult to draw the line.
1999.98-7540,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1060.312,1063.204,"Well, yes, but the... the trick is in the classification."
1999.98-7540,0,38604,richard_d_bernstein,,1063.204,1065.145,"Well, even Texas--"
1999.98-7540,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1065.145,1069.809,"I mean, Justice O'Connor suggests that you don't just get where you want to go by labeling."
1999.98-7540,0,38604,richard_d_bernstein,,1069.809,1075.291,"--Well, even Texas in their brief said at page 18, I believe, that this is a sufficiency of the evidence rule."
1999.98-7540,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1089.621,1093.063,"Mr. Bernstein, would you clarify one thing?"
1999.98-7540,0,38604,richard_d_bernstein,,1097.779,1100.48,"Under the new statute, 18 is the dividing line."
1999.98-7540,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1101.671,1105.074,But she wasn't trusted as... isn't that basically what it is?
1999.98-7540,0,38604,richard_d_bernstein,,1118.411,1130.009,"--Under the old statute, but even now under the new statute, the younger the victim is, the more power that one witness' testimony has."
1999.98-7540,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1130.009,1137.805,Let's go in again to your statement about the difference between the new trial and... and the judgment of acquittal.
1999.98-7540,0,38604,richard_d_bernstein,,1148.252,1157.358,"Well, that's the rule in Texas that an evidentiary error only requires a new trial and not an acquittal, and it's also the rule--"
1999.98-7540,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1157.358,1171.326,"Suppose in... suppose in Texas you had a... a... this second witness who testifies, but then on appeal, that testimony is stricken because of hearsay or something like that, no confrontation."
1999.98-7540,0,38604,richard_d_bernstein,,1173.289,1186.186,"--Well, actually this Court has a double jeopardy precedent exactly on point, Lockhart v. Nelson, which holds that in that circumstance where there is an evidentiary error and the remainder of the evidence is by itself--"
1999.98-7540,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1186.186,1186.617,Insufficient.
1999.98-7540,0,38604,richard_d_bernstein,,1186.617,1188.099,"--insufficient, new trial."
1999.98-7540,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1193.785,1201.009,"Well, so... so then doesn't that indicate that this could be something other than a substantive rule?"
1999.98-7540,0,38604,richard_d_bernstein,,1201.009,1220.61,"No, because under Texas law... and we cite these cases in our brief, both our opening brief and our reply brief, under the... both the old statute and the new statute, when it's not satisfied, the... the required remedy is acquittal and the required remedy on appeal, when it's ruled it's not satisfied, is remand for judgment of acquittal."
1999.98-7540,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1228.076,1232.591,What are we dealing with here?
1999.98-7540,0,38604,richard_d_bernstein,,1238.027,1240.337,"Yes, 13."
1999.98-7540,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1240.337,1243.681,And we're dealing here with only some of those counts?
1999.98-7540,0,38604,richard_d_bernstein,,1243.681,1244.472,Only four of those counts.
1999.98-7540,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1271.29,1280.777,And the underlying goal of the Ex Post Facto Clause you think is served by adopting your position here?
1999.98-7540,0,38604,richard_d_bernstein,,1280.777,1283.077,I... I think three purposes.
1999.98-7540,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1283.077,1284.179,"If so, how?"
1999.98-7540,0,38604,richard_d_bernstein,,1284.179,1291.665,"Well, I think, as I said, the ex post facto jurisprudence of this Court has always recognized this substantive versus procedure distinction."
1999.98-7540,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1294.088,1295.278,I... may I interrupt?
1999.98-7540,0,38604,richard_d_bernstein,,1300.721,1302.914,--I think Collins was addressing something else.
1999.98-7540,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1333.825,1336.837,I interrupted you when you were answering Justice O'Connor's question.
1999.98-7540,0,38604,richard_d_bernstein,,1336.837,1337.418,Yes.
1999.98-7540,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1341.592,1346.637,"Well, I... I was really hoping you'd address the underlying goals of the clause."
1999.98-7540,0,38604,richard_d_bernstein,,1346.637,1346.817,--Sure.
1999.98-7540,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1346.817,1349.439,What are we trying to protect people from?
1999.98-7540,0,38604,richard_d_bernstein,,1349.439,1361.537,I think we are trying in this case to protect the system from the legislature putting its thumb on the ultimate adjudication of guilt for past conduct.
1999.98-7540,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1366.71,1371.394,"Well, this isn't a very sympathetic case with somebody who's been abusing his stepdaughter."
1999.98-7540,0,38604,richard_d_bernstein,,1371.394,1372.553,--This is--
1999.98-7540,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1372.553,1378.958,"So, we're concerned because he should have known that she was over 14?"
1999.98-7540,0,38604,richard_d_bernstein,,1378.958,1385.093,"--This is a very unsympathetic case, I would agree, based on the findings below."
1999.98-7540,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1416.984,1433.665,"But, Mr. Bernstein, if the... one of the prime bases, I think you would agree, for the ex post facto bar is it's not fair to have a crime be one thing when the defendant commits it and another when he's subject to conviction."
1999.98-7540,0,38604,richard_d_bernstein,,1441.512,1451.809,"--It is correct, Your Honor, that one of the important concerns is reliance, and it is also correct that we do not raise a reliance argument."
1999.98-7540,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1492.616,1505.873,"But here, Mr. Bernstein, unlike the Fenwick case where they wanted to get this person, there's no indication that any... that the legislature was doing anything but updating its rules of evidence, bringing them in line with the more modern trend."
1999.98-7540,0,38604,richard_d_bernstein,,1505.873,1525.418,"I would agree, Your Honor, there's no indication that they wanted to get Carmell, but I believe that the clause and the purpose of the clause, especially as rephrased by Justice Story, goes to a change in a rule of sufficiency of the evidence that... that category four is not limited to attainder cases."
1999.98-7540,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1552.626,1574.871,"Does it matter that in the... in the attainder... or in the treason cases, the individual who commits his treasonous act very carefully in front of one witness only knows that he has a defense, whereas here, as was pointed out a moment ago, when these acts are committed, the... the putative defendant has no way whatsoever of knowing--"
1999.98-7540,0,38604,richard_d_bernstein,,1574.871,1575.672,But Fenwick didn't--
1999.98-7540,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1575.672,1576.602,--whether there is going to be a defense?
1999.98-7540,0,38604,richard_d_bernstein,,1576.602,1578.415,--But Fenwick didn't know that he had a defense.
1999.98-7540,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1587.702,1607.346,"No, but the... at the... I suppose the core of the... of the old treason rule did, in fact, give a defense and give a person a right to rely defensively upon his care in... in committing his arguably treasonous act or making the treasonous statement in front of one person only--"
1999.98-7540,0,38604,richard_d_bernstein,,1607.346,1607.757,I don't--
1999.98-7540,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1607.757,1610.428,"--whereas, there's no comparable argument that can be made here."
1999.98-7540,0,38604,richard_d_bernstein,,1610.428,1617.281,--I don't think it went to reliance and there's no indication of a reliance interest in the debates in parliament in Fenwick's case.
1999.98-7540,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1638.789,1639.701,"Very well, Mr. Bernstein."
1999.98-7540,1,29486,john_cornyn,,1641.741,1645.875,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1999.98-7540,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1694.579,1705.033,"Well, it depends on what you mean by evidentiary rules, and... and the normal meaning I think is... is what evidence is admissible and what isn't admissible."
1999.98-7540,1,29486,john_cornyn,,1719.167,1734.616,"Justice Scalia, I believe this is equivalent to the Court's decision in Hopt where previously the testimony of convicted felons was not permitted to support a conviction and then later that... that was taken away."
1999.98-7540,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1735.257,1736.619,"Well, that is an evidentiary rule."
1999.98-7540,1,29486,john_cornyn,,1752.718,1763.654,"--As I understand this Court's... this Court's writings, the only sufficiency rule that's of constitutional dimension would be the requirement of proof beyond a reasonable doubt."
1999.98-7540,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1763.654,1778.825,"Do you agree with Mr. Bernstein that under Texas law under the previous statutory regime, that if there was a conviction without the extra... without the second witness, it then goes up... it's reversed for that reason... there can be no new trial?"
1999.98-7540,1,29486,john_cornyn,,1778.825,1781.198,It would result in an acquittal.
1999.98-7540,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1782.368,1787.43,"Well, that does indicate it's a sufficiency of the evidence problem under Texas law at least."
1999.98-7540,1,29486,john_cornyn,,1787.43,1812.918,"Well, we would suggest that you can... we... the same problem I think that... that counsel and I and the Court perhaps are struggling with over whether this is a competency or sufficiency rule is the same problem the Court has had and... and counsel have had over the years dealing with whether mere procedural changes are excepted from the ex post facto rule."
1999.98-7540,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1812.918,1827.527,But... but doesn't his argument that a reversal for want of the required witness commands an acquittal show that under Texas law at least this is a... a sufficiency of... of the evidence problem?
1999.98-7540,1,29486,john_cornyn,,1827.527,1831.978,We do believe it is a sufficiency rule but not one of constitutional significance.
1999.98-7540,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1831.978,1833.39,What... what is the difference?
1999.98-7540,1,29486,john_cornyn,,1853.664,1854.746,"I don't believe so, Your Honor."
1999.98-7540,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1855.106,1857.329,"So, you think there is no such thing as sufficiency--"
1999.98-7540,1,29486,john_cornyn,,1857.329,1858.119,--The only--
1999.98-7540,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1858.119,1859.921,--under the ex post facto--
1999.98-7540,1,29486,john_cornyn,,1859.921,1860.352,--Under the ex post--
1999.98-7540,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1860.352,1864.095,--You're saying even if it has to do with sufficiency completely and only--
1999.98-7540,1,29486,john_cornyn,,1864.095,1865.023,--We believe that--
1999.98-7540,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1865.023,1866.476,--it's still the ex post... why not?
1999.98-7540,1,29486,john_cornyn,,1866.476,1867.354,--Excuse me.
1999.98-7540,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1888.909,1889.851,And in the treason case?
1999.98-7540,1,29486,john_cornyn,,1894.105,1896.476,In the... in the case of Sir John Fenwick?
1999.98-7540,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1896.476,1903.462,"Well, no, just imagine that a statute says you have to have two witnesses and they change it and say you don't have to have two witnesses."
1999.98-7540,1,29486,john_cornyn,,1903.462,1918.631,"We believe that would be a... a sufficiency rule and really no different than if the court... excuse me... the legislature decided to change the rules allowing the admission of the hearsay, certain kinds of hearsay evidence."
1999.98-7540,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1934.601,1937.934,"General Cornyn, could you comment on this aspect?"
1999.98-7540,1,29486,john_cornyn,,1959.358,1967.503,"--No, Justice Stevens, I don't believe that that is a valid distinction in the sense that one would be prohibited and one would be allowed."
1999.98-7540,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2011.043,2026.692,"Well, General Cornyn, you... you appear at least to be acknowledging that you think in this case the legal change that was made affected the sufficiency of the evidence that was required."
1999.98-7540,1,29486,john_cornyn,,2028.585,2030.057,"Well, only in the sense--"
1999.98-7540,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2030.057,2030.337,Yes?
1999.98-7540,1,29486,john_cornyn,,2034.658,2035.169,"--Yes... yes, Your Honor."
1999.98-7540,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2035.169,2040.214,"But you go on to say, but it's not constitutionally significant."
1999.98-7540,1,29486,john_cornyn,,2040.214,2041.704,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1999.98-7540,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2041.704,2043.574,"Well, what kind of a line should we draw then?"
1999.98-7540,1,29486,john_cornyn,,2055.683,2056.264,We believe--
1999.98-7540,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2056.264,2059.746,And there's some justification in our jurisprudence for that line.
1999.98-7540,1,29486,john_cornyn,,2063.489,2080.38,"--We believe in either of those cases, whether you label it a sufficiency of the evidence question or an incompetency question as the Court has cited in Hopt, that they would not violate... those kinds of changes would not violate the Ex Post Facto Clause."
1999.98-7540,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2132.412,2153.398,"General Cornyn, you... you cited Beazell twice and it did not mention the fourth category, but it did say that changes in rules of evidence can be applied retroactively if they... and this is the Court's words... operate only in limited and unsubstantial manner to defendant's disadvantage."
1999.98-7540,1,29486,john_cornyn,,2161.602,2174.211,"Well, we do believe, Your Honor, Justice Ginsburg, that this did operate in a... in a general manner that was permitted under the Ex Post Facto Clause."
1999.98-7540,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2182.008,2185.58,"May I call your attention to one other thought, General Cornyn?"
1999.98-7540,1,29486,john_cornyn,,2212.608,2235.223,"--Justice Stevens, we believe that the fact that the Court overruled Kring and Collins, as it did Thompson v. Utah, represents a contraction or at least, if not a contraction, a more succinct statement of the coverage of the Ex Post Facto Clause which we believe is more faithful to the original understanding of the Framers, as the Court stated in... in Beazell."
1999.98-7540,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2244.588,2245.269,What are those core concerns?
1999.98-7540,1,29486,john_cornyn,,2273.59,2284.706,"I would agree, Justice Scalia, that that would not serve a... a reliance interest, but it would... it would concern the vindictive law-making aspect."
1999.98-7540,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2284.706,2290.77,"--Well, what... what if the legislature changed the penalty from a maximum of 1 year to a maximum of 20 years?"
1999.98-7540,1,29486,john_cornyn,,2290.77,2293.411,"Well, I believe that would be prohibited under--"
1999.98-7540,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2293.411,2303.179,"Well, but would you say that... there was some reliance interest, that someone might go out and commit a crime... I'm willing to serve a year for it, but I'm not willing to serve 20 years for it?"
1999.98-7540,1,29486,john_cornyn,,2303.179,2304.899,"--Perhaps, Your Honor."
1999.98-7540,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2342.545,2357.125,"Can we assume in this case, if we take it as a beginning point... and you may argue about it, but if we take as a beginning point that it is an ex post facto law to lessen the government's burden of proof, do you lose?"
1999.98-7540,1,29486,john_cornyn,,2357.125,2363.56,I do not... I do not believe that we lose under those circumstances.
1999.98-7540,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2393.79,2400.775,"Again, from a policy standpoint, I'm trying to understand the purposes of the Ex Post Facto Clause."
1999.98-7540,1,29486,john_cornyn,,2410.022,2449.847,"--I believe, Justice Kennedy, it really relates to the mode of trial and the sort of practices that this Court has typically called procedural, that is, what evidence is going to be admitted, the sort of changes that the Court has certainly approved, which is labeled procedural, which have operated to the distinct disadvantage of criminal defendants in Daubert in 1977 involving a change in the death sentencing procedures, Mallet v. North Carolina where the Court upheld a change in the law which permitted the State to appeal which it had not been... had that right previously."
1999.98-7540,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2481.149,2500.029,"Your basic point in answer to Justice Kennedy is you say a rule of law that made it tougher to convict somebody by raising the burden of proof, if we could imagine such a thing, would not fall within the Ex Post Facto Clause."
1999.98-7540,1,29486,john_cornyn,,2500.029,2501.361,"I believe that's correct, Justice Breyer."
1999.98-7540,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2501.361,2510.117,"Then if that... if we don't accept that, then do you lose on the ground that this... is that... in other words, I'm trying to see if that's the basic issue."
1999.98-7540,1,29486,john_cornyn,,2527.303,2529.954,I don't believe we would lose in that... in that case.
1999.98-7540,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2561.976,2565.31,But this isn't a question of more evidence being allowed.
1999.98-7540,1,29486,john_cornyn,,2571.281,2589.833,"--Justice Scalia, I... I don't see the difference between what we're talking about here and, say, a change in the hearsay rules, such as I mentioned earlier, which would exclude certain testimony that would have been required for a conviction which--"
1999.98-7540,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2589.833,2598.208,"But the difference is you get exactly the same evidence in two separate trials, one conducted before the stat and one... one, you get an acquittal; the other, you get a conviction."
1999.98-7540,1,29486,john_cornyn,,2600.8,2618.654,"--Well, we... Justice Stevens, we disagree with... with the amicus, the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, which suggests the fact that it's case dispositive in the sense that in one case you get an acquittal; one, you get a conviction."
1999.98-7540,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2618.654,2630.161,"I know, but the point is it's case dispositive on the same evidence, whereas all these other cases, you say, well, the difference in the rule, let more evidence in or kept some evidence out, but here you've got exactly the same evidence in two cases."
1999.98-7540,1,29486,john_cornyn,,2633.644,2651.674,"Perhaps a more significant distinction that I should make is the fact that under Texas law corroboration need not duplicate the testimony with regard to the elements of the crime, but only tend to connect the accused with the crime."
1999.98-7540,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2670.347,2694.793,"What... what do you make of the fact that if there is a conviction without the adequate amount of evidence, as required by the statute, on appeal that conviction will not only be set aside for a new trial, but the conviction will be reversed and the defendant will be released as... as having been tried and found not guilty?"
1999.98-7540,1,29486,john_cornyn,,2707.31,2708.741,I believe it is and--
1999.98-7540,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2708.741,2716.246,"Well, that seems to me to indicate a... really a significant difference between rules of evidence and... and the rule that's at issue here."
1999.98-7540,1,29486,john_cornyn,,2716.246,2730.357,"--It could only, Justice Scalia, represent some anomaly of... of Texas law and some difference in treatment of the lack of evidence under Texas law as opposed to other jurisdictions--"
1999.98-7540,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2730.357,2734.819,"Well, let's assume that the neighboring jurisdiction, New Mexico, treats it as... as procedural."
1999.98-7540,1,29486,john_cornyn,,2747.227,2747.777,"--Well, no, no."
1999.98-7540,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2777.098,2778.23,"Thank you, General Cornyn."
1999.98-7540,2,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2779.931,2789.126,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1999.98-7540,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2846.264,2861.505,"But I suppose Mr. Bernstein's point and our discussion in this context is just to show that this is a sufficiency of the evidence rule, and if you accept that, then does petitioner prevail here?"
1999.98-7540,2,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2861.505,2862.126,--No.
1999.98-7540,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2935.019,2938.512,It... it has to do with whether... whether the defendant could be convicted or not.
1999.98-7540,2,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2938.512,2940.245,"So did Kring, Your Honor."
1999.98-7540,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2940.726,2942.665,"Without that evidence, he couldn't be convicted."
1999.98-7540,2,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2942.665,2943.216,"--But, Your Honor--"
1999.98-7540,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2943.216,2945.998,And the new law says that without that evidence he can be convicted.
1999.98-7540,2,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2964.551,2965.582,"--No, it would not."
1999.98-7540,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2968.414,2968.845,--It wouldn't.
1999.98-7540,2,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2968.845,2969.185,No.
1999.98-7540,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2989.118,2991.118,"So, you reject the third category as well as the fourth."
1999.98-7540,2,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2991.118,2991.959,"No, Your Honor."
1999.98-7540,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2991.959,2999.536,"Well, the third category makes unlawful, under the ex post facto provision, increasing the penalty."
1999.98-7540,2,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,3004.238,3006.259,And also it does not increase the punishment.
1999.98-7540,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3007.651,3008.922,You're going to just tag that on.
1999.98-7540,2,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,3013.925,3014.085,"--Oh, we don't think so at all."

1999.98-7540,2,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,3302.487,3306.26,--Because not all bill of attainders are ex post facto.

1999.98-7540,2,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,3335.94,3339.372,But I think that wasn't what Justice Chase was doing.

1999.98-7540,2,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,3400.182,3401.464,"Your Honor, may I answer?"
1999.98-7540,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3401.464,3401.603,Yes.
1999.98-7540,2,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,3401.603,3410.318,"Under Texas law, as the Attorney General pointed out, the corroborating evidence is not to the elements of the offense."

1999.98-7540,2,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,3425.05,3431.623,"--We believe it really goes to credibility of the witness, and the structure of the Texas law really reinforces that, particularly with the outcry requirement."
