1974.73-300,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,177.543,179.756,"Follow it, yeah."
1974.73-300,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,179.756,195.105,"According to the current statistics that have been provided to me by the Immigration and Naturalization Service, there are a total of approximately 50,000 daily commuters of whom 42,000 are Mexican aliens and 8,000 are Canadians."

1974.73-300,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,355.675,360.123,I hope you do.
1974.73-300,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,360.123,364.204,But this is the appendix.
1974.73-300,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,364.204,364.729,Yes.
1974.73-300,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,364.729,375.935,"So, in Section [Voice Overlap] [Attempt to Laughter] Section 211 (a) establishes the general rule that an immigrant visa is required for entry as an immigrant."

1974.73-300,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,427.789,429.465,That's one of the issues.

1974.73-300,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,475.886,478.254,Is the Service sponsoring anything over there -- there are no clarifications?
1974.73-300,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,478.254,480.18,No.
1974.73-300,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,538.84,545.392,Do you think that takes care of the next phrase who is returning from a temporary visit abroad?
1974.73-300,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,545.392,547.678,"No, that doesn't take care of it."

1974.73-300,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,572.87,573.838,"Well, that's what it would seem."
1974.73-300,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,714.324,715.681,What's the date of the report again?
1974.73-300,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,715.681,718.286,This is a 1950 report as I understand it.
1974.73-300,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,718.286,718.897,1950.
1974.73-300,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,718.897,730.101,"1950, but it was -- on the basis of that report, the initial Bill which ultimately became a section later, the 1952 Act was -- and the provisions are basically the same."
1974.73-300,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,762.953,766.708,"Do you think this takes care of the South of France, hypothetical --?"
1974.73-300,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,766.708,781.97,"Well, I don't think this doesn't address itself obviously to the temporary visit abroad, but I think it recognizes that this practice has been in existence that it's not necessarily inconsistent with the language that was ultimately adopted by the Congress in 1952 Act."
1974.73-300,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,796.554,802.937,"We should have it, Section (b), that we're talking about was enacted when, in what year?"

1974.73-300,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,804.114,804.835,Yes.
1974.73-300,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,804.835,821.483,"Well, the original language of 211 (b) was enacted in 1952, but it has been amended and the plaintiffs in 1965 and the plaintiffs -- I refer to Mr. Terris' clients -- plaintiffs because we're cross-petitioners here."
1974.73-300,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1203.893,1213.984,"Mr. Evans, in the legislative history that you cover on pages 52 and 53 of your brief, where there is an express reference to the so-called commuter."
1974.73-300,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,1221.874,1233.233,"No, there's nothing there is nothing in there that suggests -- as a matter of fact, I don't think the Service at that time had any clear notion of their being a distinction."
1974.73-300,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1260.543,1275.746,"Well, does a typical seasonal commuter come in, say, in March or April and stay until October or November or does he begin commuting on a daily basis for only part of the season?"
1974.73-300,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,1275.746,1278.354,"Well, again, there's a spectrum involved."
1974.73-300,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1307.817,1310.404,It's the regularity of the thing that makes them a commuter?
1974.73-300,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,1310.404,1311.577,It's -- right.
1974.73-300,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1333.878,1337.244,"Now, what's the statutory justification for that?"
1974.73-300,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,1337.244,1341.977,"Well, that's not a statutory -- that's a matter of practice, a matter -- the theory has been --"
1974.73-300,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1341.977,1346.471,"But if you're right on your statutory argument in the -- that's wholly unwarranted, isn't it?"
1974.73-300,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,1346.471,1349.565,"Well, such status having been changed."
1974.73-300,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1351.836,1362.89,"What status -- the status says that he's a resident alien, eligible to be a resident alien, is that it?"
1974.73-300,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,1362.89,1363.376,That's right.
1974.73-300,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1363.376,1364.541,"And if he is, he is."
1974.73-300,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,1364.541,1364.948,"Well, eligible --"
1974.73-300,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1364.948,1365.917,-- as per your argument?
1974.73-300,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,1365.917,1368.441,He has the privilege of establishing a permanent residence --
1974.73-300,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1368.441,1368.635,Yes.
1974.73-300,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,1368.635,1370.051,-- in this country.
1974.73-300,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1399.855,1405.243,"But your whole argument, as I understand it is that a resident alien doesn't mean that."
1974.73-300,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,1409.462,1409.871,"Yeah, but --"
1974.73-300,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1409.871,1411.132,"That's the keystone, isn't it --?"
1974.73-300,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,1411.132,1411.276,Yes.
1974.73-300,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1411.276,1411.863,-- of your argument?
1974.73-300,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,1411.863,1415.01,"Well, eligible to reside permanently in the Untied States."
1974.73-300,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1415.01,1415.598,That's what I mean.
1974.73-300,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,1415.598,1416.439,Right.
1974.73-300,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1416.439,1417.793,"Well, that's what I call a resident alien --"
1974.73-300,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,1417.793,1417.887,Yes.
1974.73-300,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1417.887,1419.905,"-- that's slightly wrong, but eligible to be a resident alien --"
1974.73-300,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,1419.905,1421.195,But that -- that eligibility is not --
1974.73-300,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1421.195,1421.867,And if he is --
1974.73-300,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,1421.867,1423.083,-- not permanent.
1974.73-300,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1430.594,1431.248,Uh-huh.
1974.73-300,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,1431.248,1436.595,"-- and leave for five years as aliens, lose their status and their ability to come back --"
1974.73-300,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1436.595,1436.88,And that is the matter --
1974.73-300,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,1436.88,1437.945,-- with an informal document.
1974.73-300,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1437.945,1441.591,"That is a matter of statute, is it not?"
1974.73-300,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,1441.591,1442.19,I don't believe so.
1974.73-300,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1456.494,1458.802,In order to maintain your status.
1974.73-300,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,1458.802,1470.089,"If you're leaving for a period of more than a year, you are -- I guess, it's up to a year, you have to obtain a reentry permit, at least that's what the regulation says."
1974.73-300,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1480.564,1481.843,-- page 80.
1974.73-300,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,1481.843,1489.883,"But this is the administrative interpretation implementation of the phrase in the statute, “such status not having changed.”"
1974.73-300,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1505.58,1512.144,"Mr. Evans, as a practical matter, how does the Service stay on top of this continuing employment?"
1974.73-300,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,1512.144,1549.408,"Well, I satisfied my curiosity about that myself and apparently, the commuters are identified by certain markings on the green card and to the green card is attached a form upon which information is listed concerning the last entry and concerning -- well, I gather that what is done is that the -- there are indications in code made on these attachments that indicate when it was he was last exhibited evidence of employment."
1974.73-300,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1561.865,1574.954,"Well, take a seasonal worker moving north during the season, he gets up to the State of Washington and the apple crop for some reason is late, so he sits around for a month, does he become ineligible because of that?"
1974.73-300,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,1574.954,1581.687,"It's only an absence from the country without employment, that's the key to ineligibility."
1974.73-300,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1585.506,1591.797,"Because at the end of the season, the seasonal commuter when he goes back to Mexico is without employment, is he not?"

1974.73-300,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1592.816,1593.12,Yes.
1974.73-300,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,1593.12,1599.361,"Yes, but he's -- if he's out of employment for longer than six months, he cannot reenter as a commuter."
1974.73-300,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1622.763,1638.845,"Somewhere in the briefs here, there seems to be some reliance and I think in the Court of Appeals opinion, on the fact that certain interpretations of these regulations and practices might jeopardize our relations with Mexico and Canada."

1974.73-300,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1753.761,1756.594,"Well, that's 4-years-old now, so it isn't so sudden as --"
1974.73-300,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,1756.594,1762.302,"Well, it isn't so sudden, but it would be sudden in the sense that there'd be no phase-out period, which is one of the proposals that is before Congress."

1974.73-300,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,1946.437,1949.119,I think that is really the government's position Your Honor.
1974.73-300,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1949.119,1951.015,"They didn't describe it that way though, did they?"
1974.73-300,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,1951.015,1951.789,"No, they didn't."
1974.73-300,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2011.548,2013.214,"Mr. Terris, a 140?"
1974.73-300,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,2013.214,2017.446,"No, no, 45."
1974.73-300,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2017.446,2021.652,We were just counting your pages.
1974.73-300,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,2021.652,2034.732,"For example, Mr. Gordon, the general counsel of the Service says, the commuter status and I'm quoting “the devise of convenience” “never specifically authorized by statute.”"
1974.73-300,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2114.026,2120.475,"When you say returning resident immigrants quoting from Section 211, immediately after --"
1974.73-300,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,2120.475,2120.53,Yes.
1974.73-300,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2120.53,2123.821,-- it's defined in Section 101 (a) 27 (b).
1974.73-300,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,2123.821,2125.05,I was coming immediately to that Your Honor.
1974.73-300,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2125.05,2126.831,"Okay, go ahead."
1974.73-300,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,2126.831,2143.901,"The government argues that the defined in Section 101 (a) 27 (b) means that you look solely to Section 101 (a) 27 (b), and that that definition becomes the only specification that has to be satisfied."
1974.73-300,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2222.859,2226.857,Are you addressing that now to the seasonal or to the daily or to both?
1974.73-300,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,2226.857,2235.575,"I'm addressing daily because the Court or Appeals for some reason, which isn't entirely clear, did not make the same type of argument for seasonals."
1974.73-300,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2235.575,2239.402,"Do you think the Court of Appeals cut the baby in half, do you?"
1974.73-300,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,2239.402,2240.99,"I think, that's fair Your Honor."
1974.73-300,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2276.677,2282.506,And it's possible that daily -- they really never paid any taxes of any kind?
1974.73-300,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,2282.506,2288.761,"Well, the daily -- no, the daily commuter Your Honor has to pay taxes insofar as he earns money in United States, but that's --"
1974.73-300,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2288.761,2291.329,"Well, that -- aside from that, but they didn't pay any --"
1974.73-300,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,2291.329,2293.489,That's exactly right and they're most -- and the commuters --
1974.73-300,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2293.489,2295.51,He's not a part of the community?
1974.73-300,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,2295.51,2302.276,He is not -- they're not eligible for naturalization which is of course the basic reason to have an immigrant visa.
1974.73-300,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2321.378,2337.554,"But do I understand there's one thing on which you agree with the government and only one, that daily commuters and seasonal commuters are really -- stand to fall together in this case?"
1974.73-300,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,2337.554,2339.821,I think that's probably right Your Honor.
1974.73-300,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2349.903,2350.642,Uh-huh.
1974.73-300,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,2350.642,2353.523,The seasonal commuter practice as the Service has admitted --
1974.73-300,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2353.523,2354.693,Is much more recent?
1974.73-300,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,2354.693,2357.316,"Is up until which -- was in the early 60s, there's some dispute whether --"
1974.73-300,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2357.316,2359.08,And that determination of the Bracero?
1974.73-300,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,2359.08,2359.539,That's right.
1974.73-300,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2360.135,2361.614,Except for some few.
1974.73-300,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,2361.614,2368.801,"Except for a few that existed before that, and the Service I think has admitted that and those quotations are in our brief."
1974.73-300,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2370.313,2375.776,"Then is the Court of Appeals right about the daily, necessary wrong about the seasonal."
1974.73-300,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2375.776,2376.9,Uh-huh.
1974.73-300,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2376.9,2378.555,A fortiori is wrong about --
1974.73-300,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2378.555,2379.184,Uh-huh.
1974.73-300,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,2379.184,2380.218,"Well, --"
1974.73-300,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2380.218,2381.134,Or do you want it -- ?
1974.73-300,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,2381.134,2381.345,No.
1974.73-300,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2400.789,2413.256,"Well, is the length of the practice leading to an administrative interpretation of its powers rather weighty in the legislative acquiescence doctrine?"
1974.73-300,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,2413.256,2414.468,"Yes, it is."
1974.73-300,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2577.957,2587.002,"Well, these figures that have been mentioned about the numbers of people involved, of course, don't take into account the illegals that are coming across the southern border particularly --"
1974.73-300,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,2587.002,2590.284,This case does not involve them in anyway Your Honor.
1974.73-300,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2590.284,2603.938,"Well, do the number of the illegals over the years have any bearing on what the Service did or how Congress reacted or failed to react?"
1974.73-300,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,2603.938,2609.684,"Your Honor, in all the reading I've done on the subject that the illegals has never been considered the same time as this."
1974.73-300,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2700.399,2702.804,That copy as I know is in your brief or somewhere else.
1974.73-300,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,2702.804,2703.15,That's right.
1974.73-300,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2705.073,2705.667,33.
1974.73-300,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,2705.667,2706.863,-- of our brief.
1974.73-300,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2762.69,2767.236,"Well, does the record show about the standing of your clients in this case Mr. Terris?"
1974.73-300,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,2767.236,2776.424,Standing was litigated Your Honor and the District Court found that they did have standing.
1974.73-300,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2776.424,2779.587,"Well, what does the record show factually?"
1974.73-300,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,2779.587,2790.905,"The only -- since this was -- there was no trial of any kind, either on the merits around them or on any jurisdictional questions, all it has is the allegations that --"
1974.73-300,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2790.905,2792.484,Well those are taken as true I think.
1974.73-300,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,2792.484,2794.769,"That's right, but the alleged --"
1974.73-300,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2794.769,2795.781,-- what they alleged?
1974.73-300,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,2795.781,2799.846,"Well, there were two individual plaintiffs in the Farm Workers Organizing Committee."
1974.73-300,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2823.254,2824.497,All of them employed?
1974.73-300,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,2824.497,2824.879,Yes.
1974.73-300,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2832.223,2834.005,And it was a class action?
1974.73-300,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,2834.005,2835.525,"Yes, but there was never any --"
1974.73-300,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2835.525,2839.515,"Never any determination -- was it a class action on behalf of all citizens, was it?"
1974.73-300,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,2839.515,2847.576,"Some farm workers, originally it was farm workers in California than the intervenors, who was farm workers in Texas."
1974.73-300,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3072.974,3074.46,What was the date on that?
1974.73-300,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,3074.46,3077.175,1957.
1974.73-300,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3080.69,3083.38,That the filing was revoked?
1974.73-300,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,3083.38,3091.268,"Until 1952, there were regulations specifically allowing commuters to come in without an immigration visa."
1974.73-300,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3100.952,3109.81,"Now, where can we find this language, is it at the back of or in your brief?"
1974.73-300,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3109.81,3111.741,It's got to be in --
1974.73-300,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,3111.741,3112.741,It's in our --
1974.73-300,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3112.741,3113.663,-- in your brief?
1974.73-300,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,3113.663,3119.549,"It's in our brief, I know, maybe in the government's too, it's at the bottom of page 5 of our brief."
1974.73-300,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3126.386,3127.074,Not inadvertence.
1974.73-300,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,3127.074,3128.271,Yes.
1974.73-300,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3130.288,3135.937,"It's from a -- that's from a court opinion, I take it, un-relinquished --"
1974.73-300,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,3135.937,3145.085,"No, I think that was actually first composed by the -- in the regulations Your Honor at least I don't know of the previous use of that phrase."
1974.73-300,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3269.834,3273.202,"Well, how about an agricultural worker goes from Mexicali to Calexico?"
1974.73-300,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,3276.877,3283.486,"Agricultural workers, I think, were perhaps some rare exception, that don't -- do not have permanent employments in this country."
1974.73-300,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3303.417,3320.293,"Where do you find in the regulation this sort of the statute to support for the distinction you make between available works for the Ford Motor Company, let's just say in Michigan coming from across the border and some other kind of a worker."
1974.73-300,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,3320.293,3327.459,"Mr. Chief Justice, our argument as to if they are an immigrant, there is no distinction."
1974.73-300,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3329.958,3332.873,(Inaudible) require both?
1974.73-300,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,3332.873,3333.37,Yes.
1974.73-300,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3342.971,3343.808,(Inaudible)
1974.73-300,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,3343.808,3348.663,"No, as an immigrant because he maybe able to get a Department of Labor certification."
1974.73-300,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3348.663,3349.757,The shortage certification.
1974.73-300,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,3349.757,3351.023,That's right.
1974.73-300,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3390.144,3391.384,Let us spot the exact --
1974.73-300,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,3391.384,3391.729,Okay.
1974.73-300,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3391.729,3392.889,-- place that will find your --
1974.73-300,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,3392.889,3394.42,It's right about in the middle of the page --
1974.73-300,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3394.42,3395.718,Alright --
1974.73-300,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,3395.718,3402.164,"An alien having a residence in a foreign country which he has no intention of abandoning, that so far is a commuter."
1974.73-300,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3444.029,3449.64,How can you come temporarily to perform permanent services?
1974.73-300,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,3449.64,3454.524,"Well, you come many times temporarily but the job is a permanent one Your Honor."
1974.73-300,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3531.622,3552.157,"You really -- your argument, if I've followed you and I won't vouch for that at all, if I've followed it, there are really three categories, the daily commuter, the seasonal fellow and then the man who comes everyday on a substantially permanent basis?"
1974.73-300,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,3552.157,3552.701,"I think, that's correct."
1974.73-300,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3552.701,3553.804,Three different categories?
1974.73-300,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,3553.804,3555.317,"I think, that's really correct."
1974.73-300,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3555.317,3571.252,"And do you think the first two categories must stand or fall together and the third is outside the reach of this holding, is that correct?"
1974.73-300,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,3575.055,3585.948,"The reason the third is -- I think, it's fair to say that the third is like all other daily commuters allowed to keep coming into the United States."
1974.73-300,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3608.538,3611.43,So this third category is outside -- outside of appeal?
1974.73-300,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,3611.43,3613.49,"I think, it's really fair to say it's outside the litigation."
1974.73-300,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3620.353,3622.738,Did the Court of Appeals deal with it?
1974.73-300,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,3622.738,3623.386,No Your Honor.
1974.73-300,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3668.577,3671.394,"In other words, we're right and we don't explain it."
1974.73-300,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,3671.394,3675.796,"Well, I rather not categorize that Your Honor."
1974.73-300,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3676.368,3678.294,"Very well, thank you."
1974.73-300,2,35781,mark_l_evans,,3683.099,3683.429,Surely.
1974.73-300,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3686.512,3689.115,"Well, then perhaps, your brother confused us."
1974.73-300,2,35781,mark_l_evans,,3689.115,3700.218,"There is -- addressing this last issue first, no legal difference between any of these categories, call them three or call them two."
1974.73-300,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3797.985,3803.811,"-- your view is, what was right about the seasonal, they were wrong about the dailies?"
1974.73-300,2,35781,mark_l_evans,,3803.811,3805.398,That's right.
1974.73-300,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3810.547,3813.146,And you reject the idea of a third category?
1974.73-300,2,35781,mark_l_evans,,3813.146,3813.853,That's right.
1974.73-300,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3813.853,3816.733,You say the third category belongs within the first?
1974.73-300,2,35781,mark_l_evans,,3816.733,3817.399,Yes.
1974.73-300,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3821.949,3831.682,"And in your view, he is a daily commuter, if he comes over to sell some merchandise for three days a week in the United States and three days a week in Canada."
1974.73-300,2,35781,mark_l_evans,,3831.682,3834.334,That's right.
1974.73-300,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3834.334,3837.068,Regular commuter might be a better name for him than --
1974.73-300,2,35781,mark_l_evans,,3837.068,3851.191,"Well, I suppose if, you know, now that the problem has been explored through litigation that the regulations about which we have some reason to be embarrassed might well be amended and the Service would like to amend those regulations --"
1974.73-300,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3851.191,3854.953,And you wish to defer on decision until you have that opportunity?
1974.73-300,2,35781,mark_l_evans,,3854.953,3876.518,"Well, I might say that it was at one point considered whether the regulations should be amended to correct the ambiguity, but it was determined, I think, quite rightly that it would be improper to make such an amendment, while the case is in litigation, and there has been litigation over this issue ever since 1966 when the case was instituted in the Ninth Circuit, Gooch against Clark."
1974.73-300,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3884.337,3884.977,Thank you gentlemen.
