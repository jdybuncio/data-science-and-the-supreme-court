1985.84-1340,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,91.339,"Mr. Oade, you may proceed when you are ready."
1985.84-1340,0,33935,k_preston_oade_jr,,91.339,94.853,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1985.84-1340,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,309.906,359.01,"Mr. Farris, do you think that a school board has the right to look at its employees overall and to look at the number of black employees it has and the number of black employees available in that immediate area for employment in jobs in the school and conclude for itself that the school hasn't done as much as it should have to employ black employees and develop a program to implement some effort to hire more black employees?"
1985.84-1340,0,33935,k_preston_oade_jr,,359.01,369.694,"--Justice O'Connor, we agree with that and we think that as a predicate for properly conceived affirmative action that is exactly what any employer must do."
1985.84-1340,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,369.694,380.128,"Well, could it, as part of the program, adopt some kind of layoff policy like this if it felt it were necessary to complete the implementation?"
1985.84-1340,0,33935,k_preston_oade_jr,,380.128,394.903,We think that there are some differences between affirmative action recruiting and what an employer may do to incumbent employees.
1985.84-1340,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,426.717,426.952,Yes.
1985.84-1340,0,33935,k_preston_oade_jr,,433.387,462.829,"I think, Justice O'Connor, there are, for example, school desegregation cases where the courts have found that in order to remedy on-going constitutional violations in segregated school districts and in order to have effective desegregation that it may be necessary to make layoffs by race, but only if strictly necessary to remedy constitutional violations."
1985.84-1340,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,515.51,516.963,What are you reading from?
1985.84-1340,0,33935,k_preston_oade_jr,,516.963,518.555,Paragraph 21 of the complaint.
1985.84-1340,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,524.897,526.49,May I interrupt you with one question?
1985.84-1340,0,33935,k_preston_oade_jr,,549.215,554.807,"To answer your question, Justice Stevens, I think there is and I think the Bakke case was an example of that."
1985.84-1340,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,554.807,563.741,So then it would at least be arguable... I am not suggesting an answer... that that kind of justification might suffice in the absence of any need to remedy anything?
1985.84-1340,0,33935,k_preston_oade_jr,,563.741,577.907,"It might suffice, but again... And, I think in the Bakke case there was a First Amendment interest there that the University of California Board of Regents had in an ethnically diverse student body."
1985.84-1340,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,585.121,586.746,"Well, put the Bakke case to one side for a minute and talk about this case."
1985.84-1340,0,33935,k_preston_oade_jr,,600.741,605.973,We don't think the achievement of this aim was for diversity on the faculty.
1985.84-1340,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,610.128,616.485,On its face it says the desirability of multi-ethnic representation on the teaching faculty.
1985.84-1340,0,33935,k_preston_oade_jr,,616.485,628.042,"--But, the goal that that is aimed at is proportional representation, Justice Stevens, between the population of minorities in the student body and the teacher population."
1985.84-1340,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,671.727,673.82,"Well, assume they had never had a black teacher before."
1985.84-1340,0,33935,k_preston_oade_jr,,686.394,691.987,"If they had never hired a black teacher and did not have any, I think this would be a different case and I think--"
1985.84-1340,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,691.987,695.968,"And there were never any available, so they didn't do it wrongfully in any sense, they just didn't happen to have any."
1985.84-1340,0,33935,k_preston_oade_jr,,700.732,703.934,"--I think, first of all, they do need to be remedying something."
1985.84-1340,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,725.316,746.307,"You would say then that if there were two people... They had a vacancy and there were two applicants, a white and a black person, you would say the state could not choose the black just to increase the number of blacks on the faculty absent some proof of discrimination in the past?"
1985.84-1340,0,33935,k_preston_oade_jr,,746.307,748.322,"No, we do not say that, Justice White."
1985.84-1340,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,748.322,749.072,"Well, you seem to."
1985.84-1340,0,33935,k_preston_oade_jr,,749.072,754.43,"First of all, this is not a hiring case and we certainly--"
1985.84-1340,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,754.43,764.769,Why would the hiring case be different if the reason one person is hired and the other person is turned down is a racial reason and there is no proof of past discrimination?
1985.84-1340,0,33935,k_preston_oade_jr,,764.769,789.135,"--We think in the absence of any remedial effort and the absence of any work force analysis and the absence of any under-utilization of minorities in the work force and in the absence of any goals and timetables or standards, yes, that would be impermissible for an employer, simply for the sake of race, to prefer one individual over another individual."
1985.84-1340,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,789.135,803.113,"But, you would say if the school board just thought the blacks were under-represented that the preference for the black would be quite all right as a hiring matter."
1985.84-1340,0,33935,k_preston_oade_jr,,803.113,804.315,We are saying if--
1985.84-1340,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,804.315,807.423,Even though there had been no constitutional violation in the past.
1985.84-1340,0,33935,k_preston_oade_jr,,807.423,808.845,"--No, I am not saying that."
1985.84-1340,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,816.669,826.181,So that in my example the state could not do that absent some proof of some past discrimination that had to be remedied.
1985.84-1340,0,33935,k_preston_oade_jr,,826.181,827.369,"--That is correct, Justice White."
1985.84-1340,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,829.93,831.085,May I interrupt just for a minute.
1985.84-1340,0,33935,k_preston_oade_jr,,860.527,861.964,"We don't think so, Justice Powell."
1985.84-1340,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,861.964,863.618,It has not been mentioned in the recent discussion.
1985.84-1340,0,33935,k_preston_oade_jr,,863.618,884.658,"I think that gets to whether... even if, even if you had some findings of discrimination in the Jackson School District in the hiring of minority teachers which are not present here, that the instrument chosen here would still be impermissible, because, number one, it is not properly tailored to remedy that."
1985.84-1340,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,901.369,907.836,Isn't it true that some of the teachers in your group got their jobs solely because of the color of their skin?
1985.84-1340,0,33935,k_preston_oade_jr,,907.836,910.834,"--No, we reject that, Justice Marshall."
1985.84-1340,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,910.834,912.99,Is there anything in the record to prove it?
1985.84-1340,0,33935,k_preston_oade_jr,,912.99,913.832,There is nothing to prove--
1985.84-1340,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,913.832,916.176,Didn't you have segregated schools in Jackson?
1985.84-1340,0,33935,k_preston_oade_jr,,916.176,919.035,--We think--
1985.84-1340,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,919.035,919.487,Didn't you?
1985.84-1340,0,33935,k_preston_oade_jr,,919.487,922.581,"--We don't believe that is correct, Justice Marshall."
1985.84-1340,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,922.581,924.876,You never had segregated schools in Jackson?
1985.84-1340,0,33935,k_preston_oade_jr,,924.876,931.904,The record goes back in this case to 1953 and we know one thing about the Jackson School District in 1953.
1985.84-1340,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,931.904,933.029,My phrase was ever.
1985.84-1340,0,33935,k_preston_oade_jr,,933.029,933.373,It--
1985.84-1340,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,933.373,936.607,Did you ever have segregated schools in Jackson?
1985.84-1340,0,33935,k_preston_oade_jr,,936.607,938.903,"--I can't answer that question, Justice Marshall."
1985.84-1340,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,940.168,940.478,"But, did you look that up."
1985.84-1340,0,33935,k_preston_oade_jr,,943.353,944.961,I was very interested in finding out.
1985.84-1340,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,944.961,946.054,"Well, did you find it?"
1985.84-1340,0,33935,k_preston_oade_jr,,946.054,947.163,We have data--
1985.84-1340,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,947.163,949.195,Is the answer yes or no?
1985.84-1340,0,33935,k_preston_oade_jr,,949.195,950.678,--The answer is the record does not show that.
1985.84-1340,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,950.678,952.739,"And, you didn't find it?"
1985.84-1340,0,33935,k_preston_oade_jr,,952.739,953.833,"And, I did not find it."
1985.84-1340,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1110.316,1119.422,"Mr. Oade, if there had been some segregation and if it was relevant, whose obligation was it to put it in the record in this case?"
1985.84-1340,0,33935,k_preston_oade_jr,,1119.422,1122.092,"The state's obligation, Mr. Chief Justice."
1985.84-1340,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1228.94,1231.08,"May I just ask, I want to be sure I understand your position."
1985.84-1340,0,33935,k_preston_oade_jr,,1233.517,1233.751,"--Yes, we do."
1985.84-1340,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1233.751,1236.109,To get the same ratio of teachers and students?
1985.84-1340,0,33935,k_preston_oade_jr,,1236.109,1236.328,"Yes, we do."
1985.84-1340,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1247.355,1249.885,"But, the earlier hiring goal, was that permissible or impermissible?"
1985.84-1340,0,33935,k_preston_oade_jr,,1249.885,1256.804,"A hiring goal, we think, may be permissible if you have some finding or determination of--"
1985.84-1340,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1256.804,1263.333,"Is it permissible to try to get the same ratio as in the employment market, but impermissible to get the same ratio as in the student body?"
1985.84-1340,0,33935,k_preston_oade_jr,,1263.333,1263.692,--That is correct.
1985.84-1340,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1264.582,1266.238,Would you explain why?
1985.84-1340,0,33935,k_preston_oade_jr,,1266.238,1267.503,Pardon me?
1985.84-1340,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1267.503,1269.956,Would you explain why one is permissible and the other is impermissible?
1985.84-1340,0,33935,k_preston_oade_jr,,1269.956,1272.377,"Well, one has a remedial character, Justice Stevens."
1985.84-1340,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1286.777,1289.354,It is not a remedy for the benefit of any victim.
1985.84-1340,0,33935,k_preston_oade_jr,,1289.354,1291.117,"--No, it is not, and that issue--"
1985.84-1340,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1291.117,1292.273,"But, nevertheless, it is permissible."
1985.84-1340,0,33935,k_preston_oade_jr,,1292.273,1300.006,--I don't think the Court has to reach that question in this case as to whether it would have to be victim-specific.
1985.84-1340,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1535.239,1542.283,"But, as applied to just hiring you wouldn't make that same argument, I take it?"
1985.84-1340,0,33935,k_preston_oade_jr,,1542.283,1547.515,"--Well, again, I am reluctant to answer questions on hiring because we say this is not a hiring case."
1985.84-1340,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1550.359,1558.683,"I know, but the Court has to be mindful of the whole picture in resolving cases, so that is kind of unrealistic to decline to answer, I think."
1985.84-1340,0,33935,k_preston_oade_jr,,1558.683,1565.507,"--I think to answer your question, Justice O'Connor, I can tell you what the practice is in this country today."
1985.84-1340,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1584.751,1590.607,"Well, is it unconstitutional to do that?"
1985.84-1340,0,33935,k_preston_oade_jr,,1590.607,1594.716,"We think... Well, the Constitution, of course, does not govern the private sector."
1985.84-1340,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1596.81,1599.027,Within the public sector is what we are talking about.
1985.84-1340,0,33935,k_preston_oade_jr,,1599.027,1599.355,--That is correct.
1985.84-1340,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1687.992,1692.896,"Counsel, this was caused by a contract, wasn't it?"
1985.84-1340,0,33935,k_preston_oade_jr,,1692.896,1694.209,"Yes, it was."
1985.84-1340,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1694.209,1695.66,This whole problem is the contract.
1985.84-1340,0,33935,k_preston_oade_jr,,1695.66,1700.564,"It is in a labor agreement between the Petitioners' employer and their union, Justice Marshall."
1985.84-1340,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1700.564,1702.375,"And, the union is 80 percent white."
1985.84-1340,0,33935,k_preston_oade_jr,,1702.375,1704.827,That is correct more or less.
1985.84-1340,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1704.827,1706.342,"And, that is what you are complaining about."
1985.84-1340,0,33935,k_preston_oade_jr,,1706.342,1712.934,"Well, the fact of the matter is we don't think you should look at the race of a union."
1985.84-1340,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1757.01,1760.524,"Well, I don't see how much clout 20 have over <eighty> [= 80] percent."
1985.84-1340,0,33935,k_preston_oade_jr,,1765.085,1770.144,"They have no clout to protect their individual rights, Justice Marshall, and that is why we are before this Court."
1985.84-1340,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1770.144,1779.547,You are saying that the 20 percent of the union should not have the rights that were negotiated by that union.
1985.84-1340,0,33935,k_preston_oade_jr,,1779.547,1780.719,I am saying that--
1985.84-1340,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1780.719,1781.983,Is that what you are saying?
1985.84-1340,0,33935,k_preston_oade_jr,,1781.983,1782.186,--No.
1985.84-1340,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1823.373,1827.387,"Counsel, that goes all the way back to Tonstall and Steele back in the 40's."
1985.84-1340,0,33935,k_preston_oade_jr,,1832.4,1835.102,"You are correct, Justice Marshall, thank you."
1985.84-1340,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1835.102,1838.774,"--There is nothing new about that, but that doesn't apply to this."
1985.84-1340,0,33935,k_preston_oade_jr,,1846.613,1861.452,"Justice Marshall, first of all, we want to upset it because it is unconstitutional and it deprives the Petitioners before this Court of their constitutional rights and we object to any characterization that this was carefully negotiated."
1985.84-1340,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1861.452,1868.605,"Well, whether it was carefully negotiated or not, if it violates the Constitution, your position is that it can't stand even if it is 100 percent correct."
1985.84-1340,0,33935,k_preston_oade_jr,,1868.605,1868.792,That is correct.
1985.84-1340,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1878.086,1880.726,"Your time has expired now, Mr. Oade."
1985.84-1340,0,33935,k_preston_oade_jr,,1880.726,1880.897,Thank you.
1985.84-1340,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1880.897,1886.957,Mr. Susskind?
1985.84-1340,1,32797,jerome_a_susskind,,1886.957,1891.563,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1985.84-1340,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2023.292,2033.617,"Mr. Susskind, before you proceed, did I understand you to say that the Board in 1972 knew it had been discriminating against minority teachers?"
1985.84-1340,1,32797,jerome_a_susskind,,2033.617,2034.428,It certainly did.
1985.84-1340,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2034.428,2039.505,Did it take that position in the litigation before the district court in the first case?
1985.84-1340,1,32797,jerome_a_susskind,,2041.379,2042.893,Certainly it did and in the first case--
1985.84-1340,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2042.893,2045.954,It did deny in that case it had discriminated?
1985.84-1340,1,32797,jerome_a_susskind,,2045.954,2049.047,--In Jackson One that is correct.
1985.84-1340,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2049.047,2049.375,Yes.
1985.84-1340,1,32797,jerome_a_susskind,,2049.375,2054.171,"Now, Jackson One, bear in mind, however... Judge DeMascio, I think, makes this very clear in his--"
1985.84-1340,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2054.171,2056.154,The same parties as in this case?
1985.84-1340,1,32797,jerome_a_susskind,,2056.154,2059.684,"--Different issues, however."
1985.84-1340,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2059.684,2061.776,"The discrimination issue wasn't different, was it?"
1985.84-1340,1,32797,jerome_a_susskind,,2061.776,2068.462,"Justice Powell, first of all, when this case was tried before Judge DeMascio it wasn't a question of whether or not Jackson was going to integrate its schools."
1985.84-1340,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2085.453,2088.624,"Well, whatever the issue the Board claimed it had not discriminated."
1985.84-1340,1,32797,jerome_a_susskind,,2088.624,2091.405,"Your Honor, not only did Jackson--"
1985.84-1340,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2091.405,2091.592,Is that correct?
1985.84-1340,1,32797,jerome_a_susskind,,2091.592,2092.779,--That is certainly correct.
1985.84-1340,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2107.196,2110.288,"While I am interrupting you, let me ask you this question."
1985.84-1340,1,32797,jerome_a_susskind,,2114.959,2116.364,No judicial by the Board.
1985.84-1340,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2117.146,2118.66,Has there ever been any judicial decision?
1985.84-1340,1,32797,jerome_a_susskind,,2118.66,2120.815,"--You have, of course, the NAACP."
1985.84-1340,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2120.815,2125.328,"The answer with respect to this Board is no, isn't it?"
1985.84-1340,1,32797,jerome_a_susskind,,2125.328,2133.637,"Your Honor, there has been no judicial determination and it was a voluntary effort to integrate and there was no reason for a trial."
1985.84-1340,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2133.637,2135.918,"So, there has been no judicial determination?"
1985.84-1340,1,32797,jerome_a_susskind,,2135.918,2137.48,That is correct for those reasons.
1985.84-1340,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2371.057,2372.604,Mr. Susskind?
1985.84-1340,1,32797,jerome_a_susskind,,2372.604,2373.198,"Yes, Justice O'Connor."
1985.84-1340,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2373.198,2378.665,Normally classifications based on race are constitutionally suspect.
1985.84-1340,1,32797,jerome_a_susskind,,2380.68,2383.944,I would certainly want to look at all the facts of the remedial nature.
1985.84-1340,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2383.944,2385.646,"They are suspect, right?"
1985.84-1340,1,32797,jerome_a_susskind,,2385.646,2386.974,They should be looked at.
1985.84-1340,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2386.974,2388.644,Classifications based on race?
1985.84-1340,1,32797,jerome_a_susskind,,2388.644,2390.519,"As the district court, of course, did."
1985.84-1340,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2390.519,2402.468,"And, normally I guess the court would look to see whether the government can demonstrate a compelling state interest to justify such a classification if it made one."
1985.84-1340,1,32797,jerome_a_susskind,,2418.227,2426.02,"Your Honor, let me make it very clear that what Jackson was looking at, both in 1972... and I will be glad to answer that further if the Court should desire."
1985.84-1340,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2426.02,2428.738,"Well, just a short answer in response to the question."
1985.84-1340,1,32797,jerome_a_susskind,,2428.738,2429.004,Certainly.
1985.84-1340,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2456.305,2463.708,"So, the Board does rely essentially on faculty/student ratio and the role model rationale."
1985.84-1340,1,32797,jerome_a_susskind,,2463.708,2465.925,"Justice O'Connor, I didn't say that and I didn't mean that."
1985.84-1340,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2476.97,2477.468,Integrate in hiring.
1985.84-1340,1,32797,jerome_a_susskind,,2483.262,2490.556,"--May I would just like to, if I may for you, lay out some facts that I think the Court should be looking at in carrying on this discussion."
1985.84-1340,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2549.674,2564.605,"Maybe I can't get an answer, but I really would like to know what the compelling state interest is that you are relying on for this particular layoff provision in a nutshell."
1985.84-1340,1,32797,jerome_a_susskind,,2564.605,2569.072,We have just dismantled a segregated system.
1985.84-1340,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2588.142,2593.484,To preserve a faculty/student ratio that the Board thought was appropriate?
1985.84-1340,1,32797,jerome_a_susskind,,2593.484,2605.947,"--At that point in time, Justice O'Connor, when you look at the number of schools we had and the number of minority teachers we had, about the first time you were going to get a layoff... We had just gone through this hiring effort to bring in these teachers."
1985.84-1340,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2641.059,2657.582,"Well, it is a knotty problem and it leads to the next question which is what means can be used to achieve a compelling state interest if you find that there is one for a race-based provision."
1985.84-1340,1,32797,jerome_a_susskind,,2657.582,2659.675,Certainly it is part of integration.
1985.84-1340,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2791.06,2793.559,"Mr. Susskind, can I ask you a background question?"
1985.84-1340,1,32797,jerome_a_susskind,,2793.559,2793.778,"Yes, sir."
1985.84-1340,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2793.778,2801.087,"At the time the layoff started... and as I understand it, they went on for a period of several years where the people were hired and put back and laid off again."
1985.84-1340,1,32797,jerome_a_susskind,,2811.691,2814.268,"Justice Stevens, I regret to tell you--"
1985.84-1340,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2814.268,2814.487,Does the record tell us that?
1985.84-1340,1,32797,jerome_a_susskind,,2814.487,2815.284,--I can't honestly tell you.
1985.84-1340,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2834.465,2836.385,Because she was teaching the wrong subject or something like that.
1985.84-1340,1,32797,jerome_a_susskind,,2836.385,2836.745,Right.
1985.84-1340,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2836.745,2837.478,Yes.
1985.84-1340,1,32797,jerome_a_susskind,,2837.478,2837.994,That is right.
1985.84-1340,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2941.061,2945.56,"Merit isn't involved, but race is."
1985.84-1340,1,32797,jerome_a_susskind,,2945.56,2947.949,"So are a variety of other factors, Justice White."
1985.84-1340,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2947.949,2951.526,Not in these layoffs.
1985.84-1340,1,32797,jerome_a_susskind,,2951.526,2957.649,"Well, you know, I have to tell you that I don't think that is absolutely correct, sir."
1985.84-1340,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2959.43,2963.912,"The case wouldn't be here if it weren't, I wouldn't think."
1985.84-1340,1,32797,jerome_a_susskind,,2963.912,2969.362,"--That is true, but all I am saying is when you are looking at the total layoffs, Justice White, you are looking at all of these other reasons."
1985.84-1340,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3339.588,3342.149,May I just ask you what may be a frivolous question?
1985.84-1340,1,32797,jerome_a_susskind,,3342.149,3343.961,"Yes, sir."
1985.84-1340,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3343.961,3355.55,"I was interested in the fact that minorities described in the collective bargaining agreement include blacks, American Indians, Orientals, or persons of Spanish decendency."
1985.84-1340,1,32797,jerome_a_susskind,,3361.22,3362.421,"Well, I didn't write that."
1985.84-1340,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3362.421,3362.765,Pardon me?
1985.84-1340,1,32797,jerome_a_susskind,,3362.765,3365.578,I didn't write that.
1985.84-1340,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3378.322,3379.087,I will ask you one more question.
1985.84-1340,1,32797,jerome_a_susskind,,3379.087,3379.384,"Certainly, sir."
1985.84-1340,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3379.384,3384.537,Would Asian students think that American Indians would be a role model?
1985.84-1340,1,32797,jerome_a_susskind,,3384.537,3390.692,You know... Let me say one thing about this role model question if I may and which I think will give you an answer to your question.
1985.84-1340,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3447.014,3449.076,"Thank you, gentlemen."
