1985.84-1077,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,9.778,We hear argument first this morning in Whitley v. Albers.
1985.84-1077,0,20860,dave_frohnmayer,,13.058,15.744,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1985.84-1077,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,381.331,386.533,"Mr. Attorney General, I hate to interrupt you, but the Eighth Amendment is the only one involved in this case?"
1985.84-1077,0,20860,dave_frohnmayer,,386.533,388.813,"--We contend that it is, Justice Marshall."
1985.84-1077,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,403.244,417.162,"Mr. Frohnmayer, do you think the due process clause imposes some separate obligation applicable to the use of excessive force in this situation?"
1985.84-1077,0,20860,dave_frohnmayer,,420.067,427.437,"Justice O'Connor, we do not believe that the... that that adds anything to the analysis that would flow otherwise under the Eighth Amendment."
1985.84-1077,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,427.437,437.215,"Well, do you think the standard should be the same if looked at under the due process clause for use of excessive force as for Eighth Amendment purposes?"
1985.84-1077,0,20860,dave_frohnmayer,,437.215,451.256,"Well, if it is a prison context, then I would suggest that no, that the Eighth Amendment should be the exclusive vehicle by which that is analyzed, or at least if the due process clause is considered the analysis--"
1985.84-1077,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,451.256,464.08,Why is that for a single incident that seems to have very little to do with conditions of imprisonment or with any aspect of punishment?
1985.84-1077,0,20860,dave_frohnmayer,,464.08,465.19,--Well--
1985.84-1077,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,465.19,472.106,"This is more or less a single incident in the process of putting down a prison riot, isn't it?"
1985.84-1077,0,20860,dave_frohnmayer,,472.106,482.259,"--It is a single incident, but the incident implicates the core of what it is that a prison is all about, which is the maintenance of security of people who are very dangerous people."
1985.84-1077,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,535.111,541.141,"General, I think the Ninth Circuit viewed this as an Eighth Amendment case--"
1985.84-1077,0,20860,dave_frohnmayer,,541.141,543.561,"Yes, it did, Justice Brennan."
1985.84-1077,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,543.561,544.499,--Not a due process case.
1985.84-1077,0,20860,dave_frohnmayer,,550.778,565.069,"I think that the standard that was applied took pieces of what purports to be an Eighth Amendment test, but in the application of that test to what actually happened, as revealed by the record, in fact diluted it and watered it down."
1985.84-1077,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,572.051,585.216,"It used the term ""reasonableness"" and ""reasonable"" several times, but it also referred to our decision in Estelle where a deliberate indifference was a standard."
1985.84-1077,0,20860,dave_frohnmayer,,594.603,605.1,"We think that it did, and we think that that is, that is the flaw of the Ninth Circuit's decision because it's one thing to articulate at least the verbal formulas of the tests evolved by this Court."
1985.84-1077,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,650.77,657.095,"The Court does purport to apply both standards and more or less homogenizes the two standards, doesn't it?"
1985.84-1077,0,20860,dave_frohnmayer,,657.095,659.704,"That is correct, that is correct indeed."
1985.84-1077,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,871.352,891.093,"General Frohnmayer, is there an element of kind of command decision in your reasoning that this is a little bit like war, at least, and that perhaps the prison officials may be entitled to sacrifice or injure one prisoner if it means that several hostages will thereby be released?"
1985.84-1077,0,20860,dave_frohnmayer,,891.093,896.856,"--They should consider those alternatives, Justice Rehnquist, but there is an element of choice of evils about it."
1985.84-1077,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,950.209,957.224,"Mr. Attorney General, could I interrupt because one point I want to be sure I have clearly in mind."
1985.84-1077,0,20860,dave_frohnmayer,,963.83,965.844,"A directed verdict case in the same standard, yes."
1985.84-1077,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,965.844,990.397,"And in the Ninth Circuit opinion, as I recall it, they made a point that if one views the evidence most favorably to the other side, one might conclude that the height... that the crisis had pretty much passed, that the conditions had subsided to a certain extent, and so that the emergency justification, which seems quite persuasive, as you present it, wasn't as strong as it was in hour or two before--"
1985.84-1077,0,20860,dave_frohnmayer,,1002.83,1007.265,It is susceptible to that as a conclusion but not as a fact.
1985.84-1077,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1027.647,1035.753,Is it clear that... was this fellow Klenk the one who was holding... I had the impression there were two other inmates who in effect said we will protect this man.
1985.84-1077,0,20860,dave_frohnmayer,,1045.328,1050.498,"Yes, Justice Stevens, the hostage officer, officer Fitts, was being held in Cell 201."
1985.84-1077,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1061.087,1062.305,I see.
1985.84-1077,0,20860,dave_frohnmayer,,1062.305,1063.149,Klenk was armed with a knife.
1985.84-1077,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1078.081,1086.718,"Isn't it also true that during this period some other guard or some other was allowed to go in and talk to the hostage and go out and report that he was, seemed to be okay or something like that?"
1985.84-1077,0,20860,dave_frohnmayer,,1086.718,1087.218,Yes.
1985.84-1077,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1266.006,1268.146,"May I ask you one other question, General Frohnmayer?"
1985.84-1077,0,20860,dave_frohnmayer,,1268.146,1268.365,Yes.
1985.84-1077,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1268.365,1284.295,"They relied on an expert that the Ninth Circuit referred to, and I guess his testimony doesn't go far enough in your view to, even if you believe it all and disbelieve your experts, to satisfy your test, but supposing... we are concerned with the problem can you always get a jury trial in a case of this kind."
1985.84-1077,0,20860,dave_frohnmayer,,1306.911,1307.115,No.
1985.84-1077,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1487.963,1488.198,Very well.
1985.84-1077,0,20860,dave_frohnmayer,,1488.198,1491.432,Unless I interrupted your question.
1985.84-1077,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1491.432,1499.007,Mr. Mechanic?
1985.84-1077,1,25799,gene_b_mechanic,,1499.007,1502.037,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1985.84-1077,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1630.047,1632.873,"But that was a Fourth Amendment case, wasn't it, Mr. Mechanic?"
1985.84-1077,1,25799,gene_b_mechanic,,1632.873,1634.389,"Yes, Justice Rehnquist."
1985.84-1077,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1662.503,1669.86,What line of cases from this Court do you rely on for your due process as opposed to your Fourth Amendment contention?
1985.84-1077,1,25799,gene_b_mechanic,,1669.86,1684.384,"Well, this Court mentioned in the Ingraham case that the right to personal security is similar under the Fourth Amendment as it is under the due process."
1985.84-1077,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1686.493,1688.477,And that was the paddling at school?
1985.84-1077,1,25799,gene_b_mechanic,,1688.477,1695.208,"Correct, but it was in the context of a discussion, of course, of the Eighth Amendment's application to the paddling of students in school."
1985.84-1077,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1829.888,1830.967,May I ask this question?
1985.84-1077,1,25799,gene_b_mechanic,,1849.926,1851.317,Yes.
1985.84-1077,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1902.78,1919.712,"If the officers had only used, what do you call them, billies or the sort of sticks or clubs that police officers normally carry, and had hit and killed a prisoner, would that have been the use of deadly force intentionally?"
1985.84-1077,1,25799,gene_b_mechanic,,1922.991,1926.38,"It would depend on the facts and circumstances, Justice Powell, and I think that--"
1985.84-1077,2,20860,dave_frohnmayer,,3290.707,3294.112,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1985.84-1077,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3525.631,3529.036,"Thank you, gentlemen."
