1966.440,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,18.935,"Number 440, Clive Michael Boutilier, Petitioner, versus the Immigration and Naturalization Service."
1966.440,0,17619,blanch_freedman,,22.531,24.431,If it please the Court.
1966.440,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,434.988,436.821,But why is --
1966.440,0,17619,blanch_freedman,,436.821,438.005,Alone.
1966.440,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,438.005,438.918,I beg your pardon?
1966.440,0,17619,blanch_freedman,,438.918,440.404,"Yes, sir."
1966.440,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,440.404,451.149,Are you relinquishing the possibility that we might decide this just on the basis of an incorrect construction and application of the statute?
1966.440,0,17619,blanch_freedman,,451.149,452.856,"Oh, no, sir."
1966.440,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,456.713,461.64,"In other words, it's possible that this case could be decided without reaching a constitutional issue here?"
1966.440,0,17619,blanch_freedman,,461.64,463.388,"That is correct, sir."
1966.440,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,463.478,477.775,"Because it's not your argument, is it, that the phrase “psychopathic personality” is a phrase that is so at large that there's -- there has no medical -- no discernible medical meaning?"
1966.440,0,17619,blanch_freedman,,477.775,479.383,"On the contrary, sir."
1966.440,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,486.171,487.893,That's what I thought your argument was --
1966.440,0,17619,blanch_freedman,,487.893,488.055,Yes.
1966.440,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,488.055,507.741,Let us say that it has a reasonably definite meaning and that the Service in the court below went contrary to that reasonably as attainable and that with meaning in this particular case.
1966.440,0,17619,blanch_freedman,,507.741,509.971,"That is correct, sir."
1966.440,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,509.985,523.962,"But if that were -- but if it that were clear from the legislative history that Congress itself gave a particular meaning to that word, to those words, then I suppose you would reach the constitutional --"
1966.440,0,17619,blanch_freedman,,523.962,526.918,Then we would have to reach the constitutional question.
1966.440,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,699.509,704.609,Am I right it made the Congress -- Congress since have it expressly the words “sexual deviation” on the statute now?
1966.440,0,17619,blanch_freedman,,704.609,704.644,That is correct.
1966.440,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,704.644,713.978,They have both psychopathic personality and sexual deviation in the statute here.
1966.440,0,17619,blanch_freedman,,713.978,714.963,"That is correct, sir."
1966.440,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,726.277,732.633,"Well, I gather the report said that was done only to make clear that that's what they meant by psychopathic personality in the first place?"
1966.440,0,17619,blanch_freedman,,732.633,744.012,"Well, clearly, they're expressing then I would say doubts that prevailed in the section -- that prevailed in the statute, if that is what they are clarifying."
1966.440,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,752.51,755.322,"Well, I didn't say including sexual deviation?"
1966.440,0,17619,blanch_freedman,,755.322,755.99,They never said that.
1966.440,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,755.99,759.653,"They said, “Psychopathic personality or sexual abuse”."
1966.440,0,17619,blanch_freedman,,759.653,761.051,That's right.
1966.440,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,765.752,768.603,"I suppose that was in response to the Fleuti decision in the Ninth Circuit, wasn't it?"
1966.440,0,17619,blanch_freedman,,768.603,770.332,"That is correct, sir."
1966.440,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,776.851,777.282,To the Fleuti decision.
1966.440,0,17619,blanch_freedman,,777.282,778.318,To the Fleuti decision.
1966.440,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,778.318,779.542,Yes.
1966.440,0,17619,blanch_freedman,,779.542,807.91,"Counsel for the Government is not wholly unmindful that there are no boundaries and there are no real test/criteria and so they say in their brief on page 36, “There may indeed be cases where it is difficult to determine whether and in precisely what sense an individual should be deemed homosexual within the intent of the statute”."
1966.440,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1060.075,1063.124,So there really any issue about that.
1966.440,0,17619,blanch_freedman,,1095.122,1098.25,His entry was in '55.
1966.440,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1098.25,1099.445,Is that the first one?
1966.440,0,17619,blanch_freedman,,1099.445,1100.401,"Yes, his entry in '55."
1966.440,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1100.401,1102.832,‘55.
1966.440,0,17619,blanch_freedman,,1102.832,1110.09,"To that, may I submit the following thoughts for this Court."
1966.440,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1115.888,1121.121,"I'm not talking about medical evidence, I'm talking about the legal issue, is that the legal issue presented?"
1966.440,0,17619,blanch_freedman,,1122.771,1126.716,There's no contest that he admitted certain acts.
1966.440,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1134.842,1137.127,And there was no issue tendered?
1966.440,0,17619,blanch_freedman,,1137.127,1137.435,No.
1966.440,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1137.566,1138.484,Does he --
1966.440,0,17619,blanch_freedman,,1138.484,1155.49,There really was no issue tendered because whether or not someone is a homosexual is something that can only be -- even that issue can only be described medically and that has never been done in this case.
1966.440,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1155.49,1161.98,I thought that your claim was -- perhaps something at the amicus brief with that word is an adjective and not a noun.
1966.440,0,17619,blanch_freedman,,1161.98,1163.013,That is correct.
1966.440,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1163.013,1176.483,And that it's inaccurate to use it as a noun and that there's no issue in this case as to his having engaged in some homosexual acts --
1966.440,0,17619,blanch_freedman,,1176.483,1176.665,That is correct.
1966.440,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1176.665,1194.312,"-- on that or activity but it doesn't necessarily follow that he even medically, insofar as this statutory language has a medical meaning, it falls under that definition within that meaning, is that it?"
1966.440,0,17619,blanch_freedman,,1194.312,1201.45,"That is absolutely correct, sir."
1966.440,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1258.234,1261.699,"And there is no question about that as a factual statement, is there?"
1966.440,0,17619,blanch_freedman,,1261.699,1263.4,That is a factual statement.
1966.440,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1320.792,1323.383,"These practices he lived -- he's lived in New York, hasn't he?"
1966.440,0,17619,blanch_freedman,,1323.383,1323.951,That's right.
1966.440,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1323.951,1326.718,"And these practices are criminal under the law of New York, aren't they?"
1966.440,0,17619,blanch_freedman,,1326.718,1328.881,That is correct.
1966.440,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1328.964,1342.267,"And suppose that -- there's no reason I suppose that the criminal laws there any -- any lesser deterrent is there than the threat of a deportation? I mean, if you're right --"
1966.440,0,17619,blanch_freedman,,1342.267,1351.281,They have it -- I'm not too sure on the criminal law whether -- or whether just to what extent it is.
1966.440,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1819.812,1823.417,Mr. Lewin?
1966.440,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,1823.417,1827.27,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1966.440,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1894.494,1903.968,"But if the claim is not only that the -- that the statutory phrases not sufficiently specific, it's -- that it's not sufficiently accurate."
1966.440,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,1908.992,1916.996,"Well, to that extend, Mr. Justice Stewart, we think that that's really something that prevailed petitioner's basic argument."
1966.440,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2012.66,2016.031,"Well, what makes you say that so clear on the legislative history?"
1966.440,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,2016.031,2016.762,Well --
1966.440,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2016.762,2042.933,"I read your brief on some care and it seems to me that what you do is to -- in substance, to rely upon the report that was submitted by the Public Health Service in which is extracted on pages 23 and following of your brief."
1966.440,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2088.039,2091.98,How did the bill -- how did the bill read when it was introduced?
1966.440,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,2091.98,2106.395,"When it first introduced in the Congress, Mr. Chief Justice, the Senate had specific provision which read that, aliens excludable include homosexuals and sex perverts."
1966.440,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2122.054,2124.347,And there are two possibilities.
1966.440,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,2156.923,2158.364,Right.
1966.440,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2208.658,2212.496,"Well, that -- that that problem you said is as clear as mud to me."
1966.440,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,2239.699,2239.964,Right.
1966.440,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2239.964,2245.654,"Which is not the same as saying that persons suffering, you remember your rules of logic?"
1966.440,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,2253.838,2256.175,"Now, we don't -- I agree with you, Mr. Justice Fortas."
1966.440,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2271.902,2272.199,"Yes, but I --"
1966.440,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,2272.199,2272.371,There may be people --
1966.440,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2272.371,2275.134,explained to you that that is arguable.
1966.440,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,2275.134,2275.301,Well --
1966.440,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2275.301,2284.734,It's also possible to read this to mean something that I take it from the briefs here as more consonant with medical science.
1966.440,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,2297.297,2297.322,Right.
1966.440,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2297.322,2302.485,And that's your -- that seems to be the medical authority.
1966.440,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,2321.302,2331.187,Right but we even -- accepting certainly as I do that the Public Health Service recommendation is subject to differing constructions.
1966.440,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2412.474,2420.716,And you think sexual deviates and persons who have engaged in homosexual acts are synonymous?
1966.440,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,2420.716,2421.289,No.
1966.440,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2465.589,2471.025,But was there a finding in this case that this man is a sexual deviate?
1966.440,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,2471.025,2473.328,"He is based upon -- yes, he was."
1966.440,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2473.337,2474.225,There was such finding.
1966.440,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,2474.225,2475.263,"There was -- yes, sir."
1966.440,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2475.28,2476.398,So many words.
1966.440,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,2476.398,2486.686,"Yes, there's a Public Health Service finding on the basis of the Public Health Service psychiatrist and doctors examining the statements of the petitioner."
1966.440,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2553.276,2555.873,In the extent of that word it has meaning but it may have no meaning.
1966.440,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,2560.044,2560.486,Right.
1966.440,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2561.537,2564.682,And then there's no argument about those facts?
1966.440,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,2564.682,2586.886,"There's no argument about those facts but there's also no argument that he himself said in -- as a matter of fact, it was Selective Service Board that he was homosexual and that he received a correct classification on that basis, so that the petitioner himself is not attempting in anyway to challenge that kind of a finding."
1966.440,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2734.26,2744.549,Are you suggesting from this proceeding would never have been brought or rather would have been brought as it's never been in the evidence of post-entry?
1966.440,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,2744.549,2747.719,"No, as a practical fact, of course, Mr. Justice Brennan the only way that --"
1966.440,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2747.719,2750.269,"Well, I had -- had some considerable relevance to it --"
1966.440,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,2750.269,2750.453,Oh!
1966.440,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2821.987,2826.64,"Mr. Lewin, let me be clear about one thing."
1966.440,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,2867.694,2870.008,"If I could qualify that, I think it would be right."
1966.440,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2903.162,2906.705,"You don't make -- you don't make that point in your brief, did you?"
1966.440,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,2908.665,2922.615,What we did in our brief I think is that we disclaimed any reliance on any absolute medical knowledge which would today make it entirely clear that homosexuality is a form of psychopathic personality.
1966.440,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2925.888,2929.83,Are you sure you're sufficiently cautious in that last pages?
1966.440,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,2929.83,2932.832,"Well, I try to be."
1966.440,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2967.58,2982.146,"Which is to say that that Congress had said in psychopathic personality that aliens afflicted with dandruff, a legislative history show they must to include homosexual as among those inflicted with dandruff."
1966.440,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,2983.102,2986.716,"No, we would not be making that argument."
1966.440,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3017.057,3019.998,What about the change in the statute approved?
1966.440,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,3031.38,3031.384,Psychopathic.
1966.440,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3031.384,3034.083,-- psychopathic person or -- and/or sexual deviate.
1966.440,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,3034.083,3035.609,Right.
1966.440,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3035.841,3036.942,Is that the change?
1966.440,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,3036.942,3039.795,-- the legislative history certainly isn't explicit on that.
1966.440,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3059.5,3067.256,So that if you think it may now be that all over -- original psychopathic personality has been retained.
1966.440,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,3074.711,3075.391,"I think, sir."
1966.440,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3081.069,3083.319,"Well, it's now narrowed -- if that could --"
1966.440,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,3083.319,3083.839,That's right.
1966.440,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3083.839,3088.695,"-- now, it means that psychopathic personality be read more narrowly than in initial virtue."
1966.440,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,3088.695,3089.506,That's right.
1966.440,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3104.96,3113.32,"I suppose -- do you understand the present statute, sexual deviation to refer to condition or to conduct?"
1966.440,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,3113.32,3114.968,We think that it refers to a condition.
1966.440,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3116.432,3118.108,Should be ready to wait.
1966.440,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,3118.108,3120.616,"Well, it does say “afflicted” and I think afflicted --"
1966.440,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3120.616,3121.213,"Now, I see."
1966.440,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,3121.213,3122.834,-- as one can hardly be afflicted with --
1966.440,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3122.834,3123.459,I see.
1966.440,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,3123.459,3125.925,-- what he has done in the past.
1966.440,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3125.925,3129.329,That -- it's whether or not meaning of that.
1966.440,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,3129.329,3130.095,Yes.
1966.440,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3130.095,3140.034,"That also, of course, I presume would include that sexual deviation other than and in addition to homosexual sexual deviation, wouldn't it?"
1966.440,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,3140.034,3140.801,That's right.
1966.440,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3196.346,3201.918,"So, it might not have tried then if the United States would know and actually know."
1966.440,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,3201.918,3202.725,"That's true, Mr. Justice Fortas."
1966.440,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3202.725,3206.936,It can infer that Canadian would know the laws of the New York State.
1966.440,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,3209.03,3209.562,"That's true, Mr. Justice Fortas."
1966.440,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3209.562,3211.394,If the law of that.
1966.440,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,3211.394,3226.56,"But we think that to that extent, to the extent that there's any suggestion in the -- a void for vagueness argument that somebody in petitioner's position has a right to rely on what he knows at the time he enters the United States."
1966.440,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3240.706,3256.06,"Now, the other aspect of vagueness here is that made a good idea for Congress to be quite specific and when it tells the Immigration and Naturalization Service, do you think so?"
1966.440,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,3256.06,3256.899,Yes.
1966.440,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3332.293,3333.746,Why that's what you are?
1966.440,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,3333.746,3335.255,Yes.
1966.440,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3335.255,3344.805,"Except Mr. Lewin, is this -- this is only the Court have ordered that this apply on -- the most excluded, seriously -- excluded from admission in them."
1966.440,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,3344.805,3345.481,Excluded from initial --
1966.440,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3345.481,3351.273,"Now, I only question to ask an applicant like this which might elicit in response."
1966.440,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,3351.273,3353.164,They were none at the time of petitioner's entry.
1966.440,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3353.164,3355.019,"So are that now, since they've added --"
1966.440,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,3355.019,3356.669,Since they've added sexual deviation.
1966.440,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3369.368,3377.985,"Administratively, not talking about the new amendment but the statute as we have it here."
1966.440,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,3382.74,3383.791,I don't know.
1966.440,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3383.791,3388.86,"Really, this is -- this is that -- these are the only people excluded frankly speaking, aren't they?"
1966.440,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,3390.984,3392.532,You mean un -- yes.
1966.440,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3394.572,3395.096,Yes.
1966.440,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,3406.669,3409.053,I really couldn't give you an answer to that offense.
1966.440,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3409.053,3411.664,It might be of some importance.
1966.440,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,3429.37,3430.943,We think it's a broad and definable class.
1966.440,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3430.943,3431.248,Yes.
1966.440,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,3442.537,3448.085,"Well, they may have been the only ones who were in fact excluded but I think --"
1966.440,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3448.085,3448.884,Or deported?
1966.440,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,3448.884,3449.802,Or deported.
1966.440,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3513.602,3514.997,What did you read?
1966.440,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,3514.997,3518.912,With minimal subjective anxiety and little or no distress.
1966.440,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3518.912,3522.087,With minimal subjective anxiety and little or no distress.
1966.440,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,3527.04,3537.165,"Well, that's all -- that's all of course qualified by the Introductory Clause which says developmental defects or pathological trends in personality."
1966.440,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3539.806,3542.589,But I -- there is a suggestion in the briefs that's the reason I asked you that.
1966.440,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,3555.613,3557.738,"I can't say but I will supply an answer and I will find that out, Mr. Justice Stewart."
1966.440,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3557.738,3559.593,I'd be -- I'd be very interested.
1966.440,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,3559.593,3562.737,I will set up an answer on it.
1966.440,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3596.67,3601.827,"Let's see, is this an argument that in any event under the 65 statute, he should be deported?"
1966.440,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,3601.827,3601.987,No.
1966.440,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3670.572,3672.899,Very well.
