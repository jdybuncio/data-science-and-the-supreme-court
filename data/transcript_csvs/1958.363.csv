1958.363,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,7.073,"Dovie Ray Baker et al., Petitioners, versus (Inaudible) Railroad Company."
1958.363,0,26837,harvey_l_davis,,9.416,14.635,"Mr. Chief Justice Warren, may it please the Court."
1958.363,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,216.155,223.838,"May I ask you -- excuse me, Mr. Davis, so I can understand a little bit the Texas law?"
1958.363,0,26837,harvey_l_davis,,241.765,242.22,Certainly.
1958.363,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,242.22,244.9,-- even after she has collected the compensation under the statute?
1958.363,0,26837,harvey_l_davis,,244.9,245.351,"Yes, sir."
1958.363,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,245.351,247.26,Is there any subrogation of anybody to complain?
1958.363,0,26837,harvey_l_davis,,247.26,250.336,"The right of subrogation is allowed to the insurance company, I believe."
1958.363,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,250.336,250.771,Up to the amount that they pay?
1958.363,0,26837,harvey_l_davis,,250.771,252.184,We don't dispute that whatsoever.
1958.363,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,252.184,254.247,Up to the amount that they paid or --
1958.363,0,26837,harvey_l_davis,,254.247,254.502,Right.
1958.363,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,254.502,269.01,"And is it also true that the Texas Workmen's Compensation statute by its terms, accepts a workman who is covered by the Federal Employers' Liability Act?"
1958.363,0,26837,harvey_l_davis,,269.01,271.848,"No, it accepts employees of railroads though."
1958.363,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,271.848,272.812,Employees of railroad.
1958.363,0,26837,harvey_l_davis,,272.812,274.841,Right.
1958.363,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,307.41,313.568,"Well, what would be the situation if you did have a recovery under the Federal Employers' Liability Act?"
1958.363,0,26837,harvey_l_davis,,317.074,317.813,Yes sir.
1958.363,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,317.813,320.987,Then what happens to that $8000?
1958.363,0,26837,harvey_l_davis,,320.987,326.728,"If it's on common law negligence, there's no question that there is a right of subrogation by the insurance company."
1958.363,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,326.728,329.66,So even to an award under the Federal Employers' Liability Act?
1958.363,0,26837,harvey_l_davis,,329.66,332.66,"There is -- there is no law on that point, Your Honor."
1958.363,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,366.301,384.731,(Inaudible)
1958.363,0,26837,harvey_l_davis,,384.731,385.648,Right.
1958.363,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,385.648,396.584,"-- then that would be to say that this would be (Inaudible) Federal Employers' Liability Act case, isn't it, because they have to (Inaudible)"
1958.363,0,26837,harvey_l_davis,,396.584,397.94,"No, it wouldn't exclude it."
1958.363,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,421.818,434.188,(Inaudible)
1958.363,0,26837,harvey_l_davis,,434.188,434.661,No sir.
1958.363,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,434.863,436.224,(Inaudible)
1958.363,0,26837,harvey_l_davis,,436.224,437.001,"No, sir."
1958.363,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,655.454,664.775,(Inaudible)
1958.363,0,26837,harvey_l_davis,,664.775,665.27,Yes sir.
1958.363,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,665.27,667.612,(Inaudible)
1958.363,0,26837,harvey_l_davis,,667.612,668.402,"No, sir."
1958.363,0,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,975.318,977.937,What is grouting?
1958.363,0,26837,harvey_l_davis,,977.937,983.078,Grouting is the pumping of this cement mixture under pressure into the roadbed.
1958.363,0,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,983.078,988.538,"It's not the man that we see the Mexicans (Inaudible) working along the railroad, it's not that?"
1958.363,0,26837,harvey_l_davis,,988.538,990.66,"Well, Mr. Justice Clark, I'm not sure."
1958.363,0,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,1007.885,1008.417,All right.
1958.363,0,26837,harvey_l_davis,,1008.417,1009.239,But --
1958.363,0,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,1009.239,1010.762,"It's done with machines, I take it."
1958.363,0,26837,harvey_l_davis,,1010.762,1011.453,In machine.
1958.363,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1055.819,1068.095,May I ask (Inaudible)
1958.363,0,26837,harvey_l_davis,,1068.095,1070.071,No I don't believe we have any cases.
1958.363,0,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,1083.234,1083.493,(Voice Overlap) --
1958.363,0,26837,harvey_l_davis,,1083.493,1085.019,-- of them is the Mark case.
1958.363,0,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,1085.019,1090.33,(Inaudible)
1958.363,0,26837,harvey_l_davis,,1090.33,1091.684,I -- I don't know.
1958.363,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1129.545,1134.882,Are you using non-delegable in the sense that it's unlawful for them the contract out the billing (Voice Overlap)?
1958.363,0,26837,harvey_l_davis,,1134.882,1135.337,No.
1958.363,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1139.936,1149.608,"So that if it's performed by an independent contractor and some third party is injured, it's no defense that it was done by an independent contract?"
1958.363,0,26837,harvey_l_davis,,1149.608,1159.795,That plus the fact that they cannot exempt themselves from liabilities for having it done by immunity-indemnity such as they've tried to do here.
1958.363,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1159.795,1164.83,"Well, but that -- that requires a finding -- is that under Section 55?"
1958.363,0,26837,harvey_l_davis,,1168.138,1168.416,Yes sir.
1958.363,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1168.416,1169.237,-- of avoiding.
1958.363,0,26837,harvey_l_davis,,1169.237,1169.552,Yes sir.
1958.363,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1169.552,1180.678,"Well, are you suggesting that on this record as a matter of law, we should conclude that this -- that this contracting was done with the purpose and intent of avoiding obligations of the (Voice Overlap)?"
1958.363,0,26837,harvey_l_davis,,1180.678,1181.719,"Yes, I am, Your Honor."
1958.363,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1185.461,1187.324,That was very different.
1958.363,0,26837,harvey_l_davis,,1187.324,1189.395,"Well, the --"
1958.363,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1189.395,1196.274,"What -- what is there in this record to support -- perhaps you're right that it may support a jury finding that it was done on that, right?"
1958.363,0,26837,harvey_l_davis,,1205.636,1211.312,I don't -- I don't claim or say that they may have had the actually intent to exempt --
1958.363,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1211.312,1213.123,"Well, don't they have to under the --"
1958.363,0,26837,harvey_l_davis,,1213.123,1213.395,I don't think so.
1958.363,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1213.395,1214.384,-- under the wording of --
1958.363,0,26837,harvey_l_davis,,1214.384,1218.42,"No, I believe that if it's a necessary operation and practical effect to that."
1958.363,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1227.927,1231.901,Which part of Section 51 are you relying to?
1958.363,0,26837,harvey_l_davis,,1231.901,1240.398,The part that provide for the employees of the railroad --
1958.363,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1240.398,1249.643,"And the duty on the part of the railroad to take care of his car and engines, appliances, machinery, truck, roadbed, works and so forth."
1958.363,0,26837,harvey_l_davis,,1249.643,1254.163,"Yes, sir."
1958.363,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1254.163,1258.514,"That was in the evidence, is it not?"
1958.363,0,26837,harvey_l_davis,,1258.514,1269.837,"No, the only evidence was the testimony of respondent and witnesses that they didn't -- it was -- they didn't make the contract to -- to get around the Act."
1958.363,1,20679,d_l_case,,1610.774,1616.141,Mr. Chief Justice and Honorable members of the Court.
1958.363,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1730.017,1733.206,"Mr. Case -- Mr. Case, before you get into the law --"
1958.363,1,20679,d_l_case,,1733.206,1733.792,"Yes, sir."
1958.363,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1733.792,1769.324,-- would you mind commenting on -- on the argument of counsel to the effect that this contractor had the right to or not the contractor but an assistant engineer of the railroad company had the right even to discharge the contractor that he not only had the right to but he did direct to both the contractor and his work in the manner in which their -- their work was done.
1958.363,1,20679,d_l_case,,1769.324,1769.823,"Yes, Your Honor."
1958.363,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1769.823,1773.202,And all of those other things that are -- are in there.
1958.363,1,20679,d_l_case,,1777.607,1778.549,Yes.
1958.363,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1967.7,1972.588,That doesn't mean the whole roadbed in that vicinity is concrete is it?
1958.363,1,20679,d_l_case,,1972.588,1979.416,"No, that means that you pump as much of the material into the roadbed and that whole section as a roadbed will absorb."
1958.363,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1979.416,1984.464,"Yes, for stabilizing the -- the rails -- ties."
1958.363,1,20679,d_l_case,,1984.464,1985.95,"Yes, that's correct, Your Honor."
1958.363,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1985.95,1986.742,Yes.
1958.363,1,20679,d_l_case,,1986.742,2015.737,"Now, as I conceive or understand the testimony with reference to the engineering department or to inspect or marking the tracks or ties that was a designation of the area in which the work was to be done and understanding the true nature of the grouting work, I believe the record supports the testimony of the respondent's witnesses that is even the testimony of the petitioner."
1958.363,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2231.956,2236.82,"Well, wouldn't that depend or would that depend on the extent to which it was done."
1958.363,1,20679,d_l_case,,2277.6,2278.316,Yes.
1958.363,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2278.316,2279.415,"-- but it could be, could it not?"
1958.363,1,20679,d_l_case,,2279.415,2294.336,"As I have conceived it, it may be evidence that the contract is not what it says on its face than it is and it may be evidence that the contracts or written contract was entered into for the purpose of evading the --"
1958.363,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2294.336,2297.794,"Well, as a part from that even if it were not, even for another door."
1958.363,1,20679,d_l_case,,2310.148,2313.594,It may mark the notification of the contract if --
1958.363,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2313.594,2323.397,"Well, wouldn't that -- wouldn't that have a bearing on the -- on the fact question whether he was or was not an employee of the railroad?"
1958.363,1,20679,d_l_case,,2323.397,2341.923,"I don't believe that it would, Your Honor unless it is a case of an oral agreement so that the acts done show what the agreement was or unless it may be evidence that the written contract was merely a sham or a substance of that nature."
1958.363,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2343.717,2347.005,I don't quite understand why it has to be a sham.
1958.363,1,20679,d_l_case,,2347.005,2348.248,Well --
1958.363,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2348.248,2354.673,"However, your formula -- formulate the way you say it."
1958.363,1,20679,d_l_case,,2365.732,2370.558,"Well, I believe the Bond case as it is the right of control and not the Act."
1958.363,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2370.558,2371.316,Which case?
1958.363,1,20679,d_l_case,,2371.316,2374.301,"Bond against Railroad, cited in --"
1958.363,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2374.301,2375.458,The other case in this Court?
1958.363,1,20679,d_l_case,,2375.458,2376.425,Yes.
1958.363,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2392.037,2401.773,"-- that's what you say this record shows that in any event, if any railroad employee had anything to do with directing how this grouting was to be done, that was true only in isolated instances?"
1958.363,1,20679,d_l_case,,2401.773,2405.86,"I say not in isolated case, Your Honor."
1958.363,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2425.896,2427.074,"Inspection, really."
1958.363,1,20679,d_l_case,,2427.074,2429.302,"Yes, that's correct, Your Honor."
1958.363,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2429.302,2438.175,"Mr. Case, may I -- may just ask a question to see how far your argument goes?"
1958.363,1,20679,d_l_case,,2482.528,2489.977,"I think to its own employees, it has a non-delegable duty to maintain a safe place in which they are to work."
1958.363,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2489.977,2490.251,All right.
1958.363,1,20679,d_l_case,,2490.251,2501.634,And that your answer is that -- the answer to your question is that -- I'm not familiar with a particular case but it maybe that the railroad would be liable.
1958.363,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2501.634,2502.341,Yes.
1958.363,1,20679,d_l_case,,2502.358,2507.764,I suppose under the Sinkler case that the railroad would be liable.
1958.363,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2507.764,2519.168,"Well then if it is -- if it is a non-delegable responsibility for that purpose, why wouldn't it be for this other -- that -- I just want to get the distinction between the two."
1958.363,1,20679,d_l_case,,2519.168,2546.533,"Well, I can answer Your Honor only by -- in this manner that it has never been held insofar as I know that a railroad owes a non-delegable duty to its employees to perform work of this character only by its employees."
1958.363,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2580.228,2598.787,"The maintenance of track seems to be such a fundamental thing that I would imagine if anything was non-delegable, it would be keeping the roadbed in such condition position that it could be traveled with safety."
1958.363,1,20679,d_l_case,,2598.787,2609.534,"Well, in the Dougall case, it was as far as I can tell from reading the records substantially, just ordinary maintenance."
1958.363,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2617.929,2619.345,I wonder if it would bother you.
1958.363,1,20679,d_l_case,,2621.626,2621.675,"Not at all, Your Honor."
1958.363,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2621.675,2633.279,I don't want to use your time but would you mind telling me precisely how you find from this record this man was injured and what caused it?
1958.363,1,20679,d_l_case,,2633.279,2634.677,How I feel?
1958.363,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2634.677,2638.212,This man here in this case.
1958.363,1,20679,d_l_case,,2638.212,2643.332,I feel that it's his own failure to keep a proper lookout for his own safety was the cause of it.
1958.363,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2643.332,2647.14,What -- what about his injury?
1958.363,1,20679,d_l_case,,2647.14,2650.147,He had his back turned towards the oncoming train.
1958.363,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2679.623,2689.256,"Now, what do you understand is the evidence -- could be found from the evidence was the plaintiff's version of what caused him to be hurt?"
1958.363,1,20679,d_l_case,,2689.256,2702.927,"The plaintiff, as I understand the case, relied on numerous acts and his pleadings and then they requested the issues which he request to submit."
1958.363,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2736.46,2743.366,Nothing in connection with the way the track was at the time of the accident.
1958.363,1,20679,d_l_case,,2743.366,2746.271,That's correct.
1958.363,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2754.361,2761.144,Well -- I though -- did the jury find here those negligence of the railroad and negligence of the deceased.
1958.363,1,20679,d_l_case,,2763.249,2763.857,"No, I don't question at all."
1958.363,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2763.857,2764.306,No.
1958.363,1,20679,d_l_case,,2766.942,2767.483,That's correct.
