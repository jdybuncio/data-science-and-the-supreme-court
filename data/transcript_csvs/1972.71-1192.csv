1972.71-1192,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,28.274,Mr. Leeds you may proceed whenever you're ready.
1972.71-1192,0,16399,arthur_leeds,,28.274,29.18,Thank you Your Honor.
1972.71-1192,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,60.224,73.556,It will help me with the outset Mr. Leeds if I -- if you will help me get the -- clarify the situation that existed before this recent federal statute.
1972.71-1192,0,16399,arthur_leeds,,96.844,100.681,"Yes Your Honor, that is somewhat confusing."
1972.71-1192,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,167.653,171.163,This statutory royalty should be paid to the first recording company would it?
1972.71-1192,0,16399,arthur_leeds,,171.163,171.81,No Your Honor.
1972.71-1192,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,244.141,246.271,"Well, that is in connection with the new bill?"
1972.71-1192,0,16399,arthur_leeds,,246.271,251.42,"No Your Honor, that was in connection with the 1909 Act, and the original Act."
1972.71-1192,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,313.833,314.489,I don't have a –-
1972.71-1192,0,16399,arthur_leeds,,314.489,320.461,-- previous law on sound recordings recorded prior the Public Law 92-140.
1972.71-1192,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,351.396,354.979,What about after?
1972.71-1192,0,16399,arthur_leeds,,354.979,364.61,"Your Honor, with respect to sound recordings fixed and published after Public Law 92-140, they would be presumably covered by federal copyright."
1972.71-1192,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,371.324,380.699,So the State have a –- if a State that had a law before that has become an inoperative for the post-federal law.
1972.71-1192,0,16399,arthur_leeds,,380.699,383.096,I would think that their can be no question about that Your Honor.
1972.71-1192,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,530.526,534.665,As I have saw with many amicus groups here from -- many of them doesn't pay.
1972.71-1192,0,16399,arthur_leeds,,534.665,540.422,"I think they're more than that your Honor, I believe there are 10 States, of course the other side of that coin is that there are 40 States that do not."
1972.71-1192,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,540.422,541.388,They do not.
1972.71-1192,0,16399,arthur_leeds,,541.388,555.149,And – and I think that -- I think though the amicus Recording Industry Association of America has alluded to the fact that they have spent a great deal of money where at least that they've spent a great deal of time in attempting to establish these laws.
1972.71-1192,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,555.149,566.97,"(Inaudible), apparently where the States where recording into the industries, it's pretty large economic impact in the State of Tennessee, New York, California."
1972.71-1192,0,16399,arthur_leeds,,566.97,577.484,"Yes, Your Honor, the Florida statute of course has been subject of course the roofing of this Court but has been declared to be unconstitutional by which it is almost identical statute."
1972.71-1192,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,577.484,579.616,"Tennessee, New York, and California?"
1972.71-1192,0,16399,arthur_leeds,,579.616,586.549,"Yes Your Honor, they already spent -- some other States too, I am not in position to say how important any of the record industry in those States."
1972.71-1192,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,586.852,593.989,And argues that basically the same laws is the one that is involve in this case or --
1972.71-1192,0,16399,arthur_leeds,,593.989,599.255,Basically the same law that Tennessee with be the one distinction -- the other laws I believe make it a misdemeanor.
1972.71-1192,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,602.616,604.103,But they are all Criminal laws?
1972.71-1192,0,16399,arthur_leeds,,604.103,606.852,"They are all Criminal law, yes Your Honor."
1972.71-1192,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,671.593,699.962,It is unconstitutional for a State to declare that it is unfair competition when a stranger simply copies a recording made by a major company after that other company has engaged the artist perhaps paid a musician to work out the arrangement and hired the equipment and done all the work necessary to produce that recording.
1972.71-1192,0,16399,arthur_leeds,,711.819,715.538,"Yes Your Honor, I most definitely saying that I think that is what this Court has said repeatedly."
1972.71-1192,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,744.415,751.472,Does the new Act contain the same kind compulsory provision as the maintained Line Act?
1972.71-1192,0,16399,arthur_leeds,,751.472,754.125,It does whit respect to the composer's rights.
1972.71-1192,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,754.125,770.273,"Well, on to composer's -- clarify this for me, are the composers' rights protected by having the copier paid the two cents per record to the master recording company and then the master recording company must account to the artists?"
1972.71-1192,0,16399,arthur_leeds,,770.273,771.715,That is not the way it works Your Honor.
1972.71-1192,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,771.809,772.882,Under the new Act?
1972.71-1192,0,16399,arthur_leeds,,772.882,779.854,"Under -- oth the old Act and the new Act, the payment must be made according to statute directly to the copyright proprietor."
1972.71-1192,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,825.283,827.482,"You are involved in this before, have we?"
1972.71-1192,0,16399,arthur_leeds,,827.482,828.246,Your Honor --
1972.71-1192,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,828.246,829.637,-- but it's not anywhere from patents?
1972.71-1192,0,16399,arthur_leeds,,829.637,836.584,"Yes, but Mr. Justice Black and his opinion in both cases especially in the counter case specifically referred to the --"
1972.71-1192,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,836.584,837.045,I understand.
1972.71-1192,0,16399,arthur_leeds,,837.045,838.702,-- copyright protections.
1972.71-1192,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,838.702,841.852,The Sears case of copying of the lamp of some kind?
1972.71-1192,0,16399,arthur_leeds,,841.852,843.019,Yes it was Your Honor.
1972.71-1192,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,908.163,915.953,"Mr. Leeds, the Chief Justice more had asked you up certain statute action be unconstitutional, you said yes it would."
1972.71-1192,0,16399,arthur_leeds,,930.896,934.032,I think it would be unconstitutional under both clauses Your Honor.
1972.71-1192,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1069.969,1089.221,"Well, could I ask you to clarify this, say a sound recording was made prior to the day of the new Act, then comes along the new Act, and the person who made that sound recording then wants to take advantage of the federal law, for the old recording, may he?"
1972.71-1192,0,16399,arthur_leeds,,1089.221,1090.754,"I believe he may, Your Honor."
1972.71-1192,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1110.017,1113.029,"Well , so you are saying that he may not take it."
1972.71-1192,0,16399,arthur_leeds,,1117.128,1119.047,"Well, I am not certain on what you mean by “taking advantage of”."
1972.71-1192,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1122.816,1128.706,"After them, from the person who own -- who made the recording may not seek the protection of the federal law."
1972.71-1192,0,16399,arthur_leeds,,1128.706,1134.615,"Not with respect to recordings fixed or published prior to February 15, 1972."
1972.71-1192,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1135.991,1138.016,"Because he has already did indicate it, don't you think?"
1972.71-1192,0,16399,arthur_leeds,,1138.016,1139.741,Because he has already did indicate it.
1972.71-1192,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1159.115,1165.252,"I just want the -- you don't need to argue, and I just wanted to know what your opinion is or what the fact was."
1972.71-1192,0,16399,arthur_leeds,,1165.252,1165.547,Thank you.
1972.71-1192,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1167.335,1176.652,"State laws kind of a long, statutes and statutory law involving unfair competition that their --"
1972.71-1192,0,16399,arthur_leeds,,1176.652,1177.231,"Yes Your Honor, I think the --"
1972.71-1192,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1177.231,1180.8,It is not something like coming off in deception.
1972.71-1192,0,16399,arthur_leeds,,1180.8,1182.384,That is exactly correct Your Honor.
1972.71-1192,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1382.571,1404.275,Are you saying then -- that the only way recording companies can be protected is to get what they have been trying to get is have Congress authorize the copyrighting of a recording as such as distinguished from the material that's being recorded.
1972.71-1192,0,16399,arthur_leeds,,1404.275,1412.666,"Yes Your Honor, I am suggesting that and I think it -- as I say it is, the only way we can be assured of two things, one, a uniform national copyright law."
1972.71-1192,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1539.827,1544.834,Very well Mr. Leeds.
1972.71-1192,1,21581,david_m_schacter,,1546.901,1548.198,Thank you Your Honor.
1972.71-1192,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1753.483,1762.503,It's not even the pirate as you call him is -- is obligated to pay the artist two cents per use?
1972.71-1192,1,21581,david_m_schacter,,1762.503,1763.983,No.
1972.71-1192,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1769.553,1771.381,-- taking about his obligation --
1972.71-1192,1,21581,david_m_schacter,,1771.381,1781.456,"Here's the only obligation, prior to 1972, was to pay two cents for each cup or side or composition."
1972.71-1192,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1789.873,1793.845,"So, the answer to my question is yes."
1972.71-1192,1,21581,david_m_schacter,,1793.845,1795.92,"He doesn't pay the artist, no."
1972.71-1192,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1795.92,1797.472,The -- the composer.
1972.71-1192,1,21581,david_m_schacter,,1797.472,1798.886,"The composer, yes, Your Honor."
1972.71-1192,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1802.64,1804.163,"Well, it's an old orchestration --"
1972.71-1192,1,21581,david_m_schacter,,1804.163,1805.545,"The whole orchestration, right."
1972.71-1192,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1805.545,1808.25,But the composers --
1972.71-1192,1,21581,david_m_schacter,,1808.25,1809.187,"The composer, correct."
1972.71-1192,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1809.187,1810.744,"So, the answer to that question is yes."
1972.71-1192,1,21581,david_m_schacter,,1810.744,1811.75,Yes.
1972.71-1192,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1856.43,1867.393,I suppose there are other times that usually these to take your term pirates do not make a copy of a recording and public gets into the top 10 or something of that kind.
1972.71-1192,1,21581,david_m_schacter,,1888.992,1902.263,"Well, the second part of the California statute states that it is also a crime in California to sell these (Inaudible) performances without the consent of the owner."
1972.71-1192,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1902.263,1903.861,"So, they couldn't be sold in California?"
1972.71-1192,1,21581,david_m_schacter,,1903.861,1905.399,They couldn't be sold in California.
1972.71-1192,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1905.399,1908.448,Could they be sold in the 40 states that don't have such statutes?
1972.71-1192,1,21581,david_m_schacter,,1908.448,1927.595,"I think in the 40 states, they do not have such statutes depending on how this Court decides what protection will be afforded to these performers prior to February 15, 1972.Those states were probably used unfair competition or some civil litigation."
1972.71-1192,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1940.099,1947.524,Is California's basis unfair competition or patent or copyright?
1972.71-1192,1,21581,david_m_schacter,,1947.524,1954.225,In the basis of this statute is 653h.
1972.71-1192,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1974.77,1981.591,But you listed among the things that they went through all of this trouble pressing the record and all.
1972.71-1192,1,21581,david_m_schacter,,1983.994,1984.516,"No, they have no --"
1972.71-1192,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1984.516,1987.728,(Inaudible) copyright of pressing of the record.
1972.71-1192,1,21581,david_m_schacter,,1987.728,1992.386,"Well, we're talking about what leads up to the record it show."
1972.71-1192,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1995.852,1998.15,Are you protecting the artist?
1972.71-1192,1,21581,david_m_schacter,,1998.15,2001.893,"We are protecting the artist, the performer, and the unions."
1972.71-1192,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2001.893,2004.129,"And, who else?"
1972.71-1192,1,21581,david_m_schacter,,2004.129,2009.049,All the people that obtained moneys from the sale of a record.
1972.71-1192,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2009.049,2012.392,"Well, that (Inaudible) they pressed the record."
1972.71-1192,1,21581,david_m_schacter,,2012.392,2014.592,"Well, the record company pays him money, yes."
1972.71-1192,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2014.592,2015.929,"And, the promoter?"
1972.71-1192,1,21581,david_m_schacter,,2015.929,2017.837,And the promoter.
1972.71-1192,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2017.837,2021.577,The promoter in New York?
1972.71-1192,1,21581,david_m_schacter,,2025.126,2028.544,We are protecting them since that in the State of California --
1972.71-1192,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2028.544,2032.906,It wouldn't just run if you put too much load on your horse.
1972.71-1192,1,21581,david_m_schacter,,2032.906,2041.624,"Well, in essence, what it is, is we have a property right the same as I have a property right on this watch."
1972.71-1192,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2060.646,2066.538,"But if I make a direct copy of that watch, there's nothing you can do about it, can you?"
1972.71-1192,1,21581,david_m_schacter,,2066.538,2067.405,Well --
1972.71-1192,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2067.405,2071.808,The only person you can think about is the man that made the watch.
1972.71-1192,1,21581,david_m_schacter,,2071.808,2072.292,No.
1972.71-1192,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2072.292,2074.949,"Well, here would be the composer."
1972.71-1192,1,21581,david_m_schacter,,2074.949,2076.158,"No, Your Honor because --"
1972.71-1192,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2076.158,2077.842,Want to start on something else?
1972.71-1192,1,21581,david_m_schacter,,2077.842,2079.047,No.
1972.71-1192,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2100.619,2107.094,I would think that you could get a patent on that.
1972.71-1192,1,21581,david_m_schacter,,2107.094,2130.264,"Well, the problem is, first, the difference between copyrighting in pen and the idea of unfair competition in the essence of a -- of what we call a bootleg tape we have put if it is allowed that these tapes would exist, we have put the performer and we are forgetting now the composer."
1972.71-1192,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2146.532,2153.722,When he get paid for singing and doesn't get paid of royalty?
1972.71-1192,1,21581,david_m_schacter,,2153.722,2155.02,"Well, in the making --"
1972.71-1192,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2155.02,2156.815,There are some --
1972.71-1192,1,21581,david_m_schacter,,2156.815,2170.698,"Yes, but there is a protection there also because we have the -- let's say the lead singer in an album, he obtains money for the making of the album."
1972.71-1192,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2196.254,2217.07,"But are there some place is where you take the record, the music, you get the artist and you run a band and you go in a place and they make a mass director and you pay one price for that and if you sell 80 million records, they don't get anything more, am I right?"
1972.71-1192,1,21581,david_m_schacter,,2217.07,2218.155,"That's right, you can do that also."
1972.71-1192,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2218.155,2220.746,Trying in protecting them --
1972.71-1192,1,21581,david_m_schacter,,2220.746,2229.707,"Well, that would be an individual only in natural circumstances -- excuse me."
1972.71-1192,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2231.855,2238.188,"If it happens to be Frank Sinatra, he gets such a high price for that one performance that would covers him for the future."
1972.71-1192,1,21581,david_m_schacter,,2243.451,2246.837,"That's also correct but -- absolutely, Your Honor."
1972.71-1192,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2332.939,2341.757,"We want to know if it is clear that prior to 1972, there was no federal protection for the recorder?"
1972.71-1192,1,21581,david_m_schacter,,2341.757,2343.327,For the performance.
1972.71-1192,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2343.327,2346.368,"For the performance, and why not?"
1972.71-1192,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2346.368,2349.036,Because the courts had rule and was covered by the Copyright Act.
1972.71-1192,1,21581,david_m_schacter,,2349.036,2350.738,"Well, no."
1972.71-1192,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2365.482,2367.532,Had been made or to -- or suggested?
1972.71-1192,1,21581,david_m_schacter,,2367.532,2369.479,"Had been suggested, I'm sorry."
1972.71-1192,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2380.739,2390.329,"But under the original Copyright Act the courts have decided that no protection was -- was intended, is that it?"
1972.71-1192,1,21581,david_m_schacter,,2397.003,2414.41,"I think it was more -- as we stated in our briefs, not needed at that time because the proprietors of the -- whatever not needed that when the -- I supposed there was a clue made sooner or later under the original Copyright Act."
1972.71-1192,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2414.41,2416.97,For half of the performance?
1972.71-1192,1,21581,david_m_schacter,,2416.97,2419.905,There were attempted claims.
1972.71-1192,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2419.905,2424.867,"Yes, so a court proceedings and constructions of the copy of right act or not?"
1972.71-1192,1,21581,david_m_schacter,,2424.867,2430.351,"No, the Copyright Act -- specifically did not give protection to the performers."
1972.71-1192,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2430.351,2432.076,"Specifically, negative?"
1972.71-1192,1,21581,david_m_schacter,,2432.076,2433.836,It didn't say negative it just wasn't there.
1972.71-1192,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2439.422,2443.967,Then there were repeated request to the Congress that were turned down.
1972.71-1192,1,21581,david_m_schacter,,2443.967,2445.61,The repeated request to Congress --
1972.71-1192,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2445.61,2446.603,Until 1972?
1972.71-1192,1,21581,david_m_schacter,,2446.603,2451.901,"Until 1972, because there is repeated request who were part of a complete revision."
1972.71-1192,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2497.923,2511.586,I -- I thought it might be relevant if to ask whether there had been some knowing deliberate federal decision prior to 1972 not to extend this kind of protection.
1972.71-1192,1,21581,david_m_schacter,,2511.586,2514.428,"No there was not, because he told Congress --"
1972.71-1192,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2514.428,2520.229,The bassis of your argument that there is no federal preemption of this particular segment?
1972.71-1192,1,21581,david_m_schacter,,2520.229,2523.625,"True Your Honor, there is no federal preemption."
1972.71-1192,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2523.625,2529.309,I know the arguments are base on the source and Compco is by not having it.
1972.71-1192,1,21581,david_m_schacter,,2536.534,2544.56,"If I may comment on that Your Honor, it's that in the instance in Compco there is a specific way to obtain the protection."
1972.71-1192,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2560.639,2573.011,Arguably the copyright act should be read as saying that as long as there is protection for the composer that's enough in this whole scheme thing.
1972.71-1192,1,21581,david_m_schacter,,2573.011,2581.438,Absolutely not because it will declare a compete forfeiture of all the performances that have been made prior to 1972.
1972.71-1192,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2581.438,2587.546,You said earlier that nothing in the federal act they protect the form.
1972.71-1192,1,21581,david_m_schacter,,2587.546,2588.42,Correct.
1972.71-1192,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2588.42,2591.262,That was void and the void was filled.
1972.71-1192,1,21581,david_m_schacter,,2593.41,2596.928,No the void restored in 1972 by the federal.
1972.71-1192,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2596.928,2599.035,"Yes, I was speaking before 1972."
1972.71-1192,1,21581,david_m_schacter,,2599.035,2605.813,"Okay, before 1972, the void was filled by common law right."
1972.71-1192,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2612.259,2614.312,And some state statutes like California.
1972.71-1192,1,21581,david_m_schacter,,2614.312,2622.682,And some state statutes like California and within the other states the idea of unfair competition.
1972.71-1192,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2671.21,2682.958,What's your position on the pre-1972 recordings in light of the Federal Act's limitation to 28 years?
1972.71-1192,1,21581,david_m_schacter,,2682.958,2687.527,The unlimited times doctrine?
1972.71-1192,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2716.103,2725.579,"So you are saying the pre-1972 common law copyrights are perpetual or even though, post-1972 recordings are protected only for 28 years."
1972.71-1192,1,21581,david_m_schacter,,2725.579,2739.476,"Yes Your Honor, because until Congress has affirmatively acted, we cannot consider what something would be -- you know, void."
1972.71-1192,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2875.832,2886.803,"What about the taping of one of these artists at a public performance, would 653 prevent the selling of things made from that tape?"
1972.71-1192,1,21581,david_m_schacter,,2886.803,2903.143,"On a public performance, I think we could go specifically back to the common law copyright because on under (Inaudible) a public performance does not dedicate the artist's right."
1972.71-1192,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2903.143,2904.955,Doesn't ASCAP take care of that?
1972.71-1192,1,21581,david_m_schacter,,2904.955,2912.104,"ASCAP, under the separate perhaps contractual relations they could, but we're talking about here is a public performance."
1972.71-1192,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2921.253,2932.591,"So if I tape a public performance of one of this artist and then sell prints that I make off the tape, I don't buy like 653h?"
1972.71-1192,1,21581,david_m_schacter,,2932.591,2938.705,"Not 653h, you would be violating probably under unfair competition and other contractual rights."
1972.71-1192,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2938.705,2940.324,Mr. Schacter.
1972.71-1192,1,21581,david_m_schacter,,2940.324,2940.761,Yes Your Honor.
1972.71-1192,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2940.761,2945.778,I like to get back to the common law and the civil remedies if any?
1972.71-1192,1,21581,david_m_schacter,,2958.374,2964.579,"Well, the performer usually contracts away his rights practically speaking through the record company."
1972.71-1192,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2964.909,2969.219,The record -- could record company then join the piracy you --
1972.71-1192,1,21581,david_m_schacter,,2969.219,2979.748,"It's the record as it was in Capitol Records v. Erickson in California did bring injunctive procedures, this is where there is both civil and criminal remedies."
1972.71-1192,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3097.361,3106.701,"Do you agree that, that after 1972, that the only way to get protection as long as the federal act last is to seek federal protection?"
1972.71-1192,1,21581,david_m_schacter,,3106.701,3112.277,I believe that there are two views that there can be concurrent --
1972.71-1192,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3112.277,3113.037,What is your view?
1972.71-1192,1,21581,david_m_schacter,,3113.037,3113.754,-- protection.
1972.71-1192,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3123.833,3124.579,That would be best.
1972.71-1192,1,21581,david_m_schacter,,3128.494,3131.231,There is separate ability clause in 653h.
1972.71-1192,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3131.231,3134.41,No Canada has the incidents after 1972?
1972.71-1192,1,21581,david_m_schacter,,3134.41,3136.373,I would say no.
1972.71-1192,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3138.247,3151.21,"And at the end of 28 years, is that -- If you have seek federal protection on a recording after set 1972, that if you want protection, you say the only place to get it is under the federal law."
1972.71-1192,1,21581,david_m_schacter,,3160.986,3170.219,"No it will become public domain because in that specific situation, the Congress has then decided as affirmatively used the power to go into the field."
1972.71-1192,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3274.824,3285.563,"If we were arguing a purely equitable case, those arguments would be very precisive at least with me, but we're arguing on a statutory and a constitutional case aren't we?"
1972.71-1192,1,21581,david_m_schacter,,3285.563,3286.473,Yes Your Honor.
1972.71-1192,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3330.622,3347.515,"I don't recall your -- the opposition that you filed in the Petition for Certiorari, but did you raised that point in your opposition that we should stay away from this problem until experienced and accumulated under the 1972 Act?"
1972.71-1192,1,21581,david_m_schacter,,3347.515,3349.414,I don't believe so Your Honor.
1972.71-1192,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3373.919,3376.881,Mr. Leeds you have a few minutes left.
1972.71-1192,2,16399,arthur_leeds,,3376.881,3378.566,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1972.71-1192,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3510.04,3513.027,But you can't do that quite freely can you?
1972.71-1192,2,16399,arthur_leeds,,3513.027,3513.693,Yes you can Your Honor.
1972.71-1192,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3515.568,3517.322,"Well, it's not copyright?"
1972.71-1192,2,16399,arthur_leeds,,3517.322,3520.65,"Exactly Your Honor, and the sound recordings are not copyright."
1972.71-1192,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3543.071,3548.52,"But you can copy the Rembrandt only with the permission of the owner, is that right?"
1972.71-1192,2,16399,arthur_leeds,,3548.52,3549.461,No Your Honor.
1972.71-1192,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3549.461,3556.818,I will copy and you go down and take the photograph of something in the National Gallery of Art except by their leave.
1972.71-1192,2,16399,arthur_leeds,,3556.818,3559.935,I -- I think I now see the point Your Honor is writing it.
1972.71-1192,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3563.102,3563.395,Right.
1972.71-1192,2,16399,arthur_leeds,,3563.395,3568.614,-- Rembrandt as opposed to the rights which in (Inaudible) rights which deal with the copy.
1972.71-1192,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3568.614,3575.706,"But the National Gallery could charge if they wanted to, $100 for every person taking a photograph or $1?"
1972.71-1192,2,16399,arthur_leeds,,3575.706,3578.757,"They could absolutely could, and that's exactly what the sound recording industry does."
1972.71-1192,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3587.072,3591.863,"In selling that, is there anyway they could put limitation on copying it?"
1972.71-1192,2,16399,arthur_leeds,,3591.863,3593.782,That was attempted Your Honor.
1972.71-1192,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3684.914,3685.644,Thank you gentlemen.
