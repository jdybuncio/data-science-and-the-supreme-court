1999.98-1152,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.777,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Number 98-1152, Food and Drug Administration v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corporation."
1999.98-1152,1,38892,richard_m_cooper,,1686.163,1689.656,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1999.98-1152,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1744.522,1745.16,But only if there's an intent.
1999.98-1152,1,38892,richard_m_cooper,,1746.142,1746.743,"Yes, has to...  yes."
1999.98-1152,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1748.552,1749.914,And isn't that the key question in the case?
1999.98-1152,1,38892,richard_m_cooper,,1749.914,1750.115,Yes.
1999.98-1152,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1752.276,1753.438,But would you concede there is an intent?
1999.98-1152,1,38892,richard_m_cooper,,1753.438,1754.557,I do not...
1999.98-1152,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1754.557,1756.028,Would you lose if you did concede there's an intent?
1999.98-1152,1,38892,richard_m_cooper,,1756.028,1757.097,"No, there's not an intent here."
1999.98-1152,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1757.097,1760.881,"But if you did concede there was an intent, would you not lose?"
1999.98-1152,1,38892,richard_m_cooper,,1760.881,1767.655,"I think not because the...  because, again, the tobacco-specific statutes would preclude FDA jurisdiction."
1999.98-1152,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1767.655,1770.238,So you think there had been a partial repeal of the FDA?
1999.98-1152,1,38892,richard_m_cooper,,1770.238,1770.448,No.
1999.98-1152,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1791.492,1811.554,"Your position, if I understand it, is that although there may have been Chevron play in the joints originally in the statute after there's other legislation which has to be taken into account, step one of Chevron is no longer passed."
1999.98-1152,1,38892,richard_m_cooper,,1811.554,1834.989,"Yes, with an addendum that there are then multiple statutes, most of which are not administered by FDA, so that deference under Chevron would not be appropriate, and even at Chevron step one, before the enactment of the tobacco-specific statutes, we still have the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act not being able to accommodate these products."
1999.98-1152,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1834.989,1836.291,But I still want to know.
1999.98-1152,1,38892,richard_m_cooper,,1840.522,1841.624,They did not amend it.
1999.98-1152,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1841.624,1853.211,"So your basic position is that even if none of those statutes had been passed, you would still not be subject to the statute because you did not have the requisite intent because you didn't advertise the cigarettes as being addictive."
1999.98-1152,1,38892,richard_m_cooper,,1853.211,1854.003,Because when you...
1999.98-1152,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1854.003,1855.174,That's really your basic position.
1999.98-1152,1,38892,richard_m_cooper,,1855.174,1857.014,"Well, there's more...  there...  that...  that's part of our position."
1999.98-1152,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1875.987,1876.247,"Well, but, again, if..."
1999.98-1152,1,38892,richard_m_cooper,,1876.247,1876.437,There's no...
1999.98-1152,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1876.437,1879.39,"that's your basic argument, you don't need all these...  these later statutes."
1999.98-1152,1,38892,richard_m_cooper,,1879.39,1882.742,"We don't need them, but they're very helpful to us."
1999.98-1152,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1882.742,1883.654,"Well, I don't think they're..."
