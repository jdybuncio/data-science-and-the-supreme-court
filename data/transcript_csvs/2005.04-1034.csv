2005.04-1034,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,10.033,We'll hear argument first this morning in Rapanos v. United States and Carabell v. the United States Army Corps of Engineers.
2005.04-1034,0,36044,m_reed_hopper,,11.924,14.783,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
2005.04-1034,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,59.59,61.826,It goes somewhat beyond the smallest trickle?
2005.04-1034,0,36044,m_reed_hopper,,68.859,70.406,"Yes, Your Honor."
2005.04-1034,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,107.319,112.696,So where would you... where would... where would you put the line?
2005.04-1034,0,36044,m_reed_hopper,,112.696,116.243,"I'd put the line where Congress put the line, Your Honor."
2005.04-1034,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,143.202,148.766,But then... but you were... you are including at least wetlands that abut--
2005.04-1034,0,36044,m_reed_hopper,,148.766,150.282,--Yes.
2005.04-1034,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,150.282,151.047,--navigable water.
2005.04-1034,0,36044,m_reed_hopper,,151.047,151.282,Yes.
2005.04-1034,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,156.017,159.254,What about major tributaries?
2005.04-1034,0,36044,m_reed_hopper,,159.254,164.254,Congress cannot regulate all tributaries.
2005.04-1034,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,167.317,167.692,Which ones?
2005.04-1034,0,36044,m_reed_hopper,,167.692,169.646,--but would have to do so on a case-by-case basis.
2005.04-1034,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,188.931,192.557,"Well, is your position no tributaries or some tributaries?"
2005.04-1034,0,36044,m_reed_hopper,,192.557,200.7,"The... the act, by its terms, does not recognize the... the regulation of any tributary."
2005.04-1034,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,201.433,214.859,"Does it make sense to say that any wetlands that it abuts a traditionally navigable water is covered, but a tributary that leads right into a traditionally navigable water is not necessarily covered?"
2005.04-1034,0,36044,m_reed_hopper,,214.859,229.972,--I think... I think it's fair to say that under this Court's determination in Solid Waste Agency that the only wetlands that are covered are those that are abutting and inseparably bound up.
2005.04-1034,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,240.552,242.77,"Yes, but they're doing it for a functional reason."
2005.04-1034,0,36044,m_reed_hopper,,281.373,295.439,"The reason that logic does not apply, Your Honor, is because the regulation of... of tributaries raises significant constitutional questions that are not implicated by the regulation of a wetland inseparably--"
2005.04-1034,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,295.439,315.458,Then... then you have to accept the fact that... that Congress cannot effectively regulate the navigable... the... the condition of the navigable water itself because if all the... the... let's... let's assume there's a class of... of evil polluters out there who just want to wreck the... the navigable waters of the United States.
2005.04-1034,0,36044,m_reed_hopper,,325.055,327.414,"--That's incorrect, Your Honor."
2005.04-1034,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,336.682,347.481,"So you're... you're going to... you... you then want to draw a distinction between the dredge and fill addition and, let's say, a... a conventional synthetic poison."
2005.04-1034,0,36044,m_reed_hopper,,347.481,348.449,No.
2005.04-1034,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,361.86,378.456,"You mean on... on... in every... in every case then, I mean, Congress would have to... I'm sorry... a scientist would have to analyze the molecules and... and trace them up, and so long as they could... could trace it to a specific discharge, they could get at it, but otherwise they couldn't?"
2005.04-1034,0,36044,m_reed_hopper,,383.161,385.302,"I don't... I don't believe it would, Your Honor."
2005.04-1034,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,392.382,398.696,"Well, I... couldn't you simply assume that anything that is discharged into a tributary ultimately goes where the tributary goes?"
2005.04-1034,0,36044,m_reed_hopper,,402.509,404.993,"--Well, it certainly wasn't true in this case, Your Honor."
2005.04-1034,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,405.369,413.792,So you don't think it would be enough for the... for the Government to prove the discharge into a tributary in order to prove that the act has been violated.
2005.04-1034,0,36044,m_reed_hopper,,413.792,414.683,"--No, Your Honor, I do not."
2005.04-1034,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,414.683,416.7,You really think it has to trace the molecules.
2005.04-1034,0,36044,m_reed_hopper,,416.7,417.2,Absolutely.
2005.04-1034,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,419.809,422.419,How do you... how do you define a tributary?
2005.04-1034,0,36044,m_reed_hopper,,422.419,433.062,"Well, the... that's one of the problems here, Your Honor, is that... is that the agency has... has established a moving target for... for tributaries."
2005.04-1034,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,433.062,433.812,So what's your definition?
2005.04-1034,0,36044,m_reed_hopper,,433.812,442.939,"Well, the... the definitions we're working with here, to which we object, is that... is that it includes anything in the hydrological connection."
2005.04-1034,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,442.939,445.549,"I know what you object to, and I know that you think your client isn't covered."
2005.04-1034,0,36044,m_reed_hopper,,450.925,458.224,"Well, we're suggesting that... that this Court need not define tributary because under the act all tributaries are excluded."
2005.04-1034,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,462.537,463.803,"Well, okay, but we still don't know what you're excluding."
2005.04-1034,0,36044,m_reed_hopper,,468.414,484.855,"--Those... anything that is not of a... anything does not constitute the channel, the traditional navigable water, and anything not abutting as a... as a inseparably bound up wetland would constitute a tributary."
2005.04-1034,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,484.855,490.731,"Well, it... it seems to me that what works in your favor is... is it SWANCC?"
2005.04-1034,0,36044,m_reed_hopper,,492.685,492.982,Yes.
2005.04-1034,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,492.982,498.03,The Migratory Bird Rule case where we said there had to be a significant nexus.
2005.04-1034,0,36044,m_reed_hopper,,517.784,519.691,"Well, this Court did not--"
2005.04-1034,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,519.691,521.472,And it seems to me that that's what you're asking us to do here.
2005.04-1034,0,36044,m_reed_hopper,,521.472,531.755,--This Court did not suggest in... in SWANCC that a significant nexus constitutes the jurisdictional standard for all... for all waters.
2005.04-1034,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,555.792,568.951,"From everything... from everything you said, it sounds like you're... you're taking issue with Riverside Bayview because if a wetland adjacent to the river counts, then why not a stream that goes right into it?"
2005.04-1034,0,36044,m_reed_hopper,,571.607,591.799,"--It makes perfect sense, Your Honor, because the regulation of those tributaries and streams, all of them in the entire tributary system, raise significant constitutional questions that are not implicated by regulating wetlands that are inseparably bound up with traditional navigable water."
2005.04-1034,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,591.799,592.332,"More than that, Mr. Hopper."
2005.04-1034,0,36044,m_reed_hopper,,636.027,636.918,That's right.
2005.04-1034,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,636.918,637.653,I thought that was our basis.
2005.04-1034,0,36044,m_reed_hopper,,637.653,638.559,That's exactly right.
2005.04-1034,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,638.559,640.624,"And, of course, that basis doesn't apply to tributaries, does it?"
2005.04-1034,0,36044,m_reed_hopper,,645.109,646.921,"I think that's correct, Your Honor."
2005.04-1034,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,646.921,662.049,You think that's correct about what the Court said in Bayview when it phrased the question as before discharging fill material into wetlands adjacent to navigable bodies of water and their tributaries.
2005.04-1034,0,36044,m_reed_hopper,,665.612,667.41,"The Court did frame the question that way, Your Honor."
2005.04-1034,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,677.631,689.43,"At any rate, they could not have been making the distinction Justice Scalia suggested if, at least in the Court's thinking, the tributaries rolled right into the navigable body."
2005.04-1034,0,36044,m_reed_hopper,,689.43,704.605,"Well, as I said, the... the Court's commentary in Riverside Bayview is not good law because the... the Court was not addressing the... a tributary's question in that case, and it was not faced with a Commerce Clause challenge as it is in this case."
2005.04-1034,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,713.498,736.972,"Yes, but doesn't the reference to tributary make it relatively plain that what the Court was getting at was the impossibility of drawing a functional distinction between wetlands and tributaries on the one hand, navigable waters on the other, when the purpose of the regulation is to protect the purity of the ultimate navigable water?"
2005.04-1034,0,36044,m_reed_hopper,,765.807,766.135,"I don't believe so, Your Honor."
2005.04-1034,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,806.815,813.801,"Well, it's... except for the... it seems to me except for... for your... your argument is... is fine except for one problem."
2005.04-1034,0,36044,m_reed_hopper,,845.213,848.62,"I don't think it's difficult to believe that at all, Your Honor."
2005.04-1034,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,913.525,921.887,"But if... but your... but your answer earlier to Justice Souter's earlier question was that if you dump the pollutants anywhere and they make their way to the navigable water, you're covered."
2005.04-1034,0,36044,m_reed_hopper,,922.637,924.638,Are covered if they make it... their way all the way there.
2005.04-1034,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,937.14,939.281,"Thank you, counsel."
2005.04-1034,1,43364,timothy_a_stoepker,,947.767,999.216,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court: After years of review by the State of Michigan and the respondent, the record is very clear. Petitioners' wetland is hydrologically isolated from any navigable water of the United States. Further, the State of Michigan, exercising the power specifically and traditionally reserved to it, undertook responsibility to regulate the waters at issue and pollution and, in doing so, issued petitioner a wetland permit. It is clear from the record in this case that there is no hydrological connection between the petitioners' wetland and navigable waters of the United States. Referring to the appendix filed, the joint appendix filed in this case, specifically beginning with the EPA letters dating back to 1994, as this property has been under years of review, [*15] do not reference any such connection."
2005.04-1034,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,999.216,1003.311,Did we talk about a hydrological connection in Riverside Bayview?
2005.04-1034,1,43364,timothy_a_stoepker,,1003.311,1013.609,"The... the connection there was... in essence, yes, Your Honor, based upon the inseparable, bound-up nature of those wetlands which were immediately adjacent to the navigable water."
2005.04-1034,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1022.033,1024.877,I'm not sure what you mean by a hydrological connection.
2005.04-1034,1,43364,timothy_a_stoepker,,1042.428,1046.882,"In... in this case, Your Honor, there was no connection at all."
2005.04-1034,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1053.743,1056.354,Water never ran off of this... of this land.
2005.04-1034,1,43364,timothy_a_stoepker,,1056.354,1056.588,--No.
2005.04-1034,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1068.746,1081.264,"Well, do they have to make this on a plot-by-plot basis, or can they make a categorical judgment that even in cases in which, you know, there's a berm, as there is here, when the water is high, it spills over?"
2005.04-1034,1,43364,timothy_a_stoepker,,1089.032,1089.845,Yes.
2005.04-1034,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1091.783,1092.908,Where do you get that exception?
2005.04-1034,1,43364,timothy_a_stoepker,,1092.908,1101.769,"--In the respondents' brief on page 18, they acknowledge that the traditional test has been hydrological connection, that that's what they have looked towards."
2005.04-1034,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1101.769,1107.739,"And the... and the... but I mean, what I'm getting at is the traditional test is the basis for a categorical judgment."
2005.04-1034,1,43364,timothy_a_stoepker,,1136.214,1140.247,"Under the act, it talks about the issue of discharge."
2005.04-1034,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1159.563,1168.517,So... so your... maybe what you're saying is we have shown or the record shows that this doesn't fit within the category because it never spills over or whatever.
2005.04-1034,1,43364,timothy_a_stoepker,,1169.768,1170.909,That is correct.
2005.04-1034,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1178.473,1178.973,Am I correct--
2005.04-1034,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1178.973,1185.912,"But, Mr. Stoepker, your friend, Mr. Hopper, would certainly not agree with you that... that a... a hydrological connection is the, quote, traditional test."
2005.04-1034,1,43364,timothy_a_stoepker,,1189.257,1191.008,Our definition--
2005.04-1034,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1191.008,1195.649,How long has this test been established?
2005.04-1034,1,43364,timothy_a_stoepker,,1195.649,1204.854,"--If you look at respondents' brief in their arguments to this Court, they first state, page 18, that in fact traditionally they've looked at hydrological connection."
2005.04-1034,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1205.713,1206.792,Traditionally.
2005.04-1034,1,43364,timothy_a_stoepker,,1206.792,1207.245,--Traditionally.
2005.04-1034,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1207.245,1207.62,Yes--
2005.04-1034,1,43364,timothy_a_stoepker,,1207.62,1208.949,From the inception of the rules.
2005.04-1034,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1208.949,1211.277,--From the inception of the rules.
2005.04-1034,1,43364,timothy_a_stoepker,,1211.277,1213.513,"Inception of the rules, that they have looked at hydrological connection."
2005.04-1034,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1213.513,1214.403,That that alone has been enough.
2005.04-1034,1,43364,timothy_a_stoepker,,1214.403,1215.904,No.
2005.04-1034,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1230.531,1230.859,I see.
2005.04-1034,1,43364,timothy_a_stoepker,,1240.893,1242.238,"We're... that is correct, Your Honor."
2005.04-1034,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1242.238,1242.972,Okay.
2005.04-1034,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1242.972,1244.378,Can I get back to the question earlier?
2005.04-1034,1,43364,timothy_a_stoepker,,1261.319,1261.663,"Yes, Your Honor."
2005.04-1034,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1262.163,1263.132,Yes?
2005.04-1034,1,43364,timothy_a_stoepker,,1263.132,1267.961,"--Mr. Chief Justice, in... in response to that question, both potentially."
2005.04-1034,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1277.042,1281.511,"Was it... was it also clear that after the improvement, there would be no drainage?"
2005.04-1034,1,43364,timothy_a_stoepker,,1281.511,1285.543,"--After the improvement, there could be drainage."
2005.04-1034,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1294.014,1296.545,--May I just ask one clarifying question?
2005.04-1034,1,43364,timothy_a_stoepker,,1300.843,1304.298,It was found that there was not a connection.
2005.04-1034,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1304.298,1304.579,It was.
2005.04-1034,1,43364,timothy_a_stoepker,,1305.595,1315.378,"If you... referring the Court to the respondents' report dated May 5th of 2000, it specifically states--"
2005.04-1034,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1315.378,1316.597,Where are you reading from?
2005.04-1034,1,43364,timothy_a_stoepker,,1316.597,1319.176,--This is from appendix page 81 and 83.
2005.04-1034,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1322.817,1323.301,Right.
2005.04-1034,1,43364,timothy_a_stoepker,,1323.301,1327.365,It notes a number of issues or classifications there or points.
2005.04-1034,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1352.808,1354.214,I'm sorry.
2005.04-1034,1,43364,timothy_a_stoepker,,1362.278,1365.373,--They do not reference a... I'm... this--
2005.04-1034,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1365.373,1366.702,They don't find a--
2005.04-1034,1,43364,timothy_a_stoepker,,1366.702,1367.061,--Right.
2005.04-1034,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1367.546,1368.374,--I agree with that.
2005.04-1034,1,43364,timothy_a_stoepker,,1372.141,1375.313,"Yes, they make that in a subsequent report."

2005.04-1034,1,43364,timothy_a_stoepker,,1376.798,1378.033,Not... not in this first report.
2005.04-1034,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1378.033,1380.737,Is the report in the... is the subsequent report in the record somewhere?
2005.04-1034,1,43364,timothy_a_stoepker,,1380.737,1381.049,Yes.
2005.04-1034,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1385.535,1386.409,"And again, where--"
2005.04-1034,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1386.409,1387.237,What page are you on?
2005.04-1034,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1387.237,1387.456,--Where are you?
2005.04-1034,1,43364,timothy_a_stoepker,,1387.456,1389.457,--I'm going to refer you to the specific pages.
2005.04-1034,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1465.443,1469.568,Then what was the reason they gave for rejecting the permit?
2005.04-1034,1,43364,timothy_a_stoepker,,1469.568,1479.461,"The... the sole reason claimed for jurisdiction at the agency hearing was adjacency to this non-navigable, unnamed ditch, which was dug by the county for a sewer system."
2005.04-1034,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1486.54,1487.213,I'm--
2005.04-1034,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1487.213,1487.478,Suppose--
2005.04-1034,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1487.478,1492.777,"--I'm still not clear as to what the findings were, if there were findings, as to what the condition would be after the improvement."
2005.04-1034,1,43364,timothy_a_stoepker,,1497.309,1500.919,The... it... it could occur in two different ways.
2005.04-1034,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1500.919,1504.669,"And... and if that were so, would that be sufficient for jurisdiction?"
2005.04-1034,1,43364,timothy_a_stoepker,,1504.669,1514.781,"They... that... that was not their finding because in this case they actually recommended, whether or not anything occurred on the property, that the berms or barriers be removed."
2005.04-1034,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1519.422,1521.517,"But, well... suppose the interaction were automatic."
2005.04-1034,1,43364,timothy_a_stoepker,,1525.315,1536.645,It... it is our position in this case no because the ditch next to the site has not been regulated under the rules adopted by the respondent and... nor under the statute adopted by Congress.
2005.04-1034,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1568.512,1573.466,"Counsel, what... what is the test that you would have us adopt for a significant nexus?"
2005.04-1034,1,43364,timothy_a_stoepker,,1573.466,1587.312,"--Our... our test for significant nexus would start with the... the basis that there must be an established, existing hydrological connection between the wetland and the body of water adjacent--"
2005.04-1034,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1587.312,1591.486,"By that, you mean either a ditch or underground seepage?"
2005.04-1034,1,43364,timothy_a_stoepker,,1591.486,1593.08,--Yes.
2005.04-1034,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1593.08,1593.658,Okay.
2005.04-1034,1,43364,timothy_a_stoepker,,1598.581,1600.347,Based--
2005.04-1034,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1600.347,1601.816,"Mr. Hopper won't like that, but for--"
2005.04-1034,1,43364,timothy_a_stoepker,,1601.816,1602.176,--No.
2005.04-1034,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1612.756,1616.678,"Well, you don't... you don't have to define what... everything that's necessary."
2005.04-1034,1,43364,timothy_a_stoepker,,1627.197,1627.681,--That is correct.
2005.04-1034,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1627.681,1628.462,--there may be.
2005.04-1034,1,43364,timothy_a_stoepker,,1630.994,1632.541,We're--
2005.04-1034,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1632.541,1633.682,You... you just haven't reached that point.
2005.04-1034,1,43364,timothy_a_stoepker,,1634.135,1636.683,--We don't... we do not believe that this case needs to reach that--
2005.04-1034,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1636.683,1637.511,But I'm still puzzled--
2005.04-1034,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1637.511,1638.902,I don't want to set you two to fighting with each other.
2005.04-1034,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1638.902,1639.074,--by your answer to Justice--
2005.04-1034,1,43364,timothy_a_stoepker,,1648.81,1659.172,"--At that point, then maybe the respondent could determine there would be some form of regulation if, in fact, the discharge was into a ditch that was, in fact, regulated."
2005.04-1034,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1659.594,1669.815,"But it... would it be a sufficient reason to deny a permit based on the judgment that after the project is completed, there will be a... a hydrological connection?"
2005.04-1034,1,43364,timothy_a_stoepker,,1669.815,1676.441,"--The test is from the outset, Your Honor."
2005.04-1034,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1676.441,1676.644,No.
2005.04-1034,1,43364,timothy_a_stoepker,,1678.176,1678.442,Yes.
2005.04-1034,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1678.879,1679.77,Perhaps you don't want to but--
2005.04-1034,1,43364,timothy_a_stoepker,,1680.379,1687.225,The... the resulting impact... I would say no.
2005.04-1034,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1689.992,1697.587,"But isn't it sort of foolish to say that we're concerned about pollution, but only if you... only if you catch it in advance?"
2005.04-1034,1,43364,timothy_a_stoepker,,1706.51,1713.73,The application for the permit does not automatically equate to a request to discharge.
2005.04-1034,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1717.684,1724.952,"No, but my hypothesis is that we know it would happen, or they... they would find it would happen after the project is completed."
2005.04-1034,1,43364,timothy_a_stoepker,,1731.906,1744.644,"This Court's test in SWANCC is based upon the before, and also based upon Riverside, it examined the before condition and the impact on that navigable water."
2005.04-1034,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1771.259,1777.495,"What we're talking about here is... is at... at most, whether this is a water of the United States."
2005.04-1034,1,43364,timothy_a_stoepker,,1784.762,1785.434,That is correct.
2005.04-1034,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1785.434,1788.623,"And it either is or it isn't, not... not that it will be."
2005.04-1034,1,43364,timothy_a_stoepker,,1792.592,1794.123,That is correct.
2005.04-1034,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1794.123,1800.953,And Justice Stevens' question I think in... in that framework is... is this.
2005.04-1034,1,43364,timothy_a_stoepker,,1808.47,1814.143,"Under the Court's definition in SWANCC and Riverside, the answer again is no."
2005.04-1034,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1814.143,1819.051,Then... then Congress has passed a statute that says we'll lock the barn after the horse is stolen.
2005.04-1034,1,43364,timothy_a_stoepker,,1824.458,1835.132,"It did not do so, Your Honor, because specifically under section 1251(b), it reserved to the States the primary responsibility of regulating pollution within its waters."
2005.04-1034,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1851.089,1863.435,"Well, it... it would do so in... in cases of... I guess, of the... the sorts of... of new proposed actions that require the... the Corps to get into it in the first place."
2005.04-1034,1,43364,timothy_a_stoepker,,1871.78,1876.031,"In this case, it actually... the decision of the respondent did displace the State."
2005.04-1034,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1960.924,1964.112,And the only reason it's a water of the United States is that there are some puddles on this land.
2005.04-1034,1,43364,timothy_a_stoepker,,1969.692,1972.989,"--That's correct, because there's some puddles on the land occasionally."
2005.04-1034,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1972.989,1988.429,"So it... it becomes waters of the United States because there are puddles on it, and you assert because those puddles have some hydrological connection or if it is... if it is water of the United States, those puddles have some hydrological connections with the navigable waters."
2005.04-1034,1,43364,timothy_a_stoepker,,1988.429,1996.48,"To... to be waters of the United States, they would have to have a hydrological connection as a minimum test to be a part of the waters of the United States."
2005.04-1034,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1996.48,2012.451,"And... and the... the statute only prohibits the discharge of dredged or fill material, which is what is going on here, into the navigable waters, right, at specified disposal sites."
2005.04-1034,1,43364,timothy_a_stoepker,,2016.623,2017.796,That is correct.
2005.04-1034,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2017.796,2023.375,"--permit discharge into waters, not... not into lands that aren't waters."
2005.04-1034,1,43364,timothy_a_stoepker,,2023.375,2023.75,No.
2005.04-1034,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2072.386,2077.512,--May I ask one question about your... your not... no hydrological connection?
2005.04-1034,1,43364,timothy_a_stoepker,,2095.86,2098.438,"--In this case, there are two things."
2005.04-1034,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2111.269,2121.756,"So it could... there could be a situation where the wetlands would be right next to the river, but there's a berm in between, and that would break the hydrological connection?"
2005.04-1034,1,43364,timothy_a_stoepker,,2121.756,2123.351,It would break the hydrological connection.
2005.04-1034,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2145.745,2149.214,Do you think it... do you think it meant adjacent with a berm in between?
2005.04-1034,1,43364,timothy_a_stoepker,,2159.263,2162.718,"--In reading the opinion... Your Honor, my time is up."
2005.04-1034,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2162.718,2164.031,--You may respond briefly.
2005.04-1034,1,43364,timothy_a_stoepker,,2164.031,2164.859,Yes.
2005.04-1034,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2176.08,2177.049,"Thank you, counsel."
2005.04-1034,1,43364,timothy_a_stoepker,,2177.049,2177.908,Thank you.
2005.04-1034,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2177.908,2183.91,General Clement.
2005.04-1034,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2183.91,2186.489,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2005.04-1034,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2214.728,2216.651,How do you define tributary?
2005.04-1034,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2216.651,2217.776,Mr. Chief--
2005.04-1034,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2217.776,2221.089,The tributary... you say they're adjacent to a nonnavigable tributary.
2005.04-1034,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2223.245,2226.527,"--Well, not in all these cases, Mr. Chief Justice."
2005.04-1034,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2226.527,2227.215,But in the Rapanos' case.
2005.04-1034,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2227.215,2229.387,"No, not... not... that's actually not true."
2005.04-1034,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2250.267,2252.096,What about... what about the other... the other sites?
2005.04-1034,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2252.096,2257.502,--The... the other sites are... are adjacent to man-made ditches that also drain in.
2005.04-1034,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2268.927,2274.147,But your argument assumes that the ditches that go to the other two sites are also tributaries.
2005.04-1034,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2274.147,2275.116,"--Absolutely, Mr. Chief Justice."
2005.04-1034,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2295.058,2295.807,Even when it's not a body of water.
2005.04-1034,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2295.807,2296.698,--Even--
2005.04-1034,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2296.698,2300.433,"A storm drain, even... even when it's not filled with water, is a tributary."
2005.04-1034,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2301.355,2302.965,"--Justice Scalia, absolutely."
2005.04-1034,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2302.965,2303.184,Okay.
2005.04-1034,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2303.184,2309.921,The Corps has not drawn a distinction between man-made channels or ditches and natural channels or ditches.
2005.04-1034,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2314.5,2318.282,I suggest it's very absurd to call that waters of the United States.
2005.04-1034,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2328.096,2329.971,"Well, let me say two things, Justice Scalia."
2005.04-1034,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2366.557,2380.983,"What... what percentage of the... of the territory of the United States do you believe is... is subjected to permits from the Corps of Engineers on your theory whenever you want to move dirt, whenever you want to deposit sand?"
2005.04-1034,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2391.344,2392.454,Well--
2005.04-1034,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2392.454,2399.252,All the water goes down to the sea and there's some kind of a drain or... or a bed that takes the water down there.
2005.04-1034,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2399.252,2404.879,"--Well, I think the precise answer to your question being none of the land mass... none of the land itself would be regulated."
2005.04-1034,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2406.223,2411.52,"You're calling empty ditches... not unless you call empty ditches land, which I do."
2005.04-1034,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2411.52,2413.521,"--Well, the... the Corps doesn't."
2005.04-1034,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2415.022,2415.631,I understand that.
2005.04-1034,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2415.631,2416.803,And that's not the gravamen of the complaint here.
2005.04-1034,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2433.651,2440.184,But... but you... that's just because this statute happens to refer to wetlands.
2005.04-1034,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2467.876,2470.627,"I don't think that's right, Justice Scalia."
2005.04-1034,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2524.81,2532.124,"But in 1899, it just said navigable rivers, not... not every... every tributary defined to include even storm drains."
2005.04-1034,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2532.124,2532.718,--No.
2005.04-1034,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2562.084,2571.305,But your... your theory is there is regulatory authority because there's an interaction between the wetlands or the lands in question and the navigable waters.
2005.04-1034,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2571.305,2573.337,"Justice Kennedy, that's not precisely accurate."
2005.04-1034,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2609.5,2616.017,"Well, but... but wasn't... wasn't the reason for including the adjacent wetlands because of... of the likelihood of an interaction?"
2005.04-1034,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2616.017,2621.535,I think they... they were included for the likelihood of an interaction both hydrologically and otherwise.
2005.04-1034,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2623.722,2625.769,"Well, let... well, please finish."
2005.04-1034,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2625.769,2642.743,"The two points I would make is, first of all, I think the Corps' regulations, which for 30 years have ignored the premise... the... the presence of a berm, are rational because in the vast, vast majority of cases, that berm is not going to prevent a hydrological connection, so to speak."
2005.04-1034,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2666.466,2671.998,"Well... well, as you mention that, you cited subsection (7), and there's a... what struck me anyway as a very interesting provision in there."
2005.04-1034,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2692.393,2702.224,"I... I think, Mr. Chief Justice, my own view is the reason that that caveat is in subsection (7) is actually a vestige of the pre-SWANCC scope of the regulation."
2005.04-1034,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2715.882,2726.995,To me it... it suggests that even the Corps recognized that at some point you've got to say stop because logically any drop of water anywhere is going to have some sort of connection through drainage.
2005.04-1034,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2745.826,2747.952,"--Well, several thoughts on that, Mr. Chief Justice."
2005.04-1034,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2764.722,2773.942,"But that's true of the wetland that is adjacent to the wetland that is adjacent to the tributary, and yet, the Corps says we're not going to reach the wetland that is adjacent to another wetland."
2005.04-1034,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2773.942,2787.586,"--Well, with respect, Mr. Chief Justice, the way that I would read that and the way I understand the Corps reads that is that was really just trying to exclude a wetland adjacent to a wetland that was a water of the United States only because of the application of subsection (3)."
2005.04-1034,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2787.586,2788.211,Your assumption--
2005.04-1034,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2788.211,2789.727,And I think that's... that's supported by the--
2005.04-1034,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2789.727,2792.853,--but this... this is preliminary to my question.
2005.04-1034,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2809.747,2811.622,"--I agree with that, Justice Kennedy."
2005.04-1034,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2811.622,2814.388,"And I... and that's just, it seemed to me, so far been missing from the discussion."
2005.04-1034,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2814.388,2817.045,"Well, and I... I guess there are two ways to look at this."
2005.04-1034,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2881.981,2885.123,"What... what about the Chief Justice's question, wetlands next to wetlands?"
2005.04-1034,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2885.123,2896.047,"--Well, I... I think that... as I said, I think what... what the definition meant to get at was to exclude wetlands adjacent to isolated wetlands under subsection (3)."
2005.04-1034,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2908.847,2911.472,"Well, but we didn't come up with the idea of wetlands next to wetlands."
2005.04-1034,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2913.675,2914.3,And--
2005.04-1034,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2914.3,2915.536,So what do they mean by it?
2005.04-1034,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2915.536,2922.224,--They meant wetlands adjacent to waters that would otherwise not be in the statute which are isolated wetlands under subsection (3).
2005.04-1034,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2926.459,2931.43,What... what is an example of an insignificant nexus under the SWANCC test?
2005.04-1034,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2931.43,2933.336,Under insignificant nexus?
2005.04-1034,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2936.071,2936.352,No.
2005.04-1034,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2937.149,2938.134,"--Well, no--"
2005.04-1034,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2938.134,2939.025,They're isolated.
2005.04-1034,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2957.341,2974.345,"--I'm leaving out everything that this Court excluded in SWANCC, and I wouldn't have thought that the... that the Court necessarily suggested there was going to be some subset that had a further insignificant nexus because it wasn't... the argument of the Government in those cases was obviously... we didn't just concede that those bodies of water were utterly isolated."
2005.04-1034,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2981.94,2995.74,"So if you have a wetland, you would say a wetland with a hydrological connection to a tributary of navigable waters through one drop a year is a significant nexus to the waters of the United States?"
2005.04-1034,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2995.74,3001.585,"--What I would say, Mr. Chief Justice, is that if the tributary flows in."
2005.04-1034,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3013.822,3014.088,One drop.
2005.04-1034,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,3014.088,3018.651,"--For purposes of the adjacent wetlands, it doesn't look to hydrological connection per se."
2005.04-1034,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3038.468,3038.874,Adjacent to what?
2005.04-1034,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,3040.546,3042.234,"--Adjacent to a tributary, absolutely."
2005.04-1034,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3042.234,3043.501,But... but here's... here's the fly in the ointment.
2005.04-1034,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,3067.428,3073.413,"Well, Justice Scalia, I think if you had in mind a tributary, you'd probably have in mind the Pine River which is at issue in one of these sites."
2005.04-1034,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3077.211,3080.68,Only because I don't know how a storm drain is a water of the United States.
2005.04-1034,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,3096.638,3104.311,"With respect, Justice Scalia, some things that you might classify as a storm drain are actually very deep channels that have a continuous flow of water that were--"
2005.04-1034,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3104.311,3104.436,No.
2005.04-1034,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,3106.702,3107.092,--Well--
2005.04-1034,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3107.405,3107.78,Okay?
2005.04-1034,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,3107.78,3117.126,"But therein is the problem, which is some things that are part of the storm water drainage system of a city are actually things that were previous navigable natural waters."
2005.04-1034,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3118.079,3118.876,And some aren't.
2005.04-1034,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,3122.737,3133.317,"--We would, Justice Scalia, but I guess if we can start with the proposition that tributaries are covered and then some things that the Corps thinks are tributaries you disagree with, that would be fine."
2005.04-1034,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3159.777,3164.027,Am I right that a tributary is not a defined term in the regulations?
2005.04-1034,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,3164.246,3165.074,That's right.
2005.04-1034,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3243.013,3243.638,"Well, but that... but that doesn't follow."
2005.04-1034,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,3271.284,3281.365,"I absolutely agree with you, Justice Scalia, and that's why I'm not up here asking for Federal regulation over non-point source pollution, although that obviously contributes to the... to the problem."
2005.04-1034,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3306.605,3324.593,I don't see how non-point source pollution is... is any more remote from what the Federal Government should be able to do to achieve its ends than is a point source pollution that... that consists of... of dumping sand on land that has some puddles on it.
2005.04-1034,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,3326.829,3337.768,"Well, I think one important thing to focus on, Justice Scalia, is this case is not just about the Corps' 404 program because the 404 program by its terms does not permit anything."
2005.04-1034,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3371.65,3373.213,"Well, that's not really fair."
2005.04-1034,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,3379.371,3382.965,"--That's right, Mr. Chief Justice, but there's only two ways to do that."
2005.04-1034,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3427.803,3438.555,"But the Congress in 1972 also, in its statement of policy, said it's a statement of policy to reserve to the States the power and the responsibility to plan land use and water resources."
2005.04-1034,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,3446.447,3452.245,"With respect, Justice Kennedy, the States still have plenary control over the non-point source pollution."
2005.04-1034,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3489.411,3492.676,Though not necessarily as far as storm drains.
2005.04-1034,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,3502.1,3503.257,"Absolutely, Justice Scalia."
2005.04-1034,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3550.891,3552.659,It's a very vague indication.
2005.04-1034,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,3584.729,3588.338,"Well, I think even you would concede it's a clear statement that something else must be covered."
2005.04-1034,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3684.312,3698.986,Could you just say a word about the... the ditch... sorry... the word about the wetland next to a tributary that's separated by a man-made object like a ditch?
2005.04-1034,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,3716.413,3718.132,--Well--
2005.04-1034,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3718.132,3722.57,Insofar as it seeks to serve a purpose of the statute to regulate this.
2005.04-1034,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,3722.57,3735.151,"--What I would say, Justice Breyer... I... I think I can answer the whole question... is in the vast majority of cases, as I understand it, a berm will not have the effect of actually preventing all hydrological connection."
2005.04-1034,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3735.151,3738.198,And where do I look to verify that scientific matter?
2005.04-1034,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,3738.198,3741.605,I think a number of the amicus briefs have addressed that.
2005.04-1034,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3743.933,3744.168,No.
2005.04-1034,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,3746.576,3748.873,"Oh, again, I didn't mean to suggest a percentage."
2005.04-1034,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3771.002,3771.564,Fine.
2005.04-1034,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,3808.432,3814.715,--What's wrong with what you just said is that wetlands have unique characteristics that are different just from low-lying areas.
2005.04-1034,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3830.562,3831.656,"Okay, I understand that."
2005.04-1034,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,3852.317,3858.943,"And, again, I mean, I would direct you to the amicus briefs that discuss in length the benefits of wetlands, but I understand you won't find those--"
2005.04-1034,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3858.943,3865.116,"I read them, and I... I just perhaps wasn't reading them closely enough, but I just can't find the verification directly there."
2005.04-1034,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,3865.116,3868.898,--And... and I sense that you found them lacking in that sense.
2005.04-1034,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3873.759,3876.369,"Well, what am I supposed to do with the case?"
2005.04-1034,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,3888.888,3894.279,"Well, not surprisingly, I would suggest that you defer to the agency in its exercise of expertise."
2005.04-1034,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3894.279,3895.061,Fine.
2005.04-1034,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,3912.674,3929.239,"Well, you... and you could cite to the proceedings in this very case in the joint appendix because although they didn't use the sponge word, there was a specific finding in this case that these wetlands played an important role in flood control and pollution control for the adjacent streams."
2005.04-1034,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3929.239,3941.93,"And if you wanted a cite for the opposite proposition, you could cite subsection (7) of the Corps' regulations where they have no interest in wetlands that happen to be adjacent to other wetlands that are adjacent to the waters of the United States."
2005.04-1034,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,3951.87,3962.498,"With respect, I don't think that follows because if you read subsection (7), as I do, as only excluding those wetlands that are adjacent to other isolated wetlands, then regulating those wetlands--"
2005.04-1034,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3962.498,3963.764,It doesn't... it doesn't say that.
2005.04-1034,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,3972.468,3980.0,"--Well, and as I said, I think you have to read that in the context not just of the rest of the regulations but of this Court's decision in Riverside Bayview."
2005.04-1034,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,4088.338,4093.417,So you say that the authority of... I don't... I don't even think the Corps has ever suggested this.
2005.04-1034,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,4107.294,4109.341,"No, that's not it, Justice Scalia."
2005.04-1034,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,4138.846,4140.536,What is... what is the basis for their doing it?
2005.04-1034,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,4153.413,4154.554,The short answer is flood control.
2005.04-1034,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,4174.059,4174.277,"Yes, I--"
2005.04-1034,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,4174.277,4176.558,--but actually is earlier in term... plays a better role--
2005.04-1034,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,4176.558,4177.417,--A statute could do that.
2005.04-1034,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,4182.825,4184.468,--Absolutely.
2005.04-1034,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,4184.468,4207.691,"And... and when... when there is nothing but puddles that are isolated by a berm, even from the storm drain which goes to tributaries, I can't conceive of... of how you could consider that that's... you know, at least where it leaks sometimes into the storm drain and went down to a tributary, I think it's an exaggeration, but maybe you could call it a water of the United States."
2005.04-1034,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,4217.866,4220.772,"Well, I think the way I would do it is you start with the tributary."
2005.04-1034,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,4252.076,4252.686,That's not the argument I was addressing.
2005.04-1034,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,4258.39,4262.515,And that's not an independent basis for jurisdiction.
2005.04-1034,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,4265.61,4266.438,--I'm happy to hear that.
2005.04-1034,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,4270.532,4271.392,It is not an independent basis.
2005.04-1034,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4368.663,4375.585,You... you put a lot of weight on the tributary question in your approach by giving up the hydrological connection.
2005.04-1034,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,4385.073,4389.621,"Well, and... and I'm... I wish that weren't the case, Mr. Chief Justice."
2005.04-1034,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4551.39,4553.156,"Thank you, General."
2005.04-1034,3,36044,m_reed_hopper,,4556.516,4559.595,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2005.04-1034,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,4559.595,4564.205,"Mr. Hopper, I hope you're going to tell us what you make of section 404(g)."
2005.04-1034,3,36044,m_reed_hopper,,4564.205,4565.58,I'd be happy to.
2005.04-1034,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,4705.346,4708.471,We're told that one of them was much closer.
2005.04-1034,3,36044,m_reed_hopper,,4708.471,4713.925,--The... the record is silent as to the distance between--
2005.04-1034,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,4713.925,4714.754,What about the Pine River?
2005.04-1034,3,36044,m_reed_hopper,,4717.816,4723.239,--We don't know how far that is because the record is silent as to the distance between those water bodies.
2005.04-1034,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,4723.239,4723.473,Do you know?
2005.04-1034,3,36044,m_reed_hopper,,4734.523,4735.258,I don't know what he means by very close.
2005.04-1034,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4791.707,4802.101,"Of course, when we're talking about the scope of... of Federal power, we're not merely concerned with dumping refuse in the creek, but also deliberate attempts to poison the water system."
2005.04-1034,3,36044,m_reed_hopper,,4802.101,4812.212,--Congress... Congress considered all this when it made its policy decision to defer to the States to address this.
2005.04-1034,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4825.402,4825.668,No.
2005.04-1034,3,36044,m_reed_hopper,,4832.201,4834.655,My time is--
2005.04-1034,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4834.655,4836.03,You may respond briefly.
2005.04-1034,3,36044,m_reed_hopper,,4836.03,4846.938,--Congress determined that it would defer to the States instead of exercising any further power beyond its channels authority.
2005.04-1034,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4846.938,4847.594,"Thank you, counsel."
