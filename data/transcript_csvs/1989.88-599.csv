1989.88-599,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.498,"We'll hear argument now in No. 88-599, Washington versus Walter Harper."
1989.88-599,0,46501,william_l_williams,,9.918,10.074,Thank you.
1989.88-599,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,119.327,126.45,"Mr. Williams, do you mind my asking where Mr. Harper is now?"
1989.88-599,0,46501,william_l_williams,,126.45,128.276,"No, your Honor, I do not."
1989.88-599,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,157.717,178.475,"Well, there was some suggestion, I think by Respondent's counsel, that he had been taken out of the Special Offender Center and taken off the medication, and that that situation had continued for several years and was likely to remain the same."
1989.88-599,0,46501,william_l_williams,,178.475,182.646,"Well, your Honor, with due respect to counsel, that was an inaccurate representation."
1989.88-599,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,190.002,190.361,--Uh-huh.
1989.88-599,0,46501,william_l_williams,,190.361,192.611,--operated by the Department of Corrections.
1989.88-599,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,203.48,205.995,--Was he ever put back on the medication?
1989.88-599,0,46501,william_l_williams,,205.995,206.402,"Yes, ma'am."
1989.88-599,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,218.053,221.365,Is there some possibility he could be returned there again and--
1989.88-599,0,46501,william_l_williams,,221.365,221.708,I think there--
1989.88-599,0,46501,william_l_williams,,221.708,222.099,--be subjected--
1989.88-599,0,46501,william_l_williams,,222.099,223.021,--is a very good possibility.
1989.88-599,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,276.546,286.496,"--Mr. Williams, I think Harper says that he's not been involuntarily medicated since 1986."
1989.88-599,0,46501,william_l_williams,,287.667,290.448,"That's what he says, your Honor, but that's not true."
1989.88-599,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,290.448,290.87,Uh-huh.
1989.88-599,0,46501,william_l_williams,,312.142,320.466,"He was at the Special Offender Center during that time period, and beginning in September of '87 to May of '88 he was involuntarily medicated."
1989.88-599,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,320.466,322.7,"Well, now... and since May of '88?"
1989.88-599,0,46501,william_l_williams,,322.7,327.229,And since May of '88 he's been in one of three different locations.
1989.88-599,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,329.151,332.446,And while... while there was he involuntarily medicated?
1989.88-599,0,46501,william_l_williams,,332.446,333.367,"No, your Honor, he was not."
1989.88-599,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,339.333,342.363,And again not involuntarily medicated there?
1989.88-599,0,46501,william_l_williams,,342.363,343.175,--I do not know.
1989.88-599,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,343.8,344.238,I see.
1989.88-599,0,46501,william_l_williams,,344.238,345.455,"--by Snohomish County, not the Department of Corrections."
1989.88-599,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,347.595,352.563,"Well, what I'm getting at is whether this issue of involuntary medication is moot."
1989.88-599,0,46501,william_l_williams,,352.563,363.652,"--Well, your Honor, it's our position that it is not moot because he will be... probably within the next month, but certainly within the next few months... returned to the Department of Corrections' custody."
1989.88-599,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,363.652,370.744,Isn't the... isn't the State of Washington now under this... the effect of this judgment?
1989.88-599,0,46501,william_l_williams,,370.744,373.226,"Yes, your Honor, we are."
1989.88-599,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,373.226,373.57,Well--
1989.88-599,0,46501,william_l_williams,,373.57,379.24,And that's why we're here today seeking the judgment... you... the judgment of the Washington Supreme Court in the case below.
1989.88-599,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,382.269,382.582,--Yes.
1989.88-599,0,46501,william_l_williams,,382.582,390.703,"And that's why we're here seeking to have that overturned, because we... if that decision is not overturned, then of course we would be foreclosed from--"
1989.88-599,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,390.703,395.561,"And we don't... we don't vacate state judgments if they're moot, do they... do we?"
1989.88-599,0,46501,william_l_williams,,395.561,397.7,"--Not in any published decision I could find, your Honor."
1989.88-599,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,442.604,446.243,"May I ask you right there, because it's kind of a fundamental question."
1989.88-599,0,46501,william_l_williams,,479.168,479.918,No.
1989.88-599,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,507.921,508.796,What about the--
1989.88-599,0,46501,william_l_williams,,522.931,523.634,"Well, we would submit that it is."
1989.88-599,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,528.007,532.582,And is that one of the factors that the panels will rely on in administering this program?
1989.88-599,0,46501,william_l_williams,,532.582,543.672,"Yes, the SOC policy provides that the medication is only administered, one, for the person who is mentally ill... so, it is a treatment context."
1989.88-599,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,571.13,580.282,I suppose you could resort to physical restraints if the problem was his risk to other people or himself.
1989.88-599,0,46501,william_l_williams,,580.282,582.281,"That is a possibility, your Honor."
1989.88-599,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,605.866,625.311,"But, of course, there are certain risks to the administration of the medication, and if someone felt strongly that they didn't want to be medicated and if you had the alternative of isolation or restraint, is that something the state should have to consider in the balance?"
1989.88-599,0,46501,william_l_williams,,625.311,631.324,--I think it can be considered but there are risks in administering the medication.
1989.88-599,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,722.958,731.44,I guess you don't... you rely entirely on in-house personnel for the review and the hearing and the determination.
1989.88-599,0,46501,william_l_williams,,732.346,733.455,"--That is correct, your Honor."
1989.88-599,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,734.205,745.309,"Would it be burdensome to require some outside consultant, or is that even appropriate to think about?"
1989.88-599,0,46501,william_l_williams,,753.977,756.273,"--Well, let me... let me modify my answer slightly."
1989.88-599,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,792.259,796.524,Does the... does the review panel determine the dosage and the type of drugs?
1989.88-599,0,46501,william_l_williams,,796.524,799.427,"--Not directly, your Honor."
1989.88-599,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,807.316,811.235,Can that be... can that be altered after the decision to medicate is approved?
1989.88-599,0,46501,william_l_williams,,811.235,812.625,"--Absolutely, your Honor."
1989.88-599,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,824.308,835.772,"But after the review panel makes its initial decision, does any change in the dosage or the... type of drug used have to go back before that panel?"
1989.88-599,0,46501,william_l_williams,,835.772,837.21,"No, your Honor, it does not."
1989.88-599,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,875.928,882.066,"Now, these psychotropic drugs alter the emotional state of the individual?"
1989.88-599,0,46501,william_l_williams,,882.066,890.548,"As I understand the way they work, they alter the emotional state and try to produce a more normative-type state."
1989.88-599,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,893.359,899.106,Do they alter the cognitive and perceptive faculties of the person?
1989.88-599,0,46501,william_l_williams,,899.106,912.366,--It is my understanding that they... that the can have that effect because they overcome the hallucinatory... and illusionary-type processes that are often at play with such individuals.
1989.88-599,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,912.366,927.735,Then either in a lay sense or a legal sense I take it we could say that his willingness or his ability to make a voluntary decision to consent or not to consent might also be altered by the drugs themselves.
1989.88-599,0,46501,william_l_williams,,927.735,929.516,That could be the case.
1989.88-599,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,947.305,970.156,"In a sense, then, it's qualitatively different from physical restraints, in that with physical restraints the prisoner at least has his voluntary decision, his will respected at all times, I take it, in that he can either consent to the restraints or consent to drug use?"
1989.88-599,0,46501,william_l_williams,,970.156,978.934,"If you accept the notion that what he is saying truly manifest... manifests his will, that would be true."
1989.88-599,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1003.297,1006.032,"I have one question I'd like to ask you, Mr. Williams."
1989.88-599,0,46501,william_l_williams,,1016.355,1017.979,"--That is true, your Honor."
1989.88-599,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1026.272,1027.491,May I ask you one question also?
1989.88-599,0,46501,william_l_williams,,1027.491,1028.069,"Yes, your Honor."
1989.88-599,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1028.069,1047.951,"Assuming a case in which the medical equation is equal... the medic... medical people conclude it may not do any good and it probably won't do any harm, but it's quite clear that it will make it easier to manage the prison if you have this very obstreperous person sedated, would it be permissible in your view in such a case to say you must... you may go ahead and give the drugs?"
1989.88-599,0,46501,william_l_williams,,1047.951,1057.948,"It would not be permissible under the SOC policy because under the SOC policy you can only be administered for a treatment purpose, and under your hypothetical, as I understood it, there would be no treatment purpose."
1989.88-599,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1057.948,1060.306,"Thank you, Mr. Williams."
1989.88-599,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1062.368,1075.627,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.88-599,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1149.661,1153.658,You began by saying a severely mentally ill person.
1989.88-599,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1165.123,1166.215,"Not always, your Honor."
1989.88-599,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1166.215,1187.942,"Well, doesn't the case come up to us in the context where the man is deemed to be competent, in the lay sense, of deciding whether he wants this medication or not, and to assess the benefits and the disadvantages of not having the medication?"
1989.88-599,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1187.942,1193.267,"Well, the competency standard that the Respondent has argued we believe is inappropriate for three reasons."
1989.88-599,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1209.433,1213.681,But he is not so seriously mentally ill that if he were a lay person he could be committed.
1989.88-599,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1214.103,1222.631,"--I think... no... under a lay standard, because he would be found to be mentally ill and a danger to others, he could be committed."
1989.88-599,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1419.753,1428.203,"Mr. Larkin, do you think the standard for a prison inmate is any different from the standard for a person who has been committed civilly to a mental hospital?"
1989.88-599,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1428.203,1429.218,No.
1989.88-599,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1432.233,1436.058,So then your analysis wouldn't rely at all on Turner against Safley and that line of cases?
1989.88-599,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1436.058,1436.496,Correct.
1989.88-599,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1439.948,1440.214,Right.
1989.88-599,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1440.214,1441.62,"Now, of course, in a prison context--"
1989.88-599,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1441.62,1444.619,I think your position is a little different than the state's position then.
1989.88-599,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1444.619,1444.947,--Correct.
1989.88-599,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1465.469,1479.464,I'm not sure you... you say a danger to others is part of the thing that doctors can consider as... in connection with the medical determination.
1989.88-599,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1500.97,1501.283,--Correct.
1989.88-599,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1501.283,1501.798,Isn't that right?
1989.88-599,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1501.798,1502.282,Correct.
1989.88-599,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1517.245,1517.698,"No, I understand."
1989.88-599,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1517.698,1521.712,--prevent him from harming someone else is not simply a means of preventative restraint.
1989.88-599,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1630.091,1631.558,"Thank you, Mr. Larkin."
1989.88-599,2,17939,brian_reed_phillips,,1634.728,1637.649,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.88-599,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1748.34,1751.759,He has that luxury when he's responsible for himself--
1989.88-599,2,17939,brian_reed_phillips,,1751.759,1752.274,Uh-huh.
1989.88-599,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1752.274,1754.383,--to simply refuse treatment.
1989.88-599,2,17939,brian_reed_phillips,,1754.383,1754.898,Uh-huh.
1989.88-599,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1754.898,1768.268,But that... it doesn't necessarily follow that he has that luxury when... when he's been duly convicted of a crime and has become a ward of the state in an institution to punish him for that crime.
1989.88-599,2,17939,brian_reed_phillips,,1781.748,1790.071,"Well, the state has the duty and the obligation because Mr. Harper is in custody to offer treatment, certainly, and to provide a minimum level of treatment."
1989.88-599,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1800.474,1803.364,But he does have an obligation not to injure other people.
1989.88-599,2,17939,brian_reed_phillips,,1803.364,1804.597,"--Yes, he does."
1989.88-599,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1804.597,1809.236,And I guess the state has some concern about his behavior.
1989.88-599,2,17939,brian_reed_phillips,,1809.236,1821.965,"And I think that's... the two' questions posed are where we get to the difficulty in this case, and that is to separate out the parens patriae power from the police power of the state."
1989.88-599,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1882.268,1887.142,But it seems to me the state has a right to do some of each.
1989.88-599,2,17939,brian_reed_phillips,,1893.358,1893.983,Yes.
1989.88-599,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1896.185,1896.669,Yeah.
1989.88-599,2,17939,brian_reed_phillips,,1896.669,1907.727,"But the point is that on the parens patriae side of this equation, they have the right... they have the obligation, if you will, to provide the minimum level of care."
1989.88-599,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1920.675,1926.954,Let's... let's see if it helps to put it in a context where it's not mental illness that's being treated.
1989.88-599,2,17939,brian_reed_phillips,,1931.187,1931.827,Uh-huh.
1989.88-599,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1931.827,1936.513,--and he decides I don't... I don't want to be treated for leprosy.
1989.88-599,2,17939,brian_reed_phillips,,1961.455,1963.065,"Yes, the state could."
1989.88-599,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1963.065,1963.299,All right.
1989.88-599,2,17939,brian_reed_phillips,,1964.719,1966.765,Mental ill... illness isn't different.
1989.88-599,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2083.639,2085.311,"Well, let me... let me go back to the leprosy case."
1989.88-599,2,17939,brian_reed_phillips,,2085.311,2085.545,--Okay.
1989.88-599,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2085.545,2094.589,Suppose the institution has a medical board examine the individual and the medical board says any reasonable person with this condition would accept medical treatment.
1989.88-599,2,17939,brian_reed_phillips,,2121.032,2125.029,"Again, I think it depends on the nature of the intrusion."
1989.88-599,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2125.029,2127.263,I've told you what the nature of the intrusion is.
1989.88-599,2,17939,brian_reed_phillips,,2127.263,2127.56,Well--
1989.88-599,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2127.56,2128.747,It's sound medical treatment.
1989.88-599,2,17939,brian_reed_phillips,,2130.2,2141.024,"--Well, on the parens patriae side of this equation, if you will, on the treatment side of this equation, I am a sound competent adult."
1989.88-599,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2145.413,2145.741,I understand that.
1989.88-599,2,17939,brian_reed_phillips,,2147.71,2148.693,Right.
1989.88-599,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2148.693,2149.896,--and the prison makes that judgment.
1989.88-599,2,17939,brian_reed_phillips,,2149.896,2151.535,"Well, I think--"
1989.88-599,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2151.535,2154.284,We don't want to have a special cell for a leper.
1989.88-599,2,17939,brian_reed_phillips,,2157.844,2158.36,--Uh-huh.
1989.88-599,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2158.36,2160.515,We're going to give this person medical treatment.
1989.88-599,2,17939,brian_reed_phillips,,2161.015,2169.012,"It depends... I think it depends on what... I don't mean to be disrespectful, but what is the nature of the intrusion?"
1989.88-599,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2179.961,2185.506,I don't think it makes any difference what the nature of the intrusion is so long as I've posited that any rational person would accept it.
1989.88-599,2,17939,brian_reed_phillips,,2190.958,2195.972,"Well, but then we're assuming that the inmate is incompetent."
1989.88-599,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2199.298,2202.219,"No, you don't have to be incompetent to be unreasonable about one thing."
1989.88-599,2,17939,brian_reed_phillips,,2205.265,2215.682,--And I don't see how a criminal conviction does away with the liberty rights or interests to make decisions concerning one's--
1989.88-599,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2215.682,2218.182,The answer is you could not treat the leper in that situation--
1989.88-599,2,17939,brian_reed_phillips,,2218.182,2218.258,"--No, I--"
1989.88-599,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2218.258,2218.883,--in your theory.
1989.88-599,2,17939,brian_reed_phillips,,2218.883,2219.383,"--No, that's not my answer."
1989.88-599,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2220.008,2220.508,"Well, what is your answer?"
1989.88-599,2,17939,brian_reed_phillips,,2220.508,2225.631,"--My answer is it would depend on what the side-effects were of the treatment, number one."
1989.88-599,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2231.785,2232.145,That's right.
1989.88-599,2,17939,brian_reed_phillips,,2232.738,2233.221,Okay.
1989.88-599,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2233.221,2235.425,I've said any rational person would accept the treatment.
1989.88-599,2,17939,brian_reed_phillips,,2236.72,2239.687,Then I think you'd need to go to a court and have a proceeding--
1989.88-599,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2239.687,2241.812,So you'd still need to go to court in that situation?
1989.88-599,2,17939,brian_reed_phillips,,2241.812,2245.717,--In the situation of a rational... no rational person would refuse this treatment?
1989.88-599,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2245.717,2246.076,Uh-huh.
1989.88-599,2,17939,brian_reed_phillips,,2246.076,2249.792,I think a court needs to decide that that is in fact the case.
1989.88-599,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2249.792,2262.866,"What makes the court better able to decide that than the medical practitioners, and why isn't the court totally reliant on the advise of the medial practitioners in that situation?"
1989.88-599,2,17939,brian_reed_phillips,,2262.866,2272.611,"Well, I think in... on the parens patriae side of this you're asking... what you're asking is for a substituted judgment, and courts make those kinds of judgments all the time."
1989.88-599,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2284.138,2296.493,"Well, in case like Youngberg v. Romeo this Court has held that it can be... such decisions can be made by medical experts."
1989.88-599,2,17939,brian_reed_phillips,,2296.493,2296.821,--Well--
1989.88-599,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2296.821,2303.849,That a court isn't always necessary to... as an intervening power.
1989.88-599,2,17939,brian_reed_phillips,,2303.849,2310.768,--And there I think it depends on the nature of the liberty interest and the nature of the intrusion.
1989.88-599,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2310.768,2318.326,"Well, involuntary commitment is a pretty powerful liberty interest there."
1989.88-599,2,17939,brian_reed_phillips,,2318.326,2318.686,"Yes, it is."
1989.88-599,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2356.701,2373.165,"What if... what if Washington were to say, all right, we will go to court and get a determination that the prisoner in this case was mentally incompetent, and then we're going to follow our SOC proceedings from then on as to whether drugs should be administered."
1989.88-599,2,17939,brian_reed_phillips,,2375.336,2377.522,I think that's a lot closer.
1989.88-599,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2381.662,2391.875,"So, once the determination of mental incompetency has been made, you don't object to the treatment decisions being made administratively?"
1989.88-599,2,17939,brian_reed_phillips,,2391.875,2398.779,--I... I'm not saying that the particular dosage or the particular type of antipsychotic drug would be determined by the court.
1989.88-599,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2399.732,2406.292,"Well, would... would the court need only to determine once that the guy was mentally incompetent?"
1989.88-599,2,17939,brian_reed_phillips,,2406.292,2409.243,"No, I would think that there would have to be some periodic review."
1989.88-599,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2409.243,2421.457,"Well, so... but... but review of the competence of the individual or review of the... review of the treatment decisions?"
1989.88-599,2,17939,brian_reed_phillips,,2421.457,2434.014,I think review of... the lower court in this situation has indicated that before you can treat you need to in part make a competency determination because they talked about a substituted judgment.
1989.88-599,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2453.336,2458.317,"Well, that's quite different, really, than my hypothetical which is a more limited thing."
1989.88-599,2,17939,brian_reed_phillips,,2471.859,2473.968,"--Well, I... I'd prefer the lower court's decision."
1989.88-599,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2488.259,2498.551,"Well, if I understand you, the only time this treatment could be imposed involuntarily is if the person is incompetent to make his own decision."
1989.88-599,2,17939,brian_reed_phillips,,2498.551,2499.301,No.
1989.88-599,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2499.301,2510.718,"You... you would think that even if a person is competent and refuses, a court could say... could find him to be a danger to himself and others and then give the--"
1989.88-599,2,17939,brian_reed_phillips,,2510.718,2517.48,In line with civil commitment acts... in line with the civil commitment statutes--
1989.88-599,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2517.48,2518.308,"--Well, what that means is--"
1989.88-599,2,17939,brian_reed_phillips,,2518.308,2518.496,--in the State of Washington.
1989.88-599,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2518.496,2522.729,--A civil commitment means that you can certainly deprive them of their liberty--
1989.88-599,2,17939,brian_reed_phillips,,2522.729,2523.524,Certainly.
1989.88-599,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2523.524,2524.352,--and restrain them.
1989.88-599,2,17939,brian_reed_phillips,,2532.069,2532.974,And I don't--
1989.88-599,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2532.974,2538.455,I thought... I understood that your position was that if he's competent that's the end of the story.
1989.88-599,2,17939,brian_reed_phillips,,2538.455,2539.018,--Well--
1989.88-599,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2539.018,2541.126,They may not involuntarily--
1989.88-599,2,17939,brian_reed_phillips,,2541.126,2552.076,"--Mr. Harper's position is he's never been seen by a court with respect to his mental status that has led to this incarceration and that has given him drugs, and he wants to be seen by a court."
1989.88-599,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2552.076,2552.998,"--Well, I know that."
1989.88-599,2,17939,brian_reed_phillips,,2556.792,2559.791,I think that the court... when the court looks--
1989.88-599,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2559.791,2561.774,Suppose they find him competent--
1989.88-599,2,17939,brian_reed_phillips,,2561.774,2562.274,--Uh-huh.
1989.88-599,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2562.274,2565.164,--but a danger to himself and others?
1989.88-599,2,17939,brian_reed_phillips,,2567.039,2571.584,"Well, I think that's a question that the court is going to have to deal with."
1989.88-599,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2571.584,2573.146,"Well, what's your opinion on that?"
1989.88-599,2,17939,brian_reed_phillips,,2573.614,2574.411,Well--
1989.88-599,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2574.411,2579.378,--I think that's... I think it depends a lot on how this case comes out.
1989.88-599,2,17939,brian_reed_phillips,,2581.407,2589.826,"--That the prisoner is in... is incompetent, the prisoner is competent but has been committed."
1989.88-599,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2591.34,2598.417,"Well, what... I would like to know what you are claiming the court must decide."
1989.88-599,2,17939,brian_reed_phillips,,2598.417,2598.995,--Okay.
1989.88-599,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2616.66,2617.206,Yes.
1989.88-599,2,17939,brian_reed_phillips,,2617.846,2622.938,It needs to resolve the question of whether or not the person is a danger to himself or others.
1989.88-599,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2623.891,2628.201,"If he's incompetent... if he's incompetent, they don't need to resolve that?"
1989.88-599,2,17939,brian_reed_phillips,,2628.529,2630.231,"--No, I think they need to resolve that as well."
1989.88-599,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2630.231,2632.934,--If he's... even though he's incompetent?
1989.88-599,2,17939,brian_reed_phillips,,2632.934,2633.699,Yes.
1989.88-599,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2633.699,2644.024,"And if he is competent, they resolve that... if they resolve the danger element against him, the drugs may be administered?"
1989.88-599,2,17939,brian_reed_phillips,,2644.024,2645.631,If he's incompetent?
1989.88-599,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2645.631,2646.272,No.
1989.88-599,2,17939,brian_reed_phillips,,2647.459,2647.865,If he's competent.
1989.88-599,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2647.865,2648.6,Uh-huh.
1989.88-599,2,17939,brian_reed_phillips,,2648.6,2651.067,"Well, I--"
1989.88-599,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2651.067,2654.363,"Well, the state court answered that very clearly."
1989.88-599,2,17939,brian_reed_phillips,,2657.862,2659.563,"--Yes, they did say it had to be in his best interest."
1989.88-599,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2659.563,2665.154,Which they might fail that test even if he's dangerous and even if he's competent or incompetent.
1989.88-599,2,17939,brian_reed_phillips,,2665.154,2668.575,And they said they had essentially to make a substituted judgment.
1989.88-599,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2668.575,2670.825,Do you defend the position of the state supreme court?
1989.88-599,2,17939,brian_reed_phillips,,2670.825,2671.511,"Yes, I do."
1989.88-599,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2671.511,2680.523,"So, you can treat him even though he's competent, and even though he doesn't want to be treated?"
1989.88-599,2,17939,brian_reed_phillips,,2684.475,2684.85,Yeah.
1989.88-599,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2686.459,2692.394,And is that true even if the drugs alter his will?
1989.88-599,2,17939,brian_reed_phillips,,2692.394,2698.782,"Well, yes, I think it is true even if the drugs alter his will."
1989.88-599,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2701.124,2705.107,"So that a competent person, over his objection--"
1989.88-599,2,17939,brian_reed_phillips,,2705.107,2705.576,--Uh-huh.
1989.88-599,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2705.576,2710.449,"--can receive psychotropic drugs that alter his will, if there is a court hearing?"
1989.88-599,2,17939,brian_reed_phillips,,2710.918,2717.15,I'm sorry.
1989.88-599,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2722.647,2744.811,Is your objection in this case to the fact that the drugs alter the will or that they have side-effects because I'd like... in order to put that proposition to hypothesize that you have a psychotropic drug which has no side-effects but it does alter the will.
1989.88-599,2,17939,brian_reed_phillips,,2752.963,2755.431,No.
1989.88-599,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2758.929,2759.758,Yes.
1989.88-599,2,17939,brian_reed_phillips,,2759.758,2760.429,No.
1989.88-599,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2765.723,2769.534,"It would alter his cognitive faculties, his emotional state."
1989.88-599,2,17939,brian_reed_phillips,,2780.889,2786.808,"--Well, that would be a very effective drugs... in some countries that I can think of and... and would probably be widely used."
1989.88-599,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2789.291,2796.383,"Is it permissible to administer such a drug to a person against his will if he's competent, in a prison setting?"
1989.88-599,2,17939,brian_reed_phillips,,2796.383,2805.285,--If he's competent?
1989.88-599,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2805.285,2806.192,Yeah.
1989.88-599,2,17939,brian_reed_phillips,,2806.192,2808.003,"No, I think it would not be permissible."
1989.88-599,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2808.003,2829.088,"Well, I guess the court below thought if a person is found to be mentally ill or diseased and a danger to himself or others, then that individual can be involuntarily committed and involuntarily treated if it's in the best interests of that person."
1989.88-599,2,17939,brian_reed_phillips,,2848.674,2866.073,"Well, I think the court below did in effect require a competency decision by referring to a substituted judgment that the person would be too irrational to make a decision and that the court in so doing..."
1989.88-599,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2884.191,2893.406,"That's not what the court said, of course, and that's not the standard for involuntary commitment in Washington State or other states."
1989.88-599,2,17939,brian_reed_phillips,,2893.406,2904.216,"Well, the court... the court indicated that the court must set forth findings on, among other things, the desires of the patient or a substituted judgment by the court... is what the court indicated."
1989.88-599,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2937.326,2956.037,"Well, as an original proposition I think that's... that's very appealing, and I might agree with it, that maybe the state shouldn't have the right to alter anybody's mind without the person's consent unless the person is incompetent in the sense that Justice O'Connor was speaking of."
1989.88-599,2,17939,brian_reed_phillips,,2965.611,2968.205,The tradition of--
1989.88-599,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2968.205,2979.169,Of simply declining to administer any... any psychotropic drugs if the individual is competent and refuses them?
1989.88-599,2,17939,brian_reed_phillips,,2981.496,2983.261,--Historically in this country?
1989.88-599,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2983.261,2984.198,Historically.
1989.88-599,2,17939,brian_reed_phillips,,2984.198,2985.432,I'm really not sure.
1989.88-599,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2989.461,3002.565,But you just think that we ought to adopt a rule that you cannot alter somebody's mind unless... unless the person is willing or incompetent?
1989.88-599,2,17939,brian_reed_phillips,,3002.565,3013.529,I... I think that the Court needs to bear in mind the implication... the First Amendment implications of the administration of antipsychotic medications in deciding this case.
1989.88-599,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3013.858,3025.961,I take it you'd agree that the difficulty of these questions is a strong argument for your position that there should be a court hearing initially?
1989.88-599,2,17939,brian_reed_phillips,,3025.961,3028.444,Exactly.
1989.88-599,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3112.52,3118.642,"Mr. Phillips, does the record tell us how many prisoners are... will be affected by this decision in Washington?"
1989.88-599,2,17939,brian_reed_phillips,,3118.642,3132.106,I believe it indicates in the findings of fact that there were some... something in the 20s who were at the Special Offender Center who have not been receiving... who were refusing antipsychotic medications.
1989.88-599,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3192.129,3192.504,Excuse me.
1989.88-599,2,17939,brian_reed_phillips,,3208.061,3209.264,--You do not have to be incompetent.
1989.88-599,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3209.264,3210.278,You don't have to be incompetent?
1989.88-599,2,17939,brian_reed_phillips,,3210.278,3210.544,No.
1989.88-599,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3210.544,3216.636,"So... and I assume you would apply the same rule in... a fortiori, in mental institutions?"
1989.88-599,2,17939,brian_reed_phillips,,3222.852,3227.351,"Well, that's the rule I would like to see this Court adopt."
1989.88-599,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3283.14,3300.79,"So, this hearing that you're asking would have to occur not just in prisons, but in all... in all mental institutions in all states for anybody who has been committed not for incompetence but just because the person is a danger to himself or others?"
1989.88-599,2,17939,brian_reed_phillips,,3310.566,3312.8,"That, of course, is not the question before the Court."
1989.88-599,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3312.8,3317.751,"Well, no, but I see no reason of distinguishing mental patients from prisoners for that purpose."
1989.88-599,2,17939,brian_reed_phillips,,3317.751,3322.014,"And that is the decision that has been made by the Washington State Legislature, for example... to do that."
1989.88-599,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3322.014,3327.855,"Well, in Vitek there was a prisoner... involved a prisoner... a transfer to a mental institution."
1989.88-599,2,17939,brian_reed_phillips,,3327.855,3328.137,Uh-huh.
1989.88-599,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3328.137,3329.855,He was already in custody.
1989.88-599,2,17939,brian_reed_phillips,,3337.18,3338.743,Correct.
1989.88-599,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3338.743,3342.32,And didn't Vitek involve a transfer for treatment?
1989.88-599,2,17939,brian_reed_phillips,,3342.32,3344.662,For behavior modification treatment.
1989.88-599,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3344.662,3345.552,Yes.
1989.88-599,2,17939,brian_reed_phillips,,3347.63,3348.862,"Yes, it's not as intrusive."
1989.88-599,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3348.862,3354.563,"So, it's just a degree of intrusiveness?"
1989.88-599,2,17939,brian_reed_phillips,,3354.563,3356.735,I think that's a very important factor.
1989.88-599,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3364.982,3369.12,So we have to... we have to distinguish between the medications.
1989.88-599,2,17939,brian_reed_phillips,,3371.699,3372.011,--Right.
1989.88-599,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3372.011,3372.728,--in Vitek.
1989.88-599,2,17939,brian_reed_phillips,,3375.415,3376.852,"Well, it--"
1989.88-599,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3376.852,3379.414,That this doesn't or that... what does this do to you that that doesn't?
1989.88-599,2,17939,brian_reed_phillips,,3379.414,3385.693,--It... It's designed to alter your behavior but I would submit that one can refuse to participate.
1989.88-599,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3385.693,3386.894,And altering your will a little bit?
1989.88-599,2,17939,brian_reed_phillips,,3386.894,3390.33,One can refuse to participate in the treatment.
1989.88-599,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3483.543,3486.683,"What... oh, excuse me."
1989.88-599,2,17939,brian_reed_phillips,,3488.322,3489.26,"Oh, I'm sorry."
1989.88-599,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3489.26,3494.351,"--Thank you, Mr. Williams... rather, Mr. Phillips."
1989.88-599,3,46501,william_l_williams,,3496.725,3498.74,"Thank you, your Honor."
1989.88-599,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3526.401,3530.102,Do you know what the... what the success rate has been in the hearings?
1989.88-599,3,46501,william_l_williams,,3533.195,3536.068,"In all seven that have been brought at the prison that has been the result, your Honor."
1989.88-599,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3566.183,3578.957,--[inaudible] just... just behavior modification treatment wouldn't necessarily involve the considerations that are in this case?
1989.88-599,3,46501,william_l_williams,,3578.957,3585.595,"Well, I think they may arguably... and if it does involve medication, it may arguably involve different kinds of considerations."
1989.88-599,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3653.819,3667.765,"Mr. Williams, what about just having a judge make the decision which the judge makes for civil commitment, not that... on the details of medical treatment, but at least a judicial decision that the person is a danger to himself or others?"
1989.88-599,3,46501,william_l_williams,,3678.855,3712.31,"Well, I guess the response to that is what value does that add to the decision-making process to have a judge make that decision when the result, if he makes a negative decision even though medical professional judgment indicates that the person does constitute because of his medical condition a threat to himself or others... if one of the outcomes is that the judge is going to in effect overturn that decision, what you have is a judge interfering with the professional medical judgment which this court has said persons in custody are entitled to."
1989.88-599,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3720.713,3724.04,"Thank you, Mr. Williams."
