1994.94-820,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.016,"We'll hear argument now in No. 94-820, the Metropolitan Stevedore Company v. John Rambo."
1994.94-820,0,38699,robert_e_babcock,,10.398,13.591,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1994.94-820,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,168.36,177.266,"Now, the initial determination of liability is made by considering things other than the physical condition?"
1994.94-820,0,38699,robert_e_babcock,,177.266,177.707,The--
1994.94-820,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,177.707,184.571,The physical condition as well as the effect on the... the wage-earning ability?
1994.94-820,0,38699,robert_e_babcock,,184.571,211.881,"--The original determination is made in accordance with some instructions appearing at Section 8(h) of the Act, and includes, in addition to the physical condition, virtually all that would affect either the stability of the current employment or the prospects and stability of future employment, both micro or personal factors such as skills and capacities, and macro factors such as the industry as a whole."
1994.94-820,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,274.24,278.683,Fleetwood is the name of the person involved in the McCormick case?
1994.94-820,0,38699,robert_e_babcock,,278.683,279.804,"Excuse me, Your Honor."
1994.94-820,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,317.178,319.65,Do we... do we adjust conditions for inflation?
1994.94-820,0,38699,robert_e_babcock,,328.185,346.126,"The Benefits Review Board's rule... and it's been approved by, I think, all the circuits that have looked at it, requires the parties who are taking earnings at a date subsequent to the date of the injury to prove, as a matter of fact, what those new jobs or that new position would have paid at the time of injury."
1994.94-820,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,352.06,353.933,And what if his condition gets worse?
1994.94-820,0,38699,robert_e_babcock,,357.884,362.899,"Well, it would depend on whether one were working from the 9th Circuit or the 4th Circuit position."
1994.94-820,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,402.524,403.826,Is--
1994.94-820,0,38699,robert_e_babcock,,406.346,407.997,"Yes, it's just broader."
1994.94-820,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,412.411,417.383,--How often would that adjustment be made under the 4th Circuit rule?
1994.94-820,0,38699,robert_e_babcock,,419.534,428.63,"I think that it's very hard... when you move off a single definition, you start down a slippery slope to find a place that's a logical stopping point."
1994.94-820,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,472.849,476.162,"Of course, Fleetwood is a case where the employer got the modification, wasn't it?"
1994.94-820,0,38699,robert_e_babcock,,476.162,476.502,That's correct.
1994.94-820,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,476.502,479.904,But are there similar cases where the employee has gotten modification?
1994.94-820,0,38699,robert_e_babcock,,479.904,497.607,In the amicus brief submitted by Industrial Indemnity Insurance Company there was reference to one case... I believe it's name was Vasquez... where an employee had come in seeking modification as a result of a loss of skills and a loss of employment and was awarded--
1994.94-820,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,497.607,514.926,Just... just one case... it would seem to me that there is a lot... there would be a lot of possibilities for claims by employees that... say the job had been abolished or something like that... the example you gave... but why do you suppose there aren't more of them?
1994.94-820,0,38699,robert_e_babcock,,514.926,521.422,"--Well, I think first, in reality, 90 percent of these cases settle before the first hearing occurs."
1994.94-820,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,534.98,546.288,Are you saying that in your experience there are say hundreds or thousands of cases in which adjustments are requested because of economic changes that the Board never sees?
1994.94-820,0,38699,robert_e_babcock,,546.288,559.286,"--No, I'm saying... excuse me... I see, one way or another, probably a third to half of the longshore cases on the West Coast, both shipyards and stevedoring trades."
1994.94-820,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,567.151,570.964,Were all those requests by the employer?
1994.94-820,0,38699,robert_e_babcock,,570.964,573.536,Except for the Vasquez case--
1994.94-820,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,573.536,574.627,"But the one you knew about, though?"
1994.94-820,0,38699,robert_e_babcock,,574.627,578.838,"--All that I've... all that I've dealt with have dealt with employer requests, that's correct."
1994.94-820,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,578.838,588.015,What I'm trying to get some sense of is your experience as a practitioner and just how many of these claims are made and resolved without the necessity of... or review by the Board?
1994.94-820,0,38699,robert_e_babcock,,588.015,591.376,"I... I would say virtually none, Your Honor."
1994.94-820,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,607.248,613.712,"Well, I suppose, given your being in the 9th Circuit, I... I should ask what the experience of some other circuits are."
1994.94-820,0,38699,robert_e_babcock,,613.712,624.058,"Well, I'm speaking nationally: The 9th Circuit, of course... those of us within it... lived under the Benefits Review Board rule until the 9th Circuit issued its opinion in this case, striking the Board's rule down."
1994.94-820,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,624.058,627.311,What about State workers' compensation schemes?
1994.94-820,0,38699,robert_e_babcock,,629.703,630.323,There are.
1994.94-820,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,662.163,666.507,So you have the same split among the States that you have between the 4th and the 9th?
1994.94-820,0,38699,robert_e_babcock,,666.507,671.96,"I don't think I could do that, Your Honor, without looking at the States."
1994.94-820,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,674.871,679.794,"Well, I... there is a split, and some States take the position that the 9th Circuit has taken and some take the position that the 4th Circuit has taken--"
1994.94-820,0,38699,robert_e_babcock,,679.794,680.105,Right.
1994.94-820,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,680.105,682.555,--construing similar language in State statute?
1994.94-820,0,38699,robert_e_babcock,,682.555,682.836,That's right.
1994.94-820,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,703.891,720.73,"You include... I gather... what if there's just a... just a... a particularly good couple of years for the industry, so that all the wages in the industry are higher; is that one of those conditions?"
1994.94-820,0,38699,robert_e_babcock,,720.73,726.324,"I think it will get you in the door to a proceeding, seeking modification."
1994.94-820,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,750.01,752.424,But that... but that's an increase that would have happened anyway.
1994.94-820,0,38699,robert_e_babcock,,760.167,760.878,"Well, that's right."
1994.94-820,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,785.134,790.037,"What... what do you think the conditions are, other than the physical?"
1994.94-820,0,38699,robert_e_babcock,,790.037,795.252,I think that they encompass the availability and suitability of employment.
1994.94-820,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,828.151,835.618,"So... so, well, then I was just interested... you said the lack of jobs in the depression wouldn't be a relevant factor."
1994.94-820,0,38699,robert_e_babcock,,838.95,839.361,"--Well, it--"
1994.94-820,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,839.361,842.803,"As you get older, it's harder, if you're handicapped, to... to make more money."
1994.94-820,0,38699,robert_e_babcock,,842.803,844.524,--If I may take them one at a time.
1994.94-820,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,895.217,907.963,"What I'm having trouble is finding that... that a person, say, has... his arm doesn't... is... is handicapped, and so they say, here in 1952, that's worth $80 a week, because you can't hold these jobs."
1994.94-820,0,38699,robert_e_babcock,,932.681,941.877,"--All of those things are taken into account, both in the original determination and have to be taken into account in the assessment of whether a modification is appropriate; that's correct."
1994.94-820,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,944.708,946.688,"Very well, Mr. Babcock."
1994.94-820,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,948.38,963.441,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1994.94-820,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,994.45,996.713,"May I just ask one question, Mr. Minear?"
1994.94-820,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1008.989,1011.65,The Board did not take a position on this issue.
1994.94-820,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1057.792,1059.552,It thought it had which position in '74?
1994.94-820,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1059.552,1062.033,It thought it had the position of being limited to a physical condition--
1994.94-820,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1062.033,1062.273,Physical only.
1994.94-820,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1062.273,1063.024,--But the fact is--
1994.94-820,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1063.024,1069.86,"Well, when... when did the... either the Director or the Board first manifest the position that it's not limited to physical injury?"
1994.94-820,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1069.86,1074.702,"--Well, I think there were various manifest... manifestations along the way, although no clear holdings."
1994.94-820,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1074.702,1079.427,"When is the first clear indication of what their... their position was, it was not limited to physical holding?"
1994.94-820,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1079.427,1096.958,"I think one clear holding would have been in 1972, when the Assistant Secretary for Labor indicated that if a worker failed... indicated in congressional oversight hearings... that if a worker failed to... to accept rehabilitation opportunities, his award could be requced on that basis."
1994.94-820,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1096.958,1110.476,"Well, apart from testimony in here, when in any... any actual... controversy... you know, any... any... any actual case... when did either the Director or the Board first manifest the position unequivocally that you now espouse?"
1994.94-820,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1110.476,1114.179,I don't think it was unequivocally manifested until 1984.
1994.94-820,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1124.615,1130.448,"See, the thing that puzzles me... just to get it on the table... it seems to me if the... if the... if that rule is correct, there would have been a lot of cases."
1994.94-820,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1135.042,1136.592,"Well, I... I don't think that's necessarily so."
1994.94-820,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1168.093,1172.576,"Yes, but wouldn't... wouldn't your principle apply if he got a job as a travelling salesman and doubled his income?"
1994.94-820,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1172.576,1172.887,--Yes.
1994.94-820,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1174.917,1180.761,"So, I mean, there must be lots of these people who have been able to improve their earning capacity for reasons unrelated to their injury?"
1994.94-820,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1180.761,1187.667,"Well, another difficulty is that in fact, in those cases where the people leave the industry, the employer may not know what their current earnings are."
1994.94-820,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1209.7,1211.602,"Yes, but the obvious one is inflation?"
1994.94-820,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1211.602,1212.682,Excuse me?
1994.94-820,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1212.682,1214.124,The obvious one is inflation.
1994.94-820,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1221.487,1222.809,"Well, the inflation... excuse me, Your Honor--"
1994.94-820,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1222.809,1223.811,--Yes.
1994.94-820,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1223.811,1234.627,"--To answer your question, the Longshore Act does take into account inflation in Section 10, in the case of total disability, but not in the case of permanent partial disability."
1994.94-820,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1234.627,1248.306,"So why weren't they all in and saying, hey, first of all, inflation, and... and second... well, I mean inflation is the obvious one and I... I'm sure there... there are a lot of others where... where... why wouldn't they just... they get older... that's the other obvious one."
1994.94-820,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1248.306,1248.556,Well--
1994.94-820,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1248.556,1250.299,And it is harder to find a job when you're older.
1994.94-820,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1250.299,1255.44,"--Well, under our construction, those types of considerations are not relevant changes in conditions."
1994.94-820,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1255.44,1255.791,Why not?
1994.94-820,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1256.321,1260.764,The reason why is because those factors are considered in the initial benefits award.
1994.94-820,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1266.167,1271.49,"--And you think that we're accurately in... in the... in the early seventies, people really predicted the Arab oil embargo and everything?"
1994.94-820,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1271.49,1281.708,"--Now, if there was a change there, that would arise under a mistake of fact rather than a change in conditions, to the extent that that factor is considered, in the initial benefits determination."
1994.94-820,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1291.104,1293.575,"Well, what about general... a general change in the economy?"
1994.94-820,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1304.181,1306.695,"No, the Director generally doesn't."
1994.94-820,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1333.951,1339.136,"Well, is the... what... what condition is relevant beyond an... an acquisition of the new skill?"
1994.94-820,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1339.136,1341.908,"New skills, a change in physical condition."
1994.94-820,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1341.908,1342.148,Yes.
1994.94-820,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1342.148,1345.999,"The elimination of a particular job because it's obsolete, for instance."
1994.94-820,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1355.576,1356.177,Yes.
1994.94-820,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1356.177,1357.136,I think there's one--
1994.94-820,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1357.136,1357.747,Why... why do you draw the line--
1994.94-820,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1361.02,1366.643,"--Well, the difference there is he had a particular skill that was taken into account at that... at that time."
1994.94-820,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1370.026,1370.346,"No, but--"
1994.94-820,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1370.346,1371.138,--Excuse me.
1994.94-820,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1387.396,1390.448,"--Yes, but that could be because it covers mistakes as well as change in condition."
1994.94-820,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1392.76,1396.463,"Oh, that's... that's a separate concern, again, whether or not there is State compensation."
1994.94-820,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1428.924,1429.294,"Well, if that's--"
1994.94-820,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1429.294,1430.446,--what are the considerations--
1994.94-820,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1430.446,1434.316,"--if I'm following you, if that's the case, why can you consider a... an acquisition of a new skill?"
1994.94-820,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1434.316,1438.811,--An acquisition of a new skill is something that is a relevant change in conditions.
1994.94-820,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1440.011,1444.215,You mean because the skill level was considered at the time the original award was made?
1994.94-820,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1444.215,1447.506,--Because he was assumed to have had only limited skills.
1994.94-820,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1448.348,1461.615,"Yes, but your... I take it your criterion, in answer to Justice Scalia's question and my question, your criterion is a change in condition refers to any condition which was considered or anticipated at the time of the original award; is that your answer?"
1994.94-820,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1461.615,1463.177,Or... or could have been considered as well.
1994.94-820,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1500.15,1503.533,Then why... why can't... why can't he say they... they anticipated a depression?
1994.94-820,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1507.684,1515.922,"--Well, he could certainly say that, but he would have to prove here... the... the problem here is if you move for modification you're going to have to prove the basis for your modification."
1994.94-820,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1528.629,1530.111,"Thank you, Mr. Minear."
1994.94-820,2,43184,thomas_j_pierry,,1533.493,1536.395,"Mr. Chief Justice, if the Court please:"
1994.94-820,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1605.699,1609.923,"Of course, Fleetwood flung open the door about 10 years ago, and we haven't been flooded with cases--"
1994.94-820,2,43184,thomas_j_pierry,,1609.923,1611.944,"Not in the 1st, 5th, 9th, or 11th Circuit."
1994.94-820,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1611.944,1612.294,--Yes.
1994.94-820,2,43184,thomas_j_pierry,,1612.294,1612.935,We've still--
1994.94-820,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1612.935,1613.366,I see.
1994.94-820,2,43184,thomas_j_pierry,,1616.367,1616.796,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1994.94-820,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1616.796,1627.474,"And how, if at all, did that re... relate to Congress' requiring or allowing the employer to get wage reports from the employee?"
1994.94-820,2,43184,thomas_j_pierry,,1627.474,1636.7,"Interesting, Your Honor, on the Congressional Record, Mr. Nickles pointed out that the 1984 amendments were concerned with fraud."
1994.94-820,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1688.513,1692.557,"Is the reporting mandatory now, or is it up to--"
1994.94-820,2,43184,thomas_j_pierry,,1692.557,1692.917,Mandatory.
1994.94-820,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1738.245,1738.846,"--Well, but so what?"
1994.94-820,2,43184,thomas_j_pierry,,1744.98,1765.243,"It's not a question of whether she has the standing; it's a question of whether or not this Court and Congress intended that she would be in the position where she would be litigating on behalf of the parties, as opposed to as the recent decision by Justice Scalia said, that they... the... they are an independent arbiter and not a litigator."
1994.94-820,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1765.243,1797.424,"--Well, if... what I'm actually driving at is, is... is it a bad thing to... why is it a bad thing, if the language allows it, to let the Agency work out a set of rules, over time, even if nobody has thought of it before, whereby they will... when there are changes, the worker... usually it'll probably work in favor of the worker... I mean the inflation will go up or there's an economic change nobody thought of and he has a harder time getting a job as he gets older... isn't that what the Agency is there for, to work all these things out?"
1994.94-820,2,43184,thomas_j_pierry,,1797.424,1800.746,The Agency is there to do as Congress delegated it to do.
1994.94-820,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1818.699,1828.115,"I don't think I follow, Mr. Pierry, your contention that if we resolve this case one way there will be something contrary to the Newport News decision in it."
1994.94-820,2,43184,thomas_j_pierry,,1828.115,1830.486,"I'm not sure I understand your question, Chief Justice."
1994.94-820,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1830.486,1839.041,"Well, I... I gather you're arguing that if we decide this case in favor of your opponent, we will somehow undercut our recent decision in the Newport News case."
1994.94-820,2,43184,thomas_j_pierry,,1840.954,1854.012,"Under Section 22, the Director is... is given specific authority to file a modification, whereas she is not given that authority as she is under the Black Lung Act, et cetera, et cetera."
1994.94-820,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1863.167,1866.239,But she is authorized to file for a modification?
1994.94-820,2,43184,thomas_j_pierry,,1866.239,1866.75,"Yes, she is."
1994.94-820,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1866.75,1868.69,"Well, that's what Congress has provided."
1994.94-820,2,43184,thomas_j_pierry,,1880.168,1885.701,It has provided the Director the authority to file a petition for modification.
1994.94-820,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1899.382,1903.452,Uniformly except in the 4th Circuit?
1994.94-820,2,43184,thomas_j_pierry,,1903.452,1907.766,"No, uniformly except in the 1st, 5th, 9th, and 11th Circuit."
1994.94-820,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2016.828,2017.829,"Thank you, Mr. Pierry."
1994.94-820,3,38699,robert_e_babcock,,2021.461,2035.949,"Well, first, we cannot see within the Act or its structure... structure justice when an individual who no longer has an economic loss continuing to receive benefits--"
1994.94-820,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2035.949,2036.951,"Well, I'll presume that."
1994.94-820,3,38699,robert_e_babcock,,2049.35,2052.922,"--No, I don't think that's a fair characterization of a workers' compensation scheme."
1994.94-820,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2099.943,2102.514,"Well, it did... did away with having to prove fault."
1994.94-820,3,38699,robert_e_babcock,,2108.548,2109.539,I think it's a substitute.
1994.94-820,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2121.347,2124.379,"--Because we're only talking about nonscheduled awards, aren't we, in this case?"
1994.94-820,3,38699,robert_e_babcock,,2124.379,2124.797,--That's correct.
1994.94-820,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2124.797,2126.65,The scheduled awards go on whatever happens?
1994.94-820,3,38699,robert_e_babcock,,2126.65,2147.202,"Well, I think... in theory, you would say that a scheduled award, because its focus is solely for impairment of the worker... 20 percent lost function of an arm... if somehow that improved and the award had not been fully paid out by the time this all occurred, that you would seek modification based on change of physical condition."
1994.94-820,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2147.202,2154.367,"But in the non... what I'm saying... in the non... in the scheduled award, it would have to be a change of physical condition; you would agree with that?"
1994.94-820,3,38699,robert_e_babcock,,2154.367,2156.189,"Yes, because that's the basis for the award."
1994.94-820,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2212.677,2222.462,Is any of that possibly the result of the declining oil business in the Gulf or things like that... any of that decrease during that period of time?
1994.94-820,3,38699,robert_e_babcock,,2222.462,2224.695,--I think the shipyards have gone down some.
1994.94-820,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2237.682,2238.874,"Thank you, Mr. Babcock."
