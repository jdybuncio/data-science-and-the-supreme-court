1984.83-812,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,10.789,We will hear arguments first this morning in Wallace v. Jaffree and the consolidated case.
1984.83-812,0,29232,john_s_baker_jr,,13.991,16.743,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1984.83-812,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,159.654,166.724,"Of course, some of those other states didn't have your accompanying statutes, did they, the ones that have been declared invalid."
1984.83-812,0,29232,john_s_baker_jr,,166.724,170.01,Alabama had several statutes--
1984.83-812,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,170.01,171.36,--had a package.
1984.83-812,0,29232,john_s_baker_jr,,173.378,176.747,"--They were not passed as a package, Your Honor."
1984.83-812,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,200.712,209.635,"Well, my only point is that your Alabama situation may be somewhat different from Massachusetts or some of the others which have just the single statute."
1984.83-812,0,29232,john_s_baker_jr,,209.635,215.122,"--Your Honor, I think if you look at the legislative history in Massachusetts, you will find that there are certain parallels."
1984.83-812,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,231.381,233.583,Is this true of all the other 36 states?
1984.83-812,0,29232,john_s_baker_jr,,233.583,235.368,"--No, Your Honor, it is not true of all the other states."
1984.83-812,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,235.368,236.335,I didn't think it was.
1984.83-812,0,29232,john_s_baker_jr,,236.335,237.318,The issue in this--
1984.83-812,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,237.318,257.549,"Mr. Baker, may I inquire of whether the statute that Alabama already had providing for a period of silence not to exceed a minute would have been violated under state law by the use of that statute for silent prayer?"
1984.83-812,0,29232,john_s_baker_jr,,257.549,258.751,"--No, it would not have, Your Honor."
1984.83-812,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,277.279,279.814,May I ask one other question before you get into your argument?
1984.83-812,0,29232,john_s_baker_jr,,279.814,280.431,"--Justice Stevens, yes, sir."
1984.83-812,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,280.431,287.068,"As to the... similar to Justice O'Connor's question, the earlier statute, '78 statute, says that teachers shall announce."
1984.83-812,0,29232,john_s_baker_jr,,287.068,287.785,"Yes, Your Honor."
1984.83-812,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,287.785,289.937,"Whereas this one, the second statute, does not say that."
1984.83-812,0,29232,john_s_baker_jr,,293.822,304.113,"Your Honor, the first statute is still in effect, but the statutes are basically self-executing in the sense that the State Board of Education does not enforce the statutes."
1984.83-812,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,309.417,315.904,"But in the earlier statute, the one not challenged, the teacher was under an obligation, a mandatory obligation to make this announcement."
1984.83-812,0,29232,john_s_baker_jr,,317.487,326.878,"It is still true, Your Honor, but just to add, the first statute was in fact originally challenged by the Appellee in his Second Amendment complaint."
1984.83-812,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,331.514,333.282,I understand.
1984.83-812,0,29232,john_s_baker_jr,,333.282,342.655,"The difference between the Appellee and our own position on this question really comes down to the significance of the word ""prayer"" in the statute."
1984.83-812,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,628.142,634.629,"May I ask you a question here, too, because you point out there is a very narrow difference between the two statutes in constitutional terms."
1984.83-812,0,29232,john_s_baker_jr,,634.629,635.079,"Yes, sir."
1984.83-812,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,635.079,636.998,What is the practical difference between the two?
1984.83-812,0,29232,john_s_baker_jr,,640.299,656.959,"Your Honor, it was very clear from the testimony of the sponsoring legislator here that he was concerned that people did not understand that they had a right to pray silently in the classroom, and many people are under the impression apparently that students no longer even have the right to pray silently."
1984.83-812,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,728.056,732.392,"Mr. Baker, may I ask you another question because I am still troubled by the narrow difference between the two statutes."
1984.83-812,0,29232,john_s_baker_jr,,738.296,739.029,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1984.83-812,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,739.029,745.85,Is that... is it your view that the students in the classroom are aware of that purpose?
1984.83-812,0,29232,john_s_baker_jr,,745.85,747.819,Aware of the purpose that that is a--
1984.83-812,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,747.819,752.123,That that's the difference between the way it used to be before 1981 and the way it is after 1981?
1984.83-812,0,29232,john_s_baker_jr,,752.123,758.777,"--There's no indication in Mobile, for instance, that either statute has ever been implemented."
1984.83-812,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,771.934,777.321,So we don't know as a practical matter whether there is a difference between the two in their practical operation.
1984.83-812,0,29232,john_s_baker_jr,,777.321,782.058,"Not on this record we do not, Your Honor."
1984.83-812,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,826.235,830.539,How about the student that doesn't believe in prayer or meditation?
1984.83-812,0,29232,john_s_baker_jr,,830.539,834.657,"--That student can simply stand there for one minute, Your Honor."
1984.83-812,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,844.899,850.453,But there is no accommodation for him at all except that he can be standing there as an individual?
1984.83-812,0,29232,john_s_baker_jr,,850.453,851.685,"Exactly, Your Honor."
1984.83-812,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,863.093,866.045,May I ask why you say they will be standing?
1984.83-812,0,29232,john_s_baker_jr,,870.18,872.299,"You are perfectly correct, Your Honor, you are perfectly correct."
1984.83-812,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,884.924,892.445,"They would stand for the Pledge of Allegiance, I suppose, and then maybe continue this, or would the prayer come first, the moment of silence come first?"
1984.83-812,0,29232,john_s_baker_jr,,892.445,896.081,"The statute does not indicate any order, Your Honor."
1984.83-812,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,899.266,904.753,Would you be making the same argument if the statute said not exceeding five minutes?
1984.83-812,0,29232,john_s_baker_jr,,904.753,911.157,"Your Honor, the statute does deal only with one minute and not five minutes."
1984.83-812,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,930.871,932.689,May I ask one other question?
1984.83-812,0,29232,john_s_baker_jr,,943.045,949.216,"Your Honor, I think that raises the question of equal access, which is not this statute, it is a different statute."
1984.83-812,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,954.936,959.674,My question was whether you think the state's purpose would be equally well served by such a statute.
1984.83-812,0,29232,john_s_baker_jr,,959.674,964.226,"That might be one of the ways to serve it, and I think it would be constitutional, but I think this is equally--"
1984.83-812,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,964.226,967.511,The question is whether you think it would be equally well served by such a statute.
1984.83-812,0,29232,john_s_baker_jr,,967.511,970.38,"--Your Honor, I think that is a policy judgment for the legislature to make."
1984.83-812,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,970.38,983.039,"You are not willing to answer my question, I guess, whether you as advocating the constitutionality of this type of statute think that the state's purpose would be equally well served by such a statute."
1984.83-812,0,29232,john_s_baker_jr,,983.039,991.978,"I think there are some students who want to start the main work of the day during a minute of silence, and prior to class that is not starting the main work of the day."
1984.83-812,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,999.565,1001.501,Mr. Bator?
1984.83-812,1,37751,paul_m_bator,,1001.501,1004.469,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1984.83-812,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1050.414,1060.888,"Mr. Bator, if the teacher chooses to have a moment of silence, must the teacher say what it is for?"
1984.83-812,1,37751,paul_m_bator,,1060.888,1073.029,"The statute doesn't specify, Your Honor, and I think that it simply remains in the future to see whether this teacher will make some explanation of what it is all about."
1984.83-812,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1073.829,1086.754,"Well, isn't it... wouldn't the issue change a little at least if the teacher had to announce what it was for, or that it is discretionary?"
1984.83-812,1,37751,paul_m_bator,,1086.754,1090.991,--We don't believe that it would matter constitutionally.
1984.83-812,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1090.991,1098.579,"Well, I know, I know you believe that, but wouldn't the issue be... wouldn't it have a different, a little bit different ring to it?"
1984.83-812,1,37751,paul_m_bator,,1098.579,1099.013,Maybe.
1984.83-812,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1113.504,1127.498,"Also, may I ask, when this case started, the attack was on the teachers' practices in the school of having a prayer, wasn't it?"
1984.83-812,1,37751,paul_m_bator,,1128.264,1135.704,"I think the original lawsuit challenged what went on, what was alleged to go on in some Alabama schools, which was vocal prayer."
1984.83-812,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1135.704,1145.725,"Well, what is the case or controversy between... what was the case or controversy with respect to the moment of silence statute?"
1984.83-812,1,37751,paul_m_bator,,1152.898,1159.719,"Well, Your Honor, the lawsuit was brought to enjoin the state authorities--"
1984.83-812,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1159.719,1164.789,"Well, I know you just can't page through a statute book and pick out some statute you don't like and sue to enjoin it."
1984.83-812,1,37751,paul_m_bator,,1174.245,1181.465,"--The case or controversy, as I understand it, Your Honor, was that the plaintiff said that it violates the Constitution for the state--"
1984.83-812,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1181.465,1183.984,"Well, I know, but it had never been applied to them."
1984.83-812,1,37751,paul_m_bator,,1183.984,1191.856,"--Well, the suit was brought very shortly after the new statute was passed and the complaint was amended to challenge it."
1984.83-812,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1208.318,1215.639,"Well, it may be that the District Court made a mistake in saying there was a case or controversy."
1984.83-812,1,37751,paul_m_bator,,1215.639,1224.594,"That may be, Your Honor, but the District Court and the Eleventh Circuit concluded that this statute is unconstitutional on its face, and it is--"
1984.83-812,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1224.594,1230.565,"Well, were there allegations in the complaint that the statute was about to put the statute into operation?"
1984.83-812,1,37751,paul_m_bator,,1230.565,1233.433,"--I don't know, Your Honor, I don't know, Your Honor."
1984.83-812,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1233.433,1257.549,"Mr. Bator, there is no question that the purpose of this, that it was not for silence, or am I wrong, does the teacher have a right in the public schools of Mobile to tell the children to shut up for the next five minutes, and I don't want to hear a sound out of you, without a statute?"
1984.83-812,1,37751,paul_m_bator,,1260.333,1262.817,"It may be that they were free to do that, but what this statute--"
1984.83-812,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1262.817,1263.618,You say maybe?
1984.83-812,1,37751,paul_m_bator,,1269.372,1277.712,"--Your Honor, the statute institutionalizes and puts the sanction of state policy behind a practice."
1984.83-812,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1277.712,1283.097,The state policy is that you can have a moment of silence for prayer.
1984.83-812,1,37751,paul_m_bator,,1283.097,1295.924,"The state policy is that you may start the school day for a moment of silence within which so minded students who are under a claim of conscience have an opportunity to pray or meditate, all--"
1984.83-812,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1295.924,1304.16,Didn't they have that right before the statute?
1984.83-812,1,37751,paul_m_bator,,1304.16,1305.612,--I suppose.
1984.83-812,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1309.914,1317.67,"Well, didn't the children in Alabama have the right to pray silently before the statute was passed?"
1984.83-812,1,37751,paul_m_bator,,1317.67,1337.501,"Yes, Your Honor, it is the case that without this statute, long before this statute, after this statute, children have a right in the Alabama schools to pray silently, and of course, in that sense it is false to say what is always said, that it is this statute that has brought prayer in to the Alabama schools."
1984.83-812,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1360.532,1362.749,"Mr. Bator, let me just be sure I understand the point you are making."
1984.83-812,1,37751,paul_m_bator,,1367.286,1368.42,"--Either one, either one."
1984.83-812,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1368.42,1375.642,And you think the difference between a moment of meditation and the wording in the other is what creates this change.
1984.83-812,1,37751,paul_m_bator,,1375.642,1376.426,"No, Your Honor."
1984.83-812,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1381.196,1389.616,"And you said, when you mentioned the three points... and I want to be sure I get a chance to ask you this... that there was an informational purpose to the new statute because it added the word ""prayer""."
1984.83-812,1,37751,paul_m_bator,,1395.003,1397.789,--We think it became the public policy of the state--
1984.83-812,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1397.789,1402.443,"And there was information conveyed to the students, to the teachers, or to the citizenry at large?"
1984.83-812,1,37751,paul_m_bator,,1402.443,1405.645,"--It simply reaffirmed to the world at large, to the schools--"
1984.83-812,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1405.645,1406.828,"No, you said there was a change."
1984.83-812,1,37751,paul_m_bator,,1414.751,1419.821,"--Your Honor, we think the message was sent to everyone who looks at the statute or was informed about it."
1984.83-812,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1429.51,1433.978,Is it your view that that message did or did not reach the students in the classroom?
1984.83-812,1,37751,paul_m_bator,,1433.978,1435.447,"--We don't have a record, Your Honor."
1984.83-812,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1437.282,1441.168,I am just trying to understand what your point was about this informational purpose of the statute.
1984.83-812,1,37751,paul_m_bator,,1441.168,1454.828,"Your Honor, the point I was addressing when I was responding to Justice Marshall was that quite aside from a formal moment of silence, students may pray during snatches of inactivity during the day--"
1984.83-812,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1454.828,1457.328,Which they could have done under the old statute.
1984.83-812,1,37751,paul_m_bator,,1457.328,1458.113,--What the--
1984.83-812,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1458.113,1463.315,"But you are saying this statute is different because of its informational content, and I don't understand your argument."
1984.83-812,1,37751,paul_m_bator,,1463.315,1468.651,"--Without the old statute, without the new statute, without any statute."
1984.83-812,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1530.059,1541.434,"Yes, but Mr. Bator, the question is whether the new statute and the difference between the new and the old, is subject to attack or not, and you are... all of your arguments would apply to the earlier statute."
1984.83-812,1,37751,paul_m_bator,,1541.434,1546.837,We think there is no constitutionally relevant distinction between the two statutes.
1984.83-812,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1546.837,1551.555,"Do you think that the new statute accomplished any significant legislative purpose, and if so, what?"
1984.83-812,1,37751,paul_m_bator,,1551.555,1551.972,Yes.
1984.83-812,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1606.876,1626.205,"On the point that was raised in some of the earlier questions, Mr. Bator, is there any mechanism by which the State of Alabama could have applied to some Court for a construction of this statute in order to enable the state to instruct its teachers?"
1984.83-812,1,37751,paul_m_bator,,1626.205,1632.026,"Your Honor, I don't know whether there is a formal mechanism available, and maybe there might have been."
1984.83-812,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1651.238,1657.725,"Mr. Bator, that judgment or injunction does not extend to the earlier statute, I take it."
1984.83-812,1,37751,paul_m_bator,,1658.025,1679.174,"No, Your Honor, it doesn't, but we don't... we don't think it can be the law that it is all right to knock down a constitutional statute because there is another constitutional statute which to some extent covers the same ground."
1984.83-812,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1679.174,1680.49,Mr. Williams?
1984.83-812,2,40693,ronnie_l_williams,,1680.49,1683.626,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1984.83-812,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1805.154,1811.725,"Mr. Williams, let me ask you for a moment about the case in controversy problem which Justice White raised with your opponent."
1984.83-812,2,40693,ronnie_l_williams,,1833.507,1843.863,"No, initially, when this case first started, the activity being complained about was teacher-led group, vocal prayer in the public school system."
1984.83-812,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1881.504,1885.956,"Then it was enjoined before it could actually be put into effect, the '82 statute."
1984.83-812,2,40693,ronnie_l_williams,,1885.956,1888.075,"No, the '82 statute was already in effect."
1984.83-812,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1888.075,1890.927,"And what, people were acting under it?"
1984.83-812,2,40693,ronnie_l_williams,,1890.927,1893.879,"Well, that was the indication that we had received."
1984.83-812,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2008.485,2018.959,"Mr. Williams, do you take the position that the earlier statute is invalid on its face, unconstitutional on its face?"
1984.83-812,2,40693,ronnie_l_williams,,2018.959,2020.376,The '78 statute?
1984.83-812,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2020.376,2020.845,Yes.
1984.83-812,2,40693,ronnie_l_williams,,2020.845,2022.195,"No, I do not take that position."
1984.83-812,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2028.649,2039.472,"Well, I know officially you haven't, but I am asking you whether you believe it is valid, facially, the earlier statute?"
1984.83-812,2,40693,ronnie_l_williams,,2039.472,2048.645,"--I think I would take the position that it is valid on its face, just a simple moment of silence for meditation to do whatever you will, which may include prayer as well."
1984.83-812,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2112.386,2131.882,"Mr. Williams, suppose the teacher said at the opening of the class, we now have a moment when we will all remain silent to collect your thoughts and think about why you are here in school, any problems with that?"
1984.83-812,2,40693,ronnie_l_williams,,2131.882,2136.584,A moment of silence just to think about why we are here in school?
1984.83-812,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2137.703,2138.986,Mm-hmm.
1984.83-812,2,40693,ronnie_l_williams,,2140.738,2142.188,"They are, indeed."
1984.83-812,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2161.418,2171.357,"Is she telling them any more than the First Amendment guarantees to every person in this country, man, woman and child?"
1984.83-812,2,40693,ronnie_l_williams,,2171.357,2178.53,"--Well, I'm not so sure that that's the job of the teacher or the government explain each and every law."
1984.83-812,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2178.53,2185.6,"Well, aren't we supposed to be teaching the children about the Constitution and about freedom of press and freedom of speech?"
1984.83-812,2,40693,ronnie_l_williams,,2185.6,2206.347,"Certainly, I think that would be fine in a subject matter context, in a curriculum context, but during a moment of silence, every day, day in and day out, when the school bell rings, I think that is more than just teaching children about what the First Amendment stands for, what its protections and prohibitions are."
1984.83-812,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2232.581,2241.02,"Do you think... do you think the teacher could tell the children, you may meditate, but you may not pray silently?"
1984.83-812,2,40693,ronnie_l_williams,,2241.02,2258.046,"--No, I don't think a teacher... I think that would be a violation of the Constitution as well, stepping across the line of neutrality the other way, showing a preference to the nonbeliever or possibly some other religious groups that do not have prayer as part of their religious tenet."
1984.83-812,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2272.89,2274.823,Mr. Williams--
1984.83-812,2,40693,ronnie_l_williams,,2274.823,2275.623,--discouraging one.
1984.83-812,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2275.623,2277.458,--May I ask you a question?
1984.83-812,2,40693,ronnie_l_williams,,2277.458,2277.958,Certainly.
1984.83-812,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2277.958,2284.512,What establishment of religion do you think this statute promotes?
1984.83-812,2,40693,ronnie_l_williams,,2284.512,2294.819,I think principally I would have to say the Christian religion as to a religion that is being established.
1984.83-812,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2294.819,2297.421,The Christian religion?
1984.83-812,2,40693,ronnie_l_williams,,2297.421,2297.971,Well--
1984.83-812,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2297.971,2298.671,What was your answer?
1984.83-812,2,40693,ronnie_l_williams,,2299.288,2300.473,"--I did say Christian religion, yes."
1984.83-812,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2300.473,2305.694,How many religious faiths are practiced in Alabama?
1984.83-812,2,40693,ronnie_l_williams,,2305.694,2306.644,I'm sorry?
1984.83-812,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2306.644,2310.413,Do you know how many religious faiths are practiced in Alabama?
1984.83-812,2,40693,ronnie_l_williams,,2310.413,2311.848,"No, I do not know the total number."
1984.83-812,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2311.848,2313.181,"There would be hundreds, wouldn't there?"
1984.83-812,2,40693,ronnie_l_williams,,2313.181,2313.615,Certainly.
1984.83-812,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2315.067,2318.752,Any particular one of those furthered by this statute?
1984.83-812,2,40693,ronnie_l_williams,,2318.752,2322.637,I think religion generally is being furthered by this statute.
1984.83-812,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2322.637,2325.923,This big... the First Amendment doesn't say that.
1984.83-812,2,40693,ronnie_l_williams,,2348.521,2351.056,I would say yes in the sense that--
1984.83-812,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2351.056,2351.973,Which one?
1984.83-812,2,40693,ronnie_l_williams,,2351.973,2356.81,"--Well, I couldn't identify them all, but I was about to say that any religion--"
1984.83-812,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2356.81,2358.36,It furthers all of them?
1984.83-812,2,40693,ronnie_l_williams,,2358.36,2359.012,--Pardon me?
1984.83-812,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2359.012,2360.879,It furthers several hundred establishments.
1984.83-812,2,40693,ronnie_l_williams,,2360.879,2366.5,"Those that deal with prayer or have prayer as part of their religious worship exercises, I would--"
1984.83-812,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2366.5,2370.554,Do you think that is consistent with the language of the First Amendment?
1984.83-812,2,40693,ronnie_l_williams,,2370.554,2371.704,"--No, I do not."
1984.83-812,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2390.765,2405.941,"On the other hand, the government certainly has a duty to, as you have already recognized, to make sure that people have their right to exercise whichever religion they prefer."
1984.83-812,2,40693,ronnie_l_williams,,2410.245,2412.845,"No, because I think--"
1984.83-812,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2412.845,2414.781,Go right ahead.
1984.83-812,2,40693,ronnie_l_williams,,2416.415,2432.075,"--Well, if Alabama simply had a silent meditation or prayer statute, no other statute, quite possibly... no, I don't think even... I don't even think in that situation."
1984.83-812,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2456.208,2472.9,"As sort of a practical matter, do you think many children of school age are going to be thinking about prayer when they have this moment of silence, or will they be thinking about the next athletic contest or the next date or the next party or whatever?"
1984.83-812,2,40693,ronnie_l_williams,,2476.685,2478.504,That is correct.
1984.83-812,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2500.384,2504.771,"Mr. Williams, let me ask you a question about one of your responses to Justice Powell."
1984.83-812,2,40693,ronnie_l_williams,,2533.041,2534.058,That is correct.
1984.83-812,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2534.058,2550.752,"So this kind of constitutional right to pray at any moment is always subject to the overriding concerns of the educational program of the school, I suppose, unless there is some sort of a statute that says there is a moment at the beginning when you can pray or do something else."
1984.83-812,2,40693,ronnie_l_williams,,2550.752,2574.701,"Well, a teacher, certainly during a period of time in which the student is not actually engaged in the pursuit of knowledge, I would think that he could take time to silently pray, but I don't think a child has a constitutional right to, when a teacher asks him what is five plus four, to ask the teacher for a brief moment to go and pray and then come back and respond to the question."
1984.83-812,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2610.706,2615.843,"Mr. Williams, can I ask you a question about the difference between the two statutes again, as a practical matter?"
1984.83-812,2,40693,ronnie_l_williams,,2635.237,2641.66,"--I think so, and not just to the... Mr. Jaffree's minor children in school."
1984.83-812,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2651.349,2653.032,"Well, how do we know the teacher is going to suggest that?"
1984.83-812,2,40693,ronnie_l_williams,,2656.551,2657.134,--No.
1984.83-812,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2657.653,2663.84,Could not the teacher comply with the new statute by continuing to follow whatever practice he or she followed under the old statute?
1984.83-812,2,40693,ronnie_l_williams,,2663.84,2664.773,--That is correct.
1984.83-812,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2664.773,2668.625,Then how does the new statute hurt your clients?
1984.83-812,2,40693,ronnie_l_williams,,2668.625,2687.938,"I think it is public perception, and I think with the fanfare of this whole thing, I think with having a statute that provides for meditation and then turning right around a few years later and having a very similar statute but simply adding prayer, I think gives perception to those who are interested--"
1984.83-812,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2687.938,2690.057,Do you think that makes your case or controversy?
1984.83-812,2,40693,ronnie_l_williams,,2690.057,2696.961,--I think what makes the case or controversy is that this is not the business of the state at all to be engaged in promoting religion.
1984.83-812,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2696.961,2700.18,"Well, I know, but as Justice Stevens asked you, how does it hurt?"
1984.83-812,2,40693,ronnie_l_williams,,2721.843,2722.595,To my knowledge--
1984.83-812,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2722.595,2726.063,"Nobody knows if it has ever been applied yet, do you?"
1984.83-812,2,40693,ronnie_l_williams,,2726.063,2727.847,"--Well, it is not on the record."
1984.83-812,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2742.656,2766.438,"Well, in the long run, Mr. Williams, to go back to that point, is the teacher telling the students if they do so any more than what the Constitution guarantees, that is, that they may indulge in a few moments of silent prayer if they want to?"
1984.83-812,2,40693,ronnie_l_williams,,2766.438,2794.855,"Yes, I think that the teacher may in effect be telling a child no more, or the class no more than what the Constitution provides, but I think by the teacher, a state through the teacher engaging in that behavior suggests more to some students than possibly to others, may suggest that prayer is the preferred activity during this one moment of meditation."
1984.83-812,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2795.271,2814.169,"What if the teacher tells them while you are in the classroom you may not whisper or speak to the other students, you will only speak when you are called upon, but when you go out on the playground or out in the hall, then the Constitution guarantees you the right of freedom of speech?"
1984.83-812,2,40693,ronnie_l_williams,,2816.052,2819.989,"--No, I see nothing wrong with that, but there is no--"
1984.83-812,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2819.989,2821.823,"There is no religious aspect to that, of course, but--"
1984.83-812,2,40693,ronnie_l_williams,,2821.823,2823.041,--You've got it.
1984.83-812,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2830.261,2842.319,"--In either situation of these two postulated statements, a statement of what the Constitution of the United States guarantees, is it not?"
1984.83-812,2,40693,ronnie_l_williams,,2842.319,2845.538,--That's correct.
1984.83-812,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2845.538,2849.592,"You may speak, you may pray."
1984.83-812,2,40693,ronnie_l_williams,,2849.592,2863.5,"A teacher is speaking of things that the Constitution do... does provide, but I think the danger, or the difference is that one statute prohibits the teacher or prohibits the state from engaging in that type of activity."
1984.83-812,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2863.5,2873.04,"Suppose under the first statute, just the moment of silence statute, without the word ""prayer"" in it, just meditation--"
1984.83-812,2,40693,ronnie_l_williams,,2873.04,2873.49,Yes.
1984.83-812,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2873.49,2879.044,--Which I think you indicated previously you thought was facially valid.
1984.83-812,2,40693,ronnie_l_williams,,2879.044,2879.661,That is correct.
1984.83-812,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2879.661,2886.215,"Suppose the teacher does say, we are now going to have a meditation, a minute of meditation."
1984.83-812,2,40693,ronnie_l_williams,,2899.608,2900.708,I would think so.
1984.83-812,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2908.029,2916.384,"Well, isn't that the state... then isn't the state involving itself in religion by saying yes, you may pray as well as meditate?"
1984.83-812,2,40693,ronnie_l_williams,,2916.384,2917.152,"Well, I think as--"
1984.83-812,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2917.152,2921.354,"And after all, that's all the statute does is say you may pray as well as meditate."
1984.83-812,2,40693,ronnie_l_williams,,2921.354,2929.21,"--No, I think when it becomes part of a statute, part of a law, and something that is supposed to be done, that it is impermissible."
1984.83-812,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2929.21,2929.96,"Well, it doesn't say you are supposed to."
1984.83-812,2,40693,ronnie_l_williams,,2932.746,2947.022,"That is correct, but by the statute, but having the statute itself suggests that whenever a teacher does do it, that teacher will be suggesting or implying that prayer is the preferred activity."
1984.83-812,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2960.496,2977.791,"Mr. Williams, the Internal Revenue Code provides special exemptions for churches and religions, and local statutes provide exemption from property taxation for churches."
1984.83-812,2,40693,ronnie_l_williams,,2990.099,2994.736,"No, I think those statutes are perfectly consistent with the constitutional--"
1984.83-812,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2994.736,3005.442,"You think they do not promote religion to the same extent, perhaps a far greater extent than this little statute that you are debating here today?"
1984.83-812,2,40693,ronnie_l_williams,,3005.442,3012.448,"--I think, as this Court has held in prior cases, incidental benefits to religion does not necessarily constitute--"
1984.83-812,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3012.448,3015.4,Is there incidental benefit to being tax exempt?
1984.83-812,2,40693,ronnie_l_williams,,3015.4,3018.452,"--Well, if all nonprofit--"
1984.83-812,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3018.452,3020.052,I'd like to enjoy it.
1984.83-812,2,40693,ronnie_l_williams,,3049.037,3052.775,"--Yes, the District judge did say that."
1984.83-812,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3055.525,3057.377,But you don't agree with the District judge on that.
1984.83-812,2,40693,ronnie_l_williams,,3057.377,3060.195,"--No, I don't."
1984.83-812,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3099.237,3121.483,"Mr. Williams, do you think that every statute that is worded in the terms of this one would be invalid facially regardless of the evidence surrounding the purpose of its adoption?"
1984.83-812,2,40693,ronnie_l_williams,,3121.483,3124.452,That's a difficult question.
1984.83-812,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3152.538,3167.547,Your answer then is that you think that a statute worded as this one would be constitutionally invalid regardless of the evidence surrounding the intention of its adoption.
1984.83-812,2,40693,ronnie_l_williams,,3167.547,3168.064,Yes.
1984.83-812,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3184.574,3201.603,Is that consistent with your response to Justice White's question that it would be constitutionally valid for a teacher to inform the students that they may use the moment to pray?
1984.83-812,2,40693,ronnie_l_williams,,3201.603,3202.554,I think it would be consistent.
1984.83-812,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3324.249,3324.749,Very well.
1984.83-812,3,29232,john_s_baker_jr,,3328.118,3329.068,"Just briefly, Your Honor."
1984.83-812,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3344.497,3346.147,Do you want to indicate the paragraph you are talking about?
1984.83-812,3,29232,john_s_baker_jr,,3346.147,3346.797,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1984.83-812,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3383.622,3398.882,"Mr. Baker, let me just be sure I understand your reference to 32(f) there, which reads that pursuant to the grant of authority contained in 16-1-20.1, Defendants, and they name the teachers, have led their classes in religiously based prayer activities."
1984.83-812,3,29232,john_s_baker_jr,,3402.25,3403.15,"No, Your Honor."
1984.83-812,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3403.15,3406.536,"Well, then, how do we... so you don't admit that is a correct allegation."
