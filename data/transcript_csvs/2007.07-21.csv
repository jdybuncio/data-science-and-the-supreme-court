2007.07-21,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,13.324,"We'll hear argument first today in Case 07-21 and 07-25, Crawford v. Marion County Election Board and Indiana Democratic Party v. Secretary Rokita."
2007.07-21,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,14.341,23.948,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This case involves a law that directly burdens our most fundamental right, the right to vote."
2007.07-21,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,63.256,66.642,"Before... before we get to that, can we talk about standing a little?"
2007.07-21,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,70.71,77.6,"There are many plaintiffs, Your Honor, including the ones that the courts below found have standing, the Democratic Party."
2007.07-21,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,77.6,79.785,Courts below are sometimes wrong.
2007.07-21,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,79.785,84.37,"Yes, Your Honor, absolutely, and especially when I'm a petitioner I agree with you on that."
2007.07-21,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,97.414,101.549,"Well, they still have to identify individuals who are members."
2007.07-21,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,105.434,111.255,"Your Honor, in Indiana you become a member of the Democratic Party by participating in party affairs."
2007.07-21,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,122.812,129.466,I thought... I thought they took the position that anybody who voted or intended to vote Democratic is a member of the Democratic Party.
2007.07-21,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,129.466,134.27,"Well, there are different degrees of membership, different ways to become a member, as this Court has recognized--"
2007.07-21,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,134.27,153.748,Is there any way in which you can say... and I thought this was the theory of associational standing... that this individual has voluntarily given this organization the right to represent that person for particular purposes?
2007.07-21,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,153.748,158.216,"--There is no formal method of induction as you would have in the Elk's Club or something, Your Honor."
2007.07-21,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,168.774,174.494,But that doesn't mean that I'm willing to have the Democratic Party represent me for all sorts of purposes.
2007.07-21,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,185.283,196.525,Because they have... the Democratic Party is an association of people joined together to elect candidates of a particular kind and those people include many people who are burdened by this law.
2007.07-21,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,200.91,210.335,"As I understand it, though, Mr. Smith, the trial court didn't rely on, simply on the associational standing of the Democratic Party, did it?"
2007.07-21,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,210.335,211.118,"No, that's correct, Your Honor."
2007.07-21,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,227.729,234.116,And is doing so by forcing them to get people properly identified.
2007.07-21,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,234.116,237.818,"Extend resources getting people, get their identification."
2007.07-21,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,252.911,254.861,That organization had members.
2007.07-21,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,257.663,258.163,"Well, Your Honor--"
2007.07-21,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,258.163,262.099,"And they identified members who would be, who would be annoyed by the noise."
2007.07-21,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,262.099,265.635,"--I'd note, Your Honor, that in the Hunt case itself there were no members."
2007.07-21,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,286.399,291.436,I just think it's hard to confine your rationale if you say that any association could sue.
2007.07-21,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,301.091,319.453,"--Well Your Honor, the thing that confines the rationale is it has to be something that relates as well to the purpose of the organization, of the association, the reason why these people are bound together as a group, and that is of course to get people to vote and vote to support... support the goals of the organization, support the candidates, the nominees of the organization."
2007.07-21,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,319.453,331.111,"We can limit your standing argument to... I guess it's based on the affidavits of Ms. Holland and Ms. Smith, the one who is a clerk for the Democratic Party and the other who is a judge for the Democratic Party."
2007.07-21,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,337.082,349.991,"But we also have other people in the record, Your Honor... for example, Theresa Clemente, others who are active poll workers, activists in the party, who... had been polled and found that they didn't have IDs and that they would be burdened by the difficulty of getting IDs."
2007.07-21,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,392.782,393.198,Excuse me.
2007.07-21,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,398.852,399.152,--No.
2007.07-21,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,408.208,411.269,"Exactly, Democrats in particular, I suppose."
2007.07-21,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,411.269,419.065,A great deal of evidence in the record of the burdens that are imposed on people who try to comply with this law and continue exercising their constitutional right to vote.
2007.07-21,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,419.065,430.923,"Well, I understood Judge Barker to say that you had not come up with a single instance of somebody who was denied the right to vote because they didn't have a photo ID."
2007.07-21,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,430.923,435.444,"Well, Your Honor, the record in this case was made when an election had not yet happened."
2007.07-21,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,453.488,456.19,So elections were conducted under this law?
2007.07-21,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,456.19,462.944,"--I'm not even... there were a couple of hundred people that had voted under the law, but nobody else had yet, at that point."
2007.07-21,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,464.194,467.648,"Well, did you have anybody who said, I don't have a voter ID?"
2007.07-21,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,467.648,468.398,"--Yes, we did, Your Honor."
2007.07-21,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,468.398,473.134,"I plan to come in this next election, I plan to vote, and I don't have a voter ID card?"
2007.07-21,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,473.134,474.336,"Yes, we did, Your Honor."
2007.07-21,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,494.632,502.303,"But why... and they're not going to be able to get one even though the State will provide them with one if they don't have one, subject to some identification?"
2007.07-21,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,502.303,503.238,"Yes, Your Honor."
2007.07-21,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,520.548,533.224,"Well, is it your position that a State can't require any form of identification and can only require a signature, or would some lesser form of identification than Indiana has required be constitutional?"
2007.07-21,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,533.224,537.476,"Your Honor, it may well be possible that there's certain situations that it could require it."
2007.07-21,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,550.569,551.886,What was the answer to my question?
2007.07-21,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,557.123,566.162,"If it's readily available and not especially burdensome and there is some reason to think that it is preventing a fraud of some sort, serving some--"
2007.07-21,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,566.162,574.101,"But clearly you answer all of those questions that you've just posed, that you've just responded with, ""no""."
2007.07-21,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,577.036,578.019,"--Well, Your Honor, it is true--"
2007.07-21,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,578.019,588.175,"Although that leads to the next question, is whether or not there are ways in which the... the central purpose of this law can be preserved but it could be less stringent."
2007.07-21,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,590.861,600.985,"--Well, it is certainly true that, in fact, there is no evidence in this record of any significant amount of fraud that is still occurring with the existing system of voter identification."
2007.07-21,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,600.985,604.387,That wasn't... that wasn't the problem I had with your answer to that question.
2007.07-21,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,622.415,625.35,I think... I think that the current system works just fine.
2007.07-21,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,632.438,632.89,Mr. Smith--
2007.07-21,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,632.89,633.94,Your answer is no.
2007.07-21,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,633.94,634.823,"Yes, Your Honor."
2007.07-21,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,634.823,656.153,"--suppose at the time of registration there was a photograph taken right in the registration place and on the spot they gave you an ID with that photo, and everybody who registers would get one and there isn't any question of paying money to get a birth certificate."
2007.07-21,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,670.213,675.717,"If you had a world in which that were true, Your Honor, I think that would be potentially constitutional."
2007.07-21,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,677.402,679.035,That would be potentially constitutional?
2007.07-21,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,679.035,679.502,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2007.07-21,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,679.502,680.471,Okay.
2007.07-21,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,683.973,690.893,"Well, I was assuming that we would make some additional exemptions for particular people with those kinds of problems, if people can't have one."
2007.07-21,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,697.546,701.1,"Well, do we know that that religious exemption won't be made?"
2007.07-21,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,701.1,701.75,"Excuse me, Your Honor?"
2007.07-21,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,701.75,704.802,Do we know that that religious exemption won't be made?
2007.07-21,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,706.754,707.688,"No, I'm not... I'm not--"
2007.07-21,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,707.688,708.421,"No, no."
2007.07-21,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,722.698,724.164,--I must be misunderstanding.
2007.07-21,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,741.009,742.427,"And you could, you could do it twice."
2007.07-21,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,747.129,751.283,"Either way, your real voting place is going to be the county clerk's office in the county seat, forever."
2007.07-21,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,755.252,759.471,"Well, how far away is the furthest county seat for somebody in the county,--"
2007.07-21,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,759.471,759.889,--I don't know the--
2007.07-21,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,759.889,762.758,--County seats aren't very far for people in Indiana.
2007.07-21,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,762.758,763.325,--No.
2007.07-21,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,774.648,777.767,It's not a burden if you're not indigent?
2007.07-21,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,777.767,781.386,"--Well, it's... it's less of a burden, Your Honor, considerably less of a burden."
2007.07-21,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,781.769,784.288,17 miles is 17 miles for the rich and the poor.
2007.07-21,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,784.288,791.508,"--public transportation, because the person presumably has no access to an automobile because they don't have a driver's license and they're indigent and they're living in Gary, Indiana."
2007.07-21,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,791.508,796.729,We have... the record shows that fewer than 1 percent of people in Indiana don't have a photo ID.
2007.07-21,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,796.729,800.364,"That is not what the record shows, Your Honor, and it's not what the district court said."
2007.07-21,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,829.8,831.152,"Well, so do the voting rolls."
2007.07-21,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,832.969,833.385,"No, no."
2007.07-21,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,834.271,834.637,--Mr. Smith.
2007.07-21,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,834.637,835.021,--So sorry.
2007.07-21,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,835.021,841.441,--41.4 percent of the people on the voting rolls in Indiana were either dead or they were duplicate entries.
2007.07-21,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,841.441,843.66,But she wasn't looking at the voting rolls.
2007.07-21,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,849.881,857.302,Do you take issue with the 41.4 percent figure for bad entries on the voting registration rolls?
2007.07-21,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,857.302,858.919,"No, I have no reason to... it may have gotten better now."
2007.07-21,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,862.871,865.84,"And this is one of them, I suppose, requiring photo ID?"
2007.07-21,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,865.84,872.146,"--No, I was referring to actually cleaning up the voter rolls in compliance with the consent decree they signed with the United States."
2007.07-21,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,872.146,883.352,"Well, don't you think if you have the voter rolls with a significant number of bad registrants, either dead or duplicates, that that presents a significant potential for fraud?"
2007.07-21,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,883.352,883.887,I suppose.
2007.07-21,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,894.343,895.678,"Well, that's because it's less of an issue."
2007.07-21,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,911.787,913.806,"No, it's actually not, Your Honor."
2007.07-21,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,935.653,943.242,But the problem with the duplicate entries is there may be two entries for John Smith because John Smith has moved and the voter registration hasn't been updated.
2007.07-21,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,953.198,955.483,"--Well, the duplicates, presumably, are in two different places, right."
2007.07-21,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,985.502,989.973,The people who are dead or have moved away would certainly not be objecting.
2007.07-21,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,989.973,990.373,"No, Your Honor."
2007.07-21,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1001.864,1002.597,I wasn't talking about that.
2007.07-21,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,1009.934,1010.701,The question is--
2007.07-21,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1010.701,1018.523,"--and your assertion that, you know, it's not much of a problem because the person whom you're impersonating would find out about it."
2007.07-21,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,1026.895,1030.18,--It's certainly possible that someone could commit this kind of a crime.
2007.07-21,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1030.18,1031.146,I'd say likely.
2007.07-21,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,1031.146,1037.351,"Well, one of the things that makes it less likely is if you try to actually affect an election you need to sway a lot of votes."
2007.07-21,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1046.223,1050.161,"You don't really... I mean, that's what I wonder if there is no such evidence."
2007.07-21,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,1095.057,1095.523,--Your Honor--
2007.07-21,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1095.523,1097.159,"Now, what's your response to that?"
2007.07-21,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,1098.875,1104.145,"--First of all, on the point of the anecdotes, I would encourage you to look at the Brennan Center brief."
2007.07-21,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1104.145,1105.595,I know there are arguments on both sides.
2007.07-21,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,1128.261,1136.784,"Well, Your Honor, many kinds of fraud do get caught, and they are no more easily detected than this kind of fraud to be detected."
2007.07-21,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1143.203,1145.739,"Well, they say that's because you can't catch it."
2007.07-21,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,1145.739,1146.389,"--Well, but Your Honor--"
2007.07-21,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1146.389,1149.274,"How would you catch it, which is my question."
2007.07-21,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,1149.274,1154.711,"--First of all... first of all, you talk about deterring it."
2007.07-21,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1165.569,1180.813,"If this is not a problem at all, how do you account for the fact that the Commission on Federal Election Reform that was co chaired by former President Carter and former Secretary of State Baker recommended a voter ID requirement, and many other countries around the world have voter ID requirements?"
2007.07-21,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,1180.813,1193.12,"--What they recommended, Your Honor, is exactly what Justice Ginsburg anticipated, which is get everybody the cards, and then we'll be like Europe, and everything will work really fine, and it'll actually help the poor to have these IDs for a lot of other purposes."
2007.07-21,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1193.12,1215.469,"As I understand, they were going to have some years in between when their proposal was enacted, and they were going to have a mobile unit going around to all the neighborhoods, lots of advertising, because a premise of that Carter-Baker report was that everybody would easily and costlessly get this photo ID."
2007.07-21,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,1215.469,1233.346,"I would encourage the Court to refer to the Democratic Party Exhibit 18, which is an article by Carter, President Carter, and Secretary Baker, following on their report, saying, look, there's a problem here; that 12 percent of the voting age population of this country doesn't have a license; we did not recommend this being a mandatory thing until we get those licenses in those people's hands."
2007.07-21,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1233.346,1236.898,"Well, why would they even require that if it's not any problem at all?"
2007.07-21,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,1250.456,1253.844,Some States don't have signature matches.
2007.07-21,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1276.107,1276.89,They help you get it.
2007.07-21,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,1282.661,1289.617,"--But what the record shows is that 60 percent of the time, when people go in and ask for one, they get sent home, because they don't have the right documentation because the rules--"
2007.07-21,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1289.617,1295.421,What documentation did President Carter and Secretary Baker propose to require for their photo IDs?
2007.07-21,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,1295.421,1300.223,"--Your Honor, I think they were very strong on having this birth certificate requirement, as well."
2007.07-21,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1318.45,1341.4,"Well, if you concede that some kind of voter ID requirement is appropriate, the problem that I have is where you draw the line on a record like this where there's nothing to quantify in any way the extent of the problem or the extent of the burden, how many people will actually be prevented from voting or significantly burdened from voting as a result of the requirement?"
2007.07-21,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,1344.768,1347.47,"Well, it is a difficult area of the law for you for that reason, Justice Alito."
2007.07-21,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1384.627,1387.695,"Well, you're telling us that, you know, we've got to be careful and it's difficult."
2007.07-21,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,1392.333,1402.305,"--You are supposed to look at how difficult it is to get the ID, what assistance is provided or not being provided, how much it costs."
2007.07-21,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1402.305,1407.342,"Let's get down... let's get down to the question of quantification, which is one of the issues that he raised."
2007.07-21,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,1416.998,1422.268,The answer is that there's plenty of evidence in the record about the number of people in this country who don't have IDs.
2007.07-21,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1422.268,1423.618,"Well, let's talk about Indiana."
2007.07-21,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,1426.587,1445.517,"The best argument for Indiana is if you take the district court's 43,000 figure and you adjust it for the two factors, death and departure, that I mentioned before, the number becomes more like 400,000 people in the State of Indiana who lack IDs and are of voting age, eligible... voting age population people."
2007.07-21,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1445.517,1454.673,And how many of them are going to suffer from an unreasonable denial of an opportunity to get the ID which the State will provide through the Bureau of Motor Vehicles?
2007.07-21,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,1455.556,1458.991,It is obviously for each person a different matter of degree.
2007.07-21,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1468.583,1468.966,"Well, I know that."
2007.07-21,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,1477.855,1492.881,"Well, because you... you basically have to take into account all of those factors: How many people are potentially affected; how difficult it is; how similar it is to, say, a poll tax, for example, and say... and then look at what purpose is being served here."
2007.07-21,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1496.317,1498.601,"Okay, that's on... that's on the other side of the issue."
2007.07-21,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,1498.601,1499.118,--Right.
2007.07-21,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1499.118,1516.83,"But walk... walk us through... if you were writing the opinion and what you wanted to put in the opinion was a reasonable estimate of the number of people who are going to be substantially burdened in having... who do not now have the identification, substantially burdened in getting it."
2007.07-21,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,1522.816,1528.285,"Well, Your Honor, I would say of that 400,000 voting age people, probably about half of them are registered voters."
2007.07-21,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1543.813,1556.138,"Mr. Smith, is there anything in the record about the extent to which the political parties help people get their IDs, as they sometimes drive them to the polls for voting and so forth, the part they play in this process?"
2007.07-21,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,1556.138,1557.305,"--I'm not aware of anything, Your Honor."
2007.07-21,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1561.608,1568.028,Isn't it fair to presume that the parties would play a role in helping people get registered and getting to the polls?
2007.07-21,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,1568.028,1573.766,"--But, you know, what there is in the record, Your Honor, is the testimony from the Lafayette Urban Ministry, which helps the needy in Lafayette, Indiana."
2007.07-21,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1598.232,1601.167,"Thank you, Mr. Smith."
2007.07-21,1,42698,thomas_m_fisher,,1607.67,1616.526,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: There is no evidence in the record of any kind suggesting that 400,000 people in Indiana lack this form of identification."
2007.07-21,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1617.409,1627.248,"I take it you accept the figure of, what, about 50,000, to be further discounted by those who might vote absentee and so on?"
2007.07-21,1,42698,thomas_m_fisher,,1627.248,1628.416,--We've never had a problem.
2007.07-21,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1645.293,1648.078,"No, I just want to... I just want to know what your figure."
2007.07-21,1,42698,thomas_m_fisher,,1679.382,1685.003,"Well, I think we would say that that's the number... that's the number that could conceivably be inconvenienced by this law."
2007.07-21,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1721.143,1725.428,"Well, isn't that a little bit of a stretch, too, when you say ""infinitesimal""?"
2007.07-21,1,42698,thomas_m_fisher,,1743.725,1748.694,"And at that level, you're talking about less than a half a percent of the total electorate."
2007.07-21,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1749.945,1750.562,Okay.
2007.07-21,1,42698,thomas_m_fisher,,1766.855,1773.478,"--Well, if that's going to be the case, then you're going to have a big problem with voter registration, which is a far bigger problem for more voters."
2007.07-21,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1781.834,1798.959,"Well, we haven't endorsed... I mean, correct me if I'm wrong, but we haven't endorsed a registration procedure that would require as much documentation and as much travel as... as the... as this voter ID procedure would have."
2007.07-21,1,42698,thomas_m_fisher,,1798.959,1806.449,"--The point I'm making is that if we're going to look at the percent conceivably burdened by the law, then voter registration is called into question."
2007.07-21,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1818.607,1826.894,"And why, why can't the people injured by this law appear themselves and say the law can't be applied to us?"
2007.07-21,1,42698,thomas_m_fisher,,1842.722,1843.988,I agree with that.
2007.07-21,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1846.957,1857.482,Then why are we arguing about whether there is one half of one percent of the electorate who may be adversely affected and as to whom it might be unconstitutional?
2007.07-21,1,42698,thomas_m_fisher,,1880.763,1881.163,None.
2007.07-21,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1884.399,1896.79,"You agree that if you're going to take the... if this Court takes the Salerno standard, there can never be a facial challenge to a registration requirement, a voter ID requirement."
2007.07-21,1,42698,thomas_m_fisher,,1901.261,1902.494,"Well, I'm not sure that's the case."
2007.07-21,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1905.146,1911.383,"Salerno says unless there are no cases, the facial challenge is inappropriate."
2007.07-21,1,42698,thomas_m_fisher,,1917.804,1919.187,"--Well, I hope not."
2007.07-21,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1921.189,1922.522,"It never will be true, will it?"
2007.07-21,1,42698,thomas_m_fisher,,1922.522,1923.108,--Right.
2007.07-21,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1923.108,1927.325,"It never be... if that's going to be the standard, there will never be a facial challenge."
2007.07-21,1,42698,thomas_m_fisher,,1927.325,1930.777,"I'm not sure that that's terribly significant, because if you have an as applied challenge--"
2007.07-21,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1930.777,1932.396,"There never will be there one, will there?"
2007.07-21,1,42698,thomas_m_fisher,,1932.396,1934.748,--As to an as applied challenge?
2007.07-21,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1935.331,1939.866,"No, as to a pre enforcement facial challenge to a law like this."
2007.07-21,1,42698,thomas_m_fisher,,1939.866,1944.52,I think it could be pre enforcement and as applied in a way that could have ultimately--
2007.07-21,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1944.52,1945.753,"Yes, but I want you to answer my question."
2007.07-21,1,42698,thomas_m_fisher,,1945.753,1946.053,--I'm sorry.
2007.07-21,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1946.903,1947.972,"We're not going to have facial challenges here, are we?"
2007.07-21,1,42698,thomas_m_fisher,,1947.972,1948.322,Right.
2007.07-21,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1948.322,1948.889,Okay.
2007.07-21,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1948.889,1952.591,"Does that scare you, Mr. Fisher, that there can't be a facial challenge?"
2007.07-21,1,42698,thomas_m_fisher,,1952.591,1953.157,No.
2007.07-21,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1953.157,1958.677,"I mean, every facial challenge is an immense dictum on the part of this Court, isn't it?"
2007.07-21,1,42698,thomas_m_fisher,,1958.677,1959.31,I think that's right.
2007.07-21,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1959.31,1966.198,"This Court is sitting back and looking at the ceiling and saying, oh, we can envision not the case before us, but other cases."
2007.07-21,1,42698,thomas_m_fisher,,1979.758,1980.474,I should hope not.
2007.07-21,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1980.474,1982.46,"Now, we've done that in the First Amendment area."
2007.07-21,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1982.46,1985.395,That is not the case that you are confronting.
2007.07-21,1,42698,thomas_m_fisher,,1985.395,1985.878,That's right.
2007.07-21,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1985.878,1990.446,"I mean, the reason they are bringing a facial challenge is because the horse is going to be out of the barn."
2007.07-21,1,42698,thomas_m_fisher,,2077.219,2080.688,"With respect, Your Honor, for all we know, those may have been fraudulent ballots."
2007.07-21,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2085.056,2096.099,"It's the same board that said in all our experience, in all of our memory, there has never been an impersonator."
2007.07-21,1,42698,thomas_m_fisher,,2096.099,2102.169,"And that goes back to how we would know, because without an ID check, it's impossible to detect this kind of fraud."
2007.07-21,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2102.169,2104.205,"Well, if you're worried about fraud--"
2007.07-21,1,42698,thomas_m_fisher,,2104.205,2105.105,I'm sorry.
2007.07-21,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2105.105,2114.894,"--If you're worried about fraud, what I don't understand, and I'd like to track it through with you, is the registration system."
2007.07-21,1,42698,thomas_m_fisher,,2226.813,2230.532,"Well, because I think we want to have an idea that has some integrity to it."
2007.07-21,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2244.073,2251.213,"We are going to give... all we are doing is, we will give you the photo."
2007.07-21,1,42698,thomas_m_fisher,,2271.859,2281.132,"--I think again that we, on the front end part of it is we are hamstrung on how we can regulate voter registration, in part by the National Voter Registration Act."
2007.07-21,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2282.432,2283.767,I'm not arguing about that.
2007.07-21,1,42698,thomas_m_fisher,,2317.371,2320.757,I think in part it's the administrative apparatus.
2007.07-21,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2331.513,2337.217,Suppose you... you have your photograph taken when you register.
2007.07-21,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2357.38,2362.334,"But you don't... you don't have the photo identification required at registration, do you?"
2007.07-21,1,42698,thomas_m_fisher,,2362.334,2363.1,"No, we don't."
2007.07-21,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2364.084,2365.286,"You can't, can you?"
2007.07-21,1,42698,thomas_m_fisher,,2365.286,2368.504,I think there are problems with that.
2007.07-21,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2369.988,2378.877,"And even so is, there anything that prohibits the State from confirming the validity of the registration at the polling place?"
2007.07-21,1,42698,thomas_m_fisher,,2378.877,2379.244,--No.
2007.07-21,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2387.232,2391.934,Why wouldn't you have the same from in being sure the registration is correct?
2007.07-21,1,42698,thomas_m_fisher,,2392.734,2395.086,"--Well, we... well, I think we may very well, but I think the policy--"
2007.07-21,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2395.086,2397.138,Why wouldn't you require photo ID then?
2007.07-21,1,42698,thomas_m_fisher,,2397.138,2405.194,"--Well, I think the policy struck nationally, under the motor voter, is to have an easy registration system, so that it may be problematic to introduce additional limits."
2007.07-21,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2405.194,2408.911,Is it the policy to have it tougher to vote than to register?
2007.07-21,1,42698,thomas_m_fisher,,2410.061,2412.197,"Well, I think the theory is easy--"
2007.07-21,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2412.197,2416.751,The national policy it to make it both easy to register and easy to vote.
2007.07-21,1,42698,thomas_m_fisher,,2416.751,2421.803,"--Well, and tough to cheat, hopefully, is the backside of that, which is what the idea is trying to do."
2007.07-21,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2421.803,2433.511,"Mr. Fisher, you make... rely on the argument that 40 percent of the registrants... or not registrants, the people on the... yes, registrants... on the voter list are... are not accurate."
2007.07-21,1,42698,thomas_m_fisher,,2449.436,2457.676,"Well, I think that... that part of the responsibility there does lie again with the National Voter Registration Act which limits how we may maintain those lists."
2007.07-21,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2460.111,2464.179,I thought you were sued by the Federal Government because you did such a bad job.
2007.07-21,1,42698,thomas_m_fisher,,2464.179,2485.559,"--There may be... there's part of it is the responsibility on our end, but part of it is also the... the hoops we have to jump through pursuant to the National Voter Registration Act, and we've got a situation unfortunately where with inflated voter lists, with reports of fraud around the country, the General Assembly is generally concerned about voter confidence and the legitimacy of elections, and that's precisely what this law is trying to target."
2007.07-21,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2486.159,2492.313,How does Indiana stack up against other States in the inflation of the voter rolls?
2007.07-21,1,42698,thomas_m_fisher,,2492.313,2494.282,--We are among the most inflated.
2007.07-21,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2499.002,2502.188,And you are under a consent decree to do something about that?
2007.07-21,1,42698,thomas_m_fisher,,2502.188,2503.771,"That's right, and we are taking those steps."
2007.07-21,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2536.04,2546.781,"Well, are you making the argument that you can place a heavier burden on voters to identify themselves because your State officials refuse to follow the law?"
2007.07-21,1,42698,thomas_m_fisher,,2546.781,2548.05,"Well, I think it's part of it, is--"
2007.07-21,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2548.05,2549.9,I think that's the argument you were just making.
2007.07-21,1,42698,thomas_m_fisher,,2549.9,2550.316,--Well--
2007.07-21,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2550.316,2555.32,"Even when we identify the duplicates, the local officials are still leaving them in the polls."
2007.07-21,1,42698,thomas_m_fisher,,2558.922,2575.35,"--Well, I think the larger point is that when we've got a situation where there is an obvious gap in security at the polls, where the public expects to show ID... and... as they would in any ordinary, everyday situation... that is going to create a lack of confidence, particularly when combined with what we have ended up with."
2007.07-21,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2575.35,2581.271,But you're still making the argument that there's a lack of confidence because our local officials won't cull the rolls of dead voters.
2007.07-21,1,42698,thomas_m_fisher,,2581.271,2581.921,Not explicitly.
2007.07-21,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2587.858,2593.995,"Maybe there is a reasonable, obvious step you can take to make your officials obey the law when you tell them how to do it."
2007.07-21,1,42698,thomas_m_fisher,,2593.995,2597.047,"Well, we are limited even at that by the NVRA."
2007.07-21,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2597.047,2597.381,Now wait a minute.
2007.07-21,1,42698,thomas_m_fisher,,2612.992,2614.858,"No, I'm not saying that, but I am saying--"
2007.07-21,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2614.858,2618.896,Then... then it's Indiana's responsibility to cull those rolls.
2007.07-21,1,42698,thomas_m_fisher,,2619.462,2620.762,"--Consistent with the NVRA, yes."
2007.07-21,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2620.762,2628.182,It's not a legitimate argument to say we can put a heavier burden on identifying... on voters to identify themselves because our officials are being contumacious.
2007.07-21,1,42698,thomas_m_fisher,,2629.482,2630.301,"No, not at all--"
2007.07-21,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2630.301,2631.184,"Okay, good."
2007.07-21,1,42698,thomas_m_fisher,,2631.601,2632.736,"--No, that's not my theory."
2007.07-21,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2633.153,2662.522,"One aspect of your system... I know your time is about to expire... but it seems to me that every indigent person in... who doesn't have a photo ID is put to a burden that the mass of voters are not put to... that is either the two step process and not going to my local precinct, but having to go to the county courthouse."
2007.07-21,1,42698,thomas_m_fisher,,2677.932,2681.067,"--Who... right, and who would have to pay a fee to get... to get the ID."
2007.07-21,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2681.067,2682.836,And for nonindigent people.
2007.07-21,1,42698,thomas_m_fisher,,2683.636,2683.986,"Well, that's right."
2007.07-21,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2684.386,2688.221,"--Some very well to do elderly, you don't drive, and they are in the same position."
2007.07-21,1,42698,thomas_m_fisher,,2688.221,2690.456,"--Well, and who can also vote absentee without ID."
2007.07-21,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2699.143,2705.216,"Well, they can go home and get the identification and go back to their precinct; that's what the indigent can't do."
2007.07-21,1,42698,thomas_m_fisher,,2705.216,2709.018,Or a nonindigent person who doesn't have ID but then needs to go to the DMV.
2007.07-21,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2709.018,2720.576,"If we thought that the birth certificate requirement for indigent people was... was burdensome, are there any States that have alternates to birth certificates?"
2007.07-21,1,42698,thomas_m_fisher,,2737.618,2741.822,"Well, let me do point out one category where there are some reasonable alternatives."
2007.07-21,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2776.244,2778.346,Don't you need a birth certificate to get a passport?
2007.07-21,1,42698,thomas_m_fisher,,2778.346,2778.829,"--Well, that's what I mean."
2007.07-21,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2778.829,2779.346,Yes.
2007.07-21,1,42698,thomas_m_fisher,,2783.05,2784.617,Yes.
2007.07-21,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2824.46,2825.31,"Thank you, Mr. Fisher."
2007.07-21,1,42698,thomas_m_fisher,,2825.31,2828.695,Thank you.
2007.07-21,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2828.695,2835.182,General Clement.
2007.07-21,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2835.182,2845.772,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Any system of voting that involves registrations or precincts will necessarily require some mechanism for ascertaining a voter's identity."
2007.07-21,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2902.91,2917.403,"Before you do that, General Clement, I'd like to you to concentrate on the one group of people where I think you can make a facial challenge and may not all speculating, and that's the indigent people who can't get... don't have the photo ID."
2007.07-21,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2954.092,2963.781,"Well, Justice Ginsburg, I mean I can understand that you're concerned with that aspect of the statute and the fact that you can't execute an indigency affidavit in the polling place."
2007.07-21,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3012.029,3012.412,But I'm--
2007.07-21,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,3012.412,3013.814,--than anything we have before us.
2007.07-21,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3013.814,3016.499,--Just on... just on that one class of people.
2007.07-21,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,3016.499,3016.933,Sure.
2007.07-21,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3016.933,3021.551,And that's not going to change after the election.
2007.07-21,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,3050.404,3083.725,"And, Justice Ginsburg, I mean I see your concern, and I think if we had an as applied challenge that wasn't this kind of grab bag challenge that looks at all the various different classes of people that might be adversely affected, if we had a challenge that focused on that particular issue, I would imagine... I don't know for sure... I would imagine that the State would probably put on some evidence that says, look, there's a reason we did it that way; we piggybacked on the general provisional ballot provisions and what we decided is that, if we had people executing indigency affidavits at the polling place, it would add to the lines as the the polls."
2007.07-21,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3083.725,3085.993,They didn't make that argument now.
2007.07-21,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,3096.201,3100.02,"But with respect, Justice Souter, I mean that's not the way this challenge proceeded."
2007.07-21,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3132.474,3132.841,That would be a--
2007.07-21,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,3132.841,3133.424,--because--
2007.07-21,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3133.424,3142.33,"--That would be a virtue, but one of the vices would be that it would be after the election and the entire matter would be academic for another 2 years, until another 2 years had passed."
2007.07-21,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,3142.33,3143.515,"--Well, I don't think so."
2007.07-21,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3146.967,3149.915,"The provisional ballots would be counted, I assume."
2007.07-21,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,3149.915,3150.48,What's that?
2007.07-21,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3150.48,3153.09,The provisional ballots would be counted.
2007.07-21,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,3158.116,3162.756,"Well, if the claim could be brought in sufficient time, I suppose it would."
2007.07-21,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3162.756,3173.784,And if we assume that everyone who has a decent claim under this Act went through the hoops to get the provisional ballot at the... wherever the county office is and--
2007.07-21,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,3173.784,3174.345,Sure.
2007.07-21,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3174.345,3177.17,--that's an assumption which need not necessarily be made.
2007.07-21,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,3177.17,3183.757,"But, conversely, nowhere is it... nowhere is it a rational assumption that all 32 of these individuals has a great claim."
2007.07-21,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3186.458,3187.208,"Well, I'm not concentrating--"
2007.07-21,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,3187.208,3188.808,--and for those people I don't think they have much of a claim.
2007.07-21,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3188.808,3200.533,"--I was trying to deal with this one category of person, and the State... it was addressed, and the State said, well, we can't do it that way because that will lead to congestion at the polling place."
2007.07-21,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,3216.761,3238.491,"Well, Justice Ginsburg, I mean I think there's a rationale justification for that which is that, you know, if... especially if there are only a handful of these people, is do you really want to instruct every poll worker at every precinct on how to deal with this unusual situation or do you want to say, you know, that's sort of an outlying situation, let's instruct one poll worker at the county elections office how to deal with it?"
2007.07-21,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3276.766,3280.987,"If we did that, I assume challenges could be made in advance of the election."
2007.07-21,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,3280.987,3282.887,--I don't see any reason why they couldn't be.
2007.07-21,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3285.722,3288.407,And presumably the challenges could be adjudicated.
2007.07-21,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,3300.565,3307.054,"That is true, and there is a provision for judicial review under Indiana law, of the provisional ballots, if there's an ongoing dispute."
2007.07-21,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3321.995,3330.934,Is it not unrealistic to assume it would be easier to file a lawsuit and go off with the burden of litigation rather than go back to get the second affidavit?
2007.07-21,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,3339.289,3345.193,"--You know, it may be, Justice Stevens, that it's easier to get somebody to help you out with the Federal case than it is with the second... with the second affidavit."
2007.07-21,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3348.795,3350.914,"Things called class actions, right?"
2007.07-21,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,3350.914,3351.33,--Yes.
2007.07-21,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3375.813,3379.981,Do you think there is standing in this case to bring the facial challenge?
2007.07-21,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,3379.981,3382.347,"--I think it's a close question, Mr. Chief Justice."
2007.07-21,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3434.716,3445.924,"If you look at the real world impact and you ask whether the Democratic Party has standing to challenge the law, is it relevant that the State legislature is split entirely on party lines?"
2007.07-21,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,3445.924,3447.224,May I answer the question?
2007.07-21,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3467.187,3475.976,But don't you think it's fair to infer that this law does have an adverse impact on the Democrats that is different from its impact on the Republicans?
2007.07-21,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,3475.976,3488.701,"Well, again, if I could answer, I mean I would just say that, you know, if this was a cleverly designed mechanism by the Republican Party to disadvantage the Democratic Party, at least in 2006 it looks like it went pretty far awry from their perspective."
2007.07-21,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3488.701,3490.436,"Thank you, General Clement."
2007.07-21,3,38319,paul_m_smith,,3494.938,3495.523,"Thank you, Your Honor."
2007.07-21,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3572.273,3576.741,Who do you do with illiterates who don't have a signature?
2007.07-21,3,38319,paul_m_smith,,3578.443,3579.177,"--Well, Your Honor--"
2007.07-21,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3579.177,3581.961,Aren't there going to be problems under any system you imagine?
2007.07-21,3,38319,paul_m_smith,,3581.961,3593.186,"--Yes, there are; and it's this Court's job under the Burdick line of cases to weigh the benefits and the burdens and come out with the appropriate decision about whether the legislature went too hard... far."
2007.07-21,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3682.244,3687.898,You want us to invalidate a statute on the ground that it's a minor inconvenience to a small percentage of voters?
2007.07-21,3,38319,paul_m_smith,,3687.898,3699.206,"That it imposes a range of burdens on people from quite severe to less severe, and those burdens vastly outweigh the... any incremental state interest that is being served, Your Honor."
2007.07-21,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3710.345,3712.014,You said it serves no purpose.
2007.07-21,3,38319,paul_m_smith,,3721.153,3729.141,"Well, you have to make some judgment about the incremental, additional benefit above what's already been in place for decades, and it worked extremely effectively, Your Honor."
2007.07-21,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3736.895,3756.809,"Well, if you want to talk about increments, why shouldn't we also ask whether our judgment does more harm than good; whether... whether the remedy for... for the inconvenience to a small number of people is to wash away the whole statute, which in most of its applications is perfectly okay?"
2007.07-21,3,38319,paul_m_smith,,3764.482,3769.201,"Well, Your Honor, I think the number of people who are adversely affected is part of the analysis."
2007.07-21,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3783.274,3784.657,"Thank you, Mr. Smith."
