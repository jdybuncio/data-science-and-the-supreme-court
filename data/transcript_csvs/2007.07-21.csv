2007.07-21,0,paul_m_smith,,36.856,63.256,"Now, the State says that those burdens are justified by the need to stamp out the scourge of voter impersonation fraud at the polls, but this Court has made clear many times that such a justification should not just be accepted at face value, but instead it should be scrutinized to assure that the claimed State interest is both real and sufficiently weighty to justify the burden being imposed on constitutional rights.",26.4

2007.07-21,0,paul_m_smith,,84.37,97.414,"But in this case, Your Honor, the Democratic Party was found to have standing correctly, I believe, on at least two grounds, associational standing as well as what you might call haven standing, the organizational interest being impaired by virtue of this law.",13.043999999999997
2007.07-21,0,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,97.414,101.549,"Well, they still have to identify individuals who are members.",4.135000000000005

2007.07-21,0,paul_m_smith,,111.255,122.812,"They did identify members who are activists, who are poll workers, and that's why the district court said that as, as to the equal protection claim those people were sufficient to satisfy associational standing.",11.557000000000002
2007.07-21,0,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,122.812,129.466,I thought... I thought they took the position that anybody who voted or intended to vote Democratic is a member of the Democratic Party.,6.654000000000011

2007.07-21,0,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,134.27,153.748,Is there any way in which you can say... and I thought this was the theory of associational standing... that this individual has voluntarily given this organization the right to represent that person for particular purposes?,19.47799999999998

2007.07-21,0,paul_m_smith,,185.283,196.525,Because they have... the Democratic Party is an association of people joined together to elect candidates of a particular kind and those people include many people who are burdened by this law.,11.242000000000019

2007.07-21,0,paul_m_smith,,210.335,211.118,"No, that's correct, Your Honor.",0.782999999999987
2007.07-21,0,paul_m_smith,,211.118,227.729,"Well, the court of appeals relied as well on Havens Realty and said that the organizational interests of the party are being impaired by virtue of the fact that this is putting a burden on them achieving their goal, the Democratic Party's goal, of electing its candidates.",16.61100000000002
2007.07-21,0,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,227.729,234.116,And is doing so by forcing them to get people properly identified.,6.3870000000000005

2007.07-21,0,paul_m_smith,,265.635,279.661,"The Court said it doesn't really matter because the State agency that had associational standing in Hunt functioned for all purposes as the representatives of those, of those apple farmers, but there was no formal membership organization, no members per se at all.",14.02600000000001
2007.07-21,0,paul_m_smith,,279.661,285.649,But the Court said that shouldn't make a difference because there's really no actual functional difference between the two situations.,5.9879999999999995
2007.07-21,0,paul_m_smith,,285.649,286.399,I would certainly submit--,0.75
2007.07-21,0,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,286.399,291.436,I just think it's hard to confine your rationale if you say that any association could sue.,5.036999999999978

2007.07-21,0,paul_m_smith,,301.091,319.453,"--Well Your Honor, the thing that confines the rationale is it has to be something that relates as well to the purpose of the organization, of the association, the reason why these people are bound together as a group, and that is of course to get people to vote and vote to support... support the goals of the organization, support the candidates, the nominees of the organization.",18.361999999999966
2007.07-21,0,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,319.453,331.111,"We can limit your standing argument to... I guess it's based on the affidavits of Ms. Holland and Ms. Smith, the one who is a clerk for the Democratic Party and the other who is a judge for the Democratic Party.",11.658000000000015

2007.07-21,0,paul_m_smith,,378.775,387.78,"Now, in addition I would note as I suggested to Justice Souter, you don't have to go to the associational standing because the Democratic Party clearly is injured in its own right as an organization.",9.004999999999995
