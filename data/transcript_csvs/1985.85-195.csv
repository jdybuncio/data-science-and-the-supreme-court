1985.85-195,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,4.374,We will hear arguments first this morning in Icicle Seafoods against Worthington.
1985.85-195,0,18504,clemens_h_barnes,,10.318,14.201,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1985.85-195,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,186.381,199.04,"Mr. Barnes, the ultimate question of whether the workers were seamen, is it a mixed question of fact and law, do you suppose?"
1985.85-195,0,18504,clemens_h_barnes,,199.04,204.324,"Well, that depends in our analysis on what the issue is."
1985.85-195,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,205.776,212.662,"The ultimate determination whether someone is a seaman, is that a mixed question of fact and law?"
1985.85-195,0,18504,clemens_h_barnes,,212.662,214.061,--It has both elements to it.
1985.85-195,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,234.003,238.578,The subsidiary fact finding that goes into it would be factual?
1985.85-195,0,18504,clemens_h_barnes,,238.578,239.386,Yes.
1985.85-195,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,239.386,243.951,"Did... now, there are administrative regulations, are there not?"
1985.85-195,0,18504,clemens_h_barnes,,243.951,245.26,Yes.
1985.85-195,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,245.26,248.543,Interpreting what the law requires--
1985.85-195,0,18504,clemens_h_barnes,,248.543,249.134,Yes.
1985.85-195,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,249.134,249.935,--for who is a seaman?
1985.85-195,0,18504,clemens_h_barnes,,249.935,250.944,Yes.
1985.85-195,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,250.944,256.299,And did the district court make any reference at all to those administrative regulations?
1985.85-195,0,18504,clemens_h_barnes,,256.299,257.239,They were before the court.
1985.85-195,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,257.239,261.162,Did the district court mention them at all?
1985.85-195,0,18504,clemens_h_barnes,,265.095,272.378,The language of the findings and of the conclusions is in the terminology of the regulations.
1985.85-195,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,275.941,291.792,"Well, is there some question or difficulty here because the craft on which they were working is not self-propelled or engaged in navigation?"
1985.85-195,0,18504,clemens_h_barnes,,305.08,315.087,"The Ninth Circuit mentioned that the Arctic Star spends in its opinion more time at anchor than she does under way, that is true."
1985.85-195,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,412.952,414.604,"Are these people engineers, so-called?"
1985.85-195,0,18504,clemens_h_barnes,,414.604,415.953,--They are engineers.
1985.85-195,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,415.953,418.244,They were not licensed?
1985.85-195,0,18504,clemens_h_barnes,,418.244,425.41,"They are not Coast Guard licensed, because there are specific exemptions that apply to this industry and these types of crafts."
1985.85-195,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,425.41,430.162,Is that non-licensure fact of any significance in the case?
1985.85-195,0,18504,clemens_h_barnes,,430.162,431.974,In my opinion it is not.
1985.85-195,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,472.099,474.021,Is there a reason why they weren't licensed?
1985.85-195,0,18504,clemens_h_barnes,,474.021,475.162,It's not required.
1985.85-195,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,475.162,480.845,"Yes, but don't they move from ship to ship?"
1985.85-195,0,18504,clemens_h_barnes,,486.469,490.843,"I am the first to admit I'm not an admiralty lawyer, Your Honor."
1985.85-195,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,562.24,565.933,"Mr. Barnes, did the Court of Appeals disagree with any of those five findings?"
1985.85-195,0,18504,clemens_h_barnes,,565.933,567.293,They--
1985.85-195,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,567.293,570.245,Any of those specific things?
1985.85-195,0,18504,clemens_h_barnes,,570.245,571.947,--That's the problem in the opinion.
1985.85-195,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,577.722,578.781,Yes.
1985.85-195,0,18504,clemens_h_barnes,,578.781,583.795,"Or that we don't have to find whether they're clearly erroneous, because they involve legal interpretations."
1985.85-195,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,664.226,687.022,"Well, Mr. Barnes, I think the thing that still confuses be is that the regulations, the administrative regulations for determining who is a seaman, require or set forth a test, that the work of a seaman is work in aid of navigation, in aid of navigation."
1985.85-195,0,18504,clemens_h_barnes,,712.86,718.325,"If so, I would have thought they should have remanded to determine whether those facts--"
1985.85-195,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,718.325,724.228,"Well, I would have thought so, too, although it went ahead and decided them on its own, didn't it?"
1985.85-195,0,18504,clemens_h_barnes,,724.228,725.148,--It did.
1985.85-195,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,796.374,805.691,"Mr. Barnes, there's a lot of argument between the two of you as to whether these were pure findings of fact or were something more than that."
1985.85-195,0,18504,clemens_h_barnes,,811.808,834.055,"If the Ninth Circuit feels that there is an element of legal interpretation in those facts, I don't say we lose our case, because the remedy is a remand to sort out that which is legal from that which is factual."
1985.85-195,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,862.295,869.65,"Well, I would hope not, although I must confess in reading the briefs it almost seems that way as between the two of you."
1985.85-195,0,18504,clemens_h_barnes,,872.643,902.64,"Well, the reason we make much of that is that when one reviews the trial record, and keeping in mind this was a trial before a judge who heard the evidence and the testimony and concluded that these are the facts, we think that's very significant, because the Ninth Circuit did not address those findings and say that, we disagree with them because they're clearly erroneous."
1985.85-195,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,941.578,945.071,"May I interrupt there, because maybe I'm troubled by the same thing Justice O'Connor is."
1985.85-195,0,18504,clemens_h_barnes,,965.315,967.895,--That would have been in incorrect legal standard.
1985.85-195,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,972.098,975.111,I sea.
1985.85-195,0,18504,clemens_h_barnes,,985.557,987.517,"I will go that far, yes."
1985.85-195,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1040.762,1051.229,Is whether or not he is a seaman a pure fact question when it determines the whole case?
1985.85-195,0,18504,clemens_h_barnes,,1051.229,1057.194,"When the issue is what does ""seaman"" mean within the statute, it's a legal question."
1985.85-195,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1060.626,1062.096,Is it a fact question?
1985.85-195,0,18504,clemens_h_barnes,,1062.096,1066.721,--It is both fact and law.
1985.85-195,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1071.623,1077.987,"Well, if it's fact and law, do you require the court to find clearly erroneous?"
1985.85-195,0,18504,clemens_h_barnes,,1077.987,1085.412,"We're talking past each other, I'm sorry."
1985.85-195,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1098.48,1100.642,Now we have separated.
1985.85-195,0,18504,clemens_h_barnes,,1102.134,1102.832,Yes.
1985.85-195,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1102.832,1104.505,Before it was the whole thing.
1985.85-195,0,18504,clemens_h_barnes,,1104.505,1108.338,The word... excuse me.
1985.85-195,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1108.338,1111.919,"What is it now, fact?"
1985.85-195,0,18504,clemens_h_barnes,,1111.919,1119.324,"The word ""seaman"" has both legal aspects and fact aspects, depending on what the question is."
1985.85-195,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1250.101,1259.895,Mr. Eller.
1985.85-195,1,18855,carson_f_eller,,1259.895,1262.089,"Mr. Chief Justice, if it please the Court:"
1985.85-195,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1288.647,1291.478,You mean the law of the case?
1985.85-195,1,18855,carson_f_eller,,1291.478,1296.941,"--I think it is the law of the land that the Ninth Circuit's definition of ""seaman"" not stands, because--"
1985.85-195,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1296.941,1298.4,We just denied cert of it.
1985.85-195,1,18855,carson_f_eller,,1298.4,1301.953,--The issue is not before the Court.
1985.85-195,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1306.656,1308.739,What makes it the law of the land?
1985.85-195,1,18855,carson_f_eller,,1308.739,1317.254,"Well, unless this Court is overruling the Ninth Circuit on the definition of ""seaman"", that was the impression I had, it would--"
1985.85-195,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1317.254,1318.133,But we didn't affirm it.
1985.85-195,1,18855,carson_f_eller,,1318.133,1319.565,"--Well, that's correct."
1985.85-195,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1434.17,1445.216,But didn't we say in Pullman-Standard that the clearly erroneous standard of review applied just beyond where there were credibility determinations to be made?
1985.85-195,1,18855,carson_f_eller,,1445.216,1448.258,Yes.
1985.85-195,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1477.62,1486.175,"Well, I thought you were maintaining now that, because there was no issue of credibility in the district court, the clearly erroneous standard didn't apply."
1985.85-195,1,18855,carson_f_eller,,1489.267,1492.35,I'm not saying it doesn't apply.
1985.85-195,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1548.824,1552.797,Why do you call it a rule of equity?
1985.85-195,1,18855,carson_f_eller,,1552.797,1571.06,"--Some of the cases I referred to... as a matter of fact, I think Mr. Moore that wrote the encyclopedia on the Federal Rules alludes to that, that it's not a strict standard of law."
1985.85-195,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1592.714,1603.711,"Well, do you think in the context of the Federal Fair Standards Act that we should not apply Rule 52 to the subsidiary fact findings?"
1985.85-195,1,18855,carson_f_eller,,1603.711,1612.497,"--In this case... well, I cannot answer that in all of the aspects of the Fair Labor Standards Act."
1985.85-195,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1614.217,1615.349,"Well, is that your position?"
1985.85-195,1,18855,carson_f_eller,,1615.349,1617.138,"--No, Your Honor, it is not."
1985.85-195,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1690.727,1695.121,"But is it not essentially a question of fact, what he does?"
1985.85-195,1,18855,carson_f_eller,,1695.121,1698.313,"--Describing it, yes, Your Honor, it is."
1985.85-195,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1764.195,1775.852,"But if the record shows that he doesn't do the things that seamen do traditionally and he does the things that maintenance and repairmen do, aren't you back to pure facts again?"
1985.85-195,1,18855,carson_f_eller,,1775.852,1779.925,"--If you could stop there, yes, Your Honor, you would be."
1985.85-195,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1779.925,1781.317,Why can't you stop there?
1985.85-195,1,18855,carson_f_eller,,1781.317,1785.598,You have to come to some conclusion after you have looked at what they do?
1985.85-195,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1785.598,1787.96,The conclusion is that he's a welder and a repairman.
1985.85-195,1,18855,carson_f_eller,,1787.96,1793.893,"The findings as presented by the defendant says that he's a seaman, he's exempt."
1985.85-195,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1878.38,1888.586,So must we review every case in which a Court of Appeals makes that impossible attempt and comes to some conclusion as to what is facts and what is law?
1985.85-195,1,18855,carson_f_eller,,1888.586,1890.699,"--I don't think so, Your Honor."
1985.85-195,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1891.648,1893.769,Isn't that a pretty fact-bound question in itself?
1985.85-195,1,18855,carson_f_eller,,1893.769,1897.181,"--I anticipated a question from the Court just like that, Your Honor, and I tried--"
1985.85-195,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1897.181,1898.684,I hope you give me a good answer.
1985.85-195,1,18855,carson_f_eller,,1900.343,1908.5,"--I tried to form in my own mind... now, if I had the authority, I'm going to redraft Rule 52, and I would do it this way, I couldn't get very far."
1985.85-195,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1913.964,1916.294,So again I ask you.
1985.85-195,1,18855,carson_f_eller,,1922.129,1938.789,"I think this Court should... well, first of all, the Court of Appeals was groping around for a method of reversing with dignity."
1985.85-195,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1958.764,1961.663,"He wasn't referring to this particular case, was he?"
1985.85-195,1,18855,carson_f_eller,,1961.663,1962.154,--No.
1985.85-195,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1982.696,1986.73,"So you think we should dismiss it, is that it?"
1985.85-195,1,18855,carson_f_eller,,1986.73,1991.254,--I think we should dismiss it as being improvidentially granted.
1985.85-195,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2002.511,2003.882,How would we explain that?
1985.85-195,1,18855,carson_f_eller,,2003.882,2004.402,"Pardon me, Your Honor?"
1985.85-195,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2004.402,2006.353,How would we explain that?
1985.85-195,1,18855,carson_f_eller,,2006.353,2008.954,"I haven't gotten that far, Your Honor."
1985.85-195,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2012.177,2012.868,You'll leave that to us.
1985.85-195,1,18855,carson_f_eller,,2012.868,2015.77,"It was a good concept, but I didn't follow it through, apparently."
1985.85-195,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2015.77,2020.203,"Well, may I ask you a question about it, assuming we don't dismiss the case."
1985.85-195,1,18855,carson_f_eller,,2047.064,2048.945,"Yes, Your Honor, I do."
1985.85-195,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2074.14,2078.523,"Of course, that one actually went to this other issue, not to the seaman issue, didn't it?"
1985.85-195,1,18855,carson_f_eller,,2079.744,2080.925,"Yes, there's a second issue--"
1985.85-195,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2080.925,2091.671,"--Insofar as the findings relate to the question whether these individuals were seamen, is there anything in the findings other than the statement at the end of finding seven which you think is erroneous?"
1985.85-195,1,18855,carson_f_eller,,2091.671,2098.156,"--In describing what they did, I do not think... I think that is absolutely correct, because the only way you can--"
1985.85-195,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2098.156,2104.651,"So then does the case boil down to the question whether that last sentence, given all the other facts, the last sentence,"
1985.85-195,1,18855,carson_f_eller,,2109.323,2110.524,--It's mixed.
1985.85-195,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2110.524,2112.394,"Or mixed, as you say."
1985.85-195,1,18855,carson_f_eller,,2112.394,2113.536,It's definitely mixed.
1985.85-195,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2113.536,2116.398,But the question... it really focuses on that one sentence.
1985.85-195,1,18855,carson_f_eller,,2119.931,2121.521,"Well, it's like this case in--"
1985.85-195,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2121.521,2128.236,"Is that correct, that there is no dispute about the underlying facts, only whether they all add up to the conclusion that these people are seamen?"
1985.85-195,1,18855,carson_f_eller,,2128.236,2130.006,--You might say that.
1985.85-195,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2151.52,2154.373,"Well, all right, ""which was maritime""."
1985.85-195,1,18855,carson_f_eller,,2160.907,2165.381,"I would... navigable waters, I pointed that out in my brief."
1985.85-195,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2202.024,2212.761,"Mr. Eller, is it correct that the Ninth Circuit thought that the facts were all right as far as they went, but that additional findings should have been made?"
1985.85-195,1,18855,carson_f_eller,,2212.761,2216.544,I get the impression they would have--
1985.85-195,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2216.544,2228.491,"It certainly isn't clear from the opinion, but I wonder if that is the fault found by the Ninth Circuit, that the facts as far as they went were all right, but there should have been additional findings?"
1985.85-195,1,18855,carson_f_eller,,2228.491,2229.382,--I agree.
1985.85-195,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2230.592,2239.298,"Why did the Ninth Circuit go ahead and make those findings, instead of saying to the trial judge: We need some additional findings, go make them."
1985.85-195,1,18855,carson_f_eller,,2239.298,2244.202,"--I find it a little difficult, Justice O'Connor, to carry the Ninth Circuit's cross."
1985.85-195,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2346.539,2351.741,"Do you have anything further, Mr. Barnes?"
1985.85-195,2,18504,clemens_h_barnes,,2351.741,2352.352,"Briefly, Your Honor."
1985.85-195,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2497.197,2499.209,"Thank you, gentlemen."
