2013.12-464,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.576,"We'll hear argument next this morning in Case 12-464, Kaley vs. United States."
2013.12-464,0,28012,howard_srebnick,,8.639,12.105,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2013.12-464,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,45.857,60.695,"Well, I -- you know, I -- I find it hard to think that -- that the right of property is any more sacrosanct than the -- the right to freedom of the person."
2013.12-464,0,28012,howard_srebnick,,107.099,110.692,"Justice Scalia, it's not okay for either."
2013.12-464,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,110.692,112.019,"Ah, okay."
2013.12-464,0,28012,howard_srebnick,,116.267,143.194,"The right to be released on bail, that is, the right not to be detained all the way until trial, under this Court's precedent in United States v. Salerno, the Court provided procedural safeguards to ensure that before someone is held all the way until trial, they would have a hearing, a hearing which would include a right to challenge the weight of the evidence and other factors."
2013.12-464,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,153.252,155.829,"Well, that's -- I'm sorry."
2013.12-464,0,28012,howard_srebnick,,163.966,171.775,--Every person is limited by their own financial wherewithal.
2013.12-464,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,179.116,189.566,But why in that situation would the defendant not have the constitutional right to have a determination by a judge as to whether there was probable cause?
2013.12-464,0,28012,howard_srebnick,,189.566,194.5,"In the context of a bail hearing, a judge does make that determination."
2013.12-464,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,194.5,195.375,Does it?
2013.12-464,0,28012,howard_srebnick,,217.725,220.771,"Yes, we are, Justice Ginsburg."
2013.12-464,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,241.826,243.043,Right to be heard--
2013.12-464,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,243.043,256.164,"I thought your answer might have been that, yes, in fact, the property is entitled to greater protection because it's going to be used to hire counsel that will keep the person out of jail long term, even if he can be put in jail pending the trial."
2013.12-464,0,28012,howard_srebnick,,256.164,259.616,"--Mr. Chief Justice, we've certainly made that argument in our brief."
2013.12-464,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,279.498,289.166,"Is this only in the case where the person has no other assets, where all of his assets are seized so that he can't -- he can't hire counsel?"
2013.12-464,0,28012,howard_srebnick,,308.206,310.954,That's not this case.
2013.12-464,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,311.986,317.046,"So you have a hearing on whether he has other money, right?"
2013.12-464,0,28012,howard_srebnick,,317.046,319.343,"--Such -- such a hearing took place in this case, indeed."
2013.12-464,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,327.823,340.817,"--If your -- if your position prevails, there would be nothing to stop the defendant from using those assets for something other than paying an attorney."
2013.12-464,0,28012,howard_srebnick,,358.685,362.918,"Justice Ginsburg, I believe there could be and should be."
2013.12-464,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,384.44,406.01,"I see the government's strongest argument as being that the grand jury finding of probable cause is sacrosanct, and a hearing like the one that you are proposing would call the validity of that finding into question."
2013.12-464,0,28012,howard_srebnick,,428.329,437.091,"Justice Sotomayor, what we are proposing, and indeed it's been a hearing that's taken place in several of the circuits for some 25 years now--"
2013.12-464,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,437.091,440.48,There is at least five who are ruling similarly to yours.
2013.12-464,0,28012,howard_srebnick,,440.48,445.135,--So for 25 years the courts in those circuits have been holding these hearings.
2013.12-464,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,483.292,484.275,And how do you get at--
2013.12-464,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,484.275,484.994,"Well, that's terrible."
2013.12-464,0,28012,howard_srebnick,,498.365,504.939,"--Justice Scalia, we are not quarrelling with the power of the grand jury to initiate the charge."
2013.12-464,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,511.921,530.664,"--But then there -- then there is the anomaly that the grand jury has said there is probable cause, this defendant can be prosecuted, and then you would have the judge make a determination that there isn't probable cause to believe."
2013.12-464,0,28012,howard_srebnick,,569.959,572.442,"--Justice Ginsburg, I don't believe so."
2013.12-464,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,596.01,603.243,"In your view, what weight does the court, the trial court in this hearing, give to the fact of the indictment?"
2013.12-464,0,28012,howard_srebnick,,603.243,610.147,I believe the indictment authorizes the initiation of the restraint and not more.
2013.12-464,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,612.083,613.083,So no weight.
2013.12-464,0,28012,howard_srebnick,,622.595,627.639,"--Justice Kennedy, if the defendant makes a presentation at the hearing--"
2013.12-464,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,627.639,629.076,No.
2013.12-464,0,28012,howard_srebnick,,631.123,647.569,"--If the defendant is entitled to the hearing because the defendant needs assets to retain counsel of choice, and the government rests on the indictment and the defense presents nothing more, I submit the government would prevail at that hearing if nothing is--"
2013.12-464,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,647.569,650.739,What about -- what about a detention hearing?
2013.12-464,0,28012,howard_srebnick,,652.598,654.207,--Under the statute--
2013.12-464,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,654.207,657.706,It would be the government under a detention hearing -- pardon me.
2013.12-464,0,28012,howard_srebnick,,660.72,673.824,"--Under the Bail Reform Act, there is a rebuttable presumption in certain offenses where an indictment has been returned that the person is a flight risk, but it is a rebuttal presumption."
2013.12-464,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,686.835,693.582,But a grand jury indictment doesn't -- doesn't establish that there is probable cause to believe that the person is a flight risk.
2013.12-464,0,28012,howard_srebnick,,700.689,711.621,"We are asking the judge to make an independent finding based on what's presented to that judge at the hearing, the very hearings that have been occurring for 25 years."
2013.12-464,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,711.621,717.245,Wouldn't the next step be that the judge would then dismiss the indictment?
2013.12-464,0,28012,howard_srebnick,,749.637,758.12,"Justice Ginsburg, what the judge might conclude is at that hearing at that moment in time the government did not satisfy its burden, on that one day in time."
2013.12-464,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,763.383,766.037,"At these hearings when they have been conducted, what do they look like?"
2013.12-464,0,28012,howard_srebnick,,783.968,785.92,Justice Alito--
2013.12-464,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,785.92,786.92,You could call witnesses.
2013.12-464,0,28012,howard_srebnick,,793.012,802.929,"--Justice Alito, what we are proposing and what indeed happened in this case, in the case of the Kaleys, the defense presented transcripts of testimony."
2013.12-464,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,809.816,820.53,"Well, this was an unusual -- that's a somewhat unusual situation where you had been -- there had already been a trial of someone else who was allegedly involved in the scheme."
2013.12-464,0,28012,howard_srebnick,,824.889,838.133,"In the more ordinary situation the defense, if it chose to offer evidence, it would be subject to the rules of the standard for issuing subpoenas under Nixon only if there were material exculpatory evidence that needed to be presented."
2013.12-464,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,871.465,887.459,"And in the next case we have, if we agree with you, will be somebody saying due process does not allow you to proceed with a trial when it has been found by an impartial judge that there is no probable cause."
2013.12-464,0,28012,howard_srebnick,,940.095,959.305,"--Justice Scalia, I believe that was the issue in Monsanto and Caplin & Drysdale where this Court held 5 to 4 decision that assets that are demonstrably tainted can be restrained over the objection of the defendant who needs those assets to retain counsel of choice."
2013.12-464,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,966.349,969.66,Can I ask what the prospects of success at a hearing like this are?
2013.12-464,0,28012,howard_srebnick,,999.148,1000.897,Justice Kagan--
2013.12-464,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1000.897,1008.395,"Just as a footnote, one in a million, which might be your case."
2013.12-464,0,28012,howard_srebnick,,1010.206,1027.294,"--Actually, I believe that the brief of the New York Council of Defense Lawyers that Justice Kagan refers to points out that there are many other cases where at the courthouse steps the parties resolve the question of the restraint of those assets."
2013.12-464,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1027.294,1035.712,"And I suppose if the government knows it's got to go through a hearing where it has to lay out part of its case, it may well decide at that point it's not worth it."
2013.12-464,0,28012,howard_srebnick,,1044.568,1062.186,"Mr. Chief Justice, that may be so, but it appears that the government does exactly that every day in Federal court during pretrial detention hearings when it proffers its case in order to convince a judge to detain a defendant and we're asking for something no different."
2013.12-464,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1062.186,1068.886,But you said something about plainly tainted assets.
2013.12-464,0,28012,howard_srebnick,,1087.237,1088.581,"Yes, Justice Ginsburg."
2013.12-464,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1088.581,1090.346,Everybody agrees with that.
2013.12-464,0,28012,howard_srebnick,,1104.575,1106.152,"Yes, Justice Ginsburg."
2013.12-464,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1155.693,1165.002,"There's been a suggestion that if the judge were to find that there was a lack of probable cause, the prosecutor would be under an ethical obligation to dismiss the charges."
2013.12-464,0,28012,howard_srebnick,,1166.112,1167.971,"Justice Alito, not necessarily."
2013.12-464,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1206.861,1212.531,"And what if it's the same evidence, the same evidence is introduced before the grand jury."
2013.12-464,0,28012,howard_srebnick,,1225.962,1228.822,"Justice Alito, again, not necessarily."
2013.12-464,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1237.567,1251.218,"We would, presumably, if -- like here -- if there's a legal dispute and the government thinks the judge is wrong, they would try the case and go up on appeal and say to the appellate court the judge below was wrong initially."
2013.12-464,0,28012,howard_srebnick,,1251.218,1253.795,"I believe, yes, Justice--"
2013.12-464,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1253.795,1255.591,"You would have lost the money in that case, but--"
2013.12-464,0,28012,howard_srebnick,,1255.591,1259.84,"--Justice Sotomayor, forgive me."
2013.12-464,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1271.695,1277.144,Does this hearing include an assessment of the reasonableness of attorneys' fees?
2013.12-464,0,28012,howard_srebnick,,1291.701,1298.73,"Justice Scalia, I think it's decided the same way courts every day decide the reasonableness of fees and the legitimacy of fees."
2013.12-464,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1303.79,1312.037,"But does he know his lawyer -- is his lawyer there saying, you know, this is the lawyer I'm going to hire and here's the fee I'm going to charge?"
2013.12-464,0,28012,howard_srebnick,,1312.037,1318.315,"--In this case, yes, because counsel of choice had been retained two years before the indictment."
2013.12-464,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1338.167,1343.54,But you -- you acknowledge that that could be -- that could be an issue in the hearing in other cases.
2013.12-464,0,28012,howard_srebnick,,1343.54,1344.337,"Yes, Justice Scalia."
2013.12-464,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1351.646,1353.13,I don't know what the fees are.
2013.12-464,0,28012,howard_srebnick,,1367.093,1370.81,"--Justice Scalia, we're talking now about the right to counsel of choice."
2013.12-464,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1386.414,1386.554,Okay.
2013.12-464,0,28012,howard_srebnick,,1390.256,1402.595,"If the defendant is seeking a particular amount to be unfrozen at the time of the transfer of funds, of course, the court would need to know who the lawyer was and how much the fee was."
2013.12-464,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1434.301,1450.544,"Did you say that in this case, because counsel had been retained two years earlier, that the court was presented with how much the lawyer was going to charge to represent the defendants at trial?"
2013.12-464,0,28012,howard_srebnick,,1450.544,1451.856,Yes.
2013.12-464,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1451.856,1461.79,"The -- the dollar amount was known so that the Court could then say, well, we'll unfreeze assets to that extent but no more."
2013.12-464,0,28012,howard_srebnick,,1461.79,1463.195,"Yes, Justice Ginsburg."
2013.12-464,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1486.046,1487.779,What was -- what was the figure?
2013.12-464,0,28012,howard_srebnick,,1489.934,1490.606,Yes.
2013.12-464,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1490.606,1499.228,What was -- what was the amount of money that the defendants wanted spared from the seizure order?
2013.12-464,0,28012,howard_srebnick,,1499.228,1507.817,"The estimate was a fee of up to $500,000 for two lawyers and the entire investigation costs, consultants, experts, et cetera."
2013.12-464,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1517.877,1520.547,"And it was a case with very substantial documents, et cetera?"
2013.12-464,0,28012,howard_srebnick,,1520.547,1522.39,"Yes, Justice Kennedy."
2013.12-464,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1530.746,1532.324,"Tell me something, because I don't know the answer."
2013.12-464,0,28012,howard_srebnick,,1541.617,1544.288,"Justice Scalia, I believe they can."
2013.12-464,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1544.288,1545.943,I think they can too.
2013.12-464,0,28012,howard_srebnick,,1560.968,1577.728,"Justice Scalia, in this case, if the hearing would go forward, the only way the lawyers would be paid is if there would be a finding by the court that the conduct at issue will not give rise to forfeiture."
2013.12-464,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1596.173,1598.688,The -- the--
2013.12-464,0,28012,howard_srebnick,,1598.688,1603.421,"Mr. Chief Justice, I'd like to reserve the balance of my time."
2013.12-464,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1603.921,1605.342,"Thank you, counsel."
2013.12-464,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1609.512,1612.823,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2013.12-464,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1641.686,1644.935,But none of that goes to his ability to hire his counsel of choice.
2013.12-464,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1659.772,1675.798,"Well, the parallels I think, Mr. Chief Justice, illustrate that the process for determining probable cause by a grand jury has been deemed sufficiently reliable so that further judicial inquiry is not warranted."
2013.12-464,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1697.913,1699.428,I understand the theory.
2013.12-464,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1705.769,1731.807,"--Well, it is a protection in the following sense, Mr. Chief Justice: If the court is seriously considering departing from the universal rule up till now in its cases and in other English-speaking courts and allowing a review of whether there is probable cause after the grand jury has found it, it ought at least to have a good reason for doing so, namely some reason to think that defendants will prevail in a--"
2013.12-464,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1731.807,1733.681,"They do that, fine, done."
2013.12-464,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1803.654,1812.727,"--Justice Breyer, just to start with the last thing that you said, it is inconsistent with the way this Court has analyzed the constitutional--"
2013.12-464,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1812.727,1816.647,"No, it leaves open -- it leaves open the question in Monsanto explicitly."
2013.12-464,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1828.127,1831.032,"--I wasn't referring to Monsanto, Justice Breyer."
2013.12-464,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1831.876,1835.484,"You say “ never ” is consistently, and I think it is consistent with the footnote."
2013.12-464,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1835.484,1840.67,"--Justice Breyer, I'm not referring to Monsanto court's reservation of this issue."
2013.12-464,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1857.022,1864.269,Is that how they interpret weight of the evidence at this -- the Bail Reform Act says that the trial judge must determine weight of the evidence.
2013.12-464,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1877.092,1878.404,"--No, Justice Kennedy--"
2013.12-464,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1878.404,1878.951,--end of inquiry?
2013.12-464,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1878.951,1886.089,--But Salerno was different because Salerno was a specific statute in which Congress enumerated the factors that the judge is going to consider.
2013.12-464,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1891.304,1910.656,"I'm asking, perhaps not too clearly, I'm asking what function, what weight, what relevance do courts give in day-to-day hearings on detention to the Bail Reform Act requirement that judges must determine, as part of the bail determination, the weight of the evidence?"
2013.12-464,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1910.656,1922.167,"--In a certain class of cases, Justice Kennedy, the indictment itself creates a presumption that no conditions will assure the safety of the community and the appearance of the defendant."
2013.12-464,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1922.167,1925.854,But -- but that's two different things.
2013.12-464,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1929.868,1930.649,No.
2013.12-464,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1931.944,1933.694,So then don't talk about risk of flight.
2013.12-464,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1948.204,1960.106,"--Justice Kennedy, when the government seeks to detain the defendant, the court has to make a determination under the Bail Reform Act, not because of the Constitution, but under the Bail Reform Act--"
2013.12-464,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1960.106,1960.776,I understand that.
2013.12-464,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1960.776,1966.743,--that either the defendant poses a danger to the community or a risk of flight.
2013.12-464,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1985.813,1989.671,But the court must determine that under the Bail Reform Act.
2013.12-464,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1989.671,1994.295,The court will look at the weight of the evidence under the Bail Reform Act.
2013.12-464,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1999.683,2000.261,No--
2013.12-464,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2000.261,2000.699,Why?
2013.12-464,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2024.111,2024.783,That would--
2013.12-464,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2024.783,2029.202,And then say due process requires something more than probable cause?
2013.12-464,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2029.202,2033.701,--That's squarely contrary to what this Court held in United States v. Monsanto.
2013.12-464,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2050.881,2056.144,"I don't see what this case, frankly, has to do with the grand jury at all, or review of the grand jury determination."
2013.12-464,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2092.053,2095.441,It's seeking to contradict the determination of probable cause--
2013.12-464,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2095.441,2095.785,No.
2013.12-464,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2119.276,2128.833,--But it is seeking to contradict the other determination because it's asking the judge to find that there is no probable cause when the grand jury has found that there is probable cause.
2013.12-464,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2141.563,2150.465,"Do you have to go that -- I mean, your adversary just said that there was a judicial finding of no probable cause."
2013.12-464,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2200.258,2207.396,I think United States v. Monsanto essentially rejected the argument that there is any discretion not to restrain the funds.
2013.12-464,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2207.396,2208.145,It didn't actually.
2013.12-464,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2232.745,2234.088,"I understand that, Justice Breyer."
2013.12-464,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2237.29,2237.649,Here it is.
2013.12-464,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2252.707,2253.331,--Exactly.
2013.12-464,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2253.331,2253.8,Exactly.
2013.12-464,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2274.603,2281.569,I don't think that there is any serious question that Monsanto meant to preclude free floating discretion.
2013.12-464,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2295.314,2295.908,Okay.
2013.12-464,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2359.272,2366.707,"Let me start with the fact that I think that there is harm and there is very little benefit, and I want to turn to both sides of that empirical equation."
2013.12-464,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2403.255,2405.41,That's because they didn't have the good lawyers they wanted to hire.
2013.12-464,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2407.128,2413.532,"They do this, Mr. Chief Justice, usually with the lawyers who want to get the funds so they can be hired."
2013.12-464,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2473.117,2478.349,"I'm sorry, are you talking about cases in like the Second Circuit and the D.C. Circuit where you do have these hearings?"
2013.12-464,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2478.349,2480.504,"--I'm talking about two things, Mr. Chief Justice."
2013.12-464,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2495.733,2497.608,I raised this point earlier.
2013.12-464,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2526.97,2530.905,"Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I agree with you that those cases exist."
2013.12-464,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2544.744,2555.27,"More that the facts, since the funds are traceable anyway and they'll have an opportunity to get them at the end even if they don't get their restraining order, makes it not worth it."
2013.12-464,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2555.27,2555.567,--No.
2013.12-464,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2574.887,2577.574,Has that happened in the circuits that have permitted this?
2013.12-464,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2577.574,2581.308,The government is unlikely to jeopardize the safety of its witnesses--
2013.12-464,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2581.308,2584.93,"You know, I think in the circuit, you've now given us some statistics."
2013.12-464,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2620.354,2622.025,--We do face them.
2013.12-464,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2623.353,2624.291,Can you give me a guess?
2013.12-464,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2645.812,2650.905,"--You're correct, I did ask, and I received anecdotal responses."
2013.12-464,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2650.905,2652.044,How many anecdotes?
2013.12-464,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2654.715,2663.899,I received several specific anecdotes of instances in which the government elected not to proceed with a hearing.
2013.12-464,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2663.899,2665.571,"In a number of cases, several specific."
2013.12-464,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2669.351,2676.347,"There are group numbers in which offices reported, we have encountered this a number of times."
2013.12-464,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2676.347,2678.738,You're making it sound like you would lose the whole case.
2013.12-464,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2694.746,2697.276,"No, it's not just that, Mr. Chief Justice."
2013.12-464,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2701.712,2702.446,"Yeah, but they're--"
2013.12-464,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2702.446,2720.439,"And if the assets are paid out to attorneys, although in theory, as Justice Scalia explained, it is possible under the relation back principle to go into the attorneys' files and into their assets and recover them, in practice it is not so easy to do because--"
2013.12-464,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2720.439,2720.846,--Sure.
2013.12-464,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2755.598,2765.063,--What's wrong with it is that it basically compels the government to try the entire case in a preliminary hearing before the case has even resulted in a--
2013.12-464,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2765.063,2767.172,How often has that happened in the five circuits?
2013.12-464,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2767.172,2777.808,"--The frequency of these hearings is limited, in part because it's rare that defendants are able to show that they have no other assets--"
2013.12-464,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2777.808,2804.751,"And that's the whole point, which is you talk about compulsion on the government, but the compulsion of the defendant not to have a hearing because they are required to say something that could put them at greater risk, whether it's because of the enhancements for obstruction of justice or merely from losing the advantage of their defense at trial, that's why these hearings are so rare."
2013.12-464,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2816.027,2827.74,--And also the stark unlikelihood that the defense will prevail unless the government is forced not to go through with the hearing because of concerns about which--
2013.12-464,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2827.74,2830.615,"Can I ask you a related question, since it came up."
2013.12-464,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2863.617,2865.397,"--I don't, Justice Breyer."
2013.12-464,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2874.816,2877.58,That is what the -- if you look at the actual amount in general.
2013.12-464,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2912.175,2914.675,"No, I'm not sure that it is a fair comment."
2013.12-464,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2951.222,2957.344,--Do you concede that there must be a traceability hearing?
2013.12-464,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2957.344,2961.469,"If the defendant seeks one, yes."
2013.12-464,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2966.919,2968.559,"I mean, in the general run case."
2013.12-464,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2971.995,2973.386,--Yes.
2013.12-464,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2982.319,2985.256,And the defendants have the burden of proof in that hearing?
2013.12-464,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2985.256,2989.316,--That would be up to this Court's decision.
2013.12-464,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2989.316,2993.721,What is your view as to what the Constitution requires in that respect?
2013.12-464,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2993.721,3011.651,"I'd be happy to have the defendants bear the burden of proof, but I think the courts typically have placed the burden of proof on the government to show traceability, and the government, therefore, presents limited evidence, but it's all against the background of the crime not being called into question."
2013.12-464,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3011.651,3013.604,"Mr. Dreeben, one other question."
2013.12-464,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3039.797,3049.949,"I think typically, Justice Kennedy, the government makes a proffer of the evidence that it intends to use."
2013.12-464,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3059.664,3061.477,I think that -- I'm sorry.
2013.12-464,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3061.477,3070.645,I do not think that typically resting on the indictment alone will satisfy the weight of the evidence factor.
2013.12-464,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3084.654,3091.199,"Well, if it's required anyway, then certainly the due process argument that you make is much less weighty."
2013.12-464,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3095.837,3097.556,--It's not the same inquiry.
2013.12-464,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3107.24,3109.005,But that's what it seems to me this case is all about.
2013.12-464,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3165.746,3167.761,They can do both of those things.
2013.12-464,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3227.222,3234.921,"On that point, Mr. Dreeben, would you clarify what happens at the end of the road if the defendant is convicted?"
2013.12-464,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3248.775,3256.506,The difficulty is that we have to actually trace the specific assets into the defendant's own account.
2013.12-464,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3330.211,3339.645,"We could deal with that, couldn't we, by imposing conditions surrounding the use of the word “ may ” with conditions that would reject -- you would say they rejected it."
2013.12-464,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3350.719,3351.75,"--Well, that would be--"
2013.12-464,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3351.75,3367.477,"Under those circumstances -- under -- which is pretty limited, under those circumstances, then he has discretionary authority to grant a hearing at which the defendant will be able to show, you know, that there is not probable cause to believe a crime was committed by his client."
2013.12-464,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3367.477,3369.555,--Those high bars would be helpful.
2013.12-464,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3396.092,3398.028,"Well, it's about a different subject."
2013.12-464,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3411.443,3419.019,"--It's different in the bail context, because the -- the judge at the bail hearing is never questioning probable cause."
2013.12-464,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3425.064,3426.11,"Thank you, Mr. Dreeben."
2013.12-464,2,28012,howard_srebnick,,3428.078,3431.014,The government is asking for an extraordinary remedy.
2013.12-464,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3442.057,3444.601,What do you mean this is the kind of hearing that's held every day?
2013.12-464,2,28012,howard_srebnick,,3448.679,3452.536,The hearing looks very similar to a pretrial detention hearing.
2013.12-464,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3494.487,3498.346,"Counsel, I think your quotation from the D.C. Circuit was -- was not quite on point."
2013.12-464,2,28012,howard_srebnick,,3507.39,3512.309,I understand the hypothetical concerns that the prosecution raises.
2013.12-464,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3599.196,3600.664,"Thank you, counsel."
