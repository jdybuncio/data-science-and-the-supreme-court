1990.89-5011,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.929,"We'll hear argument next in No. 89-5011, Larry Joe Powers v. Ohio."
1990.89-5011,0,39792,robert_l_lane,,56.247,59.9,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.89-5011,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,215.862,220.996,"On that basis anybody would have the right to challenge it then, he wouldn't even have to be the defendant."
1990.89-5011,0,39792,robert_l_lane,,224.456,225.968,"Your Honor, the--"
1990.89-5011,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,225.968,226.88,I mean any citizen.
1990.89-5011,0,39792,robert_l_lane,,226.88,232.544,--There are real impediments to someone else coming in and making that challenge.
1990.89-5011,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,249.814,256.89,"You think a member of the public at large, not a juror who has been excluded, but a member of the public at large would have standing to challenge this?"
1990.89-5011,0,39792,robert_l_lane,,256.89,268.216,"Under the criminal statute, if someone was a witness to it they probably could file a complaint against the prosecutor or the guilty party for a violation of that criminal statute."
1990.89-5011,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,281.945,282.406,All right.
1990.89-5011,0,39792,robert_l_lane,,298.606,309.764,"They would have to meet the requirements that this Court has set down in Singleton v. Wulff and other cases on standing, showing an injury in fact, showing a substantial relationship, and so forth."
1990.89-5011,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,312.385,326.194,"Okay, so you don't consider the deprivation of that interest in having... the whole society's interest in having regular procedures."
1990.89-5011,0,39792,robert_l_lane,,328.746,338.403,"The problem is, Your Honor, is that we're talking about a situation that is not a problem that arises before the trial."
1990.89-5011,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,373.485,379.719,"What are the second and third interests you were going to mention, which I presume one of which does contain the injury in fact?"
1990.89-5011,0,39792,robert_l_lane,,379.719,380.43,"Yes, Your Honor."
1990.89-5011,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,470.708,489.111,Is the showing that's required to elicit an explanation the same when a black venire person is excluded as when a white venire person is excluded?
1990.89-5011,0,39792,robert_l_lane,,490.921,499.117,"Your Honor, if the defendant can make a prima facie showing that that juror has been excluded--"
1990.89-5011,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,499.117,499.527,How do you do that?
1990.89-5011,0,39792,robert_l_lane,,508.834,514.066,"--That would have to be decided on a case-by-case basis, Your Honor, and the defendant would have the burden of showing what--"
1990.89-5011,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,514.066,518.198,Suppose the opposing counsel stands up and says I want an explanation.
1990.89-5011,0,39792,robert_l_lane,,519.938,524.034,--It would be up to the judge at that point to decide whether a prima facie case has been--
1990.89-5011,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,524.034,524.735,How does he decide that?
1990.89-5011,0,39792,robert_l_lane,,524.735,530.888,"--Well, it would be the factors of... he could look at the questions that the prosecutor--"
1990.89-5011,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,530.888,531.539,A peremptory challenge.
1990.89-5011,0,39792,robert_l_lane,,534.299,549.279,"--This Court recognized that a court, in determining that prima facie case, must look at the pattern of questioning, can look at the type of questioning, it could be the prosecutor's attitude in a specific case, it could be the issues in the case."
1990.89-5011,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,550.96,557.776,"The fact that the race of the defendant and the race of the juror is the same or different, those aren't relevant?"
1990.89-5011,0,39792,robert_l_lane,,557.776,564.359,This Court has recognized that where the juror and the defendant are of the same race that the discrimination may be more obvious.
1990.89-5011,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,567.45,582.081,"What's your position of why a defendant who is of the same race as the excluded juror, why does he have standing to raise that issue at all, even though he is of the same race?"
1990.89-5011,0,39792,robert_l_lane,,582.081,588.175,"Every defendant should have standing, Your Honor, regardless of the race of the defendant--"
1990.89-5011,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,588.175,590.158,But why does... why does any of them have standing?
1990.89-5011,0,39792,robert_l_lane,,590.158,592.498,--Because there is clearly--
1990.89-5011,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,592.498,597.581,You think it... must he prove some obvious injury to himself?
1990.89-5011,0,39792,robert_l_lane,,597.581,600.924,--In order to have standing there has to be an injury in fact.
1990.89-5011,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,602.193,602.654,To him.
1990.89-5011,0,39792,robert_l_lane,,602.654,603.395,"--To him, Your Honor."
1990.89-5011,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,603.395,603.986,What is it?
1990.89-5011,0,39792,robert_l_lane,,603.986,611.91,"The injury in this case is that Mr. Powers, just as Mr. Batson, was denied a jury that meets Fourteenth Amendment requirements."
1990.89-5011,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,629.643,631.712,You think this... that sounds like a Sixth Amendment claim.
1990.89-5011,0,39792,robert_l_lane,,631.712,632.333,"No, Your Honor."
1990.89-5011,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,633.755,634.085,What is it?
1990.89-5011,0,39792,robert_l_lane,,634.085,636.186,"It's an equal protection claim, Your Honor."
1990.89-5011,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,637.087,642.261,You mean in... who... what other person is treated better?
1990.89-5011,0,39792,robert_l_lane,,642.261,648.585,--In this situation a black defendant would receive better treatment because he is granted standing--
1990.89-5011,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,648.585,651.828,"Yeah, but I'm talking about a black defendant... I'm talking about a black defendant challenging the exclusion of a black."
1990.89-5011,0,39792,robert_l_lane,,654.539,658.7,--He has been denied a jury that has been chosen in the absence of racial discrimination.
1990.89-5011,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,658.7,659.802,And you says it's an equal protection challenge?
1990.89-5011,0,39792,robert_l_lane,,659.802,660.593,"Yes, Your Honor."
1990.89-5011,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,660.593,664.785,As compared to whom is he being treated worse?
1990.89-5011,0,39792,robert_l_lane,,664.785,684.977,"The defendant in that case, the black defendant and the black juror, he has been denied this jury that protects him, where this jury should come between him and the powers of the Government, and where race enters into that selection of the jury."
1990.89-5011,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,684.977,697.286,"So you're... you give the same answer when you say, when you describe the standing of the white defendant... I mean the white plaintiff... or the white defendant challenging the exclusion of a black."
1990.89-5011,0,39792,robert_l_lane,,701.24,701.911,"Yes, Your Honor."
1990.89-5011,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,701.911,704.121,--Whereas some other people get it.
1990.89-5011,0,39792,robert_l_lane,,704.121,705.333,"Yes, Your Honor."
1990.89-5011,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,710.025,714.887,And you would say the same thing even though there is no claim that the jury was not impartial?
1990.89-5011,0,39792,robert_l_lane,,714.887,731.22,"--Your Honor, the... there is a lack of impartiality here in that in order for a jury to meet Fourteenth Amendment impartiality standards there must not be any racial discrimination in the selection of that jury."
1990.89-5011,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,732.078,735.42,Aren't you confusing impartiality with equal protection there?
1990.89-5011,0,39792,robert_l_lane,,742.266,754.704,"--Your Honor, the equal protection violation that is most succinct to Mr. Powers is that he has been treated differently than a similarly situated black defendant."
1990.89-5011,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,758.036,760.378,"Yes, but does that necessarily go to the impartiality of the jury?"
1990.89-5011,0,39792,robert_l_lane,,760.378,773.327,"--Your Honor, this Court has recognized that when racial discrimination enters into the jury selection process, that that jury does not meet the impartiality test of the Fourteenth Amendment, and a criminal conviction should be reversed."
1990.89-5011,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,773.327,778.25,"Mr. Lane, why do you say he is being treated differently from a similarly situated black defendant?"
1990.89-5011,0,39792,robert_l_lane,,781.092,783.894,Their similar situation is that they are criminal defendants.
1990.89-5011,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,783.894,795.61,"Yes, but... and the black defendant can challenge the prosecutor's decision to strike all blacks from the jury, and the white defendant presumably can challenge the prosecutor's decision to strike all whites from the jury."
1990.89-5011,0,39792,robert_l_lane,,800.853,806.627,"Under the decision of the Franklin County, Ohio, court of appeals, the black, the white defendant does not have that same opportunity."
1990.89-5011,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,812.661,813.613,To challenge white defendants?
1990.89-5011,0,39792,robert_l_lane,,813.613,815.372,"--No, I am sorry."
1990.89-5011,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,816.474,832.236,"No, I am saying why is it a denial of equal... of equal protection if the black defendant can challenge the prosecutor's intentional striking of all black jury persons, and the white defendant can challenge the prosecutor's intentionally striking white ones?"
1990.89-5011,0,39792,robert_l_lane,,833.996,844.751,"Your Honor, the problem with that is that the defendant does not have the opportunity to object to the striking of black defendants... the black jurors."
1990.89-5011,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,844.751,849.997,"Well, neither does the black have the opportunity to object to the striking of white jurors."
1990.89-5011,0,39792,robert_l_lane,,849.997,850.675,"They should, Your Honor."
1990.89-5011,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,850.675,853.928,"Well, maybe they should, but not because of equal protection."
1990.89-5011,0,39792,robert_l_lane,,858.473,863.405,"It is not even handed when you draw lines on racial criteria, Your Honor."
1990.89-5011,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,891.663,898.077,Do you propose the same rule with respect to gender?
1990.89-5011,0,39792,robert_l_lane,,898.077,902.25,"Your Honor, gender is a separate question."
1990.89-5011,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,902.25,907.714,"I know that isn't your case, but we have to be concerned with the consequences of what we write and the reason."
1990.89-5011,0,39792,robert_l_lane,,907.714,917.42,"Your Honor, if this Court has determined that gender is a suspect class for equal protection analysis, then I would say it would be proper to do so."
1990.89-5011,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,922.143,938.713,Your opponent asked us to decide whether the... whether it is similarly unlawful for the defense to strike on the basis of race.
1990.89-5011,0,39792,robert_l_lane,,952.344,955.296,"Yes, Your Honor, that is before the Court."
1990.89-5011,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,955.296,972.99,"It is possible that... so it is really quite possible to have all defendants precluded from striking people of the opposite race, or the same race, or women, or men, or what other categories?"
1990.89-5011,0,39792,robert_l_lane,,988.188,992.982,The issue proffered by the State in the second part of their brief is not properly before this Court.
1990.89-5011,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,992.982,1005.479,"Yes, but how... well, how we come out on this case plays out quite differently depending on how far we are prepared to go in extending the same right to the defense, isn't it?"
1990.89-5011,0,39792,robert_l_lane,,1007.712,1024.142,"It may have an impact, Your Honor, but the fact remains that there are a lot of different issues involved in trying to extend the Batson principles to a defendant's use of peremptory challenges, a lot of issues in addition to racial discrimination."
1990.89-5011,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1039.992,1044.124,"And the defendant, you think, has the right to press their claims as well as his own, right?"
1990.89-5011,0,39792,robert_l_lane,,1044.124,1055.483,"Absolutely, Your Honor, because to bar that claim to the defendant would be to say that this Court is going to condone or tolerate racial discrimination simply because the defendant is not of the same race as the jurors."
1990.89-5011,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1055.483,1060.666,"Of course there is a criminal statute on the books, 18 U.S.C. 243--"
1990.89-5011,0,39792,robert_l_lane,,1060.666,1061.558,"Yes, Your Honor."
1990.89-5011,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1061.558,1066.94,"--I'm sure that is not often invoked, but it is quite specific on this point."
1990.89-5011,0,39792,robert_l_lane,,1066.94,1078.778,"Your Honor, it is not very often invoked, and I believe there is a footnote in Peters that indicates that there have been very, very few convictions under that, and very, very... very few--"
1990.89-5011,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1078.778,1086.002,"But if there is a criminal sanction, it seems to me that maybe that would suffice and we don't need the civil cause of action."
1990.89-5011,0,39792,robert_l_lane,,1086.002,1095.999,"--Your Honor, that statute has been on the books for over 100 years, and as this Court has noted, racial discrimination has continued despite the existence of that statute."
1990.89-5011,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1126.709,1128.501,May I just go back a second?
1990.89-5011,0,39792,robert_l_lane,,1142.068,1142.709,"Yes, Your Honor."
1990.89-5011,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1143.71,1145.081,The defendant isn't a member of that class.
1990.89-5011,0,39792,robert_l_lane,,1145.081,1145.671,--Exactly.
1990.89-5011,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1154.177,1161.102,"So he has third party standing whether he is black or white, and whether the... whether the challengers are black jurors or white jurors."
1990.89-5011,0,39792,robert_l_lane,,1161.102,1162.261,"Absolutely, Your Honor."
1990.89-5011,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1163.233,1176.82,"Well, but you... whether he is raising... if he is... even if he is raising the right, claiming the rights of the jury, the excluded jurors, he has to have an injury in fact himself, doesn't he?"
1990.89-5011,0,39792,robert_l_lane,,1176.82,1177.391,"Yes, Your Honor."
1990.89-5011,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1177.391,1187.138,And that's... and the most you can say to that is that he has just been... that he is entitled to a jury that is selected without discrimination.
1990.89-5011,0,39792,robert_l_lane,,1187.138,1188.959,"It's a very important injury, sir."
1990.89-5011,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1190.06,1193.523,"Well, all you can say, though, is the same thing."
1990.89-5011,0,39792,robert_l_lane,,1195.554,1201.558,"This Court has recognized that, Your Honor, where racial discrimination has existed in the selection of--"
1990.89-5011,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1201.558,1211.435,"Yes, you agree that all you can say is to repeat yourself that he's entitled to that kind of a jury, and if he doesn't get it that's... he's been injured."
1990.89-5011,0,39792,robert_l_lane,,1211.435,1218.467,"--This Court has recognized that, Your Honor, in Vasquez v. Hillery, Rose v. Mitchell, in a lot of other cases."
1990.89-5011,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1234.048,1248.517,"That's because he would... there he had an injury, and the injury was that he had been deprived of an impartial jury, or of the opportunity to have an impartial jury that was granted by the Sixth Amendment."
1990.89-5011,0,39792,robert_l_lane,,1249.308,1253.682,"The impartiality springs from the racial discrimination, Your Honor."
1990.89-5011,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1259.757,1262.758,"Well, I understand that, but this is not a Sixth Amendment claim you are pressing here."
1990.89-5011,0,39792,robert_l_lane,,1263.387,1264.008,"That is true, Your Honor."
1990.89-5011,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1274.636,1283.729,"--So the... there are just lots of cases that say if Negroes are kept out of the jury venire, the defendant has got a good claim."
1990.89-5011,0,39792,robert_l_lane,,1283.729,1287.603,"If racial discrimination exists, Your Honor, that defendant has been harmed."
1990.89-5011,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1289.823,1313.021,"But let's assume there is a Federal statute that says, you know, all jury have to arrive at the court house at 9:00, and the jury doesn't... the jury in this particular case doesn't arrive at 9:00, and you move for dismissal of the case against your client because he's entitled to a jury that arrives at the court house at 9:00."
1990.89-5011,0,39792,robert_l_lane,,1315.583,1320.464,I don't see the analogy there--
1990.89-5011,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1320.464,1320.885,Wouldn't you insist--
1990.89-5011,0,39792,robert_l_lane,,1320.885,1321.666,--with racial discrimination.
1990.89-5011,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1322.525,1326.499,"--Well, wouldn't the judge insist how did the jury not getting there at 9:00 hurt your client?"
1990.89-5011,0,39792,robert_l_lane,,1326.499,1334.964,--It doesn't have that same imprimatur of racial discrimination in impart... in partiality.

1990.89-5011,0,39792,robert_l_lane,,1343.89,1347.203,That he did not have a jury because the jurors arrived late?

1990.89-5011,0,39792,robert_l_lane,,1362.463,1363.932,--Mr. Powers--
1990.89-5011,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1363.932,1365.655,It's the same thing with the jury arriving at 9:00.
1990.89-5011,0,39792,robert_l_lane,,1370.357,1377.242,--The jury must be chosen in the absence of racial criteria.
1990.89-5011,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1416.288,1434.85,"To satisfy you, it would seem to me that if you say that his injury in fact is proved by having Negroes excluded from his jury, I would think you would say that the only Negroes who may be excluded from the jury are those who may be challenged for cause."
1990.89-5011,0,39792,robert_l_lane,,1434.85,1442.255,"--No, Your Honor, because the peremptory challenge is not the same as a challenge for cause, and the injury in fact--"
1990.89-5011,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1442.255,1452.019,"Well, I know, but I would think you would argue that peremptory challenges certainly can't do away with a defendant's right to have the kind of a jury he's entitled to, can they?"
1990.89-5011,0,39792,robert_l_lane,,1452.019,1453.061,"--No, Your Honor, they can't."
1990.89-5011,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1455.563,1467.26,"I know, but you don't think they have to be... the peremptory challenge of a Negro has to be justified by a cause, by technically that he is disqualified for cause?"
1990.89-5011,0,39792,robert_l_lane,,1467.26,1469.831,--The prosecutor has to have nonracial reasons.
1990.89-5011,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1477.809,1478.838,Uh-hum.
1990.89-5011,0,39792,robert_l_lane,,1490.304,1495.74,A juror must be chosen on his personal qualifications and characteristics--
1990.89-5011,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1495.74,1503.996,But you say that might be enough to overcome this entitlement to a jury that... from which blacks aren't excluded?
1990.89-5011,0,39792,robert_l_lane,,1503.996,1507.889,--That a juror is not a... not educated enough?
1990.89-5011,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1517.674,1523.767,I suppose there is a whole range of acceptable excuses for a peremptory challenge short of a challenge for cause.
1990.89-5011,0,39792,robert_l_lane,,1523.767,1525.637,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1990.89-5011,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1525.637,1536.176,"Well, just imagine what one of those, what they are, and then you would say that that overcomes this entitlement to the kind of a jury you have been talking about."
1990.89-5011,0,39792,robert_l_lane,,1536.176,1541.269,"It does, does not overcome it, Your Honor, because this is a constitutional requirement."

1990.89-5011,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1565.905,1567.715,"Which could be all over the lot, I suppose."

1990.89-5011,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1583.257,1585.067,I'm asking you a question.
1990.89-5011,0,39792,robert_l_lane,,1597.786,1602.268,"--If the court, or the trial court, or the reviewing court felt that it was not--"
1990.89-5011,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1602.268,1602.719,"No, I--"
1990.89-5011,0,39792,robert_l_lane,,1602.719,1604.521,--a racial reason for a--
1990.89-5011,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1604.521,1606.831,--We stipulate it is not a proxy for race.
1990.89-5011,0,39792,robert_l_lane,,1606.831,1608.511,--Okay.
1990.89-5011,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1610.975,1612.685,"Well, you say probably."
1990.89-5011,0,39792,robert_l_lane,,1616.028,1619.941,"Well, if we stipulate, as Your Honor said, then it probably... it would survive."
1990.89-5011,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1619.941,1620.48,It would survive.
1990.89-5011,0,39792,robert_l_lane,,1620.48,1623.672,I will use the rest of my time for rebuttal.
1990.89-5011,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1624.343,1626.865,"Very well, Mr. Lane."
1990.89-5011,1,17140,alan_c_travis,,1628.717,1631.44,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.89-5011,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1735.207,1739.168,"What do you do about Peters v. Kiff, and the statutory provision?"
1990.89-5011,1,17140,alan_c_travis,,1739.168,1753.13,"I would say simply to the Court that if the statutory basis were brought, as the middle three opinions of that case suggested, that might be a basis for review or handling of this matter."
1990.89-5011,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1823.004,1825.325,"Batson is the law, I suppose--"
1990.89-5011,1,17140,alan_c_travis,,1825.325,1826.467,Certainly.
1990.89-5011,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1826.467,1836.752,--And what do you understand to be the black defendant's standing to challenge the exclusion of black jurors?
1990.89-5011,1,17140,alan_c_travis,,1838.344,1851.271,"My understanding, Your Honor, is that... and Batson relied so heavily on Casteneda against Partida, that the injury is that members of his race, his cognizable group, have been excluded."
1990.89-5011,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1852.593,1853.374,"Well, how does that hurt him?"
1990.89-5011,1,17140,alan_c_travis,,1853.374,1854.263,I'm sorry?
1990.89-5011,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1854.263,1855.454,How does that hurt him?
1990.89-5011,1,17140,alan_c_travis,,1857.896,1858.687,The petitioner?
1990.89-5011,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1858.687,1861.179,What is the in fact injury?
1990.89-5011,1,17140,alan_c_travis,,1861.179,1874.357,"Well, of course the Court has changed its position since Swain, where there was discussion of the fact that the peremptory challenge was validly used for certain purposes, including--"
1990.89-5011,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1874.357,1881.431,But even Swain said that there would be standing to challenge it if they... if you could show a pattern in practice.
1990.89-5011,1,17140,alan_c_travis,,1881.431,1890.787,"--A pattern in practice, but to my knowledge the Court has never suggested that pattern in practice would have other than a correlation between the defendant and the removed juror."
1990.89-5011,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1890.787,1895.331,"I agree, but I'm still wondering what your notion is of the injury in fact."
1990.89-5011,1,17140,alan_c_travis,,1895.331,1901.954,"Well, it's... it is simply that, and perhaps I'm in Mr. Lane's position on the other side of the Court's question."
1990.89-5011,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1901.954,1910.31,You don't agree that it's... his injury in fact is the fact he has been deprived of a juror... jury that has been--
1990.89-5011,1,17140,alan_c_travis,,1910.31,1912.734,This defendant?
1990.89-5011,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1912.734,1916.175,--that has not been chosen on nondiscriminatory grounds?
1990.89-5011,1,17140,alan_c_travis,,1916.175,1916.513,I am sorry.
1990.89-5011,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1917.995,1923.649,"Well, and the Batson defendant, and the Swain defendant."
1990.89-5011,1,17140,alan_c_travis,,1923.649,1925.98,"No, I don't."
1990.89-5011,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1933.507,1947.426,But is that... can't you say generally then that the defendant has been deprived of a jury that hasn't been chosen on a nondiscriminatory basis?
1990.89-5011,1,17140,alan_c_travis,,1947.426,1955.499,"But once again, I think that that sounds more of a Sixth Amendment fair cross-section claim, which this Court has rejected, than it does a true equal protection claim."
1990.89-5011,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1955.499,1959.383,"Mr. Travis, I am curious to know how far your argument takes."
1990.89-5011,1,17140,alan_c_travis,,1993.053,1994.085,"No, I would say not."
1990.89-5011,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1994.085,1994.766,You'd say not.
1990.89-5011,1,17140,alan_c_travis,,1995.426,1996.536,That would be our position.
1990.89-5011,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1996.536,1997.167,Right.
1990.89-5011,1,17140,alan_c_travis,,1997.167,2047.25,"Quite simply, we take the position that the Equal Protection Clause does not grant standing to this particular defendant, but even if it were to, even if this Court were to conclude that those cases, that historic line of cases which has seemingly required a correlation between the defendant and the excluded juror, even if that series of cases were not what it appears to be and what it has appeared to be to so many lower courts, so many members... or so many members of the circuit courts, then I suggest, as Justice Kennedy raised in his concurring opinion in Holland, that in this case on this record it is not... we don't have a sufficient record in which to determine whether there was a prima facie case advanced at all by the defendant."
1990.89-5011,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2139.631,2145.936,"But isn't it correct that in this case that determination was just not made at all, because the holding was there was no standing?"
1990.89-5011,1,17140,alan_c_travis,,2151.75,2162.275,"Well, Justice Stevens, that's an alternative, but what I am suggesting to the Court is that it is the movant's, the defendant's burden to establish a record to prevail on appeal."
1990.89-5011,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2180.027,2180.608,That's right.
1990.89-5011,1,17140,alan_c_travis,,2180.608,2187.791,"And if it has not been done, if he has failed to establish that prima facie case, then there is no basis to reverse."
1990.89-5011,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2187.791,2193.695,"You're saying if there is no prima facie case we should not reach the standing issue, which would normally be the anterior issue?"
1990.89-5011,1,17140,alan_c_travis,,2193.695,2195.437,If that's not inconsistent.
1990.89-5011,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2195.437,2196.098,Yeah.
1990.89-5011,1,17140,alan_c_travis,,2227.128,2229.388,I think quite clearly they would.
1990.89-5011,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2232.22,2232.921,Uh-hum.
1990.89-5011,1,17140,alan_c_travis,,2242.877,2244.628,I don't believe so.
1990.89-5011,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2296.524,2298.086,"Well, but you don't take the position... I want to be sure."
1990.89-5011,1,17140,alan_c_travis,,2309.423,2310.054,I am sorry.
1990.89-5011,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2311.895,2317.458,"Well, take Craig against Boren, for example, which was a case involving discrimination against females, as I remember."
1990.89-5011,1,17140,alan_c_travis,,2321.521,2326.173,"--If there is a sufficient correlation, and I recognize that that's petitioner's argument."
1990.89-5011,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2326.173,2329.786,--If there is an independent injury other than the discrimination that justifies.
1990.89-5011,1,17140,alan_c_travis,,2339.574,2346.83,"I think that's... I may be giving a fairly weak response to you, Your Honor, but I think that is true in any case where the defendant objects."
1990.89-5011,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2346.83,2347.278,Right.
1990.89-5011,1,17140,alan_c_travis,,2347.278,2351.671,"People object, and I don't mean this facetiously, to virtually anything that the opposing party wants to do."
1990.89-5011,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2351.671,2353.933,You have standing to make all sorts of objections--
1990.89-5011,1,17140,alan_c_travis,,2353.933,2354.955,That's true.
1990.89-5011,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2354.955,2359.817,--and one of them is that you don't like that jury panel because it is unconstitutionally... it was selected in an unconstitutional manner.
1990.89-5011,1,17140,alan_c_travis,,2359.817,2367.433,"Which brings me back to, I believe, the argument made earlier that I think that sounds more of a Sixth Amendment fair cross-section analysis."
1990.89-5011,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2367.433,2369.603,"Well, but that's on the merits, it is, yeah."
1990.89-5011,1,17140,alan_c_travis,,2369.603,2370.423,"On the merits, yes."
1990.89-5011,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2370.423,2376.596,"Counsel, suppose there is a white and an Afro-American charged together."
1990.89-5011,1,17140,alan_c_travis,,2376.596,2378.018,"A what, Your Honor?"
1990.89-5011,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2378.529,2380.23,An Afro-American.
1990.89-5011,1,17140,alan_c_travis,,2380.23,2380.911,Yes.
1990.89-5011,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2380.911,2381.762,You don't know what that is?
1990.89-5011,1,17140,alan_c_travis,,2381.762,2382.24,"No, I didn't hear the next word."
1990.89-5011,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2383.632,2389.926,"Well, there's a white and an Afro-American, two defendants--"
1990.89-5011,1,17140,alan_c_travis,,2389.926,2391.127,Charged.
1990.89-5011,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2391.127,2398.342,--And the charge is made that Negroes have been systematically excluded from the jury.
1990.89-5011,1,17140,alan_c_travis,,2408.858,2414.253,"That is the position of one of the circuits that we cited below, an en banc position--"
1990.89-5011,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2414.253,2415.772,Is that your position?
1990.89-5011,1,17140,alan_c_travis,,2415.772,2419.526,"--We take that position, difficult as it is."
1990.89-5011,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2419.526,2421.366,"You don't think that... go ahead, sorry."
1990.89-5011,1,17140,alan_c_travis,,2421.366,2434.706,"If I may, if I... and perhaps I misspoke myself or spoke too rapidly, I think when you have a correlation with co-defendants you may have a very different position."
1990.89-5011,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2454.728,2457.951,You might have [inaudible].
1990.89-5011,1,17140,alan_c_travis,,2457.951,2479.875,"I have... Your Honor, I have great difficulty with this entire series of cases in dealing with the difficult problem of racial discrimination, but at the same time recognizing that merely because the defendant accuses one of being racially discriminatory in a trial, that the defendant has suddenly reached a prima facie case."
1990.89-5011,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2541.476,2560.107,"Well, if you do have difficulty, I would think you would have difficulty with Swain, too, even saying that you can challenge a prosecutor's systematic and... practice over a series of cases of excluding all Negroes."
1990.89-5011,1,17140,alan_c_travis,,2560.107,2568.183,"No, I would, no, I don't have... I'm saying that I think courts have had difficulty in knowing what a prima facie case is in the context of Batson."
1990.89-5011,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2590.798,2599.023,"So you think they ought to wait until you know whether all of the jurors, or all of the blacks are thrown off?"
1990.89-5011,1,17140,alan_c_travis,,2600.054,2601.595,"No, I don't think that's the case, Your Honor."
1990.89-5011,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2640.31,2653.289,"You don't think it would be a prima facie case if as soon as a black juror is... he doesn't ask him any questions, he just challenges him."
1990.89-5011,1,17140,alan_c_travis,,2653.289,2660.422,"I think perhaps that would be the... something that if I were sitting as trial judge I would, I would perhaps ask."

1990.89-5011,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2766.692,2770.084,"Was that relied on here, in this case?"
