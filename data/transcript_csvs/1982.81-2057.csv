1982.81-2057,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,9.589,"We will hear arguments first this morning in Karcher, Speaker of the New Jersey Assembly against Daggett."
1982.81-2057,0,33833,kenneth_j_guido_jr,,14.367,20.66,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1982.81-2057,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,299.799,309.637,Do we really know what the statistical deviation is on variance from the census figures?
1982.81-2057,0,33833,kenneth_j_guido_jr,,312.152,324.381,What we have in this case is that we have the statement of Dr. Trussell who is a demographer at Princeton... an expert demographer... and a noted authority on the census.
1982.81-2057,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,329.333,351.762,"It was my understanding, though, that there was no real consensus if you will, on what the most recent census variation might be and if there is such a variation people have spoken in national terms which would not necessarily focus it on that--"
1982.81-2057,0,33833,kenneth_j_guido_jr,,351.762,352.464,--That is right.
1982.81-2057,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,456.408,462.077,"--Mr. Guido, what does that 0.7 of one percent translate into in terms of people?"
1982.81-2057,0,33833,kenneth_j_guido_jr,,462.077,476.194,"In terms of people it translates into a deviation of approximately, I think, 3,551 people between the largest and the smallest."
1982.81-2057,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,779.914,786.49,But wasn't it the position of the Court that there were other plans with a still smaller variation?
1982.81-2057,0,33833,kenneth_j_guido_jr,,786.49,794.378,"That is correct, Your Honor, but what we will address is the question of the inadequacies of those plans."
1982.81-2057,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,795.844,797.502,I am patiently waiting.
1982.81-2057,0,33833,kenneth_j_guido_jr,,797.502,826.568,"--While reviewing court drawn plans this Court holds to a higher one vote-one man standard than legislatively drawn plans, this court has upheld plans with similar deviations to that plan challenged in this action out of deference to the legislature although it holds court drawn plans to a higher one man-one vote standard."
1982.81-2057,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,905.943,907.316,Is there proof to that effect in the record?
1982.81-2057,0,33833,kenneth_j_guido_jr,,907.316,908.567,Pardon?
1982.81-2057,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,908.567,910.627,Is there proof to that effect in the record?
1982.81-2057,0,33833,kenneth_j_guido_jr,,910.627,911.145,"In the record, yes."
1982.81-2057,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,929.512,934.808,"And, yet, you structure your own apportionment on the census figures?"
1982.81-2057,0,33833,kenneth_j_guido_jr,,934.808,937.759,"--On the census figures, that is correct, Your Honor."
1982.81-2057,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1009.183,1015.757,Is there any finding by the District Court that it did or did not credit Mr. Trussell... Dr. Trussell's testimony?
1982.81-2057,0,33833,kenneth_j_guido_jr,,1015.757,1022.504,The only... In the District Court the dissenting judge relied upon that information.
1982.81-2057,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1040.075,1043.276,"Counsel, have you finished answering that question?"
1982.81-2057,0,33833,kenneth_j_guido_jr,,1043.276,1044.075,--Yes.
1982.81-2057,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1044.075,1045.588,I wanted to ask you another one.
1982.81-2057,0,33833,kenneth_j_guido_jr,,1055.318,1058.145,I think it is the second one.
1982.81-2057,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1062.957,1064.33,I did not quite hear you--
1982.81-2057,0,33833,kenneth_j_guido_jr,,1064.33,1069.469,"--Because of the nature of that district, if you look at it and if you look at this--"
1982.81-2057,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1076.952,1079.152,--Are there two bodies of water that have to be crossed?
1982.81-2057,0,33833,kenneth_j_guido_jr,,1079.152,1079.64,--Pardon?
1982.81-2057,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1079.64,1082.512,Are there two bodies of water or only one?
1982.81-2057,0,33833,kenneth_j_guido_jr,,1082.512,1084.119,It would have to be... There is one body of water there.
1982.81-2057,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1090.116,1091.879,What is the body of water... body of water?
1982.81-2057,0,33833,kenneth_j_guido_jr,,1097.268,1106.108,"The reality is that even if we drew the district as square, you would still have to at certain times be a yachtsman to cross it."
1982.81-2057,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1106.108,1111.388,Does any district prior to 1980 have that problem?
1982.81-2057,0,33833,kenneth_j_guido_jr,,1111.388,1112.745,At that time?
1982.81-2057,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1112.745,1115.027,Prior to this redistricting.
1982.81-2057,0,33833,kenneth_j_guido_jr,,1115.027,1117.667,"I do not know the answer to that, Your Honor."
1982.81-2057,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1126.928,1130.972,How many of those districts have any genuine community of interest?
1982.81-2057,0,33833,kenneth_j_guido_jr,,1130.972,1132.52,--In all of these districts?
1982.81-2057,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1132.52,1138.533,"How many of them have genuine community of interest either economic, social or political?"
1982.81-2057,0,33833,kenneth_j_guido_jr,,1138.533,1145.342,"Well, Your Honor, it is my understanding and Justice Brennan is probably much more familiar with it... with the State of New Jersey than I am--"
1982.81-2057,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1145.342,1146.309,"Well, I think, in Kirkpatrick--"
1982.81-2057,0,33833,kenneth_j_guido_jr,,1146.309,1166.894,--but the basic goals in this case were to maintain essentially the core districts from the 1970 census and that that essentially reflected the communities of interest at that time in recognition of the fact that there needed to be changes because there was a loss of a district.
1982.81-2057,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1187.795,1200.133,"--Mr. Guido, is that green district that is by Asbury Park and Long Branch, is that all one district?"
1982.81-2057,0,33833,kenneth_j_guido_jr,,1200.133,1202.349,This green district is all one district.
1982.81-2057,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1202.349,1210.159,But the same district isn't extended up to the light green north of the body of water?
1982.81-2057,0,33833,kenneth_j_guido_jr,,1210.159,1211.848,It is different than this--
1982.81-2057,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1211.848,1214.518,There are numbers on that.
1982.81-2057,0,33833,kenneth_j_guido_jr,,1218.765,1220.86,--This here is all one district.
1982.81-2057,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1220.86,1221.983,Thank you.
1982.81-2057,0,33833,kenneth_j_guido_jr,,1221.983,1234.667,"And essentially one of the things I think you have to understand is if you look back at the appendix, you look at this map and you say, well you look at these districts and they have these sort of puzzle kind of shapes."
1982.81-2057,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1289.034,1294.096,Did Kirkpatrick say that community of interest was relevant at all in cases of this kind?
1982.81-2057,0,33833,kenneth_j_guido_jr,,1294.096,1296.342,"--In Kirkpatrick, no it did not, Your Honor."
1982.81-2057,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1331.282,1335.516,"But Judge Gibbons said that minority interest was pretextual in this case, didn't he?"
1982.81-2057,0,33833,kenneth_j_guido_jr,,1335.516,1361.694,"--Your Honor, what the Court said in this case about the minority interest was that essentially there was no connection... they could not find a linear connection between the tenth district and the fourth district that concerns the minority interest was affected and the deviations that were in this case."
1982.81-2057,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1443.049,1457.871,"Mr. Guido, I want to be sure about one thing... I believe Justice Powell referred to it... all three members of the panel below agreed on the pretextual aspect of the preservation of minority--"
1982.81-2057,0,33833,kenneth_j_guido_jr,,1457.871,1461.12,All three members on the panel below rejected the argument.
1982.81-2057,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1461.12,1464.571,--All three agreed it was pretextual?
1982.81-2057,0,33833,kenneth_j_guido_jr,,1464.571,1483.628,"I remember one of them using the word pretextual, Your Honor, but I would concede that point for purposes of the argument, and that the basis that they did say was is that they said no one could develop a linear connection between the deviations and the concern for minority voting strength in this case."
1982.81-2057,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1525.36,1534.216,"May I ask one question about the lack of compactness of the districts that Justice Powell eluded to with District 3, I guess it is."
1982.81-2057,0,33833,kenneth_j_guido_jr,,1553.598,1557.254,"--No, what the concern was here was, as I pointed out at the outset--"
1982.81-2057,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1557.254,1558.221,"Well, I understand there were other concerns."
1982.81-2057,0,33833,kenneth_j_guido_jr,,1559.25,1560.564,--Did they include compactness--
1982.81-2057,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1560.564,1561.89,--that as of any value at all to that?
1982.81-2057,0,33833,kenneth_j_guido_jr,,1561.89,1570.294,"--In my discussions with them, there were some concerns, but that concern was down the line."
1982.81-2057,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1584.524,1588.599,"Well, also I suppose, preserving the majority control of the Legislature?"
1982.81-2057,0,33833,kenneth_j_guido_jr,,1588.599,1591.96,"I would like to save a few minutes for rebuttal, if I might."
1982.81-2057,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1591.96,1594.783,May I ask if that was admittedly one of the concerns?
1982.81-2057,0,33833,kenneth_j_guido_jr,,1594.783,1596.097,"What, compactness?"
1982.81-2057,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1596.097,1602.047,"No, preserving majority control of the maximum number of districts possible?"
1982.81-2057,0,33833,kenneth_j_guido_jr,,1602.047,1604.687,"Oh, democratic majority control?"
1982.81-2057,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1604.687,1605.186,Yes.
1982.81-2057,0,33833,kenneth_j_guido_jr,,1605.186,1617.057,"There was some concern by some members that there be fairness to all of the incumbents, and, in fact, there were discussions with one of the republicans who was very concerned about his vulnerability."
1982.81-2057,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1625.976,1631.926,Mr. Hellring.
1982.81-2057,1,17706,bernard_hellring,,1631.926,1635.704,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1982.81-2057,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1930.459,1934.691,"Mr. Hellring, how would you define gerrymandering as you pronounce it?"
1982.81-2057,1,17706,bernard_hellring,,1934.691,1956.512,I would suggest looking at this map and saying that twisting district number seven in such a way that it has come to be known as the fishhook district is gerrymandering.
1982.81-2057,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1963.024,1966.771,"Well, you might call number four a running back district, too, I guess."
1982.81-2057,1,17706,bernard_hellring,,1979.719,1989.763,"--In answer to Your Honor's question, I think this is what it means under the cases decided by this Court."
1982.81-2057,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2083.46,2091.221,Does gerrymandering mean that the district has been drawn for ulterior political motives?
1982.81-2057,1,17706,bernard_hellring,,2091.221,2093.252,"Yes, it does."
1982.81-2057,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2123.192,2125.38,Is that factual?
1982.81-2057,1,17706,bernard_hellring,,2125.38,2127.689,"It is, and it is in the record."
1982.81-2057,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2150.134,2158.662,You don't have any cases in this Court that invalidated gerrymandering of the kind you have just described?
1982.81-2057,1,17706,bernard_hellring,,2158.662,2161.084,--We have none.
1982.81-2057,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2164.925,2168.361,We have not avoided... We have not always avoided the question of a gerrymander.
1982.81-2057,1,17706,bernard_hellring,,2173.376,2177.997,"--Well, but in that case you were dealing with not a congressional redistricting--"
1982.81-2057,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2177.997,2182.684,"I know, but the way you talk it would make no difference whether it is state or federal."
1982.81-2057,1,17706,bernard_hellring,,2193.805,2195.443,--Justice White--
1982.81-2057,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2195.443,2198.301,"Yet, Gaffney against Cummings held quite to the contrary."
1982.81-2057,1,17706,bernard_hellring,,2198.301,2205.409,"--Not in a congressional redistricting case, and this Court has expressed repeatedly the importance of maintaining--"
1982.81-2057,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2205.409,2214.64,"So, you do not think that the political gerrymandering... You concede the political gerrymander in Gaffney against Cummings did not violate the Equal Protection Clause?"
1982.81-2057,1,17706,bernard_hellring,,2214.64,2217.156,"--Your Honor, please, I am not arguing that case."
1982.81-2057,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2219.67,2222.233,Are you making a constitutional argument?
1982.81-2057,1,17706,bernard_hellring,,2222.233,2223.013,--No.
1982.81-2057,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2225.948,2229.556,"Well, are you making a constitutional argument or a statutory argument?"
1982.81-2057,1,17706,bernard_hellring,,2229.556,2231.555,I am making an argument--
1982.81-2057,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2231.555,2233.459,"Well, is it constitutional, or not?"
1982.81-2057,1,17706,bernard_hellring,,2233.459,2236.052,--It is not a constitutional argument.
1982.81-2057,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2236.052,2236.66,What is it?
1982.81-2057,1,17706,bernard_hellring,,2236.66,2238.848,It is an argument that under Kirkpatrick--
1982.81-2057,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2238.848,2240.583,What is Kirkpatrick?
1982.81-2057,1,17706,bernard_hellring,,2240.583,2258.685,"--Kirkpatrick is a statement by this Court on the meaning of Article I, Section 2 of the United States Constitution when it says that the members of the House of Representatives shall be elected by the people."
1982.81-2057,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2259.777,2261.715,"Well, you are making a constitutional argument."
1982.81-2057,1,17706,bernard_hellring,,2261.715,2262.402,--Well--
1982.81-2057,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2262.402,2264.028,But not an equal protection argument?
1982.81-2057,1,17706,bernard_hellring,,2264.028,2305.884,"--Well, if Your Honor, please, I am not making an equal protection argument, and my argument about gerrymandering is a constitutional argument only in the sense that it relates to the issue of good faith as that is given to us by the United States Supreme Court in testing... for the purpose of testing whether a given population deviation in a given statute is or is not the unavoidable result of a good faith effort to arrive at the smallest possible population deviation."
1982.81-2057,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2323.861,2338.418,What if you achieved absolute equality... you took the very lowest plan there was and you still had fishhook and running back districts and they still were in that form for political purposes--
1982.81-2057,1,17706,bernard_hellring,,2338.418,2339.744,"But, you would not have."
1982.81-2057,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2426.602,2436.595,"--Change its ideas if Kirkpatrick and White against Weiser is supposed to be read that way, they ought to cut into those two cases."
1982.81-2057,1,17706,bernard_hellring,,2436.595,2476.031,"Well, may I then suggest, Your Honor, that if there is any addition to be made by this Court in this case by way of further explanation of the meaning of Article I, Section 2 by way of further discussion as to what Kirkpatrick may not have said enough times and what Your Honor, Justice White, said in White against Weiser was not said enough times, then it seems to me that this Court should take the occasion to reemphasize the doctrine of one man-one vote."
1982.81-2057,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2500.899,2504.819,"You are not saying that that was unanimous, are you?"
1982.81-2057,1,17706,bernard_hellring,,2504.819,2505.946,"--Pardon me, sir?"
1982.81-2057,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2505.946,2508.647,"You are not saying that that was unanimous all over the country, are you?"
1982.81-2057,1,17706,bernard_hellring,,2510.692,2517.471,Your Honor has me there.
1982.81-2057,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2599.108,2600.122,May I ask you--
1982.81-2057,1,17706,bernard_hellring,,2600.122,2601.358,And that is in the whole state.
1982.81-2057,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2601.358,2613.322,--May I ask you two questions about your gerrymandering argument and the base motive that you described to the dominant party in trying to have as many districts of the same political flavor.
1982.81-2057,1,17706,bernard_hellring,,2638.501,2639.281,I would not.
1982.81-2057,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2648.183,2649.79,"Let me give you a second case, then."
1982.81-2057,1,17706,bernard_hellring,,2674.859,2678.95,"Well, first of all--"
1982.81-2057,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2678.95,2682.074,In the second you say the reason is the same as in my other case?
1982.81-2057,1,17706,bernard_hellring,,2682.074,2682.764,--Yes.
1982.81-2057,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2685.213,2685.872,That is right.
1982.81-2057,1,17706,bernard_hellring,,2685.872,2708.127,"Well, in such a case where the population deviation was zero, then it should be held constitutional and not struck down unless this Court is ready to say that we will consider whether gerrymandering alone in its most extreme form is unconstitutional."
1982.81-2057,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2708.127,2708.502,I want your answer.
1982.81-2057,1,17706,bernard_hellring,,2709.504,2710.798,But under the law that exists--
1982.81-2057,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2710.798,2711.734,You keep rephrasing my question.
1982.81-2057,1,17706,bernard_hellring,,2711.734,2714.14,"--Under the law that exists today, it is a constitutional act."
1982.81-2057,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2714.14,2715.547,You say it would be?
1982.81-2057,1,17706,bernard_hellring,,2715.547,2716.265,Yes.
1982.81-2057,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2716.265,2718.733,"And, you think that is what Gaffney decides?"
1982.81-2057,1,17706,bernard_hellring,,2718.733,2723.276,"Well, as to reapportionment it is certain--"
1982.81-2057,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2723.276,2728.525,"There there was an attempt to achieve rough parity between the parties, not have one exploit its dominance."
1982.81-2057,1,17706,bernard_hellring,,2728.525,2738.255,"--Yes, and I think that is, while the facts are different that is generally the concept of Gaffney, which Justice White mentioned."
1982.81-2057,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2738.255,2740.91,"And, would you describe Gaffney as a gerrymander."
1982.81-2057,1,17706,bernard_hellring,,2746.58,2747.797,Yes.
1982.81-2057,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2760.715,2762.903,The objective there was to achieve rough parity between the parties.
1982.81-2057,1,17706,bernard_hellring,,2762.903,2763.371,--Yes.
1982.81-2057,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2765.714,2769.337,"But the lines were drawn with political motivations, isn't that right?"
1982.81-2057,1,17706,bernard_hellring,,2769.337,2772.352,"Well, if Your Honor, please, political motivations--"
1982.81-2057,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2772.352,2773.194,Weren't they?
1982.81-2057,1,17706,bernard_hellring,,2773.194,2775.896,"--Yes, and political motivations are nothing that I--"
1982.81-2057,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2775.896,2778.474,"Well, we are not arguing about what a gerrymander is."
1982.81-2057,1,17706,bernard_hellring,,2778.474,2787.813,"--Well, I did not say that a gerrymander was something which was describable purely because it was something done for political motivations."
1982.81-2057,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2790.812,2800.966,"If it is done deliberately to make sure that a republican rather than a democrat is elected in this district, would you call that a gerrymander or not?"
1982.81-2057,1,17706,bernard_hellring,,2800.966,2801.418,--You see--
1982.81-2057,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2801.418,2803.668,"Well, would you call it a gerrymander or not?"
1982.81-2057,1,17706,bernard_hellring,,2803.668,2806.429,--It depends upon what it did to the people.
1982.81-2057,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2808.149,2814.848,It made sure that democrats in the particular district were going to lose every time.
1982.81-2057,1,17706,bernard_hellring,,2814.848,2841.696,"--But, you see, if it twists and turns and squeaks and makes peculiar lines bad enough in order to prevent people in a certain section from having a chance to vote in the place where they have normally been voting solely to change the results and that is the purpose and that is the result, that is a sign of bad faith."
1982.81-2057,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2845.916,2850.193,Your kind of gerrymander has to have the element of bad faith in it?
1982.81-2057,1,17706,bernard_hellring,,2850.193,2864.049,"No, it has to have the element of destroying what is normal for purposes which are bad."
1982.81-2057,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2864.049,2879.619,"Well, Mr. Hellring, it sounds to me like your argument concedes that every party in power when drawing district lines can and will try to benefit its own party members in drawing those lines."
1982.81-2057,1,17706,bernard_hellring,,2892.57,2895.694,"Well, I would like to say it is all right--"
1982.81-2057,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2895.694,2900.627,"And, to what extent do we have to require compact districts?"
1982.81-2057,1,17706,bernard_hellring,,2900.627,2908.422,"--I would like to say that I agree with everything Your Honor put in Your Honor's question, and I agree with almost all of it except the word ""neatness""."
1982.81-2057,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2911.874,2914.45,Are you looking for compactness?
1982.81-2057,1,17706,bernard_hellring,,2914.45,2918.588,--Reasonable compactness... reasonable.
1982.81-2057,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2923.368,2928.492,Is that a constitutional requirement in these redistricting... compactness?
1982.81-2057,1,17706,bernard_hellring,,2928.492,2928.835,--Not yet.
1982.81-2057,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2960.558,2962.555,"Well, let me ask you another question."
1982.81-2057,1,17706,bernard_hellring,,2999.978,3001.351,--That was in Kirkpatrick.
1982.81-2057,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3001.351,3008.101,Our Court has suggested protecting incumbents as a possible justification.
1982.81-2057,1,17706,bernard_hellring,,3010.788,3014.347,"Well, I think there could be others."
1982.81-2057,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3022.705,3026.733,Would you propose that any others should be?
1982.81-2057,1,17706,bernard_hellring,,3026.733,3037.541,"Compactness in the sense of avoiding extremes in gerrymandering, would be one."
1982.81-2057,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3037.541,3048.956,"So, that it would be your view that if the higher deviation were more compact on the map that that would be a justification for the higher deviation?"
1982.81-2057,1,17706,bernard_hellring,,3048.956,3051.269,Based on degree.
1982.81-2057,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3085.022,3095.766,Is it your view that protection of municipal or district boundaries is a consideration that should permit a higher deviation.
1982.81-2057,1,17706,bernard_hellring,,3095.766,3103.998,"--It is, but I know that this Court has so far not accepted that as a valid ground."
1982.81-2057,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3464.96,3466.898,"Do you have anything further, Mr. Guido?"
1982.81-2057,2,33833,kenneth_j_guido_jr,,3466.898,3468.321,"Yes, I do, Your Honor."
1982.81-2057,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3468.321,3470.77,You have three minutes remaining.
1982.81-2057,2,33833,kenneth_j_guido_jr,,3470.77,3492.825,"After listening to the Appellees' argument, I am a bit curious whether or not this case is about population equality or whether it is about gerrymandering or some sort of set of statutory standards about compactness or what."
1982.81-2057,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3678.092,3678.919,Your time is--
1982.81-2057,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3678.919,3686.962,"Just one very brief question on the compactness problem and the study, the Rutgers study that you called our attention to."
1982.81-2057,2,33833,kenneth_j_guido_jr,,3697.569,3698.209,"--No, Your Honor."
1982.81-2057,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3707.096,3707.798,"--Thank you, gentlemen."
