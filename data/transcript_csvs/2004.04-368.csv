2004.04-368,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,7.21,We'll hear argument now in Arthur Andersen v. United States.
2004.04-368,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,8.831,11.604,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2004.04-368,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,139.177,148.874,But suppose you persuaded... and I know that is not this case... suppose you persuaded the person to destroy the documents in order to conceal a fraud.
2004.04-368,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,151.524,155.343,"If... Your Honor, if it was a crime, then, yes--"
2004.04-368,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,155.343,163.555,"Well, in order to... let's say it's a revenue audit, and you know that it's a fraud, and you persuade somebody to destroy the documents in order to conceal the fraud."
2004.04-368,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,163.555,172.223,"--Okay, if this is in a... in the course of a proceeding, of course, it's obviously going to be a crime, it's obviously going to be prohibited by Section 1512."
2004.04-368,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,176.371,176.958,Yes.
2004.04-368,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,176.958,185.32,"--is likely, then the answer depends on whether you know that you are concealing... that you know a crime has been committed."
2004.04-368,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,192.62,196.444,"My question is, Does that give... would that give some content to the meaning of ""corruptly"", in your view?"
2004.04-368,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,196.444,207.581,"--Well, in that case, if the witness knows that you have committed a crime, and you are asking them to violate, they have a duty, under those circumstances, not to assist you in concealing your offense."
2004.04-368,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,243.16,243.777,May I--
2004.04-368,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,243.777,243.879,That's a crime--
2004.04-368,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,243.879,250.279,"--may I ask you about another provision, Section 1515(c)?"
2004.04-368,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,277.606,285.776,"--Your Honor, the... that section was not argued to the District Court, but it was invoked in the following way, in two ways."
2004.04-368,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,318.96,320.772,How do you know it's not an affirmative defense?
2004.04-368,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,320.772,323.354,"--Well, it doesn't read like an affirmative defense, Your Honor."
2004.04-368,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,343.061,345.162,"Well, of course, it has the word ""lawful"","
2004.04-368,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,355.551,362.479,"--Well, Your Honor, under the Government's definition of ""corruptly"", she couldn't have been providing lawful bona fide services."
2004.04-368,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,362.479,375.187,"Well, that's what I want to know, is, in light of the Government's position and the way this case was resolved, how does that fit, and what does it do to, that so-called safe-harbor provision?"
2004.04-368,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,377.095,398.566,"Your Honor, I think it negates it in its entirety, because what the jury was instructed in this case was that any intent to impede the fact-finding ability of a possible future proceeding, even if the Andersen employee had a good-faith and sincere belief that their conduct conformed to the law, was corrupt."
2004.04-368,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,401.201,405.702,"Well, does that have the effect of negating the safe-harbor provision, in your view?"
2004.04-368,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,405.702,406.778,Absolutely.
2004.04-368,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,419.389,424.866,"What's the effect, in 1512(b), of the word ""knowingly""?"
2004.04-368,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,424.866,443.66,"I think, Your Honor, that ""knowingly"" means, in this context... just as it means ""knowingly intimidate"", ""knowingly threatened"", ""knowingly corruptly persuade""... that means that you have to know that your persuasion is asking the witness to violate their duties, to violate the law."
2004.04-368,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,445.33,453.27,"Isn't that satisfied at least by the part of the definition that refers to ""subverting an official proceeding""?"
2004.04-368,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,467.441,471.131,"I don't think so, Your Honor, because the definition that was given to this jury was"
2004.04-368,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,480.511,480.649,I--
2004.04-368,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,480.649,481.967,--including a governmental inquiry.
2004.04-368,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,481.967,491.065,"--I think I would go far in agreeing with you if the... if the instruction had been ""merely to impede"" or ""merely to undermine""."
2004.04-368,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,513.427,513.672,Impede.
2004.04-368,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,517.331,517.885,Okay.
2004.04-368,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,518.003,518.674,"But it says ""or""."
2004.04-368,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,518.674,520.409,--I... one other question.
2004.04-368,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,544.221,562.382,"Your Honor, I'm not certain of the answer, except that I do know that the Government did argue that simply... the mere idea that David Duncan testified that, you know, he thought that the... somebody at the SEC might want to look at this information someday was sufficient to satisfy the instructions."
2004.04-368,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,642.898,643.842,How does--
2004.04-368,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,643.842,644.669,--of an inquiry.
2004.04-368,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,644.669,664.055,"--how does... how does David Duncan's guilty plea... he entered a plea of guilty to a charge of obstruction, and he confessed the intent to impede the SEC investigation by shredding documents."
2004.04-368,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,674.22,686.827,"Your Honor, he plead guilty to the offense, as described to him and agreed upon between him and his lawyer; in other... and the Government... which is basically the instruction that was given in this case."
2004.04-368,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,707.158,708.609,"What sentence did he get, by the way?"
2004.04-368,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,708.609,710.704,"He's not been sentenced yet, Your Honor."
2004.04-368,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,823.133,826.391,"I assume it also would make ""intimidate"", and so forth, quite superfluous."
2004.04-368,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,826.391,830.925,"--It absolutely would, Your Honor, because it would basically cover any kind of request."
2004.04-368,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,880.685,902.647,"Suppose you're anticipating a revenue audit from the Internal Revenue Service or from the SEC, and you destroy certain documents that you're not required to keep, but that would make the officials' task easier; he you could perform the audit in just a couple of days, instead of... it's going to take him a week."
2004.04-368,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,904.22,917.83,"Your Honor, under Section 1519, now, it may well be that that is criminal behavior, because it... Congress has now, basically, required you to preserve documents."
2004.04-368,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,936.841,940.735,"There is, in the case, this lingering feeling that something's wrong out there."
2004.04-368,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,946.692,951.817,"Well, and I think that this statute, reasonably read, Your Honor, tells you exactly what that specific thing is."
2004.04-368,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1037.126,1040.81,"Suppose I just don't like the IRS, and I know they're coming."
2004.04-368,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,1053.403,1056.762,"--Section 1519, I don't think you can."
2004.04-368,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1076.453,1098.442,"Ms. Mahoney, we... you know, we all know that what are euphemistically termed ""record-retention programs"" are, in fact, record-destruction programs, and that one of the purposes of the destruction is to eliminate from the files information that private individuals can use for lawsuits and that Government investigators can use for investigations."
2004.04-368,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,1126.999,1129.634,"Well, they certainly hadn't said it in the fall of 2001, Your Honor."
2004.04-368,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1131.138,1131.921,"Well, but I... well, yeah, but--"
2004.04-368,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,1131.921,1132.14,--But--
2004.04-368,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1132.14,1133.277,"--but your argument is, you know,"
2004.04-368,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,1137.325,1137.633,--Well--
2004.04-368,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1137.633,1138.37,----in 2002.
2004.04-368,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,1138.37,1138.993,--let me put it this way.
2004.04-368,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1173.382,1175.077,"And what is a ""document""?"
2004.04-368,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,1182.384,1183.323,"Absolutely, Your Honor."
2004.04-368,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1271.709,1274.445,Was Section 1519 at issue?
2004.04-368,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,1274.445,1275.459,"--No, Your Honor."
2004.04-368,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1307.157,1307.844,Wait a minute--
2004.04-368,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,1307.844,1307.951,--but they didn't.
2004.04-368,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1307.951,1312.921,--wasn't there another provision in effect that said it doesn't matter whether the... whether the proceeding is pending?
2004.04-368,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,1313.854,1317.693,"Well, that... no, that's just 15--- that's 1512, for witness tampering."
2004.04-368,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1322.674,1322.813,Right.
2004.04-368,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,1322.813,1326.193,"--that's Section 1505, and the proceeding must be pending."
2004.04-368,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1329.232,1338.948,"But I... just to make it clear, I take it you would still have the same objection to the deficiency of the corruption instruction, even if a proceeding were pending, or am I wrong about that?"
2004.04-368,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,1338.948,1342.526,"Well, if a proceeding is... yes, we would, in this case."
2004.04-368,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1388.651,1402.144,"So, it was proper, then, for Michael Odom to tell the Andersen personnel when he's encouraging them to follow the policy... he said,"
2004.04-368,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,1419.59,1420.62,"Yes, Your Honor."
2004.04-368,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1420.62,1424.924,"That's fine for him to make that linkage between,"
2004.04-368,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,1431.467,1437.946,"Your Honor, at the time that he made that statement, what that statement actually reflects is the Pettibone rule."
2004.04-368,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1493.713,1496.187,Odom wasn't saying this in the abstract.
2004.04-368,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,1498.528,1504.228,"--No, Your Honor, it was just a training session that was just a... a section of the training session."
2004.04-368,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1507.834,1513.007,"At the time of that training, were there not other proceedings involving Arthur Andersen?"
2004.04-368,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,1513.007,1513.796,"--No, Your Honor."
2004.04-368,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1515.722,1517.834,"There were, involving Enron, at that point, isn't that correct?"
2004.04-368,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,1519.439,1520.154,"--No, Your Honor."
2004.04-368,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1529.993,1531.576,"Very well, Ms. Mahoney."
2004.04-368,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1533.737,1536.835,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2004.04-368,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1549.742,1558.751,"Well, Section 1519, enacted subsequently, comes closer to the mark, doesn't it, than 1512?"
2004.04-368,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1558.751,1563.273,"--Justice O'Connor, Section 1519 was enacted after the events--"
2004.04-368,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1563.273,1563.694,Right.
2004.04-368,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1563.694,1571.768,--in this case in order to plug the loophole that Arthur Andersen has pointed out existed in Section 1512 at the time.
2004.04-368,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1571.768,1572.963,So you think it's superfluous.
2004.04-368,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1580.557,1581.181,No.
2004.04-368,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1584.627,1585.869,Wherein does it go further?
2004.04-368,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1585.869,1589.943,It reaches single-actor obstructive conduct.
2004.04-368,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1591.436,1597.28,"Well, what about the Pettibone interpretation that has been outstanding for a long time?"
2004.04-368,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1597.28,1605.019,"--Pettibone applied, Justice O'Connor, to a specific statute, Section 1503, and it's similarly incorporated in 1505."
2004.04-368,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1648.052,1649.439,When can they do it?
2004.04-368,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1668.19,1670.594,"No, that's not our theory Justice Scalia--"
2004.04-368,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1670.594,1670.712,What is your theory?
2004.04-368,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1670.712,1684.29,"--Our theory is that a person acts corruptly when anticipating a reasonable possibility of an investigation into a specific matter, directs another person to destroy documents that are potentially relevant."
2004.04-368,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1684.29,1686.69,"""A reasonable possibility of an investigation. """
2004.04-368,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1686.69,1687.452,That's right.
2004.04-368,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1687.452,1689.762,And you want criminal liability to turn upon that.
2004.04-368,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1689.762,1690.93,I think that--
2004.04-368,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1690.93,1694.317,Whether or not there is a reasonable possibility of an investigation.
2004.04-368,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1698.215,1702.598,--I don't think there's anything unusual about the decision of that kind of question at all.
2004.04-368,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1713.542,1719.142,"Suppose I have a company and I know that the pattern is, I'm going to be audited every five years by the IRS."
2004.04-368,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1754.79,1760.475,"--Justice Kennedy, it turns on whether the intent there is to subvert, undermine, or impede the proceeding."
2004.04-368,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1764.81,1766.692,"Well, it would be prohibited to tell somebody to do it."
2004.04-368,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1766.692,1767.374,That's right.
2004.04-368,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1767.374,1768.879,But you could do it.
2004.04-368,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1771.231,1772.281,That was a--
2004.04-368,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1772.281,1773.502,Doesn't that seem strange to you?
2004.04-368,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1773.502,1775.48,"--It seemed strange to Congress, too."
2004.04-368,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1780.231,1784.668,I would suggest that it throws a spotlight on the fact that your theory is wrong.
2004.04-368,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1800.506,1806.421,"--What was weird about it, Justice Scalia, is that it allowed the person to do it himself."
2004.04-368,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1807.173,1809.919,"Well, let me ask you about this precise thing."
2004.04-368,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1821.672,1822.247,--It wasn't--
2004.04-368,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1822.247,1822.365,Is that right?
2004.04-368,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1822.365,1823.822,--prohibited by this statute.
2004.04-368,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1824.681,1825.688,It would not have been a violation.
2004.04-368,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1825.688,1826.408,--That's right.
2004.04-368,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1826.408,1839.036,"But the Government got the conviction, got him to plead guilty, apparently, on the basis that if he asked somebody else to do what was perfectly lawful for him to do, it would violate the statute."
2004.04-368,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1839.036,1840.861,"That's right, Justice O'Connor."
2004.04-368,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1840.861,1850.108,"Well, what... how do you read that in coordination with the so-called safe-harbor provision for legal advice and so on?"
2004.04-368,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1850.108,1855.179,I don't think that the safe-harbor provision substantially bears on this case at all.
2004.04-368,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1861.413,1864.644,"And the woman lawyer never raised it, is that right?"
2004.04-368,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1864.644,1878.574,"--Nancy Temple was not a defendant in this case, but her conduct was at issue, because, after having immediately recognized that an SEC investigation was highly probable, Nancy Temple sends out a document reminder saying--"
2004.04-368,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1878.574,1878.692,Well--
2004.04-368,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1878.692,1880.078,"--basically, ""purge the files""."
2004.04-368,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1880.078,1890.835,"--But under this statute, with the safe-harbor provision in it, is it unlawful for her, as a lawyer, to say, ""You can destroy these documents""?"
2004.04-368,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1890.835,1897.677,"Yes, it is, in this case, if her intent was to subvert, undermine, or impede the--"
2004.04-368,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1897.677,1905.714,But your definition of IRS audit.
2004.04-368,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1917.97,1929.558,"--I don't think so, Justice Kennedy, because the Government's position here has never been that the mere existence of a document-destruction policy used under routine circumstances is a violation of the statute."
2004.04-368,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1943.884,1946.14,"Well, that's like in... the old... the rule in the Army,"
2004.04-368,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1950.647,1952.646,I don't see--
2004.04-368,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1952.646,1953.174,You used words--
2004.04-368,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1953.174,1955.77,"--Under this statute, Justice Kennedy, that's not the issue."
2004.04-368,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1969.252,1970.233,"Yes, it was."
2004.04-368,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1982.691,2013.726,"Yes, but that was triggered, in part, by Nancy Temple's recognition... in the midst of serving on a crisis response team, recognizing that Enron was in the process of imploding, Arthur Andersen, which was basically on probation with the SEC... because it had been previously sanctioned, twice, during the prior summer, and was under a cease and desist order... and seeing the SEC coming down the pike, at that moment, she decides to remind the Enron team, which had not been at all compliant with this document-retention policy,"
2004.04-368,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2029.901,2033.432,He says that occurred before Enron had even gotten a letter.
2004.04-368,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2033.432,2034.947,But not--
2004.04-368,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2034.947,2035.486,That meeting.
2004.04-368,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2035.486,2043.538,"--not before Enron's problems had begun to become... surfacing in the Wall Street Journal, in the financial press, the stock price was sliding."
2004.04-368,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2064.183,2069.59,"If you... if you had alleged that they did this in order to cover up a fraud, there would be no problem."
2004.04-368,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2080.554,2083.663,"--No other company in the country would do this, Justice Kennedy."
2004.04-368,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2086.377,2091.837,"You say that it would be perfectly okay for this company, or any other one, to destroy their documents."
2004.04-368,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2096.717,2103.246,"--But in an organizational context, that's the only way that directives like this can be given out and implemented."

2004.04-368,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2167.319,2168.144,"--Yes, it would--"
2004.04-368,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2168.144,2168.289,Okay.
2004.04-368,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2168.289,2168.715,"--be ""corrupt""."
2004.04-368,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2168.715,2168.811,Okay.
2004.04-368,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2172.543,2175.269,"I think that it does cover this case, and--"
2004.04-368,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2175.269,2175.487,How?
2004.04-368,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2199.277,2204.514,"--Well, Justice Breyer, I think that the facts of the case are subsumed within the description that you've given."
2004.04-368,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2213.425,2213.68,No.
2004.04-368,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2256.09,2267.925,"--The jury instruction said less than what you have suggested, Justice Breyer, no question about it, but what they did require was that there be an intent to undermine, subvert, or impede the investigation."
2004.04-368,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2268.276,2278.409,"Wasn't... wasn't that instruction, itself, undermined by what I understand to be the instruction that good-faith belief in the legality of what was being done was no defense?"
2004.04-368,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2301.214,2309.283,"--Justice Souter, this is to statute, and the word ""corruptly"" is not a word, that has been ever construed to require consciousness of illegality."
2004.04-368,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2310.035,2311.171,"How about ""knowingly""?"
2004.04-368,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2311.171,2312.254,"Yeah, the word ""knowingly""."
2004.04-368,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2312.254,2312.761,"How about ""knowingly""?"
2004.04-368,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2316.621,2317.699,--Definitely not.
2004.04-368,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2321.982,2323.304,"""Knowingly corruptly""."
2004.04-368,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2323.304,2327.555,"--The word ""knowingly"" does not travel down the statute to modify ""corruptly""."
2004.04-368,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2327.852,2329.127,I don't see why it doesn't.
2004.04-368,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2330.983,2342.348,"--Well, there is a logical break, because if it travel down the statute and reach all the way to ""misleading conduct"", what Congress would have written is a statute, when you read the definition of ""misleading conduct"", that says,"
2004.04-368,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2372.005,2373.151,"Well, it's certainly--"
2004.04-368,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2373.151,2373.268,--embodies knowledge.
2004.04-368,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2373.268,2388.157,"--I mean, I will... I will grant you that the definition that the Government asked for, and got, for ""corruptly persuades"", does have that implication, so far as the ""subvert"" prong is concerned."
2004.04-368,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2408.232,2410.27,Let me try to address each of those.
2004.04-368,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2444.266,2446.905,"Why did... if that is so, why did you need it?"
2004.04-368,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2464.584,2466.206,"--Here is what it adds, Justice Souter."
2004.04-368,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2488.258,2491.363,But you could undermine and be unsuccessful.
2004.04-368,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2498.466,2505.969,"No, but it was to avoid any connotation that the jurors might put on the linkage of those words that the Government sought the use of the word ""impede""."
2004.04-368,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2510.273,2511.793,But not in 1512.
2004.04-368,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2511.793,2513.153,--That's correct.
2004.04-368,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2514.486,2515.163,It's not there.
2004.04-368,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2515.163,2536.533,"--what the Government was doing in this instance was attempting to give content to the word ""corruptly"" that would enable the jurors to know that they can convict if the purpose that the defendant had in dusting off this document policy and using it as a pretext to destroy documents was to interfere with the fact-finding ability of an anticipated proceeding."
2004.04-368,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2536.533,2543.344,"Well, but it sounds like... actually, I'll grant you that it appears in the statute, but that's, in a sense, my problem."

2004.04-368,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2582.968,2583.404,All right.
2004.04-368,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2599.771,2610.715,"--The Court of Appeals addressed the argument, which Petitioner makes, that the definition of ""corruptly"" that was used in this case is redundant and superfluous in light of the additional intent that--"
2004.04-368,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2610.715,2612.715,It's not perfectly redundant.
2004.04-368,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2637.946,2649.87,"--Well, I think that they have a very significant difference, an important function in ensuring that this statute is not applied beyond the scope of protection of the integrity of proceedings, which is what Congress intended it to do."
2004.04-368,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2649.87,2653.988,"Mr. Dreeben, would you indulge me to go back to a previous answer you gave?"
2004.04-368,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2677.752,2683.192,"Justice Scalia, on page 5(a)... or, I'm sorry, on page 3(a)--"

2004.04-368,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2685.671,2685.911,Right.

2004.04-368,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2692.524,2692.779,Right.

2004.04-368,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2693.236,2693.788,Right.
2004.04-368,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2693.788,2695.602,The last phrase in the sequence is
2004.04-368,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2760.997,2762.283,But I don't know how you can avoid that.
2004.04-368,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2762.283,2763.472,--You avoid it--

2004.04-368,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2784.933,2797.812,"--That's right, because 1512 is a direct lineal descendant from the fact that that word appears in Section 1503."
2004.04-368,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2813.103,2813.518,Why--
2004.04-368,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2813.518,2814.11,"And, in that context--"
2004.04-368,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2814.11,2831.027,"--why isn't the answer to your argument that the requirement in (b)... (b) doesn't travel all the way down through the series, but it travels at least as far as ""corruptly persuades""?"
2004.04-368,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2831.027,2835.293,"--Well, that's sort of reading the statute just to achieve a result."
2004.04-368,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2835.293,2836.7,"No, but we know it--"
2004.04-368,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2836.7,2836.828,I think it's contrary to--
2004.04-368,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2836.828,2838.998,--applies to something at the beginning of the series.
2004.04-368,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2858.614,2868.283,"--Because a ""threat"", itself, which is the third term in the series, and the one that precedes the term that's at issue here, also involves an element of scienter or knowledge."

2004.04-368,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2888.848,2896.175,"--He wouldn't, Chief Justice Rehnquist, precisely because it requires that he knowingly use intimidation."
