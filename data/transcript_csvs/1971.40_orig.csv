1971.40_orig,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,5.395,We'll hear arguments next in number 40-Original.
1971.40_orig,0,27884,herman_rosenberger_ii,,32.774,36.714,"Mr. Chief Justice, members of the of the Court."
1971.40_orig,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1130.492,1145.608,Do you mean by that Mr. Rosenberger that you can put a couple of reasonably trained accountants on the job and they could come up with all the essential facts under the test you are now discussing?
1971.40_orig,0,27884,herman_rosenberger_ii,,1145.608,1160.942,"Yes, Your Honor, I think in fact, the test that I am discussing is that the escheat would be given to the state where the creditor's right was accrued, namely the state of issue in all cases except where a draft was issued in the receiving state."
1971.40_orig,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1345.144,1348.266,Very well.
1971.40_orig,1,23524,f_michael_ahern,,1350.712,1353.159,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1971.40_orig,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1431.487,1438.323,"Well, if New York can hold them indefinitely, they don't need to pass an escheat statute, they are getting the same benefit from them as if they had the escheat statute?"
1971.40_orig,1,23524,f_michael_ahern,,1438.323,1442.962,"Well, they would hold them custodially, but they wouldn't be able to use the funds for general purposes."
1971.40_orig,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1442.962,1444.336,They are getting interest on them presumably?
1971.40_orig,1,23524,f_michael_ahern,,1444.336,1448.18,"They would be getting interest Justice Rehnquist, but they wouldn't be able to use the funds."
1971.40_orig,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1454.106,1475.49,"Well but if New York moved in that direction, would it not be within the power of this Court to place a trust of some nature on it to be sure that no subsequent legislation of New York could alter that status?"
1971.40_orig,1,23524,f_michael_ahern,,1475.49,1478.059,"I would assume the Court could issue such an order, Yes Mr. Chief Justice Burger."
1971.40_orig,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1478.059,1489.964,"And the state of the size of New York with its enormous operations and probably has bank balances many, many times exceeding this, that is unused money?"
1971.40_orig,1,23524,f_michael_ahern,,1489.964,1508.095,"That maybe true Mr. Chief Justice, but with the continuing cry for more revenue by all of the states, I think the state of New York is seeking this money for purposes other than just to hold it custodially or they wouldn't have the fine array of legal talent here aggressively pursuing their rights."
1971.40_orig,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1521.731,1524.884,Mrs. Wentworth you may proceed.
1971.40_orig,2,46532,winifred_l_wentworth,,1524.884,1528.159,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1971.40_orig,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1775.556,1781.564,Thank you Mrs. Wentworth.
1971.40_orig,3,30562,julius_greenfield,,1789.954,1795.845,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1971.40_orig,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2021.07,2053.643,"Now if you were taking about a jurisdictional problem in the context of a long-arm statute, I would find that all of those factors very, very relevant, but why isn't the place of issue, what's your view about the place of origin or issue as the most equitable and practical, laying aside other factors?"
1971.40_orig,3,30562,julius_greenfield,,2053.643,2063.248,"Well, in first place Your Honor I think that the place of issuance will frequently differ from the place of origin and that is an important concept --"
1971.40_orig,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2063.248,2071.456,"I am talking about the place where someone goes in, puts the money on the counter, and get the money order, whatever name you want to give that place?"
1971.40_orig,3,30562,julius_greenfield,,2071.456,2077.174,I think that the record in Western Union against Pennsylvania will perhaps answer that question best.
1971.40_orig,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2102.662,2122.345,"Well of course, that's that's because a lot of the factors in the case of this kind are simply unknowable and the pursuit to get the details in each instance would be to costly to determine, but I am talking about a practical equitable test?"
1971.40_orig,3,30562,julius_greenfield,,2122.345,2123.95,"Well sir, I think it's important."
1971.40_orig,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2158.264,2162.045,"Mr. Greenfield you say the application available, are they in New York?"
1971.40_orig,3,30562,julius_greenfield,,2162.045,2164.138,"They are in Minnesota, sir."
1971.40_orig,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2164.138,2165.416,From all over the country?
1971.40_orig,3,30562,julius_greenfield,,2165.416,2169.118,Yes sir.
1971.40_orig,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2169.118,2171.432,Now I have more trouble with New York.
1971.40_orig,3,30562,julius_greenfield,,2171.432,2172.206,Pardon.
1971.40_orig,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2172.206,2176.527,Now I have more trouble with New York because the records are in Minnesota?
1971.40_orig,3,30562,julius_greenfield,,2176.527,2180.392,"Well, I think this is a matter of a spatial question."
1971.40_orig,3,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2196.63,2199.695,Mr. Greenfield why are they in Minnesota?
1971.40_orig,3,30562,julius_greenfield,,2199.695,2203.479,This is one of the offices maintained by Western Union for that purpose.
1971.40_orig,3,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2203.479,2204.557,More space --
1971.40_orig,3,30562,julius_greenfield,,2204.557,2207.091,I suppose.
1971.40_orig,3,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2253.064,2260.147,Isn't that a fairly likely thing to follow if somebody needs money?
1971.40_orig,3,30562,julius_greenfield,,2274.321,2285.283,The significance of the point I made was this judge that Pennsylvania is relying upon only presumption of the State of origin being the state of last known address.
1971.40_orig,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2315.042,2332.383,"Mr. Greenfield in connection with your reference to that record in the Western Union versus Pennsylvania case, even assuming that the payees are very likely to be away from home, isn't that more likely perhaps that the senders are close to homes than the payees?"
1971.40_orig,3,30562,julius_greenfield,,2332.383,2345.377,"There is -- there is that possibility, but I simply point out to you judge that on the state of the record before this Court, there is no basis for the presumption urged by Pennsylvania."
1971.40_orig,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2345.377,2348.582,You think an (Inaudible) reach this judicial notice?
1971.40_orig,3,30562,julius_greenfield,,2348.582,2351.131,"No sir, I do not think it is beyond your reach."
1971.40_orig,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2351.131,2372.61,"Well, if it isn't (Inaudible) you think we must take judicial notice â€“ you think it's reasonable or irrational to assume that -- let's assume that I said it in my own mind that I think at least 75% of the cases, the sender will be sending from his place of his address, you think that would be an irrational --"
1971.40_orig,3,30562,julius_greenfield,,2372.61,2375.357,"I wouldn't characterize it as irrational, but I would say --"
1971.40_orig,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2375.357,2376.157,You say it's wrong --
1971.40_orig,3,30562,julius_greenfield,,2376.157,2380.299,-- that it was unfounded because it was not based upon sufficient information.
1971.40_orig,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2380.299,2380.917,Well but --
1971.40_orig,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2380.917,2384.903,"I agree with you that's the way it is in the record that's true, but --"
1971.40_orig,3,30562,julius_greenfield,,2384.903,2390.555,"I am not talking only about the record judge, I am saying that there is nothing that we know of."
1971.40_orig,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2390.555,2403.04,"It's just so intangible that there no one can really possibly say just from your own experience, what percentage of circumstances senders wouldn't be at home or away from home?"
1971.40_orig,3,30562,julius_greenfield,,2403.04,2405.362,That's true.
1971.40_orig,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2405.362,2413.188,"But we can assume that majority of the money did not originate in New York, it never reached New York."
1971.40_orig,3,30562,julius_greenfield,,2413.188,2415.703,I don't know whether that assumption is tenable judge.
1971.40_orig,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2415.703,2418.546,"Well, how many offices do you have (Inaudible)"
1971.40_orig,3,30562,julius_greenfield,,2418.546,2419.887,I don't know the answer to that but I think --
1971.40_orig,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2419.887,2421.732,You don't know how many offices you have?
1971.40_orig,3,30562,julius_greenfield,,2421.732,2423.886,Offices of Western Union in New York?
1971.40_orig,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2423.886,2425.632,In United States.
1971.40_orig,3,30562,julius_greenfield,,2425.632,2426.982,I don't know the answer to that sir.
1971.40_orig,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2426.982,2427.96,(Inaudible) I would assume --
1971.40_orig,3,30562,julius_greenfield,,2427.96,2429.913,"Of course there are, of course there are."
1971.40_orig,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2429.913,2434.408,Should (Inaudible) that a large majority of money didn't come in New York?
1971.40_orig,3,30562,julius_greenfield,,2434.408,2440.236,The possibility it is that money did not come from New York --
1971.40_orig,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2440.236,2442.915,Isn't that then come close to a probability?
1971.40_orig,3,30562,julius_greenfield,,2442.915,2457.252,Well the probability does exist but what I was trying to point out to Your Honor is that New York being the largest commercial state in the United States and the most active commercial state that this kind of thing could emanate to a very considerable extent from New York.
1971.40_orig,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2457.252,2458.85,Does how much --
1971.40_orig,3,30562,julius_greenfield,,2458.85,2459.611,I am sorry.
1971.40_orig,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2459.611,2466.992,But most of the Western Union money doesn't come from big commercial people they come from military?
1971.40_orig,3,30562,julius_greenfield,,2466.992,2467.726,That maybe so.
1971.40_orig,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2467.726,2469.524,I can take the judicial notice of that.
1971.40_orig,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2469.524,2474.66,What's the range of amounts if â€“ the record shows that I missed it?
1971.40_orig,3,30562,julius_greenfield,,2474.66,2478.38,My understanding is that the amounts range is rather small --
1971.40_orig,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2478.38,2479.462,Is there a mean --
1971.40_orig,3,30562,julius_greenfield,,2479.462,2480.508,Five dollar level --
1971.40_orig,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2480.508,2483.104,Is there a mean figure in this record?
1971.40_orig,3,30562,julius_greenfield,,2483.104,2488.214,"No, there isn't, but I understand that their level would range up to about $25 and perhaps more."
1971.40_orig,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2488.214,2506.751,"I am just trying to guess that figure as an average, but wouldn't, pursuing what Justice White suggested to you, isn't that a matter that's so commonly related to ordinary human experience, that it could be judicially noticed?"
1971.40_orig,3,30562,julius_greenfield,,2533.497,2540.464,The answer to that Your Honor I think in part at least when referring to the Special Master's report is that the special master found to the contrary.
1971.40_orig,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2544.06,2544.856,That there was what?
1971.40_orig,3,30562,julius_greenfield,,2544.856,2550.89,There was no reasonable basis for this presumption.
1971.40_orig,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2550.89,2561.628,"Well then in effect we're to decide the case without having that knowledge or any basis for a fair presumption about it, is that New York's position?"
1971.40_orig,3,30562,julius_greenfield,,2561.628,2564.586,"No, I don't think that's quite the way I would put it."
1971.40_orig,3,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2646.506,2652.739,Mr. Greenfield in this connection whom -- how do you define creditor in that context?
1971.40_orig,3,30562,julius_greenfield,,2652.739,2658.61,This has been defined by the Special Master I think satisfactorily to everybody involved in the case.
1971.40_orig,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2834.723,2853.524,"I take it that there wouldn't be argument about varying the Texas rule if Western Union kept its record in this case, so that the address of the sender was easily ascertainable?"
1971.40_orig,3,30562,julius_greenfield,,2853.524,2856.192,I donâ€™t think there would be any problem with that.
1971.40_orig,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2867.133,2885.306,And then once (Inaudible) that just happened to have kept its books cumulatively and the money came in and it actually made it -- had an easily available form the addressed then there wouldn't be in this argument?
1971.40_orig,3,30562,julius_greenfield,,2885.306,2895.796,"I donâ€™t think there would be, because as I have said before we support the Special Master's report which says, give it to the state of last known address of the creditor."
1971.40_orig,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2895.796,2896.854,As shown on the creditorâ€™s book?
1971.40_orig,3,30562,julius_greenfield,,2896.854,2897.998,As shown on the creditor's books.
1971.40_orig,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2897.998,2900.258,And here the creditor does have some books --
1971.40_orig,3,30562,julius_greenfield,,2900.258,2900.897,Yes he does.
1971.40_orig,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2900.897,2902.879,-- that will cost couple of hundred thousand dollars â€“-
1971.40_orig,3,30562,julius_greenfield,,2902.879,2914.436,"I donâ€™t know whether that estimate is a reliable estimate, but as I have said before New York is prepared to bear its burden in supporting its claim."
1971.40_orig,3,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2914.436,2918.991,Mr. Greenfield this is a question I should I have asked Mrs. Wentworth.
1971.40_orig,3,30562,julius_greenfield,,2930.029,2931.243,I donâ€™t know sir.
1971.40_orig,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2966.572,2980.977,"Letâ€™s assume, you went through Western Union's records and found the application for the money order and the sender gave his name of course, but didnâ€™t give any address."
1971.40_orig,3,30562,julius_greenfield,,2989.335,2997.085,"With one possible variation of what you have said judge, yes, I think it is important to point out that our statue is --"
1971.40_orig,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2997.085,2997.359,I understand â€“
1971.40_orig,3,30562,julius_greenfield,,2997.359,2999.932,-- entirely an custody statute.
1971.40_orig,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2999.932,3003.04,"Alright then, and anyway you would say New York is entitled to possession of the money?"
1971.40_orig,3,30562,julius_greenfield,,3003.04,3004.458,Yes sir.
1971.40_orig,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3004.458,3020.951,"It seems to me at that point, the argument would have made as much force that when the address isn't shown in the books of the company, arguably you should say the address is at the place of sender."
1971.40_orig,3,30562,julius_greenfield,,3025.179,3026.539,I don't follow what you are saying Judge?
1971.40_orig,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3031.05,3047.606,"The books -- what you would say is that the address of the -- the books of the company does show his address, when it shows it specifically or it doesn't show it at all, in the sense that there is a presumption that when he doesn't fill in the blank for an address that he lives there."
1971.40_orig,3,30562,julius_greenfield,,3047.606,3049.01,If you accept that presumption.
1971.40_orig,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3049.01,3061.352,"Yes, but still even if you accepted that presumption it might be that you should actually go through the whole process of looking at those application of course?"
1971.40_orig,3,30562,julius_greenfield,,3061.352,3065.454,I think that will be necessary.
1971.40_orig,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3065.454,3074.18,"Mr. Greenfield, you referred to the fact that New York's an Abandoned Property Custody Statute rather than an escheat statute."
1971.40_orig,3,30562,julius_greenfield,,3093.593,3096.091,"I think there are several answers to that, Your Honor."
1971.40_orig,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3139.206,3156.897,"But if New York has custody of the money and has the benefit of a rule which prevents any other state from coming in and enjoying a superior right, New York has pretty well got an escheat, hasnâ€™t it, so far as the benefit of the money is concerned?"
1971.40_orig,3,30562,julius_greenfield,,3156.897,3172.188,"As I said before Judge, I don't think that it is fair to characterize that as an escheat because we have a history of considerable amounts of claims made after property has been paid into our Abandoned Property Funds."
1971.40_orig,3,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3172.188,3178.673,What is to prevent the New York legislature from adopting an escheat statute tomorrow?
1971.40_orig,3,30562,julius_greenfield,,3178.673,3206.367,"Well, there is nothing to prevent the New York state legislature from adopting such a statute, but I would simply call to your attention that the preamble to our Abandoned Property Law which I believe was one of the forerunners of all of the Abandoned Property Laws in this country is that these funds are to be used for the benefit of the public at large while protecting the interests of the persons to whom, who are entitled to these funds."
1971.40_orig,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3481.032,3485.195,"Thank you, Mr. Greenfield."
1971.40_orig,4,27884,herman_rosenberger_ii,,3487.274,3489.502,"Mr. Chief Justice, members of the Court."
1971.40_orig,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3652.297,3654.249,And they have lets us know?
1971.40_orig,4,27884,herman_rosenberger_ii,,3654.249,3663.313,"No, they have not officially advised the Court."
1971.40_orig,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3794.737,3797.326,"Thank you Mr. Rosenberger, thank you."
