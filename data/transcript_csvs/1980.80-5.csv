1980.80-5,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,5.904,We'll hear arguments next in McCarty v. McCarty.
1980.80-5,0,35758,mattaniah_eytan,,39.291,42.26,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1980.80-5,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,288.587,304.815,"Under California law, assume hypothetically that he had been a physician for General Motors or Du Pont all this time and had precisely the same experience."
1980.80-5,0,35758,mattaniah_eytan,,311.285,311.868,Yes.
1980.80-5,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,370.324,380.347,"Mr. Eytan, supposing that this is ten years prior to the divorce in this case and the husband is in the military."
1980.80-5,0,35758,mattaniah_eytan,,396.808,398.593,"No, I would not so contend."
1980.80-5,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,398.593,409.032,So that it's just the in-the-future retirement pay and not the past accumulations that you're arguing about?
1980.80-5,0,35758,mattaniah_eytan,,409.032,420.924,"Well, I would argue, of course, that the future element of it is very significant, but of course my argument goes way beyond that."
1980.80-5,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,430.762,432.314,Excuse me.
1980.80-5,0,35758,mattaniah_eytan,,448.257,449.209,--Yes.
1980.80-5,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,451.109,455.097,"And other services too, but we're dealing with a physician here now."
1980.80-5,0,35758,mattaniah_eytan,,467.488,479.478,"Yes, Congress has directed its attention specifically on several occasions to the question, how to deal with the needs of wives."
1980.80-5,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,528.475,535.129,"But she collects only a widow's benefit, not the benefit of a retired worker under social security?"
1980.80-5,0,35758,mattaniah_eytan,,535.129,539.933,"--Oh, no, under social security she collects the same benefits as the spouse."
1980.80-5,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,539.933,545.42,"Which is a widow's benefit, not that of the person who has worked, which are quite different."
1980.80-5,0,35758,mattaniah_eytan,,545.42,548.872,"No, I don't think that's correct, if I may respectfully dissent."
1980.80-5,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,749.186,752.905,"Well, but, the Congress passed the Code of Military Justice, didn't it?"
1980.80-5,0,35758,mattaniah_eytan,,752.905,777.806,"Yes, but the point that I'm trying to make, Mr. Justice, is that Congress could not... I don't believe it could... I am making the argument to you that it could not pass the same kind of a formula enactment as it did to the civil service because the consequences for the Army, for the Army retirees, would be far different than for civil servants--"
1980.80-5,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,777.806,783.61,"You mean that a sensible Congress wouldn't pass it, not that it doesn't have the power to pass it?"
1980.80-5,0,35758,mattaniah_eytan,,783.61,785.61,"--Oh, of course, it has the power to do anything it wants."
1980.80-5,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,856.206,857.206,"Mr. Eytan, may I ask you a question, Mr. Eytan?"
1980.80-5,0,35758,mattaniah_eytan,,861.574,862.11,--Yes.
1980.80-5,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,862.11,863.176,He does lose his pension.
1980.80-5,0,35758,mattaniah_eytan,,871.216,871.582,Yes.
1980.80-5,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,926.533,940.86,"Well, Mr. Eytan, supposing on a divorce order to show cause for temporary provisions pending a final decision, the wife asks for $300 alimony."
1980.80-5,0,35758,mattaniah_eytan,,945.93,951.418,"Certainly it can, and Congress has permitted that in express terms."
1980.80-5,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1324.194,1328.479,"As an economic matter, laying aside your statute--"
1980.80-5,0,35758,mattaniah_eytan,,1328.479,1328.712,Yes?
1980.80-5,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1328.712,1333.847,--Isn't every pension a form of deferred compensation?
1980.80-5,0,35758,mattaniah_eytan,,1333.847,1351.975,I of course would agree with you for those pensions which do not require current services and most important those which do not have current liabilities.
1980.80-5,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1398.806,1402.441,Very well.
1980.80-5,1,46555,walter_t_winter,,1406.976,1410.614,Mr. Chief Justice; may it please the Court:
1980.80-5,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1500.955,1504.223,You would say the same thing about a military husband these days?
1980.80-5,1,46555,walter_t_winter,,1504.223,1505.241,--Pardon me?
1980.80-5,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1505.241,1509.86,Would you say the same thing about a military husband these days?
1980.80-5,1,46555,walter_t_winter,,1509.86,1513.562,"Yes, I think it is, it is very definitely so."
1980.80-5,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1669.281,1674.251,"Well, how in the world are there so many of them that don't stay in twenty years?"
1980.80-5,1,46555,walter_t_winter,,1675.318,1677.287,"No, I don't think they're stupid."
1980.80-5,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1680.839,1682.355,"Well, but I mean, you said it's for the money that you get."
1980.80-5,1,46555,walter_t_winter,,1682.355,1683.105,--Pardon me?
1980.80-5,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1683.105,1685.891,"You said, it's for the retirement money."
1980.80-5,1,46555,walter_t_winter,,1685.891,1694.913,"I think that anyone who goes into the service and stays in the service, Mr. Justice, stays in it because they anticipate that retirement."
1980.80-5,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1696.765,1697.931,What does that have to do with this case?
1980.80-5,1,46555,walter_t_winter,,1697.931,1698.898,Pardon me?
1980.80-5,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1698.898,1702.483,What does that have to do with this case?
1980.80-5,1,46555,walter_t_winter,,1702.483,1711.256,"Well, Mr. Justice, it has everything to do with this case simply because what we're talking about is the supremacy requirement."
1980.80-5,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1717.077,1725.582,"Do you want us to take judicial notice that military people and their wives are devoted people, period?"
1980.80-5,1,46555,walter_t_winter,,1728.3,1732.354,"Your Honor, I'd be delighted if you would take judicial notice--"
1980.80-5,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1732.354,1733.404,Do you want us to do any more than that?
1980.80-5,1,46555,walter_t_winter,,1733.404,1734.038,"--Yes, sir."
1980.80-5,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1829.081,1833.718,"I'd suggest you'd better address yourself to the other eight, because they don't usually agree with me."
1980.80-5,1,46555,walter_t_winter,,1835.92,1842.741,"I will address myself to the other eight Justices then, if I may."
1980.80-5,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1864.856,1868.058,"Mr. Winter, I don't really think that's a fair statement of their position."
1980.80-5,1,46555,walter_t_winter,,1882.568,1889.637,"No, Your Honor, I think that there are two things, there are two portions to your questions, if I may address it."
1980.80-5,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1932.581,1938.385,"But there is no railroad retirement divorce law either, and yet Hisquierdo came out the way it did."
1980.80-5,1,46555,walter_t_winter,,1940.82,1943.403,"--Very easily, Mr. Justice."
1980.80-5,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2054.076,2064.015,When does the wife's interest in this retirement pay arise?
1980.80-5,1,46555,walter_t_winter,,2064.015,2067.919,"That depends upon where they come from, Mr. Justice."
1980.80-5,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2067.919,2069.186,"Well, how about California?"
1980.80-5,1,46555,walter_t_winter,,2069.186,2087.297,"In California, in the event that the soldier comes to the State of California, our law with reference to quasi-community property would only arise if there were two very, very distinct requirements."
1980.80-5,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2099.288,2101.74,But it does if you both move there?
1980.80-5,1,46555,walter_t_winter,,2101.74,2105.192,"--They have to do more than that, Mr. Justice."
1980.80-5,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2105.192,2106.294,"They have to get divorced, don't they?"
1980.80-5,1,46555,walter_t_winter,,2106.294,2107.678,"That's part of it, yes."
1980.80-5,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2109.33,2113.365,"The wife has no interest unless there is a divorce, is that right?"
1980.80-5,1,46555,walter_t_winter,,2113.365,2118.019,"--Under quasi-community property, we have to differentiate--"
1980.80-5,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2118.019,2122.138,"Well, I'm talking of this... I don't care about quasi-community property, I want to talk about this pension."
1980.80-5,1,46555,walter_t_winter,,2127.374,2144.067,"--The interest arises if they are California residents or domiciliaries... pardon me, and if it... then, well, if they start out in California and he earns it in California and they start out there and they stay there and get a divorce there, she's had this interest all along."
1980.80-5,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2144.067,2147.788,"Well, I know, but she doesn't have it if they're not divorced?"
1980.80-5,1,46555,walter_t_winter,,2147.788,2154.775,"Oh, yes, she does; she does unless it is under the quasi-community property scheme."
1980.80-5,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2154.775,2162.715,Are you saying it's an inchoate interest until there's some occasion like a divorce to take some legal action about it?
1980.80-5,1,46555,walter_t_winter,,2162.715,2166.082,Only if it is under the quasi-community property.
1980.80-5,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2186.163,2194.852,"But, doesn't the husband have the right to assign his retirement payments?"
1980.80-5,1,46555,walter_t_winter,,2194.852,2199.971,"Well, again, the question then is--"
1980.80-5,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2199.971,2210.611,"Well, here, again, here are two people married, and one of them is a retired Army officer, and they're not divorced, they're living together."
1980.80-5,1,46555,walter_t_winter,,2215.163,2218.301,"--He can't do that under California law, Mr. Justice."
1980.80-5,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2222.553,2225.038,"Well, that's what I wanted to know."
1980.80-5,1,46555,walter_t_winter,,2225.038,2226.888,--This is part of... I'm sorry?
1980.80-5,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2226.888,2230.192,I'm just trying to find out when her interest arises.
1980.80-5,1,46555,walter_t_winter,,2230.192,2238.613,Her interest arises as they earn it because under the community property scheme the husband and wife are working together.
1980.80-5,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2255.624,2264.83,"So, she has... under California law she has an interest enough in the pension payments to keep him from assigning the?"
1980.80-5,1,46555,walter_t_winter,,2264.83,2267.198,"Yes, sir, I believe that she does."
1980.80-5,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2267.198,2268.232,Or from encumbering them?
1980.80-5,1,46555,walter_t_winter,,2269.834,2270.734,"Yes, sir."
1980.80-5,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2420.698,2464.061,"Mr. Winter, in addition to the conventional preemption arguments, it seemed to me that your brother on the other side made another argument, i.e., that California has misconceived what the nature of this property; that instead of it being a run-of-the-mill pension such as was involved in Hisquierdo or such as would be involved in a General Electric pension, this instead of being deferred compensation for present services on active duty is actually compensation for more limited services in retirement."
1980.80-5,1,46555,walter_t_winter,,2474.267,2476.219,"Well, Mr. Justice--"
1980.80-5,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2476.219,2478.237,"Wait, am I right in my assumption?"
1980.80-5,1,46555,walter_t_winter,,2478.237,2484.058,"--Yes, to some degree, but perhaps not to another degree, Mr. Justice."
1980.80-5,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2488.177,2489.593,Of course we do.
1980.80-5,1,46555,walter_t_winter,,2491.043,2500.985,"The fact of the matter is, Mr. Justice, that the retired military officer doesn't really have to do anything any more."
1980.80-5,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2500.985,2504.437,"Well, no, assuming that's true, I said, assuming that's true?"
1980.80-5,1,46555,walter_t_winter,,2504.437,2506.055,Yes?
1980.80-5,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2506.055,2522.564,"That what it is, what so-called retirement pay is, is compensation for the more limited services for which he is liable in retirement, and rather than being deferred compensation for his services performed during active duty."
1980.80-5,1,46555,walter_t_winter,,2522.564,2523.498,Yes.
1980.80-5,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2523.498,2524.85,"Now, assuming that's true?"
1980.80-5,1,46555,walter_t_winter,,2524.85,2526.968,But I don't think that--
1980.80-5,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2526.968,2528.718,Let's not argue about whether or not it is.
1980.80-5,1,46555,walter_t_winter,,2538.86,2543.145,"--Well, I think that our community property law covers that in this way, Mr. Justice."
1980.80-5,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2556.654,2557.571,Their subsequent earnings?
1980.80-5,1,46555,walter_t_winter,,2557.571,2558.787,Their subsequent earnings.
1980.80-5,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2558.787,2559.439,Right.
1980.80-5,1,46555,walter_t_winter,,2559.439,2575.549,"So that if we assume counsel's argument, the way that I can answer that is really simply this, the minute that he gets back into the military and he actually becomes part of the active duty again, then he is paid--"
1980.80-5,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2575.549,2576.366,Full pay.
1980.80-5,1,46555,walter_t_winter,,2576.366,2582.37,"--number one, he is actually paid for his services, the services that he renders at that time."
1980.80-5,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2594.612,2600.081,"We're really now arguing about whether or not it is true, the assumption, aren't we?"
1980.80-5,1,46555,walter_t_winter,,2600.081,2605.068,"--I don't think so, but perhaps I misunderstand you."
1980.80-5,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2605.068,2605.718,Perhaps I misunderstood you.
1980.80-5,1,46555,walter_t_winter,,2605.718,2609.789,I don't think that we're arguing about whether or not it's true.
1980.80-5,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2634.987,2647.581,"Mr. Winter, do you agree with what your opponent said, in the event the doctor had not merely retired but had resigned his commission, would he not then have forfeited any right to the retirement pay?"
1980.80-5,1,46555,walter_t_winter,,2647.581,2649.997,"Yes, but that cuts both ways--"
1980.80-5,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2649.997,2656.251,"Would you not agree that he has the sole discretion as to whether to do that, and the wife cannot veto that decision?"
1980.80-5,1,46555,walter_t_winter,,2656.251,2661.072,"--I believe that he has that sole discretion or he should have that sole discretion, Mr. Justice."
1980.80-5,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2712.856,2731.401,"But it's not just... if your opponent's conception of the scheme is the correct one, it's not merely giving something up, he also gets something when he resigns, namely, he is no longer exposed to the risk of being called into active duty and running the risk of the danger that's associated with a military life."
1980.80-5,1,46555,walter_t_winter,,2731.401,2740.857,"Well, I'm not asking this Court to state that the wife should have the right to tell him whether or not he should remain in the service."
1980.80-5,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2740.857,2749.947,"No, but this goes to the question whether it's in the nature of a pension or it's in the nature of reduced pay for a limited type of service, namely, availability to recall."
1980.80-5,1,46555,walter_t_winter,,2749.947,2756.016,"I believe that under these circumstances, Mr. Justice, I believe that this is nothing more than a play on words."
1980.80-5,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2758.568,2762.187,But there are a number of officers who do resign for that very reason.
1980.80-5,1,46555,walter_t_winter,,2762.187,2762.454,--Yes.
1980.80-5,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2897.724,2899.907,"Mr. Winter, suppose you lose this case here?"
1980.80-5,1,46555,walter_t_winter,,2906.294,2907.58,"Yes, we do, Your Honor."
1980.80-5,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2907.58,2915.0,"And that could be enforced against... well, his pension, once it is received by him, I suppose?"
1980.80-5,1,46555,walter_t_winter,,2915.0,2916.269,"Yes, it may, Your Honor."
1980.80-5,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2918.035,2920.554,What you want is a direct share of the pension?
1980.80-5,1,46555,walter_t_winter,,2921.271,2922.756,"--Yes, Your Honor, because actually--"
