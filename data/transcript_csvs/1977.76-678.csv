1977.76-678,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,9.886,"Counsel, you may proceed whenever you are ready."
1977.76-678,0,36339,mary_t_matthies,,9.886,11.237,Thank you Your Honors.
1977.76-678,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,111.636,113.889,And which do you say it is?
1977.76-678,0,36339,mary_t_matthies,,113.889,120.202,"Obviously, Your Honor our first contention is that it is a substantive jurisdictional prerequisite to suit."
1977.76-678,1,30412,jefferson_g_greer,,1700.006,1705.711,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1977.76-678,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1893.628,1901.094,What would you say of neither a claim nor intent to sue notice was filed within a 180 days?
1977.76-678,1,30412,jefferson_g_greer,,1901.094,1905.594,"Now, I think that the 60 day notice, Your Honor, is a prerequisite."
1977.76-678,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1905.594,1907.351,"Well, it is not what I asked you."
1977.76-678,1,30412,jefferson_g_greer,,1920.044,1921.59,For an 180 days.
1977.76-678,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1923.727,1926.791,"Well, then it is a jurisdictional provision, is it not?"
1977.76-678,1,30412,jefferson_g_greer,,1926.791,1927.73,I beg your pardon?
1977.76-678,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1927.73,1929.988,"It is a jurisdictional provision then, is it not?"
1977.76-678,1,30412,jefferson_g_greer,,1929.988,1933.999,"Well, I think you would have to consider that if you are going to apply equity, you look at all --"
1977.76-678,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1933.999,1939.987,"Well, there are some circumstances where the 180 days is jurisdictional?"
1977.76-678,1,30412,jefferson_g_greer,,1939.987,1947.497,"Well, there has been a great deal of confusion as to what Courts call jurisdictional and --"
1977.76-678,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1947.497,1953.985,"Well, whether you call it jurisdictional or not, he is not going to get very far if he does not do something within 180 days?"
1977.76-678,1,30412,jefferson_g_greer,,1953.985,1955.675,"Well, I would agree with that."
1977.76-678,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1955.675,1965.323,And you claim that this filing of claim is enough to toll 180 days?
1977.76-678,1,30412,jefferson_g_greer,,1965.323,1968.344,To toll 180 days.
1977.76-678,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1974.59,1983.849,"So then you would have the full two years given to you to bring an action in district court, once you file a complaint with the Labor Department?"
1977.76-678,1,30412,jefferson_g_greer,,1983.849,1991.81,"Well, depending as in this case where the complaint served exactly the same purpose as a notice of intent to sue."
1977.76-678,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1991.81,1993.45,When would it not?
1977.76-678,1,30412,jefferson_g_greer,,1993.45,1994.243,Beg your pardon?
1977.76-678,2,36339,mary_t_matthies,,3079.793,3089.621,There were several questions which were presented to Mr. Greer that I believe warrant some further discussion.
1977.76-678,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3311.164,3312.044,Thank you counsel.
