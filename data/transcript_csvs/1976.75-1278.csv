1976.75-1278,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,46.394,"We will hear arguments next in 75-1278, Mt. Healthy City School District against Doyle."
1976.75-1278,0,38208,philip_s_olinger,,50.274,56.272,"Mr. Chief Justice, and May it please the Court."
1976.75-1278,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,185.125,198.911,"Let me ask you question there if I may Mr. Olinger and I will try to be parochial, but I am used to the Arizona Organization of School, first let me give you that and ask you if it is like Ohio."
1976.75-1278,0,38208,philip_s_olinger,,223.072,246.619,"In Ohio, Your Honor, there are different types of school districts, but the particular district we are discussing here is a, what is known as a city school district and basically it encompasses the district or the same boundary lines as the municipality of Mt. Healthy."
1976.75-1278,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,274.88,279.19,What is the difference between the school district and the Board of Education?
1976.75-1278,0,38208,philip_s_olinger,,279.19,283.225,"Oh! Alright, I am not sure I know there is a difference in Ohio."
1976.75-1278,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,287.416,290.485,And both are regarded as municipal corporations?
1976.75-1278,0,38208,philip_s_olinger,,290.485,297.045,"No, I have never heard a school district referred to as a municipal corporation."
1976.75-1278,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,299.668,301.78,Or a Board of Education?
1976.75-1278,0,38208,philip_s_olinger,,301.78,303.444,"Or a Board of Education, either one."
1976.75-1278,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,303.444,311.225,"The Cincinnati Board of Education would be the defendant in the suit against the school district would it not, probably?"
1976.75-1278,0,38208,philip_s_olinger,,311.225,312.603,"Yes, that is correct Your Honor."
1976.75-1278,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,312.603,325.196,"Well, supposing I have a contract claim against the school district and name the proper parties, out of whose treasury does that judgment pay?"
1976.75-1278,0,38208,philip_s_olinger,,325.196,327.778,That judgment would be paid out of general fund.
1976.75-1278,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,327.778,328.338,Of what?
1976.75-1278,0,38208,philip_s_olinger,,328.338,332.072,Of the school district or the Board of Education whichever prefer.
1976.75-1278,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,337.574,338.348,Is the geographic.
1976.75-1278,0,38208,philip_s_olinger,,338.348,341.002,Is the geographic area.
1976.75-1278,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,364.072,367.635,So they are really just almost synonymous for purposes of --
1976.75-1278,0,38208,philip_s_olinger,,367.635,370.861,"As I understand it, that is correct Your Honor."
1976.75-1278,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,370.861,378.933,Does the constitution of Ohio provide for school boards or school boards of education as I think you call them?
1976.75-1278,0,38208,philip_s_olinger,,378.933,388.543,"The constitution of Ohio provides that there shall be a school system provided for, in Ohio."
1976.75-1278,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,390.653,398.918,"School Board members in Virginia are constitutional officers, is that true in Ohio?"
1976.75-1278,0,38208,philip_s_olinger,,398.918,402.153,"Your Honor, I do not believe they are."
1976.75-1278,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,402.153,405.144,"I do not want to detain you on the point, I was just interested."
1976.75-1278,0,38208,philip_s_olinger,,413.059,423.203,"In Ohio, Your Honor, there is what is known in Ohio is a ten-mill limitation and that ten-mill limitation must be shared."
1976.75-1278,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,478.105,481.682,"Who levies, the county, the city?"
1976.75-1278,0,38208,philip_s_olinger,,481.682,485.787,"No, the school board itself Your Honor."
1976.75-1278,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,498.056,501.308,"That is, the voters are all the people in the school district?"
1976.75-1278,0,38208,philip_s_olinger,,501.308,502.595,"In the school district, that is correct Your Honor."
1976.75-1278,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,502.595,505.806,But could you defer from the county or the city or anything else?
1976.75-1278,0,38208,philip_s_olinger,,505.806,506.472,It could be.
1976.75-1278,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,506.472,507.329,Boundary wise.
1976.75-1278,0,38208,philip_s_olinger,,507.329,512.804,"Yes, boundary wise only the voters who are in the school district may vote on that particular issue."
1976.75-1278,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,512.804,514.227,And how about bond issues?
1976.75-1278,0,38208,philip_s_olinger,,514.227,515.797,Same thing is true.
1976.75-1278,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,515.797,526.555,Is there any authority to issue bonds up to limitation analogous to the ten-mill limitation without the vote of the people?
1976.75-1278,0,38208,philip_s_olinger,,526.555,534.458,"Your Honor, I am not sure, but I think that on bonds you have to submit all bond issues to the general elector."
1976.75-1278,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,534.458,551.354,"I do not want to detain you on this particular subject, but while we are on it, does the record show or do you know as a matter of public record, what percentage of the cost of operating the public schools in Ohio is borne by the state treasury?"
1976.75-1278,0,38208,philip_s_olinger,,565.609,569.937,"Your Honor, there was no testimony present on that issue in the trial."
1976.75-1278,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,573.366,574.802,Are they matters of public record.
1976.75-1278,0,38208,philip_s_olinger,,574.802,575.938,Yes.
1976.75-1278,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,575.938,576.815,"Well, what are they?"
1976.75-1278,0,38208,philip_s_olinger,,576.815,583.446,In the 1971-72 school year the state of Ohio contributed 48%.
1976.75-1278,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,603.293,604.858,That is an equalizing fund.
1976.75-1278,0,38208,philip_s_olinger,,604.858,608.46,Yes under the equal yield formula.
1976.75-1278,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,773.541,783.481,"Mr. Olinger, the first question presented in your petition for Certiorari is whether the District Court had jurisdiction of this action under Section 1331, are you planning to discuss this in your…"
1976.75-1278,0,38208,philip_s_olinger,,783.481,786.136,"Yes I am Your Honor, in fact I am…"
1976.75-1278,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,786.136,790.485,"I do not mean to order your argument for you, I just wanted to know if you did plan that."
1976.75-1278,0,38208,philip_s_olinger,,790.485,792.286,"Oh! Yes I did, Your Honor."
1976.75-1278,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,872.867,877.4,"I suppose Mr. Doyle had no legal advice when he stated the reasons, did he?"
1976.75-1278,0,38208,philip_s_olinger,,877.4,879.031,"You mean the superintendent, Your Honor?"
1976.75-1278,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,879.031,882.784,"Yes, superintendent."
1976.75-1278,0,38208,philip_s_olinger,,882.784,892.445,I did not represent the board at that time and they had another attorney but he died and I do not know whether he was alive or not at that particular time.
1976.75-1278,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,952.734,955.486,And really logically that is your first argument?
1976.75-1278,0,38208,philip_s_olinger,,955.486,956.223,"Yes, I am sorry."
1976.75-1278,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,956.223,958.872,"If you are right about that we never get to that matter, is that correct?"
1976.75-1278,0,38208,philip_s_olinger,,958.872,960.471,"Yeah, that is correct Your Honor."
1976.75-1278,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1888.644,1892.129,"Mr. Chief Justice, May it please the Court."
1976.75-1278,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1953.156,1961.809,"1331 would also provide a jurisdiction in a 1983 action if more than $10,000 were involved exclusive of interests and costs, is it not correct?"
1976.75-1278,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1961.809,1966.443,"Well, I suppose it would but of course, the plaintiff did not need 1331."
1976.75-1278,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1966.443,1971.055,But it would have been perfectly adequate jurisdictional statute upon which to rely.
1976.75-1278,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1971.055,1985.699,"Yes, it would if in fact he could sue the school district under 1983 that is to say it would only provided a jurisdictional basis for a 1983 action if he had a cause of action on the 1983 and that turns on whether the school board is a person."
1976.75-1278,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1996.578,1999.455,Where do you get this cause of action directly in the Fourteenth Amendment?
1976.75-1278,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1999.455,2014.333,"Well, if I may just refer that for one moment, it is going to be the central focus of my discussion here, but I do want to just say one thing first because if I do not say it first, I am going to lose it and that is that in so far as this is a suit for reinstatement, let us forget the back pay for a moment."
1976.75-1278,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2045.96,2048.701,"You say that is like Ex parte Young basis, would you?"
1976.75-1278,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2048.701,2052.342,"Well, except they were not concerned about the Eleventh Amendment theory, but it is the same kind of thing."
1976.75-1278,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2081.257,2087.61,"But Mr. Gottesman, here the trial court dismissed the claim against the individual defendants and you did not appeal from that?"
1976.75-1278,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2087.61,2093.842,"Well, we have a very peculiar problem, Justice Stevens, and in a sense we are going to have to ask for the Court’s indulgence on it."
1976.75-1278,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2133.003,2137.314,Is that a safe assumption ever as a jurisdiction remain in a case?
1976.75-1278,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2137.314,2143.657,"Well, of course it does, Your Honor, and that is why I say we have to beg the Court’s indulgence if we lose on 1331."
1976.75-1278,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2143.657,2147.249,"Mr. Gottesman, did you cite 1331 on your complaint?"
1976.75-1278,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2147.249,2151.608,"Yes, it was actually cited as 1931 but it was a typographical error and the District Court…"
1976.75-1278,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2151.608,2155.918,That is what I want to know because that is the only reference I find as 1931.
1976.75-1278,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2155.918,2160.74,"Yes, it was understood by the District Court as 1331."
1976.75-1278,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2195.159,2203.216,"Well, is that a pleading point basically Mr. Gottesman that you do not have to plead jurisdiction, if it is apparent from the facts?"
1976.75-1278,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2203.216,2204.905,It is not as broad as that.
1976.75-1278,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2239.167,2247.987,That is not the quite the same thing I was saying that parties dismissed and is against whom the dismissal has become final can be reinstated after that point.
1976.75-1278,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2247.987,2249.185,"Well, it is not quite the same."
1976.75-1278,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2260.986,2263.857,There you do not have the res judicata problem.
1976.75-1278,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2263.857,2264.7,"Well, that is right."
1976.75-1278,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2270.458,2275.081,"But Mr. Gottesman, if we allow the remand, you really would not have to amend your complaint."
1976.75-1278,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2276.029,2276.866,The complaint is perfect.
1976.75-1278,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2278.463,2281.897,What we would have to be doing is remanding to let you take an appeal you did not take.
1976.75-1278,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2281.897,2287.826,In essence and that is why I say we beg the Court’s indulgence on it because obviously we do not have a right to that.
1976.75-1278,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2290.367,2293.815,Why petitioner (Inaudible).
1976.75-1278,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2293.815,2305.126,I suppose we are in the position that we cannot proceed to seek reinstatement under 1983 against the school officials in their official capacities for want of an appeal having been taken.
1976.75-1278,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2348.382,2351.876,"What do you mean this, Mr. Gottesman?"
1976.75-1278,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2358.584,2360.621,That is what this Court held in City of Kenosha.
1976.75-1278,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2372.15,2373.509,Even for injunctive relief?
1976.75-1278,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2373.509,2376.768,That is what City of Kenosha squarely held.
1976.75-1278,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2376.768,2378.967,If you would equate the school board with a municipality.
1976.75-1278,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2378.967,2379.772,If you do that.
1976.75-1278,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2379.772,2383.669,That is Kenosha holds that you cannot get injunctive relief against them under 1983.
1976.75-1278,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2383.669,2384.189,"That is correct, any relief."
1976.75-1278,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2384.189,2385.085,It cannot get any relief.
1976.75-1278,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2385.085,2388.21,Any relief.
1976.75-1278,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2388.21,2390.013,It is immune from liability under 1983.
1976.75-1278,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2390.013,2392.011,"Well, it is not, Your Honor, it is not an immunity"
1976.75-1278,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2393.852,2398.13,That does basically confer a cause of action against the municipality.
1976.75-1278,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2398.13,2405.315,That is correct and it is important that it is not an immunity because I will get to it in a moment.
1976.75-1278,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2405.315,2406.841,Does not fit out of the word 'person'.
1976.75-1278,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2406.841,2407.662,Right.
1976.75-1278,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2438.061,2452.047,"Well Mr. Gottesman in the page 14 (a) of the petition for Certiorari, in paragraph 9 the District Court said that this court does not state any conclusion on the possible Monroe Kenosha problem in this case."
1976.75-1278,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2465.611,2469.465,Oh! Clearly I think when it said it states no conclusion on the Monroe Kenosha problem what he means.
1976.75-1278,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2469.465,2471.098,The only decision has been 1331.
1976.75-1278,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2471.098,2488.837,"That is right, I think the reference to 1983 was it was clearly a proper 1983 case against the school officials and he ruled on the merits that as individuals they would not have to pay the judgment because they had not engaged in that bad faith and etcetera that would be strict and would dictate, entitling liability."
1976.75-1278,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2488.837,2500.823,"Isn’t the District Court mixing apples and oranges in that paragraph 9, to which my brother White has just referred because a 1331 is a jurisdictional statute and 1983 is a substantive."
1976.75-1278,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2500.823,2523.473,"But they both are sort of short hands for a combination of a cause of action and the jurisdiction predicate, when one refers to 1983 commonly, the lower courts, when they refer to 1983 they refer to as jurisdictional, when of course it is a cause of action which provides jurisdiction under 1343 or for which the jurisdiction is provided."
1976.75-1278,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2523.473,2530.542,"I would also assumes that 1983 is separate from, has no connect with 1331 and I think you got to reach that right now."
1976.75-1278,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2530.542,2531.88,"Yes, I am going to reach that right now."
1976.75-1278,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2531.88,2532.896,It contrasted too.
1976.75-1278,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2532.896,2533.401,That is right.
1976.75-1278,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2544.854,2546.016,Directly under the Fourth Amendment and not under the Fourteenth.
1976.75-1278,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2546.016,2547.654,"Directly under the Fourth Amendment, that is correct."
1976.75-1278,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2547.654,2548.605,Against Federal.
1976.75-1278,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2548.605,2551.117,Directly under the Fourth Amendment against Federal officials.
1976.75-1278,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2551.117,2555.485,And there is no federal analog of 1983.
1976.75-1278,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2555.485,2578.331,"That is correct, but the point was that the Fourth Amendment itself coupled with the jurisdictional power granted by 1331 which enabled the Federal Courts to decide all questions arising under the constitution was sufficient to allow a cause of action for damages, now for the moment not against the municipality, we will get to that in a moment."
1976.75-1278,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2585.177,2587.919,"It was implied by the Court, was it not in Bivens?"
1976.75-1278,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2587.919,2589.271,"Well, that is right."
1976.75-1278,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2618.553,2626.03,"It was not quite even though Congress had enacted no statute, it was when congress has enacted no statute."
1976.75-1278,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2626.03,2629.366,Well it does not say that Your Honor.
1976.75-1278,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2640.342,2647.717,"It did not imply that Congress, if it did enact a statute could not have put limitations on it."
1976.75-1278,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2647.717,2648.325,That is true.
1976.75-1278,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2648.325,2649.375,That is what I afforded by.
1976.75-1278,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2649.375,2652.752,But I think we have to recall the chronology here.
1976.75-1278,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2770.093,2778.972,Well how do you explain Bell versus Hoods reservation of the point ultimately decided in Bivens if it is that clear?
1976.75-1278,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2778.972,2809.237,"Well, what Bell versus Hood said was, and I think really this is a all this Court needs to decide in this case given and I will get to that in a moment, Bell versus Hood said if a plaintiff comes into Federal Court and says, “I claim a cause of action directly under an amendment of the constitution” and he asserts the $10000 as in controversy, the Federal Courts have jurisdiction to decide that claim on the merits."
1976.75-1278,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2861.275,2863.226,"Mr. Gottesman, let me just interrupt you again."
1976.75-1278,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2870.363,2875.546,"Well, let me find the complaint."
1976.75-1278,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2875.546,2880.58,"Oh! I see, in paragraph 10 you have, I apologize, it is there."
1976.75-1278,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2880.58,2886.205,"It says in contravention of the Constitution and of Section 1983, so it does allege both."
1976.75-1278,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2886.205,2914.951,"Your position then would be and perhaps it is right, is that a plaintiff, even though in fact you cannot sue a municipal corporation under 1331 because 1983 places limitations on it and you have to -- that is the only way you can get into Court because of that even though 1331 is on the books."
1976.75-1278,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2925.22,2929.596,"Well, not a claim under 1983, and the claim directly under the Fourteenth Amendment."
1976.75-1278,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2969.611,2976.79,"However, if you are wrong, and it is in fact a jurisdictional question rather than a merits question, then I take it to the other view it prevails."
1976.75-1278,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2976.79,2980.616,"Yeah, well, clearly if it is a jurisdictional question, it is before the Court."
1976.75-1278,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3030.449,3033.635,Let me just ask one other question on the person issue.
1976.75-1278,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,3040.772,3041.763,That is interesting.
1976.75-1278,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3081.752,3088.939,"I am just wondering who has the burden of proof because it does not seem to me that anybody really addressed themselves to the problem in the District Court, even in the pleadings."
1976.75-1278,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,3088.939,3105.922,"Well, one of the terrible problems about this case Your Honor is that almost every issue that is before this Court and they are all terribly important issues, is here without having been raised by the defendants in the District Court with no record and a record would have been made both on jurisdiction and the Eleventh Amendment, if they have been put an issue, I can assure the Court…"
1976.75-1278,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3105.922,3113.111,"But of course if there is jurisdictional issue then it was the plaintiff’s job to push them, brief them and make a record of."
1976.75-1278,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,3113.111,3133.58,"Well, that is always true Your Honor, but I think the true meaning of Bell v. Hood is that a plaintiff who comes into Federal Court and says, “I have a cause of action and this is my cause of action” and who cites the appropriate jurisdictional provisions which that cause of action would trigger."
1976.75-1278,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3158.454,3161.839,What if the defendant never disputes the existence of jurisdiction?
1976.75-1278,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,3161.839,3162.915,"Now, the Court is always free to raise the…"
1976.75-1278,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3162.915,3170.929,The Court is always free and so it becomes very important whether or not this is a jurisdictional question or a merits question.
1976.75-1278,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,3170.929,3175.799,"Now, on both questions, this Court does not have briefing from the parties."
1976.75-1278,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3225.299,3228.402,When was Eleventh Amendment issue raised?
1976.75-1278,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,3228.402,3233.17,The Eleventh Amendment issue was raised in the opening appellate brief by the defendant.
1976.75-1278,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3233.17,3240.304,"In the Court of Appeals, and it has never really been addressed by any courts below?"
1976.75-1278,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,3240.304,3244.15,"Well, the District Court raised it on it is own motion."
1976.75-1278,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3246.132,3248.334,But it just that it was not raised.
1976.75-1278,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,3248.334,3250.38,"Well no, it said it is been waived."
1976.75-1278,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3250.38,3254.244,"Back to that, it is the same Paragraph 9."
1976.75-1278,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3254.244,3259.624,But then it was never really discussed by any court?
1976.75-1278,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,3259.624,3284.597,"No, it was briefed by both sides in the Court of Appeals and the Court of Appeals affirmed without mentioning it and so it is here again in this peculiar posture that a terribly important issue and all of these issues, incidentally all of the Courts of Appeals are ruling in our favor, that is obviously not controlling in this Court but we would certainly like to bring to this Court’s attention the analytical guidance that those lower courts have provided before this Court rules on it, but the Eleventh Amendment issue was terribly important."
1976.75-1278,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3299.939,3303.876,Of course you know from the Ford Motor Company that can be raised on appeal.
1976.75-1278,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,3303.876,3306.181,"Well, we at least know it from Edelman Your Honor, I am not sure…"
1976.75-1278,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3306.181,3307.783,"Well, the Edelman relied on Ford Motor Company’s…"
1976.75-1278,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,3307.783,3308.569,Yes it did.
1976.75-1278,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3309.791,3313.28,"You are under a fair warning on that in a District Court, I think?"
1976.75-1278,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,3313.28,3316.488,"Again we are under fair warning, but it is a defense."
1976.75-1278,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3396.865,3406.082,"I, for one, would be interested and up to you if you like to spend your brief remaining moments in discussing the merits."
1976.75-1278,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,3406.082,3407.61,"Okay, thank you Your Honor."
1976.75-1278,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3462.811,3466.57,How about the misconduct in the lunch room cafeteria?
1976.75-1278,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,3466.57,3469.474,"Those things, the letter they gave him saying what was wrong."
1976.75-1278,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3469.474,3471.656,"Now, you say too, that one was that telephone call…"

1976.75-1278,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3474.138,3475.971,The obscene gesture to the students.
1976.75-1278,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,3475.971,3479.386,"It characterizes itself, I will accept that."
1976.75-1278,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3483.086,3489.821,So you conceive that one was a proper foundation and submit that the other was not.
1976.75-1278,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,3489.821,3490.948,That is right.
1976.75-1278,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3500.091,3505.929,"Is not that second ground something broader than just a single episode, is it not?"
1976.75-1278,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,3508.372,3509.35,Well there was a dispute between…
1976.75-1278,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3509.35,3512.321,And there I have perhaps a dozen elements under that…
1976.75-1278,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,3512.321,3520.581,"Well, at most there are only five that were testified by the witnesses, including the written phone calls so there are two plus three others."
1976.75-1278,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3536.074,3539.798,"In which at least they which one is out, in your submission."
1976.75-1278,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,3539.798,3549.965,"Now, if we could only know what the school board would have done but for the phone call, we know how to, it seems to me how to deal with this case."
1976.75-1278,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3578.03,3581.943,But that assumes about the improper reliance.
1976.75-1278,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,3581.943,3586.956,"Yes, it assumes that there was reliance on this which the District Court found and which the…"
1976.75-1278,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3586.956,3589.904,"Yes, but you have to assume it was improper."
1976.75-1278,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,3589.904,3592.134,We have to assume that this was…
1976.75-1278,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3592.134,3593.275,That the first question…
1976.75-1278,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,3593.275,3595.048,"Yes, I have assumed it."
1976.75-1278,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3605.394,3610.229,"Well, it has to be that you may not even rely on the phone call that is your lack of tact."
1976.75-1278,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,3610.229,3611.864,In the facts of this case…
1976.75-1278,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3611.864,3613.795,Because that is projected First Amendment activity.
1976.75-1278,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,3613.795,3621.836,"Right and it is not, it was not a tactless phone call, they just put tact as a label on the fact that he made the phone call."
1976.75-1278,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3702.558,3714.037,"And before you sit down, just let me ask you this that would it not be true that however we decided to this case."
1976.75-1278,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,3786.771,3797.948,"I think not Your Honor, anymore than under Section 83 of the National Labor Relations Act which forbids discharges based on union activity or extension from union activity."
1976.75-1278,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3859.357,3860.912,Without mentioning the First Amendment reason.
1976.75-1278,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,3860.912,3878.791,"Well, either with or without, if the Court says that as long as there is collection of reasons, as long if it is a mixed decision we are going to sustain it, then they can be perfectly candid and say well we do not like the fact that you made this First Amendment speech but we also notice that two years ago you made an obscene gesture in cafeteria, so ha, ha there is nothing you can do about it."
1976.75-1278,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3878.791,3884.689,"This is something like have some resemblance at least to the harmless error rule, is it not?"
1976.75-1278,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,3884.689,3887.763,"It does except – well, I guess that is right."
1976.75-1278,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3904.117,3905.819,Well sometimes it traps it is a right word.
1976.75-1278,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,3905.819,3908.348,"Well, I did not mean that."
1976.75-1278,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3920.185,3923.574,The other alternative is to give no reasons at all and they do not…
1976.75-1278,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,3923.574,3933.115,"Well, and they are under no obligation to, but that does not mean that it would not be a First Amendment violation if we could find out independently that that was the reason that they did not."
1976.75-1278,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3933.115,3933.795,Very well.
1976.75-1278,2,38208,philip_s_olinger,,3935.688,3936.59,"No, I do not, Your Honor."
1976.75-1278,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3936.59,3937.717,"Very well, thank you, gentlemen."
