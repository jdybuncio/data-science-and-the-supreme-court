2000.00-767,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.586,"We will hear argument next in number 00767, the Immigration and Naturalization Service versus Enrico St. Cyr."
2000.00-767,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,46.811,50.117,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2000.00-767,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,141.222,146.712,"--forum, the law doesn't apply to me because it doesn't take effect until the year 2004."
2000.00-767,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,146.712,150.017,If it is an application for discretionary....
2000.00-767,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,150.017,151.065,"No, no, no."
2000.00-767,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,160.42,193.774,"If the claim is that I am not subject to deportation or removal because the statute doesn't apply, that is subject to judicial review under this statute and we think that the suspension of habeas corpus clause probably does require that a court be available to entertain a claim that the person who is subject to removal is not an alien and is not subject to removal because in those cases, we will assume, this certainly for purposes of this case, the executive would be acting beyond any authority granted to the Attorney General."
2000.00-767,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,193.774,196.746,Would you need habeas corpus to review those things?
2000.00-767,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,200.173,201.659,"Oh yes, no, yes, no, I'm sorry."
2000.00-767,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,210.658,212.023,Things are covered anyway?
2000.00-767,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,212.023,212.516,--Right.
2000.00-767,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,243.807,245.748,"Well, you go ahead."
2000.00-767,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,366.614,367.978,"Do you mean, in the current law or the prior law?"
2000.00-767,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,367.978,368.554,--The current law.
2000.00-767,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,368.554,369.176,The current law.
2000.00-767,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,380.321,381.269,"Okay, what the prior law?"
2000.00-767,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,381.269,390.845,"In the prior law, it was frankly unclear to what extent habeas overlapped with court of appeals review, and this was I think part of the problem."
2000.00-767,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,405.956,409.437,Might that have been the reason for the specific provision under the new law?
2000.00-767,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,409.437,420.157,"No, I think the reason under the new law was one of expedition, to not have two stops in the court but only one petition for review in the courts of appeals."
2000.00-767,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,420.157,434.479,"Mr. Kneedler, the competing habeas provision in this period of uncertainty, whether you could go to both places, that was in the Immigration and Nationality Act itself."
2000.00-767,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,436.337,437.451,It wasn't?
2000.00-767,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,437.989,439.946,It wasn't the general habeas statute.
2000.00-767,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,439.946,461.6,"Well, as we explain in our brief, the provision in the INA was necessary to preserve that habeas corpus because the prior act was worded, the judicial review is in the courts of appeals under the Hobbs Act except, and as this Court said in Stone there were a series of exceptions that follow that, one of which was the specific exception for district court habeas."
2000.00-767,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,478.318,479.887,That wasn't my question.
2000.00-767,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,484.263,485.999,--1105(a)(10).
2000.00-767,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,485.999,486.742,"Yes, yes."
2000.00-767,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,495.287,496.895,Some courts said it was 2241.
2000.00-767,1,34513,lucas_guttentag,,1772.332,1776.706,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2000.00-767,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3467.091,3491.201,"Yes, with respect to the cases that I would rely on for nonretroactivity, Justice Stevens, I would mention Kansas v. Hendricks where the Court said there was no ex post facto violation because the act wasn't retroactive even though it operated. One of the triggers was a prior conviction, but it looked to current and future of status. Also, the Cox case mentioned in Landgraf itself gives a description of some such cases."
2000.00-767,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3559.411,3560.508,"Thank you, Mr. Kneedler."
