1974.73-5772,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,45.001,"We'll hear arguments next in Number 73-5772, Faretta against California."
1974.73-5772,0,30239,jerome_b_falk_jr,,47.516,50.731,Thank you Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1974.73-5772,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,187.909,189.2,Nothing unusual about that.
1974.73-5772,0,30239,jerome_b_falk_jr,,189.2,191.231,"No, Your Honor there is not."
1974.73-5772,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,205.022,216.757,Do you -- would you think there was anything unusual about people of modest means and not always getting the lawyer they would like to have?
1974.73-5772,0,30239,jerome_b_falk_jr,,216.757,222.484,"No, Your Honor and I perceive no constitutional right to pick ones own counsel."
1974.73-5772,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,264.788,265.925,What was the third one?
1974.73-5772,0,30239,jerome_b_falk_jr,,265.925,268.241,"Whether or not to testify, Mr. Justice Blackmun."
1974.73-5772,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,272.685,279.073,"Those standards, they're consistent of the standards established by the American Bar and Criminal Justice Project, do they not?"
1974.73-5772,0,30239,jerome_b_falk_jr,,279.073,284.92,They are identical with the ABA standards Mr. Chief Justice and I again don't quarrel with that.
1974.73-5772,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,378.025,380.164,"That's true even of retained counsel, isn't it?"
1974.73-5772,0,30239,jerome_b_falk_jr,,380.164,382.996,That is true even of retained counsel.
1974.73-5772,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,430.445,441.151,"Does the, under the California judges, ever in that situation apply it to yet another lawyer to act as a friend of the court and assist?"
1974.73-5772,0,30239,jerome_b_falk_jr,,441.151,445.199,I have never heard of them doing that where there is a lawyer in the case.
1974.73-5772,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,457.031,468.447,"Of course in mid trial it would be kind of hard to either replace the man who was assigned and it would be kind of difficult to get a new man in on the third day of the trial who could do much good, wouldn't it?"
1974.73-5772,0,30239,jerome_b_falk_jr,,468.447,472.604,The Smith case actually was a case that had not yet commenced trial.
1974.73-5772,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,526.221,528.364,How many days have this trial gone on?
1974.73-5772,0,30239,jerome_b_falk_jr,,528.364,530.234,The case I've described?
1974.73-5772,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,530.234,530.688,This case.
1974.73-5772,0,30239,jerome_b_falk_jr,,530.688,534.003,"This case, this case had not begun when this --"
1974.73-5772,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,534.003,535.11,No part of the --
1974.73-5772,0,30239,jerome_b_falk_jr,,535.11,535.666,No it was at --
1974.73-5772,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,535.666,536.14,-- case at that time?
1974.73-5772,0,30239,jerome_b_falk_jr,,536.14,539.276,-- at a totally pretrial stage.
1974.73-5772,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,627.314,632.086,You don't read the Sixth Amendment language as mandatory.
1974.73-5772,0,30239,jerome_b_falk_jr,,632.086,632.312,"I beg your pardon, Mr. Chief Justice?"
1974.73-5772,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,632.312,650.321,"You don't read the “shall” in the first line of the Sixth Amendment as being by clear implication part of the last phrase, “and shall have the right to assistance of counsel.”"
1974.73-5772,0,30239,jerome_b_falk_jr,,650.321,664.41,"No, I read it together with the confrontation and cross-examination clauses of the same amendment, which in our view create a right of the defendant to present his own defense as he sees fit."
1974.73-5772,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,665.968,671.133,Then you read “shall have” out of the Sixth Amendment.
1974.73-5772,0,30239,jerome_b_falk_jr,,671.133,681.709,"Well, only in the sense that the defendant may elect not to have that which the -- that part of the Sixth Amendment allows him to have if he wishes."
1974.73-5772,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,681.709,686.939,That is easier to follow if the Sixth Amendment read “may have the assistance of counsel” would it not?
1974.73-5772,0,30239,jerome_b_falk_jr,,686.939,693.975,"Well, if it said that Mr. Chief Justice, then I take it that trial courts would have some discretion."
1974.73-5772,0,30239,jerome_b_falk_jr,,766.267,771.771,"It's a right that can be lost by misconduct, and we, I should say so I'm clear on that point."
1974.73-5772,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,877.505,886.393,So would you think to the courts should give controlling or even very much weight to what the prosecutor thinks about that subject?
1974.73-5772,0,30239,jerome_b_falk_jr,,886.393,892.417,"Well, I think not and -- but in a different kind of case which I'm trying to distinguish, they should."
1974.73-5772,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,892.938,899.164,"Prosecutor might be overjoyed as having a defendant waive counsel, might he not?"
1974.73-5772,0,30239,jerome_b_falk_jr,,899.164,902.714,I have heard of prosecutors speak both sides on that.
1974.73-5772,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,904.087,904.98,I said might.
1974.73-5772,0,30239,jerome_b_falk_jr,,907.377,909.928,The proper answer is the one I think implied in your question.
1974.73-5772,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,925.141,937.625,"Mr. Falk, don't you think the state or the government really has an interest to see that justice is done and that is done in a way so convincing that it wins popular approval?"
1974.73-5772,0,30239,jerome_b_falk_jr,,937.625,940.345,I do think so Mr. Justice Blackmun.
1974.73-5772,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,949.588,950.802,He really doesn't want any lawyer.
1974.73-5772,0,30239,jerome_b_falk_jr,,955.209,957.838,"I -- well, in this case he would have."
1974.73-5772,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,964.641,967.83,"Well, they always want the notorious or celebrated ones."
1974.73-5772,0,30239,jerome_b_falk_jr,,967.83,969.33,This one happened not to be the case.
1974.73-5772,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,979.681,991.179,Doesn't the state also have an interest in securing criminal judgments against later collateral attack based on a contention as to whether the waiver of counsel was voluntary or not?
1974.73-5772,0,30239,jerome_b_falk_jr,,991.179,993.751,"Yes Mr. Justice Rehnquist, it does."
1974.73-5772,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1017.869,1037.335,"Well, would you say a defendant who is in the position of your client but at that stage who says “I elect to represent myself”, would you say that's -- a defendant in that position could never later raise the question of the voluntariness of his waiver of the right to counsel?"
1974.73-5772,0,30239,jerome_b_falk_jr,,1037.335,1037.681,Oh!
1974.73-5772,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1039.026,1046.54,Well so the state is solving that problem potential vulnerability to collateral attack by appointing counsel for him.
1974.73-5772,0,30239,jerome_b_falk_jr,,1046.54,1058.681,"Well, that is in my view a pretty weak basis in which to deny somebody if that were the only interest at stake, his opportunity to present his own defense."
1974.73-5772,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1100.879,1112.097,"What if the judge asked him all the questions that you suggest he asked him and a lot more too, and becomes convinced that he really is quite incompetent to conduct his own defense."
1974.73-5772,0,30239,jerome_b_falk_jr,,1119.734,1120.117,"Well, I --"
1974.73-5772,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1120.117,1124.643,And I suppose you would suggest that the waiver must be intelligent as well as voluntary?
1974.73-5772,0,30239,jerome_b_falk_jr,,1124.643,1125.657,Well --
1974.73-5772,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1125.657,1127.573,Is that right or not?
1974.73-5772,0,30239,jerome_b_falk_jr,,1127.573,1133.067,Only in the sense that he has to understand that the trial judge thinks he's making a terrible mistake.
1974.73-5772,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1135.605,1138.326,"So you say your answer is “No, it doesn't have to be intelligent."
1974.73-5772,0,30239,jerome_b_falk_jr,,1142.097,1146.404,"I'm having difficulty with the words, but I think that is the proper conclusion."
1974.73-5772,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1171.386,1174.325,"Let's take an extreme example, obviously extreme."
1974.73-5772,0,30239,jerome_b_falk_jr,,1204.758,1208.52,I think that the question is one that has there otherwise of dealing with.
1974.73-5772,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1227.02,1230.026,"Well, going to the waivers of some of these constitutional provisions."
1974.73-5772,0,30239,jerome_b_falk_jr,,1254.135,1268.486,"I think not, because of the difference between the prosecutor's interest in having a jury trial, and the prosecutor's lack of interest in seeing that the defendant has a particular type of defense."
1974.73-5772,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1268.486,1283.734,Does it not go to what Mr. Justice Blackmun was intimating that the state has such a strong interest in a proper trial that it sets up these additional safeguards over and above the constitution?
1974.73-5772,0,30239,jerome_b_falk_jr,,1283.734,1288.373,A whole series of questions I think all touch on the very problem of the inadequate defendant.
1974.73-5772,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1323.078,1325.762,Can you help me on this?
1974.73-5772,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1342.896,1344.758,You ask him a series of questions.
1974.73-5772,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1367.261,1371.622,And he said “Can you handle your own defense?”
1974.73-5772,0,30239,jerome_b_falk_jr,,1371.622,1374.071,That I think is not a question.
1974.73-5772,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1378.507,1379.376,"Well, that's what he did."
1974.73-5772,0,30239,jerome_b_falk_jr,,1385.119,1387.958,"Mr. Justice Marshall I agree with you, and I think we have --"
1974.73-5772,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1387.958,1395.393,Can you quarrel at that stage the judge saying “Go ahead and conduct your defense but I'm going to leave that lawyer there in case you need him.”
1974.73-5772,0,30239,jerome_b_falk_jr,,1395.393,1396.335,Absolutely not.
1974.73-5772,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1402.119,1403.042,And wouldn't object to that.
1974.73-5772,0,30239,jerome_b_falk_jr,,1403.042,1403.998,Would not object to that.
1974.73-5772,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1421.315,1424.322,You don't have to tell me what the key to trying the case here.
1974.73-5772,0,30239,jerome_b_falk_jr,,1424.322,1424.973,"No, I'm sorry."
1974.73-5772,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1425.285,1426.937,I've tried a few.
1974.73-5772,0,30239,jerome_b_falk_jr,,1426.937,1429.456,Well I understand that Mr. Justice.
1974.73-5772,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1432.745,1434.968,I tried a few in California.
1974.73-5772,0,30239,jerome_b_falk_jr,,1434.968,1437.746,I understand.
1974.73-5772,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1469.997,1475.302,"But you wouldn't require the appointment of standby counsel, is it?"
1974.73-5772,0,30239,jerome_b_falk_jr,,1475.302,1476.459,I think that the --
1974.73-5772,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1476.459,1477.839,"If you waive it, you waive it."
1974.73-5772,0,30239,jerome_b_falk_jr,,1477.839,1484.989,"No, I do not think that the right to counsel and the right to present one's own defense are necessarily mutually exclusive."
1974.73-5772,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1485.225,1485.981,You say it is.
1974.73-5772,0,30239,jerome_b_falk_jr,,1503.24,1504.097,"No, this defendant --"
1974.73-5772,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1504.097,1505.939,Is that the limit of his Constitution?
1974.73-5772,0,30239,jerome_b_falk_jr,,1505.939,1509.107,My client's position is simply he wanted to it alone.
1974.73-5772,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1527.113,1528.722,If I ask you Mr. Falk?
1974.73-5772,0,30239,jerome_b_falk_jr,,1548.184,1549.292,"Yes, it may."
1974.73-5772,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1549.292,1549.741,It may?
1974.73-5772,0,30239,jerome_b_falk_jr,,1549.741,1550.427,It may.
1974.73-5772,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1551.034,1554.179,So that's the limitation then on the Sixth Amendment right.
1974.73-5772,0,30239,jerome_b_falk_jr,,1554.179,1561.526,I don't think it interferes with the Sixth Amendment right that someone sitting his side and can -- and doesn't interfere with him and I see --
1974.73-5772,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1561.526,1564.475,But the standby counsel is being foisted on him.
1974.73-5772,0,30239,jerome_b_falk_jr,,1564.475,1569.182,"Well, but not in the way that a lawyer is being foisted upon defendant such as Faretta."
1974.73-5772,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1570.623,1574.64,Because standby counsel doesn't have the authority to run the show.
1974.73-5772,0,30239,jerome_b_falk_jr,,1574.64,1576.045,Exactly Mr. Justice Brennan.
1974.73-5772,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1576.045,1585.04,"As I understood in your brief, is there constitutionally only to the extent that the man, the defendant himself wants to consult him and use him?"
1974.73-5772,0,30239,jerome_b_falk_jr,,1585.04,1586.884,He's there but he provides no assistance --
1974.73-5772,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1586.884,1587.093,Right.
1974.73-5772,0,30239,jerome_b_falk_jr,,1593.53,1597.795,"We have not gone that far, and I think that's an open question."
1974.73-5772,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1618.687,1626.252,"I gather Mr. Falk, your answer to Mr. Justice Stewart means counsel -- court says “Alright, go ahead defend yourself.”"
1974.73-5772,0,30239,jerome_b_falk_jr,,1634.185,1646.094,"I have to say candidly that I think an argument can be made that a defendant who chooses to exercise his Sixth Amendment right to present a defense, is also entitled to the assistance of counsel of a standby nature."
1974.73-5772,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1649.188,1651.341,You're now departing from your brief very explicitly.
1974.73-5772,0,30239,jerome_b_falk_jr,,1651.341,1653.253,"I'm answering a question candidly, but I didn't -- couldn't raise --"
1974.73-5772,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1653.253,1656.094,Well -- running your brief.
1974.73-5772,0,30239,jerome_b_falk_jr,,1656.094,1657.105,"Well, I didn't reach it in the brief because the --"
1974.73-5772,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1657.105,1658.347,"Well, you covered it."
1974.73-5772,0,30239,jerome_b_falk_jr,,1661.801,1665.071,I'm not claiming it on behalf of this petitioner because I don't have to.
1974.73-5772,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1677.615,1683.107,I take it you'd be willing to concede that we must consider that aspect whether you press it on us or not?
1974.73-5772,0,30239,jerome_b_falk_jr,,1683.107,1684.37,"I think so Mr. Chief Justice, and that's why I've answered the questions I had."
1974.73-5772,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1684.37,1701.777,"And I take it you're aware that in most cases when a judge appoints standby counsel, that standby counsel is instructed to do everything that he would do if he were retained the counsel, whether the defendant likes it or whether the defendant does not like it."
1974.73-5772,0,30239,jerome_b_falk_jr,,1701.777,1702.374,"Well, there are --"
1974.73-5772,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1702.374,1704.829,That's what the standards of the American Bar reflect.
1974.73-5772,0,30239,jerome_b_falk_jr,,1704.829,1715.377,"They indicate though Mr. Chief Justice, that the standby counsel is not to ask questions and to introduce evidence and not -- and has no power to preclude the defendant from doing so."
1974.73-5772,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1721.235,1726.62,Are there many lawyers who are willing to act as standby counsel in that capacity?
1974.73-5772,0,30239,jerome_b_falk_jr,,1726.62,1736.457,I would think that there are as many lawyers who are willing to do that as who are willing to endure the awful relationship of a -- having with a client who doesn't want them.
1974.73-5772,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1736.457,1747.088,"Well but you still got the relationship at least when you're representing the guy, your judgment, your professional judgment is given some weight."
1974.73-5772,0,30239,jerome_b_falk_jr,,1750.274,1752.694,"Well, I -- this is a personal answer."
1974.73-5772,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1756.599,1757.503,No problem.
1974.73-5772,0,30239,jerome_b_falk_jr,,1757.503,1763.081,I would prefer to serve as a standby counsel and those lawyers who have had an opportunity to question on it share the same view.
1974.73-5772,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1763.081,1768.38,"Mr. Falk, can I get this thing straightened out about this standby counsel?"
1974.73-5772,0,30239,jerome_b_falk_jr,,1777.853,1778.708,That's correct.
1974.73-5772,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1778.708,1779.756,That's what we were talking about.
1974.73-5772,0,30239,jerome_b_falk_jr,,1779.756,1780.671,That's what I was talking about.
1974.73-5772,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1780.671,1782.997,And that's the standby counsel you're talking about?
1974.73-5772,0,30239,jerome_b_falk_jr,,1782.997,1783.811,"That's right, that's in the --"
1974.73-5772,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1783.811,1785.82,But not the one that actually takes over?
1974.73-5772,0,30239,jerome_b_falk_jr,,1785.82,1787.111,That's correct.
1974.73-5772,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1787.111,1793.416,"Mr. Falk, we've showered you with questions here, but I want to be sure."
1974.73-5772,0,30239,jerome_b_falk_jr,,1806.617,1807.974,Yes that is clear at my position.
1974.73-5772,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1807.974,1808.783,You concede this?
1974.73-5772,0,30239,jerome_b_falk_jr,,1808.783,1811.277,I concede it.
1974.73-5772,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1824.403,1833.286,"Do you think the courts, the trial court, the presiding judge or an appellate court is going to consider itself bound by that kind of proposition?"
1974.73-5772,0,30239,jerome_b_falk_jr,,1833.286,1841.088,I think it will because it is the logical consequence of everything that has been said on the right of self-representation.
1974.73-5772,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1842.22,1857.607,"Well, if we concede your premise is the logical consequence, but you don't really think that an appellate court would refuse to examine a claim to a faulty waiver by a defendant."
1974.73-5772,0,30239,jerome_b_falk_jr,,1857.607,1858.715,"No, not a faulty waiver."
1974.73-5772,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1871.6,1888.227,"In this case, just before you sit down Mr. Falk, the trial court purported the find that your client, your present client, the defendant did not make an intelligent and knowing waiver from his constitutional right to be represented by an attorney."
1974.73-5772,0,30239,jerome_b_falk_jr,,1891.547,1891.621,That is --
1974.73-5772,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1891.621,1892.683,The court has decided.
1974.73-5772,0,30239,jerome_b_falk_jr,,1892.683,1905.118,"That is a finding I must respectfully say, which is supported by no evidence in the record because the colloquy upon which that finding was based did not examine the question of the defendant's knowledge with respect to the waiver."
1974.73-5772,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1918.704,1921.011,But that was the finding?
1974.73-5772,0,30239,jerome_b_falk_jr,,1921.011,1924.505,"Well, that's a question of constitutional fact which I think this Court must make an independent judgment."
1974.73-5772,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1924.505,1927.206,"And what did the appellate court do with that, did it --"
1974.73-5772,0,30239,jerome_b_falk_jr,,1927.206,1930.467,Under the California rule of the Sharp case and earlier cases --
1974.73-5772,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1930.467,1931.142,Right.
1974.73-5772,0,30239,jerome_b_falk_jr,,1931.142,1944.523,That that is a sort of a substantial evidence rule the court yielded to what it called the discretion of the trial court in that regard.
1974.73-5772,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1944.523,1945.361,Thank you Mr. Falk.
1974.73-5772,1,28044,howard_j_schwab,,1946.648,1947.295,Thank you Your Honor.
1974.73-5772,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2030.56,2037.685,"Is this peculiar to the defendant do you think, or don't think other lawyers may suffer the same confusion?"
1974.73-5772,1,28044,howard_j_schwab,,2037.685,2043.291,"I think that well, perhaps on individual points but it goes on."
1974.73-5772,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2054.312,2056.98,"He knew the number of peremptories, didn't he, that you get?"
1974.73-5772,1,28044,howard_j_schwab,,2058.277,2063.701,"Well he said there were 12 peremptories, and under California Penal Code Section 1070 in the case of this type, he has 10."
1974.73-5772,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2063.701,2063.908,Oh!
1974.73-5772,1,28044,howard_j_schwab,,2066.98,2070.956,"Yes, under Penal Code Section 1070, he only has 10."
1974.73-5772,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2071.942,2076.032,"Well, is that really so serious, the court can straighten him out easily enough."
1974.73-5772,1,28044,howard_j_schwab,,2076.032,2084.347,"That's true, but problem is that he was in ignorance and all of a sudden had used up his 10 and thought he had two more, it maybe too late for the court to help him out."
1974.73-5772,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2084.347,2093.933,Well we met records up here with retain counsel with complain they weren't advised or something of the peremptories they were entitled to in a joint trial for instance.
1974.73-5772,1,28044,howard_j_schwab,,2093.933,2096.603,That's true but the as --
1974.73-5772,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2096.603,2099.232,The record represented himself in it.
1974.73-5772,1,28044,howard_j_schwab,,2099.232,2099.851,I'm sorry Your Honor?
1974.73-5772,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2099.851,2101.185,Nothing.
1974.73-5772,1,28044,howard_j_schwab,,2101.185,2108.016,But as this Court said in Mayberry versus Pennsylvania that laymen often make awkward scenes.
1974.73-5772,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2139.757,2146.321,-- the other side discussed history and come up with the opposite result.
1974.73-5772,1,28044,howard_j_schwab,,2161.738,2167.878,Well I think -- I don't argue the policy of the states because this is a statutory scheme.
1974.73-5772,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2183.692,2185.274,A federal constitutional right.
1974.73-5772,1,28044,howard_j_schwab,,2185.274,2187.397,"Correct, under the federal constitution."
1974.73-5772,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2499.342,2508.023,Is there any other right that a defendant has that he can't waive other than this one?
1974.73-5772,1,28044,howard_j_schwab,,2508.023,2516.247,"You mean under the Constitution as to -- well, under California law --"
1974.73-5772,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2516.247,2520.981,Under the United States constitution is my question.
1974.73-5772,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2520.981,2523.069,"Right to trial by jury under the Singer case, right?"
1974.73-5772,1,28044,howard_j_schwab,,2523.069,2526.497,"He cannot waive, that's correct."
1974.73-5772,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2647.811,2655.56,"In California, may a defendant unilaterally waive trial by jury without the consent of the court for prosecution?"
1974.73-5772,1,28044,howard_j_schwab,,2655.56,2656.138,No.
1974.73-5772,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2659.751,2661.469,"The court, too?"
1974.73-5772,1,28044,howard_j_schwab,,2661.469,2662.621,I believe the court also.
1974.73-5772,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2662.621,2663.112,-- same as the federal.
1974.73-5772,1,28044,howard_j_schwab,,2663.112,2672.789,"I'm not positive as to the court, but I know for sure the prosecution must also waive."
1974.73-5772,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2778.95,2780.074,Thank you.
