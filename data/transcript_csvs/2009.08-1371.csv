2009.08-1371,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,9.355,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 08-1371, Christian Legal Society Chapter of the University of California -- Hastings v. Martinez."
2009.08-1371,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,10.338,27.831,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: If Hastings is correct, a student who does not even believe in the Bible is entitled to demand to lead a Christian Bible study, and if CLS does not promise to allow this, the college will bar them from its forum for speech."
2009.08-1371,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,42.84,50.851,"Now, these are fundamental arguments, and I don't want to spend too much time on factual matters because that's frustrating to both the Court and the counsel."
2009.08-1371,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,87.681,89.65,"Happy to, Justice Kennedy."
2009.08-1371,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,139.833,156.87,"But doesn't -- doesn't the one -- isn't the all-comers policy broader than the nondiscrimination policy, so that if you comply with that you automatically comply with everything in the nondiscrimination clause?"
2009.08-1371,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,156.87,157.717,It is broader.
2009.08-1371,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,163.682,185.641,"Yes, but -- but the latter, the nondiscrimination policy, you assert is -- is not viewpoint neutral, that it has a particular impact upon a religious organization; whereas, the other policy, the all-comers policy, applies to everybody, and that argument is not available to you."
2009.08-1371,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,185.641,190.499,"Justice Scalia, our argument -- there are two policies."
2009.08-1371,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,206.413,233.433,"But, Mr. McConnell, Justice Scalia had just made the point that the all-comers policy overwhelms the other, so that I would like you to deal up front with the all-comers policy that the dean in her deposition said, loud and clear:"
2009.08-1371,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,256.221,258.799,"--Well, both policies we contend are unconstitutional."
2009.08-1371,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,268.81,283.208,"You can do that, but you -- it's a much different case if Hastings treats the CLS differently than it treats the Democratic and Republican Clubs."
2009.08-1371,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,293.112,302.498,"Your Honor, it's a case where the -- where Hastings has put forward two quite different justifications for denying our right and both of them are unconstitutional."
2009.08-1371,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,304.342,328.629,"Mr. McConnell, when I read -- when I read the papers that Hastings submitted to the district court at the same time that the joint stipulation was submitted, I saw one reference after another to an allegation that Hastings was applying its policy in a discriminatory manner, that it was not in fact insisting that all registered student organizations admit all applicants."
2009.08-1371,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,364.299,367.812,"That's entirely correct, Justice -- Justice Alito."
2009.08-1371,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,368.034,374.935,"Well, you should -- if that was it you should have brought in some -- some evidence of different treatment of other groups."
2009.08-1371,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,376.745,376.951,--Justice--
2009.08-1371,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,376.951,382.851,"--There is none of that except your citation of the bylaws of two groups in your brief, as I--"
2009.08-1371,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,382.851,384.696,"--Well, but that is in fact the evidence."
2009.08-1371,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,385.585,389.601,"But, Mr. McConnell, here is a statement, a stipulation."
2009.08-1371,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,419.683,424.913,"--Justice Ginsburg, we -- we stipulated that this was their policy."
2009.08-1371,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,434.108,434.455,--I wish you would.
2009.08-1371,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,440.016,440.437,--Yes.
2009.08-1371,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,440.437,441.576,--the latter is the policy.
2009.08-1371,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,441.576,445.779,"Yes, because the policy is I think blatantly unconstitutional."
2009.08-1371,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,473.5,501.159,"So is this an exception that you want to talk about as it is applied to religious groups, or are you suggesting that if a group wanted to exclude all black people, all women, all handicapped persons, whatever other form of discrimination a group wants to practice, that a school has to accept that group and recognize it, give it funds, and otherwise lend it space?"
2009.08-1371,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,501.159,502.989,"--Not at all, Justice Sotomayor."
2009.08-1371,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,504.237,513.045,"So then, what is -- what is wrong with the purpose of a school to say we don't wish any group that doesn't -- that discriminates?"
2009.08-1371,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,513.045,518.544,--The stipulation is that they may not exclude based on status or beliefs.
2009.08-1371,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,527.43,528.99,"So, what if the belief--"
2009.08-1371,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,528.99,530.082,--that you just have to let you in that don't agree with you.
2009.08-1371,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,530.082,533.865,--What if the belief is that African Americans are inferior?
2009.08-1371,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,533.865,541.094,"Again, I think they can discriminate on the basis of the belief, but not on the basis of the status."
2009.08-1371,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,541.796,542.377,You could have--
2009.08-1371,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,542.377,542.689,--if there were racist organizations--
2009.08-1371,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,542.689,544.904,"--a student organization, I suppose, of that type."
2009.08-1371,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,552.809,558.884,"--That's right, but they could not go the next step and exclude someone on the basis of status, under our--"
2009.08-1371,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,558.884,560.214,Doesn't this say the opposite?
2009.08-1371,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,577.422,583.876,--It's that the group may not confine its leadership based upon its beliefs.
2009.08-1371,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,584.781,587.077,"That's what you say, but that's not what the policy says."
2009.08-1371,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,595.809,596.557,--Right.
2009.08-1371,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,598.242,599.287,So you cannot discriminate on the basis of status or belief.
2009.08-1371,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,599.287,602.255,--The status half of that is perfectly constitutional and--
2009.08-1371,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,602.255,603.206,You say you--
2009.08-1371,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,603.206,603.799,--the belief half of that is not.
2009.08-1371,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,603.799,609.672,--you have to -- you have to let these organizations discriminate on the basis of belief.
2009.08-1371,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,651.529,659.793,What is -- what is wrong with that is that restrictions on a designated public forum must be reasonable in light of the purposes of the forum.
2009.08-1371,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,675.332,682.394,But this sounds like a debate over whether the policy as the school believes it should be implemented is not a good one.
2009.08-1371,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,697.243,707.098,"There is a stipulation as to what the purpose is, and the purpose is to promote a diversity of viewpoints among registered student organizations."
2009.08-1371,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,707.098,707.488,And is--
2009.08-1371,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,707.488,708.377,That's their way of doing that.
2009.08-1371,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,708.377,708.895,It is a stipulated fact.
2009.08-1371,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,708.895,718.375,"--And Hastings takes the position that it's all in favor of diversity, not only among the groups but within the groups."
2009.08-1371,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,719.42,721.451,Which is not the joint stipulation.
2009.08-1371,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,732.136,733.322,--It is that they--
2009.08-1371,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,733.322,734.164,It defeats the purpose of the forum.
2009.08-1371,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,734.164,743.801,"--They say, yes, we believe in diversity among groups, but we also believe in diversity within the group; that's a good thing."
2009.08-1371,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,748.393,751.205,"They say that in their brief, but that is not the stipulated fact in the case."
2009.08-1371,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,751.205,752.675,"Let me make an imaginary example, and that's--"
2009.08-1371,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,752.675,754.141,--Where -- where is the stipulation?
2009.08-1371,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,754.141,759.639,"It's page 216 in the Joint Appendix, Joint Stipulation Number 8."
2009.08-1371,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,766.558,768.121,Wait a minute now.
2009.08-1371,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,768.823,774.509,"""Hastings seeks to promote a diversity of viewpoints among registered student organizations. """
2009.08-1371,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,797.625,798.358,It may be--
2009.08-1371,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,798.358,799.984,--a global warming skeptic to--
2009.08-1371,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,799.984,804.37,"--It may be an ill-advised policy, but the school says: It's our policy."

2009.08-1371,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,823.865,830.782,--This -- this was not the policy on the basis of which CLS was excluded; is that correct?
2009.08-1371,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,830.782,831.733,"That's correct, it was not."
2009.08-1371,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,831.733,842.34,"It -- when they were refused participation in the -- in the student organization program, they were not told about the all-comers policy."
2009.08-1371,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,842.34,842.668,That's correct.
2009.08-1371,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,859.507,867.799,And was there any written document memorializing this policy prior to the time when the former dean gave her deposition?
2009.08-1371,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,867.799,868.252,Never.
2009.08-1371,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,869.25,879.514,And is the -- is the policy as articulated by the dean in her deposition the same as the policy that Hastings now claims it has in its brief?
2009.08-1371,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,879.514,881.714,--I don't think so.
2009.08-1371,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,938.912,942.675,"Of course, that was not a religion case."

2009.08-1371,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1005.196,1014.816,"Anyway, as I understand your argument on the all-comers policy, it is not an argument that -- that is based upon the religious nature of CLS."
2009.08-1371,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,1022.08,1022.658,--We would.
2009.08-1371,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1022.658,1023.625,Or--
2009.08-1371,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,1023.625,1037.463,"Now, we do -- there is in addition a free exercise argument, but I don't -- but in this case what the Free Exercise Clause protects is exactly what the associational freedom test would protect for everyone."
2009.08-1371,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1037.463,1052.224,"I had thought that an important part of the case, of your case, is that belief is inherent to the idea of religious expression and must be protected."

2009.08-1371,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1112.948,1116.148,But the belief is -- this is the belief.

2009.08-1371,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1135.046,1139.422,"So, they -- they would have to negate their belief in their practice."

2009.08-1371,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1500.503,1500.846,--No.
2009.08-1371,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,1519.153,1520.261,I would address it.

2009.08-1371,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1627.789,1628.725,No.
2009.08-1371,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1638.143,1640.501,That is not an implementation of the nondiscrimination policy.

2009.08-1371,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1667.678,1669.039,"--It does, Your Honor."
2009.08-1371,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1673.082,1673.503,Right.

2009.08-1371,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1685.994,1689.165,So they -- so you're saying the second paragraph is totally unnecessary.
2009.08-1371,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1696.941,1698.738,--I think it provides additional guidance.
2009.08-1371,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1712.792,1716.824,Do you think this case deserved a two-sentence decision in the Ninth Circuit?
2009.08-1371,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1716.824,1727.992,"--Justice Alito, it was decided in the wake of the Ninth Circuit's decision in Truth, which had not only garnered a substantial panel decision but had garnered serious consideration on -- on rehearing."

2009.08-1371,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1759.271,1773.279,But hasn't it been -- hasn't it been CLS's position from the very beginning of this case that Hastings has not in fact required every group to admit any student who applies?
2009.08-1371,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1780.168,1787.585,"If -- if they believe that that caused the school to adopt a different policy, they shouldn't have stipulated to the policy that they did."

2009.08-1371,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1815.651,1815.841,--Yes.

2009.08-1371,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1880.046,1880.327,It has nothing to do with--

2009.08-1371,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1891.289,1892.915,"No, start with mine."
2009.08-1371,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1892.915,1893.399,Okay.
2009.08-1371,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1917.699,1922.34,It seems to me that your position is continually evolving wherever the First Amendment pressure comes.
2009.08-1371,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1940.379,1943.784,"--Well, with respect, Your Honor, I think it's my friend's position that is evolving."

2009.08-1371,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2034.467,2034.919,But--
2009.08-1371,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2034.919,2041.228,And is there any other university in the country that has this kind of a policy?

2009.08-1371,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2043.915,2050.537,"--It's explained in the amicus brief for the American Council of Education, explained in the State Universities amicus brief."

2009.08-1371,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2074.012,2075.041,--Hastings--
2009.08-1371,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2075.041,2080.929,So why -- what's -- what interest does this -- does the school have in this policing mechanism that it's imposing?
2009.08-1371,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2080.929,2083.519,"--A few -- a number of things, Justice Kennedy."
2009.08-1371,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2109.431,2110.289,But you now say--
2009.08-1371,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2110.289,2110.948,--for all school-subsidized groups.
2009.08-1371,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2110.948,2121.285,--You now say in your brief that it is okay for a group to impose membership requirements that are neutral and not based on beliefs.
2009.08-1371,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2122.143,2124.034,That doesn't go to status or belief.

2009.08-1371,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2377.454,2381.857,"--Justice Alito, that's the claim, obviously, that the other side is making."
2009.08-1371,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2392.854,2405.442,"So if you have a law that says every newspaper that's published in the United States must be reviewed every day by the government's censor board, and the fact that the government's censor board decides not to do it, then that law is okay?"

2009.08-1371,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2434.165,2436.665,That was because they might adopt a different policy.
2009.08-1371,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2440.272,2445.58,"And there's -- as to the takeover hypothetical, there is no evidence that it has happened."

2009.08-1371,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2977.129,2979.22,--Not with the all-comers rule.
2009.08-1371,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2979.22,2984.122,"I mean, the other -- it's whether you were discriminating on the basis of one of the forbidden bases."

2009.08-1371,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3046.112,3051.829,"So if the CLS required anybody who wanted to become a member to pass a test on the Bible, that would be okay?"

2009.08-1371,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3138.387,3141.417,"--Yes, that's the policy before this Court."
2009.08-1371,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3141.417,3143.944,That we must do that to decide the case?

2009.08-1371,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3157.315,3159.627,"--Well, could I just ask one quick question relating to that?"
2009.08-1371,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3167.704,3171.701,"--If it's pretextual in the Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye sense, yes."
2009.08-1371,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3178.292,3182.679,And what if we think that the policy has not been evenhandedly applied?

2009.08-1371,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3202.905,3203.424,--No.
2009.08-1371,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3207.873,3214.62,"Let me just say, suppose it were shown that it were not applied evenhandedly, you'd have no problem with our saying that it's then unconstitutional."
2009.08-1371,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3214.62,3217.789,--It -- yes.
2009.08-1371,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3231.8,3261.492,"If this were an employment case, and when an employee is denied promotion the employee said it's for reason A, and then after litigation begins the employer says, well, no, it really wasn't for reason A, it was for reason B because of a policy that we've long had, but there's never -- there's no written documentation of this new policy; and then at a later point in the litigation the employer says, well, it wasn't really either for reason A or reason B; it was for reason C -- do you think that summary judgment could be granted in favor of the employer on the issue of pretext?"

2009.08-1371,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3312.52,3313.394,It does.

2009.08-1371,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3320.124,3320.451,It does.

2009.08-1371,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3368.732,3383.476,Our position is that the registered student organization program is a program of the university; it's subsidized by the university; it's recognized by the university; and that all students should be able to enjoy access to that program.

2009.08-1371,2,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,3478.558,3484.995,That's -- that's because we -- the complaint is accepting the -- Hastings' definition of sexual orientation.
