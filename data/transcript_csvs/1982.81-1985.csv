1982.81-1985,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,7.839,We will hear argument next in the case of DeBartolo versus NLRB.
1982.81-1985,0,34279,lawrence_m_cohen,,84.417,87.322,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1982.81-1985,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,378.954,380.861,What is coercively handbilling?
1982.81-1985,0,34279,lawrence_m_cohen,,380.861,384.406,Coercively handbilling is saying do not patronize this store.
1982.81-1985,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,384.406,384.968,Who is--
1982.81-1985,0,34279,lawrence_m_cohen,,384.968,385.592,Do not shop--
1982.81-1985,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,385.592,386.887,--Who is it coercing?
1982.81-1985,0,34279,lawrence_m_cohen,,386.887,396.307,"--It's coercing the tenant stores to force them to stop doing business, presumably, or put pressures somehow on Wilson's and through Wilson's on High."
1982.81-1985,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,397.399,401.852,"Why don't they, instead of using that language, they had carefully explained everything that was going on?"
1982.81-1985,0,34279,lawrence_m_cohen,,401.852,406.52,--We would have had no dispute with the handbill and it wouldn't have fallen under section 8(b)(4).
1982.81-1985,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,406.52,414.284,"Why... their bottom line would have been, please do not... please do not patronize this shopping center."
1982.81-1985,0,34279,lawrence_m_cohen,,414.284,415.002,No.
1982.81-1985,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,418.157,422.625,"Well, their bottom line is still... their aim is to get people out of the shopping center."
1982.81-1985,0,34279,lawrence_m_cohen,,426.264,432.681,"The distinction that's been drawn for the statute... the statute uses the word coerce, restraint and threaten, section 8(b)(4)."
1982.81-1985,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,478.411,483.098,"Well, let's say we have a dispute with High and here's why and therefore do not shop in this shopping center."
1982.81-1985,0,34279,lawrence_m_cohen,,483.098,490.768,"--It's the do not shop language that then becomes coercive under the act, because now there's economic pressure being put on the secondary."
1982.81-1985,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,501.809,504.667,"But, who's the victim of the coercing?"
1982.81-1985,0,34279,lawrence_m_cohen,,504.667,506.574,The victims are the tenant stores--
1982.81-1985,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,506.574,507.713,"Pardon me, the tenant stores?"
1982.81-1985,0,34279,lawrence_m_cohen,,507.713,514.088,--The victims are the tenant stores who are losing patronage because of a dispute that they have nothing to do with whatsoever.
1982.81-1985,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,527.924,532.736,"Normally when you coerce someone... if you're coercing the tenant store, you're trying to get the tenant store to do something."
1982.81-1985,0,34279,lawrence_m_cohen,,532.736,533.609,--That's right.
1982.81-1985,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,533.609,535.344,"Now, what do you want to tenant store to do?"
1982.81-1985,0,34279,lawrence_m_cohen,,535.344,536.561,That's the problem of the case.
1982.81-1985,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,537.279,538.671,That's why it doesn't seem like coercion.
1982.81-1985,0,34279,lawrence_m_cohen,,538.671,542.184,--The coercion... they're putting pressure on the tenant store.
1982.81-1985,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,549.948,551.133,"But, this is not a normal case."
1982.81-1985,0,34279,lawrence_m_cohen,,551.133,553.398,--That's... and that's why Congress forbid it.
1982.81-1985,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,555.18,556.974,They forbid it if it's coercion.
1982.81-1985,0,34279,lawrence_m_cohen,,556.974,558.741,--They forbid it if it's coercion--
1982.81-1985,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,558.741,564.426,"Now, how can it be coercion if you put the pressure on somebody who's totally unable to do anything relevant to the controversy?"
1982.81-1985,0,34279,lawrence_m_cohen,,564.426,566.095,--Because the effect is the same.
1982.81-1985,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,589.274,593.493,"Let me put it this way, can you make your argument without using the word coercion?"
1982.81-1985,0,34279,lawrence_m_cohen,,593.493,597.833,"--If it isn't coercion, it doesn't fall under section 8(b)(4)."
1982.81-1985,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,597.833,598.255,I see.
1982.81-1985,0,34279,lawrence_m_cohen,,598.255,600.723,And if it doesn't fall under section 8(b)(4) we wouldn't be here.
1982.81-1985,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,600.723,601.3,But I--
1982.81-1985,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,601.3,610.093,"But I agree with Justice Stevens, you're coerced... if you're coerced, you're coerced for the purpose of making you do something."
1982.81-1985,0,34279,lawrence_m_cohen,,611.622,612.262,--That's right.
1982.81-1985,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,632.316,637.409,"So both of you agree that coerce means something that we don't, at least that I don't understand."
1982.81-1985,0,34279,lawrence_m_cohen,,637.409,640.002,I think there's no dispute here.
1982.81-1985,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,657.352,657.963,There could be a law.
1982.81-1985,0,34279,lawrence_m_cohen,,668.395,672.458,--As that term has been defined in the National Labor Relations Act.
1982.81-1985,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,672.458,673.752,"All right, I see--"
1982.81-1985,0,34279,lawrence_m_cohen,,673.752,676.938,And that's... that's what we--
1982.81-1985,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,676.938,693.215,--Is it arguable that the tenant stores could put pressure on the mall owner to include contractual requirements that any tenant store that's building has to pay union wages or something?
1982.81-1985,0,34279,lawrence_m_cohen,,693.215,701.615,"--Well, it's conceivable that tenants might say, we are losing business, and go to DeBartolo, the owner, and ask DeBartolo then to go to Wilson's."
1982.81-1985,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,719.797,724.357,You argue for some unity of interest theory.
1982.81-1985,0,34279,lawrence_m_cohen,,724.357,724.981,--That's correct.
1982.81-1985,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,724.981,727.028,But that isn't spelled out or defined.
1982.81-1985,0,34279,lawrence_m_cohen,,732.37,733.742,Let me answer it this way.
1982.81-1985,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,793.378,794.891,Who would that leave out?
1982.81-1985,0,34279,lawrence_m_cohen,,796.719,799.593,"That would leave out, in this case, the tenants who are not--"
1982.81-1985,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,799.593,800.061,--Okay.
1982.81-1985,0,34279,lawrence_m_cohen,,816.616,824.255,"--According to the Board... one of the Board decisions is since there's no situs requirement in the statute, yes, you could."
1982.81-1985,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,824.255,826.224,And under your test?
1982.81-1985,0,34279,lawrence_m_cohen,,826.224,827.534,"Under our test, you could."
1982.81-1985,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,868.83,876.608,"Well, the argument of the Board is that every major tenant in the mall adds value in effect to every other tenant because you're bringing more people into the mall."
1982.81-1985,0,34279,lawrence_m_cohen,,876.608,878.324,That's where the Board is wrong.
1982.81-1985,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,879.997,880.683,Why?
1982.81-1985,0,34279,lawrence_m_cohen,,880.683,884.618,Because tenants of a shopping center are not engaged in a joint venture.
1982.81-1985,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,888.666,890.6,But they all want people to come to the mall.
1982.81-1985,0,34279,lawrence_m_cohen,,890.6,894.055,--But those people may be shopping at my store rather than your store.
1982.81-1985,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,969.866,971.898,What do you say the handbilling was aimed at?
1982.81-1985,0,34279,lawrence_m_cohen,,971.898,985.035,The handbilling was aimed here to try to cause the tenant stores to lose customers in the hope that somehow that would put pressure on High who was the primary.
1982.81-1985,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1067.673,1071.296,"How did they get in this case, Mr. Cohen?"
1982.81-1985,0,34279,lawrence_m_cohen,,1082.007,1093.5,"--The First Amendment argument was not considered because of the interpretation of the proviso being that this fell within the proviso, therefore there was no prohibited conduct."
1982.81-1985,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1110.493,1114.744,I'm still not satisfied as to why the First Amendment issue is in this case.
1982.81-1985,0,34279,lawrence_m_cohen,,1117.664,1118.288,--That's correct.
1982.81-1985,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1128.782,1132.533,"But the Board didn't in this case, as I understand it, address any First Amendment."
1982.81-1985,0,34279,lawrence_m_cohen,,1132.533,1133.297,That's correct.
1982.81-1985,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1133.297,1137.373,So why... I don't see how the First Amendment is in the case.
1982.81-1985,0,34279,lawrence_m_cohen,,1155.77,1163.113,"Perhaps, then, maybe I should reserve my time to hear what the Board has to say on the issue and address that, unless the Court has any questions."
1982.81-1985,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1163.113,1166.362,"Well, for you to prevail, you have to get over the First Amendment issue."
1982.81-1985,0,34279,lawrence_m_cohen,,1166.362,1167.706,"Yes, we do, if that's before the Court."
1982.81-1985,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1167.706,1172.624,"Now, it may be resolved on a remand if you were to prevail up here, or something like that."
1982.81-1985,0,34279,lawrence_m_cohen,,1172.624,1174.89,We think there's no First Amendment concern.
1982.81-1985,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1196.286,1205.36,"May I ask in that connection if they had right outside the entrance to the mall a soundtrack that recited the exact language of the handbill, would that be objectionable?"
1982.81-1985,0,34279,lawrence_m_cohen,,1205.36,1210.578,"Yes, because it's publicity other than picketing that doesn't fall within the producer/distributor relationship."
1982.81-1985,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1210.578,1214.654,Well then what other means of communication do they have to convey this particular message?
1982.81-1985,0,34279,lawrence_m_cohen,,1214.654,1217.905,"It could... it could picket, as we say, the primary."
1982.81-1985,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1218.748,1222.526,"No, but how could they convey this message to the audience they want to reach--"
1982.81-1985,0,34279,lawrence_m_cohen,,1222.526,1223.041,--They could convey... all--
1982.81-1985,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1223.041,1224.073,--namely people who would like to shop at the mall?
1982.81-1985,0,34279,lawrence_m_cohen,,1224.073,1233.085,"--They could convey... the only thing they couldn't convey was, do not patronize an unrelated secondary employer."
1982.81-1985,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1233.085,1236.895,"Well, you're really not suggesting that there's an alternative means of communication."
1982.81-1985,0,34279,lawrence_m_cohen,,1240.643,1243.875,We're saying the pressure that they put on the secondary is what is--
1982.81-1985,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1243.875,1246.609,--But the pressure is entirely in the message.
1982.81-1985,0,34279,lawrence_m_cohen,,1247.639,1249.592,"--Just like picketing, it's entirely."
1982.81-1985,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1249.592,1251.296,--Well there's some dispute about that.
1982.81-1985,0,34279,lawrence_m_cohen,,1251.296,1252.372,But the--
1982.81-1985,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1252.372,1254.559,You even suggest that there's some dispute about that.
1982.81-1985,0,34279,lawrence_m_cohen,,1254.559,1254.996,--That's right.
1982.81-1985,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1327.044,1330.62,Well suppose the union mailed the leaflets.
1982.81-1985,0,34279,lawrence_m_cohen,,1332.791,1338.145,The evil here is that pressure not to patronize a secondary employer.
1982.81-1985,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1338.145,1343.785,"I said, mail the exact same leaflet to the customers of that store."
1982.81-1985,0,34279,lawrence_m_cohen,,1347.91,1351.627,"In our opinion, yes, because it doesn't meet the producer/distributor test."
1982.81-1985,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1360.327,1364.714,And under your theory even an ad in the newspaper would be invalid?
1982.81-1985,0,34279,lawrence_m_cohen,,1364.714,1379.332,"--The... Congress drew a line between two types of activity, picketing which only can take place at a primary site, publicity other than picketing which can take place at any place and any form if three tests are met."
1982.81-1985,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1402.382,1418.238,Mr. Come.
1982.81-1985,1,37058,norton_j_come,,1418.238,1422.282,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1982.81-1985,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1953.785,1956.925,"What do you say is the product here, now, Mr. Come."
1982.81-1985,1,37058,norton_j_come,,1956.925,1959.908,--Well the product is the Wilson's store.
1982.81-1985,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1996.594,1999.92,So the store is the product produced by the construction company?
1982.81-1985,1,37058,norton_j_come,,1999.92,2000.907,That is correct.
1982.81-1985,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2046.48,2051.433,Does that strike you as a very faithful application of the language of the proviso?
1982.81-1985,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2051.433,2062.644,"It does, Your Honor, when it is recognized that what Congress was seeking to accomplish by the proviso."
1982.81-1985,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2063.927,2070.877,I would think we would know what Congress was seeking to accomplish by the proviso by the language it chose in enacting a proviso.
1982.81-1985,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2070.877,2080.808,"--The language is certainly the starting point, however, but this Court has recognized, and most particularly, in Servette, that--"
1982.81-1985,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2080.808,2082.637,Well that was a wholesaler/retailer.
1982.81-1985,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2084.84,2126.947,"--But nonetheless the argument was that producer meant only the manufacturer, and the principle that sustained a broader interpretation, that is, the Board's Lohman decision which was being reviewed in Servette in which the Board first enunciated the principle here, that a producer is, in order to effectuate the purpose of the proviso, is anyone who adds value to a product in an economic sense."
1982.81-1985,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2149.015,2152.282,I didn't know he... he concedes this being distributed by Wilson's?
1982.81-1985,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2155.78,2160.058,"He does not concede it's what... by the other retailers, but--"
1982.81-1985,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2160.058,2164.667,"--You have to... you have to get over that hurtle, don't you?"
1982.81-1985,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2169.101,2170.102,--That is correct.
1982.81-1985,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2263.189,2274.295,"Mr. Come, in your view, what is important in interpreting the language of in some manner distributed."
1982.81-1985,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2293.726,2337.798,Well I think the... I think the key is whether you have a person that is contributing something of value to a product which in turn is distributed in an economic sense by the persons who are being handbilled.
1982.81-1985,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2370.555,2376.08,"Mr. Come, the proviso is sort of downstream proviso, isn't it?"
1982.81-1985,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2402.57,2408.743,Well it is a big stream in order to--
1982.81-1985,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2408.743,2410.381,"It only runs one way, though."
1982.81-1985,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2410.381,2417.001,--Well--
1982.81-1985,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2417.001,2423.498,Could they handbill the suppliers to the mall stores?
1982.81-1985,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2423.498,2432.436,--I think we'd have to--
1982.81-1985,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2432.436,2435.637,"Have to have a new proviso, wouldn't you?"
1982.81-1985,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2435.637,2451.13,"--Well, let me put it this way, if it were found that the proviso would not protect that then I think that the Court would have to face a very substantial constitutional question that the--"
1982.81-1985,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2451.13,2451.707,All right.
1982.81-1985,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2458.609,2460.313,--Well I--
1982.81-1985,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2460.313,2463.951,"I mean, maybe the First Amendment might protect it, but certainly the proviso wouldn't."
1982.81-1985,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2463.951,2472.089,"--Well, I certainly know of no such case that the Board has had."
1982.81-1985,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2502.388,2505.356,May I interrupt before you get into your First Amendment argument?
1982.81-1985,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2505.356,2505.699,--Yes.
1982.81-1985,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2505.699,2514.212,"Is it not true that, assume we disagreed with you on the proviso, you said they have not yet decided whether it's restraint, coercion and so forth."
1982.81-1985,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2538.579,2548.902,"Well, I think that technically that is correct."
1982.81-1985,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2621.167,2622.606,"Mr. Come, let me interrupt you again."
1982.81-1985,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2633.743,2636.493,--Well... but on this record there is no suggestion of that.
1982.81-1985,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2641.863,2642.568,"Well then, maybe there's no coercion."
1982.81-1985,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2643.083,2644.865,"--But... Well, that may be."
1982.81-1985,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2644.865,2648.612,"--But the Board didn't make any finding of fact on the issue of coercion, did it?"
1982.81-1985,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2652.048,2654.797,"Well, this was a stipulated record, Your Honor."
1982.81-1985,2,34279,lawrence_m_cohen,,3153.186,3154.64,There are three points I'd like to make.
1982.81-1985,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3198.478,3199.699,Well good.
1982.81-1985,2,34279,lawrence_m_cohen,,3203.961,3218.112,"The Board did not make a finding, but on all... they said in all previous cases after remands back and other statements, in Lohman and Great Western... in all the cases we cite in our brief they found that do no patronize activity is coercive."
1982.81-1985,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3219.235,3226.453,"Let me ask you, which is the strongest case among those... closest case among those you've sited to this one on the proposition, just coercion?"
1982.81-1985,2,34279,lawrence_m_cohen,,3226.453,3228.138,--I would pick Lohman.
1982.81-1985,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3228.138,3228.984,"Lohman, I just--"
1982.81-1985,2,34279,lawrence_m_cohen,,3228.984,3232.03,"Lohman and... they're all sited at page 9, note A."
1982.81-1985,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3232.03,3232.545,--I understand there are a lot of them.
1982.81-1985,2,34279,lawrence_m_cohen,,3233.824,3236.729,Board's brief in Servette... any of those.
1982.81-1985,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3238.558,3241.416,"--Just the handbilling, though, all of them."
1982.81-1985,2,34279,lawrence_m_cohen,,3241.416,3244.68,All handbilling... all do not patronize handbilling.
1982.81-1985,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3399.334,3399.728,"Thank you, gentlemen."
