1974.73-748,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,24.877,"We'll hear arguments next in 73-748, American Radio Association against Mobile Steamship Association."
1974.73-748,0,28060,howard_schulman,,26.413,30.914,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1974.73-748,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,412.801,416.224,Has the Court made that distinction?
1974.73-748,0,28060,howard_schulman,,416.224,419.525,"I read Windward, the Court talks about foreign ship owner."
1974.73-748,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,419.525,421.841,"Well, have we ever made the sharp distinction --"
1974.73-748,0,28060,howard_schulman,,421.841,422.079,No.
1974.73-748,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,422.079,425.191,-- that you're making between foreign flags and foreign owners?
1974.73-748,0,28060,howard_schulman,,425.191,428.233,"No, I don't think that there's any sharp distinction, I'm speculating."
1974.73-748,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,428.233,430.407,"Well, the Jones Act to context we've talk about deliberately?"
1974.73-748,0,28060,howard_schulman,,430.407,432.77,"And the Jones Act, yes and wrote deed as you have."
1974.73-748,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,432.77,433.379,That sort of the way --
1974.73-748,0,28060,howard_schulman,,433.379,454.169,"This Court has and also under Rededus (ph), the comments directed by Mr. Justice Harlan and that McCulloch holds that you can't have this evaluation as balancing and nevertheless, the majority -- where dealers majority apparently did not accept that and directed no comments to it and again I assume that they paid attention and disagree."
1974.73-748,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1173.231,1175.347,What does that bill do now?
1974.73-748,0,28060,howard_schulman,,1175.347,1176.533,The energy transportation security?
1974.73-748,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1176.533,1176.96,Yeah.
1974.73-748,0,28060,howard_schulman,,1176.96,1179.792,"And we have it in our brief, cited in another brief."
1974.73-748,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1179.792,1181.329,Distinctly what -- how's the --
1974.73-748,0,28060,howard_schulman,,1181.329,1197.911,"Well, what the law says is that import of American oil, of petroleum products in this country, it's got to be carried 30% of the 30% in American flagships as the legislative history demonstrates one of the purposes as expressed by senate alone."
1974.73-748,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1206.017,1208.191,"Is this what, exports or imports?"
1974.73-748,0,28060,howard_schulman,,1208.191,1209.536,Imports of petroleum products.
1974.73-748,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1209.536,1211.552,Imports to our country of petroleum products?
1974.73-748,0,28060,howard_schulman,,1211.552,1213.918,"Petroleum, carriage of petroleum products into our country."
1974.73-748,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1213.918,1215.493,30% has to be an American balance?
1974.73-748,0,28060,howard_schulman,,1215.493,1217.228,"Correct, up to 30%."
1974.73-748,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1217.228,1219.501,"What do you mean up to 30%, there could be zero?"
1974.73-748,0,28060,howard_schulman,,1219.501,1221.789,No by 1977 as a graduated scale.
1974.73-748,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1224.701,1225.669,I see.
1974.73-748,0,28060,howard_schulman,,1225.669,1231.236,Certain rights are reserved in light of emergency obviously to suspend upon action of the executive legislative fringe.
1974.73-748,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1231.236,1234.23,None of that has any bearing on the issue we have here?
1974.73-748,0,28060,howard_schulman,,1234.23,1235.608,Doesn't have any bearing on it.
1974.73-748,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1254.39,1258.422,"But Congress is making a policy decision, is it not?"
1974.73-748,0,28060,howard_schulman,,1258.422,1260.369,"Yes, and that's what I believe however."
1974.73-748,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1260.369,1262.064,Do you think that's what we're making here?
1974.73-748,0,28060,howard_schulman,,1262.064,1267.99,"No, I think the solicitor is asking you for -- of course when you read his brief, he talks about their concerns."
1974.73-748,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1568.485,1571.637,Very well Mr. Schulman.
1974.73-748,1,24358,frank_mcright,,1573.451,1576.655,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1974.73-748,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1779.306,1793.951,"Well, let's say then you're just saying the preemption doctrine shouldn't apply rather than arguing that it was -- that the impact on the stevedores for example was not arguably within the jurisdiction of the forum?"
1974.73-748,1,24358,frank_mcright,,1793.951,1794.208,Yes.
1974.73-748,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1800.476,1802.56,You would concede and still make your same argument.
1974.73-748,1,24358,frank_mcright,,1809.953,1815.302,Your Honor I think we might allege it but I'm very much afraid that under the --
1974.73-748,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1815.302,1821.086,"Arguably you could, because you are a neutral employer -- you're appealing the pinch?"
1974.73-748,1,24358,frank_mcright,,1821.086,1821.882,Yes sir.
1974.73-748,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1821.882,1827.96,"And maybe the primary employers are subject to the act, but nevertheless, you are the --"
1974.73-748,1,24358,frank_mcright,,1827.96,1834.411,I don't think under those circumstances that the board under Windward could get its hands on the real problem though.
1974.73-748,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1840.972,1847.427,"Well, a neutral employers in commerce and it's subject to --"
1974.73-748,1,24358,frank_mcright,,1847.427,1848.952,"Well, I think the situation there would be --"
1974.73-748,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1848.952,1854.359,"But anyway, you're argument primarily is, even if that's true, the preemption doctrine shouldn't apply?"
1974.73-748,1,24358,frank_mcright,,1854.359,1855.816,Yes sir.
1974.73-748,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1855.816,1869.349,"So you're -- the Solicitor General seems to compel to say that this is arguably within the -- in the jurisdiction of the board but nevertheless there should be concurrent jurisdiction in the state court, is that your argument?"
1974.73-748,1,24358,frank_mcright,,1869.349,1873.259,I think that's the substance of what he is saying.
1974.73-748,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1898.426,1900.333,So that you don't agree with the Solicitor General?
1974.73-748,1,24358,frank_mcright,,1900.333,1902.107,"Not entirely, no sir."
1974.73-748,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1902.107,1907.736,"You say that there's no preemption at all, not even to the extent of allowing the board to have concurrent jurisdiction?"
1974.73-748,1,24358,frank_mcright,,1907.736,1912.886,"Not as to the -- not as to the complaint we made in the state court, no sir."
1974.73-748,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1912.886,1920.235,But if before or after the boards could enjoin the picketing to protect the neutral employer which is pretty close to the certain problem?
1974.73-748,1,24358,frank_mcright,,1920.235,1927.72,"Secondary -- if we could prove secondary motive, perhaps but they couldn't get to the problem that we complained of."
1974.73-748,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1927.72,1933.555,"Well anyway, you'd rather not have to track salary and approve an 8 (b) 4 case before the board?"
1974.73-748,1,24358,frank_mcright,,1933.555,1934.922,That's essentially the case.
1974.73-748,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1936.856,1940.716,You're happy with the state court having exclusive jurisdiction?
1974.73-748,1,24358,frank_mcright,,1940.716,1942.632,Yes sir.
1974.73-748,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2040.943,2048.618,"Just in case here, do you think that the closest to worthy injunction against this kind of so called information picketing?"
1974.73-748,1,24358,frank_mcright,,2048.618,2052.52,"Well, I think Hankey sir."
1974.73-748,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2140.079,2146.44,Is there a state court finding here as to the public picketing?
1974.73-748,1,24358,frank_mcright,,2146.44,2149.423,"In the state trial Court, no sir."
1974.73-748,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2154.9,2157.026,Was that finding critical to your argument?
1974.73-748,1,24358,frank_mcright,,2164.928,2168.487,Yes sir and I think that finding is contained in the Alabama Supreme Court.
1974.73-748,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2168.487,2171.11,Where is that?
1974.73-748,1,24358,frank_mcright,,2179.222,2179.849,"Well, I think --"
1974.73-748,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2179.849,2180.895,In the first instance?
1974.73-748,1,24358,frank_mcright,,2180.895,2181.292,Yes sir.
1974.73-748,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2193.391,2200.851,How suppose should the Alabama Court come to proving what you say the fact shows?
1974.73-748,1,24358,frank_mcright,,2200.851,2224.181,"Well, on page 14 A of the appendix, the dispute was either one between the union and the foreign ship owners to force a rise in the internal standards of those vessels or one where the intent was to block the use of those ships to force congressional action."
1974.73-748,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2243.057,2246.798,What did the Court say as between those two statements?
1974.73-748,1,24358,frank_mcright,,2246.798,2247.934,Sir?
1974.73-748,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2247.934,2260.352,"What did the Supreme Court say to those two statements, did they pick one and there's two, and we'll end this full?"
1974.73-748,1,24358,frank_mcright,,2260.352,2266.657,I'm sorry to use the time.
1974.73-748,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2269.418,2270.017,45?
1974.73-748,1,24358,frank_mcright,,2270.017,2279.699,It's 25 Your Honor.
1974.73-748,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2279.699,2284.378,"Well Mr. McRight, the Court that issued the injunction, didn't it find, is it anytime?"
1974.73-748,1,24358,frank_mcright,,2284.378,2285.723,No sir.
1974.73-748,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2285.723,2287.39,How can you do that?
1974.73-748,1,24358,frank_mcright,,2287.39,2289.514,"Well, I'll say this Your Honor."
1974.73-748,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2307.802,2313.461,"Well, what are left to do on those cargos because they could make their own finding?"
1974.73-748,1,24358,frank_mcright,,2313.461,2319.589,Your Honor I think there's ample findings in the Alabama Supreme Court opinion to sustain the position that you heard.
1974.73-748,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2319.589,2322.741,You got some more arguments that I've already read I see?
1974.73-748,1,24358,frank_mcright,,2322.741,2343.356,"On page 25 and I think there that they take that the Court takes the position that under either alternative, if the purpose was to block the use of Port Mobile to foreign vessels or to force foreign ship owners to increase their wages, either of those would be violative of Alabama public faults."
1974.73-748,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2343.905,2357.904,"Mr. McRight, does the Supreme Court of Alabama followed the custom of many other state courts in reviewing both on fact and law and equity appeal whereas they wouldn't damaged action?"
1974.73-748,1,24358,frank_mcright,,2357.904,2375.179,"Yes sir and they certainly would because the Court -- the case was tried to a judge and in that event, evidences presented to the Court in the appeals instance is -- can be read just as well as heard by the trial court."
1974.73-748,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2375.179,2377.355,And we submit it to?
1974.73-748,1,24358,frank_mcright,,2377.355,2384.688,I don't think it's that much there Your Honor and I do think that it's largely uncontroverted.
1974.73-748,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2575.135,2580.884,Very well.
1974.73-748,2,16456,alex_f_lankford_iii,,2581.98,2586.309,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1974.73-748,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2896.579,2903.017,Does your Alabama rules of procedure in equity cases provide that either party may request findings?
1974.73-748,2,16456,alex_f_lankford_iii,,2903.017,2907.616,"Yes, they may request them but they are not always given."
1974.73-748,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2934.057,2939.351,"Does the circuit judge, I gather from your answer have discretions to refuse finding if they know the request?"
1974.73-748,2,16456,alex_f_lankford_iii,,2939.351,2942.096,"Yes, that is true."
1974.73-748,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2950.679,2954.3,"Mr. Lankford, was a permanent injunction ever obtained in this case?"
1974.73-748,2,16456,alex_f_lankford_iii,,2954.3,2958.979,"No sir, this is a preliminary injunction."
1974.73-748,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2977.986,2981.397,So that preliminary injunction remains in effect to this day?
1974.73-748,2,16456,alex_f_lankford_iii,,2981.397,2982.453,Correct.
1974.73-748,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2982.453,2989.872,"As between your side and the other side, which has the burden of converting it in to a permanent one?"
1974.73-748,2,16456,alex_f_lankford_iii,,2989.872,2992.445,It's his move.
1974.73-748,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3126.472,3139.335,"Mr. Lankford, suppose that instead of picketing and they had place the ads in the newspaper and send out letters and things, would there be a violation to state law by way of unlawful interference?"
1974.73-748,2,16456,alex_f_lankford_iii,,3139.335,3159.473,"No sir, I do not think so cause I gave the purely informational picketing at one set in the path of the sisters unions ILA man going to and from work, it didn't take the port and tie up and clod up the whole port with foreign vessels, far different Your Honor from simply notifying the public."
1974.73-748,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3186.087,3186.544,Well --
1974.73-748,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3186.544,3193.221,"Don't you think Liberia, what do you think Liberia knows about the Liberian flag ships?"
1974.73-748,2,16456,alex_f_lankford_iii,,3193.221,3196.532,I think Liberia has a treaty with the United States.
1974.73-748,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3196.532,3201.477,What do you think Liberia knows other than a little flag on lawyer's door?
1974.73-748,2,16456,alex_f_lankford_iii,,3201.477,3210.512,I think Liberia knows that it collects yearly tonnage taxes and enrollment taxes and it likes the taxes that the ship owners pay to Liberia.
1974.73-748,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3210.512,3212.209,And never seen the ships?
1974.73-748,2,16456,alex_f_lankford_iii,,3212.209,3212.708,Sir?
1974.73-748,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3212.708,3219.54,"And has never laid eyes on the ship, nobody in Liberia has ever laid eyes on one of them?"
1974.73-748,2,16456,alex_f_lankford_iii,,3219.54,3231.382,I really -- I couldn't answer that Mr. Justice Marshall but if the tax laws are going to be changed so that you don't have foreign tax savings.
1974.73-748,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3293.907,3294.793,Thank you Mr. Lankford.
1974.73-748,3,28060,howard_schulman,,3295.911,3297.735,"Yes, a few things Your Honor."
1974.73-748,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3367.968,3369.715,You say 28?
1974.73-748,3,28060,howard_schulman,,3369.715,3371.29,28 of the --
1974.73-748,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3371.29,3372.126,Of the --
1974.73-748,3,28060,howard_schulman,,3372.126,3373.683,Of the appendix.
1974.73-748,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3373.683,3374.502,That's what I --
1974.73-748,3,28060,howard_schulman,,3374.502,3375.857,I'm sorry.
1974.73-748,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3375.857,3376.586,28.
1974.73-748,3,28060,howard_schulman,,3376.586,3377.861,28.
1974.73-748,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3377.861,3378.43,28.

1974.73-748,3,28060,howard_schulman,,3398.117,3398.754,Yes and from which it says we --
1974.73-748,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3398.754,3405.568,And the clue that there was no abuse of discretion?
1974.73-748,3,28060,howard_schulman,,3405.568,3405.828,Yes.
1974.73-748,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3405.828,3406.545,-- based on that evidence?
1974.73-748,3,28060,howard_schulman,,3406.545,3409.84,That that it may have been at the Court below may have based upon that.
1974.73-748,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3409.84,3422.272,"Well, I gather, it would appear at least Mr. Schulman that maybe we don't do this in the federal courts when there are some state courts that I'm familiar with one which did the same thing, equity cases."
1974.73-748,3,28060,howard_schulman,,3431.962,3432.978,"Inequity, yes."
1974.73-748,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3432.978,3434.104,That's what this is I guess?
1974.73-748,3,28060,howard_schulman,,3434.104,3439.322,"Yes, but whether that meets the standards necessary of the First and Fourteenth Amendment, I think it's a different question."
1974.73-748,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3439.322,3441.575,"Well, maybe."
1974.73-748,3,28060,howard_schulman,,3441.575,3454.861,"With respect to the situation involving Hanna and the Windward, in both those instances, the state court regulated otherwise unregulated conduct."
1974.73-748,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3503.346,3512.049,"Before you sit down Mr. Schulman, on your preemption point, I gather you distinguished Windward, of course the plaintiffs here are not the foreign ships?"
1974.73-748,3,28060,howard_schulman,,3512.049,3519.105,"No, that is not the -- it isn't because of titles, no, it's because of the substantive nature of the complaint."
1974.73-748,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3536.139,3537.584,That's the difference to you?
1974.73-748,3,28060,howard_schulman,,3537.584,3545.672,"And the difference here is that there's -- this is not the issue of this plaint here -- plaintiff here, is not to regulate the conduct to foreign ship owner."
