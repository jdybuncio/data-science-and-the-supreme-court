1968.641,0,20225,charles_w_tessmer,,32.928,34.011,"Mr. Chief Justice, --"
1968.641,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,34.011,36.59,Mr. Tessmer.
1968.641,0,20225,charles_w_tessmer,,36.59,39.139,May it please the Honorable Court.
1968.641,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,254.863,256.317,What time in the night was this?
1968.641,0,20225,charles_w_tessmer,,256.317,259.759,"4:30 a.m. in the morning, Mr. Chief Justice."
1968.641,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,337.962,340.858,I take it you don't object to the arrest.
1968.641,0,20225,charles_w_tessmer,,340.858,350.882,"I don't contend that it's illegal because the grant of certiorari was not on that basis, although I think that his Fourth Amendment rights were surely violated by this arrest, and certainly --"
1968.641,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,350.882,352.831,With no probable cause?
1968.641,0,20225,charles_w_tessmer,,352.831,362.878,"Yes, Your Honor based upon Aguilar against Texas, Giordenello versus United States, and Barnes against Texas, holding that Miranda arrest in search."
1968.641,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,362.878,366.271,We're proceeding in this case on the assumption that the arrest was valid?
1968.641,0,20225,charles_w_tessmer,,366.271,375.411,"I have no -- I concede the dimensional difference for their argument concede as valid, although there are some questions under Texas law."
1968.641,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,424.166,427.591,And just what was introduced in evidence at the trial?
1968.641,0,20225,charles_w_tessmer,,427.591,440.496,"The testimony of this friend concerning the altercation, leaving the question open as to whether petitioner really killed the man, or his lady friend who was not used as a witness who was standing there."
1968.641,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,454.771,459.655,"So, what was -- what resulting from --"
1968.641,0,20225,charles_w_tessmer,,459.655,460.462,From this interrogation?
1968.641,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,460.462,462.274,-- from this interrogation was used at the trial (Voice Overlap)
1968.641,0,20225,charles_w_tessmer,,462.274,466.258,"The damaging admissions, I was there at the murder scene."
1968.641,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,487.715,489.086,The gun was introduced an evidence?
1968.641,0,20225,charles_w_tessmer,,489.086,489.753,"Yes, Your Honor."
1968.641,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,489.753,493.622,And the testimony of the arresting officer?
1968.641,0,20225,charles_w_tessmer,,493.622,499.405,"Yes, Your Honor, all of the interrogation and bombing admissions made at 4:30 in his own bedroom."
1968.641,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,499.405,500.924,What?
1968.641,0,20225,charles_w_tessmer,,503.013,504.633,"Orozco, and then the officer --"
1968.641,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,504.633,509.677,And that he owned the gun and that he'd said his gun was in the washing machine that they are going to find it there.
1968.641,0,20225,charles_w_tessmer,,509.677,513.508,"And that he had been at the scene, the El Farleto Caf√© (Voice Overlap)"
1968.641,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,513.508,515.07,-- eyewitnesses have put him at the scene --
1968.641,0,20225,charles_w_tessmer,,515.07,515.698,Already.
1968.641,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,515.698,516.288,Yes.
1968.641,0,20225,charles_w_tessmer,,516.288,516.916,Already.
1968.641,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,516.916,518.039,With the gun in his hand?
1968.641,0,20225,charles_w_tessmer,,518.039,519.957,With the -- no.
1968.641,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,519.957,520.732,Not?
1968.641,0,20225,charles_w_tessmer,,520.732,524.241,"Not with the gun in his hand, the gun in his hand after the shooting."
1968.641,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,538.588,540.08,Circumstantial evidence.
1968.641,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,540.08,542.125,But the record show why she on the witness?
1968.641,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,542.125,543.985,"No, Your Honor."
1968.641,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,558.737,567.52,Miranda had to do with -- itself had to do with interrogation in a jail or in a police station.
1968.641,0,20225,charles_w_tessmer,,567.52,571.563,"Yes, Your Honor, and I think here, this man was a surely in jail at that moment when they."
1968.641,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,571.563,573.717,He was in his own bed in his own home?
1968.641,0,20225,charles_w_tessmer,,573.717,579.339,But he was surrounded by four officers at 4:30 in the morning who had known about him for four hours.
1968.641,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,630.921,640.232,Your position is that the police should have done -- that the Constitution required its police to what?
1968.641,0,20225,charles_w_tessmer,,640.232,642.601,That they caution him of his right to counsel.
1968.641,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,642.601,644.506,And send for a lawyer for him?
1968.641,0,20225,charles_w_tessmer,,644.506,647.789,Or further that he need to answer no questions mainly.
1968.641,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,647.789,649.136,Or arrest him or take him?
1968.641,0,20225,charles_w_tessmer,,649.136,654.747,Or take him to the police station after they've arrested him instead of proceeding with the interrogation (Voice Overlap).
1968.641,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,654.747,658.135,"What if he'd said, my name is John Smith?"
1968.641,0,20225,charles_w_tessmer,,658.135,658.961,"Well, then I think --"
1968.641,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,658.961,660.086,"Or that, I wasn't at the proceeding?"
1968.641,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,660.086,661.127,Yes.
1968.641,0,20225,charles_w_tessmer,,661.127,671.926,"Well then, you would have an exculpatory statement which if it later turned out to be true, would be as damming against him at his trial as if he said I'm guilty, probably more so fabrication."
1968.641,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,671.926,673.996,You might rather arrest him?
1968.641,0,20225,charles_w_tessmer,,673.996,678.372,"This is true, but with an eyewitness who have described his car sitting in the driveway."
1968.641,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,678.372,680.55,It might have been that he was at the scene of the crime.
1968.641,0,20225,charles_w_tessmer,,680.55,682.251,"This is true, I concede that."
1968.641,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,682.251,685.032,At least you take him to the police station anyway.
1968.641,0,20225,charles_w_tessmer,,685.032,698.293,"Well Your Honor, all I can say is that once he said what his name was, the way he went and further, they though enough about him to return twice to a scene to order additional assistance, a squat of armed police officers too to help with the arrest."
1968.641,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,700.275,707.415,"As you say they -- as you emphasized many times, they -- he was suspected of having just killed the man in cold blood, wouldn't he?"
1968.641,0,20225,charles_w_tessmer,,707.415,708.538,"Yes, no question about --"
1968.641,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,708.538,714.339,It is not unreasonable to ask for a little additional help on your arresting somebody like that.
1968.641,0,20225,charles_w_tessmer,,714.339,721.81,No question about their knowing that they plan to use any admissions he made as damaging evidence at his trial.
1968.641,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,962.61,964.623,Did he object to any of them?
1968.641,0,20225,charles_w_tessmer,,964.623,965.873,I don't believe so.
1968.641,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,968.805,970.977,I didn't see any objection at all.
1968.641,0,20225,charles_w_tessmer,,970.977,973.778,He continued to object throughout in the record.
1968.641,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,976.896,980.324,Did he object to the introduction of the statements?
1968.641,0,20225,charles_w_tessmer,,980.324,982.764,He continued to object to all of the interrogation.
1968.641,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,985.345,986.977,I was looking at the appendix.
1968.641,0,20225,charles_w_tessmer,,986.977,992.608,"We have it there, I'm certain I read it, reread it this morning, a careful reading was shown on the voir dire."
1968.641,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,992.608,995.485,I believe the State says he did not object.
1968.641,0,20225,charles_w_tessmer,,995.485,999.512,"The State says that he didn't object specifically, no Mr. Justice Black."
1968.641,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1041.569,1047.698,"Isn't also true that the trial judge when he asked for the board, they cut him off and he couldn't continue his objection?"
1968.641,0,20225,charles_w_tessmer,,1047.698,1053.131,"He certainly did cut him off, overruled him and would not allow him a second voir dire of the witness."
1968.641,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1156.309,1156.906,Very well.
1968.641,1,35306,lonny_f_zwiener,,1166.418,1170.318,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1968.641,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1195.334,1196.413,You agree with him?
1968.641,1,35306,lonny_f_zwiener,,1196.413,1199.512,"-- that it involves a Miranda question, and I don't --"
1968.641,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1199.512,1201.557,You don't agree completely with him?
1968.641,1,35306,lonny_f_zwiener,,1201.557,1203.741,"No, sir, I just go that far."
1968.641,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1236.316,1238.349,"Apparently, they did not what?"
1968.641,1,35306,lonny_f_zwiener,,1238.349,1241.407,Did not force an entry into the rooming house.
1968.641,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1255.837,1258.383,It was 4 o'clock in the morning?
1968.641,1,35306,lonny_f_zwiener,,1258.383,1259.095,"Yes, sir."
1968.641,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1259.095,1261.465,And how many officers were there?
1968.641,1,35306,lonny_f_zwiener,,1261.465,1267.295,There were two detectives that had done the investigatory work and they were joined by two policemen at about the time they arrived at town --
1968.641,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1267.295,1274.152,"So at 4 o'clock in the morning, there are four police officers in the house and they were voluntarily admitted?"
1968.641,1,35306,lonny_f_zwiener,,1274.152,1279.355,"Well, I would -- I say the record does not show this Mr. Justice Marshall --"
1968.641,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1279.355,1280.645,Who is the woman?
1968.641,1,35306,lonny_f_zwiener,,1280.645,1283.033,I would say that this is exactly what happened.
1968.641,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1284.982,1285.751,Voluntarily?
1968.641,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1285.751,1286.798,By the landlady?
1968.641,1,35306,lonny_f_zwiener,,1286.798,1288.088,Yes.
1968.641,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1288.088,1292.083,Do you think she has access to everybody's room at 4 o'clock in the morning?
1968.641,1,35306,lonny_f_zwiener,,1292.083,1295.951,"No, Your Honor, I don't like that contention, I certainly don't like it."
1968.641,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1318.261,1320.572,Do they use search warrants in Texas?
1968.641,1,35306,lonny_f_zwiener,,1320.572,1321.818,"Yes, Your Honor."
1968.641,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1321.818,1335.318,"Somebody showed me some statistics the other day, I don't if they're genuine or not showing that the percentage is very, very, very small that the conventional way is to just go in."
1968.641,1,35306,lonny_f_zwiener,,1336.295,1340.037,"Your Honor, I don't think that that is true."
1968.641,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1347.471,1351.333,"You got a form of search warrant down there you use, don't you in all cases?"
1968.641,1,35306,lonny_f_zwiener,,1351.751,1357.179,"No, however, there are some, some counties have been inclined to use form of search warrants."
1968.641,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1371.335,1372.39,Yes.
1968.641,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1372.39,1377.619,When you said no point of entry (Inaudible)?
1968.641,1,35306,lonny_f_zwiener,,1377.619,1379.168,"Well, I don't know, Your Honor."
1968.641,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1379.168,1396.453,"Well Mr. Zwiener, I understood you say just a moment ago that you wouldn't contend that the landlady had the right, anytime, to admit people to the rooms of her boarders at 4:30 in the morning."
1968.641,1,35306,lonny_f_zwiener,,1398.618,1402.556,"Well, Your Honor, I was speaking to the initial entry to the house."
1968.641,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1405.593,1407.427,"Well, I don't care whether it's critical or not."
1968.641,1,35306,lonny_f_zwiener,,1413.761,1421.874,"Well, Your Honor, I don't know what right did she have, Your Honor."
1968.641,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1421.874,1427.652,"And if you don't know what right, she probably had no right?"
1968.641,1,35306,lonny_f_zwiener,,1427.652,1430.513,"I would, might go so far as to say that Your Honor."
1968.641,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1430.513,1432.932,Very well.
1968.641,1,35306,lonny_f_zwiener,,1432.932,1441.501,"I'm sorry that I got off in the entry because as before, I think counsel and I agreed that the entry and the arrest is not really the controlling thing."
1968.641,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1447.283,1450.32,And there was -- there was an arrest made at this juncture?
1968.641,1,35306,lonny_f_zwiener,,1450.32,1466.791,"Yes sir, and this of course is what gives us perhaps the fact that there was probable cause, raises into the state's focus, this Miranda problem because certainly (Voice Overlap) it had focus on a certain man that was at this caf√©."
1968.641,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1466.791,1472.684,"When you say at this juncture, you mean when the man was in bed?"
1968.641,1,35306,lonny_f_zwiener,,1474.455,1476.209,"Yes sir, he was."
1968.641,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1484.625,1490.408,"Well as I read the appendix, the -- he was arrested after he stated his name?"
1968.641,1,35306,lonny_f_zwiener,,1490.408,1491.62,That's true.
1968.641,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1491.62,1495.007,"Up until then, they were just -- they didn't know he was, isn't that right?"
1968.641,1,35306,lonny_f_zwiener,,1495.007,1495.971,"Well, that is true."
1968.641,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1497.534,1509.189,"When he said his name and the officer said at that point he's under arrest because they had evidence to the man by that name that just shot and kill somebody, is that right?"
1968.641,1,35306,lonny_f_zwiener,,1509.189,1510.344,That's true sir.
1968.641,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1510.344,1516.457,But you -- you take the record as Judge Morrison rendered?
1968.641,1,35306,lonny_f_zwiener,,1517.741,1518.782,I beg your pardon?
1968.641,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1518.782,1522.237,You take the record as your Judge Morrison took it?
1968.641,1,35306,lonny_f_zwiener,,1522.237,1523.767,"Well, --"
1968.641,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1523.767,1527.197,Not necessary in the final result but in the terms of their being an arrest?
1968.641,1,35306,lonny_f_zwiener,,1527.197,1528.32,"Your Honor, I don't know."
1968.641,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1549.977,1555.25,"You're not conceding that there was not in the record -- I mean you're not contending that there was not an arrest then, are you?"
1968.641,1,35306,lonny_f_zwiener,,1555.25,1556.311,"No, no."
1968.641,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1556.311,1557.747,Your conceding that there was --
1968.641,1,35306,lonny_f_zwiener,,1557.747,1558.114,"Yes, sir."
1968.641,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1558.114,1560.598,As soon as he spoke his name?
