1969.108,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,7.302,Colonnade Catering Corporation against the United States.
1969.108,0,37550,o_john_rogge,,10.001,14.623,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1969.108,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,107.115,108.908,Is that annually renewable?
1969.108,0,37550,o_john_rogge,,108.908,109.217,Yes.
1969.108,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,109.217,110.527,He has to get that every year?
1969.108,0,37550,o_john_rogge,,110.527,112.699,That's my understanding if Your Honor please.
1969.108,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,112.699,117.666,Right.
1969.108,0,37550,o_john_rogge,,117.666,132.836,"Now, after they had inspected the public premises, they demanded to see the non-public premises and without permission they did that going into the basement and then this crew of four --"
1969.108,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,132.836,134.511,"This crew, the officer?"
1969.108,0,37550,o_john_rogge,,134.511,142.646,"Three officers of the Internal Revenue Service and one Nassau County Policeman, patrolman, they were officers."
1969.108,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,142.646,146.857,I'm just a little disturbed by your reference to the crew --
1969.108,0,37550,o_john_rogge,,146.857,147.108,"Well, --"
1969.108,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,147.108,149.669,I think they worked over shift?
1969.108,0,37550,o_john_rogge,,149.669,169.995,"There were four people Mr. Justice Black that I think in this case were engaged in the kind of a general exploratory search which was one of the factors involved in the American revolution and which subsequently led to the adoption of the Fourth Amendment, that's what I think happened in this case."
1969.108,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,262.752,265.538,Was that a license to refill empty bottles?
1969.108,0,37550,o_john_rogge,,265.538,268.356,"No, Mr. Chief Justice it was not."
1969.108,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,268.356,271.048,"Well, then what does the license have to do with it?"
1969.108,0,37550,o_john_rogge,,271.048,274.763,"Well, they weren't seeking to collect taxes."
1969.108,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,275.368,281.412,I wondered what was the nexus between the point you were making and the issue in the case?
1969.108,0,37550,o_john_rogge,,281.412,291.019,What I really want to emphasize all the way through is that this was a general exploratory search for evidence and it was done without a warrant.
1969.108,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,291.019,297.928,"But your point would be the same whether he had a license or whether he didn't have a license, wouldn't it?"
1969.108,0,37550,o_john_rogge,,297.928,315.59,"Well, I assume that he has to hang that license in the public premises and the premises were open and they could walk in and if they came in to see that he had the license, they didn't come in for that purpose, we wouldn't have any objection about that nor were they looking for a distillery."
1969.108,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,315.59,318.496,"Mr. Rogge, does the record show how they broke the lock?"
1969.108,0,37550,o_john_rogge,,323.757,328.93,"That I can't answer because the record doesn't show, but it does show that they broke the lock."
1969.108,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,412.037,421.192,"Well, what about the (Inaudible)"
1969.108,0,37550,o_john_rogge,,421.192,425.493,That I don't know whether they picked up a chair or something there to break it open.
1969.108,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,480.526,491.423,"Well, it was a little bit more or perhaps more accurately a little bit less than simply an exploratory search, wasn't it Mr. Rogge?"
1969.108,0,37550,o_john_rogge,,498.693,517.126,"That was stated in argument before Judge Weinstein and I'm prepared to say that that's part of the record but there is nothing in the Government's affidavit in opposition which says anything about that, that's simply a statement of Government counsel before Judge Weinstein and if true, then I say the Government had a whole week to get a warrant."
1969.108,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,517.126,519.958,To get a warrant.
1969.108,0,37550,o_john_rogge,,522.4,523.534,Yes.
1969.108,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,523.534,528.222,This wasn't a catering company that went on to other ground -- into a home or a club and --
1969.108,0,37550,o_john_rogge,,528.222,530.094,"Well, it does that too but --"
1969.108,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,530.094,532.735,These premises were the property of the catering company?
1969.108,0,37550,o_john_rogge,,532.735,542.682,"Right, and they had a public part of the premises and there was -- there was a bar mitzvah, the Saturday before and there a bar mitzvah the Saturday afternoon --"
1969.108,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,542.682,543.272,When this happened?
1969.108,0,37550,o_john_rogge,,543.272,568.784,"When these agents and the patrolman and still a group of four, however I characterize them, I tried to find a word that was as mild as possible and that's why I called them a crew of four but there was a group of four and they were joined by a supervisor, so at the time that they broke open the door there were five of them demanding entry and without a warrant."
1969.108,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,569.587,576.579,Do you in any way urge here that there was not a probable cause?
1969.108,0,37550,o_john_rogge,,581.561,585.043,"No, I'm not saying that, I don't get into that part."
1969.108,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,635.425,639.509,"Well, you just don't raise the issue here?"
1969.108,0,37550,o_john_rogge,,639.509,640.729,"No, I don't know whether --"
1969.108,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,640.729,645.461,"So, we should take the case on the assumption that there was probable cause for the search?"
1969.108,0,37550,o_john_rogge,,645.461,648.312,Yes.
1969.108,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,669.715,690.275,"Well, even without that incident, would you say that there was probable cause or would there have to be some specific evidence about a specific establishment to justify an entry?"
1969.108,0,37550,o_john_rogge,,690.275,707.006,"Well, as to the public part of the premises in the day time they could walk in but if they wanted to break in to something then I would say yes there has to be probable cause varying with the type of case which would have been enough for a warrant issue, yes Your Honor."
1969.108,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,707.006,718.019,You wouldn't say that liquor inspectors could get a warrant from a Judge just by telling the Judge that we want to inspect?
1969.108,0,37550,o_john_rogge,,718.019,719.922,"No, that's not enough."
1969.108,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,719.922,730.622,You wouldn't think that they are justified to have a routine inspection of private quarters in a liquor dispenser's establishment?
1969.108,0,37550,o_john_rogge,,730.622,733.282,"If the premises are open, they can walk in."
1969.108,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,733.282,734.021,"Well, I know but --"
1969.108,0,37550,o_john_rogge,,734.021,751.972,"But if they want to make a search which is what these gentlemen five in number wanted to do, yes, they have to go before a Judge which satisfies this detached official rather than the agent in the field and get a warrant to do that."
1969.108,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,751.972,761.334,"Well, that isn't what (Inaudible) said, is it Mr. Rogge?"
1969.108,0,37550,o_john_rogge,,772.921,798.124,"Well, as I read, Camara against Municipal Court was that the standard of reasonableness would vary with the particular type of case and that would surely be true of the administrative inspections that agents of the internal revenue service engaged in this inspection would have to supply."
1969.108,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,808.262,810.655,"So, you will assume that there was a probable cause?"
1969.108,0,37550,o_john_rogge,,810.655,813.43,Yes.
1969.108,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,813.43,822.247,"Mr. Rogge, while we have you stopped for a moment, let me suggest a possible hypothetical, possibly a parallel."
1969.108,0,37550,o_john_rogge,,870.111,899.641,"Mr. Chief Justice Burger, may I answer that by calling attention to the fact that there is a comparable provision in the case of distilleries where the statute provides that agents may enter -- the Government agents are supposed to have a key to distilleries, they may go in at any time and the statute specifically provides that if entry is denied they may use necessary force without a warrant to get in."
1969.108,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,899.641,899.711,Isn't it?
1969.108,0,37550,o_john_rogge,,899.711,948.144,"Now, entirely apart from the question of -- if you would add to your case that the statute also says in the case of these atomic plants that agents may enter and I mean if you'll make the case comparable to that of distilleries and say that the statute specifically provides that if entry is denied they may use force to enter, I would say that I would have a great deal of that about the constitutionality of that but I would equally say in this case if you look at the statutory structure, you'd have to come to the conclusion that under this inspection statute, that result wouldn't follow because under this inspection statute, there are provisions for forfeiture of $500.00 for each refusal."
1969.108,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1098.638,1114.724,"Well, is this right of privacy extended with the same force to people who are granted a special license to engage in activities that the generality of people are denied as it does to private homes and other circumstances?"
1969.108,0,37550,o_john_rogge,,1114.724,1115.13,I would say yes.
1969.108,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1115.13,1115.902,I meant the --
1969.108,0,37550,o_john_rogge,,1115.902,1155.575,"I would say yes if possible unless I found in the statutory scheme as I do with reference to distilleries, a specific provision that they may enter without a warrant by force if necessary but I would look for a provision like that and not only because we have build up this right of privacy of which the Fourth Amendment as this Court has repeatedly pointed out as an expression but you had another development which began really in 1864 and that is giving to administrative officials that began with a federal tax assessor in 1864 giving them power to issue a subpoena or power to make inspections or both."
1969.108,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1198.979,1212.475,What is the statutory scheme with respect to inspections by food and drug administration agents of the premises of producers of foods covered by that federal law?
1969.108,0,37550,o_john_rogge,,1212.475,1221.63,I have the impression that they resort to a warrant procedure but I haven't covered that field --
1969.108,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1221.63,1222.438,You haven't toward it?
1969.108,0,37550,o_john_rogge,,1222.438,1226.87,"No, but I do want to make another point in that connection."
1969.108,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1324.601,1331.727,"Of course, we don't know how many would refuse if it were decided that they didn't have to let them in?"
1969.108,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1331.727,1336.489,"Up to now, they have been confronted with committing a felony if they refused, haven't they?"
1969.108,0,37550,o_john_rogge,,1336.489,1337.65,Yes.
1969.108,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1337.65,1342.936,And that's perhaps had a tendency to induce cooperation?
1969.108,0,37550,o_john_rogge,,1342.936,1346.734,I don't know about that Mr. Chief Justice Burger.
1969.108,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1389.375,1395.469,You don't think that has anything to do with determining whether a cert was reasonable?
1969.108,0,37550,o_john_rogge,,1395.469,1397.027,That there were liquor dealers?
1969.108,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1397.027,1398.376,Yes.
1969.108,0,37550,o_john_rogge,,1398.376,1401.003,"If Your Honor please, I see no such exception in the Fourth Amendment."
1969.108,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1401.003,1408.355,"I'm not talking about exception, I'm talking about the interpretation of the word unreasonable searches."
1969.108,0,37550,o_john_rogge,,1425.619,1429.074,"The standard for the reasonableness would vary, if Your Honor please."
1969.108,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1429.074,1430.152,"Oh, that's what I was asking."
1969.108,0,37550,o_john_rogge,,1430.152,1430.87,Yes.
1969.108,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1453.032,1460.67,"The language of the amendment that you were paraphrasing, I don't suggest you were undertaking to quote it."
1969.108,0,37550,o_john_rogge,,1465.926,1466.615,It says --
1969.108,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1466.615,1473.61,Justice Black suggests that might be quite different from a factory or other place of business?
1969.108,0,37550,o_john_rogge,,1473.61,1520.083,"It says persons, houses, papers, and the facts but Mr. Chief Justice Burger, I now have see against city of Seattle which says that the Fourth Amendment protects commercial premises and what I'm urging is, what I'm urging in the first place is that this Court at this late date should not breathe an exception into the Fourth Amendment which says that those who as part of their services dispense liquor, their premises are without the protection of the Fourth Amendment but I say in the second place, as a matter of statutory construction, this statutory scheme in this case provided merely for going in and inspecting."
1969.108,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1539.24,1543.036,"Very well, Mr. Rogge."
1969.108,1,30390,jerome_m_feit,,1547.982,1551.077,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1969.108,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1830.643,1842.866,Who indicated that these premises were open to the public that had not been my understanding and while in the Fourth Amendment cases so often the factual framework is very significant.
1969.108,1,30390,jerome_m_feit,,1860.638,1861.668,"Well, the party --"
1969.108,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1861.668,1863.943,"-- tavern, is that correct or am I wrong?"
1969.108,1,30390,jerome_m_feit,,1863.943,1873.403,"No, the record doesn't spell out precisely but I think that generally speaking you're correct but in this type of situation whatever the type of party, they rent it for a specific period of time."
1969.108,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1877.446,1878.627,"Now, it was open to the public?"
1969.108,1,30390,jerome_m_feit,,1878.627,1879.267,What was open was the the entrance way --
1969.108,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1879.267,1890.551,"People right rightly there were the respondent and his employees plus the host and the guess of the party period, this wasn't open to the public was it?"
1969.108,1,30390,jerome_m_feit,,1890.551,1892.87,What was open was the entrance way.
1969.108,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1976.808,1984.772,"So, that's quite a different issue, quite a different question whether it's during the business hours but now it's as open to the general public --"
1969.108,1,30390,jerome_m_feit,,1984.772,1986.526,Though there was any search in the ballroom --
1969.108,2,37550,o_john_rogge,,2902.491,2903.595,May it please the Court.
1969.108,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2903.595,2915.098,"Mr. Rogge, do you care to comment on the possible analogy, the validity of any analogy between the bank examiner walking in and the liquor examiner walking in here?"
1969.108,2,37550,o_john_rogge,,2915.098,2920.972,"Mr. Chief Justice Burger, I was going to address myself to that, going to do it last but I'll do it first."
1969.108,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2941.042,2958.554,"Well, that's confinement to the big vault which almost every bank has where they keep the cash which is the business function and the banker refuses to let them go in to the vault."
1969.108,2,37550,o_john_rogge,,2958.554,2989.094,"I have a great deal of difficulty in answering that without further study because I feel that we should extend the right of privacy rather than restrict it and I would look for ways, I would look at that statutes and if there was anything in the statutes as much as there are in these statutes where there is a warrant procedure, I haven't studied these banks statute but if I found that there was any indication in any of the statutory provisions relating to them that they should get a warrant then I should say the warrant procedure should be applicable."
1969.108,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2992.058,2999.412,As you know the whole statutory scheme providing for bank examination is that the examiners must take the banker by surprise?
1969.108,2,37550,o_john_rogge,,2999.412,3007.506,Absolutely correct and it's the same way with distilleries where there is a specific provision however that they may use force.
1969.108,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3158.053,3170.726,"Well, but then if you were addressing that relating it to the bank examiner, the bank examiner's function is as you agree to catch the banker by surprise."
1969.108,2,37550,o_john_rogge,,3170.726,3171.365,Yes.
1969.108,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3171.365,3178.636,And to see whether the books and the money and all of these things balance out in order to protect the depositors.
1969.108,2,37550,o_john_rogge,,3178.636,3179.377,Correct and I have to --
1969.108,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3179.377,3179.964,For the purpose of --
1969.108,2,37550,o_john_rogge,,3179.964,3188.699,"-- have to repeat the case that I put to Your Honor, suppose he had some locked things in his desk now that's on the bank premises, could they break in there, they say well, we want to examine, we're entitled to examine."
1969.108,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3188.699,3194.26,"I was confining my analogy, my hypothetical case to the main vault."
1969.108,2,37550,o_john_rogge,,3206.965,3220.448,"In that instance he might not have any, in this instance he did. So they say, he said he was there the week before, you'll find this at --"
1969.108,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3220.448,3247.134,You don't think that 5146 in itself would be enough if the revenue agents went to the magistrate and said here is the statute which allows us to inspect anytime during business hours and we want a warrant to examine these premises between 10 o'clock in the morning and 4 o'clock in the afternoon on a business day --
1969.108,2,37550,o_john_rogge,,3247.134,3247.534,"No, if --"
1969.108,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3247.534,3248.666,Would be enough to get a warrant?
1969.108,2,37550,o_john_rogge,,3248.666,3264.191,"No, if Your Honor please and it wouldn't be necessary to enforce this statutory scheme and certainly not in this particular case where an agent or where the Government states an argument before the trial Judge here."
1969.108,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3283.978,3285.945,Can I come back for my another question?
1969.108,2,37550,o_john_rogge,,3302.08,3304.374,"No, if Your Honor please."
1969.108,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3304.374,3306.692,Thank you.
