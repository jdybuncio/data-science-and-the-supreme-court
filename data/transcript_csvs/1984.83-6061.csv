1984.83-6061,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,10.088,We will hear arguments this morning in Garcia against the United States.
1984.83-6061,0,20366,charles_g_white,,13.22,17.742,"Mr. Justice... Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1984.83-6061,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,662.786,675.045,"Mr. White, if the Court were to agree with you in this case, what would be the effect on the Garcias here?"
1984.83-6061,0,20366,charles_g_white,,682.619,684.249,"Yes, Your Honor."
1984.83-6061,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,693.084,699.85,So it wouldn't be necessary to remand for any alteration of any sentence.
1984.83-6061,0,20366,charles_g_white,,699.85,714.198,"Well, yes, Your Honor, the petitioners in their prayer for relief were asking that this Court order the district court to dismiss the count 3 in the indictment which charges this violation of Section 2114."
1984.83-6061,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,714.198,719.982,"Well, yeah, if that were done, the other sentences would stand as is, right?"
1984.83-6061,0,20366,charles_g_white,,719.982,721.624,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1984.83-6061,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,742.368,744.709,"You say there are three categories there, Mr. White?"
1984.83-6061,0,20366,charles_g_white,,748.152,749.421,--That's correct.
1984.83-6061,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,749.421,758.087,"Well, then... but the word ""of"" does not appear in front of the phrase ""other property""."
1984.83-6061,0,20366,charles_g_white,,781.001,787.146,"Well, Your Honor, the... you are correct, of course, in your... in that part of the analysis."
1984.83-6061,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,802.706,803.808,"Well, I'm not the Court."
1984.83-6061,0,20366,charles_g_white,,817.786,821.038,"Well, that may be the case, Your Honor."
1984.83-6061,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,844.645,847.146,"Well, the Solicitor General used to agree with you, didn't he?"
1984.83-6061,0,20366,charles_g_white,,847.146,850.939,"--Well, he did back about ten years ago, Your Honor."
1984.83-6061,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,856.121,856.922,"Seventh, Seventh."
1984.83-6061,0,20366,charles_g_white,,857.964,866.958,"--Well, it was a Seventh Circuit case, the United States v. Hanahan, in which the Solicitor General had filed his... his concession in his memorandum--"
1984.83-6061,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,866.958,873.182,"Was that based... was that concession based on the kind of an argument you're making or not, or was it mostly legislative history?"
1984.83-6061,0,20366,charles_g_white,,873.182,878.415,--It's my understanding of that... my... my understanding of it was that the concession was based mostly on... on legislative history.
1984.83-6061,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,918.122,925.746,"Well, when we... when we remanded that case to the Seventh Circuit, we ourselves didn't accept the confession of error."
1984.83-6061,0,20366,charles_g_white,,933.852,938.985,"Your Honor, my understanding of the history of the Hanahan case was that you did... you're totally correct."
1984.83-6061,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,943.169,948.462,But we didn't... we didn't agree... we didn't necessarily agree with the Solicitor General.
1984.83-6061,0,20366,charles_g_white,,948.462,949.752,"--No, Your Honor."
1984.83-6061,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,951.525,951.875,"Yes, all right."
1984.83-6061,0,20366,charles_g_white,,951.875,953.966,--That we're here on the--
1984.83-6061,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,953.966,955.496,But the Seventh Circuit did apparently.
1984.83-6061,0,20366,charles_g_white,,955.496,958.879,--The Seventh Circuit did agree with their... with their conclusion.
1984.83-6061,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,958.879,959.57,Yes.
1984.83-6061,0,20366,charles_g_white,,959.57,970.447,"And apparently Mr. Hanahan's account was vacated, and he... they imposed a... a conviction under 2112, I believe, on those facts, Your Honor."
1984.83-6061,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,970.447,979.111,"Mr. White, could the Government have charged the Garcias under Section 2112 in this case?"
1984.83-6061,0,20366,charles_g_white,,979.111,980.013,"Yes, they could have, Your Honor."
1984.83-6061,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1475.239,1476.471,"Mr. White, can I... can I interrupt you?"
1984.83-6061,0,20366,charles_g_white,,1499.246,1506.662,"--Well, essentially it doesn't necessarily go into... the fact of the matter is that there is no comma there, and they wanted it there."
1984.83-6061,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1552.063,1559.296,"--Isn't it true that as of today in the modern teaching of English, commas are the most unimportant things known to man?"
1984.83-6061,0,20366,charles_g_white,,1559.296,1561.62,"Your Honor, that may be the case."
1984.83-6061,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1570.885,1573.848,"I mean if that's what you're leaning on, I think it's a thin reed."
1984.83-6061,0,20366,charles_g_white,,1573.848,1582.253,"Your Honor, I don't believe that the... that the Petitioners' position is that I'm lean... I'm not leaning on the fact that there's a comma or there wasn't a comma."
1984.83-6061,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1597.752,1601.115,"You don't take the position that if the comma wasn't there, you'd lose?"
1984.83-6061,0,20366,charles_g_white,,1601.115,1602.026,"No, Your Honor."
1984.83-6061,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1657.471,1662.513,Mr. Ganzfried.
1984.83-6061,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1662.513,1664.486,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1984.83-6061,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1709.136,1711.857,Let me interrupt on the plain language point just... it's something that always troubled me.
1984.83-6061,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1714.349,1715.4,--Yes.
1984.83-6061,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1715.4,1719.241,Is that money of the United States within the meaning of the statute?
1984.83-6061,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1719.241,1722.553,Within the meaning of 2114 it's... it's not.
1984.83-6061,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1723.895,1727.225,So the language doesn't... isn't quite as clear as... as its face would indicate.
1984.83-6061,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1732.35,1736.003,"--Well, it's... it's... it's clear for two reasons: one, because the phrase that follows it is"
1984.83-6061,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1762.51,1771.616,But under your view it would not have... they would not have violated this statute if the agent had not had government funds but had his own money which he intended to get reimbursed for.
1984.83-6061,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1771.616,1774.668,--If they lifted his wallet and took money that he was going to take for a bus at the end of the day.
1984.83-6061,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1776.261,1794.34,"Well, Mr. Ganzfried, under your view, someone who stole, for instance, a hammer from GSA could be charged under this, and then there'd be a 25-year mandatory sentence?"
1984.83-6061,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1794.34,1797.124,"If they steal the hammer, the answer is no."
1984.83-6061,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1798.654,1800.575,Taken in a robbery.
1984.83-6061,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1800.575,1805.9,"--If it's taken in a robbery and its government property, the answer is yes, it's covered."
1984.83-6061,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1825.322,1833.389,"Well, you would say, I suppose, that the prosecutor simply has a choice whether to charge him under 2112 or 2114."
1984.83-6061,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1833.389,1833.72,That's right.
1984.83-6061,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1836.071,1855.886,"Now, if we thought the statute was clear on its face, are there any circumstances, in your view, when the Court could look at a legislative history... if there ever were a case, this would be it, because the legislative history is quite clear, it seems to me, that a postal nexus was contemplated by Congress."
1984.83-6061,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1855.886,1857.865,"Well, I... I... I disagree with that."
1984.83-6061,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1861.377,1864.219,"Well, just assume that for a minute, would you, in answering the question?"
1984.83-6061,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1877.73,1878.758,--Not here.
1984.83-6061,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1878.758,1880.09,As expressed.
1984.83-6061,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1880.09,1883.132,"Not here, because this... the statutory language is clear."
1984.83-6061,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1894.56,1908.839,"Well, suppose the committee report said in... in language as plain as the statutory language itself we intend this to have a postal nexus; that's the intent of Congress."
1984.83-6061,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1915.815,1928.343,"--There's no rule of law that says that the Court cannot look behind the plain meaning of the statute, but ordinarily the Court will do so only when it's seeking to resolve an ambiguity on the face of the statute."
1984.83-6061,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1945.153,1962.323,"--Well, you don't suggest there aren't cases here that rely on the legislative history to narrow the language of the statute; that is, to exclude from its coverage some conduct that on its face is covered by the statute?"
1984.83-6061,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1962.323,1963.095,I'm sorry.
1984.83-6061,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1964.815,1977.494,"Well, you wouldn't... would you deny that there are any cases in this Court that narrows the otherwise broad coverage of the words of the statute based on the legislative history?"
1984.83-6061,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1977.494,1983.789,I would... I would... certainly there are cases that narrow the language of statutes.
1984.83-6061,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1983.789,1997.758,"Well, a... I'm talking about words of a statute that on their face cover the conduct at issue, but it's been... but it's held that the statute doesn't cover it because of the legislative history."
1984.83-6061,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1997.758,2002.599,My recollection is that there have been rare occasions on which the Court has done it.
1984.83-6061,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2008.574,2033.28,"Mr. Ganzfried, if... if Jose Garcia had been prosecuted under 2112 instead on the facts as the jury found them in this case, could the trial court still have imposed a 25-year sentence by just giving consecutive sentences under 2112 and 111?"
1984.83-6061,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,2033.28,2043.628,"--He could have, but 2112 and 111 simply specify maximum sentences, not the mandatory sentence the 2114--"
1984.83-6061,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2043.628,2051.723,"But I mean that enough flexibility would have been present using those two statutes to still give the term that was given, in effect, 25 years."
1984.83-6061,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,2051.723,2055.195,--The court could have done that if it were so inclined.
1984.83-6061,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2055.195,2074.898,"Do you... while I have you interrupted, do you know if there were ever any prosecutions for robberies of nonpostal employees before this section was moved to Title 18 under this section?"
1984.83-6061,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,2074.898,2077.029,Prior to 1935?
1984.83-6061,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2077.029,2078.952,I think it was prior to 1948.
1984.83-6061,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,2078.952,2080.282,"Oh, that revision."
1984.83-6061,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2080.282,2081.193,"You see, it was in 1948--"
1984.83-6061,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,2081.193,2081.914,The revision is when--
1984.83-6061,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2081.914,2087.477,"--think, when it was moved from the postal area of the code to Title 18."
1984.83-6061,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,2095.081,2096.633,--Not that I'm aware of.
1984.83-6061,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2128.212,2128.703,Right.
1984.83-6061,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,2128.703,2131.455,But possibly not the postal nexus that the petitioners are... are talking about.
1984.83-6061,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2131.455,2142.582,And I guess the SG did take a contrary position to the one you're taking now for quite some time about this.
1984.83-6061,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,2142.582,2147.785,"Well, so far as... as far as I know, that position was taken in Hanahan, and it was the only time that the Solicitor General took a position on it."
1984.83-6061,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2147.785,2148.276,I see.
1984.83-6061,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,2148.276,2150.687,"Certainly, the issue... pardon me."
1984.83-6061,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2227.146,2229.229,It's the attempt thing that slips through the cracks.
1984.83-6061,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,2230.369,2233.571,"Well, the attempt that's covered by 2114, that is not covered by 2112."
1984.83-6061,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2233.571,2234.292,--Right.
1984.83-6061,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,2234.292,2265.792,"And so having... having learned that the 2112 option is not always available to us, having discovered the Peek and Sherman cases that apparently the Solicitor General was not aware of in 1973, and having looked at this Court's more recent cases on the reading of statutes, particularly criminal statutes, and the great attention that's to be paid to the plain meaning enacted by Congress as the best and most reliable evidence of congressional intent, when this case came along we took another look at it since--"
1984.83-6061,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2265.792,2277.74,You just don't want... I mean you would prefer not to have the attempt... attempted robbery of government property not covered by one of these two sections.
1984.83-6061,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,2277.74,2278.471,"--Well, we would prefer that."
1984.83-6061,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2286.284,2289.597,I presume you would also like to carry out the intent of Congress.
1984.83-6061,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,2289.597,2292.178,"Absolutely, absolutely."
1984.83-6061,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2292.178,2299.845,"Mr. Ganzfried, in U.S. against Sherman... that was a Fourth Circuit case... that was an appeal by the United States, I gather."
1984.83-6061,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,2304.687,2307.519,No.
1984.83-6061,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2311.302,2313.954,"Well, but the citation is United States against Sherman."
1984.83-6061,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,2313.954,2314.425,Yes.
1984.83-6061,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2316.746,2317.186,Yes.
1984.83-6061,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,2319.728,2321.558,"Sherman did the appealing, yes."
1984.83-6061,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2325.251,2325.652,No.
1984.83-6061,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,2327.241,2330.704,"When cert denied, the title was Sherman v. the United States."
1984.83-6061,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2330.704,2338.2,And what's... why... why is the... why is it captioned U.S. against Sherman in the court of appeals?
1984.83-6061,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,2338.2,2344.004,"As I understand it, that's the way courts of... courts of appeals ordinarily use the captions that district courts use."
1984.83-6061,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2344.004,2346.946,"Well, the practice varies among the circuits."
1984.83-6061,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,2346.946,2354.17,"Well, it may, and I... my recollection of the reading of the Sherman case was that it was a conviction and an appeal by Sherman."
1984.83-6061,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2354.17,2355.011,So it was a conviction.
1984.83-6061,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,2355.011,2355.842,Yes.
1984.83-6061,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2355.842,2357.362,It wasn't just a dismissal of an indictment or something.
1984.83-6061,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,2357.362,2357.783,That's right.
1984.83-6061,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2371.534,2377.218,"Am I correct in remembering then the Hanahan case in the Seventh Circuit, the issue wasn't raised in the court of appeals, was it?"
1984.83-6061,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,2377.218,2377.628,That's right.
1984.83-6061,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2380.2,2387.305,"May I also ask, is this question the subject of the recent legislation that Congress, I understand, has passed some comprehensive criminal legislation?"
1984.83-6061,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,2387.305,2390.136,"--I've made inquiries on that, and my understanding is that it's not."
1984.83-6061,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2390.136,2390.935,It's not.
1984.83-6061,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,2390.935,2396.99,"I can check further on that, and if what I've just said is in error, I will certainly advise the Court."
1984.83-6061,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2396.99,2402.844,What was... what was the basis of your concession in Hanahan?
1984.83-6061,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,2402.844,2404.166,The basis of the concession--
1984.83-6061,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2404.166,2406.907,"What you were... what you filed here, which we don't have in our files."
1984.83-6061,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,2406.907,2407.688,"--Oh, I see."
1984.83-6061,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2414.173,2415.783,So it was legislative history.
1984.83-6061,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,2415.783,2416.404,Absolutely.
1984.83-6061,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2418.746,2419.126,"Well, that's all right."
1984.83-6061,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,2419.547,2419.937,"We said,"
1984.83-6061,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2426.879,2429.39,--Which you now call a snippet or something.
1984.83-6061,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,2429.39,2434.836,Which... which was... which was a snippet then and which is a snippet today.
1984.83-6061,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2434.836,2436.225,The passage of years hasn't charged it.
1984.83-6061,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,2436.225,2439.177,It hasn't gotten any longer since he said it in 1935.
1984.83-6061,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2439.177,2442.911,"Of course, the whole legislative history is only about three snippets."
1984.83-6061,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,2442.911,2450.024,Three snippets and... and 3 7/8 of them are consistent with our position.
1984.83-6061,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2474.2,2485.197,"Does the... does... does the committee report or the legislative history of that 1935 statute or the amendment, was it... it was revised in '35, was it?"
1984.83-6061,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,2485.197,2487.12,There was an amendment in 1935.
1984.83-6061,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2487.12,2491.592,Does the legislative history include any comment by the Department of Justice--
1984.83-6061,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,2491.592,2492.483,Apparently not.
1984.83-6061,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2492.483,2493.194,--On the Post Office's proposal?
1984.83-6061,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,2493.194,2494.234,Apparently not.
1984.83-6061,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2658.348,2665.5,"Well, despite the clearness of the language, the Solicitor General urged us to look at the legislative history in the Hanahan case."
1984.83-6061,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,2665.5,2667.15,--He did.
1984.83-6061,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2667.15,2671.324,"And the Seventh... and he urged the Seventh Circuit to do so, and won."
1984.83-6061,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,2671.324,2677.138,I... I don't know quite what happened in the follow up in the Hanahan case.
1984.83-6061,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2683.282,2683.712,Well--
1984.83-6061,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,2683.712,2685.004,--I assume--
1984.83-6061,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2685.004,2687.646,"--The Seventh Circuit took the Solicitor General's view, I think."
1984.83-6061,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,2687.646,2689.797,--I assume that it did.
1984.83-6061,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2699.772,2706.066,"Well, a different view also apparently on the... on the permissibility of looking at legislative history."
1984.83-6061,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,2706.066,2711.301,"--Well, the ease with which one can have legislative history rewrite a statute--"
1984.83-6061,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2711.301,2715.422,"Well, the view must have changed since Hanahan."
1984.83-6061,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,2715.422,2717.005,--The view... the view has--
1984.83-6061,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2717.005,2719.075,"About that issue, too."
1984.83-6061,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,2719.075,2720.836,--Presumably it has.
1984.83-6061,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2720.836,2721.557,Yes.
1984.83-6061,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,2793.464,2797.067,"Well, two things."
1984.83-6061,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2886.725,2893.64,"Well, sure, but this was in the post office section of the code, and it was suggested by the Postmaster."
1984.83-6061,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,2914.694,2922.999,"Well, we don't know why it was passed, but it seems to me it... I mean we can't look into the inner workings of the minds of the members of Congress."
1984.83-6061,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2936.237,2942.381,"Well, certainly your committee report is contrary to Dobbins' remarks on the floor."
1984.83-6061,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,2942.381,2942.751,--Absolutely.
1984.83-6061,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2943.883,2946.484,And did he file a dissent to that committee report?
1984.83-6061,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,2946.484,2948.604,"--No, not... not that we're aware of."
1984.83-6061,2,20366,charles_g_white,,3415.113,3431.673,"Just to set the comma business to rest, the statute, as you can look at it in its entirety, contains several references to mail matter, to money, and to other property of the United States."
