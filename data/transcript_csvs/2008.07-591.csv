2008.07-591,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.074,"We'll hear argument next in Case 07-591, Melendez-Diaz v. Massachusetts."
2008.07-591,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,7.823,20.318,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In Crawford v. Washington, this Court made clear that the right to confrontation, at its core, is a protection against a system of trial by affidavit."
2008.07-591,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,60.459,61.629,"You say -- you say ""the analyst""."
2008.07-591,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,75.171,76.107,--That's right.
2008.07-591,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,88.274,93.258,"But -- but you would ask -- if a supervisor did it, what would you ask the supervisor?"
2008.07-591,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,113.031,118.857,"I took the Chief Justice's hypothetical to be that the supervisor had actually done the testing, but if the supervisor had not--"
2008.07-591,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,140.424,118.857,No.
2008.07-591,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,146.922,147.374,--That's right.
2008.07-591,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,156.23,157.482,"Well, suppose--"
2008.07-591,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,157.482,157.95,If they want to put in--
2008.07-591,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,157.95,166.946,"--Suppose the tests were by John Smith, assistant lab technician, and you call John Smith, and you say, ""Is this your signature""?"
2008.07-591,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,174.098,178.052,"--Well, if that's what -- at a minimum, that's what we want, Justice Kennedy."
2008.07-591,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,179.861,181.362,"Well, that's what you're usually going to get, isn't it?"
2008.07-591,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,181.362,183.234,"--Well, we don't know what we are going to get."
2008.07-591,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,184.985,192.655,"Well, you know what you're going to get by looking, number one, at the States which allow this, where this happens all the time."
2008.07-591,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,209.053,218.44,"--But even in a test where the analyst doesn't remember and, as you put it, it's a standardized test, there are still plenty of questions the defendant might want to ask, such as what test was performed?"
2008.07-591,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,229.669,233.401,You can raise all those questions from the fact of the -- from the document.
2008.07-591,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,237.136,254.127,"Well, I think that's a choice that defense counsel could make, as the defense counsel always has a choice in a criminal case to decide whether to press the prosecution's evidence or to simply stay silent and then later argue at closing the prosecution hasn't given you enough to prove the case."
2008.07-591,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,274.213,291.645,"Well, then why -- why isn't it an adequate substitute to say that, if the defendant wants this testimony, the defendant can call the analyst and cross-examine the analyst as an adverse witness?"
2008.07-591,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,291.645,308.372,"--Well, three reasons, Justice Ginsburg: First, if that were correct, then I don't see anything that would stop the prosecution in every criminal case simply from putting a pile of affidavits on a judge's desk and saying it's up to the defense to call whatever witnesses he wants and cross-examine them."
2008.07-591,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,379.906,386.277,"But you would say that what they call the notice-and-demand type statute, that that's all right?"
2008.07-591,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,386.277,394.353,"There is a variety of notice-and-demand type statutes, Justice Ginsburg, and I think the law professors' brief lays it out the best of what we have before you."
2008.07-591,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,449.033,454.78,"In your answer, you said, well, there would be this stack of affidavits and that's all the State would have to do."
2008.07-591,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,507.759,508.103,Okay.
2008.07-591,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,565.421,567.749,"Well, but the railroad case was an accident report."
2008.07-591,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,569.703,575.509,"Well, I think that is best characterized, with all due respect, as an argument for its reliability."
2008.07-591,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,649.295,656.229,"But if you had what we can call an independent lab, that certainly -- you certainly can distinguish that from a police report."
2008.07-591,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,659.68,678.783,"Well, I think if you had -- in contrast to this case, if you had a laboratory that was a private lab being used by the police, that would raise the question whether police agents who are private individuals but -- but asked by the police to create something like this, would generate testimonial evidence just as well."
2008.07-591,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,692.573,697.415,"Mr. Fisher, how many States do things the way -- the way you would have them done?"
2008.07-591,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,707.457,710.05,"--Well, let me give you a few categories, Justice Scalia."
2008.07-591,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,725.184,728.95,"Well, they bring in witnesses if -- if defendants demand, but--"
2008.07-591,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,728.95,729.762,"--I'm sorry, I misspoke."
2008.07-591,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,758.876,766.121,I wonder -- and correct me if I'm wrong -- if you -- if you didn't state your case strongly enough with reference to California.
2008.07-591,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,770.792,772.82,That's what I meant to say if I didn't say it that way.
2008.07-591,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,773.273,775.445,Is there anything else?
2008.07-591,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,837.327,842.574,"They might, Justice Breyer, and I'd -- I'd be willing to assume for purposes of argument that they would."
2008.07-591,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,850.838,851.415,"Well, of course, it wouldn't."
2008.07-591,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,851.415,851.852,--Yes.
2008.07-591,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,851.852,854.039,And that's why -- and maybe you have nothing else you want to say on this point.
2008.07-591,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,855.661,856.586,"I think I do, Justice--"
2008.07-591,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,856.586,862.177,"It seems like there are some things going one way, and some things going the other on the issue of whether to call it ""testimonial""."
2008.07-591,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,862.177,869.704,"--But I do want to -- with all respect, I did want to add something to what you said about the rigors of the lab or of science."
2008.07-591,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,911.955,913.078,There have been bad instances.
2008.07-591,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,913.89,914.42,--Yes.
2008.07-591,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,914.42,919.965,But what -- what I'm trying to work out in my mind is not necessarily what happened in the year 1084.
2008.07-591,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,946.766,952.124,"Well, to the extent that is the prominent practice, it's one that grew up under this Court's Roberts jurisprudence."
2008.07-591,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,952.124,952.639,That's true.
2008.07-591,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,952.639,953.313,I think--
2008.07-591,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,953.313,959.373,"But if I assume -- I'm really uncertain as to whether it has covered ""testimonial"" or not."
2008.07-591,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,965.605,966.448,--I understand.
2008.07-591,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,966.448,966.806,All right.
2008.07-591,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,970.772,976.959,"Yes, that -- that, again, it is -- it is not for the court; it's for the defendant to decide."
2008.07-591,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1022.144,1026.016,"Well, a good defense lawyer would love to have the guy there."
2008.07-591,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1052.708,1058.923,"--Well, the best I can do to answer that, Mr. Chief Justice, is to say that empirically apparently that just doesn't happen."
2008.07-591,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1081.042,1087.944,"What does that fact support -- why does that fact support your argument, that in all of those cases you're arguing for what's going to be an empty exercise?"
2008.07-591,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1087.944,1092.69,"No, I would very much resist that it will always be an empty exercise."
2008.07-591,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1092.69,1093.064,No.
2008.07-591,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1109.543,1116.726,"Well, as I said, I think that through notice-and-demand regimes and stipulations, often that is not going to happen."
2008.07-591,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1129.38,1130.972,I absolutely see that point.
2008.07-591,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1176.517,1181.014,--I don't know of any empirical study where you might say what the price of this is.
2008.07-591,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1196.366,1197.321,I'm not sure it's one more witness.
2008.07-591,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1224.961,1233.38,"Remember, Justice Kennedy, that -- that if you look at the States where this exists, that's not what happens and that's not what we are insisting on."
2008.07-591,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1261.384,1263.757,You're talking about the defendants or the lawyers?
2008.07-591,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1263.757,1265.211,I'm talking about the lawyers ----
2008.07-591,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1272.567,1290.887,"--Mr. Fisher, I am interested in the history since that's what the Court held in Crawford, that the content of the Confrontation Clause is not what we would like it to be, but what it historically was when it was enshrined in the Constitution."
2008.07-591,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1302.617,1303.976,Not that I'm aware of.
2008.07-591,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1319.86,1321.548,Why isn't that a business records exception?
2008.07-591,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1322.047,1335.634,"--It is a business records exception, but it's not an exception to the right to confrontation because no one would have considered ordinary business records created without contemplation of litigation to be -- to be testimonial evidence."
2008.07-591,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1336.963,1337.681,"--Oh, wait."
2008.07-591,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1344.617,1349.472,--I think all of the business records that were admissible at the time of the founding would have been nontestimonial.
2008.07-591,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1349.472,1350.334,Would have been nontestimonial.
2008.07-591,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1354.238,1370.152,"In a criminal case -- well, the typical regime -- and I'm going to assume that it exists at the time of founding, but you need some evidentiary rule to get a piece of evidence in in the first place, whether it be business records or whether it be just an ordinary rule of relevance."
2008.07-591,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1382.272,1384.599,"Mr. Fisher, I just want to be about -- clear about one thing."
2008.07-591,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1397.405,1398.533,"That's right, Justice Stevens."
2008.07-591,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1472.096,1475.938,How do we know that this was prepared in contemplation of litigation?
2008.07-591,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1501.647,1510.955,"The easiest answer in this case, Mr. Chief Justice, is it's required by Massachusetts law that -- that these tests be done in contemplation of prosecution."
2008.07-591,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1522.342,1533.366,"Well, the question is it could be law enforcement purposes to test it for the police to use and educational programs that want the rookies to know what the cocaine looks like."
2008.07-591,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1533.366,1551.252,"--Well, to the degree it's not answer ed in this case by statute, undoubtedly this Court as it works through this jurisprudence will need to ask a question of common sense, whether the actors involved -- as this Court did in Davis -- whether the actors involved would understand what they are doing is creating evidence for a criminal case?"
2008.07-591,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1552.344,1552.828,So -- I'm sorry.
2008.07-591,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1553.779,1554.532,--Okay.
2008.07-591,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1555.437,1555.89,Thank you.
2008.07-591,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1555.89,1567.494,"May I -- may I just ask, you would extend this to a -- a breath test, a blood test, fingerprints, urinalysis?"
2008.07-591,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1572.072,1580.644,"To the extent that the prosecution wanted to introduce a report certifying a reporting result of a test, yes, it would be covered by ours."
2008.07-591,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1580.644,1587.081,And you answered the question that a supervisor wouldn't be an adequate substitute for the analyst.
2008.07-591,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1610.244,1616.117,That would work to preserve the evidence in case the analyst became unavailable at the time of trial.
2008.07-591,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1619.834,1622.489,But only if the analyst wasn't there on the day of trial?
2008.07-591,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1622.489,1625.972,Then you -- then I don't think it would substitute for live testimony.
2008.07-591,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1645.558,1646.635,"Thank you, Mr. Fisher."
2008.07-591,1,35638,martha_coakley,,1650.164,1662.362,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The drug analysis certificates at issue in this case are not testimonial statements that have been covered by the Confrontation Clause."
2008.07-591,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1680.431,1703.596,"What is your answer to Mr. Fisher's argument that if that proposition of yours is -- is -- is, in fact, sound in response to this case, the State can put in its entire case by -- in a circumstantial evidence case, by way of affidavit and, in effect, satisfy the Confrontation Clause by saying, well, you can call the witness as part of the defense case and cross-examine there?"
2008.07-591,1,35638,martha_coakley,,1703.596,1711.124,"Because clearly, the kinds of affidavits that are the subject of Confrontation Clause analysis could not be submitted by that."
2008.07-591,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1714.529,1715.964,"Well, then that's what you have got to explain to me."
2008.07-591,1,35638,martha_coakley,,1716.935,1724.695,"--Because first of all, although the Court has not addressed it so far with Mr. Fisher, these are really not testimonial statements."
2008.07-591,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1738.004,1741.503,"Well, what about the -- the blue car going down the street statement?"
2008.07-591,1,35638,martha_coakley,,1748.53,1749.281,"It is, Your Honor."
2008.07-591,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1749.281,1760.823,"And the distinction between that and the lab report saying the substance that was shown to me which I analyzed was cocaine, what's the -- what's the distinction?"
2008.07-591,1,35638,martha_coakley,,1760.823,1770.866,"In the first instance you have a witness to an event in a particular case that can be tied to, perhaps, behavior of the defendant that's deemed to be criminal."
2008.07-591,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1814.583,1789.513,I don't see the difference between the two.
2008.07-591,1,35638,martha_coakley,,1816.127,1825.685,"Well, I think there are several differences, Your Honor, but one of which is that it is identifiable and it can be verified outside of what the scope of the Confrontation Clause is."
2008.07-591,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1838.354,1839.305,"Well, why--"
2008.07-591,1,35638,martha_coakley,,1839.305,1840.413,And it's not true of a witness statement.
2008.07-591,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1840.413,1842.082,--Why does that make a difference?
2008.07-591,1,35638,martha_coakley,,1900.31,1906.946,"I -- I think that that's significant, Your Honor, because it can be tested and verified and isn't dependent upon a cross examination at trial."
2008.07-591,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1906.946,1920.049,"But aren't you really saying that the confrontation right is therefore not so important because you have a greater opportunity in the cocaine case of coming up with -- with rebutting evidence, if indeed rebutting evidence can be found."
2008.07-591,2,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1933.639,1940.997,"Well, I think I go back, Your Honor, to looking at all the kinds of statements that this Court has looked at within the scope of the Confrontation Clause."
2008.07-591,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1949.318,1959.083,"Well, have we ever had -- have we ever had a -- a kind of lab report, public record kind of case in -- in which the record was prepared expressly for trial?"
2008.07-591,3,35638,martha_coakley,,1959.083,1971.53,"I think that if you look at Dutton, for instance, and the concurring opinion by Justice Harlan talking about laboratory reports deemed to be whatever the analysis was, a business record, that would have been--"
2008.07-591,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1971.53,1974.046,"Yes, but Justice Harlan did not take the majority view."
2008.07-591,3,35638,martha_coakley,,1994.303,2011.746,"--Except the public record, for instance of a coroner's result -- not the coroner's verdict that involves Marian-type depositions, but the results of a coroner's verdict that says somebody is dead and this is the cause and manner and means of death -- would have been admissible at the time with -- that kind of--"
2008.07-591,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2011.746,2015.451,"For the indictment, not -- not as -- not as independent evidence in the prosecution."
2008.07-591,3,35638,martha_coakley,,2032.335,2050.203,"But autopsy results -- my understanding, Your Honor, is that autopsy results -- again not a coroner's verdict, which -- in the reply brief we believe that counsel has conflated what would be a verdict between the fact of an official record, an autopsy report of the death, manner and means of death -- have been and still admissible."
2008.07-591,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2050.203,2055.806,It seems to me -- and tell me if this is not the way you want to argue.
2008.07-591,3,35638,martha_coakley,,2061.492,2061.901,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2008.07-591,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2061.901,2076.614,"And it's not testimonial because these are laboratory protocols, subject to ongoing, objective, repeated standards; that's different from testimony that it was a blue car, which is specific to the case."
2008.07-591,3,35638,martha_coakley,,2080.751,2081.297,That's--
2008.07-591,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2081.297,2088.422,"And that as a result of that it is not testimonial because ""testimonial"" is a legal term that's subject to interpretation."
2008.07-591,3,35638,martha_coakley,,2092.138,2093.744,"--Well, that's correct, Your Honor."
2008.07-591,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2093.744,2094.543,As I see it.
2008.07-591,3,35638,martha_coakley,,2094.543,2105.24,"And I think that that is certainly consistent with the way in which this Court in looking at the series of cases from Crawford since, have looked at what a testimonial statement is."
2008.07-591,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2114.627,2119.938,Of course the problem was in -- I think it was Hammond was the companion case to David.
2008.07-591,3,35638,martha_coakley,,2119.938,2120.437,Yes.
2008.07-591,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2120.437,2128.322,The -- the 911 call was done for other -- really other purposes.
2008.07-591,3,35638,martha_coakley,,2147.097,2148.299,"Well, I agree, Your Honor."
2008.07-591,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2183.971,2184.86,Ballistics as well?
2008.07-591,3,35638,martha_coakley,,2186.892,2187.86,--If--
2008.07-591,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2187.86,2191.248,You -- you don't have to bring in the ballistic expert?
2008.07-591,3,35638,martha_coakley,,2191.892,2194.216,"--Not to prove it's a working firearm, Your Honor."
2008.07-591,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2204.697,2206.277,--I don't understand that difference.
2008.07-591,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2206.277,2209.915,"Well, I'm looking at footnote 10 in your brief on page 30."
2008.07-591,3,35638,martha_coakley,,2238.592,2244.652,"Well, interestingly, Your Honor, that argument wasn't raised in this case below and really hasn't been raised in this case before the Court."
2008.07-591,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2261.362,2267.171,"Well, I didn't -- I didn't go back and read the scientific treatise you cite, but you say some interpretation is required."
2008.07-591,3,35638,martha_coakley,,2268.782,2274.28,"--The interpretation that because of the way that the machine works, the chemicals are separated out."
2008.07-591,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2282.855,2284.415,"Well, do you have to have a machine?"
2008.07-591,3,35638,martha_coakley,,2302.33,2304.111,"Well, I believe that that's--"
2008.07-591,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2304.111,2312.106,"And to say that that wasn't raised in the case, this is precisely the question we are going to have to decide if you're going to prevail."
2008.07-591,3,35638,martha_coakley,,2314.231,2314.746,"--Well, I--"
2008.07-591,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2314.746,2315.264,We are raising it.
2008.07-591,3,35638,martha_coakley,,2315.264,2316.325,"--I agree, Your Honor."
2008.07-591,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2339.02,2340.331,How can we administer something like that?
2008.07-591,3,35638,martha_coakley,,2388.216,2388.762,"Well, Your Honor--"
2008.07-591,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2388.762,2389.499,That's his point.
2008.07-591,3,35638,martha_coakley,,2400.398,2411.661,"--Your Honor, I disagree because the issues around many of those wrongful convictions related to suggestive identification procedures, other kinds of issues."
2008.07-591,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2414.878,2421.656,"Aren't there some things I read in the paper all the time, about these laboratories in various places, and they lost the results, they got it all wrong?"
2008.07-591,3,35638,martha_coakley,,2422.641,2428.248,"--I'm not saying that, Your Honor, but I'm saying there are certain evils that the Confrontation Clause is designed to prevent."
2008.07-591,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2441.117,2441.834,Why not?
2008.07-591,3,35638,martha_coakley,,2460.002,2472.808,"Well, Your Honor, I agree the chain of custody is crucial and it relates to the careful procedure that a police officer used, who by the way is the confrontation witness that you worry about because the behavior is the buying, selling, possession of drugs."
2008.07-591,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2503.124,2504.531,"He says -- the policeman says,"
2008.07-591,3,35638,martha_coakley,,2508.231,2511.526,And they marked it in a particular way that identified--
2008.07-591,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2511.526,2514.088,"""And I watched when they marked it in a particular way. """
2008.07-591,3,35638,martha_coakley,,2514.088,2515.024,--And the--
2008.07-591,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2515.024,2521.942,How do I know that that thing is the one that got to the desk of the analyst who wrote this report?
2008.07-591,3,35638,martha_coakley,,2521.942,2536.827,"--I think that whether you brought the analyst in or not, you would have the same establishment of the chain of custody and, indeed, that piece of evidence as to whether it's the same drug relates to the officer in this case testified the packaging."
2008.07-591,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2538.874,2548.482,"So you say you can require witnesses to show that, right up to the analyst who did the testing, you can require witnesses to testify?"
2008.07-591,3,35638,martha_coakley,,2552.276,2560.43,"--I think, Your Honor, that the issue between chain of custody and whether the Confrontation Clause is implicated are different issues--"
2008.07-591,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2560.43,2568.596,"No, but you say that, it seems to me, because you are -- and I think consistently -- making a distinction between credibility issues and reliability issues."
2008.07-591,3,35638,martha_coakley,,2575.752,2576.485,--I think--
2008.07-591,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2576.485,2579.561,"The machine is reliable; therefore, it's outside of confrontation."
2008.07-591,3,35638,martha_coakley,,2587.513,2593.728,--I think perhaps if the Court looks at accuracy rather than reliability and gets outside the realm of the kinds of statements--
2008.07-591,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2593.728,2594.367,"Well, accuracy--"
2008.07-591,3,35638,martha_coakley,,2594.367,2595.163,--that we looked at.
2008.07-591,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2595.163,2596.196,--is an aspect of it.
2008.07-591,3,35638,martha_coakley,,2596.196,2604.346,"But accuracy goes to what this Court has always allowed in referring to, for instance, a business records exception or a public records exception."
2008.07-591,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2610.531,2610.769,No.
2008.07-591,3,35638,martha_coakley,,2617.156,2632.196,"--And they are related, however, Your Honor, because the roots of whether it's hearsay or not and the Confrontation Clause arguments come from the same concern that somebody get a fair trial, that he or she has the right to confront the witness--"
2008.07-591,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2632.196,2632.976,We are back to Roberts then.
2008.07-591,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2632.976,2646.91,"I do wish you would comment on the argument that the State of California -- a huge state with many, many drug prosecutions -- seems to get along all right under the rule that the Petitioner proposes."
2008.07-591,3,35638,martha_coakley,,2646.91,2649.472,"--I did join the amicus brief, Your Honor."
2008.07-591,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2661.857,2677.692,"If the State of California and other populous States have for, I take it, some number of years been able to function quite effectively under the rule that the Petitioner proposes, it seems to me that's something that you have to address."
2008.07-591,3,35638,martha_coakley,,2677.692,2685.16,"--And I address that, Your Honor, by saying that for Massachusetts it would be an undue burden with very little benefit to the defendant."
2008.07-591,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2685.16,2692.608,Why would it be undue for California and not for -- are you accepting the fact that in California it's a workable rule and it's caused no problems?
2008.07-591,3,35638,martha_coakley,,2692.608,2694.983,"I -- I can't disagree with that, Your Honor."
2008.07-591,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2699.421,2701.028,"Well, it seems to me it's a very important point."
2008.07-591,3,35638,martha_coakley,,2701.028,2720.24,"--Well, as a practical matter in Massachusetts, it would mean that district court misdemeanor drug prosecutions would essentially grind to a halt, and the value to the defendant -- and this Court has looked at in Inadi and in other situations where there does not seem to be the real issue involved with Confrontation Clause."
2008.07-591,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2720.24,2728.956,"Then you're predicting that grind to a halt, but there are going to be a large number that wash out because they are plea bargained."
2008.07-591,3,35638,martha_coakley,,2750.727,2756.739,"No, and they often will not stipulate, Your Honor, until the day of trial when they realize that the chemist is there."
2008.07-591,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2761.192,2764.144,Don't these people have to appear before the same judge again and again?
2008.07-591,3,35638,martha_coakley,,2780.87,2785.806,"--Well, two points, Your Honor: In Massachusetts, we do have a circuit court and a superior court so judges move around."
2008.07-591,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2797.348,2798.518,Do you see any reason--
2008.07-591,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2798.518,2802.332,I think California did not join the amicus brief.
2008.07-591,3,35638,martha_coakley,,2802.332,2803.69,Then I misspoke.
2008.07-591,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2803.69,2808.404,--Do you see any reason why a notice-and-demand statute wouldn't satisfy your concern?
2008.07-591,3,35638,martha_coakley,,2808.404,2811.168,"Well, the -- the Petitioner agreed that--"
2008.07-591,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2811.168,2813.122,A bland notice-and-demand statute--
2008.07-591,3,35638,martha_coakley,,2813.122,2823.557,--We would argue that Massachusetts' statute is the functional equivalent of a notice-and-demand statute and complies with whatever concerns the Court may have about the right to confrontation.
2008.07-591,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2823.557,2826.042,What if it's the central issue in the case?
2008.07-591,3,35638,martha_coakley,,2843.421,2847.984,"Well, from the prosecution's point of view that would be a bad strategic decision."
2008.07-591,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2851.576,2852.796,That's a non-answer.
2008.07-591,3,35638,martha_coakley,,2854.2,2855.229,--The rule--
2008.07-591,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2855.229,2860.026,"Can you submit it on the affidavit, as the Chief Justice said under your theory of the case?"
2008.07-591,3,35638,martha_coakley,,2860.026,2860.635,--Yes.
2008.07-591,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2860.635,2863.087,You'd try to have some different hypothesis?
2008.07-591,3,35638,martha_coakley,,2863.087,2879.095,"Yes, because the defendant has plenty of opportunity to both have an independent exam, to subpoena the witness in himself, to make sure that if that is a true issue at trial -- in many instances -- most instances it's not, but he will have the opportunity to cross-examine."
2008.07-591,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2879.095,2880.517,"Thank you, General."
2008.07-591,4,35076,lisa_h_schertler,,2888.687,2901.197,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Confrontation Clause is not implicated when a human being merely authenticates for trial the instruments-generated result of a scientific test."
2008.07-591,4,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2917.25,2923.295,"Well, maybe if you were just -- if you were just putting in the machine, the raw information from the machine."
2008.07-591,4,35076,lisa_h_schertler,,2941.213,2971.652,"If I could draw an analogy, Justice Ginsburg, to a historical example that we think illustrates our point, historically records custodians -- public records custodians have been permitted to certify through, when they have express authority at the common law, and -- and into present day that they did a records search, that they found a document within the public records of an agency, and that the document that they are attaching is a true copy of what they found."
2008.07-591,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2981.382,2981.787,But--
2008.07-591,4,35076,lisa_h_schertler,,2981.787,2982.868,But those have always been accepted.
2008.07-591,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2982.868,2985.96,--It's not material prepared for trial.
2008.07-591,4,35076,lisa_h_schertler,,2991.583,2998.782,The underlying material in the public records case is not testimonial because it was not prepared for trial.
2008.07-591,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2998.782,2999.297,Exactly.
2008.07-591,4,35076,lisa_h_schertler,,2999.297,3013.838,"In this case, Justice Scalia, we would submit that the underlying material is also not testimonial, albeit for a separate reason; and that is that it is an instrument-generated result and therefore not the statement of a witness."
2008.07-591,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3013.838,3022.756,"Let's, let's assume that it's critical to a particular murder prosecution what time the shot was fired, okay?"
2008.07-591,4,35076,lisa_h_schertler,,3039.049,3039.47,No.
2008.07-591,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3039.47,3041.233,He is just reciting what the clock said.
2008.07-591,4,35076,lisa_h_schertler,,3041.233,3072.331,"My analogy would be, Justice Scalia, if that clock had in itself a trigger mechanism that would detect when a gunshot was fired; and if that clock delivered, as you have in the cases of a drug analysis, a result, a reading that one could submit into court that says shot detected at 12 p.m., that that nontestimonial evidence could be submitted consistently with Confrontation Clause principles, but it would still require authentication."
2008.07-591,4,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3086.713,3089.26,"Well, you make me think the public certificate."
2008.07-591,4,35076,lisa_h_schertler,,3123.684,3124.901,"Yes, Justice Breyer."
2008.07-591,4,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3124.901,3140.552,"So I take it that has nothing -- I mean we'll find out, but if they win, every one of those cases, every document you have to bring in the person to make clear that the document that says that this is a copy of the document--"
2008.07-591,4,35076,lisa_h_schertler,,3140.552,3142.19,Our--
2008.07-591,4,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3142.19,3143.282,--Is that what -- is that the point?
2008.07-591,4,35076,lisa_h_schertler,,3143.282,3144.628,"--Well, that is -- that is our point."
2008.07-591,4,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3155.344,3158.795,"But you have to have some boundaries, you have to have some framework, you have to have some explanation."
2008.07-591,4,35076,lisa_h_schertler,,3169.772,3173.067,"Well, Justice Kennedy, this is why I would bring those two rules together."
2008.07-591,4,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3202.699,3203.105,Well--
2008.07-591,4,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3203.105,3203.9,You're going to work either.
2008.07-591,4,35076,lisa_h_schertler,,3230.92,3231.903,"Well -- yes, Justice Breyer."
2008.07-591,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3253.99,3255.849,"Ms. Schertler, please clarify one thing for me."
2008.07-591,4,35076,lisa_h_schertler,,3260.002,3263.048,"--The rule that I have articulated so far, yes."
2008.07-591,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3264.658,3272.684,So would you agree the Confrontation Clause would apply if it were an independent expert's test -- test results and testimony.
2008.07-591,4,35076,lisa_h_schertler,,3272.684,3275.121,"--Justice Stevens, we also have an alternative argument--"
2008.07-591,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3275.121,3275.683,Just tell me yes or no.
2008.07-591,4,35076,lisa_h_schertler,,3275.683,3276.7,--No.
2008.07-591,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3278.993,3281.384,"Well, then we shouldn't talk about just machines."
2008.07-591,4,35076,lisa_h_schertler,,3281.384,3295.504,"--Well, we hope to rely on one of the same arguments that Massachusetts does, which is that there was a broad exception at common law for official records, those created by public officers doing their duty."
2008.07-591,4,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3295.504,3300.003,--It seems to me you have to do that because there is all sorts of machines that have to be interpreted.
2008.07-591,4,35076,lisa_h_schertler,,3308.953,3309.453,I--
2008.07-591,4,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3309.453,3316.464,So just because the machine is involved it seems to me we cannot make a sensible rule based on that.
2008.07-591,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3316.464,3323.338,And there was not a broad exception at common law for public records created in anticipation of criminal litigation.
2008.07-591,4,35076,lisa_h_schertler,,3323.338,3330.443,"--Well, we have -- I mean, we have looked for that limitation in the authorities and we simply have not found it."
2008.07-591,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3330.443,3339.252,Have you found cases where the material was admitted as a public record despite the fact that it was a public record created for prosecution?
2008.07-591,5,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,3339.252,3347.78,"The difficulty with that, Justice Scalia, is I don't know of equivalent or comparable records that were being created at that time for purposes of litigation."
2008.07-591,5,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3347.78,3348.186,Well--
2008.07-591,5,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3348.186,3350.389,"These other records, no, you haven't found them."
2008.07-591,6,35076,lisa_h_schertler,,3350.389,3350.763,No.
2008.07-591,6,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3378.096,3381.171,"Yes but the rule, the issue is not limited to drug cases."
2008.07-591,6,35076,lisa_h_schertler,,3384.357,3400.323,"--Well, the -- the narrower rule that we are discussing here would be limited to those situations in which the underlying evidence to be presented to the jury is nontestimonial because it is instrument-generated and did not require human analysis."
2008.07-591,6,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3400.323,3404.491,So is your -- what is your answer to the question I posed to the Attorney General?
2008.07-591,6,35076,lisa_h_schertler,,3413.503,3416.798,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice for the following reason."
2008.07-591,6,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3435.855,3436.494,But you can't--
2008.07-591,6,35076,lisa_h_schertler,,3436.494,3455.329,"It's just a question of whether -- whether the Confrontation Clause requires that that challenge occur in the Government's case on cross-examination, or as in these record custodian's cases, if the defense wants to challenge the authenticity of the underlying nontestimonial evidence, he must do so in his case."
2008.07-591,6,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3455.329,3458.063,"Could you comment on the California experience, please?"
2008.07-591,6,35076,lisa_h_schertler,,3458.063,3461.045,"I would -- I would be happy to, Justice Kennedy."
2008.07-591,6,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3498.532,3499.42,--Thank you counsel.
2008.07-591,7,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,3501.53,3516.305,"Let me start, Your Honors: If there is any doubt remaining about the machine-generated theory that the Solicitor General was putting forward today, again I would refer the court back to the scientific evidence treatise."
2008.07-591,7,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3557.301,3565.232,So you say they could introduce the squiggly line and put on the stand an analyst who says what that squiggly line shows is that this was cocaine?
2008.07-591,7,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,3565.232,3567.311,"--They could do that, Justice Scalia."
2008.07-591,7,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3567.311,3569.343,What's your distinction with the recordkeeper?
2008.07-591,7,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,3569.343,3570.263,Pardon me?
2008.07-591,7,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3570.263,3574.452,What's your distinction from your own theory of the recordkeeper?
2008.07-591,7,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,3579.556,3587.753,"My understanding of the common law on that, as the solicitor general put it, is that that was a foundational requirement that was not necessarily considered evidence."
2008.07-591,7,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3587.753,3591.427,"No, no, there's a hearsay -- there is a hearsay aspect."
2008.07-591,7,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,3630.192,3632.656,"As a general matter, yes, our rule is consistent."
2008.07-591,7,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3634.813,3635.799,You are going to calling in -- you're going to--
2008.07-591,7,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,3635.799,3637.203,--I'm trying to answer.
2008.07-591,7,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3670.905,3677.839,"The graph, spectrograph or -- or -- or the -- the chart is introduced."
2008.07-591,7,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,3691.613,3695.738,"So long as chain of custody was satisfied, yes, Justice Kennedy, that someone could take the stand and do that."
2008.07-591,7,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3720.133,3738.831,"Why don't you insist, even in that case, on the confrontation right to examine the person who actually conducted the test itself and generated the papers that the later expert testifies on in order to determine the admissibility of the -- of the -- the test results themselves?"
2008.07-591,7,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,3738.831,3740.157,I think the defendant may have that right.
2008.07-591,7,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3746.467,3746.857,Okay.
2008.07-591,7,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3748.56,3754.386,"No, but chain of custody is -- is quite different from the quantitative analysis and the professional opinion."
2008.07-591,7,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,3764.864,3766.116,I did.
2008.07-591,7,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3768.097,3768.818,Let me ask you this.
2008.07-591,7,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,3809.471,3815.593,I think what we are doing here is disagreeing slightly over where chain of custody begins and ends.
2008.07-591,7,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3848.068,3848.583,Okay.
2008.07-591,7,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3848.583,3850.034,"Thank you, counsel."
