1984.84-261,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,67.025,"Mr. Kuhlik, I think you may proceed whenever you're ready."
1984.84-261,0,17773,bruce_n_kuhlik,,67.025,69.827,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1984.84-261,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,255.116,260.77,"Mr. Kuhlik, I'm curious about how this process would work."
1984.84-261,0,17773,bruce_n_kuhlik,,300.078,302.197,"You ask a number of questions, Justice O'Connor."
1984.84-261,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,341.236,348.341,"Well, wouldn't the trustee have to know what the communication was before deciding whether to waive it?"
1984.84-261,0,17773,bruce_n_kuhlik,,348.341,360.482,"Well, not in all circumstances, and I would note in this particular case that the McGhee's have asserted the privilege or instructed their attorney to assert it with respect to the trustee as well."
1984.84-261,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,400.44,404.844,"Well, how does the trustee know that without knowing what the information was?"
1984.84-261,0,17773,bruce_n_kuhlik,,404.844,426.591,"Well, he knows in this case from his experience in pursuing other actions against the McGhee's and other insiders, that information concerning access to the safe, loans to corporate officers and the like, very, very unlikely that they would redound to the detriment of the estate."
1984.84-261,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,515.196,521.683,And what procedures are there in the bankruptcy court to do that?
1984.84-261,0,17773,bruce_n_kuhlik,,521.683,535.158,"Well, at any time, Justice O'Connor, anyone may file a motion with the bankruptcy judge alleging that the trustee has violated his fiduciary duty, has not acted in the best interest of the estate."
1984.84-261,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,548.75,556.606,"But really, the subpoena enforcement proceeding and the bankruptcy challenge are two different kinds of challenge, aren't they?"
1984.84-261,0,17773,bruce_n_kuhlik,,577.602,578.002,--No.
1984.84-261,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,617.912,619.179,On these particular facts.
1984.84-261,0,17773,bruce_n_kuhlik,,619.179,619.779,On these particular facts.
1984.84-261,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,619.779,621.595,That should have been raised in the bankruptcy court.
1984.84-261,0,17773,bruce_n_kuhlik,,621.595,621.929,Yes.
1984.84-261,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,633.939,642.877,"Well, is the power of the trustee to waive the privilege limited to matters concerning the estate's claims and assets?"
1984.84-261,0,17773,bruce_n_kuhlik,,642.877,652.15,"Well, it's difficult to imagine anything that would concern the corporation's causes of action that wouldn't in some way be related to its assets."
1984.84-261,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,652.15,655.352,"Well, I think it's conceivable that there might be some that aren't related."
1984.84-261,0,17773,bruce_n_kuhlik,,657.202,665.041,"I don't see any limitation on the trustee's power, his absolute power, Justice O'Connor, to act for the corporation."
1984.84-261,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,911.42,916.888,"Mr. Kuhlik, do you think the same rule would apply in an individual bankruptcy?"
1984.84-261,0,17773,bruce_n_kuhlik,,916.888,923.56,"--An individual bankruptcy, Justice O'Connor, raises quite different concerns, as we noted in our reply brief."
1984.84-261,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,931.231,932.833,So what's your answer?
1984.84-261,0,17773,bruce_n_kuhlik,,932.833,937.035,My answer is that that is a question that does not have to be decided here.
1984.84-261,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,937.035,942.189,"Well, I would hope you'd respond a little more fully than that."
1984.84-261,0,17773,bruce_n_kuhlik,,943.689,953.763,"Justice O'Connor, I do not think as a matter of course that in every circumstance a bankruptcy trustee should be able to waive an individual's privilege."
1984.84-261,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,968.589,991.372,"What if the third party asking for the information in a corporate liquidation is some tax commissioner, and suppose that the disclosure of the information would have the effect of revealing some taxes that might be due that would eliminate any hope of recovery by the creditors?"
1984.84-261,0,17773,bruce_n_kuhlik,,991.372,995.924,"Justice O'Connor, that's exactly the situation where the trustee would not waive the privilege."
1984.84-261,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,995.924,1003.68,"Well, how is the trustee going to know unless he finds out the answer first as to what the information is?"
1984.84-261,0,17773,bruce_n_kuhlik,,1003.68,1017.689,"I would suggest the facts of this case may be somewhat unusual in that the trustee did not have the information before him when he made the waiver, and that in most circumstances one would hope that the trustee would have the information."
1984.84-261,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1033.449,1034.599,May I just ask one question.
1984.84-261,0,17773,bruce_n_kuhlik,,1034.599,1035.765,"--Yes, Justice Stevens."
1984.84-261,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1035.765,1043.455,"Following up on Justice O'Connor's question about individual, I gather then from your answer on individual you do not contend that the privilege is an asset of the estate?"
1984.84-261,0,17773,bruce_n_kuhlik,,1043.455,1046.49,We make that as an alternative argument.
1984.84-261,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1046.49,1048.906,"If you make that as an alternative argument, that would apply to an individual."
1984.84-261,0,17773,bruce_n_kuhlik,,1048.906,1049.692,That is correct.
1984.84-261,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1053.477,1060.131,"But since you said this case does not necessarily control individual situations, you must be saying it's not an asset of the estate."
1984.84-261,0,17773,bruce_n_kuhlik,,1060.131,1063.683,If you decide this case on the ground that the--
1984.84-261,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1063.683,1067.486,"Well, let me put it to you: Is it your position that the privilege is an asset of the estate?"
1984.84-261,0,17773,bruce_n_kuhlik,,1067.486,1069.986,--That is an alternative position.
1984.84-261,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1075.054,1078.24,"In other words, you don't really have a position on whether it is or is not?"
1984.84-261,0,17773,bruce_n_kuhlik,,1078.24,1079.525,--Many--
1984.84-261,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1079.525,1081.692,"You want to win the lawsuit, is what you're saying."
1984.84-261,0,17773,bruce_n_kuhlik,,1081.692,1094.767,--We believe that the most reasoned approach to this and the one that makes the most sense is to find that the trustee is the management of the corporation and controls the privilege in that capacity.
1984.84-261,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1101.605,1113.813,"Does it follow under your management theory that if you have a reorganization and the reorganization trustee employs counsel and gets legal advice, that after the reorganization successor management could waive his privilege?"
1984.84-261,0,17773,bruce_n_kuhlik,,1113.813,1120.633,"I believe that would follow, Justice Stevens."
1984.84-261,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1120.633,1129.156,"In normal business when a man sells his business to another individual, the attorney-client privilege is part of it?"
1984.84-261,0,17773,bruce_n_kuhlik,,1129.156,1138.344,"Justice Marshall, the answer to that question depends on whether the privilege is necessary to realize the acquired interest."
1984.84-261,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1140.963,1149.486,"I thought basically that attorney-client privilege was a ""personal"" privilege."
1984.84-261,0,17773,bruce_n_kuhlik,,1149.486,1150.552,I believe the cases--
1984.84-261,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1150.552,1153.021,"Well, how do you pass along a personal privilege?"
1984.84-261,0,17773,bruce_n_kuhlik,,1153.021,1154.238,"--I'm sorry, Justice Marshall?"
1984.84-261,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1154.238,1156.24,How do you pass along a personal privilege?
1984.84-261,0,17773,bruce_n_kuhlik,,1156.24,1162.977,If you pass along a property right that the privilege is necessary to--
1984.84-261,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1162.977,1165.096,Is that a property... is attorney-client privilege a property right?
1984.84-261,0,17773,bruce_n_kuhlik,,1165.096,1167.562,--No.
1984.84-261,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1180.271,1187.175,"My only point is, speaking for myself, the personal one, you're carrying a whole lot of baggage."
1984.84-261,0,17773,bruce_n_kuhlik,,1192.496,1199.833,I suggest I'm not trying to suggest here absolutely that the individual should control the privilege.
1984.84-261,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1307.221,1308.904,"Mr. Kuhlik, can I back up just a second."
1984.84-261,0,17773,bruce_n_kuhlik,,1308.904,1309.187,Sure.
1984.84-261,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1309.187,1318.01,"Take the situation right before bankruptcy, when a corporation is in desperate straits and feels it needs legal advice in a lot of difficult problems."
1984.84-261,0,17773,bruce_n_kuhlik,,1328.634,1342.727,It is absolutely a usual practice for corporate counsel in a situation like that to advise corporate officers that they are not the ones who control whether their communications will be disclosed.
1984.84-261,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1359.987,1362.106,"Then your answer is yes, they should tell them that?"
1984.84-261,0,17773,bruce_n_kuhlik,,1362.106,1363.574,--They should definitely tell them and they do.
1984.84-261,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1572.709,1579.714,"Well, does he have any real fiduciary responsibility at all to the people in the position such as Mr. McGhee?"
1984.84-261,0,17773,bruce_n_kuhlik,,1588.07,1595.058,"--Justice Rehnquist, he has fiduciary responsibilities to everyone who has an interest in the estate."
1984.84-261,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1607.049,1608.651,Or of prior management generally?
1984.84-261,0,17773,bruce_n_kuhlik,,1608.651,1609.251,That's true.
1984.84-261,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1628.712,1634.968,Mr. Epstein.
1984.84-261,1,20799,david_a_epstein,,1634.968,1641.122,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1984.84-261,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1739.702,1742.118,Whose privilege is it?
1984.84-261,1,20799,david_a_epstein,,1742.118,1748.724,"It is... in this instance, it is the corporation's privilege."
1984.84-261,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1748.724,1751.676,"Well, it was and it still is."
1984.84-261,1,20799,david_a_epstein,,1751.676,1753.443,"That's our position, Your Honor."
1984.84-261,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1753.443,1754.462,"Well, I know."
1984.84-261,1,20799,david_a_epstein,,1762.781,1768.852,I would agree with that upon the occurrence of bankruptcy.
1984.84-261,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1770.387,1771.771,"Well, just forget bankruptcy for a minute."
1984.84-261,1,20799,david_a_epstein,,1775.625,1777.691,"--Yes, and they're the only ones who can."
1984.84-261,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1777.691,1784.814,"Well, and suppose then they had a stockholders meeting and they voted out the old management, put in some new management."
1984.84-261,1,20799,david_a_epstein,,1786.397,1787.016,Absolutely.
1984.84-261,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1787.016,1789.266,"Well, what's wrong with the trustee waiving it?"
1984.84-261,1,20799,david_a_epstein,,1789.266,1790.468,He's not management.
1984.84-261,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1790.468,1791.268,Why isn't he?
1984.84-261,1,20799,david_a_epstein,,1791.268,1795.955,"Because the board of directors, who is management, still exists."
1984.84-261,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1795.955,1797.789,What are the trustee's powers?
1984.84-261,1,20799,david_a_epstein,,1799.157,1802.942,It is perhaps--
1984.84-261,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1802.942,1804.792,"This isn't a debtor in possession, is it?"
1984.84-261,1,20799,david_a_epstein,,1804.792,1806.91,"--No, but I don't think it matters."
1984.84-261,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1806.91,1808.494,"Well, I know you don't."
1984.84-261,1,20799,david_a_epstein,,1821.385,1824.254,They are no longer operating the business.
1984.84-261,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1825.304,1827.789,"Well, operating, then."
1984.84-261,1,20799,david_a_epstein,,1827.789,1832.692,"--Well, let's talk about operating if that's the direction Your Honor wishes to pursue."
1984.84-261,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1832.692,1833.692,"Well, that's your direction."
1984.84-261,1,20799,david_a_epstein,,1837.327,1851.004,"In a chapter 7, such as is before the Court in this case, the operation of the business is nothing more than winding down its affairs."
1984.84-261,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1858.575,1859.393,A reorganization.
1984.84-261,1,20799,david_a_epstein,,1859.393,1865.514,"--In a reorganization, whether it's a debtor in possession is a trustee, there is a genuine operation of the business."
1984.84-261,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1963.66,1964.66,May I interrupt.
1984.84-261,1,20799,david_a_epstein,,1969.064,1980.103,"--The only factor is that, unlike an individual who operates a business, a corporation who operates has divided the management from the ownership."
1984.84-261,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1982.372,1990.144,"The question I wanted to ask, I guess it applies equally to an individual or a corporation, is really the same one Justice O'Connor asked earlier."
1984.84-261,1,20799,david_a_epstein,,2001.286,2016.128,"I would not agree, but I would suggest to the Court... and frankly, the reason I would not agree is because, having examined the law and the cases, and I must say somewhat to my surprise as I got into this, it's not there either."
1984.84-261,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2033.655,2043.029,I should think there'd be many cases in which information that had been imparted to counsel in a privileged communication might well be an important corporate asset.
1984.84-261,1,20799,david_a_epstein,,2043.029,2044.229,"--Well, I think--"
1984.84-261,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2044.229,2049.516,"For example, you might describe a trade secret or a customer list or something like that in the course of such a communication."
1984.84-261,1,20799,david_a_epstein,,2049.516,2052.484,"--As a practical matter, Your Honor, I might agree with you."
1984.84-261,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2099.949,2108.988,Give me an example of where it's held that the privilege is not to be waived?
1984.84-261,1,20799,david_a_epstein,,2110.904,2117.844,"I cannot give you any case before 1976, I believe."
1984.84-261,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2132.853,2135.153,"Well, does the question come up when the trustee sues somebody?"
1984.84-261,1,20799,david_a_epstein,,2135.153,2140.19,The question of waiver has never come up.
1984.84-261,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2143.209,2148.613,"Well, give me an example of litigation where the privilege would be claimed, and by whom."
1984.84-261,1,20799,david_a_epstein,,2148.613,2163.206,"The litigation, which are very old cases, around the turn of the century mostly, are cases where the trustee sought to question the attorney of the debtor."
1984.84-261,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2184.186,2185.269,And the lawyer claimed the privilege?
1984.84-261,1,20799,david_a_epstein,,2185.269,2186.738,"The lawyer claimed the privilege, absolutely."
1984.84-261,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2247.193,2248.493,"Well, what's the matter with that?"
1984.84-261,1,20799,david_a_epstein,,2257.482,2271.641,"--If the board of directors of the company, who represent the ownership of the company, if they determine to waive the privilege for reasons that are good to them, I have no objection whatsoever."
1984.84-261,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2280.264,2291.805,"Well, how did the interests of the shareholders and the creditors differ in the context of a liquidation?"
1984.84-261,1,20799,david_a_epstein,,2313.552,2322.991,"Ordinarily, in the common case, I would assume that Your Honor's suggestion would be correct."
1984.84-261,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2370.552,2373.754,"Yes, that's why I asked those questions."
1984.84-261,1,20799,david_a_epstein,,2395.12,2401.458,--The trustee shouldn't be able to waive it because the trustee may or may not be doing it for that reason.
1984.84-261,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2417.95,2424.723,"Well, but the trustee doesn't have to go to the directors for any other purpose in maximizing the value of the estate."
1984.84-261,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2437.697,2441.935,Especially when he may have a suit pending against the board of directors.
1984.84-261,1,20799,david_a_epstein,,2441.935,2456.86,"--Well, I think the simple answer to that is that the importance of the attorney-client privilege and what it protects and the need for this Court to continue that protection and not abrogate it--"
1984.84-261,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2456.86,2460.146,Is there any other privileged matter that needs the protection?
1984.84-261,1,20799,david_a_epstein,,2460.146,2463.531,"--Well, it doesn't arise in this case, but I would say--"
1984.84-261,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2463.531,2464.714,Is there any other?
1984.84-261,1,20799,david_a_epstein,,2464.714,2467.383,"--I would say the other privileges, certainly."
1984.84-261,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2467.383,2468.752,What privilege?
1984.84-261,1,20799,david_a_epstein,,2468.752,2470.085,The doctor-patient privilege.
1984.84-261,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2477.088,2478.307,"Well, why can't he?"
1984.84-261,1,20799,david_a_epstein,,2478.307,2480.826,"Your Honor, all I can say--"
1984.84-261,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2480.826,2493.317,"As the law is now, what is privileged that the corporation only can waive, other than the lawyer-client privilege?"
1984.84-261,1,20799,david_a_epstein,,2493.317,2503.255,"--The only one which comes readily to mind where it exists, in some states, is the attorney... excuse me... the accountant-client privilege."
1984.84-261,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2506.824,2508.226,That's a variation of the attorney-client.
1984.84-261,1,20799,david_a_epstein,,2508.226,2508.859,"Yes, it is."
1984.84-261,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2508.859,2510.428,What else?
1984.84-261,1,20799,david_a_epstein,,2510.428,2512.045,For the corporation--
1984.84-261,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2512.045,2514.713,"Isn't it true, you just want to cut this little niche out?"
1984.84-261,1,20799,david_a_epstein,,2514.713,2516.896,"--Yes, but--"
1984.84-261,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2516.896,2526.502,"They can get all of the secrets they want, all of the secret formulas, everything else, but if a lawyer's attached to it you don't get it?"
1984.84-261,1,20799,david_a_epstein,,2526.502,2530.389,"--Well, it's not a matter of the lawyer being attached to it."
1984.84-261,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2530.389,2531.956,What else is it?
1984.84-261,1,20799,david_a_epstein,,2531.956,2533.441,What this case--
1984.84-261,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2533.441,2536.542,What makes it so different because a lawyer's attached to it?
1984.84-261,1,20799,david_a_epstein,,2536.542,2562.71,"--Because if the corporate personnel, whether it be corporate officers or, as it was in the Upjohn case, lower echelon corporate employees, are not free to confide in the attorneys, knowing that only when it's in the company's best interests, not the creditors' best interests but the company's best interests, that that's going to be disclosed, you're not going to have that kind of disclosure."
1984.84-261,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2564.244,2572.4,"But I thought that once you took a chapter 7 or any of the others, the trustee was acting in the company's interest."
1984.84-261,1,20799,david_a_epstein,,2572.4,2573.533,No.
1984.84-261,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2581.821,2582.607,Including?
1984.84-261,1,20799,david_a_epstein,,2582.607,2588.392,Including people whom management does not act in the best interest of.
1984.84-261,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2588.392,2590.511,But it also includes the management.
1984.84-261,1,20799,david_a_epstein,,2590.511,2606.223,"I would submit, Your Honor, if I may, that the principal driving force behind the trustee's decisionmaking, unlike pre-bankruptcy management's decisionmaking at all levels the trustee sides with the creditors."
1984.84-261,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2617.928,2621.898,You can get as many people to agree with you on that as disagree.
1984.84-261,1,20799,david_a_epstein,,2621.898,2625.184,"I only want nine of you to agree with me, Your Honor."
1984.84-261,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2626.0,2627.636,Five is enough.
1984.84-261,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2627.636,2628.652,Five.
1984.84-261,1,20799,david_a_epstein,,2630.004,2631.337,I'll settle for five.
1984.84-261,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2631.904,2645.264,"Well, isn't the normal result of a corporate chapter 7 liquidation the extinction of the corporation?"
1984.84-261,1,20799,david_a_epstein,,2645.264,2647.966,"Normally, but not necessarily, yes."
1984.84-261,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2647.966,2651.667,"Well, suppose that this was the normal case."
1984.84-261,1,20799,david_a_epstein,,2656.119,2657.571,"No, I don't think so."
1984.84-261,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2657.571,2658.321,But he used to.
1984.84-261,1,20799,david_a_epstein,,2658.321,2659.004,He used to.
1984.84-261,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2659.004,2666.091,"But he has the management of all of them, and his powers with respect to them are very much like under the old code?"
1984.84-261,1,20799,david_a_epstein,,2666.091,2666.658,That's correct.
1984.84-261,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2666.658,2678.482,"And the corporate management, the old corporate management, cannot interfere with those duties of the trustee."
1984.84-261,1,20799,david_a_epstein,,2686.321,2690.289,They may formally dissolve.
1984.84-261,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2691.475,2695.26,They certainly don't have anything to do in chapter 7.
1984.84-261,1,20799,david_a_epstein,,2695.26,2695.893,"--Well, no."
1984.84-261,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2705.033,2707.068,What happens to the privilege then?
1984.84-261,1,20799,david_a_epstein,,2707.068,2713.905,That's an excellent question.
1984.84-261,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2713.905,2734.652,"Well, I don't know why, if you know that the inevitable result in 99 percent of the cases is going to be liquidation and there's nothing that old management can do about it, or dissolution, what's so earth-shaking about saying the trustee can waive?"
1984.84-261,1,20799,david_a_epstein,,2740.972,2743.491,"Well, I don't know."
1984.84-261,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2767.256,2769.641,"Yes, but could the executor of an estate waive the privilege?"
1984.84-261,1,20799,david_a_epstein,,2769.641,2772.36,"--In some states yes, in others no."
1984.84-261,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2783.735,2787.437,"Well, that was going to be my next question: Who has the power to control litigation?"
1984.84-261,1,20799,david_a_epstein,,2787.437,2790.139,"--The trustee, for most purposes."
1984.84-261,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2790.139,2796.293,Isn't the waiver decision almost invariably made as an incident to tactical decisions in litigation?
1984.84-261,1,20799,david_a_epstein,,2800.178,2803.814,"Well, I think this case demonstrates that that's not always the case at all."
1984.84-261,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2894.556,2900.793,"How different is that from the takeover, new management type of thing?"
1984.84-261,1,20799,david_a_epstein,,2905.514,2908.816,"Oh, not friendly or buddy-buddy at all, that's correct."
1984.84-261,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2941.103,2945.424,"Well, new management can sue old management and frequently does."
1984.84-261,1,20799,david_a_epstein,,2945.424,2946.024,--Absolutely.
1984.84-261,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2946.024,2948.959,"And they can waive, in connection with that they can waive the privilege."
1984.84-261,1,20799,david_a_epstein,,2948.959,2950.893,"Well, they don't have to waive the privilege in connection with that."
1984.84-261,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2952.161,2963.719,"Well, I know, but if the lawyer refuses to testify he's going to be in trouble if management says, the current management says, please talk."
1984.84-261,1,20799,david_a_epstein,,2963.719,2964.819,Absolutely.
1984.84-261,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2964.819,2965.436,Well--
1984.84-261,1,20799,david_a_epstein,,2965.436,2976.86,"But Your Honor, the creditors can't do that, and that's the difference when the trustee comes in because, despite the paper fiduciary duty--"
1984.84-261,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2976.86,2981.264,--It depends on how delinquent the corporation might be to those creditors.
1984.84-261,1,20799,david_a_epstein,,2981.264,2984.216,"--Well, but the creditors are the ones who select the trustee."
1984.84-261,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3069.469,3072.354,"Briefing, you mean briefing in the district court?"
1984.84-261,1,20799,david_a_epstein,,3072.354,3076.056,"In the district court on the subpoena enforcement action, absolutely, Justice Rehnquist."
1984.84-261,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3161.243,3168.066,I don't assume that all corporations that have privilege with their lawyers are going bankrupt.
1984.84-261,1,20799,david_a_epstein,,3168.066,3173.47,"--Nor would I, Your Honor."
1984.84-261,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3174.886,3175.87,It sounded like it a minute ago.
1984.84-261,1,20799,david_a_epstein,,3175.87,3183.426,"--But when that happens, the knowledge that that can happen in the future is an insecurity."
1984.84-261,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3198.501,3202.053,Does that also apply to countries that are going bankrupt?
1984.84-261,1,20799,david_a_epstein,,3202.053,3204.569,"--Apparently not, Your Honor."
1984.84-261,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3308.505,3314.659,It sounds like you're concerned about the lawyers more than the client whose privilege it is.
1984.84-261,1,20799,david_a_epstein,,3325.915,3327.034,Absolutely.
1984.84-261,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3356.136,3360.671,Very well.
1984.84-261,2,17773,bruce_n_kuhlik,,3365.408,3366.308,I have nothing further.
1984.84-261,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3367.308,3367.641,Very well.
