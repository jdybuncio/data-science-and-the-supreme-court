1969.1089,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,36.482,"The nest case on for argument is Number 1089, Williams against Illinois."
1969.1089,0,40993,stanley_a_bass,,39.532,42.95,"Mr. Chief Justice, May it please the Court."
1969.1089,1,33198,james_r_thompson,,1600.41,1605.368,Mr. Chief Justice and May it please the Court.
1969.1089,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1823.505,1831.426,"How many states have got a statute, where the Illinois statute here, or as construed, the Illinois statute is construed?"
1969.1089,1,33198,james_r_thompson,,1831.426,1833.566,"At least 48, Your Honor."
1969.1089,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1833.566,1834.096,48?
1969.1089,1,33198,james_r_thompson,,1834.096,1836.361,At least 48.
1969.1089,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1836.361,1838.33,Which of the two do not have it?
1969.1089,1,33198,james_r_thompson,,1838.33,1864.893,"Well, New York has a statute where there is to be a hearing on the question of whether or not the indigent can pay the fine and if he cannot pay the fine, they go back and re-sentence and they don't follow exactly the same procedures in Illinois and I'm informed by counsel in the case that you are to here following this one that Maryland has recently changed its statute in light of the opinion below in the Schoonfield case."
1969.1089,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1871.575,1893.136,"Many of them, as I understand it, do not -- I have so -- do not have Illinois as the provision that Illinois has that if a man in fact is unable to work off his fine, he must be released and am I not right that many states to apply that sort of a release --"
1969.1089,1,33198,james_r_thompson,,1893.136,1900.691,Illinois' policy is more benign in this regard because Illinois does allow discharge where no work is available or where his physically unable to work.
1969.1089,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1900.691,1901.791,That's what I thought.
1969.1089,1,33198,james_r_thompson,,1904.347,1904.493,That's correct.
1969.1089,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1904.493,1905.718,Am I mistaken about that?
1969.1089,1,33198,james_r_thompson,,1905.718,1907.317,That's right.
1969.1089,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1937.685,1953.218,"But in this case, if the statute said one year, maximum of one year period and the judge thought that this was a horrible case, and the man said get more time."
1969.1089,1,33198,james_r_thompson,,1954.65,1955.891,He could not.
1969.1089,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1955.891,1967.648,"But if the statute says as it does here, the year and a $500.00 fine, the judge -- it's undisputed the judge knows this man is a pauper."
1969.1089,1,33198,james_r_thompson,,1967.648,1969.278,I think that's a fair inference to draw.
1969.1089,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1969.278,1971.662,Well he had his -- I assume he had probation.
1969.1089,1,33198,james_r_thompson,,1999.493,2001.764,"A judge could say that, Your Honor."
1969.1089,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2003.221,2007.241,"Well, I mean the judge couldn't give that man a hundred more days."
1969.1089,1,33198,james_r_thompson,,2007.241,2007.807,"That's correct, he could not --"
1969.1089,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2007.807,2009.228,No way under the sun.
1969.1089,1,33198,james_r_thompson,,2009.228,2017.007,That he could not give him an additional 101 days as punishment neither could he give the indigent man an additional 101 days as punishment.
1969.1089,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2017.007,2017.217,What he gives him?
1969.1089,1,33198,james_r_thompson,,2017.217,2019.08,He could simply impose a fine which --
1969.1089,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2019.08,2020.458,Which he knew he couldn't pay.
1969.1089,1,33198,james_r_thompson,,2020.458,2021.723,Which he knew he couldn't pay.
1969.1089,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2021.723,2023.833,And you don't think that's giving him a hundred days.
1969.1089,1,33198,james_r_thompson,,2023.833,2026.817,No sir.
1969.1089,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2038.406,2040.354,The difference being?
1969.1089,1,33198,james_r_thompson,,2040.354,2046.234,"The difference being that in one case, he is in there to give the state the value of his services."
1969.1089,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2046.234,2048.789,"But in both cases, he's in the same jail."
1969.1089,1,33198,james_r_thompson,,2048.789,2049.656,That's correct.
1969.1089,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2049.656,2050.826,In the same cell?
1969.1089,1,33198,james_r_thompson,,2050.826,2051.699,Yes sir.
1969.1089,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2051.699,2056.353,"But after the one year, he's serving something different."
1969.1089,1,33198,james_r_thompson,,2056.353,2058.897,"In terms of the theory of why the state has in there, that's correct."
1969.1089,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2058.897,2060.347,The theory?
1969.1089,1,33198,james_r_thompson,,2063.187,2066.873,"Well in terms of what happens to the man, obviously there's no difference between the two."
1969.1089,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2066.873,2071.224,Do you do different work after the one year?
1969.1089,1,33198,james_r_thompson,,2071.224,2071.904,Not necessarily.
1969.1089,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2071.904,2074.228,Why do you keep him overnight?
1969.1089,1,33198,james_r_thompson,,2074.228,2079.579,"Well, I suppose one reason we keep them overnight --"
1969.1089,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2079.579,2087.4,"If your theory isn't some substitute kind of punishment, but you're really just collecting your fine."
1969.1089,1,33198,james_r_thompson,,2087.4,2088.469,Yes.
1969.1089,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2088.469,2094.606,"If he doesn't work for night and day, I suppose, why don't you let him go when he isn't working?"
1969.1089,1,33198,james_r_thompson,,2094.606,2116.428,"I don't think I have nothing the record to support this but I don't think that the value of work off system insofar as it applies to a jail system, considering the people who are convicted and have no money to pay their fines who would stand very long if they were permitted to be released at night."
1969.1089,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2124.419,2135.252,"But Illinois, in taking this approach currently would keep a person as long as necessary to work off the fine at that rate."
1969.1089,1,33198,james_r_thompson,,2135.252,2135.391,No sir.
1969.1089,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2135.391,2138.109,Even though the -- what's the --
1969.1089,1,33198,james_r_thompson,,2138.109,2141.936,Illinois has a maximum limitation of six months no matter what the fine is.
1969.1089,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2148.615,2160.431,But he -- he will stay -- he can't stay in jail more than six months beyond the maximum term of imprisonment for the offense.
1969.1089,1,33198,james_r_thompson,,2160.431,2177.997,"No, no he can -- if he is given the maximum term of imprisonment for the offense, he would stay in jail beyond that maximum term only for so long as it takes to workout the fine for $85.00 a day or six months, whichever is greater, whichever is less."
1969.1089,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2177.997,2181.806,So he can stay in jail six months longer than the maximum term of --
1969.1089,1,33198,james_r_thompson,,2181.806,2182.143,Yes sir.
1969.1089,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2182.143,2182.823,-- imprisonment.
1969.1089,1,33198,james_r_thompson,,2182.823,2187.029,"That's correct, that right."
1969.1089,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2192.984,2198.144,"Before you get to that counsel, how far back is the $5.00 a day measure go?"
1969.1089,1,33198,james_r_thompson,,2198.144,2198.887,I think that --
1969.1089,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2198.887,2200.53,Can you go over from an old statute?
1969.1089,1,33198,james_r_thompson,,2200.53,2206.402,"No sir, back in the early 1900s, the rate was $1.50 a day."
1969.1089,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2235.654,2238.69,Do you charge him for his board room?
1969.1089,1,33198,james_r_thompson,,2238.69,2256.9,"Not under the work off system as such, I think it's probably reflected in the value of his labor, in other words, we're not saying your labor is only worth $5.00 a day to as we're probably really saying to him that your labor is worth at least $11.00 a day to us because it costs about $6.13 to keep him."
1969.1089,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2256.9,2262.605,When he's serving his year.
1969.1089,1,33198,james_r_thompson,,2262.605,2263.67,Yes.
1969.1089,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2263.67,2266.605,"When he's serving his initial year, you got a year here?"
1969.1089,1,33198,james_r_thompson,,2266.605,2269.09,That's correct.
1969.1089,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2269.09,2270.733,Did it work?
1969.1089,1,33198,james_r_thompson,,2270.733,2277.426,I think his record in the appendix reflects that he was assigned to the tailor shop or the kitchen so I presume he worked.
1969.1089,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2277.426,2279.414,Which is the same as he was assigned after that?
1969.1089,1,33198,james_r_thompson,,2279.414,2281.73,I presume that's correct.
1969.1089,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2281.73,2285.569,Why doesn't he get credit on his fine for that work?
1969.1089,1,33198,james_r_thompson,,2285.569,2292.486,"Well, I suppose on the theory that it's a sort of consecutive sentence idea."
1969.1089,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2298.867,2305.92,"Well, what would have to go -- while he's serving his year, assume he refused to work?"
1969.1089,1,33198,james_r_thompson,,2305.92,2308.722,During the first year?
1969.1089,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2328.232,2329.975,But why?
1969.1089,1,33198,james_r_thompson,,2340.157,2342.497,Yes it is.
1969.1089,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2358.872,2362.215,Do you pay people for working in your --
1969.1089,1,33198,james_r_thompson,,2362.215,2374.061,There are some projects in the city jail which prisoners may obtain a small amount of paid form even though they're not working out fine.
1969.1089,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2451.921,2459.791,They in fact show an indigent is forced to serve a lot of time that a man who's not an indigent would not have to serve?
1969.1089,1,33198,james_r_thompson,,2459.791,2474.78,"Well, a man who was an indigent must work off his fine in the same jail that men go to who are sentenced."
1969.1089,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2474.78,2480.975,Same jail but you don't have to work off his fine at the same jail that the millionaire would have to work it.
1969.1089,1,33198,james_r_thompson,,2480.975,2482.992,"As a millionaire, who pays his fine, that's correct."
1969.1089,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2482.992,2486.15,"Well, that's the difference practically speaking."
1969.1089,1,33198,james_r_thompson,,2486.15,2486.361,That's true.
1969.1089,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2486.361,2487.954,And that's your real issue.
1969.1089,1,33198,james_r_thompson,,2487.954,2488.489,That's true.
1969.1089,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2583.926,2588.153,What is Illinois' collected fines usually?
1969.1089,1,33198,james_r_thompson,,2588.153,2602.318,"I'm not certain Your Honor but it's certainly in the high millions of dollars when you count in the fines collected by the Courts which handle cases in which the fine is the only punishment, including traffic offenses."
1969.1089,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2627.191,2632.498,"Mr. Thompson, I assume that the jails are overcrowded in Illinois lately than place else."
1969.1089,1,33198,james_r_thompson,,2632.498,2634.199,"Not necessarily, Mr. Justice Marshall."
1969.1089,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2634.199,2634.734,Really?
1969.1089,1,33198,james_r_thompson,,2634.734,2643.86,It adds and flows -- I was out to the Bridewell Jail just a few weeks ago and they are not overcrowded in the Bridewell.
1969.1089,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2647.56,2650.283,"You mean, the need as to workers?"
1969.1089,1,33198,james_r_thompson,,2650.283,2656.626,"No, but crime doesn't follow a steady pace."
1969.1089,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2656.626,2674.301,"Do you think that the statute in Illinois was passed putting a head tax on everybody of $100.00 a year and all who didn't pay it went to jail, would be valid?"
1969.1089,1,33198,james_r_thompson,,2674.301,2689.549,"Well, I think the State of Illinois would be entitled to impose a tax, a revenue collecting tax on all of its citizens and to provide some means for alternative collection if the man failed to pay it."
1969.1089,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2689.549,2690.825,The man that couldn't pay it?
1969.1089,1,33198,james_r_thompson,,2696.542,2705.25,"We could extract the value of his labor and services to the state and if necessary, to accomplish that objective --"
1969.1089,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2705.25,2710.939,Do you think that's true in the year of 1970 to put a man in jail because he doesn't have money?
1969.1089,1,33198,james_r_thompson,,2710.939,2716.161,"Well, I would draw a distinction, your honor between your hypothetical in my case for this reason."
1969.1089,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2743.2,2753.818,"What's the difference between Willie who doesn't have $1.75, paying the tax or paying the fine?"
1969.1089,1,33198,james_r_thompson,,2753.818,2756.238,"Well, the difference is simply I think that the state --"
1969.1089,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2756.238,2760.36,"The state doesn't need the money that he has, is that correct?"
1969.1089,1,33198,james_r_thompson,,2760.36,2764.609,"Well, I think on the broad scheme -- on the broad scale, you could certainly say that they do."
1969.1089,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2764.609,2772.182,"Well, didn't the judge, when he sentenced this man know that he wasn't getting a single dollar out of Willie?"
1969.1089,1,33198,james_r_thompson,,2772.182,2773.153,"Well, I'm sure --"
1969.1089,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2773.153,2773.992,Didn't he?
1969.1089,1,33198,james_r_thompson,,2773.992,2777.833,"I'm sure he presumed that Willie Williams is not going to come up with $500.00 in cash, that's right."
1969.1089,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2777.833,2784.157,"All he wanted was to extend the one year sentence, that's all he was interested in doing."
1969.1089,1,33198,james_r_thompson,,2784.157,2788.366,I don't think that that is necessarily a motive which you can ascribe to the judge.
1969.1089,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2788.366,2789.996,Well can you give me any other one?
1969.1089,1,33198,james_r_thompson,,2789.996,2801.95,"Yes, I think he was saying that the circumstances of Williams' crime, whatever they were, and the record does not show it, warranted the maximum penalty provided for by law."
1969.1089,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2801.95,2807.864,Which is a hundred -- so far as jail was concerned was a hundred -- one year.
1969.1089,1,33198,james_r_thompson,,2807.864,2811.349,"That's correct and then so far as the fine is concerned, the maximum fine."
1969.1089,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2811.349,2816.844,"So, he sentenced him to one year and 100 days."
1969.1089,1,33198,james_r_thompson,,2816.844,2819.081,"That is the net result of the sentence, that's correct."
1969.1089,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2819.081,2821.244,And you don't see anything wrong?
1969.1089,1,33198,james_r_thompson,,2821.244,2822.828,"No sir, I don't."
1969.1089,2,40993,stanley_a_bass,,3567.865,3570.25,"I don't think I will use that up, Your Honor."
1969.1089,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3570.25,3579.489,"What do you think about this last thing that if you seem to have some spare time, do you think there's a so-called counter productive possibility or potential here?"
1969.1089,2,40993,stanley_a_bass,,3579.489,3580.582,"I don't think so, Your Honor."
1969.1089,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3592.921,3603.174,"Well, I wasn't thinking so much of traffic court as the misdemeanor court dealing with behavior not as serious as the behavior involved in this case."
1969.1089,2,40993,stanley_a_bass,,3603.174,3606.161,I think we're entitled to trust the trial judges' discretion.
1969.1089,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3620.02,3630.863,The matter of your view then I take it is that there is no potential for the -- what I've characterized as counterproductive results.
1969.1089,2,40993,stanley_a_bass,,3630.863,3633.854,The potential is there but I think we have to test the Courts.
1969.1089,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3681.952,3706.03,"Well, Mr. Bass, what would you think of an overt system by state or a criminal court system which says where it's determined after investigation that a defendant cannot pay a fine, we just won't impose a fine but we will impose an alternative, what we think is some equivalent jail sentence."
1969.1089,2,40993,stanley_a_bass,,3706.03,3709.615,"That's not an equivalent, that's the problem in this case."
1969.1089,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3768.626,3780.858,(Inaudible)
1969.1089,2,40993,stanley_a_bass,,3780.858,3782.193,"Well, we don't have those figures."
1969.1089,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3804.118,3816.663,I suppose that it will be hard to contain that (Inaudible).
1969.1089,2,40993,stanley_a_bass,,3816.663,3826.988,"Well, to the extent to which the offense is punishable by fine only, we would be dealing with the situation of poor people being subjected to a sanction different from the sanction as to rich people."
1969.1089,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3826.988,3832.823,"So, now you would say that if we agree with you in this case, we agree to the same (Inaudible)?"
1969.1089,2,40993,stanley_a_bass,,3832.823,3836.35,"Well, you don't have to reach that in this case, but we would submit --"
1969.1089,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3836.35,3838.009,"But we take that step, don't we?"
1969.1089,2,40993,stanley_a_bass,,3838.009,3851.803,"We would submit that if the judge determines that -- well, first of all, if the offense is serious enough to warrant incarceration of an individual would seem to underlie a lot of these, letting an indigence to get away with violating the law with impunity."
1969.1089,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3867.812,3873.725,You've almost -- you've almost gone around the circle now on my counterproductive proposition.
1969.1089,2,40993,stanley_a_bass,,3889.943,3910.2,"Well, it's possible that the legislature has always had the discretion to determine what penalties are appropriate for what offenses but we're talking about this situation is an automatic system that puts people in jail without any inquiry whatsoever as to whether or not the money, that the state says is the appropriate sanction, the fine, can be satisfied in the means less onerous."
1969.1089,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3910.2,3912.866,"Well, the legislature has done this, isn't it?"
1969.1089,2,40993,stanley_a_bass,,3918.571,3922.859,"The legislature has not, according to the construction put on the statute by the Illinois Supreme Court."
1969.1089,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3927.318,3943.899,"The legislature has proved, as I understood that this case is about that the Illinois legislature has said that if a person is convicted and he cannot pay his fine, he can be put in jail instead."
1969.1089,2,40993,stanley_a_bass,,3943.899,3945.259,Well that's what they've said.
1969.1089,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3945.259,3948.694,"That's what the case is about and that's -- the legislature has done this, isn't it?"
1969.1089,2,40993,stanley_a_bass,,3948.694,3954.304,"Well, but our point is that the legislature may unconstitutionally do that."
1969.1089,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3954.304,3969.33,"But it may, according to you submission, as I understand it, say that the punishment for any offense can be a fine up to $5.00 or imprisonment up to five days, isn't it?"
1969.1089,2,40993,stanley_a_bass,,3969.33,3975.79,"The legislature may prescribe maximum penalties, yes."
1969.1089,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3975.79,3978.468,"Thank you Mr. Bass, thank you Mr. Thompson."
