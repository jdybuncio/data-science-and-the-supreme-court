1997.120_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,5.39,"We'll hear argument now in Number 120 Original, New Jersey v. New York."
1997.120_orig,0,33714,joseph_l_yannotti,,6.826,14.885,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1997.120_orig,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,61.351,73.534,"My only observation about that, and it helps your case, I think, I was a little puzzled that the Special Master did not pay more of a... put more weight on the Holmes' opinion in Central--"
1997.120_orig,0,33714,joseph_l_yannotti,,73.534,76.937,"Well, we certainly did place a great deal of weight on the Holmes' opinion and we do think--"
1997.120_orig,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,76.937,82.764,--The Special Master didn't seem to think... it seems to me it... on the sovereignty issue that if New York is right we have to overrule that.
1997.120_orig,0,33714,joseph_l_yannotti,,82.764,87.575,"--Well, they certainly did make that argument below before the Special Master."
1997.120_orig,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,97.617,101.46,"We would have to overrule it were New York to have sovereignty, would we not?"
1997.120_orig,0,33714,joseph_l_yannotti,,101.46,102.866,"--Yes, I think so, Your Honor."
1997.120_orig,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,115.813,124.122,"Now, as to the meaning of the jurisdiction that remains, Holmes' opinion is not quite clear, and I think that probably needs further elaboration."
1997.120_orig,0,33714,joseph_l_yannotti,,124.122,125.465,Under Article III?
1997.120_orig,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,125.465,126.153,Yes.
1997.120_orig,0,33714,joseph_l_yannotti,,126.153,126.778,"Yes, well--"
1997.120_orig,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,126.778,133.135,"Well, or whether there is a difference in Article III jurisdiction or Article II jurisdiction is not clear from Central Railroad."
1997.120_orig,0,33714,joseph_l_yannotti,,133.135,167.37,"--Well, Justice... Justice Holmes indicated in the Central Railroad case that under Article II, New York had retained its present jurisdiction of and over Ellis Island, which he interpreted to mean was the States intended to preserve the status quo ante, and the status quo that existed in 1834 was a situation where Ellis Island was on the New Jersey side of the boundary, it was a 2-3/4 acres of fast land to mean high water, it was owned by the Federal Government, who had acquired it in 1808 from the State of New York, and it was utilized as a military fort."
1997.120_orig,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,203.809,222.098,"Mr. Yannotti, at least as to the land that was once submerged and has now been filled in, there was a significant argument made that Holmes was wrong, at least to the extent that he defined exclusive rights of property to mean sovereignty."
1997.120_orig,0,33714,joseph_l_yannotti,,222.098,228.861,"--Well, I respectfully argue that Holmes was not wrong, and that he reached the correct conclusion."
1997.120_orig,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,250.962,255.1,"Well, that part I understand, the equation of boundary with sovereignty."
1997.120_orig,0,33714,joseph_l_yannotti,,255.1,255.288,--Yes.
1997.120_orig,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,255.288,259.271,But Holmes also said something about exclusive right of property.
1997.120_orig,0,33714,joseph_l_yannotti,,259.271,260.488,Yes.
1997.120_orig,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,260.488,268.455,"And you know the three-way division that was offered in some of the briefs, of the property right and the public access right and the governing right."
1997.120_orig,0,33714,joseph_l_yannotti,,268.455,291.523,"The argument was made that all New Jersey had was the sovereign right of property, and he found that that actually supported the notion that New Jersey was sovereign in this territory, and he said that the ownership of submerged land was indicative of the division of sovereign territory and actually furthered and supported the notion that this was a line not only of territory but of jurisdiction and sovereignty, so I think the... what Justice Holmes said--"
1997.120_orig,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,291.523,295.567,So property means jurisdiction and exclusive jurisdiction doesn't mean exclusive jurisdiction.
1997.120_orig,0,33714,joseph_l_yannotti,,295.567,297.364,--Well--
1997.120_orig,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,297.364,306.127,Is... would there have been a clearer way to say that one of the States had governing authority--
1997.120_orig,0,33714,joseph_l_yannotti,,306.127,306.611,"--Well, I think it--"
1997.120_orig,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,306.611,309.158,"--than to use the phrase, exclusive jurisdiction?"
1997.120_orig,0,33714,joseph_l_yannotti,,309.158,326.743,"--The... I think it's important to focus also, not only on that but also on the notion exclusive jurisdiction over the waters, and I think that is the key element of that Article III, because New Jersey had recognized that New York had exclusive jurisdiction, but it was limited."
1997.120_orig,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,338.724,339.254,"Well, it was control of the waters."
1997.120_orig,0,33714,joseph_l_yannotti,,341.816,342.706,--That's correct.
1997.120_orig,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,342.706,363.776,"And isn't there a fair argument to be made that when the submerged lands become in effect the basis for filled land, in place of what had been water subject to New York's jurisdiction, that that same territory now newly created above the ground becomes subject to the same exclusive jurisdiction?"
1997.120_orig,0,33714,joseph_l_yannotti,,363.776,397.262,"Well, our argument is that that is not the case, and we rely in that regard upon, again, that 1870 decision of the New York Court of Appeals, which said that although there was in Article III a reference to jurisdiction over the submerged lands, that was merely subordinate to and in furtherance of the power over the waters, and it was... the New York Court of Appeals gave it a very limited reading in that case, and in fact in the 1908 decision by Justice Holmes the Court specifically upheld the taxation of submerged lands--"
1997.120_orig,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,397.262,398.479,"Yes, but how could it have no meaning?"
1997.120_orig,0,33714,joseph_l_yannotti,,409.335,409.834,--Yes.
1997.120_orig,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,409.834,410.944,Because of Article I.
1997.120_orig,0,33714,joseph_l_yannotti,,416.036,417.161,Our view of--
1997.120_orig,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,417.161,425.313,"--given by Article III, and is... you want an injunction, which injunction says New York can do nothing."
1997.120_orig,0,33714,joseph_l_yannotti,,425.313,425.907,--Yes.
1997.120_orig,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,425.907,426.157,All right.
1997.120_orig,0,33714,joseph_l_yannotti,,443.868,453.926,"Well, again I think the... we go back to the decision of the New York Court of Appeals in 1870, and what the court said was that this was a jurisdiction over navigation."
1997.120_orig,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,453.926,454.832,"All right, so--"
1997.120_orig,0,33714,joseph_l_yannotti,,454.832,468.717,"And once the waters were filled there was no basis upon which to exercise jurisdiction over ships and vessels on the water, that the jurisdiction essentially... there was no basis upon which to exercise that jurisdiction when the land was filled."
1997.120_orig,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,468.717,473.012,"--In other words, exclusive jurisdiction doesn't mean that."
1997.120_orig,0,33714,joseph_l_yannotti,,476.792,480.79,"It does mean exclusive related to ships, related to navigation."
1997.120_orig,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,480.79,496.691,"--So suppose there is a ship, a ferry boat tied up at the pier that now is in New Jersey's sovereign territory next to that immigration house, all right."
1997.120_orig,0,33714,joseph_l_yannotti,,499.048,504.516,"That's specifically addressed in Article III, where New York's jurisdiction is recognized, at least to the extent--"
1997.120_orig,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,504.516,504.656,Fine.
1997.120_orig,0,33714,joseph_l_yannotti,,516.791,530.442,"--Well, I think... again, my point is that this is a jurisdiction as it relates to vessels, and if they're tied to a port facility on the New Jersey side that creates an entirely different situation than to have filled land, because they cannot--"
1997.120_orig,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,530.442,533.534,So what sort of injunction... this is what's confusing me.
1997.120_orig,0,33714,joseph_l_yannotti,,555.244,560.835,"--That is not... again, the request that we sought relates to exercise of jurisdiction on the land."
1997.120_orig,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,573.003,581.172,And I didn't find in the Special Master's report a discussion of what exclusive jurisdiction meant.
1997.120_orig,0,33714,joseph_l_yannotti,,596.79,597.696,"Well, again it relates to the--"
1997.120_orig,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,597.696,598.056,Related to the land.
1997.120_orig,0,33714,joseph_l_yannotti,,598.056,615.518,"--It relates to the subject matter of that jurisdiction and as it's been interpreted by the courts, that jurisdiction relates to... the subject matter is navigation, pertains to vessels while they are on the waters, and that is the... that is the limit there of the jurisdiction."
1997.120_orig,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,615.518,633.354,"Well, the master touched that in part at page 67, when he said interpreting exclusive jurisdiction in Article Third to mean police or legal jurisdiction as the only reading of Article III that prevents such serious anomalies, but he... and he... but he addressed it no further than that."
1997.120_orig,0,33714,joseph_l_yannotti,,634.04,634.337,Right.
1997.120_orig,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,656.626,676.601,"--Mr. Yannotti, I'm a little curious as to why New Jersey did not make the argument which seems to me available that the Compact only gives New York exclusive jurisdiction over lands covered by the Hudson, and these lands are not any more covered by the Hudson."
1997.120_orig,0,33714,joseph_l_yannotti,,682.208,684.005,"Well, I think that essentially what--"
1997.120_orig,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,684.005,684.301,--you'd be home free.
1997.120_orig,0,33714,joseph_l_yannotti,,684.301,685.942,--Essentially what we have been saying.
1997.120_orig,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,697.687,699.264,I did not understand you as having made that argument.
1997.120_orig,0,33714,joseph_l_yannotti,,699.264,711.916,"--Well, that has been our point, and I do believe we have that in our brief, but it is our argument that once the lands were filled, that there is no basis upon which New York may exercise that jurisdiction under Article III."
1997.120_orig,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,758.427,759.583,One point on jurisdiction.
1997.120_orig,0,33714,joseph_l_yannotti,,768.846,773.484,"--Well, in order to determine the present juris--"
1997.120_orig,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,773.484,776.077,"Because if so that's a strange use of words, as Justice Scalia pointed out."
1997.120_orig,0,33714,joseph_l_yannotti,,777.905,792.461,"--Well, present jurisdiction, really in order to ascertain precisely the meaning of that you have to go back to the situation as it existed in 1834 to determine what was the jurisdiction, and at that time New York had virtually no jurisdiction."
1997.120_orig,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,912.428,924.579,"Mr. Yannotti, are you going to talk about the recommendation of the master that the actual territorial boundary he proposes be adjusted to take care of certain buildings and improvements?"
1997.120_orig,0,33714,joseph_l_yannotti,,924.579,925.298,"Yes, I do, Your Honor."
1997.120_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,951.959,954.27,What's North and what's South on this map?
1997.120_orig,0,33714,joseph_l_yannotti,,954.27,960.221,"--North would be to the right, West would be to the top of that map."
1997.120_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,960.221,960.689,Thank you.
1997.120_orig,0,33714,joseph_l_yannotti,,960.689,972.466,"And the Special Master, of course, has completely departed from the line, the mean high water line from 1834, which is what New Jersey contends is the line which should be employed."
1997.120_orig,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1018.369,1019.775,Do you think we have any choice at all?
1997.120_orig,0,33714,joseph_l_yannotti,,1021.336,1023.836,"Well, I think--"
1997.120_orig,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1023.836,1026.022,Isn't it the case... I thought your position would be that we must.
1997.120_orig,0,33714,joseph_l_yannotti,,1026.022,1027.396,"--Yes, it is, Your Honor."
1997.120_orig,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1027.396,1029.428,We must because of what?
1997.120_orig,0,33714,joseph_l_yannotti,,1029.428,1034.613,"We must... you must because that is the essential role of the Court in this case, to define the boundary."
1997.120_orig,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1038.157,1042.797,"Well, isn't it also because we're bound by an act of Congress?"
1997.120_orig,0,33714,joseph_l_yannotti,,1042.797,1043.827,"--Yes, they said that."
1997.120_orig,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1076.611,1093.51,May I ask you once more to clarify... I'm still fuzzy about it... what authority New York... what authority does New York have and enjoy... those are the words of Article Third... as a result of that grant of exclusive jurisdiction?
1997.120_orig,0,33714,joseph_l_yannotti,,1093.51,1109.786,"It has jurisdiction... a navigational jurisdiction over the waters, and it would pertain to vessels, ships, and passengers as they are on those waters in New York Bay and the Hudson River in this particular area."
1997.120_orig,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1109.786,1117.61,"So with respect to the ferry going back and forth to Ellis Island, New York has control of that, is that--"
1997.120_orig,0,33714,joseph_l_yannotti,,1117.61,1117.907,"Well, yes."
1997.120_orig,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1124.249,1124.997,--What's some measure?
1997.120_orig,0,33714,joseph_l_yannotti,,1124.997,1126.466,Exclusive jurisdiction.
1997.120_orig,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1126.466,1128.449,Which sounds to me like only.
1997.120_orig,0,33714,joseph_l_yannotti,,1128.449,1129.699,"Well, yes."
1997.120_orig,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1148.988,1154.892,"Oh, I assume they can exercise control to the maximum extent that any State can ever exercise controls."
1997.120_orig,0,33714,joseph_l_yannotti,,1154.892,1157.017,Within the subject matter limitation.
1997.120_orig,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1157.017,1158.641,What was the submerged land?
1997.120_orig,0,33714,joseph_l_yannotti,,1163.857,1165.981,It relates also to navigation.
1997.120_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1191.596,1192.876,"Thank you, Mr. Yannotti."
1997.120_orig,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1195.813,1206.105,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1997.120_orig,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1350.689,1354.843,Do you think our position would be altered if they had asked us to redraw the boundary?
1997.120_orig,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1354.843,1360.045,"--If they had, then I think you'd be faced squarely with the question of whether you have that power or not, and we think that--"
1997.120_orig,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1360.045,1360.686,"Oh, I see."
1997.120_orig,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1361.84,1362.324,--you do not.
1997.120_orig,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1362.324,1363.028,--That's your point.
1997.120_orig,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1366.37,1368.806,"No, that's not, but they have not even asked in this case."
1997.120_orig,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1369.447,1383.643,"I agree with Justice... what difference does it make, Mr. Minear, at this point in the litigation, if we were to say that we reject the master's drawing of the boundary line because neither party ever asked for it?"
1997.120_orig,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1389.375,1395.592,"Well, that might be the... that might be the case, but we think that ultimately the Court lacks the power to draw that boundary in any event--"
1997.120_orig,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1395.592,1398.747,Then it really doesn't make any difference whether they asked for it or not.
1997.120_orig,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1398.747,1407.337,"--Ultimately it does not, but we do think it's significant that neither party asked for it, and this Court does not often grant relief that neither party requested."
1997.120_orig,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1437.528,1448.461,"But that case involved a variable boundary, a boundary that could be here today and some place else tomorrow, as opposed to what the Special Master has done here."
1997.120_orig,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1455.662,1466.797,"That's correct, but in this case what we're saying is the historic boundary should be fixed by the original contours of the island, because that's what Congress and the parties intended by virtue of the Compact of 1834."
1997.120_orig,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1466.797,1472.123,I'm just suggesting that there's a little space between the Washington v. Oregon case and this one.
1997.120_orig,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1472.123,1488.993,"That might be, but we think ultimately the general principle at stake in Washington v. Oregon does control here, which is that this Court should respect the power of the political branches to determine boundaries and draw those boundaries and, in fact, the Constitution provides for adjustments of boundaries if need be."
1997.120_orig,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1504.891,1507.733,How do you do this little... maybe it's just a minor... I don't know.
1997.120_orig,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1517.387,1517.996,That's correct.
1997.120_orig,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1517.996,1527.462,"Assuming that right, what do we do about paragraph 4, where they ask for an injunction that no New York law at all can be enforced on the filled land?"
1997.120_orig,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1527.462,1527.977,I think--
1997.120_orig,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1527.977,1536.257,That's what was disturbing me because of the concern that I had that exclusive jurisdiction might mean something in respect to that filled land.
1997.120_orig,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1536.257,1552.686,"--I think that takes us back to the suggestion that the United States made at the point when the complaint was first filed in this case and the Court asked for our views on this matter, and at that point we explained that there might be a number of issues that can only be resolved in a specific factual context, and so those issues are simply not ripe at this point."
1997.120_orig,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1553.124,1555.061,"So what are we supposed to do, then, about that?"
1997.120_orig,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1555.061,1568.087,"--We think all the Court can do at this point, all the Court should do at this point is draw the... describe where the historic boundary is, and just simply indicate that any other dispute that might arise can be handled by the parties seeking further relief, as the Court has decreed."

1997.120_orig,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1575.865,1576.756,I'm not sure about--
1997.120_orig,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1576.756,1593.092,"--My recollection might be... might not be completely accurate, but I'm not sure the master specifically addressed that question, but he... his proposed decree does leave it open to the parties to seek further relief at the foot of the decree, which is common in the case of original actions and original decrees."
1997.120_orig,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1593.092,1609.289,"--I can't think of an original action since I've been here in which the issue is not who owns the land but where one State is simply suing, claiming that the other State has no jurisdiction over a particular action over a particular thing."
1997.120_orig,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1618.318,1624.065,"That is correct, and that's... this case is unusual insofar as the United States owns title to all of the land in question here."
1997.120_orig,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1624.065,1643.604,"I understand, but you're saying we don't have to decide that question now because the States can come back later when there is more factual context to it, and I'm not entirely sure they can come back later to present us the question of which State has jurisdiction."
1997.120_orig,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1644.292,1647.134,"Well, it's likely that the issue could arise between a State and a private party."
1997.120_orig,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1647.134,1647.757,--Right.
1997.120_orig,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1647.757,1653.163,"But ultimately the issue would ultimately return to this Court, and the Court would make a resolution of law in that context."

1997.120_orig,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1693.256,1698.753,"Oh, there are some modest consequences with regard to certain activity, such as the collection of tax revenues and the like."
1997.120_orig,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1710.701,1711.296,For example?
1997.120_orig,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1711.296,1714.606,Sales taxes from concessions on the island would be one example.
1997.120_orig,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1749.452,1752.263,Is the jurisdiction of the United States limited to certain purposes?
1997.120_orig,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1757.853,1761.759,"--Well, our perspective on the jurisdiction on the island is as follows."
1997.120_orig,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1771.052,1776.941,"Now, when you say exclusive, do you mean exclusive jurisdiction as defined in Article III of the Compact, or some other meaning of exclusive jurisdiction?"
1997.120_orig,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1776.941,1777.284,--No.
1997.120_orig,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1778.815,1780.518,Really exclusive jurisdiction.
1997.120_orig,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1781.891,1791.654,"--We actually are referring to the exclusive jurisdiction as it's described in the interdepartmental study on legislative jurisdiction in 1957, which deals with this issue quite comprehensively."

1997.120_orig,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1854.768,1858.876,"Well, Article II doesn't say what you just said in so many words, certainly."
1997.120_orig,2,21541,daniel_smirlock,,1858.876,1870.684,"--No, but the parties both interpret it that way as to, there is no dispute that the grant to New York of jurisdiction over Ellis Island was in the nature of a grant of sovereignty."
1997.120_orig,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1883.241,1883.725,Well--
1997.120_orig,2,21541,daniel_smirlock,,1883.725,1887.442,--jurisdiction in Article Second of the Compact means sovereignty.
1997.120_orig,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1887.442,1895.283,"--In other words, New Jersey did not concede that prescriptive rights had given New York that added jurisdiction."
1997.120_orig,2,21541,daniel_smirlock,,1895.283,1895.861,I--
1997.120_orig,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1895.861,1902.217,"In other words, prescriptive rights played no part in New York's jurisdiction over the original island."
1997.120_orig,2,21541,daniel_smirlock,,1902.217,1902.998,"--Correct, Your Honor."
1997.120_orig,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1916.836,1920.85,"Well, but it doesn't say sovereignty in Article Second."
1997.120_orig,2,21541,daniel_smirlock,,1920.85,1940.545,"It doesn't, but in fact that's how it's been interpreted, and that's... and there is no disagreement that that is what jurisdiction in that article means, and the only question is whether that jurisdiction which is of the nature of sovereignty is sufficient to encompass the landfilled portions of the island that got added after 1834."
1997.120_orig,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1940.545,1955.414,"I find it interesting that that provision also uses the magic words, exclusive jurisdiction, which later turn up in Article III, and where they're used in Article Second they quite clearly mean sovereignty, don't they?"

1997.120_orig,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1956.586,1961.287,And shall also retain exclusive jurisdiction over the other islands--
1997.120_orig,2,21541,daniel_smirlock,,1961.287,1980.655,"--Yes, and the reason that there's a distinction, by the way, between the retention of jurisdiction as to Bedloe's and Ellis Island and the exclusive jurisdiction without qualification over the other islands of the bay, which is all the islands, is that Bedloe's and Ellis have had a measure of jurisdiction over them ceded to the United States, and the Special Master made that clear."
1997.120_orig,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2026.183,2028.465,--May I interrupt you with just one question that puzzles me.
1997.120_orig,2,21541,daniel_smirlock,,2031.119,2032.133,"--No, you can't, Your Honor."
1997.120_orig,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2032.133,2048.969,"The boundary is in the middle of the river, and now the portion of the river between the middle and the shore of New Jersey has exclusive jurisdiction in New York under Article Third, but how can that be... how can you say there's a boundary there if exclusive jurisdiction in Article Third means what you say it does?"

1997.120_orig,2,21541,daniel_smirlock,,2075.882,2079.599,"Would, without Article Second, but as it's agreed, Article Second gave them to New York."
1997.120_orig,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2113.508,2116.694,"--Or anchoring buoys, I suppose--"
1997.120_orig,2,21541,daniel_smirlock,,2116.694,2117.27,Probably.
1997.120_orig,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2117.66,2120.488,--would be necessary if you're going to maintain navigation.
1997.120_orig,2,21541,daniel_smirlock,,2120.488,2125.33,"--That sort of thing, and it refers both to underwater land and to the waters in the harbor."
1997.120_orig,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2147.478,2164.455,"Well, New Jersey's... as I understand it, New Jersey's answer to that argument is that New York through its courts, it already held that the whole point of that is simply in effect a navigational commercial jurisdiction, and when something was not on or moving over the water, that was the end of it."
1997.120_orig,2,21541,daniel_smirlock,,2166.001,2174.904,"--Conceding that arguendo... that's Article III... we still have to deal, we think dispositively, with Article II, because this case isn't about Article III, really."

1997.120_orig,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2255.027,2257.87,"--Now, you made this argument to the Special Master, I take it."
1997.120_orig,2,21541,daniel_smirlock,,2257.87,2258.495,"Yes, Your Honor."
1997.120_orig,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2258.495,2261.4,"And he rejected it, in effect."
1997.120_orig,2,21541,daniel_smirlock,,2261.4,2261.697,He did.
1997.120_orig,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2261.697,2265.148,And wherein do you disagree with his rejection?
1997.120_orig,2,21541,daniel_smirlock,,2265.148,2273.536,"I disagree with it because he said the evidence of landfill... that landfill was used... well, he agreed, frankly, with us that landfill had been added to Ellis Island."
1997.120_orig,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2283.718,2284.859,So--
1997.120_orig,2,21541,daniel_smirlock,,2299.369,2301.025,"Well, there are two answers to that."
1997.120_orig,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2354.378,2359.845,Why do you say that if the island is extended too far toward New Jersey it's New Jersey's?
1997.120_orig,2,21541,daniel_smirlock,,2359.845,2361.235,--Because they're islands.
1997.120_orig,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2372.323,2377.103,"Well, but you... so far as Ellis Island, it's still an island until it touches the New Jersey shore."
1997.120_orig,2,21541,daniel_smirlock,,2377.103,2378.696,"--Very much so, and that's why we still think it's New York."
1997.120_orig,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2378.696,2386.99,"So it could extend over, all the way, right to the New Jersey shore, and even though it ultimately connected, the boundary then would be the New Jersey shore."
1997.120_orig,2,21541,daniel_smirlock,,2386.99,2387.427,Yes.
1997.120_orig,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2388.74,2390.52,That isn't much of a check and balance.
1997.120_orig,2,21541,daniel_smirlock,,2390.77,2391.411,"--Well, wait a second."
1997.120_orig,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2399.939,2403.344,"But that's true of any kind of fill you put in, anybody."
1997.120_orig,2,21541,daniel_smirlock,,2403.344,2406.14,"--Well, that's true, but that was a check that New Jersey could apply."
1997.120_orig,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2408.232,2410.217,"Wait, couldn't New York condemn it?"
1997.120_orig,2,21541,daniel_smirlock,,2410.217,2413.183,"Frankly, I don't see how New York could condemn it."
1997.120_orig,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2413.183,2413.402,Why?
1997.120_orig,2,21541,daniel_smirlock,,2413.402,2416.635,"Because the subaqueous land, insofar as it was subaqueous--"
1997.120_orig,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2416.635,2417.9,You say New Jersey just had a property right--
1997.120_orig,2,21541,daniel_smirlock,,2417.9,2418.322,"--No, no, no."
1997.120_orig,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2439.266,2442.498,"--Mr. Smirlock, here's what troubles me about your argument."
1997.120_orig,2,21541,daniel_smirlock,,2479.796,2481.218,"Well, the meaning isn't so strange."
1997.120_orig,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2483.81,2484.028,Right.
1997.120_orig,2,21541,daniel_smirlock,,2484.028,2484.435,--and a statute.
1997.120_orig,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2484.435,2484.653,Right.
1997.120_orig,2,21541,daniel_smirlock,,2484.653,2491.416,"And this Compact gives Ellis Island, including the landfill, as I'll explain, to New York."
1997.120_orig,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2495.821,2497.008,It was the island then.
1997.120_orig,2,21541,daniel_smirlock,,2500.772,2502.788,"--Well, here's the question, Your Honor."
1997.120_orig,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2515.36,2532.04,"Whatever that may have provided then, what Article Second clearly does... it uses the word present... it seems to preserve the status quo, what was at the time, and it's silent as to anything else, as far as I can tell."
1997.120_orig,2,21541,daniel_smirlock,,2532.04,2536.383,--I think it preserves the status quo as to the scope of New York's jurisdiction.
1997.120_orig,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2547.739,2551.596,How about the common law rule that avulsion doesn't change boundaries?

1997.120_orig,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2577.898,2603.246,"Yes, but when you're talking about what happens when an island is extended by landfill, and as Justice Scalia points out in a number of cases we've had to try to analyze where were the original boundaries of the island, that sort of thing, certainly if this was a compact that didn't specify, you would think that it would follow the common law rule that an avulsion doesn't change a boundary."

1997.120_orig,2,21541,daniel_smirlock,,2795.841,2797.355,"--I believe the point is conceded, Your Honor, yes."
1997.120_orig,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2797.355,2797.605,It is--
1997.120_orig,2,21541,daniel_smirlock,,2797.605,2798.605,"New Jersey law applies, yes."
1997.120_orig,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2798.605,2798.855,--Thank you.
1997.120_orig,2,21541,daniel_smirlock,,2811.522,2817.066,Exact... it's the inverse of the Article Third provision I was talking about a moment ago.
1997.120_orig,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2822.393,2822.768,Right--
1997.120_orig,2,21541,daniel_smirlock,,2822.768,2827.421,--and abutting Staten Island you had waters over which New Jersey--
1997.120_orig,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2827.421,2829.03,--Just like Ellis Island.
1997.120_orig,2,21541,daniel_smirlock,,2829.03,2830.936,"--Right, and that's... no, not just like Ellis Island."
1997.120_orig,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2835.652,2839.886,But not the... not over the waters surrounding Staten Island?
1997.120_orig,2,21541,daniel_smirlock,,2839.886,2840.214,No.
1997.120_orig,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2844.695,2848.163,New York didn't even have the navigation jurisdiction?
1997.120_orig,2,21541,daniel_smirlock,,2848.163,2853.394,"--Not in that small territory, and that's why the compacting parties had to sort out--"
1997.120_orig,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2853.394,2853.785,I see.
1997.120_orig,2,21541,daniel_smirlock,,2853.785,2878.651,"--who had authority over those improvements, so when you see that in the Compact you have to say either, they envisioned landfill on Staten Island in New Jersey but not on islands where it had already been put, which seems to us most improbable, or, they simply didn't feel they had to deal with it because there was no potential conflict between exclusive jurisdiction under Article Third or Fifth and New York sovereignty over the islands under Article Second."
1997.120_orig,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3006.194,3011.268,"Well, how much opportunity did New Jersey have to object to some of these things?"
1997.120_orig,2,21541,daniel_smirlock,,3013.642,3015.72,"They were... well, I think those are two different questions."
1997.120_orig,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3026.185,3042.367,"Well, I mean, so someone is identified as having been born in a hospital on Ellis Island and born in New York, and this somehow comes to the attention of New Jersey, I mean, is... are... is New Jersey suppose to seek a correction of that record to show the person was born in New Jersey?"
1997.120_orig,2,21541,daniel_smirlock,,3042.367,3045.334,"If they think they're sovereign over the land, but it's not... I'm not saying that they--"
1997.120_orig,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3045.334,3050.159,This is a very... that's a very abstract difference with no consequences to the State.
1997.120_orig,2,21541,daniel_smirlock,,3056.829,3077.524,"--Well, as a matter of fact, Ellis Island, erroneously for New Jersey, was on both tax rolls of the State, and in fact, although the tax records are so old that we don't have them, in fact, at least as of 1940, income tax earned by people who worked on the island would have been taxable by a State."
1997.120_orig,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3082.975,3091.565,"Well, that I grant you, but it seems to me some of the examples that you give are things where it really wouldn't have made any difference in the operations of the State."
1997.120_orig,2,21541,daniel_smirlock,,3091.565,3096.501,"Well, some are obscure, but some are as... open and notorious, you might say."
1997.120_orig,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3096.939,3101.858,Are you saying that those acts put New Jersey on notice that it should have filed its suit earlier?
1997.120_orig,2,21541,daniel_smirlock,,3105.95,3108.435,"--It's not a laches argument in disguise, it's--"
1997.120_orig,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3108.435,3108.622,Or is it still prescription?
1997.120_orig,2,21541,daniel_smirlock,,3108.622,3109.871,"--No, it's not a laches argument in disguise."
1997.120_orig,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3129.675,3140.609,But isn't it the overwhelming presence of the United States throughout the period that stops New Jersey... what is there to object to?
1997.120_orig,2,21541,daniel_smirlock,,3154.994,3170.518,"As to that, Your Honor, as this Court has often made clear, even when the United States has plenary jurisdiction, enclave jurisdiction over particular territory within a State, there's a good deal of residual jurisdiction that can be exercised by that State."
1997.120_orig,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3214.313,3216.358,"Well, the Davis-Bacon is mixed, isn't it?"
1997.120_orig,2,21541,daniel_smirlock,,3222.45,3224.027,"It depends upon what you mean by mixed, Your Honor."
1997.120_orig,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3263.168,3273.664,"Well, I think all of that has less to do with who they thought owned it than with whether the rates are higher or lower and whether they're seeking union support or not."
1997.120_orig,2,21541,daniel_smirlock,,3278.396,3287.002,"Possibly with the Davis-Bacon stuff it is, but with much of the... I recited already the examples of New York's prescription."
1997.120_orig,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3287.002,3288.565,How many people lived on Ellis Island?
1997.120_orig,2,21541,daniel_smirlock,,3288.565,3291.47,Between 100 and 200 over the years.
1997.120_orig,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3352.944,3364.768,"Well, that really wasn't a very good deal for New Jersey, certainly, if as soon as... if they owned the water... owned the land when it was under water, but as soon as it emerged from the water it went to New York."
1997.120_orig,2,21541,daniel_smirlock,,3364.768,3366.174,"--Well, it was valuable land, Your Honor."
1997.120_orig,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3370.109,3374.249,How much value is land that's under water?
1997.120_orig,2,21541,daniel_smirlock,,3374.249,3378.482,"--As... to wharf out on, extremely valuable."
1997.120_orig,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3398.582,3404.064,"Mr. Smirlock, you know, I think it's a hard row to hoe to establish prescription."
1997.120_orig,2,21541,daniel_smirlock,,3430.195,3430.727,Right.
1997.120_orig,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3430.727,3433.178,But to establish prescription--
1997.120_orig,2,21541,daniel_smirlock,,3433.178,3435.115,"Very well, Your Honor."
1997.120_orig,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3451.063,3468.585,"--Are we supposed to go back... I mean, I notice the Special Master says that New York was unable to prove that the births, marriages and deaths she documented occurred on the island, let alone the landfilled portions, so is it your thought that we would go back and read all the evidence on that, and then we come to an opposite conclusion?"
1997.120_orig,2,21541,daniel_smirlock,,3468.585,3471.897,"If you read even any of the evidence you'll come to an opposite conclusion, Your Honor."
1997.120_orig,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3492.419,3493.888,"Well, you said, now, it's pretty clear."
1997.120_orig,2,21541,daniel_smirlock,,3493.888,3495.262,--It is entirely clear.
1997.120_orig,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3521.848,3535.716,"Well, if one concludes that even if that's so, a few births and a few deaths don't make Ellis Island filled-in land, under the sovereignty of one State or the other, that's--"
1997.120_orig,2,21541,daniel_smirlock,,3535.716,3548.32,"--If that were all we have, maybe not, but there is this pattern of everything that happened on Ellis Island that was subject to any State's jurisdiction or any sort of action by any State was always taken control of by New York."
1997.120_orig,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3558.645,3560.285,--Don't they have Mayor Hague?
1997.120_orig,2,21541,daniel_smirlock,,3562.035,3564.033,"Ah, yes, the Mary Norton episode."
1997.120_orig,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3569.421,3572.841,--Answer the question.
1997.120_orig,2,21541,daniel_smirlock,,3572.841,3586.556,"--And Mayor Hague came in and said, I don't know anything about a compact, but New... Ellis Island, New Jersey workers want Ellis Island, so give us jobs, and even then they couldn't get away with it, Your Honor."
1997.120_orig,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3591.803,3593.443,"Thank you, Mr. Smirlock."
