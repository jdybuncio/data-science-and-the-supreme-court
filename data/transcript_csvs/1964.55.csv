1964.55,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,18.143,"55, Independent Petroleum Workers of America Incorporated versus American Oil Company."
1964.55,0,20827,david_e_feller,,19.476,23.356,May it please the Court.
1964.55,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,696.734,709.155,"Did I understand Mr. Feller, on the other part of the -- on the other part of the case, the Court's function, I suppose, is limited to determining arbitrability."
1964.55,0,20827,david_e_feller,,709.155,710.774,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1964.55,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,710.774,724.186,"And would you say that when the union under this contract claimed a violation of the terms of the contract, that the Court has no function at all other than to order arbitration?"
1964.55,0,20827,david_e_feller,,724.186,726.035,I think that is correct.
1964.55,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,726.035,734.485,"I mean if the -- let's assume that the union just can -- they admitted, well it will determine the agreement if we claim it's arbitrated, that we claim there was a violation anyway."
1964.55,0,20827,david_e_feller,,734.485,735.433,"Well, the question --"
1964.55,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,735.433,738.405,But the arbitrator is the one that ought to fill us out and not the Court.
1964.55,0,20827,david_e_feller,,738.405,744.077,"Well, that's -- basically, if the arbitrator decides that there is no provision on the contract governing such --"
1964.55,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,744.077,745.794,"But, what does the Court do?"
1964.55,0,20827,david_e_feller,,745.794,748.261,The Court orders arbitration of that claim.
1964.55,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,748.261,763.031,"Even if the union -- what if the Court says to the union when it comes in the Court on its complaint says, “Yes, I see that you claim a violation, but tell us what term of the contract is violated”, do you think that question is out of order?"
1964.55,0,20827,david_e_feller,,763.031,771.171,"Well, I think the Court can inquire to see if it is a genuine claim in a sense that do you claim or which term of the agreement do you --"
1964.55,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,771.171,771.27,But the union --
1964.55,0,20827,david_e_feller,,771.27,772.157,-- claim is violated?
1964.55,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,772.157,774.423,But the union tells the Court that it's none of your business.
1964.55,0,20827,david_e_feller,,779.283,782.702,"Well, I don't regard arbitrability as a kind of a separate subject."
1964.55,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,787.05,789.063,But what if the Court ought to say though then?
1964.55,0,20827,david_e_feller,,789.063,805.956,"I think the Court ought to say, “Mr. Company, you arbitrate the claim that you have violated the agreement”, not the question of whether your contract -- conduct is proper or fair or should be held to be wrong."
1964.55,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,805.956,812.895,Its arbitrability in the merits of the grievance may be -- may involve the same question here.
1964.55,0,20827,david_e_feller,,812.895,813.958,It very well may.
1964.55,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,885.246,886.687,"Mr. Feller, may I see if I understand you well."
1964.55,0,20827,david_e_feller,,925.42,932.091,"Indeed, that is the classic case in which the union claims that you violate the recognition clause of the agreement."
1964.55,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,967.611,967.665,Well suppose --
1964.55,0,20827,david_e_feller,,967.665,968.142,-- reducing its scope.
1964.55,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,968.142,984.153,"-- an automobile manufacturer and the union says, the manufacturer decides it's going to introduce a new model of automobile and the union comes in and objects on the ground that the introduction of the new model is a violation of the agreement."
1964.55,0,20827,david_e_feller,,984.153,987.403,"Well, I think they would be entitled to have that claim."
1964.55,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,987.403,988.774,Arbitrated?
1964.55,0,20827,david_e_feller,,988.774,991.505,Decided by an arbitrator.
1964.55,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1044.523,1053.856,"So there are no -- under your approach, there are no nonarbitrable matters if the union just says violation."
1964.55,0,20827,david_e_feller,,1053.856,1058.24,"Well, there are no -- nonarbitrable claims of violation of the agreement."
1964.55,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1059.016,1059.397,Yes.
1964.55,0,20827,david_e_feller,,1059.397,1064.358,"Under an agreement which says, that the claims of violation agreement shall be arbitrated."
1964.55,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1064.56,1064.583,"Or, or you --"
1964.55,0,20827,david_e_feller,,1064.583,1065.898,-- that's almost chronological.
1964.55,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1065.898,1071.072,"Or even say, don't use the word violation in the contract, but you could use -- you've got the same argument with the Board's interpretation."
1964.55,0,20827,david_e_feller,,1071.072,1079.021,"Well now, if you're talking about the arbitration, then I have to look at the arbitration clause, the arbitration clause may say only questions concerning wages may be arbitrated."
1964.55,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1079.021,1079.827,"Well, I understand it."
1964.55,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1079.827,1086.583,"But if -- but if it says in application or interpretation that leaves out the word violation, you could make the same argument as found on those words."
1964.55,0,20827,david_e_feller,,1086.583,1087.632,"Well, I think I could make it --"
1964.55,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1087.632,1087.744,Yes.
1964.55,0,20827,david_e_feller,,1087.744,1096.776,"-- under application and interpretation that -- in each case, you have to look at the content, the scope which the arbitration clause is intended to be given."
1964.55,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1118.135,1118.248,Well this is a --
1964.55,0,20827,david_e_feller,,1118.248,1119.464,-- in American Manufacturing.
1964.55,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1119.464,1123.12,This section here with a lot of waste of words --
1964.55,0,20827,david_e_feller,,1123.12,1124.211,Oh no.
1964.55,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1124.211,1128.348,"-- in terms of trying to limit, it sounds like it's trying to limit the subject --"
1964.55,0,20827,david_e_feller,,1128.348,1129.077,Well no.
1964.55,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1135.889,1136.984,I understand.
1964.55,0,20827,david_e_feller,,1136.984,1138.765,-- not claiming a violation of the agreement.
1964.55,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1172.092,1178.076,"Now, do I understand Mr. Feller that this contract has some limitations to wages, hours, and working conditions?"
1964.55,0,20827,david_e_feller,,1178.076,1182.767,"It has -- the limitation, there are two limitations."
1964.55,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1261.748,1268.596,"But I'm just wondering Mr. Feller, what consequences (d) under your interpretation of (a)?"
1964.55,0,20827,david_e_feller,,1268.596,1287.686,"Well, under my interpretation of (a) what is -- what is the consequence of (d) is if the union comes in and says, “Well, there's no provision on the allocation of overtime” and I don't have the full contract or on some other matter relating to wages, hours and terms and conditions of employment, it's not a very big agreement."
1964.55,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1302.998,1316.843,"Yes, but if the union said -- this certainly seems to exclude things not covered from the agreement from arbitration but if the union says as I understand you, in (d) it is a violation of the agreement then the Court can do nothing but order arbitration."
1964.55,0,20827,david_e_feller,,1316.843,1322.948,The Court can order arbitration of the claim that is not -- that it is covered by the agreement.
1964.55,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1534.833,1539.383,Mr. Anderson.
1964.55,1,23505,frederic_d_anderson,,1539.383,1543.766,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1964.55,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2176.255,2176.767,Page what of the record?
1964.55,1,23505,frederic_d_anderson,,2176.767,2177.817,-- any such matter.
1964.55,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2178.28,2179.36,Page?
1964.55,1,23505,frederic_d_anderson,,2179.36,2180.707,At the bottom of page 12.
1964.55,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2180.707,2181.776,Of what?
1964.55,1,23505,frederic_d_anderson,,2181.776,2182.955,"I'm sorry, of the transcript."
1964.55,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2182.955,2183.604,Of the transcript.
1964.55,1,23505,frederic_d_anderson,,2185.792,2215.707,"Now, the Court, therefore had to look at the contract to see whether contracting out was one of the matters not covered by the agreement or was one of the matters covered by the agreement and the Court found that it was not one of the matters covered by the agreement for four reasons."
1964.55,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2495.785,2497.47,May I ask you.
1964.55,1,23505,frederic_d_anderson,,2509.974,2510.785,No.
1964.55,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2527.373,2536.918,I'm familiar with that but where do you find that that said they will not submit questions of contracting out to arbitrator.
1964.55,1,23505,frederic_d_anderson,,2536.918,2539.668,I find that it says that in this way.
1964.55,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2576.761,2602.159,"Does that -- does that answer the argument which I understood Mr. Feller made and I thought he did, and I just looked to the brief to this effect that the question of arbitration -- the question of the meaning of the contract is agreed to be submitted to arbitration."
1964.55,1,23505,frederic_d_anderson,,2611.115,2642.707,"Well, I think Mr. Feller made that argument and made that orally here, that I believe is contrary to the decisions of this Court for example in John Wiley & Sons against Livingston, Drake Bakeries and all of the others, in all of those cases, this Court has said that there is a question of interpreting the contract which is for the Court and not the arbitrator."
1964.55,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2642.707,2647.599,Do you mean that cannot be agreed in a way?
1964.55,1,23505,frederic_d_anderson,,2649.987,2650.236,Oh!
1964.55,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2664.001,2669.698,Question of meaning could not be submitted to the arbitrator?
1964.55,1,23505,frederic_d_anderson,,2669.698,2669.907,Oh!
1964.55,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2679.715,2681.765,What if they had agreed to that?
1964.55,1,23505,frederic_d_anderson,,2681.765,2688.538,"If they had agreed to that, then you would have -- we would have to argue -- arbitrate the question of arbitrability"
1964.55,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2688.538,2689.533,You agree to that.
1964.55,1,23505,frederic_d_anderson,,2689.533,2691.152,"Yes, Mr. Justice."
1964.55,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2691.152,2694.494,So you get back to the question of whether they agree to it.
1964.55,1,23505,frederic_d_anderson,,2694.494,2717.25,"Exactly and that is the question which this Court has said was for the Court, namely, looking at that language of the contract and interpreting it to see whether or not it contains a promise by the arbitrator to arbitrate this kind of a matter."
1964.55,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2718.971,2728.419,"You are not -- you are not challenging in any way the right of the party to make such an agreement if they did, had made it?"
1964.55,1,23505,frederic_d_anderson,,2728.419,2729.8,I am not.
1964.55,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2738.266,2741.596,"That doesn't quite -- they could agree, you said?"
1964.55,1,23505,frederic_d_anderson,,2741.596,2742.691,They could agree --
1964.55,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2742.691,2756.947,"That they could submit the meaning of this to the arbitrator at all times and all circumstances which would make it impossible for the Court or any court to make that agreement, have anything left to pass on, wouldn't it?"
1964.55,1,23505,frederic_d_anderson,,2756.947,2757.153,Oh!
1964.55,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2789.099,2789.561,But then --
1964.55,1,23505,frederic_d_anderson,,2789.561,2789.989,-- then plainly --
1964.55,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2789.989,2792.512,"-- doesn't he disagree with you on that, does he?"
1964.55,1,23505,frederic_d_anderson,,2792.512,2793.876,I think he disagrees with me on that.
1964.55,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2793.876,2794.686,I thought he did.
1964.55,1,23505,frederic_d_anderson,,2794.686,2795.343,"Yes, I think he disagreed."
1964.55,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2795.343,2803.461,"I thought that was your real issue, the main issue, before you get to -- with the contract and its meaning."
1964.55,1,23505,frederic_d_anderson,,2803.461,2814.43,"Except that if you stated that that is the issue, you never get to really -- first of all, this contract does not expressly say that."
1964.55,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2815.256,2818.604,"Well, it doesn't have to -- it doesn't have to say it expressly, does it?"
1964.55,1,23505,frederic_d_anderson,,2818.604,2820.472,It does not.
1964.55,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2851.865,2854.693,"But those matters are not in issue here, are they?"
1964.55,1,23505,frederic_d_anderson,,2875.341,2891.202,"In order to answer that question, the Court has to interpret Section 10 of the collective bargaining agreement for either the provision to which Mr. Feller referred is in this agreement or it is not."
1964.55,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2903.896,2910.541,"I didn't -- I understood him to rely mainly on what the Court had said heretofore, not on what is in the contract."
1964.55,1,23505,frederic_d_anderson,,2910.541,2911.178,"Yes, but what --"
1964.55,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2911.178,2912.185,That's how you can construe it.
1964.55,1,23505,frederic_d_anderson,,2912.185,2912.633,Yes.
1964.55,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3002.697,3007.589,"Well then, may I -- may say, maybe I don't quite understand you."
1964.55,1,23505,frederic_d_anderson,,3026.384,3028.309,"Yes, I think that's right."
1964.55,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3123.061,3127.127,Do you agree that they could do that and the contract would be valid?
1964.55,1,23505,frederic_d_anderson,,3127.127,3138.2,"If the union can bring an action to compel arbitrability, to compel you to arbitrate arbitrability before an arbitrator, a union can do that."
1964.55,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3153.166,3180.136,"Do you gather that -- you said the contract had said the -- you will arbitrate all matters of interpretation -- application or interpretation of the contract, period, without all the language you've got in this Section here, would you -- would you say that the standard arbitration clause would leave us a situation where the union could get the arbitrator on the question of arbitrability?"
1964.55,1,23505,frederic_d_anderson,,3180.136,3180.881,"Well, no."
1964.55,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3351.118,3355.258,"Finish your statement on that, mister, just briefly."
1964.55,1,23505,frederic_d_anderson,,3355.258,3366.267,"With the union's chief reliance in this matter, the thing which had been adjudicated in the first case was the meaning of a tax statute."
1964.55,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3477.344,3490.674,"And the -- Mr. Anderson, is the -- is the cause really at part two of the complaint here, I guess the Court of Appeals ordered the District Court to enter judgment on both counts, didn't it?"
1964.55,1,23505,frederic_d_anderson,,3490.674,3492.597,I think it did.
1964.55,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3492.64,3499.023,"What was -- actually, the summary judgment of the District Court is related to one count, isn't it?"
1964.55,1,23505,frederic_d_anderson,,3499.023,3499.478,Well --
1964.55,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3499.478,3500.091,Or with the one clause --
1964.55,1,23505,frederic_d_anderson,,3500.091,3500.747,"-- yes, it did."
1964.55,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3501.715,3505.413,But why would the Court of Appeals go to both clauses?
1964.55,1,23505,frederic_d_anderson,,3505.413,3516.726,"The decision of the Court of Appeals makes it plain for it says so in so many words in the footnote, that only count one was before it."
1964.55,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3529.146,3536.298,"Well, is that order -- that -- that order -- the entire order is here though, isn't it?"
1964.55,1,23505,frederic_d_anderson,,3536.298,3538.261,The entire order is here.
1964.55,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3583.952,3585.321,"Well, let me -- let me ask you."
1964.55,1,23505,frederic_d_anderson,,3632.545,3633.017,Oh!
1964.55,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3634.85,3634.972,"Well, why not?"
1964.55,1,23505,frederic_d_anderson,,3634.972,3644.417,In your case -- your case as stated leaves out the terms of the promise to arbitrate and those are vital because that is what the Court must --
1964.55,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3644.417,3644.498,"Well, let's put it --"
1964.55,1,23505,frederic_d_anderson,,3644.498,3645.234,-- interpret.
1964.55,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3646.541,3648.102,-- let's put in the words that are used here.
1964.55,1,23505,frederic_d_anderson,,3656.449,3657.025,Yes.
1964.55,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3657.025,3667.069,"And the union comes in and said that, “The company has violated clause X, a term in this agreement, and we want it arbitrated”."
1964.55,1,23505,frederic_d_anderson,,3699.389,3700.628,Oh!
1964.55,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3717.518,3717.803,Well then --
1964.55,1,23505,frederic_d_anderson,,3717.803,3720.212,"-- not which way it's covered, but whether it's covered."
1964.55,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3720.212,3721.648,That's exactly what I'm saying.
1964.55,1,23505,frederic_d_anderson,,3732.48,3732.565,And that --
1964.55,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3732.565,3733.537,And it's meaning.
1964.55,1,23505,frederic_d_anderson,,3733.537,3738.762,"Yes, and that's only because the parties so agreed in part (d)."
1964.55,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3742.69,3763.807,But this involved -- this certainly involved the interpretation of a term in the agreement and the reason you say it's for the Court is because you say the arbitration clause necessarily projects the Court in the business of interpreting the clauses of the contract other than arbitration clause.
1964.55,1,23505,frederic_d_anderson,,3763.807,3765.95,That is right and this is --
1964.55,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3765.95,3769.738,"Or, really is -- are you saying that the Court really decides the grievance too then?"
1964.55,1,23505,frederic_d_anderson,,3769.738,3770.248,Oh!
1964.55,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3772.066,3779.62,"Well, even if the Court said -- the Court said that the term doesn't relate to it, the grievance is over."
1964.55,1,23505,frederic_d_anderson,,3779.62,3780.301,No sir.
1964.55,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3843.659,3846.426,"Mr. Feller, you may have an additional five minutes for rebuttal."
1964.55,2,20827,david_e_feller,,3846.426,3848.772,Thank you Your Honor.
1964.55,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3900.995,3910.429,"Would you mind telling me which part of the Act you specifically rely on -- the contract to specifically rely on, on there --"
1964.55,2,20827,david_e_feller,,3910.429,3922.483,"The -- well, I have relied on the contract for the -- for the arbitrability, Section 10 (a) (1) which says that --"
1964.55,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3922.483,3924.022,Where is that?
1964.55,2,20827,david_e_feller,,3924.022,3937.526,"Well, we go back -- now, I take it Mr. Justice Black you're asking me what Section we rely on to say that the grievance is arbitrable, not what Section we rely on to say that the company violated the agreement."
1964.55,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3937.526,3942.232,The termination of the meaning of the contract is arbitrated.
1964.55,2,20827,david_e_feller,,3942.232,3943.192,That is correct.
