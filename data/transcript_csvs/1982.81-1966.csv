1982.81-1966,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,9.854,"We will hear arguments next in the case of Belknap, Incorporated, versus Duwaine E. Hale, et al.."
1982.81-1966,0,34421,larry_e_forrester,,45.043,48.853,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1982.81-1966,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,287.522,304.595,"Mr. Forrester, may I ask, do you know of any cases in which an action for failure properly to represent has been brought against a union by strike replacements?"
1982.81-1966,0,34421,larry_e_forrester,,304.595,307.499,"I know of no such case, Justice Brennan."
1982.81-1966,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,307.499,313.746,Neither Board nor state court or federal court?
1982.81-1966,0,34421,larry_e_forrester,,313.746,319.62,I know of no such case.
1982.81-1966,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,319.62,320.758,Yes.
1982.81-1966,0,34421,larry_e_forrester,,328.507,332.972,The union owed the duty of fair representation to all members of the bargaining unit.
1982.81-1966,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,335.768,339.815,But wasn't this in connection with negotiating a new agreement?
1982.81-1966,0,34421,larry_e_forrester,,339.815,341.329,--Yes.
1982.81-1966,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,347.653,352.87,"Well, even people who are hired as replacements?"
1982.81-1966,0,34421,larry_e_forrester,,352.87,359.882,Replacements have to be considered members of a bargaining unit if they are... they stand in the stead of the strikers.
1982.81-1966,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,362.6,367.864,"And yet, Mr. Forrester, how is this striking union ever going to meet that duty?"
1982.81-1966,0,34421,larry_e_forrester,,376.002,380.156,"Well, there is certainly a conflict among the strikers and the replacement workers."
1982.81-1966,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,380.811,381.797,"Well, that's why I wonder."
1982.81-1966,0,34421,larry_e_forrester,,389.042,391.589,--There was no suit against the union by the strike replacements.
1982.81-1966,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,391.589,393.48,"Not here, though."
1982.81-1966,0,34421,larry_e_forrester,,398.65,400.163,This suit is against Belknap.
1982.81-1966,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,400.163,401.255,"--Yes, against the company."
1982.81-1966,0,34421,larry_e_forrester,,401.255,402.024,That's correct.
1982.81-1966,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,402.024,411.628,"Well, when these people were hired was there any kind of a contract that would preclude their being discharged, with or without cause?"
1982.81-1966,0,34421,larry_e_forrester,,411.628,414.721,There was no such contract.
1982.81-1966,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,423.67,425.811,"Well, they did make the promise--"
1982.81-1966,0,34421,larry_e_forrester,,425.811,426.809,They did make the promise.
1982.81-1966,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,426.809,428.17,--you're going to be a permanent employee.
1982.81-1966,0,34421,larry_e_forrester,,429.324,430.697,They did reiterate it.
1982.81-1966,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,430.697,432.666,And they also alleged fraud.
1982.81-1966,0,34421,larry_e_forrester,,432.666,441.351,"They did allege fraud, but that was not the basis upon which the Court of Appeals determined that they could sue in state court."
1982.81-1966,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,451.486,453.08,You've broken your contract.
1982.81-1966,0,34421,larry_e_forrester,,453.08,454.64,--they've stated a cause of action.
1982.81-1966,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,468.917,472.698,"Well, but you don't... that doesn't... that's just a privilege."
1982.81-1966,0,34421,larry_e_forrester,,475.162,477.147,"--Well, it's a substantial economic weapon."
1982.81-1966,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,477.147,483.067,"--Well, it may be, but you're not obliged to, in hiring replacements, to say they're going to be permanent."
1982.81-1966,0,34421,larry_e_forrester,,483.067,485.052,"Well, we are privileged to do so under Mackay Radio."
1982.81-1966,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,485.052,487.068,"All right, you're privileged, but you're not obligated to."
1982.81-1966,0,34421,larry_e_forrester,,487.068,490.581,"And if we do not so characterize it, we do not have that economic weapon."
1982.81-1966,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,490.581,503.559,"Supposing, Mr. Forrester, that an employer in the midst of what he knows is an unfair labor practice strike wants to get replacement workers, and suppose he gives each of the replacement workers two-year contracts."
1982.81-1966,0,34421,larry_e_forrester,,523.661,544.465,"Well, I suggest that a state court's inquiry into the subjective motivation of an employer in those circumstances substantially interferes with the line of preemption cases that permit employers and labor unions to resort to economic weapons whenever there's a labor dispute."
1982.81-1966,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,544.465,551.758,"Well, it doesn't permit employers to resort to fraud or breach of contract, though, in dealing with a group of employees."
1982.81-1966,0,34421,larry_e_forrester,,551.758,554.802,"I agree that it does not permit that, Justice Rehnquist."
1982.81-1966,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,567.831,595.271,"You say, then, that a replacement worker who is hired by the employer, the employer in his own mind knows, I am probably going to have to let this guy go in about three months but I really need him, so I'm going to tell him he can have the job for two years because he's got a job now and he wouldn't leave it if I told him it was just for three months, you're saying that that employee has no cause of action, tort or contract, when he is discharged after three months, in state court?"
1982.81-1966,0,34421,larry_e_forrester,,595.271,604.642,"Promises of that sort may conceivably be unfair labor practices, inasmuch as the employer continues to have the duty to bargain with the representative concerning--"
1982.81-1966,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,604.642,611.096,"Yes, but my question was, can this employee sue in state court for fraud or for breach of contract?"
1982.81-1966,0,34421,larry_e_forrester,,611.096,613.062,--It is our position that he cannot.
1982.81-1966,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,613.062,616.013,How does that interfere with the National Labor Relations Act?
1982.81-1966,0,34421,larry_e_forrester,,616.013,628.586,"Because whenever a state court is permitted to inquire into the subjective motivations of an employer for offering permanent replacement status, then the damage to that economic weapon is done."
1982.81-1966,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,628.586,633.46,What is subjective about a contract of employment of two years?
1982.81-1966,0,34421,larry_e_forrester,,633.46,637.082,It's the intention of the employer with regard to that contract.
1982.81-1966,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,639.629,646.768,"Under the hypothesis that Justice Rehnquist gave you, I thought he was just talking about a flat-out contract for two years."
1982.81-1966,0,34421,larry_e_forrester,,646.768,655.406,--I thought Justice Rehnquist was suggesting that the employer knew that it was an unfair labor practice strike and he could not reasonably offer that employment contract.
1982.81-1966,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,655.406,664.823,"That might come into play, but he's made them a... there's nothing subjective or ambiguous about an employment contract for two years, is there?"
1982.81-1966,0,34421,larry_e_forrester,,664.823,666.82,"There is not, Mr. Chief Justice."
1982.81-1966,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,666.82,670.088,Then why can't that be enforced in state courts?
1982.81-1966,0,34421,larry_e_forrester,,670.088,676.35,Because any such contract which would be in derogation of a collective bargaining agreement is not enforceable.
1982.81-1966,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,679.879,685.596,How is that in derogation of the collective bargaining agreement?
1982.81-1966,0,34421,larry_e_forrester,,685.596,696.167,"Well, the employer... let's assume the employer enters a contract for two years as you suggest, and subsequently negotiates the terms and conditions for that unit."
1982.81-1966,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,700.215,715.053,"Could I ask you, suppose there hadn't been a settlement, but the employer held out and the strike... he just broke the strike by hiring these replacements, all of whom he promised permanent jobs to, and so the strike was over."
1982.81-1966,0,34421,larry_e_forrester,,720.878,724.641,"Well, in the context of this case the Board would have pursued the unfair labor practice."
1982.81-1966,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,724.641,728.092,"No, but let's just assume no unfair labor practice."
1982.81-1966,0,34421,larry_e_forrester,,745.711,748.522,"There may be a cause of action, depending on state law."
1982.81-1966,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,748.522,749.333,"What do you mean, may be?"
1982.81-1966,0,34421,larry_e_forrester,,776.965,783.899,The argument is that he will be effectively deprived of the economic weapon of offering permanent employment status to strike replacements.
1982.81-1966,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,783.899,785.069,You mean lying about it.
1982.81-1966,0,34421,larry_e_forrester,,790.162,792.739,I suggest that the likelihood of an employer--
1982.81-1966,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,792.739,795.191,That is an interesting piece of a protected activity.
1982.81-1966,0,34421,larry_e_forrester,,795.191,803.544,--I suggest that the likelihood of an employer being in a position to cynically predict down the road what is going to happen in a labor dispute is not great.
1982.81-1966,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,803.544,824.255,"It isn't cynically, but all he would have to do to protect himself, and he may not be able to hire replacements, but he would have to say: Look, this is certainly my promise to you: I'll keep you if I can, but if it turns out that I've got an unfair labor practice charge made out against me I'm going to have to can you."
1982.81-1966,0,34421,larry_e_forrester,,831.582,847.402,"I do, and the problem arises either in that context or another: Once an employer determines to hire permanent replacements, he continues to have the obligation to bargain with the union about the terms and conditions of employment for members of the bargaining unit."
1982.81-1966,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,852.042,858.149,"Well, he doesn't if he wins the strike and he's hired replacements who aren't a member of the union."
1982.81-1966,0,34421,larry_e_forrester,,858.149,869.348,"--If the strike is over and no bargaining obligation continues, he is relieved of that risk and that responsibility and the mandate under the Federal Labor Act."
1982.81-1966,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,869.348,880.451,"It's your position that in order to really deal with the union and fight his battle during the strike, all bets are off so far as other areas of the law are concerned, really."
1982.81-1966,0,34421,larry_e_forrester,,897.85,904.663,"Obviously, there is some sort of egregious conduct that should be subject to state law."
1982.81-1966,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,904.663,905.942,"Well, how about fraud?"
1982.81-1966,0,34421,larry_e_forrester,,905.942,909.896,"In the context of this case, I do not believe that was an element."
1982.81-1966,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,909.896,912.002,"Well, what about just straight contract?"
1982.81-1966,0,34421,larry_e_forrester,,939.411,941.958,"Well, in this case there were no two-year contracts."
1982.81-1966,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,941.958,944.005,"Well, it was even worse."
1982.81-1966,0,34421,larry_e_forrester,,945.974,949.706,As is required in order for an employer to preserve that economic weapon.
1982.81-1966,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,949.706,951.55,Not required.
1982.81-1966,0,34421,larry_e_forrester,,960.313,962.372,There has not been.
1982.81-1966,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,962.372,966.091,The case hasn't been tried yet on the state claim?
1982.81-1966,0,34421,larry_e_forrester,,966.091,967.339,It has not been tried yet.
1982.81-1966,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,967.339,974.21,"Yes, but as the case comes to us, the case is presented to us, there was a promise of permanent employment."
1982.81-1966,0,34421,larry_e_forrester,,974.21,975.244,There was a promise of--
1982.81-1966,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,975.244,976.351,And reiterated.
1982.81-1966,0,34421,larry_e_forrester,,976.351,977.711,--And reiterated.
1982.81-1966,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,977.711,978.632,You concede that?
1982.81-1966,0,34421,larry_e_forrester,,978.632,980.566,"I do concede that, Justice White."
1982.81-1966,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,988.236,989.925,We all understand that.
1982.81-1966,0,34421,larry_e_forrester,,992.281,992.503,No.
1982.81-1966,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,993.876,1009.415,We have to proceed on the assumption that there is a probability or a possibility that a contract will be established in the proceedings in the future.
1982.81-1966,0,34421,larry_e_forrester,,1009.415,1020.427,"If there is a contract in the proceedings in the future, it is of course in contrast with a collective bargaining agreement that covers the same terms and conditions of employment."
1982.81-1966,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1020.427,1028.191,"Well, anything to prevent a person from making inconsistent contracts with two different people at the same time?"
1982.81-1966,0,34421,larry_e_forrester,,1028.191,1032.438,"No, Mr. Chief Justice, there is nothing to prohibit it."
1982.81-1966,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1032.438,1034.532,"If he breaches one of them, then he's going to be liable on that one."
1982.81-1966,0,34421,larry_e_forrester,,1034.532,1042.776,But a collective bargaining agreement always prevails over any individual employment understandings between an employee and his employer.
1982.81-1966,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1042.776,1067.751,"You don't say that this is preempted because there's any... that the employer was doing something that was expressly prohibited or permitted, protected by the Act in the normal sense of the word?"
1982.81-1966,0,34421,larry_e_forrester,,1081.67,1083.199,"Not entirely, Justice White."
1982.81-1966,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1083.199,1084.449,What is the unfair labor practice--
1982.81-1966,0,34421,larry_e_forrester,,1084.449,1103.253,"If as a matter of law, as the Labor Board contended, that the strike was converted to an unfair labor practice strike with the offer of the wage increase on the 1st of February, then the mere offering of permanent employment to replacement strikers according to the Labor Board is an unfair labor practice."
1982.81-1966,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1103.253,1116.184,"--Had the unfair labor practice proceeding continued to attend, you're... and you'd been found guilty of an unfair labor practice, you may have been subject to an order of the Board to reinstate the strikers?"
1982.81-1966,0,34421,larry_e_forrester,,1116.184,1121.011,The Regional Director so advised Belknap in their conference where the issues were settled.
1982.81-1966,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1121.011,1125.273,Even after you had made the promises of permanent employment to the replacements?
1982.81-1966,0,34421,larry_e_forrester,,1125.273,1126.432,That's correct.
1982.81-1966,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1126.432,1129.04,Let's assume that's... let's assume that's so.
1982.81-1966,0,34421,larry_e_forrester,,1140.208,1145.344,"Well, it's unlikely that the Board has unfair labor practice jurisdiction to entertain claims of--"
1982.81-1966,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1145.344,1147.313,They couldn't possibly give a remedy--
1982.81-1966,0,34421,larry_e_forrester,,1147.313,1148.077,--Unless--
1982.81-1966,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1148.077,1151.575,"--to the permanent employees, could they, to the permanent replacements?"
1982.81-1966,0,34421,larry_e_forrester,,1154.09,1159.932,--They certainly would not be entitled to remedies that would be a satisfactory state court claim.
1982.81-1966,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1159.932,1176.817,"Well, that really doesn't... you're not suggesting that there's any... that the employer was even arguably committing an unfair labor practice with respect to the permanent employees that he said he was hiring, or the permanent replacements?"
1982.81-1966,0,34421,larry_e_forrester,,1176.817,1189.592,"If in fact and in law it were an unfair labor practice at the time these offers were made, then the Board's position is that it's an unfair labor practice to offer permanent employment status to replacements."
1982.81-1966,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1189.592,1191.655,"Well, it may be, it may be."
1982.81-1966,0,34421,larry_e_forrester,,1218.924,1223.065,"I'm not sure the Labor Board would say that, but it's unlikely a replacement would file such a charge."
1982.81-1966,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1223.065,1224.344,"Exactly, yes."
1982.81-1966,0,34421,larry_e_forrester,,1235.466,1238.402,The issue had been raised.
1982.81-1966,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1246.521,1260.375,"I'm just wondering if the character of the strike would have any impact on your preemption argument, because one kind of strike might give rise to an arguable violation and another kind of strike might not."
1982.81-1966,0,34421,larry_e_forrester,,1268.405,1274.792,"Well, it is clear that the federal issue is decided."
1982.81-1966,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1274.792,1280.712,You don't think the federal issue could be affected by any of the proceedings that take place hereafter?
1982.81-1966,0,34421,larry_e_forrester,,1280.712,1294.441,The only issue that would be subject to exploration with regard to these claims is any question of fraud underlying an employer's motivation in offering permanent employment.
1982.81-1966,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1323.053,1327.74,Your time has expired.
1982.81-1966,0,34421,larry_e_forrester,,1327.74,1329.397,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1982.81-1966,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1329.397,1337.846,Mr. Alito.
1982.81-1966,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1337.846,1347.264,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the court:
1982.81-1966,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1372.16,1374.455,The right to be dishonest in the process or what?
1982.81-1966,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1374.455,1378.421,"--No, Your Honor, I don't think this case involves any dishonesty on the part--"
1982.81-1966,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1378.421,1385.374,The right to promise... the right to make a contractual promise that he knows he may not be able to keep?
1982.81-1966,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1385.374,1392.932,"--An employer certainly does not have that right under federal law, but it may be that, and we contend that it is, it is the case--"
1982.81-1966,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1392.932,1414.0,"You say that he may be able to make this promise, which the federal law may prevent him from keeping, and yet he is not liable for his promise to somebody else, which is probably or perhaps has enticed somebody to leave another job?"
1982.81-1966,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1414.0,1417.626,"--Well, Your Honor, we maintain that suits like the present one are preempted."
1982.81-1966,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1424.326,1425.637,"Well, I don't... let's don't talk about fraud, then."
1982.81-1966,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1461.637,1464.667,"Well, Your Honor, let me make several points in response to that."
1982.81-1966,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1479.79,1480.85,"Well, let's say it wasn't false."
1982.81-1966,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1483.287,1485.927,"--I don't believe it was erroneous, Your Honor."
1982.81-1966,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1488.205,1496.404,"Oh, so you're saying anybody who has had that promise shouldn't win his case because he hasn't been promised anything?"
1982.81-1966,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1496.404,1498.0,"Well, that might be the case."
1982.81-1966,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1500.406,1501.794,"Well, that's what you've just argued."
1982.81-1966,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1501.794,1508.087,"Well, what I'm saying is that in this case there was no... there was no fraud on the strike replacements."
1982.81-1966,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1508.087,1511.695,"Mr. Alito, are you familiar with the opinion of the Kentucky Court of Appeals in this case?"
1982.81-1966,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1511.695,1512.385,"Yes, I am."
1982.81-1966,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1512.385,1525.769,"Well, in the second paragraph, which you will find, I believe, on page 1 of the appendices to the petition, after the beginning of the paragraph cites the names of the parties, it says,"
1982.81-1966,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1536.608,1538.075,"Absolutely not, Your Honor."
1982.81-1966,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1559.414,1564.628,"Well, does Kentucky have the same sort of rules of procedure that the federal courts do, do you know?"
1982.81-1966,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1564.628,1565.847,"I don't know, Your Honor."
1982.81-1966,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1565.847,1575.046,"If it does, certainly any number of amounts of evidence or theories could be adduced in support of a pleading of fraud."
1982.81-1966,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1587.915,1592.04,"Well, I don't want to belabor the characterization of the facts of the case."
1982.81-1966,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1604.753,1613.858,"Well, then you do say that the Kentucky Court of Appeals was wrong when it described this action as alleging fraud, misrepresentation and breach of contract."
1982.81-1966,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1613.858,1617.621,I don't disagree with their characterization of what was alleged.
1982.81-1966,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1630.864,1631.644,Certainly he could do that.
1982.81-1966,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1642.812,1645.56,"Your Honor, there is one possible remedy."
1982.81-1966,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1652.771,1658.129,"You don't seriously argue that the union has a duty to represent the replacements, do you, Mr. Alito?"
1982.81-1966,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1658.129,1661.739,--We contend that they have a duty to represent them in certain respects.
1982.81-1966,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1687.102,1698.769,"Well, your position must be that no suit in the state courts in these circumstances may be maintained, whether it's for fraud, misrepresentation, breach of contract or anything else."
1982.81-1966,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1698.769,1700.864,"That is our position, Your Honor."
1982.81-1966,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1758.026,1768.567,"What's your answer to my question I asked your colleague: If it's not an unfair labor practice strike, there's no charges filed like that, the strike is over, the employer has won it."
1982.81-1966,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1773.098,1775.641,"I see that as a different question, Your Honor--"
1982.81-1966,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1775.641,1776.19,Why?
1982.81-1966,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1776.19,1776.986,--because it does not interfere--
1982.81-1966,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1776.986,1777.766,Why?
1982.81-1966,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1777.766,1780.046,"--Because the strike is over, for that very reason."
1982.81-1966,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1780.046,1780.561,"Well, I know."
1982.81-1966,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1791.137,1810.206,"Well, Justice White, in answer to that question and another question that was asked when Mr. Forrester was speaking, we certainly don't maintain that employers are given carte blanche and are absolutely free from the constraints of state law to promise anything to anybody in the name of maintaining an economic weapon during a labor dispute."
1982.81-1966,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1814.644,1827.168,"So suppose there are unfair labor practice charges filed by the union, who claim that he committed unfair labor practice and that he's offering permanent replacements to people that he has no business offering them to."
1982.81-1966,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1841.133,1853.377,"Your Honor, I think my answer to that question is that that is a different case, because when the strike is over there is not the same degree of interference with a permitted economic weapon."
1982.81-1966,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1853.377,1856.719,"Well, the strike is over now."
1982.81-1966,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1861.811,1863.309,"Well, future strikes--"
1982.81-1966,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1863.309,1864.12,It's all over.
1982.81-1966,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1864.12,1873.978,"--Future strikes are not over, and if it is known that state actions like this one are permitted there will be an intolerable degree of interference with an employer's economic weapon."
1982.81-1966,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1873.978,1877.882,Let me test your position with a slight hypothetical change here.
1982.81-1966,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1915.835,1917.726,I believe that would be preempted on the same theory.
1982.81-1966,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1924.941,1938.324,"You don't know of any other cases like this, where you just say it's just one of those areas a state court should stay out of, it isn't specifically arguably prohibited or protected?"
1982.81-1966,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1938.324,1941.295,Machinists is certainly comparable to this in many respects.
1982.81-1966,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1956.648,1962.38,Mr. Davenport.
1982.81-1966,2,18785,cecil_davenport,,1962.38,1965.051,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1982.81-1966,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2097.982,2116.301,"Mr. Davenport, could I ask you, suppose the federal labor law said that in a strike, during a strike until it's... at least up until a certain point in a strike, an employer may hire replacements, but he may not hire anybody on a permanent basis."
1982.81-1966,2,18785,cecil_davenport,,2131.575,2136.013,"No, because it would have been preempted by the federal Act."
1982.81-1966,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2136.013,2138.825,"Well, it was just made an illegal contract."
1982.81-1966,2,18785,cecil_davenport,,2138.825,2140.198,That is correct.
1982.81-1966,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2140.198,2170.73,"Well, as I understand the submission on the other side here, that when an unfair labor practice charge is pending such as was pending in this case, it really was an unfair practice, namely, contrary to federal law to promise a permanent job, in which event if that... assume that it turned out that way, that, true, there was an unfair practice and the employer should not run around hiring permanent replacements."
1982.81-1966,2,18785,cecil_davenport,,2177.414,2187.491,"Justice White, I could be wrong, but the statement was made earlier by my colleague that this was a violation."
1982.81-1966,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2207.64,2215.591,"As a matter of fact, the argument is that the right that's being protected here is the right to promise permanent--"
1982.81-1966,2,18785,cecil_davenport,,2215.591,2217.073,That is correct.
1982.81-1966,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2238.952,2252.028,--How do you distinguish in terms of inducement the promise to give permanent employment and an offer to give an increased wage to the replacement people?
1982.81-1966,2,18785,cecil_davenport,,2255.51,2271.502,"Well, apparently under the overall policy and regulations laid down by the Board, the offer of a wage is an unfair inducement to entice off the picket line those back in."
1982.81-1966,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2357.469,2367.651,"Well, it might be stretching it a little bit when it embraces all the policies of the Labor Board or any regulatory agency, but are they not obliged to know the law?"
1982.81-1966,2,18785,cecil_davenport,,2367.651,2375.163,"Yes, they are."
1982.81-1966,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2395.751,2401.324,But that doesn't answer the question if the law is as the Labor Board contends now.
1982.81-1966,2,18785,cecil_davenport,,2401.324,2408.62,"Well, it is not as they contend, Mr. Chief Justice."
1982.81-1966,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2430.765,2452.556,"So you say that even if a... even if an illegal contract isn't enforceable by the promisee, if the other side has also committed a tort against him he can sue him for a tort, which... this suit in here was a suit for fraud as well, wasn't it?"
1982.81-1966,2,18785,cecil_davenport,,2452.556,2455.024,"That is correct, Justice White."
1982.81-1966,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2491.648,2506.081,"Would your position on that, your position as distinguished from the Board, mean that an action for tort might be maintained but an action for contract could not?"
1982.81-1966,2,18785,cecil_davenport,,2518.434,2537.331,"I think not, Mr. Chief Justice, because the position of the Board is that arguably because this arose out of a time when a labor dispute was going on, then under the concept of Garmon and under the Act and the amendments that is preempted, simply because it arose."
1982.81-1966,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2918.109,2930.869,"Well in this context, does anyone need to have any broader definition than that the replacement people would be just as permanent as the persons they replaced?"
1982.81-1966,2,18785,cecil_davenport,,2930.869,2935.1,"I think that is a fair statement, yes."
1982.81-1966,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2935.1,2939.784,"That doesn't mean a contract for life, like life tenure judges."
1982.81-1966,2,18785,cecil_davenport,,2939.784,2946.702,"No, so long as the jobs were available and those conditions existed which were appropriate for them to be employed."
1982.81-1966,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2946.702,2967.412,"Why wouldn't you be fully protected, your clients be fully protected, if the case went to trial, and let's assume hypothetically that first the court, state court, decided that any claim under contract would be preempted, but that he went to try the case on a fraud theory, on tort, and gave a recovery."
1982.81-1966,2,18785,cecil_davenport,,2972.189,2974.279,"I think that's a fair statement, yes, sir."
1982.81-1966,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2974.279,2979.244,But I presume they would prefer having two bases for recovery rather than just one.
1982.81-1966,2,18785,cecil_davenport,,2979.244,2980.68,Absolutely.
1982.81-1966,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2984.1,2987.52,"Well, fraud claims are a little harder to prove."
1982.81-1966,2,18785,cecil_davenport,,2987.52,2989.719,"Yes, sir, it would be five elements."
1982.81-1966,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2989.719,2991.498,"Reliance, and things like that."
1982.81-1966,2,18785,cecil_davenport,,2991.498,3002.444,"Fraud must be made with an intent to decieve, to someone knowing that, presuming that he is going to rely upon it, and that he must rely, and it must be false, and there must be detriment."
1982.81-1966,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3002.444,3008.582,"And in some states, it requires clear and convincing evidence as against a preponderance."
1982.81-1966,2,18785,cecil_davenport,,3008.582,3010.048,That is correct.
1982.81-1966,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3010.048,3012.045,Does that apply in your state?
1982.81-1966,2,18785,cecil_davenport,,3012.045,3015.122,That applies in the fair state of Kentucky.
1982.81-1966,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3443.847,3445.691,"You don't really mean all that, do you?"
1982.81-1966,2,18785,cecil_davenport,,3445.691,3448.19,--Sir?
1982.81-1966,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3448.19,3454.719,You don't really mean that the state courts have been... can adjudicate any kind of a tort without preemption?
1982.81-1966,2,18785,cecil_davenport,,3454.719,3456.325,"Oh, no, no."
1982.81-1966,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3456.325,3457.327,"Well, that's just what you said."
1982.81-1966,2,18785,cecil_davenport,,3457.327,3458.044,I beg your pardon.
1982.81-1966,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3571.813,3572.937,"Thank you, gentlemen."
