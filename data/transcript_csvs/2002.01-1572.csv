2002.01-1572,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.737,"We'll hear argument now in Number 01-1572, Cook County, Illinois versus United States, Ex Rel."
2002.01-1572,0,21127,donnal_m_lach,,11.214,12.231,Thank you.
2002.01-1572,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,109.616,120.335,"Ms. Lach, on that point, am I correct in thinking that the Sherman Act does apply to municipalities?"
2002.01-1572,0,21127,donnal_m_lach,,120.335,132.011,"This Court determined that the... the antitrust statutes, under the antitrust statutes the term, person, does include municipalities, local governments."
2002.01-1572,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,132.011,143.278,"And isn't it true that in the original Sherman Act, imprisonment was authorized for every person who violates the act?"
2002.01-1572,0,21127,donnal_m_lach,,143.278,151.013,"That is true, but we are unaware of any case in which a local government has been prosecuted as a criminal."
2002.01-1572,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,151.013,153.083,But the interpretation of the law on the civil side--
2002.01-1572,0,21127,donnal_m_lach,,153.083,154.219,Yes.
2002.01-1572,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,154.219,161.745,"--was not nullified because there was a provision that said, every person is subject to imprisonment."
2002.01-1572,0,21127,donnal_m_lach,,161.745,200.032,"That is correct, Your Honor, and this Court in the City of Lafayette and City of Boulder, in analyzing the term, person, and determining that municipalities were included within that term, were also faced with the treble damages of the... of the Clayton Act, and subsequent to those two decisions, Congress enacted the Local Government Antitrust Act of 1984, in which Congress specifically took local governments out of the range of the treble damages, and now local governments are subject to injunctive or declaratory relief."
2002.01-1572,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,200.032,219.219,"My... my simple point is that by putting a clearly penal provision in the statute, that did not make municipalities out of the act, and I thought that's what you were arguing, that the 1863 act is penal in part--"
2002.01-1572,0,21127,donnal_m_lach,,219.219,219.832,Yes.
2002.01-1572,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,219.832,222.834,"--and therefore, it could not have in... covered municipalities."
2002.01-1572,0,21127,donnal_m_lach,,222.834,225.064,"Yes, that is... that is what we're arguing."
2002.01-1572,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,225.064,226.264,But that's not true of the Sherman Act.
2002.01-1572,0,21127,donnal_m_lach,,226.264,234.726,"It does not appear to be true of the Sherman Act, but again, we are not aware of any case in which a local government was prosecuted under that act."
2002.01-1572,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,234.726,238.647,Any more than this is a case of prosecution.
2002.01-1572,0,21127,donnal_m_lach,,238.647,246.799,"Any more... that's true, but now, ever since 1878, the False Claims Act has been bifurcated."
2002.01-1572,1,32041,judson_h_miner,,1192.889,1204.292,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
2002.01-1572,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2154.344,2164.463,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2002.01-1572,3,21127,donnal_m_lach,,2783.599,2784.763,Thank you.
2002.01-1572,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2892.112,2895.998,"Ms. Lach, there's one point that you didn't cover in your opening argument--"
2002.01-1572,3,21127,donnal_m_lach,,2895.998,2896.303,--Yes.
2002.01-1572,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2896.303,2899.251,--and I'm curious how you read this statute.
2002.01-1572,3,21127,donnal_m_lach,,2919.764,2924.397,"Well, under the facts of this case, the county was not her employer."
2002.01-1572,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2935.364,2958.044,"Well, whatever, the municipal employer, would... you say that there is no municipal liability for the allegedly ill-gotten gains, but what about retaliation against the whistleblower? Would the act apply against the municipal unit to that extent?"
2002.01-1572,3,21127,donnal_m_lach,,2958.044,3003.331,"--Well, the term employer is not defined in the False Claims Act, but just very recently, 2 weeks ago, on December 31, the Eighth Circuit reached this issue and, without reaching the question of what person means under the False Claims Act, the Eighth Circuit determined that employer has a broader meaning, and allowed an action to proceed against a local government, in that case the St. Louis Housing Authority under, only under the whistleblower provision, and so the whistleblower provision in itself does not indicate that local governments, even if an employee can sue a municipal entity under the whistleblower provision, that does not automatically mean that--"
2002.01-1572,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3003.331,3034.933,"If... if the employer... employee could do that, the... the retaliation provision refers to retaliation against an employee for conduct in furtherance of a False Claims Act action, so if there is no viable False Claims Act claim against a municipality, then I don't see how the retaliation provision could be available."
2002.01-1572,3,21127,donnal_m_lach,,3034.933,3039.746,--The False Claims Act actions may be caused by another party.
2002.01-1572,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3039.746,3043.922,But I'm talking about this very case.
2002.01-1572,3,21127,donnal_m_lach,,3043.922,3044.392,Yes.
2002.01-1572,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3044.392,3046.867,"I mean, if you're right that there's no municipal liability--"
2002.01-1572,3,21127,donnal_m_lach,,3046.867,3048.846,But... but in this case--
2002.01-1572,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3048.846,3056.923,"--especially by Dr. Chandler, do I understand from your last answer that you are saying, no, she's out of luck, the statute would not cover her?"
2002.01-1572,3,21127,donnal_m_lach,,3056.923,3061.594,"--Not against the county, but she still has a retaliation claim against her employer."
2002.01-1572,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3061.594,3062.644,Under what law?
2002.01-1572,3,21127,donnal_m_lach,,3062.644,3064.815,Under the False Claims Act.
2002.01-1572,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3076.502,3078.534,And was that a private corporation?
2002.01-1572,3,21127,donnal_m_lach,,3078.534,3079.78,--It's a not-for-profit.
2002.01-1572,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3085.668,3105.765,"But as far as a municipal employer is concerned, a municipal employer, having retaliated, would be, on your reading of the statute, just as free from responsibility as it would be for the underlying qui tam action."
2002.01-1572,3,21127,donnal_m_lach,,3105.765,3114.506,"--No, under the Eighth Circuit case a municipality can be held liable under the whistleblower provision, even though... I mean to sound very exact--"
2002.01-1572,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3114.506,3115.489,That's what I was asking you about.
2002.01-1572,3,21127,donnal_m_lach,,3115.489,3115.793,--Yes.
2002.01-1572,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3115.793,3118.988,That's what one court has said.
2002.01-1572,3,21127,donnal_m_lach,,3128.759,3148.273,"The cases that have addressed this have noted there... a local government can be in cahoots with another... another entity that submits false claims, the... the local government is aware of it, and the whistleblower is an employee of the local government."
2002.01-1572,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3322.983,3324.925,"Thank you, Ms. Lach."
