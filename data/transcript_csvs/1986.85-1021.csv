1986.85-1021,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,11.684,"We will hear arguments next in No. 85-1021, R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company versus Durham County, North Carolina, et al.--"
1986.85-1021,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,64.412,121.029,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this case presents the question whether North Carolina may consistently with the supremacy clause and the due process and import-export clauses of the constitution impose an ad valorem property tax on tobacco stored in a United States Customs bonded warehouse."
1986.85-1021,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,455.004,457.941,"Of course, we could grant cert anyway, I suppose, couldn't we?"
1986.85-1021,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,457.941,459.191,"Sorry, Your Honor?"
1986.85-1021,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,459.191,460.738,We could grant certiorari anyway.
1986.85-1021,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,460.738,476.716,"You could grant certiorari and I would point out that in three or four of the cases which have been cited by the appellees in their briefs, in their brief where the Court found there was no jurisdiction in all of them certiorari was granted."
1986.85-1021,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,476.716,483.84,"Of course, Mr. Griswold, in the Xerox case the jurisdictional argument was that the decision rested on an adequate state ground."
1986.85-1021,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,487.321,490.46,"No, I do not so understand."
1986.85-1021,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,510.97,513.875,"Well, the immediately preceding sentence was,"
1986.85-1021,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,525.995,529.682,--And the court held this Court did have jurisdiction.
1986.85-1021,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,529.682,534.554,"But in this case, as I understand it, their argument is that there is no challenge to a statute within the meaning of the code."
1986.85-1021,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,536.663,548.612,"Well, here there was a challenge to the statute expressly recognized by the only court which rendered an opinion in North Carolina, and that court held that the statute was constitutional."
1986.85-1021,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,592.265,599.325,"--Well, Mr. Griswold, true, the court said ""we hold"" there, but was that actually a holding?"
1986.85-1021,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,602.543,613.243,"I think not, Your Honor, because this gets back almost to law school analysis of what is the ratio decidendi of the case."
1986.85-1021,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,656.961,665.673,"Well, Mr. Griswold, is it possible, then, that the state could levy its tax and just defer the collection until the goods leave the warehouse?"
1986.85-1021,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,665.673,670.453,Justice O'Connor--
1986.85-1021,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,670.453,671.64,Consistent with the Federal scheme?
1986.85-1021,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,671.64,678.388,--I think that would put the state very close to a violation of the import-export clause.
1986.85-1021,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,692.32,701.456,"Well, maybe the tax could be levied but it just... the collection would be deferred until the goods leave the warehouse, if they are intended for domestic use."
1986.85-1021,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,701.456,711.641,One problem is that in a great many situations you don't know what property is going to be imported and what property is going to be exported.
1986.85-1021,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,931.006,937.785,"Mr. Griswold, supposing we would agree that you are correct entirely about the construction of the Xerox opinion."
1986.85-1021,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,949.905,977.738,"That is an interesting question because I suppose it was a constitutional decision under the supremacy clause, but decisions under the supremacy clause are rather different than decisions under the due process clause or the equal protection clause because it is a decision which remains entirely in the control of Congress."
1986.85-1021,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1336.031,1346.854,"Well, Mr. Griswold, how should that affect our interpretation of what Congress intended so many years ago when it passed the Act that we are asked to apply here?"
1986.85-1021,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1346.854,1357.695,I think this is in part connected with my answer to the Chief Justice's question whether this is a constitutional decision.
1986.85-1021,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1406.192,1417.531,"That extension which you say is an extension of Griswold, by the terms of that statute it applies only as to goods held for exportation, which is the very issue here, whether--"
1986.85-1021,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1417.531,1420.154,"No, no, not at all."
1986.85-1021,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1439.007,1445.894,"--No, the last provision that you read, which you suggested was an expansion of Xerox--"
1986.85-1021,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1445.894,1446.893,--No... I agree--
1986.85-1021,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1446.893,1452.485,--that only applies to domestic goods put into those trade zones for exportation.
1986.85-1021,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1452.485,1453.907,--I agree with that entirely.
1986.85-1021,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1693.89,1695.687,"Thank you, Mr. Griswold."
1986.85-1021,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,1698.203,1719.381,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the basic question in this preemption case is whether the petitioner has met its heavy burden of showing that Congress really intended to take away the power of state and local governments to impose a non-discriminatory property tax under the facts of this case."
1986.85-1021,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1850.389,1860.589,"Mr. Lee, the Xerox opinion contains rather broad language, although on its facts we have there a situation of goods intended for export."
1986.85-1021,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,1883.782,1886.812,"Yes, there is that notion... excuse me."
1986.85-1021,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1886.812,1887.171,Yes.
1986.85-1021,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,1896.309,1897.901,"Well, let me answer it."
1986.85-1021,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1984.259,1987.773,"I think there may be some practical difficulties, too."
1986.85-1021,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,2004.797,2010.498,"--Let me address that question, and I will do so in two steps."
1986.85-1021,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2023.403,2026.98,"Well, but you would certainly have to have in mind what you were going to do."
1986.85-1021,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,2026.98,2028.152,--The next step down the road.
1986.85-1021,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2193.726,2202.316,Is it possible that Congress intended at least that state and local taxes on goods for domestic use be deferred?
1986.85-1021,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,2202.316,2202.894,Might be deferred.
1986.85-1021,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2249.955,2251.784,"It is the same as Xerox, isn't it?"
1986.85-1021,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,2251.784,2252.393,--That is correct.
1986.85-1021,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2255.921,2256.296,Same as Xerox.
1986.85-1021,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,2256.296,2264.763,"--understand what the distinction is between this case and Xerox, and here is where you can't distinguish this case from Xerox."
1986.85-1021,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2311.822,2317.554,Why wouldn't it be an entirely different matter for purposes of assessment of the Federal import tax as well?
1986.85-1021,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,2327.47,2343.402,My answer to that is that that is better a question to be addressed to Congress because what we are dealing with here is how much mileage can you get out of what Congress said and what was their purpose in passing the Warehousing Act.
1986.85-1021,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2343.402,2366.736,"But surely that indicates that Congress had in mind a system under which everything that is in the warehouse is in the warehouse, period, because it makes no more sense to defer the Federal import tax until the point where it is taken out for domestic consumption than it does, as you have described, to prevent the imposition of state property taxes until it is taken out."
1986.85-1021,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,2366.736,2368.61,Two points.
1986.85-1021,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2594.317,2598.082,"What is the amount of tax at stake in this case, Mr. Lee?"
1986.85-1021,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,2598.082,2604.594,"In this particular... this is for 1983, and for the two counties and three cities, it is on the order of $7 to $8 million."
1986.85-1021,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2604.594,2605.547,How much?
1986.85-1021,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,2605.547,2607.203,Seven to eight million dollars.
1986.85-1021,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2607.203,2607.563,Seven to eight million dollars?
1986.85-1021,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,2607.563,2608.391,For the one year.
1986.85-1021,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2710.148,2716.037,"You would think it would be easy, if this is what Congress intended, to get a statute through."
1986.85-1021,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,2726.001,2726.579,Two points.
1986.85-1021,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2804.426,2804.676,"But not much, you don't think."
1986.85-1021,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,2804.676,2805.863,Excuse me?
1986.85-1021,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2805.863,2807.721,"But not much, you don't think?"
1986.85-1021,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,2807.721,2809.596,Barely enough--
1986.85-1021,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2809.596,2815.717,Your argument... your argument... your argument would really lead to just saying that Xerox was just wrong and should be overruled.
1986.85-1021,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,2815.717,2823.09,"--We think Xerox represents, Justice White, the outer limits of what should be good law."
1986.85-1021,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2831.758,2834.835,"Well, eight Justices joined that opinion and that language in it."
1986.85-1021,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,2834.835,2853.64,"--That is correct, and eight Justices who are... very good judgment, and we are not asking... we are not asking that the case be overruled because there is this factual distinction, and it doesn't do a lot of good to parse the Xerox opinion as though it were a statute, and we are not asking the Court to do it."
1986.85-1021,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2853.64,2858.434,But you agree it was in effect a statutory construction.
1986.85-1021,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,2858.434,2860.011,It was in effect a statutory construction question.
1986.85-1021,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2891.298,2892.813,How are they different?
1986.85-1021,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,2892.813,2893.75,Several ways.
1986.85-1021,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2989.915,2994.085,"Mr. Lee, there was an old Treasury Department regulation, was there not--"
1986.85-1021,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,2994.085,2994.507,Yes.
1986.85-1021,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2994.507,2999.77,--that used to say that these state and local taxes were preempted?
1986.85-1021,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,2999.77,3005.721,"It at least would support that notion, and that was repealed."
1986.85-1021,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3176.825,3178.622,Thank you.
1986.85-1021,2,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,3181.293,3184.558,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice."
1986.85-1021,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3232.07,3238.458,Getting a refund of state property taxes is not the easiest task in the world.
1986.85-1021,2,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,3240.614,3243.283,It often presents very serious difficulties.
1986.85-1021,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3284.674,3290.671,Are you clear that those excise taxes are payable when the goods are in the bonded--
1986.85-1021,2,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,3290.671,3291.093,--Yes.
1986.85-1021,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3313.412,3318.301,--Is that the same kind of discrimination that Mr. Lee is telling us about in this case?
1986.85-1021,2,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,3323.3,3326.268,"Yes, it would be a discrimination on that ground."
1986.85-1021,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3349.168,3350.996,"Your time has expired, Mr. Griswold."
