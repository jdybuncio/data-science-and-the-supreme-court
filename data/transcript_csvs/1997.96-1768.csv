1997.96-1768,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.809,"We'll hear argument now in Number 96-1768, C. Elvin Feltner v. Columbia Pictures Television."
1997.96-1768,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,10.903,13.121,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
1997.96-1768,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,100.508,108.021,"The concept of statutory damages has changed some, has it not, from 1856 to 1909?"
1997.96-1768,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,108.021,109.27,Certainly--
1997.96-1768,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,109.27,111.909,"The guidelines, or whatever you want to call it."
1997.96-1768,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,111.909,112.425,--Yes.
1997.96-1768,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,128.356,137.571,I take it in the '56 act there was no opportunity to elect a different damage scheme after verdict but before a judgment as there is in the current act.
1997.96-1768,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,137.571,138.274,That's right.
1997.96-1768,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,144.256,164.733,"So if we followed your reasoning in this case, as I think your opponents have pointed out, we would have to accept as a consequence that a jury could render its verdict on actual damages, be discharged, go home, and at that point the election could be made to go for statutory damages, and I don't know what happens then."
1997.96-1768,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,167.31,169.106,That's a false problem.
1997.96-1768,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,173.979,174.464,"But it could happen, couldn't it?"
1997.96-1768,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,174.464,175.698,--I don't think so.
1997.96-1768,1,28264,henry_j_tashman,,1467.054,1479.768,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court--"
1997.96-1768,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1556.924,1563.438,Did the Tull footnote 7 in effect say that's not a consideration that should influence--
1997.96-1768,1,28264,henry_j_tashman,,1563.438,1564.39,"No, it didn't."
1997.96-1768,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1628.396,1659.727,"--Mr. Tashman, if I follow your argument correctly, then if a copyright holder comes in at the outset and says, I want the court to find that there has been an infringement and I want statutory damages, I don't want any other kind of damages, could such a plaintiff then avoid having a jury trial on the question of infringement?"
1997.96-1768,1,28264,henry_j_tashman,,1661.601,1662.242,Absolutely.
1997.96-1768,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1707.692,1714.892,"There seems to be a debate about what... the number of infringements, whether that was, in fact, a summary judgment--"
1997.96-1768,1,28264,henry_j_tashman,,1714.892,1716.282,"--Oh, there's no question about it."
1997.96-1768,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1735.963,1739.57,--But whether each episode counts as a work.
1997.96-1768,1,28264,henry_j_tashman,,1739.57,1740.225,Correct.
1997.96-1768,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1740.225,1743.818,Mr. Roberts said that is a mixed question of law and fact.
1997.96-1768,1,28264,henry_j_tashman,,1743.818,1749.175,"It is, except in this case there was no dispute as to the facts, and we don't dispute the facts."
1997.96-1768,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1773.621,1792.565,"Well, I don't want to distract you with a question that would be peculiar just to this case, but I think you have made an important clarification that in your argument statutory damages are just like injunctive relief, so if you come into the court and say, all I want is an injunction, then the infringement will be determined by the court as well."
1997.96-1768,1,28264,henry_j_tashman,,1804.028,1811.824,"Yes, I think that would flow once the court, or if the court characterized the statutory damages as an equitable remedy and an equitable--"
1997.96-1768,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1811.824,1812.402,Why didn't the--
1997.96-1768,1,28264,henry_j_tashman,,1838.656,1841.046,"--Well, there's a huge amount of discretion involved."
1997.96-1768,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3183.865,3186.349,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1997.96-1768,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3197.453,3205.496,They returned general verdicts where there was a statutory specified amount for each sheet?
1997.96-1768,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3205.496,3205.981,Sure.
1997.96-1768,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3209.605,3212.666,"But I mean, it wasn't a great mystery what the calculation ought to be."
1997.96-1768,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3212.666,3213.056,No.
1997.96-1768,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3295.352,3296.586,"So we'd have to overrule Tull, in your view."
1997.96-1768,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3296.586,3297.305,--No.
1997.96-1768,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3315.936,3317.577,"Thank you, Mr. Roberts."
