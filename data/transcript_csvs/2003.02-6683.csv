2003.02-6683,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.825,"We'll hear argument next in No. 02-6683, Hernan O'Ryan Castro v. the United States."
2003.02-6683,0,35857,michael__g_frick,,55.728,58.7,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2003.02-6683,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,103.298,108.817,Is recharacterization pretty much of a judge-made thing?
2003.02-6683,0,35857,michael__g_frick,,111.456,112.753,That is absolutely correct.
2003.02-6683,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,147.166,148.075,"Well, what's the difference in the two?"
2003.02-6683,0,35857,michael__g_frick,,155.134,155.505,"Yes, Your Honor."
2003.02-6683,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,155.505,159.426,When do I recharacterize it?
2003.02-6683,0,35857,michael__g_frick,,159.426,188.942,"Justice Kennedy, at the present time recharacterization in our opinion should only be done at such time as the court determines that there is absolutely no viable way that it's going to be able to take the document as pleaded under the title that it's given to the court and effectuate a remedy therefrom."
2003.02-6683,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,211.522,214.949,"Well, I... I understand that... that argument of yours."
2003.02-6683,0,35857,michael__g_frick,,214.949,215.216,"--Yes, sir."
2003.02-6683,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,215.216,225.147,But what I'm asking is what is... what factors does the judge take into account or should take into account when he or she is asked to recharacterize the motion?
2003.02-6683,0,35857,michael__g_frick,,241.987,251.812,"Yes, sir, and I do not believe that it is the Government's part to ask the court to recharacterize something."
2003.02-6683,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,251.812,253.67,Is there any authority for that?
2003.02-6683,0,35857,michael__g_frick,,257.385,258.666,"No, Your Honor."
2003.02-6683,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,258.87,262.381,"--some practice book to know when I can recharacterize, when I can't?"
2003.02-6683,0,35857,michael__g_frick,,262.381,283.353,"--No, Your Honor, but the D.C. Circuit... but first of all, all of the cases that we have cited except for the Eleventh Circuit and the Fifth Circuit have addressed issues, have addressed circumstances under which recharacterization was done of certain motions that were pleaded in order to help ostensibly the individual who pled the motion."
2003.02-6683,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,283.353,291.898,"But here the Government and the trial court the first time around just said they would have no objection, didn't they, having treated it as a 2254?"
2003.02-6683,0,35857,michael__g_frick,,295.734,299.161,"No, they did not ask that it be recharacterized, Your Honor."
2003.02-6683,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,348.739,356.086,"And when you say a proper rule 33 motion, you don't necessarily mean one on which relief will be granted I take it."
2003.02-6683,0,35857,michael__g_frick,,356.086,356.746,"No, Your Honor."
2003.02-6683,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,370.659,378.46,It was the Government who intruded 2255 into this case.
2003.02-6683,0,35857,michael__g_frick,,392.041,418.13,"--That's absolutely correct, Justice Ginsburg, and the court... the district court's order, interestingly enough, starts out by saying we have before us Hernan O'Ryan Castro's motion for a new trial under rule 33, and then it ends in conclusion by stating for the above reasons, we deny Hernan O'Ryan Castro's rule 33 motion for new trial."
2003.02-6683,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,436.213,441.802,"Well, let's get exactly straight what the Government said because I had thought the Government said it have... it would have no objection."
2003.02-6683,0,35857,michael__g_frick,,445.045,447.275,"Your Honor, if I stated that, I'm incorrect."
2003.02-6683,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,456.768,459.552,But no one had proposed it other than the Government.
2003.02-6683,0,35857,michael__g_frick,,459.552,460.855,That's correct.
2003.02-6683,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,465.563,468.84,"And the Government was... I take it, was intending to be helpful."
2003.02-6683,0,35857,michael__g_frick,,482.858,483.989,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2003.02-6683,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,519.267,525.294,And what... at what point did Mr. Castro get representation?
2003.02-6683,0,35857,michael__g_frick,,527.856,528.516,"Absolutely not, Your Honor."
2003.02-6683,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,563.522,567.276,So throughout the original rule--
2003.02-6683,0,35857,michael__g_frick,,567.276,568.102,Totally pro se.
2003.02-6683,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,568.102,575.904,"--And even when he... his first styled 2255, he was still pro se until that one went up on appeal."
2003.02-6683,0,35857,michael__g_frick,,575.904,577.557,"Yes, Justice Ginsburg, that's correct."
2003.02-6683,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,577.557,584.244,"And pro se, Castro filed an appeal from the merits determination of the district court?"
2003.02-6683,0,35857,michael__g_frick,,584.244,585.813,"Yes, Justice O'Connor, that's correct."
2003.02-6683,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,585.813,592.805,"But didn't raise, as an issue, the treatment of his... the recharacterization--"
2003.02-6683,0,35857,michael__g_frick,,592.805,593.532,That is correct.
2003.02-6683,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,593.532,595.39,--to also consider--
2003.02-6683,0,35857,michael__g_frick,,595.39,599.105,That was not raised... that was not raised as an issue by him at that point in time.
2003.02-6683,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,599.105,601.129,--And what are we to make of that?
2003.02-6683,0,35857,michael__g_frick,,601.129,603.729,"Your Honor, I would suggest that we make nothing of it."
2003.02-6683,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,620.365,625.937,"At the time Mr. Castro appealed, had AEDPA been enacted?"
2003.02-6683,0,35857,michael__g_frick,,625.937,628.455,At the time that he appealed?
2003.02-6683,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,628.455,629.198,Mm-hum.
2003.02-6683,0,35857,michael__g_frick,,641.996,643.044,"I... I'm sorry, Your Honor."
2003.02-6683,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,643.044,643.044,But--
2003.02-6683,0,35857,michael__g_frick,,643.044,645.645,We... we have two or three different appeals.
2003.02-6683,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,645.645,662.818,"--I thought, frankly, that he had appealed in March of 1996 and AEDPA was enacted in April."
2003.02-6683,0,35857,michael__g_frick,,662.818,663.356,"Yes, Your Honor."
2003.02-6683,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,707.196,722.8,"Now, that... that would mean that when the district court decided to treat this as being under either or both of those provisions, it was doing him no harm, AEDPA not yet being in existence."
2003.02-6683,0,35857,michael__g_frick,,723.171,726.969,"I believe that that was the... yes, Your Honor."
2003.02-6683,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,729.858,735.226,It's only the subsequent enactment of AEDPA that caused the recharacterization to be harmful to him.
2003.02-6683,0,35857,michael__g_frick,,735.226,752.028,"--Yes, Your Honor, and not only that, but not only was this a pre-AEDPA filing of the rule 33 plus recharacterization at that time, it was a denial of the... that relief, that joint relief, pre-AEDPA."
2003.02-6683,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,752.028,775.805,"What do you make of the argument on the other side that although, of course, there was no AEDPA at that point, we did have a... a structure of... of rules governing abuse of the writ and second and successive petitions and that he would have... he would have run afoul of those rules, or at least there was reason to be concerned that he might run afoul of those rules, and therefore, the enactment of AEDPA really shouldn't make any difference in our analysis?"
2003.02-6683,0,35857,michael__g_frick,,775.805,790.788,"Well, Your Honor, I... the Government's brief seems to pretty much equate abuse of the writ with the restrictions placed under 2255."
2003.02-6683,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,790.788,794.957,"And I'll... I'll stipulate here that they're... you know, they're not exactly identical."
2003.02-6683,0,35857,michael__g_frick,,815.928,816.3,"Yes, sir."
2003.02-6683,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,836.612,836.817,Right.
2003.02-6683,0,35857,michael__g_frick,,838.942,851.202,I say that there is a significant difference as stated by those other circuits between the difficulty in getting a second petition filed under abuse of the writ.
2003.02-6683,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,854.879,863.795,"Is... is the... is the basic difference that you have to go to the court of appeals and that's a tough standard, whereas under our prior law, you... you didn't have to go through that step?"
2003.02-6683,0,35857,michael__g_frick,,863.795,866.434,"That would certainly be one of the differences, Your Honor."
2003.02-6683,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,890.749,908.666,"Well, but isn't... isn't there another point that filing a legitimate... maybe... on the merits motion for new trial on ground A and later... and... and having it denied, then later filing a 2255 on ground B under our abuse of the writ doctrine... that would not have been an abuse of the writ, would it?"
2003.02-6683,0,35857,michael__g_frick,,908.666,910.235,"That's correct, Justice Stevens."
2003.02-6683,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,947.591,973.682,"But as far as raising a question on appeal, it's more likely, if he had counsel, that the pro se prisoner gets to see a document that starts out by saying you made a rule 33 motion, and the bottom line is, as you pointed out, your motion is denied, and that 2255 comes up only in the body of the opinion."
2003.02-6683,0,35857,michael__g_frick,,986.807,987.179,"Yes, Your Honor."
2003.02-6683,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,987.922,997.953,Would he have been able to appeal the trial court's treatment of it as... as under the habeas provision?
2003.02-6683,0,35857,michael__g_frick,,1003.775,1007.407,"Your Honor, I don't know what point he would have appealed."
2003.02-6683,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1043.998,1051.263,"--Well, even... even if it wasn't necessary, he would have had to go to appeal saying I agree with the judgment below."
2003.02-6683,0,35857,michael__g_frick,,1073.265,1073.72,"Yes, Your Honor."
2003.02-6683,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1166.145,1173.947,"One thing you might touch on, Mr. Frick, during the course, the Government contends we don't have jurisdiction over this petition."
2003.02-6683,0,35857,michael__g_frick,,1175.804,1176.426,Yes.
2003.02-6683,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1176.426,1177.54,--at some point.
2003.02-6683,0,35857,michael__g_frick,,1177.54,1179.398,"Thank you, Chief Justice Rehnquist."
2003.02-6683,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1412.857,1415.086,"As I understand your position, though, you don't even have to read strict construction."
2003.02-6683,0,35857,michael__g_frick,,1428.46,1429.575,"That is correct, Your Honor."
2003.02-6683,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1440.97,1458.636,"Mr. Frick, the other... some of the other courts of appeals have given the district court instructions about how they should deal with cases of recharacterization."
2003.02-6683,0,35857,michael__g_frick,,1458.636,1460.001,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2003.02-6683,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1460.001,1461.131,Those tests are not identical.
2003.02-6683,0,35857,michael__g_frick,,1469.948,1551.144,"Your Honor, I believe that the... the Second Circuit Adams case sets forth probably the best bright line test, that being that the petitioner... that... that when a court has a petition that it thinks would better be served as recharacterized, that they should inform the petitioner first that they believe it should be recharacterized in order for them to grant relief, that it should be recharacterized as a 2255, obtain the consent of the petitioner, and if they don't obtain the consent of the petitioner, then offer the petitioner the opportunity to withdraw the petition and file it at a later point in time, assuming that it can be refiled at some point in time, and not be... not run into problems with the statute of limitations, or at least tell the petitioner that it is going to consider this recharacterized and they've got 5 days, 10 days to add any other constitutional claims that would appropriately be brought under a 2255 before they will rule on it so that--"
2003.02-6683,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1551.144,1554.382,Is recharacterization done only with pro se litigants?
2003.02-6683,0,35857,michael__g_frick,,1567.014,1580.183,"--Chief Justice Rehnquist, there are circumstances I understand, not from personal knowledge, where recharacterization does take place in spite of the fact that there is an attorney."
2003.02-6683,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1593.763,1603.423,"But... but you... you want us to simply adopt a rule for what happens, what warnings have to be given, what requirements have to be met, when there's recharacterization."
2003.02-6683,0,35857,michael__g_frick,,1607.759,1614.325,"--I think when recharacterization is appropriate, it's appropriate."
2003.02-6683,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1614.325,1615.644,You're not asking us to address the... the--
2003.02-6683,0,35857,michael__g_frick,,1615.644,1617.213,"Yes, Your Honor."
2003.02-6683,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1657.216,1658.452,"--Very well, Mr. Frick."
2003.02-6683,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,1660.475,1669.68,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2003.02-6683,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1681.197,1684.791,But that's only if you know that it's a second or a successive petition.
2003.02-6683,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,1684.791,1708.029,"Justice Stevens, the interpretive question we think that's presented, as far as the jurisdictional issue goes, is whether a denial of authorization is simply a finding that the gatekeeping requirements have not been satisfied or rather whether it encompasses both that determination and the subsidiary determination that the motion is in fact second or successive."
2003.02-6683,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1711.001,1720.389,Is... is it your view that the Court would never have jurisdiction to review a determination by a court of appeals that a petition was or was not a second or successive?
2003.02-6683,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,1720.389,1720.911,No.
2003.02-6683,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1746.562,1749.99,So our jurisdiction depends on how the court of appeals resolved the issue.
2003.02-6683,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,1749.99,1752.795,--That's right.
2003.02-6683,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1757.253,1759.006,I don't understand your second instance.
2003.02-6683,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,1759.006,1763.836,The second instance... let me back up to try to answer that as clearly as I can.
2003.02-6683,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1858.414,1886.566,"So in any case, your view is no matter how absurd, if a... the court of appeals says a 60(b) motion is second or successive, if they say a complaint in a 1983 action is a second or successive habeas petition, no matter how absurd, once the court of appeals says this is a second or successive application, nobody has any right to appeal here, even though that isn't what the statute says."
2003.02-6683,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,1886.566,1893.336,"So long as there is a grant or denial of authorization, the court of appeals' decision cannot be second-guessed."
2003.02-6683,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1893.336,1908.94,"Now, why would we... why would we interpret a statute that doesn't say that to... what it says is, it says that they shall not file a second or successive application, in other words, if it is a second or successive application."
2003.02-6683,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,1927.805,1943.203,The interpretive question is whether a denial of authorization under 2244(b)(3)(E) is simply a finding that the gatekeeping requirements haven't been satisfied or whether it's both that and the subsidiary finding that the motion is second or successive.
2003.02-6683,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1962.522,1968.056,"Well, but that's... you... you call it a subsidiary question, whether or not it's second or successive."
2003.02-6683,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,1971.81,1972.803,"Well, we think it is."
2003.02-6683,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1972.803,1975.608,And why isn't it... why isn't it a predicate?
2003.02-6683,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,1987.664,1991.834,"We think the statute does say that, Justice Kennedy, for two reasons."
2003.02-6683,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2042.609,2055.818,"Well, at the very least, if the statute is ambiguous, it seems to me you have to answer Justice Breyer's concern that an erroneous determination here can foreclose the petitioner from exercising some very important rights."
2003.02-6683,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,2055.818,2060.813,Our view is that the statute is not ambiguous.
2003.02-6683,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2074.931,2076.955,Sometimes there might be a constitutional question.
2003.02-6683,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,2112.826,2128.308,"Well, Justice Breyer, you could imagine a case where there is a very serious constitutional claim raised, but there's absolutely no dispute that it's being raised in a second or successive motion, and the defendant can't satisfy at the substantive gatekeeping requirements."
2003.02-6683,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2151.341,2151.713,And one final thing.
2003.02-6683,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,2182.51,2189.319,"What my opponent is appealing is the court of appeals' decision, which is a single order, which does two things."
2003.02-6683,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2208.145,2217.722,But what do you say to his point that he didn't even try to file a... try to seek an authorization to file a second or successive because he never thought it was a second or successive?
2003.02-6683,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,2221.148,2222.634,"That's true, Justice Stevens."
2003.02-6683,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2222.634,2224.492,So how can you have denied such an authorization?
2003.02-6683,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,2224.492,2242.508,"Well, it's... as... as I've said, the ordinary way that a defendant is able to challenge a district court's determination that his motion is second or successive in the court of appeals is not via appeal because ordinarily either the case has been transferred or he can't get a certificate of appealability."
2003.02-6683,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2248.618,2251.59,"But, of course, he didn't file an authorization motion in this case."
2003.02-6683,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,2251.59,2252.251,--That's true.
2003.02-6683,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2303.62,2315.409,"Why didn't the U.S. attorney who said, Your Honor, I don't object... this is a rule 33 motion, but introduced 2255."
2003.02-6683,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,2353.1,2360.901,"--Justice Ginsburg, we do not defend what was done in the district court in connection with the first post... post-conviction motion."
2003.02-6683,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2362.199,2367.55,"Well, wasn't that all... didn't that occur before AEDPA had been passed?"
2003.02-6683,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,2367.55,2369.408,"--Yes, it did, Justice O'Connor."
2003.02-6683,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2369.408,2373.949,Were there the same consequences then as there were post-AEDPA?
2003.02-6683,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,2373.949,2378.324,In... in some respects they were the same; in some respects they were different.
2003.02-6683,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2412.464,2417.5,"Well, he... he never... he did not in the district court file such a motion."
2003.02-6683,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,2432.443,2434.468,"--That's true, Justice O'Connor, and--"
2003.02-6683,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2434.468,2437.895,And there was no enactment at that time of AEDPA.
2003.02-6683,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,2437.895,2440.328,--That... that is true as well.
2003.02-6683,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2460.224,2494.487,"Well, this... this business of having a court recharacterize a motion as a 2255 motion was a doctrine that seems to have been developed before AEDPA was enacted, and some circuits since the enactment of AEDPA have decided that if they're going... if the district court is going to do that, that some notice should be given, certainly to a pro se petitioner, about the consequences of that recharacterization."
2003.02-6683,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,2502.66,2515.542,"Justice O'Connor, we have no objection in principle to requiring that... to... to a rule requiring that a district court provide a defendant with notice before characterizing a post-conviction motion as a 2255 motion."
2003.02-6683,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2516.823,2522.601,"If we were to do it, which... which version would be the best?"
2003.02-6683,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,2522.601,2523.881,"--Well, I'll answer that question."
2003.02-6683,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2546.173,2553.437,"Mr. Himmelfarb, the... the reality is we have a pro se litigant who loses in the district court."
2003.02-6683,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,2620.272,2623.903,"Justice Ginsburg, we don't think that's the case at all."
2003.02-6683,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2630.113,2634.1,The right to know the consequences of what you're doing.
2003.02-6683,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,2655.565,2664.193,"--The... the defendant in this case, petitioner, did litigate the question of characterization."
2003.02-6683,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2698.744,2702.542,"Yes, but my question to you is, did he have any reason to know?"
2003.02-6683,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,2728.837,2747.124,"We don't think that the fact that he is pro se should have any part in the analysis because that would create all sorts of difficulties in other AEDPA cases where you have difficult questions, particularly difficult, perhaps byzantine, procedural rules that a petitioner is obligated to follow."
2003.02-6683,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2747.124,2754.722,"Well, usually courts do their best when they deal with pro se litigants to have them understand what's going on."
2003.02-6683,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,2766.693,2769.294,"That's true, Justice Ginsburg."
2003.02-6683,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2774.539,2779.49,"Yes, but you're not relying on AEDPA on this branch of the case."
2003.02-6683,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,2796.459,2810.121,"--That's true, Justice Ginsburg, but even before AEDPA, the rules governing post-conviction litigation could be quite difficult to navigate, and even before AEDPA, most post-conviction litigation was carried out pro se."
2003.02-6683,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2814.829,2815.777,But you just... you just agreed.
2003.02-6683,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,2839.471,2843.558,"--Justice Ginsburg, I don't want to leave the Court with that impression."
2003.02-6683,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2853.217,2854.498,"In principle, you have no objection."
2003.02-6683,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,2855.446,2857.57,In practice as well.
2003.02-6683,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2902.318,2908.74,"Is... is there one of the circuits that has taken the position that you, in principle and in practice, would say is a sound one?"
2003.02-6683,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,2908.74,2925.086,"--I think if... if we had to choose, we would prefer the Third Circuit's rule under which essentially there are three options when a post-conviction motion, not styled a 2255 motion, is filed."
2003.02-6683,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2942.259,2946.634,"See, do you think on that... that... you're now answering Justice O'Connor's question which is just what I was interested in."
2003.02-6683,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,3066.021,3092.027,"--Our view is that the First Circuit's view, which does not require notice but simply says that if there is no notice, the second motion is deemed to be a first motion, should not be adopted because we think it's inconsistent with the basic principle of post-conviction litigation, which we're urging this Court to adopt in this case, that you have to file your challenges to rulings made against you at the earliest possible opportunity."
2003.02-6683,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3097.478,3098.964,"Yes, but I think you're missing... say... say the same content."
2003.02-6683,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,3132.567,3132.833,We don't--
2003.02-6683,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3132.833,3133.742,Am I being clear to you?
2003.02-6683,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,3133.742,3134.114,--Yes.
2003.02-6683,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3170.978,3175.929,"I'm sure that's right, but you... you think we should go into the rule-writing business, say, in our supervisory capacity."
2003.02-6683,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,3192.359,3192.731,No.
2003.02-6683,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3193.353,3198.47,"If we... I know you don't really, but I mean, if we get to that point and we've... we reject your other two."
2003.02-6683,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,3198.47,3206.272,"--To the extent that the Court wishes to impose a notice requirement, our view is that it should go essentially like this."
2003.02-6683,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3252.257,3260.885,"Wouldn't it... wouldn't it be much simpler just to say if a district court recharacterizes, it must do this without going into when or why you should recharacterize?"
2003.02-6683,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,3260.885,3265.056,"It probably... I think it would, Mr. Chief Justice."
2003.02-6683,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3282.024,3285.944,But didn't the... doesn't that... isn't that included in the Third Circuit formulation?
2003.02-6683,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,3285.944,3287.697,I think it may well be.
2003.02-6683,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3297.318,3298.061,Why do you want--
2003.02-6683,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3298.061,3309.54,--You should give an opportunity to... to say I'll withdraw my petition or I'll amend my petition to say everything that I could say under the heading of 2255.
2003.02-6683,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,3309.54,3326.768,"--Our view is that giving notice of an intent to recharacterize puts the defendant in the same position as one who filed a self-styled 2255, and under the law of post-conviction litigation, such a defendant is held responsible for the consequences of filing that motion."
2003.02-6683,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3326.768,3330.383,That's not the position that any of the circuits have taken.
2003.02-6683,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,3330.383,3332.491,I think that... I think that's probably right.
2003.02-6683,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3350.628,3363.038,"Isn't there a difference between a case in which a litigant makes up his mind to file a 2255... presumably he should have found out what's the consequence of that... and the situation in which he files something else and the judge says, I'm going to change it?"
2003.02-6683,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,3366.465,3389.294,"--Justice Stevens, the way we envision the regime working is that the motion is filed and the district court issues an order which it serves on parties, giving notice that it intends to recharacterize and some amount of time will elapse before the defendant is obligated to come back to the court and tell the court whether it wishes for the court to go forward with recharacterization or allow him to withdraw."
2003.02-6683,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3391.03,3398.56,But you would say the recharacterization could not take place until after there was that time... notice and a time to accept or object to it.
2003.02-6683,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,3398.56,3398.81,--That's right.
2003.02-6683,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3400.789,3402.07,"Which, of course, didn't happen here."
2003.02-6683,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,3402.07,3403.218,--That's true.
2003.02-6683,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3404.754,3418.462,"The... the point of implausibility I... I have with your argument is that when the district... your argument to the effect that no notice of consequence needs to be given, merely a notice that recharacterization will take place."
2003.02-6683,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,3480.422,3487.686,"Justice Souter, the... the purpose of helping defendants is not the only reason for recharacterization."
2003.02-6683,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3499.963,3501.682,"Thank you, Mr. Himmelfarb."
2003.02-6683,2,35857,michael__g_frick,,3504.116,3508.658,"Your Honor, if there are no further questions, we would waive rebuttal."
2003.02-6683,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3508.658,3510.348,The case is submitted.
2003.02-6683,3,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,3511.009,3511.009,"--Thank you, Your Honor."
