1996.96-79,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.858,"We'll hear argument next in Number 96-79, Sandra Jean Dale Boggs v. Thomas F. Boggs, et al.--"
1996.96-79,0,36211,marian_m_livaudais,,56.778,59.609,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1996.96-79,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,107.761,115.047,"Well, doesn't your position raise a significant takings issue right off the bat?"
1996.96-79,0,36211,marian_m_livaudais,,115.047,115.816,I don't--
1996.96-79,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,115.816,155.293,"Because a State recognizes a community property interest in something like a husband's retirement plan or other assets that he has acquired during the marriage by virtue of his efforts, that law creates... a community property law would create a property right in the spouse to half of whatever that asset is, and along comes an ERISA law later... after this marriage, the first marriage had been in existence and she had an interest there, along comes ERISA."
1996.96-79,0,36211,marian_m_livaudais,,160.446,162.238,"--No, Your Honor."
1996.96-79,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,163.528,165.09,What's wrong with that analysis?
1996.96-79,0,36211,marian_m_livaudais,,165.09,167.241,"--Well, there are two problems."
1996.96-79,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,181.0,189.494,But that was a statute that had gone into effect and no one claimed that there was a prior thing that was affected by the statute.
1996.96-79,0,36211,marian_m_livaudais,,195.658,207.907,"This... well, at the time that ERISA comes along it preempts State law, the State community property law, so that it is inapplicable."
1996.96-79,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,207.907,218.606,"Well, I... I'm not sure that's right, but even if it were, it would constitute a taking of the wife's interest acquired to that date."
1996.96-79,0,36211,marian_m_livaudais,,218.606,220.806,Acquired to that date.
1996.96-79,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,244.011,261.884,"Well, under community property law in Louisiana she owned half of whatever he made from 1949 till ERISA at least was passed, and ERISA, even if you give it effect, can't take that without giving her compensation."
1996.96-79,0,36211,marian_m_livaudais,,261.884,276.482,Her compensation was the anticipation of the benefits she would have received had she become... had she lived long enough to receive them coming out of the back end of the... a retirement program.
1996.96-79,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,276.482,283.537,"Yes, but the Government can't simply substitute one piece of property for another piece of property without them being somehow equal."
1996.96-79,0,36211,marian_m_livaudais,,292.802,299.277,Her anticipated benefits were... she received through the Federal program.
1996.96-79,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,305.52,307.801,"Yes, but that was a Government life insurance policy."
1996.96-79,0,36211,marian_m_livaudais,,309.223,325.634,"--Well, to the extent that the benefits she would receive as a... had she lived to participate in the retirement benefits are so much greater, and fuels... it's really tax dollars."
1996.96-79,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,340.985,343.886,What she would get by outliving her husband isn't what troubles me.
1996.96-79,0,36211,marian_m_livaudais,,374.527,376.657,--Not... no.
1996.96-79,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,377.809,389.606,"In a community property State, isn't his entitlement to the retirement benefits really an entitlement that's half hers, and that does continue, whether she dies or not."
1996.96-79,0,36211,marian_m_livaudais,,389.606,403.255,"--She's entitled, as a... as the wife of the participant during retirement she would receive benefits and would enjoy the retirement benefits."
1996.96-79,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,403.255,409.319,"Justice Scalia is completely capable of protecting his own question, but it seems to me that he's asking you--"
1996.96-79,0,36211,marian_m_livaudais,,449.515,452.496,"I think so, yes, but--"
1996.96-79,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,452.496,462.744,"Well, is it the case, then, if there had been no ERISA at all, would the first wife have had something to bequeath by will?"
1996.96-79,0,36211,marian_m_livaudais,,464.454,464.765,--Yes.
1996.96-79,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,464.765,465.937,So that premise is correct.
1996.96-79,0,36211,marian_m_livaudais,,465.937,466.547,That is correct.
1996.96-79,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,466.547,473.8,"I find that troubling, but what I'm not clear on is whether I have to reach that particular trouble."
1996.96-79,0,36211,marian_m_livaudais,,479.244,479.945,"No, they haven't."
1996.96-79,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,479.945,485.498,May I also ask in that... does the record tell us when the husband's pension benefits vested?
1996.96-79,0,36211,marian_m_livaudais,,485.498,489.502,"No, I... well, I can't answer that."
1996.96-79,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,490.811,492.814,I couldn't find it myself.
1996.96-79,0,36211,marian_m_livaudais,,492.814,496.057,But it really wasn't considered to be important.
1996.96-79,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,497.366,501.801,"But it would... of course, it would be important if you're claiming there was a taking of vested benefits."
1996.96-79,0,36211,marian_m_livaudais,,504.922,506.822,--They vested during his first marriage to--
1996.96-79,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,506.822,511.066,"But surely they didn't vest in 1949, when he first started paying in."
1996.96-79,0,36211,marian_m_livaudais,,511.066,511.245,--No.
1996.96-79,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,511.245,511.685,No.
1996.96-79,0,36211,marian_m_livaudais,,523.332,544.627,"Well, the result there is that if that... if you reach that and you say that there is no preemption, then State law in effect redefines who the beneficiaries of ERISA are, because if you say that there is no preemption of the community property law, then the nonparticipant spouse becomes--"
1996.96-79,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,544.627,545.879,"Well, not at all."
1996.96-79,0,36211,marian_m_livaudais,,595.681,604.136,"--But the... well, you have to start with the premise that she has a property interest--"
1996.96-79,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,604.136,604.817,Absolutely.
1996.96-79,0,36211,marian_m_livaudais,,604.817,605.138,--in the plan.
1996.96-79,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,605.138,606.498,Absolutely.
1996.96-79,0,36211,marian_m_livaudais,,606.498,608.35,Because without a property interest in the plan--
1996.96-79,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,1223.705,1224.745,Yes.
1996.96-79,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1255.186,1258.768,"But under that, do you... there's been a taking here--"
1996.96-79,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,1258.768,1259.487,--I--
1996.96-79,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1259.487,1268.456,--and we normally would avoid resting on some constitutional ground if we can possibly construe the statute some other way.
1996.96-79,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,1268.456,1273.929,"--Well, obviously we disagree that there's a taking here, and I'd like to address that first."
1996.96-79,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1300.375,1302.518,That's not my understanding.
1996.96-79,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,1304.669,1320.7,"Well, we don't know whether the benefits had vested, but even if the benefits had vested, Justice Stevens, I think in effect the only thing that has been removed from her property interest here is the right to make a testamentary distribution of those benefits."
1996.96-79,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1320.7,1330.756,"She had a right under Louisiana law, I presume, if it's like most community... to prevent any expenditures in fraud of the community."
1996.96-79,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,1333.767,1346.717,"One would... I mean, one would also have to consider the plan to see that... those might have provided her with some protections also, but what she can't do as a result of ERISA here is pass on her interest to her children."
1996.96-79,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1346.717,1349.639,--Which is certainly one stick in a bundle of rights.
1996.96-79,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,1349.639,1355.292,"It is one, but I don't think that the removal of that right amounts to a taking, because, for example--"
1996.96-79,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1355.292,1357.513,"Well, let's just say no will."
1996.96-79,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,1368.342,1377.345,"--But what Louisiana could have passed... I mean, by hypothesis Louisiana could have passed a law that said no, when she died her interest had to go to her husband."
1996.96-79,2,22185,edward_j_deano_jr,,1794.478,1807.909,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1996.96-79,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1812.089,1815.763,"I'd like to ask you a question, but I'm afraid you're going to agree with me."
1996.96-79,2,22185,edward_j_deano_jr,,1864.236,1879.447,"First of all, with regard to the lump sum payments, clearly the antialienation provisions, once they've been paid out of the plan, don't apply, and there's a whole line of jurisprudence that sets that out."
1996.96-79,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1938.024,1947.451,"Your part, the part that you want to answer directly is the other part, I guess, which is 29 U.S.C. 1055 has, like, about 15, or 10, or 5 specific--"
1996.96-79,2,22185,edward_j_deano_jr,,1947.451,1947.902,"Well, I--"
1996.96-79,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1947.902,1959.97,"--things that are supposed to happen to these pensions, and that, why doesn't that preempt community relations... community property law insofar as it's to the contrary?"
1996.96-79,2,22185,edward_j_deano_jr,,1959.97,1982.142,"--I think Justice O'Connor drew a point that I think is very salient to that, and that is whether or not a probate order should be defined, or should be able to be qualified as a QDRO, and it's very interesting, I think, to take a look at the antialienation provision in 1056."
1996.96-79,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2070.443,2075.607,"What I was thinking of is, I think there's a provision that says you have an annuity, and your employer gives you an annuity."
1996.96-79,2,22185,edward_j_deano_jr,,2083.531,2084.922,--That's correct.
1996.96-79,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2084.922,2085.181,All right.
1996.96-79,2,22185,edward_j_deano_jr,,2101.694,2112.3,"Because this Court has decided that those types of conflicts are treated in the context of the antialienation provisions, not the preemption provisions."
1996.96-79,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2112.3,2113.001,"Well then, why?"
1996.96-79,2,22185,edward_j_deano_jr,,2139.889,2151.126,Because the provision that provides for the annuity is a directive to a plan to provide for that annuity in its plan.
1996.96-79,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2167.525,2169.507,So Congress doesn't care what the result is.
1996.96-79,2,22185,edward_j_deano_jr,,2184.979,2185.537,No--
1996.96-79,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2185.537,2186.448,That doesn't seem to make any sense.
1996.96-79,2,22185,edward_j_deano_jr,,2186.448,2187.58,--No.
1996.96-79,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2206.841,2211.546,"Is the $1,000 annuity that Justice Breyer was asking you about, is that at issue here?"
1996.96-79,2,22185,edward_j_deano_jr,,2212.976,2215.117,That is a part of the claim--
1996.96-79,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2215.117,2219.611,She's not claiming that she gets the later wife's--
1996.96-79,2,22185,edward_j_deano_jr,,2219.611,2222.413,--That has been set out as part of--
1996.96-79,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2222.413,2223.374,"--annuity, is she?"
1996.96-79,2,22185,edward_j_deano_jr,,2223.374,2225.785,"--That is set out, has been set out as part of the claim."
1996.96-79,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2225.785,2226.597,A piece of it.
1996.96-79,2,22185,edward_j_deano_jr,,2227.034,2227.365,"Oh, no--"
1996.96-79,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2227.365,2229.037,"Part of it, not all of it."
1996.96-79,2,22185,edward_j_deano_jr,,2229.037,2230.087,--It's an insignificant portion of the claim.
1996.96-79,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2230.087,2235.022,I had thought that the brief said that that was not the issue at all.
1996.96-79,2,22185,edward_j_deano_jr,,2235.022,2237.453,I'd also like to just note--
1996.96-79,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2237.453,2237.764,"Well, is it?"
1996.96-79,2,22185,edward_j_deano_jr,,2238.463,2239.264,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1996.96-79,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2239.264,2244.426,There is a claim for a portion of the annuity payments going to the second wife?
1996.96-79,2,22185,edward_j_deano_jr,,2244.426,2245.487,"That's correct, and before I--"
1996.96-79,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2245.487,2246.368,No longer a claim.
1996.96-79,2,22185,edward_j_deano_jr,,2249.7,2250.279,--Excuse me?
1996.96-79,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2250.279,2251.5,In the Fifth Circuit--
1996.96-79,2,22185,edward_j_deano_jr,,2251.5,2252.292,Yes.
1996.96-79,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2252.292,2262.588,"--didn't you succeed on the claim, and the claim included not only the lump sum amounts, a piece of those, but also a piece of the survivor's annuity?"
1996.96-79,2,22185,edward_j_deano_jr,,2262.588,2272.525,"Which... that's correct, and to maybe make that somewhat more understood, under Louisiana law what is actually the claim is accounting for a usufruct, meaning--"
1996.96-79,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2272.525,2274.306,"From the three sons, yes."
1996.96-79,2,22185,edward_j_deano_jr,,2274.306,2275.217,--accounting for the use of the property.
1996.96-79,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2284.753,2303.036,"Yes, but the result of it would be that the current wife, who's getting something like $1,800 a month, or something like that, that she would in fact have to pay over a piece of that, whatever is the... it could be reduced to a lump sum, but a piece of her monthly benefits."
1996.96-79,2,22185,edward_j_deano_jr,,2303.036,2304.245,"That's correct, and I think--"
1996.96-79,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2304.245,2306.657,What kind of a plan was this?
1996.96-79,2,22185,edward_j_deano_jr,,2322.438,2339.468,"--It's my understanding that the total pension benefits, meaning life insurance policies, meaning lump sums and this annuity, were provided over the life of the entire employment of Isaac and during that--"
1996.96-79,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2339.468,2344.423,"Not out of any specific fund that matched, dollar for dollar, what he put in?"
1996.96-79,2,22185,edward_j_deano_jr,,2344.423,2346.804,--I don't believe so.
1996.96-79,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2346.804,2355.97,What if Isaac had died before his retirement and without having remarried?
1996.96-79,2,22185,edward_j_deano_jr,,2359.494,2362.874,"If Isaac... under Louisiana law, if Isaac--"
1996.96-79,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2362.874,2363.604,He hadn't remarried.
1996.96-79,2,22185,edward_j_deano_jr,,2363.604,2364.636,--If he had not remarried--
1996.96-79,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2364.636,2370.119,"And he died before any survivor's annuity had been paid, what would happen?"
1996.96-79,2,22185,edward_j_deano_jr,,2370.119,2374.751,--The heirs of Dorothy would have--
1996.96-79,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2374.751,2375.672,His heirs.
1996.96-79,2,22185,edward_j_deano_jr,,2375.672,2376.293,--And his heirs.
1996.96-79,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2376.293,2377.224,Would his heirs get anything?
1996.96-79,2,22185,edward_j_deano_jr,,2377.224,2380.805,"His heirs would inherit his property, his part of the community property."
1996.96-79,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2384.328,2392.032,"Would they be entitled, if they were not dependent children, to any portion of the survivor's annuity in that circumstance?"
1996.96-79,2,22185,edward_j_deano_jr,,2392.032,2398.177,"If Isaac... oh, had Dorothy survived?"
1996.96-79,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2398.748,2399.288,No.
1996.96-79,2,22185,edward_j_deano_jr,,2407.094,2408.824,"--Well, I don't believe under the plan there would be any survivor's annuity."
1996.96-79,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2408.824,2410.844,"Of course not, and--"
1996.96-79,2,22185,edward_j_deano_jr,,2421.391,2422.884,Because that annuity--
1996.96-79,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2422.884,2425.664,"I mean, had he not remarried there would have been no annuity."
1996.96-79,2,22185,edward_j_deano_jr,,2441.546,2447.509,"--That right, that annuity was paid for first of all with community funds, and also--"
1996.96-79,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2447.509,2449.37,"--Well, but you just told me they weren't traceable."
1996.96-79,2,22185,edward_j_deano_jr,,2463.101,2464.881,--Perhaps I misunderstood your question with regard to a fund.
1996.96-79,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2464.881,2465.332,"Well, I--"
1996.96-79,2,22185,edward_j_deano_jr,,2468.023,2470.154,If the money was paid from community funds--
1996.96-79,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2470.154,2477.37,"--Why couldn't I think that what was bought with the community funds was, as I described it earlier, a lottery ticket?"
1996.96-79,2,22185,edward_j_deano_jr,,2486.634,2492.998,"--Because... and the answer to that question is because she has a certain claim, certainly on the benefits that her husband--"
1996.96-79,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2492.998,2495.5,That's the other part of the case.
1996.96-79,2,22185,edward_j_deano_jr,,2496.501,2496.792,--Okay.
1996.96-79,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2496.792,2498.201,"That's a different part, the husband's--"
1996.96-79,2,22185,edward_j_deano_jr,,2498.201,2518.456,"And those benefits were reduced due to this... due to this annuity, so that the community funds not only paid for the survivor's annuity, but the other funds that she would otherwise have a claim upon, which were the funds that were received by her husband, were reduced in order to purchase this annuity."
1996.96-79,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2518.456,2520.227,--So there's this right as a matter of State law--
1996.96-79,2,22185,edward_j_deano_jr,,2520.227,2521.448,That's correct.
1996.96-79,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2521.448,2546.774,"--That as a matter of State law, husband and wife 1 work together for 30 years, build up a million dollars in an IRA, or in some kind of a retirement account with a pension, and at the end, eventually wife 1 is long... is gone, but eventually that million is used to buy an annuity which says, $2,000 a month to husband, on husband's death, $1,000 a month to wife 2."
1996.96-79,2,22185,edward_j_deano_jr,,2562.716,2565.047,"And also, that's correct--"
1996.96-79,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2565.047,2574.132,"And that is the State law of Louisiana, and my question was, why, in fact, doesn't this particular provision that says half has to go to wife 2 trump that, and your answer was what it was."
1996.96-79,2,22185,edward_j_deano_jr,,2574.793,2575.893,--That's correct.
