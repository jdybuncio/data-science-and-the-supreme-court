2005.04-1324,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,5.856,"We'll hear argument next in 04-1324, Day versus McDonough."
2005.04-1324,0,29072,j_brett_busby,,7.121,9.668,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
2005.04-1324,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,59.408,60.672,It was a computation error.
2005.04-1324,0,29072,j_brett_busby,,71.172,84.826,"Well, there was a 1-day miscalculation, Justice Ginsburg, on the... on the 352 versus 353 days before the... Mr. Day filed his State postconviction petition."
2005.04-1324,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,92.257,97.502,But we're not... and we didn't take cert to decide if this claim was timely.
2005.04-1324,0,29072,j_brett_busby,,106.85,115.155,"--Well, our position is that by expressly conceding in their petition that it was timely, that that's an express waiver."
2005.04-1324,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,124.443,124.804,But the--
2005.04-1324,0,29072,j_brett_busby,,124.804,125.054,"--""# a known right""."
2005.04-1324,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,125.054,131.364,"--the whole basis was the number of days that they calculated, and the magistrate said,"
2005.04-1324,0,29072,j_brett_busby,,134.813,139.888,"The... yes, under Eleventh Circuit law, the magistrate said they should have counted that additional time at the end."
2005.04-1324,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,139.888,140.368,Yes.
2005.04-1324,0,29072,j_brett_busby,,140.368,147.673,"But this Court has said that the standard for... the standard for express waiver varies, depending on the right at stake."
2005.04-1324,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,164.502,164.892,Suppose--
2005.04-1324,0,29072,j_brett_busby,,164.892,165.163,--this Court--
2005.04-1324,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,165.163,167.62,"--Suppose the magistrate judge had said,"
2005.04-1324,0,29072,j_brett_busby,,193.508,196.97,"--Well, certainly, Your Honor, they could have moved to amend their answer."
2005.04-1324,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,227.169,227.44,I--
2005.04-1324,0,29072,j_brett_busby,,227.44,227.901,--analysis.
2005.04-1324,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,227.901,231.894,"--Did it say ""an obligation"", or that the court ""could""?"
2005.04-1324,0,29072,j_brett_busby,,235.023,252.686,"It did say, Your Honor, that there was an obligation for the court to impose it to further comity, finality, and federalism, and that can be found on page 5(a) of the appendix to the petition,"
2005.04-1324,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,286.376,291.733,Where is... I see... you're referring to page 4(a) and--
2005.04-1324,0,29072,j_brett_busby,,291.733,292.826,"--5(a), Your Honor."
2005.04-1324,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,292.826,294.27,--Yes.
2005.04-1324,0,29072,j_brett_busby,,296.425,303.456,"The obligation is seven lines from the bottom, and it's that last paragraph, where they're distinguishing Esslinger."
2005.04-1324,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,308.171,315.492,--I thought that that duty is in connection with Rule 4.
2005.04-1324,0,29072,j_brett_busby,,315.492,325.864,"Yes, Your Honor, and then they... they rely on that duty to say that there is an obligation, in the next paragraph, and to distinguishing Essingler and say,"
2005.04-1324,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,333.205,341.872,"So, the... it's right that there's an obligation if it notices it in the first instance on its first review."
2005.04-1324,0,29072,j_brett_busby,,341.872,348.423,"--Well, we don't necessarily agree, Your Honor, if... we don't necessarily agree that--"
2005.04-1324,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,348.423,355.503,"And suppose, under the review proceedings, that District Court is looking at it for the first time, without yet having required a response, and he sees a statute of limitation."
2005.04-1324,0,29072,j_brett_busby,,356.527,358.852,--Under Rule 4?
2005.04-1324,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,358.852,359.535,Sure.
2005.04-1324,0,29072,j_brett_busby,,359.535,362.233,"Well, Your Honor, if you'd look at what rule--"
2005.04-1324,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,362.233,367.67,"I mean, if... suppose it's an open and shut violation of the statute of limitations, or barred by the statute of limitations--"
2005.04-1324,0,29072,j_brett_busby,,367.67,368.292,--Uh huh.
2005.04-1324,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,368.292,371.991,--does District Court have discretion to refer to the State for a response?
2005.04-1324,0,29072,j_brett_busby,,371.991,373.729,"Yes, Your Honor, we would say that--"
2005.04-1324,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,373.729,374.089,Really?
2005.04-1324,0,29072,j_brett_busby,,374.089,381.743,"--that they must do that, because, as this Court recognized in Pliler versus Ford, it's almost never apparent on the face of the petition--"
2005.04-1324,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,381.743,382.404,"No, my--"
2005.04-1324,0,29072,j_brett_busby,,382.404,382.524,--that there's an--
2005.04-1324,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,382.524,382.764,"--No, my--"
2005.04-1324,0,29072,j_brett_busby,,382.764,383.095,--open and shut--
2005.04-1324,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,383.095,385.18,--my hypothetical is that it is.
2005.04-1324,0,29072,j_brett_busby,,385.18,385.813,--Okay.
2005.04-1324,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,426.958,431.32,Because the other... because the other side might make a mistake and not recognize it?
2005.04-1324,0,29072,j_brett_busby,,431.32,433.456,"--Or it might be tolled, Your Honor."
2005.04-1324,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,442.964,446.555,"Or the other side may say,"
2005.04-1324,0,29072,j_brett_busby,,466.616,467.84,"Absolutely, Your Honor."
2005.04-1324,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,483.355,490.348,"But you... it could be argued that the Federal Government wants to move them along speedily, whether or not the State government wants to."
2005.04-1324,0,29072,j_brett_busby,,490.348,490.909,Certainly.
2005.04-1324,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,491.439,499.554,"So, that would suggest that the State's voluntary waiver of a statute of limitations should not make any difference."
2005.04-1324,0,29072,j_brett_busby,,503.093,524.048,"--Well, they... there is an interest in judicial efficiency that's at issue here, too, but we submit that it's far more inefficient for the Court to put limitations under this first category of Rule 4 and say that the Court must, on its own, look at limitations every time, without assistance from the parties, than it is to make the State do its job."
2005.04-1324,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,525.692,525.892,"Well, we could--"
2005.04-1324,0,29072,j_brett_busby,,525.892,526.113,--Court recognized--
2005.04-1324,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,526.113,542.271,"--we could... we could agree with you that there is isn't an obligation on the Federal judge to raise it, but the question is, you know, the... it could be a ""must"", it can be ""may not"", or it could be ""may""."
2005.04-1324,0,29072,j_brett_busby,,542.271,542.982,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2005.04-1324,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,542.982,545.961,"And why shouldn't we treat this as a ""may""?"
2005.04-1324,0,29072,j_brett_busby,,553.955,560.265,"Well, the proper procedure under Rule 4 is not to call it to the party's attention in that way; it's--"
2005.04-1324,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,560.265,563.022,"We're past Rule 4, because an answer has been ordered."
2005.04-1324,0,29072,j_brett_busby,,563.022,563.365,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2005.04-1324,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,563.365,568.809,So... and it's only when the answer comes in that this issue is spotted.
2005.04-1324,0,29072,j_brett_busby,,568.809,569.452,Yes.
2005.04-1324,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,586.314,587.698,There are very what standards?
2005.04-1324,0,29072,j_brett_busby,,587.698,589.633,"--There are very clear standards, Your Honor--"
2005.04-1324,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,589.633,591.638,"Yes, ""leave shall be freely given""."
2005.04-1324,0,29072,j_brett_busby,,591.638,599.804,"--Yes, but there are also... it's a... again, it's a discretionary determination, and there are prejudice issues that should be considered as the--"
2005.04-1324,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,599.804,606.462,"Well, what would be the prejudice that could be claimed by the habeas petitioner?"
2005.04-1324,0,29072,j_brett_busby,,606.462,625.742,"--Well, the prejudice in this case is that the standards of Rule 15 were not considered; but, in addition, there are... there are well recognized decisions, both from this Court and from the Courts of Appeals, that went... that says a judge may deny leave to amend when the... at the time the concession is made."
2005.04-1324,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,649.091,651.74,Are you--
2005.04-1324,0,29072,j_brett_busby,,651.74,652.0,"Now, also--"
2005.04-1324,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,652.0,655.732,--Are you saying that the error is simply that it wasn't done via Rule 15?
2005.04-1324,0,29072,j_brett_busby,,665.502,688.611,"--Well, that would be... that's the Respondent's position, and I think, in addition to those considerations, if you disagree that this is a forfeiture, that... and you disagree that this is an express waiver, and you get to their position that, you know, this is a discretionary test and you should just apply the same Rule 15 factors, I think you need to also apply a presumption against sua sponte consideration."
2005.04-1324,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,697.749,706.405,"But you couldn't do this under Rule 4, because, as you, I think, recognized, that, just from the petition, from the habeas petition, you couldn't tell."
2005.04-1324,0,29072,j_brett_busby,,706.405,707.196,"--I'm sorry, Justice--"
2005.04-1324,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,707.196,707.476,There wasn't--
2005.04-1324,0,29072,j_brett_busby,,707.476,708.39,"--Ginsburg, I misspoke."
2005.04-1324,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,736.195,744.809,"Well, if you think it's... if it's done under Rule 15, would the considerations necessarily be exactly the same in a habeas case as in an ordinary civil case?"
2005.04-1324,0,29072,j_brett_busby,,744.809,746.343,Not necessarily.
2005.04-1324,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,783.075,785.933,"--Yes, but the civil rules allow for amendment."
2005.04-1324,0,29072,j_brett_busby,,785.933,787.687,"Yes, Your Honor."
2005.04-1324,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,787.687,790.608,"There's 8(c), and there's 12(b), but there's also 15."
2005.04-1324,0,29072,j_brett_busby,,790.608,791.14,"Yes, I agree."
2005.04-1324,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,796.674,801.842,"It seems the height of technicality to say that the judge could suggest,"
2005.04-1324,0,29072,j_brett_busby,,821.08,828.721,"Well, I don't agree, Your Honor, because there's a specific analysis that goes along with Rule 15 that wasn't applied here."
2005.04-1324,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,883.215,887.238,"Why does... proceeding under 15 does not do that; whereas, proceeding this way does?"
2005.04-1324,0,29072,j_brett_busby,,887.238,892.063,"--Well, proceeding under 15, I... proceeding under 15, you would say to the State,"
2005.04-1324,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,894.078,895.101,"Wink, wink?"
2005.04-1324,0,29072,j_brett_busby,,895.101,896.716,Well... but--
2005.04-1324,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,921.58,925.139,"Isn't that concern present in Granberry, as well?"
2005.04-1324,0,29072,j_brett_busby,,928.24,934.106,"I don't think so, Your Honor, because in Granberry the State raised the issue for the first time on appeal, the court did not."
2005.04-1324,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,987.067,991.44,"One that requires the court to raise it sua sponte, even if it's not raised by the State."
2005.04-1324,0,29072,j_brett_busby,,991.44,992.521,--I beg your pardon?
2005.04-1324,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,992.521,997.787,"One that requires the court to raise it sua sponte, even if not raised by the State, correct?"
2005.04-1324,0,29072,j_brett_busby,,997.787,1000.497,"Potentially, yes, if you codify it as a substantive limit on relief."
2005.04-1324,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1020.275,1023.497,"Your position is, it should be like any other civil case."
2005.04-1324,0,29072,j_brett_busby,,1023.497,1024.298,"Yes, Your Honor."
2005.04-1324,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1024.529,1028.81,"You can raise it sua sponte, we've said, in exceptional circumstances."
2005.04-1324,0,29072,j_brett_busby,,1028.81,1029.123,--Yes.
2005.04-1324,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1029.123,1029.814,I don't know what they are.
2005.04-1324,0,29072,j_brett_busby,,1029.814,1030.655,"Well, I--"
2005.04-1324,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1030.655,1030.828,And if--
2005.04-1324,0,29072,j_brett_busby,,1030.828,1031.127,--I'm not--
2005.04-1324,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1031.127,1031.489,--they're not there--
2005.04-1324,0,29072,j_brett_busby,,1031.489,1032.422,--One--
2005.04-1324,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1032.422,1034.196,"--then the judge could say,"
2005.04-1324,0,29072,j_brett_busby,,1037.969,1038.519,--Uh huh.
2005.04-1324,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1038.519,1040.546,"And then the lawyer for the State says,"
2005.04-1324,0,29072,j_brett_busby,,1043.492,1044.025,Certainly.
2005.04-1324,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1044.025,1044.575,And we don't--
2005.04-1324,0,29072,j_brett_busby,,1044.575,1044.816,And there could be--
2005.04-1324,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1044.816,1045.439,--have to decide--
2005.04-1324,0,29072,j_brett_busby,,1045.439,1046.8,--good reasons to amend.
2005.04-1324,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1060.414,1064.044,"Must there be good reasons for the judge to say, quote,"
2005.04-1324,0,29072,j_brett_busby,,1067.175,1068.929,"Well, I--"
2005.04-1324,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1068.929,1069.881,Must there be good reason for that?
2005.04-1324,0,29072,j_brett_busby,,1072.789,1074.043,--I don't think so.
2005.04-1324,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1074.043,1075.397,Why don't you do it the easier way and--
2005.04-1324,0,29072,j_brett_busby,,1075.397,1077.624,"I don't think so, Your Honor."
2005.04-1324,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1087.043,1092.509,"--Well, what's your answer as to whether there is any limitation on the judge just suggesting,"
2005.04-1324,0,29072,j_brett_busby,,1098.646,1106.14,"Well, I would think that, you know, it would be evaluated under an abuse of discretion standard, and I haven't... I haven't given much--"
2005.04-1324,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1106.14,1107.683,And what... when would it be an abuse of discretion?
2005.04-1324,0,29072,j_brett_busby,,1107.683,1109.048,--For a judge to--
2005.04-1324,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1109.048,1109.991,Yes.
2005.04-1324,0,29072,j_brett_busby,,1109.991,1110.923,--invite the State to amend?

2005.04-1324,0,29072,j_brett_busby,,1111.134,1121.657,"I would say if... it would be, in this case, perhaps, because of the State's express concession to the contrary, and... so that that might be one circumstance."
2005.04-1324,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1123.522,1123.812,"Well, it wouldn't--"

2005.04-1324,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1124.293,1124.766,--be an abuse of--
2005.04-1324,0,29072,j_brett_busby,,1124.766,1125.066,--circumscribe--
2005.04-1324,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1125.066,1131.396,--It wouldn't be an abuse of discretion for him to suggest an amendment if he's got the opportunity to rule on the amendment later on.
2005.04-1324,0,29072,j_brett_busby,,1134.795,1136.449,"--That's a good point, Your Honor."
2005.04-1324,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1147.331,1155.667,"I suppose it might be an abuse of discretion if you'd already had a hearing and took... and decided that there was merit to the plaintiff's claim, and then decided,"
2005.04-1324,0,29072,j_brett_busby,,1159.155,1160.78,"I would agree with that, yes, Your Honor."
2005.04-1324,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1160.78,1165.455,"Well, then why doesn't that same standard apply to the decision of the Court to raise it sua sponte?"
2005.04-1324,0,29072,j_brett_busby,,1165.455,1172.145,"Well, because in this case you have an express concession."
2005.04-1324,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1187.01,1187.301,Were those--
2005.04-1324,0,29072,j_brett_busby,,1187.301,1187.531,--don't want to strip--
2005.04-1324,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1187.531,1191.313,--cases... were those cases of a miscalculation on the part of the State?
2005.04-1324,0,29072,j_brett_busby,,1203.419,1211.283,"--Well, Your Honor, most of those cases involved other issues, like exhaustion and procedural default, where the State later came back and said,"
2005.04-1324,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1226.337,1232.937,"So, you'd say it would be okay if the State didn't expressly concede the statute of limitations point."
2005.04-1324,0,29072,j_brett_busby,,1232.937,1233.939,Possibly.
2005.04-1324,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1247.512,1248.123,That's--

2005.04-1324,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1250.81,1251.05,Okay.
2005.04-1324,0,29072,j_brett_busby,,1251.301,1251.983,--circumstances.
2005.04-1324,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1251.983,1252.424,--a fallback position.
2005.04-1324,0,29072,j_brett_busby,,1252.424,1252.834,Yes.
2005.04-1324,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1272.485,1289.937,"--Why, just out of curiosity... I'm not familiar with the actual practice of a lot of civil cases, but when somebody... let's say the defendant in an ordinary tort case forgets to put in the statute of limitations, and the case is all tried and finished."

2005.04-1324,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1300.46,1300.67,Because it's--

2005.04-1324,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1309.555,1309.815,--happened.
2005.04-1324,0,29072,j_brett_busby,,1311.693,1311.853,Well--
2005.04-1324,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1311.853,1316.396,"--The answer was put in, and then there were no further proceedings."
2005.04-1324,0,29072,j_brett_busby,,1318.22,1318.863,--Well--
2005.04-1324,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1318.863,1325.112,"It's quite different... I don't know any judge that would allow a defendant, after the trial is over, to raise the statute of limitations."
2005.04-1324,0,29072,j_brett_busby,,1329.416,1331.984,"--Well, we disagree that this was up front, Your Honor."
2005.04-1324,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1524.041,1524.952,"Thank you, Counsel."
2005.04-1324,1,19379,christopher_m_kise,,1527.431,1531.221,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
2005.04-1324,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1602.175,1602.946,"You think the court ""must""."
2005.04-1324,1,19379,christopher_m_kise,,1602.946,1603.81,"--No, Your Honor."
2005.04-1324,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1603.81,1606.367,"Well, don't you think that's what this court thought?"
2005.04-1324,1,19379,christopher_m_kise,,1613.438,1617.67,"Your Honor, respectfully, I don't think that that's what the Eleventh Circuit thought."
2005.04-1324,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1661.964,1671.663,"Yes, but, Mr. Kise, the... Mr. Busby told us that the reference was in the following paragraph, and it is the sentence,"
2005.04-1324,1,19379,christopher_m_kise,,1694.421,1702.175,"Your Honor... and I was referring to that sentence, and perhaps I wasn't clear, but I would... I would say that they are still talking about Rule 4."
2005.04-1324,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1730.67,1731.374,What--
2005.04-1324,1,19379,christopher_m_kise,,1731.374,1731.564,--District Court--
2005.04-1324,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1731.564,1738.101,"--What would you say... assuming that we're beyond Rule 4, what would you say simply to a rule that said,"
2005.04-1324,1,19379,christopher_m_kise,,1785.143,1794.443,"--I would say, respectfully, Your Honor, that that is somewhat inconsistent, if not entirely inconsistent, with what this Court said in Granberry and Caspari, dealing with the same sort of raising of affirmative defenses."
2005.04-1324,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1819.368,1819.749,What--
2005.04-1324,1,19379,christopher_m_kise,,1819.749,1819.929,--because the Court--
2005.04-1324,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1819.929,1826.236,"--What, then, would be the significance here of the fact that the State conceded that there was no limitations problem?"
2005.04-1324,1,19379,christopher_m_kise,,1833.309,1840.14,"--Well, Your Honor, I think that the State's concession, as Justice Scalia pointed out, is not the beginning and end of it, in the first instance."
2005.04-1324,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1840.923,1844.453,"No, but it bears on the exercise of discretion."
2005.04-1324,1,19379,christopher_m_kise,,1844.453,1845.916,"--Yes, Your Honor, it does."
2005.04-1324,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1877.984,1878.746,That would be an abuse.
2005.04-1324,1,19379,christopher_m_kise,,1878.746,1880.02,"Yes, Your Honor."
2005.04-1324,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1881.585,1884.233,District judges can't comment on the cases?
2005.04-1324,1,19379,christopher_m_kise,,1890.823,1891.884,"Well, Justice--"
2005.04-1324,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1891.884,1899.677,"That's a violation of... I mean, what I'm driving at is, I don't really understand Rule 15 thoroughly, because I'm not a trial lawyer."
2005.04-1324,1,19379,christopher_m_kise,,1916.79,1920.882,--I think leaving it to Rule 15 is one way to do it.
2005.04-1324,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1926.859,1929.879,"Yes, but the other way means we're now going to have a new area of law."
2005.04-1324,1,19379,christopher_m_kise,,1951.265,1955.616,"--Respectfully, Your Honor, I believe this Court's already done that, though, in Granberry and Caspari."
2005.04-1324,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1984.906,1985.838,Would you say it's--
2005.04-1324,1,19379,christopher_m_kise,,1985.838,1986.078,--the ordinary rule--
2005.04-1324,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1986.078,1988.636,"--means it's ""hardly ever""?"
2005.04-1324,1,19379,christopher_m_kise,,2016.97,2020.231,"--Yes, Your Honor, I would say that it is ""hardly ever"", and that's what we're dealing with here."
2005.04-1324,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2069.629,2075.808,What if Congress wanted to leave it to the State to waive the statute of limitations provision?
2005.04-1324,1,19379,christopher_m_kise,,2112.037,2118.805,"And I think that's why it is set up the way it is, Your Honor, but it's just that the waiver is not the beginning and end of it."
2005.04-1324,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2142.938,2143.991,"Well, it's always a technicality."
2005.04-1324,1,19379,christopher_m_kise,,2156.65,2159.298,"And, Your Honor, our test allows for that, as well."
2005.04-1324,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2168.225,2173.611,Would it... would it always be an abuse of discretion for the District Court to do this if the State wanted to reach the merits?
2005.04-1324,1,19379,christopher_m_kise,,2173.611,2177.102,"--I don't think so, Your Honor, because it would depend on why the State wanted to reach the merits."
2005.04-1324,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2207.852,2215.626,"There's no question of... put aside a sandbagging case, there's no question of sandbagging, and that the... the State just wants to litigate on the merits rather than on the statute of limitations."
2005.04-1324,1,19379,christopher_m_kise,,2215.626,2218.535,It would not always be an abuse of discretion.
2005.04-1324,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2218.756,2223.641,"In other words, can they have it... would it be an abuse of discretion in an express waiver case as opposed to a forfeiture case?"
2005.04-1324,1,19379,christopher_m_kise,,2223.641,2228.596,"--I don't think that you could say, in all circumstances... no, Your Honor, it would not be an abuse of discretion in all circumstances."
2005.04-1324,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2282.839,2292.036,"I thought in Granberry the Court gave the Court of Appeals that discretion, since it hadn't... the point had been missed in the District Court, been missed by everybody, until the Court of Appeals."
2005.04-1324,1,19379,christopher_m_kise,,2292.036,2302.588,"--Well, Your Honor, in fact, this Court did give the Court of Appeals that discretion, but even more so than we would give the District Court that discretion, because, Why should we wait for the process to get all the way to the Court of Appeals?"
2005.04-1324,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2318.074,2321.576,"You acknowledge at least this much, or am I incorrect?"
2005.04-1324,1,19379,christopher_m_kise,,2342.137,2345.035,"No, Your Honor, I would not, and I'll tell you why I would not."
2005.04-1324,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2345.035,2345.185,All right.
2005.04-1324,1,19379,christopher_m_kise,,2345.185,2349.307,"It's because, just as in Gonzalez, the Court is not reviewing the opinion."
2005.04-1324,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2351.743,2351.963,But why would--
2005.04-1324,1,19379,christopher_m_kise,,2351.963,2352.654,--judgment is correct.
2005.04-1324,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2352.654,2357.741,"--why would you deal with that hypothetical when the Eleventh Circuit, in all fairness, said,"
2005.04-1324,1,19379,christopher_m_kise,,2376.127,2387.259,"I would agree that the court thought it was deciding discretion, but I was responding, I... to what I thought was Justice Scalia's question about, What if this Court does not agree with that?"
2005.04-1324,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2462.948,2473.288,Why doesn't your position on the underlying merits of the timeliness question create an incentive for every habeas petitioner to file a cert petition?
2005.04-1324,1,19379,christopher_m_kise,,2473.288,2476.479,I'm not sure I follow your--
2005.04-1324,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2476.479,2476.82,"Well, you--"
2005.04-1324,1,19379,christopher_m_kise,,2476.82,2477.441,"--your question, Your Honor."
2005.04-1324,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2477.441,2487.361,"--you only get the extra 90 days if you actually file, under your explanation for why this cert petition is... why this habeas petition is untimely."
2005.04-1324,1,19379,christopher_m_kise,,2501.834,2507.29,"I understand our position to be that they do not get the 90 days, postconviction."
2005.04-1324,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2529.967,2530.772,Right.
2005.04-1324,1,19379,christopher_m_kise,,2530.772,2531.646,--that's when they terminate.
2005.04-1324,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2532.717,2534.342,Even if they file a cert petition.
2005.04-1324,1,19379,christopher_m_kise,,2534.342,2534.772,"Yes, Your Honor."
2005.04-1324,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2534.772,2542.285,"So, doesn't that put them in the position of sometimes having to file that... the habeas petition while the cert petition is still pending, if they file one?"
2005.04-1324,1,19379,christopher_m_kise,,2542.285,2543.006,"Yes, Your Honor, it might."
2005.04-1324,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2578.765,2581.122,Is there a conflict on the Circuits on that point?

2005.04-1324,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2589.687,2590.559,Yes.
2005.04-1324,1,19379,christopher_m_kise,,2590.559,2592.066,--moves in the other direction.
2005.04-1324,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2599.977,2600.841,"Thank you, Counsel."

2005.04-1324,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2703.54,2709.377,"Why, though, would we have a special rule in this respect for habeas cases?"
2005.04-1324,2,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,2713.349,2716.871,It's not really a special rule that we're advocating.
2005.04-1324,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2716.871,2719.73,"All right, if it's not a special rule, then the answer to this is, just say,"
2005.04-1324,2,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,2740.52,2759.487,"The relevant analogy in the civil context is not to what a court would do with a statute of limitations defense in the civil context, it is to what would the court do with respect to an affirmative defense that, like the habeas limitations, implicates broader social interests?"
2005.04-1324,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2759.487,2761.011,"Well, the same with strike suits."
2005.04-1324,2,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,2777.48,2788.454,"Well, the Court recognized... Arizona v. California is an example of the broader social interests that are implicated by the affirmative defense of res judicata."
2005.04-1324,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2799.506,2800.79,Not generally.
2005.04-1324,2,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,2827.811,2832.576,"Well, our point is that it is a matter for the court's discretion."
