2011.10-704,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,8.27,"We will hear argument next in Case 10-704, Messerschmidt v. Millender."
2011.10-704,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,9.022,11.891,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2011.10-704,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,92.776,104.417,"There -- I suppose one new feature of the case is the fact that these officers submitted the affidavit to their superiors, who were -- were attorneys."
2011.10-704,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,104.417,105.367,Correct.
2011.10-704,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,105.817,107.519,Have we addressed that in a prior case?
2011.10-704,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,107.519,115.291,--I don't know that the Court -- the Court has -- in I believe the exclusion context I think I have seen it.
2011.10-704,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,124.897,126.73,"But it isn't good faith here, that's the problem."
2011.10-704,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,147.476,150.012,"--Well, that -- that's the test that the Court has set out."
2011.10-704,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,162.603,175.496,"Counsel, I thought in the Leon case that in fact, just like the claim in this case, that the affidavit was submitted to supervisors and the Court created the Leon test in spite of that."
2011.10-704,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,188.887,189.154,No.
2011.10-704,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,189.47,195.474,"That -- that simply because supervisors decide that it's okay, that that--"
2011.10-704,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,195.474,196.024,--No.
2011.10-704,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,196.024,199.778,--exculpates someone from responsibility?
2011.10-704,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,199.778,200.712,Certainly not.
2011.10-704,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,210.919,211.302,All right.
2011.10-704,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,249.092,264.97,"The way that has generally come up has not been in the validity of the warrant for purposes of the Fourth Amendment, but in terms of qualified immunity for the officer or exclusion of the evidence under -- or not -- or nonsuppression, rather, under the good faith exception."
2011.10-704,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,281.849,286.467,"Tell me how, this case, the bare-bone affidavit was sufficient?"
2011.10-704,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,323.626,326.41,"Oh, I mean, this is not per se a gang crime."
2011.10-704,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,326.41,327.677,This is almost like--
2011.10-704,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,327.677,331.129,"Without a -- without a doubt, it's not a what we consider a gangland crime, of one gang member against the other."
2011.10-704,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,356.763,377.593,"So if you have a gang member and the crime has absolutely nothing to do with gang membership -- that I think is the case here; it's a domestic assault -- as long as you are a gang member, than every warrant can say ""search for all gang-related information""?"
2011.10-704,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,379.878,382.68,"No, it isn't, because it's always a fact-specific inquiry."
2011.10-704,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,387.599,390.234,But you -- you said this is domestic assault.
2011.10-704,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,394.738,399.507,"--Well, the gentleman is using a sawed-off shotgun, which is a weapon associated with -- with gangs."
2011.10-704,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,407.613,420.103,So anyone who has a weapon and is a member of a gang then can be -- there can be a search for any and all weapons and material related to weapons?
2011.10-704,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,420.103,423.222,"--Well, it depends on the circumstances of the crime that you are investigating."
2011.10-704,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,437.049,444.405,"I'm on to the part about all gang-related activities, when the crime has nothing to do with the -- with the gang."
2011.10-704,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,454.593,459.997,"--Correct, Your Honor."
2011.10-704,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,475.007,477.376,But they didn't need to tie him to the shotgun.
2011.10-704,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,479.911,483.446,"They have some evidence, but you don't have to stop just because you have some evidence."
2011.10-704,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,485.413,492.051,"What -- what do you need more than here he is, with his gun, the defendant himself and his gun?"
2011.10-704,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,493.601,501.324,"--Well, if you found the actual shotgun there wrapped in his -- in his gang -- gang colors with his gang moniker, I mean, it would make an even stronger case."
2011.10-704,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,507.578,510.113,"--What do we do with the officer's testimony when he said,"
2011.10-704,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,530.843,534.312,"--Because, again, the nature of gang membership is that gangs--"
2011.10-704,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,534.312,556.578,"So you are answering -- you are answering Justice Ginsburg by saying that any time a gang member commits any crime, the police are entitled to seek a warrant that permits the search for anything they have in their home that relates to their gang membership and to -- to guns?"
2011.10-704,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,556.578,558.211,"--No, because I think it depends."
2011.10-704,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,561.78,566.517,"That did not involve -- by the officer's admission and your own, that wasn't gang-related."
2011.10-704,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,566.517,568.067,"--The assault, correct."
2011.10-704,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,568.067,568.569,The assault--
2011.10-704,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,568.569,572.253,"But the manner in which he procures the weapon, might dispose of the weapon, the nature of the weapon itself."
2011.10-704,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,572.253,572.603,--But wait a minute.
2011.10-704,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,583.311,587.363,"Again, the nature of a sawed-off shotgun; it's an illegal weapon in and of itself."
2011.10-704,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,587.363,588.197,Counsel--
2011.10-704,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,588.197,589.882,Whose house -- whose house was this?
2011.10-704,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,589.882,592.584,"Augusta Millender's house, Ms. Millender's home."
2011.10-704,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,592.584,593.801,It was not the defendant's house?
2011.10-704,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,593.801,594.184,Correct.
2011.10-704,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,596.619,598.671,To what--
2011.10-704,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,598.671,599.938,What's the -- I'm sorry.
2011.10-704,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,599.938,606.559,--To what extent are we supposed to take things that aren't in the affidavit or the warrant itself as relevant?
2011.10-704,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,650.354,658.71,"Well, I mean, again, I think, as he sets forth his experience as a gang officer, and the manner in which gangs dispose of, procure weapons--"
2011.10-704,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,658.71,659.81,He didn't say much about the gang.
2011.10-704,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,659.81,660.177,--No.
2011.10-704,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,660.177,662.412,I'm asking you a specific question.
2011.10-704,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,683.809,685.611,Well--
2011.10-704,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,685.611,689.579,"Now that was the question, I think roughly, that you were being asked and I would like to hear the answer."
2011.10-704,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,693.8,696.033,"--Well, I mean, it's an -- it's an objective standard."
2011.10-704,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,699.121,699.687,Wait.
2011.10-704,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,701.287,701.737,Yes.
2011.10-704,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,701.737,717.165,"Or before the -- do I look at the affidavits and the warrant, or do I also look at things that are in neither of those documents, but were in the officer's head?"
2011.10-704,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,717.165,722.986,"For purposes of determining the Fourth Amendment validity of the warrant, the Court has said you -- you look at the warrant."
2011.10-704,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,738.079,769.531,"So if I look at whether he was in good faith, if he has any training at all, I would guess that if he thought that there is no -- I don't remember the exact words -- no reason, no reason to believe there would be any weapons in the house, no reason to believe there would be any handguns in the house, and then I say, I want a warrant to search for handguns in the house, it looks like you are asking for a warrant to search for that for which you have no reason to believe it's there."
2011.10-704,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,777.404,787.492,Because you -- you still have under 1524(a)(3) of the California Penal Code the -- the ability to search for items that might be used with the intent to commit another crime.
2011.10-704,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,788.761,794.248,Even though you can search a person's house -- why don't I search the person's house for an atomic bomb?
2011.10-704,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,803.104,809.925,"--Well, again I think -- going back here in terms of -- stepping back from good faith as opposed to probable cause, I don't think it's irrelevant that this guy is a gang member."
2011.10-704,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,815.329,815.812,Excuse me.
2011.10-704,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,817.364,817.964,--Well--
2011.10-704,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,817.964,819.948,--That's -- that is what I think is the problem with this case.
2011.10-704,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,834.707,835.442,--Yes.
2011.10-704,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,835.442,837.392,We don't have a good faith test for this purpose.
2011.10-704,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,837.392,837.861,Sure.
2011.10-704,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,853.037,853.287,Of course--
2011.10-704,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,853.287,854.304,So when -- I'm sorry.
2011.10-704,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,854.304,869.98,"--I was just going to say, of course you are making the case somewhat harder for yourself because the issue here is whether it was reasonable for him to say, let me check and see what my superiors say about this, and then after that review for him to say, let's see what the magistrate thinks about this, right?"
2011.10-704,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,869.98,870.563,Correct.
2011.10-704,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,876.8,883.204,What cause is there to think -- what cause is there to think that the gang guns will be used to commit a crime.
2011.10-704,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,883.204,887.256,--This is a gentleman who just perpetrated assault with a sawed off shotgun.
2011.10-704,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,899.916,908.521,"But the warrant didn't just authorize, you know, firearms wrapped in gang colors."
2011.10-704,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,913.057,913.54,--Correct.
2011.10-704,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,913.54,916.592,What possible purpose could that serve?
2011.10-704,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,916.592,925.215,"Again, because the evidence of gang -- indicia of gang membership could be used to tie him to things in the residence that you might find, absolutely."
2011.10-704,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,927.067,929.269,If they were wrapped in it yes.
2011.10-704,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,931.419,932.071,Sure.
2011.10-704,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,932.071,942.327,"So all that the finding of gang membership decals or whatever they wear, all that would show is indeed this guy was a gang member."
2011.10-704,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,942.327,944.51,"Well, excuse me, Your Honor."
2011.10-704,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,951.183,962.805,"But they knew he was in that premises, I mean that -- I really don't understand how you can possibly search for indicia of gang membership when you know the man's a gang member, so what?"
2011.10-704,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,962.805,965.073,"--Well, again, Your Honor, it ties him closer."
2011.10-704,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,966.673,967.823,--But tell me something.
2011.10-704,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,987.086,991.054,"Well, you could find again, gang member -- indicia gang membership as to him."
2011.10-704,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,991.054,993.323,"Well, he admitted to that."
2011.10-704,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,993.323,993.806,"Well, correct."
2011.10-704,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,998.794,1002.846,What does that have to do with anything other than a general search -- a general search.
2011.10-704,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,1002.846,1005.948,A general search is evidence that--
2011.10-704,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1005.948,1008.166,"Because again, in the hope of finding evidence of other crimes."
2011.10-704,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,1008.166,1008.616,--No.
2011.10-704,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1008.616,1009.685,That's what it sounds like.
2011.10-704,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,1009.685,1010.102,No.
2011.10-704,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1014.77,1019.641,--What about a provision for any photographs that depict evidence of criminal activity?
2011.10-704,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,1026.295,1029.413,--That actually is in the section that deals with indicia of gang membership.
2011.10-704,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1061.301,1062.051,"Thank you, Counsel."
2011.10-704,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1075.877,1078.496,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2011.10-704,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1092.006,1101.112,"Mr. Srinivasan, there are two categories of materials here, one is the search for other guns and the other is the search for anything relating to gang membership."
2011.10-704,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1119.489,1126.393,"Well, I think one of the questions that would arise is whether the one as to which you thought there was a problem would expand the scope in a meaningful way."
2011.10-704,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1154.496,1163.166,"What does that depend on, whether you would look for the indicia of gang memberships in places where you wouldn't look for guns, is that it?"
2011.10-704,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1163.166,1163.435,That's right.
2011.10-704,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1174.708,1181.146,"Well, if you are looking for photographs that show gang membership, I guess you could look through photograph albums, you wouldn't really look there for guns, would you?"
2011.10-704,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1181.146,1182.229,"--Well, but no."
2011.10-704,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1256.96,1261.062,There is something very strange about the rule we are applying here.
2011.10-704,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1265.833,1267.533,"Yes, I believe so."
2011.10-704,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1267.533,1282.376,"And -- and so that judge, who is a lawyer and was appointed as a judge and presumably has some familiarity with the Fourth Amendment, found that there was probable cause to search for all of these things."
2011.10-704,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1312.228,1332.023,"Well, I -- I think the court has attempted to do that in Malley and Leon itself, because it has made clear that in the main, in all but the most narrow circumstances where a magistrate does find the existence of probable cause, the court need not engage in any searching inquiry to determine the qualified immunity is appropriate."
2011.10-704,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1332.023,1338.379,But the most narrow circumstance is defined as a circumstance in which no reasonable police officer could have thought the warrant was correct.
2011.10-704,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1343.031,1347.651,"Well, I think in some sense, Justice Scalia, you have two, in response, two parts of your question."
2011.10-704,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1358.457,1358.791,--Policeman.
2011.10-704,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1359.793,1363.178,"--No, it was speaking of a magistrate actually, not the officers."
2011.10-704,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1421.366,1422.866,"Well, I don't like this mishmash."
2011.10-704,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1440.261,1468.347,"--Well that, I mean certainly I don't want to urge anything upon the Court that would tend to water down the standard in the suppression context, but the only point I would add to this, Justice Scalia, is that when you are looking at it from the perspective of a reasonable officer who is trying to assess whether he should go forward and ask for assessment of probably cause from the magistrate, one consideration that seems natural to take into account is what actions the officer has taken, not just the quantum of proof that the officer has put in the affidavit but what actions has he taken."
2011.10-704,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1469.23,1479.703,"That would be wonderful if the test was, was this -- did this officer know that this was a bad affidavit and was acting in bad faith in executing it?"
2011.10-704,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1486.976,1494.395,--The test as outlined by the Court in Malley is whether it's subjectively reasonable for the officer to rely on the magistrate's judgment of probable cause.
2011.10-704,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1494.395,1501.901,Was the test was so lacking in indicia of probable cause as to render official belief in its existence unreasonable?
2011.10-704,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1501.901,1508.155,"It's -- the Court did say that, Your Honor, and the Court put the formulation in a number of respects in Malley itself."
2011.10-704,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1546.447,1554.12,"I think the question, Mr. Srinivasan, is do you think that the current test, the test that's currently formulated, is sufficiently protective of police officers?"
2011.10-704,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1561.274,1565.492,"We think if the current test is applied properly, it's sufficiently protective."
2011.10-704,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1572.331,1574.431,"Of course, you could say that in any test, you know?"
2011.10-704,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1576.233,1576.933,You could--
2011.10-704,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1576.933,1579.318,"And if you don't apply it protectively, it won't protect."
2011.10-704,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1585.036,1587.905,Did you say apply protectively or correctly?
2011.10-704,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1587.905,1591.642,"--Applied -- Well, I meant to say applied correctly, if applied correctly."
2011.10-704,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1595.411,1601.664,In the background of this case is this question.
2011.10-704,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1617.943,1620.209,"--No -- not -- not necessarily the general rule, Justice Kennedy."
2011.10-704,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1640.457,1641.658,You keep adding facts that weren't in--
2011.10-704,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1641.658,1647.026,So the test is whether or not he is likely to commit another crime?
2011.10-704,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1647.026,1648.462,Well that's the test that--
2011.10-704,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1648.462,1656.318,"I mean, I thought the Petitioner said -- I didn't have the time to interrupt -- that under California law they can search for anything where he is likely to commit another crime."
2011.10-704,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1656.318,1658.434,"--Yes, this is a very important point, Justice Kennedy."
2011.10-704,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1679.784,1681.1,Finish your sentence.
2011.10-704,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1681.1,1683.885,--That provision is by no means an outlier.
2011.10-704,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1693.991,1694.543,"Thank you, counsel."
2011.10-704,2,38455,paul_rq_wolfson,,1703.465,1705.549,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2011.10-704,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1719.825,1729.247,Malley involved a search warrant based solely on a wiretap in which an unknown individual discussed drug use at a party.
2011.10-704,2,38455,paul_rq_wolfson,,1732.382,1741.238,"Well, Malley involved a mistake as to who the person under suspicion was who was mentioned in the -- in the wiretap."
2011.10-704,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1766.039,1777.097,"Here you had a police officer who assembled information he had, truthful information, in the affidavit, submitted it to his superiors, who were lawyers."
2011.10-704,2,38455,paul_rq_wolfson,,1810.568,1819.34,"Mr. Chief Justice, I don't think -- I don't think there is any question that in the great majority of cases officers who seek warrants from magistrates will be immune."
2011.10-704,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1855.947,1873.992,Is it the case here that a reasonably well trained officer would not -- would understand that this warrant was defective in authorizing a search for guns other than the shotgun in question when a provision of the California Penal Code says that a search warrant may be issued to seize items intended for use in committing a crime?
2011.10-704,2,38455,paul_rq_wolfson,,1873.992,1878.627,A reasonable -- that a reasonably well trained officer would not have sought the search warrant.
2011.10-704,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1895.855,1903.594,You have your client who has discharged a sawed-off shotgun at his former girlfriend in an attempt to kill her.
2011.10-704,2,38455,paul_rq_wolfson,,1921.39,1924.858,"--Well, Mr. Bowen is not our client, Justice Alito."
2011.10-704,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1926.342,1926.692,I'm sorry.
2011.10-704,2,38455,paul_rq_wolfson,,1927.626,1928.994,"--No, but this is an important point."
2011.10-704,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1931.595,1934.13,"--Well, that was just -- that a misstatement on my part."
2011.10-704,2,38455,paul_rq_wolfson,,1934.13,1934.397,"--No, I understand, but--"
2011.10-704,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1934.397,1936.899,He could not think that about Mr. Bowen?
2011.10-704,2,38455,paul_rq_wolfson,,1936.899,1949.723,"--But I want to make the point, not only do the police have to have probable cause to believe that there is such an item, they also have to have probable cause to believe that it will be found in the place that they propose to search."
2011.10-704,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1950.24,1951.075,All right.
2011.10-704,2,38455,paul_rq_wolfson,,1956.563,1957.713,"--Well, we are contesting that."
2011.10-704,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1958.663,1960.698,It's not an issue before us.
2011.10-704,2,38455,paul_rq_wolfson,,1960.698,1961.798,--It's not an issue here.
2011.10-704,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1968.87,1998.723,"Well, on the assumption that he was living in those premises, then what is wrong with a reasonable officer thinking: He's tried to kill her in the past using one gun; he's a member of a gang; he is very likely to have -- to possess or have access to other guns; those other guns may be found in the home where we believe he is living, and he is intending to use them to carry out the threat that he has promised, the threat that he has made?"
2011.10-704,2,38455,paul_rq_wolfson,,1998.723,2001.675,"--Well, there are several -- I think there are several problems with that."
2011.10-704,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2036.244,2039.096,"Well, just suppose they are searching the suspect's own house."
2011.10-704,2,38455,paul_rq_wolfson,,2039.096,2039.798,--Correct.
2011.10-704,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2039.798,2042.198,And there's -- he's used a specific gun.
2011.10-704,2,38455,paul_rq_wolfson,,2058.925,2062.811,"No, I would not -- I would not say that, Justice Kennedy because I think that--"
2011.10-704,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2062.811,2065.263,On what basis do you say they can take the second gun?
2011.10-704,2,38455,paul_rq_wolfson,,2065.263,2091.397,"--Because if the police are in a place where, lawfully in a place pursuant to a properly, narrowly drawn warrant, and they -- and they see something in plain view, under this Court's plain view doctrine as articulated in Horton v. California, and there is probable cause to see something there to associate with criminal activity, yes, the police can -- can seize that."
2011.10-704,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2100.102,2104.138,"Yes, but what's the difference between what you just said and the situation here?"
2011.10-704,2,38455,paul_rq_wolfson,,2116.798,2117.981,"--Yes, but--"
2011.10-704,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2117.981,2120.416,And -- so how did that change?
2011.10-704,2,38455,paul_rq_wolfson,,2130.039,2140.579,"--I think the assumption, as I understood, behind Justice Kennedy's question was, if the police see something -- happen to see something in the house that is probable cause of a crime--"
2011.10-704,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2140.579,2149.769,"But your argument is there was no probable cause for thinking that the guns in the house, if there were other guns, would be used for a crime."
2011.10-704,2,38455,paul_rq_wolfson,,2216.345,2216.762,--Well--
2011.10-704,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2216.762,2220.365,And you don't have to -- you have to show more than that there is no probable cause.
2011.10-704,2,38455,paul_rq_wolfson,,2225.667,2232.256,"--Because the police did not have probable cause to believe there was any other gun, and they certainly--"
2011.10-704,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2232.256,2238.927,"He is a member of a gang which often has guns, and this expert knows that members of gangs have guns."
2011.10-704,2,38455,paul_rq_wolfson,,2247.58,2248.513,--But it doesn't -- excuse me.
2011.10-704,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2255.75,2263.522,"And the warrant authorized the search for and seizure of all guns, not just the guns belonging to Bowen."
2011.10-704,2,38455,paul_rq_wolfson,,2264.805,2265.291,That's correct.
2011.10-704,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2265.291,2268.174,"--in fact, they seized some of the Millenders' guns, didn't they?"
2011.10-704,2,38455,paul_rq_wolfson,,2268.174,2269.176,That is correct.
2011.10-704,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2269.176,2280.217,"And why is that -- if there is probable cause to believe that he has other guns, is there also probable cause to believe that any gun found in the house will belong to them?"
2011.10-704,2,38455,paul_rq_wolfson,,2281.867,2283.467,"I would say not, Your Honor, but I--"
2011.10-704,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2283.467,2290.104,We have been talking -- we have been talking about this for some time as if we are reviewing the adequacy of the warrant.
2011.10-704,2,38455,paul_rq_wolfson,,2311.469,2314.152,"--I -- I think it can't be dispositive, Your Honor."
2011.10-704,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2314.152,2315.338,I didn't ask if it's dispositive.
2011.10-704,2,38455,paul_rq_wolfson,,2317.054,2323.008,"It could be -- it could be relevant, but I would say it -- it doesn't make the case in this case, for a few reasons."
2011.10-704,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2396.306,2403.896,"Do you want -- do you want to encourage officers, when they are applying for search warrants, to have them reviewed by the deputy district attorney or not?"
2011.10-704,2,38455,paul_rq_wolfson,,2403.896,2407.698,"--Certainly we want them to encourage that, Mr. Chief Justice."
2011.10-704,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2423.726,2430.046,"Ultimately, it's the officer who goes into the Millenders' house, seizes their arms, rifles through their drawers."
2011.10-704,2,38455,paul_rq_wolfson,,2432.415,2444.473,"Well, the officers who are the Petitioners in this case are the officers who actually applied for the search warrant and who actually drafted the search warrant for the magistrate to sign."
2011.10-704,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2447.675,2449.075,I didn't understand that.
2011.10-704,2,38455,paul_rq_wolfson,,2449.075,2449.425,--Yes.
2011.10-704,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2449.425,2451.293,They did not execute the warrant?
2011.10-704,2,38455,paul_rq_wolfson,,2451.293,2454.245,"They were -- they were -- they were part of the executing team, yes."
2011.10-704,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2455.245,2458.114,But did they enter the residence?
2011.10-704,2,38455,paul_rq_wolfson,,2458.114,2459.197,"--They entered the residence, yes."
2011.10-704,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2492.185,2502.809,"--If we are using a purely objective standard, another fact that I just want your reaction on is where he says:"
2011.10-704,2,38455,paul_rq_wolfson,,2541.351,2542.218,I don't really--
2011.10-704,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2542.218,2542.868,--Can we read it that way?
2011.10-704,2,38455,paul_rq_wolfson,,2545.553,2548.772,"--Well, the Petitioners have never suggested that reading before."
2011.10-704,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2596.119,2603.772,"Mr. Wolfson, suppose they had had a warrant to search just for the sawed-off shotgun."
2011.10-704,2,38455,paul_rq_wolfson,,2635.577,2637.394,"--Well, a couple of responses."
2011.10-704,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2667.631,2673.885,"You cite -- well, in Groh, the warrant did not identify the items to be seized at all."
2011.10-704,2,38455,paul_rq_wolfson,,2673.885,2674.969,That is correct.
2011.10-704,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2686.609,2688.044,"Your answer, and again--"
2011.10-704,2,38455,paul_rq_wolfson,,2688.044,2688.211,Right.
2011.10-704,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2688.211,2691.413,--it seems to me we keep separating these two inquiries.
2011.10-704,2,38455,paul_rq_wolfson,,2699.519,2700.086,I understand.
2011.10-704,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2700.086,2709.041,"And to cite Groh, a -- no reasonable officer could think that a warrant that doesn't say anything at all about what is to be seized complied with the Fourth Amendment."
2011.10-704,2,38455,paul_rq_wolfson,,2709.041,2719.247,"But the argument was made in Groh that essentially this was sort of no harm, no foul, because surely a reasonable police officer could have obtained a valid warrant."
2011.10-704,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2756.622,2757.438,So what happens--
2011.10-704,2,38455,paul_rq_wolfson,,2757.438,2758.088,--invalid warrant.
2011.10-704,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2758.088,2759.474,--below on that question?
2011.10-704,2,38455,paul_rq_wolfson,,2760.507,2760.84,Right.
2011.10-704,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2760.84,2775.334,"--the same question that Justice Kagan asked if your brethren, which is how about we find that it was reasonable to ask for the guns but not for the gang-related materials?"
2011.10-704,2,38455,paul_rq_wolfson,,2782.773,2783.256,Right.
2011.10-704,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2831.736,2833.569,What about the gang paraphernalia?
2011.10-704,2,38455,paul_rq_wolfson,,2853.233,2853.783,Right.
2011.10-704,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2887.073,2889.023,Then why couldn't a reasonable officer think that that would be the case here.
2011.10-704,2,38455,paul_rq_wolfson,,2889.023,2890.191,For -- for a few reasons.
2011.10-704,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2908.32,2914.14,"No, well, if they have probable cause to believe that the sawed-off shotgun is there; let's suppose they find the sawed-off shotgun."
2011.10-704,2,38455,paul_rq_wolfson,,2923.162,2938.256,"--But the gang-related indicia part of the warrant is -- first of all, much, much broader than that; and secondly the Petitioners have never argued until this Court that that was the purpose of the gang-related indicia part of the warrant."
2011.10-704,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2954.499,2960.685,"I thought this was a test of what they could -- what a reasonable officer could have believed, not what they in particular believed?"
2011.10-704,2,38455,paul_rq_wolfson,,2960.685,2974.429,"--Well, that's correct, but I think that does not mean that one can engage essentially in a completely post-hoc rationalization of what the objective search by the -- to be accomplished by the warrant is."
2011.10-704,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2983.051,3012.92,"Mr. Wolfson, it seems that many of the arguments on both sides are very fact-dependent in nature, that you are asking what inferences can be drawn reasonably from certain facts, from a particularly violent incident, from the use of a sawed-off shotgun, from the fact that this was not his home, from the fact that he was a gang member; and yet the cases that you cite to us as suggesting what a reasonable police officer should know, really are not cases that involve these facts at all."
2011.10-704,2,38455,paul_rq_wolfson,,3027.164,3033.801,"Well, of course this Court has never required that, for qualified immunity purposes, that the case -- there be another case exactly on point."
2011.10-704,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3033.801,3034.368,But -- no.
2011.10-704,2,38455,paul_rq_wolfson,,3040.906,3056.232,"Respectfully, Justice Kagan, I don't think I agree, and I think that it's -- it's useful to look at two related but somewhat different lines of cases, particularly in the Ninth Circuit, but actually, you know, all across the board in the courts of appeals."
2011.10-704,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3126.11,3128.445,"Well, to come back to a question that was asked before--"
2011.10-704,2,38455,paul_rq_wolfson,,3128.445,3128.862,--Yes.
2011.10-704,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3128.862,3134.349,--suppose they were issuing -- suppose the warrant just sought this -- the -- that particular weapon.
2011.10-704,2,38455,paul_rq_wolfson,,3159.983,3162.018,"Yes, I think there are many things the police can do."
2011.10-704,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3167.07,3167.437,All right.
2011.10-704,2,38455,paul_rq_wolfson,,3168.439,3168.855,--Right.
2011.10-704,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3169.372,3170.139,--that could be used.
2011.10-704,2,38455,paul_rq_wolfson,,3171.057,3176.326,"Well, the police -- if -- and so one question is do the police know that Mr. Bowen is a felon?"
2011.10-704,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3184.349,3184.982,Let's--
2011.10-704,2,38455,paul_rq_wolfson,,3184.982,3186.234,--So -- okay.
2011.10-704,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3186.234,3187.084,--I am hypothesizing--
2011.10-704,2,38455,paul_rq_wolfson,,3187.084,3187.417,Right.
2011.10-704,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3187.417,3189.003,--he has a license for all of these.
2011.10-704,2,38455,paul_rq_wolfson,,3189.353,3189.736,Right.
2011.10-704,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3199.191,3200.643,--The circumstances are exactly the circumstances here--
2011.10-704,2,38455,paul_rq_wolfson,,3200.643,3200.926,--That the--
2011.10-704,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3200.926,3202.176,--except for the two things that I changed.
2011.10-704,2,38455,paul_rq_wolfson,,3205.445,3226.592,"--The police may be able to secure all of those weapons, certainly so that they pose no danger to anybody else; and if Mr. Bowen is arrested and then, if -- if he is to be released on bail or on pretrial release, it's a very common condition that he not have access to any weapons."
2011.10-704,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3235.132,3235.983,What happens if they don't find him?
2011.10-704,2,38455,paul_rq_wolfson,,3239.101,3241.887,--I don't think they -- necessarily have to leave the weapons there.
2011.10-704,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3241.887,3242.203,--why?
2011.10-704,2,38455,paul_rq_wolfson,,3243.537,3253.611,"If there is no -- well, if he not, if he is not there, then it is not clear to me that he has a Fourth Amendment standing to challenge anything."

2011.10-704,2,38455,paul_rq_wolfson,,3254.061,3254.345,It's his room.
2011.10-704,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3267.519,3270.038,I am putting in my notes that you are not answering the hypothetical.
2011.10-704,2,38455,paul_rq_wolfson,,3270.038,3271.055,--Right.
2011.10-704,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3280.012,3287.082,They can't say we are going to take them under -- we're going to take them so that he can't use those to kill his girlfriend which is what he has threatened to do?
2011.10-704,2,38455,paul_rq_wolfson,,3288.099,3288.382,No--
2011.10-704,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3288.382,3293.32,"--and if he happens to come back and -- and get those weapons, and he kills her, well, that's just too bad?"

2011.10-704,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3311.965,3313.817,You really -- you really are not answering my question.
2011.10-704,2,38455,paul_rq_wolfson,,3313.817,3314.05,--Yes.
2011.10-704,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3314.417,3325.807,My question is: everything is exactly the same except that it's his room and he's not a felon and he possesses them legally and there they are and they see them.
2011.10-704,2,38455,paul_rq_wolfson,,3325.807,3326.307,--I think--
2011.10-704,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3326.307,3335.496,"And your answer is they can take them; in which case my question is, why wouldn't they have probable cause to search for those in the first place?"
2011.10-704,2,38455,paul_rq_wolfson,,3345.785,3355.641,--They could -- they may be able to take them but that does not mean that they knew that they existed in the first place or that they would be at the Millenders' house.

2011.10-704,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3413.063,3417.298,Counsel -- do you -- do you contend that anything in the affidavit was false?
2011.10-704,2,38455,paul_rq_wolfson,,3417.298,3418.317,--Yes.
2011.10-704,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3420.852,3421.669,What was that?
2011.10-704,2,38455,paul_rq_wolfson,,3421.669,3442.949,"I think the -- the -- the proposition that Bowen quote, unquote 120th Street address, and that that -- and that that conclusion was drawn from among other things, Detective Messerschmidt's search of government databases was material misleading, because he didn't reside there."
