2004.03-287,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,0.0,4.689,We'll now hear argument in Wilkinson against Dotson.
2004.03-287,0,20687,douglas_r_cole,,7.821,11.804,"Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court:"
2004.03-287,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,78.02,80.635,"Well, it isn't just duration of... of confinement."
2004.03-287,0,20687,douglas_r_cole,,123.758,129.892,"It's arguably different than the good-time credits at issue in Balisok, as... as Your Honor notes."
2004.03-287,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,143.686,144.149,"Right, but that had--"
2004.03-287,0,20687,douglas_r_cole,,144.149,144.382,--of the sentence.
2004.03-287,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,144.382,147.421,"--that had nothing to do with the rationale in Balisok, as I recall it."
2004.03-287,0,20687,douglas_r_cole,,148.852,152.433,"Your Honor, the... the Court... that's... that's correct, yes."
2004.03-287,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,171.255,171.909,No... no question.
2004.03-287,0,20687,douglas_r_cole,,204.324,207.029,"I'm not sure it is, Your Honor."
2004.03-287,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,210.587,211.259,No... no question about that.
2004.03-287,0,20687,douglas_r_cole,,217.294,223.433,"And, Your Honor, as far back as Preiser, this Court has noted that challenges to duration go to the very heart of habeas corpus."
2004.03-287,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,224.398,228.575,The duration of... of the sentence.
2004.03-287,0,20687,douglas_r_cole,,256.762,262.51,"--Well, a decision from a Federal court... and I guess... I think the answer to Your... Your Honor's question is yes, it does."
2004.03-287,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,296.936,300.27,It doesn't... it doesn't shorten the length that they're going to be incarcerated.
2004.03-287,0,20687,douglas_r_cole,,310.19,312.5,"--Absolutely no certainty of that, Your Honor."
2004.03-287,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,313.795,315.68,"And... and there was in the other cases, wasn't there?"
2004.03-287,0,20687,douglas_r_cole,,317.327,319.055,"--Well, Your Honor, I don't think so."
2004.03-287,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,328.985,329.375,"Well, but--"
2004.03-287,0,20687,douglas_r_cole,,329.375,330.862,--released prior to that time.
2004.03-287,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,330.862,335.516,"--Oh, indeed, but the... but... but getting the good-time credits entitled them to be... be released earlier."
2004.03-287,0,20687,douglas_r_cole,,343.23,344.514,"It was, Your Honor."
2004.03-287,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,344.514,348.224,And there is no entitlement to be released earlier as a consequence of this.
2004.03-287,0,20687,douglas_r_cole,,348.224,349.559,We--
2004.03-287,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,349.559,351.769,"You just get another hearing and maybe you will, maybe you won't."
2004.03-287,0,20687,douglas_r_cole,,351.769,353.377,--That's correct.
2004.03-287,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,360.832,361.151,"Well, that's true."
2004.03-287,0,20687,douglas_r_cole,,376.324,379.151,"Yes, Your Honor, it could have been brought as a habeas action."
2004.03-287,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,386.709,387.82,But they're just asking for a new hearing.
2004.03-287,0,20687,douglas_r_cole,,399.054,408.883,"I think probably the Garlotte case, Your Honor, in which the Court allowed a habeas challenge where the only result was going to be to advance the date of eligibility for release from prison incarceration."
2004.03-287,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,408.883,414.205,It... it doesn't advance the date of eligibility.
2004.03-287,0,20687,douglas_r_cole,,426.232,432.802,"That's true, Your Honor, but these... under that understanding of eligibility, where eligibility means the first possible release date."
2004.03-287,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,439.992,445.424,"But if they are subject to another look, they are not necessarily then eligible for release."
2004.03-287,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,454.151,455.171,Is this with an I or an E?
2004.03-287,0,20687,douglas_r_cole,,455.171,456.481,"I was hoping for an I, yes."
2004.03-287,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,456.481,456.942,With an I or an E?
2004.03-287,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,456.942,465.102,"--With an E. With an E. But if... if you take my questioning as a compliment with an I, that's perfectly okay too."
2004.03-287,0,20687,douglas_r_cole,,465.443,466.765,I'll... I'll wait and see what the question is--
2004.03-287,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,466.765,467.523,Let's see what it is.
2004.03-287,0,20687,douglas_r_cole,,497.416,508.709,"--The State concedes that if they had brought this case before a parole hearing at which the guidelines were applied, that it would be a different case, and that 1983 would be a remedy in that... in that situation."
2004.03-287,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,508.709,511.029,Here's... here's the difficulty that I... that I have.
2004.03-287,0,20687,douglas_r_cole,,636.161,639.822,"Well, Your Honor, there would be some real consequences that would follow from that."
2004.03-287,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,639.822,640.226,That's what I thought.
2004.03-287,0,20687,douglas_r_cole,,640.226,648.119,The reason that it's important that these cases go to habeas rather than 1983 is because of the State court exhaustion requirement that's attendant with habeas.
2004.03-287,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,663.296,670.959,Doesn't the Prison Litigation Reform Act require exhaustion even in a 1983 action?
2004.03-287,0,20687,douglas_r_cole,,670.959,682.417,"Yes, but as Your Honor is aware, that's an administrative exhaustion requirement which this Court referred to in Nelson, I believe, as a substantially lower gate than the exhaustion requirement imposed by habeas."
2004.03-287,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,684.392,686.843,Is... may... may I just follow up on that question?
2004.03-287,0,20687,douglas_r_cole,,706.841,720.109,"--They could, Your Honor, but I... I think the types of legal determinations with respect to legal entitlements and also the court... we would assume a State court would also consider Federal claims that might be made by the prisoners when they bring their State court claim."
2004.03-287,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,728.008,736.746,"Well, couldn't one say the same thing of prison conditions that you can bring in as a 1983 action?"
2004.03-287,0,20687,douglas_r_cole,,761.572,780.422,"--Well, but Congress, with respect to conditions claims... and if you look at the language of the administrative exhaustion requirement in the PLRA at 42 U.S.C. 1997(e)(a), it says no action shall be brought with respect to prison conditions under 1983 without administrative exhaustion."
2004.03-287,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,812.426,813.496,"Well, no, I've got that part."
2004.03-287,0,20687,douglas_r_cole,,868.549,871.269,"--I don't think you need to do either, Your Honor."
2004.03-287,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,880.483,881.865,"Oh, well."
2004.03-287,0,20687,douglas_r_cole,,881.865,886.84,"--respondents concede in their brief, the only question then is does a parole decision count as a, quote, criminal--"
2004.03-287,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,886.84,887.058,All right.
2004.03-287,0,20687,douglas_r_cole,,918.77,930.176,"--I don't think that's necessarily right, Your Honor, because the illegally seized evidence at the trial... I don't know that that would necessarily imply the invalidity of the conviction that resulted from that trial."
2004.03-287,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,930.176,932.008,Why is he bringing his damage action?
2004.03-287,0,20687,douglas_r_cole,,939.619,950.125,"Right, Your Honor, and that... that's absolutely correct, but I'm not arguing for, and I want to make it very clear that I'm not arguing for any rule that would turn on the subjective intent of the prisoner in bringing their claim."
2004.03-287,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,983.097,989.172,"Yes, but does that mean the... the judgment... the order denying release on parole is invalid?"
2004.03-287,0,20687,douglas_r_cole,,1006.666,1014.479,"--We... we concede that if there's an ex post facto violation here, these prisoners are entitled to a new parole hearing."
2004.03-287,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1015.52,1017.138,But they're not entitled to parole.
2004.03-287,0,20687,douglas_r_cole,,1017.138,1018.238,"--Absolutely, Your Honor."
2004.03-287,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1018.744,1022.913,So that it doesn't totally invalidate the order that is at issue.
2004.03-287,0,20687,douglas_r_cole,,1022.913,1031.943,"Well, the way that... that I've been thinking about it is if you put the State parole decision up on the wall and you put the Federal decision up on the wall, one of them has to come down."
2004.03-287,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1034.862,1036.121,"Well, it doesn't entirely come down."
2004.03-287,0,20687,douglas_r_cole,,1037.78,1038.771,--No.
2004.03-287,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1042.538,1043.188,But not for release.
2004.03-287,0,20687,douglas_r_cole,,1043.188,1046.704,"--if they're successful on their claims, they're entitled to more frequent release hearings in the future."
2004.03-287,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1048.019,1054.129,But... but isn't it true that one aspect of your order that's under attack is they had refused to grant them parole?
2004.03-287,0,20687,douglas_r_cole,,1054.129,1055.74,--Absolutely.
2004.03-287,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1055.74,1056.63,And that remains.
2004.03-287,0,20687,douglas_r_cole,,1056.63,1057.689,"It doesn't, Your Honor."
2004.03-287,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1072.994,1076.555,I thought the only relief they were seeking was a more prompt next hearing.
2004.03-287,0,20687,douglas_r_cole,,1076.555,1092.655,"No, they... Dotson's complaint, I believe at page 20 of the joint appendix... he wants to, quote, proceed toward a prompt and immediate parole hearing in accordance with the statutory laws and administrative rules in place when the plaintiff committed his crimes."
2004.03-287,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1093.431,1098.54,But aren't... aren't those claims moot or academic now?
2004.03-287,0,20687,douglas_r_cole,,1131.681,1140.72,"--Well, it isn't a clean question, Your Honor, because exactly the same error that he alleges infected his first hearing was present at his second hearing."
2004.03-287,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1188.008,1193.388,"Was there... maybe I'm wrong about this, but I thought there no challenge being made to the 2002 hearing."
2004.03-287,0,20687,douglas_r_cole,,1193.388,1197.488,But what Heck makes clear is it doesn't matter what you say you're challenging.
2004.03-287,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1217.591,1229.354,"Why can't it simply be that prospectively for this class of prisoner, the old guidelines will apply, prospectively without undoing anything that's happened in the past?"
2004.03-287,0,20687,douglas_r_cole,,1229.354,1246.993,"--I think for the same reason that in Balisok I don't think there could have been a prospective order that said... said something like the method you have for choosing decision-makers creates fraud, bias, and deceit, on a going-forward basis you must change that method for selecting decision-makers."
2004.03-287,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1255.728,1262.132,I think twice you started something and our questions impeded you.
2004.03-287,0,20687,douglas_r_cole,,1307.353,1324.713,"--Not exactly on the same plane, Your Honor, but recognizing that this Court in Balisok said that post-judgment administrative decisions regarding the duration of confinement also count as criminal judgments that are protected for purposes of... of the Heck doctrine."
2004.03-287,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1325.914,1337.898,"But... but the... the generality at which you keep referring to it, with respect to conditions of confinement, is a... is a higher level of generality than anything that Balisok decided."
2004.03-287,0,20687,douglas_r_cole,,1362.423,1372.223,"--Well, Your Honor, if this turns on whether or not it's an entitlement, I would agree with you that it seems good-time credits might be different from an entitlement sense than parole."
2004.03-287,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1384.888,1388.297,We... we don't know what consequence it will have for the duration of his confinement.
2004.03-287,0,20687,douglas_r_cole,,1401.298,1404.339,"That's correct, Your Honor, but they're... they're pressing ex post facto claims."
2004.03-287,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1430.205,1430.446,Okay.
2004.03-287,0,20687,douglas_r_cole,,1438.187,1439.171,"--Right, but that's the Heck--"
2004.03-287,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1439.171,1443.282,And... and whether they are or not has nothing to do with... with Balisok and Heck.
2004.03-287,0,20687,douglas_r_cole,,1443.282,1450.302,"--I... I disagree, Your Honor, because in Heck and Balisok, the Court said look to what happens if they're successful on their claims."
2004.03-287,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1466.011,1466.359,Sure.
2004.03-287,0,20687,douglas_r_cole,,1473.474,1482.107,"At... at some level, I think there's an... an inherent and fundamental tension in their position, and... and the coin could flipped and conversely there's that same tension in ours."
2004.03-287,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1482.107,1487.075,"Are... are you sure that that's what they have to prove, that... a durational impact?"
2004.03-287,0,20687,douglas_r_cole,,1504.185,1511.735,"But, Your Honor, I believe what makes out the ex post facto claim is an increase in the quantum of punishment after they've committed their crimes."
2004.03-287,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1517.572,1518.384,"Yes, you may do so."
2004.03-287,1,31599,john_q_lewis,,1523.199,1526.915,"Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court:"
2004.03-287,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1534.55,1539.592,Can you tell us why... why is it still live when they... when they already received a second hearing?
2004.03-287,1,31599,john_q_lewis,,1541.568,1548.291,"--Johnson still has remaining claims for prospective injunctive relief in this case and, as well, declaratory relief."
2004.03-287,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1557.796,1558.442,What... what is--
2004.03-287,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1558.442,1563.67,"Well, put in plain language what it is Johnson is claiming he's entitled to."
2004.03-287,1,31599,john_q_lewis,,1564.676,1567.002,"Well, he... really three different things."
2004.03-287,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1574.967,1576.767,--Which is a new... a new parole hearing.
2004.03-287,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1578.812,1579.532,How could that be fixed?
2004.03-287,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1579.532,1580.011,--Yes.
2004.03-287,1,31599,john_q_lewis,,1582.673,1583.923,"Well, he does have a class action."
2004.03-287,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1602.446,1602.832,Why isn't he?
2004.03-287,1,31599,john_q_lewis,,1609.847,1610.295,--Sure.
2004.03-287,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1615.0,1615.292,No.
2004.03-287,1,31599,john_q_lewis,,1620.42,1621.179,"--Well, we don't--"
2004.03-287,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1621.179,1623.116,His claims here... his claims here are correct.
2004.03-287,1,31599,john_q_lewis,,1623.116,1639.876,"--We don't know that for sure, but part of his claim as well is to say in future parole hearings that I'm going to be subjected to, even if you don't give me a new one, in future parole hearings that I'm going to be subjected to, I want these processes fixed to... to come into compliance with due process."
2004.03-287,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1640.88,1647.862,You... you say we don't know whether the... the new parole hearing he got was still invalid?
2004.03-287,1,31599,john_q_lewis,,1647.862,1650.828,--I don't think there's enough in the record to determine that.
2004.03-287,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1650.828,1652.567,"Oh, so we can assume that that was valid."
2004.03-287,1,31599,john_q_lewis,,1655.646,1656.667,I am not willing to assume that.
2004.03-287,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1658.544,1659.684,But you're not challenging it.
2004.03-287,1,31599,john_q_lewis,,1659.684,1661.589,We can't yet.
2004.03-287,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1661.589,1662.256,"Okay, fine."
2004.03-287,1,31599,john_q_lewis,,1662.256,1663.579,We may intend to.
2004.03-287,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1663.579,1664.543,Then we take it as valid.
2004.03-287,1,31599,john_q_lewis,,1670.455,1672.46,Actually 2005.
2004.03-287,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1672.46,1673.591,2005?
2004.03-287,1,31599,john_q_lewis,,1675.703,1676.272,Absolutely.
2004.03-287,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1676.272,1681.508,"And in the year 2005, I want not to have the... what are they called?"
2004.03-287,1,31599,john_q_lewis,,1693.551,1694.088,That's correct.
2004.03-287,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1694.088,1695.746,So you're saying he's going to have this.
2004.03-287,1,31599,john_q_lewis,,1698.989,1702.809,"That's right, and as well, he says I want to be heard at this next parole hearing."
2004.03-287,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1709.334,1716.376,"And he's saying it violates the Constitution in two respects: one, they won't listen to me; and two, they apply the 1998 guidelines."
2004.03-287,1,31599,john_q_lewis,,1716.376,1717.353,--That's essentially it.
2004.03-287,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1717.353,1717.775,That's it.
2004.03-287,1,31599,john_q_lewis,,1725.649,1726.689,That's... that's correct.
2004.03-287,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1726.689,1727.114,Okay.
2004.03-287,1,31599,john_q_lewis,,1727.114,1731.115,And... and it is section 1983 because it doesn't violate the Heck rule.
2004.03-287,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1731.847,1735.285,And what... what is your... what is Johnson's mootness argument?
2004.03-287,1,31599,john_q_lewis,,1735.285,1749.958,"--Well, to the extent in his complaint he was seeking a new parole hearing as a result of the challenge to the '99 decision, that's probably mooted because he has received this 2001 hearing and we just don't know enough about it to know whether he's going to challenge it or not."
2004.03-287,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1752.168,1761.139,Could... is it possible that both Dotson and Johnson could get new hearings by a filing habeas--
2004.03-287,1,31599,john_q_lewis,,1761.139,1762.835,I don't think so.
2004.03-287,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1762.835,1763.264,--petition?
2004.03-287,1,31599,john_q_lewis,,1763.264,1764.207,I don't think so.
2004.03-287,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1776.893,1783.503,What would you do if there was an allegation of a serious procedural flaw in a past hearing?
2004.03-287,1,31599,john_q_lewis,,1796.433,1798.999,"I think that's a closer call, but I think it--"
2004.03-287,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1798.999,1799.518,That's why asked you.
2004.03-287,1,31599,john_q_lewis,,1800.454,1801.501,--Right.
2004.03-287,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1819.695,1834.464,"Do we have any case in which what was being... what was sought to be challenged in a habeas action was not the duration of the sentence, but the procedure by which the duration of the sentence was determined?"
2004.03-287,1,31599,john_q_lewis,,1834.464,1836.931,I don't--
2004.03-287,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1836.931,1840.13,Is there any... why... why shouldn't that be a habeas action?
2004.03-287,1,31599,john_q_lewis,,1849.352,1861.867,"--Well, I think in the hypothetical that you've presented, Justice Scalia, if the prisoner wins the case in that particular case, then his sentence is invalidated, and I think that's the important critical factor here."
2004.03-287,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1861.867,1863.736,"No, no, no, not necessarily."
2004.03-287,1,31599,john_q_lewis,,1891.187,1895.088,Because it's not a challenge to the legality of the confinement.
2004.03-287,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1895.088,1898.197,My law clerk found two cases which we've just looked at briefly.
2004.03-287,1,31599,john_q_lewis,,1923.428,1938.298,"Well, and I... I think point with... with both of those decisions is that the Heck rule did not come into play because the prisoners must have gone through and exhausted their State court remedies, and so there wasn't an issue as to whether they must bring their claim in habeas."
2004.03-287,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1938.298,1938.535,No.
2004.03-287,1,31599,john_q_lewis,,1941.013,1941.494,Sure.
2004.03-287,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1943.238,1944.42,So habeas could be brought here?
2004.03-287,1,31599,john_q_lewis,,1944.42,1945.586,--I don't think so.
2004.03-287,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1945.586,1946.311,Why not?
2004.03-287,1,31599,john_q_lewis,,1946.311,1958.015,"I don't think there's a remedy in habeas for the respondent Johnson in this case because the first thing that's going to be asked when he goes to the Federal district court to seek habeas relief is, well, are you challenging the legality of your custody?"
2004.03-287,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1958.015,1959.52,"Yes, and they say sure... sure I am."
2004.03-287,1,31599,john_q_lewis,,1978.342,1978.751,Right.
2004.03-287,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1982.839,1988.345,"Well, but... but that's part of the conclusion that we're going to have to reach to... to resolve the case."
2004.03-287,1,31599,john_q_lewis,,2011.838,2019.591,"Because I think in... in the first hypothetical, Your Honor, that... that you gave, the challenge, if successful, would... would completely invalidate the sentence that he received."
2004.03-287,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2034.957,2036.821,"Well, it wouldn't completely invalidate the sentence."
2004.03-287,1,31599,john_q_lewis,,2043.142,2055.408,"But in the hypothetical you propose, Justice Kennedy, the... the prisoner was actually... would be actually challenging the sentence he received, and by winning the case, he's going to undo the State court sentence."
2004.03-287,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2055.408,2059.608,"Yes, well, those cases happen to involve... happen to involve sentences."
2004.03-287,1,31599,john_q_lewis,,2093.444,2096.293,"Well, I don't... I don't think it is properly a habeas action."
2004.03-287,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2109.934,2118.65,"Suppose we wrote an opinion that said, whatever the reasoning... I don't know what it would be right now... that said in the future your client should go ahead in 1983."
2004.03-287,1,31599,john_q_lewis,,2132.534,2134.888,I... I think there would be.
2004.03-287,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2134.888,2136.09,"Now, what would that harm be?"
2004.03-287,1,31599,john_q_lewis,,2136.09,2146.476,"I think that by... by having a rule of that sort, that it would be expanding the jurisdiction of habeas and it would start to swallow up otherwise cognizable section 1983 claims."
2004.03-287,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2146.476,2147.253,And why would that be bad?
2004.03-287,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2147.253,2148.115,And why--
2004.03-287,1,31599,john_q_lewis,,2148.115,2149.682,I'm sorry?
2004.03-287,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2149.682,2150.88,Why would that be bad?
2004.03-287,1,31599,john_q_lewis,,2150.88,2154.125,"Well, because the Congress has enacted a statute--"
2004.03-287,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2154.125,2154.305,"No, no."
2004.03-287,1,31599,john_q_lewis,,2158.586,2160.225,--Absolutely it would.
2004.03-287,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2160.225,2160.61,Because?
2004.03-287,1,31599,john_q_lewis,,2160.61,2163.025,Because there's a statute that allows--
2004.03-287,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2163.025,2165.596,"Well, I mean, leaving aside... Congress changed the statute."
2004.03-287,1,31599,john_q_lewis,,2169.82,2174.775,--It's going to give States a license to violate civil rights that will otherwise not be protected under the statute.
2004.03-287,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2174.775,2175.587,We'll catch them in habeas.
2004.03-287,1,31599,john_q_lewis,,2175.587,2179.245,"Yes, but the... the State exhaustion requirements in habeas are much tougher."
2004.03-287,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2182.075,2183.602,"Ah, so it comes down to that."
2004.03-287,1,31599,john_q_lewis,,2183.602,2184.59,That's really the critical--
2004.03-287,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2184.59,2190.019,"--You said... you said a moment ago that it would be expanding habeas, and I'd like you to expand on that."
2004.03-287,1,31599,john_q_lewis,,2211.342,2211.982,--That's correct.
2004.03-287,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2211.982,2212.387,Okay.
2004.03-287,1,31599,john_q_lewis,,2212.387,2218.973,You would basically end up going to a Federal district court seeking habeas relief asking for processes to be changed prospectively.
2004.03-287,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2218.973,2230.024,"And that's why they could not bring habeas in this case because if they won, they still would not have shown anything that entitled to them to get out now or get out now unless the State within 30 days does something."
2004.03-287,1,31599,john_q_lewis,,2231.194,2233.292,"That's... that's really it, Justice Souter."
2004.03-287,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2233.292,2234.422,"Well, I'm... I'm not sure."
2004.03-287,1,31599,john_q_lewis,,2245.748,2249.237,"Well, if that's the relief that the... the prisoner was seeking, I think that is clearly a habeas claim."
2004.03-287,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2260.594,2266.955,"Regardless of what he's asking for, if he got what he wanted, he still would not be entitled to any immediate release."
2004.03-287,1,31599,john_q_lewis,,2266.955,2267.803,That's absolutely correct.
2004.03-287,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2267.803,2275.82,"He would still have a sentence of X years, and the question is, how often are we going to look at him to decide when, within X years, we may let him out."
2004.03-287,1,31599,john_q_lewis,,2276.379,2277.882,That's... that's absolutely it.
2004.03-287,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2289.075,2289.918,"Well, he might--"
2004.03-287,1,31599,john_q_lewis,,2289.918,2290.566,--for Balisok in that case.
2004.03-287,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2290.566,2293.238,--he might shorten the term of his confinement.
2004.03-287,1,31599,john_q_lewis,,2293.238,2295.798,Might but not necessarily.
2004.03-287,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2299.182,2300.612,"Well, you could say the same thing when you're challenging the sentence."
2004.03-287,1,31599,john_q_lewis,,2303.854,2308.722,--I think a challenge to the sentence necessarily invalidates that sentence if you win.
2004.03-287,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2322.723,2324.613,--That's the nub of it I guess.
2004.03-287,1,31599,john_q_lewis,,2331.145,2332.01,That's absolutely right.
2004.03-287,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2332.01,2337.532,"In fact, it assumes the sentence is valid, but that he will probably stay clean if he gets out."
2004.03-287,1,31599,john_q_lewis,,2339.28,2340.05,That's really all it means.
2004.03-287,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2420.276,2420.729,"Thank you, Mr. Lewis."
2004.03-287,1,31599,john_q_lewis,,2420.729,2421.423,Thank you.
2004.03-287,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2421.423,2431.425,"Mr. Untereiner, is it?"
2004.03-287,2,17150,alan_edward_untereiner,,2431.425,2433.105,"Yes, Justice Stevens."
2004.03-287,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2602.57,2611.726,"You want a 1983 hearing in which a United States district judge tells the parole commission, now, here are your marching orders for future cases."
2004.03-287,2,17150,alan_edward_untereiner,,2641.667,2661.837,"--I think there... there are a fair number of cases in the lower court where... lower courts where these types of claims for injunctive relief have been brought and the Federal courts have ordered, on a prospective basis, that the States conform to all kinds of... I mean, Wolff is a case like that I think where the... the State was required to do certain things in the future."
2004.03-287,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2665.916,2671.466,Is there any significant difference between this case and Wolff?
2004.03-287,2,17150,alan_edward_untereiner,,2686.236,2687.176,Yes.
2004.03-287,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2687.176,2692.395,--So it seems to me it's very... very close to your situation.
2004.03-287,2,17150,alan_edward_untereiner,,2692.395,2694.387,"It is very close, Justice Ginsburg."
2004.03-287,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2868.462,2870.242,"Thank you, counsel."
2004.03-287,3,20687,douglas_r_cole,,2875.884,2876.697,"Thank you, Your Honor."
2004.03-287,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2929.804,2931.792,"Well, what's your position as to whether or not it's moot?"
2004.03-287,3,20687,douglas_r_cole,,2931.792,2935.904,"--Your Honor, we don't believe it's moot either, and in... in fact, for two reasons."
2004.03-287,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2973.286,2978.32,But... but you raise deprivation of the benefit they would get from the Ohio courts.
2004.03-287,3,20687,douglas_r_cole,,2991.151,2992.297,"--That's true, Your Honor."
2004.03-287,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3049.919,3052.833,I think sentence means custody.
2004.03-287,3,20687,douglas_r_cole,,3054.489,3056.259,"Well, but to the extent we're talking--"
2004.03-287,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3056.259,3057.795,The custody you've been sentenced to?
2004.03-287,3,20687,douglas_r_cole,,3057.795,3071.572,"--But to the extent we're talking about duration of custody or duration of confinement, again, the claims here do have a... success on the claims here would have a meaningful impact on the duration of confinement."
2004.03-287,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3112.595,3113.716,I had one further question.
2004.03-287,3,20687,douglas_r_cole,,3119.125,3122.484,I think we can follow that case as it's been reinterpreted in Heck.
2004.03-287,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3155.125,3156.204,"Thank you, Mr. Cole."
