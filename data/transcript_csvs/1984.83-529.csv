1984.83-529,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,7.42,We will hear arguments first this morning in United States against Sharpe.
1984.83-529,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,10.763,36.877,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this case is here on the government's petition for writ of certiorari to review a judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit suppressing a truckload of marijuana seized from the respondents on the ground that the discovery of the marijuana was the fruit of an unduly prolonged detention."
1984.83-529,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,36.877,39.502,Was it really a whole truckload?
1984.83-529,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,39.502,42.704,"Well, it was a... this was a pickup truck with a camper shell."
1984.83-529,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,49.169,52.355,"That is quite a bit, yes."
1984.83-529,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,52.355,70.958,"The case began when there was an operation to investigate suspected smuggling, marijuana smuggling in the... it was believed to be occurring either in the northernmost coastal county of South Carolina or the southernmost coastal county of North Carolina."
1984.83-529,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,270.204,272.626,"Mr. Frey, did he ask if he could leave?"
1984.83-529,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,272.626,273.406,He did ask if he could leave.
1984.83-529,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,274.468,276.796,Why wasn't he allowed to?
1984.83-529,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,276.796,284.434,--He wasn't allowed to leave because there was a reasonable suspicion that the truck contained marijuana.
1984.83-529,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,284.434,286.073,At that time?
1984.83-529,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,286.073,286.995,At that time.
1984.83-529,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,296.726,298.568,"Tell me again, why wasn't he allowed to leave?"
1984.83-529,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,298.568,309.923,--He was not allowed to leave because Agent Thrasher had determined to hold him until Cooke arrived on the scene to conduct a--
1984.83-529,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,309.923,311.671,Any precedent of ours that justified that?
1984.83-529,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,311.671,312.249,--Excuse me?
1984.83-529,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,312.249,316.873,Any precedent of ours that justified not letting him leave?
1984.83-529,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,316.873,319.154,"Well, I do intend to get into that."
1984.83-529,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,330.712,333.476,How long was he in fact held after he had--
1984.83-529,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,333.476,337.036,"Well, this detention was from the time he was stopped--"
1984.83-529,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,337.036,339.473,"--No, after he asked to leave."
1984.83-529,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,339.473,349.579,"--I think he was already being detained at the time he was pulled over to the side of the road, so to my mind the fact that he asked to leave is irrelevant."
1984.83-529,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,361.792,364.9,"You are not suggesting there was probable cause to detain him, are you?"
1984.83-529,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,364.9,365.072,--No.
1984.83-529,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,389.312,392.467,And would it make any difference if it were an hour instead of 20 minutes?
1984.83-529,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,392.467,393.233,Yes.
1984.83-529,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,393.233,395.654,"What, if it were an hour?"
1984.83-529,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,397.294,401.417,"Well, we would have to know why it was an hour, but ordinarily--"
1984.83-529,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,401.417,402.042,"Well, the same reason."
1984.83-529,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,410.133,414.428,"--Well, I think we would still defend that as being consistent with the Fourth Amendment."
1984.83-529,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,414.428,415.551,Two hours?
1984.83-529,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,415.551,424.205,"Well, I think there is clearly an outer limit, because you would have to ask yourself whether it is reasonable under the circumstances to take some other means."
1984.83-529,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,457.269,462.844,"Mr. Frey, could I ask at this point, is the analysis the same with respect to Mr. Sharpe as it is with respect to Mr. Savage?"
1984.83-529,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,465.625,475.56,"Well, I would say that as to respondent Sharpe, there is no... he might as well have been sitting at home in Kansas City in terms of the discovery of the evidence."
1984.83-529,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,475.56,477.855,Except that he was by the side of the road with an officer telling him he couldn't go any place.
1984.83-529,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,480.697,486.35,"Well, it is possible, although we contend it is not true, that Sharpe was unlawfully detained."
1984.83-529,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,492.801,493.083,I understand.
1984.83-529,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,493.083,496.942,And whether Sharpe had... Sharpe could have been arrested without probable cause.
1984.83-529,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,498.582,502.081,"Your main position with respect to Sharpe is, he doesn't really have standing to object."
1984.83-529,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,502.878,508.375,"--It is that he doesn't have standing, but really standing and fruits are intertwined in this case."
1984.83-529,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,519.901,523.025,"--Really what I am trying to ask, I am trying to follow up on what Justice Brennan asked you."
1984.83-529,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,537.082,542.206,--I think it would be essentially the same length of time that they could detain either of them.
1984.83-529,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,548.266,551.125,They could detain Sharpe because they had reasonable suspicion about Savage?
1984.83-529,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,551.125,552.858,--And about Sharpe.
1984.83-529,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,552.858,554.311,That they might be connected.
1984.83-529,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,554.311,554.715,Because Sharpe and Savage were clearly together.
1984.83-529,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,609.537,624.0,"May I ask one other question about the... you mentioned in your description of the case that they apparently were speeding when they went in and out of the camp site or whatever, the pull-off part, and also that the camper in effect sort of sped away when he pulled the car over."
1984.83-529,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,624.0,624.594,Yes.
1984.83-529,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,624.594,633.356,"Do you rely on those two circumstances merely as buttressing your showing of probable smuggling activity, or do you rely on them in part as violations of law?"
1984.83-529,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,633.356,652.676,"Well, with respect to the speeding, I rely on it only insofar as an issue which is not before the Court, which is the validity of the initial stop, which the Court of Appeals didn't pass on."
1984.83-529,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,672.091,675.043,"Mr. Frey, I want to ask about this point if I may."
1984.83-529,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,685.303,685.788,--I believe that's correct.
1984.83-529,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,687.802,692.144,"Would it be remanded for that purpose then, since the Court of Appeals didn't decide it?"
1984.83-529,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,692.144,702.905,"Leaving aside the question of respondents' fugitivity, I would say that it would be within the discretion of this Court either to go ahead and decide it if it chose to or to remand it."
1984.83-529,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,719.51,727.163,Would we have enough before us in the record to determine the reasonable suspicion issue as it stands?
1984.83-529,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,727.163,730.365,"--Well, we think there quite clearly was enough to amount to a reasonable suspicion--"
1984.83-529,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,730.365,733.801,Of a narcotics... transportation of illegal drugs?
1984.83-529,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,733.801,734.91,"--Yes, we think so."
1984.83-529,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,736.144,747.56,"And so in responding to Justice Stevens, you are not asking the Court to rely on the speeding violation as--"
1984.83-529,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,747.56,769.021,"No, because... I think the speeding violation would justify the initial stop, but I don't think that carries the day for us because the problem here is the validity of detaining Savage for 15 or 20 minutes while Cooke was able to arrive on the scene and conduct his investigation."
1984.83-529,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,769.021,773.676,--I take it you also are not really relying on the pulling away of the van at the time they... they had already decided to stop them.
1984.83-529,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,773.676,775.097,That is true.
1984.83-529,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,780.987,787.061,Do you think that activity made it reasonable to detain them for a little longer than if he had not pulled away as--
1984.83-529,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,787.061,787.296,Definitely.
1984.83-529,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,788.265,794.355,"--So there is kind of reasonable suspicion enough to stop them, and then a little more reasonable suspicion to justify 15 minutes--"
1984.83-529,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,794.355,798.587,--It is not just that it adds to the increment of suspicion.
1984.83-529,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,798.587,799.571,--There are two levels of reasonable suspicion.
1984.83-529,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,799.571,805.053,"It is that it necessitates the extended detention, which otherwise would not have been necessary."
1984.83-529,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,805.053,805.256,I see.
1984.83-529,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,808.068,837.009,"Part of the question is whether it was justified to detain respondent Savage for 15 or 20 minutes until Cooke conducted his investigation, and we are saying that the fact that Savage sped off down the road, almost running into Thrasher's police car, and was only apprehended a half a mile away, separate, and there are only two police officers involved in the investigation, so if they wanted to investigate both of these individuals, one had to stop with one, the other had to pursue the other."
1984.83-529,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,893.971,896.891,"Your position basically is, heads you win, tails they lose."
1984.83-529,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,897.282,900.281,"Well, it's the same essentially as their position."
1984.83-529,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,909.683,920.851,"If your position is right, the third alternative in your reply brief, what motivation would the other side have to really fight the case as a true adversary, you know, all the problems that are involved in cases--"
1984.83-529,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,920.851,922.771,"--Well, the other side is not a true adversary."
1984.83-529,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,929.8,934.345,--But do you think that is an appropriate case for us to decide constitutional issues in--
1984.83-529,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,934.345,935.532,I have no doubt that--
1984.83-529,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,935.532,937.001,--when there is no way in the world that you can lose?
1984.83-529,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,937.001,950.199,"--Well, when you say that there is no way in the world that we can lose, it is as though we were here arguing about a constitutional question as in Milton against Wainwright, which may in the end turn out to be harmless error."
1984.83-529,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,995.977,1000.271,You mean there is no difference between amicus curiae and respondent?
1984.83-529,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1000.271,1006.3,"--Well, it is frequent in this Court's past jurisprudence that there has not been--"
1984.83-529,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1006.3,1008.456,That wasn't my question.
1984.83-529,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1009.924,1017.609,"--There is a difference, but I don't think it is a difference that deprives this case of its adversarial--"
1984.83-529,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1017.609,1020.265,"Well, it is not a normal adversarial proceeding, is it?"
1984.83-529,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1020.265,1025.043,"--Well, it is not a normal one, but it is one that is far from unknown to this Court."
1984.83-529,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1042.973,1046.238,"There is also a difference between a divorce and going to jail, believe it or not."
1984.83-529,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1046.238,1062.748,"--Well, the problem of... the Molinaro principle seems to me quite clearly to suggest that as far as the going to jail aspect of this case is concerned, respondents, by taking it upon themselves to become fugitives, are going to end up going to jail."
1984.83-529,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1082.724,1086.989,"Mr. Frey, had they been released before--"
1984.83-529,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1086.989,1087.77,--They were on bail.
1984.83-529,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1087.77,1088.815,"--Was that it, on bail?"
1984.83-529,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1088.815,1090.128,They were on bail.
1984.83-529,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1090.128,1092.595,And they forfeited the bail?
1984.83-529,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1093.236,1094.158,Bail has been forfeited.
1984.83-529,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1138.687,1146.637,"Well, I think you make a very persuasive argument that... at least alternate two, that if they are fugitives, they forfeit their right to have the benefit of any judgment."
1984.83-529,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1159.928,1167.378,In the Haslip case last term you had to appoint someone who was an amicus to defend the judgment of the Court of Appeals.
1984.83-529,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1167.378,1169.408,"That was not a fugitive involved, though."
1984.83-529,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1169.408,1170.533,"It did not involve a fugitive, but--"
1984.83-529,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1170.533,1181.028,"And the litigant himself... I mean, you have to look not only at the lawyer, but the litigant himself here has no interest in the... if we agree with you on Molinaro, the litigant himself has no interest in what happens in this case."
1984.83-529,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1181.028,1183.637,--That is precisely the argument that was made in the exclusionary rule case.
1984.83-529,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1183.637,1187.276,"Well, I realize that, and that is one of the unfortunate things about the courts."
1984.83-529,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1188.698,1201.38,"Well, but that was a little bit different, because there the claim was that the case was moot, or that we somehow had lost the right to pursue our case by deporting them, but the respondents had done nothing wrong other than their drug smuggling."
1984.83-529,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1208.861,1210.314,"Of course, they didn't bring this case."
1984.83-529,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1212.407,1213.281,We certainly did bring this case.
1984.83-529,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1213.281,1218.546,"The government locks over a whole list of cases, and finds the one that the man is gone and doesn't have any lawyer."
1984.83-529,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1218.546,1230.15,"No, when we petitioned, they were not fugitives, and when the Court granted this petition we were still unaware, and I am not sure whether Savage was a fugitive."
1984.83-529,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1268.291,1272.898,And won't there be another case just like this?
1984.83-529,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1272.898,1274.977,"--Well, that is the nature of cases before this Court by and large."
1984.83-529,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1277.927,1280.286,Right down by Myrtle Beach there will be another one.
1984.83-529,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1280.286,1281.582,There will certainly be other cases.
1984.83-529,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1344.65,1352.85,"Well, Mr. Frey, what is your suggestion as to the outer limit of time in circumstances where there may be detention?"
1984.83-529,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1352.85,1367.25,"My suggestion is that there is no hard and fast outer limit of time, and that the Court in fact made that quite clear in United States against Place when it rejected the ALI 20-minute formulation."
1984.83-529,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1373.154,1375.403,What formula do you suggest ought to guide us?
1984.83-529,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1375.403,1420.713,"--I suggest that the Court has adopted the formula of Professor LaFave in his treatise, which has been endorsed quite clearly in the opinion of the Court in Michigan against Summers, and essentially I would sum it up by saying that in determining whether a detention is reasonable, the inquiry should focus on the purpose of extending the detention, that is, the specific course of action that the police tend to pursue during the period, whether these actions are likely to produce confirmation of their suspicions within a relatively short period, and I am not willing to give a precise number to that."
1984.83-529,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1462.321,1463.773,I won't stop for that reason.
1984.83-529,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1463.773,1464.367,--Hm?
1984.83-529,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1464.367,1466.226,I won't stop for that reason.
1984.83-529,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1466.226,1476.8,"No, well, perhaps not, but I would like to suggest that even under your views that in this case the government's position ought to prevail, and let me explain that."
1984.83-529,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1601.688,1604.874,"Well, Mr. Frey, what do you do about this?"
1984.83-529,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1623.007,1627.942,There probably would have been no excuse in that case for extending the detention.
1984.83-529,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1627.942,1634.283,--What is the excuse for having people conduct drug investigations who aren't qualified?
1984.83-529,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1637.032,1638.532,Exigent circumstances--
1984.83-529,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1638.532,1641.469,--whether there was a less intrusive alternative.
1984.83-529,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1641.469,1646.654,"--Well, it wasn't planned in this case that Patrolman Thrasher would be conducting a drug investigation."
1984.83-529,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1647.263,1654.651,"Well, whether it was planned or not, I would suppose that experience would indicate that you might need two agents."
1984.83-529,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1658.68,1673.112,--There were a large group of agents who were conducting an investigation in a two-county area who were part of the task force that was investigating this suspected landing of large quantities of marijuana on the beaches of North Carolina.
1984.83-529,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1673.112,1677.921,"Nevertheless, if there had been two qualified agents, this case wouldn't be here probably."
1984.83-529,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1677.921,1688.528,"Well, I assume the detention would not have been as extended, but I find it hard to see how that could possibly have any effect on the correct disposition of this case."
1984.83-529,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1688.528,1688.887,Why?
1984.83-529,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1688.887,1701.958,"Because there cannot... I mean, unless you are saying that whatever number of agents they are going to use in an investigation, they ought to double them, so in case they run into two cars together, they have two people to stop them."
1984.83-529,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1701.958,1712.033,"Well, it seems to me that if a single agent is patrolling, I suppose he is out there to do something like making a stop if he has got reasonable suspicion."
1984.83-529,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1715.25,1717.625,"That's right, but the only help was--"
1984.83-529,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1717.625,1726.153,I thought that... is it unreasonable to suggest that the government ought to have... they ought to travel in pairs or not?
1984.83-529,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1726.153,1731.291,--This is a little bit like the suggestion of Florida against Royer that the government ought to have a dog handy at every airport.
1984.83-529,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1734.321,1738.055,"Or like in Place, they should have had one at every airport?"
1984.83-529,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1738.055,1740.616,"--Well, they don't have one at every airport."
1984.83-529,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1759.717,1762.184,"Well, they just take their risk, though, in terms of the Fourth Amendment."
1984.83-529,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1762.184,1780.974,"--If the Court concludes that the respondents should gain because Savage refused to stop when asked to stop and sped off down the highway and created this situation, which could not have been... I mean, even on your hypothesis, there is no reason why Cooke wouldn't suppose that one trained DEA agent would be enough."
1984.83-529,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1789.095,1792.641,"Well, you anticipate making arrests, and as soon as you decide to make a stop, you call for another agent."
1984.83-529,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1792.641,1798.217,"--Well, but the other agents, who knows where they were?"
1984.83-529,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1807.511,1813.508,The concern in Terry kind of stops is to don't do anything more than you really have to.
1984.83-529,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1813.508,1830.594,"--Well, don't do anything more than is reasonably necessary for the purpose of confirming or rebutting your suspicions within a reasonably short period of time, but I simply cannot see how the Court could say in this case that the agent--"
1984.83-529,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1830.594,1838.342,"Well, Mr. Frey, supposing that the camper was following... I don't know what kind of vehicle the other one was, a white Chevrolet or something, and the man, the agent was by himself."
1984.83-529,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1850.727,1858.412,--Now you are asking me... I have no doubt that he could call and ask for help in stopping that vehicle.
1984.83-529,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1860.379,1861.332,Just a green Chevrolet?
1984.83-529,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1861.332,1863.082,--Well--
1984.83-529,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1863.082,1864.487,"Well, you would have to be sure it is--"
1984.83-529,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1864.487,1871.907,"--At 7:00 o'clock in the morning, I think there probably would not have been four green Chevrolets speeding down the highway."
1984.83-529,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1871.907,1872.829,--Take a blue Honda then.
1984.83-529,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1873.468,1882.495,"The question is whether there is reasonable suspicion to justify the stop, and I have no difficulty in saying that he could call for help."
1984.83-529,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1892.148,1893.897,Mr. Kadish.
1984.83-529,1,36163,mark_j_kadish,,1893.897,1905.8,"Mr. Chief Justice, members of the Court, it is hard for me to refrain from calling Sharpe and Savage my clients since they were."
1984.83-529,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2146.891,2154.356,"When two cars travel together, one behind the other, and make a complete circle, they are not together?"
1984.83-529,1,36163,mark_j_kadish,,2154.356,2165.679,"That did suggest, I agree, Justice Marshall, that did suggest that they were together, but not that they were involved in criminal activity together, only that they were together."
1984.83-529,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2259.704,2264.671,Weren't there some observations by the agents that the car was riding low?
1984.83-529,1,36163,mark_j_kadish,,2264.671,2265.248,Yes.
1984.83-529,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2265.248,2272.088,And through all of this rather abnormal turning and weaving?
1984.83-529,1,36163,mark_j_kadish,,2272.088,2279.242,"The only abnormal turn, Mr. Chief Justice, was the turn through the campground."
1984.83-529,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2279.242,2280.554,The big circle that Justice Marshall referred to.
1984.83-529,1,36163,mark_j_kadish,,2280.554,2289.207,"If you look at the record, and you look at that on a map, which I believe is actually in the record, you see that there wasn't any weaving or erratic type of turn."
1984.83-529,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2312.759,2313.744,Taken into account--
1984.83-529,1,36163,mark_j_kadish,,2329.254,2334.376,I think I would have to concede the aggregate of the observations or what the officer should look at.
1984.83-529,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2365.957,2368.394,"Counsel, getting back to going around the circle--"
1984.83-529,1,36163,mark_j_kadish,,2368.394,2369.096,"--Yes, sir."
1984.83-529,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2369.096,2374.859,--do you agree that the best way to find out whether you are being followed is to make four right turns?
1984.83-529,1,36163,mark_j_kadish,,2374.859,2378.14,I couldn't disagree with that.
1984.83-529,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2378.14,2381.826,So when you make a circle it is the same thing.
1984.83-529,1,36163,mark_j_kadish,,2381.826,2382.388,Yes.
1984.83-529,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2382.388,2385.263,"So once they made the circle, they knew they were being followed."
1984.83-529,1,36163,mark_j_kadish,,2385.263,2387.105,I would say that was a fair--
1984.83-529,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2387.105,2391.073,And that's the time that any police officer knows that he has to make an arrest.
1984.83-529,1,36163,mark_j_kadish,,2391.073,2399.459,"--I am not as much debating here the articulable suspicion, although I think it is extremely weak."
1984.83-529,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2476.149,2480.475,"When you say a few minutes, do you have any particular amount of minutes in mind?"
1984.83-529,1,36163,mark_j_kadish,,2480.475,2490.534,"Well, it is hard to say what... the time that took place in Terry versus Ohio, I think, for example, just being actually that, a few minutes, two, three, four minutes for the patdown."
1984.83-529,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2490.534,2492.485,How about Michigan against Long?
1984.83-529,1,36163,mark_j_kadish,,2492.485,2498.249,I am not sure exactly what the time was in that case.
1984.83-529,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2646.815,2650.296,"Do you think, Mr. Kadish, that they were in any doubt about why they were being stopped?"
1984.83-529,1,36163,mark_j_kadish,,2655.701,2681.331,"No, they, I am sure, knew why they were stopped, but as I read it the Terry cases and the progeny are talking about the objective view of the officer... not of the officer, the objective view that a reasonable officer would have under the situation, not the accused, so that I believe that that is the test of the Court, and I believe that would be the answer to your question."
1984.83-529,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2706.18,2706.446,Mr. Kadish?
1984.83-529,1,36163,mark_j_kadish,,2706.446,2706.883,"--Yes, sir."
1984.83-529,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2706.883,2713.506,"You use the term ""under arrest"" or ""at gunpoint"" as if those were somehow inconsistent with a Terry stop."
1984.83-529,1,36163,mark_j_kadish,,2727.531,2739.573,"Well, except that... except that these people here... I should have used the term ""de facto arrest"", because I think that is the progression that you see in Dunaway versus New York."
1984.83-529,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2761.861,2763.814,What is a de facto arrest?
1984.83-529,1,36163,mark_j_kadish,,2763.814,2765.062,"--Well, I am not sure."
1984.83-529,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2792.411,2800.267,Supposing I try to make a Terry stop on reasonable suspicion and the person whom I am trying to stop simply tries to flee.
1984.83-529,1,36163,mark_j_kadish,,2808.093,2809.935,"I don't know the answer to that, sir."
1984.83-529,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2812.324,2823.055,"You suggested that the custody involved in a Terry stop is kind of a loose, floating thing that if the defendant wants to evade it he is free to evade it?"
1984.83-529,1,36163,mark_j_kadish,,2823.055,2830.411,"No, I am not saying he is free to evade it, but there has to be a justification, a reasonable justification to keep him for that period of time."
1984.83-529,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2830.411,2832.88,But supposing there is a reasonable justification.
1984.83-529,1,36163,mark_j_kadish,,2837.846,2849.451,"But Perhaps in this case, as Mr.... I mean, as Justice White has suggested, perhaps they didn't use their time wisely."
1984.83-529,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2849.451,2854.635,"Well, but I am not interested right now in whether they used their time wisely."
1984.83-529,1,36163,mark_j_kadish,,2865.834,2867.428,"That's right, per se inconsistent."
1984.83-529,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2932.308,2942.521,"In making that argument, Mr. Kadish, I haven't heard you say anything about the significance of their requests to be allowed to leave."
1984.83-529,1,36163,mark_j_kadish,,2942.521,2946.989,"--Oh, yes, and I thank Your Honor for the suggestion."
1984.83-529,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2984.036,3000.982,"Well, isn't that inconsistent with Mendenhall and with the combination of opinions in Florida against Royer which adopted Justice Stewart's test in Mendenhall that there is not even a seizure if the defendant objectively feels he is free to leave?"
1984.83-529,1,36163,mark_j_kadish,,3000.982,3038.139,"Well, as I said, in reading Mendenhall and reading Royer, I view the airport cases and the context in which they all arise, which is almost identical, as just having a special place in this Court, and I think the plurality decisions in Royer and Place... I think I have that right... show that the Court itself has not fully determined in which direction the airport cases are finally going to go."
1984.83-529,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3095.554,3101.255,"Well, your clients... your clients certainly opted to leave knowing they had no right to do so."
1984.83-529,1,36163,mark_j_kadish,,3101.255,3101.675,--Right.
1984.83-529,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3101.675,3114.234,And I just wonder whether they have a very good argument for saying the Court shouldn't deal with the issues that they were aware could be raised and were raised.
1984.83-529,1,36163,mark_j_kadish,,3114.234,3120.575,"Justice O'Connor, what can I say?"
1984.83-529,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3146.954,3149.688,How are they disadvantaged now?
1984.83-529,1,36163,mark_j_kadish,,3149.688,3155.842,"Well, I don't know that they are... I don't know that they are disadvantaged."
1984.83-529,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3180.769,3186.22,"Well, Mr. Kadish, if we agree with you, I suppose you know we would vacate the judgment below."
1984.83-529,1,36163,mark_j_kadish,,3186.22,3186.47,I know that.
1984.83-529,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3186.47,3187.985,And leave your clients in the soup.
1984.83-529,1,36163,mark_j_kadish,,3187.985,3192.546,"Well, as I said--"
1984.83-529,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3192.546,3197.403,"If you really feel good about your case, why don't you want us to decide it?"
1984.83-529,1,36163,mark_j_kadish,,3197.403,3199.09,"--Well, I do feel good about--"
1984.83-529,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3199.09,3199.808,You may win.
1984.83-529,1,36163,mark_j_kadish,,3200.527,3208.633,"--I do feel good about my case, but you know, sometimes... sometimes winning is not what it is all about exactly."
1984.83-529,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3208.633,3212.148,"Well, I know, but losing... if you win, your clients lose."
1984.83-529,1,36163,mark_j_kadish,,3215.943,3229.923,"I understand that, and if they lose, they lose in one way, and I guess perhaps down the line maybe they... in my own way they would win in another."
1984.83-529,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3236.124,3236.499,I suppose we've got to catch them.
1984.83-529,1,36163,mark_j_kadish,,3239.201,3240.748,That's right.
1984.83-529,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3249.714,3254.586,Mr. Frey?
1984.83-529,2,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3254.586,3259.397,I just wanted to make a couple of points.
1984.83-529,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3331.307,3335.944,"Mr. Frey, do you have any Courts of Appeals decisions in your favor on this?"
1984.83-529,2,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3335.944,3342.208,"--Yes, I think we have some, but I don't know that I could... they are cited in the brief."
1984.83-529,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3345.675,3347.457,How about state courts?
1984.83-529,2,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3347.457,3354.454,"--I am not at all familiar with the state courts, but I would rather have Supreme Court decisions in my favor, and I think I do."
1984.83-529,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3354.454,3357.873,"You don't... on these facts, you don't."
1984.83-529,2,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3364.793,3370.993,I am relying on an analysis or an approach that has been consistently in recent cases--
1984.83-529,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3370.993,3375.678,"That same approach, though, wouldn't justify two or three hours, I don't suppose."
1984.83-529,2,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3375.678,3380.021,"--No, I don't know whether we would be here suggesting that two or three hours would be permissible."
1984.83-529,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3380.021,3381.146,I don't know why not?
1984.83-529,2,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3381.146,3397.108,"Well, because the approach requires looking at the need to extend the detention, and it recognizes, as I think Dunaway, which was a totally different cases, recognizes, that there is an outer limit on the permissible length of time that you could detain somebody."
1984.83-529,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3466.907,3474.045,"Couldn't you argue that the officer could say, well, if you want to leave, go ahead, but I am keeping your truck?"
1984.83-529,2,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3482.432,3497.489,"Well, that would be true, although I think the principle of Michigan against Summers is that if you are going to find out very shortly whether you have a basis for arresting the individual or you hope to, then you are not obliged to let him go off into the twilight."
1984.83-529,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3497.489,3504.799,"Couldn't you argue that discovery of the marijuana was a fruit of the seizure of the truck, not the person?"
1984.83-529,2,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3504.799,3520.761,"You could, but I think one of the points that Mr. Kadish was in error about was that the Place case was very careful to make the point that at least in those circumstances it was not distinguishing between the seizure of the property and the seizure of the person, but was deeming them both regulated by the same standard."
1984.83-529,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3522.027,3523.089,"Thank you, gentlemen."
