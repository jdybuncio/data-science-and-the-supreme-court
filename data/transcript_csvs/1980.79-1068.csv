1980.79-1068,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,12.891,We will hear arguments next in the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission v. Associated Dry Goods Corporation.
1980.79-1068,0,18062,barry_sullivan,,61.805,65.108,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1980.79-1068,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,434.932,436.95,"The Court primarily held it violated 709(e), didn't it?"
1980.79-1068,0,18062,barry_sullivan,,436.95,440.586,"I believe, Mr. Justice--"
1980.79-1068,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,440.586,444.389,That's certainly the statutory provision upon which respondent primarily relies.
1980.79-1068,0,18062,barry_sullivan,,444.389,445.472,--That is correct.
1980.79-1068,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,445.472,454.078,"So that you don't really accurately state the question, that the question is a 709(e) question, not a 706(b) and 709(e) question."
1980.79-1068,0,18062,barry_sullivan,,454.078,457.197,"I recognize that is what Respondent asserts, Mr. Justice."
1980.79-1068,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,465.219,470.957,"So if it was right on either one, we could affirm?"
1980.79-1068,0,18062,barry_sullivan,,470.957,478.877,I think that would be correct although I don't think that the 4th Circuit was correct on either one.
1980.79-1068,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,478.877,480.579,You're talking about Judge Winters' opinion?
1980.79-1068,0,18062,barry_sullivan,,480.579,481.696,"Yes, Your Honor."
1980.79-1068,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,907.073,918.031,"Mr. Sullivan, what is the standard which you are proposing to us that should be followed in the determination of this issue?"
1980.79-1068,0,18062,barry_sullivan,,918.031,922.435,"Mr. Justice, I believe--"
1980.79-1068,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,922.435,926.654,Certainly you want to cover the charging parties and witnesses.
1980.79-1068,0,18062,barry_sullivan,,935.159,938.027,"--Yes, it has, Mr. Justice Blackmun."
1980.79-1068,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,952.537,962.81,"Well, initially, didn't they speak of authorizing disclosure where appropriate or necessary to the carrying out of the Commission's functions?"
1980.79-1068,0,18062,barry_sullivan,,962.81,966.445,"That is correct, Mr. Justice Blackmun."
1980.79-1068,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,966.445,974.118,"And what is it that... now, I get back to my first question... what are you proposing now that is distinct from that old approach?"
1980.79-1068,0,18062,barry_sullivan,,974.118,976.819,I don't think that it's distinct at all.
1980.79-1068,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1004.637,1008.124,"Yes, but sometimes we run into trouble with that."
1980.79-1068,0,18062,barry_sullivan,,1015.611,1023.983,"I don't believe that... that question is not easy to answer, Mr. Justice."
1980.79-1068,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1141.127,1141.894,In every case?
1980.79-1068,0,18062,barry_sullivan,,1179.335,1182.704,I think that's correct.
1980.79-1068,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1188.191,1190.041,Because of the lack of a comma after the word witnesses?
1980.79-1068,0,18062,barry_sullivan,,1190.041,1190.658,--Yes.
1980.79-1068,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1272.012,1283.618,"Of course, for the former alternative, I suppose the attorney could ask the respondent for authority to disclose the information and ask the respondent directly to make the disclosure, couldn't he?"
1980.79-1068,0,18062,barry_sullivan,,1283.618,1290.39,I suppose that is a twist.
1980.79-1068,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1290.39,1292.34,Suppose respondent would be motivated to do so?
1980.79-1068,0,18062,barry_sullivan,,1292.34,1300.994,Assuming that what was in the file left no shadow of a doubt that the case had no merit.
1980.79-1068,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1300.994,1306.398,"Well, or was persuasive in favor of settlement, which is a hypothesis that you're working in?"
1980.79-1068,0,18062,barry_sullivan,,1306.398,1309.7,I think that's possible.
1980.79-1068,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1335.85,1337.619,"Well, 709(e) is a criminal statute."
1980.79-1068,0,18062,barry_sullivan,,1337.619,1339.571,--That's correct.
1980.79-1068,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1339.571,1346.975,"And it doesn't provide any defense, even if it's done with consent of one or more of the interested parties."
1980.79-1068,0,18062,barry_sullivan,,1346.975,1348.325,That's correct.
1980.79-1068,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1348.325,1360.4,"No, but the hypothesis is that the company would be persuaded that if the information were disclosed, then the company could surely disclose it without any violation of the statute test."
1980.79-1068,0,18062,barry_sullivan,,1362.8,1374.392,"Of course it would be impossible for the charging party in those circumstances, if that were the construction of the statute, to know whether it was being given all of the material that was actually in the investigative file."
1980.79-1068,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1374.392,1377.344,"Well, the Commission could say, there is more information in the file."
1980.79-1068,0,18062,barry_sullivan,,1386.098,1387.383,That's true.
1980.79-1068,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1432.162,1439.048,Mr. Kaplan.
1980.79-1068,1,39711,roger_s_kaplan,,1439.048,1442.75,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1980.79-1068,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1458.776,1465.263,"Well, really, if we find they conflict with 709(e) of Title VII, that's the end of our inquiry, isn't it?"
1980.79-1068,1,39711,roger_s_kaplan,,1465.263,1466.965,"--Yes, I believe so."
1980.79-1068,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1466.965,1473.869,"Whether or not they foster litigation, whether or not 709(e) is wise or unwise, is none of our business, is it?"
1980.79-1068,1,39711,roger_s_kaplan,,1473.869,1481.125,"Well, I believe that if they do conflict with Section 709(e), yes--"
1980.79-1068,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1481.125,1489.129,"If 709(e) is part of what your brother simply just called the statutory mandate of the Commission, then that is its mandate, not to disclose."
1980.79-1068,1,39711,roger_s_kaplan,,1489.129,1490.364,--It is not to disclose.
1980.79-1068,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1852.484,1861.757,"But even on your first point, are you suggesting that the conciliation process contemplates any kind of compulsory disclosure by either party?"
1980.79-1068,1,39711,roger_s_kaplan,,1861.757,1863.09,"No, sir, not at all."
1980.79-1068,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1872.981,1881.235,"Would you question that disclosure would facilitate conciliation... laying aside the strictures of the statute, whatever they may be?"
1980.79-1068,1,39711,roger_s_kaplan,,1881.235,1894.978,"Well, it... not the disclosure advocated by my brother, but the disclosure which the charging party or the respondent wishes to have communicated to the other side."
1980.79-1068,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1905.351,1917.343,"Well, does that amount to saying that while litigation is conducted in a goldfish bowl, conciliation is to be conducted some other way?"
1980.79-1068,1,39711,roger_s_kaplan,,1917.343,1933.436,"Well, yes, I do believe that conciliation must be conducted privately in order to give the parties an opportunity to consider various proposals and weigh them without the pressure of public view on what they are doing."
1980.79-1068,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1933.436,1941.459,Is it a question of privacy or a question of conciliation being conducted with full knowledge of all the facts?
1980.79-1068,1,39711,roger_s_kaplan,,1948.196,1952.933,"It can be... well, it should be conducted in private, yes."
1980.79-1068,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2020.641,2028.147,"Now, do you take the position that you don't have full disclosure in a conciliatory matter?"
1980.79-1068,1,39711,roger_s_kaplan,,2033.468,2036.42,"Well, I think it's quite possible, Your Honor."
1980.79-1068,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2045.276,2047.895,Isn't it full disclosure?
1980.79-1068,1,39711,roger_s_kaplan,,2047.895,2062.154,"--No, I don't believe that's absolutely necessary, not to the extent of disclosing particular documents in the investigative file, the nitty-gritty of the investigation conducted by the Commission."
1980.79-1068,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2062.154,2064.62,Doesn't that prompt people to give it?
1980.79-1068,1,39711,roger_s_kaplan,,2064.62,2067.539,Pardon me?
1980.79-1068,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2067.539,2086.02,"Suppose you're representing a business firm, and they negotiate... the people on the EEOC say, we have information that you are charged with discriminating against three female employees."
1980.79-1068,1,39711,roger_s_kaplan,,2100.962,2103.295,"Well, if they are--"
1980.79-1068,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2103.295,2104.231,Wouldn't it?
1980.79-1068,1,39711,roger_s_kaplan,,2104.231,2116.122,"--Well, Your Honor is talking now about disclosure to the person whose agents have contributed to... have made these statements."
1980.79-1068,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2173.542,2197.157,Wouldn't it be within the authority of the Commission acting under its statutory authority to have a regulation that any information disclosed to the charging party or a complainant could not be made public without the approval of the Commission?
1980.79-1068,1,39711,roger_s_kaplan,,2205.661,2210.048,To the extent that it--
1980.79-1068,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2210.048,2212.0,"That would meet your problem, wouldn't it?"
1980.79-1068,1,39711,roger_s_kaplan,,2217.987,2225.658,"--Well, I don't think a regulation that simply tracks the language of the statute is particularly necessary."
1980.79-1068,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2252.642,2258.112,Which particular words are you now relying on?
1980.79-1068,1,39711,roger_s_kaplan,,2258.112,2260.998,"I'm referring, Your Honor, to the--"
1980.79-1068,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2260.998,2271.706,"""Shall be unlawful to make public? """
1980.79-1068,1,39711,roger_s_kaplan,,2271.706,2279.292,--I'm concerned with the disclosure prior to the filing of any proceeding under the title.
1980.79-1068,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2308.295,2316.882,"Well, now, specifically I gather that you think the provision in Regulation 1601.22 does not apply to"
1980.79-1068,1,39711,roger_s_kaplan,,2325.488,2326.773,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1980.79-1068,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2347.003,2379.039,"Going back to 709(e), would it not serve the purposes of the statute, that is, to protect against a general public disclosure, if the Commission provided in a rule or regulation that this early disclosure would be on condition that it's disclosed only to the party for the purposes of conciliation and could not be made public by that person?"
1980.79-1068,1,39711,roger_s_kaplan,,2385.378,2388.747,"I don't believe it would, Your Honor."
1980.79-1068,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2401.655,2416.664,"Of course, he's a member of the public but he's a member of the public different from all other members of the public in the sense that he claims to have a complaint and may have a valid complaint that calls for a remedy."
1980.79-1068,1,39711,roger_s_kaplan,,2416.664,2419.449,"He may, he may not."
1980.79-1068,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2766.344,2770.146,And why aren't those purposes served by disclosure?
1980.79-1068,1,39711,roger_s_kaplan,,2770.146,2783.203,"Because, Your Honor, the effect of the disclosures will be to impede the submission of the information to the Commission in the first place from the person who has it, the employer."
1980.79-1068,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2800.081,2806.819,"Well, very soon after that, the information is obtainable, is it not, and may be used against them by the charging party?"
1980.79-1068,1,39711,roger_s_kaplan,,2806.819,2811.306,"After suit is filed, Your Honor, it may be obtained and used."
1980.79-1068,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2980.499,2981.75,Thank you.
1980.79-1068,2,18062,barry_sullivan,,2984.536,2990.19,"I will be brief, Your Honor."
1980.79-1068,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3039.604,3044.325,You're saying that for these years they have been making this early disclosure?
1980.79-1068,2,18062,barry_sullivan,,3044.325,3046.777,"I'm sorry, Mr. Chief Justice?"
1980.79-1068,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3046.777,3052.347,"For all these years, they've been making the early disclosure that's now prohibited?"
1980.79-1068,2,18062,barry_sullivan,,3052.347,3052.664,That's correct.
1980.79-1068,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3054.064,3057.483,And no one has been prosecuted under the statute?
1980.79-1068,2,18062,barry_sullivan,,3062.636,3067.19,--To my knowledge there have been no prosecutions under the statute.
1980.79-1068,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3084.2,3087.77,--There are two or three.
1980.79-1068,2,18062,barry_sullivan,,3098.543,3100.661,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1980.79-1068,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3101.761,3107.831,"If the law is against the Commission, why would anybody need to go any further?"
1980.79-1068,2,18062,barry_sullivan,,3107.831,3111.449,"--Well, that... there are three cases, Your Honor."
1980.79-1068,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3118.87,3122.239,So once you do it once successfully that's the end of it; that's what the law is in that Circuit.
1980.79-1068,2,18062,barry_sullivan,,3122.239,3126.709,And in the 5th Circuit the law is to the contrary.
1980.79-1068,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3156.495,3168.453,"Mr. Sullivan, in any of these cases has the question ever arisen as to whether the employer has an implied private cause of action under the statute to institute litigation of this kind?"
1980.79-1068,2,18062,barry_sullivan,,3168.453,3173.106,"I don't believe it has, Mr. Justice Stevens."
1980.79-1068,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3173.106,3174.806,Does the Government concede there is such an implied--
1980.79-1068,2,18062,barry_sullivan,,3174.806,3196.389,"Well, we have, we will concede for the purposes of this case that because jurisdiction hasn't been briefed, or the cause of action hasn't been briefed, we will concede that the court below had jurisdiction probably under a theory like Chrysler v. Brown, relying on the Administrative Procedure Act, and in general--"
1980.79-1068,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3196.389,3203.476,--It is true that the exclusive provision in the statute relating to nondisclosure is a criminal penalty.
1980.79-1068,2,18062,barry_sullivan,,3207.278,3207.761,--That's correct.
1980.79-1068,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3222.254,3227.158,"--But this was both a declaratory judgment action and resistance to a subpoena, wasn't it?"
1980.79-1068,2,18062,barry_sullivan,,3227.158,3228.741,"That's correct, Mr. Justice Stevens."
1980.79-1068,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3228.741,3236.864,"Mr. Sullivan, would you look at the Joint Appendix at page 20 and help me a bit with the facts."
1980.79-1068,2,18062,barry_sullivan,,3250.94,3252.123,"Yes, Mr. Justice Powell."
1980.79-1068,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3252.123,3254.908,Are they the interrogatories filed by the Commission?
1980.79-1068,2,18062,barry_sullivan,,3254.908,3271.787,"This is an attachment to the Exhibit A, I believe, which is on page 17 and page 18, and these are the questions that were initially asked by the Commission of Joseph Horne."
1980.79-1068,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3288.815,3298.337,"Looking for the moment at the original ones, how many stores did those questions implicate?"
1980.79-1068,2,18062,barry_sullivan,,3342.116,3351.822,"Well, I haven't reviewed the materials that were actually produced in response to the subpoena so I'm not certain of what the answer actually is."
1980.79-1068,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3351.822,3356.107,Would it make any difference whether there were two or three thousand people they wanted the records of?
1980.79-1068,2,18062,barry_sullivan,,3356.107,3358.893,"I'm sorry, I didn't hear the last question."
1980.79-1068,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3358.893,3376.104,"Would it make any difference as to whether the information that would be sought and ultimately, perhaps, reach the public included just the charging parties and with whom they worked, or perhaps several hundred or several thousand other employees?"
1980.79-1068,2,18062,barry_sullivan,,3376.104,3387.062,"Well, I think that the answer in this case is that there are very few stores that are actually involved, but I'm not certain."
1980.79-1068,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3387.062,3393.899,"Apparently the Commission didn't know, because it asked the employer to list the number of stores the respondent has in Western Pennsylvania."
1980.79-1068,2,18062,barry_sullivan,,3393.899,3395.049,That's correct.
