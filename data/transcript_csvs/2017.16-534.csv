2017.16-534,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.28,"We'll hear argument next in Case 16-534, Rubin versus the Islamic Republic of Iran. Mr. Perlin."
2017.16-534,0,62873,asher_perlin,,7.28,49.72,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In 2008, Congress comprehensively overhauled the terrorism exception to foreign sovereign immunity to close gaps that had for years allowed foreign terror states to thumb their noses at U.S. judgments finding them liable for acts of terrorism while their victims were drawn into a long, bitter, and often futile search for scarce assets that would be subject to execution under the exceedingly narrow commercial exception to foreign sovereign immunity. The centerpiece of that legislation is Section 1610(g)."
2017.16-534,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,72.52,75.64,If -- if --
2017.16-534,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,75.64,76.52,Well --
2017.16-534,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,76.52,79.28,As provided in the section.
2017.16-534,0,62873,asher_perlin,,79.28,80.76,As provided in this section.
2017.16-534,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,101.96,118.0,"We know what -- that -- that Congress wanted to do away with what they call the Bancec factors, and this statute was written perfectly to do just that. You say it does something more."
2017.16-534,0,62873,asher_perlin,,118.0,119.8,"It has to do more, Your Honor."
2017.16-534,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,119.8,131.04,"And why does it have to? What the statute did is it made more assets available because you didn't have to worry whether it was the state itself, an instrumentality of the state, an agency."
2017.16-534,0,62873,asher_perlin,,144.72,145.88,"Well, there -- there's two questions there."
2017.16-534,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,151.44,152.88,Magic words under (a) and (b).
2017.16-534,0,62873,asher_perlin,,152.88,153.92,I'm sorry?
2017.16-534,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,153.92,174.76,"In 1610 in (a) and (b), Congress knew how directly to say property is not or is subject, immune from attachment. But it used something very different here. Rather, it says that property is, quote, ""subject to attachment as provided in this section."" Those are two very distinct formulations."
2017.16-534,0,62873,asher_perlin,,174.76,181.0,They are different. Subsections (a) and (b) were part of the original Foreign Sovereign Immunity Act from 1976.
2017.16-534,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,220.56,224.64,"Can they execute, your clients, on the embassy?"
2017.16-534,0,62873,asher_perlin,,224.64,225.76,So --
2017.16-534,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,225.76,249.92,"On the uniform -- on the uniforms that the people in the embassy wear, on -- on the papers that the ambassador keeps in his desk if, in fact, you read ""as provided in this section,"" the answer is no. If you read it to include because it has to be commercial, all right? Under your reading, where those words must mean something else, can't they do it?"
2017.16-534,0,62873,asher_perlin,,249.92,250.72,They cannot.
2017.16-534,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,250.72,251.44,Why not?
2017.16-534,0,62873,asher_perlin,,251.44,272.56,"Subsection -- Section 1609 says that Section 1610 -- execution under 1610 is subject to international agreements like the Vienna Convention which would protect diplomatic property, and Section 1611 protects military assets, certain central bank assets."
2017.16-534,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,272.56,272.92,Okay.
2017.16-534,0,62873,asher_perlin,,272.92,281.52,"Congress, when they enacted 1610(g), they did not completely abrogate foreign sovereign immunity for terror states."
2017.16-534,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,305.04,313.92,"What does ""as provided in this section"" mean? Am I right you think it incorporates only procedural requirements?"
2017.16-534,0,62873,asher_perlin,,313.92,317.28,"No, Your Honor there are a number of -- a number -- no, Your Honor."
2017.16-534,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,317.92,319.28,What does it -- what does it mean?
2017.16-534,0,62873,asher_perlin,,319.28,325.2,"It means, as provided -- the way to read it is it refers to the judgment that's entered under 1605A."
2017.16-534,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,432.12,432.36,If -- if --
2017.16-534,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,432.36,437.6,"So ""as provided in this section"" is really superfluous, isn't it --"
2017.16-534,0,62873,asher_perlin,,437.6,437.84,It's --
2017.16-534,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,437.84,438.92,-- under your interpretation?
2017.16-534,0,62873,asher_perlin,,438.92,439.84,It's not.
2017.16-534,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,496.2,496.88,I'm sorry.
2017.16-534,0,62873,asher_perlin,,520.44,525.32,"Well, that would -- that would -- that itself would abrogate Bancec, the rationale that University --"
2017.16-534,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,525.32,564.72,"Well, that -- not quite, because what -- I mean, this provision deals directly in aid of the plaintiffs in the Bancec case and in the others that had found against plaintiffs. There are at least three cases where a class of plaintiffs were found not to be in a sufficiently tied relationship to the foreign state and the plaintiffs there couldn't recover, so there was a real issue this was addressing, the fact that there were subsidiaries and agencies of foreign state who had commercial property, and it wasn't being made available to plaintiffs."
2017.16-534,0,62873,asher_perlin,,564.72,570.48,So the question would be to ask the Respondents why they don't mention those cases in their briefs.
2017.16-534,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,582.52,584.84,Why? It gave them what those three cases denied them.
2017.16-534,0,62873,asher_perlin,,593.92,603.88,The provisions that allow execution upon the property of an agency or instrumentality gives access to -- to the agency or instrumentality's property.
2017.16-534,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,603.88,605.0,"Well, give an example."
2017.16-534,0,62873,asher_perlin,,642.6,643.2,Well --
2017.16-534,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,643.2,645.92,I -- I would be surprised that they'd want to do that.
2017.16-534,0,62873,asher_perlin,,645.92,648.4,"We -- you might be surprised, but Congress has addressed --"
2017.16-534,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,648.4,650.6,"Your view is, yes, you could seize it?"
2017.16-534,0,62873,asher_perlin,,650.6,653.08,"It would depend on -- yes, you could."
2017.16-534,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,692.68,696.2,"Did that -- did that exist in, what was it, 1939 --"
2017.16-534,0,62873,asher_perlin,,696.2,696.56,It did not.
2017.16-534,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,697.32,699.0,-- when Chicago got this?
2017.16-534,0,62873,asher_perlin,,699.0,703.12,"But Congress could have made that provision retroactive, and it didn't. And Congress --"
2017.16-534,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,703.12,735.8,"But what about the provision that Congress did enact in -- and we've been talking about (g) and so -- so this is subsection (3), refers to ""nothing ... shall be construed to supersede the authority of a court to prevent ... the impairment of an interest held by a person who is not liable in the action."" Why isn't the University of Chicago such a person? They're certainly not liable in the action."
2017.16-534,0,62873,asher_perlin,,742.68,743.24,Uh-huh.
2017.16-534,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,743.24,746.24,"The Shah was in control, not the Ayatollah."
2017.16-534,0,62873,asher_perlin,,746.24,748.88,The University hasn't raised that as a defense.
2017.16-534,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,787.04,792.56,"Well, what are the terms of that? The University of Chicago has had this since 1939."
2017.16-534,0,62873,asher_perlin,,797.28,799.12,They have -- it's not a lease.
2017.16-534,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,840.76,841.56,The University of Chicago --
2017.16-534,0,62873,asher_perlin,,841.56,842.88,-- these artifacts remained in the University of Chicago.
2017.16-534,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,842.88,845.92,-- is not interested in this property for the money -- for money.
2017.16-534,0,62873,asher_perlin,,849.96,850.6,I know.
2017.16-534,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,850.6,853.76,"-- on display, to be researched, to be seen."
2017.16-534,0,62873,asher_perlin,,853.76,855.0,But it doesn't belong to them.
2017.16-534,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,860.52,865.92,"You're answering my question that, well, don't worry about University of Chicago, the district court can give them some money."
2017.16-534,0,62873,asher_perlin,,865.92,867.0,"No, not money."
2017.16-534,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,884.56,886.16,But what would those rights --
2017.16-534,0,62873,asher_perlin,,886.16,887.0,-- it's not all or nothing.
2017.16-534,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,888.6,893.04,-- be? Their rights have been from 1939 on they have this property.
2017.16-534,0,62873,asher_perlin,,893.04,899.16,"Well, since 1980, they've had the property because Iran couldn't get it back, for a big part of that time."
2017.16-534,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,929.16,935.96,"Well, assuming you're right, does that mean, if you lose here, you think Iran will be able to repatriate the assets?"
2017.16-534,0,62873,asher_perlin,,935.96,936.52,Absolutely.
2017.16-534,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,960.64,962.6,They have other things in the United States.
2017.16-534,0,62873,asher_perlin,,991.2,991.6,Well --
2017.16-534,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,991.6,996.92,"Now -- now, that's not perhaps going to turn out to be relevant to the decision."
2017.16-534,0,62873,asher_perlin,,1002.76,1003.4,Okay.
2017.16-534,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1072.88,1073.64,That just seems like --
2017.16-534,0,62873,asher_perlin,,1073.64,1073.96,-- in the Treasury.
2017.16-534,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1073.96,1075.84,-- an issue Congress has to address.
2017.16-534,0,62873,asher_perlin,,1075.84,1076.16,"Well, Congress --"
2017.16-534,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1076.16,1077.68,And those courts may well be wrong.
2017.16-534,0,62873,asher_perlin,,1078.16,1084.52,What I'm saying is that the practical difference between our construction and the Respondents' construction is not antiquities.
2017.16-534,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1122.16,1125.08,"That's what you're doing yourself in this case; that's what it is, isn't it?"
2017.16-534,0,62873,asher_perlin,,1125.08,1126.28,That's all that they've left.
2017.16-534,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1179.2,1179.76,Is there anything --
2017.16-534,0,62873,asher_perlin,,1179.76,1180.76,The United States doesn't --
2017.16-534,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1180.76,1190.08,Is -- is there anything in the legislative record that shows that Congress was intending to do anything other than dispense with the Bancec?
2017.16-534,0,62873,asher_perlin,,1190.08,1191.32,Absolutely.
2017.16-534,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1191.32,1191.56,Yes?
2017.16-534,0,62873,asher_perlin,,1191.56,1200.6,"Yes, it says that it applies -- that the provision will apply to any property in which the foreign state has a beneficial ownership."
2017.16-534,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1305.36,1319.44,Do you have any other section that dispenses with the sovereign immunity then that doesn't mention -- doesn't say anything that refers to immunity?
2017.16-534,0,62873,asher_perlin,,1319.44,1323.16,"Well, I mentioned Section 1610(f)(1)."
2017.16-534,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1361.64,1362.12,All right.
2017.16-534,0,62873,asher_perlin,,1370.76,1370.92,Yes.
2017.16-534,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1370.92,1372.88,-- you provided this morning.
2017.16-534,0,62873,asher_perlin,,1374.2,1382.28,I think that the best construction is that it refers to the judgment entered under 1605A.
2017.16-534,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1523.04,1533.12,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Strauss."
2017.16-534,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,1533.12,1541.92,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Let me first pick up on a piece of the legislative history that my friend quoted to the Court."
2017.16-534,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1668.72,1684.6,"Well, you do think -- agree with him, don't you, that the property of a foreign state in -- in (g)(1) is a -- is a strong indication at least that it is not limited to overturning the Bancec decision?"
2017.16-534,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,1684.6,1686.88,"No, I -- I don't agree with that, Mr. Chief Justice."
2017.16-534,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1714.96,1718.2,But Bancec wasn't about property of a foreign state.
2017.16-534,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,1723.16,1751.8,"It's -- it is -- that is -- it's right that Bancec was not about the property of a state itself, but the way the section is written, property of a state including property that is in a separate juridical entity or is an interest held directly or indirectly in a separate juridical entity, what you see in the legislative history is a lot of concern that state judgment debtors would be arranging their assets in ways that would distance themselves from ownership."
2017.16-534,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1751.8,1781.48,"Is it the case there on that particular point -- I was trying to work out that does Bancec ever apply -- could it apply to funds or -- yeah, funds of the foreign state itself? Is there anything that suggests it applies where the -- where the foreign state deposits some money in a bank? And then they argue, we -- that isn't our money, that's the bank's money, and we're just the beneficial owner of that money."
2017.16-534,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,1788.08,1790.04,"I'll -- I'll say two things to that, Justice --"
2017.16-534,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1790.04,1791.24,What about that argument?
2017.16-534,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,1791.24,1791.88,-- Justice Breyer.
2017.16-534,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1818.52,1820.08,"Well, it doesn't want them to cover everything in every case."
2017.16-534,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,1834.4,1841.28,"Well, I think the certain actions, Mr. Chief Justice, are actions to execute judgments under 1605A."
2017.16-534,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1876.84,1881.04,"Mr. Strauss, I think you were cut off on three independent reasons."
2017.16-534,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,1883.52,1885.6,Two was the -- the repetition --
2017.16-534,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1885.6,1889.04,The one you were just talking about.
2017.16-534,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,1889.04,1892.16,Not the repetition of -- shall not be immune.
2017.16-534,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2113.56,2122.44,"Thank you, counsel."
2017.16-534,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,2122.44,2124.32,Thank you very much.
2017.16-534,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2124.32,2126.6,Mr. Tripp.
2017.16-534,2,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,2126.6,2136.52,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: These ancient Persian artifacts are immune from execution under 1609, and nothing in 1610(g) lifts that immunity."
2017.16-534,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2201.8,2202.4,Don't they --
2017.16-534,2,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,2202.4,2203.6,-- to draft a statute.
2017.16-534,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2203.6,2214.88,Don't they explain (a)(7) as being present to permit state law claims based on the same actions as the federal action?
2017.16-534,2,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,2214.88,2215.32,So --
2017.16-534,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2215.32,2217.84,That would render (a)(7) --
2017.16-534,2,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,2217.84,2220.92,"So we -- we don't think that's right, and we also just don't think it really helps them."
2017.16-534,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2220.92,2223.12,"I know you're saying it, but explain to me why."
2017.16-534,2,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,2223.12,2223.28,Yes.
2017.16-534,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2315.12,2329.96,"Well, how about the cases, the other cases he was talking about, the ones with proceeds in the bank from a commercial activity, et cetera? His reading would take care of those rulings, wouldn't they?"
2017.16-534,2,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,2329.96,2351.84,"I -- so I think one thing about -- the way we read the statute too, I think it does help to some extent with -- with the breadth of the using commercial activity, is that the way we read (g), once you -- if you have a judgment against the foreign state, you can pierce the veil down through to the agency or instrumentality, and then you can go after the agency or instrumentality's property under (b)(3)."
2017.16-534,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2358.64,2361.36,So you think those other courts were wrong?
