1984.84-497,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,7.254,We will hear arguments next in Thomas against Union Carbide.
1984.84-497,0,35258,lawrence_gerald_wallace,,13.841,47.645,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this is a follow-up to last term's decision in Ruckelshaus against Monsanto Company in which this Court sustained the constitutionality of the data use and disclosure provisions of the federal statute regulating the marketing and sale of pesticides, known as FIFRA."
1984.84-497,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,597.973,601.774,"Mr. Wallace, are you suggesting that Part B of the award is improper?"
1984.84-497,0,35258,lawrence_gerald_wallace,,601.774,611.296,"That is the view that we have taken about what the proper statutory standard is, but the Court... I am not saying the Court should reach that question."
1984.84-497,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,646.469,651.621,"Well, Mr. Wallace, how much judicial review of permitted of these awards from the statute?"
1984.84-497,0,35258,lawrence_gerald_wallace,,651.621,666.363,"That is the question at issue in the District Court for the District of Columbia in the case between Stauffer and PPG, and we have not taken a position on that precise question yet."
1984.84-497,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,666.363,668.732,I thought the statute limited it to fraud.
1984.84-497,0,35258,lawrence_gerald_wallace,,668.732,683.423,"Well, we thought the same thing in a case decided last Wednesday, Lindahl against the Office of Personnel Management, but statutes are subject to construction on the question of the scope of judicial review, and--"
1984.84-497,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,683.423,685.775,I don't know what Lindahl has got to do with this.
1984.84-497,0,35258,lawrence_gerald_wallace,,685.775,691.745,"--Well, it was a construction of that particular statutory provision."
1984.84-497,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,691.745,692.062,He is just bruised.
1984.84-497,0,35258,lawrence_gerald_wallace,,695.03,715.543,"As it happens, in this particular arbitration award, the arbitrators themselves suggested a scope of judicial review that is perhaps debatable under this statute in Footnote 1 on Page 43 of the Joint Appendix."
1984.84-497,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,733.089,735.941,A little broader than just fraud.
1984.84-497,0,35258,lawrence_gerald_wallace,,735.941,747.665,"That is correct, and the statute does say that the awards are reviewable only for fraud, misrepresentation, or misconduct on the part of the parties or the arbitrators, which leaves--"
1984.84-497,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,747.665,758.12,"Well, what puzzles me about that footnote, that kind of assumes there is a law to be applied in determining the amount, and I don't know what that law the arbitrator is supposed to apply is."
1984.84-497,0,35258,lawrence_gerald_wallace,,760.989,780.234,"--Well, we have pointed out on Page 4 of our reply brief that the legislative history seems just quite clear that the compensation provision is intended to effect an equitable sharing of the costs of generating the data."
1984.84-497,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,801.73,806.532,It was that part of your brief together with your argument that made me wonder whether you were questioning Part B of the award.
1984.84-497,0,35258,lawrence_gerald_wallace,,806.532,815.571,"Well, what... for purposes of this case, obviously the accuracy of the award is not at issue."
1984.84-497,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,848.458,857.564,"It is your position that you have a right to question B, but you haven't got any place to question it, any forum."
1984.84-497,0,35258,lawrence_gerald_wallace,,857.564,860.266,"--Well, that is to be litigated in this next case."
1984.84-497,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,860.266,861.716,What forum are you going to question it in?
1984.84-497,0,35258,lawrence_gerald_wallace,,861.716,866.253,"Well, that is now in the District Court for the District of Columbia, Justice Marshall."
1984.84-497,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,866.253,867.153,"Well, it is not here."
1984.84-497,0,35258,lawrence_gerald_wallace,,867.153,867.586,"It is not here, no."
1984.84-497,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,937.746,943.733,"Mr. Wallace, may I ask you... maybe this is foreign to this case, but I would be very much interested in your answer."
1984.84-497,0,35258,lawrence_gerald_wallace,,959.509,983.208,"Well, under the statute, they can start marketing prior to the resolution of the compensation issue, so they can market once they have the registration, and if they have made an offer to compensate, no matter how long it then takes to resolve the amount of compensation."
1984.84-497,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1066.343,1071.413,"Well, it is really not a question of lack of ripeness as to Stauffer."
1984.84-497,0,35258,lawrence_gerald_wallace,,1079.836,1081.253,That is our position.
1984.84-497,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1253.898,1261.501,"Mr. Wallace, would you characterize the rights of the claimants here as public or private rights?"
1984.84-497,0,35258,lawrence_gerald_wallace,,1261.501,1268.24,"Well, they don't fit conveniently into either of those labels."
1984.84-497,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1402.577,1427.559,You don't think that these lock like the kind of private federally created rights that require adjudication as to law and procedural issues in Article 3 courts as suggested in the North Pipeline plurality opinion?
1984.84-497,0,35258,lawrence_gerald_wallace,,1427.559,1428.709,"--Well, we think not."
1984.84-497,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1508.462,1508.912,Mr. Wallace.
1984.84-497,0,35258,lawrence_gerald_wallace,,1508.912,1509.312,Yes?
1984.84-497,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1509.312,1510.478,I still am at a loss.
1984.84-497,0,35258,lawrence_gerald_wallace,,1520.767,1530.989,"Well, the government hasn't taken a position on that, but certainly the statute is capable of a construction that that would be subject to judicial review."
1984.84-497,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1533.841,1535.659,The statute doesn't tell me that.
1984.84-497,0,35258,lawrence_gerald_wallace,,1535.659,1543.215,"Well, that is an arguable construction of what misconduct by the arbitrator means."
1984.84-497,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1543.215,1546.484,That is the nearest you can get to giving some relief?
1984.84-497,0,35258,lawrence_gerald_wallace,,1546.484,1547.651,That is correct.
1984.84-497,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1595.482,1599.869,"Mr. Wallace, what about other forms of arbitration such as under the Federal Arbitration Act?"
1984.84-497,0,35258,lawrence_gerald_wallace,,1603.504,1604.438,I would say so.
1984.84-497,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1606.355,1614.609,"Or here you don't have to go into this system, but if you do, then you are stuck with arbitration if you can't agree."
1984.84-497,0,35258,lawrence_gerald_wallace,,1615.442,1615.875,That is--
1984.84-497,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1615.875,1618.394,Does that make a distinction from the Article 3 argument?
1984.84-497,0,35258,lawrence_gerald_wallace,,1624.898,1626.833,--Those--
1984.84-497,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1626.833,1631.402,"Those, you certainly don't go into court every time you lose an arbitration."
1984.84-497,0,35258,lawrence_gerald_wallace,,1631.402,1631.835,--That is correct.
1984.84-497,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1631.835,1632.552,And you can.
1984.84-497,0,35258,lawrence_gerald_wallace,,1634.454,1635.587,They arise out of a contract.
1984.84-497,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1635.587,1637.12,These people weren't forced to do this.
1984.84-497,0,35258,lawrence_gerald_wallace,,1637.12,1643.642,"They were not forced to get registrations, but of course they are commercially valuable."
1984.84-497,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1647.594,1654.765,Mr. Weinstein.
1984.84-497,1,34018,kenneth_ward_weinstein,,1654.765,1674.51,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court, under our system of government, it is the courts, not arbitrators, who have the constitutional responsibility to interpret and apply the law."
1984.84-497,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1674.51,1679.564,"What about parties, as Justice Brennan just suggested, who consented to go into an arbitration?"
1984.84-497,1,34018,kenneth_ward_weinstein,,1679.564,1684.95,"I think that is a distinguishable situation, because here the appellees have not consented."
1984.84-497,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1687.084,1688.552,Were they forced to go into the program?
1984.84-497,1,34018,kenneth_ward_weinstein,,1688.552,1690.771,"--Yes, they were forced because--"
1984.84-497,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1690.771,1693.723,Forced to enter the program in the first place?
1984.84-497,1,34018,kenneth_ward_weinstein,,1693.723,1700.96,"--In the first place, no, but the statute was passed after my clients submitted most of the data that are at issue here."
1984.84-497,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1712.101,1731.446,"In other words, are you saying that if the government sets up a grant program of some kind, hypothetically now, and provides that all disputes between these private parties should be resolved by arbitration, final and binding, that can be done prospectively?"
1984.84-497,1,34018,kenneth_ward_weinstein,,1731.446,1736.316,I would suggest that it cannot be done prospectively.
1984.84-497,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1736.316,1740.202,"Well, perhaps I haven't made my hypothetical clear."
1984.84-497,1,34018,kenneth_ward_weinstein,,1755.797,1756.614,That's correct.
1984.84-497,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1756.614,1758.53,But what about the other situation?
1984.84-497,1,34018,kenneth_ward_weinstein,,1758.53,1775.008,"Well, the other situation is prospective, and I would submit that Article 3 of the Constitution says that when you have an exercise of judicial power, whether it is prospective or retrospective, that has to be done by Article 3 courts."
1984.84-497,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1788.618,1790.035,"Well, say you win here."
1984.84-497,1,34018,kenneth_ward_weinstein,,1797.724,1801.943,"A jury trial, I have not examined whether a jury trial would--"
1984.84-497,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1801.943,1802.793,"Well, that is a constitutional right."
1984.84-497,1,34018,kenneth_ward_weinstein,,1802.793,1806.928,--It may or may not be in this particular situation.
1984.84-497,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1812.399,1820.003,"Well, it is... a right to a jury trial says you are going to have your facts determined by a particular tribunal, tribunals."
1984.84-497,1,34018,kenneth_ward_weinstein,,1820.003,1828.508,"Yes, but in this case I think the constitutional right that we are discussing is Article 3."
1984.84-497,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1834.262,1842.934,An Article 3 court composed like same other... like some other provision requires it to be composed?
1984.84-497,1,34018,kenneth_ward_weinstein,,1848.822,1850.79,--We are not... I don't understand the question.
1984.84-497,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1852.207,1854.059,"Well, you are asking for an Article 3 court--"
1984.84-497,1,34018,kenneth_ward_weinstein,,1854.059,1854.576,Yes.
1984.84-497,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1854.576,1861.33,"--and an Article 3 court in a civil case is, whoever wants it gets a jury trial."
1984.84-497,1,34018,kenneth_ward_weinstein,,1861.33,1872.203,"I am not an expert on the Seventh Amendment and the Sixth Amendment, but I believe that a jury trial does not apply to all actions necessarily that the federal courts have cognizance over, and we are not asking--"
1984.84-497,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1872.203,1880.909,"It is because Congress can define a statutory right, a special right, and assign it to a particular agency that doesn't give jury trials."
1984.84-497,1,34018,kenneth_ward_weinstein,,1880.909,1884.345,"--Congress may be able to do that, and we are not asking for a jury trial."
1984.84-497,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1925.705,1937.73,"Well, Mr. Weinstein, even the plurality in Northern Pipeline recognized some exceptions to the requirement for Article 3 courts, did it not?"
1984.84-497,1,34018,kenneth_ward_weinstein,,1937.73,1940.182,"Yes, it did recognize exceptions, and--"
1984.84-497,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1940.182,1943.234,Do you think it did so correctly?
1984.84-497,1,34018,kenneth_ward_weinstein,,1943.234,1946.251,"--I would say that they did so correctly, that the plurality is correct."
1984.84-497,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1946.251,1946.918,All right.
1984.84-497,1,34018,kenneth_ward_weinstein,,1963.48,1964.713,It is a--
1984.84-497,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1964.713,1974.088,In which Congress has provided that it will be resolved in a particularized tribunal?
1984.84-497,1,34018,kenneth_ward_weinstein,,1974.088,1984.427,"--Yes, Justice O'Connor, that is correct, that the right arises under federal law, but the plurality in Northern Pipeline made a very important point."
1984.84-497,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2060.475,2066.379,"Why couldn't you call it an arbitration court, c-o-u-r-t?"
1984.84-497,1,34018,kenneth_ward_weinstein,,2066.379,2068.795,You could if they were Article 3 judges.
1984.84-497,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2070.781,2077.601,"And if it was an arbitration court within Article 3 judge, it is all right?"
1984.84-497,1,34018,kenneth_ward_weinstein,,2077.601,2084.605,I think that if the person who is deciding the case is an Article 3 judge--
1984.84-497,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2084.605,2085.655,That's what I said.
1984.84-497,1,34018,kenneth_ward_weinstein,,2085.655,2089.575,"--then I think you have an Article 3 court, and I think the rights--"
1984.84-497,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2089.575,2095.829,"The only thing wrong with this is, it is not called a court, and you don't have an Article 3 judge."
1984.84-497,1,34018,kenneth_ward_weinstein,,2099.897,2105.418,"--Justice Marshall, that is of very major... that is of very major importance that these are not Article 3 judges."
1984.84-497,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2105.418,2107.001,"Well, what else are you quarreling about?"
1984.84-497,1,34018,kenneth_ward_weinstein,,2107.001,2107.67,Excuse me?
1984.84-497,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2107.67,2112.338,What else do you complain about?
1984.84-497,1,34018,kenneth_ward_weinstein,,2112.338,2113.107,We are complaining--
1984.84-497,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2113.107,2114.09,That is all you are complaining about?
1984.84-497,1,34018,kenneth_ward_weinstein,,2114.09,2130.616,"--That is all we are complaining about, that we have no right to an Article 3 judge, and if I may illustrate what happened in this Stauffer arbitration, these judges are appointed at the whim of the federal--"
1984.84-497,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2130.616,2132.302,But the magistrate are not Article 3 judges.
1984.84-497,1,34018,kenneth_ward_weinstein,,2132.302,2135.187,--The magistrates don't have final power to decide the law.
1984.84-497,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2135.187,2136.587,Awful close.
1984.84-497,1,34018,kenneth_ward_weinstein,,2138.122,2147.327,"It may be, but there is still an Article 3 judge who has that final power to accept or not accept recommendations from the magistrate."
1984.84-497,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2147.327,2149.679,How much law is there in a case like this?
1984.84-497,1,34018,kenneth_ward_weinstein,,2173.129,2181.482,"Justice Rehnquist, I think what you are suggesting is that you could have an adjudication of money claims, and they may very well and do involve legal issues."
1984.84-497,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2187.888,2191.34,Maybe Congress really didn't intend to have much of a standard.
1984.84-497,1,34018,kenneth_ward_weinstein,,2194.225,2197.343,"Well, if it did that, then it violates Article 1, as we have claimed."
1984.84-497,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2204.614,2212.62,"What if Congress said in so many words, we instruct the arbitrators to decide as justice and equity may indicate?"
1984.84-497,1,34018,kenneth_ward_weinstein,,2218.591,2219.591,It may be.
1984.84-497,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2231.164,2239.451,You insist on imprisoning this whole thing within a framework of Article 3 judges when maybe that isn't what Congress intended.
1984.84-497,1,34018,kenneth_ward_weinstein,,2239.451,2241.886,I don't think it is what Congress intended.
1984.84-497,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2241.886,2245.355,"You are saying if they did intend it, it is invalid."
1984.84-497,1,34018,kenneth_ward_weinstein,,2245.355,2247.174,That is exactly what we are saying.
1984.84-497,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2247.79,2256.379,"Why is this any more ripe for decision than Monsanto last year, because Stauffer is not complaining?"
1984.84-497,1,34018,kenneth_ward_weinstein,,2256.379,2264.151,"--Stauffer is very much complaining, and that is a misdirection that I think is totally inaccurate."
1984.84-497,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2301.09,2306.376,"But there is litigation going on in the D.C. courts, is there not, on the amount of the award?"
1984.84-497,1,34018,kenneth_ward_weinstein,,2306.376,2310.362,"That's correct, PPG is trying to set the award aside."
1984.84-497,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2310.362,2313.347,"Your position in that case is, there is no review?"
1984.84-497,1,34018,kenneth_ward_weinstein,,2313.347,2320.82,"Our position is that there is no review because that is what the statute says, and the only person who can change that is the Congress."
1984.84-497,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2320.82,2323.672,"But your opponent takes a different view, I take it."
1984.84-497,1,34018,kenneth_ward_weinstein,,2323.672,2324.738,They take a different view.
1984.84-497,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2325.455,2326.624,They say there is some sort of review.
1984.84-497,1,34018,kenneth_ward_weinstein,,2336.73,2344.501,"We have filed a conditional counterclaim, but the conditional counterclaim is based on the fact that there is no judicial review."
1984.84-497,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2353.624,2356.826,Why is that use invalid?
1984.84-497,1,34018,kenneth_ward_weinstein,,2360.878,2363.747,We have sued EPA in this suit.
1984.84-497,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2394.368,2396.618,"Well, your claim then is strictly statutory."
1984.84-497,1,34018,kenneth_ward_weinstein,,2401.088,2402.022,"No, we do not."
1984.84-497,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2415.015,2416.448,Mr. Weinstein--
1984.84-497,1,34018,kenneth_ward_weinstein,,2416.448,2423.538,"But this case is... let me deal with one issue of ripeness and justiciability, and get that out of the way."
1984.84-497,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2513.811,2515.397,--May I ask a question on that?
1984.84-497,1,34018,kenneth_ward_weinstein,,2539.527,2542.063,If there was no law to apply whatsoever.
1984.84-497,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2542.063,2543.998,I gave you one where there is law to apply.
1984.84-497,1,34018,kenneth_ward_weinstein,,2543.998,2544.748,If there is law to--
1984.84-497,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2544.748,2546.866,Ten percent of your labor costs in--
1984.84-497,1,34018,kenneth_ward_weinstein,,2546.866,2558.74,"--If there is law to apply, then I believe only the federal courts, the judiciary has that power, the final power under the Constitution to say what the law is."
1984.84-497,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2578.821,2580.638,"--Well, we still get life tenure."
1984.84-497,1,34018,kenneth_ward_weinstein,,2584.975,2588.776,"But that doesn't help my clients, Justice Rehnquist."
1984.84-497,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2588.776,2613.811,"Do you think Congress and the statute can't delegate the enforcement of the statute with the power to adjudicate in an administrative agency and say that... give the agency some standards, and then say that their determination shall not be subject to any judicial review?"
1984.84-497,1,34018,kenneth_ward_weinstein,,2620.798,2622.667,Absolutely they cannot.
1984.84-497,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2633.038,2648.315,"Have you come across a Court of Appeals opinion, some circuit, I don't remember, which held that the International Claims Commission provision of final, binding conclusions by the Commission was valid?"
1984.84-497,1,34018,kenneth_ward_weinstein,,2648.315,2652.269,"I do not recall that, Chief Justice Burger."
1984.84-497,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2697.981,2701.383,What about the Federal Arbitration Act?
1984.84-497,1,34018,kenneth_ward_weinstein,,2701.383,2704.735,--That arises under contract.
1984.84-497,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2704.735,2712.757,"Congress can enforce a contract to arbitrate, but can't impose arbitration unilaterally?"
1984.84-497,1,34018,kenneth_ward_weinstein,,2712.757,2716.276,The contract is entered into by the parties voluntarily.
1984.84-497,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2716.276,2718.944,Isn't that what we held in Brayman against Zapata?
1984.84-497,1,34018,kenneth_ward_weinstein,,2718.944,2724.632,That where it is done voluntarily I don't think we have an Article 3 problem.
1984.84-497,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2732.971,2745.379,"Would you press your Article 3 argument if this statute permitted some judicial review of the arbitration award other than just fraud, misconduct, and so forth?"
1984.84-497,1,34018,kenneth_ward_weinstein,,2745.379,2746.898,I have two answers to that.
1984.84-497,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2778.083,2782.154,"You are not giving up your article 3 judge now, are you?"
1984.84-497,1,34018,kenneth_ward_weinstein,,2782.154,2783.071,We want our Article 3 judge.
1984.84-497,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2783.071,2786.539,"Yes, well, you have mentioned it right now."
1984.84-497,1,34018,kenneth_ward_weinstein,,2789.325,2790.358,I don't understand the question.
1984.84-497,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2790.358,2795.844,"If there is a review, it must be before an Article 3 judge."
1984.84-497,1,34018,kenneth_ward_weinstein,,2795.844,2796.594,Yes.
1984.84-497,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2796.594,2797.763,You didn't say that.
1984.84-497,1,34018,kenneth_ward_weinstein,,2797.763,2799.53,That is what I meant.
1984.84-497,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2799.53,2801.198,I just wondered whether you had given it up.
1984.84-497,1,34018,kenneth_ward_weinstein,,2801.198,2804.517,"If there is a review, it has to be before an Article 3 judge."
1984.84-497,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2806.186,2811.804,"Just as an agency, something coming from the Federal Communications Commission would come to the Court of Appeals."
1984.84-497,1,34018,kenneth_ward_weinstein,,2816.225,2822.196,"That would ordinarily involve a public right, if I am correct, the issues that--"
1984.84-497,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2822.196,2823.412,"Well, it might involve a private right."
1984.84-497,1,34018,kenneth_ward_weinstein,,2833.253,2852.331,"--We want the same kind of Article 3 involvement that was granted in Northern Pipeline in the plurality decision, which was that the essential attributes of judicial power, whatever those are, must be in an Article 3 court, not in arbitrators."
1984.84-497,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2871.476,2874.027,What state law rights are being adjudicated?
1984.84-497,1,34018,kenneth_ward_weinstein,,2874.027,2887.754,"In the arbitration, the arbitrators are deciding how much money is owed for the use of trade secrets, and this Court held in Monsanto that the extent to which these research data are trade secrets is a matter of state law."
1984.84-497,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2899.978,2910.101,I thought at least the government takes the position that the rights that are being sued over here are purely creatures of Congress.
1984.84-497,1,34018,kenneth_ward_weinstein,,2910.101,2917.873,"It is correct to say that the right to compensation arises under FIFRA, under federal law."
1984.84-497,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2952.195,2954.813,"Mr. Weinstein, is there any precedent for saying that?"
1984.84-497,1,34018,kenneth_ward_weinstein,,2960.283,2960.666,Yes.
1984.84-497,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2960.666,2963.052,--and you say there is state law fixes the measure of compensation?
1984.84-497,1,34018,kenneth_ward_weinstein,,2963.052,2967.556,"I say that the adjudication resolves issues of state law, and the precedent--"
1984.84-497,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2967.556,2968.472,What issue of state law?
1984.84-497,1,34018,kenneth_ward_weinstein,,2968.472,2968.789,--My--
1984.84-497,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2968.789,2972.691,"The issue is how much to pay, and you say that is an issue of state law?"
1984.84-497,1,34018,kenneth_ward_weinstein,,2972.691,2977.662,"--Yes, because you are resolving how much to pay for the use of a trade secret."
1984.84-497,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3003.127,3009.864,"Did you argue that before the arbitrator, that the standard was fixed by state law?"
1984.84-497,1,34018,kenneth_ward_weinstein,,3009.864,3019.239,"We argued that the standard should be the same as we would receive in a state law proceeding, which was the value of the right to use the trade secret."
1984.84-497,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3019.239,3022.957,Can you cite me any state cases that have remotely discussed this issue?
1984.84-497,1,34018,kenneth_ward_weinstein,,3022.957,3023.707,State cases--
1984.84-497,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3023.707,3024.457,Yes.
1984.84-497,1,34018,kenneth_ward_weinstein,,3024.457,3025.826,--that have discussed the tissue of--
1984.84-497,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3025.826,3029.711,How much to pay when you use somebody else's trade secrets?
1984.84-497,1,34018,kenneth_ward_weinstein,,3039.084,3047.489,--I think state cases discuss the issue of the unauthorized use of a trade secret and what measure of compensation they should be entitled to.
1984.84-497,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3047.489,3050.624,"Where they get access to the material, where they get access to the trade secret."
1984.84-497,1,34018,kenneth_ward_weinstein,,3051.96,3053.776,Where they get the use... the use is what is important here.
1984.84-497,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3057.364,3058.48,--I understand what the Court said in Monsanto.
1984.84-497,1,34018,kenneth_ward_weinstein,,3068.169,3071.221,--Yes.
1984.84-497,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3360.691,3362.943,"Do you have anything further, Mr. Wallace?"
1984.84-497,2,35258,lawrence_gerald_wallace,,3362.943,3386.908,"If it please, Mr. Chief Justice, the difference that we see between Stauffer and Marathon with respect to the Pipeness issue is that Marathon wanted its contract claim decided by another tribunal, whereas Stauffer has resisted any effort to get a redetermination of what compensation it is entitled to."
1984.84-497,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3418.38,3421.416,"That always arises out of a contract, doesn't it?"
1984.84-497,2,35258,lawrence_gerald_wallace,,3421.416,3430.604,These are claims between persons where there is a claim of a breach of rights under a contract.
1984.84-497,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3430.604,3436.508,Is that any different from two private parties agreeing under the Federal Arbitration Act?
1984.84-497,2,35258,lawrence_gerald_wallace,,3436.508,3438.527,I am not speaking of arbitration.
1984.84-497,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3444.597,3445.547,That is subject to review.
1984.84-497,2,35258,lawrence_gerald_wallace,,3445.547,3446.881,That is subject to review.
1984.84-497,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3470.496,3474.298,And there is limited judicial review of NLRB decisions.
1984.84-497,2,35258,lawrence_gerald_wallace,,3474.298,3491.41,"That is correct, and of workmen's compensation decisions, and even more so of VA decisions and other kinds, but the point is that there is no need to describe the essence of the scheme that Congress created."
1984.84-497,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3491.41,3495.462,"Now, what would this surgery be precisely, if you will restate that?"
1984.84-497,2,35258,lawrence_gerald_wallace,,3495.462,3514.589,"It would just be to provide for as extensive judicial review as would be required, or just to drop the provision limiting the scope of judicial review, and have it the kind of judicial review that existed under the 1972 Act."
1984.84-497,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3514.589,3516.408,In what court would you do this?
1984.84-497,2,35258,lawrence_gerald_wallace,,3521.779,3533.503,"It would be... the District Court would review an arbitration award, just as it could entertain an action under 1331 to enforce an arbitration award."
1984.84-497,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3533.503,3537.805,"Over across the park they would think we were amending their statute, wouldn't they?"
1984.84-497,2,35258,lawrence_gerald_wallace,,3537.805,3554.166,"Well, it amends it a great deal more to do what the District Court did, which was to say exactly the opposite of what Congress intended, that competitors cannot market these unpatented products during the 15-year period for which Congress provided for a sharing of the costs."
1984.84-497,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3554.166,3555.516,Very well.
