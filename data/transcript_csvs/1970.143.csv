1970.143,0,37293,niki_z_schwartz,,31.223,35.518,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1970.143,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,186.831,190.391,Does the record show what happened to the girl?
1970.143,0,37293,niki_z_schwartz,,190.391,211.725,"The record shows that following the unsatisfactory response as far as the officer was concerned, he marched the defendant into the building at gun point called for assistance from the Police Department and a search was conducted of the entire premises and the girl was not found."
1970.143,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,250.195,258.255,Does the record show whether there have been any burglary incidents in the area in the immediate past.
1970.143,0,37293,niki_z_schwartz,,258.255,271.161,The record shows that there were no reports of any incident of any kind that there was -- not ever any report of any crime having been committed that night.
1970.143,1,21128,david_j_lombardo,,1641.161,1646.198,Mr. Chief Justice please and may it please the Court.
1970.143,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1667.534,1668.977,Of what?
1970.143,1,21128,david_j_lombardo,,1668.977,1671.602,Arrest under this ordinance.
1970.143,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1713.119,1716.565,How do you know that she wasn’t a visitor there?
1970.143,1,21128,david_j_lombardo,,1716.565,1719.858,She could have been because she wasn’t a resident there.
1970.143,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1719.858,1722.064,"Well, if in fact that she was apparent."
1970.143,1,21128,david_j_lombardo,,1722.064,1722.387,She was a visitor.
1970.143,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1722.387,1725.255,"And whether on a legal or illegal business, she did go into the apartment."
1970.143,1,21128,david_j_lombardo,,1725.255,1726.457,She was a visitor.
1970.143,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1729.853,1730.905,Why?
1970.143,1,21128,david_j_lombardo,,1730.905,1735.185,Because there were no colored residents in that apartment at that time.
1970.143,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1735.185,1736.419,And the policeman knows that?
1970.143,1,21128,david_j_lombardo,,1736.419,1741.692,"Yes sir, that’s what he so testified too."
1970.143,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1741.692,1743.878,How many residents were there?
1970.143,1,21128,david_j_lombardo,,1743.878,1751.93,I think there’s approximately 1500.
1970.143,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1751.93,1759.069,"I’m just wondering, did they have blood test and all of this."
1970.143,1,21128,david_j_lombardo,,1759.069,1759.407,No way.
1970.143,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1781.607,1783.791,(Inaudible)
1970.143,1,21128,david_j_lombardo,,1783.791,1784.667,That’s right.
1970.143,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1804.402,1809.572,(Inaudible)
1970.143,1,21128,david_j_lombardo,,1809.572,1821.79,"No, all I’m saying is that when a police man sees someone at night, when anyone does for a short period of time, race is sometime no matter what the race, the most obvious thing about the person."
1970.143,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1941.408,1945.571,Was this man a uniform patrol man at this time?
1970.143,1,21128,david_j_lombardo,,1945.571,1947.482,"Yes, he was in uniform Your Honor."
1970.143,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1948.371,1949.67,I thought he was on private duty?
1970.143,1,21128,david_j_lombardo,,1949.67,1952.738,"He was on private duty, but he was in uniform."
1970.143,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1952.738,1956.711,He is not clothed with municipal authority at the time.
1970.143,1,21128,david_j_lombardo,,1956.711,1963.392,"No, but I believe that the police officer is a police officer 24 hours a day as to those crimes involved in the breech of the peace."
1970.143,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1963.392,1968.423,Is that true -- are you suggesting that is a proposition of law under the Ohio Statutes.
1970.143,1,21128,david_j_lombardo,,1968.423,1969.991,Yes Your Honor.
1970.143,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1969.991,1972.613,Is he on private duty for that apartment house?
1970.143,1,21128,david_j_lombardo,,1972.613,1973.989,"Yes, sir."
1970.143,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1973.989,1975.676,(Inaudible).
1970.143,1,21128,david_j_lombardo,,1975.676,1983.858,At that time it was.
1970.143,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2083.181,2088.925,"Yeah, but in Terry they found a gun in his pocket and they prosecuted it not under that ordinance."
1970.143,1,21128,david_j_lombardo,,2088.925,2089.665,"No, I understand that."
1970.143,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2089.665,2091.574,But the possession of the gun.
1970.143,1,21128,david_j_lombardo,,2091.574,2092.021,Yes Your Honor.
1970.143,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2092.021,2093.103,It's little different here.
1970.143,1,21128,david_j_lombardo,,2093.103,2094.348,Oh I agree with you.
1970.143,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2094.348,2100.408,Thank you.
1970.143,1,21128,david_j_lombardo,,2100.408,2107.043,"So, he then goes forward and asks the suspect, “What are you going here?”"
1970.143,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2223.238,2232.899,"Since you indicated that you’re going to brief, I can tell you now, but if you can finish by three minutes to three, we’ll finish the case tonight, otherwise we’ll go over."
1970.143,1,21128,david_j_lombardo,,2232.899,2233.46,30 seconds.
1970.143,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2233.46,2239.381,Your friend has three minutes left.
1970.143,1,21128,david_j_lombardo,,2239.381,2247.22,"Let me just say this, in Terry and sibr you started -- this Court started to give the streets back to the people."
1970.143,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2251.448,2257.203,"Mr. Schwartz, you have three minutes left."
1970.143,2,37293,niki_z_schwartz,,2257.203,2270.703,"There’s also a lot of argument, debate took place before Terry about whether or not the limited intrusion of a stop and a frisk could be justified on less than probable cause."
1970.143,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2355.157,2360.578,Does the record show where Mr. Palmer lived?
1970.143,2,37293,niki_z_schwartz,,2360.578,2369.049,"The record I believe, the affidavit shows his address on Clayton Road, Cleveland Ohio."
1970.143,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2369.049,2375.523,Does the record show what his occupation was?
1970.143,2,37293,niki_z_schwartz,,2375.523,2376.982,I don’t believe it does.
1970.143,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2376.982,2381.666,"He gave the police the office three different addresses, did he not?"
1970.143,2,37293,niki_z_schwartz,,2381.666,2392.868,"Yes, he gave the officer three -- well the police officer testified that he gave him three different addresses when he was being interrogated at the police station which of course was after the arrest had taken place."
1970.143,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2407.053,2410.519,Did he ever state who owned the car?
1970.143,2,37293,niki_z_schwartz,,2410.519,2413.861,"No, he did not state who owned the car."
1970.143,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2422.389,2424.004,Was it -- did he have a license on it.
1970.143,2,37293,niki_z_schwartz,,2424.004,2425.24,Yes.
1970.143,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2425.24,2427.523,And so whose license it was?
1970.143,2,37293,niki_z_schwartz,,2427.523,2429.415,That’s not in the record.
1970.143,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2432.62,2433.674,That is not what?
1970.143,2,37293,niki_z_schwartz,,2433.674,2435.992,That it was not stolen car is the only fact in the record.
1970.143,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2438.875,2451.287,"Was there any evidence in the record linking this car, radio, telephone up with any legitimate business enterprise?"
1970.143,2,37293,niki_z_schwartz,,2451.287,2460.152,No there was not which bring us to -- seems to me the question asked by Mr. Justice White earlier as to whether or not visible or lawful goes together.
1970.143,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2475.246,2478.243,Does the record show whether he was white appellant?
1970.143,2,37293,niki_z_schwartz,,2478.243,2479.226,Mr. Palmer?
1970.143,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2522.918,2524.704,Who made that out?
1970.143,2,37293,niki_z_schwartz,,2524.704,2529.058,Officer Sepanic(ph)
1970.143,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2529.058,2531.706,And was this the arresting officer?
1970.143,2,37293,niki_z_schwartz,,2531.706,2532.754,Yes.
1970.143,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2532.754,2539.322,And was he -- he was officer on the police force of Euclid.
1970.143,2,37293,niki_z_schwartz,,2539.322,2539.713,Yes.
1970.143,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2539.713,2546.563,"At Euclid, but he also apparently in another job and that was an employee of this apartment house."
1970.143,2,37293,niki_z_schwartz,,2546.563,2546.741,Right.
1970.143,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2546.741,2547.436,Right?
1970.143,2,37293,niki_z_schwartz,,2547.436,2547.913,Right.
1970.143,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2547.913,2553.186,In which job was he performing in either the rest?
1970.143,2,37293,niki_z_schwartz,,2553.186,2556.507,"Well, I think it was performing in both of them."
1970.143,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2571.356,2574.546,So it was the first degree murder case if he was the police officer.
1970.143,2,37293,niki_z_schwartz,,2574.546,2574.888,That’s right.
1970.143,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2574.888,2575.677,That was carrying out his duty.
1970.143,2,37293,niki_z_schwartz,,2575.677,2577.749,That’s right and the court charged that he was.
1970.143,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2577.749,2579.125,No I’m sorry.
1970.143,2,37293,niki_z_schwartz,,2583.411,2584.008,That’s right.
1970.143,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2584.008,2597.244,"As the police officer as the police officer 24 hours a day, but I wonder if the record shows what his hours were as an employee of the Police Department of Euclid and what his hours were as an employee of this apartment house."
1970.143,2,37293,niki_z_schwartz,,2601.013,2601.948,This is not just an apartment.
1970.143,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2607.775,2612.802,Yes and which was he that night?
1970.143,2,37293,niki_z_schwartz,,2615.828,2616.348,Well --
1970.143,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2616.348,2618.097,That’s what the record shows.
1970.143,2,37293,niki_z_schwartz,,2618.097,2627.798,"I doubt that he was being paid by the City of Euclid for those precise hours, but he was wearing his uniform --"
1970.143,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2627.798,2630.633,He was moonlighting on another security job.
1970.143,2,37293,niki_z_schwartz,,2630.633,2633.967,But he’s wearing a City of Euclid police uniform.
1970.143,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2644.646,2647.794,"Well the testimony, I don’t have it right here but I -- rather struck me."
1970.143,2,37293,niki_z_schwartz,,2659.694,2663.421,I don’t recall.
1970.143,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2663.421,2664.023,Thank you gentlemen.
