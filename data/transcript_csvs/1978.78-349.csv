1978.78-349,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,11.596,"We'll hear arguments first this morning in Number 349, United States against Helstoski and the consolidated case."
1978.78-349,0,36744,morton_stavis,,20.127,24.014,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1978.78-349,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,147.507,154.657,"Of course it wouldn't make any difference for your theory if he had, would it?"
1978.78-349,0,36744,morton_stavis,,154.657,156.7,If he was a target?
1978.78-349,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,156.7,157.837,If he was aware that he was a --
1978.78-349,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,157.837,159.052,I knew he was.
1978.78-349,0,36744,morton_stavis,,159.052,161.71,"It -- to our fundamental theory, it doesn't."
1978.78-349,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,161.71,163.877,Might have something to do with the waiver.
1978.78-349,0,36744,morton_stavis,,163.877,174.114,"I don't think it has anything to do with waiver either, but I agree that if our theory is correct that this is a jurisdictional allocation then it wouldn't make any difference at all."
1978.78-349,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,174.114,178.657,"Who was the other person under inquiry, another member of Congress?"
1978.78-349,0,36744,morton_stavis,,178.657,191.37,"No, no somebody who had been employed by the Congressmen some eight years previously, was not then employed and hadn't been employed for many, many years."
1978.78-349,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,226.049,233.221,"Mr. Stavis, are you going to get it all to the appealability of Judge Meanor's order by the Government?"
1978.78-349,0,36744,morton_stavis,,242.811,249.676,"Well, I -- we -- in the Third Circuit, we certainly didn't believe that it was an appealable order."
1978.78-349,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,270.153,277.602,"Well, we have jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals opinion -- judgment only if it was properly in the Court of Appeals."
1978.78-349,0,36744,morton_stavis,,277.602,281.336,I don't think this matter is properly in the Court of Appeals.
1978.78-349,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,359.821,374.706,"Well that I get -- that's a case in controversy argument, but did I understand Mr. Stavis, you're suggesting that even though you did not cross-petition on the question of the appealability of the order to the Third Circuit that it's jurisdictional and therefore that we can reach and decide it?"
1978.78-349,0,36744,morton_stavis,,374.706,377.837,I accepted the suggestion of Mr. Justice Rehnquist in that respect.
1978.78-349,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,377.837,383.092,"I just want to be clear, that's -- now the arguments you're now making is really a case of controversy, are you (Voice Overlap)?"
1978.78-349,0,36744,morton_stavis,,383.092,383.681,That's correct.
1978.78-349,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,383.681,384.785,And that's a separate argument is it?
1978.78-349,0,36744,morton_stavis,,384.785,385.357,That's correct Your Honor.
1978.78-349,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,385.357,388.557,All right.
1978.78-349,0,36744,morton_stavis,,388.557,405.489,May I get back to the issues in 546 which is the jurisdiction of this Court to try -- of the District Court of an Article III Court to try this indictment.
1978.78-349,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,421.555,423.086,For the Court?
1978.78-349,0,36744,morton_stavis,,423.086,424.02,I'm sorry.
1978.78-349,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,424.02,424.946,Opinion for the Court?
1978.78-349,0,36744,morton_stavis,,424.946,427.813,"Of course, the opinion for the Court."
1978.78-349,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,503.347,505.868,Can they try these charges now?
1978.78-349,0,36744,morton_stavis,,505.868,507.128,I believe so.
1978.78-349,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,507.128,510.819,And what sanction could Congress impose?
1978.78-349,0,36744,morton_stavis,,510.819,521.799,"By way of Kilbourn against Thompson that Congress has complete power to impose any sanctions it chooses including -- if I read Kilbourn against Thompson correctly, imprisonment."
1978.78-349,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,524.03,528.925,"I suppose under the constitution that wouldn't be authorized to impose a cruel or unusual punishment, would it not?"
1978.78-349,0,36744,morton_stavis,,528.925,533.065,"Oh, I think there are constitutional limitations upon the exercise of its power."
1978.78-349,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,552.865,554.884,You going to insist on a jury trial?
1978.78-349,0,36744,morton_stavis,,554.884,556.091,No.
1978.78-349,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,556.848,559.83,"Although the constitution guarantees that, isn't it?"
1978.78-349,0,36744,morton_stavis,,559.83,562.444,"Guarantees it, an Article III trial."
1978.78-349,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,563.466,565.675,"I didn't say anything about an Article III trial, does it?"
1978.78-349,0,36744,morton_stavis,,565.675,570.851,"Well, I would guess however that we would accept the fact that would not be a jury trial."
1978.78-349,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,580.313,582.999,Subject to what constitutional limitations?
1978.78-349,0,36744,morton_stavis,,582.999,585.026,Subject to due process limitations.
1978.78-349,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,585.026,586.636,But not a jury trial?
1978.78-349,0,36744,morton_stavis,,586.636,589.775,"That's correct, subject to cruel and unusual punishment limitation."
1978.78-349,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,589.775,591.029,Presumption of innocence?
1978.78-349,0,36744,morton_stavis,,591.029,592.08,Presumption of innocence.
1978.78-349,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,592.08,594.496,Necessity of proof beyond a reasonable doubt?
1978.78-349,0,36744,morton_stavis,,594.496,599.955,"I believe so, right of confrontation, right of cross-examination, right of counsel or --"
1978.78-349,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,599.955,604.491,"Mr. Stavis, is it clear that their clause applies to a former congressman?"
1978.78-349,0,36744,morton_stavis,,604.491,617.945,"Congress in the past has so asserted, we do not dispute that and besides as of the time that this indictment was found as to Helstoski was a member of Congress."
1978.78-349,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,617.945,623.378,"Yes but he's not now, any punishment by a Congressman -- by Congress would be from now on."
1978.78-349,0,36744,morton_stavis,,623.378,628.254,That is correct and we do not dispute the jurisdiction of Congress but the point that I'm making is --
1978.78-349,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,628.254,630.22,"Well, you do it here because you don't have to."
1978.78-349,0,36744,morton_stavis,,630.22,635.769,"That is correct, and all -- all we have to dispute here is the jurisdiction of the Article III Court."
1978.78-349,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,635.769,638.086,And Courts don't have any jurisdiction.
1978.78-349,0,36744,morton_stavis,,638.086,644.256,"And at the time this indictment was found, Congress clearly had jurisdiction."
1978.78-349,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,644.256,649.739,What would it -- does it -- is there a statute of limitations on this?
1978.78-349,0,36744,morton_stavis,,649.739,652.233,I don't know that there is any.
1978.78-349,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,652.233,662.502,"Well Mr. Stavis, what took -- you said Congress has asserted authority to try after his defeat which I gather is what happened to this congressman."
1978.78-349,0,36744,morton_stavis,,662.502,663.068,That's correct.
1978.78-349,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,663.179,664.175,Has that ever happened?
1978.78-349,0,36744,morton_stavis,,664.175,665.282,Yes it has.
1978.78-349,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,665.282,666.225,Against whom?
1978.78-349,0,36744,morton_stavis,,666.225,669.559,"Well, Mr. Brand speaking for the speaker --"
1978.78-349,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,669.559,669.754,"Oh, I see --"
1978.78-349,0,36744,morton_stavis,,669.754,672.977,"-- will address that particular question.Historically, it has occurred."
1978.78-349,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,695.447,708.7,"Mr. Stavis, would the net result of accepting your theory mean that Congress could not enact and the President sign a law making it a criminal offense for a Congressman to take a bribe?"
1978.78-349,0,36744,morton_stavis,,708.7,722.715,"Congress has enacted such a law, and such a law is on -- to that books and has been enforced and is valid, but not in respect to the performance of legislative acts."
1978.78-349,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,774.352,796.432,"But when -- Mr. Stavis, when the charge is for taking money in exchange for a promise of a future act, hasn't the Court held that it's not necessary to show the legislative act or the legislative activity?"
1978.78-349,0,36744,morton_stavis,,796.432,798.944,And of course that's your opinion in the Brewster case.
1978.78-349,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,824.697,829.217,"Well, how will we know whether the Government is going to try to prove that until the case is tried?"
1978.78-349,0,36744,morton_stavis,,829.217,842.165,"Well, that's what we thought accepting that the Government and that's why we don't think you would even consider this case but the Government says, “Please look at our profers of proof, this is really what we want to prove.”"
1978.78-349,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,859.104,862.346,I understand you say you didn't want us to hear this case?
1978.78-349,0,36744,morton_stavis,,862.346,864.899,We want you to hear the Government's petition.
1978.78-349,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,864.899,866.775,"Oh, I see."
1978.78-349,0,36744,morton_stavis,,866.775,868.601,We want you to hear the Government's petition as --
1978.78-349,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,868.601,869.693,"I see, I see."
1978.78-349,0,36744,morton_stavis,,869.693,871.422,"Sure, I want you to hear my petition."
1978.78-349,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,871.422,872.297,I see.
1978.78-349,0,36744,morton_stavis,,872.297,873.79,Because my petition --
1978.78-349,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,873.79,879.906,I just marvel at your fairness.
1978.78-349,0,36744,morton_stavis,,879.906,883.113,"Well, I don't think it's not -- I think its not any fair but correct."
1978.78-349,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,941.814,946.255,What if the trial court excludes any evidence about the legislative acts?
1978.78-349,0,36744,morton_stavis,,946.255,953.586,Well that's what Mr.-- that's what Judge Meanor said he was going to do and that's why the Government took this case up.
1978.78-349,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1022.071,1032.392,"Mr. Stavis, do you agree that if they strike the allegations of the specific overt acts describing legislative acts that the indictment would then be comparable to the indictment in the Brewster case?"
1978.78-349,0,36744,morton_stavis,,1032.392,1043.833,"Before, the morals in this specific legislative act, it's also the allegations in counts 2 (a) and 4 of the indictment which also include allegations of specific legislative acts."
1978.78-349,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1086.241,1099.369,"But Mr. Stavis, would you say then that if before the defendant is put in jeopardy, the def -- the Government can come in and voluntarily dismiss the indictment, that permission to dismiss the indictment then reindict it leaving out all the references to legislative acts?"
1978.78-349,0,36744,morton_stavis,,1099.369,1100.698,No problem about that.
1978.78-349,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1100.698,1100.785,"Well, if they still --"
1978.78-349,0,36744,morton_stavis,,1100.785,1101.317,The (Voice Overlap) --
1978.78-349,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1101.317,1102.644,-- would've done what you just said.
1978.78-349,0,36744,morton_stavis,,1102.644,1111.899,"No, provided that now this is the difference, provided that it had not presented the legislative acts to the grand jury."
1978.78-349,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1111.899,1116.922,So that having presented the legislative acts to the grand jury that he have given him permanent immunity?
1978.78-349,0,36744,morton_stavis,,1116.922,1118.053,"No, they haven't."
1978.78-349,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1130.167,1142.537,"Well your position then just so I get is that having told a particular grand jury about a legislative act by a Congressman, that grand jury may never return an indictment against that Congressman?"
1978.78-349,0,36744,morton_stavis,,1142.537,1146.662,Indictment which charges legislative acts.
1978.78-349,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1146.662,1146.91,"Well, --"
1978.78-349,0,36744,morton_stavis,,1146.91,1146.982,I mean -- of course they (Voice Overlap) --
1978.78-349,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1146.982,1152.131,"I thought you said that in a moment ago if they dismissed the indictment and brought a new one would -- didn't make reference, its still be bad?"
1978.78-349,0,36744,morton_stavis,,1152.131,1152.812,Oh no!
1978.78-349,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1161.499,1170.229,"No, they just excised from the new indictment any reference to the legislative acts and they merely follow the pattern of the Brewster indictment."
1978.78-349,0,36744,morton_stavis,,1170.229,1188.134,"That would be invalid because the grand jury, the grand jury has violated the Speech or Debate Clause but this is not to say that the Government cannot convene another grand jury, present the case which does not involve proof of legislative acts and come out with the Brewster type indictment."
1978.78-349,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1188.134,1190.611,Well but that's like Calandra.
1978.78-349,0,36744,morton_stavis,,1216.978,1219.269,It is not like Calandra.
1978.78-349,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1236.22,1245.496,And we also said in Calandra that the right of privacy protected by the Fourth Amendment had already been breached and there was nothing that --
1978.78-349,0,36744,morton_stavis,,1245.496,1246.688,I understand that.
1978.78-349,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1265.095,1269.413,Did it say he may not be questioned or he may not be required to answer?
1978.78-349,0,36744,morton_stavis,,1269.413,1271.402,Says he may not be questioned.
1978.78-349,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1271.402,1271.942,"And, he may not --"
1978.78-349,0,36744,morton_stavis,,1271.942,1274.074,I think it says may not be questioned.
1978.78-349,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1274.074,1274.774,No.
1978.78-349,0,36744,morton_stavis,,1279.744,1283.977,I think he did at the point when he wasn't the target.
1978.78-349,1,41699,stanley_mbrand,,1650.006,1653.053,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1978.78-349,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1784.66,1788.791,That is even if he had voluntarily submitted all this material --
1978.78-349,1,41699,stanley_mbrand,,1788.791,1788.981,That's right.
1978.78-349,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1788.981,1790.266,-- regarding his legislative act.
1978.78-349,1,41699,stanley_mbrand,,1790.266,1791.449,That's our position.
1978.78-349,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1791.449,1792.462,And even that --
1978.78-349,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1792.462,1798.44,"Even if he admit an unequivocal explicit waiver, knowing waiver voluntarily?"
1978.78-349,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1798.44,1800.255,"Yes, any more than two --"
1978.78-349,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1800.255,1801.501,He was just --
1978.78-349,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1801.501,1802.207,-- any more than two litigants --
1978.78-349,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1802.207,1803.594,-- not empowered to waive.
1978.78-349,1,41699,stanley_mbrand,,1803.594,1807.206,-- any more than two litigants could present themselves to an Article III Court --
1978.78-349,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1807.206,1807.329,And (Voice Overlap) --
1978.78-349,1,41699,stanley_mbrand,,1807.329,1812.222,"-- without a case of controversy and say, “We would like the Court nevertheless to try this case.”"
1978.78-349,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1812.222,1818.045,"In other words, the Speech or Debate Clause doesn't belong to an individual, it belongs to an institution, is that your point?"
1978.78-349,1,41699,stanley_mbrand,,1818.045,1819.185,Yes.
1978.78-349,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1819.185,1819.678,Well couldn't --
1978.78-349,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1819.678,1826.462,"Well if it does, why can't that institution provide for its waiver?"
1978.78-349,1,41699,stanley_mbrand,,1826.462,1830.905,Because the clause is a protection for the member as well even as against --
1978.78-349,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1830.905,1831.271,So it's both?
1978.78-349,1,41699,stanley_mbrand,,1831.271,1831.995,-- a hostile Congress.
1978.78-349,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1831.995,1832.946,So it's both?
1978.78-349,1,41699,stanley_mbrand,,1832.946,1833.802,That's correct.
1978.78-349,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1833.802,1834.413,Neither one can waiver --
1978.78-349,1,41699,stanley_mbrand,,1834.413,1837.412,It protects unpopular members as well as popular members --
1978.78-349,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1837.412,1838.081,So that --
1978.78-349,1,41699,stanley_mbrand,,1838.081,1839.63,-- Democrats as well as Republicans.
1978.78-349,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1839.63,1843.323,So Congress cannot by however narrow a piece of legislation --
1978.78-349,1,41699,stanley_mbrand,,1843.323,1845.192,That's right.
1978.78-349,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1845.192,1846.691,-- provide for the --
1978.78-349,1,41699,stanley_mbrand,,1846.691,1847.025,Any --
1978.78-349,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1847.025,1848.911,-- for the executive prosecution of a legislative act.
1978.78-349,1,41699,stanley_mbrand,,1848.911,1853.395,"That's right, any more than we could delegate impeachment for instance."
1978.78-349,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1853.395,1862.342,"Mr. Brand, Congress I assume could amend the 201 and the other bribery statute and say, “They do not apply to Congressmen.”"
1978.78-349,1,41699,stanley_mbrand,,1862.342,1863.658,They could do that.
1978.78-349,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1864.251,1866.346,"Well, aren't you now doing that?"
1978.78-349,1,41699,stanley_mbrand,,1866.346,1867.762,"No sir, we don't believe we are."
1978.78-349,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1867.762,1870.876,"Well, aren't you trying to get us to do that?"
1978.78-349,1,41699,stanley_mbrand,,1870.876,1871.676,I don't think so.
1978.78-349,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1882.309,1885.118,Do you challenge the indictments Mr. Brand or just the evidentiary problem?
1978.78-349,1,41699,stanley_mbrand,,1885.118,1887.455,We do.
1978.78-349,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1887.455,1889.426,You agree with Mr. Stavis --
1978.78-349,1,41699,stanley_mbrand,,1889.426,1890.636,We do in this case.
1978.78-349,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1890.636,1891.155,Yes.
1978.78-349,1,41699,stanley_mbrand,,1891.155,1904.078,Although we agree also that there is nothing to prevent the U.S. attorney from taking the non-legislative material presenting it to a new grand jury and indicting and going forward to trial.
1978.78-349,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1904.078,1906.315,Except maybe the statute of limitations.
1978.78-349,1,41699,stanley_mbrand,,1906.315,1909.684,If that in fact is a problem.
1978.78-349,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1909.684,1923.402,"But you would -- in that new indictment or in those new grand jury proceedings or in the subsequent trial, the evidence the Government now proposes to use you would say would be unusable?"
1978.78-349,1,41699,stanley_mbrand,,1923.402,1927.526,Correct.
1978.78-349,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1927.526,1937.718,Hasn't Congress or didn't Congress take quite a long step in relation to the Speech or Debate Clause when they enacted these provisions?
1978.78-349,1,41699,stanley_mbrand,,1937.718,1949.359,"I don't think so Your Honor, 201 like a plethora of other statutes regulating non-legislative behavior has been passed by Congress in that context."
1978.78-349,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2043.607,2047.008,"Well, to prevent question anywhere in any other place?"
1978.78-349,1,41699,stanley_mbrand,,2047.008,2047.697,Correct.
1978.78-349,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2047.697,2060.466,But why wouldn't your interest be served by according to Congressman a right to assert before the grand jury the privilege that you're talking about now?
1978.78-349,1,41699,stanley_mbrand,,2060.466,2063.341,Our position would not -- denying that.
1978.78-349,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2063.579,2063.614,But --
1978.78-349,1,41699,stanley_mbrand,,2063.614,2065.054,-- grand jury which indicted him --
1978.78-349,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2065.054,2072.272,"Why wouldn't it be fully served and if he chooses not to assert it, then there is some form of waiver."
1978.78-349,1,41699,stanley_mbrand,,2072.272,2093.146,"Well, if it's never asserted it never becomes an issue, but in this case the grand jury which ultimately indicted him was one which there could be no waiver because he never appeared before that grand jury."
1978.78-349,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2121.23,2126.615,But what was the questioning before the grand jury which violated the Speech and Debate Clause?
1978.78-349,1,41699,stanley_mbrand,,2126.615,2128.499,The legislative acts.
1978.78-349,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2129.782,2132.532,To whom were the questions addressed?
1978.78-349,1,41699,stanley_mbrand,,2132.532,2136.104,I believe they were directed to the defendant.
1978.78-349,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2136.104,2147.648,"Well, but why couldn't he then assert the speech and debate privilege and fully vindicate it by asserting it at that point, and not having done so, he has waived it."
1978.78-349,1,41699,stanley_mbrand,,2147.648,2155.842,"Well, under Mr. Stavis' formulation and I think we would agree with most of that."
1978.78-349,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2161.141,2177.705,"But as soon as it reached him, is it not implied in both Johnson and the Brewster case that he not only need not answer, he may assert the proposition that he cannot be questioned."
1978.78-349,1,41699,stanley_mbrand,,2211.642,2212.46,Well as I --
1978.78-349,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2212.46,2223.949,"So that he -- it is more than a quite matter of not being questioned or not answering, he can't even be questioned, isn't that so?"
1978.78-349,1,41699,stanley_mbrand,,2223.949,2224.961,That's correct.
1978.78-349,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2224.961,2228.742,"Well, but he then submitted to the questioning here."
1978.78-349,1,41699,stanley_mbrand,,2228.742,2239.158,"Well, wouldn't he be -- would the same situation occur where he never appeared and the U.S. attorney went to the Library of Congress and took the legislative material out off there, is that a questioning?"
1978.78-349,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2243.778,2244.895,"Well, indeed you look --"
1978.78-349,1,41699,stanley_mbrand,,2244.895,2247.2,That the grand jury can't hear --
1978.78-349,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2247.2,2254.552,"I thought you would assert that even if he appeared and answered freely, nevertheless."
1978.78-349,1,41699,stanley_mbrand,,2254.552,2262.895,"That's correct, he as a claimant in a Article III Court could come in and claim that he should get a remedy from the Court."
1978.78-349,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2262.895,2285.616,"Well Mr. Brand, he certainly don't need to -- I know you say that he -- the evidence should never have even been presented to the grand jury, but even if there was -- even if it was properly presented or even if it could be said that he waived in some matter the presentation of the evidence, you still say that he never consented to be indicted."
1978.78-349,1,41699,stanley_mbrand,,2298.384,2308.627,"Well again, I believe that the heart of the clause is protection of the Congress from coordinate branches."
1978.78-349,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2308.627,2319.973,And I gather -- I thought your position was so far does that principle go that nothing that he does before the grand jury can support an indictment.
1978.78-349,1,41699,stanley_mbrand,,2319.973,2320.266,Correct.
1978.78-349,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2320.266,2321.665,"Nothing, isn't that true?"
1978.78-349,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2321.665,2322.181,"Well Mr. Brand, he --"
1978.78-349,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2322.181,2323.038,But can he support a waiver?
1978.78-349,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2323.038,2325.927,"-- he didn't testify before this grand jury, did he?"
1978.78-349,1,41699,stanley_mbrand,,2325.927,2327.906,The one that he was indicted by?
1978.78-349,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2327.906,2328.692,Yes.
1978.78-349,1,41699,stanley_mbrand,,2328.692,2328.698,"No, he did not."
1978.78-349,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2328.698,2330.267,He didn't testify before that grand jury.
1978.78-349,1,41699,stanley_mbrand,,2330.267,2331.008,He did not.
1978.78-349,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2331.008,2338.057,So your position has to be that evidence of legislative acts is inadmissible before the grand jury even though the man itself is --
1978.78-349,1,41699,stanley_mbrand,,2338.057,2339.251,Yes.
1978.78-349,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2339.251,2340.581,But the clause doesn't read that way.
1978.78-349,1,41699,stanley_mbrand,,2348.812,2349.049,Of course the --
1978.78-349,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2349.049,2354.544,That if he -- mentioned even acknowledged with third party crime evidence of legislative act shall be --
1978.78-349,1,41699,stanley_mbrand,,2354.544,2361.227,"Well of course the Court -- the clause doesn't say either that, it is merely that evidence shall not be presented."
1978.78-349,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2367.788,2370.44,"Well, he wasn't questioned in the grand jury, was he?"
1978.78-349,1,41699,stanley_mbrand,,2370.44,2371.419,That at time and the grand jury he was not.
1978.78-349,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2371.419,2381.151,"But at the time and grand jury is conducting its investigation, it presumably doesn't have its mind made up what its going to do at the end of the inquiry."
1978.78-349,1,41699,stanley_mbrand,,2392.826,2406.417,But in this case there was the -- a mechanism for calling out the legislative acts by presenting -- the U.S. attorney by presenting them to the -- by not presenting them to the indicting grand jury.
1978.78-349,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2411.171,2413.407,May I ask you one other question?
1978.78-349,1,41699,stanley_mbrand,,2418.007,2419.036,Yes.
1978.78-349,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2419.036,2421.058,And what is your authority for that?
1978.78-349,1,41699,stanley_mbrand,,2421.058,2438.173,"Well, our authority would be the residual -- the inherent power of the body is punished, contempts committed by its members at the time they were members for conduct which occurred when they were members."
1978.78-349,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2438.173,2446.112,Has the Congress -- is it not true that your brief recites an example of three members or it did not have former members of whom did not have jurisdiction.
1978.78-349,1,41699,stanley_mbrand,,2446.112,2455.616,"Well, that report raised doubts as to whether there was jurisdiction and those cases against those former members were dropped for other reasons."
1978.78-349,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2455.616,2464.483,"The military once asserted jurisdiction to punish its foreign members too, but it got a negative answer from this Court, didn't it?"
1978.78-349,1,41699,stanley_mbrand,,2464.483,2466.426,I believe it did.
1978.78-349,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2476.759,2477.524,When they were members.
1978.78-349,1,41699,stanley_mbrand,,2477.524,2478.031,-- when they were members.
1978.78-349,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2478.031,2480.671,And that was the military's theory too.
1978.78-349,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2480.671,2490.48,"Mr. Stavis indicated that you were going to tell us about the number of Congressmen, former Congressmen punished by the House or the Senate."
1978.78-349,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2490.48,2496.314,Yes.
1978.78-349,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2521.513,2525.321,By a man who is no longer a member?
1978.78-349,1,41699,stanley_mbrand,,2525.321,2528.49,"No, in that case he was a member of the 42nd Congress, although --"
1978.78-349,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2528.49,2538.072,So did you say that -- has Congress doubted its power to punish conduct occurring in a former Congress by a man who is no longer a member?
1978.78-349,1,41699,stanley_mbrand,,2538.072,2547.92,I'm not sure if there's ever expressed any view on that.Our view of the self disciplinary process as it is evolving at this stage would be that we would have the power to --
1978.78-349,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2547.92,2556.548,Well Mr. Brand is there any instance of a former Congressman tried by the Congress or the House or Senate for a conduct (Voice Overlap) --
1978.78-349,1,41699,stanley_mbrand,,2556.548,2558.82,There is none that I can get to.
1978.78-349,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2558.82,2563.799,There are some?
1978.78-349,1,41699,stanley_mbrand,,2563.799,2566.588,See that -- I can cite to none.
1978.78-349,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2566.588,2573.946,"Well, what about -- I thought Mr. Stavis indicated there was an instance, is that right or not?"
1978.78-349,1,41699,stanley_mbrand,,2573.946,2576.397,Well he talked about the Crédit Mobilierscandal.
1978.78-349,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2576.397,2577.214,"Well, what about that?"
1978.78-349,1,41699,stanley_mbrand,,2577.214,2583.116,And that was disciplined in the 42nd Congress for what occurred in the 40th.
1978.78-349,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2583.116,2584.739,Of an incumbent Congressman.
1978.78-349,1,41699,stanley_mbrand,,2584.739,2586.724,Of an -- sitting member of Congress.
1978.78-349,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2586.724,2588.186,I see.
1978.78-349,1,41699,stanley_mbrand,,2588.186,2590.398,I see that my time is up.
1978.78-349,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2595.107,2596.409,You may.
1978.78-349,1,41699,stanley_mbrand,,2596.409,2600.661,-- that the self-disciplinary process is an evolving process.
1978.78-349,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2631.365,2639.721,"Does the record, Mr. Brand, tell us whether the Congress has given any consideration to whether any action should be taken against former congressman Helstoski?"
1978.78-349,1,41699,stanley_mbrand,,2639.721,2642.73,No sir.
1978.78-349,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2673.908,2677.35,Very well Mr. Brand.
1978.78-349,2,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,2680.606,2685.104,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1978.78-349,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2771.227,2785.962,"In your view Mr. Solicitor General, for the Government to sustain a case needn't prove anymore than that the money was taken and the promise to do a future act was made?"
1978.78-349,2,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,2785.962,2785.977,That's --
1978.78-349,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2785.977,2792.246,"Does -- in other words, does it need to prove that the bargain was fulfilled?"
1978.78-349,2,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,2792.246,2796.021,"That's precisely the Government's position, if the Court please."
1978.78-349,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2814.436,2823.294,Would the crime be consummated if the solicitation were shown but no payment were shown?
1978.78-349,2,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,2825.079,2838.109,"The act, if the Court please, it would be under 201 (c) the act is in fact completed when the solicitation is made for the purpose of being influenced."
1978.78-349,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2838.109,2847.601,"But Mr. Solicitor General, I gather -- Judge Meanor said you could not be -- use the evidence of bills, private bills actually being introduced, did he not?"
1978.78-349,2,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,2847.601,2848.662,That's exactly that --
1978.78-349,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2848.662,2850.504,"And you disagree, don't you?"
1978.78-349,2,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,2850.504,2856.595,I do not -- we do not disagree with Judge Meanor if a waiver took place.
1978.78-349,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2871.363,2875.042,Heard when and how?
1978.78-349,2,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,2875.042,2894.527,We submit that a valid waiver occurred when Mr. Helstoski voluntarily presented voluminous correspondents including copies of the very bills that he introduced after he was told that he needn't -- that he was not required to do that.
1978.78-349,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2938.572,2950.311,"Well, the -- but -- just so I had it clear, but absent the waiver you agree that under Brewster in irrelevant cases and under the clause, you could not introduce the evidence that you proposed to introduce?"
1978.78-349,2,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,2950.311,2950.778,We do.
1978.78-349,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3007.467,3009.053,I suppose it refers --
1978.78-349,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3009.053,3009.09,Pardon me?
1978.78-349,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3009.09,3017.237,"-- it corresponds -- suppose -- as I read some of this, some of these correspondents says, “I did this” or “I didn't do that” in connection with the given private bill."
1978.78-349,3,41699,stanley_mbrand,,3017.237,3017.289,"Well,"
1978.78-349,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3017.289,3019.46,Would that be within this category?
1978.78-349,4,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,3019.46,3024.785,"No, we believe that that is not barred from evidence because --"
1978.78-349,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3024.785,3027.368,Even though it refers to something he did or didn't do --
1978.78-349,4,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,3027.368,3028.01,Even though it refers --
1978.78-349,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3028.01,3028.551,-- that could be --
1978.78-349,4,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,3028.551,3030.146,-- to something he did or didn't do because --
1978.78-349,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3030.146,3034.168,Even though while he says he did or didn't do would've been a legislative act.
1978.78-349,4,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,3034.168,3036.96,"Exactly, but he may not have done it."
1978.78-349,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3046.722,3059.056,So you say that under -- that Brewster it would not require exclusion of a promise to introduce a bill in return for money?
1978.78-349,4,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,3059.056,3064.238,"As I read Brewster, Brewster would not require its exclusion because it relates --"
1978.78-349,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3064.238,3073.444,"Well what if -- Mr. Solicitor General, the exclusion, I introduced the private bill on your behalf on such and such a date?"
1978.78-349,4,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,3073.444,3085.947,"Well, I assume that as -- let us assume that that's a false statement that he did not in fact introduce a private bill, but he said this for the purpose of eliciting a payment."
1978.78-349,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3085.947,3088.044,And suppose he did though?
1978.78-349,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3088.044,3088.208,Suppose he didn't --
1978.78-349,4,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,3088.208,3090.023,"Well, --"
1978.78-349,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3090.023,3090.041,-- introduce the --
1978.78-349,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3090.041,3097.291,"If it were introduced for the purpose of showing that he did in fact introduce the bill, I would agree with the Court."
1978.78-349,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3097.291,3097.455,"Well, --"
1978.78-349,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3097.455,3097.898,Could that --
1978.78-349,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3097.898,3099.177,Will be excluded then but --
1978.78-349,5,36744,morton_stavis,,4148.913,4149.295,Yes I do.
1978.78-349,5,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4149.295,4150.866,You have about three minutes left.
1978.78-349,5,36744,morton_stavis,,4150.866,4153.778,"Alright, thank you very much."
1978.78-349,5,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4171.679,4171.859,"Well, I didn't -- it could --"
1978.78-349,5,36744,morton_stavis,,4171.859,4172.81,I cannot believe --
1978.78-349,5,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4172.81,4175.313,"If you understood it that way, I didn't."
1978.78-349,5,36744,morton_stavis,,4175.313,4178.304,I think that was what the Solicitor General --
1978.78-349,5,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4178.304,4182.488,He -- I thought he has said Congress has not done that up to now.
1978.78-349,5,36744,morton_stavis,,4182.488,4184.071,I thought he went further.
1978.78-349,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4184.071,4190.049,"I asked him that, whatever is -- that you have to -- that was my question anyway whether if --"
1978.78-349,5,36744,morton_stavis,,4190.049,4190.157,I thought --
1978.78-349,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4190.157,4191.863,-- his answer was that it's another matter.
1978.78-349,5,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4191.863,4195.242,Do we need to decide whether what Congress could do in the future?
1978.78-349,5,36744,morton_stavis,,4195.242,4196.033,I understand that.
