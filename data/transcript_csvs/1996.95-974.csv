1996.95-974,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,11.998,"We'll hear argument now in Number 95-974, Arizonans for Official English and Robert D. Park v. Arizona."
1996.95-974,0,18183,barnaby_w_zall,,33.232,34.093,"Yes, Your Honor."
1996.95-974,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,117.308,141.533,"Mr. Zall, this particular Government, at least the Attorney General, long before this case was decided by the district court said that the constitutional provision in Arizona did not prohibit the use of a language other than English where necessary to assure the fairness and effectiveness of the delivery or services to members of the public."
1996.95-974,0,18183,barnaby_w_zall,,159.276,165.58,"--Your Honor, we agree with the Attorney General's opinion as to its construction of Article XXVIII on the First Amendment grounds."
1996.95-974,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,179.879,187.353,Did the Attorney General withdraw that opinion as the official interpretation of the State's executive?
1996.95-974,0,18183,barnaby_w_zall,,187.353,188.114,"It did not, Your Honor."
1996.95-974,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,188.114,202.023,"So that's the law as far as the executive's... as far as official Government in Arizona is concerned, so my question is, why didn't this case end?"
1996.95-974,0,18183,barnaby_w_zall,,204.735,225.107,"Your Honor, I believe the plaintiffs in the case said that the next Attorney General could issue another opinion and the Attorney General's opinion was not binding on the courts, therefore they felt that they still had a viable case, and the district court disagreed with the Attorney General's interpretation and decided not to abide by it, as did the Ninth Circuit."
1996.95-974,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,225.107,231.992,"Well, is... it's not a question of what the district court independently might think the law was."
1996.95-974,0,18183,barnaby_w_zall,,243.861,246.833,"I think the answer to that question is she was at no risk of losing her job, Your Honor."
1996.95-974,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,246.833,252.887,"Well, didn't... what controversy was left, then, if she was at no risk of losing her job?"
1996.95-974,0,18183,barnaby_w_zall,,252.887,266.674,"I believe, Your Honor, that although that was... that's the correct interpretation, she did not agree with that and asked the court on a slightly different ground, which is that she was not... excuse me."
1996.95-974,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,282.636,286.079,What basis would there have been for that?
1996.95-974,0,18183,barnaby_w_zall,,292.674,294.885,"I think that's correct, Your Honor."
1996.95-974,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,294.885,296.915,"So the district court was wrong, wasn't it?"
1996.95-974,0,18183,barnaby_w_zall,,296.915,298.417,"I believe the district court was wrong, Your Honor."
1996.95-974,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,299.927,306.872,"So at that point the case was certainly moot, even if we make the assumption that there was a case or controversy at some point."
1996.95-974,0,18183,barnaby_w_zall,,319.569,328.796,"--Your Honor, the central point of mootness is whether this Court's decision can affect the legal rights of the parties before it."
1996.95-974,1,40160,robert_h_pohlman,,1488.228,1504.399,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1996.95-974,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1535.72,1551.009,"I certainly agree with that, but why didn't it suddenly become nonexistent as soon as the district court entered a judgment that didn't include nominal damages and the petitioner later, and before the appeal, resigned from her State employment?"
1996.95-974,1,40160,robert_h_pohlman,,1552.249,1566.348,"It wasn't moot for a number of reasons, Justice Scalia, one of which is that there was a final unappealed judgment in favor of the... Ms. Yniguez against Governor Mofford, so that judgment was binding and final long before she left State employment."
1996.95-974,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1566.348,1571.192,"Well, why was there a case or controversy in the district court, please?"
1996.95-974,1,40160,robert_h_pohlman,,1571.192,1584.891,"In the district court there was a case or controversy initially because, as a factual matter, the district court found that Ms. Yniguez had suffered an injury in fact in that she... her First Amendment rights had been chilled."
1996.95-974,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1584.891,1590.995,"Well, the Government... the Governor agreed that the proposition was invalid."
1996.95-974,1,40160,robert_h_pohlman,,1590.995,1595.586,"The Governor agreed after the judgment, Your Honor, Justice O'Connor, that it was invalid."
1996.95-974,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1595.586,1599.24,"Well, there was never... there was never an answer on the merits, was there?"
1996.95-974,1,40160,robert_h_pohlman,,1602.762,1607.355,"There... I don't recall, Justice O'Connor, whether there was an answer."
1996.95-974,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1607.355,1607.746,Isn't that right?
1996.95-974,1,40160,robert_h_pohlman,,1607.796,1609.268,I don't recall if there was or not.
1996.95-974,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1615.502,1627.371,But at any point in the litigation did either the Governor or the Attorney General indicate that your client would be disciplined for using Spanish?
1996.95-974,1,40160,robert_h_pohlman,,1627.371,1631.741,"There was... Justice Kennedy, there was no specific indication."
1996.95-974,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1653.187,1655.848,What was the basis for that finding?
1996.95-974,1,40160,robert_h_pohlman,,1655.848,1664.514,"It was Governor Mofford's outspoken indication that she intended to enforce Article XXVIII, and that she expected Government employees to comply."
1996.95-974,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1664.514,1673.7,"But in view of the Attorney General's opinion, enforcement of it does not seem to have a realistic prospect of any effect on Ms. Yniguez."
1996.95-974,1,40160,robert_h_pohlman,,1673.7,1689.491,"First, Mr. Chief Justice, Ms. Yniguez did not have the benefit of that particular Attorney General's opinion until some 3-1/2 months after this litigation was commenced, so for that 3-1/2 month period of time, her rights were obviously chilled."
1996.95-974,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1689.491,1697.936,"Well, but if they were chilled for 3-1/2 months and then all of a sudden unchilled, the lawsuit doesn't go ahead on the basis of what was the case earlier, does it?"
1996.95-974,1,40160,robert_h_pohlman,,1697.936,1699.769,"It doesn't, Mr. Chief Justice."
1996.95-974,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1710.445,1711.597,Nonbinding on whom?
1996.95-974,1,40160,robert_h_pohlman,,1711.597,1714.388,The... it was not binding on any court.
1996.95-974,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1714.388,1714.839,Ah.
1996.95-974,1,40160,robert_h_pohlman,,1714.839,1716.019,It was binding--
1996.95-974,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1716.019,1719.14,But the court wasn't... but the claim wasn't that the court was going to prosecute her.
1996.95-974,1,40160,robert_h_pohlman,,1735.372,1743.998,"--My understanding, Justice Souter, is that it would be binding on those lower administrative employees, including Catherine Eden, who was one of the defendants who was--"
1996.95-974,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1743.998,1764.22,"So that leaves the Governor, and isn't it also the case that prior to the district court judgment, in any even prior certainly to the expiration of the appeal period, the Governor herself had gone on record in her own right as saying that she thought it was proper to use English if necessary to discharge one's duties in a reasonable way."
1996.95-974,1,40160,robert_h_pohlman,,1765.311,1773.827,"--In the record, Justice Souter, the Governor always said that she would enforce the article until such time as the judgment was entered by the district court."
1996.95-974,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1778.051,1799.904,"No, but didn't she at some point, and I'm not positive of what this moment was, didn't she also indicate, quite apart from her general position that the amendment should be enforced, that she believed it was proper for a State employee to use some non-English language if that was reasonable in the discharge of the employee's duties?"
1996.95-974,1,40160,robert_h_pohlman,,1800.685,1802.377,"--That's not my understanding, Justice Souter."
1996.95-974,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1809.901,1812.983,But well before judgment was reached in the district court.
1996.95-974,1,40160,robert_h_pohlman,,1812.983,1834.078,"--Yes, Your Honor, before judgment was reached and before trial, and at the trial the district court judge determined that, notwithstanding that Attorney General's opinion, given what Governor Mofford had said in public, and given the immediacy of the chilling effect on Ms. Yniguez' rights, that there was, in fact, an injury in fact to her, notwithstanding that opinion, and that is why he entered the declaratory relief--"
1996.95-974,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1834.078,1864.538,"Is your view that there should be no vacation of any decision, not the Ninth Circuit's, and if that is your view, how can, at least with respect to the Ninth Circuit when the plaintiff was no longer in the State's employ and before the Ninth Circuit reached its judgment, how can you defend keeping that judgment on the books?"
1996.95-974,1,40160,robert_h_pohlman,,1864.538,1872.633,"--Justice Ginsburg, I think what we do is, we look at the Bonner Mall Partnership case, and we find that vacatur is an equitable doctrine."
1996.95-974,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1915.441,1918.795,"Well, how can a district court prevent someone from appealing?"
1996.95-974,1,40160,robert_h_pohlman,,1927.869,1929.581,"--No, Your Honor."
1996.95-974,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1939.248,1943.829,What you're saying is no one who was then in the lawsuit was interested in appealing.
1996.95-974,1,40160,robert_h_pohlman,,1946.671,1947.282,Exactly.
1996.95-974,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1947.282,1963.224,"And it was only after final judgment was entered with respect to those two parties that additional people asked to come in, one AOE and the other the Attorney General."
1996.95-974,1,40160,robert_h_pohlman,,1963.224,1964.463,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1996.95-974,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1964.463,1969.627,"And the district court said no, I deny your motion, your post judgment motion to intervene."
1996.95-974,1,40160,robert_h_pohlman,,1969.627,1970.756,That is exactly--
1996.95-974,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1970.756,1979.054,"And the first thing that the court of appeals did was to reverse that denial as to AOE, right?"
1996.95-974,1,40160,robert_h_pohlman,,1979.054,1979.933,--That is correct.
1996.95-974,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1979.933,1987.069,And then what the district... what the court of appeals did concerning the Attorney General I'm not altogether clear.
1996.95-974,1,40160,robert_h_pohlman,,1995.995,2016.468,"I... yes and no, and the reason I answer it that way, Justice Ginsburg, is because they were permitted to intervene under... and I would share Mr. Zall's view that it's kind of a bizarre application of 28 U.S.C. 2403(b), but the Attorney General is permitted to intervene for the purpose of arguing the constitutionality of the amendment."
1996.95-974,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2030.928,2041.814,"But the State's position, as I understand it, is that the case became moot when the plaintiff left the State's employ, and that happened before the Ninth Circuit's judgment."
1996.95-974,1,40160,robert_h_pohlman,,2041.814,2049.429,"Justice Ginsburg, that's the State's position of the day, although their position has never been consistent throughout this litigation."
1996.95-974,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2049.429,2051.433,Whose has?
1996.95-974,1,40160,robert_h_pohlman,,2065.041,2067.472,Justice--
1996.95-974,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2067.472,2069.245,She was the plaintiff.
1996.95-974,1,40160,robert_h_pohlman,,2084.983,2088.505,"--Justice Scalia, she could have appealed at that juncture."
1996.95-974,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2088.505,2092.54,"Well, I thought Yniguez never even asked for nominal damages in the district court."
1996.95-974,1,40160,robert_h_pohlman,,2092.54,2093.969,We did not ask for--
1996.95-974,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2093.969,2094.909,For such other relief.
1996.95-974,1,40160,robert_h_pohlman,,2094.909,2099.314,--We did not ask for nominal damages in the district court at the initial phase.
1996.95-974,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2106.899,2111.414,"Well, actually, you put in zero zero on dollar amounts, did you not?"
1996.95-974,1,40160,robert_h_pohlman,,2111.414,2113.402,--With respect to damages?
1996.95-974,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2113.402,2113.813,Yes.
1996.95-974,1,40160,robert_h_pohlman,,2113.813,2116.465,I don't recall that being in the judgment.
1996.95-974,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2116.465,2124.269,Even if such other relief as may seem just and proper... are they still using that language in Arizona complaints +/?
1996.95-974,1,40160,robert_h_pohlman,,2145.605,2172.812,"Mr. Chief Justice, they are still using that language in Arizona, and what occurred, really, is the Ninth Circuit said, because we had requested at the time that if it goes back, and if there ever is an appeal from the judgment on the merits, which there had not been previously, there had only been an appeal that... a procedural question of whether or not Mr. Zall and his group and the Attorney General could intervene, because up to that point in time Ms. Yniguez had a declaratory judgment in her favor."
1996.95-974,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2180.406,2190.204,"When she did ultimately cross-appeal... she did ultimately cross-appeal after the Ninth Circuit reversed the district court's intervention order, correct?"
1996.95-974,1,40160,robert_h_pohlman,,2190.204,2190.704,That's correct.
1996.95-974,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2190.704,2194.575,"Now, what was the basis for her cross-appeal."
1996.95-974,1,40160,robert_h_pohlman,,2196.467,2205.952,She was asking for a judgment of nominal damages in her favor based upon the rights that she had... had been found to have been violated in the district--
1996.95-974,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2205.952,2221.423,"On the cross-appeal, but since she had made that claim only on cross-appeal, if AOE's appeal was improper because it's an improper party, then her cross-appeal fails because her cross-appeal was only derivative of the main appeal, isn't that correct?"
1996.95-974,1,40160,robert_h_pohlman,,2221.423,2224.515,"--We don't believe so, Justice Kennedy, and the reason is this."
1996.95-974,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2253.233,2256.175,When did the nominal damages cross-appeal occur?
1996.95-974,1,40160,robert_h_pohlman,,2257.957,2261.661,"Within 30 days of the first appeal on the merits, by either of the--"
1996.95-974,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2261.661,2264.503,Could we go back just one step?
1996.95-974,1,40160,robert_h_pohlman,,2269.455,2269.826,--Yes--
1996.95-974,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2269.826,2270.955,--Section 1983?
1996.95-974,1,40160,robert_h_pohlman,,2270.955,2271.876,"--Yes, Justice O'Connor."
1996.95-974,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2271.876,2281.633,And have we not held in cases like Will v. Michigan that States and State officials like the Governor are not persons under 1983?
1996.95-974,1,40160,robert_h_pohlman,,2281.633,2284.304,For purposes of damages?
1996.95-974,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2284.304,2284.975,Yes.
1996.95-974,1,40160,robert_h_pohlman,,2284.975,2285.875,I think--
1996.95-974,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2285.875,2294.422,"So how could the district court ever, under a 1983 suit, assess even nominal damages against the State?"
1996.95-974,1,40160,robert_h_pohlman,,2294.422,2301.065,"--It's my understanding that under the Ex parte Young doctrine there can be an award of nominal damages, and I don't have the case before me."
1996.95-974,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2312.064,2314.825,Where do we find that express waiver in the record?
1996.95-974,1,40160,robert_h_pohlman,,2314.825,2323.281,"That would be on page 32 of our appendix in Ms. Yniguez' brief, which is the letter from the Attorney General, at that point in time Grant Woods."
1996.95-974,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2323.281,2325.281,In your brief on the merits here?
1996.95-974,1,40160,robert_h_pohlman,,2325.281,2325.772,Yes.
1996.95-974,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2345.144,2356.82,"Mr. Pohlman, I take it you are recognizing that the Attorney General was a proper party adverse to you in the court of appeals."
1996.95-974,1,40160,robert_h_pohlman,,2378.756,2380.066,That's quite accurate.
1996.95-974,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2380.066,2390.835,"Now, if that's so, the State's position here is that the case is moot, at least when the plaintiff left the employ of the State of Arizona."
1996.95-974,1,40160,robert_h_pohlman,,2425.526,2447.181,"Justice Ginsburg, that would follow normally under Munsingwear if, in fact, there had been no judgment for nominal damages, that had not been appealed and had actually been expressly waived, that judgment by the State, and they had opposed that all the way through the Ninth Circuit and then decided after that judgment was entered to eschew a judicial review of that."
1996.95-974,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2447.181,2451.533,So you're hanging everything on that $1 of nominal damages.
1996.95-974,1,40160,robert_h_pohlman,,2451.533,2453.894,"No, Justice Ginsburg, I would not say that."
1996.95-974,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2460.999,2462.311,"Well, what else is there?"
1996.95-974,1,40160,robert_h_pohlman,,2490.419,2495.902,"Absent the nominal damages under normal circumstance, Justice Ginsburg, I think that would be the case."
1996.95-974,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2547.767,2548.867,And what was his standing?
1996.95-974,1,40160,robert_h_pohlman,,2548.867,2553.551,--Senator Gutierrez was a State legislator at the time.
1996.95-974,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2553.551,2556.122,"He had the same standing as the petitioner does here, in other words."
1996.95-974,1,40160,robert_h_pohlman,,2556.122,2559.454,I would say he had much greater standing in the sense that--
1996.95-974,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2559.454,2562.566,He voted for this measure?
1996.95-974,1,40160,robert_h_pohlman,,2562.807,2565.559,"--Senator Gutierrez would not have voted for this, Justice Stevens."
1996.95-974,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2569.87,2570.902,"In other words, he voted against it."
1996.95-974,1,40160,robert_h_pohlman,,2570.902,2573.132,--I would expect he voted against it.
1996.95-974,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2573.132,2574.504,"So what... again, what is his standing?"
1996.95-974,1,40160,robert_h_pohlman,,2574.504,2587.803,"A State legislator whose conduct was threatened by Article XXVIII in that he routinely, as many State legislatures... legislators do, communicated with his constituents during the performance of Government business in languages other than English."
1996.95-974,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2587.803,2594.048,"Your position, Mr. Pohlman, is that AOE has no standing here, I take it."
1996.95-974,1,40160,robert_h_pohlman,,2594.048,2595.159,Yes.
1996.95-974,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2595.159,2602.332,And where does that leave people who vote and perhaps organize to get a referendum passed.
1996.95-974,1,40160,robert_h_pohlman,,2623.927,2629.46,"Once it gets to that point in time, Mr. Chief Justice, I don't think anyone defends the action."
1996.95-974,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2634.783,2636.656,"What if they don't, though?"
1996.95-974,1,40160,robert_h_pohlman,,2642.029,2651.295,In that event I would suggest to Mr. Chief Justice that the voters who passed the initiative would probably change the administration when they next went to the polls.
1996.95-974,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2651.295,2657.658,But there's no way for anybody to come in and defend the initiative if the Governor and the Attorney General won't do it.
1996.95-974,1,40160,robert_h_pohlman,,2657.658,2659.711,"In our view, that would be the case."
1996.95-974,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2659.711,2669.616,"Well, there is a citizens suit provision, and the citizens can sue in State court to enforce something that's been validly passed under the very terms of the provision that was passed, is that not so?"
1996.95-974,1,40160,robert_h_pohlman,,2669.616,2672.477,"There is, indeed, an enforcement provision in the--"
1996.95-974,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2672.477,2675.329,Anybody who claims to be adversely affected.
1996.95-974,1,40160,robert_h_pohlman,,2675.329,2679.713,"--Anyone who desires, I believe, Your Honor, to enforce the provisions."
1996.95-974,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2679.713,2682.674,So there is a citizens suit provision.
1996.95-974,1,40160,robert_h_pohlman,,2684.995,2697.875,"Your Honor, I'm not so sure that a citizens suit provision in an initiative like this would give any citizen of the State of Arizona then carte blanche under Article III to challenge a declaration by the--"
1996.95-974,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2697.875,2701.378,I guess we don't worry about Article III in State court actions.
1996.95-974,1,40160,robert_h_pohlman,,2701.378,2705.369,"--You're right, in State court they could challenge it, and that challenge would still be viable today."
1996.95-974,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2705.369,2706.08,Exactly.
1996.95-974,1,40160,robert_h_pohlman,,2722.94,2725.163,"That's accurate, Justice Kennedy."
1996.95-974,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2725.163,2749.147,"But the citizens suit provision may come up against a barrier if there's previously been an action in the Federal court where the Governor and the Attorney General are enjoined from enforcing it, which went by default, so the Attorney General and the Governor would then have a perfectly good defense to the citizens suit provision of res judicata as a result of the Federal action."
1996.95-974,1,40160,robert_h_pohlman,,2749.147,2754.102,"Mr. Chief Justice, I think that may be true with respect to the Attorney General and the Governor."
1996.95-974,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2763.348,2765.228,And I guess there was no injunction here.
1996.95-974,1,40160,robert_h_pohlman,,2767.178,2768.691,--It was simply a declaratory judgment.
1996.95-974,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2771.713,2778.588,"Mr. Pohlman, may I go back to Justice Ginsburg's question going to the issue of whether we should vacate the district court judgment?"
1996.95-974,1,40160,robert_h_pohlman,,2864.162,2869.487,"--I would espouse that argument to oppose vacating the district court order, exactly."
1996.95-974,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2887.151,2890.063,But that was... wasn't that after the appeal period had run?
1996.95-974,1,40160,robert_h_pohlman,,2890.063,2891.883,"No, Your Honor, it was not."
1996.95-974,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2898.167,2898.938,"Oh, so--"
1996.95-974,1,40160,robert_h_pohlman,,2907.725,2908.342,Exactly.
1996.95-974,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2908.342,2930.497,"Well, if that's the case, then, then the Attorney General was not in only on the limited basis that my suggestion gave him, so I suppose if you accept his standing as a party at that point, and you take the position that he should have been allowed in, period, then I guess the argument for vacating is a valid argument."
1996.95-974,1,40160,robert_h_pohlman,,2930.497,2954.664,"Justice Souter, we would disagree with that for some of the reasons that have been said before, but in fact, and this goes back again to the ruling by the Ninth Circuit with regard to 2403(b), in fact you're entitled to intervene as the State, not as a party, but with all the rights and obligations of a party at that point in time, and the district court recognized there is no right to intervene at that point, or at least felt that way."
1996.95-974,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2970.553,2971.043,Mm-hmm.
1996.95-974,1,40160,robert_h_pohlman,,2971.043,2976.746,"--And that was the position... they never appealed that particular ruling, and that was the way that--"
1996.95-974,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2976.746,2977.978,"Ah, so that's why they're stuck."
1996.95-974,1,40160,robert_h_pohlman,,3017.124,3017.595,--I--
1996.95-974,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3017.595,3027.411,"Now, you pointed to a place in the district court's opinion which says I, the district judge, think there was a reasonable threat of prosecution."
1996.95-974,1,40160,robert_h_pohlman,,3033.314,3055.539,"--You will find the testimony in our appendix attached to our brief on the merits at pages 14 and 15, which is the testimony of Ms. Yniguez concerning her fear that she may be prosecuted, or that there may be a citizens suit based upon the test of Article XXVIII."
1996.95-974,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3071.8,3073.512,Was Ms. Yniguez... excuse me.
1996.95-974,1,40160,robert_h_pohlman,,3081.877,3087.752,"--That is in the stipulated facts that are in the joint appendix, I believe."
1996.95-974,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3097.087,3101.939,"Mr. Pohlman, I hate to come back to this, but I'm still not clear on it."
1996.95-974,1,40160,robert_h_pohlman,,3114.977,3129.268,"The cross-appeal for the denial of nominal damages occurred shortly after the first appeal on the merits was ever filed by any intervenor, and that was after the case had been remanded, following the decision on the suggestion of--"
1996.95-974,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3129.268,3129.887,Okay.
1996.95-974,1,40160,robert_h_pohlman,,3129.887,3130.748,--It was the first--
1996.95-974,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3130.748,3131.349,"After remand, though."
1996.95-974,1,40160,robert_h_pohlman,,3141.186,3143.627,"--The original appeal was not on the merits, Justice Scalia."
1996.95-974,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3143.627,3144.108,I understand.
1996.95-974,1,40160,robert_h_pohlman,,3144.108,3150.73,That's why the cross-appeal we are not entitled to unless there are... we don't need to cross-appeal on the judgment unless there is actually an appeal on the judgment.
1996.95-974,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3159.158,3177.928,"Did the stipulation you... as to the facts covering the Governor's position, I thought that stipulation said nothing about the Governor intending to take enforcement actions, just that the Governor intended to comply."
1996.95-974,1,40160,robert_h_pohlman,,3192.749,3196.662,"Justice O'Connor, I don't believe there's anything that says that per se."
1996.95-974,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3196.662,3197.483,"No, I didn't think so."
1996.95-974,1,40160,robert_h_pohlman,,3197.483,3202.546,In our appendix at page 8 to our brief on the merits some of the stipulations appear.
1996.95-974,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3202.546,3204.026,In your red brief?
1996.95-974,1,40160,robert_h_pohlman,,3204.026,3204.236,Pardon me?
1996.95-974,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3204.236,3205.127,This is in your red brief?
1996.95-974,1,40160,robert_h_pohlman,,3205.127,3206.798,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, in the red brief."
1996.95-974,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3206.798,3207.629,Page 8?
1996.95-974,1,40160,robert_h_pohlman,,3207.629,3213.492,Page 8 of our appendix shows some of the stipulations pertaining to what occurs in the disciplinary process.
1996.95-974,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3220.638,3223.018,Disciplined under this statute?
1996.95-974,1,40160,robert_h_pohlman,,3223.018,3224.198,"--Not under this statute, no."
1996.95-974,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3228.442,3230.613,"Well, that's scarcely surprising."
1996.95-974,1,40160,robert_h_pohlman,,3230.803,3236.146,"--That they would be disciplined for that, and that's what we agreed, Mr. Chief Justice."
1996.95-974,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3238.85,3244.494,"Well, but the question is, did the enactment of this law put her in fear of her job."
1996.95-974,1,40160,robert_h_pohlman,,3244.494,3253.928,"Yes, it did, and that is precisely what the district court found, that she had a reasonable belief that she may be disciplined if she in fact spoke something other than English on the job."
1996.95-974,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3253.928,3255.44,"Thank you, Mr. Pohlman."
1996.95-974,2,18183,barnaby_w_zall,,3257.82,3275.483,I'd like to point the Court's attention to the rulings of the two lower courts on this case.
1996.95-974,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3353.405,3379.58,"Well, the Attorney General's position is, wisdom has come a little late, but now the Attorney General is enlightened and understands that long before any judgment was entered in the Ninth Circuit the case was moot, so if we accept that, that wipes out the Ninth Circuit's decision, because the Ninth Circuit has no authority to issue a judgment in a moot case."
1996.95-974,2,18183,barnaby_w_zall,,3379.58,3383.153,--It would also wipe out the district court opinion.
1996.95-974,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3383.153,3398.382,"Not necessarily, because if the mootness occurred on appeal, you don't ordinarily wipe out a final judgment from which no party to that judgment has appealed."
1996.95-974,2,18183,barnaby_w_zall,,3431.214,3437.669,"Your Honor, the problem with the hypothetical is that this is not a standard contract case or an employment problem case."
1996.95-974,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3455.34,3469.04,"But you can't rely on a judgment that's vacated, and the Federal court has no authority to deal with anything that isn't a genuine controversy at the time judgment was entered."
1996.95-974,2,18183,barnaby_w_zall,,3469.04,3485.16,"--But, Your Honor, the problem is, if we go into State court and say, sue anyone in the State, the defense by everyone is, the district court for Arizona has held this statute... this constitutional provision unconstitutional in its entirety."
1996.95-974,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3485.16,3494.677,It was my understanding that a district court's judgment doesn't necessarily bind even another district judge in the same district.
1996.95-974,2,18183,barnaby_w_zall,,3494.677,3495.248,But it does--
1996.95-974,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3495.248,3497.589,So how does it bind a State court?
1996.95-974,2,18183,barnaby_w_zall,,3497.589,3507.065,"--It doesn't bind it in the sense that it's automatically controlling, but in a number of cases... FDIC v. Jennings, I think in the Tenth Amendment--"
1996.95-974,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3507.065,3508.665,"It's like a law review article, isn't it?"
1996.95-974,2,18183,barnaby_w_zall,,3508.665,3518.732,"--It's the prospect of an unfavorable precedent looming over the case to the extent that a State court judge is going to say, this is a question of Federal law."
1996.95-974,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3528.708,3542.117,I've known some State judges who would do that.
1996.95-974,2,18183,barnaby_w_zall,,3542.658,3543.106,No.
1996.95-974,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3544.929,3547.209,There's six in Phoenix and three in Tucson.
1996.95-974,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3547.5,3550.913,"Thank you, Mr. Zall."
