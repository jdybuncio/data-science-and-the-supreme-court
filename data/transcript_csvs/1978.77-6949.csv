1978.77-6949,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,1.016,Case is submitted.
1978.77-6949,0,21491,daniel_j_sears,,195.013,196.791,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1978.77-6949,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,304.838,309.21,I take it he just didn't wander into the attorney's office that day?
1978.77-6949,0,21491,daniel_j_sears,,309.21,321.704,"Your Honor, although the record is silent as to this, I believe the evidence would indicate that Mr. Dunn met Mr. Musgrave and then proceeded to strike a deal with him."
1978.77-6949,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,354.825,361.461,"Well, when he reaffirmed the affidavit, will you enlarge on that, he was under oath before a grand jury then?"
1978.77-6949,0,21491,daniel_j_sears,,361.461,363.731,"He was under oath before U.S. District Judge, Your Honor."
1978.77-6949,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,363.731,364.604,District Judge?
1978.77-6949,0,21491,daniel_j_sears,,364.604,365.763,Yes.
1978.77-6949,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,366.619,375.081,And did he simply say he reaffirmed it in a conclusory way or did he restate the same facts?
1978.77-6949,0,21491,daniel_j_sears,,375.081,382.093,"Your Honor, I believe the nature of the testimony went that he was asked to identify the affidavit, did identify it."
1978.77-6949,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,399.776,403.074,"When -- when you say 90% false, that was directed at what?"
1978.77-6949,0,21491,daniel_j_sears,,406.444,407.078,"No, Your Honor."
1978.77-6949,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,441.444,444.07,How did it prejudiced you?
1978.77-6949,0,21491,daniel_j_sears,,444.07,456.955,"Your Honor, it prejudiced in our preparation for the case and that we were preparing to go to trial contesting the ancillariness of the September 30th proceeding rather than the October 21st proceeding."
1978.77-6949,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,461.185,463.019,"Well, you knew it had taken place?"
1978.77-6949,0,21491,daniel_j_sears,,463.019,463.401,Pardon?
1978.77-6949,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,463.401,464.756,You knew it had taken place?
1978.77-6949,0,21491,daniel_j_sears,,464.756,486.501,"We did know it had taken place, Your Honor, and -- but as the Assistant United States Attorney conceded prior to the introduction of that transcript and as we indicated to the Court, we have not been provided with the copy of that transcript under Rule 16 and the Government Attorney conceded that he did not contemplate it as evidence in the case in chief."
1978.77-6949,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,492.529,495.326,How factually were you prejudiced?
1978.77-6949,0,21491,daniel_j_sears,,495.326,504.278,"Your Honor, we were prejudiced on the basis that our defense had been prepared to challenge the ancillariness of the September 30th proceeding and not the October 21st."
1978.77-6949,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,504.278,513.779,"So you couldn't use it, but how are you disadvantaged by your any inability you have to challenge the October proceeding?"
1978.77-6949,0,21491,daniel_j_sears,,513.779,533.419,"Your Honor, the only way I can respond to his honor's question is that we did not have sufficient notice to prepare a theory in that regard and we were not -- we were not expecting that we're going to have to meet that evidence as a basis for an ancillary proceeding as the court subsequently ruled."
1978.77-6949,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,533.419,537.458,Do you regard this situation as a prosecution blunder?
1978.77-6949,0,21491,daniel_j_sears,,537.458,542.282,"Quite candidly, Your Honor, yes."
1978.77-6949,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,544.734,551.445,"Mr. Sears, you don't -- you don't disagree with the fact the October 21st proceeding was a proceeding within the meaning of the statute?"
1978.77-6949,0,21491,daniel_j_sears,,551.445,553.846,I don't challenge that in the least regard.
1978.77-6949,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,569.953,578.789,"And as I remember the Solicitor General's brief, he agrees with you that they must establish that the September 30th affidavit was the proceeding in order to sustain that prosecution."
1978.77-6949,0,21491,daniel_j_sears,,578.789,579.538,That is correct.
1978.77-6949,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,579.538,580.367,He agrees to that.
1978.77-6949,0,21491,daniel_j_sears,,580.738,583.104,Yes and that would be our position.
1978.77-6949,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,583.104,587.707,And the (Inaudible) does it in one way in contrast the way the Tenth Circuit did?
1978.77-6949,0,21491,daniel_j_sears,,587.707,589.826,I believe that was part of our argument.
1978.77-6949,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,676.171,680.698,"Well, isn't the Bill of Particulars to provide facts?"
1978.77-6949,0,21491,daniel_j_sears,,680.698,682.569,"Yes, Your Honor and --"
1978.77-6949,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,682.569,691.188,"If the Government states facts in an indictment or an information which show that a crime has been committed, it doesn't have to tell you its legal theory, does it?"
1978.77-6949,0,21491,daniel_j_sears,,691.188,702.81,"No, it doesn't have to state the legal theory, Your Honor, in so far as it need not further explain the indictment of the defense which the defense must meet."
1978.77-6949,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,723.686,725.045,"Well, you got an answer."
1978.77-6949,0,21491,daniel_j_sears,,725.045,725.696,Pardon?
1978.77-6949,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,725.696,727.582,"And you received an answer, didn't you?"
1978.77-6949,0,21491,daniel_j_sears,,727.779,728.934,"Yes, we did."
1978.77-6949,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,741.715,744.169,And that was the submission of the jury?
1978.77-6949,0,21491,daniel_j_sears,,744.169,755.429,That is correct and the Court so instructed the jury that the Government need not prove which of the declarations was false.
1978.77-6949,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1045.723,1048.202,"We're not back to (Inaudible) pleadings, are we?"
1978.77-6949,0,21491,daniel_j_sears,,1053.877,1068.175,"Your Honor, I submit due to the peculiar nature of proof under Section 1623 (c) theory that is only the declarations that are specifically set out in the two proceedings that can be at issue before either the trial court or jury."
1978.77-6949,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1068.175,1070.413,And the Government agrees with you on that here and this Court?
1978.77-6949,0,21491,daniel_j_sears,,1070.413,1085.168,Yes and I would submit that the only question of prejudice would come if the October -- if we were considering whether the October 21st admissions were improperly introduced into evidence.
1978.77-6949,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1090.829,1093.274,We will resume -- we'll resume there at one o'clock.
1978.77-6949,0,21491,daniel_j_sears,,1093.274,1115.172,"Thank you, Your Honors."
1978.77-6949,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1115.172,1118.148,"You may continue, Mr. Sears."
1978.77-6949,0,21491,daniel_j_sears,,1118.148,1119.333,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1978.77-6949,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1305.55,1308.84,Do you read that the Government need to?
1978.77-6949,0,21491,daniel_j_sears,,1308.84,1315.007,"Your Honor, we would submit they would need to in order to get around the protection that Dunn was afforded by the immunity order."
1978.77-6949,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1315.007,1318.947,"But under their theory of the case, they didn't need to."
1978.77-6949,0,21491,daniel_j_sears,,1323.744,1329.559,"That is correct, Your Honor and Your Honor the argument in the brief may be somewhat unclear."
1978.77-6949,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1357.326,1369.25,"Counsel, you -- you mentioned the Bane case, hasn't that case been primarily been notable for the fact that almost every court that has had to consider in last 10 to 15 years has distinguished it?"
1978.77-6949,0,21491,daniel_j_sears,,1374.042,1377.85,"Your Honor, I don't recall the specific holding in the Bane case."
1978.77-6949,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1429.739,1433.29,Was that rather broad statement necessary to the holding?
1978.77-6949,0,21491,daniel_j_sears,,1433.29,1438.834,"Your Honor, I believe it was and particularly in view that the Court's recent statement in Portash."
1978.77-6949,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1438.834,1441.743,Was it necessary in Portash?
1978.77-6949,0,21491,daniel_j_sears,,1441.743,1453.668,"I believe it was, Your Honor, under if we are to maintain the holding that when a witness is compelled to testify it completely displaces his Fifth Amendment privilege."
1978.77-6949,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1453.668,1458.387,"Well, what privi -- yeah -- yes, but his privilege is not to incriminate himself, isn't it?"
1978.77-6949,0,21491,daniel_j_sears,,1458.387,1460.397,His privilege is not to incriminate himself --
1978.77-6949,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1460.397,1462.507,Not to be compelled to incriminate himself.
1978.77-6949,0,21491,daniel_j_sears,,1462.507,1464.152,"That's -- that's correct, Your Honor."
1978.77-6949,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1471.415,1474.702,"Well, that is -- that solves your case."
1978.77-6949,0,21491,daniel_j_sears,,1475.673,1476.444,I would hope so.
1978.77-6949,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1476.444,1485.131,"Yes, that's -- that's the issue and that really is the issue in the case but in terms of any past crime."
1978.77-6949,0,21491,daniel_j_sears,,1499.897,1508.47,"Your Honor, it didn't directly incriminate him but it certainly furnished derivative evidence which the Government relied upon him to subsequently convict him."
1978.77-6949,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1513.441,1515.918,"Well, yes, a future crime, that's right."
1978.77-6949,0,21491,daniel_j_sears,,1515.918,1523.531,"Well, Your Honor it really wasn't a future crime because it was testimony uttered in response to the ordered immunity."
1978.77-6949,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1531.719,1532.866,Let me ask you this.
1978.77-6949,0,21491,daniel_j_sears,,1566.126,1568.533,"Your Honor, I would submit that they could not."
1978.77-6949,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1568.533,1572.367,"Yes, and you have to say that or do you?"
1978.77-6949,0,21491,daniel_j_sears,,1572.367,1580.802,"Your Honor, I believe I have to say that to be consistent with Portash and to be consistent with the statement in the reasons behind the statements in Hockenberry and some other Third Circuit, Second Circuit decisions."
1978.77-6949,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1580.802,1585.439,"Yes, but you also have to say it to maintain your position with respect to the inconsistent --"
1978.77-6949,0,21491,daniel_j_sears,,1585.439,1586.294,No question about it.
1978.77-6949,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1586.294,1587.606,"Yes, okay."
1978.77-6949,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1587.606,1600.604,Because you concede that if the prosecution had been for perjury before the grand jury in his immunized testimony that would have been valid.
1978.77-6949,0,21491,daniel_j_sears,,1600.604,1601.782,Clearly.
1978.77-6949,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1605.182,1606.281,And which you accept?
1978.77-6949,0,21491,daniel_j_sears,,1606.281,1608.003,Yes.
1978.77-6949,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1637.542,1642.065,"Would that -- would that apply to a crime and not yet committed, acts not yet a committed, acts not yet committed?"
1978.77-6949,0,21491,daniel_j_sears,,1642.065,1647.964,"Your Honor, I submit that's were the Government is confusing transactional immunity and use immunity."
1978.77-6949,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1741.288,1746.5,But you agree I take it that the immunity need be no broader than the privilege?
1978.77-6949,0,21491,daniel_j_sears,,1746.5,1760.556,"Absolutely, and I submit that it is no broader by protecting Mr. Dunn from use of his very possibly and likely truthful testimony when he did compel when he did testify in compliance with court order."
1978.77-6949,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1760.556,1785.625,"Well suppose -- suppose later some other person is charged with murder or robbery or something and also your client is charged with that later robbery also and has claimed that both of them committed a robbery and he says, ""Well I was never there."
1978.77-6949,0,21491,daniel_j_sears,,1805.244,1808.332,"Your Honor, I submit that points out the very difference between --"
1978.77-6949,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1808.332,1815.249,Can you say his -- do you say that his grand jury testimony then would not be admissible against him in the later prosecution?
1978.77-6949,0,21491,daniel_j_sears,,1815.249,1827.297,"I would say the grand jury testimony could not be used against him but had he had transaction immunity it would have protected him but they -- the Government could establish by extrinsic evidence, the crime."
1978.77-6949,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1828.518,1838.922,"No, I understand but you say that in his prosecution for the later robbery along with somebody else, his grand jury testimony could not be used against him."
1978.77-6949,0,21491,daniel_j_sears,,1838.922,1839.788,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1978.77-6949,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1859.429,1861.764,You may proceed.
1978.77-6949,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1861.764,1865.015,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1978.77-6949,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1949.753,1961.57,Do you concede that the -- that unless the what -- the transaction in the lawyer's office was ran by the statute and this conviction cannot stand.
1978.77-6949,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1961.57,1963.225,We do.
1978.77-6949,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1999.545,2002.711,Where would a pretrial deposition fit in this?
1978.77-6949,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2002.711,2007.459,It would also be ancillary to a court if it was taken for use in a judicial proceeding.
1978.77-6949,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2007.459,2009.531,I think the petitioner concedes a --
1978.77-6949,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2009.531,2011.738,He conceded us with that as with a deposition.
1978.77-6949,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2013.445,2015.016,"No, I know."
1978.77-6949,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2016.301,2026.529,This was an affidavit and we say it's like the affidavit that would be prepared for summary judgment motion or in connection with the 2255 motion.
1978.77-6949,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2026.529,2028.894,"Just one other point on that, Mr. Frey."
1978.77-6949,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2044.251,2048.639,"Well, we're not saying -- we still think there's no doubt that the October 21st --"
1978.77-6949,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2048.639,2050.842,"I understand, would you still say the September 30th?"
1978.77-6949,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2050.842,2059.917,"Yes, we -- our position is that the September 30th proceeding at the -- when he made the statement then and there, that was a proceeding ancillary to a court."
1978.77-6949,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2059.917,2064.01,"And you'd take the same position even if there have never been a proceeding on October 21st, yes."
1978.77-6949,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2064.01,2075.962,"We would take that position but we have an alternative argument that if the Court is not satisfied with that that at least when the affidavit is in fact submitted to the Court, that it retroactively makes it --"
1978.77-6949,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2075.962,2078.85,Had the effect to make in the earlier --
1978.77-6949,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2078.85,2085.809,And he in effect takes his chances if he gives sworn testimony that he knows as for use in connection with the federal court case.
1978.77-6949,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2095.4,2099.805,But you take the chance that you could have indicted him October 21st proceeding also.
1978.77-6949,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2099.805,2104.8,"Well, he -- I think it's clear that we could have indicted him for the October 21st proceeding."
1978.77-6949,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2106.771,2120.433,I would think your affidavit by itself contention is a good deal weaker than your deposition type of contention because of the word proceeding in the statute.
1978.77-6949,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2144.238,2154.121,"Well, but that it seems to me goes -- I mean the kind of concern that you're addressing is an issue for the jury as to his intent and knowledge in making the statements."
1978.77-6949,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2154.121,2157.496,Or the formalities of the situation?
1978.77-6949,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2157.496,2164.39,"Well, I'm -- we are not suggesting that this is in fact the deposition."
1978.77-6949,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2175.832,2182.253,"What you're really saying is that it's functionally equivalent to use that phrase over deposition, aren't you?"
1978.77-6949,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2182.253,2195.081,"Well, in some respects but there was not counsel for both parties to the case was not present and since it is connection with the criminal case their restrictions on depositions that don't exist on the civil case."
1978.77-6949,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2195.081,2204.348,"There's no hostility between the person who signed the affidavit and the person who presumably prepared it here, is there?"
1978.77-6949,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2204.348,2214.147,"In this case, well, I don't -- I can't say whether there was hostility or not but they were both on the same side of the Musgrave case whatever their motivations or feelings are."
1978.77-6949,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2214.147,2220.958,"But at that time, it was prepared and signed they all thought they were on the same high road presumably?"
1978.77-6949,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2220.958,2224.22,I gather petitioner felt it better.
1978.77-6949,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2224.22,2225.543,Helped Mr. Musgrave out?
1978.77-6949,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2225.543,2225.825,Yes.
1978.77-6949,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2225.825,2229.313,But now does that cut out in favor or against you really?
1978.77-6949,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2229.766,2229.967,I don't.
1978.77-6949,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2229.967,2239.15,-- the proceeding concept to me suggests a fairly formal type of situation where you have perhaps adversary parties and that sort of thing.
1978.77-6949,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2239.15,2242.918,"Well, I don't want to."
1978.77-6949,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2276.171,2278.549,But what if it weren't there after submitted to a court?
1978.77-6949,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2282.031,2296.246,"Well, I would say that if he simply prepared an affidavit and put it in a mail to Musgrave's lawyer, that would be a much more difficult case I'm not clear that we would contend that that was the proceeding ancillary to the Court."
1978.77-6949,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2296.246,2299.326,Or the affidavit had --- this was filed in the Court?
1978.77-6949,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2299.326,2309.05,"Indeed, it was -- he testified in the Court that the statements that he had made were wholly true and that is grand jury testimony."
1978.77-6949,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2309.05,2313.737,"But the affidavit itself was filed and was the basis for the motion, wasn't it?"
1978.77-6949,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2313.737,2314.145,I think so.
1978.77-6949,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2314.145,2315.461,On which there was a hearing.
1978.77-6949,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2316.395,2317.112,That's right.
1978.77-6949,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2317.934,2323.269,So that incident was quite similar to an affidavit filed in support or an opposition to a motion for summary judgment.
1978.77-6949,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2323.269,2325.824,"Absolutely, yes it's very similar to that."
1978.77-6949,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2325.824,2328.299,As I understand your position which I'm sure I'm right.
1978.77-6949,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2339.517,2343.671,"Well, I suggested that I would have a lot more difficulty with that."
1978.77-6949,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2343.671,2344.449,Why?
1978.77-6949,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2345.138,2356.827,"Well, because if it was never filed in Court, I think it would depend on more facts if he went and he said we want you to make a statement in connection with a judicial proceeding."
1978.77-6949,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2356.827,2357.756,Right.(Voice Overlap)
1978.77-6949,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2357.756,2361.983,And then I think there was an argument that that would be ancillary to a court which is --
1978.77-6949,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2361.983,2365.787,"And simply, your argument is exactly the same if I read your brief correctly."
1978.77-6949,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2365.787,2367.069,"Well, --"
1978.77-6949,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2367.069,2369.669,If you don't require it to actually be filed under your theory.
1978.77-6949,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2369.669,2371.869,"We do not -- that's right, our theory does not depend on some --"
1978.77-6949,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2371.869,2374.384,And I don't think it makes any difference if it's in a lawyer's office.
1978.77-6949,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2377.026,2378.749,"Yes, that's correct."
1978.77-6949,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2378.749,2379.495,Yes.
1978.77-6949,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2379.495,2387.022,I'm worried about the trappings I used at (Inaudible) that you need to bring this under the Court.
1978.77-6949,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2392.205,2400.248,"Well, you mean if he gave a sworn statement which was made before somebody authorize to administer oaths and he know --"
1978.77-6949,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2400.248,2401.97,Bar and (Inaudible).
1978.77-6949,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2401.97,2402.185,"Well, --"
1978.77-6949,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2402.185,2404.248,To try your false in the Court as I can.
1978.77-6949,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2404.248,2416.863,I'm afraid that our position would still be as Justice Stevens suggested that would be ancillary to a court that might be question if it was in a bar by whether it was drunk and knew what he was doing which would go to his guilt in terms because the statements have to be knowing statement.
1978.77-6949,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2416.863,2421.233,"Well, what is it that makes it “ancillary” to the Court?"
1978.77-6949,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2421.233,2429.148,The fact that it is given for use in connection with the judicial proceeding in the federal court and given under oath.
1978.77-6949,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2429.148,2430.805,And knowing they've given for that purpose.
1978.77-6949,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2430.805,2433.513,Knowingly given as a requirement of the signing of guilt.
1978.77-6949,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2433.513,2437.995,In the sense that you suggested as an affidavit on summary judgment?
1978.77-6949,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2437.995,2441.066,"Yes, I think it's -- I think it's very similar."
1978.77-6949,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2444.743,2450.198,"Mr. Frey before you get to that, if you lose this first issue, do we have to meet the second?"
1978.77-6949,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2450.198,2465.455,"Well, I don't think you have to meet the second issue but we suggest that you should meet the second issue because what will happen in all likelihood is that we will go back and re-indict Mr. Dunn on either of two theories."
1978.77-6949,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2486.518,2486.807,So the U.S.Attorney --
1978.77-6949,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2486.807,2488.22,The same issue --
1978.77-6949,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2488.22,2490.443,-- will do what he should have done in the first place?
1978.77-6949,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2490.443,2490.943,"Well, it would."
1978.77-6949,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2494.516,2501.112,"Well, I was just wondering if we aren't in your theory if you lose the first issue, we wouldn't be rendering an advisory opinion."
1978.77-6949,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2501.112,2512.259,"Well, I don't believe you would because it is an issue that will arise in the further litigation of this case and it will be back before the Court shortly assuming you still --"
1978.77-6949,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2512.259,2514.438,"Well, that's no answer to its (Inaudible)."
1978.77-6949,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2519.9,2521.834,There isn't any second indictment yet.
1978.77-6949,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2521.834,2522.674,That's right.
1978.77-6949,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2522.674,2525.075,"Well, there is not yet a second indictment and --"
1978.77-6949,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2525.851,2535.668,"But I think the Court has the, in a two-issue case where there are two independent issues, the court has the choice of starting with on issue or the other and it's a matter of --"
1978.77-6949,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2535.668,2538.55,"The constitutional issue or the statutory issue, which do we start with?"
1978.77-6949,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2538.55,2540.741,"Well, the -- well, I --"
1978.77-6949,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2540.741,2547.575,"Well, you think that the -- your position is the immunity statute co-extensive with the constitutional privilege that's really a constitutional issue."
1978.77-6949,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2547.575,2551.206,It is a constitutional issue that builds a statutory aspect to that issue.
1978.77-6949,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2551.206,2553.048,"Yes, but don't we normally start with the statutory issue?"
1978.77-6949,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2553.048,2561.034,"Well, I'm not suggesting by any means that you're required to reach the other issue if you decide any ancillary proceeding issue adversely to us."
1978.77-6949,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2572.269,2577.385,"But it would persist that if there's an acquittal, it's all over then there'd be no appeal, there will be no nothing."
1978.77-6949,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2577.385,2579.08,"Yes, I understand that."
1978.77-6949,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2582.927,2586.089,The question is that the question --
1978.77-6949,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2586.089,2587.208,I think it's the prudential question --
1978.77-6949,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2587.208,2589.534,-- is whether it's desirable or wise or even proper?
1978.77-6949,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2589.534,2590.825,Yes.
1978.77-6949,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2590.825,2603.208,Of course we don't mean to agree with you that we are not entitled to look at the grand -- at the -- our court statement either.
1978.77-6949,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2603.208,2604.173,You don't need to agree with us now.
1978.77-6949,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2604.173,2605.441,The Court of Appeals might be right.
1978.77-6949,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2605.441,2607.154,They might be right.
1978.77-6949,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2607.927,2610.407,In which event we reach the others?
1978.77-6949,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2610.407,2612.888,"You would, yes."
1978.77-6949,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2842.611,2846.304,And the privilege of course was not to testify at all?
1978.77-6949,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2846.304,2858.689,"Well, I understand that but let me point out the fallacy in his position that he must be left in the same position as if he had not testified at all?"
1978.77-6949,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2858.95,2864.866,"You would agree that that's what the privilege, that would be consequence of the exercise or the privilege, would be not to testify at all."
1978.77-6949,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2864.866,2870.739,"Yes, and -- will save himself a lot of inconvenience as he would save himself possibly losing his job."
1978.77-6949,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2883.18,2886.886,"Mr. Frey, could I interrupt you for a moment."
1978.77-6949,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2895.105,2898.553,"No, I'm speaking of the privilege of a witness to --"
1978.77-6949,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2898.553,2898.978,"Well, I understood --"
1978.77-6949,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2898.978,2900.849,Refused to answer questions that are incriminating.
1978.77-6949,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2900.849,2908.014,That's not a privilege not to testify at all as I believe and understood it's a privilege not to compulsorily incriminate oneself.
1978.77-6949,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2908.014,2917.126,"I agree although as to the particular questions that were asked here, he had a right not to answer those questions because his answers would have been self-incriminatory."
1978.77-6949,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2917.126,2922.657,"Well even in the trial courts, the privilege is not absolute to justify its assertion, is it?"
1978.77-6949,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2922.657,2923.672,"That's true, it is not --"
1978.77-6949,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2923.672,2928.011,It can be an inquiry by the Court to determine whether it's a validly assertion.
1978.77-6949,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2928.011,2939.983,And the -- and the privilege exists only in the areas where he has exist only in the areas where he has a risk of current self-incrimination which of course is the point that we're saying here that he doesn't have.
1978.77-6949,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3389.509,3398.987,You're really suggesting that the agreement on the immunity should be ignored for failure of consideration in effect.
1978.77-6949,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3398.987,3401.917,"Well, that is a secondary argument."
1978.77-6949,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3427.728,3438.791,Wasn't -- wasn't this even more specifically said by my Brother Brennan in the Fried case in his --
1978.77-6949,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3438.791,3443.137,"Yes, I think the Fried case of course is, it's a case on which we quite strongly rely on."
1978.77-6949,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3527.938,3530.05,"Mr. Frey, this is really an ancillary."
1978.77-6949,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3542.615,3556.397,"Well, I am saying that and it is (Voice Overlap) and obviously the problem only arises because the otherwise language is susceptible to a limiting construction."
1978.77-6949,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3556.397,3565.644,"But even if you give it to limiting instructions, usually you've made an ancillary in the sense that just as he had an obligation to tell the truth, he also implicitly has agreed not to recant?"
1978.77-6949,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3565.644,3575.774,"Well, I suggest that and I suggest that a contrary construction adverse to our position would not comport with what Congress must have intended."
1978.77-6949,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3578.174,3580.002,"Do you have anything further, Mr. Sears?"
1978.77-6949,2,21491,daniel_j_sears,,3580.002,3585.427,"Mr. Chief Justice, if I may just have a few concluding remarks."
1978.77-6949,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3621.599,3625.11,Do you think the Government got what it bargained for?
1978.77-6949,2,21491,daniel_j_sears,,3625.11,3638.13,"Your Honor, I have to conceive that what Mr. Dunn did is repugnant to every moral obligation but I submit it was not a violation of Section 1623 and 1623 (c) was not a proper method of proof."
1978.77-6949,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3638.13,3645.147,"But he's still claiming all the benefits of that bargain, isn't it?"
1978.77-6949,2,21491,daniel_j_sears,,3645.147,3649.718,"Your Honor, he has a right to claim the benefits of that bargain and yes, he is."
1978.77-6949,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3649.718,3653.015,Without any adjustment in the price?
1978.77-6949,2,21491,daniel_j_sears,,3653.015,3656.952,"Your Honor, I submit the Government had its options available."
1978.77-6949,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3673.346,3680.349,Is there any right of the Government to rely on the witness's testimony that he will not recant it?
1978.77-6949,2,21491,daniel_j_sears,,3683.408,3684.739,"Absolutely, Your Honor."
1978.77-6949,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3685.443,3686.846,But you won't take that away?
1978.77-6949,2,21491,daniel_j_sears,,3686.846,3689.366,"No, Your Honor, that's not what we're asking."
1978.77-6949,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3699.533,3707.206,"And I hope so, it's just that the belief that he shall not recant."
1978.77-6949,2,21491,daniel_j_sears,,3707.206,3711.279,"Your Honor, I would submit that there would certainly be the hope."
1978.77-6949,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3711.279,3713.852,"Well, isn't that reason you put him under oath?"
1978.77-6949,2,21491,daniel_j_sears,,3713.852,3714.035,Yes.
1978.77-6949,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3714.035,3717.81,"So that if he does recant, --"
1978.77-6949,2,21491,daniel_j_sears,,3717.81,3720.034,"Well, Your Honor, if he recants --"
