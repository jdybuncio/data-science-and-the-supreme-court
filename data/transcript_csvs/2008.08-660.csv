2008.08-660,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.504,"We will hear argument next in Case 08-660, United States, ex rel. Eisenstein v. the City of New York."
2008.08-660,0,26044,gideon_a_schor,,8.387,16.36,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: For two main reasons, the Second Circuit's judgment should be reversed."
2008.08-660,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,43.427,44.529,Why at the start?
2008.08-660,0,26044,gideon_a_schor,,78.814,94.009,"--It will be quite difficult and burdensome, even upon entry of judgment, for a relator or a defendant to determine whether the government's participation was sufficiently active to make the government a party for purpose--"
2008.08-660,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,94.009,96.209,"But we hear the government did nothing, not one thing."
2008.08-660,0,26044,gideon_a_schor,,96.209,106.066,"--Well, under the -- under the active participation test, that may be."
2008.08-660,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,112.303,120.124,"The test is -- I don't know what you mean by ""active participation"" as opposed to just plain participation."
2008.08-660,0,26044,gideon_a_schor,,142.573,154.796,"In -- well, to address Your Honor's first point, the Second Circuit's test was participation."
2008.08-660,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,175.71,187.232,"So that's the question, whether that's enough or whether the government's power to prevent discovery, which it can do, is that alone enough?"
2008.08-660,0,26044,gideon_a_schor,,187.232,190.183,"--Well, our position is that the test is the wrong test."
2008.08-660,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,190.885,191.702,I understand that.
2008.08-660,0,26044,gideon_a_schor,,211.383,217.37,--And I think it will be a very difficult determination for the relator or the defendant for several reasons.
2008.08-660,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,284.062,287.43,You wouldn't have to -- you wouldn't have to do anything like that at all.
2008.08-660,0,26044,gideon_a_schor,,299.255,303.874,"Respectfully, I think that might read out of the rules the 60-day period."
2008.08-660,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,319.216,329.924,"And -- and if the inquiry says it's hard to tell, there's a 30-day limit and there's a 60 day limit, I don't know of any responsible counsel who wouldn't file within 30 days."
2008.08-660,0,26044,gideon_a_schor,,329.924,335.495,"--If that's the position, then that will read out of the rules the 60-day period."
2008.08-660,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,337.447,345.517,"Why would that -- why would it -- I mean, it would still apply to the government or any case in which the government is a party, where it's not an issue whether is the government a party or not."
2008.08-660,0,26044,gideon_a_schor,,345.517,365.114,"If it becomes too difficult to determine whether the government is a party, then it -- then it would be very hard to imagine the relator or the defendant who will feel able to invoke the 60-day provision, and that would effectively make it a dead letter--"
2008.08-660,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,365.114,376.405,"Oh, no, no, no, I agree with you that it -- I'm just saying why in a world would the relator want to invoke the 60-day provision if there's at all -- at all a question about whether it's 30 days or 60 days?"
2008.08-660,0,26044,gideon_a_schor,,376.405,389.713,--It's -- it's the case that people read the rules and see there's a -- there are 30 days if the government's not a party and 60 days if the government is a party.
2008.08-660,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,395.033,396.568,Is there any advantage?
2008.08-660,0,26044,gideon_a_schor,,433.591,455.421,"--If we're talking about relator's counsel, sometimes in a declined qui tam action the relator's counsel may wait to determine, may want to know whether the government will be filing any sort of amicus brief on appeal before determining whether we'll go ahead with the appeal."
2008.08-660,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,462.694,474.501,How would the -- how would you know at the time of filing of the notice of appeal whether the government is thereafter going to file an amicus brief?
2008.08-660,0,26044,gideon_a_schor,,474.501,477.351,--Relator's counsel is frequently in touch with government counsel.
2008.08-660,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,498.283,503.669,"So -- yes, but -- you don't have to know that before you file the one-page notice of appeal."
2008.08-660,0,26044,gideon_a_schor,,513.293,515.11,That's -- that's true.
2008.08-660,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,515.11,519.713,"And if it turns out the government is not going to come in, you can always dismiss the appeal."
2008.08-660,0,26044,gideon_a_schor,,519.713,521.513,That is true.
2008.08-660,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,540.21,547.531,"Well, anyway, a rule's a rule and discussing all of these consequences is beside the point."
2008.08-660,0,26044,gideon_a_schor,,552.252,552.968,Correct.
2008.08-660,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,552.968,561.906,"And is -- is it your position that the government is a party to this case for all purposes, for all purposes of all the rules, or is it just some of them?"
2008.08-660,0,26044,gideon_a_schor,,561.906,566.958,"No, we are not arguing that the government is a party only for some purposes and not others."
2008.08-660,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,571.512,575.314,"As opposed to the government's view, which does sort of pick and choose between--"
2008.08-660,0,26044,gideon_a_schor,,575.314,577.166,"Correct, and Respondents' as well."
2008.08-660,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,615.374,620.76,The government is not saying it doesn't need the 60 days.
2008.08-660,0,26044,gideon_a_schor,,631.568,639.823,"Well, the rule is that if the government gets 60 days everybody gets 60 days, even private parties like the relator."
2008.08-660,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,746.99,752.577,So there may be -- there may be a lot of reasons the relator will not pursue an appeal.
2008.08-660,0,26044,gideon_a_schor,,763.751,778.511,"It -- it may be, but I believe that if Rule 4(a)(1)(B) creates a 60-day period, then the litigants have an entitlement to invoke it."
2008.08-660,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,778.511,795.786,"--Well, your argument goes -- is replying to the government the Respondent's argument that there is no sense in giving 60 days to the government, and what you're saying is, yes, sometimes there is."
2008.08-660,0,26044,gideon_a_schor,,795.786,796.305,Correct.
2008.08-660,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,796.305,798.688,Even when the government has not actively participated.
2008.08-660,0,26044,gideon_a_schor,,827.439,828.624,"That's correct, and--"
2008.08-660,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,828.624,833.993,Can the government appeal without having intervened in the district court?
2008.08-660,0,26044,gideon_a_schor,,833.993,839.694,"--Since the government is bound by the judgment, I believe that the government does have that right."
2008.08-660,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,853.287,855.072,I'm sure the government will agree with that.
2008.08-660,0,26044,gideon_a_schor,,859.691,863.06,"--Yes, I think that's right, although they can speak for themselves."
2008.08-660,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,906.422,913.242,But there are some provisions that -- that seem to indicate the government isn't a party.
2008.08-660,0,26044,gideon_a_schor,,926.216,929.268,The government has to make requests.
2008.08-660,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,929.268,931.37,"Well, why would it have to do that if it's a party?"
2008.08-660,0,26044,gideon_a_schor,,931.37,934.905,The--
2008.08-660,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,934.905,945.944,"So you're -- I mean, you're saying they are not a party for that rule at least, that requires the pleadings to be served upon the other party."
2008.08-660,0,26044,gideon_a_schor,,945.944,946.463,--No.
2008.08-660,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,974.144,974.527,Right.
2008.08-660,0,26044,gideon_a_schor,,974.527,976.946,--Congress restricted that right in the False Claims Act.
2008.08-660,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,982.833,984.202,I'm not following you.
2008.08-660,0,26044,gideon_a_schor,,1006.698,1017.673,"--The fact that ordinarily a party might get served with certain pleadings doesn't mean that if Congress restricts that right, it's not a party."
2008.08-660,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1022.292,1031.766,"Do you think that everyone -- you are relying on the government, that the government is in the caption and it's a real party in interest."
2008.08-660,0,26044,gideon_a_schor,,1038.586,1040.288,"--No, we are not arguing that."
2008.08-660,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1068.523,1071.408,Can I come back to the Rule 5 point just for a minute?
2008.08-660,0,26044,gideon_a_schor,,1105.261,1106.278,It does read that way.
2008.08-660,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1113.598,1116.134,"Well, that's what we are down here, you know."
2008.08-660,0,26044,gideon_a_schor,,1117.634,1122.454,"--It may be, but not every drafting of a statute rises to that level of--"
2008.08-660,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1122.454,1124.406,Precision.
2008.08-660,0,26044,gideon_a_schor,,1124.406,1125.023,--of quality.
2008.08-660,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1294.033,1301.703,There is something odd about -- plaintiffs come to the court seeking something.
2008.08-660,0,26044,gideon_a_schor,,1321.433,1336.443,"I -- I don't think it's accurate to say that the government is an involuntary plaintiff, because Congress has said the United States will be a plaintiff under these circumstances and -- and in that respect Congress has spoken for the United States."
2008.08-660,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1371.866,1373.633,May be for other purposes?
2008.08-660,0,26044,gideon_a_schor,,1377.853,1378.32,"--Yes, it is."
2008.08-660,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1378.32,1378.82,Okay.
2008.08-660,0,26044,gideon_a_schor,,1380.889,1381.505,Yes.
2008.08-660,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1383.674,1387.393,It's not really a party for all purposes in your submission.
2008.08-660,0,26044,gideon_a_schor,,1390.495,1395.664,--In -- in our argument it is a party even though it is not subject to discovery.
2008.08-660,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1435.105,1436.391,Where is that?
2008.08-660,0,26044,gideon_a_schor,,1439.259,1440.809,"The declination provision, Your Honor?"
2008.08-660,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1440.809,1441.393,Yes.
2008.08-660,0,26044,gideon_a_schor,,1449.965,1451.067,"No, that's all right."
2008.08-660,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1451.067,1461.173,"I mean, where is it in the stuff that I have?"
2008.08-660,0,26044,gideon_a_schor,,1461.173,1462.523,Oh.
2008.08-660,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1500.465,1503.084,"Yes, but that doesn't say anything about discovery in particular."
2008.08-660,0,26044,gideon_a_schor,,1511.44,1520.378,"Well, footnote 27 of our brief also cites other provisions of the act that -- that define what it means ""to conduct the action""."
2008.08-660,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1546.813,1558.17,"And -- and the fact that it cannot conduct discovery also involves the fact that it's immune from discovery, how do you get that?"
2008.08-660,0,26044,gideon_a_schor,,1560.253,1563.972,"Yes, that's our position, and I think that's the government's position as well."
2008.08-660,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1563.972,1565.424,"Oh, I'm sure it's the government's position."
2008.08-660,0,26044,gideon_a_schor,,1565.424,1566.124,It would be--
2008.08-660,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1566.124,1568.692,But how can that -- how can that be if it's a party?
2008.08-660,0,26044,gideon_a_schor,,1568.692,1578.834,--If -- it's a party who is because of the declination provision not subject to discovery.
2008.08-660,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1578.834,1581.067,The declination provision doesn't say that.
2008.08-660,0,26044,gideon_a_schor,,1588.273,1599.663,"Because the declination provision says that if the government declines, then it will not conduct the action; The relator will conduct the action."
2008.08-660,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1616.59,1625.01,"I agree with that, but -- but it's -- it's for me a problem with your assertion that for all purposes the government is a party."
2008.08-660,0,26044,gideon_a_schor,,1634.385,1639.753,"--There is -- it's an inference drawn from the statute, Your Honor."
2008.08-660,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1648.942,1649.727,"Thank you, counsel."
2008.08-660,1,38285,paul_t_rephen,,1653.013,1663.119,"Mr. Chief Justice, and members of the Court: When the government declines to intervene in a qui tam action, it should not be deemed a party for purposes of the Rules of Procedure Rule 4."
2008.08-660,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1678.913,1683.282,"This is certainly a trap for the unaware, right?"
2008.08-660,1,38285,paul_t_rephen,,1686.15,1687.786,I don't think this is a trap for the unwary.
2008.08-660,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1688.969,1693.221,"--It says if the United States is a party, it is -- it is 60; if it's not, it's 30."
2008.08-660,1,38285,paul_t_rephen,,1697.292,1698.892,--It is brought in the name of the United States.
2008.08-660,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1710.283,1715.918,"I know, but this is such a -- such a trap for the unwary that you never even raise this point."
2008.08-660,1,38285,paul_t_rephen,,1718.353,1719.436,--And rejected.
2008.08-660,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1721.804,1729.141,"Well, my point is if it didn't occur to you, how can you claim that it should definitely have occurred to your friend on the other side?"
2008.08-660,1,38285,paul_t_rephen,,1729.141,1731.057,--I don't know that it didn't occur to us.
2008.08-660,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1741.699,1746.234,May I ask this question about: Are there a number of circuits that follow the 60-day rule?
2008.08-660,1,38285,paul_t_rephen,,1746.234,1746.853,Yes.
2008.08-660,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1746.853,1750.388,"And in those cases, suppose we decide your way in this case."
2008.08-660,1,38285,paul_t_rephen,,1759.827,1761.779,I think those appeals will be terminated.
2008.08-660,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1761.779,1763.362,All of those would be terminated?
2008.08-660,1,38285,paul_t_rephen,,1763.362,1763.845,Yes.
2008.08-660,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1763.845,1766.73,And what about judgments that have been entered based on appeals that were--
2008.08-660,1,38285,paul_t_rephen,,1766.73,1767.599,I don't know.
2008.08-660,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1770.634,1776.372,"--So we are really -- in several circuits, a really rather important decision is being called for?"
2008.08-660,1,38285,paul_t_rephen,,1776.372,1777.355,"--Yes, yes."
2008.08-660,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1777.355,1779.49,Why would the judgment have to be vacated?
2008.08-660,1,38285,paul_t_rephen,,1788.596,1790.196,"That is true, Your Honor, correct, yes."
2008.08-660,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1790.196,1797.952,--So even the jurisdictional base can be precluded and not raised on collateral attack.
2008.08-660,1,38285,paul_t_rephen,,1797.952,1799.669,"You are correct, Your Honor."
2008.08-660,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1849.234,1869.715,"Except that the government here has considerable powers even without intervening, and they include its ability to move to stay discovery, which normally a party would only be able to do."
2008.08-660,1,38285,paul_t_rephen,,1877.488,1878.304,There are certain--
2008.08-660,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1878.304,1883.725,And some courts have allowed the government to move to dismiss.
2008.08-660,1,38285,paul_t_rephen,,1883.725,1888.628,"--There is certainly a limited role here, but it is a very limited role."

2008.08-660,1,38285,paul_t_rephen,,1925.985,1931.205,"What we're saying is certainly it is not a party in this case, where it has quite absolutely no role."
2008.08-660,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1931.205,1932.555,You are saying that.
2008.08-660,1,38285,paul_t_rephen,,1932.555,1933.174,There may be--
2008.08-660,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1933.174,1937.026,"But you're also saying as for the rest, sometimes it is, sometimes it isn't."
2008.08-660,1,38285,paul_t_rephen,,1937.026,1938.811,--There may -- there may be circumstances.
2008.08-660,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1947.584,1948.6,How about -- I'm sorry.
2008.08-660,1,38285,paul_t_rephen,,1949.65,1951.202,--We're not taking a formal position on that.
2008.08-660,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1952.502,1962.058,"Counsel, how does it work in -- presumably, I guess the government can decide that it wants to appeal the case in which it has not participated below, right?"
2008.08-660,1,38285,paul_t_rephen,,1962.058,1963.51,--It would have to move to intervene.
2008.08-660,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1963.51,1964.394,It has to move to intervene.
2008.08-660,1,38285,paul_t_rephen,,1982.221,1985.507,"I think we would take the position there is no longer a case, Your Honor."
2008.08-660,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2009.99,2017.994,"So for all the reasons in the legislative history that you discussed about why the government gets more time, those reasons don't apply in that situation?"
2008.08-660,1,38285,paul_t_rephen,,2017.994,2022.215,"It doesn't apply if there is no longer a case, and if 30 days has gone by, there would be no longer a case."

2008.08-660,1,38285,paul_t_rephen,,2053.234,2053.853,Yes.
2008.08-660,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2056.669,2057.721,"No, because they didn't expect--"
2008.08-660,1,38285,paul_t_rephen,,2057.721,2058.488,Rule 4--
2008.08-660,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2058.488,2062.792,"--The judge did -- the judge did a surprising thing, which judges sometimes do."
2008.08-660,1,38285,paul_t_rephen,,2062.792,2065.509,"--Well, the government -- the government is given that opportunity to monitor the case."
2008.08-660,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2069.113,2071.346,Would this be a solution which wouldn't help you?
2008.08-660,1,38285,paul_t_rephen,,2093.425,2094.509,--That's right.
2008.08-660,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2094.509,2095.294,--And it -- all right.
2008.08-660,1,38285,paul_t_rephen,,2098.079,2100.163,The rules give 60 days to the government when it's a party.

2008.08-660,1,38285,paul_t_rephen,,2117.506,2118.441,--I think the rules--
2008.08-660,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2118.441,2119.558,Right?
2008.08-660,1,38285,paul_t_rephen,,2119.558,2122.308,"--Well, we rely on it because that was what Congress said."
2008.08-660,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2124.693,2131.366,"The original statute or the earlier statute did not use the word ""intervention""."
2008.08-660,1,38285,paul_t_rephen,,2131.366,2133.566,--But we used it in a number--
2008.08-660,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2133.566,2134.9,I forget the different word it used?
2008.08-660,1,38285,paul_t_rephen,,2134.9,2135.85,"--""Appearance"", maybe."
2008.08-660,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2135.85,2136.6,Appearance?
2008.08-660,1,38285,paul_t_rephen,,2136.6,2137.352,Is appearance.
2008.08-660,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2161.967,2167.602,"Well, I really wonder whether they didn't intend the same -- the same result."
2008.08-660,1,38285,paul_t_rephen,,2174.108,2174.524,Our argument was--
2008.08-660,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2174.524,2176.191,--The government would have been a party?
2008.08-660,1,38285,paul_t_rephen,,2176.191,2176.824,--I wouldn't--
2008.08-660,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2176.824,2178.06,Because you can be a party and not appear.
2008.08-660,1,38285,paul_t_rephen,,2178.06,2179.243,"--I wouldn't say that, Your Honor."
2008.08-660,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2202.341,2208.328,"Counsel, I -- I pressed your friend about what's the big deal, why don't you just file within 30."
2008.08-660,1,38285,paul_t_rephen,,2214.03,2214.648,The big -- I think--
2008.08-660,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2214.648,2217.6,--which also solves the problem of the potential trap for the unwary.
2008.08-660,1,38285,paul_t_rephen,,2217.6,2223.754,--I think the big deal is that it can open more questions that it resolves if you give the government party status for this purpose.
2008.08-660,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2223.754,2224.37,"Well, I agree with that."
2008.08-660,1,38285,paul_t_rephen,,2225.92,2227.42,"And I think Your Honor, I think that, Chief Justice--"
2008.08-660,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2227.42,2227.92,--I'm sorry.
2008.08-660,1,38285,paul_t_rephen,,2241.411,2249.767,--I think the purpose of Rule 4 was to give the government time to make a decision when it's actually a party and it has a right to appeal.
2008.08-660,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2258.522,2259.724,"--Well, it should be construed narrowly."
2008.08-660,1,38285,paul_t_rephen,,2264.426,2273.465,"--Well, if -- if the rule provides that the government should have 60 days when it is a party and it's not a party, then it seems to me it's a bit more--"
2008.08-660,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2273.465,2278.269,"Well, yeah, but I mean, if we assume you're right, then that's construing it narrowly."
2008.08-660,1,38285,paul_t_rephen,,2293.112,2302.134,"--But I think it wouldn't be consistent with the intent of Congress or the intent of the rule, which is to move appeals along really within 30 days."
2008.08-660,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2306.519,2308.938,"Oh, this isn't going to delay appeals, for heaven's sakes."
2008.08-660,1,38285,paul_t_rephen,,2318.077,2334.356,"--Then I would tell Your Honor, you know, whether or not you want to give somebody a break on that, it is simply inconsistent with the rule, which requires the United States to be a party when they have, as in this case, played absolutely no role; and they are clearly not a party."
2008.08-660,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2359.488,2361.09,The other side acknowledges that.
2008.08-660,1,38285,paul_t_rephen,,2367.41,2367.826,--I--
2008.08-660,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2367.826,2370.612,"--and these things are styled ""United States""."
2008.08-660,1,38285,paul_t_rephen,,2370.612,2376.599,"--Your Honor, I don't think it's an accumulation of all of these bits of real party in interest."
2008.08-660,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2379.55,2380.2,"No, no, no."
2008.08-660,1,38285,paul_t_rephen,,2387.371,2389.073,--I think the naming -- the naming--
2008.08-660,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2389.073,2390.006,--You're normally a party.
2008.08-660,1,38285,paul_t_rephen,,2390.006,2391.275,--The naming is nominal.
2008.08-660,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2426.429,2432.768,"But there are certain things the government can do, you concede, without intervening?"
2008.08-660,1,38285,paul_t_rephen,,2432.768,2435.554,"Yes, there are certain limited roles."
2008.08-660,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2439.672,2451.48,"If the government did decide to take over, the qui tam plaintiff would remain a party--"
2008.08-660,1,38285,paul_t_rephen,,2451.48,2454.932,But the government would have primary responsibility under the statute.
2008.08-660,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2454.932,2457.717,--So why shouldn't it work the other way?
2008.08-660,1,38285,paul_t_rephen,,2471.191,2477.095,"Yes, I think the standard is intervention, and absent intervention by the United States, it should not be a party."
2008.08-660,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2477.095,2478.561,Except the United States has a lot of power.
2008.08-660,1,38285,paul_t_rephen,,2498.092,2502.21,"No, we would accept -- if it has to be a bright line, we would accept intervention."
2008.08-660,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2508.197,2510.315,"--Well, do you want a bright line or not a bright line?"
2008.08-660,1,38285,paul_t_rephen,,2510.315,2511.165,--I would -- we would--
2008.08-660,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2511.165,2511.949,Do you agree with the government?
2008.08-660,1,38285,paul_t_rephen,,2511.949,2513.601,--We would live with a bright line certainly.
2008.08-660,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2513.601,2521.957,Do you agree with the government's presentation that it becomes a party when it reaches a certain ineffable degree of activity in the case?
2008.08-660,1,38285,paul_t_rephen,,2522.473,2523.19,I don't know if it's ineffable.
2008.08-660,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2548.857,2550.107,I don't think they were relying on Devlin.
2008.08-660,1,38285,paul_t_rephen,,2551.226,2552.592,--They were relying--
2008.08-660,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2552.592,2553.426,--The point they are making here--
2008.08-660,1,38285,paul_t_rephen,,2553.426,2554.261,--They were addressing--
2008.08-660,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2554.261,2557.213,--is not that we're a party for some purposes and not for others.
2008.08-660,1,38285,paul_t_rephen,,2563.2,2566.569,--I don't think the government is saying they're a party for all purposes which is a--
2008.08-660,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2566.569,2567.252,I think they were.
2008.08-660,1,38285,paul_t_rephen,,2567.252,2567.786,--of activity.
2008.08-660,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2567.786,2570.104,We disagree on that.
2008.08-660,1,38285,paul_t_rephen,,2570.104,2571.89,I guess we'll hear from them shortly.
2008.08-660,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2571.89,2572.523,We'll hear from them.
2008.08-660,1,38285,paul_t_rephen,,2572.523,2577.608,"If there are no further questions, then we can -- we can hear from the government."
2008.08-660,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2577.608,2578.46,"Thank you, counsel."
2008.08-660,2,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2596.671,2598.54,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
2008.08-660,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2598.54,2600.107,"I have a question for you, Mr. Wall."
2008.08-660,2,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2600.84,2602.659,--I thought you might.
2008.08-660,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2602.659,2606.211,What is the government's position on that point?
2008.08-660,2,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2606.211,2611.598,I actually wanted to start exactly where you and Justice Ginsburg began because I think we've gotten off a little bit on the wrong track.
2008.08-660,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2654.425,2660.246,"Do you take the position that without intervention though, nonetheless the government could appeal at the -- at the tail end?"
2008.08-660,2,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2660.246,2661.562,"No, we do not think--"
2008.08-660,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2661.562,2662.396,You don't think that -- okay.
2008.08-660,2,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2662.396,2668.0,"--that the government could have appealed the judgment here as of right, and that is why we think the purposes of the 60-day period were not implicated."
2008.08-660,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2678.873,2684.944,Doesn't it need the 60 days to figure out whether it would want to intervene in order to be able to appeal?
2008.08-660,2,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2684.944,2694.716,"--Justice Scalia, I think that would be equally true in a number of contexts -- for instance, class action settlements where the government is entitled to notice, presumably so that it can intervene; government contractor suits."
2008.08-660,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2701.704,2708.643,But they are not statutes which give the government an extended period of time in order to allow the consultation.
2008.08-660,2,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2731.006,2735.96,"Well, Justice Scalia, with all respect, the False Claims Act itself doesn't say anything about intervention."
2008.08-660,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2785.393,2787.893,What -- why do you care?
2008.08-660,2,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2793.297,2796.099,"I think there are two distinct harms, Mr. Chief Justice."
2008.08-660,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2810.758,2822.566,"Okay, but, again, we would limit any decision to Federal Rule of Appeal 4 because of the dramatically adverse consequences for the unwary."
2008.08-660,2,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2825.018,2830.172,I don't think the government has any objection in theory to a period of 60 days for only FRAP 4.
2008.08-660,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2838.528,2839.578,"Well, I just does did."
2008.08-660,2,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2856.489,2857.522,That's right.
2008.08-660,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2880.438,2885.758,What about the relators and the parties in the four circuits that have adopted the 60-day rule.
2008.08-660,2,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2890.843,2898.066,"--Well, I think they also were on notice that there's a long-standing circuit split on this question which the court has never answered."
2008.08-660,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2909.291,2922.264,"I'm sure that the Appellate Rules Advisory Committee, when they hear this decision, if they haven't already, will put something in the rules about whether it's 30 days or 60 days."
2008.08-660,2,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2935.522,2936.108,"Right, and--"
2008.08-660,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2936.108,2942.595,"So it's just a question of -- in this case and, as Justice Stevens pointed out, what the effect is going to be on other cases."
2008.08-660,2,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2952.284,2954.986,"--Well, and that goes to a question that Justice Breyer asked earlier."
2008.08-660,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3020.012,3022.547,But it is -- it is a potential appellant.
2008.08-660,2,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,3042.46,3050.697,"I guess -- and I -- the same answer I gave earlier, Justice Scalia: That's equally true virtually in any Federal case that might affect the United States's interests--"
2008.08-660,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3050.697,3062.921,"I understand, but this -- this goes to your argument about congressional intent: That they were concerned about preserving to the government time as a potential appellant to think the matter over."
2008.08-660,2,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,3065.54,3072.961,"--But I think it goes back to what Justice Ginsburg asked much earlier, which is: At the time the judgment is entered, who is a party entitled to take the appeal?"
2008.08-660,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3081.317,3083.752,Can the United States intervene within those 30 days--
2008.08-660,2,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,3083.752,3084.719,--It can intervene.
2008.08-660,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3084.719,3085.402,--and then appeal?
2008.08-660,2,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,3085.402,3086.069,Yes.
2008.08-660,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3086.069,3087.553,I think it's a potential appellant.
2008.08-660,2,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,3087.553,3093.357,"Well, it is -- yes, and it is -- it is equally true that it is a potential appellant then in any case that might affect its interests."
2008.08-660,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3177.009,3178.194,"Thank you, Mr. Wall."
2008.08-660,3,26044,gideon_a_schor,,3181.896,3182.563,Thank you.
2008.08-660,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3213.284,3215.903,Why isn't it also a party under all these other rules?
2008.08-660,3,26044,gideon_a_schor,,3215.903,3220.521,--We -- we -- our position is that it -- that it is a party.
2008.08-660,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3220.521,3222.14,Under all of the rules of discovery?
2008.08-660,3,26044,gideon_a_schor,,3222.14,3236.4,"Well, again, we think it's a party although for other reasons in the statute that it's not subject to full party discovery because of the declination provision, which I discussed in -- in the opening."
2008.08-660,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3291.451,3299.556,"What do you -- what do you say to the government's argument that they -- it -- it may close these doors that -- that you're saying, but it opens a lot of others under other rules?"
2008.08-660,3,26044,gideon_a_schor,,3311.898,3312.681,I don't think it does.
2008.08-660,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3326.291,3330.326,"That's -- that's true, but that's not the point that Justice Souter was making."
2008.08-660,3,26044,gideon_a_schor,,3350.256,3366.099,"Well, I think their concern is that -- is discovery primarily, and we have certainly put plenty of arguments in our brief as to why that concern is -- is less and there is certainly plenty of authority for -- for thinking that the government won't be subject to discovery."
2008.08-660,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3366.099,3367.201,"Thank you, counsel."
