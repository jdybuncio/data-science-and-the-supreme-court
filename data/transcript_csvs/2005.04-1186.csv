2005.04-1186,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,5.282,We'll hear argument next in Wachovia Bank v. Schmidt.
2005.04-1186,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,6.242,8.747,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
2005.04-1186,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,40.476,44.591,"Now, that was enacted, was it not, in 1887?"
2005.04-1186,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,44.591,45.935,--That's correct.
2005.04-1186,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,46.618,49.373,And hasn't the... the word hasn't changed--
2005.04-1186,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,49.373,49.906,--It hasn't changed.
2005.04-1186,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,49.906,50.65,--in all those years.
2005.04-1186,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,57.27,58.781,I'm... I'm not aware of any.
2005.04-1186,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,65.501,69.367,So it's a little hard to look for congressional intent.
2005.04-1186,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,69.367,76.67,"Well, it... it... I don't believe it is, Your Honor, because of the sequence of statutes."
2005.04-1186,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,119.529,121.373,The Congress makes mistakes sometimes.
2005.04-1186,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,121.373,123.561,"Yes, they... they might have... they might have done that."
2005.04-1186,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,313.716,323.557,"Counsel, a... a national bank charter typically lists the national bank's principal place of business."
2005.04-1186,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,323.968,324.418,"--Well, it lists--"
2005.04-1186,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,324.418,324.684,Its main office.
2005.04-1186,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,324.684,327.939,"--it lists the... the charter location, where it's established."
2005.04-1186,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,333.748,337.536,But isn't that amended if the principal place of business changes?
2005.04-1186,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,338.046,348.188,"You can... just like a corporation could reincorporate in another State, a bank could move its main office, which I think is the term that's used in 12 U.S.C., section 30."
2005.04-1186,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,348.188,354.314,So this would put national banks in a favored position compared to corporations--
2005.04-1186,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,354.314,354.58,No.
2005.04-1186,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,354.58,361.117,--which are citizens of their State of incorporation and their... their principal place of business.
2005.04-1186,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,361.117,372.12,"Well, if there's... I don't know whether there's a divergence between principal place of business and... and main office, which is what the Comptroller, I think, considers the equivalent of the place of incorporation."
2005.04-1186,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,382.461,383.705,My point is just--
2005.04-1186,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,383.705,388.847,"--A corporation was not a citizen of... of its principal place of business, only of its State of incorporation."
2005.04-1186,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,394.818,404.226,--A good bit of your argument is that your friend's interpretation on the other side would put national banks in a disfavored position.
2005.04-1186,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,404.226,404.576,Yes.
2005.04-1186,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,404.576,407.93,Your argument would put them in a favored position compared to a typical corporation.
2005.04-1186,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,407.93,408.858,"Well, not necessarily."
2005.04-1186,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,424.558,427.246,"Well, what would... what would be your view?"
2005.04-1186,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,433.372,435.466,--Our... our view is that it's the main office.
2005.04-1186,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,461.435,470.243,"Mr. Frey, in practice, is there, as there often is for a corporation, a divergence between those two places?"
2005.04-1186,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,488.382,502.072,"It's possible that there would be for some banks, but the main office is the place that... that the Comptroller that... that is in their articles of association, which can be amended to change the main office, and it's approved by the Comptroller of the Currency."
2005.04-1186,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,516.368,519.383,You... you would say that the main office is the place where they're established.
2005.04-1186,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,520.809,521.36,No.
2005.04-1186,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,531.729,550.218,"Well, I... I think we need to go there, at least... it seems strange to me that you have two different words and if, indeed, established means the same thing that you're telling us located means, I'm not going to agree with you."
2005.04-1186,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,553.5,562.892,"--Well, established could, I suppose, mean the place of the original charter location, and located could mean the place where... where the main office is today."
2005.04-1186,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,659.152,660.496,Or an ATM.
2005.04-1186,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,660.496,662.34,What about where it has an ATM.
2005.04-1186,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,662.34,666.622,"--Well, there I think the Fourth Circuit said we... we had a case that resolved that."
2005.04-1186,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,666.622,668.726,Excuse me?
2005.04-1186,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,668.726,675.213,"I think the Fourth Circuit said that we had a case that... that answered that question, not a case involving this particular provision--"
2005.04-1186,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,675.213,675.596,I don't... I don't recall.
2005.04-1186,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,675.596,677.44,--but a case involving another provision of... of the banking laws.
2005.04-1186,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,677.44,678.784,I don't recall that.
2005.04-1186,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,702.893,706.081,"Mr. Frey, remind me of the State bank."
2005.04-1186,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,714.739,716.85,It depends on how it does business.
2005.04-1186,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,719.271,720.115,So it would be the--
2005.04-1186,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,720.115,720.798,--the same as any corporation.
2005.04-1186,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,720.798,722.142,--its place of incorporation and--
2005.04-1186,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,722.142,722.192,Same as any corporation.
2005.04-1186,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,722.192,724.719,--principal place of business if it's different.
2005.04-1186,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,724.719,739.236,"So in 1958, under... if... if you follow the Chief Justice's question, in 1958 when it became possible for corporations to be citizens of more than one State, maybe the meaning of this statute that was passed in 1948 changed."
2005.04-1186,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,776.454,785.101,"Well, but you're... you're asking us to interpret a statute that they passed in light of events subsequent to the passage of the statute."
2005.04-1186,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,785.101,785.528,--No.
2005.04-1186,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,785.528,789.394,"You're saying that when they passed it, national banks were only in one place."
2005.04-1186,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,792.082,792.315,That's true.
2005.04-1186,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,792.315,793.759,--even if you adopt the reading of the Fourth Circuit.
2005.04-1186,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,793.759,802.573,"Well, let me... let's... let's go back and... because Justice O'Connor started me off, and I... I don't want to fail to get to her question."
2005.04-1186,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,934.195,949.929,"And you think a lawyer has to go back, in order to advise a client, and... and when he has a word... two words in... in a provision... one, established; the other, located... he has to go back and figure out every one of these reenactments and inquire into, you know, what Congress meant at the time?"
2005.04-1186,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,949.929,951.523,"Well, I don't think it's so difficult to--"
2005.04-1186,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,951.523,962.708,"He... he has... he has a statute that says established in one part, located in another, and he has a Supreme Court case, which I mentioned, but you apparently disregard, which is Bougas, which--"
2005.04-1186,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,962.708,963.141,--I don't disregard it.
2005.04-1186,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,963.141,967.402,"--Well, which... when I asked about it, you... you drew a blank."
2005.04-1186,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,991.383,991.677,Well--
2005.04-1186,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,991.677,997.303,"--says where you have established and located in... in the same provision, located means where they have a branch."
2005.04-1186,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,997.303,999.397,"--Well, it didn't say that established meant something different."
2005.04-1186,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1023.851,1024.233,That may well be.
2005.04-1186,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1024.233,1025.778,What the Fourth Circuit has done is destroy--
2005.04-1186,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1025.778,1042.257,"And... and whatever... whatever the outcome, whether it was equality or nonequality, and whatever the rationale, whether it was the purpose to be served or something else, the Court held that the word located in a banking statute which had both the words established and located in it--"
2005.04-1186,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1042.257,1042.257,--But--
2005.04-1186,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1042.257,1045.028,--meant where they have a branch.
2005.04-1186,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1048.966,1049.143,--I think--
2005.04-1186,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1049.143,1051.748,--who's trying to figure out how to advise his client.
2005.04-1186,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1051.748,1062.667,"In a venue statute, as opposed to a subject matter jurisdiction statute, the venue means where, where... what particular court."
2005.04-1186,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1068.793,1072.147,--Entirely different things and entirely different concerns.
2005.04-1186,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1094.413,1095.174,"Thank you, counsel."
2005.04-1186,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1102.16,1110.891,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
2005.04-1186,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1125.659,1129.108,What about its principal place of business if it's different from its main office?
2005.04-1186,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1129.108,1130.369,The--
2005.04-1186,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1130.369,1132.229,Principal place of business.
2005.04-1186,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1132.229,1142.371,"--We... we don't think that a national banking association is a citizen of a State in which its principal place of business is found, insofar as that might be different from the State in which its main office is located."
2005.04-1186,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1142.371,1146.83,"So the main office is it, like 1332 before the '58 amendment."
2005.04-1186,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1146.83,1150.269,"That's right, Justice Ginsburg, and in part, that's because of the historical chronology."
2005.04-1186,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1174.972,1176.316,What did the Government argue in Bougas?
2005.04-1186,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1180.431,1180.814,No.
2005.04-1186,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1234.776,1238.142,"In Bougas, they were there to... they were put in originally in the original drafting."
2005.04-1186,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1239.158,1240.83,"Just about, Justice Souter."
2005.04-1186,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1258.303,1263.001,Could I... could I get your position again on exactly 1348?
2005.04-1186,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1266.7,1267.133,That's right.
2005.04-1186,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1267.133,1271.065,What about if that's different from the national bank charter?
2005.04-1186,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1271.065,1274.514,It would still be the main office.
2005.04-1186,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1295.279,1297.189,Even if its charter says something else.
2005.04-1186,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1297.189,1298.877,Even if its charter says something else.
2005.04-1186,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1298.877,1300.988,Because I gather you don't have to amend your charter.
2005.04-1186,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1300.988,1301.815,You don't.
2005.04-1186,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1312.818,1315.773,How... how do you tell where a bank's main office is?
2005.04-1186,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1315.773,1319.211,"Well, as I was saying, you'd have to amend the articles of association if you move to a different city."
2005.04-1186,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1330.313,1340.049,"So its main office would be... be where its articles of incorporation say, even if it has 90 percent of its branches in another State?"
2005.04-1186,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1340.049,1340.682,That's right.

2005.04-1186,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1620.63,1621.046,That's right.
2005.04-1186,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1645.289,1650.449,"--What... what do you mean that national banking associations are, after all, corporations?"
2005.04-1186,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1654.314,1654.464,--No.
2005.04-1186,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1667.828,1667.994,You mean--
2005.04-1186,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1667.994,1671.515,"--when it defined them as, quote, a body corporate, close quote."
2005.04-1186,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1674.703,1678.668,"--They're not incorporated... they're not incorporated under the laws of any State, though."
2005.04-1186,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1678.668,1683.35,"They're not incorporated under the laws of any State, but they're incorporated under... under the National Bank Act."
2005.04-1186,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1692.426,1694.853,But... I'm sorry.
2005.04-1186,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1715.78,1718.04,If I could just... just briefly.
2005.04-1186,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1718.04,1718.24,Yes.
2005.04-1186,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1718.24,1735.513,"I think what I'm trying to say is that federally... national banks are federally chartered corporations and they share the salient characteristics of a corporation, i.e., there's limited liability for shareholders... and that's at 12 U.S.C. 64(a)... and they have a perpetual existence in the same way that corporations do, and that's at 12 U.S.C. 24."
2005.04-1186,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1735.513,1740.639,But you did say 1332(c) does not apply to the national bank.
2005.04-1186,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1742.233,1756.101,"That... that's our view, but again, I'm... I wouldn't characterize it an... as an open and shut case because 1332(c) refers generally to corporations, and so one could reach the conclusion that 1332's reference to principal place of business should also apply to national banks."
2005.04-1186,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1756.101,1758.611,"Thank you, counsel."
2005.04-1186,2,30478,james_r_gilreath,,1763.254,1767.187,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
2005.04-1186,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1918.73,1921.418,Let me... let me raise the reality check question.
2005.04-1186,2,30478,james_r_gilreath,,1942.412,1951.32,"I don't think, when Congress enacted section 1448, that they even knew about branch banking."
2005.04-1186,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1964.678,1974.169,But the... I guess the problem is if... if we start with the assumption that I made a second ago that your reading is not a necessity... it's a possible reading.
2005.04-1186,2,30478,james_r_gilreath,,2004.999,2025.91,"--Well, that assumes that you want to give the... the... I'm not suggesting that you... you want to do this, but that... that a court would want to give the national banks what I say is a free ticket to the Federal courts, to the--"
2005.04-1186,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2025.91,2025.993,No.
2005.04-1186,2,30478,james_r_gilreath,,2049.842,2052.03,--I can't... I can't give you a reason for that.
2005.04-1186,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2079.411,2081.266,"Well, it... it says located."
2005.04-1186,2,30478,james_r_gilreath,,2089.429,2092.518,That's a good question.
2005.04-1186,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2098.654,2102.936,What... what about if we go back to 1880 or whatever and they had a messenger?
2005.04-1186,2,30478,james_r_gilreath,,2119.232,2125.108,--I'm... I'm not sure that even I could say that located goes quite that far.
2005.04-1186,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2128.99,2129.984,Couldn't have a messenger?
2005.04-1186,2,30478,james_r_gilreath,,2133.949,2135.032,--You make it to... I... I can't... I can't--
2005.04-1186,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2135.032,2137.487,The Pony Express.
2005.04-1186,2,30478,james_r_gilreath,,2137.487,2138.231,--with that point.
2005.04-1186,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2138.231,2141.085,You can have private delivery of mail.
2005.04-1186,2,30478,james_r_gilreath,,2157.714,2161.496,They've got a presence there and they're doing business there.
2005.04-1186,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2163.257,2168.55,May I ask you... call your attention to another word in the statute that seems persuasive to me?
2005.04-1186,2,30478,james_r_gilreath,,2185.023,2189.471,"That... that's the way I read it, and we... we discussed that in our brief, that... that word."
2005.04-1186,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2202.917,2209.037,"--They're talking about a plural banking associations, not just plural branches of one association."
2005.04-1186,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2222.728,2230.209,"Well, that... that would be true if it said the State in which they are... in which they are respectively located, but it does say of the States."
2005.04-1186,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2230.209,2232.386,That's what it does say the States in which they are respectively--
2005.04-1186,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2232.386,2234.407,"Yes, so each one could be in many States."
2005.04-1186,2,30478,james_r_gilreath,,2234.724,2242.305,"I read it, because it says States, that it's referring to more than one State in which they could be located."
2005.04-1186,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2242.305,2246.42,"--And of course, it refers to more than one State because it referred to even more than one national bank association."
2005.04-1186,2,30478,james_r_gilreath,,2256.079,2266.248,"I think what... what we said in our brief was that the word respectively is... is in there so that you are not talking about all the banks, but talking about each bank."
2005.04-1186,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2266.248,2266.664,Correct.
2005.04-1186,2,30478,james_r_gilreath,,2267.592,2271.707,If I could move on.
2005.04-1186,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2291.868,2295.139,But not with every State with which it has a close nexus.
2005.04-1186,2,30478,james_r_gilreath,,2295.139,2296.5,Right.
2005.04-1186,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2296.5,2305.308,"So, in other words, the partnership... we have a corporation where it's incorporated and Congress said a principal place of business."
2005.04-1186,2,30478,james_r_gilreath,,2341.763,2342.941,I don't know of any.
2005.04-1186,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2350.411,2351.005,--Its members.
2005.04-1186,2,30478,james_r_gilreath,,2351.005,2363.184,"But the point... the point I was making is that it... it doesn't necessarily have to be the same rule that it is for a corporation, and... and that... that's what this Court decided in the Carden case."
2005.04-1186,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2363.184,2389.638,"Yes, but the question that I asked you is, in the realm of subject matter jurisdiction, that is, which court system, Federal or State, as distinguished from where can I grab this person for personal jurisdiction purposes, what are my venue choices, is there any other example in all of title 28 where, for subject matter jurisdiction purposes, this... every place where it's located counts?"
2005.04-1186,2,30478,james_r_gilreath,,2389.638,2391.326,Not... not that I know of.
2005.04-1186,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2391.326,2399.99,Do we owe any degree of deference to the Comptroller's interpretation of the provision?
2005.04-1186,2,30478,james_r_gilreath,,2399.99,2412.503,There... there is some authority that I think is cited in their brief or somebody's brief that the Court should give deference to... to their interpretations.
2005.04-1186,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2424.355,2431.486,"This is not a matter of... of... over which the Comptroller has administrative responsibility, is it?"
2005.04-1186,2,30478,james_r_gilreath,,2446.359,2446.853,Well--
2005.04-1186,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2446.853,2459.449,"I mean, I... I guess he deals with these associations all the time, so we should... we should listen to him, but... but he... he is not authoritative as to... as to who comes into court, is he?"
2005.04-1186,2,30478,james_r_gilreath,,2459.449,2460.478,--No.
2005.04-1186,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2476.922,2489.612,"What do you do with their... their hypothetical in both your friend's brief and the Government's brief about Ford Motor Company, not in terms of 1332 but common parlance?"
2005.04-1186,2,30478,james_r_gilreath,,2505.07,2514.894,"You... you can make that argument, but it... it depends on, like you say, what... what do you mean when you ask that question."
2005.04-1186,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2571.087,2589.393,"But the... the argument here is... is in the context of deciding which citizen an entity is a citizen... which State an entity is a citizen of, we normally don't think that entities are citizens of multiple States."
2005.04-1186,2,30478,james_r_gilreath,,2620.139,2620.9,--I... I agree.
2005.04-1186,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2621.816,2625.515,So we should be looking for one State or maybe two States at most.
2005.04-1186,2,30478,james_r_gilreath,,2625.515,2647.947,"Well, we... I... I contend... I can understand why you say that, but if you read the... the statute the way it's worded and you... and you look at what's going on out there, I don't see any problem with this Court construing that they are a citizen of a State like South Carolina where they've got 179 branches."
2005.04-1186,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2680.454,2681.465,In South Carolina.
2005.04-1186,2,30478,james_r_gilreath,,2695.322,2696.832,--No.
2005.04-1186,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2725.14,2726.734,But it would still be in South Carolina.
2005.04-1186,2,30478,james_r_gilreath,,2726.734,2727.745,--It would still be in South Carolina.
2005.04-1186,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2727.745,2739.663,And the same would be true if you were dealing with a State bank incorporated in North Carolina with its principal place of business in Virginia that had 50 branches in South Carolina.
2005.04-1186,2,30478,james_r_gilreath,,2740.107,2740.407,That's... that's true.
2005.04-1186,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2740.407,2740.907,--would still be true.
2005.04-1186,2,30478,james_r_gilreath,,2740.907,2741.868,That's exactly true.
2005.04-1186,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2741.868,2749.583,And that's the parity that Congress has... that has been the guiding principle of Congress' enactments in this area since 1882.
2005.04-1186,2,30478,james_r_gilreath,,2749.583,2756.803,"Well, I don't... I don't know whether I necessarily agree with that or with this parity argument that they've got."
2005.04-1186,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2794.092,2799.885,May I go... may I go back to the textual argument that Justice Scalia was suggesting a little while ago?
2005.04-1186,2,30478,james_r_gilreath,,2860.538,2864.405,--I can't... I can't argue with the logic that you've got.
2005.04-1186,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2867.276,2870.908,"Well, this... I'm... I'm relying strictly on the statutory language in making this argument."
2005.04-1186,2,30478,james_r_gilreath,,2870.908,2873.313,Are you talking about 1448?
2005.04-1186,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2873.313,2884.065,"Yes, because it doesn't say anything about anybody being a... capable of being a citizen of two different places, whereas 1332 does, which is the unusual situation."
2005.04-1186,2,30478,james_r_gilreath,,2884.065,2893.857,I agree that it says they shall be deemed citizens of the States in which they are respectively located.
2005.04-1186,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2893.857,2894.44,Respectively.
2005.04-1186,2,30478,james_r_gilreath,,2894.44,2905.87,"The statute says State... says citizens, which to me says the statute is allowing you to find that they can be a citizen of more than one State."
2005.04-1186,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2905.87,2908.824,"See, but it's clearly unusual to say you can be a citizen of two places."
2005.04-1186,2,30478,james_r_gilreath,,2918.366,2924.308,"I... I can't argue with you, but I... I still come back, you know, to the statute."
2005.04-1186,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3185.474,3186.102,"Thank you, counsel."
2005.04-1186,3,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3189.273,3190.867,"Thank you, I'll try to speak quickly."
2005.04-1186,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3228.733,3241.529,"No, but if there were the problems that you hypothesize here, Congress could have dealt with them by enacting something that dealt with the proliferation of branch banks rather than interpreting the 1948 statute in light of 1980's--"
2005.04-1186,3,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3241.529,3242.923,"--It could have, but it saw no need."
2005.04-1186,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3270.365,3271.792,"--Well, but that's not a rule that they've adopted."
2005.04-1186,3,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3274.68,3276.907,--But it's been interpreted by the Court.
2005.04-1186,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3323.854,3324.521,"Thank you, counsel."
