2011.11-204,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.154,"We'll hear argument this morning in Case 11-204, Christopher v. SmithKline Beecham."
2011.11-204,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,8.07,10.356,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2011.11-204,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,101.032,104.733,"Well, is that consistent with the government's argument?"
2011.11-204,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,125.831,129.885,"It is an arrangement for transfer of title, and that's why it's critical."
2011.11-204,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,140.907,142.625,"I understand that, but I would appreciate an answer--"
2011.11-204,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,142.625,142.893,--Yes.
2011.11-204,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,142.893,143.342,--to my question.
2011.11-204,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,143.342,143.676,Yes.
2011.11-204,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,143.676,148.762,Is the government's position consistent with the reference to consignment for sale?
2011.11-204,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,152.064,154.333,"There is an agreement for a transfer of title, and I believe there--"
2011.11-204,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,154.333,156.083,Is there a -- a transfer of title?
2011.11-204,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,156.083,156.535,--I apologize.
2011.11-204,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,169.276,169.743,"No, no, I understand."
2011.11-204,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,172.878,173.378,"--Oh, no--"
2011.11-204,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,173.378,175.83,--Perhaps I should ask them about -- about their position.
2011.11-204,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,175.83,176.18,--Sure.
2011.11-204,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,178.213,178.413,Excuse me.
2011.11-204,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,189.054,189.721,--Yes.
2011.11-204,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,189.721,192.023,There is no agreement to transfer title.
2011.11-204,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,192.023,192.756,There is--
2011.11-204,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,192.756,196.493,It's purely a future contingency.
2011.11-204,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,201.278,201.695,--Yes.
2011.11-204,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,211.503,212.403,"No -- but anyway, go ahead."
2011.11-204,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,212.403,212.936,--Yes.
2011.11-204,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,245.224,252.944,"Because -- because the limitation on sale is they can't sell -- by Federal law, they can't sell."
2011.11-204,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,284.115,285.149,--I'm sorry.
2011.11-204,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,303.094,305.596,"--For example, what are the -- that's what I wanted to know."
2011.11-204,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,312.182,313.201,--Sure.
2011.11-204,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,320.372,321.688,I don't -- I don't understand what that is.
2011.11-204,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,321.688,322.224,--I apologize.
2011.11-204,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,322.224,324.34,What's an emergency service worker?
2011.11-204,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,324.34,328.711,"A police officer or a fireman, an ambulance driver."
2011.11-204,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,333.948,334.265,Excuse me.
2011.11-204,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,345.756,347.006,"--Well, that -- my--"
2011.11-204,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,347.006,348.356,--These people have no hours of duty.
2011.11-204,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,348.356,351.257,"--That is not quite right, Justice Scalia."
2011.11-204,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,360.765,363.099,"Doesn't that just -- I mean, that's when the doctors are there."
2011.11-204,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,363.099,367.419,--That's -- but that is when they are supposed to be in the doctors' offices.
2011.11-204,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,368.836,370.121,What about -- what about the extras?
2011.11-204,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,394.586,397.355,"Well, a couple things about that, Justice Ginsburg."
2011.11-204,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,426.825,430.343,"You were -- you were giving examples, and we just stopped at--"
2011.11-204,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,430.343,430.893,--Sure.
2011.11-204,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,430.893,432.111,--emergency service worker.
2011.11-204,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,433.611,434.147,Sure.
2011.11-204,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,434.147,438.765,--of people who are highly autonomous and still come under the hours regulation.
2011.11-204,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,438.765,438.965,Sure.
2011.11-204,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,446.705,448.688,And these are all -- these are all within the Fair Labor Standards Act?
2011.11-204,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,448.688,449.273,--Yes.
2011.11-204,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,450.94,461.547,"Are there any occupations or pursuits that are not covered by the Fair Labor Standards Act because -- on the rationale that they are out, that they're unsupervised, and so forth."
2011.11-204,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,477.824,480.426,"I would, but they would all be one of two things."
2011.11-204,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,511.979,514.931,Congress can draw -- draw even silly lines.
2011.11-204,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,514.931,515.315,Yes.
2011.11-204,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,515.315,516.731,"If Congress draws it, it's a line."
2011.11-204,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,570.865,576.919,"That is a sale, but the difference here is that there's neither a commitment -- remember, the commitment is illegal as a matter of law."
2011.11-204,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,576.919,578.019,"Well, but there is a commitment."
2011.11-204,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,594.914,608.89,"Justice Scalia, if that is the commitment, then all of promotion I think is going to be a sale, because every promoter who walks up to you on the street saying, will you try my product, will you go into the store, is trying to get you to say, I'll go in."
2011.11-204,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,646.23,648.563,It's a peculiar line of commerce.
2011.11-204,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,662.74,664.025,"Well, there are two things."
2011.11-204,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,689.473,689.973,"Mr. Goldstein, doesn't--"
2011.11-204,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,689.973,697.793,May I ask you -- may I ask you to follow up on other -- other categories of employee?
2011.11-204,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,707.518,715.338,"--Ah, those are not, but the example that I gave to Justice Kennedy would be, which is that there are outside buyers who do receive commissions."
2011.11-204,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,756.948,757.783,"Thank you, counsel."
2011.11-204,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,768.156,784.018,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: It's common ground in this case that in order to be an outside salesman an employee must make sales, and in theory there are two different ways in which Respondent could have attempted to establish that the PSRs in this case fit that criteria."
2011.11-204,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,784.018,786.887,Could you answer Justice Alito's question?
2011.11-204,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,814.037,826.178,"Well, the DOL regulations have since 19 -- I believe it's since 1949, have said to make a sale within the meaning of 203(k), the term make -- 3(k) includes a transfer of title."
2011.11-204,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,843.306,843.706,"Well, excuse me."
2011.11-204,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,846.508,857.864,"--It would be -- with specific respect to consignments for sale, it would have been more precise to say that there has to be a transfer of possession in contemplation of a transfer of title."
2011.11-204,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,857.864,861.684,And what about salesmen who -- whose objective is to obtain a rental?
2011.11-204,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,865.67,869.172,"DOL believes that they qualify, but not as sales of goods."
2011.11-204,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,908.08,908.665,Excuse me.
2011.11-204,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,917.235,919.904,--They have supplemented 3(k) and they did that--
2011.11-204,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,919.904,921.306,What's the authority to do that?
2011.11-204,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,921.306,953.194,--The -- this is discussed in the Stein report which was issued in 1940; and what had happened was that the question had arisen -- and the Stein report lays this out in a fair amount of detail -- the question had arisen whether individuals who negotiate for contracts to buy time on the radio or sell time -- sell advertising space in newspapers or sell -- negotiate contracts for a carriage of freight by rail or truck; the question arose whether they were outside salesmen within the meaning of the statute.
2011.11-204,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,978.493,979.193,"Well, that's wonderful."
2011.11-204,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1007.495,1007.878,Well--
2011.11-204,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1007.878,1011.047,And the issue would be whether it's unreasonable for them not to say that.
2011.11-204,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1011.047,1021.422,"--The agency has taken the position that, even though it has construed 3(k) to refer only to sales of goods, that sales of services or contracts for the use of facilities can be covered."
2011.11-204,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1031.761,1032.73,Sure there is; sure there is.
2011.11-204,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1044.703,1065.367,"--Well, the -- the theory on which the Stein report proceeded was that, even though sales of time on the radio were not sales of goods, they were still customarily regarded as sales and they had the essential attributes of sales, namely an exchange of something valuable that the seller possessed in return for consideration from the buyer."
2011.11-204,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1069.003,1084.412,"Mr. Stewart, there is this other regulation which is I guess in the coverage section, 779.241, which says that if an employee performs any work that in a practical sense is an essential part of consummating the sale of the goods, he will be considered to be selling the goods."
2011.11-204,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1103.592,1107.644,"--Well, the first thing I would say is that we wouldn't agree that this would cover detailers."
2011.11-204,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1136.646,1140.015,But that seems a little bit blind to the way the industry actually works.
2011.11-204,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1158.077,1165.231,--But I think much the same thing could have been said about all the promotional workers that DOL has done with -- has dealt with in the past.
2011.11-204,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1185.377,1188.079,"Well, do those employees work on commissions?"
2011.11-204,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1188.079,1191.548,Some employees may work on commission.
2011.11-204,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1192.233,1193.466,Promotional workers do work on commissions?
2011.11-204,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1193.466,1198.554,--It's -- I don't think there is necessarily a uniform rule one way or the other.
2011.11-204,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1209.342,1211.292,Didn't we have detailers in 1940?
2011.11-204,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1216.579,1220.098,"--There were detailers in that era, and--"
2011.11-204,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1220.098,1221.316,"That's my point, actually."
2011.11-204,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1278.937,1282.874,"--I guess I'd say two things, one general and one specific to detailers."
2011.11-204,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1288.444,1289.144,"No, I've read those."
2011.11-204,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1289.144,1289.877,--Okay.
2011.11-204,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1289.877,1292.396,"I've read those, and I find them beautifully ambiguous."
2011.11-204,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1299.483,1312.476,"And it's gone on for years, and you're -- instead of doing a regulation, amended regulation, as Justice Breyer indicates, you're filing amicus briefs quietly in different -- different courts."
2011.11-204,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1318.714,1326.368,"Well, with respect to where the industry expectation arose, we have only one data point or at least only one data point that has been identified in the briefs."
2011.11-204,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1354.62,1357.755,"You're right about that, and so they're at fault, too."
2011.11-204,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1382.553,1388.791,"--Internally, the -- the Solicitor's Office at the Department of Labor would consult with the Wage and Hour Division."
2011.11-204,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1403.634,1411.721,"Do you -- I'm sorry to interrupt your answer, but does your office review the amicus filings in the courts of appeals by the agencies?"
2011.11-204,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1411.721,1414.522,There was SG authorization for the amicus brief to be filed.
2011.11-204,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1414.522,1415.191,Is that the normal procedure?
2011.11-204,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1415.191,1415.624,Yes.
2011.11-204,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1415.624,1424.63,"But this is part of a regular program that the agency has now instituted, to run around the country and file amicus briefs; is that it?"
2011.11-204,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1424.63,1428.665,"To clarify -- well, to clarify the agency's view of what the proper understanding of the law is."
2011.11-204,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1430.232,1443.092,"Yes, right, to get -- instead of doing rulemaking, instead of doing adjudication, we're going to file amicus briefs, and the court will accept our view in that amicus brief and, hey, presto, we have made law."
2011.11-204,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1443.092,1444.058,"--Well, maybe yes, maybe no--"
2011.11-204,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1444.058,1444.708,That's extraordinary.
2011.11-204,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1444.708,1449.661,"--Well, in comparison to the alternative step of filing enforcement actions, it's both--"
2011.11-204,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1449.661,1458.017,"Well, did the Secretary of Labor herself or himself, depending on when it was, consider this matter?"
2011.11-204,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1458.017,1460.219,--I don't know whether the Secretary--
2011.11-204,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1460.219,1460.753,"No, we don't."
2011.11-204,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1471.861,1480.8,--And the agency has regarded the application of its promotion sales regulations to the facts of this case as clear.
2011.11-204,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1496.826,1505.765,"There are 90,000 of these people, and you have not -- the agency has not brought any action for these, lo, these many years."
2011.11-204,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1521.125,1531.815,"Well, to the extent that there was an industry expectation that was based on anything DOL had said, it was based on, as far as we know, based on the 1945 opinion letter, which said not--"
2011.11-204,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1531.815,1533.415,"Well, but you -- you didn't even know about that."
2011.11-204,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1533.415,1533.851,--Right.
2011.11-204,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1533.851,1538.653,"And yet you expect the industry to know all about it, and yet it escaped your attention."
2011.11-204,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1538.653,1543.457,"Again, our argument is not that they should have known from the -- about the opinion letter."
2011.11-204,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1569.69,1570.507,"Counsel, can I--"
2011.11-204,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1570.507,1573.173,"So you have been guilty of malfeasance for 70 years, right?"
2011.11-204,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1580.713,1591.253,"To return to the 1945 opinion letter, the opinion letter was based on the premise that the employees exercised discretion and independent judgment in the performance of their duties."
2011.11-204,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1594.02,1602.626,"--Counsel, I thought that this whole system was set up on giving industries the opportunity to ask the government for an opinion letter, correct?"
2011.11-204,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1602.626,1603.394,--Right.
2011.11-204,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1603.394,1609.215,I saw in the briefing hundreds of opinion letters by hundreds of different industries.
2011.11-204,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1621.54,1623.19,I'm aware of only one instance.
2011.11-204,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1635.363,1644.103,"You don't suggest -- you're not arguing for a rule that if -- if an individual does not seek an opinion letter, he's guilty?"
2011.11-204,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1645.221,1646.421,"No, I'm not arguing for that rule."
2011.11-204,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1646.855,1656.363,"Mr. Malcolm -- Mr. Stewart, is it -- is it true that that option is no longer available, that the Department of Labor no longer gives opinion letters?"
2011.11-204,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1656.363,1662.017,--It does -- it has phased out the opinion letter program and gives other forms of administrative guidance.
2011.11-204,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1685.798,1686.965,"Thank you, Mr. Stewart."
2011.11-204,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,1690.584,1693.619,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2011.11-204,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1708.562,1709.914,And they don't do sales.
2011.11-204,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1709.914,1711.081,That--
2011.11-204,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,1711.081,1711.348,With respect--
2011.11-204,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1711.348,1713.949,Your long list sort of stopped one step short.
2011.11-204,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,1715.0,1717.617,"--With respect, Mr. Chief Justice, we disagree."
2011.11-204,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1729.725,1731.494,Can you give me what your regulation is going to be?
2011.11-204,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,1731.494,1732.261,--What's that?
2011.11-204,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1732.261,1734.546,And would it exempt everybody from coverage?
2011.11-204,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,1758.144,1764.982,"Yes, but Justice Sotomayor, if I could, there's two important qualifications that avoid the slippery slope concerns you're talking about."
2011.11-204,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1780.908,1783.71,"Well, it seems like the sale here is not the primary duty."
2011.11-204,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,1796.334,1800.154,"--With respect, Your Honor, the commitment is very important in this industry."
2011.11-204,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1817.949,1820.735,"Primary duty is one of the limiting, and what was the second limiting principle?"
2011.11-204,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,1820.735,1834.893,"--The second limiting principle is actually what I'm talking about now, which is if you look at 503, which are the regulations that draw the distinction between promotion and between being outside sales, they do not say that promotion is nonexempt activity."
2011.11-204,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1848.735,1854.206,"But it also says, it also says promotional work incidental to sales made by someone else."
2011.11-204,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,1854.206,1855.372,--Is not covered.
2011.11-204,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1855.372,1856.408,--is nonexempt.
2011.11-204,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,1856.408,1857.241,You're right.
2011.11-204,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1857.241,1865.847,"And these, these sales -- I mean, eventually there is a sale to a hospital, to a pharmacy, and that sale is not made by the detailer."
2011.11-204,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,1865.847,1887.26,"But, Justice Ginsburg, I think it's important to recognize that the reason that 503 draws a distinction between promotional activity in conjunction with the salesperson's own sales or promotional activity with respect to somebody else's sales is they are concerned about the consideration where somebody else is going to follow up with the same customer to close the deal."
2011.11-204,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1897.901,1902.27,"Well, that might be one thing that they are concerned about, but it may not be the only thing."
2011.11-204,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,1925.318,1942.328,"Well, Justice Kagan, I really think if you look at the regulations as a whole and the commentary in the Stein Report and the Weiss Report, they are not worried about sorting out the pitchmen because they understand that a classic outside salesperson is a pitchman who then tries to get a commitment to buy or some other commitment from the sales target."
2011.11-204,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1969.428,1970.447,Why isn't that possible?
2011.11-204,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,1989.492,1999.867,"--Justice Kagan, it's theoretically possible, but it would be odd, especially in an industry that employs 90,000 people, in order to get a commitment to prescribe from the doctor."
2011.11-204,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2000.533,2002.033,What is -- what is this commitment?
2011.11-204,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2003.552,2006.436,"--The commitment is generally not in writing, Justice Kennedy."
2011.11-204,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2006.436,2008.305,Would it be lawful to make it -- put it in writing?
2011.11-204,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2008.305,2012.857,I don't know that anything would turn on whether it was in writing or not because what--
2011.11-204,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2012.857,2014.792,Would it be lawful to put it in writing?
2011.11-204,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2014.792,2017.594,--I -- I think the answer is yes.
2011.11-204,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2030.719,2038.242,"That sounds to me it's not a commitment, unless the doctor says: Well, I'll look at this, this is interesting; I'll go home and read your material, I'll think about it."
2011.11-204,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2039.425,2040.444,"That's not the kind of commitment they are looking for, Justice Kennedy."
2011.11-204,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2050.649,2052.132,But it's got to be non-binding.
2011.11-204,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2052.132,2054.051,"--It has to be non-binding, I agree."
2011.11-204,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2055.536,2057.286,--And that's why it's not in writing.
2011.11-204,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2057.286,2059.821,"--Well, but you can have a non-binding commitment in writing."
2011.11-204,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2077.033,2093.744,"Well, let me ask you this, and I'm not well versed in all -- in all of the specifics, but my understanding is that the Federal Government has expressed new concerns, has new regulations, new rules about these outside sales."
2011.11-204,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2104.934,2106.552,"I would love to, Justice Kennedy."
2011.11-204,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2159.687,2177.482,"But, Mr. Clement, I thought that in 2004 there were two proposals, really, and one was the proposal that was changed and the other was the proposal to get rid of this promotional stuff and to allow people who promoted products to qualify as outside salesmen, and the agency specifically rejected that suggestion."
2011.11-204,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2177.482,2184.552,"Absolutely, Justice Kagan, but there has always been an effort to try to get all promotional people treated as being exempt."
2011.11-204,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2207.001,2213.571,"But that seems to be inconsistent with this, this opinion letter."
2011.11-204,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2238.723,2244.71,"Well, Justice Ginsburg, I -- I want to say two things about that."
2011.11-204,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2271.694,2285.002,I think the letter goes on to say that these detailers are engaged in a form of promotion not having for its object the making of specific transactions.
2011.11-204,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2285.002,2292.69,"Well, and again, Justice Ginsburg, we would take issue with that and say, no, there is an interest in getting a specific commitment."
2011.11-204,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2303.515,2306.633,"But as far as your years, it's suspect for two reasons."
2011.11-204,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2386.935,2402.362,"--Well, Justice Ginsburg, let me say -- I mean, certainly as the regulatory environment has changed, the nature of how the sales are transacted in this industry have changed, but I think the focus is very much on the doctors appropriately because they're the ones that placed the order."
2011.11-204,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2405.214,2408.266,"You wouldn't -- you wouldn't mind being exempt as administrative, would you?"
2011.11-204,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2408.266,2409.867,"I wouldn't, Justice Scalia--"
2011.11-204,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2409.867,2410.2,Yes.
2011.11-204,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2410.2,2411.2,--but I do want to--
2011.11-204,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2411.2,2411.9,But they've changed their -- their view.
2011.11-204,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2411.9,2413.652,"--They've changed their view on that, too."
2011.11-204,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2431.198,2433.983,Did you claim -- did you claim exemption as administrative employee?
2011.11-204,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2433.983,2435.9,"--We did, Your Honor, in the district court."
2011.11-204,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2445.624,2449.493,So that would -- then that would be still open if you lose on the outside sales?
2011.11-204,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2449.493,2450.843,"--It would, Justice Ginsburg."
2011.11-204,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2465.871,2466.737,"Well, Mr. Clement--"
2011.11-204,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2466.737,2467.554,--and nothing to do--
2011.11-204,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2467.554,2467.854,--I'm sorry.
2011.11-204,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2467.854,2482.381,"--and nothing to do with labor policy, because what they say is that now because of the government's own off-label prosecutions, these outside salespeople have to stick to a script and -- in order to avoid off-label liability."
2011.11-204,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2509.114,2509.814,You've suggested--
2011.11-204,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2509.814,2510.566,--The--
2011.11-204,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2510.566,2510.833,--I'm sorry.
2011.11-204,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2510.833,2512.983,--Are they paid commissions?
2011.11-204,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2528.528,2530.814,He receives incentive compensation.
2011.11-204,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2530.814,2531.814,What does that mean?
2011.11-204,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2540.002,2540.502,Right.
2011.11-204,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2540.502,2550.375,"And now what I'm trying to figure out -- I might not have the right words to ask the question -- are these people, people who in some sense or other receive out -- commissions on their sales?"
2011.11-204,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2550.375,2554.512,"And the answer is -- for the Petitioners on this record, the answer is yes."
2011.11-204,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2566.201,2568.903,How is that different from a bonus that an employee gets?
2011.11-204,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2575.074,2583.763,"--Certainly, based on the facts in this record, it -- at the time of this case, it's much more tied to the performance of the product in the sales territory."
2011.11-204,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2586.948,2592.852,"Mr. Clement, you give me one definition of ""outside salesmen"", the one that you prefer for us to apply here."
2011.11-204,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2623.705,2626.205,"--Justice Sotomayor, two responses to that."
2011.11-204,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2668.882,2670.517,"Mr. Clement, I guess I'm not sure I understand what you just said."
2011.11-204,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2700.286,2702.988,"--It is a possible reading, Justice Kagan."
2011.11-204,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2711.761,2712.494,I suppose that that's a question.
2011.11-204,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2720.164,2724.735,"--Well, and with respect, Justice Kagan, that's one of the many problems with deferring to amicus briefs."
2011.11-204,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2737.775,2744.179,"Well, I think that they would say that it doesn't make any difference, because they've never really seen a person who makes transactions without transferring title."
2011.11-204,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2745.215,2750.35,"Well, with respect, they have -- no -- with respect, they have seen that person."
2011.11-204,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2750.35,2751.885,"Consignment, for one, which is legitimate--"
2011.11-204,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2751.885,2752.835,"Well, consignment is in the statute."
2011.11-204,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2772.198,2783.34,"Did -- did the pharmaceutical companies request -- ever in this period, request a ruling, a rulemaking on the status of these PSRs?"
2011.11-204,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2783.34,2788.625,"Well, I understand from the government that there was a request in 2007 and that the Labor--"
2011.11-204,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2788.625,2790.094,"That was an opinion letter, they said."
2011.11-204,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2792.196,2793.496,--It was a request for an opinion letter.
2011.11-204,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2794.062,2794.746,Yes.
2011.11-204,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2802.152,2812.859,"--No, there wasn't, Justice Ginsburg, but I think that actually cuts in our favor, because in 2004, a lot of companies were coming in with things where they thought it was unclear, where they thought there was some doubt, and asking for clarification."
2011.11-204,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2821.013,2848.164,"What's the case that I cite if this opinion is written the way you -- you propose, and the -- this Court says, well, this has been years, or maybe in 10 years if you take the new regulations as setting a new regime, and the Department has never made an objection, and therefore, it follows that the Department's interpretation is implausible or improper, and then I cite some case from our Court."
2011.11-204,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2849.499,2854.269,--I would -- I would -- I would ask you not to be bound by having to cite a case.
2011.11-204,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2861.373,2862.206,"Well, I'd like one."
2011.11-204,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2862.706,2863.292,Sure.
2011.11-204,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2877.7,2878.918,"--But, Mr. Clement, this isn't a change."
2011.11-204,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2916.843,2918.643,"--Justice Kagan, here's the thing."
2011.11-204,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2937.173,2939.875,Why would you -- why must you look to an amicus brief?
2011.11-204,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2977.798,2987.754,"--Here's the answer as to why that's not the answer, and then let me circle back and say why, if you are going to err on one side or the other, you shouldn't err on the side of imposing massive retroactive liability."
2011.11-204,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3013.836,3017.589,Does the pharmaceutical company have a sales force?
2011.11-204,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,3021.625,3023.493,--It's not this kind of outside sales force.
2011.11-204,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3055.03,3056.465,But there are -- there are people who sell to them.
2011.11-204,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,3058.916,3063.218,"There is a handful of people, Justice Ginsburg, but that's -- I mean, there is nothing anomalous about that."
2011.11-204,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3066.737,3067.772,"--Are they exempt, too?"
2011.11-204,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,3067.772,3068.539,--What's that?
2011.11-204,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3068.539,3083.116,"The -- the actual sellers from the -- the people on the staff of the pharmaceutical company who sell to the wholesalers, pharmacies, and hospitals, are they exempt?"
2011.11-204,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,3083.116,3091.203,"I don't believe so, Your Honor, at least not under the outside sales exemption, in part because they are not outside, in part because they are not really engaged in a sales effort."
2011.11-204,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3124.443,3136.149,"Is there -- let's say the doctor hears the spiel and the doctor says: Okay, yours is the first thing I will think of, you know, when I have a patient with this and this."
2011.11-204,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,3137.417,3153.01,"We think it is, Your Honor, but if you have any doubt about that, certainly at the point that the doctor then, when he sees the next patient, writes the prescription, I think at that point I think there's a sale; because again, what the regulations and regulatory history looks for is a -- is a commitment to buy."
2011.11-204,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3156.528,3163.234,"So what if the doctor, as I suspect a lot of doctors do, they listen to this guy, and they say: Okay, I'll think of -- you know, when it comes up, I'll think of your product."
2011.11-204,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,3169.138,3171.405,"--I think they are probably two sales, Your Honor."
2011.11-204,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3186.247,3188.949,But that's a firmer commitment when they say: I will buy it.
2011.11-204,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,3193.837,3200.324,"But -- well, if -- I mean, what I was suggesting is maybe you are talking about a State that has a 24-hour waiting rule or something like that."
2011.11-204,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3215.167,3226.741,"But don't you think that the way this works -- I mean, the way we should all hope it works is that the detailer comes in, the detailer provides information, the doctor says, that's very interesting, I want to think about it, I'm going to think about it."
2011.11-204,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,3247.055,3248.205,"--Sure, Justice Kagan."
2011.11-204,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3319.134,3334.311,"--Mr. Clement, I wanted to ask you about section 501 of the regulations, which -- which is on page 4 of the appendix in the blue brief, and was mentioned in the -- in the government's presentation."
2011.11-204,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,3349.82,3361.644,"--Well, Justice Scalia, you heard the government's explanation and, as you suggest, if the government's explanation is right, then this shouldn't be a matter of just trying to limit things to -- to the 3(k) definition."
2011.11-204,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3430.439,3432.14,Let's pursue this for a second.
2011.11-204,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,3432.14,3432.574,--Sure.
2011.11-204,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3432.574,3438.044,"Because I would like to go back to Justice Kennedy's question, and this is only me speaking."
2011.11-204,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,3517.392,3519.477,I -- may I answer?
2011.11-204,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3519.477,3519.994,Certainly.
2011.11-204,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,3519.994,3536.856,"I would start by citing -- I know it's not always in fashion to cite lower court opinions, but I would start by citing Judge Posner's opinion in Yi, because the Seventh Circuit there, a, a very distinguished panel, Judge Posner, Judge Wood, and one other judge, the three of them considered this question -- Judge Sykes, I'm sorry; it slipped my mind, a very distinguished judge."
2011.11-204,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3577.414,3578.1,"Thank you, counsel."
2011.11-204,3,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3581.385,3582.768,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2011.11-204,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3668.288,3670.907,Where do they say that that's their test?
2011.11-204,3,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3677.679,3679.095,--There are two different parts to it.
2011.11-204,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3686.785,3687.401,"Well, which is it?"
2011.11-204,3,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3689.82,3690.787,--You have to agree--
2011.11-204,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3690.787,3691.187,Pick one.
2011.11-204,3,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3691.187,3691.57,--You have to--
2011.11-204,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3691.57,3693.022,Is it the transfer of title or a commitment?
2011.11-204,3,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3693.022,3694.622,--It is the agreement to transfer title.
2011.11-204,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3695.474,3695.774,Ah.
2011.11-204,3,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3696.141,3697.991,"--But there has to be the agreement, a firm agreement."
2011.11-204,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3727.243,3732.397,But the district court here made a finding -- this is at 42(a) of -- of the -- the appendix for the Petitioners:
2011.11-204,3,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3740.92,3747.157,"--That -- Mr. Justice Kennedy, I don't believe that you can fairly describe that as a finding of fact."
2011.11-204,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3750.076,3751.561,"It's a finding of logic, for Pete's sake."
2011.11-204,3,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3764.118,3766.403,--Two -- two things about that.
2011.11-204,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3774.774,3775.343,That's a different point.
2011.11-204,3,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3775.343,3776.776,--It is an important point.
2011.11-204,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3777.543,3778.561,It's not the point you were making.
2011.11-204,3,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3778.561,3784.282,"Justice Scalia, the point that I will make at bottom is that you have to have a firm commitment."
2011.11-204,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3787.984,3790.417,"Thank you, counsel, counsel."
