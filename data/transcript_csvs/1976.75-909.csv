1976.75-909,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,71.661,"We will hear arguments next in 75-909, 960, 1050, Environmental Protection Agency v. Brown and the related cases."
1976.75-909,0,38517,randolph,,98.698,103.405,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1976.75-909,1,20993,david_g_hawkins,,3604.07,3606.321,"Indeed I will, Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1976.75-909,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3611.891,3613.084,Very good.
1976.75-909,1,20993,david_g_hawkins,,3613.084,3634.472,"Your Honor, the citizen groups intervened in the court below in the District of Columbia Circuit in support of EPA because of their view, which we're glad to hear the Court shares, that the statute promotes for clean air and that the EPA regulations are the only practical way of achieving that important objective."
1976.75-909,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3764.708,3767.9,You take Shirley Highway as a garage.
1976.75-909,1,20993,david_g_hawkins,,3767.9,3773.577,I would take Shirley --
1976.75-909,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3809.304,3819.545,"You suggest that the EPA could order the owner of the shopping center to establish an inspection system on all vehicles coming into the shopping center to check them for air pollution, is that? …"
1976.75-909,1,20993,david_g_hawkins,,3819.545,3825.451,"We believe there are precedents which would establish just that type of responsibility, and I'd like to turn to some of those."
1976.75-909,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3825.451,3831.301,"Or should he abandon his parking lot, could he be required to abandon his parking lot in order to eliminate this problem?"
1976.75-909,1,20993,david_g_hawkins,,3831.301,3847.927,"Well, what the EPA actually did, Your Honor, was to require that the shopping centers develop their parking lots in ways that would not produce pollution problems that are associated with the use."
1976.75-909,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3847.927,3858.126,We will resume there at 1:00 o’clock.
1976.75-909,1,20993,david_g_hawkins,,3862.886,3864.142,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1976.75-909,2,32138,joel_s_moskowitz,,4193.649,4196.877,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1976.75-909,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4336.305,4339.207,"Well, how far is your argument going along these lines?"
1976.75-909,2,32138,joel_s_moskowitz,,4345.177,4346.013,"No, indeed there is."
1976.75-909,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4372.147,4379.886,"Well now, what then leads you to concede that there's any power to regulate any indirect source if there's no statutory authority?"
1976.75-909,2,32138,joel_s_moskowitz,,4379.886,4384.433,"Well, I don't really have to reach the question of whether there's a power to regulate any indirect source, because --"
1976.75-909,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4384.433,4387.563,"Well, I think it is of some importance here."
1976.75-909,2,32138,joel_s_moskowitz,,4387.563,4390.856,"Well, I haven't really addressed the question of whether there's power to regulate any indirect source."
1976.75-909,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4398.271,4403.884,"But if there is, then one takes a step from that or doesn't take a step from that."
1976.75-909,2,32138,joel_s_moskowitz,,4411.07,4412.507,I agree entirely.
1976.75-909,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4424.927,4439.98,"Well, you do have to reach it, because as I say if there is a power on the part of the Administrator or a state plan to reach an indirect source, then we're faced with one kind of a case; if there's no power at all to reach any indirect source, then you have a much easier case."
1976.75-909,2,32138,joel_s_moskowitz,,4439.98,4443.395,"I think the short answer, Your Honor, is, I don't see it in the statutes."
1976.75-909,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4444.038,4453.474,"Well, shouldn’t your argument be perhaps that assuming that there's power in Congress -- not in EPA, in Congress -- to regulate indirect sources."
1976.75-909,2,32138,joel_s_moskowitz,,4455.031,4458.692,"Oh, we indeed agree on that point and that it's only --"
1976.75-909,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4458.692,4466.15,Then you say that Congress in this statute has not authorized the Administrator to regulate any indirect source of air pollution.
1976.75-909,2,32138,joel_s_moskowitz,,4467.182,4470.965,It's my position simply because I haven't located the power in the statute.
1976.75-909,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4470.965,4496.449,"Mr. Mascowitz, I'm not quite sure how all these letters and numbers go together; but Section 110(a) to (d), which appears on 135(a) of the petition for writ of certiorari in the District of Columbia case, talks about the contents of plans, and it certainly authorizes regulation of sources."
1976.75-909,2,32138,joel_s_moskowitz,,4504.551,4517.434,"It seems to me I agree, and conceivably, obviously, he has done that, but I think the question that I would like to proceed with in order to fully answer your question is that we have to understand what an indirect source is."
1976.75-909,3,27539,henry_r_lord,,6007.135,6009.714,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1976.75-909,3,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,6264.152,6269.935,So what's going to happen to the provisions that are (f) on Page 3A?
1976.75-909,3,27539,henry_r_lord,,6269.935,6294.717,"Your Honor, those provisions I think would be out the same way the earlier provisions about the State having to submit within a particular time at the top of Page 2A, because the State presumably, if we follow strictly the argument that you've heard from EPA, would not have to adopt any legislation and would not have to adopt any regulations."
1976.75-909,3,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,6301.121,6304.473,"This, what we're looking at here, has now been withdrawn, has it?"
1976.75-909,3,27539,henry_r_lord,,6304.473,6306.868,"Well, it has not been withdrawn, Your Honor."
