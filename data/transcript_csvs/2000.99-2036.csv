2000.99-2036,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,4.865,We'll hear argument now on number 99-2036.
2000.99-2036,0,43095,thomas_marcelle,,9.708,12.122,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court--
2000.99-2036,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,56.44,61.866,"Mr. Marcelle, did you cite Lamb's Chapel to the Second Circuit?"
2000.99-2036,0,43095,thomas_marcelle,,61.866,71.412,"Yes, Your Honor, quite extensively, and dissent as well said, Judge Jacobs said the case couldn't be squared with Lamb's Chapel."
2000.99-2036,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,71.412,77.374,"Lamb's Chapel, if I'm correct, is not even cited in the Second Circuit's opinion, is that right?"
2000.99-2036,0,43095,thomas_marcelle,,77.374,78.605,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2000.99-2036,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,78.605,79.387,Isn't even mentioned?
2000.99-2036,0,43095,thomas_marcelle,,79.387,80.856,Isn't even mentioned.
2000.99-2036,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,92.424,101.981,"I assume that the judge who wrote the opinion for the Second Circuit was aware of Lamb's Chapel, not just because you cited it, but because it had reversed an earlier decision of his, isn't that right?"
2000.99-2036,0,43095,thomas_marcelle,,101.981,105.653,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
2000.99-2036,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,112.479,120.536,"Mr. Marcelle, could you clarify for us the nature of the right that you are asserting."
2000.99-2036,0,43095,thomas_marcelle,,128.621,130.16,--Absolutely.
2000.99-2036,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,130.16,143.751,"And you contend that the school has, instead of doing that, opened a limited public forum allowing some groups to use the school in off hours?"
2000.99-2036,0,43095,thomas_marcelle,,143.751,145.36,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2000.99-2036,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,145.36,149.845,Could the school say only hours after 6 p.m.?
2000.99-2036,0,43095,thomas_marcelle,,149.845,151.655,"Your Honor, yes, they--"
2000.99-2036,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,151.655,153.408,And only certain days a week?
2000.99-2036,0,43095,thomas_marcelle,,153.408,154.867,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2000.99-2036,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,157.159,168.545,"You're just seeking equal access on the same terms that the school offers it to other groups to benefit the welfare of the community, is that the idea?"
2000.99-2036,0,43095,thomas_marcelle,,168.545,169.827,"--Exactly, Justice O'Connor."
2000.99-2036,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,172.728,181.304,What if a church asks for privilege to conduct church services once a week during the hours the school allows?
2000.99-2036,0,43095,thomas_marcelle,,181.304,199.477,"Because, Your Honor, Milford has chosen to create a forum that it's probably the broadest possible forum you could create, the uses that pertain to the welfare of the community under this policy, I think they would a Mass, or a church service would qualify, but of course, they have the power and the discretion."
2000.99-2036,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,199.477,213.575,"So if one of the local churches came in and said we'd like to use it one day a week to conduct our regular services, that would have to be granted as well, if it fell on a day and an hour when the school said it was open?"
2000.99-2036,0,43095,thomas_marcelle,,213.575,216.407,"Yes, Your Honor, under this policy."
2000.99-2036,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,228.555,241.776,"Well but, I think you can say that the school, that the school couldn't exclude religious viewpoints or religious groups and still not necessarily say that it had to be open for a full dress religious service."
2000.99-2036,0,43095,thomas_marcelle,,241.776,244.908,"Mr. Chief Justice, that's correct."
2000.99-2036,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,262.137,267.331,It specifically allows meetings and entertainment events and other uses.
2000.99-2036,0,43095,thomas_marcelle,,267.331,269.112,--That's correct.
2000.99-2036,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,275.366,287.745,"Might there not be a problem with the establishment clause, apart from the viewpoint versus content discrimination if there were say a church service to be conducted the same time the Boy Scouts are meeting?"
2000.99-2036,0,43095,thomas_marcelle,,287.745,293.527,"I don't believe so, Justice Ginsburg, for this reason."
2000.99-2036,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,313.082,316.683,But you are talking about a First Amendment free speech right.
2000.99-2036,0,43095,thomas_marcelle,,339.92,345.243,"Justice Ginsburg, I'll give you two answers to your inquiry."
2000.99-2036,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,365.927,371.069,"The age of the, the... that played some role in the Court's decision, didn't it?"
2000.99-2036,0,43095,thomas_marcelle,,381.855,383.678,"--That's correct, Justice Ginsburg."
2000.99-2036,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,401.49,403.14,What was at issue in Widmar?
2000.99-2036,0,43095,thomas_marcelle,,405.501,411.726,It was a... praying and reading the Bible and singing religious songs and teaching from the Bible.
2000.99-2036,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,411.726,416.781,"In, in the school or to the whole school body, before the whole school body?"
2000.99-2036,0,43095,thomas_marcelle,,416.781,418.681,"Not before the whole school body, Your Honor."
2000.99-2036,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,428.709,429.921,And that was upheld?
2000.99-2036,0,43095,thomas_marcelle,,429.921,432.252,"And that was upheld, Your Honor."
2000.99-2036,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,432.252,433.804,I'm sorry.
2000.99-2036,0,43095,thomas_marcelle,,501.588,506.002,"If I may, Justice, be allowed to give you, kind of, two answers."
2000.99-2036,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,518.749,547.988,"Well, that, that might be the case, and it might be the case that you would have a different case before us if those were your facts, but whether State law would prohibit it or not, my question is, don't we have here at least a substantial, I won't decide it from the bench, but don't we have a substantial establishment clause issue, which we simply didn't have in Widmar so that you can't take Widmar as being direct authority for what was going on here?"
2000.99-2036,0,43095,thomas_marcelle,,547.988,551.701,I would say the answer... and that would be in the second part of my answer.
2000.99-2036,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,551.701,551.921,Right.
2000.99-2036,0,43095,thomas_marcelle,,552.472,560.276,"--to your, to your question, is the parents are the ones who decide whether or not the children will attend."
2000.99-2036,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,560.276,570.104,"He's worried about the other children who are, who are supposedly hanging around the school after the bell rings, instead of skipping off the way my kids do."
2000.99-2036,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,586.684,593.198,"I would never spurn Justice Scalia's help, but actually... actually, I think you understood my question."
2000.99-2036,0,43095,thomas_marcelle,,601.103,622.847,I guess I would go back to Justice O'Connor's concurrence in Capitol Square where she said the endorsement tests and the establishment clause are concerned with the political community at large and not particular individuals or isolated observers.
2000.99-2036,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,625.379,641.24,"That's, that's, you know, that's because that was the group to which Capitol Plaza was appealing, but here, the appeal is to kids, and in particular, to the kids who are going to this Sunday school kind of service."
2000.99-2036,0,43095,thomas_marcelle,,641.24,643.983,"--I guess I would disagree with all respect, Justice Souter."
2000.99-2036,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,645.783,653.929,"Mr. Marcelle, was this the basis for the school's refusal to allow the group, you can't do it right after school?"
2000.99-2036,0,43095,thomas_marcelle,,655.449,655.7,No.
2000.99-2036,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,656.18,659.663,--And was this point raised before the Second Circuit?
2000.99-2036,0,43095,thomas_marcelle,,661.265,662.575,Absolutely not.
2000.99-2036,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,662.575,664.788,Was the point raised before the Second Circuit?
2000.99-2036,0,43095,thomas_marcelle,,664.788,671.972,"If I could search my memory and I don't believe, or if it was raised, it was raised tangentially, Your Honor."
2000.99-2036,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,673.384,682.18,"Well then, then do you feel that the decision that the judgment of the Second Circuit should be vacated and the case should be remanded for consideration of this issue?"
2000.99-2036,0,43095,thomas_marcelle,,682.18,686.762,"Well, I, I think what happens is for the purpose of--"
2000.99-2036,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,686.762,687.954,"What do you, what do you think should happen?"
2000.99-2036,0,43095,thomas_marcelle,,687.954,688.863,--Excuse me.
2000.99-2036,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,694.977,698.489,"And why, why should this issue not be considered in the Second Circuit?"
2000.99-2036,0,43095,thomas_marcelle,,698.489,705.203,I believe that Milford school had the burden of proof.
2000.99-2036,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,705.203,714.41,"But you were the Plaintiff in the case, and you had the First Amendment theory, and that lost, and you appealed on that theory."
2000.99-2036,0,43095,thomas_marcelle,,714.41,714.92,Yes.
2000.99-2036,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,714.92,724.816,"Now, it would seem to me if the other issue was, was not aired, we should not decide it in the first instance."
2000.99-2036,0,43095,thomas_marcelle,,724.816,728.509,"Justice Ginsburg, there was cross motions for summary judgment."
2000.99-2036,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,744.269,764.553,"Mr. Marcelle, when the, when the State refuses somebody something to which he is entitled for the wrong reason, and the case is appealed up here, and we say that reason was wrong, do we normally, if the State comes in and says oh, we could have, we could have done it for another reason, you know, not because of his race."
2000.99-2036,0,43095,thomas_marcelle,,771.298,782.935,"Well, I think, they are stuck with the record as in any trial, on any appeal, you could raise new issues and new grounds and could have a new trial."
2000.99-2036,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,782.935,786.889,"This school said we will not let you conduct this service, period."
2000.99-2036,0,43095,thomas_marcelle,,786.889,787.537,At any time.
2000.99-2036,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,787.537,794.032,"At any time because we do not allow religious services in the school, and that's the basis on which it was argued below, as I understand it."
2000.99-2036,0,43095,thomas_marcelle,,794.032,795.154,That's correct.
2000.99-2036,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,795.154,800.797,Did the Court of Appeals rely on the establishment clause in its decision?
2000.99-2036,0,43095,thomas_marcelle,,800.797,803.869,"No, it did not, Mr. Chief Justice."
2000.99-2036,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,813.136,825.393,"And in a trial court, the school district made no distinction in its summary judgment motions or in its answer based on the fact that this was immediately after school?"
2000.99-2036,0,43095,thomas_marcelle,,825.393,828.565,I'm not sure--
2000.99-2036,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,828.565,833.849,"The school district said it could bar these, it could bar these meetings at any time of day?"
2000.99-2036,0,43095,thomas_marcelle,,833.849,834.52,--That's correct.
2000.99-2036,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,835.081,840.034,"And it made no, and it made no distinction between right after school or an hour after school or two hours after school?"
2000.99-2036,0,43095,thomas_marcelle,,840.034,854.903,"--That's correct, Justice Kennedy and in fact on the joint appendix at G 4 and I believe it's paragraph 13, it's the superintendent's affidavit where he is basically says that your speech is too religious to be using the forum."
2000.99-2036,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,854.903,864.539,"Mr. Marcelle, does State law require this school district to open its facilities after school to other groups?"
2000.99-2036,0,43095,thomas_marcelle,,864.539,866.061,"No, Justice O'Connor."
2000.99-2036,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,866.061,869.063,This is a decision made by the particular school.
2000.99-2036,0,43095,thomas_marcelle,,869.063,869.333,Yes.
2000.99-2036,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,874.298,875.328,But does not require it.
2000.99-2036,0,43095,thomas_marcelle,,875.328,876.54,But does not require it.
2000.99-2036,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,876.54,885.966,And is it clear under State law that the school could adopt whatever provisions it wants for its opening of the school?
2000.99-2036,0,43095,thomas_marcelle,,892.652,893.593,Yes.
2000.99-2036,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,910.542,920.51,"So it would be entirely open, whatever this Court chose to do for the school to revamp its policy for hours and days and purposes?"
2000.99-2036,0,43095,thomas_marcelle,,920.51,922.01,"--Absolutely, Justice O'Connor."
2000.99-2036,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,929.596,933.33,"May I ask, what is the, is there a State statutory ceiling you say?"
2000.99-2036,0,43095,thomas_marcelle,,937.601,939.121,"Yes, Justice Stevens."
2000.99-2036,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,939.892,943.485,Are you challenging both the school board's regulation and the State statute?
2000.99-2036,0,43095,thomas_marcelle,,943.485,947.008,"--They gave both reasons for denial, and--"
2000.99-2036,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,947.008,948.858,"And I'm asking, are you challenging--"
2000.99-2036,0,43095,thomas_marcelle,,948.858,950.139,"--I'm sorry, yes, Justice Stevens."
2000.99-2036,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,951.329,953.021,--So you are contending the statute is unconstitutional?
2000.99-2036,0,43095,thomas_marcelle,,953.021,959.365,"The statute to the extent... Justice Stevens, actually it requires a little explanation under New York law."
2000.99-2036,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,999.591,1007.388,"Well, I want to know how that explanation that you just gave us fits with, with what you were telling Justice O'Connor a moment ago."
2000.99-2036,0,43095,thomas_marcelle,,1068.91,1076.192,"I believe Widmar answers that question, Justice Souter."
2000.99-2036,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1076.192,1079.205,I would like Marcelle to answer that question.
2000.99-2036,0,43095,thomas_marcelle,,1083.438,1089.403,My argument is religious worship is inherently a religious viewpoint.
2000.99-2036,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1105.405,1105.675,No.
2000.99-2036,0,43095,thomas_marcelle,,1118.1,1119.242,No.
2000.99-2036,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1132.543,1132.891,Okay.
2000.99-2036,0,43095,thomas_marcelle,,1169.175,1180.542,"--My position is that the First Amendment prohibits drawing that distinction, if that, whatever you called the worship fits within the otherwise religious neutral boundaries of the forum."
2000.99-2036,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1181.854,1191.469,But is that because the State statute is simply inoperative to give the school districts the authority to redraw a policy more narrowly?
2000.99-2036,0,43095,thomas_marcelle,,1191.469,1191.779,--No.
2000.99-2036,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1197.362,1197.573,Okay.
2000.99-2036,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1197.573,1226.043,"If there were to be an action, let's say you prevailed in this action, there would be an action by parents of a 6 year old attending this school, that would challenge the allowance of this group on establishment clause grounds, that would in no way be foreclosed by this, this decision if the issue is there, but not decided by this case, is that right?"
2000.99-2036,0,43095,thomas_marcelle,,1226.043,1229.055,"I guess that would be correct, Justice Ginsburg."
2000.99-2036,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1235.94,1247.306,So the whole question one way or another of whether elementary school students are differently situated than high school students or college students would be open in any case?
2000.99-2036,0,43095,thomas_marcelle,,1247.306,1249.239,"--Depending how the court wrote the opinion, yes."
2000.99-2036,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1250.359,1273.496,"Well, I mean the establishment clause has been presented in this case at least as a defense, that is to say, it has been alleged that one of the reasons that the State could do this is because of the establishment clause problems that would arise were they to do it, and it is, it is quite possibly for this Court's opinion to address that establishment clause argument as well, isn't it?"
2000.99-2036,0,43095,thomas_marcelle,,1273.496,1275.998,"I would assume it's quite possible, Your Honor."
2000.99-2036,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1275.998,1276.476,I'm confused.
2000.99-2036,0,43095,thomas_marcelle,,1278.048,1281.761,"I'm sorry, I said that, excuse me, Justice Ginsburg."

2000.99-2036,0,43095,thomas_marcelle,,1316.404,1317.255,"That's correct, Justice Souter."

2000.99-2036,0,43095,thomas_marcelle,,1337.778,1338.308,I'm not sure.
2000.99-2036,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1338.308,1339.748,--Would they be precluded?
2000.99-2036,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1361.463,1364.124,Assuming you know what we are going to say.
2000.99-2036,0,43095,thomas_marcelle,,1364.124,1366.705,I guess that's--
2000.99-2036,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1366.705,1385.637,"I take it, I take it based on your position it's open to us to say that it's a violation of the establishment clause for the State to scan and to review every single event, every single class in order to purge it of religious content; that that is itself is an establishment violation."
2000.99-2036,0,43095,thomas_marcelle,,1395.414,1396.346,--Absolutely.
2000.99-2036,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1446.588,1446.839,All right.
2000.99-2036,0,43095,thomas_marcelle,,1481.781,1485.754,"The way you state it, Justice Souter, absolutely."
2000.99-2036,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1485.754,1489.875,"Well, not if we rely simply on, on, on the First Amendment speech clause."

2000.99-2036,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1553.518,1556.231,"Well now, what difference does adult sponsored make?"
2000.99-2036,1,24340,frank_w_miller,,1562.625,1564.548,The purpose of emphasizing that--
2000.99-2036,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1564.548,1566.578,All these things are adult sponsored.
2000.99-2036,1,24340,frank_w_miller,,1566.578,1586.964,"--Well, Justice O'Connor, except for the fact that we have the Equal Access Act which we submit that if Petitioner's position is accepted in this case, the Equal Access Act will become meaningless because then you will be able to have adult led and adult sponsored religious activities occurring in a school which the Equal Access Act would prohibit."
2000.99-2036,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1586.964,1589.896,What Equal Access Act are you talking about?
2000.99-2036,1,24340,frank_w_miller,,1589.896,1595.018,I'm talking about the Equal Access Act that was discussed by this Court in Murgens and--
2000.99-2036,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1595.018,1596.257,The New York law?
2000.99-2036,1,24340,frank_w_miller,,1596.257,1598.42,--I'm sorry?
2000.99-2036,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1598.42,1599.971,You are referring to some New York law?
2000.99-2036,1,24340,frank_w_miller,,1601.353,1605.527,"Yes, Justice O'Connor, the Federal statute known as the Equal Access Act."
2000.99-2036,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1605.527,1608.559,Is that before us in this case?
2000.99-2036,1,24340,frank_w_miller,,1608.559,1610.609,"No, Justice O'Connor."
2000.99-2036,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1610.609,1613.211,I didn't think it was presented to us on that basis.
2000.99-2036,1,24340,frank_w_miller,,1613.211,1613.972,"No, it is not."
2000.99-2036,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1639.889,1640.159,Right.
2000.99-2036,1,24340,frank_w_miller,,1645.053,1651.178,"Mr. Chief Justice, it's kindergarten through sixth grade, so it's actually ages 5 to 12."
2000.99-2036,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1651.178,1656.862,"Well, it would be unusual, wouldn't it, for any meeting after school not to have an adult leader?"
2000.99-2036,1,24340,frank_w_miller,,1660.906,1661.033,"Oh, absolutely."
2000.99-2036,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1669.729,1674.653,"May I just ask on the equal access, I don't really have it in mind."
2000.99-2036,1,24340,frank_w_miller,,1680.407,1682.056,It would prohibit the activity.
2000.99-2036,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1682.056,1682.447,It prohibits it.
2000.99-2036,1,24340,frank_w_miller,,1682.447,1687.64,"At the elementary level, and it would prohibit the involvement of adult supervision."
2000.99-2036,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1687.64,1688.502,Are you sure about that?
2000.99-2036,1,24340,frank_w_miller,,1695.898,1706.216,"Justice Scalia, my understanding of the Act was that it specifically prohibited adult led and adult sponsored activities at the elementary level, which is the situation."
2000.99-2036,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1706.216,1706.437,Wow.
2000.99-2036,1,24340,frank_w_miller,,1720.535,1720.805,That's right.
2000.99-2036,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1720.805,1721.746,All right.
2000.99-2036,1,24340,frank_w_miller,,1754.568,1755.079,Right.
2000.99-2036,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1755.079,1756.03,I want to hear your answer.
2000.99-2036,1,24340,frank_w_miller,,1756.03,1756.739,"Yes, sir."
2000.99-2036,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1756.739,1769.318,"And, and my, my thought is aimed at the clarity of such a rule that ordinary people can understand, in light of the basic principles underlying establishment on the one hand and free speech on the other."
2000.99-2036,1,24340,frank_w_miller,,1769.318,1770.59,"Yes, Justice Breyer."
2000.99-2036,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1784.228,1785.59,Exactly.
2000.99-2036,1,24340,frank_w_miller,,1788.042,1788.462,Correct.
2000.99-2036,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1788.462,1793.066,"--People can talk about any subject matter, but not religion."
2000.99-2036,1,24340,frank_w_miller,,1815.911,1824.576,"Well, the theory is, Justice Breyer, that we have set limits to exclude on a reasonable basis certain activities from occurring in the school."
2000.99-2036,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1854.636,1857.177,"What, what do you do about the, our Lamb's Chapel decision?"
2000.99-2036,1,24340,frank_w_miller,,1863.262,1867.653,"I'm, I'm well aware of that, Mr. Chief Justice."
2000.99-2036,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1888.226,1897.432,"Well that... yes, but as I understand it, as it has been represented to us, that wasn't the basis for the school district's exclusion here."
2000.99-2036,1,24340,frank_w_miller,,1919.618,1924.891,"Well, Justice Souter, I think perhaps the actions of the school district have been somewhat mischaracterized."
2000.99-2036,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1954.249,1955.701,Where is that letter in the record?
2000.99-2036,1,24340,frank_w_miller,,1955.701,1956.272,"Yes, sir."
2000.99-2036,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1978.145,1987.002,And was it religious worship which was the ground that you... you chose to stand on in the district court and in the argument before the Second Circuit?
2000.99-2036,1,24340,frank_w_miller,,1987.002,1990.244,"Justice... Justice Souter, we advanced both."
2000.99-2036,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2015.522,2024.428,"On that, you think this letter is correct that hearing a Bible lesson and memorizing Scripture is the equivalent of religious worship?"
2000.99-2036,1,24340,frank_w_miller,,2024.428,2027.37,"Justice Scalia, yes, sir, I do."
2000.99-2036,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2027.37,2036.178,"And have you memorized the Declaration of Independence or the preamble of the Constitution, that's something other... what is that?"
2000.99-2036,1,24340,frank_w_miller,,2040.819,2042.379,Justice Kennedy--
2000.99-2036,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2042.379,2045.782,"That's not, that's not imparting a view on what our history means?"
2000.99-2036,1,24340,frank_w_miller,,2045.782,2047.104,"--Oh, of course it is."
2000.99-2036,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2047.104,2051.025,"We, we don't want you to know... be able to recite the First Amendment?"
2000.99-2036,1,24340,frank_w_miller,,2051.025,2056.641,"We don't certainly contend that that was a full description, Justice Kennedy, of everything that was occurring."
2000.99-2036,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2064.976,2066.094,"Well, suppose it was."
2000.99-2036,1,24340,frank_w_miller,,2066.094,2066.766,"Yes, sir."
2000.99-2036,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2066.766,2069.938,And I'm just putting this to get your response.
2000.99-2036,1,24340,frank_w_miller,,2089.272,2089.831,"Yes, Your Honor."
2000.99-2036,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2089.831,2091.213,It includes all kinds of activity.
2000.99-2036,1,24340,frank_w_miller,,2091.213,2091.944,That's correct.
2000.99-2036,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2091.944,2096.324,"So suppose you were to say any activity is fine, just one is not."
2000.99-2036,1,24340,frank_w_miller,,2098.357,2099.318,"No, sir."
2000.99-2036,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2099.318,2099.909,After school.
2000.99-2036,1,24340,frank_w_miller,,2104.832,2113.527,"Well, Justice Breyer, the premise of the question operates under the assumption that the only thing that we excluded was religious, were religious activities, I believe."
2000.99-2036,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2113.527,2115.16,"Well, that's what seems to be what you're saying."
2000.99-2036,1,24340,frank_w_miller,,2128.757,2129.218,"Yes, sir."
2000.99-2036,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2129.218,2138.385,"So it seems to me that what you have on one side of the page is use it for anything, and on the other side of the page, there is an exception, religious purposes."
2000.99-2036,1,24340,frank_w_miller,,2153.815,2158.908,"Your Honor, we have excluded the entire subject matter of religion as we--"
2000.99-2036,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2158.908,2159.669,"Well, doesn't that make it worse?"
2000.99-2036,1,24340,frank_w_miller,,2161.468,2167.633,"--No, Your Honor, because that is not, that is, in fact, not the case as this particular forum was created."
2000.99-2036,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2181.772,2191.129,"But, but it didn't exclude discussions of morality... the Boy Scouts, the Girl Scouts teach that."
2000.99-2036,1,24340,frank_w_miller,,2191.129,2191.95,"Yes, sir."
2000.99-2036,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2191.95,2198.274,What it really excluded was a discussion of morality that had a religious perspective.
2000.99-2036,1,24340,frank_w_miller,,2198.274,2205.159,"Well, Your Honor, that... the facts in the case really don't spell that out."
2000.99-2036,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2224.671,2228.975,"Well, the very oath of the Boy Scouts is moral."
2000.99-2036,1,24340,frank_w_miller,,2228.975,2230.527,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2000.99-2036,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2238.602,2252.861,"And so someone who spoke of, wanted to teach about how to be a good citizen from a particularly, especially secular point of view could not have done so under your program?"
2000.99-2036,1,24340,frank_w_miller,,2252.861,2256.133,"Your Honor, they could have."
2000.99-2036,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2256.874,2257.663,They could have done it.
2000.99-2036,1,24340,frank_w_miller,,2257.663,2258.324,"--Yes, sir."
2000.99-2036,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2258.324,2263.64,But someone who wanted to speak about exactly the same subject from a religious point of view could not have?
2000.99-2036,1,24340,frank_w_miller,,2263.64,2268.245,I don't... I don't agree with the Chief Justice's statement of the question.
2000.99-2036,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2278.891,2282.073,You say this is essentially a religious worship service.
2000.99-2036,1,24340,frank_w_miller,,2300.555,2310.352,"Well, except for the fact, Your Honor... Your Honor that the Sunday school is generally the way that religious worship is presented to children of this, of this age group."
2000.99-2036,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2317.636,2321.579,Another way to put it would be that children of that age don't engage in religious worship.
2000.99-2036,1,24340,frank_w_miller,,2323.742,2325.383,"Well, Justice Scalia, they go--"
2000.99-2036,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2325.383,2329.493,"I mean, just because they go, you are going to suddenly convert Sunday school into a Mass?"
2000.99-2036,1,24340,frank_w_miller,,2329.493,2330.103,--No.
2000.99-2036,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2338.96,2339.18,That's right.
2000.99-2036,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2339.18,2339.861,Don't they pray--
2000.99-2036,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2339.861,2341.512,--Religious worship is not part of it.
2000.99-2036,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2341.512,2342.904,Don't they pray?
2000.99-2036,1,24340,frank_w_miller,,2342.904,2344.674,"--Yes, sir, they do."
2000.99-2036,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2344.674,2351.048,May I ask to you clarify now something that Mr. Marcelle addressed as well.
2000.99-2036,1,24340,frank_w_miller,,2355.283,2355.884,"Yes, Your Honor."
2000.99-2036,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2355.884,2362.927,And that the district court said I'm not going to deal with it because I decide the case in your favor on another ground.
2000.99-2036,1,24340,frank_w_miller,,2362.927,2363.318,Correct.
2000.99-2036,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2363.318,2366.41,"So it was raised, you raised it, but it wasn't decided."
2000.99-2036,1,24340,frank_w_miller,,2366.41,2367.03,That's correct.
2000.99-2036,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2367.03,2369.671,It seems to me that that's got to remain open.
2000.99-2036,1,24340,frank_w_miller,,2369.671,2372.194,"Yes, Your Honor, I believe that it does."
2000.99-2036,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2374.396,2389.636,"Your position is that saying a prayer is religious worship and I assume then that any group which sought to meet on your school's property which opened its meeting with a prayer would be excluded, and you think that's in accord with Lamb's Chapel?"
2000.99-2036,1,24340,frank_w_miller,,2389.636,2394.087,"Religious worship would be excluded, Justice Scalia."
2000.99-2036,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2394.087,2398.231,"And you said in response to Justice Souter that saying a prayer is religious worship, right?"
2000.99-2036,1,24340,frank_w_miller,,2398.231,2399.302,Justice Scalia--
2000.99-2036,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2399.302,2399.503,Right?
2000.99-2036,1,24340,frank_w_miller,,2404.265,2406.937,"--I wouldn't necessarily say that, Justice Scalia."
2000.99-2036,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2406.937,2407.317,You just did say it.
2000.99-2036,1,24340,frank_w_miller,,2407.317,2417.873,"Well, I... the point I'm getting across is that the activities of the Good News Club were more than merely reciting one prayer."
2000.99-2036,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2427.49,2440.288,"They were more religious, but they were not necessarily the same thing as a church religion... as a church worship service, teaching the Scripture, teaching what the Scripture has to say about morality."
2000.99-2036,1,24340,frank_w_miller,,2445.243,2446.773,Justice Scalia--
2000.99-2036,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2446.773,2448.345,Even if you throw in a prayer or two.
2000.99-2036,1,24340,frank_w_miller,,2448.345,2455.148,"--Justice Scalia, for children of this age group, that is the religious worship service that they would typically engage in."
2000.99-2036,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2455.148,2456.149,"Well, if that's so--"
2000.99-2036,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2456.149,2466.087,"--And that's what you want to litigate, if on the broad ground you lose, you say we have raised that, and we should be allowed to litigate that go back to district court, is that it?"
2000.99-2036,1,24340,frank_w_miller,,2466.087,2470.239,"I'm hoping we don't lose this case, Justice Souter."
2000.99-2036,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2470.239,2480.545,"I recognize that, but you're saying, whether you agree with Justice Scalia or not, you're saying we want to litigate that in the district court and--"
2000.99-2036,1,24340,frank_w_miller,,2480.545,2483.217,I believe that we've preserved it and fully developed the record with respect--
2000.99-2036,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2483.217,2484.239,"--Well, you did litigate it, didn't you?"
2000.99-2036,1,24340,frank_w_miller,,2484.239,2489.372,"--Except for the fact, Mr. Chief Justice, that it was not ruled on specifically."
2000.99-2036,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2502.499,2513.658,"Is that the right way, then, to deal with what I would see as the difficult issue in this case, the difficult issue being suppose it's a total prayer service?"
2000.99-2036,1,24340,frank_w_miller,,2513.658,2514.556,"Yes, sir."
2000.99-2036,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2514.556,2515.708,Imagine that it is.
2000.99-2036,1,24340,frank_w_miller,,2515.708,2516.319,"Yes, sir."
2000.99-2036,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2516.319,2532.859,"Now, is the way to get at that problem, if assuming there is a problem, that either a total prayer service would be unlawful, either you have... either it would violate the establishment clause or it wouldn't."
2000.99-2036,1,24340,frank_w_miller,,2532.859,2533.6,Correct.
2000.99-2036,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2533.6,2539.004,"If it doesn't violate the establishment clause, you lose this case a fortiori."
2000.99-2036,1,24340,frank_w_miller,,2561.557,2564.6,"Well, several ways."
2000.99-2036,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2590.349,2594.9,This is divisive in the community?
2000.99-2036,1,24340,frank_w_miller,,2595.752,2596.523,"Well, Justice Scalia--"
2000.99-2036,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2596.523,2598.603,"You would let all religious groups do this, right?"
2000.99-2036,1,24340,frank_w_miller,,2598.603,2602.807,"--Presumably, if you ordered it."
2000.99-2036,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2602.807,2605.789,Religious groups that didn't want to do it would get upset that other religious groups did want to do it?
2000.99-2036,1,24340,frank_w_miller,,2605.789,2607.281,"Well, actually, Your Honor--"
2000.99-2036,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2607.281,2609.463,You must have a very divisive community down there.
2000.99-2036,1,24340,frank_w_miller,,2611.055,2613.696,"--Actually it isn't terribly divisive, Justice Scalia."
2000.99-2036,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2639.632,2641.382,Why would it be a favoritism?
2000.99-2036,1,24340,frank_w_miller,,2652.512,2653.941,"Yes, sir."
2000.99-2036,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2654.301,2667.232,"Well, then what you're saying basically, it's kind of a heckler's veto, that if people don't like what the school is doing and are unhappy about it, that is a reason for excluding religion."
2000.99-2036,1,24340,frank_w_miller,,2667.232,2674.885,--I don't believe that to be the only basis upon which we've determined that it is appropriate to exclude this.
2000.99-2036,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2699.302,2702.844,"No, but are you contending that the State statute required this policy?"
2000.99-2036,1,24340,frank_w_miller,,2702.844,2708.368,"Justice Stevens, I believe that that's essentially what the State statute mandated."
2000.99-2036,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2715.272,2723.358,"Well, but you don't say that the school couldn't adopt some different policy and say we're not going to allow any use of our buildings at all?"
2000.99-2036,1,24340,frank_w_miller,,2723.358,2725.068,"That is correct, Justice O'Connor."
2000.99-2036,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2725.068,2727.641,The State law does not prohibit that?
2000.99-2036,1,24340,frank_w_miller,,2727.641,2728.561,That is correct.
2000.99-2036,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2728.561,2735.366,"And the school could say, we're only going to allow after school use for athletic purposes."
2000.99-2036,1,24340,frank_w_miller,,2735.366,2736.037,Correct.
2000.99-2036,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2736.037,2738.942,Or we're only going to allow it after 6 p.m..
2000.99-2036,1,24340,frank_w_miller,,2738.942,2740.04,Correct.
2000.99-2036,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2740.04,2740.521,Yeah.
2000.99-2036,1,24340,frank_w_miller,,2745.055,2754.949,"That is correct, except one of the things that they do not permit, along with other prohibitions, such as a political... partisan political activities, commercial activities, and so on."
2000.99-2036,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2758.483,2760.073,"Well, Mr. Miller, you can't have it both ways."
2000.99-2036,1,24340,frank_w_miller,,2762.666,2763.215,"Yes, sir."
2000.99-2036,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2763.215,2766.868,--then certainly the constitutionality of the State law is at issue in this case.
2000.99-2036,1,24340,frank_w_miller,,2783.979,2784.68,"Yes, sir."
2000.99-2036,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2792.155,2797.238,"By the way, the Federal Equal Access Act does not prohibit what was done here."
2000.99-2036,1,24340,frank_w_miller,,2803.683,2803.914,--Yes.
2000.99-2036,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2803.914,2806.815,--are not imposed upon elementary schools--
2000.99-2036,1,24340,frank_w_miller,,2806.815,2807.614,At the elementary level.
2000.99-2036,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2807.614,2808.095,--That's right.
2000.99-2036,1,24340,frank_w_miller,,2808.095,2810.777,My understanding is it was a very vigorous debate about whether--
2000.99-2036,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2810.777,2812.449,It doesn't prohibit doing it at the elementary level.
2000.99-2036,1,24340,frank_w_miller,,2816.44,2818.172,--That is correct.
2000.99-2036,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2846.219,2846.339,"Well, now, just a minute."
2000.99-2036,1,24340,frank_w_miller,,2857.949,2858.367,Correct.
2000.99-2036,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2858.367,2860.01,You told me the school can do that.
2000.99-2036,1,24340,frank_w_miller,,2860.01,2861.412,The school can do that.
2000.99-2036,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2861.412,2864.732,So why would you complain about 3 o'clock?
2000.99-2036,1,24340,frank_w_miller,,2867.153,2884.376,"That is correct, Justice O'Connor, it is something that the school set up and allows, but they didn't specify specific times, and when they examined this particular circumstance, they determined that it was religious worship and chose not to exclude it... or, excuse me, chose to exclude it."
2000.99-2036,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2884.376,2884.694,But--
2000.99-2036,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2884.694,2887.646,--But that's all that's before us is the religious worship.
2000.99-2036,1,24340,frank_w_miller,,2894.652,2895.453,That is--
2000.99-2036,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2895.453,2900.335,"And your position is they can't do it at any time of day, and that's the way the case has been presented to us here."
2000.99-2036,1,24340,frank_w_miller,,2900.335,2901.006,--That is correct.
2000.99-2036,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2902.027,2911.203,"And the school, in fact, never complained about the time, none of this correspondence said the problem is you're doing it right after school and these other kids will think that... right?"
2000.99-2036,1,24340,frank_w_miller,,2912.744,2921.058,"That is correct, Justice Scalia, the original denial was based on the fact that it was religious worship, not based upon the specific time of day, that is correct."
2000.99-2036,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2921.058,2922.2,And you defend that position?
2000.99-2036,1,24340,frank_w_miller,,2922.2,2923.422,"Yes, sir, I do."
2000.99-2036,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2942.576,2947.479,"Now, why would it violate the establishment clause?"
2000.99-2036,1,24340,frank_w_miller,,2966.573,2966.983,Correct.
2000.99-2036,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2966.983,2968.463,Even after school.
2000.99-2036,1,24340,frank_w_miller,,2983.201,2983.431,Correct.
2000.99-2036,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2983.431,2983.972,Why?
2000.99-2036,1,24340,frank_w_miller,,2983.972,2993.549,"Because under those circumstances that you just posit, I believe that the school is then lending support to a particular religious exercise or a particular religion."
2000.99-2036,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3022.668,3035.867,"But the state provides, for example, crossing guards on Sundays at church services, and that is not thought... to facilitate people going to the church service, there's no other reason for it."
2000.99-2036,1,24340,frank_w_miller,,3043.762,3046.354,"That's correct, Justice Scalia."
2000.99-2036,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3046.354,3050.207,So why if public facilities... and I don't... I know many schools that do it.
2000.99-2036,1,24340,frank_w_miller,,3054.849,3055.671,Uh huh.
2000.99-2036,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3055.671,3064.004,"--why must they exclude a religious purpose so long as they're doing it evenhandedly, all religions, all other purposes, just like crossing guards?"
2000.99-2036,1,24340,frank_w_miller,,3064.004,3067.397,"The example of the crossing guards you gave, I presume, is on a public street."
2000.99-2036,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3093.675,3094.186,On Sundays?
2000.99-2036,1,24340,frank_w_miller,,3101.982,3108.005,"Well, they wouldn't... if they were doing it for a for profit purpose under New York law, that wouldn't be permissible."
2000.99-2036,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3108.005,3110.336,"Oh, you can violate the establishment clause for money?"
2000.99-2036,1,24340,frank_w_miller,,3110.336,3114.54,"Well, no, no, it wouldn't be a permissible use was my point."
2000.99-2036,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3122.186,3128.588,"To prohibit the use of public facilities for religious purposes shows the State is neutral as to religion, is that your point?"
2000.99-2036,1,24340,frank_w_miller,,3128.588,3139.277,"Justice Kennedy, I believe that we are required to be neutral and permit the schoolhouse to be used as a house of worship would violate, I believe, the principle of neutrality."
2000.99-2036,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3139.277,3164.983,"Why would it do so if, unlike this case, there's no particular involvement of schoolchildren involved, and the district allows the, let's say the auditorium to be used for a meeting of the Elks, for a meeting of the Veterans of Foreign Wars, and the Baptists have had their church burned, and they want to use it."
2000.99-2036,1,24340,frank_w_miller,,3179.643,3183.897,Is Justice Souter's question in reference to this specific record or is this a hypothetical?
2000.99-2036,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3183.897,3200.937,"No, no, I'm going back I think to Justice Breyer's question, and I understood you to answer his question in such a way that would say, yes, it would, in my example, it would be a violation to let the church group use it at the same... on the same terms as the VFW, and I don't understand what your reasoning is."
2000.99-2036,1,24340,frank_w_miller,,3204.269,3209.042,Because you would be permitting then a schoolhouse to be used as a house of worship.
2000.99-2036,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3215.696,3230.075,"Well, if that was the case, in... the facts in Widmar, then, would have been an establishment clause violation because in Widmar you had a state university property that was being used for purposes of worship, so that would have violated the establishment clause."
2000.99-2036,1,24340,frank_w_miller,,3230.075,3233.267,"Well, Justice Souter, I believe that Widmar is a totally different case."
2000.99-2036,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3236.49,3241.145,"But you're talking about the First Amendment, and now we're talking about the establishment clause."
2000.99-2036,1,24340,frank_w_miller,,3254.402,3264.85,I would have to take the position that with respect to that forum which had been open for all purposes--
2000.99-2036,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3264.85,3266.861,We're not talking about forum analysis.
2000.99-2036,1,24340,frank_w_miller,,3269.892,3271.274,--Uh huh.
2000.99-2036,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3271.875,3275.017,"In other words, I'm going from the speech clause to the establishment clause."
2000.99-2036,1,24340,frank_w_miller,,3281.041,3286.416,"This Court apparently held it wasn't, although you looked at it as a free speech case, so presumably--"
2000.99-2036,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3286.416,3286.647,Yes.
2000.99-2036,1,24340,frank_w_miller,,3286.647,3289.987,--in that particular matter you allowed it.
2000.99-2036,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3291.459,3297.093,"In this particular district, this school district, we're dealing with elementary grades?"
2000.99-2036,1,24340,frank_w_miller,,3297.093,3297.494,--Correct.
2000.99-2036,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3297.494,3303.668,Is there any practice with respect to high school or public colleges in that area?
2000.99-2036,1,24340,frank_w_miller,,3311.441,3316.096,"Justice Ginsburg, that is not reflected in the record, and I'm not certain of the answer to that."
2000.99-2036,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3323.991,3332.008,Does the record show that there are a lot of other children who were hanging around the school while this service is conducting... conducted?
2000.99-2036,1,24340,frank_w_miller,,3333.748,3337.592,"It is not fully developed, Justice Scalia, but I believe there is some evidence of that, yes, sir."
2000.99-2036,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3337.592,3338.634,"Thank you, Mr. Miller."
2000.99-2036,2,43095,thomas_marcelle,,3341.545,3347.611,"If the Court... if it would please the Court, I have two quick points to make on rebuttal."
2000.99-2036,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3393.79,3397.743,Can I ask as long as... I would like you to--
2000.99-2036,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3397.743,3398.532,--This is on rebuttal.
2000.99-2036,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3398.532,3400.725,I thought he was finished.
2000.99-2036,2,43095,thomas_marcelle,,3401.735,3404.897,"No, I'm finished, Justice."
2000.99-2036,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3404.897,3406.079,I thought he was.
2000.99-2036,2,43095,thomas_marcelle,,3436.501,3440.084,Not if it has a broad forum.
