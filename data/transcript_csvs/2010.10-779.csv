2010.10-779,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,10.689,"We will hear argument first this morning -- this morning in Case 10-779, William Sorrell, Attorney General of Vermont, v. IMS Health Incorporated."
2010.10-779,0,17396,bridget_c_asay,,11.739,14.174,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2010.10-779,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,68.477,75.131,"The purpose -- the purpose is to prevent sales representatives from contacting particular physicians, right?"
2010.10-779,0,17396,bridget_c_asay,,75.131,76.298,"I disagree, Your Honor."
2010.10-779,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,105.067,107.185,"But they could use it for other purposes, right?"
2010.10-779,0,17396,bridget_c_asay,,107.185,110.304,--The pharmaceutical manufacturers?
2010.10-779,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,110.304,110.771,Right.
2010.10-779,0,17396,bridget_c_asay,,110.771,114.439,Under this statute they may use it for some limited purposes for clinical trials.
2010.10-779,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,114.439,119.577,"So what the Chief Justice suggested is right, that the purpose is to stop them from using it in order to market their drugs?"
2010.10-779,0,17396,bridget_c_asay,,119.577,123.629,The purpose is to allow doctors to decide whether the--
2010.10-779,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,123.629,124.647,That's right.
2010.10-779,0,17396,bridget_c_asay,,124.647,125.914,--the information should be available.
2010.10-779,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,125.914,130.885,"Well, that's right, but that -- that is an impediment to their using it for the marketing of drugs."
2010.10-779,0,17396,bridget_c_asay,,139.741,151.714,"As with any information that the -- that might inform a marketing campaign, not having the information may be -- make their marketing less effective or make it different."
2010.10-779,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,151.714,152.148,That's the purpose.
2010.10-779,0,17396,bridget_c_asay,,156.868,165.808,"Again, Your Honor, the purpose is to allow doctors to make the decision, and doctors may want to allow its use or not allow its use."
2010.10-779,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,167.324,174.045,But it's only for that use that you interpose the requirement that the doctor consent.
2010.10-779,0,17396,bridget_c_asay,,177.33,186.804,"--The only -- the consent requirement in this statute goes to the use for marketing and also to the sale by the pharmacy, and that sale may be for other purposes as well, so there--"
2010.10-779,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,186.804,200.028,"Ms. Asay, are any of the other uses, like for insurance purposes, cases where the pharmacist is paid for giving out the prescriber information?"
2010.10-779,0,17396,bridget_c_asay,,214.621,218.089,"--Your Honor, there's two sort of answers to that."
2010.10-779,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,247.757,261.766,"So -- so the data is not private in the sense that the physician who prescribes knows that nobody will know what he is prescribing and how much he prescribes and how often, because there are a lot of people who do know that, right?"
2010.10-779,0,17396,bridget_c_asay,,261.766,266.82,"That's correct, Your Honor, there are people who know what the doctor prescribes and what the patient has received."
2010.10-779,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,266.82,284.615,"So the only thing it assures the physician, the physician who prescribes, is that he won't be bothered by drug companies who, on the basis of their knowledge of information which other people have, approach him in order to market their drugs?"
2010.10-779,0,17396,bridget_c_asay,,289.484,296.922,It assures the prescribing physician that his information about prescribing practices will not be used for marketing without his consent.
2010.10-779,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,298.139,305.528,"And, and he could achieve the same objective, could he not, by simply refusing to talk to the marketer."
2010.10-779,0,17396,bridget_c_asay,,313.115,315.467,"--He could not achieve the same result, Your Honor."
2010.10-779,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,338.666,348.89,"One of the Respondents argues that the statute would permit, does permit, the use of this information for what they call a counter-detailing effort."
2010.10-779,0,17396,bridget_c_asay,,349.774,359.663,"--It is not correct, Your Honor, to the extent that Respondents have suggested that Vermont's academic detailing program, which is called the evidence-based education program, uses this data."
2010.10-779,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,359.663,361.365,That wasn't really my question.
2010.10-779,0,17396,bridget_c_asay,,371.304,378.725,"Well, the statute would not permit the sale for that purpose, which is a separate provision of the statute, because academic detailing is not an exemption."
2010.10-779,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,385.98,388.682,Could that data be sold to a university for research purposes?
2010.10-779,0,17396,bridget_c_asay,,394.602,398.221,"--Yes, Your Honor, the statute does permit it to be sold for health care research--"
2010.10-779,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,398.221,410.429,"Could the researcher then have a profile, a data bank, that is very helpful to the general public, and sell that to the general public, to the newspapers and so forth?"
2010.10-779,0,17396,bridget_c_asay,,410.429,423.087,"--We do not believe so, Your Honor, because of the background regulations that govern this information, including Pharmacy Board Rule 20, which we cited at page 4 of our brief, which also places restrictions on disclosure of patient and practitioner--"
2010.10-779,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,423.087,424.77,"No, no."
2010.10-779,0,17396,bridget_c_asay,,438.263,445.433,--I'm not sure if I understand whether the question is about the data itself or results drawn from the data.
2010.10-779,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,454.289,455.339,Would you clarify--
2010.10-779,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,455.339,457.158,I still am not -- I still am not sure.
2010.10-779,0,17396,bridget_c_asay,,459.776,462.628,--When the -- if the pharmacy sold--
2010.10-779,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,462.628,464.497,The pharmacy sells to the researcher.
2010.10-779,0,17396,bridget_c_asay,,464.497,464.947,--Right.
2010.10-779,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,465.63,467.114,The researcher is at the university.
2010.10-779,0,17396,bridget_c_asay,,478.12,485.876,--The statute would have required the pharmacy to prevent the further dissemination of the data except for health care research.
2010.10-779,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,485.876,489.411,--You answered my question earlier that they don't sell it to anyone else.
2010.10-779,0,17396,bridget_c_asay,,506.353,509.138,"I apologize, Your Honor, if I was not clear."
2010.10-779,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,519.494,534.623,How does it increase the prescribing physician's right of privacy that the data about his prescribing can only be given away but can't be sold?
2010.10-779,0,17396,bridget_c_asay,,539.341,547.096,What it allows the doctor to do is to avoid an intrusive and invasive marketing practice.
2010.10-779,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,547.096,549.23,He can do that by saying: I don't want to talk to you.
2010.10-779,0,17396,bridget_c_asay,,549.23,563.273,"The doctor cannot -- can shut off any communication and any information from the pharmaceutical companies by slamming the door on the detailers, but that's not necessarily in the interest of doctors or patients."
2010.10-779,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,564.225,568.344,"That may well be, but then just don't tell me that the purpose is to protect their privacy."
2010.10-779,0,17396,bridget_c_asay,,588.09,598.863,"--Your Honor, I think the legislature here was using privacy to refer to the autonomy interest that everyone has to some degree in controlling the flow or the use of information about them."
2010.10-779,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,607.819,633.619,"Counsel, that -- assuming there's some form of privacy that relates to not being harassed because there's certainly legislative record of doctors or groups of doctors testifying to feeling harassed by detailers, if Thompson requires a less restrictive method, why does this have to be an opt-in rather than an opt-out?"
2010.10-779,0,17396,bridget_c_asay,,645.11,653.45,An opt-out would not protect the privacy interests as much because it would assume that doctors want to consent.
2010.10-779,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,655.985,661.37,"Well, but, given the restrictions on speech, why is that a bad thing?"
2010.10-779,0,17396,bridget_c_asay,,690.473,693.491,"--Well, in fact, Your Honor, that's exactly what the State does."
2010.10-779,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,711.036,733.985,"There's another -- there's another purpose that I would like you to comment on, and that is the, the State is interested in promoting the sale of generic drugs and correspondingly to reduce the sale of brand name drugs."
2010.10-779,0,17396,bridget_c_asay,,752.113,756.183,The State does have an interest in reducing health care costs here.
2010.10-779,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,789.654,820.841,"You want to lower -- you want to lower your health care costs, not by direct regulation, but by restricting the flow of information to the doctors, by, to use a pejorative word, but by censoring what they can hear to make sure they don't have full information, so they will do what you want them to do when it comes to prescribing drugs, because you can't take, I gather, direct action and tell them, you must prescribe generics, right?"
2010.10-779,0,17396,bridget_c_asay,,820.841,823.41,"I disagree, Your Honor, for -- for two reasons."
2010.10-779,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,834.583,841.187,"You're restricting their -- you're -- you're making it far more burdensome for the manufacturers to reach their intended audience, right?"
2010.10-779,0,17396,bridget_c_asay,,854.764,856.633,"--I disagree, Your Honor."
2010.10-779,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,864.837,870.273,"Well, I think maybe you're being -- you were the one that made the argument that the State has an interest in reducing health care costs."
2010.10-779,0,17396,bridget_c_asay,,880.414,895.524,"--It's not a restriction on speech because it's a restriction only on the access to the information that the pharmaceutical manufacturers would like to use to inform their advertising, and it's only in play if the doctors have objected to the use."
2010.10-779,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,895.524,899.46,"The information necessary for effective speech is what you're saying, right?"
2010.10-779,0,17396,bridget_c_asay,,899.46,901.578,"Your Honor, it's--"
2010.10-779,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,901.578,905.613,It only restricts the information necessary for really effective speech?
2010.10-779,0,17396,bridget_c_asay,,905.613,906.463,"--No, I disagree."
2010.10-779,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,909.065,924.074,"They're looking for it because it -- it identifies those doctors that they would like to approach with their information which may say, you know, our product is much better than the generic; our quality control is -- you know, whatever."
2010.10-779,0,17396,bridget_c_asay,,935.399,943.155,"--And -- their speech would be more effective if they had access to patient information, if they had access to their competitors' trade secrets."
2010.10-779,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,961.7,963.651,"Well, we'll -- we'll give you -- we seem to have questions."
2010.10-779,0,17396,bridget_c_asay,,989.5,999.992,"--Again, Your Honor, I don't think we disagree that the -- the pharmaceutical manufacturers consider this information useful and helpful in targeting their marketing campaigns."
2010.10-779,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1033.296,1034.379,Can I ask you this question?
2010.10-779,0,17396,bridget_c_asay,,1037.581,1039.45,"Yes, we do, Your Honor."
2010.10-779,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1039.45,1041.783,Did you make that argument below?
2010.10-779,0,17396,bridget_c_asay,,1043.152,1045.103,It is not a change in our position.
2010.10-779,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1056.375,1059.041,But isn't this inconsistent with what you told the court of appeals?
2010.10-779,0,17396,bridget_c_asay,,1059.041,1067.897,"In our court of appeals brief, for example, at page 29 to 30, we describe that sentence of the statute as restricting both the sale of the information and the use for marketing."
2010.10-779,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1069.163,1076.753,So you -- you're representing to us that you told the court of appeals the statute should be interpreted as the SG is interpreting it here; that's your representation?
2010.10-779,0,17396,bridget_c_asay,,1076.753,1084.323,"--It is my representation that -- that we did not say anything contrary to that, Your Honor; and that it really was not pressed below."
2010.10-779,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1093.278,1094.012,"Well, that's an important position."
2010.10-779,0,17396,bridget_c_asay,,1103.903,1112.926,"And again, Your Honor, if I could point also to pages 47 to 48 of our -- of our Second Circuit brief, we did frame the issue as whether there was a right to buy and sell prescription records."
2010.10-779,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1119.894,1127.9,"Well, the court of appeals on page 22a of the petition, summarizing what it understood you to be arguing, says:"
2010.10-779,0,17396,bridget_c_asay,,1142.326,1148.247,"Again, Your Honor, I -- I don't think that the argument was really framed clearly below."
2010.10-779,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1148.647,1150.099,Could you please -- could you please answer yes or no?
2010.10-779,0,17396,bridget_c_asay,,1167.025,1170.561,"--I -- I understand, Your Honor."
2010.10-779,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1170.561,1171.446,And you did not?
2010.10-779,0,17396,bridget_c_asay,,1171.446,1172.013,We did not.
2010.10-779,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1172.013,1180.284,And could you explain how you're going to interpret your statute going forward and apply your statute going forward?
2010.10-779,0,17396,bridget_c_asay,,1180.284,1181.168,"Yes, Your Honor."
2010.10-779,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1214.856,1217.458,We'll afford you 5 minutes for rebuttal.
2010.10-779,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1231.718,1233.836,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2010.10-779,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1309.902,1315.621,"So he's required to provide it, but he would be required to provide it quite apart from the government regulation, right?"
2010.10-779,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1320.125,1321.811,"Well, it's because it's a prescription drug."
2010.10-779,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1360.602,1362.086,But it doesn't protect his privacy.
2010.10-779,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1373.077,1373.594,It -- it--
2010.10-779,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1373.594,1381.516,It protect -- it enables him to protect himself against drug companies that want to talk to him.
2010.10-779,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1381.516,1389.087,"--And that's -- the term ""privacy"" is used to embrace that sort of autonomy and control over information."
2010.10-779,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1390.889,1393.324,"All right, so long as I know that's what you're talking about."
2010.10-779,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1401.394,1401.81,"--Well, he certainly does--"
2010.10-779,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1401.81,1403.327,That is not protected by this law.
2010.10-779,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1403.327,1404.429,--He -- he certainly -- he certainly does care about that.
2010.10-779,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1405.112,1406.196,It's not protected by this law.
2010.10-779,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1406.196,1409.048,"--Well, there are other -- there are other principles that protect it."
2010.10-779,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1414.368,1416.052,I'm talking about what this law protects.
2010.10-779,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1431.58,1445.839,"--Yes, well -- it -- it -- it's a lesser version of that, a less restrictive version of that, because it doesn't put either the pharmaceutical company or the physician in the position of an all-or-nothing situation."
2010.10-779,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1466.92,1472.99,You mean it doesn't even protect his privacy in the sense that it enables him not to have to say go away.
2010.10-779,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1476.192,1477.108,--If he -- if he doesn't--
2010.10-779,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1477.108,1480.227,--if the drug company approaches him without having this information.
2010.10-779,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1480.227,1483.096,--If -- if he doesn't want to talk to the -- to the detailer at all.
2010.10-779,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1483.096,1483.679,All right.
2010.10-779,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1483.679,1499.521,"But what this allows for -- physicians see value to this, but what this allows for is for the physician to say: I don't want my information to be used by this drug company in a way -- sort of inside information about my overall prescribing practices."
2010.10-779,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1506.561,1512.698,"What about the doctor who didn't want the information distributed to anybody, academic researchers, anybody?"
2010.10-779,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1515.233,1520.119,"--It -- it does not, but that's -- that's common in -- in -- in confidentiality statutes."

2010.10-779,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1571.67,1577.723,"--Well, what the statute does is allow the physician -- or the prescriber to make that choice."
2010.10-779,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1583.877,1596.202,"I thought you told me that -- I thought you told me that this doesn't protect physician privacy to the extent of saying this information can't be used for academic purposes even if you, the physician, don't want it to be used for those purposes?"
2010.10-779,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1596.202,1600.423,"Right, and -- and -- and again, that -- that's true in a variety of -- of--"
2010.10-779,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1600.423,1604.291,So the physician doesn't get to decide for what uses the information--
2010.10-779,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1604.291,1615.516,"--Not -- not -- not altogether, but that doesn't mean that there is no confidentiality interest or no autonomy or control interest, because a physician practicing medicine knows that his patient's insurer is going to--"
2010.10-779,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1615.516,1616.233,--What if the statute -- I'm sorry.
2010.10-779,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1625.054,1627.573,"--No, that would not be -- that would not be permissible."
2010.10-779,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1628.606,1637.762,This information -- this information cannot be used for any purposes -- can be used for any purposes except a purpose that will make things more expensive for the State of Vermont?
2010.10-779,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1637.762,1641.916,"--Well, I mean, that's -- that's a very broad goal."
2010.10-779,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1692.516,1697.218,"Well, that's because the pharmaceutical company deems this to be the most efficient."
2010.10-779,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1708.958,1709.56,--But it--
2010.10-779,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1709.56,1715.631,"--but if it becomes -- becomes focused and important and effective, then the State can prohibit it."
2010.10-779,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1715.631,1726.337,"--It's allowing the other person to that representation visit to decide whether information about him, not other information; about him -- will be used in that situation."
2010.10-779,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1739.414,1740.046,What if you say--
2010.10-779,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1740.046,1742.365,--do not use information about me to contact me.
2010.10-779,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1742.365,1747.65,"--Let's say I don't like to be bothered by people knocking on my door by saying, sign this petition."
2010.10-779,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1753.304,1761.077,"No, but you could post a sign saying ""no solicitations"", and I think under this Court's cases that -- that sort of protection--"

2010.10-779,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1769.533,1770.366,Of course not.
2010.10-779,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1770.366,1779.955,"--But I think the State could -- could enact a law that said if someone posts a sign saying do not -- do not approach me, do not knock on my door for this purpose--"
2010.10-779,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1779.955,1782.491,Doctors can do that if they don't want to talk to the--
2010.10-779,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1782.491,1783.693,--If they don't want to talk at all.
2010.10-779,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1821.966,1828.138,"Mr. Kneedler, in most of our commercial speech cases there has been a commodity."
2010.10-779,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1852.484,1855.853,May I answer -- answer the question?
2010.10-779,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1855.853,1856.622,Yes.
2010.10-779,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1856.622,1859.824,It is -- it is in the possession of the pharmacy.
2010.10-779,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1877.016,1880.57,"Thank you, counsel."
2010.10-779,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1885.439,1888.491,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, good morning:"
2010.10-779,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1966.939,1969.422,I asked whether there are sales to any other entities.
2010.10-779,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1969.422,1972.491,"--Yes, and I said the State gave you the accurate answer."
2010.10-779,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1980.662,1985.9,"But if this was a general sale provision, then that would include those sales that you're talking about?"
2010.10-779,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1985.9,1991.387,"It would not, because the point would then -- and I'll come to the statute in a minute, because all the exemptions -- right?"
2010.10-779,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2046.771,2047.587,What was your page again?
2010.10-779,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2047.587,2047.92,--Sorry.
2010.10-779,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2261.554,2269.827,"But there is another interest here besides the State's concern about health care costs, and that is the physician's privacy interests."
2010.10-779,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2269.827,2270.16,Yes.
2010.10-779,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2270.16,2273.295,"You can sell this information to whomever you want, right?"
2010.10-779,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2273.295,2273.829,Yes.
2010.10-779,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2273.829,2280.551,You could sell to it a journalist who wants to expose physicians in a particular area who prescribe a lot of a particular medication.
2010.10-779,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2280.551,2280.935,Yes.
2010.10-779,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2280.935,2288.304,"So the public can discern well, this is the guy who is treating these people; we don't like these people, so we're going to Pickett outside his clinic."
2010.10-779,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2288.304,2288.823,Sure.
2010.10-779,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2288.823,2290.823,"Now, nothing prevents you from doing that, right?"
2010.10-779,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2290.823,2291.858,That's correct.
2010.10-779,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2291.858,2295.394,"Well, don't you think that's protecting physicians' privacy, to prevent that from happening?"
2010.10-779,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2295.394,2296.477,"Oh, I apologize."
2010.10-779,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2348.927,2360.8,"All right, suppose -- suppose that the Federal Trade Commission after a 3-year study of pharmaceutical manufacturing practices, decides -- finds the following."
2010.10-779,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2439.169,2442.954,"I do know -- I don't know, but I do know the First Amendment applies to the rule."
2010.10-779,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2442.954,2444.323,"Oh, nobody says it doesn't apply."
2010.10-779,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2444.923,2445.573,They -- they do.
2010.10-779,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2446.19,2448.858,--I'm not interested in what they're saying for the present purposes.
2010.10-779,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2457.881,2458.214,--Right.
2010.10-779,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2458.214,2460.247,This is a highly regulated industry.
2010.10-779,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2460.247,2460.514,Yes.
2010.10-779,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2460.514,2476.508,"If the Federal Trade Commission's specialists and experts in false and deceptive advertising concludes that this is a false and deceptive practice, are you going to say that the Constitution of the United States forbids them from doing that?"
2010.10-779,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2476.508,2482.346,"I am, but I'm also going to say that I don't have to win that argument to win this case."
2010.10-779,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2482.346,2486.948,"Well -- well, when you say you are, is there any precedent that says they can't regulate false and misleading practice?"
2010.10-779,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2487.983,2488.366,I do.
2010.10-779,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2488.366,2489.466,"If they can, why can't Vermont?"
2010.10-779,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2489.466,2489.966,Sure.
2010.10-779,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2492.399,2492.866,"Well, they said it was biased--"
2010.10-779,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2492.866,2493.251,--I--
2010.10-779,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2493.251,2497.97,--and they -- they have made a study of it in the legislature and that's their conclusion.
2010.10-779,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2497.97,2502.69,--I don't think that the government can say that because speech is so influential it is false and biased.
2010.10-779,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2505.559,2509.678,"I don't take ""biased"" to mean false."
2010.10-779,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2511.712,2512.879,"--Yes, that's exactly right."
2010.10-779,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2513.664,2516.431,You state the true facts only on one side and not the other.
2010.10-779,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2516.431,2516.716,--Right.
2010.10-779,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2516.716,2522.251,"This case has not been argued as a case restricting false advertising, has it?"
2010.10-779,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2522.251,2523.937,"No, it's a case about restricting true advertising."
2010.10-779,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2551.605,2552.456,That's where I was going.
2010.10-779,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2552.456,2552.939,Okay.
2010.10-779,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2552.939,2556.008,I chose an example that's beyond your case.
2010.10-779,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2556.008,2557.158,That's why it's called a hypothetical.
2010.10-779,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2557.158,2559.776,But that's why I wondered how you would respond to that.
2010.10-779,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2568.299,2568.682,Yes.
2010.10-779,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2568.682,2570.001,--is how is this different?
2010.10-779,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2570.001,2570.218,Sure.
2010.10-779,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2570.218,2591.248,"And I suppose I don't know the extent to which this does or does not promote unbiased information from going to the doctors, and isn't that a matter for the doctors themselves and the Vermont legislature rather than this Court to decide?"
2010.10-779,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2591.248,2591.532,Sure.
2010.10-779,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2658.392,2665.963,"Mr. Goldstein, I -- I understand your argument and I have a difficulty."
2010.10-779,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2757.405,2757.905,It can.
2010.10-779,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2905.249,2931.198,"I read in one of the briefs that pharmacies were not permitting either patients and/or doctors to opt out; that if a patient came in and said I don't want my doctor's information sold, or a doctor has called the pharmacy and said, I don't want you to sell my information, the pharmacies are not respecting those limitations."
2010.10-779,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2931.198,2931.817,Well--
2010.10-779,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2931.817,2944.04,"So why don't I read this statute as simply doing what the consumer statutes are doing, which is giving people some control outside of the limited transaction that they're engaged in?"
2010.10-779,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2944.04,2944.474,--Sure.
2010.10-779,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2960.884,2961.919,May I stop you?
2010.10-779,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2961.919,2962.336,Yes.
2010.10-779,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2962.336,2965.871,You say that this statute doesn't give the patient any control.
2010.10-779,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2975.527,2976.346,"I agree, Justice Ginsburg."
2010.10-779,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3031.43,3040.086,"Could the Federal Power -- the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission say, we want you to collect certain information about who is using what natural gas and give it to the fire department?"
2010.10-779,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3048.625,3049.142,--Sure.
2010.10-779,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3049.142,3049.992,They could do that?
2010.10-779,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3049.992,3050.41,Yes.
2010.10-779,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3051.76,3052.01,"All right, fine."
2010.10-779,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3053.512,3057.631,Because the key point in LAPD v. United Reporting is that it's in the hands of the government.
2010.10-779,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3058.831,3065.819,"Well, this is information -- see, this is information that starts off being collected because the government requires it to be collected."
2010.10-779,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3081.413,3082.079,--That's what they say.
2010.10-779,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3108.996,3117.086,Suppose you had a statute in which the pharmacy cannot give the information or sell the information to anybody; it must remain with the pharmacy.
2010.10-779,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3117.086,3117.502,Yes.
2010.10-779,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3117.502,3121.74,A copy of the prescription must be given to the State of Vermont.
2010.10-779,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3129.71,3131.279,That would be LAPD.
2010.10-779,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3134.131,3135.933,And what -- and I want to know what your answer would be.
2010.10-779,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3138.785,3139.368,Right.
2010.10-779,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3139.368,3143.403,--Then what ruling would we have to make in my hypothetical case?
2010.10-779,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3143.403,3143.753,Sure.
2010.10-779,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3224.121,3235.429,So what you're saying I think to Justice Kennedy is answering my earlier question by saying the State cannot constitutionally stop the spread of information.
2010.10-779,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3246.219,3248.904,--I am saying that that's unconstitutional.
2010.10-779,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3282.494,3288.279,So you're really -- you are really hinging your argument on the discrimination aspect--
2010.10-779,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3288.279,3288.848,I am--
2010.10-779,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3288.848,3295.652,--that -- that drug companies or detailers are being treated differently than any other user of this information?
2010.10-779,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3295.652,3297.587,--That is a principal part of our argument.
2010.10-779,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3475.885,3479.487,It used to be true there was something called a regulated industry.
2010.10-779,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3479.487,3479.871,--Yes.
2010.10-779,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3479.871,3482.471,And selling was simply one activity among many.
2010.10-779,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3482.471,3482.754,Sure.
2010.10-779,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3482.754,3486.125,And there were lots of regulations that could be imposed upon selling.
2010.10-779,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3486.125,3486.825,"Sure, right."
2010.10-779,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3486.825,3489.893,Are you saying that all those should be reexamined?
2010.10-779,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3489.893,3491.493,I -- I thankfully am not.
2010.10-779,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3525.4,3536.124,"You would have no objection I take it, if there were not the academic exception and if the State didn't -- didn't push its own contrary program?"
