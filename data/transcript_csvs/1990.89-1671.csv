1990.89-1671,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,11.65,"We'll hear argument first this morning in No. 89-1671, The City of Columbia and Columbia Outdoor Advertising v. Omni Outdoor Advertising."
1990.89-1671,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,12.629,15.642,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.89-1671,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,141.655,147.897,What do you think would have happened if the court of appeals would have held if the State had passed this statute?
1990.89-1671,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,147.897,151.539,"--My, my understanding from the rationale is that they would have reached the same result."
1990.89-1671,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,151.539,152.05,Exactly.
1990.89-1671,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,152.05,153.221,That is my view.
1990.89-1671,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,153.221,157.474,"Well, then if you say we all agree, we've already decided the case."
1990.89-1671,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,157.474,159.955,"Well, I, I think that is the answer."
1990.89-1671,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,159.955,160.416,So you shouldn't say that.
1990.89-1671,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,161.507,165.378,"Well, I think, Your Honor, though that there are two questions."
1990.89-1671,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,172.524,173.866,--But the court of appeals would have reached the same--
1990.89-1671,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,173.866,174.935,"--That, that is my view."
1990.89-1671,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,174.935,175.315,--All right.
1990.89-1671,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,176.547,181.67,"And I think the answer is as you suggest, Justice White, that that's what Town of Hallie compels."
1990.89-1671,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,250.235,253.057,"Well, what if the city council had been bribed?"
1990.89-1671,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,253.057,258.11,"Your Honor, our view is that if the city council had been bribed that would not be an antitrust violation."
1990.89-1671,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,259.512,262.153,So you would say that Parker still applies?
1990.89-1671,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,262.153,262.732,--Absolutely.
1990.89-1671,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,262.732,263.072,Sure.
1990.89-1671,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,263.523,266.915,And we think that for several reasons.
1990.89-1671,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,267.406,271.139,"I think you have to say that, I take it, on your theory."
1990.89-1671,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,271.139,272.278,--Under my first theory I have to say it.
1990.89-1671,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,341.135,350.57,"But Mr. Klein, do you think that the zoning power would give the city the authority to grant a exclusive franchise in the billboard advertising field to a particular company?"
1990.89-1671,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,350.57,353.552,"--I, I think it might, Your Honor."
1990.89-1671,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,361.076,367.451,You think it has the power to grant... say it was given an exclusive franchise in all the restaurants in town so that presumably it could zone restaurants.
1990.89-1671,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,372.954,376.407,"--No question that would, that would violate the commerce clause presumably--"
1990.89-1671,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,376.407,377.789,"Well, what about the antitrust law?"
1990.89-1671,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,377.789,380.481,--I don't believe it would if it was properly authorized under Hallie.
1990.89-1671,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,380.481,387.423,"Well, but would it be properly authorized under Hallie simply because the State had give the city the zoning power?"
1990.89-1671,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,394.829,396.059,I think it could.
1990.89-1671,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,405.075,408.267,That you can give them... give all the business to one particular--
1990.89-1671,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,408.267,410.999,--The city would take that approach consistent with the antitrust laws.
1990.89-1671,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,411.57,419.945,"--Mr. Klein, what you said about bribery suggested to me a question similar to Justice Stevens'."
1990.89-1671,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,433.444,435.425,I think--
1990.89-1671,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,435.425,435.746,It's invalid.
1990.89-1671,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,438.678,445.911,"--I think it wouldn't be because frankly... if I can fight the premise, Justice Scalia... I don't think that it wouldn't be State action."
1990.89-1671,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,469.586,478.004,"Well, it doesn't, it doesn't determine what State action for those constitutional purposes, but it might well determine what States... what is State action for purposes of Parker."
1990.89-1671,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,478.004,483.718,"But, but I, I don't think that's consistent with Bates and frankly that is, I think, that's flatly what the Court held in Bates."
1990.89-1671,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,545.128,553.302,"Mr. Klein, could I go back to Justice Stevens' question and inquiry."
1990.89-1671,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,560.638,563.149,"That's correct, Justice O'Connor."
1990.89-1671,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,563.149,564.689,And there's no cross appeal--
1990.89-1671,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,564.689,566.211,"That, that issue--"
1990.89-1671,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,566.211,566.692,--on that.
1990.89-1671,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,566.692,568.583,--that's not been argued before this Court.
1990.89-1671,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,568.583,578.41,"Although the respondent does raise in a, a footnote, I believe, the argument again, that Town of Hallie doesn't even apply."
1990.89-1671,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,578.41,580.21,That is correct as well.
1990.89-1671,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,580.21,581.801,"Do we need to address that, do you think?"
1990.89-1671,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,581.801,583.794,"I, I don't believe you do, but if--"
1990.89-1671,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,583.794,602.035,I mean if we have the concerns that Justice Stevens expressed that perhaps a zoning ordinance authority does not enable towns to purposely exclude everybody but one from a particular business.
1990.89-1671,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,602.035,611.429,"--Well, Your Honor, I don't think the issue is here, but I think if the issue was here the answer is clear and let me, let me make, make that... what I mean by that paren."
1990.89-1671,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,743.438,751.743,"I suppose that you would say that, that this city council just went to a lot of trouble for nothing."
1990.89-1671,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,760.147,762.428,"--I think that's true under the antitrust laws, Justice White."
1990.89-1671,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,762.428,765.06,"Yes, it may not be consistent with State laws or something--"
1990.89-1671,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,765.06,765.511,Maybe--
1990.89-1671,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,765.511,767.353,"--but as far as the antitrust laws, they can do that."
1990.89-1671,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,767.353,770.345,--And it may violate the commerce clause or other provisions.
1990.89-1671,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,787.897,794.148,"Yeah, but do you think the zoning ordinance... the power to zone normally implicitly includes the power to grant exclusive franchises?"
1990.89-1671,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,794.148,796.632,"--I don't... I think, I think it may--"
1990.89-1671,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,796.632,796.902,I think you do.
1990.89-1671,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,796.902,798.963,"--depending on the circumstances, yes."
1990.89-1671,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,798.963,800.103,"Well, what are the circumstances?"
1990.89-1671,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,800.103,803.735,The circumstances are that if the city decides that one company--
1990.89-1671,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,803.735,804.916,If the city decides it wants to do it.
1990.89-1671,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,811.422,813.032,"--It, it does have that authority I think."
1990.89-1671,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,813.903,817.904,Just in franchises and fast food operations and billboards and--
1990.89-1671,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,817.904,818.725,--Under the antitrust--
1990.89-1671,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,818.725,821.047,"--motion picture theaters, all because they have the power to zone."
1990.89-1671,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,821.047,823.11,"--Under the antitrust laws and I, I think--"
1990.89-1671,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,823.11,836.236,"Yeah, but Mr. Klein, the... I thought the Parker rule always required that the State statute clearly articulate, very clearly articulate that the locality may replace competition with noncompetition."
1990.89-1671,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,836.236,838.229,"--Well, that I think is a necessary consequence of zoning."
1990.89-1671,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,842.09,845.573,It... that may not be a clear articulation of local power.
1990.89-1671,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,845.573,859.322,"--It may not, but I think this one was clear and I also would suggest that every zoning ordinance, if in fact there is a single chain and the city passes an ordinance, it's going to protect it just like a taxicab franchise and so forth."
1990.89-1671,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,861.014,864.067,"Well, the taxicab franchise authority doesn't rest on the zoning power."
1990.89-1671,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,864.067,864.667,"--No, it doesn't."
1990.89-1671,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,864.667,868.418,"It rests, rests on a deliberate decision to have one operator in a particular field of business."
1990.89-1671,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,873.663,875.403,The city hasn't make that decision either.
1990.89-1671,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,875.403,877.413,Or has it delegated the power to the city?
1990.89-1671,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,877.413,879.446,The city has made a decision that there shall be--
1990.89-1671,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,879.446,880.265,There shall be zoning.
1990.89-1671,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,880.265,884.389,"--spacing and let me look at Town of Hallie for you, because the Court was unanimous there."
1990.89-1671,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,927.496,929.238,Could I ask you a certain... before you do that.
1990.89-1671,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,933.49,934.282,"--Yes, yes, they were."
1990.89-1671,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,934.702,935.223,Okay.
1990.89-1671,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,935.223,946.19,"Now if, if I, if I might then I, I think much of the discussion about whether there's a coconspiracy exception so to speak, it's two sides of the same coin so I think it applies here."
1990.89-1671,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1066.478,1068.08,"Very well, Mr. Klein."
1990.89-1671,1,16419,a_camden_lewis,,1070.254,1080.849,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.89-1671,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1167.837,1170.169,I thought that was from Parker?
1990.89-1671,1,16419,a_camden_lewis,,1170.169,1172.609,This is for Noerr.
1990.89-1671,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1172.609,1172.919,All right.
1990.89-1671,1,16419,a_camden_lewis,,1172.919,1174.519,You... I would go back to Parker.
1990.89-1671,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1176.382,1177.033,Okay.
1990.89-1671,1,16419,a_camden_lewis,,1177.473,1179.074,--because that's just the way my notes ran.
1990.89-1671,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1211.856,1215.297,"Well, what are you saying was a sham here, Mr. Lewis?"
1990.89-1671,1,16419,a_camden_lewis,,1215.297,1227.447,"Okay, what am I... I'm saying is the sham is the efforts and the... really if you want to get down to it, it's the prior agreement, the 1980 agreement."
1990.89-1671,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1227.447,1233.59,"Well, that's, that's not a... to say that an agreement was, was a sham is not consistent with our cases."
1990.89-1671,1,16419,a_camden_lewis,,1242.625,1243.636,"No, sir--"
1990.89-1671,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1243.636,1248.538,"Certainly these people had not only a hope of success, they succeeded with the city council."
1990.89-1671,1,16419,a_camden_lewis,,1248.538,1255.043,"--On, on one they succeeded in the city council on one of the two ordinances."
1990.89-1671,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1276.968,1282.212,"How does that have anything to do with the sham exception, that they gave favors for billboards?"
1990.89-1671,1,16419,a_camden_lewis,,1282.212,1300.884,"--Because as I read the sham exception, the sham exception comes to play when the conduct that the individuals use is directed toward the foreclosure of the citizen from meaningful access to the legislative decision making process."
1990.89-1671,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1333.426,1338.588,"Well, where, where does all this language that you're using come from that they usurped the process, they shut down the process?"
1990.89-1671,1,16419,a_camden_lewis,,1339.827,1340.919,Some of them and they--
1990.89-1671,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1340.919,1345.982,"Well, what, what cases of ours do those two phrases that you just used come from?"
1990.89-1671,1,16419,a_camden_lewis,,1345.982,1348.513,"--Okay, biased the process comes from Allied Tube."
1990.89-1671,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1409.104,1414.286,You were certainly able to make your views known to the city's representatives.
1990.89-1671,1,16419,a_camden_lewis,,1421.663,1422.494,--We were able--
1990.89-1671,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1422.494,1423.222,"Were, were you able?"
1990.89-1671,1,16419,a_camden_lewis,,1423.543,1425.774,--We were able to go there--
1990.89-1671,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1425.774,1428.137,Were you able to make your views known to them?
1990.89-1671,1,16419,a_camden_lewis,,1428.137,1428.535,"--No, sir."
1990.89-1671,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1430.458,1433.831,"I, I thought the record showed otherwise that--"
1990.89-1671,1,16419,a_camden_lewis,,1433.831,1439.485,"The record shows that we went to meetings that were closed, that were predetermined, that there was no ability for us to participate."
1990.89-1671,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1439.485,1440.754,"--Well, okay... just, just a minute."
1990.89-1671,1,16419,a_camden_lewis,,1446.097,1452.612,"Closed in the fact that they... we went there and if you'll read the record, they said when we got there we were told what it would be."
1990.89-1671,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1455.473,1459.227,"That, that's quite different from being unable to make your views known."
1990.89-1671,1,16419,a_camden_lewis,,1467.872,1477.7,"Yes, sir, I think that if you have... if everybody sits there and they have their ears covered up and they turn their back to you and they say that you have the ability to talk, you might as well be talking to the wall."
1990.89-1671,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1479.95,1484.264,"Well, that will make a lot of legislative committee hearings subject to some sanctions."
1990.89-1671,1,16419,a_camden_lewis,,1484.472,1485.023,"--No, sir."
1990.89-1671,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1524.8,1525.481,Mr. Lewis?
1990.89-1671,1,16419,a_camden_lewis,,1525.481,1525.96,"Yes, sir."
1990.89-1671,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1525.96,1529.622,Is your only complaint that you were outmaneuvered?
1990.89-1671,1,16419,a_camden_lewis,,1529.622,1533.485,"No, sir, we never got a chance to maneuver."
1990.89-1671,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1533.485,1534.836,Was any money exchanged?
1990.89-1671,1,16419,a_camden_lewis,,1534.836,1535.817,There were--
1990.89-1671,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1535.817,1537.696,In the record?
1990.89-1671,1,16419,a_camden_lewis,,1537.696,1538.287,"--Yes, sir."
1990.89-1671,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1538.287,1540.899,What was it?
1990.89-1671,1,16419,a_camden_lewis,,1540.899,1558.112,"All right, in the record you will find and contrary to Mr. Klein, there were free billboard space or discounted billboard space given to the councilmen which they did not... and you can look at it... they did not report as campaign contributions."
1990.89-1671,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1560.023,1560.694,How much was that?
1990.89-1671,1,16419,a_camden_lewis,,1560.694,1572.131,"--That would vary according to the particular councilman, but it would go anywhere from $300 up to $1,000."
1990.89-1671,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1580.035,1581.905,"They got paid $1,000."
1990.89-1671,1,16419,a_camden_lewis,,1585.017,1589.602,"--Well, there was different people had different amounts of free advertising space."
1990.89-1671,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1589.602,1591.492,"All together it was $1,000?"
1990.89-1671,1,16419,a_camden_lewis,,1591.492,1595.025,"Maybe $1,500 altogether."
1990.89-1671,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1595.025,1596.087,"Maybe $1,500."
1990.89-1671,1,16419,a_camden_lewis,,1596.087,1596.507,Yes.
1990.89-1671,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1596.507,1597.376,And that's all we're talking about?
1990.89-1671,1,16419,a_camden_lewis,,1597.376,1599.487,"We're talking about... well, we're talking about--"
1990.89-1671,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1599.487,1600.619,That's a real horrible deal.
1990.89-1671,1,16419,a_camden_lewis,,1600.619,1602.699,"--No, sir, we're talking about more than that."
1990.89-1671,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1620.531,1622.974,They got this monopoly for free?
1990.89-1671,1,16419,a_camden_lewis,,1622.974,1627.016,They got the... they got the monopoly's power.
1990.89-1671,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1636.493,1641.014,"Well, how does that get to the Parker case if they do something for free?"
1990.89-1671,1,16419,a_camden_lewis,,1641.014,1641.295,All right.
1990.89-1671,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1642.266,1643.618,If they do something for free--
1990.89-1671,1,16419,a_camden_lewis,,1643.618,1670.314,"--If we go back over to Parker, you're coming in now and I do not agree that the Hallie, whether or not this is a State action or not State action is closed, because to get to Parker by its very nature you have to first determine, and we have in our footnote raised that question that's been fully briefed in the court below, and we do not believe for one instance that the zoning laws of the State of South Carolina allow for this economic--"
1990.89-1671,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1670.314,1673.786,"--You didn't cross-petition for certiorari though, did you?"
1990.89-1671,1,16419,a_camden_lewis,,1673.786,1692.479,--We did not cross-petition for certiorari because in the petition for certiorari they raised the question of Parker and to get to the Parker particular question you must necessarily raise the question of whether Parker on its very foundation has met that requirement that it's State action.
1990.89-1671,2,31305,joel_i_klein,,2780.06,2784.032,"Very briefly, Mr. Chief Justice."
1990.89-1671,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2811.459,2816.014,"Mr. Klein, would you help me on the defendant's requested charge that your opponent referred to?"
1990.89-1671,2,31305,joel_i_klein,,2818.044,2824.269,"--I don't, Your Honor, but it came after a variety of other legal positions had been rejected."
1990.89-1671,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2824.269,2826.179,So you don't endorse that position anymore?
1990.89-1671,2,31305,joel_i_klein,,2826.179,2826.73,"We don't, no, sir."
1990.89-1671,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2850.465,2851.775,"More, more, more than one billboard?"
1990.89-1671,2,31305,joel_i_klein,,2851.775,2853.678,--There were six billboards.
1990.89-1671,2,31305,joel_i_klein,,2853.678,2854.109,Six billboards.
1990.89-1671,2,31305,joel_i_klein,,2854.109,2854.927,Six billboards.
1990.89-1671,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2905.772,2918.811,"Mr. Klein, are telling us, because this is such a sharp contradiction here, that there is nothing in the record to support your opponent's claim that there were some either discounted billboards or free billboards provided that were not declared?"
1990.89-1671,2,31305,joel_i_klein,,2918.811,2921.533,There were none that were not declared.
1990.89-1671,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2927.647,2930.399,"Well, you can kind of say yes or no, I think, to my question."
1990.89-1671,2,31305,joel_i_klein,,2930.399,2934.531,"--They were declared as expenditures which they were paid for, the ones that were discounted."
1990.89-1671,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2934.531,2942.015,"In other words, if they... if the price was $1,000 and they paid $600, they reported the payment of $600, but they did not report the fact they got a $400 discount."
1990.89-1671,2,31305,joel_i_klein,,2942.015,2942.295,That's correct.
1990.89-1671,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2942.295,2942.626,I see.
1990.89-1671,2,31305,joel_i_klein,,2942.626,2949.209,"Okay, now, and one of the three people who is identified as a so-called conspirator received no campaign contributions."
1990.89-1671,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2981.381,2986.364,"Mr. Klein, would this case have come out the same way in the Fifth and Eighth Circuits?"
1990.89-1671,2,31305,joel_i_klein,,2986.364,2987.606,In the Eighth Circuit?
1990.89-1671,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2987.606,2988.005,Yeah.
1990.89-1671,2,31305,joel_i_klein,,2988.005,2989.327,I don't believe it would in the Eighth Circuit.
1990.89-1671,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2991.227,2992.059,How about the Fifth?
1990.89-1671,2,31305,joel_i_klein,,2992.059,2996.5,In the Fifth this case probably would have come out under Affiliated Capital the same way.
1990.89-1671,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3002.504,3010.161,"Have there... are there cases that would show that, that are in direct conflict with the decision alone?"
1990.89-1671,2,31305,joel_i_klein,,3010.161,3010.522,--With this decision?
1990.89-1671,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3010.522,3010.852,Yes.
1990.89-1671,2,31305,joel_i_klein,,3010.852,3013.934,"Yes, there's a case by Justice Kennedy in the Ninth Circuit."
1990.89-1671,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3020.025,3025.941,"Is the Fifth Circuit the only one that is, that has so recognized a so-called conspirator?"
1990.89-1671,2,31305,joel_i_klein,,3025.941,3026.26,Coconspirator exception?
1990.89-1671,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3026.26,3026.64,Yes.
1990.89-1671,2,31305,joel_i_klein,,3026.64,3033.816,"I believe that's so, although a variety of... even in the Fifth Circuit, there's some inconsistencies, but I believe they are... now they in the Fourth."
1990.89-1671,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3033.816,3035.527,The Eighth has never approached--
1990.89-1671,2,31305,joel_i_klein,,3035.527,3043.981,"The Eighth in a case called Kay Jeer I think has talked about it but not with the same clarity as the Fourth, that is, it hasn't demarked the lines."
1990.89-1671,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3043.981,3050.336,"--Well, there's some pretty interesting language in the Eighth Circuit case against you, isn't there?"
1990.89-1671,2,31305,joel_i_klein,,3050.336,3052.526,"There is some language, that's correct."
1990.89-1671,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3054.448,3059.361,Did either party request instructions on the elements and definition of bribery?
1990.89-1671,2,31305,joel_i_klein,,3059.361,3062.103,"No party requested such instructions, Justice Kennedy."
1990.89-1671,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3063.636,3065.152,"Thank you, Mr. Klein."
