1969.628,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,47.213,"We'll hear 628, Schacht against the United States."
1969.628,0,20584,david_h_berg,,49.852,52.991,Mr. Chief Justice and May it please the Court.
1969.628,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,131.966,133.892,Has he served his present sentence?
1969.628,0,20584,david_h_berg,,133.892,139.652,"No sir, he has not."
1969.628,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,139.652,141.87,"He hasn't served any part of it, this --"
1969.628,0,20584,david_h_berg,,141.87,143.177,"Well, in avertedly, he did."
1969.628,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,202.264,213.538,I notice counsel that you describe this in your factual statement as a demonstration in front of the recruiting headquarters or some such thing.
1969.628,0,20584,david_h_berg,,218.775,220.067,"Your Honor, we do make that claim."
1969.628,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,228.369,236.136,"Well then -- then you're describing this is a demonstration, was not intended to preclude your claim in --"
1969.628,0,20584,david_h_berg,,236.136,236.218,No.
1969.628,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,236.218,239.211,-- your brief that I wondered if you were changing your position?
1969.628,0,20584,david_h_berg,,239.211,242.146,"As it where a play within a play, within a demonstration."
1969.628,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,242.146,247.242,"Well, I think if you're right about that, you don't need to be (Inaudible)."
1969.628,0,20584,david_h_berg,,247.242,250.035,"Yes Your Honor, we still reach a constitutional question."
1969.628,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,250.035,251.996,"The trial judge instructed on the matter, --"
1969.628,0,20584,david_h_berg,,251.996,252.202,Yes.
1969.628,0,20584,david_h_berg,,257.261,262.572,And that -- and incidentally that charge were submitted by the government's attorney.
1969.628,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,262.572,265.322,"Yes, so you did get the benefit of that instruction, did you?"
1969.628,0,20584,david_h_berg,,265.322,266.66,"Yes, we did, at the trial—"
1969.628,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,266.66,268.091,Rightly or wrongly?
1969.628,0,20584,david_h_berg,,268.091,268.881,Yes sir.
1969.628,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,268.881,273.113,"You say rightly, the government says wrongly although you're not telling us that it was at the government requests?"
1969.628,0,20584,david_h_berg,,273.113,273.736,That's correct.
1969.628,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,273.736,275.092,"Well, I still, I'm sorry."
1969.628,0,20584,david_h_berg,,286.693,295.229,Because the statutory scheme graded by the exception itself is unconstitutional.
1969.628,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,301.114,305.123,"Yes, but if this is a prosecution that is for violating a statute?"
1969.628,0,20584,david_h_berg,,305.123,305.621,Yes.
1969.628,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,305.621,311.835,"And it's a statute which says it can't be any prosecution if you fall within an exception, is that right?"
1969.628,0,20584,david_h_berg,,311.835,312.121,Yes sir.
1969.628,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,312.121,317.037,"And if you fall within the exception, why isn't that the end of the case, you couldn't be prosecuted, you couldn't be convicted?"
1969.628,0,20584,david_h_berg,,317.037,321.953,"Well, in this instance, he was granted the -- he was given a submission on that issue."
1969.628,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,326.476,332.651,"Well, so you're up against a jury finding that that you're not within the exception?"
1969.628,0,20584,david_h_berg,,332.651,337.204,No sir that we can't tell from the case either.
1969.628,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,337.204,339.619,"After this, you had a general verdict and you can't of identify the jury --"
1969.628,0,20584,david_h_berg,,339.619,341.442,"That's correct, under the holding of a straight case."
1969.628,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,348.388,348.841,"Yeah, well, --"
1969.628,0,20584,david_h_berg,,348.841,355.787,Someone wearing distinctive parts and if that be the case then that part -- we feel that part of the exception is clearly is unconstitutional.
1969.628,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,355.787,358.033,"Well, I gather the facts are not in dispute, are they?"
1969.628,0,20584,david_h_berg,,358.033,359.076,"No sir, for the most part--"
1969.628,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,359.076,365.375,"Well, I suppose -- suppose we were to feel that on the basis of the facts there was no issue for the jury?"
1969.628,0,20584,david_h_berg,,365.871,368.725,If there is no issue for the jury on the basis of the fact--
1969.628,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,368.725,368.994,That should fall within the exception?
1969.628,0,20584,david_h_berg,,368.994,370.135,-- as with the exception.
1969.628,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,370.135,370.376,Yeah.
1969.628,0,20584,david_h_berg,,370.376,373.695,Then we still have to deal with whether or not there's a compelling interest.
1969.628,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,373.695,377.004,"You're awfully anxious to get a constitutionalist, you're not at this, aren't you?"
1969.628,0,20584,david_h_berg,,377.004,377.539,Yes sir.
1969.628,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,377.539,380.617,You're not as concerned to get your fellow off?
1969.628,0,20584,david_h_berg,,380.617,381.027,Yes.
1969.628,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,383.892,392.519,"I get it nice, but if we can decide that it has come within the exception, that's the end of the case, isn't it if your man is off?"
1969.628,0,20584,david_h_berg,,392.519,400.59,"Your Honor, if the facts of the case clearly indicate that he fell within the exception, we have no way of knowing still whether or not that exception --"
1969.628,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,400.59,404.502,I know but if that says it should've gone to the jury and that the conviction therefore --
1969.628,0,20584,david_h_berg,,404.502,404.647,It did go to the jury.
1969.628,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,404.647,406.522,"-- should be set aside, that's the end of the case, isn't it?"
1969.628,0,20584,david_h_berg,,406.522,409.319,"Unless I misunderstand sir, it did go to the jury?"
1969.628,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,409.319,417.882,Alright.
1969.628,0,20584,david_h_berg,,417.882,430.558,"Under the holding of the O'Brien decision, it's our contention whether or not he's entitled to an instruction on the statutory -- the exception to the main statute."
1969.628,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,439.829,463.566,"When -- sorry to interrupt you again Mr. Berg but when you told that my brother Brennan that there was no substantial dispute as to the facts in this case, does that mean that you do concede that your client was wearing the uniform or a distinctive part thereof of any of the Armed Forces of the United States?"
1969.628,0,20584,david_h_berg,,463.566,471.471,"Mr. Justice Stewart I would concede only that he had on parts of a military uniform but not characterize it, it was distinctive."
1969.628,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,471.471,482.613,"Well, it has to be, that either as I read it, it has to be the uniform which I suppose would mean the complete uniform or a distinctive part thereof, isn't that what the statute said?"
1969.628,0,20584,david_h_berg,,482.613,484.646,"Yes, yes sir."
1969.628,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,484.646,489.216,And as -- do you or don't you concede that the --
1969.628,0,20584,david_h_berg,,489.216,495.251,"Well, one of the questions we raised sir is that we don't know what word distinctive part means and we don't know whether --"
1969.628,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,495.251,503.618,"Well, I suppose khaki colored socks for instance would not be a distinctive part of the army uniform, although soldiers do wear khaki colored socks."
1969.628,0,20584,david_h_berg,,503.618,505.154,Yes sir.
1969.628,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,505.154,507.543,Or a handkerchief --
1969.628,0,20584,david_h_berg,,507.543,508.082,Yes.
1969.628,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,508.082,514.203,"-- or maybe under -- an under short or underwear, I would know but tan shoes."
1969.628,0,20584,david_h_berg,,514.203,522.784,"It doesn't to -- excuse me sir, it doesn't really matter to us if we want to characterize it as having worn a distinctive part, our point we feel is still the same."
1969.628,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,522.854,542.953,"Well, I'm not sure -- I'm not sure that I understand you because -- and I'm not sure whether -- that I understand whether you do or whether you don't concede that the dress, the garment in which the petitioner was dressed at this time was within the statutory definition?"
1969.628,0,20584,david_h_berg,,542.953,549.507,"Well, if I understand the question correctly, the question is whether or not the fact is in dispute that he was wearing a distinctive part of the uniform."
1969.628,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,549.507,551.517,The uniform or a distinctive part of there.
1969.628,0,20584,david_h_berg,,555.875,559.469,"Alright, and it's our contention that that's one of the problems of the statute."
1969.628,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,568.756,571.287,"Well, the jury must have found that he was?"
1969.628,0,20584,david_h_berg,,571.287,572.701,Yes.
1969.628,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,572.701,577.033,"They certainly didn't find he was wearing a complete uniform, did they?"
1969.628,0,20584,david_h_berg,,577.033,579.887,"Your Honor, from the verdict that was returned, we can only assume that--"
1969.628,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,579.887,583.835,But there wasn't any evidence at all or whatsoever that he was wearing an entire uniform?
1969.628,0,20584,david_h_berg,,583.835,584.436,No.
1969.628,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,589.468,593.931,Or a distinctive -- well they at least found that he was wearing a distinctive part?
1969.628,0,20584,david_h_berg,,593.931,595.62,Yes.
1969.628,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,596.414,599.039,In order to convict?
1969.628,0,20584,david_h_berg,,599.039,599.967,Pardon me sir.
1969.628,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,599.967,603.803,"In order to convict, does that defines that?"
1969.628,0,20584,david_h_berg,,603.803,605.252,Yes sir.
1969.628,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,607.437,609.841,What did the evidence show he was wearing?
1969.628,0,20584,david_h_berg,,609.841,612.205,An eagle insignia turned upside down.
1969.628,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,612.205,612.747,He what?
1969.628,0,20584,david_h_berg,,612.747,617.651,An eagle insignia turned upside down on an obsolete World War II hat.
1969.628,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,621.439,623.3,What kind of blouse?
1969.628,0,20584,david_h_berg,,623.3,624.51,An army blouse.
1969.628,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,624.51,625.355,Yeah.
1969.628,0,20584,david_h_berg,,625.355,626.593,Buttons on the blouse?
1969.628,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,626.593,628.462,What kind of buttons?
1969.628,0,20584,david_h_berg,,628.462,636.486,Military buttons on the blouse and the cap he uses I remember were not military issue and some civilian boots.
1969.628,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,636.486,641.174,And the eagle -- you said an eagle turned upside down.
1969.628,0,20584,david_h_berg,,641.703,642.133,Spread eagle.
1969.628,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,642.133,645.015,-- that's not only out of commissioned officer's cap in the United State army?
1969.628,0,20584,david_h_berg,,645.015,646.381,The spread eagle.
1969.628,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,646.381,648.337,Is that -- is that company?
1969.628,0,20584,david_h_berg,,648.337,654.234,Yes sir.
1969.628,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,732.579,739.993,"What should we draw from that, that the government has been negligent in enforcing this statute or just what's your point?"
1969.628,0,20584,david_h_berg,,739.993,745.299,"Our point, my point that there's some evidence the government is not interested enforcing the statute."
1969.628,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,745.299,752.078,"Well, what should the Court do about that when it gets a case where they are interested in enforcing it?"
1969.628,0,20584,david_h_berg,,752.078,765.558,"In this particular case, we feel it's evidence of the government's lack of a compelling interest in impinging his First Amendment, in regulating the wear and therefore impinging his rights, constitutional rights."
1969.628,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,765.558,775.795,Is there -- I suppose there is and would you know if there is other federal legislation on making it a criminal offense to impersonate an officer or an enlisted man in the army?
1969.628,0,20584,david_h_berg,,776.21,778.143,"Yes sir, I believe that there is a statute."
1969.628,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,778.143,778.4,There is.
1969.628,0,20584,david_h_berg,,778.4,786.012,"About the impersonation, is there, and that would be our point that this type -- this kind of protection could be garnered for the government and more narrow stand."
1969.628,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,786.012,788.554,And you say there is such a narrow -- more narrowly drawn stand?
1969.628,0,20584,david_h_berg,,788.554,799.152,I believe that there is a penalty for personating an officer that applies to civilian just for making a meal ticket of the uniform one way or another.
1969.628,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,876.504,879.875,Is there any indication in the record as to where he acquired this clothing?
1969.628,0,20584,david_h_berg,,879.875,882.456,"No sir, there is none."
1969.628,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,882.456,902.847,"Going back to your point for a moment to -- about the compelling interest, I don't recall many events on but I don't recall in the last 14 years any frequency of prosecutions for impersonating a federal agent."
1969.628,0,20584,david_h_berg,,915.601,928.511,"Yes of course that inference could be drawn, but we say that that doesn't preclude us from the other inference that the government simply has -- because of the widespread wearing of the parts of the uniform, the government has lost its interest in enforcing the statute."
1969.628,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,928.511,932.185,What evidence you have in this record of widespread use?
1969.628,0,20584,david_h_berg,,932.185,939.614,"Your Honor, we have the evidence that it's sold on a wholesale basis throughout the nation to whomever walks in the store and we ask the Court to take judicial notice."
1969.628,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,939.614,943.106,With the military insignia and buttons on it?
1969.628,0,20584,david_h_berg,,943.106,943.726,"Yes Your Honor, there's nothing to controvert --"
1969.628,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,943.726,945.135,Or removed?
1969.628,0,20584,david_h_berg,,945.135,946.24,Pardon me sir.
1969.628,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,946.24,949.185,Or are they removed before the sale?
1969.628,0,20584,david_h_berg,,949.185,967.152,"There's nothing in the evidence to indicate which way, but we feel that's not -- that that wouldn't be a question in the case because one could still fall within the proscription of the statute by wearing parts -- that are distinctive parts of the uniform."
1969.628,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1151.471,1156.432,"Mr. Berg, do you know anything of the legislative history of the statute of this legislation?"
1969.628,0,20584,david_h_berg,,1156.432,1164.165,"Your Honor, it was enacted in 1916 with -- and we were unable to obtain any of the history at that time."
1969.628,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1164.165,1166.05,During World War I.
1969.628,0,20584,david_h_berg,,1166.05,1166.758,Yes sir.
1969.628,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1172.408,1175.723,Any history relevant that you could find --
1969.628,0,20584,david_h_berg,,1175.723,1190.349,The only history that I've seen was in testimony that was introduced by the government in its brief which said that there was no intention to subsequently change the law.
1969.628,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1283.427,1286.765,Did you know what he was wearing?
1969.628,0,20584,david_h_berg,,1286.765,1300.54,"Well he -- that of course -- with that of course is the point is to whether he was entitled to a submission, but at least he admitted that point and I was -- in my point that we -- I would ask this Court to find that that part was unconstitutional."
1969.628,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1520.601,1524.373,Now you -- the words you're according where spoken by whom and when?
1969.628,0,20584,david_h_berg,,1524.373,1526.369,The prosecuting attorney in the closing argument.
1969.628,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1526.369,1527.102,At the closing argument that you --
1969.628,0,20584,david_h_berg,,1527.102,1531.844,And prior to that the -- one of the prosecuting attorney since submitting the charge.
1969.628,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1581.516,1584.001,Was there any violence in connection with this --
1969.628,0,20584,david_h_berg,,1584.001,1584.373,None whatsoever sir.
1969.628,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1584.373,1587.404,-- episode?
1969.628,0,20584,david_h_berg,,1587.404,1587.669,No sir.
1969.628,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1587.669,1588.828,"Threats, shouting anyone?"
1969.628,0,20584,david_h_berg,,1588.828,1589.159,No sir.
1969.628,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1595.238,1599.585,Mr. Berg with the respect to the jurisdictional question?
1969.628,0,20584,david_h_berg,,1599.585,1600.301,Yes.
1969.628,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1600.301,1603.887,Are you going to rest on your brief?
1969.628,0,20584,david_h_berg,,1603.887,1607.923,I would address myself to that point just briefly Your Honor.
1969.628,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1667.74,1675.988,And you don't see any difference between delay of under 90 days and one over 90 days with respect to jurisdiction?
1969.628,0,20584,david_h_berg,,1675.988,1677.495,We will rest our brief.
1969.628,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1677.495,1680.913,That is a distinction made by the government as you know?
1969.628,0,20584,david_h_berg,,1680.913,1691.046,"As I understood the distinction by the government, it was that there were statutes which prohibit a granting of the cert after 90 days."
1969.628,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1691.046,1694.911,But that's the outside limit of any statutory length of times --
1969.628,0,20584,david_h_berg,,1694.911,1695.088,"Yes, it will --"
1969.628,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1695.088,1700.637,--the government submits and as the power of the Court is only to shorten that time within that 90 days?
1969.628,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1703.199,1706.15,Does the record show why this delay occurred?
1969.628,0,20584,david_h_berg,,1706.15,1707.568,Yes it does Your Honor.
1969.628,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1727.646,1729.811,"That's all right, it's in the record?"
1969.628,0,20584,david_h_berg,,1729.811,1737.531,Yes sir.
1969.628,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1761.383,1766.203,In other words the essence of it is that was negligence of counsel is that what you're suggesting?
1969.628,0,20584,david_h_berg,,1766.203,1771.259,Yes sir.
1969.628,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1771.259,1771.711,Very well.
1969.628,0,20584,david_h_berg,,1771.711,1776.719,Thank you.
1969.628,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1776.719,1782.032,Mr. Solicitor General.
1969.628,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1782.032,1784.583,May it please that Court.
1969.628,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2069.625,2071.356,Is that case in your brief?
1969.628,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2071.356,2073.253,"Oh yes, this case is the --"
1969.628,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2073.253,2073.507,Main one --
1969.628,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2073.507,2076.219,Is the essence of our brief Mr. Justice.
1969.628,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2076.219,2081.096,I'm just looking at the index of your brief and I have read some --
1969.628,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2081.096,2084.157,Well it's under United States ex rel. Coy I believe in the --
1969.628,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2084.157,2085.684,"Well, what's in it?"
1969.628,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2085.684,2086.699,In the --
1969.628,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2086.699,2091.967,Cite about the 3447
1969.628,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2091.967,2098.739,"Well, I'm sorry Mr. Justice, it's under Coy, it's cited on pages 14 and 17 of --"
1969.628,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2098.739,2099.645,Thank you.
1969.628,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2099.645,2100.835,-- our brief.
1969.628,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2100.835,2101.353,"Yes, right."
1969.628,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2101.353,2129.108,And the Court also referred in the Coy opinion saying “Since the purpose in adopting the rules was to expedite criminal appeals and it seems rather odd that the nod effect in this case has been a very substantial delay over the time that would have been involved where the rules not in force.
1969.628,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2302.733,2314.829,"For some reason Mr. Solicitor General, I'm having difficulty again in the index to your brief I can't find United States against Smith under either United States or Smith."
1969.628,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2314.829,2318.391,"Well, then the index is --"
1969.628,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2318.391,2318.752,But for the time --
1969.628,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2318.752,2332.552,"-- is sadly deficient and indeed Mr. Justice, it may not be in the brief."
1969.628,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2336.969,2338.842,Could you let me have citation of that?
1969.628,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2338.842,2352.026,It is 331 U. S 469 and it is a very relevant opinion by Mr. Justice Jackson.
1969.628,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2352.026,2353.426,331-469?
1969.628,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2353.426,2356.469,331-469.
1969.628,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2356.469,2357.409,Thank you.
1969.628,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2357.409,2365.359,The Court held that mandamus should have been granted to require the district judge to revoke its order granting a new trial.
1969.628,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2460.986,2464.432,Mr. Solicitor General may I ask you a question.
1969.628,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2474.741,2479.525,Mr. Justice I would say under my argument that it would be exactly the same.
1969.628,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2479.525,2480.141,That's what I thought.
1969.628,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2480.141,2552.638,"But under the rule the Court has no jurisdiction after the time or the time as extended by an application made within time not to exceed 30 days has expired, thus the course would be entirely without prejudice to the Court by an exercise of the rule making power to provide as it has and in rule 4A of the appellate rules the Court, the rules of appellate procedure, the Court has provided that upon showing of excusable neglect the District Court may extend the time for filing the notice of appeal by any party for a period not to exceed 30 days from the expiration of the time otherwise prescribed by the subdivision."
1969.628,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2575.733,2589.259,"Did the government with you Mr. Solicitor General, look at the cases to see how many times this Court had accepted jurisdiction when it was over the time limit?"
1969.628,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2589.259,2602.428,"Well Mr. Justice, Stern and Gresham have some reference to this and I gather that there 10 to 12 or 15 and I will come to those after a while."
1969.628,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2668.888,2674.051,Maybe we could have -- maybe we did it with design?
1969.628,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2674.051,2690.14,"Mr. Justice, I have suspected that, nevertheless, in one of the places where you Mr. Justice have referred to this which is in a dissent you wrote in the case called Hicks against the District of Columbia."
1969.628,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2690.14,2693.112,That's probably a case which we shouldn't have taken at all any way?
1969.628,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2693.112,2701.451,Also not cited in my brief which in 383 U. S.
1969.628,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2704.704,2710.064,It's easier to invoke those things in cases you don't like I guess in the cases which you're interested?
1969.628,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2710.064,2722.29,"Well, in one of these cases where you have written an opinion, you referred to the fact that the Court has discretions for grant."
1969.628,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2748.844,2751.221,What's that exactly?
1969.628,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2751.221,2759.005,"Oh Mr. Justice, it's in my notes here and I -- it's not a fix case."
1969.628,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2759.005,2761.925,What's the line and you choose double that?
1969.628,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2761.925,2763.449,Coy.
1969.628,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2763.449,2765.907,"No, Robinson."
1969.628,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2765.907,2777.48,Robinson was 390 U. S.
1969.628,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2777.48,2779.819,Mr. Solicitor General may I ask.
1969.628,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2787.485,2788.418,Yes Mr. Justice.
1969.628,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2788.418,2795.134,"Which says that the petition in civil cases must be filed within 90 days of the judgment, isn't it?"
1969.628,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2795.134,2796.578,With an extension of 60 days.
1969.628,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2796.578,2805.147,"Yes, where as here we're dealing with the criminal case where we have no comparable explicit statutes, do we?"
1969.628,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2805.147,2824.644,"No, Mr. Justice, what you have is a statute authorizing the Court to prescribe by rule, the time and I am suggesting that the practice which has grown up of doing this on an open ended basis does not comply with the statutorily authorization to prescribe by rule."
1969.628,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2824.644,2835.234,"Well, I suppose then in the criminal case under that authority we might prescribe six months even though its only 90 days on the basis of this."
1969.628,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2835.234,2839.551,"Oh yes Mr. Justice, I suspect that you could prescribe two years if you --"
1969.628,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2839.551,2839.615,Yeah.
1969.628,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2839.615,2847.759,-- thought that was appropriate I don't advocate it but I would think that would come within the terms of the statutory authorization.
1969.628,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2851.676,2851.823,"Now, did you suggest --"
1969.628,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2851.823,2854.151,I don't think that is prescribing by rules.
1969.628,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2854.151,2861.748,Did you suggest over here that there are maybe 12 or 15 cases within -- in which we have indeed extended?
1969.628,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2861.748,2866.117,"Yes, Stern and Greshem missed them, a great many --"
1969.628,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2866.117,2873.432,But not as going to suggest I can -- think I can count 12 or 15 cases in the less couple of weeks?
1969.628,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2873.432,2875.881,Not in which you granted review.
1969.628,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2875.881,2877.268,"Oh, in which we granted review."
1969.628,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2877.268,2882.359,"Oh no, there'd been many more cases on that in which the applications have been filed late."
1969.628,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2883.125,2884.786,Which we have ignored it?
1969.628,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2884.786,2887.691,Somewhere between 12 and 20 would be my estimate of what --
1969.628,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2887.691,2888.897,"Where we granted it, is that it?"
1969.628,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2888.897,2894.689,Where you have granted it and proceeded to hear the case.
1969.628,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2894.689,2902.703,"Going back to this rule Mr. Solicitor General, once adopted, is it your position that has the same course as the statute in the civil cases?"
1969.628,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2902.703,2916.699,"Yes Mr. Justice, my position is thought the Court has the power to change the rule which it doesn't have power to change the statute that is the rule making power is a continuing power."
1969.628,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2931.386,2937.808,"Well now, are you speaking of a rule making power where it's unilateral or where it's concurrence with commerce?"
1969.628,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2937.808,2940.074,In this case it is unilateral.
1969.628,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2953.291,2963.513,And the essence I gather them Mr. Solicitor General is then if we prescribe at the time period that has precisely the same effect as if it had been written into enabling law itself?
1969.628,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2963.513,2967.895,Yes Mr. Justice that would be -- that would be my position.
1969.628,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3213.373,3223.35,"Mr. Solicitor General, may I ask if the time Coy was decided, did the predecessor of rule 22, read as rule 22 now reads?"
1969.628,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,3223.35,3224.343,"Yes Mr. Justice, --"
1969.628,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3224.343,3224.401,Exactly --
1969.628,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,3224.401,3228.325,-- it's the rule 11 of the 1934 rules.
1969.628,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3228.325,3230.431,But the phrasing was the same?
1969.628,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,3230.431,3244.278,"It read exactly the same except for the change of shall to may to which I have already referred and to the fact that at the time Coy was decided, there was no part to extend the time."
1969.628,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3244.278,3248.267,"The reason I asked is that's rather unusual wording, isn't it?"
1969.628,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,3259.603,3274.706,I think that's essentially the language of the 1925 Act with respect to civil cases which they were simply carrying forward.
1969.628,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3275.766,3276.93,Just before you go on.
1969.628,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,3320.456,3337.118,"Oh yes Mr. Justice, I recognized the one day argument is a hard one and if it's too hard for the Court to accept I will fall back and say “Well, at least you got to have sometime limit on it” and the only feasible one is the old 90 day statutory one --"
1969.628,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3337.118,3337.315,Or three months.
1969.628,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,3337.315,3337.922,--not the rules which were designed to expedite criminal appeals.
1969.628,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3337.922,3338.285,Which is it?
1969.628,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,3341.869,3352.027,I think that -- I think that logically I stand by my answer to Mr. Justice Black but the rules are jurisdictional.
1969.628,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3377.529,3378.405,Beyond 90 days?
1969.628,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,3378.405,3383.23,"Beyond and if it isn't completely open ended, where should it stop."
1969.628,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3390.07,3392.263,Or perhaps I misunderstood you then.
1969.628,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,3407.026,3434.397,It at least is within the -- it is within the language of -- to prescribe by rule and you would have to read into that while congress couldn't have intended that the Court would enlarge the time or that congress was meaning was that the Court should shorten the time and that's another case which we don't have here and my guess is the Court isn't going to prescribe a rule which fixes it in two years.
1969.628,2,20584,david_h_berg,,5563.467,5565.887,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1969.628,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5604.034,5611.157,I did not understand the Solicitor General to concede that the wearing of this apparel was symbolic speech.
1969.628,2,20584,david_h_berg,,5618.293,5618.434,If -- excuse me.
1969.628,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5618.434,5620.892,I wouldn't treat that as a concession.
1969.628,2,20584,david_h_berg,,5620.892,5633.02,"If I misunderstood this argument, we believe the facts still remains that Schacht testified that he meant the uniform as showing discredit or criticism of the United States."
1969.628,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5633.02,5634.591,So his intention is not in dispute?
1969.628,3,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,5634.591,5635.87,Yes.
1969.628,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5637.153,5640.756,"You're not resting wholly on that constitutional claim, are you?"
