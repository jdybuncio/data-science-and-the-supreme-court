2006.05-1589,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,14.76,"We'll hear argument next in 05-1589, Davenport versus Washington Education Association, and 05-1657 consolidated, Washington versus Washington Education Association."
2006.05-1589,0,39894,robert_m_mckenna,,16.46,18.962,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2006.05-1589,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,116.305,130.681,I'm surprised that that's the... I would have thought its primary purpose would be to spare individuals the necessity of supporting causes that they don't support.
2006.05-1589,0,39894,robert_m_mckenna,,133.884,134.503,"Justice Scalia, I--"
2006.05-1589,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,134.503,137.871,Is it only an election law interest?
2006.05-1589,0,39894,robert_m_mckenna,,137.871,142.99,"--Actually, Justice Scalia, we believe that Section, Section 760 accomplishes both purposes."
2006.05-1589,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,149.56,151.444,But you just said the State Supreme Court was wrong.
2006.05-1589,0,39894,robert_m_mckenna,,155.964,164.486,"--We believe that the integrity of the election process, Justice Scalia, is in fact served by helping ensure that individuals make voluntary contributions."
2006.05-1589,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,167.688,173.342,"Well, how can the State Supreme Court determine what is the purpose, the intent, of the ballot initiative?"
2006.05-1589,0,39894,robert_m_mckenna,,173.342,175.877,"I'm not certain, Your Honor."
2006.05-1589,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,177.294,178.663,A lot of people voted for it.
2006.05-1589,0,39894,robert_m_mckenna,,178.663,179.046,--Right.
2006.05-1589,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,179.046,182.865,But is the State Supreme Court in a position to determine why they voted for it?
2006.05-1589,0,39894,robert_m_mckenna,,182.865,187.852,"They simply hold, Your Honor, in their opinion that this is what the voters intended."
2006.05-1589,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,187.852,189.335,How do they know that?
2006.05-1589,0,39894,robert_m_mckenna,,189.335,190.571,"I don't know how they know it, Your Honor."
2006.05-1589,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,190.571,219.204,"If that's what they intended, then how can a State say, well, it's the union's money, we don't want you to send this little bit of your money to contribute in a campaign, but if the local swimming team wants to, or the bar association or the corporation, if they want to spend money that people have given them for totally other purposes, the compulsory bar association, well, they can do that."
2006.05-1589,0,39894,robert_m_mckenna,,232.898,247.64,"Your Honor, beginning with the Railway Labor Act case and continuing up through the public school teacher cases, Abood and Hudson, this Court has recognized that compelling employees to pay fees must be balanced against the need to protect them from--"
2006.05-1589,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,247.64,257.096,"Well, now you're talking about this other purpose, but that other purpose, which is rather interesting... I take it that's one of the main points on the other side... the other purpose has nothing to do with this case."
2006.05-1589,0,39894,robert_m_mckenna,,269.904,270.256,--Your Honor--
2006.05-1589,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,270.256,272.373,In this case they couldn't care less about that.
2006.05-1589,0,39894,robert_m_mckenna,,272.373,279.712,"--Actually, Your Honor, I think the plain language of 760 makes it clear that the authors of the initiative intended to protect individual interests."
2006.05-1589,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,304.41,315.801,"That's true, but in that case, in that case they didn't have a State Supreme Court interpreting the statute which is just as you started off saying it was, which has nothing to with the rights of the nonmember, zero."
2006.05-1589,0,39894,robert_m_mckenna,,319.42,323.991,"Your Honor, with due respect that was the legal conclusion of the Washington Supreme Court."
2006.05-1589,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,331.778,334.513,"Well, I wanted to ask about that."
2006.05-1589,0,39894,robert_m_mckenna,,351.124,352.108,Yes.
2006.05-1589,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,352.108,354.876,Are we free to disregard that and to say.
2006.05-1589,0,39894,robert_m_mckenna,,356.812,357.328,"No, no."
2006.05-1589,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,357.328,362.949,"Like the says that was argued, the first case this morning?"
2006.05-1589,0,39894,robert_m_mckenna,,362.949,371.555,"Your Honor, as Chief Justice Roberts mentioned in the last case you heard this morning, first look to the plain language, as the Solicitor General has pointed out in numerous briefs--"
2006.05-1589,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,371.555,375.924,"But that's a Federal, a Federal statute and this is a State statute."
2006.05-1589,0,39894,robert_m_mckenna,,388.064,390.016,"--I don't believe you are bound by that, Your Honor."
2006.05-1589,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,390.499,391.449,What's your authority for that?
2006.05-1589,0,39894,robert_m_mckenna,,391.449,392.968,"--Wisconsin v. Mitchell, Your Honor."
2006.05-1589,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,416.334,420.869,"Well, that's because the characterization had a Federal consequence."
2006.05-1589,0,39894,robert_m_mckenna,,420.869,441.132,"Your Honor, I simply observed that this Court did not find it was bound by the California Supreme Court's finding that the bar association is a government agency, nor did it find in Wisconsin v. Mitchell that it was bound by the Wisconsin Supreme Court in regards to its assessment of practical effects of the Wisconsin statute at issue there."
2006.05-1589,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,441.132,442.651,Do they get their money back?
2006.05-1589,0,39894,robert_m_mckenna,,460.946,466.366,"Your Honor, if it is a 760 expense they should get the money back."
2006.05-1589,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,486.161,492.417,"I'm trying to get at the question is this the union's money or is this the workers', the teachers' money?"
2006.05-1589,0,39894,robert_m_mckenna,,492.417,492.884,--Your Honor--
2006.05-1589,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,492.884,495.786,So does he get this money back if they violate the statute.
2006.05-1589,0,39894,robert_m_mckenna,,495.786,497.052,"--Your Honor, the 760 money... excuse me."
2006.05-1589,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,528.155,553.305,"Let, let's assume that it makes a difference whether the purpose of the statute was at least in part to protect the First Amendment rights of the non-union members or whether, as the Washington Supreme Court seemed to say... at least they said its principal purpose was to protect the voting process."
2006.05-1589,0,39894,robert_m_mckenna,,582.975,583.375,"Yes, sir--"
2006.05-1589,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,583.375,591.163,Wouldn't the Washington Supreme Court be obliged to intuit that purpose which would make it constitutional rather than unconstitutional?
2006.05-1589,0,39894,robert_m_mckenna,,591.163,594.699,"--Yes, Your Honor, it would if in fact Section 760 were ambiguous."
2006.05-1589,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,608.959,616.815,Do you agree with the court's conclusion that constitutionality is at issue here?
2006.05-1589,0,39894,robert_m_mckenna,,616.815,621.6,"--The constitutionality of the statute with regard to the union's First Amendment rights is not at issue here, Your Honor, no."
2006.05-1589,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,621.6,627.17,Isn't it your position that this statute is constitutional either way you interpret it?
2006.05-1589,0,39894,robert_m_mckenna,,627.17,631.222,"Yes, Your Honor, it is."
2006.05-1589,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,783.304,787.09,"Thank you, General."
2006.05-1589,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,795.696,798.314,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
2006.05-1589,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,904.417,917.408,"Mr. Clement, if we reverse as you suggest and the State Supreme Court said, well, I guess we were wrong under the First Amendment, we just realized our State constitution requires the same result, would that judgment stand, do you think?"
2006.05-1589,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,917.408,918.508,I think it might well.
2006.05-1589,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,937.905,950.446,"But Washington... at a minimum, I would assume that the Washington Supreme Court would not have constitutional avoidance as a crutch in order to reach that, to reach that conclusion, because there is no constitutional issue here under your view."
2006.05-1589,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,950.446,960.004,"Right, though I mean... I don't mean to be able to constrain the Washington Supreme Court's ability to find a State constitutional problem that it would then think there's a need to avoid."
2006.05-1589,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,960.004,962.32,"Are the courts in Washington State elected, do we know that?"
2006.05-1589,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,965.089,965.839,They are elected.
2006.05-1589,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,965.839,980.75,"They are elected, so it's easier to blame it on us than it is for them to say, we hold as a matter of Washington law that this can't be done and we disallow what the people have voted for."
2006.05-1589,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,984.285,986.035,"It might be a harder call, Justice Scalia."
2006.05-1589,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1008.768,1022.66,"Well, if this money is the non-union member's money and an opt-out... I'm sorry... opt-in scheme is not much of a burden on the unions, why should the First Amendment permit anything other than an opt-in scheme."
2006.05-1589,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1022.66,1024.844,"Well, Justice Scalia, it's a fair question."
2006.05-1589,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1099.308,1104.795,The union can make it as difficult as it wants for somebody to opt out.
2006.05-1589,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1108.699,1110.132,"--I wouldn't think so, Justice Alito."
2006.05-1589,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1169.588,1183.68,"Is it relevant, General Clement, that the legislature didn't seem to be, or the ballot initiative didn't seem to be focused at all on beefing up the rights of the non-member of the union?"
2006.05-1589,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1199.274,1210.232,"That's absolutely right, Justice Ginsburg, and I think the way we look at it is that this whole debate about the purpose of the provision is a little bit of a red herring, because at the end of the day it's clearly a hybrid."
2006.05-1589,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1229.126,1231.645,Or even nongermane political expenses.
2006.05-1589,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1231.645,1232.345,That's true.
2006.05-1589,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1346.269,1353.94,"Well, are there any other such entities that are given the power by the State to collect money from people against their will?"
2006.05-1589,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1353.94,1365.581,"You've anticipated my second point, which is the power that's being... I mean, it's no accident that they targeted this particular power or this particular issue because it has always been understood to be an anomaly in this area."
2006.05-1589,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1388.096,1389.563,"Thank you, General."
2006.05-1589,2,33630,john_m_west,,1391.131,1394.667,"Thank you, Mr. Chief... Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2006.05-1589,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1448.885,1454.889,"Are the First Amendment rights of the union members, of the workers who are non-union members relevant?"
2006.05-1589,2,33630,john_m_west,,1454.889,1457.108,"Uh, the First Amendment rights--"
2006.05-1589,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1457.108,1464.846,"I mean, you... you begin by talking about the First Amendment but you, you proceed as if there are no First Amendment rights of, of workers involved at all."
2006.05-1589,2,33630,john_m_west,,1464.846,1482.308,"--The... the... the nonmember employees certainly have a First Amendment right not to be compelled to finance, help finance political, ideological and other nongermane expenditures over their objection."
2006.05-1589,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1509.458,1518.231,"Well, I take it States have considerable discretion in determining how to protect Federal constitutional rights."
2006.05-1589,2,33630,john_m_west,,1518.231,1519.464,The States--
2006.05-1589,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1519.464,1539.311,"And absent some direction that we have to consider this as only being for a, for purposes of election transparency, it seems to me that Washington acted quite properly in saying we will use this mechanism in order to protect our workers' First Amendment constitutional rights."
2006.05-1589,2,33630,john_m_west,,1539.311,1549.35,"--Well, what the State is protecting, Justice Kennedy, is not the First Amendment right itself which by definition is protected through the Hudson process."
2006.05-1589,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1549.35,1551.702,"Well, why can't the State protect it more?"
2006.05-1589,2,33630,john_m_west,,1555.154,1555.654,The State--
2006.05-1589,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1555.654,1559.308,--from that it does not follow that the State is not protecting the rights.
2006.05-1589,2,33630,john_m_west,,1559.308,1575.835,"--The State can certainly protect the interest that is protected by the First Amendment right more, or to a greater degree, but if it does so, it can only do so if it does not infringe on other constitutional rights."
2006.05-1589,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1590.844,1602.652,"And your claim as I take it, that there is an infringement with the union's right of political advocacy, is that if in effect the scheme restricts the union's use of its own funds?"
2006.05-1589,2,33630,john_m_west,,1602.652,1612.443,"The scheme restricts the, the use of funds that are, are properly collected from agency fee payers by the union and--"
2006.05-1589,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1612.443,1612.91,All right.
2006.05-1589,2,33630,john_m_west,,1624.25,1628.835,"--Well, it wouldn't, because then the question is what do you do after you've segregated them."
2006.05-1589,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1630.154,1646.914,"Well, it's clear from the statute that, that what you would do would be leave them subject to the opt-in determination, but all other funds, i.e., the funds that you are constitutionally entitled to protect, would be unencumbered."
2006.05-1589,2,33630,john_m_west,,1646.914,1660.423,"--Certainly Justice Souter, but then the question is, for those fee payers, and certainly there are going to be some out of three or four thousand that do not give affirmative authorization, then what do you do with their funds?"
2006.05-1589,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1662.292,1669.996,Do you think that would create an independent constitutional problem assuming that you did segregate the funds?
2006.05-1589,2,33630,john_m_west,,1669.996,1671.231,"--Justice Souter, the--"
2006.05-1589,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1671.231,1672.781,"That would, that would create an issue?"
2006.05-1589,2,33630,john_m_west,,1690.576,1698.897,"--Justice Souter, the reason it raises a constitutional problem is because of the content discrimination issue."
2006.05-1589,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1737.372,1738.59,"But that's, under--"
2006.05-1589,2,33630,john_m_west,,1738.59,1739.474,--to the fee payers.
2006.05-1589,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1739.474,1745.377,--Under the Federal law you can't even have this opt-in system.
2006.05-1589,2,33630,john_m_west,,1761.47,1762.62,"Certainly, Justice Ginsburg."
2006.05-1589,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1762.62,1765.522,"And that's much harder on the union, I would think, isn't it?"
2006.05-1589,2,33630,john_m_west,,1765.522,1782.384,"Well, it's much harder on the union in that respect but not in the respect that's critical here, and that is the Federal law as well as the laws of all the other States who have, have required separate segregated funds limit that requirement to candidate elections."
2006.05-1589,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1809.968,1812.318,You're... you're back to its funds again.
2006.05-1589,2,33630,john_m_west,,1812.318,1813.086,Whether they're--
2006.05-1589,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1813.086,1819.657,"And you're saying, first you said well, segregating the funds does not answer the problem."
2006.05-1589,2,33630,john_m_west,,1838.868,1859.949,"--Justice Souter, if they are segregated, if the union segregates them, assuming they don't... for those for whom they don't receive affirmative authorization, they keep them in escrow indefinitely, or they put them in a locked box and never do anything with them, certainly the union would satisfy the statute in... in that way."
2006.05-1589,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1893.955,1909.382,"And I thought that approach was exactly what we held was required in the Street decision, the International Association of Machinists versus Street, so that you can't get around this requirement by saying, oh well, we'll use the objectors' funds for collective bargaining and we'll use the others for that."
2006.05-1589,2,33630,john_m_west,,1909.382,1909.882,Sure.
2006.05-1589,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1941.268,1944.803,Doesn't that objection apply whether it's opt in or opt out?
2006.05-1589,2,33630,john_m_west,,1944.803,1965.717,"--No, it doesn't, Mr. Chief Justice, because the... the... in... in the Street and Abood decisions, the Court has... has said that there is... all... has talked in terms of expenditures that are not germane to collective bargaining."
2006.05-1589,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1965.717,1987.13,"Is it content discrimination which subjects legislation to strict scrutiny if the Government, Federal Government or a State designates certain funds for use by school districts to teach patriotism, American history, something like that?"
2006.05-1589,2,33630,john_m_west,,1988.832,1991.118,"No, because this is Government funding."
2006.05-1589,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1991.484,1991.968,Okay.
2006.05-1589,2,33630,john_m_west,,2015.067,2016.434,"--I believe it is, Justice Scalia, because--"
2006.05-1589,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2016.434,2018.285,I don't see why the one is any worse than the other.
2006.05-1589,2,33630,john_m_west,,2041.884,2047.686,"--It's strict scrutiny if it's not the Government acting as the speaker, and the Government is acting here as--"
2006.05-1589,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2047.686,2050.454,Here is the Government acting as a coercer.
2006.05-1589,2,33630,john_m_west,,2054.692,2062.179,"--Well, I don't believe the Court has ever put it quite that way in the Government speech cases, the Government funding cases."
2006.05-1589,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2062.179,2066.38,"May I ask this question on your overinclusive, or underinclusive rather, argument?"
2006.05-1589,2,33630,john_m_west,,2081.241,2086.21,"I think the problem here... let me say two things in response to that, Justice Stevens."
2006.05-1589,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2086.21,2088.293,"Could you just tell me yes or no, and then explain?"
2006.05-1589,2,33630,john_m_west,,2088.293,2088.911,Certainly.
2006.05-1589,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2095.15,2102.47,"At least insofar as your argument under inclusiveness, the answer would have to be that was, that statute would be okay."
2006.05-1589,2,33630,john_m_west,,2102.47,2112.528,"If... if the... if you're... if what you're doing is talking about the, an election statute like--"
2006.05-1589,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2112.528,2120.432,"I'm talking about a statute that the individuals say I don't want to spend any more money, give any more money to the union than I absolutely have to."
2006.05-1589,2,33630,john_m_west,,2130.073,2144.231,"--That, Justice Stevens, if this is what the state is saying with respect to the public sector employees as to which it has the authority to regulate the agency fee."
2006.05-1589,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2146.599,2150.301,"If that's perfectly constitutional, this is a fortiori okay."
2006.05-1589,2,33630,john_m_west,,2150.301,2151.087,--It's not--
2006.05-1589,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2151.087,2155.105,And it's less of a burden on the union and there's less protection to the employee.
2006.05-1589,2,33630,john_m_west,,2155.105,2155.939,"--No, it's not."
2006.05-1589,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2179.904,2181.839,Why isn't that a content-based restriction?
2006.05-1589,2,33630,john_m_west,,2184.624,2199.884,"--The purposes that... the purposes for which the... that are being excluded in that case are a wide variety of different kinds of speech and non-speech activities, not only political speech but public relations."
2006.05-1589,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2245.531,2263.76,"I'm just curious below in the opinion, I didn't notice in footnote 6, which I hadn't taken in, that the court explicitly says that you did not make any argument about underinclusiveness and overinclusiveness with respect to other organizations, corporations and so forth."
2006.05-1589,2,33630,john_m_west,,2276.734,2277.301,Correct.
2006.05-1589,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2277.301,2283.222,And you're saying that the real problem with this statute is that it throws in ballot issues along with candidate elections.
2006.05-1589,2,33630,john_m_west,,2283.222,2284.524,"Well, there are two problems."
2006.05-1589,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2286.224,2290.81,"But on that first one, did they discuss that at some length in the lower court opinion?"
2006.05-1589,2,33630,john_m_west,,2291.46,2293.345,"--The lower court, no, did not discuss the--"
2006.05-1589,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2293.345,2296.131,--So this is really a ground that they haven't considered.
2006.05-1589,2,33630,john_m_west,,2296.131,2310.391,--What the Washington Supreme Court held is that the... what was argued in the Washington Supreme Court generally is that this is a violation of the union's right to engage in political advocacy.
2006.05-1589,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2310.391,2312.541,But this thing about the ballot issue is not there.
2006.05-1589,2,33630,john_m_west,,2312.541,2323.865,"And the reason... this is a reason I think the Washington Supreme Court took note of the fact of what the funds were spent on, on balloting initiatives solely, not on candidate elections."
2006.05-1589,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2323.865,2329.483,"In fact, you want to us decide that question, and was there another one that... you just said there were two reasons basically."
2006.05-1589,2,33630,john_m_west,,2329.483,2344.611,"Well, the two reasons why the statute fails to constitute a compelling Government interest are the overbroad extension to ballot propositions, unlike the Federal law and any other State law."
2006.05-1589,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2388.188,2394.525,That's the argument that the State Supreme Court in footnote 6 expressly said you did not raise.
2006.05-1589,2,33630,john_m_west,,2394.525,2402.698,"--I think that would be a valid argument if we were attempting to raise an equal protection claim here, Mr. Chief Justice."
2006.05-1589,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2431.134,2464.539,"On which... on what you were arguing, you were very careful in your brief to say funds lawfully possessed by the union, as distinguished from what's in a corporate treasury or... there is something peculiar about this, and you recognized it by saying we possess them, because if the non-member wants it back, the non-member would be entitled."
2006.05-1589,2,33630,john_m_west,,2470.109,2475.329,"Well, it is, Justice Ginsburg, if the... this is why the purpose of the statute is so important."
2006.05-1589,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2494.207,2503.48,You want us to consider this case as if the First Amendment rights of non-union members were not involved?
2006.05-1589,2,33630,john_m_west,,2503.48,2506.265,"--Absolutely... absolutely not, Justice Kennedy."
2006.05-1589,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2506.982,2508.466,But that's been your whole argument so far.
2006.05-1589,2,33630,john_m_west,,2508.466,2509.133,--Absolutely not.
2006.05-1589,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2538.403,2542.488,So it's a First Amendment right that is waived by failing to make a timely objection.
2006.05-1589,2,33630,john_m_west,,2542.488,2544.473,"Well, it's not that a right is waived."
2006.05-1589,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2545.173,2546.259,It's gone under your theory.
2006.05-1589,2,33630,john_m_west,,2546.259,2546.642,--No.
2006.05-1589,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2555.197,2557.547,Which no longer exists if you don't make a timely objection.
2006.05-1589,2,33630,john_m_west,,2557.547,2567.355,"No, you have the... but that would be just like... like the solicitor general on the... the license plate case."
2006.05-1589,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2578.194,2580.146,It's not exactly the same situation.
2006.05-1589,2,33630,john_m_west,,2586.634,2589.669,--These are teachers who have not joined the Washington Education--
2006.05-1589,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2589.669,2601.143,"Isn't it overwhelmingly likely that they, if you spoke to them and you said would you like to give money to the union to spend on elections, they would say no?"
2006.05-1589,2,33630,john_m_west,,2601.143,2604.511,"--I absolutely disagree with you, Justice Alito, because keep in mind--"
2006.05-1589,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2604.511,2612.717,"Explain to me the thinking of somebody who chooses not to join, the 5 percent who choose not to join, and yet they would like to make this contribution."
2006.05-1589,2,33630,john_m_west,,2615.819,2618.438,--It's not asking them to make a contribution.
2006.05-1589,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2626.044,2627.011,What's the difference between that?
2006.05-1589,2,33630,john_m_west,,2627.011,2627.677,The money is being used--
2006.05-1589,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2627.677,2638.018,"What's the difference between saying would you like to make a contribution, and would you like to allow us to use money that we possess for our purposes rather than returning it to us?"
2006.05-1589,2,33630,john_m_west,,2639.668,2654.861,"--Well, whether there is a difference or not, Justice Alito, the point is the union here is using this money for purposes that it has every reason to believe is in the interest of the vast majority of teachers, including--"
2006.05-1589,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2654.861,2657.563,"Well surely, they get to make that decision, don't they?"
2006.05-1589,2,33630,john_m_west,,2663.317,2671.989,"--No, but I'm responding to the suggestion that there should be some kind of presumption that they would, would decline to authorize this."
2006.05-1589,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2691.617,2694.485,I still don't understand the thinking of these hypothetical people.
2006.05-1589,2,33630,john_m_west,,2710.697,2727.624,"--Well, maybe Mr.... Justice Alito, if you knew that what the union was spending its money for was to improve, to increase cost of living adjustments for teachers or to reduce class size for teachers, or to enact tax levies in local school districts--"
2006.05-1589,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2727.624,2745.018,"Is this all hypothetical, Mr. West, or is there any empirical evidence about what the people who are non-union members, if they had their druthers, would they say not a penny more goes into the union till than we are forced to put there?"
2006.05-1589,2,33630,john_m_west,,2752.107,2752.524,--No.
2006.05-1589,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2772.169,2781.71,"Well, you're free under this system to send them the same sort of materials you send about your PAC and say we do all sorts of good things with the money from people who opt in, you should opt in."
2006.05-1589,2,33630,john_m_west,,2781.71,2782.31,--Yeah.
2006.05-1589,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2782.31,2785.995,But you want to do it without giving them that opportunity.
2006.05-1589,2,33630,john_m_west,,2785.995,2799.088,"Well, the question is whether the State can compel us to, to obtain that authorization for this limited type of speech."
2006.05-1589,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2799.088,2804.29,Only if the State has given you the power to exact the money from these people.
2006.05-1589,2,33630,john_m_west,,2819.585,2838.647,"It doesn't change everything, Justice Scalia, precisely for the reasons that you discussed in your opinion for the court in RAV versus St. Paul, the St. Paul cross-burning case, where you pointed out that, that the greater includes the lesser argument does not apply where you have content discrimination."
2006.05-1589,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2849.003,2878.272,"That brings us back to the question I asked earlier and I suggested in my answer to that I don't think it's content discrimination of the sort that triggers strict scrutiny when the government gives money for a particular purpose only and not for other purposes, and I also don't think it's content discrimination of the sort that triggers strict scrutiny when the government allows a private organization to use governmental power to exact money from people for a particular purpose only."
2006.05-1589,2,33630,john_m_west,,2879.374,2900.953,"--Justice Scalia, imagine, if I may take a little bit starker example, imagine that what the government said in the statute that the union must obtain affirmative authorization if it is going to use agency fee funds to support Democratic candidates, but not if it's going to support Republican candidates."
2006.05-1589,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2902.822,2906.274,And I see that you've put a lot of weight on this argument.
2006.05-1589,2,33630,john_m_west,,2906.274,2908.976,And that... it goes further than this.
2006.05-1589,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2920.384,2927.038,"What you're saying right now, if it is, is ballots versus candidates under the word ""election""."
2006.05-1589,2,33630,john_m_west,,2927.038,2927.488,Exactly.
2006.05-1589,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2927.488,2935.627,"And that has a lot of implications for all kinds of campaign finance law that has nothing to do, I think, with unions."
2006.05-1589,2,33630,john_m_west,,2935.627,2936.077,Exactly.
2006.05-1589,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2936.077,2948.018,"And the lower court didn't consider it, and is this open now, if it's going back for other things such as the State Constitution, for them to consider this matter on remand?"
2006.05-1589,2,33630,john_m_west,,2948.018,2950.57,I think it would be open to them to consider.
2006.05-1589,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2956.29,2968.765,"And I don't know, perhaps you don't know, what the implication of a decision say in your favor here would have for Vermont's campaign finance law or California's or some other."
2006.05-1589,2,33630,john_m_west,,2968.765,2991.213,"--Perhaps, but it's certainly true that on this, at least on this point of the lack of any compelling justification for restricting entities' contributions and expenditures in support of or in opposition to ballot propositions, the law, this Court's law, is fully clearly on that point."
2006.05-1589,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3012.794,3026.22,Could the State have a restriction requiring affirmative authorization for all union expenditures that fall within the Abood-Machinist line of cases?
2006.05-1589,2,33630,john_m_west,,3026.22,3026.803,Yes.
2006.05-1589,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3029.136,3036.992,"If this were across the board as to all First Amendment rights an objecting member has, then the statute would be void... would be valid, rather?"
2006.05-1589,2,33630,john_m_west,,3036.992,3044.063,--Certainly if this were done in the statute that authorized the agency fee in the first place.
2006.05-1589,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3044.063,3045.348,"No, it's done in this statute."
2006.05-1589,2,33630,john_m_west,,3045.348,3058.905,"If it's done in this statute, the problem that would remain, Justice Kennedy, is this is an election law that presumably has to be justified on the basis of whether it promotes the integrity of elections."
2006.05-1589,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3060.49,3081.104,"Well, my hypothetical is that there's a Washington statute or a Washington constitutional referendum provision, initiative provision, which says that as to all protected speech for non-union members who have moneys taken out, there must be affirmative authorization."
2006.05-1589,2,33630,john_m_west,,3081.104,3090.293,"--The State could do that, at least if it limited it to the public sector, where the State has the authority to authorize the amount of the agency fee."
2006.05-1589,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3107.505,3118.396,"Back to your example about the political party saying you can't use it for Democrats, what if they said, as they might have in the 1940s, you can use it for anybody except communist candidates?"
2006.05-1589,2,33630,john_m_west,,3118.396,3120.246,"--Well, I think that would be a problem, too."
2006.05-1589,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3121.265,3121.998,Okay.
2006.05-1589,2,33630,john_m_west,,3121.998,3143.594,"--That would be viewpoint discriminatory, but here we have a legislative statute that, that it's content discriminatory, that can't be justified as a compelling State interest to promote the integrity of the elections, and we believe the judgment of the Washington Supreme Court should be affirmed."
2006.05-1589,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3144.611,3145.83,"Thank you, Mr. West."
2006.05-1589,3,39894,robert_m_mckenna,,3148.582,3150.515,"Mr. Chief Justice, thank you."
2006.05-1589,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3234.7,3239.437,But the State of Washington seems to think that's fine for everything other than election expenses.
2006.05-1589,3,39894,robert_m_mckenna,,3239.437,3253.244,"--Yes, Your Honor, in terms of Section 760 the State of Washington does think that's fine because of the purpose of the statute and the purpose of Section 760, the purpose being to protect the integrity of the elections by several different means involving protecting--"
2006.05-1589,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3253.244,3259.481,"Well, do you see an underlying constitutional problem as to non-election expenditures that are still political expenditures?"
2006.05-1589,3,39894,robert_m_mckenna,,3259.481,3264.616,"--We don't take a position on whether there's a constitutional problem with regard to non-germane expenditures, Your Honor."
2006.05-1589,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3265.052,3267.402,Didn't we take one in Abood?
2006.05-1589,3,39894,robert_m_mckenna,,3267.402,3268.17,--I'm sorry?
2006.05-1589,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3268.17,3269.77,Didn't we take a position in Abood?
2006.05-1589,3,39894,robert_m_mckenna,,3269.77,3270.754,What I meant was--
2006.05-1589,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3270.754,3278.275,"I suppose the way the statute works, you have to opt in for the election expenditures, but you have to have a right to opt out for other non-germane."
2006.05-1589,3,39894,robert_m_mckenna,,3278.275,3278.725,--Yes.
2006.05-1589,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3304.425,3309.044,What do you say about his hypothetical involving Democrats versus Republicans?
2006.05-1589,3,39894,robert_m_mckenna,,3309.044,3313.031,"Well, Your Honor, that would certainly seem to be viewpoint discrimination, and it would implicate--"
2006.05-1589,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3313.031,3315.165,"Well, he says, well, this is content discrimination."
2006.05-1589,3,39894,robert_m_mckenna,,3315.9,3320.535,"--Your Honor, we do not agree that this is content, content discrimination."
2006.05-1589,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3329.375,3334.362,"--Well, but it's content in the sense that only some speech has to be affirmatively authorized."
2006.05-1589,3,39894,robert_m_mckenna,,3334.362,3341.349,"Yes, Your Honor, that additional affirmative authorization does apply to this category of speech, influencing an election or operating a political committee."
2006.05-1589,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3365.581,3367.416,"Can I just go back to, you mentioned my question."
2006.05-1589,3,39894,robert_m_mckenna,,3367.416,3367.883,"--Yes, sir."
2006.05-1589,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3367.883,3376.122,"Your point of your answer to his hypothetical is, well, the viewpoint discrimination would be impermissible, but the content discrimination is permissible?"
2006.05-1589,3,39894,robert_m_mckenna,,3376.122,3379.408,"If it is content discrimination, Your Honor, we believe it is permissible, yes, sir."
2006.05-1589,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3390.031,3391.215,Is it content?
2006.05-1589,3,39894,robert_m_mckenna,,3394.233,3396.119,"We don't believe it is content-based, Your Honor."
2006.05-1589,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3400.487,3405.475,"Well, the content means a category of speech as opposed to what is the political position you're taking."
2006.05-1589,3,39894,robert_m_mckenna,,3405.475,3411.879,"Yes, that is it's only in regard to influencing elections or operating a political committee, which is a second."
2006.05-1589,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3411.879,3413.745,But I thought that that was content.
2006.05-1589,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3417.616,3418.983,"That's my understanding, too."
2006.05-1589,3,39894,robert_m_mckenna,,3429.84,3430.39,"Yes, Your Honor."
2006.05-1589,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3430.39,3436.344,"If that's yes, then the category here is election speech."
2006.05-1589,3,39894,robert_m_mckenna,,3467.263,3467.815,"Yes, Your Honor."
2006.05-1589,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3469.198,3472.667,I'm glad you said yes to me because that implies a no to the last question.
2006.05-1589,3,39894,robert_m_mckenna,,3475.035,3476.737,"--Yes, Your Honor, I understand your question."
2006.05-1589,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3492.331,3496.699,"Can you get to the point you were about to make, what the purpose of the thing is?"
2006.05-1589,3,39894,robert_m_mckenna,,3496.699,3498.935,"Well, yes, Your Honor."
2006.05-1589,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3527.67,3528.754,May I just... I'm sorry.
2006.05-1589,3,39894,robert_m_mckenna,,3568.497,3569.314,"Yes, Your Honor."
2006.05-1589,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3570.949,3584.257,"So by articulating that the election integrity is a purpose, the Washington Supreme Court should not be understood as excluding the protection of the non-member workers' interests?"
2006.05-1589,3,39894,robert_m_mckenna,,3584.257,3584.757,"Yes, Your Honor."
2006.05-1589,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3585.573,3586.69,"Thank you, General."
