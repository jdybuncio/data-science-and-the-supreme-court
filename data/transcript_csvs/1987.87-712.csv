1987.87-712,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,13.992,"Mr. Englert, you may proceed whenever you are ready."
1987.87-712,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,13.992,20.793,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1987.87-712,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,236.649,255.112,"Now Mr. Englert, there is a split of authority, is there not, in Courts of Appeal about whether money damages means compensatory damages or whether it refers to the Tucker Act, any money relief question?"
1987.87-712,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,255.112,258.665,"There is a split in the circuits, yes."
1987.87-712,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,258.665,268.5,And the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia takes the view that money damages does not mean what you say it means in that statute?
1987.87-712,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,268.5,269.301,That is correct.
1987.87-712,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,272.253,277.836,"So that is really the crux of what we need to focus on, I suppose, in this case."
1987.87-712,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,277.836,279.799,That is correct.
1987.87-712,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,306.146,315.453,Why do you suppose that Congress did not use language like is used in the Tucker Act if they intended it to mean the same thing?
1987.87-712,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,315.453,320.244,"Well, there actually is no language in the Tucker Act that refers to money damages."
1987.87-712,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,364.043,371.338,"Well, I guess that Judge Bork in his opinion for the CADC found some legislative history the other way."
1987.87-712,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,371.338,372.919,"Very little, Your Honor."
1987.87-712,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,402.307,403.519,"Well, let me ask you on that point."
1987.87-712,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,417.168,425.073,"Some states have succeeded in preventing recoupment, albeit under an assertion of jurisdiction that we think is invalid."
1987.87-712,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,428.575,445.587,"So in your view as a practical matter, a state will always be in the position of having to seek money damages in effect, and always be channeled to the Court of Claims in any of these grant programs."
1987.87-712,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,454.601,455.503,"No, Your Honor."
1987.87-712,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,494.058,511.95,"Would you have trouble with just a declaratory judgment that says here is the situation, we are in disagreement with the government on this issue, we do not ask for an injunction now, or any money, or anything else, we just want a judgment, and we think that the Secretary will live up to the judgment?"
1987.87-712,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,511.95,516.953,If they do not want money.
1987.87-712,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,516.953,518.084,"Well, they do not ask for it."
1987.87-712,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,526.59,535.526,"But the ordinary rules of res adjudicata, as we understand them, preclude that kind of claims splitting, first getting your judgment in one court, and then bringing a separate claim in another court."
1987.87-712,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,535.526,539.759,"I am just asking you, would you object just to declaratory judgment?"
1987.87-712,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,539.759,545.152,"Standing alone, we would not."
1987.87-712,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,552.959,566.858,"What is the District Court who gets something like that supposed to do, I recall confronting this on the D.C. Circuit, are you supposed to deem that to include a claim for monetary relief or not."
1987.87-712,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,602.061,603.343,I think that is right.
1987.87-712,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,603.343,612.336,So really what you say is that the state can bring the action if they specifically disclaim any desire for monetary relief.
1987.87-712,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,621.712,623.835,We do think that that is the better view.
1987.87-712,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,633.022,634.12,But there is a way to do it?
1987.87-712,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,634.12,636.723,"There is a way to do it, yes."
1987.87-712,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,636.723,654.975,"So you think that the government, if there was a declaratory judgment which you did not object to, you think that the government would then still refuse to refund the money, if it had been adjudged finally in a court that the Secretary had been wrong all the way?"
1987.87-712,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,654.975,666.652,"If we thought that the state had brought the action in District Court to secure District Court jurisdiction over an action that should have been in the Claims Court if the state wanted money, I think that we might very well take that position."
1987.87-712,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,666.652,668.582,"Well, the state did not ask for money."
1987.87-712,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,670.565,673.347,"Well, if they say that they do not want any money, we are not going to give them any money."
1987.87-712,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,673.347,678.029,Even though you had been unlawful all the way?
1987.87-712,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,678.029,686.955,"Again if the state said that it did not want it and secured jurisdiction in that manner, we would not see any reason."
1987.87-712,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,686.955,700.883,"Well, Mr. Englert, there is some legislative history, as you have acknowledged, that indicates that Congress did expect these grant-in-aid programs to be decided in the District Courts and the Courts of Appeal."
1987.87-712,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,700.883,704.897,"Well, as I say, there is a single reference to grant-in-aid programs in both committee reports."
1987.87-712,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,725.731,726.352,"Oh, yes."
1987.87-712,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,766.637,771.65,I must respectfully disagree with you in several respects.
1987.87-712,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,777.726,780.596,"Mr. Englert, would you speak up just a little bit."
1987.87-712,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,781.437,782.067,I am sorry.
1987.87-712,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,795.596,804.803,"No, but it is often very helpful, of course, to have different Circuit Courts of Appeal focusing in on some very tough issues that we get."
1987.87-712,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,804.803,808.946,"That is correct, of course, Your Honor."
1987.87-712,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,814.069,817.742,"That can happen under the Tucker Act, too, do not forget that."
1987.87-712,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,824.736,826.326,But then will go to the Federal Circuit.
1987.87-712,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,826.326,827.197,Will go to the Federal Circuit.
1987.87-712,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,871.456,876.409,"Well, there are policy arguments that can be made to some of these cases in various places."
1987.87-712,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,895.581,898.014,"Well, it is not all that clear."
1987.87-712,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,918.206,922.308,A literal reading of that language would not necessarily by itself foreclose jurisdiction.
1987.87-712,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,922.308,922.929,That is right.
1987.87-712,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,922.929,924.03,But there are two other things that work here.
1987.87-712,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,998.172,1001.254,Now you rely primarily on 704 rather than 702.
1987.87-712,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,1001.254,1003.455,"On that issue, that is correct."
1987.87-712,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1018.215,1030.653,"But is it not true as a matter of history that in some of these cases that the government did not take the position that you are taking now, that they allowed some of these cases to go forward in the District Courts outside of the Court of Claims?"
1987.87-712,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,1030.653,1032.733,"That is correct, the issue was not addressed."
1987.87-712,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1032.733,1034.655,It was not as obvious as it is now.
1987.87-712,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,1040.608,1043.911,"Yes, but."
1987.87-712,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1043.911,1045.213,"Yes, but what?"
1987.87-712,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,1045.213,1052.228,The Secretary has decided as a matter of policy not to pursue objections to jurisdiction in this case.
1987.87-712,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1065.076,1080.505,"Mr. Englert, let me also ask you whether you think that the 704 adequate remedy question or determination should be made case by case or on the basis of categories of things?"
1987.87-712,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,1080.505,1090.252,I do not think that it can be made in an absolute sense for any and all cases for all times.
1987.87-712,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1106.793,1110.936,Even though prospective relief is sought?
1987.87-712,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,1110.936,1113.848,Even though prospective relief is sought.
1987.87-712,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1113.848,1122.273,"And even though you might have changing administrations, and new administrators, and different policies in the future."
1987.87-712,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,1130.228,1131.47,Yes.
1987.87-712,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1157.917,1171.895,"Where is the legislative history referring to grant-in-aid cases that you were discussing with Justice O'Connor earlier, that came up in what context?"
1987.87-712,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,1171.895,1177.82,"Page eight of the Senate report, and also page nine of the virtually identical House report."
1987.87-712,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1201.816,1208.401,But that assuredly was not invoked in money claims under grant-in-aid programs.
1987.87-712,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,1223.211,1225.051,"That would have been our position, yes."
1987.87-712,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1225.051,1232.147,So I do not see how it gives you any problem at all.
1987.87-712,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,1234.137,1241.763,"Well, we have acknowledged that Judge Bork rested his entire analysis on that snippet of legislative history."
1987.87-712,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1257.564,1265.679,"And this reference must mean pre-issuance challenge to regulations, which is how a lot of grant-in-aid claims come up, of course."
1987.87-712,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,1271.954,1273.343,I think that is a proper construction.
1987.87-712,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1305.724,1309.517,"Yes, I recall that the briefs seem to disagree on that point."
1987.87-712,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,1339.156,1345.071,"I am not sure that such cases would arise, but that would be a different case from this one."
1987.87-712,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1382.586,1392.182,The First Circuit said that in the Claims Court that its judgment would be collateral estoppel.
1987.87-712,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,1397.664,1406.059,"Well, the government can be collaterally estopped under the Stauffer Chemical and Montana cases."
1987.87-712,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1406.059,1412.184,"So if the First Circuit is correct, then there is estoppel in the Claims Court, you concede that?"
1987.87-712,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,1412.184,1412.985,No.
1987.87-712,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1429.147,1429.798,No.
1987.87-712,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,1443.135,1446.898,--No.
1987.87-712,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1446.898,1448.889,I did not think so.
1987.87-712,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,1448.889,1453.183,"I doubt that we would have a lot of luck in the Claims Court, that we would not concede the point."
1987.87-712,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1453.183,1463.458,"Well, res adjudicata certainly would not apply if the Court did not have jurisdiction to enter the money judgment."
1987.87-712,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,1463.458,1464.85,"Well, of course."
1987.87-712,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1469.064,1474.107,"Well, it set aside the money judgment, did it not?"
1987.87-712,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,1474.107,1476.256,The Court did set aside the money judgment.
1987.87-712,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1476.256,1477.258,On the grounds that?
1987.87-712,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,1477.258,1483.373,On the grounds that our analysis of the legislative history of the Administrative Procedure Act is correct.
1987.87-712,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1495.83,1497.011,May I ask you a question.
1987.87-712,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,1524.829,1531.404,"Well, the problem would not be collateral estoppel."
1987.87-712,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1531.404,1532.896,It is not just collateral estoppel.
1987.87-712,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,1562.385,1571.512,"Justice Stevens, I said in the context of a question whose underlying premise was the state brought an action in which it disclaimed the right to monetary relief."
1987.87-712,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1577.876,1581.537,"My hypothesis was this very case, and we only decided the issue that they decided."
1987.87-712,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,1607.954,1617.631,"In the context of this case in which the state has never made any secret of the fact that it wants the money, and this Court accepted jurisdiction and held against us; no, of course, we would pay the money."
1987.87-712,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1617.631,1618.582,You would.
1987.87-712,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,1634.881,1644.888,"The point, Justice Stevens, is that we might make the collateral estoppel argument, but we would be foolish to reargue the merits in the Claims Court, which of course would be bound by this Court's disposition of the merits."
1987.87-712,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1644.888,1650.021,But my point is that if you are wrong on the merits regardless of the technicalities of whether there is collateral estoppel or not.
1987.87-712,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,1657.387,1665.472,"Justice Stevens, my answer to the questions about collateral estoppel is that we would argue against collateral estoppel, so that we could relitigate in the Claims Court."
1987.87-712,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1665.472,1669.886,"That is why I asked you if we had decided, whether you would still do that."
1987.87-712,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,1672.877,1673.897,"Right, and we would pay."
1987.87-712,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1673.897,1674.558,You would?
1987.87-712,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,1674.558,1675.099,Yes.
1987.87-712,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1677.309,1680.241,"Thank you, Mr. Englert."
1987.87-712,1,42461,thomas_a_barnico,,1682.212,1689.127,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1987.87-712,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1764.367,1767.9,Now what provision of the statute is that that you are relying on?
1987.87-712,1,42461,thomas_a_barnico,,1767.9,1775.875,"Mr. Chief Justice, that is 42 U.S.C. 1316(a)(3)."
1987.87-712,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1775.875,1778.176,And where is that in your brief?
1987.87-712,1,42461,thomas_a_barnico,,1778.176,1785.449,"That appears in the appendix of the brief, the statutory appendix to the brief, Your Honor."
1987.87-712,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1785.449,1797.387,XII.
1987.87-712,1,42461,thomas_a_barnico,,1797.387,1799.48,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1987.87-712,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1823.924,1831.561,But that is often true of the cases that go to the Claims Court and to the Federal Circuit under the Tucker Act.
1987.87-712,1,42461,thomas_a_barnico,,1851.794,1855.467,"But, Your Honor, it proves more than that."
1987.87-712,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1911.533,1915.495,"Of course, 41 U.S. C 1316 sends you to the Court of Appeals."
1987.87-712,1,42461,thomas_a_barnico,,1915.495,1916.406,That is right.
1987.87-712,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1916.406,1917.588,You did not go to the Court of Appeals.
1987.87-712,1,42461,thomas_a_barnico,,1926.594,1928.424,There is a reason why we went to the District Court.
1987.87-712,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2005.244,2010.507,"Insofar as 1316 is concerned, it seems to me that it hurts you more than it helps you."
1987.87-712,1,42461,thomas_a_barnico,,2028.339,2029.901,"Well, Your Honor, it is."
1987.87-712,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2121.221,2125.031,You are entitled to a lump sum under 1316?
1987.87-712,1,42461,thomas_a_barnico,,2125.031,2126.423,"No, Your Honor."
1987.87-712,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2126.423,2129.104,Where do you get the lump sum?
1987.87-712,1,42461,thomas_a_barnico,,2129.104,2139.112,"The lump sum, Your Honor, is mentioned in 45 CFR 201.3."
1987.87-712,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2139.112,2139.813,That is a regulation.
1987.87-712,1,42461,thomas_a_barnico,,2139.813,2141.093,It is a regulation.
1987.87-712,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2315.486,2328.236,Do you think that the government would not have been bound with respect to its future action on the same matter had you gotten your judgment from the Federal Circuit under the Tucker Act instead from the Court of Appeals here?
1987.87-712,1,42461,thomas_a_barnico,,2328.236,2335.76,I would not expect to act as if they were bound in the same way.
1987.87-712,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2340.174,2344.356,The same issue involving the same party with the case?
1987.87-712,1,42461,thomas_a_barnico,,2344.356,2355.093,"--Your Honor, I think the point is whether the effect of stare decisis alone in such a context would be enough."
1987.87-712,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2385.432,2389.745,"But in a system when you go to regional Courts of Appeals, that is understandable."
1987.87-712,1,42461,thomas_a_barnico,,2408.396,2413.652,"Well, I would still distinguish that from that binding order."
1987.87-712,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2428.302,2430.02,"It is not the Secretary, it is the statute."
1987.87-712,1,42461,thomas_a_barnico,,2439.007,2441.207,--That is correct.
1987.87-712,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2441.207,2448.223,"It is not his judgment about what is adequate, but rather it is the Congress' and ultimately the courts, I suppose."
1987.87-712,1,42461,thomas_a_barnico,,2448.223,2448.944,That is right.
1987.87-712,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2480.393,2487.53,"Well, Mr. Barnico, in this case now, the District Court did not issue an injunction, is that right?"
1987.87-712,1,42461,thomas_a_barnico,,2487.53,2493.403,The District Court entered a judgment that said that the decision of the Secretary was reversed.
1987.87-712,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2493.403,2496.406,"It did not enter an injunction, did it?"
1987.87-712,1,42461,thomas_a_barnico,,2496.406,2497.485,No.
1987.87-712,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2497.485,2510.303,"And you take the position that to be adequate that the relief requires an injunction, and that is why it does not meet the standards of 704 and should not go to the Court of Claims, right?"
1987.87-712,1,42461,thomas_a_barnico,,2510.303,2512.244,"Yes, Your honor."
1987.87-712,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2512.244,2520.061,And yet you ask us at the same time to reinstate the judgment of the District Court which did not issue an injunction.
1987.87-712,1,42461,thomas_a_barnico,,2526.923,2537.453,"In this case, we do not necessarily say that the relief would be inadequate."
1987.87-712,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2552.431,2560.897,"So in this case, the relief in the Court of Claims might well be adequate and the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit?"
1987.87-712,1,42461,thomas_a_barnico,,2560.897,2566.44,"Well, not necessarily, Your Honor."
1987.87-712,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2627.951,2637.597,No one in your client's position is going to ask in the District Court for money damages.
1987.87-712,1,42461,thomas_a_barnico,,2659.67,2660.241,No.
1987.87-712,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2667.998,2668.787,Exactly.
1987.87-712,1,42461,thomas_a_barnico,,2668.787,2672.75,Now the discussion... excuse me.
1987.87-712,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2672.75,2678.423,"Well, we are sort of confronted with how to interpret that Tucker Act."
1987.87-712,1,42461,thomas_a_barnico,,2708.554,2720.041,"In the latter case, you could not go to the District Court for declaratory and injunctive relief that is prohibited by some other statute."
1987.87-712,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2723.784,2726.736,It is not prohibited anywhere else.
1987.87-712,1,42461,thomas_a_barnico,,2739.433,2742.886,"Well, it would depend on the context, Your Honor."
1987.87-712,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2780.121,2781.781,But they are surely just an example.
1987.87-712,1,42461,thomas_a_barnico,,2803.854,2809.49,"Well, the line relies on a couple of factors."
1987.87-712,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2821.258,2824.51,These are jurisdictional questions.
1987.87-712,1,42461,thomas_a_barnico,,2837.938,2839.587,"Your Honor, I could not agree more about the waste of time."
1987.87-712,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2880.115,2900.249,"Well, Mr. Barnico, I take it that you do not urge the adoption of the line drawn by the Court of Appeals in the District of Columbia Circuit, that money damages refers to a sum of money used as compensatory relief, you are not urging that line?"
1987.87-712,1,42461,thomas_a_barnico,,2900.249,2904.22,"No, we are not, but we are urging something similar."
1987.87-712,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2954.403,2957.394,Can your test be stated in one sentence?
1987.87-712,1,42461,thomas_a_barnico,,2957.394,2983.133,Cases brought for injunctive and declaratory relief against adjudicatory decisions under grant-in-aid programs are within the jurisdiction of the District Courts under the waiver of sovereign immunity contained in Section 702.
1987.87-712,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2983.133,2990.747,And what if they include a prayer for money judgment against the government?
1987.87-712,1,42461,thomas_a_barnico,,2990.747,2998.314,"Then the rule takes more than one sentence, I am afraid."
1987.87-712,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3020.748,3034.475,"Well, why should not the District Court just say do you want to stay in this court or not; and if you do, you better withdraw your claim for money damages?"
1987.87-712,1,42461,thomas_a_barnico,,3034.475,3036.959,"Well, that is similar."
1987.87-712,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3045.134,3048.726,That just really raises the question of whether the Court of Appeals was correct.
1987.87-712,1,42461,thomas_a_barnico,,3048.726,3058.661,--And it raises the question of whether the state is going to be required to make a binding waiver of any monetary recovery.
1987.87-712,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3058.661,3061.723,It does not have to have a binding waiver.
1987.87-712,1,42461,thomas_a_barnico,,3070.189,3077.525,And it may require that litigant to simply drop whatever prayer that suggests the money judgment.
1987.87-712,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3077.525,3079.836,"What kind of prayer suggests that, by the way."
1987.87-712,1,42461,thomas_a_barnico,,3089.312,3096.566,"I do not think that it would be a prayer enough to defeat the jurisdiction of the District Court, no."
1987.87-712,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3096.566,3106.993,"Do you think that everybody would think that, to adopt a rule like that or something, can we train pleaders to put in or not put in that provision?"
1987.87-712,1,42461,thomas_a_barnico,,3106.993,3108.243,No.
1987.87-712,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3192.66,3207.078,"But Congress could have just as easily, and I think that the government argues here, have allocated jurisdiction on the basis that we want all claims for money judgment against the government to be tried in the Claims Court and go to the Federal Circuit."
1987.87-712,1,42461,thomas_a_barnico,,3215.614,3219.297,That is his competing argument on intent.
1987.87-712,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3248.065,3254.189,"Of course, your position means that the government can go around every Circuit relitigating the same issue."
1987.87-712,1,42461,thomas_a_barnico,,3254.189,3260.664,"And apparently, they are doing it in this very case."
1987.87-712,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3260.664,3261.553,"Well, I know that."
1987.87-712,1,42461,thomas_a_barnico,,3268.379,3270.161,"Well, they must have their reasons."
1987.87-712,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3320.713,3324.274,Does Massachusetts has an office here in Washington?
1987.87-712,1,42461,thomas_a_barnico,,3324.274,3329.407,I believe that the Governor has a small office.
1987.87-712,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3329.407,3330.649,I think that most states do.
1987.87-712,1,42461,thomas_a_barnico,,3334.062,3338.583,"I think that the point is much more important as to the beneficiaries, Your Honor."
1987.87-712,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3342.547,3346.441,"If it is under $10,000, they can bring the suit in District Court."
1987.87-712,1,42461,thomas_a_barnico,,3346.441,3348.851,The little Tucker Act applies.
1987.87-712,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3388.857,3391.25,"Thank you, Mr. Barnico."
1987.87-712,2,39134,roy_t_englert,,3393.351,3396.673,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1987.87-712,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3470.883,3472.936,"Thank you, Mr. Englert."
