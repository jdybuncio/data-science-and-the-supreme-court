2010.09-115,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.57,"We will hear argument next this morning in Case 09-115, Chamber of Commerce v. Whiting."
2010.09-115,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,8.52,10.622,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2010.09-115,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,111.717,125.958,"Why is that a problem if, as -- as the Federal statute requires and the State statutes require, you -- you have to show an intent to hire an unauthorized worker?"
2010.09-115,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,129.327,132.095,"--Well, the State statute has two components to it."
2010.09-115,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,134.981,135.416,Right.
2010.09-115,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,135.416,136.099,--But I don't see how that--
2010.09-115,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,136.099,136.566,Right.
2010.09-115,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,143.32,151.842,"--Well, I think part of the problem is that there -- it is never 100 percent clear precisely who is and who is not an authorized worker."
2010.09-115,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,197.287,201.739,"Well, I think what Arizona would answer to that is: Well, that's the only option the Federal Government left us."
2010.09-115,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,201.739,204.291,"Well, I'm quite sure that that's what Arizona will say."
2010.09-115,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,204.291,205.227,They excluded everything else.
2010.09-115,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,224.986,225.521,Right.
2010.09-115,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,239.428,249.217,"When I picked up this -- this brief and looked at this case, I thought: Oh, well, licensing, that is a defined term; I will look in Corpus Juris Secundum or ALR or something."
2010.09-115,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,267.928,268.378,Right.
2010.09-115,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,332.537,338.774,"That would be remarkable only because nobody would think that with this scheme in place, the Federal Government would not enforce it."
2010.09-115,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,371.929,377.066,"Justice Scalia, I -- I understand the point and I understand the motivation for why Arizona did what it did."
2010.09-115,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,443.056,447.69,Could I ask you this question to get back to the issue of whether this is a licensing law?
2010.09-115,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,447.69,448.107,--Sure.
2010.09-115,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,448.107,450.642,"""Licensing"" is not an unknown term."
2010.09-115,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,463.517,464.719,"That is true, Justice Alito."
2010.09-115,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,464.719,474.825,"Now, if the District of Columbia were, after having enacted this requirement some years ago, were to pass a new ordinance saying and"
2010.09-115,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,484.864,497.421,"Well, I -- I think the answer to that specific hypothetical is that's still not a licensing law, because it doesn't tie the grant of the license to the revocation powers."
2010.09-115,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,505.075,507.86,Why is it -- this is the same question you are answering.
2010.09-115,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,515.28,520.834,"--Well, I think the question is whether it is a licensing law within the meaning of what Congress intended."
2010.09-115,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,528.172,529.44,"Actually, there is."
2010.09-115,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,543.014,543.366,--Right.
2010.09-115,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,555.174,555.607,That's right.
2010.09-115,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,572.802,591.597,"--Well, the SEIU brief does a very nice job of explaining the -- the particular focus of Congress, obviously, on the Agricultural Workers Protection Act, and in particular -- which has tremendous significance in terms of narrowing the State's authority here, because obviously in their conforming amendments in that context--"
2010.09-115,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,591.597,593.264,"It could have named that, if that's it meant."
2010.09-115,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,593.264,594.132,"--I'm sorry, Your Honor?"
2010.09-115,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,594.132,598.351,"It could have named that, that particular licensing scheme, if that's what it meant."
2010.09-115,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,611.343,635.543,"Well, I think what it -- what Congress actually had in mind and what is the most natural reading of the licensing law is the fairly common situation where somebody violates Federal law, usually on the criminal side, and a State licensing entity finds out about a conviction of the Federal crime, and says: Oh, wait a second, we don't want people to have licenses under these circumstances, and therefore--"
2010.09-115,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,635.543,636.309,That's what they are saying.
2010.09-115,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,638.994,639.877,"--Well, no, no."
2010.09-115,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,642.029,647.767,--I think it's very common to talk about authority to do business within a State as -- as a license.
2010.09-115,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,700.165,701.698,"Actually, Justice Scalia, can I stop you there?"
2010.09-115,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,701.698,702.165,--Yes.
2010.09-115,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,702.7,710.604,"Because I think, actually, if you just received the articles of incorporation, that doesn't actually in all States necessarily give you the opportunity to do business."
2010.09-115,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,717.377,720.829,But you do not need the kind of a document that an out-of-State corporation needs.
2010.09-115,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,720.829,722.362,"No, you don't need that."
2010.09-115,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,736.171,737.371,Could I -- could I--
2010.09-115,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,737.371,738.54,--I'm sorry?
2010.09-115,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,738.54,741.159,--just -- just focus the question?
2010.09-115,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,770.31,770.679,Yes.
2010.09-115,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,772.362,778.182,So it really doesn't matter whether they are revoking their right to do business in the State.
2010.09-115,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,788.306,789.306,"They can't do it in Delaware, right."
2010.09-115,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,789.306,789.873,--All right.
2010.09-115,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,812.756,815.208,"Right, and the enforcement and investigation."
2010.09-115,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,815.208,820.409,"So I'm -- you know, how they define ""license"" or not is irrelevant to me."
2010.09-115,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,828.681,829.348,Right.
2010.09-115,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,829.348,833.935,--or what implicitly preempts that adjudication right.
2010.09-115,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,833.935,834.735,Right.
2010.09-115,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,834.735,838.906,"Because that is, for me, what the center of this question is."
2010.09-115,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,838.906,839.573,Right.
2010.09-115,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,863.104,863.688,Excuse me.
2010.09-115,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,868.258,868.992,--I'm sorry?
2010.09-115,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,868.992,872.294,"What does that mean, ""enforcement shall be uniform""?"
2010.09-115,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,872.294,874.496,The enforcement of the immigration laws shall be uniform.
2010.09-115,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,879.198,880.65,Is that any different from--
2010.09-115,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,880.65,881.783,--when it enacted section 115.
2010.09-115,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,881.783,885.97,--from what is the assumed situation with respect to all Federal rules?
2010.09-115,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,888.839,891.624,"Well, no, I -- I mean, I think it depends on the circumstances."
2010.09-115,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,911.435,916.239,Doesn't the exception for licensing mean that this isn't going to be completely uniform?
2010.09-115,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,930.833,931.283,Right.
2010.09-115,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,946.858,951.496,"But it can't be uniformity of sanction, because the court permitted licensing sanctions."
2010.09-115,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,951.496,952.929,"Right, there -- but only at that point."
2010.09-115,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,952.929,955.448,So let's go back to my question of adjudication.
2010.09-115,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,961.202,962.018,Investigate.
2010.09-115,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,962.018,966.589,"--whether someone has hired undocumented aliens, correct?"
2010.09-115,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,966.589,967.739,"Yes, Justice Sotomayor."
2010.09-115,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,985.919,989.637,I don't see the problem in diverse adjudication.
2010.09-115,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1007.166,1008.283,But Arizona doesn't purport--
2010.09-115,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1008.283,1010.051,Wouldn't that be a Federal question that -- that could be--
2010.09-115,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1010.051,1012.653,"--Well, Arizona doesn't purport to be enforcing Federal law here."
2010.09-115,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1018.807,1021.508,--Doesn't the State law basis refer to the Federal law?
2010.09-115,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1021.508,1024.158,"No, it -- actually, I don't think it--"
2010.09-115,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1024.158,1025.044,I thought it tracked it.
2010.09-115,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1025.044,1027.21,"--It tracks it, but it doesn't incorporate it."
2010.09-115,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1036.768,1037.785,"Thank you, counsel."
2010.09-115,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1052.528,1055.064,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2010.09-115,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1074.727,1082.881,"Just to pose there, we've had a little discussion about what licensing laws are, but we haven't talked at all about those last two words, ""and similar laws""."
2010.09-115,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1094.122,1099.176,"First let me tell you, Mr. Chief Justice, what we think a licensing law is and then deal with the ""similar"" question."
2010.09-115,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1116.904,1117.62,I'm sorry.
2010.09-115,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1135.549,1136.468,"Oh, absolutely."
2010.09-115,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1162.183,1163.349,Excuse me.
2010.09-115,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1180.311,1180.811,No.
2010.09-115,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1181.995,1187.064,Suppose I have a licensing law which says if you do this your license will be revoked.
2010.09-115,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1188.681,1190.683,--In general itself that is not a licensing law.
2010.09-115,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1198.106,1203.308,Why make exception for licensing laws therefore if you can't evoke a license under it?
2010.09-115,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1203.308,1210.562,"--Because, Justice Scalia, Congress wanted to preserve the States traditional power for licensing laws, which were about fitness to do business."
2010.09-115,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1212.247,1215.449,"Once you are in you can do whatever you like, you think that is what Congress meant?"
2010.09-115,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1224.472,1225.088,--No.
2010.09-115,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1227.089,1227.739,And revocation.
2010.09-115,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1241.849,1247.587,"Because, Justice Scalia, what Congress was trying to do was preserve the State's and localities traditional power for fitness to do business."
2010.09-115,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1262.347,1277.606,"So they should just -- Arizona should just amend all its licensing laws to require what they now require when the license is issued, and to say in each specific licensing law, that it can be revoked for the same -- on the same."
2010.09-115,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1277.606,1279.322,"Justice Scalia, that would solve that problem."
2010.09-115,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1282.224,1287.212,Even if they said and you have to renew your license every year or every six months?
2010.09-115,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1287.212,1288.328,That is correct.
2010.09-115,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1302.988,1313.612,You don't disagree that whether or not a company hires illegal workers is related to quality or asserted ability to do business or qualification?
2010.09-115,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1313.612,1319.033,A State could certainly make that part of its genuine fitness to do business law.
2010.09-115,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1343.065,1348.285,"Your argument sounds to me like, look at the law and see what its purpose is."
2010.09-115,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1366.311,1367.661,"Justice Sotomayor, I'm not talking about purpose."
2010.09-115,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1370.779,1377.783,The face of the statute talks only about if you hire undocumented aliens your license is revoked.
2010.09-115,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1377.783,1378.267,--Right.
2010.09-115,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1380.819,1384.521,But the savings clause says that it is okay.
2010.09-115,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1390.007,1390.824,--Right.
2010.09-115,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1399.113,1411.94,"If we disagree with you, could you answer the question I posed to your adversary, which is what makes the adjudication of status preempted?"
2010.09-115,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1411.94,1412.29,--Absolutely.
2010.09-115,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1444.911,1452.565,"At the time the statute was passed there were many, many State laws that adjudicated revocation of licenses."
2010.09-115,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1475.03,1486.504,"--It's undoubtedly the case that without the parenthetical, the mere parenthetical savings clause, that Arizona-like laws would be swept away as sanctions -- that these are sanctions imposed."
2010.09-115,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1510.603,1513.638,"Counsel, just so I make sure I understand your approach."
2010.09-115,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1541.306,1544.508,"Well, I think that the answer depends on what Congress is trying to get at."
2010.09-115,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1564.488,1575.879,"But the Chief Justice insists on an answer to his own question, but it seems to me his question is why isn't that still a licensing law?"
2010.09-115,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1575.879,1592.09,"If it has independent adjudication it is swept away by the first parts of the H2 statute which say, which say the provisions of this section preempt any State or local law imposing civil or criminal sanctions."
2010.09-115,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1592.09,1601.713,"But in the child labor example, why isn't that an addition to a regulatory licensing scheme so that it's a licensing law."
2010.09-115,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1601.713,1618.908,"Because if I understand -- I may not understand the hypothetical, but the word provisions refers to the entire subset, the entire statute in IRCA including the procedural protections, the procedures that follow for Federal enforcement of immigration laws."
2010.09-115,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1618.908,1621.091,If you -- excuse me.
2010.09-115,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1640.737,1641.271,Right.
2010.09-115,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1649.677,1651.629,Is it similar to a licensing law?
2010.09-115,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1651.629,1652.529,"No, I don't think so."
2010.09-115,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1664.353,1666.139,"No, no, that's all right."
2010.09-115,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1666.139,1666.805,"Thank you, counsel."
2010.09-115,2,36431,mary_r_ogrady,,1676.678,1677.845,Thank you.
2010.09-115,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1711.766,1729.543,"Have you answered the anomaly that Arizona cannot impose a fine even in a modest amount, but it can revoke someone's license to do business?"
2010.09-115,2,36431,mary_r_ogrady,,1729.543,1735.78,"Your Honor, we think that looking at the savings clause -- we don't view it as an anomaly."
2010.09-115,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1753.992,1758.194,But underlying Justice Ginsburg's question is why would Congress want to do that?
2010.09-115,2,36431,mary_r_ogrady,,1758.194,1778.94,"Well, I think it makes sense, Your Honor, because in terms of licensing, it -- it provides some accountability, because we are the entities that establish policy for our licensees and we are the ones accountable for whether that business remains in business or whether we are taking it away from them."
2010.09-115,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1778.94,1795.236,"Perhaps Congress never expected that the States would have to resort to such massive measures, and they probably wouldn't have if -- if the law had been uniformly enforced and vigorously enforced; right?"
2010.09-115,2,36431,mary_r_ogrady,,1799.188,1802.573,"Your Honor, certainly we waited until 2007."
2010.09-115,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1802.573,1807.043,So maybe Congress wasn't worried about it because it seemed very unlikely that anything like that would occur.
2010.09-115,2,36431,mary_r_ogrady,,1807.043,1808.209,Perhaps.
2010.09-115,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1821.886,1831.925,"The main -- the main anomaly it seemed to me to be this, that in the Federal Act, as -- that was the first point that the Chamber made, that it's a fairly careful balance."
2010.09-115,2,36431,mary_r_ogrady,,1903.605,1905.973,"--Your Honor, a couple of points."
2010.09-115,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1944.832,1958.425,I'm -- doesn't it frustrate the congressional intent when the Federal law says that the I-9 can be used for no purpose other than the Federal adjudication of whether a violation has occurred or not?
2010.09-115,2,36431,mary_r_ogrady,,1992.348,2005.739,"Your Honor, we don't think that the Federal law prohibits the use of an I-9 -- of the I-9 -- an employer's use of the I-9 in a State proceeding, that these can be used under the Federal proceeding or in the State."
2010.09-115,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2020.598,2021.784,That doesn't answer my point.
2010.09-115,2,36431,mary_r_ogrady,,2035.258,2041.412,Here's -- here is what the law says: It may not be used for purposes other than for enforcement of this chapter.
2010.09-115,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2052.136,2070.531,Isn't there -- isn't there a difference in saying that it may not be used for any purpose other than for enforcement of this chapter and other provisions of Federal law on one hand; and on the other hand saying it may not be used for any purpose other than in a Federal proceeding?
2010.09-115,2,36431,mary_r_ogrady,,2084.025,2085.308,"That's true, Your Honor."
2010.09-115,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2085.941,2087.91,Is the I-9 -- I do have a question on the I-9.
2010.09-115,2,36431,mary_r_ogrady,,2113.294,2114.827,"--No, that is not right, Your Honor."
2010.09-115,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2114.827,2125.268,"So if shows the driver's license under -- under Arizona law, if the -- if he shows a driver's license and Social Security card, the worker, the employer looks at it, the employer cannot be prosecuted?"
2010.09-115,2,36431,mary_r_ogrady,,2125.268,2126.152,"Well, Your Honor--"
2010.09-115,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2126.152,2126.952,Yes or no?
2010.09-115,2,36431,mary_r_ogrady,,2126.952,2134.623,"--We would need the evidence that the person knowingly employed the unauthorized alien, and a good faith defense--"
2010.09-115,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2134.623,2135.09,All right.
2010.09-115,2,36431,mary_r_ogrady,,2139.944,2142.527,"--No, Your Honor."
2010.09-115,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2143.563,2144.929,But under Federal law he is home free.
2010.09-115,2,36431,mary_r_ogrady,,2144.929,2148.883,--The substantive requirements under Arizona law and Federal law are the same.
2010.09-115,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2150.6,2151.919,So then he's home free?
2010.09-115,2,36431,mary_r_ogrady,,2189.592,2190.044,Okay.
2010.09-115,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2211.874,2225.717,"Can you explain that, E-Verify, because this is a Federal resource, and the Federal Government has said we want this to be voluntary."
2010.09-115,2,36431,mary_r_ogrady,,2242.327,2251.749,"We think the -- that question is answered by looking at the conflict preemption analysis, because Congress didn't address the role of the States with regard to E-Verify."
2010.09-115,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2252.451,2259.604,"I don't get into any preemption or not, but Arizona wants to use a Federal resource."
2010.09-115,2,36431,mary_r_ogrady,,2276.983,2290.41,"--Your Honor, we can -- as long as it's not a burden to the objectives of Congress, we think that we can require employers within our jurisdiction to use E-Verify."
2010.09-115,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2290.41,2291.826,Do -- do you make it mandatory?
2010.09-115,2,36431,mary_r_ogrady,,2291.826,2295.361,"Well, our statute says you shall use E-Verify."
2010.09-115,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2301.298,2302.733,You just -- you just don't get the safe harbor.
2010.09-115,2,36431,mary_r_ogrady,,2303.833,2304.467,That's right.
2010.09-115,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2317.56,2326.183,But you are taking the mechanism that Congress said will be a pilot program that is optional and you are making it mandatory.
2010.09-115,2,36431,mary_r_ogrady,,2334.403,2341.692,"Well, again, we look at the test for conflict preemption in terms of, does this make it impossible to comply with Federal law?"
2010.09-115,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2353.983,2358.202,"If they fail to do it, then they cannot receive any, quote,"
2010.09-115,2,36431,mary_r_ogrady,,2365.124,2367.66,That's what -- and that was added after this lawsuit was filed.
2010.09-115,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2367.66,2370.862,"I would think that the answer to Justice Scalia's question is, yes, there is that penalty."
2010.09-115,2,36431,mary_r_ogrady,,2372.495,2375.58,"Well, there's no penalty in terms of--"
2010.09-115,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2375.58,2376.448,You don't go to jail.
2010.09-115,2,36431,mary_r_ogrady,,2382.869,2383.919,--That is true under current law.
2010.09-115,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2385.121,2387.371,Does this lawsuit challenge that?
2010.09-115,2,36431,mary_r_ogrady,,2387.371,2388.739,"--It does not, Your Honor."
2010.09-115,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2389.689,2395.143,"You are under the old law, and the only sanction is you lose the safe harbor, if that's a sanction."
2010.09-115,2,36431,mary_r_ogrady,,2395.143,2395.893,--That's right.
2010.09-115,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2396.643,2414.391,"--So in answer to Justice Breyer's earlier question, in fact, relying on the I-9 does not provide a safe harbor, because under the E-Verify system you can't just rely on the I-9 forms and statutes."
2010.09-115,2,36431,mary_r_ogrady,,2416.323,2421.644,"Well, Your Honor, we have the same -- it's modelled after the Federal law."
2010.09-115,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2427.964,2436.804,"The Federal law and the State law do seem to be exactly the same on this point, but I have -- I don't understand how these two provisions fit together when E-Verify is used."
2010.09-115,2,36431,mary_r_ogrady,,2493.224,2520.307,"And Justice Alito, we haven't wrestled that in practical application, and I'm not aware of them reaching that point under the Federal system, either, but -- because it does seem at some point, if you -- that the system should work, that if you have used I-9 and you get back a final non-confirmation, not a tentative non-confirmation, that that employee is unauthorized, that that, you know, seems like it should carry greater weight in an enforcement action."
2010.09-115,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2526.695,2531.413,Could you -- I wasn't quite sure what she meant.
2010.09-115,2,36431,mary_r_ogrady,,2553.362,2573.657,"I think, Your Honor, perhaps if we -- perhaps in terms of what are the outer limits of our definition of ""license"", and they were saying that we are outside the definition of licensing and similar laws, in a particular case, perhaps that would be an as-applied type challenge."
2010.09-115,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2600.493,2606.397,"So you think after this case we can look forward to the cases, one by one, for all the various types of licenses?"
2010.09-115,2,36431,mary_r_ogrady,,2613.384,2614.784,"Your Honor, my hope is that we--"
2010.09-115,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2614.784,2616.253,"We are really wasting our time here, aren't we?"
2010.09-115,2,36431,mary_r_ogrady,,2616.253,2619.121,"--My hope is, Your Honor, that we get sufficient guidance."
2010.09-115,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2619.121,2636.416,"Wouldn't it be easier, if that is Justice Scalia's concern, to take the Solicitor General's position, that if you are adjudicating good faith or intent differently in any way from the Federal government, that it's granted?"
2010.09-115,2,36431,mary_r_ogrady,,2648.474,2659.782,"No, Your Honor, and -- because I was trying to give some examples of the kinds of things that may come up as a practical matter, but I think we can get the guidance from this Court."
2010.09-115,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2662.483,2664.4,Then let me ask the question directly.
2010.09-115,2,36431,mary_r_ogrady,,2708.128,2710.297,--I think those would both be problems.
2010.09-115,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2717.451,2718.017,Excuse me.
2010.09-115,2,36431,mary_r_ogrady,,2769.419,2777.172,"Because I think what Congress preserved for us was our ability to impose sanctions, including the suspension and revocation of State laws."
2010.09-115,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2788.63,2794.217,"Now, what I was looking at specifically is ""Federal law says""."
2010.09-115,2,36431,mary_r_ogrady,,2889.829,2893.482,"And I am hoping I am being clear, Justice Breyer."
2010.09-115,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2898.701,2899.386,"Well, where?"
2010.09-115,2,36431,mary_r_ogrady,,2905.772,2906.44,Okay.
2010.09-115,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2912.928,2917.48,"Well, it's on page 184 to 185 of the appendix petition, isn't it?"
2010.09-115,2,36431,mary_r_ogrady,,2917.48,2931.056,"And 178(a) is the provision -- for the purposes of this section, employer that establishes it has complied in good faith with the requirements of 8 U.S.C. 1324a(b), establishes an affirmative defense, et cetera."
2010.09-115,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2979.12,2979.953,"Okay, thank you."
2010.09-115,2,36431,mary_r_ogrady,,2980.872,2981.588,Certainly.
2010.09-115,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2985.29,2996.915,"Just so you know, I interpret your answer as confirming the implication of Justice Breyer's questions that there is a very substantial difference in Federal and State law on this point."
2010.09-115,2,36431,mary_r_ogrady,,3013.044,3015.177,--And our standards are the same.
2010.09-115,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3018.53,3020.63,So you think you are home free under State law?
2010.09-115,2,36431,mary_r_ogrady,,3020.63,3027.553,--To the extent that you should be home free and you would have the benefit of that good faith defense.
2010.09-115,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3027.553,3029.586,It's an affirmative defense under both.
2010.09-115,2,36431,mary_r_ogrady,,3029.586,3031.005,"Yes, Your Honor."
2010.09-115,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3031.005,3035.373,But the main point -- I will check that.
2010.09-115,2,36431,mary_r_ogrady,,3040.194,3040.827,That's right.
2010.09-115,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3040.827,3045.098,But then we are still stuck with this enormous discrepancy in penalty.
2010.09-115,2,36431,mary_r_ogrady,,3060.607,3065.678,"I think, Your Honor, that that is the natural consequence of the savings clause that Congress itself wrote--"
2010.09-115,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3065.678,3082.121,"The savings clause itself, the word licensing, not everyone looks at this, but I did look at the legislative history and when you look at that paragraph on page 39 of the red brief, it seems to me that that paragraph says what it means."
2010.09-115,2,36431,mary_r_ogrady,,3158.604,3163.989,"--Well, first, of course, we would focus on the text where Congress could have but did not--"
2010.09-115,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3163.989,3173.447,"I said yes, I got broad licensing -- but let's deal with the part where you look at their explanation as to why they put those words there."
2010.09-115,2,36431,mary_r_ogrady,,3173.447,3175.564,--Okay.
2010.09-115,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3246.626,3252.28,Can you also explain the I-9?
2010.09-115,2,36431,mary_r_ogrady,,3273.527,3286.287,"--They work in our system, Your Honor, as they do under the Federal law, under -- that you get a rebuttable presumption if you -- in your favor if you used E-Verify, the affirmative defense if you've used I-9."
2010.09-115,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3426.61,3428.729,"Thank you, counsel."
2010.09-115,3,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3431.264,3438.435,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and once again, may it please the Court:"
2010.09-115,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3516.203,3523.024,"What can -- Mr. Phillips, what can the State do that would be complementary rather than conflicting?"
2010.09-115,3,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3523.024,3557.28,"I -- it seems to me the easiest -- and of course, this has nothing to do with what Arizona does -- but the easiest is, if a -- an employer is convicted of -- of violating IRCA and a criminal sanction, and he happens to be a barber, and the State licensing law says if you are convicted of a -- of a Federal crime you will lose your license, it is available to the State under those circumstances -- and I think this is exactly what Congress had in mind -- to issue a notice to show cause why that particular person shouldn't have the license revoked and then go from there."
2010.09-115,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3557.28,3561.249,Convicted by -- by a Federal Government that hasn't gone after many convictions.
2010.09-115,3,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3561.249,3562.666,Justice Scalia--
2010.09-115,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3562.666,3563.601,That's the whole problem.
2010.09-115,3,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3563.601,3569.338,"--Well no, but Justice Scalia, it seems to me that the whole question here -- and first of all, I don't think pre-emption can be a moving target."
2010.09-115,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3607.797,3614.717,"Well, except -- well, you are just kind of blinking over the Savings Clause -- except through licensing and similar laws."
2010.09-115,3,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3619.003,3640.268,"--Well, if you -- if you interpret the Savings Clause as I do, which means truly as a supplement to Federal -- Federal adjudication, then it is a very narrow limitation on that basis, because at that point you have already invoked the entirety of the Federal scheme and it doesn't modify the balance on those broader legal issues, Your Honor."
2010.09-115,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3640.268,3641.218,"Thank you, counsel."
