1975.74-1148,0,44230,walter_w_christy,,0.0,61.416,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1975.74-1148,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,185.831,191.532,Are you attacking the entire Mississippi regulation or just Section 11 of it?
1975.74-1148,0,44230,walter_w_christy,,191.532,214.284,"Well Your Honor, just Section 11 is the -- is the only section that deals with out-of-state processors, which is -- well, in answer to your question, only Section 11 and only part of Section 11, the part that requires that the processor obtain a reciprocity agreement from the State in which its plant is located."
1975.74-1148,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,214.284,219.682,"I think the rest of it is not for, it said it is (Voice Overlapping) even in the record or in your brief of anything."
1975.74-1148,0,44230,walter_w_christy,,221.118,224.992,"It is a very confined issue, Your Honors."
1975.74-1148,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,319.217,325.045,"(Voice Overlap) conditions on getting into Mississippi, they must meet certain standards?"
1975.74-1148,0,44230,walter_w_christy,,325.045,327.171,There is no question in this case.
1975.74-1148,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,339.11,341.079,And you do not contest those provisions?
1975.74-1148,0,44230,walter_w_christy,,341.079,344.378,"No sir, only the reciprocity provision."
1975.74-1148,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,362.063,365.884,(Inaudible) nothing but a rule of administrative (Inaudible)
1975.74-1148,0,44230,walter_w_christy,,365.884,378.752,I suggest Your Honor that the statue in question is -- is an economic measure passed by Mississippi to ensure that its processors have an available market before it lets in foreign competition.
1975.74-1148,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,394.463,401.886,"But, you would not insist that if they wanted to inspect that they would have to pay the cost, you would pay the cost?"
1975.74-1148,0,44230,walter_w_christy,,401.886,406.613,"That was the basis -- well, I do not think that question is before the Court."
1975.74-1148,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,412.139,421.706,No one has ever suggested that it would burden Interstate Commerce to -- for -- for the state to spread the cost of inspection among those whom it inspects?
1975.74-1148,0,44230,walter_w_christy,,421.706,423.202,I was going to point Your Honor that the Dixie Dairy --
1975.74-1148,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,423.202,424.675,If they are outside the State?
1975.74-1148,0,44230,walter_w_christy,,424.675,450.273,"The Dixie Dairy Case, which is cited by Mississippi and was also relied on by the three-judge court to deny the relief, this was a three-judge court in the Seventh Circuit, which held that the City of Chicago had the right to require out-of-state inspections of Indiana milk and that this was not a burden."
1975.74-1148,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,476.536,477.965,You do not need to take on that on here?
1975.74-1148,0,44230,walter_w_christy,,477.965,480.652,I do not believe that this case requires that.
1975.74-1148,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,672.024,677.019,Between whom is the agreement (Inaudible)?
1975.74-1148,0,44230,walter_w_christy,,677.019,688.309,"It is a statement, when -- when you apply for a certification, the Health Officer from Mississippi sends you a form stating the requirements."
1975.74-1148,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,700.537,701.927,That authority has to sign it?
1975.74-1148,0,44230,walter_w_christy,,701.927,705.216,That authority has to sign it and of course Louisiana --
1975.74-1148,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,705.216,708.276,There is no other way of complying with the requirement?
1975.74-1148,0,44230,walter_w_christy,,708.276,711.459,There has been none and Louisiana’s position --
1975.74-1148,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,711.459,712.635,(Inaudible) place of the requirement?
1975.74-1148,0,44230,walter_w_christy,,712.635,713.709,No sir.
1975.74-1148,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,713.709,717.076,You simply have to get to Louisiana’s authorities to sign that form?
1975.74-1148,0,44230,walter_w_christy,,717.076,717.477,Yes sir.
1975.74-1148,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,717.477,721.313,In the form that is printed by Mississippi?
1975.74-1148,0,44230,walter_w_christy,,721.313,728.161,"And this we have been able to do, but Louisiana's position is, we do not -- we are not going to sign a reciprocity agreement."
1975.74-1148,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,736.986,741.664,"Louisiana does not have a reciprocity agreement with any other state, does it?"
1975.74-1148,0,44230,walter_w_christy,,741.664,742.7,No sir.
1975.74-1148,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,742.7,747.259,And there is no statutory authorization for it?
1975.74-1148,0,44230,walter_w_christy,,747.259,763.315,"There is, I believe the -- the regulations under which Louisiana operates, give the -- give the authorities, the discretion to enter into a reciprocity agreement if they want to, but they have never done this."
1975.74-1148,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,763.315,767.938,"Does the record shows why not, if they have the authority to do it?"
1975.74-1148,0,44230,walter_w_christy,,767.938,779.111,"The record contains copies of all the -- the various statutes and regulations, but I do not believe there is any explanation of why they have never entered into it."
1975.74-1148,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,861.388,873.651,"The justification, as I understood at least on the part of the Sate is that these four others are permitted to do business under -- by virtue of a Grandfather Provision, they were doing business at the time this--"
1975.74-1148,0,44230,walter_w_christy,,873.651,874.66,That is what I understand --
1975.74-1148,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,874.66,878.069,Or it came into effect that you presumably were not --
1975.74-1148,0,44230,walter_w_christy,,878.069,883.926,And -- and the State and the claim is made that we should have attacked the Grandfather Provision.
1975.74-1148,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,915.446,922.973,Is it a fact that these dairies were doing business in the Sate at the time of the enactment of the law and that you were not?
1975.74-1148,0,44230,walter_w_christy,,922.973,924.052,"Yes, that is correct."
1975.74-1148,1,27522,heber_a_ladner_jr,,969.055,971.688,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please --
1975.74-1148,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1028.769,1032.674,You do not suggest that this milk does not need the health standards?
1975.74-1148,1,27522,heber_a_ladner_jr,,1032.674,1047.818,"I am saying that once a Certificate of Reciprocity is not forthcoming, substantial compliance with Section 11 is impossible and that an out-of-state producer is then, thrown back upon --"
1975.74-1148,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1047.818,1052.89,You do not say that milk is a -- not need -- does not need health standards?
1975.74-1148,1,27522,heber_a_ladner_jr,,1052.89,1054.387,We do say that it fails to meet health standards.
1975.74-1148,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1054.387,1056.543,Because of the reciprocity provision?
1975.74-1148,1,27522,heber_a_ladner_jr,,1056.543,1060.424,"Well, because of the standards applicable to domestic producers."
1975.74-1148,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1120.353,1125.172,"Is it possible that Louisiana standards maybe higher than Mississippi’s, is it not?"
1975.74-1148,1,27522,heber_a_ladner_jr,,1125.172,1127.906,"Your Honor, on this record I would think not."
1975.74-1148,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1155.308,1161.387,"But, is the position Mississippi here so much different than that of the City of Madison in the Dean Milk Case?"
1975.74-1148,1,27522,heber_a_ladner_jr,,1175.782,1187.404,"Yes, Mr. Justice Rehnquist we do, but we say that we -- we are not isolating ourselves, because of the fact that the Section 11 Reciprocity Policy has worked, is produced."
1975.74-1148,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1222.155,1238.003,Is -- but is the only goal of the Interstate Commerce Clause to make sure that Mississippi has enough milk coming into suit its needs or is it not also to give the Louisiana producers a right to send milk into the Mississippi if there are no health objections to it?
1975.74-1148,1,27522,heber_a_ladner_jr,,1238.003,1242.606,We think it is somewhat broader than just giving Louisiana processors the right to come in.
1975.74-1148,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1257.868,1260.169,But it -- it is not just a minor burden on them.
1975.74-1148,1,27522,heber_a_ladner_jr,,1266.874,1274.533,"Well, we say to that the Sate of Louisiana has the power to execute a reciprocity agreement."
1975.74-1148,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1274.533,1279.566,But as your -- as your opponent points out A & P is not the State of Louisiana?
1975.74-1148,1,27522,heber_a_ladner_jr,,1279.566,1291.268,"That is correct, but we -- we think that there is presently some litigation in Louisiana State Courts that has come up since this case, we frankly question why Louisiana was not sued first?"
1975.74-1148,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1304.418,1307.797,"Who do you sure -- who do you sue in the Louisiana, the legislature?"
1975.74-1148,1,27522,heber_a_ladner_jr,,1307.797,1313.539,The Sate Health Officer for failing to carry out his duty under paragraph 5 B1.
1975.74-1148,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1313.539,1319.138,How do you work out this duty on the part of Louisiana to reciprocate?
1975.74-1148,1,27522,heber_a_ladner_jr,,1319.138,1325.95,"Well, I say that the State -- the Louisiana regulation reads as follows: the State Health Officer …"
1975.74-1148,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1325.95,1326.615,What page are you on?
1975.74-1148,1,27522,heber_a_ladner_jr,,1326.615,1328.09,I am on page 8 of my brief.
1975.74-1148,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1328.09,1328.681,Thank you.
1975.74-1148,1,27522,heber_a_ladner_jr,,1328.681,1342.308,"“The State Health Officer may accept the certificate of inspection of a duly authorized government representative, agent or agency of such other State, wherein such products are produced.”"
1975.74-1148,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1342.308,1352.702,"Why should not -- why should not a Mississippi producer sue the Louisiana, he has the same constitutional rights to free flow of products among the states?"
1975.74-1148,1,27522,heber_a_ladner_jr,,1352.702,1355.572,"Perhaps, one should, one has not."
1975.74-1148,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1378.9,1392.32,"If Loui -- if Loui -- if Mississippi's health standards and the product -- and the production of milk in Mississippi are comparable to Louisiana’s, Louisiana probably cannot keep them out, can they?"
1975.74-1148,1,27522,heber_a_ladner_jr,,1392.32,1403.39,"Well, that covet rule that Mississippi milk could not be kept out, but significantly under the proviso that Mississippi milk must meet Louisiana standards to come in."
1975.74-1148,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1403.39,1404.606,You do not object to that?
1975.74-1148,1,27522,heber_a_ladner_jr,,1404.606,1404.88,"No, I do not."
1975.74-1148,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1447.232,1453.651,"Well, you could turn -- you could turn them down on the basis of their failure to meet your domestic standards then, could you not?"
1975.74-1148,1,27522,heber_a_ladner_jr,,1453.651,1456.266,"Yes, Your Honor we could, we could."
1975.74-1148,2,44230,walter_w_christy,,2207.3,2211.144,"Just briefly, Your Honor."
1975.74-1148,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2321.96,2322.647,Thank you gentlemen.
