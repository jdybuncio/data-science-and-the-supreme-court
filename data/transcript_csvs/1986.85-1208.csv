1986.85-1208,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.022,"We will hear argument first this morning in Number 85-1208, Fall River Dyeing & Finishing Corporation versus National Labor Relations Board."
1986.85-1208,0,28522,ira_drogin,,13.058,27.115,"Mr. Chief Justice, and say it please the Court:"
1986.85-1208,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,63.072,73.679,"--heard enough of the employees of the former owner, that a majority of his present employees are those?"
1986.85-1208,0,28522,ira_drogin,,73.679,75.131,"--That is correct, Your Honor."
1986.85-1208,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,166.789,183.067,"Mr. Drogin, I take it that in general we have concluded that NLRB findings of fact are going to be treated as conclusive unless they are not supported by substantial evidence."
1986.85-1208,0,28522,ira_drogin,,185.685,186.752,"I certainly do, Your Honor."
1986.85-1208,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,186.752,187.252,All right.
1986.85-1208,0,28522,ira_drogin,,203.064,204.264,"I am, indeed, Your Honor."
1986.85-1208,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,206.264,222.558,"It isn't clear to me from your petition and the statement of questions whether we are being asked to review the case to find out if there is substantial evidence, or if you are asking us to employ a new legal test or standard in these cases."
1986.85-1208,0,28522,ira_drogin,,222.558,224.191,--I think the answer is both.
1986.85-1208,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,232.247,234.466,"You mean, there is no substantial evidence?"
1986.85-1208,0,28522,ira_drogin,,234.466,235.166,--That is right.
1986.85-1208,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,236.818,239.468,"So, you are asking us to make a factual determination?"
1986.85-1208,0,28522,ira_drogin,,239.468,240.787,"--Yes, I am, Your Honor."
1986.85-1208,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,287.501,299.141,Well you think we should adopt a rule that you only... you time the inquiry when there is a full complement of employees rather than a substantial and representative complement?
1986.85-1208,0,28522,ira_drogin,,299.141,301.475,"--Yes, in a slow build-up situation."
1986.85-1208,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,319.27,328.143,"May I ask, just so I understand your position, assume you have a takeover of the assets and no employees, and you add 20 employees a month until you get up to the full complement."
1986.85-1208,0,28522,ira_drogin,,339.184,346.622,--I would think that you have to determine at the outset what the employer's plans are and when the full complement--
1986.85-1208,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,346.622,351.158,"Well, I would assume the plans are to keep hiring until you get the full complement, but you won't have that done for another three or four months."
1986.85-1208,0,28522,ira_drogin,,355.312,368.886,"--In a situation where there is a slow buildup, and particularly, Your honor, in a situation such as here where there is no rational or factual basis for the underlying presumption that the--"
1986.85-1208,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,368.886,370.322,"Well, but that's a separate question."
1986.85-1208,0,28522,ira_drogin,,388.533,392.485,"--Unless, Your Honor, the takeover is a takeover of a going business--"
1986.85-1208,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,392.485,392.735,Right.
1986.85-1208,0,28522,ira_drogin,,393.185,399.322,"--virtually intact, virtually the entire labor force, but not in a slow buildup situation where there is an assets purchase."
1986.85-1208,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,399.322,415.516,"Yes, but if he's 75 percent... he has 75 percent of his complement and all of them are prior employees, when he gets to be a full complement there is still going to be a majority of the former employees."
1986.85-1208,0,28522,ira_drogin,,415.516,416.616,"Well, that's an assumption."
1986.85-1208,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,420.068,420.234,"You mean, he's not going to fire anybody?"
1986.85-1208,0,28522,ira_drogin,,421.418,422.268,--Certainly not.
1986.85-1208,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,424.453,429.507,"But in this case, in this case it was possible but not in the example I just gave."
1986.85-1208,0,28522,ira_drogin,,433.876,434.994,--That is correct.
1986.85-1208,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,543.347,549.536,"Mr. Drogin, I take it from your remarks that you do not expect... you are not asking us to overrule Burns?"
1986.85-1208,0,28522,ira_drogin,,549.536,550.719,Certainly not.
1986.85-1208,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,582.59,596.582,"What's the cutoff mate for... you would abandon this argument if there had been a union certification election within a year, within a year before what--"
1986.85-1208,0,28522,ira_drogin,,596.582,598.884,Within a year before--
1986.85-1208,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,598.884,600.401,"--A year before the transfer of ownership, or--"
1986.85-1208,0,28522,ira_drogin,,600.401,601.336,--Not the transfer.
1986.85-1208,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,601.336,602.352,--within a year before the full complement?
1986.85-1208,0,28522,ira_drogin,,602.352,603.92,"Before the full complement, Your Honor."
1986.85-1208,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,624.001,631.155,Is there any way that a union can protect itself under your theory without holding an election every year?
1986.85-1208,0,28522,ira_drogin,,631.155,634.107,"--Well, certainly, Your Honor."
1986.85-1208,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,652.484,653.853,They had a contract here?
1986.85-1208,0,28522,ira_drogin,,653.853,656.555,"--Yes, and that is quite interesting, Your Honor."
1986.85-1208,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,656.555,662.309,"I thought you said they had to have had, within a year, a certification."
1986.85-1208,0,28522,ira_drogin,,662.309,666.161,That is what this Court said in Burns.
1986.85-1208,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,666.161,667.278,Is that what you say?
1986.85-1208,0,28522,ira_drogin,,667.278,669.63,I think that that's the proper rule.
1986.85-1208,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,669.63,672.582,That in this case they should have had an election every year?
1986.85-1208,0,28522,ira_drogin,,672.582,674.767,"No, not every year, Your Honor."
1986.85-1208,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,674.767,676.636,How could they have protected themselves?
1986.85-1208,0,28522,ira_drogin,,676.636,679.854,"Well, it's not a question of the union protecting itself."
1986.85-1208,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,690.359,694.847,"Well, how can employees do it, other than to every year challenge the union?"
1986.85-1208,0,28522,ira_drogin,,694.847,699.982,"Well, here, Your Honor, we have a very unusual situation."
1986.85-1208,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,699.982,700.701,You sure do.
1986.85-1208,0,28522,ira_drogin,,700.701,705.988,"Because the union, for all intents and purposes, was gone from the picture."
1986.85-1208,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,709.607,710.523,"You're going behind the contract, then."
1986.85-1208,0,28522,ira_drogin,,710.523,711.29,"--Pardon me, Your Honor?"
1986.85-1208,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,711.29,713.075,"You're going behind the contract, then."
1986.85-1208,0,28522,ira_drogin,,713.075,715.761,I'm not going behind--
1986.85-1208,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,715.761,717.594,Are you telling me that the contract doesn't exist?
1986.85-1208,0,28522,ira_drogin,,717.594,720.879,--That is a factual statement.
1986.85-1208,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,762.873,765.675,"Mr. Drogin, I have been thinking about your answer to my previous question."
1986.85-1208,0,28522,ira_drogin,,789.606,797.094,"That is correct, Your honor, correct, and in this particular case that was not hard to determine because the employer had immediate plans."
1986.85-1208,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,849.262,858.501,"Mr. Drogin, to change the subject little bit, what percentage of the business of the new company is with customers of the old company?"
1986.85-1208,0,28522,ira_drogin,,858.501,866.206,"Including the parent company of Fall River, slightly more than 50 percent."
1986.85-1208,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,880.116,884.985,Did the new company carry forward both aspects of the old company's business?
1986.85-1208,0,28522,ira_drogin,,884.985,886.585,"Absolutely not, Your Honor."
1986.85-1208,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,926.312,930.18,May I ask you a question about the bankruptcy sale.
1986.85-1208,0,28522,ira_drogin,,932.882,938.72,"I don't know the answer to that, Your Honor, I have to tell you."
1986.85-1208,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,938.72,941.655,"If would have to be the high bidder under your law, would it not?"
1986.85-1208,0,28522,ira_drogin,,941.655,945.024,"Under the Massachusetts law, I would assume that it was."
1986.85-1208,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,973.809,981.53,"If I recall correctly, Fall River was formed for the very purpose of buying these assets, wasn't it?"
1986.85-1208,0,28522,ira_drogin,,981.53,984.982,"I disagree with that, Your Honor."
1986.85-1208,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,987.565,988.6,The Board found.
1986.85-1208,0,28522,ira_drogin,,988.6,989.367,--Pardon me?
1986.85-1208,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,989.367,990.267,The Board found.
1986.85-1208,0,28522,ira_drogin,,994.569,997.254,"The Board argued it, that it was formed."
1986.85-1208,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,999.889,1001.823,That was not part of the findings of the Board below?
1986.85-1208,0,28522,ira_drogin,,1001.823,1006.777,"--That's not my recollection, that it was formed for that purpose."
1986.85-1208,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1006.777,1011.18,"If it was part of the findings, of course we'd have to defer to it unless there was no substantial evidence."
1986.85-1208,0,28522,ira_drogin,,1011.18,1011.78,That's correct.
1986.85-1208,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1035.296,1040.7,"I thought there was an officer of the defunct company, who also went in it with him, isn't that--"
1986.85-1208,0,28522,ira_drogin,,1040.7,1041.733,That is correct.
1986.85-1208,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1041.733,1042.415,--The vice president?
1986.85-1208,0,28522,ira_drogin,,1042.415,1045.652,"He did, but at the time in late August 1982--"
1986.85-1208,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1045.652,1048.436,"And the two of them formed this new company, is the way the Board describes it."
1986.85-1208,0,28522,ira_drogin,,1048.436,1053.673,"--Well, I think that's a bit of an overstatement, when you say that they formed the company."
1986.85-1208,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1278.251,1280.684,How did the Labor Board deal with this argument?
1986.85-1208,0,28522,ira_drogin,,1280.684,1300.097,"--Well, the Labor Board-apparently unfair labor practice charges were filed with regard to these defaults in payment, and those charges were dismissed because it was not a repudiation, I think is the test that the National Labor Relations Board uses."
1986.85-1208,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1323.297,1330.434,I'm just a little puzzled as to what the proposition this argument is directed to... what proposition of the law does this support?
1986.85-1208,0,28522,ira_drogin,,1330.434,1343.193,"--The proposition that I am addressing this to, Your Honor, is that the fundamental policy of the Act is the protection of employees' rights to be represented by a union of their choice."
1986.85-1208,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1348.028,1354.132,"But they had been recognized for 20 or 30 years, hadn't they, as the bargaining agent of these employees?"
1986.85-1208,0,28522,ira_drogin,,1354.132,1355.084,--That is correct.
1986.85-1208,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1355.084,1362.338,Does that give them a different a lesser right to bargain on behalf of the employees than if they had been certified Just more recently?
1986.85-1208,0,28522,ira_drogin,,1362.338,1370.528,"Well, that's the whole question, whether Fall River is required under these circumstances to bargain with this union under the successorship theory."
1986.85-1208,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1390.841,1420.36,"Mr. Drogin, didn't the Board consider the expression of displeasure with the union that you are referring to, and didn't the Board think that that could be explained on a quite different basis; to wit, that these people weren't approached until quite late on and they thought that if the old union were certified and went ahead with its unfair labor practice complaint, they wouldn't be able to get a wage increase for the next few months?"
1986.85-1208,0,28522,ira_drogin,,1423.228,1426.93,I don't know if they made that as a factual finding.
1986.85-1208,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1426.93,1428.263,"Well, this is a credibility point, isn't it?"
1986.85-1208,0,28522,ira_drogin,,1430.982,1435.786,"Well, Your Honor, I don't think it's second-guessing them on a credibility finding."
1986.85-1208,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1448.444,1461.317,"But they chose not to believe them, and they thought that the explanation for all the signatures disapproving the union that they got was was simply that the people thought if they approved the union they wouldn't get a wage increase because an unfair labor practice complaint would be in the works."
1986.85-1208,0,28522,ira_drogin,,1461.317,1498.359,"I think the reason that was applied, Your Honor, and this was approved by the Court of Appeals, was that the timing of the petition would not allow... or the petitions, rejection petitions, would not allow... was improper because the Board and the Court said that the petitions had to have come to the attention of the employer before the substantial complement date and because they arrived after that, yet before the full complement date, that they were irrelevant and had no bearing on the issue."
1986.85-1208,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1502.494,1515.321,You made the point in your main brief that it's very important to have some certitude for the employer as to when the test of majority favoring the union or not is to be applied.
1986.85-1208,0,28522,ira_drogin,,1525.644,1535.984,"Well, I think that, Your Honor, the harm that's done is that the employer is found to have violated the National Labor Relations Act, which we consider a violation to be a very serious thing."
1986.85-1208,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1535.984,1542.471,"If there is no penalty imposed, are there any other legal effects of that finding?"
1986.85-1208,0,28522,ira_drogin,,1542.471,1550.994,"Well, there is no monetary fine, of course, that can be considered by the Board in further unfair labor practice proceedings with regard to the remedy that may be applied."
1986.85-1208,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1605.879,1606.962,"Thank you, Mr. Drogin."
1986.85-1208,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,1608.495,1620.972,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1986.85-1208,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1733.062,1750.606,"Mr. Cohen, isn't the expectation of an imminent expansion in the number of employees a factor to be taken into consideration in applying the Board's substantial and representative complement approach?"
1986.85-1208,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,1750.606,1754.141,Yes.
1986.85-1208,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1754.141,1763.431,"And shouldn't it be a factor, if it is known that there is going to be a significant expansion in the number of employees?"
1986.85-1208,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,1771.437,1772.037,Yes.
1986.85-1208,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1792.766,1793.166,All right.
1986.85-1208,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,1793.166,1794.249,--and the likelihood at expansion.
1986.85-1208,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1794.249,1794.616,All right.
1986.85-1208,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,1834.743,1836.976,"Yes, I do."
1986.85-1208,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1836.976,1856.572,"I think these are troublesome cases, and the reason they are troublesome is because the employer is in a dilemma here about the timing of when he is forced... or when the employing unit is forced to look at the situation of a representative and substantial complement."
1986.85-1208,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,1856.572,1863.16,"First, I think the Board did properly take the facts into account here."
1986.85-1208,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1962.759,1981.153,"Well, are you just saying the Board didn't have to give credence to the fact that they planned a second shift, that the Board's decision can be supported on the ground that they didn't have to accord credibility to the plan of a double shift?"
1986.85-1208,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,1981.153,1981.52,No.

1986.85-1208,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,2029.201,2029.636,--No.
1986.85-1208,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2032.438,2043.544,"Well, by then they knew that a shift, a second shift had been added, so why weren't they interested in looking at what really happened?"
1986.85-1208,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,2043.544,2102.666,"They were looking at, first, the fact that there was at all times very substantial continuity in the bargaining unit... even as of May 2nd there was, as I say by my count they were only a half a Sterlingwale employee short... but also at the fact that as a successor employer starts up, its ultimate objection, and whether it will get there may not be clear and the operative rule for employers and for unions ought to be that when the enterprise has reached substantially normal operation the employees are entitled at that point to a determination of their right to be represented."
1986.85-1208,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2102.666,2117.759,"If the Board had looked at the situation as of mid or late April, would it have still been able to find at that time that this union should have been recognized?"
1986.85-1208,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,2117.759,2137.44,"The Board's rule is that it looks for a majority of a substantial and representative complement and on April 22, as I says there was slightly less than a majority."
1986.85-1208,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2139.958,2147.73,"I agree with you, Mr. Cohen, that there ought to be a clear rule, that the employer ought to know and the Board ought to know."
1986.85-1208,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,2182.368,2183.903,--That may be.
1986.85-1208,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2189.14,2201.632,"If we're not sure about it, then you know, your brief says no big deal, if the employer makes a mistake as to when that magic moment of a substantial and representative complement arrives, nothing happens except he is cited for an unfair labor practice."
1986.85-1208,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,2216.975,2222.028,"--I don't think that the employer is, in fact, in any such puzzlement."
1986.85-1208,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2243.275,2245.311,Do you know as of what time that is being measured?
1986.85-1208,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,2245.311,2250.715,--And he knows that he is in substantially normal operation and he knows that he has filled--
1986.85-1208,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2250.715,2256.35,"What is substantially normal operation... what does ""substantial"" ad ""representative complement"" mean?"
1986.85-1208,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,2258.769,2266.74,"--I was going to say, he knows that he has filled the various positions, staff positions that he has."
1986.85-1208,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2273.794,2277.782,"--Such categories as what, supervisor versus non-supervisor, or--"
1986.85-1208,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,2277.782,2290.923,"Such as cutter versus finisher versus... not supervisor versus non-supervisor, but the categories of rank and file employees here, people who work on different machines, work on different parts of the process."
1986.85-1208,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2290.923,2298.279,"--You mean, if it wasn't just a separate... another shift of the same operation that was going to be added here but rather a whole separate operation?"
1986.85-1208,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,2298.279,2299.996,Yes.
1986.85-1208,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2300.496,2303.864,Then you wouldn't have had a substantial representative complement?
1986.85-1208,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,2303.864,2304.548,--You might not.
1986.85-1208,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2305.364,2305.9,Maybe?
1986.85-1208,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,2305.9,2306.916,--This is--
1986.85-1208,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2306.916,2312.637,"Yes or no, would that alone have been enough to make it clear that it was not a representative complement?"
1986.85-1208,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,2322.076,2323.525,--Converting.
1986.85-1208,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2323.525,2328.063,"Converting, whatever it is, would that have prevented it from being a representative complement?"
1986.85-1208,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,2336.7,2348.056,"This was an employer who, but mid-January, was engaged in one full shift of what he wanted to do, a finishing and dyeing operation."
1986.85-1208,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2398.489,2408.962,"Well, would you say that either in this case or in an initial representation case, if no one disputed that the employer was going to add a second shift?"
1986.85-1208,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,2421.787,2427.258,"--I think that might depend on how long it would take and how certain it was, which isn't--"
1986.85-1208,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2427.258,2427.491,All right.
1986.85-1208,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,2433.095,2464.966,"--I think that the Board, in weighing the right of employees to be represented during a critical point, in staffing up against whatever considerations favor waiting for the ultimate electorate to be formed, might well say employees have the right to be represented on the way up, even it it clear--"
1986.85-1208,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2464.966,2481.678,"If that is your position, the Board's position, I can't imagine that if it so turns out, when the second shift is completed, that these old employees are a distinct minority, can't imagine that the employer would be foreclosed from asking for an election."

1986.85-1208,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2483.428,2485.297,Just take my case.

1986.85-1208,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2509.078,2512.697,"No bar, no bar, no time bar on it."
1986.85-1208,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,2544.216,2548.62,"--Yes, if he bargained with the union...."
1986.85-1208,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2548.62,2549.003,Will he he get it?
1986.85-1208,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,2549.003,2556.726,"--at an earlier stage, and he will get it if he can present to the Board concrete evidence of a loss of support."
1986.85-1208,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2556.726,2560.928,"Well, you say loss of support."
1986.85-1208,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,2566.082,2608.992,"Our position is that there is a presumption, and that the presumption carries over to the new employer in a situation like this, but that where there is no recent election as there had been in Burns the employer may immediately rebut the presumption after... whenever it appears that there is no longer majority support in the bargaining unit for the union."
1986.85-1208,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2608.992,2611.658,"May I ask this question, a hypothetical before you carry on?"
1986.85-1208,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,2671.065,2672.798,I think--
1986.85-1208,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2672.798,2679.838,If all you had was continuity of employees that resulted from public advertising?
1986.85-1208,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,2679.838,2696.03,"--Well, I think that under the Burns case, that is essentially... that the Burns case covers that and that the Burns case tells us that there is sufficient continuity there."
1986.85-1208,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2698.382,2702.167,But is all you need continuity of employees without regard to any other facts?
1986.85-1208,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,2702.167,2719.046,"No, the Board has a seven-factor test and as to each of the seven factors which have been endorsed by this Court, there was either total or very substantial continuity here."
1986.85-1208,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2836.373,2850.598,"Mr. Cohen, I understand you are saying this case is not the same as Justice Powell's hypothetical, but how did you answer his hypothetical if the employees had come in, in response to newspaper ads but you got 60 percent of them, were former employees?"
1986.85-1208,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,2852.466,2878.117,"--I think that the result is not different if you end up with all the pieces together the way they are here, even if it is by accident, in part because the theory is not that the successor employer inherits obligations of its predecessor because of some relationship it has to the predecessor."
1986.85-1208,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2878.117,2883.771,"So, for this purpose we can just look at the numbers and we don't have to get into the details of how they happened to get hired?"
1986.85-1208,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,2883.771,2893.043,Or the Board could and the Court of Appeals could determine that the Board's finding of continuity here was supported by substantial evidence.
1986.85-1208,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2893.043,2902.982,Let me ask you one other question about the fact that in... I get the dates a little mixed up... in January they knew they were going to the full complement in April.
1986.85-1208,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,2923.896,2931.585,I think that it could well be a different case because it might not be a representative complement of employees.
1986.85-1208,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2939.857,2943.559,Just more of the same?
1986.85-1208,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,2943.559,2957.985,--Was more of the same and that the same bargaining unit definition stipulated that the same bargaining unit definition was appropriate for the successor employer here as for the predecessor--
1986.85-1208,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2957.985,2974.162,"Is that what ""representative"" means, representative of the various bargaining... see, ""representative"" means nothing to me unless I know what it's representative of, representative of the age that all the employees are going to be, or their races or of their skills, or what?"
1986.85-1208,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,2974.162,2976.864,"--I am sorry, I tried to answer before."
1986.85-1208,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2997.444,3006.466,Whether or not the jobs are all in the same classification as far as representational obligations are concerned?
1986.85-1208,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,3006.466,3010.335,"Well, I am not sure I understand your question."
1986.85-1208,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3015.006,3017.958,"Okay, So, it doesn't hinge on, representative of the various--"
1986.85-1208,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,3017.958,3030.099,"This case would be quite different if there were any question whatever about the appropriateness of the definition of the bargaining unit, but there isn't."
1986.85-1208,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3319.619,3328.825,"--Mr. Cohen, why shouldn't we give some weight to the dictum in Burns where we did stress the fact that there had been an election within the prior year?"
1986.85-1208,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,3356.678,3359.63,"No, if I may, we are not assuming that."
1986.85-1208,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3359.63,3359.963,--Why not?
1986.85-1208,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,3359.963,3383.978,"Because the rule of law here is that there is a presumption of continuity until there is a contrary showing, and the dissent in Burns was obviously correct, that you couldn't tell from the arithmetic in Burns whether any of the employees had in fact voted in favor of the union."
1986.85-1208,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3402.773,3405.475,That is different than an assumption?
1986.85-1208,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,3405.475,3409.379,--Yes.
1986.85-1208,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3412.415,3414.398,"Thank you, Mr. Cohen."

1986.85-1208,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3486.879,3495.901,"No, it began... a fair description, they said it became legal when it reached a representative complement, Now, you didn't know that until a year and a half later."
1986.85-1208,3,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,3495.901,3496.368,That's correct.
1986.85-1208,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3506.674,3511.41,But it became a legal demand when it became a legal demand whether or not you knew it at the time.
1986.85-1208,3,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,3511.41,3516.029,"--That's correct, but how are we supposed to comply with the law under those circumstances, and how--"

1986.85-1208,3,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,3549.348,3566.543,"Not because under Linden Lumber, under those circumstances if the employer refuses to recognize the union... excuse me, if the employer refuses to recognize the union, the employer has no obligation to go to the National Labor Relations Board to file a representation petition."
