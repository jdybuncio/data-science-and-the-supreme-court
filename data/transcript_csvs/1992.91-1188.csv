1992.91-1188,0,29785,james_ching,,11.689,14.424,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1992.91-1188,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,64.572,72.679,"Well, Mr. Ching, weren't corporations considered to be citizens at least for purposes of Federal court jurisdiction?"
1992.91-1188,0,29785,james_ching,,72.679,80.016,The... corporations were considered citizens for the purpose of diversity jurisdiction.
1992.91-1188,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,115.189,118.041,"Well, it would have been rejected in the Second Circuit."
1992.91-1188,0,29785,james_ching,,118.041,121.66,It would have been rejected certainly in the Second Circuit with no--
1992.91-1188,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,121.66,125.695,"How do we know whether it would have been rejected in the Ninth Circuit, for example?"
1992.91-1188,0,29785,james_ching,,125.695,139.637,"--Well, I would guess that the period of time between 1938 and 1959, in which no single case arose, indicated that there was some unanimity on the point."
1992.91-1188,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,212.749,214.018,That's the language of what?
1992.91-1188,0,29785,james_ching,,214.018,218.803,"That is the language of the report, the Senate report, in the statutory history."
1992.91-1188,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,218.803,219.839,What about the House report?
1992.91-1188,0,29785,james_ching,,221.339,225.659,I do not... I only had the Congressional News report.
1992.91-1188,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,263.248,267.116,What did you call the principle that Congress only intended to--
1992.91-1188,0,29785,james_ching,,267.116,271.668,--To parsimoniously extend the benefits of in forma pauperis.
1992.91-1188,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,271.668,275.639,--That's a principle or that's just an observation I suppose.
1992.91-1188,0,29785,james_ching,,275.639,276.872,I guess it's an observation.
1992.91-1188,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,280.841,287.613,"Well, has the Congress rejected from time to time suggestions to expand the in forma pauperis statute?"
1992.91-1188,0,29785,james_ching,,287.613,289.329,"I do not know, Your Honor."
1992.91-1188,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,289.329,292.767,"Well, then I don't think you have any evidence for your supposition."
1992.91-1188,0,29785,james_ching,,292.767,293.6,All right.
1992.91-1188,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,354.322,358.46,"Well, it says unless the context otherwise requires, doesn't it, in--"
1992.91-1188,0,29785,james_ching,,358.46,360.593,Unless the context otherwise--
1992.91-1188,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,360.593,363.093,--Or unless the context indicates otherwise.
1992.91-1188,0,29785,james_ching,,363.093,366.295,--Indicates.
1992.91-1188,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,379.436,382.388,"So, you say context means more than the words of the statute itself."
1992.91-1188,0,29785,james_ching,,387.541,387.924,--Certainly.
1992.91-1188,1,20269,charles_d_weisselberg,,1099.796,1100.962,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1992.91-1188,2,29785,james_ching,,2672.042,2673.078,"Yes, Your Honor."
1992.91-1188,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2696.091,2696.959,"No, it doesn't at all."
1992.91-1188,2,29785,james_ching,,2700.228,2700.695,Certainly--
1992.91-1188,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2700.695,2703.013,The section says he may request an attorney--
1992.91-1188,2,29785,james_ching,,2703.013,2703.713,--Exactly right.
1992.91-1188,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2703.713,2706.715,"--to represent any such person, but the lawyer can say no."
1992.91-1188,2,29785,james_ching,,2706.715,2714.155,"And my point is that corporations never appear except through counsel, and a fortiori, neither can associations."
