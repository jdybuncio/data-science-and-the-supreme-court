1989.88-1503,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,11.472,"We'll hear argument first this today in No. 88-1503, Nancy Beth Cruzan v. the Director of the Missouri Department of Health."
1989.88-1503,0,44257,william_h_colby,,12.824,17.293,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.88-1503,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,89.122,100.363,"Mr. Colby, is it clear... I'm... I'm not sure it... it seems to me that there may be some dispute on the point as to whether she could have been fed manually if that had not been done."
1989.88-1503,0,44257,william_h_colby,,116.772,118.824,I think that is... is not correct.
1989.88-1503,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,160.568,178.863,"Mr. Colby, at the time the family said, yes, go ahead and insert the feeding tube, if they had refused that permission, would the state law have required that refusal to be honored?"
1989.88-1503,0,44257,william_h_colby,,184.717,189.17,The family's consent was required for the surgery to insert the tube.
1989.88-1503,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,189.17,190.02,By state law?
1989.88-1503,0,44257,william_h_colby,,190.02,191.372,By state law.
1989.88-1503,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,191.889,194.974,Is that by statute or by some state common law?
1989.88-1503,0,44257,william_h_colby,,194.974,195.957,--By common law.
1989.88-1503,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,218.357,220.007,"Well, what if they refused?"
1989.88-1503,0,44257,william_h_colby,,234.966,250.394,"It is my belief that had they refused... refused, the state would have accepted that refusal and that Nancy would have died not from malnutrition, but from the severe brain damage from her accident shortly before then."
1989.88-1503,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,251.761,253.68,Is that a prediction of fact or is that a statement of law?
1989.88-1503,0,44257,william_h_colby,,273.843,287.484,"--The state would not necessarily have to accept that determination, and certainly there are instances like the Jehovah's Witness cases where the state will intervene and take steps to... provide the medical treatment."
1989.88-1503,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,385.745,393.833,"Mr. Colby, do you think that a competent adult has an absolute constitutional right to refuse food and water?"
1989.88-1503,0,44257,william_h_colby,,393.833,411.295,I believe a competent adult has an extremely strong right to refuse the surgery necessary to provide a gastrostomy feeding tube when that person has lost the natural ability to swallow.
1989.88-1503,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,411.295,414.664,How about if no feeding tube is required?
1989.88-1503,0,44257,william_h_colby,,414.664,416.449,And what would the mechanism be?
1989.88-1503,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,416.449,427.924,"Can the... can the adult, the competent adult absolutely refuse food and water in a hospital setting, and the state can't override that decision?"
1989.88-1503,0,44257,william_h_colby,,427.924,439.229,"There could be situations where that decision may be considered irrational or abusive, and the state could override that... that decision, I believe."
1989.88-1503,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,441.064,444.716,The individual isn't very competent then.
1989.88-1503,0,44257,william_h_colby,,444.716,446.385,--That may well be right.
1989.88-1503,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,464.547,466.732,Why do you presume it's irrational?
1989.88-1503,0,44257,william_h_colby,,483.324,484.343,It would be difficult--
1989.88-1503,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,484.343,486.16,Could a state overrule that?
1989.88-1503,0,44257,william_h_colby,,486.16,494.216,--It would be difficult for a person to be in a state close to the vegetative state and... and be competent.
1989.88-1503,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,494.216,507.207,"Well... well, then change it from a vegetative state, it's just a state of enormous pain, deformity, quality of life is... is... is nil, and the person says, I want to die."
1989.88-1503,0,44257,william_h_colby,,507.207,511.343,Could that patient refuse surgery to insert a gastrostomy tube?
1989.88-1503,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,511.96,514.029,"No, I'm asking Justice O'Connor's question."
1989.88-1503,0,44257,william_h_colby,,521.799,532.657,I believe they... they do have an obligation and that the Fourteenth Amendment protects that person's right to be free from a state intrusion.
1989.88-1503,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,542.447,543.049,"Now, can that--"
1989.88-1503,0,44257,william_h_colby,,552.237,561.676,"There no doubt is a continuum, and all kinds of decisions will be made along that continuum."
1989.88-1503,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,573.234,576.186,"Well, who... what does inappropriate mean?"
1989.88-1503,0,44257,william_h_colby,,576.186,581.255,"If, for example... and take the example of the Jehovah's Witness case."
1989.88-1503,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,626.116,639.559,"Suppose the evidence were to the contrary, and the evidence was that for reasons of her own moral philosophy she thought that life systems should never be terminated."
1989.88-1503,0,44257,william_h_colby,,640.909,642.395,Yes.
1989.88-1503,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,642.395,667.626,"Well, in this case, then, if the state has to respect both wishes, cannot we view this case as being one in which the state simply is saying that there must be a mechanism where the state can make a clear determination of what the wishes were one way or the other, and if that determination cannot be made, the state simply opts for life."
1989.88-1503,0,44257,william_h_colby,,672.078,702.463,"Certainly, the state has an important interest in protecting life, and they have an interest in making certain that appropriate decisions are made about medical treatment, but to simply say that in all situations we are going to err on the side of life, to say that we have an unqualified interest in life that is going to, in essence, win in every case--"
1989.88-1503,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,702.463,704.215,"No, it's not... it's not all situations."
1989.88-1503,0,44257,william_h_colby,,713.671,733.565,"--And if the wishes of the person cannot be determined with accuracy, then all that does is get you to the second question, which is, if we don't know for certain what this person's wishes are, how are we going to decide about medical treatment?"
1989.88-1503,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,740.402,744.204,Don't we... don't we have to get to that question here?
1989.88-1503,0,44257,william_h_colby,,764.084,785.781,"Certainly, in the past, this Court has, in a situation where an intermediate appellate court has carved out parts of the trial record and look at only specific facts, and in doing so denied an important liberty interest, this Court has looked at the whole record and I think you can do that here, and we submit that there is clear evidence of her wishes."
1989.88-1503,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,824.989,831.662,"But if you lose on that, then you must get to the question of the... of the authority of the parents."
1989.88-1503,0,44257,william_h_colby,,831.662,838.248,"If we lose on that, then we get to the question of, if the evidence is unclear, then who decides?"
1989.88-1503,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,865.899,868.435,"Excuse me, but you said before that we don't."
1989.88-1503,0,44257,william_h_colby,,920.735,935.479,"--Because if the state does that, and it says we are going to intrude in every unconscious person's life if we don't have express information as to their wishes, then they're going to deny important rights to incompetent people."
1989.88-1503,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,962.979,987.595,"Well, Mr. Colby, in that situation, a person acknowledged to be in a persistent vegetative state, do you think that there is some kind of per se rule, or presumption that federal... the federal Constitution mandates be applied, that that person would prefer to die?"
1989.88-1503,0,44257,william_h_colby,,997.136,1012.645,"There certainly is a presumption, Your Honor, that before the state can intrude and order that person to receive medical treatment at the order of the state for the rest of their life, that the state has to show some specific reason for doing that."
1989.88-1503,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1016.881,1030.424,"Well, do you think the patient has an interest in making sure that the patient's fundamental wishes are followed, at least?"
1989.88-1503,0,44257,william_h_colby,,1030.424,1031.906,"--Yes, absolutely."
1989.88-1503,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1031.906,1039.128,So the patient has an interest in making sure there is not some erroneous determination made--
1989.88-1503,0,44257,william_h_colby,,1039.128,1039.997,Agreed.
1989.88-1503,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1039.997,1040.896,--about the patient.
1989.88-1503,0,44257,william_h_colby,,1040.896,1041.914,Yes.
1989.88-1503,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1041.914,1052.387,"Do you think the federal Constitution, then, says that the state can't require clear and convincing evidence, for example?"
1989.88-1503,0,44257,william_h_colby,,1052.387,1064.009,"As applied in this case, I would submit that... the State of Missouri, the opinion of the Court below, says ""clear and convincing evidence"" at only one place, and at that place they say,"
1989.88-1503,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1076.686,1077.269,"Well, wait a minute."
1989.88-1503,0,44257,william_h_colby,,1091.695,1102.151,"For a patient like Nancy Cruzan, I would submit that her liberty interest is as important as her right to life in this setting."
1989.88-1503,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1135.974,1139.592,"Well, of course, it seems to me you assume the conclusion."
1989.88-1503,0,44257,william_h_colby,,1169.611,1189.109,"--Justice Kennedy, I believe, based on the decisions of this Court, that there certainly is a liberty interest of people, conscious and unconscious, to be free from invasions of the body that the state has ordered."
1989.88-1503,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1219.728,1221.078,But that assumes--
1989.88-1503,0,44257,william_h_colby,,1221.078,1223.18,--and certainly my interest in life doesn't win out over the liberty interest.
1989.88-1503,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1223.18,1225.632,--That assumes what we're trying to find.
1989.88-1503,0,44257,william_h_colby,,1232.719,1256.834,"Even if we assume that the state sets a burden of proof and that Nancy Cruzan, the evidence below did not meet this burden of proof, all that does is get us to the second question as to who... who decides her medical treatment and who is the appropriate decision-maker."
1989.88-1503,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1256.834,1273.177,"Well, do you think the Constitution requires a state to allow the nearest relative to make the decision, or can the state require a judicial proceeding to make that determination?"
1989.88-1503,0,44257,william_h_colby,,1273.177,1273.944,The state--
1989.88-1503,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1273.944,1287.002,"Some kind of independent decision-making body, such as we might require to determine whether someone must be committed to a mental institution or that sort of--"
1989.88-1503,0,44257,william_h_colby,,1287.002,1293.589,--The state could certainly set up procedures to ensure that the decision is carefully made.
1989.88-1503,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1329.279,1342.504,"--Is it enough if the family members are allowed to testify and state, as an evidentiary matter, their understanding of their daughter's wishes?"
1989.88-1503,0,44257,william_h_colby,,1342.504,1343.004,--Yes.
1989.88-1503,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1351.294,1360.8,Does... does... does the family have any interest over and above being kind of a repository for what the wishes of the patient are?
1989.88-1503,0,44257,william_h_colby,,1373.441,1387.817,"We have not argued this case from the start as a matter of her parents' rights, but certainly families have an interest in making certain that their family members are treated appropriately."
1989.88-1503,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1387.817,1391.419,So what's your answer?
1989.88-1503,0,44257,william_h_colby,,1391.419,1394.387,Yes.
1989.88-1503,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1394.387,1401.81,The family does have an interest over and above what it can say about what the patient's wishes were?
1989.88-1503,0,44257,william_h_colby,,1401.81,1402.343,I think so.
1989.88-1503,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1413.582,1418.467,You don't represent... and it doesn't make any difference that the person is an adult and not a minor... the patient?
1989.88-1503,0,44257,william_h_colby,,1418.467,1439.897,"Well, the value of family decision-making is certainly not lost simply because Nancy Cruzan was 25 when this accident happened rather than 17, and by becoming unconscious, she becomes much like the child... the adult child in the Youngberg case."
1989.88-1503,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1460.044,1470.019,"Mr. Colby, I don't know any other area where we allow the family to make a physical decision for a family member, a child... minor child."
1989.88-1503,0,44257,william_h_colby,,1510.294,1513.596,"If... absolutely, and as--"
1989.88-1503,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1513.596,1522.802,So the state can require the hospital... the state can require a hospital to cease providing this kind of medical care?
1989.88-1503,0,44257,william_h_colby,,1524.352,1524.868,--No.
1989.88-1503,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1542.346,1545.281,"It's not a matter of being abusive, any more than the Jehovah's Witness parents are being abusive."
1989.88-1503,0,44257,william_h_colby,,1551.369,1560.64,"And we submit that where a person who is permanently unconscious, where her wishes are clear, where the family's belief in her best interest is clear--"
1989.88-1503,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1560.64,1562.759,"Well, beyond whether her wishes are clear... that's a different question."
1989.88-1503,0,44257,william_h_colby,,1575.05,1585.256,"--But for the state to intrude in a person's life, they have to articulate the specific reason, and they absolutely have not done that in this case."
1989.88-1503,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1585.256,1588.042,You mean articulate reasons that are specific to this patient?
1989.88-1503,0,44257,william_h_colby,,1588.042,1588.81,"Yes, absolutely."
1989.88-1503,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1588.81,1599.615,"But what I... what I still don't quite understand from your argument, is it your view that if the actual wishes of the patient are unknowable... in many cases, I suppose, you just wouldn't know."
1989.88-1503,0,44257,william_h_colby,,1608.971,1609.556,No.
1989.88-1503,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1610.406,1615.125,Because your argument seems to focus entirely on trying to ascertain the intent of the patient.
1989.88-1503,0,44257,william_h_colby,,1615.125,1620.945,--And I tried to answer the Chief Justice's question in that regard and maybe did not do so clearly.
1989.88-1503,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1646.412,1651.566,"Mr. Colby, let me follow through a little bit on the Chief's... the Chief Justice's inquiry."
1989.88-1503,0,44257,william_h_colby,,1656.435,1657.937,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1989.88-1503,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1657.937,1671.547,"Let's change that and make it that the expense was that of the family and that Mr. Cruzan had seven other children and limited resources, would your argument be any different?"
1989.88-1503,0,44257,william_h_colby,,1678.383,1692.31,"It would certainly be important, in that context, for the finder of fact to determine what the motives of the family were and what was in the best interest of that individual, and perhaps to weigh the welfare of the other children, too."
1989.88-1503,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1701.816,1706.718,"We seem to have overlooked, here, too, what the findings of the trial court were."
1989.88-1503,0,44257,william_h_colby,,1714.041,1715.891,I agree.
1989.88-1503,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1715.891,1716.993,"Thank you, Mr. Colby."
1989.88-1503,1,40136,robert_l_presson,,1722.645,1726.865,"Mr. Chief, Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.88-1503,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1772.894,1774.679,Or his the family?
1989.88-1503,1,40136,robert_l_presson,,1774.679,1775.079,Pardon?
1989.88-1503,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1775.079,1777.48,Patient or the family?
1989.88-1503,1,40136,robert_l_presson,,1777.48,1779.48,"The patient or the family what, Your Honor, to make the decision?"
1989.88-1503,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1779.48,1784.051,"In the best interest of... you... you said it would be in the best interest of the patient, and I'm asking--"
1989.88-1503,1,40136,robert_l_presson,,1784.051,1784.517,Oh.
1989.88-1503,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1784.517,1786.569,--do you include the family also?
1989.88-1503,1,40136,robert_l_presson,,1786.569,1787.469,"No, I do not, Your Honor."
1989.88-1503,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1787.469,1795.109,"The answer is no, even though the expense were on the family, which it is not in this case, and even though there were other siblings?"
1989.88-1503,1,40136,robert_l_presson,,1795.109,1798.811,"I believe under Missouri law, the expense would not be on the family; it would not be on the guardians."
1989.88-1503,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1799.177,1801.329,"But what if it were, is my question?"
1989.88-1503,1,40136,robert_l_presson,,1801.329,1804.031,"--If it were we would have a different case, and that might present some problems."
1989.88-1503,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1804.031,1806.065,"Well, you're evading the answer, aren't you?"
1989.88-1503,1,40136,robert_l_presson,,1806.065,1812.385,"But, under Missouri law, as I understand it, the guardians are not responsible to use their own assets to care for the ward."
1989.88-1503,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1829.913,1834.465,"Well, and if they were required so under Missouri law, though, that is Justice Blackmun's question."
1989.88-1503,1,40136,robert_l_presson,,1840.702,1844.923,"Well, the question would be whether they could be compelled as guardians with that obligation out there, Your Honor."
1989.88-1503,2,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2888.54,2896.077,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.88-1503,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2950.38,2953.332,"May I ask, on that, why do they disagree?"
1989.88-1503,2,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2957.567,2958.084,--No.
1989.88-1503,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2981.0,2984.952,So they would clearly disagree with any decision to terminate life?
1989.88-1503,2,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2984.952,2985.803,--I think not.
1989.88-1503,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2986.703,2989.088,"It would be inconsistent with their mission, wouldn't it?"
1989.88-1503,2,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2989.088,2990.405,--With respect to the method?
1989.88-1503,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3285.898,3295.67,"Mr. General, in New York, if the evidence is clear and convincing with respect to food and hydration, the choice would be honored?"
1989.88-1503,2,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3295.67,3296.722,That's correct.
1989.88-1503,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3296.722,3302.243,The state could not say this is tantamount to suicide and we may override that choice?
1989.88-1503,2,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3302.243,3307.564,"That is correct, as a matter of common law right, and that is my reading of the Missouri Supreme Court's opinion."
1989.88-1503,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3307.564,3318.785,"Yes, but suppose the state did say that we just put food and hydration in a different category and we never will do it no matter what the evidence is."
1989.88-1503,2,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3321.054,3328.727,"I think there are significant limitations that the state could properly, constitutionally place on any such decision."
1989.88-1503,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3328.727,3329.827,And that's one of them?
1989.88-1503,2,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3329.827,3330.477,I beg your pardon?
1989.88-1503,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3330.477,3333.245,And so the state could not do that under the due process clause?
1989.88-1503,2,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3333.245,3333.745,"Oh, I'm sorry."
1989.88-1503,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3341.451,3342.318,"Well, I know but suppose--"
1989.88-1503,2,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3342.318,3343.503,But could there be an absolute rule?
1989.88-1503,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3343.503,3355.727,"--Suppose the state says, we're never going to honor a choice by the patient or by the parents or anybody else where food and hydration is concerned?"
1989.88-1503,2,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3357.746,3361.631,"It would raise very difficult questions, and I'm not prepared--"
1989.88-1503,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3370.387,3371.337,"Well, but is there--"
1989.88-1503,2,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3371.337,3374.605,--by the question because of the common law right recognized in Missouri.
1989.88-1503,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3374.605,3386.663,"--But Mr. Solicitor General, I would be interested, could there be a case in which the federal Constitution would require relief for the patient, in your view, or is it absolutely up to the states, 100 percent?"
1989.88-1503,2,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3387.579,3395.518,"Oh, I think if in fact the state was conducting itself in what reasonable judges viewed as an oppressive way--"
1989.88-1503,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3395.518,3395.868,Well--
1989.88-1503,2,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3395.868,3399.07,"--then yes, the federal Constitution would speak to that."
1989.88-1503,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3399.07,3404.288,"--Let's give a specific example, supposing there were evidence in this case that the patient was suffering continuous pain."
1989.88-1503,2,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3421.067,3421.65,"Oh, I think not."
1989.88-1503,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3425.635,3426.335,--How about modest pain?
1989.88-1503,2,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3430.256,3430.939,"Oh, I'm sorry."
1989.88-1503,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3445.015,3449.4,"So you would agree, though, that the federal Constitution is implicated by the... by this kind of issue?"
1989.88-1503,2,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3449.4,3453.804,"If there is a condition of suffering, and the state--"
1989.88-1503,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3453.804,3454.188,All right.
1989.88-1503,2,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3454.188,3455.188,--is requiring the individual--
1989.88-1503,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3455.188,3464.427,"Absent suffering, you just don't know, notwithstanding clear intent and everything else, just like the fact, clear evidence of intent, you're just not sure what the answer is there?"
1989.88-1503,2,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3464.427,3466.279,--I beg your pardon?
1989.88-1503,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3466.279,3468.895,I'm just... I'm... I perhaps am just repeating a question.
1989.88-1503,2,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3481.471,3484.906,"Oh, yes, I think the... the Constitution is implicated."
1989.88-1503,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3498.414,3500.183,"Thank you, General Starr."
1989.88-1503,3,44257,william_h_colby,,3504.654,3523.381,"If Judge Starr is correct, I have read the opinion below too broadly and all it stands for is the proposition that this state hospital cannot be forced to remove a tube that they didn't insert."
1989.88-1503,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3550.199,3551.015,"Thank you, Mr. Colby."
