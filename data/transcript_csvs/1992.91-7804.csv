1992.91-7804,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.839,"We'll hear argument next in number 91-7804, Sheldon Bufferd v. the Commissioner of Internal Revenue."
1992.91-7804,0,41297,stuart_jay_filler,,23.615,26.767,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1992.91-7804,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,265.068,267.538,"Mr. Filler, can I ask you a question?"
1992.91-7804,0,41297,stuart_jay_filler,,292.023,292.593,Okay.
1992.91-7804,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,292.593,297.518,"Now, what if it's more than 3 years ago that the subchapter C corporation did that?"
1992.91-7804,0,41297,stuart_jay_filler,,297.518,314.568,"I think the Government would not dispute, frankly, Your Honor, that if this were a C corporation and an adjustment of the C corporation were necessary in order to adjust a shareholder's return... and I provided such an example in my brief with respect to a dividend, okay?"
1992.91-7804,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,330.928,331.669,"Well, you cited--"
1992.91-7804,0,41297,stuart_jay_filler,,332.831,333.672,Why is that?
1992.91-7804,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,349.902,352.873,"Okay, now, but you're trying to answer my question, I take it."
1992.91-7804,0,41297,stuart_jay_filler,,352.873,353.745,"--Yes, I am."
1992.91-7804,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,353.745,354.766,Why don't you continue--
1992.91-7804,0,41297,stuart_jay_filler,,354.766,366.854,And section 6501(a) of the code provides that a 3-year period of limitations from that return... from the filing of that return is applicable to the C corporation's return.
1992.91-7804,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,366.854,379.63,"--Well, but why should the running of the statute of limitations on the C corporation's return prevent an adjustment in the taxpayer's return when the taxpayer... when an extension was obtained with respect to him?"
1992.91-7804,0,41297,stuart_jay_filler,,385.026,388.987,Congress created two separate and distinct entities.
1992.91-7804,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,429.954,436.388,"You've made that statement, but I simply don't... I must say I don't follow your reasoning."
1992.91-7804,0,41297,stuart_jay_filler,,458.484,462.474,"I'm sorry I haven't made it clear, Your Honor, but let me try one more time, Mr. Chief Justice."
1992.91-7804,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,462.474,463.596,"Well, maybe you've made it as clear as it can be."
1992.91-7804,0,41297,stuart_jay_filler,,463.596,471.02,Section 6012(a)(2) of the code requires a corporation subject to taxation to file a return.
1992.91-7804,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,471.02,471.651,I know that.
1992.91-7804,0,41297,stuart_jay_filler,,471.651,472.212,Okay.
1992.91-7804,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,499.99,503.543,6501(a)(2) says... 610--
1992.91-7804,0,41297,stuart_jay_filler,,503.543,504.625,--6501(a).
1992.91-7804,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,504.625,507.216,--6501 says all of what you have just said?
1992.91-7804,0,41297,stuart_jay_filler,,507.216,509.897,"I believe it does, sir, and I believe it says it clearly."
1992.91-7804,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,509.897,514.732,I had the same problem as the Chief Justice did.
1992.91-7804,0,41297,stuart_jay_filler,,519.878,521.078,The petitioner's brief on page 12?
1992.91-7804,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,521.078,521.578,--Yes.
1992.91-7804,0,41297,stuart_jay_filler,,521.578,522.429,With the C corporation.
1992.91-7804,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,522.429,528.854,"Yes, but you cite absolutely no authority, no text, no statute, no regulations, no case."
1992.91-7804,0,41297,stuart_jay_filler,,563.396,566.668,"I think I know the answer, Your Honor."
1992.91-7804,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,587.081,591.593,But that indicates that that's the very question before us to be decided.
1992.91-7804,0,41297,stuart_jay_filler,,597.828,644.049,"--Well, I think, Your Honor, that there is authority in the terms of corporate tax textbooks and other materials which are in use as acceptor of other authorities that have always I think interpreted the C corporation's period of limitations under 6501(a) to be the filing of the return, the date of the filing of the return under 6501(a), and that in order to adjust the C corporation's return with respect to tax imposed either on the C corporation... it's a separate taxable entity... or the shareholder, it must be done within the period of limitations of the C corporation--"
1992.91-7804,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,644.049,645.51,Mr. Filler--
1992.91-7804,0,41297,stuart_jay_filler,,645.51,646.631,--which is 3 years from date of filing.
1992.91-7804,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,647.062,651.593,--6501(a) to me does not say what you said it said.
1992.91-7804,0,41297,stuart_jay_filler,,666.413,673.057,"Well, it says except as otherwise provided in this section."
1992.91-7804,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,680.772,683.194,"Okay, now, stop there."
1992.91-7804,0,41297,stuart_jay_filler,,683.194,683.684,--Okay.
1992.91-7804,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,683.684,685.317,Is that the critical language?
1992.91-7804,0,41297,stuart_jay_filler,,686.977,690.9,The critical language is 3 years after the return was filed.
1992.91-7804,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,692.711,694.974,--Is that the critical language right there?
1992.91-7804,0,41297,stuart_jay_filler,,694.974,695.252,--Yes.
1992.91-7804,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,695.252,704.938,They are assessing this under an extension of the 3-year period on the individual.
1992.91-7804,0,41297,stuart_jay_filler,,704.938,711.113,"Yes, Your Honor, but they are two separate and distinct entities, and I don't think you can fail to recognize that."
1992.91-7804,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,715.864,731.545,"I know, but you are simply stating, so far as I know, without pointing to any statutory authority that the Government cannot reexamine anything that comes out of a C return on an individual's return if the time for examining the C return hasn't been extended."
1992.91-7804,0,41297,stuart_jay_filler,,743.383,759.635,"Well, I can only say, Your Honor, that in thorough research, that there is nothing from anyone or any source or any material written to believe that Congress was not clear."
1992.91-7804,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,813.208,819.833,We'll resume there at 1:00.
1992.91-7804,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,819.833,840.767,"Mr. Filler, you may continue."
1992.91-7804,0,41297,stuart_jay_filler,,840.767,843.719,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1992.91-7804,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,977.818,981.971,"It seems to me it's quite natural to read it in by implication, though."
1992.91-7804,0,41297,stuart_jay_filler,,981.971,991.656,"I think, Your Honor, that that ignores the fact that there are two separate and distinct taxable entities."
1992.91-7804,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1031.993,1034.575,Can you help me out on one thing?
1992.91-7804,0,41297,stuart_jay_filler,,1043.271,1045.471,I'm sorry now.
1992.91-7804,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1050.664,1051.646,That's what I thought.
1992.91-7804,0,41297,stuart_jay_filler,,1051.646,1052.828,That's what I said.
1992.91-7804,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1052.828,1059.551,"So, it's only the S corporation's return that is referred to in the second sentence, isn't it?"
1992.91-7804,0,41297,stuart_jay_filler,,1059.551,1060.923,That's correct.
1992.91-7804,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1088.501,1103.87,"Mr. Filler, you say that you don't want to add in that phrase in 6501(a), but it seems to me it's necessary to read in some phrase, because it says within 3 years after the return was filed."
1992.91-7804,0,41297,stuart_jay_filler,,1118.659,1127.725,"Nor does it say, as the Second Circuit held, Your Honor, that the relevant return is the return against whom the tax is imposed."
1992.91-7804,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1191.038,1191.679,"Well, but I--"
1992.91-7804,0,41297,stuart_jay_filler,,1191.679,1193.289,--and one when the tax was not assessed--
1992.91-7804,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1193.289,1194.16,--Can I interrupt you?
1992.91-7804,0,41297,stuart_jay_filler,,1209.53,1231.995,"--Well, then if... reading it that way, Your Honor, you've ignored the... or read out of the code, in effect, repealed effectively, I think the second sentence of section 6037 which says, any return filed pursuant to this section, which means every S corporation return, whether it's subject to tax or whether it's not subject--"
1992.91-7804,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1231.995,1234.756,That's any return filed pursuant to 6037.
1992.91-7804,0,41297,stuart_jay_filler,,1235.306,1243.201,"--Which, if you read the first sentence of... is the return required to be filed annually by every S corporation."
1992.91-7804,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1243.201,1244.042,All right.
1992.91-7804,0,41297,stuart_jay_filler,,1244.042,1244.413,Okay.
1992.91-7804,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1263.554,1264.315,Where do you get--
1992.91-7804,0,41297,stuart_jay_filler,,1264.315,1266.407,The return is treated as a corporate return.
1992.91-7804,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1266.407,1269.228,--Where do you get the cross reference to 6501(a)?
1992.91-7804,0,41297,stuart_jay_filler,,1269.228,1280.257,Because section 6501(a) provides the period of limitations for all returns required to be filed whether... and all returns that--
1992.91-7804,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1280.257,1281.887,Just let me go one step at a--
1992.91-7804,0,41297,stuart_jay_filler,,1281.887,1282.598,--are required to be filed are under section--
1992.91-7804,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1282.598,1284.679,--May I go one step at a time with you?
1992.91-7804,0,41297,stuart_jay_filler,,1284.679,1285.43,"--I apologize, Your Honor."
1992.91-7804,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1285.43,1289.204,Where do you get the reference to 6501(a) out of 6037?
1992.91-7804,0,41297,stuart_jay_filler,,1289.204,1314.889,"Because section 6037 says it shall be a corporate return... it shall be treated as a corporate return under section 6012, and when you go to section 6012, and you have a corporate return filed, the period of limitations for the filing of that return and all returns filed under 6012 is section 6501(a)."
1992.91-7804,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1326.016,1327.358,"You mean it's implicit, it's not explicit."
1992.91-7804,0,41297,stuart_jay_filler,,1327.358,1337.563,"--It has to be implicit, Your Honor, because there's no way to ever create a limitation period for that return even if it was capable of a tax being assessed."
1992.91-7804,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1340.334,1349.721,What purpose does the limitations period serve with respect to a return for which no tax is... pursuant to which no tax is paid?
1992.91-7804,0,41297,stuart_jay_filler,,1349.721,1375.577,"--The purpose of the period of limitations, as is true of all periods of limitations, is to create a deadline, a deadline upon which the two parties to, in this case, a tax transaction, but any period of limitations... in which each party must act in order to bring finality to the process, in this case the tax return or the taxable year in question in a case."
1992.91-7804,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1442.072,1451.179,"But that language, Mr. Filler, no one is trying to impose a tax on the subchapter corporation here."
1992.91-7804,0,41297,stuart_jay_filler,,1451.179,1459.303,"I understand that no one is trying to impose a tax, but they must make... let me see if I can state it this way."
1992.91-7804,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1469.341,1470.109,Why--
1992.91-7804,0,41297,stuart_jay_filler,,1470.109,1487.473,--that an error was made on the S corporation return and adjusting that and therefore reaching a different bottom line result for the operations of the S corporation as reported on its form may they then adjust the shareholder's return.
1992.91-7804,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1487.473,1489.764,"--Now, just stop a minute, Mr. Filler, and let me ask."
1992.91-7804,0,41297,stuart_jay_filler,,1513.211,1527.25,"Well, when Congress created, Your Honor, the second sentence of section 6037 in 1958, there was no income tax imposed on an S corporation, no tax at all."
1992.91-7804,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1565.786,1567.648,I have just one question.
1992.91-7804,0,41297,stuart_jay_filler,,1567.648,1568.69,"--Yes, sir, Justice Kennedy."
1992.91-7804,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1568.69,1572.391,Assume that X owes Y on a promissory note.
1992.91-7804,0,41297,stuart_jay_filler,,1572.391,1573.412,Okay.
1992.91-7804,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1573.412,1575.224,"And X pays $1,000."
1992.91-7804,0,41297,stuart_jay_filler,,1597.087,1599.441,"I'm sorry, Your Honor."
1992.91-7804,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1601.05,1601.471,No.
1992.91-7804,0,41297,stuart_jay_filler,,1601.471,1602.112,I'm sorry.
1992.91-7804,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1602.112,1603.103,Just two individuals.
1992.91-7804,0,41297,stuart_jay_filler,,1603.103,1603.712,"Oh, two individuals."
1992.91-7804,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1603.712,1604.623,Yes.
1992.91-7804,0,41297,stuart_jay_filler,,1604.623,1610.598,One... X loans Y money and Y pays... and X pays Y interest?
1992.91-7804,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1610.598,1613.89,"There's nothing that says they have to be treated consistently, is there?"
1992.91-7804,0,41297,stuart_jay_filler,,1613.89,1621.013,Is there anything that says that the debtor and the creditor in a case must be treated consistently?
1992.91-7804,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1621.013,1626.677,"Right, assuming one year... one person's year is closed so the IRS can't do anything about it."
1992.91-7804,0,41297,stuart_jay_filler,,1626.677,1647.751,"The... yes, I believe that that is correct, that should the payee, shall we say, of the interest not have reported it, but the payor deducted it, okay, and the period of limitations lapsed on the payee, the IRS could not come in and add that to the payee's income."
1992.91-7804,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1648.732,1649.133,Yes.
1992.91-7804,0,41297,stuart_jay_filler,,1649.133,1649.563,I'm sorry.
1992.91-7804,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1650.652,1662.361,"In other words, if there are two parties to a transaction, the tax year for one can close and the other remain open, and the IRS is not foreclosed from adjusting one... the open taxpayer's return, is it?"
1992.91-7804,0,41297,stuart_jay_filler,,1662.361,1675.22,"I know, but there's no interrelationship in the very real sense of a shareholder and owner of a corporation between two individuals who simply loan and borrow money, I don't think, Your Honor."
1992.91-7804,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1710.923,1722.65,"Professor Filler, if you should prevail here, I suppose all the Government will do in the future is to get an 872 out of the corporations."
1992.91-7804,0,41297,stuart_jay_filler,,1722.65,1724.631,"Yes, sir, and in fact, they've done it."
1992.91-7804,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1761.957,1765.588,"Well, so all you're winning here is a procedural thing except for the present case, of course."
1992.91-7804,0,41297,stuart_jay_filler,,1769.431,1790.315,"And I think it's clear, Your Honor, that that's what Congress intended the Government to do in 1958 when it created the second sentence of section 6037, and any other holding ignores that second sentence to the extent that I really and truly believe it repeals that second sentence of section 6037."
1992.91-7804,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1792.325,1794.068,"Very well, Mr. Filler."
1992.91-7804,0,41297,stuart_jay_filler,,1794.068,1795.188,--I appreciate the opportunity.
1992.91-7804,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1795.749,1797.542,Mr. Jones.
1992.91-7804,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,1797.542,1801.855,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1992.91-7804,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1912.707,1929.027,"In your hypothetical, if the corporation had been audited and its... excuse me... its return closed and its year closed and then the employee was assessed the extra $40,000, could the corporation on its... now, wait."
1992.91-7804,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,1931.069,1938.963,"Well, I understood your question to premise that the corporate return had... the period had closed for that year."
1992.91-7804,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1938.963,1939.354,Yes.
1992.91-7804,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,1939.354,1943.636,"And the answer to your question is that if that corporation's return period has closed, it cannot be reopened."
1992.91-7804,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1992.729,2004.337,"Mr. Jones, would you clarify for me what the rule would be with respect to a so-called subchapter C, or an ordinary corporation?"
1992.91-7804,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2004.337,2012.342,"The rule that we are describing is identical for subchapter C, subchapter S partnerships."
1992.91-7804,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2027.1,2035.676,"So, you disagree with the petitioner's reading of the statute and his description of what the rule would be for a different type of corporation."
1992.91-7804,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2035.676,2035.946,Yes.
1992.91-7804,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2045.063,2049.337,And do you have any authority for the answer that you've given to Justice O'Connor?
1992.91-7804,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2049.337,2068.067,"Well, the... this Court's opinion in the Munter case is the closest direct authority on that question, although we think that the proposition is answered by all of the cases that I've already cited, which hold that an error on some other return doesn't prevent an adjustment on the taxpayer's return."
1992.91-7804,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2121.232,2138.824,The Commissioner gets an extension of time from the corporation and makes an adjustment in the... and finds that there was... should have been more... that the return was in error in terms of how much dividends were paid out?
1992.91-7804,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2138.824,2139.555,"Yes, sir."
1992.91-7804,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2139.555,2146.29,You can't adjust the shareholder's return unless you've got an extension from him too.
1992.91-7804,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2146.29,2150.521,Those are utterly independent issues.
1992.91-7804,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2150.521,2150.761,Yes.
1992.91-7804,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2150.761,2154.735,You need an extension if you want... from the corporation if you want to adjust its return.
1992.91-7804,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2159.497,2161.62,No matter what you do to the corporation's return.
1992.91-7804,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2161.62,2163.4,That's correct.
1992.91-7804,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2372.647,2385.256,"Mr. Jones, what about the private taxpayer, the individual taxpayer, who is relying on the information return?"
1992.91-7804,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2408.251,2409.853,I believe that's correct.
1992.91-7804,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2409.853,2411.563,"Now, what if the mistake is in the other direction?"
1992.91-7804,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2419.277,2428.503,"In that situation, the shareholder, if he overreported his income, would be entitled to seek, if appropriate, a refund."
1992.91-7804,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2428.503,2429.734,Can he do that?
1992.91-7804,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2440.981,2441.282,Certainly.
1992.91-7804,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2449.748,2450.249,Okay.
1992.91-7804,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2450.249,2450.93,It's information.
1992.91-7804,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2450.93,2463.356,I assume from your position that if the shareholder knows or should have known of an error in the sub S return that you could assess a negligence penalty against him for filing it?
1992.91-7804,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2463.356,2465.837,Yes.
1992.91-7804,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2517.591,2521.474,"Mr. Jones, it would help me if you could lift your voice a little bit and--"
1992.91-7804,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2521.474,2521.765,--I'm sorry.
1992.91-7804,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2521.765,2524.126,--don't speak quite so softly.
1992.91-7804,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2524.126,2525.906,How far back should I go?
1992.91-7804,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2942.361,2944.282,"Thank you, Mr. Jones."
1992.91-7804,2,41297,stuart_jay_filler,,2947.094,2966.355,"I can only go back to the beginning, and that is that the second sentence of section 6037 provides any return filed by an S corporation shall be treated as a return of a corporation pursuant to section 6012."
1992.91-7804,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2998.316,3007.153,"No, but Mr. Filler, he makes the point that it might not have thought it was subject to tax, but it didn't qualify as S corporation status, and therefore you need to limit the period in which a tax might be assessed against it when it made that mistake."
1992.91-7804,2,41297,stuart_jay_filler,,3007.153,3018.611,The committee reports in the 1958 legislation specifically provide that the Congress knew that a subchapter S corporation was not subject to tax.
1992.91-7804,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3018.611,3021.612,"No, but the taxpayer might have made a mistake in thinking it was qualified."
1992.91-7804,2,41297,stuart_jay_filler,,3033.151,3051.373,"Yes, but in that case, the Congress could not have drafted the second sentence saying any return filed pursuant to this section or every return filed pursuant to this section because every return would have to include returns in which the corporation had properly elected to be an S corporation."
1992.91-7804,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3051.373,3053.176,"Thank you, Mr. Filler."
1992.91-7804,2,41297,stuart_jay_filler,,3053.176,3053.507,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1992.91-7804,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3053.507,3054.298,The case is submitted.
