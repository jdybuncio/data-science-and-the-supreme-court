2018.17-778,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.16,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 17-778, Quarles versus United States. Mr. Marwell."
2018.17-778,0,63132,jeremy_c_marwell,,7.16,16.52,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: For centuries, the essence of burglary has been punishing those who trespass for the purpose of committing a crime."
2018.17-778,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,72.28,98.6,"Well, something -- something in Taylor tugs the other way; that is, Taylor said that there would be few statutes that were broader than the generic, and even in, what, 1986, there were more than a few statutes that are like the statute before us."
2018.17-778,0,63132,jeremy_c_marwell,,98.6,111.24,"Yes, Justice Ginsburg. The government claims there were six statutes as of -- or six states as of 1986 that had defined remaining-in burglary more broadly than -- than our definition."
2018.17-778,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,119.56,120.04,I thought --
2018.17-778,0,63132,jeremy_c_marwell,,120.04,120.6,So --
2018.17-778,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,120.6,126.12,-- it was higher? I thought it was somewhere between nine and 14?
2018.17-778,0,63132,jeremy_c_marwell,,126.12,129.24,"Well, the -- the government claims six statutes."
2018.17-778,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,153.32,153.76,Well --
2018.17-778,0,63132,jeremy_c_marwell,,153.76,154.0,-- intent.
2018.17-778,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,154.0,183.44,"-- if we look at the statutes in existence in 1986, and we count only those in which there is a judicial opinion interpreting the statute on the remaining-in question, and not those which contain dicta in cases involving -- where the -- where there was an intent at the time of entry, what is the breakdown?"
2018.17-778,0,63132,jeremy_c_marwell,,183.44,186.08,"Well, as you know, we -- we think you should not only look --"
2018.17-778,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,186.08,186.28,I know.
2018.17-778,0,63132,jeremy_c_marwell,,186.28,186.44,-- at the remaining --
2018.17-778,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,186.44,187.96,You think we should look more broadly.
2018.17-778,0,63132,jeremy_c_marwell,,194.56,195.04,Correct --
2018.17-778,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,195.04,195.44,Okay.
2018.17-778,0,63132,jeremy_c_marwell,,195.44,200.64,"-- be -- because Taylor refers -- Taylor instructs to look at how a majority of states define burglary, and --"
2018.17-778,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,200.64,205.32,"Well, we know that Taylor -- that Taylor's definition of burglary includes ""remaining in,"" does it not?"
2018.17-778,0,63132,jeremy_c_marwell,,205.32,205.84,Correct.
2018.17-778,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,206.16,206.4,All right.
2018.17-778,0,63132,jeremy_c_marwell,,212.36,221.44,"Because the 22 jurisdictions that had just entry burglary show a widespread adherence to that traditional rule, that you needed intent at the time of entry."
2018.17-778,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,240.44,241.12,Right.
2018.17-778,0,63132,jeremy_c_marwell,,241.12,276.16,"There are states like Alaska, which has the Arabie decision from 1985; New York, which has the Licata decision from 1971; Connecticut, which has the Belton decision from 1983, where the court said that ""remaining in"" applies to a lawful entry followed by a subsequent formation of intent. And I take the point that may not be 100 percent on point with the question, but we think it forecloses the government's reading, again, because they -- that preserves the requirement of intent at initial unlawful entry. There are also some statutes, Justice Alito, where the plain language of the statute, we think, supports our view."
2018.17-778,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,288.84,324.08,"And I guess what strikes me, Mr. Marwell, is that the distinction just wasn't -- you know, it wasn't really present at that time, that -- that -- that now we can look and see how there really is a split on this question, but in 1986, there were so few cases or -- or statutes that clearly made the distinction and put a state on one side or the other of it. And if that's the case, if the distinction wasn't salient, why would we assume that Congress meant to incorporate it into the burglary element?"
2018.17-778,0,63132,jeremy_c_marwell,,324.08,333.12,"Well, I -- I think the Court typically interprets statutes to assume some degree of continuity with what had come before, and here Taylor acknowledged the common law rule."
2018.17-778,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,344.16,354.84,"What do you do with the ""surreptitiously"" definition that was in existence before 1986? How does that inform our analysis?"
2018.17-778,0,63132,jeremy_c_marwell,,354.84,362.92,"So the Court said in Taylor that it -- it was adopting a definition that was very close to the 1984 statute, which had the surreptitious."
2018.17-778,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,385.72,394.32,Justice Alito asked you what the lineup was of states that read it your way and the states that read it the government's way.
2018.17-778,0,63132,jeremy_c_marwell,,407.64,431.88,"The government has five where there were judicial decisions in Texas, which adopted a slightly different statutory language that made clear that it was covering anyone who was present in and then committed. I think -- in our blue brief we -- we cited 15 jurisdictions, 15 of the 29, but I think, again, if -- if we look at the entry states, that gets us 22 as of 1986."
2018.17-778,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,434.12,434.88,Well that's --
2018.17-778,0,63132,jeremy_c_marwell,,434.88,435.2,-- which is --
2018.17-778,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,435.2,441.32,"-- 15 is a -- is a third of -- not quite a third, a little less than a third, of the states."
2018.17-778,0,63132,jeremy_c_marwell,,453.04,464.04,"Well, we -- Taylor says you're trying to craft a generic burglary definition that aligns with how most states viewed it, viewed burglary, at the time."
2018.17-778,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,481.72,483.72,"So I'm sorry, what was the 15 you were talking about?"
2018.17-778,0,63132,jeremy_c_marwell,,483.72,487.4,"Fifteen are jurisdictions that read ""remaining"" in our way."
2018.17-778,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,487.4,489.84,"Oh, I'm sorry, I -- that's not the question I asked."
2018.17-778,0,63132,jeremy_c_marwell,,489.84,490.48,"Oh, I'm sorry."
2018.17-778,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,490.48,497.24,"As of 1986, how many jurisdictions read it the government's way?"
2018.17-778,0,63132,jeremy_c_marwell,,497.24,498.44,Six.
2018.17-778,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,498.44,499.68,Six.
2018.17-778,0,63132,jeremy_c_marwell,,499.68,505.56,"Five -- five using intermediate, mostly intermediate state court decisions, and one was Texas."
2018.17-778,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,505.56,510.08,What has -- how -- how large has that number grown since 1986?
2018.17-778,0,63132,jeremy_c_marwell,,510.08,513.2,So the government cites 18 jurisdictions today.
2018.17-778,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,541.32,551.72,"The -- the LaFave treatise at -- at the time said, ""far more common today is the burglary statute which covers one who either enters or remains in the premises."
2018.17-778,0,63132,jeremy_c_marwell,,563.76,564.24,So the --
2018.17-778,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,564.24,566.92,-- contemporaneous evaluation of the law?
2018.17-778,0,63132,jeremy_c_marwell,,566.92,574.92,"So I think that language could -- could support our rule or the government's rule, potentially, but if you look at the rest of what LaFave said, LaFave --"
2018.17-778,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,574.92,576.24,"Well, let's just stick with that --"
2018.17-778,0,63132,jeremy_c_marwell,,576.24,576.48,Okay.
2018.17-778,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,576.48,577.12,-- sentence.
2018.17-778,0,63132,jeremy_c_marwell,,584.44,590.24,"And -- and we think that ""remaining within"" refers to that point where somebody overstays their welcome."
2018.17-778,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,635.28,658.52,"Is there any reason to think that the person who stays in the bank, and then, ah, what a nice idea, I'll help myself to some money, is any the less violent or at risk of violence or risk of -- is there any less risk there than when he gets the idea of going into the bank two weeks earlier?"
2018.17-778,0,63132,jeremy_c_marwell,,658.52,658.92,Yes.
2018.17-778,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,712.04,712.24,There are --
2018.17-778,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,712.24,712.36,Part of --
2018.17-778,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,712.36,736.56,"-- no -- no people who think, well, I want to rob this bank, I'm a little worried about the noise if I break in, or I guess, I want to rob this bank, he thinks it when he's inside. A night watchman, a teller who forgot to go out -- I don't know if that exists, but I can't quite figure out -- I'm sure there is some cases both ways, I would think."
2018.17-778,0,63132,jeremy_c_marwell,,736.56,736.92,So --
2018.17-778,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,736.92,739.2,Anybody ever look at that and --
2018.17-778,0,63132,jeremy_c_marwell,,739.2,747.16,"Well, so Taylor, just -- just to -- Taylor referred to the risk of violence when somebody does an intrusion to commit a crime."
2018.17-778,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,749.8,750.52,Right.
2018.17-778,0,63132,jeremy_c_marwell,,750.52,752.72,-- of why we care about pre-formed intent.
2018.17-778,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,752.72,770.72,"But -- but part of our understanding of why burglary is a -- is a risky crime is when the burglar meets somebody else, the victim, the police officer, whoever. And that person is not going to know when the criminal formed his intent."
2018.17-778,0,63132,jeremy_c_marwell,,770.72,785.36,"That -- that's correct. But two -- two points, Justice Kagan: One, it's -- the government's position comes very close to saying that any time you are present somewhere where you're not supposed to be, there's that risk of a violent confrontation. And Congress did not use the word ""trespass"" in ACCA."
2018.17-778,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,808.56,849.44,"Is the offense we're concerned with here, his third degree home invasion conviction in Michigan, anything like these cases that you've just described? In that case, as I understand it, he assaulted his girlfriend and then -- and this is what the judge said as the factual basis for his no contest plea -- ""The victim reported that Mr. Quarles broke in through a screen window and assaulted her while in the house."" And the judge said, ""We certainly can infer that he had an intent to commit an assault while he was entering."" And this establishes that he did commit an assault while he was in the house."
2018.17-778,0,63132,jeremy_c_marwell,,849.44,856.84,"So the -- the facts that you've recited, Justice Alito, I think would not be available to a sentencing court."
2018.17-778,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,864.28,872.32,"Well, doesn't -- doesn't the judge, in order to accept a no contest plea, have to establish, be satisfied that there is a factual basis for the plea?"
2018.17-778,0,63132,jeremy_c_marwell,,872.32,881.4,"I think -- well, in Michigan law, no contest is -- is -- is acquiescing in the imposition of punishment but not confirming or denying the facts."
2018.17-778,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,882.36,894.92,So the judge doesn't have to be satisfied -- we'll check it out. Under Michigan law -- this is surprising to me -- a judge can accept a non -- a no contest plea without ascertaining that there is a factual basis for the plea?
2018.17-778,0,63132,jeremy_c_marwell,,894.92,924.04,"Even if so, I think under this Court -- the way this Court said in Shepard and Mathis, the kinds of facts that are available to the sentencing judge, those are limited to ones where the defendant confirmed the accuracy. But I think under, under the Court's categorical approach, what matters is the text of the Michigan statute, which is very broad. It's as broad as that Texas statute because it says any time you're present in and you -- and you commit. And if there's a concern about whether the question presented is presented, the government didn't raise that in its brief in opposition."
2018.17-778,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,928.6,934.08,Taylor didn't say that the statute had to exactly correspond to generic burglary.
2018.17-778,0,63132,jeremy_c_marwell,,936.2,954.2,"That -- that's right. But we think that the -- the -- the -- the element here of contemporaneous intent is what's been called the most fundamental essence of burglary. So I think substantial -- it's hard to say that it substantially corresponds if it's missing, you know, the core element."
2018.17-778,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,954.2,968.72,"When you gave the number six, did that exclude all the states with remaining-in statutes that had not interpreted those statutes?"
2018.17-778,0,63132,jeremy_c_marwell,,968.72,969.6,That's correct.
2018.17-778,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,997.84,1011.32,"Did that turn out to be the case, states that had remaining-in statutes in 1986 and then interpreted them later?"
2018.17-778,0,63132,jeremy_c_marwell,,1011.32,1015.48,"Well, some jurisdictions have gone towards the government's view."
2018.17-778,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1030.68,1032.24,Give me the count again?
2018.17-778,0,63132,jeremy_c_marwell,,1032.24,1034.84,So if the question is what's the headcount today?
2018.17-778,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1034.84,1035.32,Yes.
2018.17-778,0,63132,jeremy_c_marwell,,1035.32,1039.52,"Nineteen states retain the intent at entry, so entry only."
2018.17-778,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1057.92,1068.2,"The -- the 18 states that the government says have their rule, do they have other burglary statutes or would we be essentially removing the only burglary statutes of those states?"
2018.17-778,0,63132,jeremy_c_marwell,,1068.2,1078.68,"So it -- it -- focused on today's laws, that's going to depend on how the states have treated the statutes. We cited in our brief the Priddy case from the Sixth Circuit."
2018.17-778,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1098.52,1098.8,What --
2018.17-778,0,63132,jeremy_c_marwell,,1098.8,1100.44,-- analysis.
2018.17-778,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1100.44,1108.56,What percentage of burglaries do you think are remaining-in versus entry burglaries?
2018.17-778,0,63132,jeremy_c_marwell,,1108.56,1124.08,"So what we -- one thing we know at the time of ACCA was that the New York burglary statute was very influential. And the commentaries to that burglary statute, which we cited in our reply brief, say explicitly that entry was the common, more common variant."
2018.17-778,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1124.08,1125.48,"Far more common, right?"
2018.17-778,0,63132,jeremy_c_marwell,,1125.48,1126.08,Yeah.
2018.17-778,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1137.84,1150.2,"But it shows -- and this is an effect of Taylor, but the effects of adopting your position would be to knock out all burglaries from potentially 18 or more states as predicates?"
2018.17-778,0,63132,jeremy_c_marwell,,1150.2,1165.48,"So I don't -- so, again, I think the -- the relevant question is how many would have been knocked out at the time Congress enacted ACCA, since that, I think, is the fairest reading of Castleman and Stokeling. As of today, I think it depends on the divisibility analysis."
2018.17-778,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1175.04,1190.8,"Is -- is there any way to tell, maybe there's not, among remaining-in burglaries, what proportion of them are people who formed their intent later versus formed their intent at the moment of decision to remain?"
2018.17-778,0,63132,jeremy_c_marwell,,1190.8,1193.16,I'm not aware of a statistic on that front.
2018.17-778,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1232.52,1241.96,It has to be -- it has to be very unusual that someone enters a bank and only then does it occur to them that that's where money is that they might want to rob. (Laughter.)
2018.17-778,0,63132,jeremy_c_marwell,,1241.96,1276.16,"Well, I -- I think the reason that the states adopted these remaining-in variants is because you're right in the sense what they were trying to get at was the person who came to the bank with that plan and they were going to avoid having to break in because they could enter lawfully. And there was a sense that that person is a burglar, just like the one who actually breaks and enters. But I think that supports our view because those are captured under both -- both sides' tests because that -- that person has the intent at the time he -- his presence in the -- in the bank becomes unlawful."
2018.17-778,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1276.16,1304.68,"What do you make of Taylor's definition of -- of burglary, where the Court said that the contemporary meaning of burglary means at least the following, and -- I'm sorry, contains at least the following elements: An unlawful or unprivileged entry into, or remaining in a building or other structure with intent to commit a crime? How do you read -- how can you read that consistent with your interpretation?"
2018.17-778,0,63132,jeremy_c_marwell,,1304.68,1317.96,"I think the way the Eighth and Fifth Circuits and Seventh Circuits have which is that, you are, A, defining burglary, coming at it at against the background of a common law rule that everyone agrees, the government and us, had this contemporaneous intent requirement."
2018.17-778,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1332.0,1332.64,"Yes, it's remaining --"
2018.17-778,0,63132,jeremy_c_marwell,,1332.64,1333.0,-- of some --
2018.17-778,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1333.0,1335.44,-- remaining with intent to commit a crime.
2018.17-778,0,63132,jeremy_c_marwell,,1335.44,1336.8,Right.
2018.17-778,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1336.8,1339.36,So where do we get the -- the -- the point of entry there?
2018.17-778,0,63132,jeremy_c_marwell,,1339.36,1341.16,I -- I think you get it --
2018.17-778,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1341.16,1342.56,"I'm sorry, the time of entry."
2018.17-778,0,63132,jeremy_c_marwell,,1348.84,1351.68,"Because you're reading ""remaining"" in the context of entry."
2018.17-778,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1360.44,1361.08,What do you mean by --
2018.17-778,0,63132,jeremy_c_marwell,,1361.08,1361.36,So --
2018.17-778,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1361.36,1362.36,I'm sorry to interrupt.
2018.17-778,0,63132,jeremy_c_marwell,,1362.36,1363.16,I'm sorry.
2018.17-778,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1363.16,1368.2,"What do you mean by context there? It says ""or"" -- entry into ""or"" remaining in."
2018.17-778,0,63132,jeremy_c_marwell,,1368.2,1380.28,"Well, I -- the -- this Court in the Neal case that we cited in our reply brief has said when you have a pair of words, you know, disjunctive pair of words, you look at one in the context of the other. And --"
2018.17-778,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1380.28,1390.24,"But there are two distinct concepts, and at least I read Taylor as saying these two distinct concepts are ways you can fall within generic burglary."
2018.17-778,0,63132,jeremy_c_marwell,,1390.24,1395.92,But they're two distinct concepts engaged in the effort of defining what burglary was in most states at that time.
2018.17-778,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1406.96,1419.04,"Although there were some states, you acknowledge, that supported the government's position at that time and that are cited in LaFave, which is cited right after this sentence in Taylor, is the LaFave treatise."
2018.17-778,0,63132,jeremy_c_marwell,,1419.2,1419.52,Correct.
2018.17-778,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1466.76,1502.04,"I mean, what you say is a -- is an argument that one might make to a state legislature in defining burglary, because the other definition can potentially catch some of these people who have less -- less dangerous characteristics -- that where their -- that individual crime has less dangerous characteristics, but under ACCA, the person has to have three prior convictions. And here your client has two prior convictions for assault with a deadly weapon, so this is just the third."
2018.17-778,0,63132,jeremy_c_marwell,,1515.2,1521.12,"Well, I think under -- under the Court's categorical approach, the -- the -- the question is the statutes, not the -- not the conduct."
2018.17-778,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1535.76,1537.92,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Tripp."
2018.17-778,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,1537.92,1548.72,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Petitioner's conviction here is a burglary conviction for purposes of ACCA."
2018.17-778,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1628.8,1653.8,"Mr. Tripp, the -- the formulation that Taylor used, and I agree it tends to support your position, but, I mean, nobody could think that the person who was writing the Taylor opinion had this issue in mind at that point. So it's one of these things of how do we read our own opinions and do we read them like statutes or do we read them a little bit differently, understanding what was and what wasn't in the mind of the Court at that time?"
2018.17-778,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,1653.8,1654.32,Right.
2018.17-778,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1691.36,1729.24,"But then what do we do with the common law that has informed us? And I do understand that in -- in Taylor we were very clear that the -- burglary had evolved from the common law in -- in dramatic ways, including the fact that most of the time burglary was limited to dwellings, and in more recent generations, it has expanded to a break-in to any structure that people own. But, still, your definition, your reading would be Congress intended to sweep in every statute that called itself burglary?"
2018.17-778,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,1729.24,1729.68,It -- it --
2018.17-778,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1729.68,1731.92,Basically that's you're -- you're -- what you're saying.
2018.17-778,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,1755.84,1758.36,So I -- I -- I think there is a lot packed in there.
2018.17-778,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1765.08,1770.0,"So why isn't the typical the majority, the ones where ""entering in""?"
2018.17-778,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,1770.0,1776.68,"So the typical, even in 1986, most states had remaining-in burglary. The 29 states had it."
2018.17-778,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1777.64,1777.76,Well --
2018.17-778,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,1777.76,1780.24,"Most of them, 27 of them, it was almost verbatim --"
2018.17-778,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1780.24,1806.92,"If -- if I might on that, just to interrupt, I'm sorry, but just -- just to get the playing field right, we have the 29, but then we have, I believe, about six where we have subsequent judicial decisions indicating that it required intent upon entry, some of which were later overturned by legislatures or whatever. And you're asking us to not pay attention to those six and use 29 rather than, I think it's 23, something like that."
2018.17-778,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,1846.96,1847.08,So --
2018.17-778,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1847.08,1847.84,-- whether that's the case.
2018.17-778,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,1847.84,1857.4,"-- I think the answers sort of all get to the same place, and -- and -- and that I think really our position is no matter how you look at this and how far you dig, you're going to get to the same answer. Right? So Taylor's formulation is --"
2018.17-778,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1857.4,1860.8,"Well, I'm confident the government wants to win this case no matter what. (Laughter.)"
2018.17-778,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,1860.8,1861.6,"No, if I -- If I could -- if I could just walk you through --"
2018.17-778,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1861.6,1862.68,But if you could walk through 29 --
2018.17-778,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,1862.68,1862.8,Yeah.
2018.17-778,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1862.8,1866.04,"-- versus 23, and why I should pay attention to one number rather than the other."
2018.17-778,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,1866.04,1882.08,"So -- so just -- the Taylor formulation is enter or remain. Twenty-nine states had remaining-in burglary, and the overwhelming majority of them were almost verbatim that formulation, just enter or remain, right, that's what they were saying. This is just what it means to remain in a place."
2018.17-778,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1911.88,1913.44,Maybe you could get to my question at some point.
2018.17-778,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,1913.44,1914.08,"Right, and --"
2018.17-778,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1914.08,1918.96,Which is why should I ignore those later judicial decisions? I guess I'm just looking for a reason why.
2018.17-778,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,1918.96,1924.8,"I -- I guess, we're -- I'm not trying to count -- so we're trying to put -- put two -- two different figures."
2018.17-778,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1977.92,1992.92,"You -- you -- just -- just to -- I'm sure the practical effects for the government are terrible and you don't want my sympathy, I'm sure, on any of that, but I -- I guess you'd agree with me judicial decisions normally operate retroactively?"
2018.17-778,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,1992.92,2001.36,"I agree with you that, yeah, that -- that ordinarily we understand the judicial opinions here to -- to reflect the state of the law as it existed at the time. I'm just trying to --"
2018.17-778,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2001.36,2005.8,How -- and I guess I'm just on a totally different tangent.
2018.17-778,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,2051.4,2051.8,So --
2018.17-778,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2051.8,2060.84,"Has the government considered about whether we should consider whether the states, if they call some things burglary, whether that should be dispositive, for example?"
2018.17-778,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,2060.84,2101.48,"To -- to my knowledge, we haven't changed our position on -- on -- or adopted any sort of new thing on that. But I -- I would say I think this case is honestly an opportunity to try to simplify things, that what you can just say here is that the Taylor formulation, it means what it says, right, that -- that enter or remain, that's good enough, that it doesn't matter how exactly the states define these things. And there's disagreement among the states on all kinds of other subsidiary issues. Right? What constitutes -- what makes your presence unprivileged, whether it extends to the whole building or only part of it? What exactly constitutes an entry? And Petitioner has given you no logical stopping point. And the reason is because they're already way past it."
2018.17-778,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2109.16,2109.72,Taylor says --
2018.17-778,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,2109.72,2114.12,"And I think that's really the heart, the heart of our submission here, that this is just too far down in the weeds."
2018.17-778,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2114.12,2118.36,"Taylor said ""substantially"" corresponds, not ""exactly"" corresponds."
2018.17-778,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,2118.36,2118.84,Right.
2018.17-778,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2137.68,2138.44,"I'm sorry, there's --"
2018.17-778,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,2138.44,2138.6,-- definition.
2018.17-778,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2139.84,2143.68,It can't be idiosyncratic because a number of states have accepted it.
2018.17-778,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,2148.24,2148.52,I -- I --
2018.17-778,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2148.52,2177.52,"You have the common law understanding that it was entry only and not remaining in. You have the use of ""surreptitious"" as a definition prior to this statute, which also has a -- a sense of, that you're surreptitious, that you're remaining in with the intent to do something because you're hiding from being found to do something. So I -- I -- I'm not sure how you call it idiosyncratic."
2018.17-778,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,2177.52,2181.56,So I -- I -- I -- I -- I think it is idiosyncratic.
2018.17-778,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2243.96,2260.16,"Do you think that it's a different reaction if you hear someone downstairs and they are in your pantry and you come down and they are stuffing their face with food, do you think you're going to have the same reaction to that person than you had to the person walking away with your TV?"
2018.17-778,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,2260.16,2260.76,I -- I -- I -- I think --
2018.17-778,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2260.76,2267.44,"Or somebody walking out of your house, you see they're empty-handed, except they have a coat on now. They're clearly homeless."
2018.17-778,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,2273.8,2279.96,"I -- I -- I think that your reaction to those different situations -- those different situations would be very different, but it would -- it doesn't depend on the timing rule."
2018.17-778,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2281.36,2281.64,I -- I guess --
2018.17-778,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,2281.64,2283.08,And I think the best illustration of this --
2018.17-778,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2283.08,2288.48,"I guess, I'm -- I'm sorry to interrupt, but -- again, but I -- I'm stuck on a little something differently."
2018.17-778,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2292.04,2298.72,"But I guess I'm wondering, though, those other crimes are bad, too."
2018.17-778,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,2314.64,2314.88,Right.
2018.17-778,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2314.88,2315.24,-- upon entry.
2018.17-778,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,2326.8,2327.0,So --
2018.17-778,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2327.0,2332.64,And -- and -- and -- and also possibly a majority of the jurisdictions in 1986.
2018.17-778,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,2337.44,2337.68,So it's --
2018.17-778,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2337.68,2339.8,-- than that it's too arcane.
2018.17-778,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,2339.8,2341.88,Just -- just -- I want to be clear.
2018.17-778,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2379.08,2390.52,"The law -- the law -- to pick up on Justice Kagan's question from earlier, the law had sufficiently changed by 1986 that the author of the opinion in Taylor knew enough to put ""remaining in."""
2018.17-778,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,2390.52,2391.36,Yeah.
2018.17-778,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2399.44,2399.92,Right.
2018.17-778,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,2462.64,2464.32,So a couple different responses to that.
2018.17-778,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2580.2,2586.24,"True, but we're -- we're trying to figure out something about the crime in general."
2018.17-778,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,2628.76,2628.96,Yeah.
2018.17-778,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2628.96,2630.44,Has anyone ever done that?
2018.17-778,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,2630.44,2634.6,I think honestly the -- the cases that are cited in these briefs do that.
2018.17-778,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2641.12,2642.56,I can only read so many. (Laughter.)
2018.17-778,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,2642.56,2643.68,Some of these are very significant --
2018.17-778,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2643.68,2646.64,Can I get help from my law clerks? (Laughter.)
2018.17-778,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,2646.64,2649.04,Many of these are -- yeah. Many of these are very significant crimes.
2018.17-778,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2729.76,2747.44,"Mr. Tripp, I'm not sure whether this is here nor there, but, you know, some of the serious crimes that you just mentioned, and they are extremely serious, if you went out on the street and asked a hundred people whether those assault cases are burglary, you would get a hundred ""no"" answers. Does that matter?"
2018.17-778,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,2747.44,2757.16,"I -- I think the -- the place where that instinct is most powerful is for the domestic violence situation, where I agree that that is like -- feels intuitively different."
2018.17-778,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2810.76,2810.8,In --
2018.17-778,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,2810.8,2811.68,-- the timing question does come up.
2018.17-778,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2811.68,2816.24,Some of them are and a certain amount of them aren't.
2018.17-778,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,2845.88,2850.96,"I mean, I'm sure people have thought of it, but to my knowledge, the -- the Department hasn't proposed any affirmative legislation on this."
2018.17-778,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2860.2,2860.52,Can I --
2018.17-778,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,2860.52,2860.8,If I can --
2018.17-778,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2860.8,2868.92,"-- ask the same question that I asked the other side, which is in the universe of burglaries, do you have a sense of how many are remaining in?"
2018.17-778,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,2868.92,2889.64,"I -- my sense is that it's pretty rare, that -- that it's pretty few, that in the, like, overwhelming number of burglary cases, you're going to have evidence of an unlawful entry and then that's just how you prove it up and that becomes the whole case. And I guess actually this gets out to this idea that our reading of ""remaining"" makes that prong more important than the ""entry"" prong."
2018.17-778,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2909.12,2917.32,"And if you were to lose this case, potentially all burglaries from how many states would no longer be able to be counted as --"
2018.17-778,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,2917.32,2920.68,"Yeah, it -- it would be 18 states and counting."
2018.17-778,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2932.32,2932.88,May I ask you the --
2018.17-778,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,2932.88,2933.04,And then --
2018.17-778,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2933.04,2941.6,"-- same question I asked Mr. Marwell, which -- how many of those states have other burglary statutes that you could capture, can I say real burglary in?"
2018.17-778,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,2941.6,2944.36,"I prefer not the real burglary, but, yeah."
2018.17-778,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2984.04,2984.24,Right.
2018.17-778,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,3029.52,3035.6,So it's -- it's equally consistent with Petitioner's as well because it covers any crime that's not covered.
2018.17-778,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3053.48,3054.44,I understand.
2018.17-778,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,3054.44,3056.8,Of the -- right? That's just the timing.
2018.17-778,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3056.8,3063.2,"But if that's too minor to care about, then why should we care about these other things, too, that were also part of common law burglary?"
2018.17-778,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,3063.2,3075.64,"I think part of the answer is that's -- that remains, first of all, the Taylor formulation and what the -- the overwhelming majority of states are doing. They are saying that you need to unlawfully enter or remain in a building or structure with intent to commit a crime."
2018.17-778,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3079.08,3080.32,So it isn't that it's too minor.
2018.17-778,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,3085.68,3089.28,I -- I think it's not just about it being minor and it's not just about counting.
2018.17-778,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3107.12,3107.36,Any crime?
2018.17-778,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,3107.36,3108.12,-- modern offense.
2018.17-778,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3178.76,3182.0,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Marwell, four minutes remaining."
2018.17-778,2,63132,jeremy_c_marwell,,3182.0,3191.0,"Thank you. On the bad cases that the government, the facts that the government alleges, there's no dispute that those are crimes."
2018.17-778,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3333.6,3335.72,"Thank you, counsel."
