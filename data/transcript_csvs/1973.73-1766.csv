1973.73-1766,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,23.304,"We’ll hear arguments in 73-1766, United States of America against Nixon and the cross-petition, Richard M. Nixon against the United States."
1973.73-1766,0,34642,leon_jaworski,,33.298,34.703,"That’s correct, sir."
1973.73-1766,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,34.703,39.649,It’ll be allowed to each side and we will not interrupt the argument with any recess.
1973.73-1766,0,34642,leon_jaworski,,41.697,42.185,"Thank you, sir."
1973.73-1766,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,42.185,44.5,"You may proceed whenever you’re ready, Mr. Jaworski."
1973.73-1766,0,34642,leon_jaworski,,44.5,48.825,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1973.73-1766,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,383.142,390.988,I don’t see the relevancy of the fact that the grand jury indicted the President as co-conspirator.
1973.73-1766,0,34642,leon_jaworski,,400.444,413.459,"The only relevance, Mr. Justice, lies in it being necessary to show under Rule 17c that there is some relevance to the material that we were seeking to subpoena, and --"
1973.73-1766,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,413.459,421.644,"Yes, but 17c presupposes a subpoena running against the party, and the President is no party."
1973.73-1766,0,34642,leon_jaworski,,423.889,429.46,"That’s correct, sir, but it was felt it would be necessary to show why."
1973.73-1766,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,443.845,451.916,I thought that was primarily just for the collage information of the House Judiciary Committee.
1973.73-1766,0,34642,leon_jaworski,,451.916,452.374,"No, sir."
1973.73-1766,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,468.935,473.135,"The grand jury sent it to the House Committee, didn’t it?"
1973.73-1766,0,34642,leon_jaworski,,473.135,476.905,The grand jury sent nothing of an accusatory nature to the House Committee.
1973.73-1766,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,496.56,504.004,"You’d still be here, Mr. Jaworski, whether or not the President had been named as an unindicted co-conspirator but that simply gives you another string to your bow."
1973.73-1766,0,34642,leon_jaworski,,505.083,509.802,It’s true that it admits some evidence that would otherwise not be admissible.
1973.73-1766,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,509.802,517.953,"Right, but even had the President not been named, you would still have subpoena at least part of this material."
1973.73-1766,0,34642,leon_jaworski,,517.953,520.923,"There’s no question about that, yes, sir."
1973.73-1766,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,520.923,521.761,And you’d still be here.
1973.73-1766,0,34642,leon_jaworski,,521.761,521.942,"That’s right, sir."
1973.73-1766,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,521.942,522.826,Would you not?
1973.73-1766,0,34642,leon_jaworski,,522.826,523.339,"That’s right, sir."
1973.73-1766,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,537.971,557.847,"No one yet has ever suggested that if you’re in a criminal trial, conspiracy trial, and some evidence is authored of an out-of-court statement of someone who’s alleged to be a co-conspirator, that it’s enough for the prosecution to then show that the grand jury had named him the co-conspirator."
1973.73-1766,0,34642,leon_jaworski,,557.847,558.084,No.
1973.73-1766,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,558.084,559.832,That never gets you or will never get you over the --
1973.73-1766,0,34642,leon_jaworski,,559.832,562.795,"No, and we don’t so contend."
1973.73-1766,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,562.795,564.976,"Well, then that was the point."
1973.73-1766,0,34642,leon_jaworski,,566.321,572.823,"No, this was in connection with the subpoenaing of this evidence, Mr. Justice."
1973.73-1766,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,577.601,578.622,I understand that.
1973.73-1766,0,34642,leon_jaworski,,578.622,579.485,"Yes, sir."
1973.73-1766,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,579.485,579.815,But --
1973.73-1766,0,34642,leon_jaworski,,579.815,580.541,And that was the point.
1973.73-1766,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,580.541,583.524,But you do not suggest that that’s all you need to show.
1973.73-1766,0,34642,leon_jaworski,,584.181,584.998,"No, sir, of course not."
1973.73-1766,1,29820,james_st_clair,,3362.099,3367.629,Mr. Chief Justice and members of the court.
1973.73-1766,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3412.392,3414.184,"None of our problems, are they?"
1973.73-1766,1,29820,james_st_clair,,3414.184,3417.756,"I think, sir, they really are."
1973.73-1766,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3422.012,3425.95,The sole authority to impeach this in the House --
1973.73-1766,1,29820,james_st_clair,,3425.95,3426.837,That’s correct.
1973.73-1766,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3426.837,3429.488,The sole authority to try this in the Senate.
1973.73-1766,1,29820,james_st_clair,,3429.488,3436.3,"Right, and the court shall not be used to implement or aid that process which what has happened in this case."
1973.73-1766,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3437.693,3438.535,How is that?
1973.73-1766,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3438.535,3439.79,Just how is this done?
1973.73-1766,1,29820,james_st_clair,,3439.79,3439.932,Alright --
1973.73-1766,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3439.932,3441.65,How is this case implemented?
1973.73-1766,1,29820,james_st_clair,,3441.65,3445.048,I would like to review some of the facts for you in this regard.
1973.73-1766,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3445.048,3446.992,Which are in the record?
1973.73-1766,1,29820,james_st_clair,,3446.992,3449.349,"Yes, my brother has mentioned them to you."
1973.73-1766,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3449.349,3451.965,"No, but are they in the record, not what he’s mentioned."
1973.73-1766,1,29820,james_st_clair,,3451.965,3453.493,"Yes, sir."
1973.73-1766,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3453.493,3456.989,"Well, we’re just an adjunct of the House."
1973.73-1766,1,29820,james_st_clair,,3460.009,3462.499,"Exactly right, sir."
1973.73-1766,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3467.559,3471.288,But the District Court’s decision stands.
1973.73-1766,1,29820,james_st_clair,,3472.268,3474.884,"No, the case should be dismissed, sir."
1973.73-1766,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3474.884,3482.099,"If we dismiss as improvidently granted, I submit the District Court’s premium would -- the judgment would stand."
1973.73-1766,1,29820,james_st_clair,,3482.099,3484.18,Then I would retract what I said.
1973.73-1766,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3489.397,3492.953,The case would be on appeal in the Court of Appeals if we dismissed it.
1973.73-1766,1,29820,james_st_clair,,3492.953,3493.676,Alright.
1973.73-1766,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3493.676,3499.31,Are you now talking about the bypassing of the Court of Appeals?
1973.73-1766,1,29820,james_st_clair,,3499.31,3499.722,"No, sir."
1973.73-1766,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3506.091,3512.32,"Well, if we dismiss this appeal as improvidently granted, it would go back to the Court of Appeals."
1973.73-1766,1,29820,james_st_clair,,3512.32,3515.169,"Well, as I say, I think this case should be dismissed."
1973.73-1766,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3515.169,3519.228,"No, really what you mean, isn’t it, you think that the order of Judge Sirica should be vacated --"
1973.73-1766,1,29820,james_st_clair,,3519.228,3520.078,Set aside.
1973.73-1766,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3520.078,3520.496,And set aside.
1973.73-1766,1,29820,james_st_clair,,3520.496,3521.06,"That’s right, yes."
1973.73-1766,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3521.06,3523.509,That’s quite different from dismissing the case.
1973.73-1766,1,29820,james_st_clair,,3523.509,3523.843,I agree.
1973.73-1766,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3523.843,3525.586,That’s deciding it on the merits.
1973.73-1766,1,29820,james_st_clair,,3525.586,3526.695,That’s right.
1973.73-1766,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3548.528,3549.84,"Well, it’s a political question here --"
1973.73-1766,1,29820,james_st_clair,,3549.84,3550.358,Exactly right.
1973.73-1766,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3550.358,3553.424,It’s a political question in the District Court.
1973.73-1766,1,29820,james_st_clair,,3553.424,3558.696,"And, therefore, it’s a non-justiciable issue in this and in the District Court."
1973.73-1766,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3560.832,3566.807,Did you argue that to the District Judge?
1973.73-1766,1,29820,james_st_clair,,3566.807,3569.622,I believe we argued a non-justiciability argument.
1973.73-1766,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3573.679,3583.018,Your position is that the issuance of a subpoena duces tecum is not a justiciable issue.
1973.73-1766,1,29820,james_st_clair,,3583.018,3587.753,"In this context at this time, sir."
1973.73-1766,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3658.325,3663.637,"But that, as I understand it, was not among the material that was conveyed to the grand jury."
1973.73-1766,1,29820,james_st_clair,,3669.492,3670.667,The material was turned over.
1973.73-1766,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3673.052,3674.985,"Now, just a moment."
1973.73-1766,1,29820,james_st_clair,,3687.447,3687.598,A grand jury --
1973.73-1766,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3687.598,3690.011,"It was released, I think, to the House of Representatives."
1973.73-1766,1,29820,james_st_clair,,3690.011,3692.351,"No, it was not."
1973.73-1766,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3692.351,3692.595,I thought—
1973.73-1766,1,29820,james_st_clair,,3692.595,3700.649,The material was sent to the House of Representatives in the belief that it was non-accusatory in nature.
1973.73-1766,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3702.185,3707.361,"Exactly, and that’s what Mr. Jaworski has represented again to us this morning, was the fact of the matter."
1973.73-1766,1,29820,james_st_clair,,3707.361,3718.104,"But the --Mr. Jaworski had available to him, unknown to the Judge and unknown to counsel for the President, a secret indictment naming the President as a co-conspirator."
1973.73-1766,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3721.602,3723.023,"Now, followed in what form?"
1973.73-1766,1,29820,james_st_clair,,3723.023,3724.37,By a newspaper leak.
1973.73-1766,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3724.37,3727.643,"Yes, it wasn’t sent from the court over to the House, was it?"
1973.73-1766,1,29820,james_st_clair,,3727.643,3728.489,It didn’t have to be.
1973.73-1766,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3743.32,3746.935,"I’m not sure, perhaps you can help me."
1973.73-1766,1,29820,james_st_clair,,3767.802,3775.145,I think it would’ve been quite appropriate because the judge’s decision was based on the proposition there was nothing accusatory.
1973.73-1766,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3873.439,3877.66,How far does your point go?
1973.73-1766,1,29820,james_st_clair,,3902.899,3903.77,I would not say that.
1973.73-1766,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3912.342,3913.202,Setting that to one side.
1973.73-1766,1,29820,james_st_clair,,3913.202,3914.092,In this case --
1973.73-1766,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3914.092,3931.187,"You’re saying that the courts, as I understand it, have to stop dead in their tracks from doing their ordinary business in any matter involving even, tangentially, the President of the United States if or as of when the Committee of the House of Representative is investigating impeachment."
1973.73-1766,1,29820,james_st_clair,,3931.187,3932.402,"No, Justice Stewart, I’m not."
1973.73-1766,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3937.374,3938.705,"Well, here are --"
1973.73-1766,1,29820,james_st_clair,,3938.705,3939.227,Should the President --
1973.73-1766,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3939.227,3940.679,Seven people have been indicted.
1973.73-1766,1,29820,james_st_clair,,3942.091,3944.638,Right.
1973.73-1766,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3944.638,3947.186,The trial is scheduled for next September 9.
1973.73-1766,1,29820,james_st_clair,,3947.186,3947.708,Right.
1973.73-1766,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3947.708,3949.922,The prosecutor is preparing for that trial.
1973.73-1766,1,29820,james_st_clair,,3972.623,3986.963,"I say it should not go forward a this time, at the very least, because the subject matter being inquired of in the large measure before the House Committee is exactly the same subject matter being involved in this argument."
1973.73-1766,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3986.963,3987.475,How do we know?
1973.73-1766,1,29820,james_st_clair,,3987.475,3989.679,"Namely, should the President produce tapes?"
1973.73-1766,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3990.55,3990.591,"Well, what --"
1973.73-1766,1,29820,james_st_clair,,3990.591,3990.623,Not stand on --
1973.73-1766,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3990.623,3993.871,One in these tapes involves the impeachment proceedings.
1973.73-1766,1,29820,james_st_clair,,3993.871,3994.89,Pardon?
1973.73-1766,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3994.89,4000.215,"What, in any of these tapes, is involved in the impeachment proceedings?"
1973.73-1766,1,29820,james_st_clair,,4000.215,4004.307,"Well, if Your Honor please, the House of Representatives have subpoenaed these and more tapes."
1973.73-1766,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4004.307,4007.653,"Well, I don’t know which of the tapes."
1973.73-1766,1,29820,james_st_clair,,4008.662,4009.803,"No, I don’t."
1973.73-1766,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4009.803,4010.595,You don’t know either.
1973.73-1766,1,29820,james_st_clair,,4014.563,4022.385,"Well, I don know that there’s a preliminary showing that they re conversations between the President and his close aids, and --"
1973.73-1766,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4022.385,4024.391,Regardless of what it is.
1973.73-1766,1,29820,james_st_clair,,4024.391,4029.015,Regardless of what it is and may involve a number of subjects.
1973.73-1766,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4029.015,4030.135,But you don’t know.
1973.73-1766,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4030.135,4034.165,But does not the Special Prosecutor claim that the subject matter is the same?
1973.73-1766,1,29820,james_st_clair,,4034.165,4036.749,"He claims that, but he has no way of showing it."
1973.73-1766,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,4044.224,4054.766,"This claim was honored but this court -- all would have to leave the evidence and go to Judge Sirica who would take it, examine it in cameras."
1973.73-1766,1,29820,james_st_clair,,4054.766,4059.975,I presume that’s so and he would then -- it would be made available to the Special Prosecutor.
1973.73-1766,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4065.863,4069.518,"Mr. St. Clair, going back to this murder witness situation."
1973.73-1766,1,29820,james_st_clair,,4091.28,4092.112,That is quite correct.
1973.73-1766,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4092.112,4097.121,"The testimony of the Justices of this court has been given in past times by depositions, has it not?"
1973.73-1766,1,29820,james_st_clair,,4097.121,4103.359,"Really, it’s a matter of accommodation not as a matter of assertion of a right of one branch over another."
1973.73-1766,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4118.042,4122.684,"If that’s true, why are you willing to give up 20 or so?"
1973.73-1766,1,29820,james_st_clair,,4122.684,4126.106,"Well, that’s a very good question I’d like to answer."
1973.73-1766,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4132.451,4134.207,"Well, I’m talking about this case."
1973.73-1766,1,29820,james_st_clair,,4136.586,4140.805,"Yes, we will because they’ve already been made public."
1973.73-1766,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4140.805,4143.544,The tapes or the transcription?
1973.73-1766,1,29820,james_st_clair,,4143.544,4151.18,"We are -- as soon as a judge approves some method of validating the accuracy of these tapes, they can have --"
1973.73-1766,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4151.18,4151.569,The tapes?
1973.73-1766,1,29820,james_st_clair,,4151.569,4153.392,"They can have the tapes, but you have to understand."
1973.73-1766,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4171.785,4180.996,Would the tapes that you’re willing to release be valuable to the Watergate Committee in time?
1973.73-1766,1,29820,james_st_clair,,4180.996,4181.773,We think so.
1973.73-1766,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4182.803,4186.162,"Well, I thought you said you didn’t want them to have anything."
1973.73-1766,1,29820,james_st_clair,,4186.162,4186.296,"No, sir."
1973.73-1766,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4186.296,4191.474,"And this was merely an evident way of getting stuff over to him, but you were getting some."
1973.73-1766,1,29820,james_st_clair,,4191.474,4192.723,I say this.
1973.73-1766,2,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,8384.752,8387.55,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1973.73-1766,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,8501.01,8516.533,"The fact that I’d like to ask before you get too far, let’s assume you get by the jurisdictional matters and also the standing question, the intra-executive dispute matter, and we get to the executive privilege or we get to the merits, so-called."
1973.73-1766,2,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,8516.533,8516.635,Yes.
1973.73-1766,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,8516.635,8525.571,"Which into this case would we normally start at anyway, the 17c end or the executive privilege end?"
1973.73-1766,2,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,8525.571,8540.764,"Well I think, normally, you might start with 17c end because that would provide for a conceivably for disposition on non-constitutional grounds if you found that we had not made a sufficient showing to satisfy the ordinary requirements of the rule."
1973.73-1766,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,8542.671,8548.968,"Mr. Lacovara, Judge Sirica found that you had satisfied the requirements."
1973.73-1766,2,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,8548.968,8549.447,"Absolutely, he --"
1973.73-1766,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,8549.447,8552.602,Then what’s the scope of our review?
1973.73-1766,2,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,8552.602,8571.962,We have made the suggestion that any appellant court reviewing this kind of determination applies the standard of whether the District Judge was intimately familiar with this indictment and with the 49-page Appendix showing that we submitted in demonstrating why each of these 64 subpoenaed conversations was material.
1973.73-1766,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,8576.397,8577.399,What’s our standard of appellate review?
1973.73-1766,2,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,8577.399,8581.876,And your standard review should be whether he has abused his discretion.
1973.73-1766,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,8581.876,8582.625,Clearly erroneous?
1973.73-1766,2,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,8582.625,8584.635,"Clearly erroneous standard, yes, sir."
1973.73-1766,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,8584.635,8587.221,What about the standard?
1973.73-1766,2,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,8587.221,8587.873,"I’m sorry, which --"
1973.73-1766,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,8587.873,8591.609,"Based on the standard he followed, what about the basic standard of 17c?"
1973.73-1766,2,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,8591.609,8598.649,The parties are in agreement that Bowman Dairy and Iozia that District Court decision established the basic criteria --
1973.73-1766,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,8598.649,8605.564,The government is in agreement that the standards of Iozia must be satisfied in this case under 17c?
1973.73-1766,2,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,8605.564,8609.66,"Well, we have suggested that it’s possible that a lower standard can be applied."
1973.73-1766,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,8609.66,8610.542,"Well, that’s what I’m asking you."
1973.73-1766,2,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,8611.44,8624.26,"Well, my position would be that when you’re talking about a subpoena to a third party, as distinguished from an intra-case subpoena between government and defendant, a lower standard or relevancy or materiality should --"
1973.73-1766,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,8624.26,8626.497,So the parties are not in agreement at all?
1973.73-1766,2,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,8626.497,8638.123,"Well, we have suggested that even if the proper standard is applied, that we meet that standard because of the showing that we made that each of these items is --"
1973.73-1766,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,8638.123,8640.56,Do you mean a necessity standard?
1973.73-1766,2,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,8640.56,8647.785,Necessity in a sense of being relevant to the issues to be tried and being of an evidentiary nature.
1973.73-1766,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,8658.596,8661.436,"Well, what about Mr. St. Clair’s argument?"
1973.73-1766,2,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,8668.587,8673.637,"That, obviously, we don’t think is a proper legal standard and the courts have said."
1973.73-1766,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,8708.557,8712.651,You think Iozia just means only evidentiary and relevant.
1973.73-1766,2,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,8715.036,8719.287,"When you’re talking about a subpoena between the parties, yes, sir."
1973.73-1766,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,8732.177,8745.301,So you don’t think Iozia and Bowman requires any showing that this particular evidence be something more than evidentiary and relevant?
1973.73-1766,2,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,8745.301,8746.212,That it’d be critical?
1973.73-1766,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,8775.267,8779.908,"Yes, but you apparently concede that you can’t use it just for discovery."
1973.73-1766,2,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,8779.908,8780.468,"Yes, sir."
1973.73-1766,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,8780.468,8788.459,"And you say the evidence you’re seeking by a subpoena, you must make some kind of a minimal showing of admissibility."
1973.73-1766,2,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,8793.463,8795.585,"Well, I hope I’m not conceding more than I should."
1973.73-1766,2,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,8852.471,8857.069,I just want to get the government’s position because it is a rather important part of the case.
1973.73-1766,2,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,8857.069,8859.9,"Yes, sir."
1973.73-1766,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,8917.295,8930.477,"Mr. Lacovara, I don’t think it’d be very hard to understand the developments of a showing at the trial for purposes of evidence that certain people are co-conspirators --"
1973.73-1766,2,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,8930.477,8930.839,"Yes, sir."
1973.73-1766,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,8930.839,8934.121,For purposes of introduction of evidence.
1973.73-1766,2,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,8941.643,8942.163,Yes.
1973.73-1766,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,8966.287,8978.08,"It may be so but even if they named it in the indictment, that isn’t enough on which to base the introduction of out-of-court statements by an unindicted co-conspirator."
1973.73-1766,2,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,8978.08,8982.582,"Yes, that was the point that I wanted to get to in discussing what we call our clot argument."
1973.73-1766,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,9104.38,9110.434,One of your grounds for the non-applicability of the privilege is that these conversations were in the course of the conspirators.
1973.73-1766,2,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,9110.434,9112.208,"Yes, sir, and we --"
1973.73-1766,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,9112.208,9116.789,"And that, you say, is satisfied by merely the grand jury?"
1973.73-1766,2,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,9116.789,9117.576,"No, sir."
1973.73-1766,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,9118.734,9119.199,Just a moment.
1973.73-1766,2,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,9119.199,9119.664,I’m sorry.
1973.73-1766,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,9119.664,9131.341,It isn’t satisfied merely by the grand jury finding so a court must go on and make it so a determination if they were going to agree with you on this ground.
1973.73-1766,2,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,9131.341,9133.521,Let me back up a little.
1973.73-1766,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,9201.453,9208.708,"That showing or such a showing could arguably have been made whether or not the grand jury had named the President, would it not?"
1973.73-1766,2,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,9208.708,9209.159,"Yes, sir."
1973.73-1766,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,9211.953,9213.329,And you say it was?
1973.73-1766,2,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,9213.329,9214.051,Pardon me?
1973.73-1766,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,9214.051,9219.77,Isn’t it your position that it was independently of the naming of the President as an unindicted co-conspirator?
1973.73-1766,2,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,9219.77,9220.165,"Yes, sir."
1973.73-1766,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,9294.995,9296.157,Mr. Lacovara.
1973.73-1766,2,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,9296.157,9297.284,Sir.
1973.73-1766,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,9297.284,9299.841,Just back up a minute.
1973.73-1766,2,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,9306.733,9307.343,"No, sir."
1973.73-1766,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,9307.343,9308.679,You do not.
1973.73-1766,2,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,9312.461,9316.466,"We have not expressed a position on that, Mr. Justice Powell."
1973.73-1766,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,9316.466,9329.757,"Let’s assume for the moment that he could not be, would you still argue that the grand jury had the power or the right and, if so, by virtue of what?"
1973.73-1766,2,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,9329.757,9330.243,"Yes, we argue that --"
1973.73-1766,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,9330.243,9332.197,To name him as an unindicted co-conspirator.
1973.73-1766,2,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,9332.197,9336.134,"We do, in fact, make that argument at some length."
1973.73-1766,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,9438.105,9474.538,"The thing that I was wondering about is that there is only one President and the executive power is vested in him, and I do wonder whether or not the precedents you said with respect to other people would vest this to a grand jury either on his own motion or because of some prosecutor suggested while the President is in office to name him as an unindicted co-conspirator with grand jury sitting all over the United States."
1973.73-1766,2,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,9483.4,9488.243,"It is, Mr. Justice, and there’s no doubt about it."
1973.73-1766,3,29820,james_st_clair,,10399.163,10402.969,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice and members of the court."
1973.73-1766,3,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,10510.47,10515.37,"Well, under that theory, all the criminal trials that are going on should stop today."
1973.73-1766,3,29820,james_st_clair,,10515.37,10520.341,"That would not be the first time, Mr. Justice Douglas, that a criminal trial was delayed."
1973.73-1766,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,10749.557,10750.598,"Thank you, Mr. St. Clair."
