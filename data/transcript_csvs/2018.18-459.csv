2018.18-459,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.47,9.51,"We'll hear argument next in Case 18-459, Emulex Corporation versus Varjabedian. Mr. Garre."
2018.18-459,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,9.51,43.095,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Ninth Circuit in this case recognized an unprecedented inferred private right to recover for negligent violations of Section 14(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. For two independent reasons, we would ask this Court to reverse that decision. First, as the government itself recognizes, this Court's precedents compel the conclusion that Section 14(e) does not confer any implied private right at all."
2018.18-459,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,43.095,63.79999995,"Mr. Garre, why should we consider that when it wasn't raised in this case until, what was it, the motion for rehearing in the court of appeals? It went through the trial court, court of appeals, not a word -- everybody accepted there was a private right of action."
2018.18-459,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,82.575,83.2,Sure.
2018.18-459,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,151.81,152.075,But --
2018.18-459,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,152.075,157.45,And we cited the Ninth Circuit's decision explaining why there could be no private of right of action under Section 17(a).
2018.18-459,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,158.21,171.685,"I mean, Mr. Garre, that is the single sentence, right? And you don't ask the Ninth Circuit to overrule its decisions about private rights of action; it's really more just part of your argument about the negligence standard, isn't it?"
2018.18-459,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,171.685,173.51,"No, I -- I would disagree with that."
2018.18-459,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,194.03,196.14,"You're saying that, but, I mean, I just want to add to what --"
2018.18-459,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,196.14,196.28,Right.
2018.18-459,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,196.28,197.23,-- Justice Kagan said.
2018.18-459,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,206.295,207.03,That's correct.
2018.18-459,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,207.45,207.71,End quote.
2018.18-459,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,217.53,218.505,But to your --
2018.18-459,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,218.505,219.815,It's the same question.
2018.18-459,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,219.815,242.15,"If I could address Justice Breyer's point just quickly, we did say at the panel stage that we did not dispute the existence of the private right because, of course, we couldn't; Ninth Circuit precedent had recognized that right. We did not, I think it's important to add, concede the existence of a private right. I think there's a difference between saying we don't dispute it and we agree with it. Now, I'm sorry, Justice Kagan."
2018.18-459,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,242.15,244.195,"Well, I think you -- it's the same question."
2018.18-459,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,244.195,244.59,Right.
2018.18-459,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,254.72,260.925,"You answered -- you answered discretion, but you don't answer why."
2018.18-459,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,287.61,297.12,"Well, there was no strategic gamesmanship here, Justice Sotomayor. We -- the -- the broader argument, as even my friend concedes, is fairly included within the question presented."
2018.18-459,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,301.17,303.59,"You're not dealing with what I just asked, which is --"
2018.18-459,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,303.59,305.31,The -- the broader issue is this Court should --
2018.18-459,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,305.31,309.1,-- you could write almost any question and throw the kitchen sink if you choose.
2018.18-459,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,318.48,319.53,Okay.
2018.18-459,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,331.1,331.77,I wasn't here.
2018.18-459,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,334.02,336.23,"Well, and -- and the dissenters obviously did."
2018.18-459,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,336.23,336.71,-- why should we reward --
2018.18-459,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,336.71,354.67,"And the reason is, is because this is an issue that is interdependent with the question of whether or not there could be inferred private right of action for negligence. It would be silly for this Court to say there can be inferred right for negligence, but -- but the -- but everybody would recognize, I think, that there is no --"
2018.18-459,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,354.67,358.17,"That -- that's what the SE -- that's what the government says, that there is."
2018.18-459,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,358.17,360.28,"Well, the government says there's no private right of action at all."
2018.18-459,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,360.92,375.165,"No, no, no, no, they say that the statute involves negligence. So we can find that it involves negligence and leave for another day whether there's a private cause of action or the right only belongs to the SE -- to the SEC."
2018.18-459,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,375.165,395.54,"I -- I think where I would take issue with that, Justice Sotomayor, is -- is the government, in the first part of the government's brief, I understand addressed the question of what would be the standard in an express action brought by the SEC. I don't really understand the government to be saying they think that in an implied private right of action, if it exists, you could have claims for negligence."
2018.18-459,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,402.075,402.84,They'll let us know.
2018.18-459,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,402.84,405.76,-- that there's simply no private right of action at all.
2018.18-459,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,419.16,425.695,"If you had -- if you had made it an explicit question, there's no circuit split on the question, is there?"
2018.18-459,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,425.695,428.99,"There's not, and nor was there in the Central Bank case."
2018.18-459,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,482.945,484.57,That's true -- that's true of 14(a) also.
2018.18-459,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,484.57,486.55,It is.
2018.18-459,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,486.55,489.485,"And -- and under 14(a), there is a private right of action."
2018.18-459,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,489.485,490.785,Thanks to Borak.
2018.18-459,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,499.86,504.1,"But even so, it's -- it's alive for -- under 14(a)."
2018.18-459,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,520.62,521.62,"Yes, Your Honor."
2018.18-459,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,521.62,524.355,So proxy statements go one way.
2018.18-459,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,526.295,529.31,"So we do think it's rational, Your Honor."
2018.18-459,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,588.05,595.46,"But Sandoval, I think, makes clear, Mr. Garre, that we're not -- I mean, the first question is, is there rights-creating language?"
2018.18-459,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,595.46,595.55,Right.
2018.18-459,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,595.55,632.0,"But that beyond that, even if there's not rights-creating language, if there's legal context that indicates that Congress meant to create private rights of action, then we should take that legal context into account. And -- and, here, it seems that there are at least two features of the legal context. One is the one that Justice Ginsburg said, which is this was meant to create a gap as to treating tender offers the same way as using proxy statements with respect to mergers, and Congress gave no indication that it wanted to treat those differently."
2018.18-459,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,668.115,669.11,"Not here, Your Honor."
2018.18-459,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,687.47,688.06,What about the --
2018.18-459,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,688.06,703.835,"I'm sorry, don't -- aren't we looking to the text for what congressional intent is? And to the extent that that's the issue, what did Congress intend with this language?"
2018.18-459,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,703.835,705.455,Well --
2018.18-459,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,705.455,719.56,"Is -- aren't all the facts that Justice Kagan put forth more meaningful in terms of Congress's intent? Because, if Congress didn't agree with this, it had a whole lot of years to change things around."
2018.18-459,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,721.185,741.11,"Well, if -- if that's where you're coming from, Justice Sotomayor, then you should agree with us that there's no implied private right of action for negligence because the status quo was courts had an implied right of action under Section 14(e) for scienter. So, if that's where you're coming from, then you should decide the case on the narrower ground and --"
2018.18-459,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,741.11,743.19,They had it under 14(a) or --
2018.18-459,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,743.19,747.13,-- and hold that 14 -- any implied right of action requires scienter.
2018.18-459,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,747.13,747.28,Are --
2018.18-459,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,747.28,750.71,"But, as -- as to Borak and the -- I'm sorry, Justice Kavanaugh."
2018.18-459,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,750.71,751.595,Keep going.
2018.18-459,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,751.595,756.82,"As to Borak and the timing, again, this is the same argument that was rejected in Sandoval."
2018.18-459,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,775.8,794.87,"But Sandoval accepted the Cannon principle, right, which is that if Congress specifically takes language that's been held to create a private right of action and replicates that language, then that counts as a pretty strong indicator that Congress has meant for the same result to obtain."
2018.18-459,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,794.87,798.815,"It mentioned that in the context of Cannon, but here's why that doesn't work here."
2018.18-459,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,826.94,851.075,"But 10(b) makes clear that it's -- even the statutory language in 10(b) makes clear that it's going to take its content from the rules and regulations that are designed to implement it. And then 10b-5 comes along and essentially gives 10(b) its content, and all of these courts go the exact same way, whether it was right or wrong, and say private right of action follows from that."
2018.18-459,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,854.335,869.33,"Well, this Court in 1971, which was after the time that Congress passed the Williams Act in Section 14(e), finally acquiesced in recognizing an implied private right under Section 10(b) for Rule 10b-5 violations."
2018.18-459,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,873.55,889.07,"But that was the framework in the same way that that was the Cannon framework, is that Congress is looking at something, a particular set of words that has been found uniformly to create a private right of action, and then Congress writes those same words."
2018.18-459,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,889.07,896.555,"Again, I would disagree with you because the words that matter for purposes of an implied right of action under 10(b) are 10(b)."
2018.18-459,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,902.03,914.57,"I mean, that just seems incredibly artificial, Mr. Garre, because 10b-5 had been created and everybody understood that 10b-5 was the governing standard and that private rights of action went along with that governing standard."
2018.18-459,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,914.57,928.605,"Under -- if that's true, it's under the Borak-type framework that courts would supply remedies when Congress didn't, but this Court was very clear about this in Sandoval, and I believe other cases, where it said that regulations can't create implied private rights."
2018.18-459,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,933.74,952.08,"So -- so, on Justice Kagan's questions, to pick up on those, in Sandoval, in distinguishing the prior cases, it said two of those involved Congress's enactment or reenactment of the verbatim statutory text that courts had previously interpreted to create a private right of action."
2018.18-459,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,952.08,953.11,Yes.
2018.18-459,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,953.11,960.825,Now it sounds like the way you respond to that is to say statutory text as compared to regulatory text.
2018.18-459,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,962.84,963.05,Right.
2018.18-459,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,974.25,977.58,"Well, that's a -- that's a question of how we interpret that sentence in Sandoval."
2018.18-459,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,977.58,977.775,Right.
2018.18-459,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,978.2,989.5,"But, if we interpret that sentence in Sandoval as setting a principle, which I take your point on that, I understand that, but if we do, then your distinction of it is statutory text versus regulatory text?"
2018.18-459,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,989.5,989.7,Right.
2018.18-459,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,993.915,1001.58,"But even though Rule 10(b)'s substantive scope is defined in terms of regulations, by the terms of 10(b) itself."
2018.18-459,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1001.58,1003.78,I would say it's a different statute.
2018.18-459,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1022.64,1023.015,Can I --
2018.18-459,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1023.015,1023.81,For -- yes.
2018.18-459,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1023.81,1024.145,Go on.
2018.18-459,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1024.6,1025.65,"No, no, please."
2018.18-459,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1025.65,1027.38,Can I get your broader argument --
2018.18-459,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1027.38,1027.49,Sure.
2018.18-459,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1027.49,1030.02,-- about why this sentence in Sandoval you said --
2018.18-459,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1030.02,1038.08,"Because Sandoval, if you continue down to the end of that paragraph on Cannon, said context is relevant, but it's only relevant as it informs text."
2018.18-459,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1046.19,1084.255,"But -- but I guess don't you think that the point of Sandoval and -- and -- and it should be the point of all our decisions is, yes, we want to know what Congress was intending to do here, but we're not going to throw out the whole statutory interpretation toolbox, except for the text, because sometimes context matters a great deal in understanding text. And what we really want to know is, what did those words mean when people enacted those words at that time? And for us to be able to answer that question, the statutory context is extremely important, isn't it?"
2018.18-459,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1084.255,1091.27,I think Sandoval answers that by saying statutory context informs -- is relevant as it informs text.
2018.18-459,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1141.92,1166.78,"So tell me if I'm -- if I'm misinterpreting what you're saying, but I had thought that the -- that the line that Sandoval drew was, look, before now, what Congress did -- excuse me, what the courts did was they just basically said: Oh, look, if a -- if a -- if a private right of action kind of fits with the purpose of a statute as broadly defined, then we should have a private right of action. And this Court said: Absolutely not, to that endeavor."
2018.18-459,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1196.43,1197.06,No.
2018.18-459,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1236.755,1236.96,Mister --
2018.18-459,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1236.96,1241.72,"-- where the government itself isn't arguing for that. I'm sorry, Justice Ginsburg."
2018.18-459,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1241.72,1251.47,"Before -- your white light is on, I appreciate that, but you presented one question clearly, and that was scienter versus negligence."
2018.18-459,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1251.47,1251.59,Yes.
2018.18-459,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1251.59,1265.825,"So I'd like you to tell me, do I understand you right to say not even the SEC would have a right to sue for negligence under 14(e), not even the SEC?"
2018.18-459,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1265.825,1266.555,That's right.
2018.18-459,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1298.28,1317.34,"Why? Because, I mean -- sorry, because your time is -- do you want to answer this when you get back up? I mean, look, the language of 14(e) that we're talking about is the same as the language of 10b-5, and 10b-5 copied its language from -- what is it --"
2018.18-459,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1317.34,1317.77,Section 17(a).
2018.18-459,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1317.77,1318.22,"Yes, 17(a)."
2018.18-459,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1331.275,1331.94,"Well, proxy statements --"
2018.18-459,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1331.94,1346.87,"So why would you want to have one set of language meaning negligence, where they try to take you over by proxy statements, but a different set -- but exactly the same words, not negligence, when they try to take you over by a tender offer?"
2018.18-459,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1346.87,1374.65,"Well, in here we're talking about the difference between Rule 10b-5 and Section 14(e), and both, we would say, require scienter. But what I would say is that when it comes into policies of negligence versus scienter, there should be a real concern on the part of this Court that interpreting Section 14(e) to go all the way to negligence, which would be unprecedented in the 50-year history here, would result in the dumping of information, would be -- ultimately be counterproductive. And I would ask this Court to reserve the remainder of my time."
2018.18-459,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1374.65,1381.04,"Thank you, counsel. Ms. Ratner."
2018.18-459,1,63108,morgan_l_ratner,,1381.04,1390.06,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Section 14(e) does cover negligent misrepresentations, but it does not authorize private enforcement."
2018.18-459,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1390.06,1400.875,"Even if we find a private cause of action, Mr. Garre says that you didn't answer that question in your brief. So assume we were to find an implied cause of action."
2018.18-459,1,63108,morgan_l_ratner,,1403.575,1408.9,We think that the text is sufficiently clear that it covers negligent misrepresentations.
2018.18-459,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1416.38,1438.27,"Could you answer Justice Breyer's point, which is -- I -- I took his point to be that since 14(e) borrows the language of 10-5, and we have all along interpreted 10b-5 to require scienter, why shouldn't we require the same standard here?"
2018.18-459,1,63108,morgan_l_ratner,,1438.27,1438.81,Well --
2018.18-459,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1438.81,1443.61,"I think that was his question of Mr. Garre, so that's my question to you."
2018.18-459,1,63108,morgan_l_ratner,,1468.31,1474.355,"No, Justice Sotomayor. So the language, first of all, of 10b-5 had not already been interpreted that way."
2018.18-459,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1510.21,1522.2,"But before we get to that, just one more question on -- on the mens rea element. I understand that Ernst came later, but normally we do read the same language to mean the same thing, so I'd like you to address that problem."
2018.18-459,1,63108,morgan_l_ratner,,1522.2,1522.62,Well --
2018.18-459,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1522.62,1547.11,"And then, second -- second problem is I understand the point about negligence being what we normally assume Congress to use when -- when it's a civil matter. But the penalties here are pretty significant and -- available under this section, and maybe equivalent to and worse than a lot of criminal offenses."
2018.18-459,1,63108,morgan_l_ratner,,1556.48,1564.63,"So, on your first question, the language can't always mean the same thing because we already have it meaning different things in 17(a) and Rule 10b-5."
2018.18-459,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1635.86,1683.46,"I mean, I guess I understand the distinction as a distinction but not why it matters, because what we're trying to find out is what Congress was doing. And it seems to me that when you have 10(b) and it says the content of this is going to be done by rules, and Congress enacts -- and the agency enacts 10b-5, and everybody knows that's the substantive standard, and then all these courts say that, as to that substantive standard, 10(b) gives a private right of action, and then Congress comes back and recites the substantive standard, doesn't Congress think that the private right of action go with it? You would to have be like a super-duper, super lawyer to say, oh, well, it's a little bit different because the substantive standard is split up from the private right of action."
2018.18-459,1,63108,morgan_l_ratner,,1686.075,1693.35,"Well, Justice Kagan, again, the question is not just what Congress expected as a matter of contemporary legal context; it's what it said."
2018.18-459,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1768.38,1770.59,"Those decisions came after 1968, though?"
2018.18-459,1,63108,morgan_l_ratner,,1770.59,1771.82,That's correct.
2018.18-459,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1772.17,1774.275,"That's the argument on the other side, right?"
2018.18-459,1,63108,morgan_l_ratner,,1774.275,1786.91,"That's correct, that they may not have been decided at the time, but I do think they illustrate that this isn't some sort of code word or some sort of term of art that carries with it a private right of action. Given --"
2018.18-459,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1786.91,1803.585,"Could you explain why -- could you explain why you think it's appropriate for us to reach the question whether there's a private right of action? If you were the Respondent here, would you think that that claim was properly before us? Is that the precedent you want us to set?"
2018.18-459,1,63108,morgan_l_ratner,,1803.585,1812.34,"So we think as an ordinary mortar -- as an ordinary matter, this Court does not consider questions that have been neither pressed nor passed upon."
2018.18-459,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1839.15,1844.1,"On your -- on your antecedent point, Schreiber did something similar, isn't that correct?"
2018.18-459,1,63108,morgan_l_ratner,,1844.1,1848.53,So Schreiber did go on to consider the scope of Section 14(e).
2018.18-459,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1906.9,1911.145,The right of action's been recognized in lower courts for quite a while.
2018.18-459,1,63108,morgan_l_ratner,,1917.71,1922.56,We're not taking our position here as a basis of policy either for or against the private right of action.
2018.18-459,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1922.56,1933.02,"True, but -- but faced with a wall of lower court precedent, that sometimes is considered as a factor in thinking about the state of the law."
2018.18-459,1,63108,morgan_l_ratner,,1933.02,1934.78,"Yeah, I -- I would note that --"
2018.18-459,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1934.78,1937.62,"If there are no real-world problems, that is one thing."
2018.18-459,1,63108,morgan_l_ratner,,1940.75,1986.205,"So, first, we think the most obvious real-world problem is the existence of a private right of action has led lower courts to create the scienter standard, which we don't think is the proper scope of the Commission's enforcement authority. And I would just flag that, as a general matter in the private rights context, it is a pretty common situation in Central Bank, in Sandoval, in Transamerica, that the lower courts are uniform in finding a private right of action that this Court then says doesn't exist because they've been following their earlier precedent. So I -- I -- I do recognize, given, I believe, Justice Ginsburg's question earlier that this does create an anomaly between 14(a) and 14(e) in terms of their enforceability, but that's an anomaly as a result of Sandoval. Thank you."
2018.18-459,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1986.205,1991.905,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Geyser."
2018.18-459,2,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,1991.905,2040.875,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Although we submit only one question is properly presented, this entire dispute can be resolved looking to this Court's usual tools of statutory construction and the text, context, purpose, and history of Section 14(e). As for the culpability standard, scienter is not required under the plain words that Congress chose for this statute or this Court's decisions construing materially indistinguishable language in 17(a) in Aaron, and even in Ernst & Ernst itself, where it said that a standalone reading of Rule 10b-5 would, in fact, support a negligence standard. As for the private right of action, this case presents the exceptionally rare situation where Congress unmistakably intended this very statute to be privately enforceable, despite not including an express private remedy."
2018.18-459,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2040.875,2045.15,"Well, we -- we now know that that was not the right approach, right, in Borak?"
2018.18-459,2,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,2045.15,2046.42,"Well, Borak was on --"
2018.18-459,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2046.42,2048.56,Borak would not be decided the same way today.
2018.18-459,2,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,2048.56,2053.6,"Borak may not be decided the same way today, but, again, our position is not rooted in Borak at all."
2018.18-459,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2077.57,2077.79,Right.
2018.18-459,2,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,2108.28,2109.71,"Exactly, Your Honor."
2018.18-459,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2129.475,2131.02,But it wasn't the statute.
2018.18-459,2,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,2146.56,2151.93,"So, for -- looking first to the fact that this came from a rule, I don't think that -- I think that is a distinction without a difference."
2018.18-459,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2182.37,2200.26,"Well, we usually look -- to pick up on the Chief Justice's point, we look at the text of the statute these days, and if it's not a private cause of action, we're not overruling ones that recognize private rights of action before, but we're not expanding it either. Central Bank makes that clear and Sandoval and lots -- lots of other cases."
2018.18-459,2,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,2200.26,2202.07,"We -- we fully agree, Justice Kavanaugh."
2018.18-459,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2205.71,2210.25,"There's no -- just to state the obvious, there's no private right of action in the text."
2018.18-459,2,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,2210.25,2210.85,Exactly.
2018.18-459,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2234.4,2238.19,But it's not just a question of Congress's words or even Congress's intent.
2018.18-459,2,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,2267.75,2272.7,"Mr. Chief Justice, I think exceeding the court's limit is doing something Congress did not intend."
2018.18-459,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2310.05,2312.07,And why -- why didn't they do it then?
2018.18-459,2,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,2312.07,2322.14,"They -- I -- I think for the same reason there that they -- in 14(a) they didn't do it and in some other statutes, as the Court has said, can be privately enforceable by implication."
2018.18-459,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2322.14,2324.73,But they did do it with a number of provisions.
2018.18-459,2,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,2327.91,2331.54,"Back in 1933 and 1934, but -- but -- and I think that this --"
2018.18-459,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2331.54,2333.59,So they forgot by 1968?
2018.18-459,2,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,2333.59,2334.35,"No, Your Honor."
2018.18-459,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2359.09,2387.355,"To what extent should we be -- take cognizance of the possibility that a lot of lower courts, having created this private right of action -- I -- I don't mean to say that pejoratively, of course -- then, in order to counter what they perceive as abuses, ratchet up the mens rea to scienter? We have some indication before us that a lot of these cases are filed, class actions, and then immediately dropped as soon as maybe the lawyers get their fees."
2018.18-459,2,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,2400.675,2406.865,"Well, Justice Gorsuch, to be absolutely clear, the lower courts are not ratcheting up the mens rea to prevent abuse. But --"
2018.18-459,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2406.865,2409.065,"How many proxy statements -- sorry, continue."
2018.18-459,2,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,2409.065,2427.785,"I was just going to say, if you -- if you look at our brief in opposition, we went through the lower court cases and showed that these were cases that -- that arose under the second clause of 14(e) and were premised not on negligence but on scienter-based allegations. And in response, my very able friend, in his reply, didn't take issue empirically with our description of those cases."
2018.18-459,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2435.07,2436.9,"Yeah, I wondered how many --"
2018.18-459,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2436.9,2439.57,But you -- you cited -- you cited Aaron.
2018.18-459,2,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,2448.86,2458.395,"There -- there is not, Justice Ginsburg, but to be very clear, at the time of the Williams Act in 1968, courts said that 17(a) was privately enforceable."
2018.18-459,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2472.12,2480.82,"The -- the whole thing is kind of a time travel argument, oh, Congress would have thought in 1968 that courts create implied causes of action."
2018.18-459,2,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,2495.81,2496.08,"Yeah, well, I --"
2018.18-459,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2496.08,2496.99,-- at least as I see it.
2018.18-459,2,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,2496.99,2500.03,-- I -- I want to be extremely clear about this because I think it's very important.
2018.18-459,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2505.63,2508.46,"The ""patterned after"" argument is -- is that, isn't it?"
2018.18-459,2,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,2508.46,2508.53,No.
2018.18-459,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2512.35,2515.27,"It's a -- it's a -- well, why isn't it -- tell me why it's not a subcategory of the --"
2018.18-459,2,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,2515.27,2515.78,Sure.
2018.18-459,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2515.78,2517.475,-- larger time travel argument?
2018.18-459,2,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,2517.475,2536.79,"The -- the time travel argument says that we -- we have lots of statutes that were passed during, you know, the battled heyday of the implied rights jurisprudence, and so we assume that Congress knew that they could just say whatever they wanted, courts would take all of these statutes and somehow on their own differentiate between ones that really deserved a private right and ones that didn't. That is not our argument."
2018.18-459,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2563.695,2572.51,"So, in your perfect storm, Mr. Geyser, you have the 14(e), 14(a) analogy, you have the replication of 10b-5 language."
2018.18-459,2,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,2575.865,2578.08,"I -- I think there is, Justice Kagan."
2018.18-459,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2600.79,2601.25,"Well, but the --"
2018.18-459,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2601.25,2601.34,The --
2018.18-459,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2601.34,2613.625,"-- the lower courts, it seems to me, is readily explainable by the fact that they were following what we had said and then were to so categorically reject later in the subsequent right-of-action cases."
2018.18-459,2,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,2613.625,2630.32,"Well, Mr. Chief Justice, that didn't happen in the context of 17(a), where courts used to say, employing the Borak methodology, that this is privately enforceable, and they said, uh-oh, under Sandoval, now it's not. But 14(e) stands on entirely different footing because of the text used, and it's not just the 50-year history."
2018.18-459,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2632.37,2634.63,This is all true in Central Bank as well.
2018.18-459,2,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,2645.12,2648.29,"And -- and, Justice Kavanaugh, if that's all we had, we -- we'd probably lose this case."
2018.18-459,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2699.78,2706.76,"Well, the Judge Friendly dissent -- opinion was relied on by a dissent in a subsequent case in that -- rejecting that approach --"
2018.18-459,2,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,2706.76,2708.81,"Well, but, again, though, if the question is what --"
2018.18-459,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2708.81,2709.975,-- by Justice Stevens' dissent.
2018.18-459,2,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,2709.975,2717.52,"But, again, we're -- we're -- we're -- we're focusing on what Congress was thinking when they were looking at -- at how the courts had treated these statutes."
2018.18-459,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2732.18,2735.35,But in Piper -- I'm just not going to let that go for -- respectfully.
2018.18-459,2,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,2741.92,2742.17,Well --
2018.18-459,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2742.17,2743.13,-- that mode of analysis.
2018.18-459,2,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,2743.13,2746.04,"-- to be very clear, though, there -- there were two issues in Piper."
2018.18-459,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2747.78,2748.055,Uh-huh.
2018.18-459,2,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,2748.055,2752.2,The issue that was decided is whether a tender offeror has a private right of action.
2018.18-459,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2786.23,2791.235,"Can I stop you right there? The Court left open the question, whereas you're saying they assumed the answer?"
2018.18-459,2,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,2791.235,2814.73,"I'm saying that their response to the dissent's accusation that they were undermining the practical enforcement of the statute makes very little sense unless they thought that it would be privately enforceable. But, again, we don't even need that. When you fast-forward to 1985 and Schreiber, at that point, this is apparently such a settled question the Court doesn't even flag for the lower courts don't misread our opinion and think that we're embracing this right of action."
2018.18-459,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2862.68,2865.91,"They -- they said it wasn't supposed to be read in either direction, correct?"
2018.18-459,2,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,2865.91,2868.92,"No, that was the -- no -- no, Justice Kavanaugh."
2018.18-459,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2874.815,2875.02,Yeah.
2018.18-459,2,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,2875.02,2883.6,"-- in our favor. Now, in the PSLRA in 1995, Congress went ahead and they didn't just add pleading standards; it's a very general thing to all the private rights."
2018.18-459,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2941.57,2944.12,"Well, they had no choice in the Ninth Circuit, right?"
2018.18-459,2,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,2944.12,2961.935,"No, Mr. Chief Justice. I'm not aware of any Ninth Circuit decision that looked at whether this is privately enforceable under the Court's modern scheme. I submit if the Ninth Circuit had done that, they would be -- they would be making the points that we made today, and I believe they'd reach the same result. But that is an issue that's open to my friends in the Ninth Circuit."
2018.18-459,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2978.31,2982.205,"Well, circuit -- circuit authority is -- is binding until it's overturned, right?"
2018.18-459,2,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,2982.205,2983.4,"I'm sorry, Justice?"
2018.18-459,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2983.4,2985.68,Circuit authority is binding until it's overturned.
2018.18-459,2,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,2992.985,3001.89,"Well, no, actually, in -- in the Ninth Circuit, and the Ninth Circuit has a very aggressive rule on this, is that if there is intervening Supreme Court authority that takes the legs out from under a case --"
2018.18-459,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3001.89,3004.95,"Sure, but it has to be argued and it has to be so held."
2018.18-459,2,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,3007.27,3011.22,"Well, but my very point that -- that's exactly my point, though."
2018.18-459,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3013.53,3015.53,"They could have argued it, fair, I understand that point."
2018.18-459,2,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,3018.8,3020.04,"Oh, then I -- then I misspoke."
2018.18-459,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3020.04,3020.27,Okay.
2018.18-459,2,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,3020.27,3021.4,There was precedent on this point.
2018.18-459,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3021.4,3021.55,All right.
2018.18-459,2,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,3021.55,3026.94,My point is that there was nothing that prevented the Petitioners even at the panel stage from raising this argument.
2018.18-459,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3026.94,3036.155,"What about Central Bank? I mean, one response could be don't repeat that again, but do you have any other response to their -- their raising of Central Bank?"
2018.18-459,2,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,3036.155,3054.4,"Well, I -- I think that -- I think, though, the primary response you've already said is well -- is better than I could. I don't think just the fact that the Court can do something means that it's a prudent exercise of its power, especially in a context where you have 50 years of unbroken authority and three amendments where Congress decided not to disturb that authority."
2018.18-459,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3054.4,3063.98,"Well, in terms of the prudential approach, though, the consequence of this is going to be, with respect to the private right of action, setting the standard for that, a bit of a waste of time."
2018.18-459,2,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,3072.94,3084.22,"Well, I -- I do think, Mr. Chief Justice, just as in Schreiber, let's say you think this isn't privately enforceable, deciding that this is a negligence standard still has effect because the SEC can still bring those actions."
2018.18-459,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3084.8,3086.05,"Well, sure, I understand that."
2018.18-459,2,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,3090.65,3111.555,"No -- well, they are. And we pointed out in our brief in opposition that this wasn't a good vehicle to take if the Petitioners are really genuinely serious that this private right that's existed for half a century suddenly doesn't exist when they can't cite a single case that actually holds that. And to -- and as a matter of simple prudence, I think it would make far more sense for the Court to flag that this is an open question or something at least courts might think about."
2018.18-459,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3139.78,3144.34,Your answer to Central Bank is just that it was wrong and we shouldn't do it again? Is that it?
2018.18-459,2,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,3144.34,3152.47,"Well, it's -- it's that, and I think we have one distinguishing feature, and -- and I hope I'm not misstating the lower proceedings in Central Bank."
2018.18-459,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3206.01,3230.1,"Do you -- I'm sorry, but do you think that if the -- Congress's usual tools of congressional intent were set forth today and we would say, well, if we apply those usual tools, we think Congress intended there to be a private action, but they didn't say that, do you think we might even in that situation say, well, we think there's a private right of action because Congress wanted to leave it to us to make that decision?"
2018.18-459,2,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,3230.1,3235.285,I -- I think that today this would be a far harder case for us and one we'd probably lose.
2018.18-459,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3251.62,3255.18,What do you do with Ms. Ratner's distinction of Cannon?
2018.18-459,2,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,3255.18,3260.145,The -- I -- I'm trying to remember exactly which -- which part of it. I'm sorry.
2018.18-459,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3260.145,3265.25,"Well, the fact that it was more specific in terms of rights-creating obligation than the statute here."
2018.18-459,2,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,3274.915,3287.325,"I -- I don't think those distinctions drove the analysis in Cannon. Cannon did not say because there is this hint of right-creating language, therefore, it's privately enforceable. It predominantly looked to say that Title IX was modeled after Title VI."
2018.18-459,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3296.27,3299.04,"And that's the way Sandoval looked at Cannon, isn't that right?"
2018.18-459,2,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,3299.04,3299.81,"Exactly, exactly."
2018.18-459,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3355.35,3373.885,"In terms of proscribing the behavior that you're concerned about, do you think in -- how would you assess SEC enforcement alone of a negligence standard versus SEC plus private enforcement of a higher mens rea standard or -- I realize that's speculation, but I'm just curious to your thoughts on that."
2018.18-459,2,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,3373.885,3384.96,"I don't think the -- well, I -- I have a few thoughts, Justice Kavanaugh. One is I don't see a textual hook in the statute for saying that there's a different culpability standard, depending on whether it's the government as a plaintiff or a private --"
2018.18-459,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3384.96,3417.62,"No, I was asking a different question. In other words, the level for the people who are regulated, if they know they're on the hook at least to the SEC for negligence, okay, that's going to scare them into certain protections, versus if the -- if the standard's higher, so they're not going to be on the hook for just negligence, but they could be enforced -- again, it could be enforced by both the SEC and private, what -- which do you think has a greater enforcement effect? And I realize it's speculation, but just your experience, I'm curious to your thoughts."
2018.18-459,2,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,3417.62,3439.72,"I think it is -- it is very difficult to predict other than knowing that the SEC with their limited resources, as they made -- as they made the point in the Piper amicus brief, and I realize some decades have gone by, but I don't think the SEC's -- the constraints on their resources have changed much. I think that someone looking, knowing that they only faced government enforcement, is very unlikely to be as concerned about honoring the full and fair disclosure."
2018.18-459,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3439.72,3442.265,"Do you -- are you sure about that? I mean, that seems --"
2018.18-459,2,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,3442.265,3444.89,"I -- I -- I'm not, because I don't -- I'm trying to predict the --"
2018.18-459,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3444.89,3452.24,It seems like someone faced with the SEC enforcing a negligence standard is going to be very concerned about their actions.
2018.18-459,2,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,3452.24,3455.64,"If, in fact, the SEC has the resources available to go after them --"
2018.18-459,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3455.64,3459.535,"Well, they must think they do, right, because they say there is no private right of action?"
2018.18-459,2,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,3459.535,3465.09,"Well, they do, Your Honor, but I -- I took their brief on that point to be -- to be fairly understated."
2018.18-459,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3479.475,3493.38,"This -- this Court, Mr. Geyser, has sometimes indicated real concern with abuse of private suits and particularly with the opportunity for strike litigation. What -- what -- what's the -- what -- do you have an answer to that?"
2018.18-459,2,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,3493.38,3494.75,"I -- I -- I do, Your Honor."
2018.18-459,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3495.385,3495.84,Sure.
2018.18-459,2,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,3495.84,3496.46,Thank you.
2018.18-459,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3533.205,3536.61,"Thank you, counsel. Three minutes, Mr. Garre."
2018.18-459,3,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3536.61,3544.92,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Fundamentally, the threshold question in this case is about the role of federal courts when it comes to creating implied private rights."
2018.18-459,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3633.59,3635.95,I'm rather curious. You may know the answer to this.
2018.18-459,3,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3647.98,3648.96,So I can tell --
2018.18-459,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3648.96,3649.65,You can tell me?
2018.18-459,3,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3649.65,3650.49,I can tell you.
2018.18-459,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3650.49,3650.96,Good.
2018.18-459,3,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3650.96,3666.54,"From 2013 to 2015, there were 725 transactions involving U.S. public companies; 118 used tender offers; 507 used proxy solicitations. And, of course, 14(a) isn't just limited to proxy solicitations used for acquiring companies."
2018.18-459,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3666.54,3666.86,And how many --
2018.18-459,3,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3666.86,3668.68,It's proxy solicitations generally.
2018.18-459,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3668.68,3668.74,Yeah.
2018.18-459,3,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3670.49,3671.66,So our understanding is about --
2018.18-459,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3671.66,3673.535,Millions or thousands or what?
2018.18-459,3,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3673.535,3675.505,Of just proxy solicitations?
2018.18-459,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3675.505,3675.8,Yeah.
2018.18-459,3,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3675.8,3677.73,It's -- it's broader because -- I don't have a statistic on that.
2018.18-459,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3677.73,3679.585,I know it's broader. Do you have a guess?
2018.18-459,3,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3679.585,3680.2,"I don't, Your Honor."
2018.18-459,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3680.2,3680.81,I won't hold you to it. (Laughter.)
2018.18-459,3,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3680.81,3681.76,I'm not -- I'm not going to guess.
2018.18-459,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3683.01,3683.63,"I mean, obviously, my --"
2018.18-459,3,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3683.63,3684.17,It's more than 725.
2018.18-459,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3684.17,3685.37,-- question is related to staff.
2018.18-459,3,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3685.37,3685.68,Yes.
2018.18-459,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3685.68,3689.98,"I mean, it's one thing if it's tens of thousands --"
2018.18-459,3,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3689.98,3690.07,Right.
2018.18-459,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3690.07,3698.14,"-- which suddenly you're going to ask the SEC to go and look at, or whether you're talking about 50, in which case I guess they could do it."
2018.18-459,3,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3698.14,3698.84,No one is question --
2018.18-459,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3698.84,3705.145,They say they can do it on this one if we keep it to tender offers. I don't know what happens if it expands to proxies and other things.
2018.18-459,3,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3705.145,3707.81,No one has questioned the existing regime under 14(a).
2018.18-459,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3714.535,3715.38,"Thank you, counsel."
