2014.13-9972,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.087,"We'll hear argument next this morning in Case 139972, Rodriguez v. The United States."
2014.13-9972,0,56131,shannon_p_oconnor,,8.087,11.205,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2014.13-9972,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,59.536,64.504,But that remains -- that wasn't reached by the court of appeals.
2014.13-9972,0,56131,shannon_p_oconnor,,80.481,88.137,"The -- the decision of the court of appeals, Your Honor, absolutely, that was a de minimis ruling."
2014.13-9972,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,101.377,112.602,"Counsel, do you concede that this would be all right if the dog sniff took place during the traffic stop?"
2014.13-9972,0,56131,shannon_p_oconnor,,122.675,133.047,"There'd be no problem, Mr. Chief Justice, if -- if, in fact, all of that was done before the traffic ticket was written."
2014.13-9972,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,143.338,143.471,All right.
2014.13-9972,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,143.471,156.329,"Mr. O'Connor -- Mr. O'Connor, it's frequent that a policeman, when he stops somebody for a broken taillight or whatever, will conduct some other inquiries, you know, where are you going?"
2014.13-9972,0,56131,shannon_p_oconnor,,175.724,177.491,--Yes.
2014.13-9972,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,178.426,181.961,Would it be permitted if he did it after he wrote the ticket?
2014.13-9972,0,56131,shannon_p_oconnor,,181.961,188.031,"It -- at that point in time, no, he -- he would not--"
2014.13-9972,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,188.031,188.581,Is that right?
2014.13-9972,0,56131,shannon_p_oconnor,,192.417,193.567,--If assuming that--
2014.13-9972,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,193.567,196.469,"What if he's not giving a ticket, he's just going to give him a warning?"
2014.13-9972,0,56131,shannon_p_oconnor,,196.469,197.571,--When--
2014.13-9972,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,197.571,202.373,"And he says to the man, you shouldn't have done and you went a little bit over the line."
2014.13-9972,0,56131,shannon_p_oconnor,,209.576,213.08,"--Yes, Your Honor, that would -- that would."
2014.13-9972,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,216.382,217.632,So--
2014.13-9972,0,56131,shannon_p_oconnor,,217.632,225.402,"All -- all of those questions would be -- once the stop is finished, then he should be allowed to go no matter what the question was."
2014.13-9972,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,225.402,239.911,"Is it -- is it your argument that -- that as soon as all of the steps that must be taken in connection with the traffic stop are completed, then the the stop must end?"
2014.13-9972,0,56131,shannon_p_oconnor,,257.456,259.456,"Your Honor, it is the formal act."
2014.13-9972,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,268.828,269.878,Yes.
2014.13-9972,0,56131,shannon_p_oconnor,,304.365,307.55,--If it is the completion of the--
2014.13-9972,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,307.55,312.021,"He says, I've finished writing the ticket, I've folded my notebook, I'm going to give you this ticket."
2014.13-9972,0,56131,shannon_p_oconnor,,320.894,325.512,"--If it is the end of the traffic stop, it is not."
2014.13-9972,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,325.512,327.198,But first of all--
2014.13-9972,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,327.198,328.898,--But that's what he was asking.
2014.13-9972,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,328.898,333.618,"--these are hypotheticals that have a wrong presumption, okay?"
2014.13-9972,0,56131,shannon_p_oconnor,,339.688,340.272,"Yes, Your Honor."
2014.13-9972,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,340.655,355.096,"And those include checking for warrants, checking for tickets on the car, checking identity, asking questions about that, and generally with identity it also has to do with where are you going and where are you coming from."
2014.13-9972,0,56131,shannon_p_oconnor,,356.081,356.698,"Yes, Your Honor."
2014.13-9972,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,356.698,358.214,And conducting a dog sniff.
2014.13-9972,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,359.414,360.066,I'm sorry?
2014.13-9972,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,360.066,361.516,Justice Sotomayor.
2014.13-9972,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,361.516,362.935,I didn't hear that.
2014.13-9972,0,56131,shannon_p_oconnor,,378.378,380.829,"Yes, Your Honor, that is exactly right."
2014.13-9972,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,380.829,391.451,"Yes, but you've tied it to just writing it handing over the ticket, but or you're not even doing that, you're -- you're saying just writing the ticket, which is crazy."
2014.13-9972,0,56131,shannon_p_oconnor,,391.451,396.855,"If, in fact, that's -- that's the impression that I gave, that that is wrong."
2014.13-9972,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,417.185,437.349,"Justice Sotomayor's question assumes, and you apparently embrace the assumption, that checking on whether you have a private -- a proper license, checking whether the car is stolen, all of these things are embraced within the mission when the only basis for the stop is you have a broken taillight."
2014.13-9972,0,56131,shannon_p_oconnor,,441.384,446.104,"Those are things, Your Honor, that have been accepted as part of--"
2014.13-9972,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,446.104,446.571,I see.
2014.13-9972,0,56131,shannon_p_oconnor,,446.571,447.487,--the process.
2014.13-9972,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,447.487,450.439,"Well, then maybe dog sniffing should be too, right?"
2014.13-9972,0,56131,shannon_p_oconnor,,458.459,459.545,Before the completion of the mission.
2014.13-9972,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,459.545,469.916,"--Which includes not just a broken taillight, but also inquiring into your license, inquiring into prior arrests?"
2014.13-9972,0,56131,shannon_p_oconnor,,471.518,472.852,"Yes, Your Honor, it is."
2014.13-9972,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,472.852,476.487,Why don't you make the dog sniff part of the mission and that will solve the problem?
2014.13-9972,0,56131,shannon_p_oconnor,,476.487,477.404,Well--
2014.13-9972,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,477.404,487.86,"Part of the mission where you stop somebody is not just the broken taillight, but, you know, whether the car is stolen, whether you have drugs on the car, so let's bring in a dog and do the car sniff."
2014.13-9972,0,56131,shannon_p_oconnor,,495.366,502.62,"--You expand the mission, Your Honor, for everything that comes within the tasks that are part of the traffic stop."
2014.13-9972,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,504.02,506.338,It's a broken taillight.
2014.13-9972,0,56131,shannon_p_oconnor,,519.315,526.485,--You do if it's done before the -- the traffic stop is done.
2014.13-9972,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,528.754,534.507,"But you see the problem is how do you define the traffic stop, and you've already indicated the traffic stop can include some of the questioning."
2014.13-9972,0,56131,shannon_p_oconnor,,546.193,548.712,"--Well, the dog sniff--"
2014.13-9972,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,548.712,549.814,It's a policy question.
2014.13-9972,0,56131,shannon_p_oconnor,,557.501,563.404,"--As a policy question, if you could end it with the handing of the ticket, that would be acceptable."
2014.13-9972,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,575.462,593.924,"If we hold that it's okay to have a dog sniff so long as it's before the ticket is issued, then every police officer other than those who are uninformed or incompetent will delay the handing over of the ticket until the dog sniff is completed."
2014.13-9972,0,56131,shannon_p_oconnor,,596.024,597.309,--Well--
2014.13-9972,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,597.309,600.261,"I mean, it's great for your client, but what does it do for the law?"
2014.13-9972,0,56131,shannon_p_oconnor,,600.261,612.051,"--Your Honor, I think what it does first, if you have officers that -- that wait, if that's the -- if that's the question, Your Honor, if they wait for the pocket, put the ticket in the pocket for the dog--"
2014.13-9972,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,612.051,619.905,"If we adopt a formal rule, that's one of -- one of the options, a formal rule, once you hand over the ticket, that's it, you can't do anything more."
2014.13-9972,0,56131,shannon_p_oconnor,,625.293,625.626,--Yes.
2014.13-9972,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,625.976,626.959,That is your argument.
2014.13-9972,0,56131,shannon_p_oconnor,,626.959,627.695,Yes.
2014.13-9972,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,627.695,629.028,Then what does it accomplish?
2014.13-9972,0,56131,shannon_p_oconnor,,629.028,634.33,What it accomplishes is the -- is the enforcement of the Fourth Amendment.
2014.13-9972,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,640.5,654.326,"But the question is, is this -- is this very -- the easiest thing to get around by simply saying, would the sequence in which I will do this, I won't think of issuing the ticket until I've had the dog sniff?"
2014.13-9972,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,667.084,667.084,Yes.
2014.13-9972,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,667.084,675.188,"Well, then the police can just say, I'm going to defer that a few minutes until the dog sniff occurs."
2014.13-9972,0,56131,shannon_p_oconnor,,706.142,710.861,"Your Honor, it is -- it is okay when the traffic stop is done."
2014.13-9972,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,714.995,716.997,You can't possibly mean that.
2014.13-9972,0,56131,shannon_p_oconnor,,716.997,718.464,"--Oh, yes, sir, I do."
2014.13-9972,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,718.464,721.901,"The stopping officer says, I'm done, I got my ticket here."
2014.13-9972,0,56131,shannon_p_oconnor,,740.594,749.364,"Well, again, if I -- if -- the formal -- the formal handing of the ticket is not the end, in your example, Your Honor?"
2014.13-9972,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,749.364,750.966,"In my example, he hasn't turned over the ticket yet."
2014.13-9972,0,56131,shannon_p_oconnor,,758.47,760.072,"No, the traffic stop is done."
2014.13-9972,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,764.54,765.89,He has not handed the ticket over.
2014.13-9972,0,56131,shannon_p_oconnor,,767.356,771.96,--And the reason that he has kept the ticket is for the dog to come.
2014.13-9972,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,771.96,772.71,Yeah.
2014.13-9972,0,56131,shannon_p_oconnor,,772.71,776.928,And -- but that is past the -- that is past the traffic stop.
2014.13-9972,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,778.697,780.98,So you're not -- you're not applying a formal test.
2014.13-9972,0,56131,shannon_p_oconnor,,789.32,790.253,"--No, that's -- no."
2014.13-9972,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,790.253,791.105,All right.
2014.13-9972,0,56131,shannon_p_oconnor,,791.105,791.988,The formal test--
2014.13-9972,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,791.988,792.171,So what is the test?
2014.13-9972,0,56131,shannon_p_oconnor,,792.171,793.288,--The formal test--
2014.13-9972,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,793.288,795.956,How long a normal traffic stop would take?
2014.13-9972,0,56131,shannon_p_oconnor,,795.956,800.758,"--The formal test no, your Honor, that would not be the case at all."
2014.13-9972,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,815.601,819.319,"What if the officer says, I need to think about this for a while?"
2014.13-9972,0,56131,shannon_p_oconnor,,819.319,819.619,Who?
2014.13-9972,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,819.619,820.119,"What if the officer says -- says, I need to think about this for a while?"
2014.13-9972,0,56131,shannon_p_oconnor,,820.119,820.819,"Well, whose--"
2014.13-9972,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,820.819,822.605,"The officer says, I need to think about this for a while."
2014.13-9972,0,56131,shannon_p_oconnor,,843.168,845.868,"--No, your Honor, that's -- that's not okay at all."
2014.13-9972,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,885.861,887.947,"Gee, we ponder all the time, and we think we're being diligent."
2014.13-9972,0,56131,shannon_p_oconnor,,890.982,896.885,"--Unless the pondering is to avoid the diligence, and that would be the question."
2014.13-9972,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,912.745,913.762,"You know, it really looks--"
2014.13-9972,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,913.762,915.028,"You may have answered this already, but I'm not sure."
2014.13-9972,0,56131,shannon_p_oconnor,,925.017,930.988,"I've had -- I've had friends that say -- say the same thing, Mr. Chief Justice."
2014.13-9972,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,931.954,935.489,What about the registration is pertinent to the traffic stop?
2014.13-9972,0,56131,shannon_p_oconnor,,935.489,941.143,"Well, what's pertinent about it is, part of the traffic stop is the vehicle itself as well."
2014.13-9972,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,950.664,951.764,If you saw -- if you saw--
2014.13-9972,0,56131,shannon_p_oconnor,,951.764,952.515,--task towards the offense.
2014.13-9972,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,952.515,955.466,"--If you saw the car swerve, what does that have to do with the car?"
2014.13-9972,0,56131,shannon_p_oconnor,,960.787,968.474,"What you can do -- no, Your Honor, I think -- Mr. Chief Justice, I think you do."
2014.13-9972,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1013.752,1022.191,"Mr. O'Connor, is this particular traffic violation, was that an arrestable offense?"
2014.13-9972,0,56131,shannon_p_oconnor,,1022.191,1023.875,No.
2014.13-9972,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1027.493,1027.86,It was not.
2014.13-9972,0,56131,shannon_p_oconnor,,1027.86,1030.029,It's a traffic infraction.
2014.13-9972,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1030.029,1040.485,"Because if it was an arrestable offense, they could arrest the driver and then impound the car and do an inventory search."
2014.13-9972,0,56131,shannon_p_oconnor,,1040.485,1045.888,"If it was an arrestable offense, yes, Your Honor, I think that's correct."
2014.13-9972,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1045.888,1048.673,But you say it's not an arrestable offense.
2014.13-9972,0,56131,shannon_p_oconnor,,1048.673,1049.406,It is not.
2014.13-9972,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1102.972,1105.424,--Can I just ask you a simple question?
2014.13-9972,0,56131,shannon_p_oconnor,,1118.132,1118.865,Correct.
2014.13-9972,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1118.865,1125.921,You said in your brief: A dog sniff is not a police entitlement to which the Fourth Amendment limits must bend.
2014.13-9972,0,56131,shannon_p_oconnor,,1134.093,1135.96,I think that the--
2014.13-9972,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1135.96,1136.343,All right.
2014.13-9972,0,56131,shannon_p_oconnor,,1140.595,1148.349,"--The line is when -- I can -- I can start off with -- with, perhaps, the Johnson case again."
2014.13-9972,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1153.253,1155.219,Why don't you just do a simple test?
2014.13-9972,0,56131,shannon_p_oconnor,,1155.219,1156.538,--I can give you--
2014.13-9972,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1156.538,1168.762,"If you're going to do a -- if you're going to do a stop, you can't reasonably extend or pass the time it takes to deal with a ticket, correct?"
