1971.50_orig,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,33.223,"-- number 50 original, State of Vermont against the State of New York and others?"
1971.50_orig,0,24469,fred_i_parker,,35.356,41.858,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1971.50_orig,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,163.353,174.661,"Would you give me, so I am going to get at least little better, and more complete picture of the geography, that the total size of Lake Champlain?"
1971.50_orig,0,24469,fred_i_parker,,181.081,214.972,"Yes Your Honor it -- the length is 107 miles long, 12 miles at its widest part which is about the midpoint of that 107-mile stretch and it narrows down in the Southerly portion at the place, we're describing to about a mile and it narrows down in the Northerly portion where it joins the -- it crosses the Canadian boarder to about a mile and I would say that it fairly regularly narrows."
1971.50_orig,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,220.603,227.634,I recall that driving in that part of the country it has the characteristics of a river rather than a lake.
1971.50_orig,0,24469,fred_i_parker,,237.314,258.767,The evidence that was presented in the interstate conference that was held on this matter indicated that the sludge bed itself was approximately 300 acres and that the water that it then affected was about 1600 acres.
1971.50_orig,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,367.315,370.457,"The operation is now finished, isn't it?"
1971.50_orig,0,24469,fred_i_parker,,372.45,373.714,"Yes Your Honor, it has."
1971.50_orig,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,387.024,390.834,A new plant has been built few miles away?
1971.50_orig,0,24469,fred_i_parker,,390.834,392.373,That's correct.
1971.50_orig,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,392.373,394.365,"This is on the lake, the new plant?"
1971.50_orig,0,24469,fred_i_parker,,394.365,398.347,New plant is on the lake and it contains a treatment system.
1971.50_orig,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,409.31,413.482,"As of now, there is no complaint against the operations of the new plant?"
1971.50_orig,0,24469,fred_i_parker,,413.482,416.463,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1971.50_orig,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,417.804,421.725,Is the new plant discharging anything into the lake?
1971.50_orig,0,24469,fred_i_parker,,421.725,426.731,"Yes, it discharges a treated effluent from the plant."
1971.50_orig,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,569.607,574.323,Is that admitted Mr. Parker?
1971.50_orig,0,24469,fred_i_parker,,574.323,576.067,It's admitted in part and denied in part.
1971.50_orig,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,591.407,598.506,But was there some action taken with the (Inaudible) recently which produced results?
1971.50_orig,0,24469,fred_i_parker,,598.506,616.318,"As I understand it, the studies of the defendants in this case indicate that the conditions in that area have improved and our own studies indicate that the conditions have improved greatly, since the discharge is ceased."
1971.50_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,655.357,670.369,"Mr. Parker, why can't the State of Vermont get relieved against International Paper, putting to one side the question of State of New York, in our own courts but the type of wrong that you've just described?"
1971.50_orig,0,24469,fred_i_parker,,670.369,691.56,"If it turns out in the proof of this case that the remedy, the best remedy is removal of the sludge, then of course we may end up with incomplete relief because New York is now taking the position that to remove the sludge would constitute a threat to the ecology of the lake."
1971.50_orig,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,704.239,710.462,"Under the Federal Act, you got as far as the Attorney General?"
1971.50_orig,0,24469,fred_i_parker,,710.462,712.196,"No, we didn't get that far."
1971.50_orig,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,712.196,713.399,How far did you get?
1971.50_orig,0,24469,fred_i_parker,,713.399,745.105,"We got through two conferences and a letter from the Secretary of the Interior suggesting action on the part of State of New York, then the, then Secretary of Interior Hickel left and the powers of the Interior were transferred to EPA and we have requested action from EPA, but their response has been negative at this point."
1971.50_orig,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,748.042,752.907,They declined to Act or just not answer to your inquiry?
1971.50_orig,0,24469,fred_i_parker,,752.907,775.863,"We invited them to join this suit and they said, they are very concerned about it, but didn't care to act at this point and I understand that they are -- attached to the latest brief of the State of New York is a indication that the State has corresponded with EPA indicating that their recent study show that nothing further should be done."
1971.50_orig,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,775.863,794.904,"As I read the Section 10, of the Federal Act, Sub division (g), EPA may request the Attorney General to bring a suit on behalf of United States to secure the bed?"
1971.50_orig,0,24469,fred_i_parker,,794.904,795.72,That's correct John.
1971.50_orig,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,796.319,804.781,There is no edit -- that hasn't been changed to a must or Its pretty discretionary?
1971.50_orig,0,24469,fred_i_parker,,804.781,809.992,"That's right, that's the frustrating business of attempting to deal through these conferences with Federal Government."
1971.50_orig,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,826.136,836.5,"In this respect, Mr. Parker, enlighten me, what does Vermont feel that New York should do that it hasn't done at this point?"
1971.50_orig,0,24469,fred_i_parker,,836.5,847.449,We feel that that sludge either should be removed from the water or should be covered over so that the it doesn't affect the water quality in the future.
1971.50_orig,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,847.449,858.447,"Covering over on the entire 300 acres, does the record show what kind of coverage would be required to be adequate?"
1971.50_orig,0,24469,fred_i_parker,,858.447,870.785,"I am not sure that record shows this, but the Federal conferences that were held in this case, the Corp of Engineers did the study which suggested that a sand cover could be laid over sludge."
1971.50_orig,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,879.088,901.096,That's why I have put that question if you -- I don't know whether it's six inches or six feet of coverage that would be requiring but anything you put in would be a further interference with navigation unless the interference with navigation is in such a small part that you can have a dredging operation first?
1971.50_orig,0,24469,fred_i_parker,,901.096,915.849,"I think that's one possibility is accommodation of the two remedies to dredge some and to cover some, but I think that if this Court does take jurisdiction, also it would be one of the problems that we would be trying to workout in trying this case."
1971.50_orig,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,915.849,917.909,"Let's suspend it, until after lunch."
1971.50_orig,0,24469,fred_i_parker,,926.508,931.091,"Mr. Chief Justice, may I please the Court."
1971.50_orig,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1057.791,1067.294,"Just before you move to that, do I understand that the sludge bed is on the bottom of the lake on the New York side of the boundary?"
1971.50_orig,0,24469,fred_i_parker,,1067.294,1070.517,"It is now on both sides of the boundary, Your Honor."
1971.50_orig,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1078.788,1094.996,"And is something in the record to the effect that it's been building up over many years and there are other contributors to it in addition to many other -- many other contributors in addition to the paper company, this paper company?"
1971.50_orig,0,24469,fred_i_parker,,1100.69,1107.673,"I don't think that we'll be able to prove that they are the sole cause, but they're certainly the major contributor to it and I think we can prove that."
1971.50_orig,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1122.533,1125.358,"And this is way down to the Southern tip of the Lake, is it?"
1971.50_orig,0,24469,fred_i_parker,,1125.358,1125.948,That's right.
1971.50_orig,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1125.948,1128.62,Down around Port Henry.
1971.50_orig,0,24469,fred_i_parker,,1128.62,1133.127,South of their -- at Ticonderoga.
1971.50_orig,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1133.127,1137.238,Ticonderoga is not -- Is Ticonderoga on the lake?
1971.50_orig,0,24469,fred_i_parker,,1137.238,1153.975,Its just pass the lake and yes the city -- the Ticonderoga boundary does have a plant along the lake but the city of Ticonderoga and the place where the mill is on Ticonderoga creek which is a tributary running into lake Champlain.
1971.50_orig,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1153.975,1155.536,How far from the lake?
1971.50_orig,0,24469,fred_i_parker,,1155.536,1159.36,About a mile I believe.
1971.50_orig,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1159.36,1162.855,Thank you.
1971.50_orig,0,24469,fred_i_parker,,1162.855,1181.352,As we see it the major legal issues whether jurisdiction is exclusive in this Court and contributing to that issue is whether we have an alternative forum or whether the principles of Ohio just wind out (Inaudible).
1971.50_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1250.038,1253.318,What is your cause of action against New York?
1971.50_orig,0,24469,fred_i_parker,,1253.318,1255.911,"Maintenance for public nuisance, Your Honor."
1971.50_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1255.911,1262.509,You are saying New York is doing that by letting the sludge to accumulate on its lake part?
1971.50_orig,0,24469,fred_i_parker,,1262.509,1265.217,"That's correct, on its property."
1971.50_orig,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1265.217,1268.483,That's a federal common law nuisance?
1971.50_orig,0,24469,fred_i_parker,,1268.483,1278.039,"Yes, if we litigate before this Court, it'll be a question of federal common law and that's the position that we took in the recently submitted memorandum."
1971.50_orig,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1278.039,1282.305,Could you get into a Federal District Court?
1971.50_orig,0,24469,fred_i_parker,,1282.305,1307.101,"I don't think we can because the state of Vermont is not a citizen for purposes of this diversity and both the 28 U.S. Code, Section 1251 provides that this forum is the exclusive forum where we can litigate state versus state."
1971.50_orig,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1313.56,1325.892,"If this is a federal, we just assume for purposes of argument that it is a federal common law nuisance, can you litigate in a District Court?"
1971.50_orig,0,24469,fred_i_parker,,1325.892,1334.873,I don't think -- as I understand the law the District Court does not have jurisdiction to permit a suit between states.
1971.50_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1334.873,1341.719,"But you have got two suits here, you got one against International Paper Company and one against the State, I mean at least you have got two parties?"
1971.50_orig,0,24469,fred_i_parker,,1341.719,1342.776,"Yes, Your Honor."
1971.50_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1344.06,1349.0,We already (Inaudible) that you could litigate against the International Paper Company in the District Court?
1971.50_orig,0,24469,fred_i_parker,,1349.0,1350.003,"Yes, Your Honor we could."
1971.50_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1350.003,1354.413,And that federal law would control it?
1971.50_orig,0,24469,fred_i_parker,,1354.413,1357.877,I think that that's a problem.
1971.50_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1375.071,1384.159,"But the (Inaudible) hasn't named New York at all and you sued them in the Federal District Court, sued International Paper in the Federal District Court?"
1971.50_orig,0,24469,fred_i_parker,,1384.159,1385.068,"Yes, Your Honor."
1971.50_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1385.068,1390.479,"You would be asking for the application of the same law that you'd be asking here, correct?"
1971.50_orig,0,24469,fred_i_parker,,1390.479,1391.595,"I don't think so, Your Honor."
1971.50_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1400.7,1403.217,"Well, why is that?"
1971.50_orig,0,24469,fred_i_parker,,1403.217,1404.371,Erie railroad v. Tompkins.
1971.50_orig,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1404.371,1407.066,"There wouldn't be a diversity case, by definition."
1971.50_orig,0,24469,fred_i_parker,,1416.527,1421.26,I was just -- I think it would have to be a diversity case in order to get there and that's why we can't go there.
1971.50_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1421.26,1424.122,"Well, you would be --"
1971.50_orig,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1424.122,1437.804,"Will that be supposes that the decision of this Court, that you would -- you are governed by federal common law on this instance, we've never so held, have we?"
1971.50_orig,0,24469,fred_i_parker,,1437.804,1452.067,"In cases involving state versus other states, the Court has consistently held that these kind of cases are governed by interstate common law or federal common law of nuisance."
1971.50_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1461.617,1472.886,What would you say if you were suing International Paper alone in this Court and surely that would be a case within our jurisdiction and you were claiming that this sludge bed was nuisance.
1971.50_orig,0,24469,fred_i_parker,,1476.334,1478.234,"I would be, yes."
1971.50_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1478.234,1488.271,Why would you think that any different law would apply if you were suing in the Federal District Court which has contract jurisdiction in that kind of a case?
1971.50_orig,0,24469,fred_i_parker,,1488.271,1493.377,"Because as I understand it -- well the only way, I could understand to get into a Federal District Court --"
1971.50_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1493.377,1500.797,You are asking for a federal -- you are just suing on a federal question as a matter of a federal law?
1971.50_orig,0,24469,fred_i_parker,,1500.797,1503.558,I had never understood that to be the case.
1971.50_orig,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1503.558,1505.277,Well of course it hasn't really been decided.
1971.50_orig,0,24469,fred_i_parker,,1508.012,1509.815,"Yes, I am acquainted with it Your Honor."
1971.50_orig,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1514.393,1518.859,Well that's a state assertion?[Attempt to Laughter]
1971.50_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1518.859,1543.546,"Well, let's assume that it had been that -- let's assume that you are suing in this Court International Paper Company alone and this Court decided federal law applies and then in a identical suit on the facts between the state and another company, this suit is brought in the Federal District Court."
1971.50_orig,0,24469,fred_i_parker,,1546.513,1554.015,"I think if I were plaintiff in that suit in a federal court, I would urge that was a case, but I don't find that to be the law at this point in time."
1971.50_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1561.56,1563.029,"But they did in (Inaudible), didn't they?"
1971.50_orig,0,24469,fred_i_parker,,1563.029,1566.988,"Yes, it did and that's the only one so far as I know."
1971.50_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1566.988,1572.689,"Well, it's the only way, there isn't anything against it either, is there?"
1971.50_orig,0,24469,fred_i_parker,,1572.689,1573.951,"No, there are no holding --"
1971.50_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1573.951,1577.648,"And the only authority there is, this Pankey case?"
1971.50_orig,0,24469,fred_i_parker,,1577.648,1578.29,That's correct.
1971.50_orig,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1578.29,1582.284,What did Wyandotte had to say on this subject?
1971.50_orig,0,24469,fred_i_parker,,1582.284,1588.532,"Well as I understand Wyandotte, that case said, go back to the state court."
1971.50_orig,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1594.854,1609.482,"But perhaps I should explain them all on the basis that the Court understood, that the State of Ohio was asserting an Ohio cause of action under the Ohio nuisance law?"
1971.50_orig,0,24469,fred_i_parker,,1609.482,1615.108,"It's possibly the case and we may have that here in this case, if we have to."
1971.50_orig,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1631.856,1636.118,Thank you Mr. Parker.
1971.50_orig,1,38437,philip_weinberg,,1637.446,1641.018,Mr. Chief justice and may it please the Court.
1971.50_orig,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1679.143,1682.818,There is one very great big difference thought is there not?
1971.50_orig,1,38437,philip_weinberg,,1700.703,1704.925,Certainly is Mr. Justice Stewart and it's precisely our of point that there is no genuine controversy between the two states here.
1971.50_orig,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1704.925,1712.198,"Well that is a separate point but this -- that on its face is what differentiates this case from Wyandotte, among other?"
1971.50_orig,1,38437,philip_weinberg,,1712.198,1725.624,"That's certainly true, once we go beyond the surface representation that two states are involved in and look at the realities of the case, however that it seems to me just close or broad because was in fact, New York was injected."
1971.50_orig,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1756.416,1761.777,Except China had more authority to break international stuff?
1971.50_orig,1,38437,philip_weinberg,,1761.777,1764.188,That's certainly true Mr. Justice Marshall.
1971.50_orig,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1764.188,1782.163,"As an assumption though in what we quote that string that you agreed in Wyandotte that the state court that decided the case under the same common law of nuisance, on which our determination have relied."
1971.50_orig,1,38437,philip_weinberg,,1786.832,1797.872,"It would only be a federal common law of nuisance case under our view of the law if the state were a proper party, and if a genuine claim for relief existed as against New York."
1971.50_orig,2,43436,taggart_whipple,,2513.025,2516.193,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1971.50_orig,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2999.154,2999.847,Mr. Whipple.
1971.50_orig,2,43436,taggart_whipple,,2999.847,3000.597,Yes sir.
1971.50_orig,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3000.597,3005.817,You concede that International Papers is amenable to service of process in Vermont?
1971.50_orig,2,43436,taggart_whipple,,3005.817,3014.479,"We contend Your Honor, I was just about to get to that, that we are sueable in Vermont, we are sueable in New York, we are ready to stand sued there, there is no question about that."
1971.50_orig,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3054.505,3057.679,It's a kind of a primary jurisdiction argument or a --
1971.50_orig,2,43436,taggart_whipple,,3057.679,3058.3,"Well, I don't know."
1971.50_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3143.837,3147.869,"In terms of the equitable law, which says a state law should control --"
1971.50_orig,2,43436,taggart_whipple,,3147.869,3148.827,Yes sir.
1971.50_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3148.827,3152.706,"Let's assume you are sued in Vermont, what would be the governing law?"
1971.50_orig,2,43436,taggart_whipple,,3152.706,3154.537,I would think the State of Vermont law.
1971.50_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3155.716,3157.317,"In New York, the same?"
1971.50_orig,2,43436,taggart_whipple,,3157.317,3160.916,"I would think so, I think common law governs traditional nuisance."
1971.50_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3164.653,3166.723,What New York says that --
1971.50_orig,2,43436,taggart_whipple,,3166.723,3168.084,"Let me clarify one thing, may I?"
1971.50_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3174.347,3186.55,"Well, if you are sued, what if the -- what if under the New York law of the maintenance of the sludge bed is not a nuisance?"
1971.50_orig,2,43436,taggart_whipple,,3186.55,3197.909,"Well, I find it hard to accept that hypothesis, but I will arguendo, if we are sued in New York, I would think that the New York court would look to the Vermont law because that's the place where their injury occurred."
1971.50_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3197.909,3206.404,"Well, they are saying that the Vermont says if the injury is occurring from New York maintaining on its land this sludge bed?"
1971.50_orig,2,43436,taggart_whipple,,3206.404,3214.605,"No, but the thrust of the injury, the harm visits itself across the border in Vermont, on Vermont shores, that's where the injury occurs, I think."
1971.50_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3234.268,3243.441,"Well, you know that in some of the interstates river cases where a state sues a private company, what have been the applicable law?"
1971.50_orig,2,43436,taggart_whipple,,3243.441,3250.306,Well there is -- I am not sure what case you are suggesting to thinking of Your Honor?
1971.50_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3250.306,3266.018,"Well, in Wyoming and Colorado, when there was some litigation there about a stream and it was between the state and a private company, didn't the doctrine of equitable portion of the Federal law apply rather than what the --"
1971.50_orig,2,43436,taggart_whipple,,3266.018,3274.327,"Well, if the case is dealing with the apportionment of interstate waters and particularly with another state contact, then I think it's clear --"
1971.50_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3274.327,3275.065,No one is state contact.
1971.50_orig,2,43436,taggart_whipple,,3275.065,3277.06,Alright put that aside then.
1971.50_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3306.282,3319.188,"Would you see anything inconsistent with your position that you suggested, perhaps there might be a Federal Common-law of nuisance cause of action, but also a safe one?"
1971.50_orig,2,43436,taggart_whipple,,3319.188,3319.789,"No, I don't."
1971.50_orig,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3377.741,3381.486,Now Mr. Whipple there is a litigation (Inaudible) against your client --
1971.50_orig,2,43436,taggart_whipple,,3381.486,3382.42,Yes sir.
1971.50_orig,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3382.42,3385.24,"-- in the United States District Court for Vermont, is there?"
1971.50_orig,2,43436,taggart_whipple,,3385.24,3385.886,There is.
1971.50_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3385.886,3389.079,And Federal jurisdiction is bottomed on what?
1971.50_orig,2,43436,taggart_whipple,,3389.079,3390.057,Diversity.
1971.50_orig,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3390.057,3392.255,"Not on Federal question, on diversity?"
1971.50_orig,2,43436,taggart_whipple,,3392.255,3393.773,"I don't think it is, no Your Honor."
1971.50_orig,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3401.007,3409.064,"How far has that litigation gone, I am just curious to know whether -- how the District Court there feels about what kind of substantive law is applicable?"
1971.50_orig,2,43436,taggart_whipple,,3409.064,3411.391,The case was brought shortly after this one.
1971.50_orig,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3415.822,3418.728,"Who is John, what was he representing, the town's people or the ---?"
1971.50_orig,2,43436,taggart_whipple,,3418.728,3439.785,"John and three other plaintiffs are landowners or lessees along the eastern shore of the lake, opposite the sludge bed and the class they can contend, they represent, can I finish my sentence, consists of the class along the lake in this county, it's a class of 200, New York's brief is mistaken, he says 600."
1971.50_orig,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3449.777,3451.599,That's the propriety of the class?
1971.50_orig,2,43436,taggart_whipple,,3451.599,3454.36,"Exactly, yes, thank you."
1971.50_orig,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3454.36,3457.512,Thank you Mr. Whipple.
1971.50_orig,3,24469,fred_i_parker,,3466.496,3469.943,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1971.50_orig,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3542.849,3543.392,There would be none.
