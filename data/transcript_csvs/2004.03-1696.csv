2004.03-1696,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,0.0,8.052,We will now hear argument in Exxon Mobil against Saudi Basic Industries.
2004.03-1696,0,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,40.124,42.975,"Good morning, Justice Stevens."
2004.03-1696,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,68.731,75.297,"Well, what financial interests do your clients have to keep litigating today in another court?"
2004.03-1696,0,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,75.297,77.526,--I don't know the--
2004.03-1696,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,77.526,78.019,What's going on?
2004.03-1696,0,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,79.505,88.133,"--Well, certainly, Justice O'Connor, we've not yet recovered on our judgment and that judgment is still there."
2004.03-1696,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,157.979,161.611,But do you have a continuing case or controversy?
2004.03-1696,0,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,185.76,187.124,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2004.03-1696,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,206.359,211.56,"But if you've got all the relief to which you are entitled, that does make a case moot."
2004.03-1696,0,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,211.56,222.251,"--In terms of cases that involve injunctive relief where it is impossible for a court to give you the relief that you have... that you are seeking, that is true."
2004.03-1696,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,236.536,237.401,What relief could it give you?
2004.03-1696,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,237.401,237.855,But what for?
2004.03-1696,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,237.855,238.327,What relief?
2004.03-1696,0,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,241.365,252.344,"--Well, we think the relief that we're entitled to, in terms of this, is for the case to be remanded for the district court to resolve these issues under preclusion doctrines."
2004.03-1696,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,252.344,254.656,But what issues would... would the district court resolve?
2004.03-1696,0,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,254.656,255.938,Preclusion.
2004.03-1696,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,255.938,257.916,"Well, if you win on the preclusion--"
2004.03-1696,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,257.916,258.539,Who cares?
2004.03-1696,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,258.539,260.024,--what do you get then in substance?
2004.03-1696,0,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,260.024,265.309,We don't necessarily intend to take a... another judgment in Federal court.
2004.03-1696,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,265.309,267.083,Then what do you intend to do?
2004.03-1696,0,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,269.479,280.458,"Well, hopefully we'll win on preclusion with respect not only to this suit, the New Jersey II suit, but also the New Jersey I suit, which we say the district... or the Delaware judgment precludes."
2004.03-1696,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,280.458,281.201,"Well, I think we'd like an answer."
2004.03-1696,0,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,292.141,293.356,It is likely--
2004.03-1696,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,293.356,298.374,"Now, the one answer I heard you give, well, we're interested in preclusion to say... well, that's all historical at that point."
2004.03-1696,0,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,298.929,305.887,"--It... it is likely, Your Honor... and we have previously said... that we may very well dismiss the case of our own accord."
2004.03-1696,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,308.217,311.832,We're looking for... we're looking for something that makes the case live.
2004.03-1696,0,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,311.832,314.988,--Our claims are alive.
2004.03-1696,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,317.322,325.29,But we're... we're questioning why that is and we're asking you what relief you need to get that you wouldn't get in the hypothetical that Justice Ginsburg posed.
2004.03-1696,0,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,325.29,331.401,--We thought we would not seek further monetary relief.
2004.03-1696,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,331.401,332.061,So what--
2004.03-1696,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,332.061,335.033,Do you know how many claims in this case that... that were not in the Delaware case?
2004.03-1696,0,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,335.033,342.918,"We have affirmative defenses to the New Jersey I, but... but the claims in New Jersey II and Delaware are the same, Your Honor."
2004.03-1696,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,342.918,349.317,"Is your answer that you might want equitable relief, an injunction to continue making payments in the future, or something like that?"
2004.03-1696,0,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,349.317,350.348,"No, Your Honor."
2004.03-1696,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,353.981,362.859,You... you would be stuck anyway because you made a counterclaim and... and it would be... on which you prevailed.
2004.03-1696,0,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,388.288,389.32,"And, indeed, Your Honor."
2004.03-1696,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,397.782,399.639,So it has--
2004.03-1696,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,399.639,401.004,"--So if they do, it's not finished."
2004.03-1696,0,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,401.004,401.747,It is not finished--
2004.03-1696,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,401.747,402.385,"Yes, all right."
2004.03-1696,0,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,403.316,417.684,"--Getting back to the Rooker-Feldman issue, which is the issue on which the Court granted cert, Rooker-Feldman is a narrow, limited doctrine, but it bars only appellate review not parallel litigation in Federal district courts."
2004.03-1696,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,459.044,464.784,"Well, the problem that bothers me... and I don't know that there's an answer to it... is you have plaintiff."
2004.03-1696,0,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,512.288,513.946,"Yes, Your Honor."
2004.03-1696,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,513.946,514.4,Okay.
2004.03-1696,0,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,540.324,542.264,"No, Justice Breyer."
2004.03-1696,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,553.864,561.544,"--Mr. Coleman, would you clarify, I think, in response to Justice Breyer's inquiry?"
2004.03-1696,0,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,575.495,577.891,--Within 2 months of each other.
2004.03-1696,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,579.377,593.95,"And isn't the standard defense of the person who has started the other suit first, well, Your Honor, prior action pending, please hold the case that started second in abeyance till we get done?"
2004.03-1696,0,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,606.87,617.188,"That's... that's... Your Honor, that's our position that... concurrent jurisdiction is a separate issue from the appellate review issue that Rooker-Feldman raises."
2004.03-1696,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,679.11,694.548,"No, but the argument... it seems to me the argument is that in a de facto sense, when you try to litigate the Federal case, after losing the State case, you in effect are asking the Federal court in some sense to review what happened in the State court."
2004.03-1696,0,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,699.749,700.371,Absolutely.
2004.03-1696,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,700.371,714.982,"Because if that... if that is... if we accept that as the answer, then there's no argument for saying you should expand Rooker-Feldman to include the de facto review as opposed to the... the very strict sense of review that you're talking about."
2004.03-1696,0,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,714.982,722.207,"That is absolutely our position, Justice Souter, that preclusion addresses all of these issues."
2004.03-1696,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,722.207,723.898,"Well, but can you... can you expand on this a little?"
2004.03-1696,0,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,779.792,782.393,I don't... I don't think that that is true.
2004.03-1696,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,820.621,829.37,"Rooker-Feldman, if I understand it correctly, is a subject matter jurisdiction bar."
2004.03-1696,0,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,829.826,830.69,"Yes, Your Honor."
2004.03-1696,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,831.228,831.494,--Yes.
2004.03-1696,0,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,831.633,839.685,--it arises from a negative implication taken from section 1257 and a second negative implication from 1331.
2004.03-1696,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,839.685,859.83,"--Well, to... so if the two lawsuits, the State court suit and the Federal suit... they're proceeding concurrently or one is held in abeyance waiting the other, there is certainly subject matter jurisdiction in the Federal court of the Federal action."
2004.03-1696,0,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,859.83,860.611,Yes.
2004.03-1696,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,860.611,871.264,"To apply Rooker-Feldman in that context would say you had subject matter jurisdiction at the outset, but then you lost it somewhere down the line."
2004.03-1696,0,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,871.264,873.326,"And... and... yes, Justice Ginsburg."
2004.03-1696,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,914.936,915.225,Suppose--
2004.03-1696,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,915.225,917.082,"Mr. Coleman, can I interrupt with a question?"
2004.03-1696,0,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,917.082,917.704,Of course.
2004.03-1696,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,917.704,928.022,"Is it your position that what should have been done in this case, not in the hypothetical case, is the trial court should have just stayed the action pending the outcome of the Delaware case?"
2004.03-1696,0,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,928.022,931.078,"And, in fact, that's what the Federal district court had done, Your Honor."
2004.03-1696,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,931.078,933.223,And that's what... he did... that was correct.
2004.03-1696,0,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,933.223,933.779,"Yes, Your Honor."
2004.03-1696,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,933.779,936.651,"And then when the Delaware case was over, then what should he have done?"
2004.03-1696,0,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,936.651,943.71,"Well, we could either ultimately dismiss it or the Federal district court could say, looks like your Delaware case is over."
2004.03-1696,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,945.112,946.515,And... and he has given you all the relief your entitled to.
2004.03-1696,0,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,948.373,950.026,"--Yes, or SABIC brings a motion--"
2004.03-1696,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,950.026,952.998,"And therefore, my next question is why shouldn't we do exactly that now."
2004.03-1696,0,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,952.998,963.024,"--Because the question before the Court today is a question of jurisdiction, not of practical consequences other than the mootness question that SABIC has raised."
2004.03-1696,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,966.701,972.766,"Well, maybe we could vacate the judgment of the court of appeals, say that was wrong, but still, order it dismissed after we vacate the judgment."
2004.03-1696,0,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,972.766,977.679,"--I think, as in Feldman, that's a question that should be first addressed by the district court."
2004.03-1696,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,985.315,990.395,"But if you don't tell us what issue remains, I don't know why we shouldn't just direct the suit to be dismissed."
2004.03-1696,0,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,990.395,999.144,"There... there is a live... in... in the terms of Article III, there are live claims that remain pending before the district court."
2004.03-1696,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1000.137,1006.842,And I take it that's because you don't have the cert period expired yet in the first action and you don't have the check.
2004.03-1696,0,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,1006.842,1008.061,--At the very minimum--
2004.03-1696,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1008.061,1008.683,Okay.
2004.03-1696,0,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,1014.643,1017.804,"--As a practical matter, we have no intention."
2004.03-1696,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1019.828,1021.23,I'm not asking about your intention.
2004.03-1696,0,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,1026.432,1032.626,"--If we did intend to litigate further, SABIC would be entitled to go to the district court and say they can't."
2004.03-1696,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1033.573,1035.348,I want... I want an answer to my question.
2004.03-1696,0,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,1038.132,1045.008,"Well, again, setting aside our intentions and hypothetically, there are cases in which--"
2004.03-1696,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1045.008,1047.691,I'm talking about your case.
2004.03-1696,0,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,1048.767,1054.461,--We... we do not seek... will not seek any further review from the district court.
2004.03-1696,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1054.461,1054.611,Nothing is left.
2004.03-1696,0,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,1054.611,1055.204,"Yes, Your Honor."
2004.03-1696,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1055.204,1056.856,"Now, suppose you don't have the check."
2004.03-1696,0,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,1057.616,1060.117,"Well, the case is still up in the air."
2004.03-1696,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1060.117,1060.588,Why?
2004.03-1696,0,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,1060.588,1061.686,Because--
2004.03-1696,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1061.686,1062.984,You have a judgment.
2004.03-1696,0,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,1062.984,1063.356,--the case... the case is not over.
2004.03-1696,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1064.842,1066.782,I never heard of a case that isn't over until you get the check.
2004.03-1696,0,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,1072.438,1073.264,--There is a different matter.
2004.03-1696,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1085.979,1092.212,--Suppose that you lost in the State court and the judgment is final.
2004.03-1696,0,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,1102.243,1118.385,Our argument is that it would be applicable only if the injury that we claimed in our Federal suit was an injury caused by the State court... the court itself or the judge rather than our adversary and we sought relief from that judgment.
2004.03-1696,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1129.297,1140.509,"In other words, if you had some ongoing relation and, in this hypothetical, the State court ruled against you and you went in to try to reverse that ruling, that would be... that would Rooker-Feldman."
2004.03-1696,0,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,1140.509,1141.252,Yes.
2004.03-1696,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1146.825,1151.366,"There were only the two cases, Rooker and Feldman, that established this."
2004.03-1696,0,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,1151.366,1151.988,Yes.
2004.03-1696,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1151.988,1174.196,"Has this Court ever said anything to suggest that Rooker-Feldman, as apart from preclusion doctrine, applies to parallel litigation instead of you go into Federal court after the State court is over and you're trying to undo what the State court did?"
2004.03-1696,0,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,1174.196,1183.234,"I don't think this Court has ever held any such thing, and I think it would be inconsistent with at least Feldman itself."
2004.03-1696,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1224.472,1226.701,But there's no preclusion unless they're also decided.
2004.03-1696,0,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,1226.701,1228.438,Yes.
2004.03-1696,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1318.595,1319.96,You may do so.
2004.03-1696,1,25056,gregory_andrew_castanias,,1332.341,1334.449,"Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court:"
2004.03-1696,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1338.907,1340.765,"Well, you're still asking for cert.."
2004.03-1696,1,25056,gregory_andrew_castanias,,1340.765,1342.001,"--That's right, and that's--"
2004.03-1696,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1342.001,1343.365,"Well, then why is it moot?"
2004.03-1696,1,25056,gregory_andrew_castanias,,1365.246,1365.568,"--Okay. Well, I'm... I'm not going to take the Hobson's choice, Your Honor, but I am going to tell you, first of all, that SABIC is going to apply for cert.."
2004.03-1696,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1420.369,1420.807,All right.
2004.03-1696,1,25056,gregory_andrew_castanias,,1457.216,1459.157,"My response, Justice Breyer, is twofold."
2004.03-1696,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1475.504,1489.372,"Mr. Castanias, was there a proper case in the district court when the complaint was initially filed there some 2 months after you filed in Delaware?"
2004.03-1696,1,25056,gregory_andrew_castanias,,1489.372,1491.48,"We've never disputed that, Justice Ginsburg."
2004.03-1696,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1491.48,1491.646,All right.
2004.03-1696,1,25056,gregory_andrew_castanias,,1503.906,1504.649,Right.
2004.03-1696,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1504.649,1523.597,"Now, you are urging that Rooker-Feldman which this Court never applied when you had parallel litigation be extended into a domain which is ordinarily taken care of by preclusion doctrine."
2004.03-1696,1,25056,gregory_andrew_castanias,,1554.638,1566.405,"Well, Justice Ginsburg, preclusion doctrine may accomplish this in a certain number of cases, but I think it's important... and I think I have to correct my colleague on the other side here with regard to the state of the record."
2004.03-1696,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1577.938,1580.728,"Well, I'm not talking about anything fancy like Colorado River."
2004.03-1696,1,25056,gregory_andrew_castanias,,1604.01,1614.701,"--Well, I... I think, Your Honor, you will see that that is a component of Colorado River, and that was part of the application that we made to the district court in this case under Colorado River."
2004.03-1696,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1633.443,1655.818,"Well, sometimes district judges rule incorrectly, but... but what happened here is the district court case did not go on because the two of you, both sides, said, okay, the district court... they're all bollixed up with this Foreign Sovereign Immunity Act, so we're going to agree."
2004.03-1696,1,25056,gregory_andrew_castanias,,1663.825,1670.595,"Well, it was... it was... if you'll look at... I believe this is at page 8a of the addendum to the red brief."
2004.03-1696,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1680.089,1686.654,"Well, when you say they pushed in Delaware, you brought them into Delaware and a... in a reverse suit."
2004.03-1696,1,25056,gregory_andrew_castanias,,1689.627,1690.12,Right.
2004.03-1696,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1690.12,1693.092,They brought their case for liability in the Federal forum.
2004.03-1696,1,25056,gregory_andrew_castanias,,1702.834,1708.696,"We... that is true that we brought the initial case, but the case was eventually tried on their counterclaims."
2004.03-1696,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1720.007,1721.306,"But it was your preferred forum, not theirs."
2004.03-1696,1,25056,gregory_andrew_castanias,,1729.75,1733.465,That... that is absolutely the case with regard to the Delaware matter.
2004.03-1696,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1762.239,1764.839,"Well, that's... you see, Justice Ginsburg answered that."
2004.03-1696,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1781.019,1784.363,Which happens thousands of times in... in all of the courts.
2004.03-1696,1,25056,gregory_andrew_castanias,,1791.505,1792.703,Justice Kennedy--
2004.03-1696,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1792.703,1794.682,"Or end of argument, not end of case."
2004.03-1696,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1795.304,1797.821,So why isn't it that the end?
2004.03-1696,1,25056,gregory_andrew_castanias,,1816.025,1825.602,"--Justice Breyer, I think this is the point in the argument where I want to turn to the definition of review as this Court has... has put it forth in cases like ASARCO."
2004.03-1696,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1891.732,1904.075,"So perhaps the Court, if it had been more cautious, would have spoken not in terms of Rooker-Feldman or review, but in terms of this matter has been decided."
2004.03-1696,1,25056,gregory_andrew_castanias,,1948.657,1955.716,"Well, first of all, Justice Ginsburg, I'm hesitant to say that this Court was incautious in its use of words."
2004.03-1696,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1956.476,1957.286,It is sometimes.
2004.03-1696,1,25056,gregory_andrew_castanias,,1957.286,1967.567,"--But... understandably, but... but with regard to... with regard to Rooker-Feldman, it was not just... it was not just an accidental... incidental invocation of it."
2004.03-1696,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1981.435,1990.352,"That's why one has preclusion because you are giving respect, full faith and credit, to a decision elsewhere."
2004.03-1696,1,25056,gregory_andrew_castanias,,2006.965,2029.24,"--That's... that's... that is... that is generally right, Justice Ginsburg, but at the same time, there... we all agree... Exxon Mobil, SABIC, and the decisions of this Court... that there has to be some overlap with regard to Rooker-Feldman and SABIC... and... excuse me... and... and preclusion doctrine."
2004.03-1696,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2049.385,2050.094,But you--
2004.03-1696,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2050.094,2060.748,So some of the lower courts have given a broad interpretation to Rooker-Feldman and have turned it into something other than the narrower view of it.
2004.03-1696,1,25056,gregory_andrew_castanias,,2073.667,2083.039,"--Well, I... I guess in that respect, Justice O'Connor, I disagree because the Third Circuit, admitted by its own words, applies a very narrow version of Rooker-Feldman."
2004.03-1696,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2111.274,2119.735,But maybe that isn't a proper application of Rooker-Feldman where the complaint is not about something the State court has improperly done.
2004.03-1696,1,25056,gregory_andrew_castanias,,2119.735,2120.934,Well--
2004.03-1696,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2120.934,2122.42,It isn't.
2004.03-1696,1,25056,gregory_andrew_castanias,,2128.697,2138.478,"--Well, to be sure, Justice O'Connor, the Third Circuit's view is broader than that which appears to be adopted by the Ninth Circuit, as well as the Seventh Circuit."
2004.03-1696,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2165.106,2168.161,"Of course, that's the language that was used in both Rooker and Feldman too I think."
2004.03-1696,1,25056,gregory_andrew_castanias,,2168.161,2174.477,"--And that's because, Justice Stevens, that's... that was the particular fact pattern of this... of that case."
2004.03-1696,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2174.477,2177.738,And that's the only fact pattern any of our cases have dealt with.
2004.03-1696,1,25056,gregory_andrew_castanias,,2177.738,2180.3,"That's... in the Supreme Court, that's right."
2004.03-1696,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2180.3,2188.678,"And the... and the concern is I think... at least as I understand the... the concern with it, it... it boils down to something like this."
2004.03-1696,1,25056,gregory_andrew_castanias,,2279.534,2286.1,"Well, Justice Souter, I... I don't have any qualms with the application of claim preclusion here."
2004.03-1696,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2324.449,2336.459,"Well, no, because the... it... it would not rule out the need to have some answer when someone in a Federal court comes along and says, don't apply claim preclusion, whatever the reason may be."
2004.03-1696,1,25056,gregory_andrew_castanias,,2361.147,2374.083,"Well, Justice Souter, I think again, with respect to the hypothetical that you've put to me, the claim preclusion is appropriately--"
2004.03-1696,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2374.083,2379.556,It'll get the... it'll get the job done that you say will need to be done if you get to that point.
2004.03-1696,1,25056,gregory_andrew_castanias,,2379.556,2380.959,--It... it should get the job done.
2004.03-1696,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2380.959,2381.58,Why won't it?
2004.03-1696,1,25056,gregory_andrew_castanias,,2381.58,2384.014,"Well, there... there are... first of all, there are no guarantees."
2004.03-1696,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2388.639,2389.298,Then... then you--
2004.03-1696,1,25056,gregory_andrew_castanias,,2389.298,2390.247,The preclusion doctrine--
2004.03-1696,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2390.247,2391.361,--Then... then you appeal.
2004.03-1696,1,25056,gregory_andrew_castanias,,2398.586,2408.784,"--I... I disagree, Justice Souter, that... that we're asking for anything like a huge, new body of law or that the Third Circuit was making a huge, new body of law."
2004.03-1696,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2408.784,2417.739,"--Well, you're asking us to extend Rooker-Feldman beyond where this Court has taken it, and if I recall correctly, you really didn't ask for this."
2004.03-1696,1,25056,gregory_andrew_castanias,,2423.523,2428.186,"Well, that's true, Justice Ginsburg, but it's true because of the briefing cycle."
2004.03-1696,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2433.964,2434.707,Mr. Castanias--
2004.03-1696,1,25056,gregory_andrew_castanias,,2434.707,2435.073,--Yes.
2004.03-1696,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2435.073,2436.559,--could... could I come back to mootness?
2004.03-1696,1,25056,gregory_andrew_castanias,,2485.478,2487.829,"Well, or the other side is going to give up."
2004.03-1696,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2487.829,2489.109,Or give up.
2004.03-1696,1,25056,gregory_andrew_castanias,,2501.286,2510.37,"Well, Justice Scalia, in the... in the realm that we're talking about here, the Fourth Circuit's decision in the Friedman's case came to a mootness conclusion."
2004.03-1696,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2540.091,2548.265,"Well, I... I don't know why... well, if it's... if it were so classic, there would be a lot of cases, and I don't... I'm not sure that any of yours are right on point."
2004.03-1696,1,25056,gregory_andrew_castanias,,2557.303,2564.899,"Well, and again, I'm... I'm certainly not going to fight claim preclusion because this is a suit that should not be here."
2004.03-1696,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2577.919,2580.42,Why is it moot?
2004.03-1696,1,25056,gregory_andrew_castanias,,2605.19,2611.339,"--I'm not sure I understand the question, Justice Breyer."
2004.03-1696,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2611.339,2622.008,"I mean, is... does the State statute of limitations, if... if it applied to the State's case, does it also apply in the Federal cases, the identical ground that everybody agrees that the State statute governs?"
2004.03-1696,1,25056,gregory_andrew_castanias,,2622.008,2629.543,"The... the... there could be... there could be issue preclusive grounds on such a ruling, Justice Breyer, but... but--"
2004.03-1696,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2629.543,2636.231,"I mean, if you... if you win, then... then... if you win your State case, because of the argument you made, do you also automatically win the Federal case?"
2004.03-1696,1,25056,gregory_andrew_castanias,,2636.99,2639.74,--I... I don't think I could say that at this point because--
2004.03-1696,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2639.74,2641.764,So it may not be the same issue.
2004.03-1696,1,25056,gregory_andrew_castanias,,2653.569,2654.972,--And... and that is a future event.
2004.03-1696,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2654.972,2655.715,Yes.
2004.03-1696,1,25056,gregory_andrew_castanias,,2693.61,2695.551,"Well, I... I guess, Justice Breyer--"
2004.03-1696,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2695.551,2697.037,Is that right or not?
2004.03-1696,1,25056,gregory_andrew_castanias,,2697.037,2697.408,--I don't think it's right.
2004.03-1696,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2697.408,2697.946,Because?
2004.03-1696,1,25056,gregory_andrew_castanias,,2697.946,2703.352,And... and I think the reason it's not right is because that just shows that there's no live controversy right now.
2004.03-1696,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2706.036,2720.154,"Oh, well, but that... that isn't fair to them because, for all I know, they filed the Federal case because there's a different statute of limitations, say, that governs it that will have expired if you don't let them file it by the time... until this whole thing is over."
2004.03-1696,1,25056,gregory_andrew_castanias,,2721.557,2724.323,"Well, two answers to that, Justice Breyer."
2004.03-1696,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2739.738,2742.461,That's explaining the unclear by the incredibly hard to understand.
2004.03-1696,1,25056,gregory_andrew_castanias,,2742.461,2742.611,--I'm sorry.
2004.03-1696,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2743.287,2746.342,It's explaining the unclear by reference to the incomprehensible.
2004.03-1696,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2749.314,2752.575,I think I wrote that opinion.
2004.03-1696,1,25056,gregory_andrew_castanias,,2754.887,2758.231,"And indeed, you did, Justice Scalia."
2004.03-1696,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2758.231,2758.891,I never did like it.
2004.03-1696,1,25056,gregory_andrew_castanias,,2760.377,2762.773,I... I've also gotten that impression.
2004.03-1696,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2788.945,2791.175,"No, no, because it's where you walk in the door."
2004.03-1696,1,25056,gregory_andrew_castanias,,2843.847,2859.345,"--No, and in fact, the case that's cited against us for that proposition, the Freeport-McMoran case, makes clear, in the portion of it not cited by Exxon Mobil, that that rule is limited to the diversity context."
2004.03-1696,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2883.478,2883.749,Maybe.
2004.03-1696,1,25056,gregory_andrew_castanias,,2884.508,2885.54,"Well, in this case, yes."
2004.03-1696,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2893.425,2900.029,"--A case can become moot, but we've already expressed considerable doubt whether that is the fate of this case."
2004.03-1696,1,25056,gregory_andrew_castanias,,2911.546,2927.233,"Well, I guess I come back to... to where I started with Justice Breyer on the... on the merits of the Rooker-Feldman issue this morning, which is that the concurrent jurisdiction is something to be dealt with."
2004.03-1696,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2943.087,2943.869,May I ask you?
2004.03-1696,1,25056,gregory_andrew_castanias,,2970.989,2976.357,"Well, I... I would have to say that Feldman, of the two of them, is probably stronger support."
2004.03-1696,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2976.357,2981.392,And that is the case in which the court of appeals was itself a party to the litigation.
2004.03-1696,1,25056,gregory_andrew_castanias,,2981.392,2982.013,That's right.
2004.03-1696,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3043.89,3047.334,"Thank you, Mr. Castanias."
2004.03-1696,2,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,3050.472,3053.528,"And I'll take just a few of them, Your Honor."
2004.03-1696,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3151.442,3152.724,"Well, that depends on who wins."
2004.03-1696,2,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,3152.724,3155.529,--You're right.
2004.03-1696,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3155.529,3160.237,"I mean, if you lost in the other suit, your claim here wouldn't be moot."
2004.03-1696,2,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,3162.876,3164.363,I... I think that's right.
2004.03-1696,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3240.485,3248.037,"--Mr. Coleman, I don't mean to take your time, but in the ASARCO case, was the State court judgment final at the time in dispute?"
2004.03-1696,2,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,3248.037,3249.978,"--Your Honor, there's a question about that."
2004.03-1696,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3261.373,3267.811,"Because if the judgment were final, then that would fit right into your... your analysis, if the judgment of the State court were final."
2004.03-1696,2,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,3267.811,3268.842,"Yes, Your Honor, it would."
2004.03-1696,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3268.842,3269.008,Yes.
2004.03-1696,2,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,3269.008,3294.355,"In the... at the end of the day, we believe that this Court's preclusion jurisprudence is not riddled with vagaries, that it's not difficult to understand, and that it's certainly not more vague or difficult than the borrowing that they are attempting to do to bring existing preclusion doctrines into... in order to expand Rooker-Feldman."
2004.03-1696,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3306.365,3307.73,"Thank you, Mr. Coleman."
