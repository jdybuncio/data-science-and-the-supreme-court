2007.07-440,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.137,"We will now hear argument in Case 07-440, Rothgery v. Gillespie County, Texas."
2007.07-440,0,21594,danielle_spinelli,,8.353,24.177,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In Brewer and Jackson, this Court held that an initial appearance before a magistrate like the one here marks the commencement of a criminal prosecution under the Sixth Amendment."
2007.07-440,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,87.93,95.351,"Counsel, how can this... how can this be part of an adversary proceeding when there's no other adversary on the field?"
2007.07-440,0,21594,danielle_spinelli,,99.223,108.234,"Mr. Chief Justice, this Court held in Jackson that the question whether a particular--"
2007.07-440,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,108.234,114.403,"Well, in Jackson of course the charges had already been filed by the prosecutor, so there was an adversary on the field."
2007.07-440,0,21594,danielle_spinelli,,114.403,141.315,--What I was going to say was that there is a clear distinction which is set forth in this Court's opinion in Jackson between the question whether a particular proceeding initiates a criminal prosecution and whether that proceeding itself is adversarial in the sense that it requires the presence of defense counsel.
2007.07-440,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,158.371,165.321,"Well, I suppose... I suppose you could you have an adversarial proceeding without the prosecutor present, but it would depend on the nature of the proceeding."
2007.07-440,0,21594,danielle_spinelli,,182.719,187.06,"--That's correct, Mr. Chief Justice, and we don't contend that it is adversarial."
2007.07-440,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,235.054,241.006,"Well, I guess I'll get back to the point I raised earlier, that in Jackson charges had already been filed by a prosecutor."
2007.07-440,0,21594,danielle_spinelli,,246.394,251.767,"Well, the Court in Jackson placed no weight on that distinction."
2007.07-440,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,296.795,308.291,"But what we're looking for here, at least one of the things we might look for in this case, is a specific rule to give to the States so the State knows when counsel has to be appointed."
2007.07-440,0,21594,danielle_spinelli,,321.94,342.465,"Had there been no way in which the defendant was bound to reappear and answer the charges, then we would not have the situation that we have, and it would seem less likely that that would initiate a criminal proceeding."
2007.07-440,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,351.275,372.047,"Ms. Spinelli, there's something confusing about your presentation of this, because you say that at this initial appearance that's called a magistration, you are not contending that there was a right to counsel at that very proceeding."
2007.07-440,0,21594,danielle_spinelli,,372.047,373.841,"--That's correct, Justice Ginsburg."
2007.07-440,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,373.841,377.854,"So when, at what point in time, did this right to counsel attach?"
2007.07-440,0,21594,danielle_spinelli,,384.947,392.146,"Well, first I should say I believe that that question goes to Respondent's alternative argument for affirmance."
2007.07-440,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,415.279,422.915,But you are taking the position that there was a right to counsel that attached in this case.
2007.07-440,0,21594,danielle_spinelli,,428.193,437.782,"--We believe that... well, this Court's cases have made clear that the right to counsel attaches at the time a criminal prosecution commences."
2007.07-440,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,449.2,450.499,"What does ""attachment"" mean?"
2007.07-440,0,21594,danielle_spinelli,,450.499,473.595,"What ""attachment"" means under this Court's cases is that since a criminal prosecution has now begun, the explicit guarantees of the Sixth Amendment are applicable, the State no longer... the State cannot interfere after that point with the attorney-client relationship."
2007.07-440,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,478.314,489.763,"Well if Mr. Roth... if your client had shown up at the magistration with an attorney, could the State of Texas have said, no, your attorney may not be present during the magistration?"
2007.07-440,0,21594,danielle_spinelli,,489.763,493.667,"--No, I don't believe so, because--"
2007.07-440,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,493.667,497.714,"Well, does that mean that the right attached prior to the magistration?"
2007.07-440,0,21594,danielle_spinelli,,497.714,502.414,--We believe that the right attached at the magistration.
2007.07-440,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,502.414,505.022,"At the beginning, at the end?"
2007.07-440,0,21594,danielle_spinelli,,505.022,507.505,Upon the magistration.
2007.07-440,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,507.505,508.768,What does that mean?
2007.07-440,0,21594,danielle_spinelli,,508.768,513.128,"So perhaps... so at the end... I suppose I would say at the end, once--"
2007.07-440,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,513.128,526.122,"Then why could Texas have said your attorney... why could Texas have not said, although you came here with an attorney, your attorney may not be present because you don't have a Sixth Amendment right to counsel at the magistration?"
2007.07-440,0,21594,danielle_spinelli,,531.371,552.299,"--Well, I believe that it would attach at the time that the magistrate informed the defendant of the accusation against him, at which point he became a defendant in a criminal case and his right to counsel attached."
2007.07-440,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,583.473,585.645,The two are kind of related.
2007.07-440,0,21594,danielle_spinelli,,603.153,604.994,"No, I don't believe so, Your Honor."
2007.07-440,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,627.19,629.019,How is that different from a traffic ticket?
2007.07-440,0,21594,danielle_spinelli,,629.019,642.744,"It's very different from a traffic ticket, Justice Kennedy, because in that situation... I think that situation would be analogous to a warrantless arrest, which, as we know, does not commence adversary judicial proceedings."
2007.07-440,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,650.821,652.615,So it's the warrant that makes the difference?
2007.07-440,0,21594,danielle_spinelli,,652.615,653.945,"--No, I don't believe so."
2007.07-440,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,655.898,657.723,Or the incarceration.
2007.07-440,0,21594,danielle_spinelli,,686.633,696.835,"If he had not been required to make bail or make any other binding promise to appear, which is the function of bail, to ensure that the defendant will answer the accusation--"
2007.07-440,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,696.835,697.287,Right.
2007.07-440,0,21594,danielle_spinelli,,697.287,702.236,--then we would be lacking that piece of evidence that he had been accused.
2007.07-440,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,709.594,719.854,"So Texas... assuming we agree with that, Texas made one of two possible constitutional violations."
2007.07-440,0,21594,danielle_spinelli,,737.269,744.55,"Well, there is certainly nothing unconstitutional about requiring bail, as we know."
2007.07-440,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,744.55,747.08,"Well, there certainly is if you're not charged."
2007.07-440,0,21594,danielle_spinelli,,757.901,759.559,"Well, we... I mean, we--"
2007.07-440,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,759.559,763.54,--The fact... the fact that he was held suggests that he was charged with something.
2007.07-440,0,21594,danielle_spinelli,,763.54,765.103,"--We agree, Justice Scalia."
2007.07-440,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,769.896,770.649,Sure.
2007.07-440,0,21594,danielle_spinelli,,770.649,772.848,--accused will answer the accusation against him.
2007.07-440,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,772.848,777.176,"So maybe, maybe Texas was wrong about that, that it shouldn't have required bail."
2007.07-440,0,21594,danielle_spinelli,,782.172,791.592,"Well, what occurred here, however, was that Texas did require Mr. Rothgery to post bail."
2007.07-440,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,799.899,806.945,"--that a magistrate is required whenever bail is set... pardon me, that an attorney is required whenever bail is set?"
2007.07-440,0,21594,danielle_spinelli,,806.945,810.724,We're not contending that an attorney was required.
2007.07-440,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,810.724,814.877,"The rule is... I want to know, what do we tell Texas it has to do in all these cases?"
2007.07-440,0,21594,danielle_spinelli,,824.205,857.472,"I think the rule... we're actually not asking the Court to adopt any new rule today, but simply to reaffirm the rule it has already announced in Brewer and Jackson, which is that an initial appearance before a magistrate, which is a proceeding that is common across jurisdictions and has a common significance across jurisdictions, a proceeding at which a magistrate informs the defendant officially of the accusation against him and of his rights as a criminal defendant--"
2007.07-440,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,857.472,859.956,But when do you say counsel has to be appointed?
2007.07-440,0,21594,danielle_spinelli,,865.703,866.311,"--No, we believe--"
2007.07-440,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,866.311,871.216,What if... what if an attorney had been appointed here ten days after the magistration?
2007.07-440,0,21594,danielle_spinelli,,871.216,883.914,--Our contention is that an attorney was required to be appointed promptly after Rothgery renewed his request for an attorney following the magistration.
2007.07-440,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,883.914,884.398,"Okay, so the--"
2007.07-440,0,21594,danielle_spinelli,,884.398,885.037,And this Court--
2007.07-440,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,885.037,897.675,"--What is the... so the point of the magistration is that is the point at which a reasonable time starts running within which Texas must afford... appoint counsel, isn't that your basic point?"
2007.07-440,0,21594,danielle_spinelli,,897.675,898.08,"--Correct, Justice Souter."
2007.07-440,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,898.08,898.564,Okay.
2007.07-440,0,21594,danielle_spinelli,,898.564,899.594,That's our contention.
2007.07-440,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,899.594,903.501,So there's no claim that there was anything invalid about the magistration proceeding--
2007.07-440,0,21594,danielle_spinelli,,903.501,903.969,Not at all.
2007.07-440,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,903.969,905.794,--itself because there was no counsel there.
2007.07-440,0,21594,danielle_spinelli,,905.794,907.202,"No, not at all."
2007.07-440,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,907.202,915.651,"There's no claim... for example, had there been a probable cause hearing, that the attorney would have been required to participate in the probable cause hearing under--"
2007.07-440,0,21594,danielle_spinelli,,915.651,916.182,No.
2007.07-440,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,916.182,920.554,--There has simply got to be one appointed within a reasonable time after the magistration.
2007.07-440,0,21594,danielle_spinelli,,922.242,923.147,That's correct.
2007.07-440,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,923.147,924.348,Is there any law on that?
2007.07-440,0,21594,danielle_spinelli,,947.246,952.85,"Justice Breyer, this Court has not been faced with the question--"
2007.07-440,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,952.85,953.633,So the answer is no.
2007.07-440,0,21594,danielle_spinelli,,953.633,954.725,--Right.
2007.07-440,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,954.725,960.146,What happens... what happens if... the part that's worrying and I don't know how people handle it... a riot.
2007.07-440,0,21594,danielle_spinelli,,992.165,995.991,How is it handled with respect to the persons who were indicted?
2007.07-440,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,995.991,996.381,No.
2007.07-440,0,21594,danielle_spinelli,,997.223,997.71,Or how is it--
2007.07-440,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,997.71,1001.364,I mean... I'm talking about the people who nobody ever intends to prosecute.
2007.07-440,0,21594,danielle_spinelli,,1012.282,1013.171,--If there are--
2007.07-440,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1013.171,1019.761,"Or they're... or the D.A. says, you know, forfeit... like a traffic ticket or something... forfeit your bond."
2007.07-440,0,21594,danielle_spinelli,,1027.104,1034.771,"--If a person is arrested, brought to the station house, and then released prior to the initial appearance, which is actually a--"
2007.07-440,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1034.771,1036.054,"Well, you see what I'm doing."
2007.07-440,0,21594,danielle_spinelli,,1071.586,1083.519,"--It happens quite frequently, Justice Breyer, that persons are arrested, brought to the station house, and then released by the police without undergoing an initial appearance."
2007.07-440,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1089.516,1093.309,"Why not, if they initiate charges against them?"
2007.07-440,0,21594,danielle_spinelli,,1107.009,1113.116,"Well, it... it might depend on the manner in which the charges are conveyed or filed."
2007.07-440,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1144.444,1147.271,"Well, what about my traffic ticket?"
2007.07-440,0,21594,danielle_spinelli,,1147.271,1148.16,I don't believe--
2007.07-440,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1148.16,1149.443,I've never had one so I don't know what they say.
2007.07-440,0,21594,danielle_spinelli,,1152.692,1162.172,--I believe... I believe a ticket or a citation of that nature would not commence adversary judicial proceedings because it's analogous to a warrantless arrest.
2007.07-440,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1162.172,1177.227,"Why doesn't it solve your... the problem that you're obviously wrestling with, if... if we simply said there is a right to counsel, but it doesn't attach until there's a significant stage of the prosecution which then follows?"
2007.07-440,0,21594,danielle_spinelli,,1201.53,1201.873,Well--
2007.07-440,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1201.873,1203.187,Why wouldn't that solve the problem?
2007.07-440,0,21594,danielle_spinelli,,1203.187,1209.918,"--First of all, we agree that a prosecution commences upon a first appearance before a judge--"
2007.07-440,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1209.918,1211.06,"That's fine, but--"
2007.07-440,0,21594,danielle_spinelli,,1211.06,1211.466,--Not merely--
2007.07-440,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1211.466,1213.775,--But you only need counsel at significant phases.
2007.07-440,0,21594,danielle_spinelli,,1213.775,1214.261,"--Oh, right."
2007.07-440,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1220.149,1220.492,Right.
2007.07-440,0,21594,danielle_spinelli,,1220.492,1221.6,So just to be clear about that.
2007.07-440,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1228.799,1231.973,"Yes, but it's so wrapped up with how we decide this case."
2007.07-440,0,21594,danielle_spinelli,,1259.102,1308.645,"--Well, were the Court to reach that alternative argument, which is that... despite the fact that a criminal prosecution had commenced, and Rothgery was an accused, by hypothesis he nevertheless was not entitled to the assistance of counsel for his defense because no critical stage had been reached... we would say, first of all, assuming that Respondent is correct, that the right to counsel lies dormant following its attachment on the commencement of a criminal prosecution until some subsequent critical stage is reached, if we assume that that is correct, there was such a stage here because Mr. Rothgery was faced with the decision whether or not to invoke his right to an examining trial."
2007.07-440,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1308.645,1316.764,"But that was at the magistration, and you... you have said that there was no right to counsel at the magistration."
2007.07-440,0,21594,danielle_spinelli,,1316.764,1323.729,"That's correct, Justice Ginsburg, but his decision regarding the examining trial was not one that needed to be made at the magistration."
2007.07-440,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1336.972,1339.47,Any time prior... any time prior to indictment?
2007.07-440,0,21594,danielle_spinelli,,1339.47,1340.281,--Correct.
2007.07-440,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1341.361,1349.609,So you're saying that that is the critical stage that he needed to have counsel's advice about.
2007.07-440,0,21594,danielle_spinelli,,1349.609,1357.276,"--To the extent that it's necessary to have a critical stage, then we believe that is a critical stage."
2007.07-440,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1357.276,1361.978,"And that stage would arise immediately as soon as the magistration was completed, right?"
2007.07-440,0,21594,danielle_spinelli,,1361.978,1362.68,His right--
2007.07-440,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1362.68,1364.849,He'd have to have counsel appointed immediately--
2007.07-440,0,21594,danielle_spinelli,,1364.849,1365.134,--Well--
2007.07-440,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1365.134,1367.929,--to advise him whether to ask for this hearing or not.
2007.07-440,0,21594,danielle_spinelli,,1367.929,1373.251,"--Not necessarily immediately, but within some reasonable time after his request, and after he had demonstrated--"
2007.07-440,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1373.251,1374.956,"Before he said no, I don't want an examining trial."
2007.07-440,0,21594,danielle_spinelli,,1380.922,1395.491,"--Well, I mean, had he said... had he waived his right to an examining trial, which he didn't do, then, you know, under... then we would not have--"
2007.07-440,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1395.491,1397.18,But he could do it; anyone else could do it.
2007.07-440,0,21594,danielle_spinelli,,1405.379,1407.739,--Yes.
2007.07-440,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1422.183,1431.76,"Well, then... but then you are saying that he has a right to counsel at the magistration, because that's when the magistrate says: Look, you have an examining trial coming up, and you can waive your right to that."
2007.07-440,0,21594,danielle_spinelli,,1431.76,1432.665,--No.
2007.07-440,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1436.007,1437.301,What does he say about the examining--
2007.07-440,0,21594,danielle_spinelli,,1437.301,1437.508,At a magistration--
2007.07-440,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1437.508,1438.615,--What does he say about an examining--
2007.07-440,0,21594,danielle_spinelli,,1438.615,1447.97,"--Precisely what he said and what appears on the warning form is: In a felony case, you have a right to an examining trial."
2007.07-440,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1460.231,1473.134,"Do you know any other case in which we've held that it's a critical stage of the proceeding where nothing has happened, but something could have happened if the defendant had asked for it?"
2007.07-440,0,21594,danielle_spinelli,,1473.134,1474.803,"Well, we're not contending that."
2007.07-440,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1474.803,1479.304,I don't... I find it hard to describe that as a critical stage of the proceeding.
2007.07-440,0,21594,danielle_spinelli,,1479.304,1481.394,"We're not contending that, Justice Scalia."
2007.07-440,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1488.267,1491.609,"When the trial occurs, it is a critical stage."
2007.07-440,0,21594,danielle_spinelli,,1491.609,1491.999,Correct.
2007.07-440,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1491.999,1492.623,I have no doubt.
2007.07-440,0,21594,danielle_spinelli,,1492.623,1493.142,And--
2007.07-440,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1493.142,1499.498,But you're claiming that his decision of whether to ask for that or not is a critical stage.
2007.07-440,0,21594,danielle_spinelli,,1505.824,1524.487,"--I think the strongest precedent for that is Estelle versus Smith, in which this Court held that counsel... counsel's assistance is needed not only to conduct and prepare for critical stages, but also to assist a defendant in deciding whether to undergo them."
2007.07-440,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1554.303,1558.004,"I know... when we were talking about traffic tickets, you said, well, that was a warrantless arrest."
2007.07-440,0,21594,danielle_spinelli,,1559.77,1563.143,"This was a warrantless arrest, but following that--"
2007.07-440,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1563.143,1563.549,And then--
2007.07-440,0,21594,danielle_spinelli,,1563.549,1574.202,"--But there was more, because following that, there was... the magistration occurred, at which time the police officer filed an affidavit setting forth the basis of the charges."
2007.07-440,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1594.616,1601.222,"--Well, not exactly these facts, because in Jackson the prosecutor had already filed charges."
2007.07-440,0,21594,danielle_spinelli,,1601.222,1607.407,Charges were filed in Jackson in exactly the same sense that charges were filed here.
2007.07-440,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1615.575,1617.588,But the prosecutor wasn't involved here.
2007.07-440,0,21594,danielle_spinelli,,1619.432,1630.71,"--That's correct, but we don't believe that should make any difference because the effect on the Defendant of this proceeding is precisely the same, whether or not a prosecutor is involved."
2007.07-440,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1657.371,1657.745,Yes.
2007.07-440,1,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,1665.38,1675.925,"Good morning, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The magistration that follows every Texas arrest does not begin a criminal prosecution under the Sixth Amendment."
2007.07-440,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1686.267,1687.936,Then how could they hold them in jail?
2007.07-440,1,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,1687.936,1702.554,"--It is not uncommon... in fact, it's universal practice that when one is arrested on a... without a warrant, it is normally because a police officer sees an individual in the commission of a crime."
2007.07-440,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1717.454,1718.468,What happens in Texas?
2007.07-440,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1718.468,1722.89,He was held after he saw the magistrate.
2007.07-440,1,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,1730.388,1736.667,Texas statute allows for counsel under that situation.
2007.07-440,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1739.338,1742.197,I am asking what the constitutional rule is.
2007.07-440,1,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,1742.197,1742.915,The Fourth--
2007.07-440,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1742.915,1746.474,We have here a proceeding before a magistrate; this results in custody.
2007.07-440,1,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,1752.067,1754.925,"--No, Your Honor."
2007.07-440,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1756.048,1759.795,What authority do you have to hold somebody who's not been charged?
2007.07-440,1,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,1769.544,1782.303,"--We believe that this is an issue that was addressed by the Court in Gerstein and McLaughlin, that the Fourth Amendment prevents unreasonable seizures and the Sixth Amendment speedy trial rights kick in."
2007.07-440,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1803.264,1815.164,"What you're saying, in answer to Justice Kennedy's question, that an individual can be brought into court, held in jail for three weeks without charge, and no right to counsel applies?"
2007.07-440,1,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,1824.882,1827.191,--Gerstein says that there must be--
2007.07-440,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1827.191,1828.91,I want to know what your answer is here.
2007.07-440,1,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,1845.842,1847.402,--That could not happen in Texas.
2007.07-440,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1847.402,1853.759,I'm not asking whether it could happen; I'm asking whether it would be constitutional without appointing counsel.
2007.07-440,1,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,1853.759,1859.942,It would be... not be a violation of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel.
2007.07-440,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1859.942,1864.583,But it would be a violation of some liberty interest beside the Sixth Amendment.
2007.07-440,1,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,1864.583,1872.097,It might well be a violation of the Fourth Amendment or other Sixth Amendment--
2007.07-440,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1872.097,1875.03,No counsel right would attach?
2007.07-440,1,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,1875.03,1875.735,--That's correct.
2007.07-440,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1875.735,1878.812,I think it's a problem even if you appoint counsel.
2007.07-440,1,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,1883.718,1889.934,"It happens all the time, Justice Scalia, where people are appointed counsel but, for whatever reason, do not make bail and--"
2007.07-440,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1889.934,1890.823,But they didn't... they don't--
2007.07-440,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1890.823,1892.165,Without charges filed?
2007.07-440,1,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,1910.251,1913.124,"--I think Gerstein would prevent that, Justice Souter."
2007.07-440,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1913.124,1924.324,"I mean, the answer... your answer is that the Sixth Amendment is concerned with the fair trial, not the detention of individuals, and he has other constitutional rights that would be implicated, but his right to a fair trial is not one of them."
2007.07-440,1,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,1924.324,1925.81,That's absolutely true here.
2007.07-440,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1925.81,1934.072,--What is the law here in Texas in respect to this particular magistration proceeding?
2007.07-440,1,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,2011.15,2017.803,I don't know the answer to the constitutional significance of the different--
2007.07-440,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2017.803,2029.594,"I could... I can think there would be tremendous constitutional significance and it would make a difference if all that's really happening is a policeman is arresting someone, in which case we might have liberty interests and others at issue."
2007.07-440,1,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,2047.291,2054.114,--What is stated on the form... certainly I can't say what was going through the magistrate's mind.
2007.07-440,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2054.114,2055.273,"No, no."
2007.07-440,1,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,2059.349,2064.878,The answer I believe is that you... that you find that there is probable cause to make the arrest.
2007.07-440,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2064.878,2070.842,"So we have a magistrate who has to find that there is... no, to make the arrest or to hold him now?"
2007.07-440,1,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,2071.982,2072.985,I do see what you're doing.
2007.07-440,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2072.985,2073.623,Do you see why I'm doing it?
2007.07-440,1,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,2075.764,2077.246,I don't think that there is a difference in this case.
2007.07-440,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2077.777,2080.417,"No, I know there may not be, but what about in general."
2007.07-440,1,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,2080.417,2092.303,"--Magistrates have a great amount of discretion, and I think if a magistrate was convinced that probable cause existed at the time of arrest and not now, it's quite likely the magistrate would find--"
2007.07-440,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2092.303,2092.88,Okay.
2007.07-440,1,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,2113.714,2115.247,--I believe so.
2007.07-440,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2117.95,2118.839,Thank you.
2007.07-440,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2118.839,2120.949,"Mr. Coleman, may I just ask this kind of simple question."
2007.07-440,1,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,2129.165,2130.849,"No, Justice Stevens."
2007.07-440,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2130.849,2134.41,Whether the prosecutor participates is not relevant?
2007.07-440,1,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,2134.41,2142.33,There is no role for a prosecutor at a magistration under Article 1517 of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure.
2007.07-440,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2142.33,2154.621,"Well, couldn't he point out... I mean, if this is a probable cause determination and he knows a particular fact, couldn't he say, well, Magistrate, you should know this, and the magistrate would say, well, I didn't know that, so there's no probable cause?"
2007.07-440,1,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,2154.621,2155.436,That's possible.
2007.07-440,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2198.073,2199.995,What about the very proceeding in this case?
2007.07-440,1,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,2215.27,2216.893,"--No, Justice Stevens."
2007.07-440,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2216.893,2217.957,It would not?
2007.07-440,1,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,2217.957,2220.284,An expression of subjective--
2007.07-440,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2220.284,2223.389,I got the impression from the briefs that the absence or presence of the prosecutor made a difference.
2007.07-440,1,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,2224.86,2239.384,"--Under the circumstances where no formal charges have been brought, a statement by a prosecutor that they are looking at it or that they intend to bring some is not itself the initiation of formal adversary judicial proceedings."
2007.07-440,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2239.384,2241.401,"Mr. Coleman, what happens in other jurisdictions?"
2007.07-440,1,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,2270.654,2275.93,An indictment does usually take a little bit more time because it has to be taken and presented to a grand jury.
2007.07-440,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2275.93,2276.854,So what happens in the interim?
2007.07-440,1,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,2288.098,2291.252,He is not charged during that interim.
2007.07-440,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2291.958,2295.159,You mean no complaint needs to be filed by the police?
2007.07-440,1,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,2317.803,2319.585,"--No, Justice Souter."
2007.07-440,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2331.893,2332.817,What was filed by the police?
2007.07-440,1,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,2334.205,2335.329,Nothing was filed.
2007.07-440,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2335.329,2338.421,--to justify holding this person?
2007.07-440,1,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,2345.591,2346.231,Yes.
2007.07-440,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2346.231,2357.427,--to show probable cause and it was the burden of the State in the presence of the police officer to prove probable cause.
2007.07-440,1,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,2360.644,2368.625,"It was based on the officer's affidavit of probable cause, which was presented at the little glass window to the magistrate and--"
2007.07-440,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2368.625,2373.937,And then... and then the defendant was told or was given Miranda warnings.
2007.07-440,1,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,2379.528,2381.291,"--Well, the warnings go through."
2007.07-440,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2397.693,2398.021,Yes.
2007.07-440,1,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,2409.999,2413.45,--I don't think that's what would happen.
2007.07-440,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2423.714,2426.37,Would they have been obligated to get somebody to come?
2007.07-440,1,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,2426.37,2428.288,--Under Texas statute they would.
2007.07-440,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2428.288,2429.743,Under the Sixth Amendment?
2007.07-440,1,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,2429.743,2430.226,No.
2007.07-440,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2430.226,2431.084,No.
2007.07-440,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2431.084,2440.299,Suppose Texas law provided that there had to be an examining trial within a certain period of time after the magistration unless there was an intervening indictment.
2007.07-440,1,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,2454.107,2472.333,"We completely agree that if that were the case, Coleman... this Court's decisions make absolutely clear he would have been entitled to counsel for an examining trial and would have been... we would have been obligated and would have appointed counsel at a reasonable time before that examining trial so that the preparations could take place."
2007.07-440,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2472.333,2483.08,"Why would the situation be different simply because Texas law doesn't require the examining trial, but gives the defendant the option of demanding one?"
2007.07-440,1,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,2483.08,2490.938,Because there is no prejudice to your fair trial rights from not choosing to have an examining trial.
2007.07-440,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2526.658,2543.976,"If we said that when a defendant is ordered held in custody, that there is then a right of counsel, would we be contradicting any of our precedents as opposed, say, to extending them?"
2007.07-440,1,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,2543.976,2548.569,I certainly do believe that the court would.
2007.07-440,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2562.642,2564.202,Well... no.
2007.07-440,1,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,2570.731,2579.87,It's not clear to me that that makes a constitutional difference in our circumstances.
2007.07-440,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2579.87,2603.97,"Suppose you were to say that where the State arrests an individual, brings him before a neutral official and intends and does impose a significant restraint on his liberty for the purpose of bringing that individual to trial, there is a presumption that that... forget the presumption."
2007.07-440,1,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,2658.819,2668.147,"I... I think the primary issue with that, Justice Breyer, is that it contradicts what the Court said in Gouveia."
2007.07-440,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2723.434,2741.567,"I thought you... I thought you recognized that if he had opted to have this examining trial to determine whether there really was probable cause, that he would be entitled to counsel at that examining trial."
2007.07-440,1,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,2747.908,2749.69,--No.
2007.07-440,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2843.087,2844.151,Only if they ask for them.
2007.07-440,1,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,2846.07,2847.93,--If they ask for them.
2007.07-440,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2847.93,2849.146,That's why I wondered--
2007.07-440,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2849.146,2857.175,"And that would be subject, wouldn't it, to sort of a condition subsequent, because if it turned out... I mean we... no counsel is required if there's no incarceration."

2007.07-440,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2886.461,2893.379,"And you couldn't... you couldn't because of the fact that bail... if you're going to insist on bail, that in effect is incarceration."
2007.07-440,1,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,2918.84,2928.911,"That amicus brief attempts to suggest that Texas's statute is very different from statutes that exist in other cases... in other States, and that's simply not true, Your Honor."
2007.07-440,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2947.812,2949.699,"You see, you would have given him a counsel."
2007.07-440,1,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,2959.23,2961.055,--You mean at the magistration?
2007.07-440,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2961.055,2961.586,--Yes.
2007.07-440,1,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,2961.586,2963.757,"If he would have asked for one, he would have gotten one."
2007.07-440,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2963.757,2968.101,So the problem I raise can't be a real problem.
2007.07-440,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2968.101,2971.677,--Let me ask on Texas procedure.
2007.07-440,1,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,2980.97,2982.782,"Absolutely not, Justice Stevens."
2007.07-440,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2988.968,2995.262,Let's say he wanted to get a release from bond and said he wanted to terminate his custody.
2007.07-440,1,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,3004.304,3008.238,"--A release from bond, it would have theoretically been possible, yes."
2007.07-440,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3008.238,3012.286,And could he have a lawyer appear before the Court to ask for that?
2007.07-440,1,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,3012.286,3013.831,I don't--
2007.07-440,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3013.831,3017.048,Could the judge say: You got to appear yourself?
2007.07-440,1,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,3017.048,3020.28,--I don't think the judge would have said: You have to appear yourself.
2007.07-440,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3024.231,3030.279,"If the prosecutor said: You are not entitled to a lawyer, wouldn't the judge have said: You're crazy; of course, he is entitled to a lawyer to come in for this proceeding?"
2007.07-440,1,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,3030.279,3035.305,"--Well, that's an issue that doesn't come up because judges don't exclude--"
2007.07-440,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3035.305,3042.46,"We are talking about theoretical problems here, and the question is whether he would he have had a right to a lawyer asking him to get released from bond."
2007.07-440,1,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,3050.677,3057.689,--The difference between the Sixth Amendment strict requirements and practicalities is a significant one.
2007.07-440,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3063.327,3065.074,Even though he is paying for his own lawyer?
2007.07-440,1,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,3065.074,3068.888,--It is the same as every other--
2007.07-440,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3068.888,3069.715,That's your answer?
2007.07-440,1,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,3069.715,3070.292,--situation.
2007.07-440,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3070.292,3076.882,He would not have had a right under the Constitution to have a lawyer come in and say: I want to get released from this bond.
2007.07-440,1,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,3081.43,3086.677,"He would have... he would have the same rights as anybody else, whether retained or--"
2007.07-440,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3086.677,3092.878,It would not include the right to be represented by counsel if I understand you correctly.
2007.07-440,1,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,3092.878,3099.015,--It would not be a Sixth Amendment right to counsel.
2007.07-440,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3112.367,3126.518,"Suppose that he is out on bail, but he has a suspicion that this alleged felony... that that wasn't cricket because it was expunged."
2007.07-440,1,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,3158.896,3166.754,"I think if... if he were to ask somebody, he would be told that you can ask for an examining trial."
2007.07-440,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3174.716,3175.203,Why is the--
2007.07-440,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3175.203,3176.919,"Now... no, please."
2007.07-440,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3176.919,3190.728,"--Why is the question of whether the right attaches, which seems to mean different things in different situations, a separate question from what I would think would be the question here: Whether he had the right to have counsel appointed for him."
2007.07-440,1,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,3202.989,3206.128,"I have given this great thought, Justice Alito."
2007.07-440,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3258.014,3259.854,Is it then episodic?
2007.07-440,1,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,3278.304,3291.468,"Once... once a case gets going, I don't believe this Court has ever been presented with a case where there has been attachment, there have been some critical stages, and then the State has decided to deny access."
2007.07-440,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3293.952,3303.323,"So you only need this one critical stage, and then you get appointed counsel at that stage, and that counsel will continue thereafter."
2007.07-440,1,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,3304.243,3306.773,--That is the usual course of things.
2007.07-440,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3306.773,3328.595,"Can you give me... can you give me some idea, or some empirical assessment, or tell me where I could go to find out, as we sit here, how many people are being held in custody after a probable-cause determination and do not have counsel appointed for them and do not have the right to have counsel appointed to them until some other critical phase takes place?"
2007.07-440,1,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,3328.595,3343.948,"In Texas, because the Fair Defense Act permits the appointment of counsel for those who are held in custody, all persons who request counsel are appointed counsel within one business day in the large counties and within one... within three business days in the smaller counties."
2007.07-440,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3344.525,3350.506,"So then there was just a misapplication of the statute here when this man was held for three days, and then he requested counsel?"
2007.07-440,1,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,3350.506,3350.912,--No.
2007.07-440,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3379.137,3383.368,"Well, I'm talking about the first phase before there was an indictment, just the probable-cause phase."
2007.07-440,1,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,3388.476,3390.539,The Texas statute authorizes appointment.
2007.07-440,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3395.269,3397.846,Then I am not sure why we are having this discussion.
2007.07-440,1,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,3397.846,3405.934,"--Well, because Mr. Rothgery was released on bail, and so the county was authorized not to appoint counsel."

2007.07-440,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3419.148,3425.395,"At that point, under Texas law, the right to counsel within one or three business days would have attached?"

2007.07-440,1,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,3457.868,3467.799,"--This Court in Coleman said that the examining trial, because of the potential harm to a fair trial in the future, would define it as a--"
2007.07-440,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3467.799,3479.888,"No, but I realize if the... if somebody is going to demonstrate probable cause, the probable cause has got to be probable cause to hold someone to answer for a particular charge."
2007.07-440,1,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,3488.588,3492.507,--An examining trial is an extended version of a probable-cause determination.
2007.07-440,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3493.915,3494.492,That is right.

2007.07-440,2,21594,danielle_spinelli,,3675.245,3687.571,"Well, I mean I think you are suggesting, Mr. Chief Justice, that reaffirming the rule adopted in Jackson would create, you know, a perverse incentive for States to do away with this proceeding."
2007.07-440,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3708.89,3711.733,"Well, what's in it for the State to provide this additional layer?"
2007.07-440,2,21594,danielle_spinelli,,3717.621,3736.737,"The initial appearance serves a specific, substantive purpose which I think is well described in the Seventh Circuit's decision in Armstrong cited on page 15 of our reply brief, which is this is the proceeding at which the defendant is informed: You are now a criminal defendant."
