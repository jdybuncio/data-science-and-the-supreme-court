1988.88-420,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.278,"We'll hear argument now on number 88-420, Jimmy Jones v. Larry P. Thomas."
1988.88-420,0,41483,stephen_d_hawke,,15.111,17.852,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1988.88-420,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,173.281,179.144,"Why was, why were these repeated actions taken after it had already been decided?"
1988.88-420,0,41483,stephen_d_hawke,,186.9,187.64,Okay.
1988.88-420,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,221.787,222.719,I guess you didn't understand my question.
1988.88-420,0,41483,stephen_d_hawke,,229.524,230.346,Okay.
1988.88-420,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,489.787,507.688,"Does that mean that if I get, if I get sentenced, uh, for a particular crime for five years, uh, and, uh, then under a statute that allows five to 20, and the trial judge later has second thoughts, uh, he can call me back and give me another 10?"
1988.88-420,0,41483,stephen_d_hawke,,509.52,512.323,--It depends on the context of what you are describing.
1988.88-420,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,512.323,515.436,Or even a different trial judge calls me back and gives me another 10.
1988.88-420,0,41483,stephen_d_hawke,,518.969,521.77,"I, I, that's, that is a close question."
1988.88-420,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,522.02,523.032,I don't think it's close at all.
1988.88-420,0,41483,stephen_d_hawke,,524.013,528.347,"--What you have, what you are looking at there is the, at the expectancy of the defendant."
1988.88-420,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,558.509,562.56,Expectancy is not to be punished a second time for the same offense.
1988.88-420,0,41483,stephen_d_hawke,,573.299,583.136,"In this particular case, when the defendant was sentenced, his expectancy was to serve 15 years imprisonment followed by a term of life imprisonment."
1988.88-420,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,587.451,597.778,"Expectancy for the defense was to serve 15 years or as much less as he could get off with if he, if he came under the Governor's commutation program."
1988.88-420,0,41483,stephen_d_hawke,,600.5,605.945,"--On this offense, when he was sentenced, he had the expectancy of serving 15 years followed by a life term."
1988.88-420,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,605.945,610.067,Not on the single offense.
1988.88-420,0,41483,stephen_d_hawke,,610.067,612.358,When he was sentenced.
1988.88-420,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,612.358,613.209,When he was sentenced.
1988.88-420,0,41483,stephen_d_hawke,,616.672,619.845,"He received two terms for the, uh, for the attempted robbery."
1988.88-420,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,657.511,659.471,"Well, I think we are playing games here."
1988.88-420,0,41483,stephen_d_hawke,,679.996,683.387,"--I, uh, I, I must respectfully disagree."
1988.88-420,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,710.187,719.634,"Mr. Hawke, may I, may I... supposing he had served the full 15 years on the armed robbery conviction and was one year into the life sentence in the time."
1988.88-420,0,41483,stephen_d_hawke,,731.822,741.058,"I do not believe so, Your Honor, because the state statute for attempted robbery set as a maximum sentence 15 years imprisonment."
1988.88-420,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,760.434,763.387,"Well, but, see here, isn't that what it, what happened here?"
1988.88-420,0,41483,stephen_d_hawke,,767.16,771.073,The attempted robbery conviction was what was set aside by the state court.
1988.88-420,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,771.073,775.247,"The murder conviction remains undisturbed, isn't that correct?"
1988.88-420,0,41483,stephen_d_hawke,,775.247,777.911,That is correct.
1988.88-420,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,837.042,838.504,"Well, but Lange stands for more than that."
1988.88-420,0,41483,stephen_d_hawke,,847.791,849.513,--There is language to that effect in--
1988.88-420,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,849.513,849.894,"Well, that's the holding."
1988.88-420,0,41483,stephen_d_hawke,,849.894,854.929,"--I, I must respectfully disagree with that, Your Honor."
1988.88-420,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,860.314,861.957,"Well, what did the case hold, do you think?"
1988.88-420,0,41483,stephen_d_hawke,,861.957,874.656,"I believe that the case hold, holding is the same as in Whalen, DiFrancesco and Hunter, that the sentencer cannot sentence a defendant to a term greater than what the legislature authorized."
1988.88-420,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,874.656,879.388,"And the reason it was greater is because there were two sentences, only one of which would have been authorized."
1988.88-420,0,41483,stephen_d_hawke,,879.388,880.089,That is correct.
1988.88-420,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,880.089,881.289,Wasn't that exactly what was true here?
1988.88-420,0,41483,stephen_d_hawke,,881.289,882.59,"No, that is not."
1988.88-420,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,882.59,886.394,"There are two sentences, only one of which would have been authorized, because it's only one offense."
1988.88-420,0,41483,stephen_d_hawke,,886.394,895.64,"But the amount of time that is authorized by the Missouri legislature is a term of life imprisonment for, for a murder conviction."
1988.88-420,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,900.204,902.004,Why can't you say the same thing about Lange?
1988.88-420,0,41483,stephen_d_hawke,,902.004,912.722,"In that situa... in that, in Lange, Your Honor, the defendant was sentenced to a term, uh, to a term of, uh, uh, of, uh, well, to a term and to a fine."
1988.88-420,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,912.722,913.472,Right.
1988.88-420,0,41483,stephen_d_hawke,,914.684,923.049,"And once he paid the fine, then, then the courts held that, that, that the defendant could not be required to serve prison time."
1988.88-420,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,923.65,929.685,Why is that different from serving 15 years when you are sentenced to both 15 years and life on just one offense?
1988.88-420,0,41483,stephen_d_hawke,,929.685,940.113,"--The key here, Your honor, I believe, is that the defendant, that the defendant's time for the attempted robbery charge was credited, once the attempted robbery sentence was vacated."
1988.88-420,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,953.282,956.064,"Well, that would be like saying we'll give you the $10 fine back."
1988.88-420,0,41483,stephen_d_hawke,,960.776,964.089,"--Well, that was the situation that the court was faced with in Bradley."
1988.88-420,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,965.501,968.333,"--question, isn't it?"
1988.88-420,0,41483,stephen_d_hawke,,968.333,974.256,--They gave an answer to that question that is inconsistent with this Court's jurisprudence with double jeopardy.
1988.88-420,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,974.256,975.817,"Well, but it gave the answer."
1988.88-420,0,41483,stephen_d_hawke,,977.85,993.81,"That is gave an answer and an answer that was unsupported by, by case law, except for the dicta in Lange and it provide, it provide, the holding, that particular holding in Bradley has not been followed by this Court since then."
1988.88-420,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,993.81,996.663,"It's never been expressly questioned, has it?"
1988.88-420,0,41483,stephen_d_hawke,,996.663,1000.436,"Uh, it has been expressly questioned by the lower courts."
1988.88-420,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1030.746,1034.819,"Well, may, may not Bradley have rested partly on the, on the statutory idea, too."
1988.88-420,0,41483,stephen_d_hawke,,1084.359,1086.96,"Uh, yes."
1988.88-420,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1088.18,1090.564,So they vacated a sentence that had fully been served at that time.
1988.88-420,0,41483,stephen_d_hawke,,1090.564,1092.124,"He, uh, that is correct."
1988.88-420,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1101.083,1101.985,I agree.
1988.88-420,0,41483,stephen_d_hawke,,1105.978,1113.562,"--It's a situation where Missouri remedies exist where defendants can vacate, uh, convictions that have already been served."
1988.88-420,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1301.752,1303.274,"Very well, Mr. Hawke."
1988.88-420,1,41034,springfield_baldwin,,1304.366,1317.125,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1988.88-420,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1360.966,1364.309,"There's a certain ludicrousness about what happened here, Mr. Baldwin."
1988.88-420,1,41034,springfield_baldwin,,1364.309,1365.461,Mr. Chief Justice--
1988.88-420,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1365.461,1367.391,I'm asking you a question.
1988.88-420,1,41034,springfield_baldwin,,1367.391,1368.363,"--I beg your pardon, sir."
1988.88-420,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1368.363,1376.858,"I said, there's a certain ludicrousness about what happened here, because the man was convicted of attempted robbery."
1988.88-420,1,41034,springfield_baldwin,,1390.698,1393.6,"Well, I would say this."
1988.88-420,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1533.546,1540.321,"Well, when a sentence is commuted, why is that, uh, equivalent to having the sentence be served?"
1988.88-420,1,41034,springfield_baldwin,,1545.674,1546.335,That is true.
1988.88-420,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1548.248,1557.255,"Suppose he'd begun, suppose he was serving the sentence for life first and the Governor said, by the way, I'm going to commute your second sentence."
1988.88-420,1,41034,springfield_baldwin,,1560.787,1562.089,"--Yes, I would."
1988.88-420,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1562.089,1563.068,Why?
1988.88-420,1,41034,springfield_baldwin,,1563.068,1565.471,Because the Governor says so.
1988.88-420,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1571.816,1575.208,"Well, perhaps I don't understand what a commutation is."
1988.88-420,1,41034,springfield_baldwin,,1578.751,1580.932,I would believe it is.
1988.88-420,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1581.383,1586.488,"Well, in this case it was commuted to time served, wasn't it?"
1988.88-420,1,41034,springfield_baldwin,,1586.488,1587.777,--I think that's true.
1988.88-420,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1587.777,1593.793,"That, that sounds to me, uh, in, as a distinction from a complete pardon."
1988.88-420,1,41034,springfield_baldwin,,1593.793,1596.772,"Yes, it was not a complete pardon."
1988.88-420,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1596.772,1606.71,The effect of it is is that the sentence simply doesn't have to be served.
1988.88-420,1,41034,springfield_baldwin,,1606.71,1607.531,That's right.
1988.88-420,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1607.531,1612.163,"Mr. Baldwin, how did these commutations come about?"
1988.88-420,1,41034,springfield_baldwin,,1619.189,1619.81,I do not know.
1988.88-420,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1730.826,1732.466,Follow up the law--
1988.88-420,1,41034,springfield_baldwin,,1751.52,1754.622,"--Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1988.88-420,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1924.279,1955.973,"What if the Supreme Court of Missouri had held in this case that, uh, that, uh, when you have a, uh, felony murder like this, uh, and there's a, and a jury is instructed that they can find one or the other or both, and the jury comes in and finds both, what if a, what if the Supreme Court of Missouri had decided that, that the, the man could only be sentenced to the life, to life imprisonment?"
1988.88-420,1,41034,springfield_baldwin,,1955.973,1957.572,I don't think it decided that.
1988.88-420,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1958.213,1958.564,"Well, know."
1988.88-420,1,41034,springfield_baldwin,,1961.134,1963.107,--Then he could only be sentenced to life imprisonment--
1988.88-420,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1963.107,1963.758,"Well, I know."
1988.88-420,1,41034,springfield_baldwin,,1983.452,1996.25,"--Well, if the Missouri Supreme Court had decided what you suggest, then it would be, uh, I think, a void sentence to sentence him, uh, for both."
1988.88-420,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1997.892,2001.004,"So the 15 year, the 15 year sentence would just have been void."
1988.88-420,1,41034,springfield_baldwin,,2001.004,2001.825,That's right.
1988.88-420,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2001.825,2002.095,Right.
1988.88-420,1,41034,springfield_baldwin,,2004.768,2024.36,"No, I don't, because it has been the precedent as set in Ex Parte Lange that the sentences in that case, the sentences in, in, uh, in re Bradley, the sentences in United States v. Benz, were voidable, not void."
1988.88-420,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2048.916,2049.427,Excuse me.
1988.88-420,1,41034,springfield_baldwin,,2053.61,2058.474,"--Then you're getting in, I believe, to a different class of cases."
1988.88-420,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2088.994,2097.101,"How much of that is double jeopardy, law, uh, Mr. Baldwin, and how much is just ordinary state criminal law or sentencing law?"
1988.88-420,1,41034,springfield_baldwin,,2097.101,2119.167,"I believe in those cases that Justice Scalla, I believe, inferentially referred to, that that is double jeopardy law, because I believe the, the defendants in those cases have maintained that the double jeopardy clause was being violated by the court not doing what they wanted."
1988.88-420,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2488.568,2491.82,"Very well, Mr. Baldwin."
1988.88-420,2,41483,stephen_d_hawke,,2494.091,2499.424,"Mr. Chief Justice, and say it please the Court:"
1988.88-420,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2567.861,2580.18,"Mr. Hawke, I suppose your case really depends upon whether that's really true, that all that the, all that the double jeopardy clause provides for is no more penalty than is authorized by the legislature."
1988.88-420,2,41483,stephen_d_hawke,,2596.734,2604.639,"The, the situation that you are describing refers to the expectancy of the defendant and a finality of the sentencing process."
1988.88-420,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2604.639,2604.979,That's right.
1988.88-420,2,41483,stephen_d_hawke,,2608.472,2622.553,"The, the Court discussed this in DiFrancesco, and in the situation here, you either have, you have a defendant's subjective expectation at the time of sentencing that he's going to serve 15 years followed by a life sentence."
1988.88-420,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2670.425,2674.699,"You, you, you may be right about that, Mr. Hawke, but how does that respond to Justice Scalla's question?"
1988.88-420,2,41483,stephen_d_hawke,,2685.284,2695.522,"--The discussion, I think in DiFrancesco and in Whalen and in Hunter focus primarily upon the intent of the legislature in the punishment process."
1988.88-420,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2702.265,2706.979,"So, it's in other words, you do concede that we have to do more than just look at what the maximum sentence the legislature authorizes?"
1988.88-420,2,41483,stephen_d_hawke,,2706.979,2708.77,"--Uh, that is uncertain."
1988.88-420,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2712.904,2717.778,"Well, I think maybe you have to look at more than just his expectations plus the legislature's intent as well."
1988.88-420,2,41483,stephen_d_hawke,,2732.499,2733.898,"That's a hard case, Your Honor."
1988.88-420,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2733.898,2737.161,"Well, it tests whether his expectations are what govern."
1988.88-420,2,41483,stephen_d_hawke,,2748.159,2759.675,"And in response to that, I do not believe that the Court should, should examine the, uh, the case under the double jeopardy clause in a technical manner."
1988.88-420,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2850.098,2851.869,"Thank you, Mr. Hawke."
