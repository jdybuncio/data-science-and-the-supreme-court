2019.19-635,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,8.36,"We'll hear argument next in Case 19-635, Donald Trump versus Cyrus Vance. Mr. Sekulow."
2019.19-635,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,8.36,19.88,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: No county district attorney in our nation's history has issued criminal process against a sitting President of the United States, and for good reason."
2019.19-635,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,131.76,139.88,"Counsel, for all that, you don't argue that the grand jury cannot investigate the President, do you?"
2019.19-635,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,139.88,152.4,"We did not seek to have an injunction, as was the case involving Vice President Agnew, in enjoining the grand jury. We have targeted the utilization of the temporary immunity here to the subpoena."
2019.19-635,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,154.12,165.0,"Well, in other words, it's okay for the grand jury to investigate, except it can't use the traditional and most effective device that grand juries have typically used, which is the subpoena."
2019.19-635,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,165.0,169.32,It can't use a subpoena targeting the President.
2019.19-635,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,178.0,193.28,I don't understand -- I don't understand -- your theory in terms of distraction and all that would seem to go much farther than resisting the subpoena. I don't know why you don't resist the investigation in its entirety or why your theory wouldn't lead to that.
2019.19-635,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,193.28,214.64,"Well, our -- our position is that criminal process against the President -- and that's what we're talking about, that's what's before the Court -- criminal process targeting the President is a violation of the Constitution. We did not seek to enforce an injunction or seek an injunction against the grand jury investigating the situation with the President."
2019.19-635,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,215.48,217.56,You focused -- you focused on --
2019.19-635,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,217.56,217.76,Yes.
2019.19-635,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,217.76,220.64,"-- you focused on the distraction to the President, but --"
2019.19-635,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,220.64,220.76,Yes.
2019.19-635,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,220.76,246.84,"-- I don't know why -- in -- in Clinton versus Jones, we were not persuaded that the distraction in that case meant that discovery could not proceed. And, you know, there are different things that distract different people, but I would have thought the discovery in a case like Clinton versus Jones, even though civil, would be distracting as you argue the grand jury proceedings are here."
2019.19-635,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,246.84,251.12,"Well, Clinton versus Jones, of course, was in federal court."
2019.19-635,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,281.92,283.28,Justice Thomas?
2019.19-635,0,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,283.28,288.44,"Yes, counsel, just a couple of questions."
2019.19-635,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,302.32,303.72,"Well, there -- there's a couple."
2019.19-635,0,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,356.88,361.76,Does it make a difference when a subpoena goes to a third-party?
2019.19-635,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,361.76,366.64,"Certainly not here. Number one, they've -- the Respondents have either forfeited or waived it."
2019.19-635,0,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,381.64,383.68,Thank you.
2019.19-635,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,383.68,384.84,"Thank you, Justice Thomas."
2019.19-635,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,384.84,386.36,Justice Ginsburg?
2019.19-635,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,386.36,396.4,We have said in the grand jury context that the public has a right to every man's evidence.
2019.19-635,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,453.32,465.88,"Well, this -- to the second question first, if I might, Justice Ginsburg, this Court in Clinton against Jones said that if the case was brought in state court it would raise different issues of concerns over local prejudice."
2019.19-635,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,508.04,509.76,Justice Breyer?
2019.19-635,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,509.76,515.36,Every -- every man's evidence excludes the President?
2019.19-635,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,515.36,520.8,"If I may, Mr. Chief Justice. Justice Ginsburg, it's not that it excludes every -- the President."
2019.19-635,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,529.36,529.4,Justice --
2019.19-635,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,529.4,531.52,-- by the Constitution. Thank you.
2019.19-635,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,531.52,531.96,Justice Breyer?
2019.19-635,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,531.96,537.16,"Well, you make a point of the 2300 district attorneys."
2019.19-635,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,548.8,549.08,Well --
2019.19-635,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,549.08,560.64,Why isn't it sufficient just to apply ordinary standards? I gather ordinarily any person who gets a subpoena can come in and say it's unduly burdensome.
2019.19-635,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,605.04,609.52,"Justice Breyer, the hypothetical you just gave, I think, proves the point."
2019.19-635,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,639.48,643.32,"No, he would hire you and he'd hire a lawyer to list what the burdens are."
2019.19-635,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,656.72,658.8,"Well, I would point the Court --"
2019.19-635,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,658.8,659.36,You say there are.
2019.19-635,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,659.36,659.6,I --
2019.19-635,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,659.6,662.12,So send it back and let them figure out what they are.
2019.19-635,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,662.12,701.64,"I think doing that establishes the problem with an analysis, a case-by-case analysis. For instance, in this very case in this subpoena found on page 118a and 19 of the Petition Appendix, there's a list of documents that are extensive. You would have to meet with the President of the United States -- I mean, could you imagine just for a moment, Justice Breyer, that I -- and you said he -- let's assume the President were to hire me -- that I'm going to call the President of the United States today and say, I know you're handling a pandemic right now for the United States, but I need to spend a couple, two to three hours with you going over a subpoena of documents that are wanted by, here, the New York County District Attorney."
2019.19-635,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,702.28,702.84,"Thank you, counsel."
2019.19-635,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,702.84,704.28,-- but you -- can you carve me out two hours.
2019.19-635,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,704.28,705.24,Justice -- Justice -- Justice Alito?
2019.19-635,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,705.24,748.6,"Aren't there at least some circumstances in which the U.S. Constitution would permit a local prosecutor to subpoena records containing information about a sitting president? So think of this situation. Suppose that the prosecutor has good reason to believe that the records contain information that is not available from any other source about whether a third-party committed a crime, and suppose that waiting until the end of the President's term would make the prosecution of that crime impossible or at least very difficult. Would you say that at least in that circumstance it would be permissible for the grand jury subpoena to be enforced?"
2019.19-635,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,748.6,764.32,"In a -- in a state court proceeding, the -- the issues of time and burden are still there. Now, in U.S. v. Nixon, that was a case where the President was a witness and the documents were asked for and this Court said should be handed over."
2019.19-635,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,790.52,801.6,"Well, was the answer that that would be permissible if the prosecutor were willing to say that the President was not a target, whatever that means?"
2019.19-635,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,801.6,807.0,"Well, it wouldn't mean that it's constitutionally permissible; it would raise different issues for the President to consider."
2019.19-635,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,825.0,826.96,Thank you.
2019.19-635,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,826.96,832.24,"Thank you, counsel. Justice Sotomayor?"
2019.19-635,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,832.24,848.48,"Counsel, it seems that you're asking for a broadness of -- of immunity that Justice Thomas pointed out is nowhere in the Constitution. And, in fact, the Constitution protects against presidential interference with state criminal proceedings."
2019.19-635,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,909.08,910.56,Even if you were to assume that --
2019.19-635,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,910.56,911.6,And doesn't -- if you let me finish.
2019.19-635,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,911.6,911.8,"Yes, please."
2019.19-635,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,911.8,923.24,"And doesn't the President always have the opportunity to show that a particular subpoena, in fact, was issued in bad faith? The President was given that opportunity here."
2019.19-635,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,949.36,951.2,"Well, he's the President of the United States."
2019.19-635,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,954.68,965.96,We only give -- we only give judicial officers and congressional officers immunity for acts within their official capacity.
2019.19-635,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,988.24,989.6,"Well, we're asking for a temporary --"
2019.19-635,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,989.6,992.24,"You have time for -- you have time for a brief answer, counsel."
2019.19-635,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,992.24,992.76,I will.
2019.19-635,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1013.0,1014.04,Justice Kagan?
2019.19-635,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1014.04,1023.04,"So, Mr. Sekulow, you've said that a number of times and made the point, which we have made, that presidents can't be treated just like an ordinary citizen."
2019.19-635,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,1077.44,1079.08,For two reasons.
2019.19-635,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1122.36,1123.24,Justice Gorsuch?
2019.19-635,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1123.24,1157.12,"Counsel, I -- I'd like to return to the question of Clinton versus Jones and how you would have us distinguish it. Yes, it took place in federal court, but it was a civil case, and as has been pointed out, others -- there could have been multiple versions of that in multiple different districts across the country. So what's -- what's different about that? How do we avoid the conclusion there that the President wasn't subject to some special immunity but here is?"
2019.19-635,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,1157.12,1162.96,I think -- I think the nature of the case that we're dealing with here is not in a vacuum itself.
2019.19-635,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1210.96,1211.24,How --
2019.19-635,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,1211.24,1214.4,-- the burdensome nature of what's happening here.
2019.19-635,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1214.4,1221.08,"-- how is -- how is this more burdensome, though, than what took place in Clinton versus Jones? I -- I guess I'm -- I'm not sure I understand that."
2019.19-635,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,1221.08,1231.36,"Well, I mean, there's a big distinction between a defendant in a civil case and a principal in a criminal case, here by the state district -- or the local DA."
2019.19-635,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1231.36,1232.32,Let me stop you there.
2019.19-635,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,1232.32,1232.6,Yes.
2019.19-635,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1232.6,1237.88,"Yes, there -- there -- there, they sought the deposition of the President while he was serving."
2019.19-635,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,1241.6,1244.6,"But they're his records from third-parties, Justice Gorsuch."
2019.19-635,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1282.4,1284.68,Justice Kavanaugh?
2019.19-635,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1284.68,1290.0,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. And good afternoon, Mr. Sekulow."
2019.19-635,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,1290.0,1293.08,Good afternoon.
2019.19-635,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1293.08,1302.92,"Just following up on Justice Gorsuch, just explain, if you can, the rationale for having one rule for criminal and another rule for civil."
2019.19-635,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,1306.08,1307.64,Well --
2019.19-635,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1307.64,1311.92,And just explain the rationale for a different rule there.
2019.19-635,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,1311.92,1326.76,"Well, it's not that it's a different rule because, in this case, because it's within the context of a state proceeding, you have Article II concerns and the Supremacy Clause issues, as this Court alluded to in Clinton against Jones, that create the issues of concern about local prejudice."
2019.19-635,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1334.64,1335.68,Why -- why is that?
2019.19-635,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,1335.68,1368.44,"Well, the idea that you are the subject or a target of a criminal case being brought against you is very different than a civil suit, where, at the end of the day, it results in monetary damages, not -- not a loss of liberty. So there's a big distinction between a civil case and a criminal case in that regard. And I think that impacts the -- the standard upon which this Court should be looking at the President's temporary presidential immunity. We're talking about stopping a process targeting the President, this subpoena targeting the President."
2019.19-635,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1374.24,1385.4,I think the other side says that the position you're articulating is a bit more consistent with Justice Breyer's concurrence in Clinton versus Jones than with the majority opinion.
2019.19-635,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,1405.36,1407.64,"Well, I think that civil discovery --"
2019.19-635,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1407.64,1412.64,-- that part of Clinton versus Jones?
2019.19-635,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,1412.64,1438.0,"-- versus criminal process is -- are two very distinct processes. And in a -- in a civil context, in a civil proceeding, there's a -- we have the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure in the federal court that govern how that process goes forward, and federal judges can take into various considerations, especially dealing with the President. This is a state proceeding initiated by the local district attorney against a sitting President of the United States."
2019.19-635,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1446.6,1447.16,How do you deal --
2019.19-635,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,1447.16,1447.6,-- would be violated --
2019.19-635,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1447.6,1448.6,Sorry to interrupt.
2019.19-635,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,1448.6,1449.24,"No, please,"
2019.19-635,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1449.24,1452.76,How do you deal with statute of limitations issues?
2019.19-635,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,1452.76,1467.44,"Well, statute of limitations issues, of course, are decided under New York state law, and under New York state law, there would be procedures that could be utilized if, in fact, the DA were to elect to -- to start a process like that or if there were to eventually be action. But I -- I need to say something."
2019.19-635,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1467.44,1469.16,"Thank you. Thank you, counsel."
2019.19-635,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,1469.16,1470.2,"Yes, thank you."
2019.19-635,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1472.08,1475.88,General Francisco.
2019.19-635,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1475.88,1495.28,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: At a minimum, a local prosecutor should have to show he really needs the President's personal records to subpoena them for two reasons. First, as the Court suggested in Clinton against Jones, state proceedings can pose a greater threat to the presidency."
2019.19-635,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1545.12,1556.92,"General Francisco, we -- we just heard Mr. Sekulow argue in favor of an absolute standard, no circumstances, no how."
2019.19-635,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1576.52,1583.48,"Your Honor, I actually think that Mr. Sekulow makes a very strong argument on the immunity issue."
2019.19-635,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1615.88,1641.36,"Well, in a -- in a typical case, with adequate allegations to say that the standard's implicated, you would say that it goes before a court and the court will examine whether or not the criteria you -- you talk about, which I gather is the test under Nixon, are met, and, under Mr. Sekulow's standard, the -- would not immediately go before the court."
2019.19-635,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1650.08,1658.92,"Well, Your Honor, I think that in both instances the argument would be available to an article -- you -- you would be able to make that argument to an Article II federal court."
2019.19-635,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1687.96,1692.0,"Thank you, counsel. Justice Thomas?"
2019.19-635,1,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,1692.0,1692.6,Yes.
2019.19-635,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1706.28,1716.08,"Well, Your Honor, here, I think there are a couple of things that you can take into account. First, the fact that we're in state court, I think, is quite significant."
2019.19-635,1,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,1825.96,1826.64,Thank you.
2019.19-635,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1826.64,1829.84,Justice Ginsburg?
2019.19-635,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1829.84,1869.0,"You stress that the states are subordinate sovereigns, so -- and so they are subject to the Supremacy Clause, but you don't give any credit at all to the Tenth Amendment and the reserve powers of the state. That's one question that I have. And the -- as far as the impact of the President is concerned, I think there's no case more dramatic than the Nixon tapes' devastating impact on the President."
2019.19-635,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1876.32,1878.92,"So, Your Honor --"
2019.19-635,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1878.92,1879.88,Yes.
2019.19-635,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1879.88,1892.28,"So, Your Honor, in -- in terms of the Tenth Amendment, all we're saying is that Article II vests all executive power in a single President of the United States."
2019.19-635,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1956.24,1956.64,May I --
2019.19-635,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1956.64,1957.08,"Yes, Your Honor."
2019.19-635,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1957.08,1961.16,The grand jury is an investigatory body.
2019.19-635,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1986.84,1988.92,"Your Honor, respectfully, no."
2019.19-635,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2018.64,2023.04,Justice Breyer?
2019.19-635,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2023.04,2030.64,"Yes, thank you. General, I -- I think that the Nixon tape case has one thing for you, one thing against you."
2019.19-635,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,2061.64,2062.32,Your Honor --
2019.19-635,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2062.32,2067.92,-- you would need a decision by us that it's reviewable in federal court.
2019.19-635,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,2077.04,2081.28,"Your Honor, you are absolutely correct that, at a minimum, we would need federal court review."
2019.19-635,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2110.76,2114.16,"Well, wasn't that in the context of the assertion of executive privilege?"
2019.19-635,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,2114.16,2116.76,"Excuse me, Your Honor?"
2019.19-635,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2116.76,2121.4,Wasn't that in the context of an assertion by the President of executive privilege?
2019.19-635,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,2121.4,2126.72,"Yes, Your Honor, it was, but litigation about private conduct is also burdensome."
2019.19-635,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2179.12,2183.88,"Thank you, counsel. Justice Alito?"
2019.19-635,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2183.88,2223.4,"General, could you explain in more specific terms how you think this showing of special need would be carried out in district court? I assume that the prosecutor would have to make some kind of -- would have to reveal what was being investigated and why this particular information was needed for or essential for the investigation. Now would that be done -- would that be reviewed by the judge ex parte? Would it be available to whoever the sitting President is to object to that, to review it and object to it?"
2019.19-635,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,2223.4,2298.56,"Your Honor, it's difficult to answer that question in a vacuum because I think it would very much depend on the particular case, but let me make my best stab at it. I think that in order to have meaningful judicial review, you would need -- the prosecutor would need to make public as much as could responsibly be made public so that the President would have an opportunity and the President's lawyers would have an opportunity to make their case on the particular facts. If there is a certain amount of evidence that really cannot responsibly be made public, then I think it would be appropriate to consider ex parte proceedings or filings under seal. In all events, we think that that's the type of assessment that needs to be made when you're talking about subpoenas, unprecedented subpoenas like this one, that are from state and local prosecutors targeting the President of the United States. The other place I would point you to is, again, Judge Wall's -- Wald's very good opinion for the D.C. Circuit in the In Re Sealed Case, where she does walk through in some amount of detail and unpack how the special needs standard applies to grand jury subpoenas."
2019.19-635,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2298.56,2314.8,"How essential must the information be in order to meet this special needs standard? Does it have to be absolutely indispensable, not available from any other source by any conceivable means, or simply very useful?"
2019.19-635,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,2314.8,2330.88,"Your Honor, it's probably somewhere in between those two things. I think it's got to be -- I think it's got to be critical to the charging decision, so it can't just be marginally useful or, you know, merely duplicative or -- or interesting to a tangential side issue."
2019.19-635,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2351.44,2358.0,"Thank you, counsel. Justice Sotomayor?"
2019.19-635,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2358.0,2455.48,"General, there's always danger in taking a doctrine adopted for one set of needs, and that has to do with needs that are balancing what is clearly recognized in law as executive privilege versus the needs for the proceeding at issue, and transplanting it to a situation that's totally different, where we're not talking about a claim of executive privilege, and we're not talking of executive immunity; we're talking about private activities that predated the President's tenure. So why are we using all that transplanted language, and why don't we get to a standard that takes care of what you're worried about, which is harassment and interference, and simply ask whether the investigation is based on credible suspicion of criminal activity and whether the subpoena is reasonably calculated to advance that investigation, a standard that looks to whether there is a good-faith basis for the state prosecutor's actions and whether the subpoena is reasonable in its scope and burdens? I don't understand why that sort of standard is inadequate, especially for a proceeding that involves secrecy, like a grand jury subpoena."
2019.19-635,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,2455.48,2460.2,"For two reasons, Your Honor."
2019.19-635,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2516.96,2520.44,"Thank you, counsel. Justice Kagan?"
2019.19-635,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2520.44,2542.28,"So, General, a couple of times now, in response to Justice Breyer and Justice Sotomayor, you've explained why we should use the standard from executive privilege cases by saying, well, litigation about private conduct is also burdensome. But the point about executive privilege cases is not that it's burdensome."
2019.19-635,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,2571.04,2576.44,"Respectfully, Your Honor, because I think that there are parallel interests."
2019.19-635,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2606.88,2607.6,"But, again, General --"
2019.19-635,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,2607.6,2609.6,-- when you look at Article II --
2019.19-635,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2609.6,2613.8,-- you don't need the -- the -- this heightened standard in order to take account of burdensomeness.
2019.19-635,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,2639.84,2641.68,"For two reasons, Your Honor."
2019.19-635,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2685.56,2687.04,"Thank you, counsel. Justice Gorsuch?"
2019.19-635,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2687.04,2725.16,"Counsel, I -- I'd like to just explore a little further how this standard would -- that you're proposing would play out in practice. I -- I suppose you'd have a local prosecutor saying, I'm investigating a tax infraction, and the best and maybe only evidence of -- of -- of that potential infraction are the tax records in the possession of the -- of the potential defendant. Why wouldn't that meet the special heightened test that you've proposed in every case? And if that -- if that -- if it does, then what -- what have we achieved?"
2019.19-635,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,2725.16,2729.08,"Well, Your Honor, I think it would depend on who the potential defendant is."
2019.19-635,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2764.84,2767.44,I -- I guess I didn't follow that last portion of it.
2019.19-635,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,2779.84,2780.88,Right.
2019.19-635,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2780.88,2784.28,Why wouldn't that qualify under your standard?
2019.19-635,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,2784.28,2788.16,I think that would certainly be a relevant thing to take into account under our standard.
2019.19-635,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2804.52,2805.32,How much --
2019.19-635,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,2805.32,2806.2,In this particular --
2019.19-635,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2806.2,2816.72,"-- how much showing of special need is required under your -- under your standard? A prosecutor says, I have some -- some reasonable suspicion that there's a tax deficiency by some entity."
2019.19-635,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,2820.12,2822.36,"Your Honor, I think it -- I think it's more than that."
2019.19-635,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2851.44,2852.8,"Thank you, counsel. Justice Kavanaugh?"
2019.19-635,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2852.8,2856.52,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. And good afternoon, General Francisco."
2019.19-635,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,2856.52,2857.24,"Good afternoon, Your Honor."
2019.19-635,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2857.24,2904.08,"I want to follow -- I want to follow up on Justice Thomas and Justice Kagan and really zero in on what the Article II interest is before we talk about what standard. And I think, in Justice Breyer's concurrence in Clinton against Jones, he referred to the interest in time and energy distraction, which he drew from Nixon versus Fitzgerald, a different Nixon case, as an independent Article II interest that is distinct from distortion of official decision-making, which would be more the executive privilege kind of interest. Is that the Article II interest you're zeroing in on, or is it something else?"
2019.19-635,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,2904.08,2906.52,"Well, Your Honor, respectfully, I think it's both of them."
2019.19-635,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2963.64,2970.88,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Dunne."
2019.19-635,2,63243,carey_r_dunne,,2970.88,2975.32,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: There are two principles at issue in this case."
2019.19-635,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3102.72,3129.44,"Thank you, counsel. You know, we've had the cases this morning and this case and they are in many respects very similar in -- on -- in the case of the subpoena itself, they're identical, but I think in other respects they're really quite different. The separation of powers case this morning involved entities in an ongoing relationship, the House and the President."
2019.19-635,2,63243,carey_r_dunne,,3193.96,3198.56,"Your Honor, I think our answer to that is yes."
2019.19-635,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3256.16,3268.92,Would you articulate for me precisely what standard you think should apply in your case and in what sense is it more rigorous than that would apply in the dispute between the White House and Congress?
2019.19-635,2,63243,carey_r_dunne,,3268.92,3270.32,Yes.
2019.19-635,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3334.64,3336.28,Justice -- Justice Thomas?
2019.19-635,2,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,3336.28,3346.56,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Mr. Dunne, you were about to say how DOJ's approach would harm the grand jury process."
2019.19-635,2,63243,carey_r_dunne,,3348.16,3348.52,Yes.
2019.19-635,2,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,3436.68,3442.44,So what -- what limits a grand jury process in -- in New York? What are the limits?
2019.19-635,2,63243,carey_r_dunne,,3442.44,3447.72,"Well, the limits are, I think, the same basically as they are in federal court and most other states, Your Honor."
2019.19-635,2,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,3500.76,3516.72,"What if you thought it was -- the President said it was impossible for him to do his job, as opposed to just being burdened? Would that -- would we have a role to limit or somehow end the grand jury process?"
2019.19-635,2,63243,carey_r_dunne,,3516.72,3518.6,"Absolutely, Your Honor."
2019.19-635,2,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,3571.76,3572.08,Thank you.
2019.19-635,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3572.08,3572.68,Justice Ginsburg?
2019.19-635,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3572.68,3586.04,"The principal objections that have been raised is that when you're dealing with federal prosecutions, it's all controlled by the attorney general."
2019.19-635,2,63243,carey_r_dunne,,3617.16,3625.4,"I understand, Your Honor, and I think really what that gets centrally to is the consistent argument here about the parade of horribles, if you will."
2019.19-635,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3731.44,3735.76,Thank you.
2019.19-635,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3735.76,3739.92,Justice Breyer?
2019.19-635,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3739.92,3756.32,"Well, thank you. What -- what -- I agree with you that the two basic principles you said at the outcome are there: every man's evidence versus the constitutional statement that the President is the executive, Article II."
2019.19-635,2,63243,carey_r_dunne,,3765.28,3771.72,"Your Honor, I -- I think that I would say they don't conflict, but, yes, they're in tension in our view."
2019.19-635,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3771.72,3773.6,They're in tension. Fine.
2019.19-635,2,63243,carey_r_dunne,,3827.16,3877.2,"Well, Your Honor, I think what you're describing is exactly what this Court held in -- in Clinton, and it's exactly, frankly, what has happened now in this case, which is, yes, in this case, the -- the President decided to pursue his -- his claim of immunity in federal court versus state court, which is fine and now available, I think, in the future to all presidents. But I think the -- the fact that that is, you know, what happened -- should happen in the ordinary course and which can happen in the ordinary course is, again, the solution and the limiting principle here, because it does -- it'll make it clear that there is a remedy and discourages, I would have thought, bad-faith impulses by any state or local prosecutor who might harbor such an impulse and provides an outlet that makes sure that it -- it can't get out of control. But, again, that's the beauty of the case-specific analysis."
2019.19-635,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3885.32,3885.8,Thank you.
2019.19-635,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3885.8,3887.88,Justice Alito?
2019.19-635,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3887.88,3906.04,"As I understand your proposed standard, there would be available review in federal court, and the prosecutor would have to show an objective basis for the subpoena and the relevance of the subpoena to the investigation."
2019.19-635,2,63243,carey_r_dunne,,3908.04,3910.92,"Basically, Your Honor, language like that."
2019.19-635,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3916.72,3918.96,"Okay, reasonable probability."
2019.19-635,2,63243,carey_r_dunne,,3952.44,4012.04,"Your Honor, I, frankly, don't think that any of those concepts are foreign to the standard that I -- I articulated. And I think they are relevant, in fact, to the objective basis and -- and relevance points. You know, here, for example, and -- and -- and, again, I think the court -- the court below, the district court in particular, you know, heard our explanations, and including the fact that, you know, the reason why we went to Mazars is not to do an end run around negotiations with the President's lawyers. It's because Mazars, as the outside accounting firm, is -- is, as far as we could tell, the only repository of what might be the most important documents in an investigation like this, which are not just the tax returns but the surrounding accounting materials and work papers, et cetera, which shed light on the good faith or not of the transaction. So my short answer, I'm sorry, is that I think those -- those concepts are -- are -- are -- would be fine and not unduly burdensome in the -- in the context of the standard that I set forth."
2019.19-635,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,4012.04,4033.56,"Can I ask you one other thing? Do you think that the adjudication of this in all cases of a similar nature would depend in any way on state law and practice regarding grand jury secrecy? In federal court, the rules of grand jury secrecy are, of course, very strict. States have different rules."
2019.19-635,2,63243,carey_r_dunne,,4048.16,4055.8,"Well, Your Honor, I'm not aware of any other states having that kind of lax or nonexistent grand jury secrecy rule."
2019.19-635,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,4101.52,4124.16,"I mean, we both know that prosecutors have different -- that -- that there are prosecutors who leak all sorts of information, including grand jury information, to all sorts of media sources, including specifically The -- The New York Times. If -- if there were a showing that that was a risk, would that have a bearing on this?"
2019.19-635,2,63243,carey_r_dunne,,4124.16,4158.04,"Your Honor, it's hard for me to -- I'm -- I'm -- I'm not aware of any kind of real pattern or practice of leaking of actual grand jury materials that are covered by grand jury secrecy. Yes, in all -- all different kinds of offices there are at times, you know, leaks of status of cases and that kind of thing, but I -- I am not aware, and -- and -- and our grand jury secrecy rules really prevent prosecutors, I believe, from, you know, actually turning over confidential grand jury secrecy materials to --"
2019.19-635,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,4158.04,4171.2,You're not aware -- you're not aware of this ever happening? Your office is never requested by media in the New York City area to disclose confidential investigative information?

2019.19-635,2,63243,carey_r_dunne,,4209.32,4212.52,"Yes, Your Honor, I would certainly include that there."
2019.19-635,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,4225.88,4226.2,Thank you.

2019.19-635,2,63243,carey_r_dunne,,4242.6,4259.8,"No, Your Honor, I was -- I was -- I think we're all now calling it the heightened showing standard or, in the DOJ's lexicon now, the heightened need standard, but I think what I'm articulating is a very different standard in terms of the actual language to be looked at and -- and imposed. Again, I think that --"
2019.19-635,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,4259.8,4260.36,Wait.
2019.19-635,2,63243,carey_r_dunne,,4280.28,4281.88,"I'm -- I'm sorry, Justice Sotomayor."
2019.19-635,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,4318.16,4320.24,All right.
2019.19-635,2,63243,carey_r_dunne,,4325.48,4336.24,"Well, I think, Your Honor, among other things, the -- the DOJ's proposed application of its standard, if you read its brief, would confer the same absolute immunity the President is seeking here."
2019.19-635,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,4363.4,4365.52,Why not?
2019.19-635,2,63243,carey_r_dunne,,4365.52,4401.96,"Because -- well, obviously, Your Honor, if we were to wait until a President was out of office in a situation like this, first, it would risk the loss of evidence, the fading of memories, and unavailability of witnesses, which is exactly what the DOJ Moss memo, of course, specifically contemplated that a President could be subject to a grand jury while in office to avoid losing that kind of evidence. Secondly and equally important here, no one should forget that we've got an investigation that -- that is, you know, looking at the conduct of other people and businesses. And waiting like that would benefit those other participants."
2019.19-635,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,4417.48,4423.68,"Well, but the other side says the statute would be tolled against the President."
2019.19-635,2,63243,carey_r_dunne,,4432.8,4433.24,Correct.
2019.19-635,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4495.0,4496.56,Justice Kagan?
2019.19-635,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,4496.56,4517.84,"Mr. Dunne, you've been talking about how to analyze these burdens in a case-specific way, the burdens both in terms of the President's time and in terms of any possibility of harassment of the use of a subpoena for political purposes. Mr. Sekulow said that the burdensome nature of these subpoenas is categorical."
2019.19-635,2,63243,carey_r_dunne,,4533.4,4566.2,"Your Honor, I -- I -- may I make three points? I think the fact is that this -- the Court addressed this question, I think, in Clinton and concluded that a President can't realistically be shielded from every sort of private distraction, including some forms of legal process, especially in our modern age. So that's why it's up to a court to evaluate and protect the President, depending on the circumstances, on a case-by-case basis. Secondly, here, the claim of, you know, the possible mental distraction is extreme -- completely speculative really."
2019.19-635,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,4623.76,4629.88,And -- and speculative mental distress -- how about if they really mean political undermining?
2019.19-635,2,63243,carey_r_dunne,,4629.88,4653.56,"Well, I mean, if -- that -- that's beyond the ken of our office, Your Honor, and -- and as, again, the district court found, there was no bad faith intended by virtue of our -- our subpoena. So I don't know -- we've -- it's already been determined here there's no intent to politically undermine, so I don't know how a court could try to evaluate that, and I'm not sure that would be appropriate, unless -- unless it's --"
2019.19-635,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,4653.56,4662.24,Mr. Sekulow -- Mr. Sekulow suggests that you've shown your bad faith by taking the language of the House Oversight Committee's subpoena.
2019.19-635,2,63243,carey_r_dunne,,4662.24,4664.4,"Yes, Your Honor, and I think we've -- we're tried to address that."
2019.19-635,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,4721.88,4722.36,Thank you.
2019.19-635,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4722.36,4722.96,Justice Gorsuch?
2019.19-635,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,4722.96,4774.2,"Counsel, I'd like to return to your colloquy with Justices Alito and Sotomayor, because I guess I'm uncertain what the daylight is between the test you're proposing and the test the Solicitor General has suggested. It seems like both of you agree that these questions should be resolved in federal court, and you've suggested that there is -- prosecutors should have to be -- demonstrate an objective basis for the investigation and that there's at least a reasonable probability that the information sought will be helpful to that investigation, that it can't be obtained elsewhere and that it's needed now rather than at the end of -- of the President's term because of some serious prejudice that might take place in between. As I understood your discussion with Justice Sotomayor, you -- you suggested that the difference is the Solicitor General thinks there should be an absolute immunity until the end of the term."
2019.19-635,2,63243,carey_r_dunne,,4790.76,4824.08,"I think, Your Honor, putting aside the -- the language differences, which I tried to highlight, I think the most important distinction is what I -- I tried to note at the outset, which is the sequencing of the showings that need to be made, because what the DOJ is proposing, as I understand it, is that in the first instance, it has to be the -- the prosecutor who goes to court, goes to federal court in this instance now, and makes an affirmative showing that there -- that the standard has been met, that there's some objective basis and -- and it's -- it's -- it can't be obtained elsewhere, et cetera, et cetera."
2019.19-635,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,4885.56,4904.68,"So, Mr. Dunne -- so, Mr. Dunne, am I correct in thinking then that you agree that the forum should be federal court, you agree on all the relevant considerations, the necessity of the information, that it can't be obtained elsewhere, the timing issues, all are relevant considerations; it's just who -- who bears the burden?"
2019.19-635,2,63243,carey_r_dunne,,4904.68,4905.44,"Yes, Your Honor."
2019.19-635,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,4905.44,4908.76,Is that what you're fighting over?
2019.19-635,2,63243,carey_r_dunne,,4908.76,4927.72,"Well, I'm -- maybe with the DOJ there's more -- there's less daylight between us -- than us and the President's lawyers, but I think the important point that I would want to leave the Court with is that, even if one were to adopt that standard or even, frankly, I think the DOJ standard, the fact is we've already met that test given the findings of the courts below."
2019.19-635,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,4927.72,4930.32,"Well, I -- I know you think you win no matter what."
2019.19-635,2,63243,carey_r_dunne,,4947.88,4948.56,That's right.
2019.19-635,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,4948.56,4950.2,I'm not trying to put words in your mouth.
2019.19-635,2,63243,carey_r_dunne,,4951.56,4957.8,"No, Your Honor, I think it is the burden and the difference in the language which I've pointed out to Justice Sotomayor."
2019.19-635,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,4966.56,4969.24,Thank you.
2019.19-635,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4969.24,4969.72,Justice Kavanaugh?
2019.19-635,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,4969.72,4972.64,"Thank you, Chief Justice. And good afternoon, Mr. Dunne."
2019.19-635,2,63243,carey_r_dunne,,4992.36,5008.64,"Yes, well, Justice -- Justice Kavanaugh, as I think you mentioned in the earlier argument, the fact remains that In Re Sealed Case was, indeed, applying the Nixon standard as the Nixon Court contemplated to a claim of executive privilege."
2019.19-635,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,5020.92,5022.64,"Well, let me -- I'm sorry to interrupt."
2019.19-635,2,63243,carey_r_dunne,,5036.0,5042.88,"And -- and, indeed, in -- even in the grand jury context, when we're talking about a privilege analysis, I think that language is appropriate."
2019.19-635,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,5042.88,5043.24,Okay.
2019.19-635,2,63243,carey_r_dunne,,5043.24,5062.96,"Because, at that point, you already have -- once there's been an affirmative showing that established that -- that there is a privilege to be -- to be addressed, then, of course, like with an attorney-client privilege, for example, it's necessary for the Court then to turn to the demand or the request and the documents that are at issue and evaluate them in -- you know, in light of --"
2019.19-635,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,5062.96,5069.56,"Let's -- let's, if we can, move on to the Article II issue then. Do you acknowledge that there's an Article II interest at stake here?"
2019.19-635,2,63243,carey_r_dunne,,5069.56,5071.12,Yes.
2019.19-635,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,5071.12,5072.88,And what do you think it is?
2019.19-635,2,63243,carey_r_dunne,,5072.88,5079.64,I think it's -- it's the Article II interest to be free from unreasonable burdens on the duties and obligations of the presidency.
2019.19-635,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,5084.32,5092.6,And do you think time -- what Justice Breyer referred to as time and energy distraction are appropriate Article II interests?
2019.19-635,2,63243,carey_r_dunne,,5092.6,5095.68,"Well, yes, as a matter of degree."
2019.19-635,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,5129.12,5135.44,"And I think the other side made two distinctions with Clinton, and I want to make sure you have an opportunity to address them."
2019.19-635,2,63243,carey_r_dunne,,5161.32,5163.8,"Well, that's -- that's one distinction, Your Honor."
2019.19-635,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,5192.96,5215.8,"And then -- I'm sorry, if I can get my last question in. On the federal/state, if there is an Article II interest at stake, and you said that there is, it's different, of course, from the executive privilege interest, but there's some Article II interest at stake, I think the other side says it would be odd if the standard were easier to meet for a state prosecutor than for a federal prosecutor."
2019.19-635,2,63243,carey_r_dunne,,5217.88,5218.52,Yeah.
2019.19-635,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,5233.56,5234.16,So you --
2019.19-635,2,63243,carey_r_dunne,,5234.16,5234.72,Whether --
2019.19-635,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,5234.72,5244.92,"Just to stop you there, you're okay with whatever standard applies to a federal prosecutor in a case where there's an Article II interest also applying to the state prosecutor?"
2019.19-635,2,63243,carey_r_dunne,,5244.92,5247.32,"Well, I -- I'm not sure exactly what you have in mind, Your Honor, but I -- I think the --"
2019.19-635,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,5247.32,5250.0,"Well, I guess the Nixon standard."
2019.19-635,2,63243,carey_r_dunne,,5254.08,5280.04,"No, because of the -- the fact that that was applying to claims of executive privilege. But I think, to get to your point, I -- I -- I think what it comes down to is that, you know, in the -- in the Nixon and Clinton cases, we're -- we're talking about, you know, Article III versus -- we're talking about separation of powers analysis. Here, the analogy is we're balancing federalism and Tenth Amendment concerns about police power of the states against the Supremacy Clause."
2019.19-635,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,5284.6,5286.56,Thank you.
2019.19-635,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,5286.56,5329.0,"Counsel, we have time for a little bit of a second round, and I guess the thing that I would like to focus on first is this question of how you examine the burden on the -- on the President or the presidency. I just don't understand how it works in terms of you or -- or the President being asked to devote a certain amount of time to reviewing, for example, in this case, the -- the -- the 10 years of documents or whatever. I mean, what is it -- is -- is there supposed to be a hearing where he says, here's what I'm doing, I've got this pandemic thing, you know, China's causing all sorts of trouble? You know, most Presidents throughout their term have a pretty long to-do list."
2019.19-635,2,63243,carey_r_dunne,,5339.76,5364.28,"Well, I guess, Your Honor, when we're talking about, you know, in -- in the context of a particular subpoena, like this one, or a litigation or what have you, like in -- in Clinton, again, this Court has already decided that you can't shield a -- a president from any sort -- every sort of private distraction. And I just want to emphasize here, again, that --"
2019.19-635,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,5364.28,5366.52,That was in the -- that was in the civil context.
2019.19-635,2,63243,carey_r_dunne,,5371.16,5372.44,"Well, I'm -- I'm not sure, Your Honor."
2019.19-635,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,5407.24,5416.08,"It's a little bit of a -- it's a little bit of a -- that is what the President's personal lawyers advocated. It's not what the Solicitor General advocated, not an absolute rule."
2019.19-635,2,63243,carey_r_dunne,,5416.08,5437.32,"Yes, I know, Your Honor. And -- and, therefore, the answer in that case is what's happened here, which is a case-specific analysis before a court, which, as they do all the time, is able to balance and listen to arguments about burdens. And, as here, when the court finds there's no Article II burden whatsoever, after an opportunity to be heard, that should be the answer."
2019.19-635,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,5438.44,5441.08,"Justice Thomas, anything further?"
2019.19-635,2,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,5441.08,5445.16,"One brief question, Mr. Dunne."
2019.19-635,2,63243,carey_r_dunne,,5461.48,5469.36,"Well, I guess, Your Honor, again, hypothetically, because our -- our subpoena imposes, we say, no burden whatsoever."
2019.19-635,2,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,5469.36,5471.16,I understand that.
2019.19-635,2,63243,carey_r_dunne,,5471.16,5530.76,"But I -- I -- I think I would -- I would again point to this Court's language in the Clinton analysis where it -- it was -- you know, it was observed in passing in the opinion, I think just as dicta, but it was relevant that, you know, if -- if a president was asked to actually appear and testify at trial someday someplace outside of the White House, that might be the kind of thing that you'd say really shouldn't have to happen. I would suggest there along those lines too that if -- if there -- if a president were to be -- were -- were to be asked to produce -- show up for multiple days of consecutive deposition testimony or something like that, those -- those kinds -- those are practical burdens, or if -- if the demands were that he show up at a particular time or place that is -- you know, where there are conflicts and that kind of thing, again, since we're talking here about private conduct and no executive privilege, what we get to are really practical concerns about impositions on -- on presidential activities."
2019.19-635,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,5533.04,5535.96,"Thank you. Justice Ginsburg, anything further?"
2019.19-635,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,5535.96,5536.68,Nothing further.
2019.19-635,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,5536.68,5538.16,Justice Breyer?
2019.19-635,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,5538.16,5540.04,"No, thank you."
2019.19-635,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,5541.44,5544.56,Justice Alito?
2019.19-635,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,5544.56,5546.16,One quick question.
2019.19-635,2,63243,carey_r_dunne,,5563.88,5600.96,"I guess, Your Honor, I -- I -- my view of the chronology in Clinton v. Jones, I'll try to be brief, is that I -- I think, contrary to some people's view of history, I think that the -- the -- the district court, following this Court's decision, kept a rather close rein on discovery in that case and, don't forget, later granted summary judgment in favor of the President long before trial. It was only that it came out later, of course, that it turns out that in his brief deposition in the case that the President committed perjury, which is what led to the impeachment proceedings and other travails he had. So I don't think it was this Court's opinion or the litigation itself that led to those problems."
2019.19-635,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,5620.6,5625.96,Justice Sotomayor?
2019.19-635,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,5625.96,5658.6,"I'm not sure that I understood your statement earlier that the only difference between you and the SG -- well, there are two differences, one in -- in the articulation of special needs or heightened standard, but you said it's the burden of proof. But you've already conceded to -- to one of my colleagues that there is an automatic burden on an article -- on the Article II clause by subpoenaing a sitting president, period."
2019.19-635,2,63243,carey_r_dunne,,5658.6,5659.72,"No, I've not -- I've not, Your Honor."
2019.19-635,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,5663.2,5663.96,All right.
2019.19-635,2,63243,carey_r_dunne,,5667.2,5668.92,I'm -- I'm conceding --
2019.19-635,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,5668.92,5682.8,"And -- and what kind of burden are you talking about? And, number three, articulate more precisely what problems you have with the heightened standard that Nixon set in its grand jury subpoena."
2019.19-635,2,63243,carey_r_dunne,,5682.8,5732.64,"Yeah, I guess, in my response, I think, to Justice Gorsuch, my concern -- my -- what I acknowledged was that, yes, a subpoena like this implicates Article II issues and potential burdens, and it's those which have to be weighed in a case-specific analysis. I wasn't conceding that the mere fact of a subpoena imposes ""an Article II burden."" I think that's -- that's the distinction I would -- I would -- I would draw. And, again, getting back to the language question, I -- again, it's the DOJ's language that calls for a stringent showing that a request is directly relevant to central issues at trial and specific charging decisions. And, again, very simply, as a practical matter, no court and no prosecutor could -- could meet that standard because, in a grand jury, one is not thinking about charging decisions or central issues at trial."

2019.19-635,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,5742.36,5756.72,"Mr. Dunne, on -- on the question of a possible distinction between state prosecutors and federal prosecutors, the President's lawyers have urged that there's a legal difference arising from the Supremacy Clause."
2019.19-635,2,63243,carey_r_dunne,,5761.6,5764.76,"I think the response, Your Honor, is -- I alluded to it before."

I just wanted to ask again, deferral of the investigation until after the presidency, assuming statute of limitations issues were solved -- which is a big assumption, I understand -- can you tick off the concerns you would have about that so that we have those clear?"

2019.19-635,2,63243,carey_r_dunne,,5910.88,5917.8,"Yes, Your Honor, thank you. Your Honors, the issue presented here today is extremely narrow but extremely important."
