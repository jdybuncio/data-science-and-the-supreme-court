2001.99-1996,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.857,"We'll hear argument next in No. 99-1996, J.E.M. Supply, Inc. v. Pioneer Hi-Bred International."
2001.99-1996,0,17758,bruce_e_johnson,,15.853,28.773,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court: 35 U.S.C., section 101 is set out at page 19a in the appendix of the blue brief."
2001.99-1996,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,82.189,88.299,"The rights conferred by the statute you're referring to are somewhat different than the patent statute, aren't they?"
2001.99-1996,0,17758,bruce_e_johnson,,88.299,93.789,"I do not... no, that is not correct, Mr. Chief Justice."
2001.99-1996,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,142.725,155.544,But I... I had understood from the briefs that the rights conferred under the Plant Act are different in some respects from that under the general patent section.
2001.99-1996,0,17758,bruce_e_johnson,,156.493,158.433,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice."
2001.99-1996,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,209.414,211.643,Let me ask you a specific question.
2001.99-1996,0,17758,bruce_e_johnson,,227.907,230.098,"Yes, Mr. Justice Souter."
2001.99-1996,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,230.098,230.302,All right.
2001.99-1996,0,17758,bruce_e_johnson,,233.441,235.587,"No, Mr. Justice."
2001.99-1996,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,235.587,243.677,"Then isn't the answer to the Chief Justice's question yes, there is a difference in the rights which are conveyed by 101 and by a PVP license, respectively?"
2001.99-1996,0,17758,bruce_e_johnson,,243.677,245.451,"Yes, Justice Souter."
2001.99-1996,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,245.451,248.052,"Well, then why didn't you answer me that way in the first place?"
2001.99-1996,0,17758,bruce_e_johnson,,248.052,261.964,"I... Mr. Chief Justice, because I misapprehended the nature of the question and I thought that you were asking about the attributes... the attributes protected."
2001.99-1996,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,333.584,338.786,"Before you go on, has any court ever held that it would be patent infringement for the farmer to save the seeds?"
2001.99-1996,0,17758,bruce_e_johnson,,338.786,341.842,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2001.99-1996,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,368.591,371.108,These are cases in the district courts.
2001.99-1996,0,17758,bruce_e_johnson,,372.306,383.202,--I do not believe that... that I know of... that a seed saving case has reached a court of appeal... a court of appeal yet.
2001.99-1996,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,383.202,385.614,Does the PTO have a position on it?
2001.99-1996,0,17758,bruce_e_johnson,,385.614,393.855,"The Government is arguing as an amici for Pioneer, for the... for the appellee in this case."
2001.99-1996,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,393.855,397.32,"Yes, but this case doesn't focus on the saving seed exception."
2001.99-1996,0,17758,bruce_e_johnson,,430.468,437.61,"I have not seen anything on that position... that position, one way or another, from the PTO."
2001.99-1996,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,437.61,450.985,"As far as the... the issue that is before us, we do have a position of the PTO and of the Federal circuit, both having more expertise than the rest of the Federal court we're on in these questions."
2001.99-1996,0,17758,bruce_e_johnson,,454.534,466.588,"Justice Ginsburg, I believe that this case is a case of statutory construction."
2001.99-1996,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,505.765,512.081,Where has Congress said you can't get a utility patent on a plant?
2001.99-1996,0,17758,bruce_e_johnson,,528.056,532.636,--It has explicitly stated this in legislative acts on two occasions.
2001.99-1996,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,544.996,555.753,"Because it thought, at least in part... it thought that a plant couldn't qualify for a utility patent."
2001.99-1996,0,17758,bruce_e_johnson,,572.017,579.326,"--Let me go back, if I may, for a moment, and I'll answer your question on Chakrabarty."
2001.99-1996,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,624.734,627.085,This is section 4884?
2001.99-1996,0,17758,bruce_e_johnson,,627.085,630.057,--This is in the petition appendix--
2001.99-1996,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,630.057,631.133,Page 42 of the--
2001.99-1996,0,17758,bruce_e_johnson,,631.133,631.915,--Page 42.
2001.99-1996,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,631.915,636.084,--And which of the sections that are cited there are you referring to?
2001.99-1996,0,17758,bruce_e_johnson,,636.084,637.449,Just a moment here.
2001.99-1996,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,725.703,738.501,"Well, in other words, there's the scheme established in 1930 and it is both more inclusive than a 101 patent, and it gives you fewer rights."
2001.99-1996,0,17758,bruce_e_johnson,,750.474,754.31,We have to give meaning to what Congress did in 1930.
2001.99-1996,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,755.425,758.852,"If you want to say if... that we should infer it, fine."
2001.99-1996,0,17758,bruce_e_johnson,,761.164,790.142,"--In 1950, in the revision of the Patent Act, Congress dissembled section 4886 and placed the plant patent language from 4886 in a separate chapter, and kept the Thomas Jefferson language in... and placed that in section 101."
2001.99-1996,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,818.627,821.987,Then why... why shouldn't Chakrabarty have come out the other way?
2001.99-1996,0,17758,bruce_e_johnson,,850.372,864.611,"What the Court did in Chakrabarty was affirm Judge Giles Rich's footnote 25 in the underlying circuit court case, Application of Bergy."
2001.99-1996,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,882.733,889.958,"They're... they're... yes, the PVP but they're not expressly... I guess the... the PPA doesn't say anything about them one way or the other."
2001.99-1996,0,17758,bruce_e_johnson,,910.308,925.829,"Well, in Chakrabarty, Justice Souter, the dissent argued that the existence of the plant-specific acts evidenced Congress' intent that no living thing could be subject to a 101 patent."
2001.99-1996,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1036.064,1039.308,"No, but could we go back, though, to the facts of... of Chakrabarty?"
2001.99-1996,0,17758,bruce_e_johnson,,1075.967,1081.994,I don't believe that the Chakrabarty Court viewed the bacterium as a plant.
2001.99-1996,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1081.994,1083.519,"Well, what else could it view it as?"
2001.99-1996,0,17758,bruce_e_johnson,,1084.262,1085.376,They spoke--
2001.99-1996,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1085.376,1085.998,--I went to the dictionary.
2001.99-1996,0,17758,bruce_e_johnson,,1090.289,1096.772,--I... the Chakrabarty Court spoke of it as a microorganism.
2001.99-1996,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1096.772,1098.751,Which is a generic term.
2001.99-1996,0,17758,bruce_e_johnson,,1098.751,1125.751,"And the... as... as I read Chakrabarty, their discussion of the PVPA and their discussion of the PPA was for the purposes of explaining historically how they evolved and to disassemble the dissent's argument that those two... that those two specific acts meant you couldn't patent any living thing."
2001.99-1996,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1126.615,1127.441,"Well, I don't want to prolong this."
2001.99-1996,0,17758,bruce_e_johnson,,1127.441,1127.98,--Yes.
2001.99-1996,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1127.98,1140.24,"But I take it then on... on your position, if we assume that the bacterium is a plant and it asexually reproduces, the decision in Chakrabarty should have been that it's covered by the PPA and there's no 101 patent."
2001.99-1996,0,17758,bruce_e_johnson,,1140.24,1161.909,"If it would... if it would be a plant variety and if reproducing by dividing, which is not sexual... it's certainly not sexual multiplication as... as plants do it, then that would be... then the decision should have been that it could have qualified for a PPA patent."
2001.99-1996,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1161.909,1164.305,"And therefore, it couldn't qualify for a 101."
2001.99-1996,0,17758,bruce_e_johnson,,1164.676,1165.708,Yes.
2001.99-1996,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1167.111,1167.782,On... on your--
2001.99-1996,0,17758,bruce_e_johnson,,1167.782,1168.68,--It would not be blocked.
2001.99-1996,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1175.739,1180.28,"--No, but it would be blocked by the fact, on your reasoning, that it was covered by PPA."
2001.99-1996,0,17758,bruce_e_johnson,,1180.28,1181.19,Yes.
2001.99-1996,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1181.19,1181.683,Okay.
2001.99-1996,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1181.683,1184.655,But is... has anybody ever held it was a... a bacterium is a plant?
2001.99-1996,0,17758,bruce_e_johnson,,1185.331,1185.77,I have not--
2001.99-1996,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1185.77,1188.082,--did any court ever say that or the Patent Office or somebody?
2001.99-1996,0,17758,bruce_e_johnson,,1188.082,1191.342,"--I have never seen anything, you know, of that."
2001.99-1996,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1191.342,1192.829,"So, the dictionary--"
2001.99-1996,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1192.829,1194.769,--My... my dictionary holds that.
2001.99-1996,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1195.679,1200.88,Maybe when Chakrabarty was decided people didn't look so carefully at dictionaries as they do now.
2001.99-1996,0,17758,bruce_e_johnson,,1207.029,1221.147,"I certainly didn't... it took pains to point out that... well, it said one of the reasons why the PVPA may have exclusive... or explicitly excluded it was because it may have felt that it wasn't a plant."
2001.99-1996,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1223.293,1254.062,"Mr. Johnson, there's one piece of this case that's somewhat disturbing in that... in that am I right in thinking that it is relatively harder to get a utility patent, that you have to convince the PTO and you have to have more documentation and involve yourself with a lawyer's fee... much harder to get a 101 registration than it is to get a certificate under the PVPA?"
2001.99-1996,0,17758,bruce_e_johnson,,1254.062,1265.646,"Well, I saw a lot of that in amici briefs, but there's not a scintilla of evidence on it in the record."
2001.99-1996,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1265.646,1266.761,But are you--
2001.99-1996,0,17758,bruce_e_johnson,,1266.761,1267.132,I think the--
2001.99-1996,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1267.132,1278.445,"--Are you suggesting that... let's take this case... that this particular item could not have qualified, maybe it wouldn't qualify for a PVPA certificate?"
2001.99-1996,0,17758,bruce_e_johnson,,1278.445,1295.179,--Every... all 17 corn plant varieties that are the subjects of the patents that we have challenged in this case also applied for and obtained Plant Variety Protection certificates.
2001.99-1996,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1295.179,1296.649,"Oh, so they do have both."
2001.99-1996,0,17758,bruce_e_johnson,,1298.423,1300.736,"In this case, they do have both, and there's--"
2001.99-1996,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1300.736,1308.638,And I thought that the infringing action here would infringe a PVP certificate as well.
2001.99-1996,0,17758,bruce_e_johnson,,1321.291,1322.943,--First--
2001.99-1996,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1322.943,1325.832,"But they don't have a 101 patent, so they have nothing."
2001.99-1996,0,17758,bruce_e_johnson,,1325.832,1326.492,--Right.
2001.99-1996,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1344.408,1359.436,"So, you're telling me they did have the dual protection, but either they chose not to charge you with... with infringing on the PVP protection or you didn't do anything that would infringe that protection."
2001.99-1996,0,17758,bruce_e_johnson,,1359.436,1361.044,--We... we didn't do anything to infringe it.
2001.99-1996,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1783.505,1784.415,"Very well, Mr. Johnson."
2001.99-1996,1,23156,edmund_j_sease,,1786.023,1824.911,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In response to my colleague's representation that Pioneer's sole case here rests upon a snippet of statement in the legislative history of the '52 act, quoted in Chakrabarty where the Court said, machined or manufactured can include anything under the sun made by man, we do, of course, rely on that piece of legislative history, as did Chakrabarty."
2001.99-1996,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1869.326,1883.072,"Well, I... I suppose their point was that in many statutes, if A, B, and C are covered and C is then removed, we make the inference that C is not intended to be covered any longer."
2001.99-1996,1,23156,edmund_j_sease,,1903.151,1904.62,Justice Kennedy--
2001.99-1996,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1904.62,1905.446,I take it that's your position.
2001.99-1996,1,23156,edmund_j_sease,,1905.446,1907.388,--They... that is our position.
2001.99-1996,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1939.05,1939.998,May I--
2001.99-1996,1,23156,edmund_j_sease,,1939.998,1941.318,--something to fit one or more.
2001.99-1996,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1941.318,1942.515,--I didn't mean to interrupt you.
2001.99-1996,1,23156,edmund_j_sease,,2031.104,2031.341,Yes.
2001.99-1996,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2124.727,2141.278,"Is there any other situation in the realm of intellectual property where you have this kind of dual regime, where you have both the standard kind of patents, then you have to the side of that a patent-like protection?"
2001.99-1996,1,23156,edmund_j_sease,,2141.278,2164.767,"Justice Ginsburg, the answer to that is there's nothing like it in the patent world, but there are analogous dual systems, if you will, in the intellectual property world, whereas it's common, for example, for the same tangible item to have both design patent protection and to have copyright protection."
2001.99-1996,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2174.51,2180.576,"You can have overlapping patents, trade secrets."
2001.99-1996,1,23156,edmund_j_sease,,2187.801,2189.864,"--I... I think it is, Your Honor."
2001.99-1996,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2286.254,2287.202,Why is it--
2001.99-1996,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2287.202,2289.886,--May I ask a question about... about this particular case?
2001.99-1996,1,23156,edmund_j_sease,,2306.4,2312.631,"Justice Ginsburg, I... there is no real record on that."
2001.99-1996,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2349.867,2365.759,"You... consistently with your answer to me a moment ago that the PVPA certificate is almost a kind of registration mechanism, I... I'm assuming that therefore it probably doesn't take long to get it."
2001.99-1996,1,23156,edmund_j_sease,,2365.759,2370.317,"They take much less time, yes, through the Department of--"
2001.99-1996,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2370.317,2371.62,So that you would... if you... let's assume you filed for both.
2001.99-1996,1,23156,edmund_j_sease,,2382.19,2384.419,--If at all you ever get through the 101 process.
2001.99-1996,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2384.419,2384.64,Yes.
2001.99-1996,1,23156,edmund_j_sease,,2384.64,2392.797,"One never knows, at the time you make the invention, whether you are going to meet successfully the higher standards of the Patent Utility Act or not."
2001.99-1996,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2410.425,2411.001,"Well, wait."
2001.99-1996,1,23156,edmund_j_sease,,2435.604,2436.364,--That's right.
2001.99-1996,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2436.364,2436.636,All right.
2001.99-1996,1,23156,edmund_j_sease,,2437.546,2438.139,That's correct.
2001.99-1996,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2438.139,2438.576,Fine.
2001.99-1996,1,23156,edmund_j_sease,,2485.222,2490.506,"Your Honor, I... I would disagree with that, respectfully."
2001.99-1996,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2492.075,2494.138,But the question was not... what was the theory?
2001.99-1996,1,23156,edmund_j_sease,,2496.905,2500.083,"--The theory... the theory was... and one must look at the statute, Your Honor."
2001.99-1996,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2515.415,2517.81,But you see... let me show where I'm coming from.
2001.99-1996,1,23156,edmund_j_sease,,2571.126,2589.497,"Well, nothing in the Plant Variety Protection Act or the Plant Patent Act or its legislative history shows that Congress ever intended to take anything out of section 101 that was already included in section 101, and that included these plants."
2001.99-1996,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2593.417,2608.445,"Well, they had before them, quoted in your brief I think, Simon Rifkin's committee's report, which says all provisions in the patent statute for plant patents should be deleted and another form of protection provided."
2001.99-1996,1,23156,edmund_j_sease,,2624.336,2645.513,"Because if you were to say that the passing of the Plant Variety Protection Act in 1970 somehow is an implicit narrowing of 35 U.S.C., section 101 or an implicit exclusion of subject matter from that, you need a far greater signal than just that."
2001.99-1996,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2645.513,2650.798,"You've got the principle in your favor that repeals, by implication, are not favored."
2001.99-1996,1,23156,edmund_j_sease,,2650.798,2651.391,Yes.
2001.99-1996,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2673.665,2676.349,"So, what does the farmer do who wants to save his seeds?"
2001.99-1996,1,23156,edmund_j_sease,,2676.349,2690.855,"What the farmer does who wants to save his seed is he can, indeed, save those seed if they are protected under the Plant Variety Protection Act only, but not if they are protected under the utility patent statute."
2001.99-1996,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2690.855,2692.53,"Well, he can get permission."
2001.99-1996,1,23156,edmund_j_sease,,2693.439,2694.637,He can pay for permission.
2001.99-1996,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2695.38,2708.133,"Is it your view... nobody has really talked about the infringement under the basic patent statute, but if I was a farmer and I just bought the seeds, you tell me it's a patented product and I plant the seeds."
2001.99-1996,1,23156,edmund_j_sease,,2715.358,2717.671,That's an infringement of the utility patent.
2001.99-1996,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2717.671,2718.247,Why is that an infringement?
2001.99-1996,1,23156,edmund_j_sease,,2720.022,2724.442,He does own what he purchased but only in the volume that he purchased.
2001.99-1996,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2728.733,2739.796,"You're... you're saying that... that the infringement... it's not just an infringement of a license agreement or anything like a contractual undertaking, but the patent statute itself is sufficient to make his saving seeds an infringement in your view."
2001.99-1996,1,23156,edmund_j_sease,,2739.796,2746.937,"--Under the utility patent statute because the utility patent statute gives the right to exclude others from making, using, or selling."
2001.99-1996,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2746.937,2749.455,But he's not... but he's purchased it.
2001.99-1996,1,23156,edmund_j_sease,,2750.82,2754.202,He purchased... he purchased one set volume of the product.
2001.99-1996,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2754.202,2754.756,Correct.
2001.99-1996,1,23156,edmund_j_sease,,2754.756,2762.087,The recreation of that by planting and regrowth is a subsequent infringing act.
2001.99-1996,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2762.087,2763.656,What is the best authority you have for that proposition?
2001.99-1996,1,23156,edmund_j_sease,,2763.656,2764.77,Pardon?
2001.99-1996,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2764.77,2767.91,"Is there any case holding that, any appellate court case holding that?"
2001.99-1996,1,23156,edmund_j_sease,,2767.91,2779.731,"There is no specific case in the seed area that... that I'm aware of that holds that, but it... it is sort of analogous to the repair/reconstruction doctrine in the utility patent statute."
2001.99-1996,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2779.731,2785.038,It's not analogous to running a... a mimeograph machine and requiring the user to use your paper.
2001.99-1996,1,23156,edmund_j_sease,,2786.031,2787.722,It isn't.
2001.99-1996,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2812.902,2814.638,What... what do they do with the seeds?
2001.99-1996,1,23156,edmund_j_sease,,2815.974,2817.239,--What does who do?
2001.99-1996,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2817.239,2819.012,What... do they throw... have to throw the seeds away or something?
2001.99-1996,1,23156,edmund_j_sease,,2819.012,2832.758,"Well, hybrid seed is only good... and these patents are on hybrid seed, most of them... is only good for 1 year because you cannot take the seed from a hybrid seed and then plant it and get the same plant back."
2001.99-1996,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2835.359,2845.035,"But for something that it does work for, is... is the answer but you can't use the descendants of your original seed, so you have to throw them away?"
2001.99-1996,1,23156,edmund_j_sease,,2845.035,2849.105,You can't use the descendants of your original seed to plant a new crop.
2001.99-1996,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2850.841,2851.163,Yes.
2001.99-1996,1,23156,edmund_j_sease,,2852.243,2862.73,"You... you can use them for their ordinary intended purpose which, for example, if the seed is soybean, you... you sell your crop at the end of the year like a farmer does."
2001.99-1996,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2864.792,2874.619,"Yes, but the seeds that you would otherwise have saved, the seeds that you would have saved if... if it were only plant variety protection, you can't do anything with them."
2001.99-1996,1,23156,edmund_j_sease,,2874.619,2876.226,If there--
2001.99-1996,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2876.226,2878.455,"As Justice Kennedy said, you just have to throw them out?"
2001.99-1996,1,23156,edmund_j_sease,,2878.455,2884.4,"--If... if there is utility patent coverage, you can't do anything with them unless you make some sort of arrangement with the patent owner."
2001.99-1996,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2884.4,2885.886,You could put them out for the birds.
2001.99-1996,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2887.743,2889.951,Yes.
2001.99-1996,1,23156,edmund_j_sease,,2893.11,2905.659,"We are not operating in a vacuum here about what Congress believes is correct, Your Honors, and I would like to make that point."
2001.99-1996,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2981.073,2994.514,"Yes, but that's... that's inconsistent with the argument you make on the first half of the case, that Congress' understanding of the... of the statute is irrelevant in light of our interpretation."
2001.99-1996,1,23156,edmund_j_sease,,2997.032,3003.143,"Well, I don't say that Congress' understanding of the statute is irrelevant."
2001.99-1996,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3015.403,3016.434,"Thank you, Mr. Sease."
2001.99-1996,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3018.358,3047.93,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In Diamond against Chakrabarty, the Plant Patent Act and the Plant Variety Protection Act played a central role in the debates between counsel and between the Court's opinion and the dissenting opinions."
2001.99-1996,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3167.559,3181.388,Is there any... anywhere have you come across in your research any empirical estimate of how many of the things that qualify under the two special acts might also qualify under the Patent Act where you would have to show it was nonobvious as well as new?
2001.99-1996,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3186.385,3208.676,"Well, we do... I can't give you any direct answer to that, but there... there are certain... there have been more plant variety certificates issued than there have been utility patents issued on plants."
2001.99-1996,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3209.912,3215.652,"I noticed that there is a document filed, which I got, that they referred to in the briefs."
2001.99-1996,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3233.401,3239.634,"--We perhaps could provide some help on that, but I cannot at the moment."
2001.99-1996,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3343.205,3354.229,"Mr. Wallace, can I ask you your view on the question of whether a person who buys a patented seed and plants it and then gets some seeds and saves them and then replants them the following year, would he be an infringer?"
2001.99-1996,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3354.229,3358.974,That depends on the terms of the license agreement.
2001.99-1996,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3363.617,3368.346,"Supposing the... supposing the license agreement is... is silent on the matter, but merely identifies it as a patented seed."
2001.99-1996,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3368.346,3376.536,"--Well, that... to the... you'd have to interpret what the arrangement is and what has been granted and what has been withheld."
2001.99-1996,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3376.536,3380.151,The arrangement is that the... the farmer bought some seeds knowing they were patented.
2001.99-1996,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3387.127,3398.455,"If the... if the plant could reproduce the same seeds that are patented, he could not make and use the patented seeds without permission from the license holder."
2001.99-1996,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3403.352,3404.134,"Well, I know, but I'm not asking a question about the license."
2001.99-1996,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3404.134,3404.877,Yes.
2001.99-1996,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3404.877,3405.703,I'm asking a question about the law.
2001.99-1996,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3405.703,3406.817,"Right, yes."
2001.99-1996,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3421.595,3429.73,Why is that not like a license to use a patented mimeograph machine that's licensed only to use with... with the seller's paper?
2001.99-1996,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3431.876,3451.667,"--Well, because your crop can be used as a means of producing patented seeds and reproducing the patented plant product, and it becomes a form of manufacturing of the patented item without the patent holder's permission unless arrangements have been made."
2001.99-1996,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3451.667,3455.282,I... I can't think of a machine that can replicate itself.
2001.99-1996,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3461.614,3463.577,Well--
2001.99-1996,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3463.577,3475.837,"--and... and that we should pay careful attention before saying that the... the new acts, the 1930 act and the later act, were... were not intended to supersede patent protection."
2001.99-1996,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3475.837,3498.954,"--Well, plants are... are different in that Congress, while saying that nothing was intended to limit section 101 availability, saw a special need to assure that for plants there would be protections available even when it was doubtful, whether for microorganisms or animals, there would be."
2001.99-1996,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3500.069,3503.124,They also... they also wanted to be sure that people could do research.
2001.99-1996,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3519.099,3526.529,--The exemption is for purposes of that act only.
2001.99-1996,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3547.251,3551.438,Which is why I wanted to know the empirical contours of that argument.
2001.99-1996,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3551.438,3555.219,And then the public benefits from all of that.
2001.99-1996,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3563.393,3569.543,"Mr. Wallace, what would it take to craft a statute specifically designed for such living things?"
2001.99-1996,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3581.681,3594.972,"It is to the extent it goes, but of course, it has a much less... lower threshold of qualifying for eligibility and a lesser standard of protections."
2001.99-1996,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3626.014,3626.94,"Thank you, Mr. Wallace."
2001.99-1996,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3626.94,3627.583,"--all the plants, patents--"
2001.99-1996,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3627.583,3630.1,"Mr. Johnson, you have 10 seconds left."
2001.99-1996,3,17758,bruce_e_johnson,,3633.527,3639.471,"Whitman, section 119(f), Congress... oh, I'm sorry your honor--"
2001.99-1996,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3639.471,3643.558,The case is submitted.
