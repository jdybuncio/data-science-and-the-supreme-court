1956.20,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,15.734,"Number 20, Stephen Mesarosh, also known as Steve Nelson, et al., versus United States of America on the motion of the Solicitor General to remand."
1956.20,0,32701,j_lee_rankin,,17.668,22.756,May it please the Court.
1956.20,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,108.506,110.625,Did you say a majority of your colleagues?
1956.20,0,32701,j_lee_rankin,,110.625,111.691,Of all of my colleagues.
1956.20,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,111.691,113.023,"Oh, of all of your colleagues."
1956.20,0,32701,j_lee_rankin,,113.023,115.027,In the Solicitor's Office.
1956.20,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,178.519,189.542,Did the -- but that the Department know then or did the Department then have reason to doubt the honesty of that statement?
1956.20,0,32701,j_lee_rankin,,189.542,208.291,"The problem in regard to that was that when the witness, Bortz, appeared before the Committee, he stated that if he truthfully answered the questions that the Committee asked him in regard to the testimony of Mr. Mazzei before the Committee, that it would incriminate him."
1956.20,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,249.674,253.301,Did he say would incriminate him or might incriminate him?
1956.20,0,32701,j_lee_rankin,,253.301,256.25,"My recollection, would incriminate him."
1956.20,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,256.25,261.098,"In other words, he admitted that he -- that he --"
1956.20,0,32701,j_lee_rankin,,261.098,261.507,"That was, if I understood --"
1956.20,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,261.507,263.217,-- admitting criminal offense?
1956.20,0,32701,j_lee_rankin,,263.217,265.96,I understood the thrust of his testimony.
1956.20,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,299.444,313.402,"Well, if the court below had been advised at that time that you doubted the veracity of Mr. Mazzei as to that testimony, do you think he would have acted as he did?"
1956.20,0,32701,j_lee_rankin,,313.402,335.05,"Well, I believe he would, although I don't think at that time, the Department doubted the veracity of Mr. Mazzei in that particular testimony because it had the testimony of Mr. Mazzei before the Committee under oath and the -- the witness involved raising a doubt as to which one could have been right."
1956.20,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,353.878,361.83,But when did the Department first come to question the -- the truthfulness of Mr. Mazzei in that regard?
1956.20,0,32701,j_lee_rankin,,361.83,393.676,"At the time that they learned of the Sheiner matter, the testimony in Florida when it became cumulative of all these things that had occurred and they reflected back and we came to the conclusion that the only sound way to examine this matter in the interest of justice was to go back and see whether or not in light of what occurred later, the testimony of Mr. Mazzei at the trial which is the matter in point, was valid or credible or not."
1956.20,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,393.676,409.943,Do you now -- do you now believe that Mr. Mazzei lied at that hearing of the Committee in which he testified to the assassination about the post assassination of Senator McCarthy?
1956.20,0,32701,j_lee_rankin,,409.943,418.819,We believe that his testimony in that regard was not credible in light of what happened later.
1956.20,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,432.81,439.73,"Yes, but what -- the point I'm getting at is when you get back to the -- to the District Court, if you go back there --"
1956.20,0,32701,j_lee_rankin,,439.73,440.336,"Yes, sir."
1956.20,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,440.336,449.647,-- are you going to represent to the District Court that this testimony in your opinion is untrue or that it is true?
1956.20,0,32701,j_lee_rankin,,449.647,452.432,"Well, some of the testimony of these later events --"
1956.20,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,452.432,460.878,"No, I'm talking about this attempt to assassinate Senator McCarthy or the -- the suggestion that he would be assassinated."
1956.20,0,32701,j_lee_rankin,,470.208,480.576,We're going to frankly present to the court below the fact that the records that we have -- the information we have does not support that testimony.
1956.20,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,495.601,508.426,You mean you're not going to take the position either in this Court or the court below as to whether Mr. Mazzei lied or not in -- on that occasion?
1956.20,0,32701,j_lee_rankin,,508.426,511.145,We don't have sufficient knowledge to be sure.
1956.20,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,511.145,513.042,What is your belief?
1956.20,0,32701,j_lee_rankin,,513.042,516.01,My personal belief is that it was not truthful.
1956.20,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,516.01,519.361,"Now, that's -- that's all."
1956.20,0,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,519.361,525.293,How many days did the trial continue in the instance before -- before the Committee?
1956.20,0,32701,j_lee_rankin,,525.293,529.669,It was for several weeks as my understanding.
1956.20,0,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,532.109,540.231,Did the Department then appraise as far as you know in his testimony as to whether or not they had evidence supporting the entire testimony or --
1956.20,0,32701,j_lee_rankin,,540.231,556.429,"Before the witness was presented to the Court, his testimony was carefully appraised as to whether or not it was supported by other material the Department had and he was not contradicted, although, witnesses took the stand after the defendants."
1956.20,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,591.229,596.26,What would the -- what would the Court do (Inaudible) judgment on the remand?
1956.20,0,32701,j_lee_rankin,,596.26,625.252,"Well, I have in mind the procedure that was followed by Judge Dimock in connection with the Flynn case in which it seems to me the Court would examine the occurrences that relate and all of the evidence which the Department will present in regard to the files it has to the Court for its consideration to carefully determine whether or not at the time of the trial, this man's testimony was credible."
1956.20,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,625.252,628.186,But that's a jury question.
1956.20,0,32701,j_lee_rankin,,628.186,649.984,"Well, the question of whether or not he did fairly or whether it was credible, it seems to me, the Court could determine for himself if it's something that he did not feel the jury should even consider because of the nature of the testimony and how it conflicted with what he stated later."
1956.20,0,15127,harold_burton,scotus_justice,677.569,685.886,"All -- all the knowledge that came from the Department came after this case you filed, as I understand."
1956.20,0,32701,j_lee_rankin,,685.886,692.926,Except for the matters that were interrogated about like this matter before the Senate Committee.
1956.20,0,15127,harold_burton,scotus_justice,701.264,712.085,"But there's no -- no reason to think that the respondents here, the defendants below had any knowledge of the Florida situation -- the Florida testimony."
1956.20,0,32701,j_lee_rankin,,712.085,713.266,At the time of the trial?
1956.20,0,15127,harold_burton,scotus_justice,713.266,713.402,Yes.
1956.20,0,32701,j_lee_rankin,,713.402,714.284,It couldn't have.
1956.20,0,15127,harold_burton,scotus_justice,715.44,720.321,"Well then, there's been -- they've come into the possession of information since that time."
1956.20,0,32701,j_lee_rankin,,720.321,721.501,That's right.
1956.20,0,15127,harold_burton,scotus_justice,721.501,724.165,"And yet, they have to move for a new trial."
1956.20,0,32701,j_lee_rankin,,724.165,726.476,"No, they haven't moved for a new trial."
1956.20,0,15127,harold_burton,scotus_justice,731.518,737.92,"Certainly, it's not criticizing or intending to criticize the --"
1956.20,0,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,737.92,738.15,"Well, you asked (Voice Overlap) --"
1956.20,0,15127,harold_burton,scotus_justice,738.15,759.915,"Well, it calls this to the attention of the Court (Inaudible) but whether or not the fact that I would of course recommend it, in short whether to -- but the defendant is also in this case, (Inaudible) certain responsibilities and they have the same information that you have at least now."
1956.20,0,32701,j_lee_rankin,,759.915,760.379,Yes.
1956.20,0,15127,harold_burton,scotus_justice,760.379,763.019,They have not objected.
1956.20,0,32701,j_lee_rankin,,763.019,764.01,That is correct.
1956.20,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,822.508,844.179,"Well, Mr. Rankin, on the question of -- of whether the defense moved for a new trial on the basis of this Florida evidence, did they have available to them the same information that -- that you now have that cause you to disbelieve the witness, Mazzei, in this connection?"
1956.20,0,32701,j_lee_rankin,,844.179,844.757,No.
1956.20,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,868.651,879.974,Do they have the same information that you have concerning the possible untruthfulness in the -- in the McCarthy incident that happened in -- at the time of the trial?
1956.20,0,32701,j_lee_rankin,,879.974,881.762,"No, they do not."
1956.20,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,881.762,887.361,Is that to be made available to them if it goes back to the -- the trial court?
1956.20,0,32701,j_lee_rankin,,887.361,892.996,"Well, that would depend on what the trial court thought should be done, I think, in the conduct of the case."
1956.20,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,920.135,933.539,"Well, I can understand that, but when the case goes back, do they have to operate in the dark and without any -- any knowledge of the facts you have that caused you to disbelieve this man?"
1956.20,0,32701,j_lee_rankin,,933.539,944.07,"Well, we'll do whatever this Court thinks we should do, but what I had in mind was to labor for the judge all of the information that the Government has about the entire matter."
1956.20,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,963.077,967.028,"Then you'll try it in camera with the judge, would you?"
1956.20,0,32701,j_lee_rankin,,967.028,989.691,"Well, I had in mind that certain portions, the judge would handle in camera so as to protect innocent people and all others that would reach into the merits of the situation would certainly be handled by the Court in such a way as to give all the parties an adequate opportunity to present their defense."
1956.20,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,989.691,994.204,"Mr. Solicitor, I should like to ask you just one question."
1956.20,0,32701,j_lee_rankin,,1029.363,1031.438,That is correct.
1956.20,1,23848,frank_j_donner,,2490.19,2491.857,May it please the Court.
1956.20,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2491.857,2496.026,Mr. --
1956.20,1,23848,frank_j_donner,,2496.026,2496.896,Donner.
1956.20,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2496.896,2499.633,That's -- pardon me.
1956.20,1,23848,frank_j_donner,,2499.633,2510.451,I'd better start by summarizing the items of testimony for which this witness was responsible.
1956.20,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2694.496,2701.225,May I -- may I suggest that it will help me if you would state what's the defendant's position with reference to the motion.
1956.20,1,23848,frank_j_donner,,2701.225,2702.372,Very well.
1956.20,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2836.034,2839.111,"To dismiss, you mean grant a new trial?"
1956.20,1,23848,frank_j_donner,,2839.111,2839.368,No.
1956.20,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2848.129,2851.034,For the same -- the same remand do you mean?
1956.20,1,23848,frank_j_donner,,2851.034,2856.02,For a new trial as to the other three.
1956.20,1,15127,harold_burton,scotus_justice,3148.984,3156.842,"Mr. Donner, you are also going to refer to the other facet of this motion as to whether or not you should argue the merits of the main case?"
1956.20,1,23848,frank_j_donner,,3156.842,3159.084,"I'm sorry, Your Honor, I'll do that."
1956.20,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3359.316,3360.4,We'll recess.
