1987.86-622,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,56.42,"Mr. Teel, you may proceed whenever you're ready."
1987.86-622,0,34010,keith_a_teel,,56.42,59.372,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1987.86-622,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,175.83,185.102,"Is that because of the text, Mr. Teel, that you say that review of Regs to see if they comply with non-VA statutes?"
1987.86-622,0,34010,keith_a_teel,,185.102,197.409,"It is because of the text and because of the legislative history and the statutory scheme for review that we believe Congress created here, which I will explain in just a moment."
1987.86-622,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,646.156,649.608,How about challenges to regulations under VA Statutes?
1987.86-622,0,34010,keith_a_teel,,649.608,665.034,Our position is that regulations generally are reviewable because of the distinction between decisions and regulations that we believe is in Section 4004.
1987.86-622,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,667.652,680.96,The Government says there are just thousands and thousands of regulations if you say any decision based on a regulation is reviewable that there are just going to be all sorts of cases coming into the courts.
1987.86-622,0,34010,keith_a_teel,,680.96,683.662,"Well, I know they say that, and I think the experience--"
1987.86-622,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,683.662,694.137,Do you have reason to doubt it if we were to say that VA statute regulations as well as non-VA statute regulations were reviewable?
1987.86-622,0,34010,keith_a_teel,,694.137,696.339,--I think there is quite a lot of reason to doubt it.
1987.86-622,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,711.264,716.316,And these were allowing review of regulations based on VA statutes?
1987.86-622,0,34010,keith_a_teel,,716.316,716.732,Yes.
1987.86-622,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,783.507,795.565,"But Mr. Teel, here we have the Veterans' Administration appearing formally before us by the Solicitor General, and he's saying this is what the Veterans' Administration, this is their position."
1987.86-622,0,34010,keith_a_teel,,805.254,808.456,"I'm disputing that, Your Honor."
1987.86-622,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,808.456,812.258,But you say the Veterans' Administration itself believes the way you do.
1987.86-622,0,34010,keith_a_teel,,814.277,819.43,"Well, I would think so myself, but that doesn't seem to be what we have here."
1987.86-622,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,831.071,842.879,"Well, you say legislative support, and you've cited states made, or you think were made... and probably were... by VA people to the Congress, but that isn't legislative support."
1987.86-622,0,34010,keith_a_teel,,845.062,850.45,I agree with you it is not legislative history in the sense that this Court often refers to it.
1987.86-622,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,850.45,851.233,In any orthodox sense.
1987.86-622,0,34010,keith_a_teel,,851.233,851.652,Pardon me?
1987.86-622,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,851.652,852.785,Or in any orthodox sense.
1987.86-622,0,34010,keith_a_teel,,852.785,853.451,That's correct.
1987.86-622,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,871.247,879.352,"Yes, but this statutory provision really doesn't have much to do with what the Agency does; it describes what courts may do."
1987.86-622,0,34010,keith_a_teel,,879.352,884.804,"Nevertheless, I think that the Agency lives day to day with this statute."
1987.86-622,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,944.961,951.948,"I guess under your view, disability payments would have to be made as well, wouldn't they?"
1987.86-622,0,34010,keith_a_teel,,951.948,965.124,"Well, it is a troubling aspect of this case, as the Government points out, that the VA uses the same term, willful misconduct, in its disability statutes as it does in these educational benefits statutes."
1987.86-622,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,991.339,994.893,"Well, it would be pretty hard to distinguish legally, wouldn't it, if you're right?"
1987.86-622,0,34010,keith_a_teel,,994.893,997.093,"--Well, under the current statutes, it is."
1987.86-622,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1151.023,1153.975,You feel that's an irrebuttable presumption.
1987.86-622,0,34010,keith_a_teel,,1153.975,1155.141,Yes.
1987.86-622,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1243.394,1250.415,"Mr. Teel, I would like to go back because your argument I think raises the point to the question Justice O'Connor asked you earlier."
1987.86-622,0,34010,keith_a_teel,,1272.996,1275.448,"I think the answer to the question is, yes."
1987.86-622,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1283.804,1289.625,Your arguments against doing so in the tolling context seem to me to apply equally to the disability benefit claim context.
1987.86-622,0,34010,keith_a_teel,,1289.625,1291.641,"I'm sorry, I don't understand the question."
1987.86-622,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1291.641,1304.718,"You're explaining why they should not do it in the context of tolling the ten-year prohibition, but doesn't your argument also apply equally to a claim by a veteran for disability benefits based on his alcoholism?"
1987.86-622,0,34010,keith_a_teel,,1304.718,1308.837,"I think it well might, yes, sir."
1987.86-622,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1308.837,1312.971,So you don't really buy Judge Ginsburg's distinction of the two.
1987.86-622,0,34010,keith_a_teel,,1318.692,1322.846,"Well, I think, as Justice O'Connor notes, it's a tough distinction to make."
1987.86-622,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1371.975,1380.128,"Not only the same language in the Statute and the Regulation, but also legislative history suggesting at least in 1977 Congress intended the two rules to be the same."
1987.86-622,0,34010,keith_a_teel,,1380.128,1380.996,"Well, that's right."
1987.86-622,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1405.696,1408.814,Isn't this tough enough for us to take it one step at a time?
1987.86-622,0,34010,keith_a_teel,,1408.814,1412.266,"Well, in fact, I think it is, it's very difficult."
1987.86-622,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1427.442,1451.725,"If there had been no Rehabilitation Act, the Veterans' Administration would withstand challenge of its interpretation and application to alcoholics of this tolling provision, without the Rehabilitation Act Section 504, you would not have a case, I take it?"
1987.86-622,0,34010,keith_a_teel,,1451.725,1453.51,"Well, I think we would have a much more difficult case."
1987.86-622,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1453.51,1456.379,But that's your principal reliance?
1987.86-622,0,34010,keith_a_teel,,1456.379,1458.879,"Yes, we are principally relying on Section 504."
1987.86-622,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1458.879,1469.985,"So here's an Act that was being administered as it was supposed to be administered, and then came the Rehabilitation Act and you say there's a fundamental inconsistency between the two statutes?"
1987.86-622,0,34010,keith_a_teel,,1469.985,1471.853,"No, actually that's what the Government argues."
1987.86-622,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1474.905,1475.405,What are you arguing?
1987.86-622,0,34010,keith_a_teel,,1475.405,1478.524,"Well, our point is that the inconsistency here--"
1987.86-622,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1478.524,1487.612,"Yes, but you say that the Rehabilitation Act requires the Veterans' Administration to change its views."
1987.86-622,0,34010,keith_a_teel,,1487.612,1490.981,--It's views as expressed in a regulation.
1987.86-622,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1499.087,1510.745,"I know, but I thought that you answered that the Veterans' Administration position in its regulation would be perfectly acceptable absent the Rehabilitation Act."
1987.86-622,0,34010,keith_a_teel,,1510.745,1512.095,--No.
1987.86-622,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1517.565,1529.29,"Assume for the moment that the Regulation was quite valid, absent the Rehabilitation Act, and hence the Regulation is a valid regulation under the applicable statutes."
1987.86-622,0,34010,keith_a_teel,,1535.276,1538.395,I concede it would be more difficult to challenge that.
1987.86-622,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1538.395,1542.697,"Well, let's assume that it was a permissible interpretation of the statute."
1987.86-622,0,34010,keith_a_teel,,1551.786,1557.29,"That's right, but that does not have the affect, as the Government suggests, of repealing the '77 Statute."
1987.86-622,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1564.963,1575.568,"Well, the reason they can't is because it is no longer a permissible interpretation of the Veterans' Statute."
1987.86-622,0,34010,keith_a_teel,,1575.568,1583.988,"Well, it is no longer permissible with these statutes with the Rehabilitation Act to define a condition, a handicapping condition under the Rehab Act."
1987.86-622,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1585.488,1602.283,"Yes, but you're arguing that the Rehabilitation Act means that the Veterans' laws governing the Veterans' Administration can no longer be construed the way the Veterans' Administration has been construing them."
1987.86-622,0,34010,keith_a_teel,,1602.283,1610.638,"--If you assume, as is correct, the regulations implement that statute, I will concede that point, but there is no inherent contradiction between the two statutes, we believe."
1987.86-622,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1618.292,1631.016,But you say that the Rehabilitation Act means that there is no longer any room to construe the laws of the Veterans' Administration is administering in the way that they have been construed.
1987.86-622,0,34010,keith_a_teel,,1631.016,1636.92,--Make a blanket determination that alcoholics have engaged in misconduct we believe that's inconsistent with the Rehabilitation Act.
1987.86-622,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1636.92,1642.74,"Even though absent it, it was quite consistent with the Veterans' Administration laws?"
1987.86-622,0,34010,keith_a_teel,,1642.74,1648.227,"Well, actually, I'm not so sure it is inconsistent with the Veterans' Administration laws."
1987.86-622,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1667.523,1672.343,In light of the Senate history in 1977?
1987.86-622,0,34010,keith_a_teel,,1672.343,1676.962,"Well, again, the Government, I believe, places too much reliance on that history."
1987.86-622,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1700.243,1703.112,"Thank you, Mr. Teel."
1987.86-622,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1704.862,1706.931,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1987.86-622,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1752.509,1758.329,You're going to explain how the Rehab Act is administered by the Veterans' Administration?
1987.86-622,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1758.329,1773.673,"I'm going to explain how what's being challenged in this case is a decision by the Administrator under a law administered by the VA, namely the decision was to deny the particular extension on the educational benefits program to the petitioners."
1987.86-622,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1820.802,1828.891,"Mr. Ganzfried, I want to be sure... as long as the ten years has not expired, the veteran is entitled to this assistance, isn't he?"
1987.86-622,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1828.891,1829.391,That's correct.
1987.86-622,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1829.391,1831.26,Even though he's an alcoholic?
1987.86-622,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1831.26,1831.926,That's correct.
1987.86-622,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1831.926,1839.698,And all you're doing is denying him the necessary time to get the full benefit?
1987.86-622,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1839.698,1846.935,He is not in a position from anyone else who is not handicapped.
1987.86-622,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1914.057,1925.079,"Well, I take it you imply that their delay in completing their education was due to the continuing disability due to alcoholism?"
1987.86-622,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1925.079,1945.576,"What I mean to say is that as the Board of Veterans' Appeals determined in this case, they did not meet any of the statutory or VA regulatory criteria for qualifying for the extension."
1987.86-622,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1945.576,1950.146,Isn't it somewhat unrealistic.
1987.86-622,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1959.252,1976.63,"Well, we're not assuming that because had they suffered consequential physical disabilities, consequential physical effects of the alcoholism that themselves would have qualified as a disability, they would have gotten the benefits."
1987.86-622,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1976.63,1989.021,"Yes, but still, doesn't the alcoholism itself, assuming it's serious enough, would not that prevent a person from passing college grade courses?"
1987.86-622,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1989.021,2015.088,It could but it would be the derivative physical effects of the alcoholism and the determination in these cases by the Board was that the physical effects on which the petitioners relied did not satisfy to meet other regulatory requirements as to how severe a disability you have to show to get your benefits.
1987.86-622,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2015.088,2018.54,I really don't understand your argument.
1987.86-622,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,2018.54,2018.907,Okay.
1987.86-622,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2020.992,2029.246,"I mean, the physical effect is just that the person is consuming so much alcohol that he or she is unable to live a normal life."
1987.86-622,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,2031.098,2036.001,--I take issue with one statement there.
1987.86-622,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2050.678,2056.665,"--Yes, but that conduct itself is sufficient to prevent the person from acquiring an education, isn't it?"
1987.86-622,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,2056.665,2061.283,--Only if he has the consequential physical disabilities.
1987.86-622,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2061.283,2088.184,"Maybe in the Government's interpretation of the regulation, it doesn't count, but just as a practical matter whether it was otherwise qualified or not, if he is consuming large quantities of alcohol 24 hours a day, six days a week, and there's nothing else... he doesn't break his leg in an accident or anything like the no other conduct... but isn't that itself something that as a practical matter makes it rather unrealistic to suggest he should be taking advantage of this education benefit."
1987.86-622,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,2088.184,2092.42,"Well, what I have to understand in the question is are there any physical consequences of his consuming--"
1987.86-622,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2092.42,2093.737,He's drunk all the time.
1987.86-622,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,2093.737,2120.405,"--Well, in that case, if he's consuming alcohol 24 hours a day, if he's not eating, then he's going to have nutritional deficiencies, he's going to have vitamin deficiencies which is specified in the VA regulation as... he may have all kinds of other physical maladies and consequences of it, and if he has those and if he proves them, he gets the benefits."
1987.86-622,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2125.059,2131.396,But is being dead drunk so to speak a physical consequence that would entitle him to some sort of benefits?
1987.86-622,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,2131.396,2133.415,Being unconscious?
1987.86-622,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2133.415,2134.165,Yes.
1987.86-622,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,2134.165,2142.937,The question is whether it's a disability that would have prevented someone from pursuing an education.
1987.86-622,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2188.133,2195.738,"If he had been hospitalized for 30 days because of alcoholism, then he would have gotten credit for that 30 days in the tolling?"
1987.86-622,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,2195.738,2203.059,"He may have, depending on how the Board looked at what evidence he presented."
1987.86-622,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2229.043,2236.28,But this rule doesn't say anything about physical manifestations or anything else about being drunk or anything.
1987.86-622,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,2240.867,2242.017,"No, it does not say that."
1987.86-622,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2242.017,2243.136,What does it say?
1987.86-622,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,2243.136,2250.873,The VA rule is that alcoholism is divided into two categories: primary alcoholism and secondary.
1987.86-622,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2250.873,2251.523,Right.
1987.86-622,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,2251.523,2261.014,"Secondary alcoholism, which is the result of any underlying psychiatric disorder, is not a disqualification."
1987.86-622,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2263.098,2265.732,That has nothing to do with how much liquor he drinks or anything else.
1987.86-622,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,2265.732,2269.517,"Well, whether someone's an alcoholic doesn't always depend on how much liquor he drinks."
1987.86-622,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2269.517,2273.071,That's what I'm talking about; that's exactly what I'm complaining about.
1987.86-622,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,2273.071,2280.225,"There are people who may drink as much as someone who is an alcoholic, and yet those people are not alcoholics."
1987.86-622,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2293.402,2300.389,"I guess he couldn't teach either, could he, if he's an alcoholic?"
1987.86-622,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,2301.739,2305.126,"An active alcoholic, 24 hours a day, seven days a week?"
1987.86-622,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2305.126,2306.892,Yes.
1987.86-622,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,2306.892,2309.161,And showing the physical manifestations of that?
1987.86-622,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2309.161,2309.678,Yes.

1987.86-622,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2320.386,2320.952,Who are sick.
1987.86-622,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,2324.57,2326.939,--That alcoholism is an illness?
1987.86-622,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2326.939,2327.872,That alcoholism is an illness?
1987.86-622,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,2327.872,2336.812,We submit that it's basically an irrelevant question in this context for reasons very similar to--
1987.86-622,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2336.812,2341.615,"Well, do you mind answering an irrelevant question?"
1987.86-622,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,2346.817,2347.935,--It can be.
1987.86-622,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2349.569,2353.839,"Do you agree that the ""average alcoholism"" in quotes, is an illness?"
1987.86-622,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,2353.839,2355.923,"Well, we don't know what the average alcoholism is."
1987.86-622,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2355.923,2360.493,"Well, the one that you're talking about in your statute?"

1987.86-622,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2361.877,2363.279,"Yes, sir."
1987.86-622,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,2363.279,2365.112,"Okay, what is defined in the regulations--"
1987.86-622,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2365.112,2366.031,Is that an illness?
1987.86-622,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,2366.031,2370.366,--It can be.
1987.86-622,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2370.366,2371.016,Is it?
1987.86-622,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,2371.016,2372.018,It is not always.
1987.86-622,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2372.018,2376.42,"It's in your Statute, you put it in there."
1987.86-622,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,2376.42,2387.91,"Well, it's in the Regulation and the term primary alcoholism is essentially what the VA has determined to be willful alcoholism."
1987.86-622,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2387.91,2389.446,Is it an illness?
1987.86-622,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,2389.446,2390.196,It can be.
1987.86-622,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2393.514,2395.93,"Mr. Ganzfried, if it's not an illness, what is it?"
1987.86-622,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,2395.93,2409.024,"It can be conduct, it can be a compulsion short of an illness, it can be an inclination short of a compulsion, it can be a predisposition."
1987.86-622,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2409.024,2409.374,Is that what they're talking about?
1987.86-622,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,2409.374,2410.374,"Well, we don't know."
1987.86-622,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2410.374,2411.807,"Oh, you mean the statute's indefinite?"
1987.86-622,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,2411.807,2417.111,The statute simply says disability not the result of willful misconduct.
1987.86-622,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2417.111,2418.461,And the regulations are indefinite.
1987.86-622,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,2423.598,2430.936,It's not talking about any questions of taking away anyone's livelihood.
1987.86-622,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2430.936,2432.92,"Well, I'm asking you, is it an illness, or not?"

1987.86-622,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,2453.534,2455.319,"Well, this statute doesn't say, alcoholism."
1987.86-622,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2455.319,2456.403,It says primary?
1987.86-622,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,2456.403,2461.823,"No, it's a regulation and the VA policy, it says primary regulation."
1987.86-622,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2461.823,2469.996,"Well, is that regulation an illness when it says alcoholism in the regulation?"
1987.86-622,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,2469.996,2471.713,It doesn't address the question whether it's an illness.
1987.86-622,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2471.713,2473.947,"Well, does it say alcoholism?"
1987.86-622,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,2478.268,2479.184,Primary alcoholism.
1987.86-622,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2479.184,2486.422,"Well, is that or not... I'm going to try this one more time, and then I'm through: Is it or is it not an illness."
1987.86-622,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,2486.422,2488.29,The regulation doesn't say.
1987.86-622,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2488.29,2491.242,"Well, is it or is it not."
1987.86-622,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,2496.063,2502.717,"In terms of providing rehabilitation and treatment, the answer to that, in terms of the Veterans' Administration is, yes."
1987.86-622,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2516.893,2518.293,"You agree, it is an illness."
1987.86-622,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,2518.293,2520.178,In some contexts.
1987.86-622,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2520.178,2523.463,"It took quite awhile, but I made it."
1987.86-622,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,2543.009,2543.544,No.
1987.86-622,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2611.986,2615.557,"Yes, but Mr. Ganzfried, that's because these cases arise in that particular way."
1987.86-622,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,2632.316,2637.137,Without ever first doing something like petitioning the administrator of the VA to reconsider?
1987.86-622,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2643.707,2644.29,"It's the regulation, I suppose."
1987.86-622,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,2644.29,2659.983,"--or it's a regulation that was promulgated in 1972 before the Rehabilitation Act was passed, six years before it became applicable to Federal programs, and it's simply not an appropriate basis for Federal jurisdiction to come into Court--"
1987.86-622,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2659.983,2661.251,"Well, maybe it's a challenge of the failure of the VA to--"
1987.86-622,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,2661.251,2665.786,--without having gone to the head of the Agency petitioning him to reconsider his regulation as--
1987.86-622,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2665.786,2675.594,"--No, but all I'm suggesting is that if you brought that kind of a lawsuit, the language of 211(a) would not read upon it."
1987.86-622,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,2675.594,2676.228,--It might.
1987.86-622,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2684.284,2685.067,"The Administrator could say, as he did here--"
1987.86-622,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,2685.067,2690.604,--the benefits law to have the following consequences on the benefits law as a result of the Rehabilitation Act.
1987.86-622,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2690.604,2696.508,"--Or the VA could say, as it did here, we're just not interested in deciding that question."
1987.86-622,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,2698.108,2699.627,The Board of Veterans' Appeals didn't decide it here.
1987.86-622,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2703.161,2708.065,"And your position is that nobody should decide it, nobody should decide it, because the agency refused to and the Court says we can't."
1987.86-622,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,2708.065,2712.767,"--No, we've got to forums here, neither one of which was addressed by the petitioners."
1987.86-622,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2740.954,2749.441,"Yes, but the question is whether that regulation, as interpreted by the Administrator, continues to comport with the law that was passed in 1978."
1987.86-622,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,2749.441,2770.687,"--Yes, and the answer is you go back to the Administrator, the person who promulgated the regulation, 553(e) of the Administrative Procedure Act, which has been incorporated here by the VA, says you go back and you petition to the head of the Agency, or you go to Congress."
1987.86-622,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2770.687,2771.504,No.
1987.86-622,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,2777.289,2780.776,"Well, it's altogether different from this case and it's not a concession that--"
1987.86-622,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2780.776,2783.978,"--Yes, but are you contending that the Statute would bar such a proceeding?"
1987.86-622,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,2785.828,2786.764,--Because they could have gotten relief.
1987.86-622,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2816.699,2823.187,"Yes, but I don't understand that as a jurisdictional argument unless you're saying that there would have been review under the Administrative Procedure Act."
1987.86-622,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,2829.774,2830.876,"That's right, but they did none of them."
1987.86-622,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2830.876,2833.577,The question is whether the Statute requires them to do those.
1987.86-622,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,2840.481,2850.503,"If ultimately what it was was a decision by the Administrator under a law administered by the VA, the answer to that has got to be that there would not be judicial review."
1987.86-622,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2960.891,2962.926,How did it read before the amendment?
1987.86-622,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,2962.926,2990.827,"It used the term, claims, and what the D.C. Circuit had said, well, that would preclude judicial review if you're coming in and applying for benefits, but in instances where benefits were discontinued or benefits were forfeited for some reason, the Court had held that you can come into court because that's not a claim for benefits, that's something that happens after you're already getting benefits."
1987.86-622,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3106.966,3110.851,"May I ask one question on that point, Mr. Ganzfried?"
1987.86-622,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,3110.851,3111.37,--Sure.
1987.86-622,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3111.37,3132.034,Do you agree with the view taken by then-Judge Scalia in the McKelvey case that the Administrator necessarily decided in the benefit claims case that the regulation was consistent with the Rehab Act?
1987.86-622,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,3132.034,3136.568,I didn't hear the middle part--
1987.86-622,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3136.568,3138.453,"Judge Scalia's view in the McKelvey case, do you agree with it?"
1987.86-622,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,3138.453,3164.069,"--I think that view as amplified in his opinion in the Gott case, Gott v. Walters, an earlier case that was the opinion was vacated upon granting of rehearing en banc and then the case was settled but the opinion is cited in some of the briefs mentioned briefly in a quotation in our brief."
1987.86-622,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3180.495,3188.434,Would that view have implications for us in terms of our jurisdiction in other cases do you think?
1987.86-622,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,3188.434,3191.886,The question of whether a decision--
1987.86-622,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3191.886,3196.004,Whether necessarily encompasses others?
1987.86-622,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,3196.004,3198.473,--It would have enormous implications.
1987.86-622,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3436.442,3437.994,"Mr. Ganzfried, may I ask you this question."
1987.86-622,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,3451.451,3475.651,"It would have made it awfully difficult and the VA came to that conclusion, because there's legislative history in 1979 and 1981 when members of the Senate Committee that oversees the VA said we really don't want you to apply this alcoholism standard in the educational benefits extension context."
1987.86-622,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3495.946,3496.397,I understand that.
1987.86-622,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,3497.014,3497.78,--and the provision from the manual.
1987.86-622,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3509.522,3518.894,--Do you think they would have been bound by that 1977 history even if they read the 1978 legislation the way your opponent does?
1987.86-622,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,3518.894,3535.622,"I think the answer to that is still yes, but it's a question for the Administrator to take up in the first instance because the 1978 legislation is more general and it doesn't repeal something that's more specific."
1987.86-622,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3543.711,3544.995,"Thank you, Mr. Ganzfried."
1987.86-622,2,34010,keith_a_teel,,3546.58,3548.813,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1987.86-622,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3569.077,3575.315,Didn't Powell say it wouldn't apply the Robinson principle in the case of alcoholics?
1987.86-622,2,34010,keith_a_teel,,3575.315,3576.849,No.
