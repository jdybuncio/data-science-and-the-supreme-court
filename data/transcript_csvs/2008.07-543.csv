2008.07-543,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.404,"We will hear argument next in Case 07-543, AT&T Corporation v. Hulteen."
2008.07-543,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,8.27,33.721,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: When Judge Wood on the Seventh Circuit addressed precisely the same issue that's before this Court, I think she correctly observed that the distinction between an ongoing violation that arises with each new use of a seniority system and the present effect of a past discrimination is a distinction that is subtle at best."
2008.07-543,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,108.185,122.962,"But at the time -- at the time of the original reduction of credits, was there any right claimed that any of these women had?"
2008.07-543,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,150.346,153.5,"Justice Ginsburg, they not only could have, but they did."
2008.07-543,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,225.929,228.548,But it hadn't been applied in any of those situations yet.
2008.07-543,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,255.199,259.567,"Well, Justice Ginsburg, I -- I question the premise that there was nothing to be done."
2008.07-543,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,330.247,361.801,"But you -- you have to, I think, recognize that there's a big difference between Evans, who was told, goodbye, you got married, you have to resign -- a definite act that had immediate consequences -- and this, where there -- there is a potential for future consequences but no immediate consequence of the kind that existed in your model case, Evans."
2008.07-543,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,361.801,368.121,"--I mean, Justice Ginsburg, there's -- there's no question that the impact in Evans is -- is stronger than the impact here."
2008.07-543,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,544.868,546.82,But that was when Gilbert was prevailing.
2008.07-543,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,549.855,554.806,"--Well, I don't know whether it would be regarded as facially discriminatory today."
2008.07-543,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,606.441,613.011,But you -- what about -- I'm trying to work with this distinction where I agree with you that it's hard to see exactly what it is.
2008.07-543,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,638.876,639.578,--Right.
2008.07-543,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,639.578,648.934,"Then later it turns out that they are keeping that salary structure, although not for racially motivated reasons."
2008.07-543,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,706.604,719.744,"Justice Breyer, I -- I -- in looking at this case, I have long thought of it as kind of an M.C. Escher picture, where you look at it from one direction and it looks one way, and then you turn it and you look at it the other way, and it looks completely different to you."
2008.07-543,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,747.745,754.465,"Yes, but why can't you make exactly the same kind of analysis here?"
2008.07-543,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,791.006,802.212,"I -- I mean, I think the answer to that, Justice Souter, is that's not -- that's certainly not an implausible way of trying to look at this problem, but if you look at the language of this Court two terms ago in Ledbetter, and I'll quote it for you:"
2008.07-543,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,821.44,826.344,"Well, do you -- do you see Ledbetter in effect as -- as overruling Bazemore?"
2008.07-543,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,826.344,848.241,"No, I think Ledbetter deals with Bazemore in the context of a -- of a true seniority system and an arrangement in which what you are looking at -- because our case is a fortiori from -- from Evans and -- and Ledbetter because, remember, we are talking about a situation where what we did at the time, in our judgment, was perfectly legal."
2008.07-543,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,848.241,857.18,"And -- and at the time, in Bazemore, that the private employers discriminated for racial purposes, that was not unconstitutional or illegal, either."
2008.07-543,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,857.18,858.965,"Right, I understand that, but--"
2008.07-543,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,858.965,859.965,"At that time, even--"
2008.07-543,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,859.965,860.565,--And then--
2008.07-543,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,860.565,861.315,--even more so.
2008.07-543,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,908.029,910.862,"--I mean, I understand that, Justice Ginsburg, and obviously we don't quarrel with that."
2008.07-543,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,933.608,951.07,"No, but I mean, that -- with respect, I think that sort of begs the question because if Bazemore is the right template for analyzing this case, then you're not in compliance when you -- when your payment of the pension benefit reflects the pregnancy differential."
2008.07-543,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,951.07,954.955,"--Justice Souter, there's no question that you can read Bazemore that way."
2008.07-543,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,973.316,979.47,Let me just be sure I understand one thing: Are you contending that the plan is not unlawful or that the claim is untimely?
2008.07-543,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,979.47,983.088,"We are -- well, both, actually."
2008.07-543,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,987.956,990.075,"At the time it was adopted, it was lawful."
2008.07-543,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,990.075,990.908,"--Right, exactly."
2008.07-543,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,995.477,996.595,"Thank you, counsel."
2008.07-543,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1001.883,1014.29,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Ninth Circuit's decision in this case impermissibly imposes retroactive liability on Petitioner, and Respondents' claims are in any event time-barred."
2008.07-543,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1014.29,1025.379,"Miss Blatt, that was not the position of the only representative of the United States in the Ninth Circuit, as far as I know, the EEOC, the brief in the Ninth Circuit."
2008.07-543,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1040.524,1041.691,You are absolutely correct.
2008.07-543,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1083.918,1090.94,"Would you -- would you -- excuse me -- would you agree that if -- well, let me be less rhetorical about it."
2008.07-543,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1120.626,1122.61,Unconstitutional?
2008.07-543,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1122.61,1123.162,Yes.
2008.07-543,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1123.162,1128.28,"I think -- I mean, the way I understand your case is that Congress can speak in clear language to impose retroactive--"
2008.07-543,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1128.28,1129.066,To make it retroactive.
2008.07-543,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1129.616,1130.366,--Retrospective liability.
2008.07-543,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1135.585,1144.575,So your -- your argument simply is a -- a purely statutory construction argument: That isn't what Congress had in mind.
2008.07-543,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1144.575,1147.777,"--Right, and your hypothetical statute would seem inconsistent with--"
2008.07-543,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1147.777,1152.681,"If Congress would have had in mind, then there would be a question whether Congress could do it, and you agree that it could."
2008.07-543,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1155.414,1169.857,"--That's right, and I think the -- the seniority system provision, 703(h), would just be completely counter to that hypothetical provision because Congress has taken special care to make sure seniority systems can continue to exist, even though they incorporate pre-Act discrimination."
2008.07-543,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1169.857,1174.094,Was this statute effective 180 days after its -- after signature?
2008.07-543,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1174.094,1180.164,"With respect to fringe benefit programs, I think it was effective on the date it passed."
2008.07-543,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1214.402,1219.956,Do you -- do you think Ledbetter modified or overruled Bazemore?
2008.07-543,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1219.956,1220.789,--No.
2008.07-543,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1283.363,1284.68,"Well, why does it upset--"
2008.07-543,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1284.68,1285.096,--you me to pay out money prospectively.
2008.07-543,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1285.096,1290.315,"--So far as pension benefits are concerned, it doesn't upset any employee's expectations."
2008.07-543,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1296.219,1299.17,"Well, I think of a pension plan as a zero-sum game."
2008.07-543,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1301.189,1305.343,"Well, but that -- I mean, that's -- that's an issue that you touched on, on your second point."
2008.07-543,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1336.913,1337.429,"--Well, I--"
2008.07-543,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1337.429,1340.33,"--And if we don't have it in the case, then this isn't a zero-sum game."
2008.07-543,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1340.33,1344.801,"--Well, we don't know what we have in the case, because it was -- it was -- liability was imposed on summary judgment."
2008.07-543,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1373.654,1391.032,"--But this is not a situation like Evans, somebody who was out of the workforce for 4 years and then is going to come back and bump some people who -- who filled in while she was not working, and get that credit."
2008.07-543,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1394.401,1399.888,"--No, I think some -- some of these people had very significant disabilities, over 6, 7 months."
2008.07-543,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1460.426,1472.834,"Do I correctly understand that -- that you would agree that if this plan were adopted today it would be unlawful, but because it was -- that at the time it was adopted, and the statute uses the word ""adopted"", it was lawful?"
2008.07-543,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1472.834,1474.103,--Let me be very clear on this.
2008.07-543,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1538.443,1548.234,"Before you -- do I understand your answer to Justice Stevens's question to be yes, it would be legal to adopt this seniority policy today?"
2008.07-543,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1548.234,1552.519,"--Yes -- the seniority system is their seniority system, and it's completely neutral and completely lawful."
2008.07-543,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1557.84,1558.706,"I understand, but we're--"
2008.07-543,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1558.706,1559.573,--that's unlawful today.
2008.07-543,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1563.91,1572.433,"--But even adopting the policy today -- which I thought was Justice Stevens's question, and maybe it's not -- that would be acceptable?"
2008.07-543,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1580.871,1586.942,"I -- AT&T could not adopt their leave policy today, and--"
2008.07-543,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1586.942,1588.109,They couldn't adopt the leave policy.
2008.07-543,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1596.631,1597.065,--Oh.
2008.07-543,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1618.079,1618.695,"Thank you, Ms. Blatt."
2008.07-543,2,33970,kevin_k_russell,,1628.602,1648.564,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The distinction between Evans and this case turns on the difference between discrimination outside of the seniority system which affects an employee's ability to provide service to the employer, and discrimination within the seniority system itself that gives unequal credit for equal service."
2008.07-543,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1664.275,1665.991,May I ask a question?
2008.07-543,2,33970,kevin_k_russell,,1672.881,1675.114,--This is a disparate treatment case.
2008.07-543,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1675.114,1680.868,When did the -- when did the intentional discrimination take place?
2008.07-543,2,33970,kevin_k_russell,,1680.868,1687.641,"It took place when AT&T applied an accrual rule to my clients' disability leave, and said--"
2008.07-543,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1687.641,1692.509,You do not -- you do not contend that the plan was unlawful at the time it was adopted?
2008.07-543,2,33970,kevin_k_russell,,1692.509,1695.395,"--We think that it was, but it doesn't matter."
2008.07-543,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1721.445,1733.02,"Well, let me ask you this question: At the time the plan was adopted, discrimination on the basis of pregnancy was not discrimination on the basis of sex, according to the majority in Gilbert."
2008.07-543,2,33970,kevin_k_russell,,1733.02,1734.253,That's correct.
2008.07-543,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1734.253,1734.836,Which I happen to disagree with.
2008.07-543,2,33970,kevin_k_russell,,1740.09,1746.477,"Well, we think it was unlawful for two reasons, and one is that it was unlawful under Satty."
2008.07-543,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1747.262,1747.762,Under what?
2008.07-543,2,33970,kevin_k_russell,,1747.762,1756.035,"--Under Satty, under the Court's decision in Satty that said discrimination with respect to seniority had an unlawful discriminatory impact on the basis of sex."
2008.07-543,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1756.035,1764.641,That was -- that was coming back to work and having all of your seniority stripped.
2008.07-543,2,33970,kevin_k_russell,,1765.324,1774.58,"That is correct, but we don't think that there's a distinction because what the Court said was that the injury is cognizable because it affects employment opportunities."
2008.07-543,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1774.58,1780.401,"Yes, but I thought the question was whether it was unlawful at the time, before the later statute."
2008.07-543,2,33970,kevin_k_russell,,1780.401,1782.436,"Yes, and we think--"
2008.07-543,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1782.436,1800.064,"And -- and you say that, even though discriminating against pregnancy leave was itself lawful, a retirement plan that did not give you credit for the time of that pregnancy leave was unlawful?"
2008.07-543,2,33970,kevin_k_russell,,1800.064,1800.53,--No.
2008.07-543,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1814.205,1816.257,And you say Gilbert had nothing to do with it?
2008.07-543,2,33970,kevin_k_russell,,1816.257,1820.209,Gilbert said that it wasn't intentional discrimination on the basis of sex.
2008.07-543,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1849.145,1849.695,Could you -- could I pause?
2008.07-543,2,33970,kevin_k_russell,,1869.974,1872.343,"Had a disparate impact on the basis of sex, yes."
2008.07-543,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1877.064,1879.397,"Well, maybe I'm missing it."
2008.07-543,2,33970,kevin_k_russell,,1888.186,1889.955,That's every disparate impact case.
2008.07-543,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1892.24,1894.107,"No, I -- I don't think it's every disparate impact case."
2008.07-543,2,33970,kevin_k_russell,,1911.868,1913.403,--Let me just be clear about the terms.
2008.07-543,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1931.465,1947.558,"Well, but Gilbert said it wasn't discrimination on the basis of sex, because it said that discrimination on the basis of pregnancy was not discrimination on the basis of sex; and yet you are saying if there is a disparate impact on the basis of pregnancy, then it is discrimination on the basis of sex."
2008.07-543,2,33970,kevin_k_russell,,1947.558,1948.558,--Let me try one more time.
2008.07-543,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1960.146,1971.804,"Is your -- is there any other -- can you cite a case to me where we have held there is discriminatory treatment, but that's lawful, but the discriminatory impact of that is unlawful?"
2008.07-543,2,33970,kevin_k_russell,,1971.804,1979.409,"--Well, I think a height requirement would be intentional discrimination on the basis of height that could have an unlawful disparate impact on the basis of sex."
2008.07-543,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1999.74,2004.358,"But does the statute use the term -- does the statute use the term ""facially discriminatory system""?"
2008.07-543,2,33970,kevin_k_russell,,2004.358,2004.742,--No.
2008.07-543,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2006.744,2007.177,Right.
2008.07-543,2,33970,kevin_k_russell,,2007.177,2012.048,And there's no dispute that a facially discriminatory system discriminates intentionally.
2008.07-543,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2012.581,2022.236,"It is also clear that -- is it also clear that a statute -- that -- that a plan that does not intentionally discriminate may, nevertheless, discriminate facially?"
2008.07-543,2,33970,kevin_k_russell,,2024.355,2026.39,"--Well, again, it's -- it's the predicates that change."
2008.07-543,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2049.637,2055.041,"--Yes, but that was the current application of a system that was plainly discriminatory, intentionally discriminatory."
2008.07-543,2,33970,kevin_k_russell,,2058.779,2059.229,--Yes.
2008.07-543,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2072.769,2073.952,"Go on, finish."
2008.07-543,2,33970,kevin_k_russell,,2074.585,2082.125,"--And, under Section 706(e)( 2), the question is simply whether that discrimination is unlawful at the time of application--"
2008.07-543,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2082.125,2091.564,--I don't understand why you say that the retirement plan is facially discriminatory now.
2008.07-543,2,33970,kevin_k_russell,,2095.365,2096.015,"--Yes, it's--"
2008.07-543,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2096.015,2116.779,"It seems to me what the retirement plan says is that there is deducted from your seniority, for purposes of calculating what you get under the plan, all periods in which you -- you were lawfully not deemed to be -- to be working for the company."
2008.07-543,2,33970,kevin_k_russell,,2120.298,2123.452,--I think it's -- the system is facially discriminatory -- there are several parts.
2008.07-543,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2137.759,2138.442,"No, but it didn't."
2008.07-543,2,33970,kevin_k_russell,,2144.846,2145.329,There's no--
2008.07-543,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2145.329,2151.4,"After the new legislation was passed, yes, pregnancy leave counts for seniority."
2008.07-543,2,33970,kevin_k_russell,,2179.336,2186.49,--It facially discriminates on the basis of pregnancy and then does so whether the pregnancy discrimination was unlawful at the time or not.
2008.07-543,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2204.552,2208.856,"Is -- is there a difference between ""facially discriminatory"" and ""discriminatory impact""?"
2008.07-543,2,33970,kevin_k_russell,,2233.637,2237.173,"--Well, that scenario, I think, is indistinguishable from what happened in Bazemore."
2008.07-543,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2260.122,2262.622,Did it say it was facially discriminatory?
2008.07-543,2,33970,kevin_k_russell,,2269.959,2271.292,"No, Bazemore did not use that term."
2008.07-543,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2324.259,2327.211,"No, but in Bazemore each paycheck was discriminatory."
2008.07-543,2,33970,kevin_k_russell,,2327.211,2331.68,It was discriminatory in the sense that it paid unequal wages for equal work.
2008.07-543,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2337.734,2341.971,But the reason for that is because they adopted a plan a long time ago that was lawful.
2008.07-543,2,33970,kevin_k_russell,,2341.971,2344.673,"Well, the same thing was true in Bazemore."
2008.07-543,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2345.257,2347.625,They're not applying a plan in Bazemore.
2008.07-543,2,33970,kevin_k_russell,,2353.029,2357.48,--They were applying a pay structure that was adopted--
2008.07-543,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2357.48,2360.616,"Yes, they were still paying -- each paycheck was a discriminatory paycheck."
2008.07-543,2,33970,kevin_k_russell,,2369.372,2376.728,--The paychecks were in -- in Bazemore were intentionally discriminatory only insofar as you look back to the pre-Title VII--
2008.07-543,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2376.728,2377.911,And that's what I disagree with.
2008.07-543,2,33970,kevin_k_russell,,2385.5,2386.634,--And the same is true here.
2008.07-543,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2387.467,2400.843,"The -- the point that is not true that -- that Justice Stevens is bringing out is that, in this case, you had a plan which was established at a time when the plan was -- was lawful."
2008.07-543,2,33970,kevin_k_russell,,2427.911,2428.844,--It's not irrelevant.
2008.07-543,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2434.448,2435.683,"Well, how would it do that?"
2008.07-543,2,33970,kevin_k_russell,,2435.683,2440.468,"--Well, the -- in Florida v. Long -- there's a long line of cases where this Court--"
2008.07-543,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2440.468,2443.103,"Well, you're -- you're not asking the Court to do that, are you?"
2008.07-543,2,33970,kevin_k_russell,,2466.119,2474.642,--We're not asking for that because we don't think that there are substantial reliance interests that are -- with respect to the -- the liquidity of the -- the pension plan that are affected here.
2008.07-543,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2475.592,2477.008,How -- how do we -- you think that?
2008.07-543,2,33970,kevin_k_russell,,2478.042,2478.544,--Well--
2008.07-543,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2478.544,2482.662,How do we know -- maybe -- maybe I can put the same question in a different way.
2008.07-543,2,33970,kevin_k_russell,,2517.752,2531.477,"--I don't think you are, which is why I do think that it's perfectly appropriate for this Court to do what it did in cases like Manhart, which is to say there's one definition of VII, and it's not going to vary depending on whether we're talking about the pension plan or something else."
2008.07-543,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2531.477,2543.367,But -- but doesn't the risk or the potential of a fixed-fund pension plan where employees who are not parties to this action receive less?
2008.07-543,2,33970,kevin_k_russell,,2546.219,2547.021,There's only that--
2008.07-543,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2547.021,2550.223,And shouldn't that possibility be weighed in the decision of this Court?
2008.07-543,2,33970,kevin_k_russell,,2552.342,2556.794,"--And my suggestion is, number one, that there's no realistic possibility of that here."
2008.07-543,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2558.662,2564.9,And there's no realistic possibility that some pensions are based on a fixed fund which has been established already?
2008.07-543,2,33970,kevin_k_russell,,2564.9,2566.85,--I don't think so.
2008.07-543,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2574.006,2579.825,But I take it that this decision you want us to write applies across the board to all plaintiffs.
2008.07-543,2,33970,kevin_k_russell,,2579.825,2595.019,"--I think that it does, but I think that it could quite possibly apply differently, for example, through a 401(k) plan where the discrimination would have occurred at a time when people are making running contributions."
2008.07-543,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2624.204,2643.233,"--Mr. Russell, what do you say to Mr. Phillips' argument that you brought -- you brought essentially this case way back when, that the union said that this retirement plan is in violation of Title VII?"
2008.07-543,2,33970,kevin_k_russell,,2643.233,2650.839,"--Well, first of all, I mean, my individual-named clients didn't bring those claims back then; and they lost, the union that brought this claim."
2008.07-543,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2698.07,2704.306,"Well, when you say there's relatively little amounts of money, can you tell us what amount -- what the maximum amount would be involved?"
2008.07-543,2,33970,kevin_k_russell,,2704.739,2706.489,I think -- and we haven't had discovery on this.
2008.07-543,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2712.71,2714.512,"--Would it be less than $100,000?"
2008.07-543,2,33970,kevin_k_russell,,2714.512,2715.195,--Per person?
2008.07-543,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2715.195,2717.364,Would it be -- for the whole suit?
2008.07-543,2,33970,kevin_k_russell,,2717.364,2717.964,No.
2008.07-543,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2722.768,2723.934,Would that be a million -- a million dollars?
2008.07-543,2,33970,kevin_k_russell,,2723.934,2724.634,It could be millions of dollars.
2008.07-543,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2725.634,2728.536,"But that -- that's a small amount of money, a million -- millions of dollars?"
2008.07-543,2,33970,kevin_k_russell,,2728.536,2732.707,--It's a small amount of money to a plan that has tens of billions of dollars in it.
2008.07-543,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2740.777,2759.238,"What -- what do you do about section 703(h) of Title VII, which -- which we have held says that -- that makes it lawful for a bona fide seniority system to perpetuate the effects of pre-Act discrimination?"
2008.07-543,2,33970,kevin_k_russell,,2759.238,2770.177,"The distinction between 703(h) and this case is that, in this case, we challenge a system, a seniority system that is itself facially discriminatory, and 703(h) says that doesn't apply--"
2008.07-543,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2770.177,2772.76,"That hinges -- that hinges on your ""facially discriminatory""."
2008.07-543,2,33970,kevin_k_russell,,2772.76,2773.295,--It does.
2008.07-543,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2783.485,2797.875,"Well, yes, that's -- that's rather implausible, but 70(h) covers sex discrimination and even race discrimination, but it doesn't cover pregnancy discrimination."
2008.07-543,2,33970,kevin_k_russell,,2798.494,2800.11,"You may think that, but--"
2008.07-543,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2800.11,2802.196,--You need pretty clear language to persuade me of that.
2008.07-543,2,33970,kevin_k_russell,,2802.196,2809.1,"--I think that in the end, I mean, it's worthwhile to focus on the consequences of accepting AT&T's view."
2008.07-543,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2867.655,2870.34,You mean there are a lot more suits coming behind this one--
2008.07-543,2,33970,kevin_k_russell,,2870.34,2872.208,"Well, I don't think--"
2008.07-543,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2872.208,2875.577,--for any kind of discrimination that preceded Title VII?
2008.07-543,2,33970,kevin_k_russell,,2876.96,2877.946,--1964.
2008.07-543,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2877.946,2880.379,There may be still some of those people around.
2008.07-543,2,33970,kevin_k_russell,,2880.379,2881.148,There are.
2008.07-543,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2884.766,2886.15,"I mean, you're scaring me."
2008.07-543,2,33970,kevin_k_russell,,2887.968,2900.626,"--Well, let me reassure you, because I think most employers, unlike AT&T, have -- don't make those kinds of distinctions with respect to their employees who were hired before and after the effective dates of the relevant provisions of Title VII."
2008.07-543,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2901.293,2911.75,"I take it you are not saying anything that is in effect and is still there, you do retro, you win."
2008.07-543,2,33970,kevin_k_russell,,2947.174,2948.907,"--Yes, that's -- that's right."
2008.07-543,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2955.493,2960.195,"It does that, but what I can't figure out is does that have a lot of implication for other areas or not?"
2008.07-543,2,33970,kevin_k_russell,,2962.964,2975.438,"Well, the difference between Ledbetter and this case is Ledbetter involved discrimination entirely outside of the seniority system, and as a result, it didn't -- 706(e)( 2) didn't apply; this Court's decision in Lorance didn't apply."
2008.07-543,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3052.972,3057.157,I still want to go back to assure that I've given you a fair opportunity to answer this.
2008.07-543,2,33970,kevin_k_russell,,3068.748,3070.067,--We make alternative arguments.
2008.07-543,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3070.067,3070.7,"Oh, okay."
2008.07-543,2,33970,kevin_k_russell,,3070.7,3077.82,"We argue that to the extent it matters whethers this was lawful at the time our clients took their leave, it was not unlawful, and we point to Satty."
2008.07-543,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3095.699,3098.365,"Well, as soon as you get back to the intentional, you get away from Satty."
2008.07-543,2,33970,kevin_k_russell,,3098.365,3100.234,"Yes, I agree with that."
2008.07-543,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3100.234,3101.184,"Oh, okay."
2008.07-543,2,33970,kevin_k_russell,,3101.184,3118.527,"But I don't think there can be any dispute that when my clients had their seniority reduced, it was an act of facial pregnancy discrimination; and under 702 -- 706(e)( 2), that intent to discriminate on the basis of pregnancy is--"
2008.07-543,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3118.527,3120.896,But it was not unlawful at the time it was done.
2008.07-543,2,33970,kevin_k_russell,,3120.896,3126.399,"--I do think it was unlawful, but it doesn't matter with respect to 706(e)( 2)."
2008.07-543,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3362.784,3372.389,Are you -- are you making a claim that they had the choice or that the claim wasn't ripe until they felt the impacts of it?
2008.07-543,2,33970,kevin_k_russell,,3372.389,3374.008,--I think they don't have a choice.
2008.07-543,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3431.893,3433.095,"Thank you, Mr. Russell."
