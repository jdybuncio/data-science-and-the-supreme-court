1992.91-261,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,14.871,"We'll hear argument first this morning in No. 91-261, Building and Construction Trades Council v. Associated Builders and Contractors of Massachusetts and Rhode Island, and et cetera."
1992.91-261,0,18942,charles_fried,,16.533,19.644,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1992.91-261,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,150.688,156.234,At that point I suppose the Authority was bound by the contract?
1992.91-261,0,18942,charles_fried,,156.234,161.568,The Authority was not a signatory to the contract.
1992.91-261,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,161.568,161.738,I know.
1992.91-261,0,18942,charles_fried,,166.954,169.508,"Well, a great point is made of that."
1992.91-261,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,235.223,235.684,"Well, why wouldn't it be bound?"
1992.91-261,0,18942,charles_fried,,249.355,269.468,"Well, perhaps it would have been bound, and if it would be bound it might be subject to suit under section 301 to enforce that contract, but that would not in any way affect its validity."
1992.91-261,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,325.666,336.643,"Well, does that turn, that decision turn on whether the Authority was acting as a proprietor or as a regulator?"
1992.91-261,0,18942,charles_fried,,336.643,339.276,In our view it ought to turn on it.
1992.91-261,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,428.346,435.832,Can the state be a regulator just by virtue of its use of its spending power?
1992.91-261,0,18942,charles_fried,,435.832,438.554,This Court so held in the Gould case.
1992.91-261,1,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,969.405,978.421,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1992.91-261,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1005.98,1013.746,"Are you going to by any chance, isn't there a presidential order that has some bearing on this case?"
1992.91-261,1,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,1013.746,1016.238,"Your Honor, it doesn't have any direct bearing."
1992.91-261,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1018.662,1020.462,Are you going to speak about it at all?
1992.91-261,1,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,1020.462,1020.692,I certainly can.
1992.91-261,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1045.868,1047.621,You don't think that has any bearing on this case?
1992.91-261,1,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,1047.621,1060.23,"--Well, the reason, Your Honor, that I don't think it does is that the point here is that Congress left it to the states to decide when they use their money, when they are the purchaser, how they want to order their labor relations on these projects."
1992.91-261,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1060.23,1063.661,This project doesn't have any Federal funds?
1992.91-261,1,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,1063.661,1066.944,It has Federal funds that would not be affected by the President's order--
1992.91-261,2,35525,maurice_baskin,,1563.224,1569.038,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1992.91-261,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1612.433,1615.044,"That's always allowed under 8(e) and 8(f), isn't it?"
1992.91-261,2,35525,maurice_baskin,,1615.044,1618.026,"--Only for private employers, a crucial difference."
1992.91-261,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1619.078,1619.929,That's the issue.
1992.91-261,2,35525,maurice_baskin,,1619.929,1621.321,"That is the issue, Your Honor."
1992.91-261,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1664.912,1666.612,Where will we find 8(d) in your brief?
1992.91-261,2,35525,maurice_baskin,,1666.612,1670.205,"--8(d) is cited, H.K. Porter is mentioned, the case in which this Court--"
1992.91-261,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1670.205,1673.768,I asked you where will I find 8(d) in your brief.
1992.91-261,2,35525,maurice_baskin,,1673.768,1679.272,--You will find it right next to the citation to H.K. Porter.
1992.91-261,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1687.529,1689.899,"Where will I find 8(d), the text?"
1992.91-261,2,35525,maurice_baskin,,1689.899,1692.473,I'm sorry if the text of 8(d) is omitted.
1992.91-261,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1693.995,1695.047,It is omitted?
1992.91-261,2,35525,maurice_baskin,,1695.047,1698.519,And if it's not referred to... actually it's cited.
1992.91-261,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1711.15,1714.763,I would think if you're going to rely on 8(d) you would have set it forth in your brief.
1992.91-261,2,35525,maurice_baskin,,1714.763,1727.102,"--Yes, Your Honor, and I would apologize for that omission except that the statute has been interpreted by this Court a number of times and by reference to H.K. Porter it was felt that it was set forth for the Court."
1992.91-261,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1815.791,1826.929,Are you arguing that the negotiation of the contract between Kaiser and the unions was also preempted since it was on behalf of the agency?
1992.91-261,2,35525,maurice_baskin,,1826.929,1830.051,"The effect of that negotiation, yes, we do."
1992.91-261,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1877.904,1880.396,You have never argued Garmon preemption?
1992.91-261,2,35525,maurice_baskin,,1880.396,1885.02,--We have raised both Garmon and Golden State Machinists type preemption.
1992.91-261,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1885.02,1886.011,So you're going both tracks?
1992.91-261,2,35525,maurice_baskin,,1886.011,1887.533,"We are going both tracks, Your Honor."
1992.91-261,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1910.15,1911.743,8(e) uses the term employer.
1992.91-261,2,35525,maurice_baskin,,1911.743,1912.004,--Yes.
1992.91-261,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1912.004,1913.766,It doesn't say private employer.
1992.91-261,2,35525,maurice_baskin,,1913.766,1921.252,"Employer is defined in section 2(2) of the act, which is referenced, and all sides admit that the MWRA is not an employer."
1992.91-261,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1923.396,1926.167,Not an employer as defined in 2(2)?
1992.91-261,2,35525,maurice_baskin,,1926.167,1926.427,Right.
1992.91-261,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1979.935,1992.704,"Well, I suppose the argument on the other side is that you also create an enormous hole in the ability of the Government to contract itself instead of letting things be done by the private sector."
1992.91-261,2,35525,maurice_baskin,,2009.243,2010.695,"There are two answers to that, Your Honor."
1992.91-261,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2140.487,2141.929,What is the stabilization agreement?
1992.91-261,2,35525,maurice_baskin,,2141.929,2147.273,"Oh, a stabilization agreement may be a discussion about certain terms that should apply--"
1992.91-261,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2147.273,2151.347,"Well, it's more than a discussion if it's an agreement, so what--"
1992.91-261,2,35525,maurice_baskin,,2151.347,2151.497,--Absolutely.
1992.91-261,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2153.279,2155.01,--Tell me what the agreement is.
1992.91-261,2,35525,maurice_baskin,,2155.01,2156.76,"--Well, in particular--"
1992.91-261,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2156.76,2158.092,Between whom and whom?
1992.91-261,2,35525,maurice_baskin,,2158.092,2165.756,--It typically is between the contracting agency and all the parties who are going to participate in the contract.
1992.91-261,3,18942,charles_fried,,3102.488,3105.372,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1992.91-261,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3128.978,3139.585,"But what's your answer, Mr. Fried, to his argument that 8(e) and 8(f) speak in terms of employer, but 2(2) defines an employer as to exclude the state?"
1992.91-261,3,18942,charles_fried,,3139.585,3150.6,"Well, 8(e) and 8(f) impose prohibitions and then lift those prohibitions in respect to the construction industry."
1992.91-261,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3191.469,3195.332,"Except he asserts that what has been done here violates not just (e) and (f), but (d)--"
1992.91-261,3,18942,charles_fried,,3195.332,3196.364,--Well--
1992.91-261,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3196.364,3200.525,"--which doesn't hinge, doesn't necessarily hinge upon the term employer, does it?"
1992.91-261,3,18942,charles_fried,,3200.525,3207.21,"--8(d) does, I will admit, rather surprise me, its entry into the case."
1992.91-261,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3250.292,3259.198,"I notice that the definition of employer excludes a labor organization, but then it says except when acting as an employer."
1992.91-261,3,18942,charles_fried,,3261.021,3267.774,"Well, I think that refers to the situation where a, where a labor organization--"
1992.91-261,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3267.774,3268.615,I'm trying to help you.
1992.91-261,3,18942,charles_fried,,3270.424,3271.415,--Thank you so much.
1992.91-261,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3288.527,3301.416,"Well, you say that the state here is just acting in its proprietary capacity."
1992.91-261,3,18942,charles_fried,,3301.416,3302.448,That's correct.
1992.91-261,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3302.448,3305.981,"And it's in effect hiring people, I suppose."
1992.91-261,3,18942,charles_fried,,3305.981,3307.921,"No, it, it's hiring Kaiser."
1992.91-261,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3307.921,3308.92,Yes.
1992.91-261,3,18942,charles_fried,,3308.92,3312.092,And it's hiring the contractors.
1992.91-261,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3317.617,3318.779,"Thank you, Mr. Fried."
