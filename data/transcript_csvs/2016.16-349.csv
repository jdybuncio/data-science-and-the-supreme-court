2016.16-349,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,8.455,"We'll hear argument next in Case 16-349, Henson v. Santander Consumer USA, Incorporated. Mr. Russell."
2016.16-349,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,8.455,14.825,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Fair Debt Collection Practices Act applies to debt collectors."
2016.16-349,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,223.81,225.57,I understand -- I understand that argument.
2016.16-349,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,247.975,249.38,I don't think it's that unusual.
2016.16-349,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,267.045,270.9,"""Owing"" is not a common word that's used in that context, though."
2016.16-349,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,270.9,271.63,But -- but exactly.
2016.16-349,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,382.68,398.72,"Mr. Russell, do you have a few examples -- I -- I suspect you've thought of this -- just of sentences which use the word ""owed"" to -- to mean what you want it to mean in this case, without any other context clues?"
2016.16-349,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,398.72,403.48,You can talk about somebody collecting a debt owed another.
2016.16-349,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,409.75,409.88,Right.
2016.16-349,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,431.48,434.75,"So, I mean, we've given a couple examples in our reply brief."
2016.16-349,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,457.56,467.6,"Well, usually, when we think about ambiguous phrases, you know, we can say, well, you could say this sentence and then it would mean X."
2016.16-349,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,477.05,477.15,Well --
2016.16-349,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,477.15,478.62,-- how I construct a sentence.
2016.16-349,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,478.62,488.395,"Well, I give you the example, if Congress had said a debt collector is somebody who regularly collects debts owed or owing another, I think that would be a perfectly grammatical sentence."
2016.16-349,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,566.44,573.605,"Is this -- is -- as the case comes to us, we're not addressing the status of Santander as a debt servicer, though."
2016.16-349,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,573.605,574.39,That's correct.
2016.16-349,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,637.97,643.145,And I don't see a problem with -- with (F)(iii)
2016.16-349,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,662.425,664.1,So there's -- there's two problems with that.
2016.16-349,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,694.005,708.845,"Why would they not be covered if they acquired the debt before it went into -- I'm sorry -- after it went into default? They would be collecting a debt owed -- owed or due to someone else. And they acquired the debt after it went into default; therefore, they don't fall into (iii)."
2016.16-349,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,708.845,714.41,"Well, in Respondent's view, somebody who is collecting on an assignment is collecting a debt that is owed themselves."
2016.16-349,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,718.32,719.43,Where -- where do they say that?
2016.16-349,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,719.43,720.61,"I mean, I've approached my limit."
2016.16-349,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,720.61,721.44,Yeah.
2016.16-349,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,847.89,863.25,"So let me address your difficulties, and then let me explain why, I think, the problems on the other side are greater than you seem to think that they are. The difficulties arising out of mergers or -- or buyouts of a company, I think, are -- are completely separate from the issues here."
2016.16-349,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,983.54,1005.25,"Why do you have to get into assignments at all? All -- all that's needed to defeat your argument with respect to (iii), is to think of a situation in which a person or an entity is collecting a debt owed to another, and that person or entity obtained the debt at a time when the debt was not defaulted."
2016.16-349,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,1018.865,1019.62,So --
2016.16-349,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1019.62,1023.645,"Your -- your answer is that's not a reasonable -- that's not the right definition of ""obtained."""
2016.16-349,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,1023.645,1024.005,So I --
2016.16-349,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1024.005,1025.58,"So that's what it comes down to, right?"
2016.16-349,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,1025.58,1027.25,I have a couple other responses.
2016.16-349,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1030.3,1032.39,"No, I'm talking -- I'll take them one at a time."
2016.16-349,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,1032.39,1032.515,Okay.
2016.16-349,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1114.55,1114.72,All right.
2016.16-349,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,1145.565,1151.27,"So if -- just to be clear with the hypothetical, the -- the debt hasn't been -- the security interest hasn't been foreclosed on?"
2016.16-349,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1151.27,1151.61,Yes.
2016.16-349,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,1151.855,1157.84,"So at that point, it's the borrowers, the car dealership, in my example, who is collecting the debt, not the secured party."
2016.16-349,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1221.26,1225.88,"Well, this situation -- I -- I mean, it's possible to think of situations that would fall within that."
2016.16-349,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,1269.15,1278.49,"Well, taking that -- that I'm unlikely to change your view about that, I think we have identified something pretty strong, because we now have a provision that renders itself surplusage."
2016.16-349,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1332.73,1341.55,"You don't dispute, I -- I take it, that this particular context, with this particular type of entity, is not what Congress had before it when it passed the law."
2016.16-349,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,1341.55,1342.51,I think that --
2016.16-349,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1342.51,1346.87,The industry has evolved in a way that has -- has raised these sorts of questions.
2016.16-349,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,1346.87,1347.07,I think --
2016.16-349,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1347.07,1349.8,This is not something that Congress was addressing.
2016.16-349,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,1349.8,1353.32,I think it probably -- I don't think it had this specific industry in mind.
2016.16-349,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1373.97,1380.445,"That's true about -- I take your -- I understand your point on assignees, I think. Now, look at (iv)"
2016.16-349,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,1444.085,1444.775,Sure.
2016.16-349,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1444.775,1449.97,"But now, so where did this come from that we're only talking about assignees? And it's important."
2016.16-349,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,1474.505,1506.88,"So let me turn you back to the language of the provision, because I think, ultimately, you don't need to know that much about commercial credit transactions to be persuaded of our point. The beginning of (F) makes clear that all the Clause (F) exceptions, including (F)(iv), only apply to any person collecting or attempting to collect a consumer debt, right? And so then you have to ask yourself, under what circumstances? And then (iv) only applies to the secured party, the bank, right? Concerns a debt obtained by such person as a secured party."
2016.16-349,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1527.44,1587.8,"Counsel, before you -- you sit down, you did make an alternative argument based on 1692a(6); that is, you say, whatever else your person here regularly collects or attempts to collect debts owed or due to another, that's part of its business. And then it also is -- purchases a debt. I think you're making the argument that if -- if they include the servicing that you described, part of their business is that they are regularly collecting or attempting to collect debts owed to another, then even as to transactions that don't fit that type, that they are -- well -- well, they are creditors themselves -- their whole business gets stamped with debt collection."
2016.16-349,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,1588.63,1592.475,"That's correct, because the main definition looks at the business model."
2016.16-349,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1609.47,1616.905,"But you didn't -- you didn't -- the court of appeals didn't agree with you, and you didn't raise that as a question."
2016.16-349,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,1616.905,1618.32,We did not raise that as a separate question.
2016.16-349,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1630.32,1632.7,Why -- why is it a predicate? I read that part of your brief.
2016.16-349,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,1638.77,1659.475,"I think it's -- it's an important part of our structural argument about why their interpretation of ""owed or due another"" is not -- cannot be correct, because they say the financial services industry is not what Congress had in mind here. And we make the point that, look, on a plain writing of the text, even under their interpretation of owed or due another, financial services providers are covered. If I could reserve the remainder of my time."
2016.16-349,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1659.475,1662.53,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Shanmugam."
2016.16-349,1,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1662.53,1687.7,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The sole question presented by this case is whether an entity that purchases debts and then attempts to collect them for its own account, qualifies as a debt collector under the FDCPA on the ground that it is regularly attempting to collect debts owed or due another. The answer to that question is plainly no, because such an entity is attempting to collect debts owed or due itself."
2016.16-349,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1688.245,1690.28,I -- I just want to understand this.
2016.16-349,1,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1723.655,1727.05,"No, we would not contend that, Justice Sotomayor."
2016.16-349,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1727.05,1739.465,"So if your client, if they had pled it right and proven that the principal part of your client's business was debt collection of debts owed to others, you would be covered."
2016.16-349,1,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1739.465,1771.23,"So Petitioners concede that we do not fall within the principal purpose definition. I would note parenthetically that the principal purpose definition applies to any entity, the principal purpose of whose business is the collection of any debts, regardless of to whom those debts are owed. I would also note parenthetically that, to the extent that Mr. Russell advances an alternative argument, this argument concerning Santander's alleged servicing activity, that that's also an argument under the provision at issue here; namely, the ""regularly collects"" provision."
2016.16-349,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1980.81,1996.07,"I think -- I might not have this right, but I think that they're replying to that is what happens in the situation that you mentioned is that the initial creditor who sold the car or whatever, and they're going to give as collateral that."
2016.16-349,1,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,2027.015,2027.81,So --
2016.16-349,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2027.81,2030.865,Am I right about what you think his reply is?
2016.16-349,1,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,2030.865,2033.46,"Well, I think that that is Mr. Russell's reply."
2016.16-349,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2404.795,2410.1,"Mr. Shanmugam, it doesn't make much sense, though, does it? I mean, take this very case."
2016.16-349,1,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,2439.125,2452.89,"So, Justice Kagan, we don't concede that simply by virtue of the fact that we serviced Petitioners' debt and certain other debts involved in this case that that was sufficient to render us an entity that regularly collects or attempts --"
2016.16-349,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2452.89,2454.58,Let's assume that for the -- for the purposes of the question.
2016.16-349,1,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,2454.58,2463.15,But -- but I'm happy to assume that for purposes of the question. The relevant inquiry is whether we were a debt collector at the time of the alleged violation.
2016.16-349,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2524.33,2534.08,"Well, why is -- why is that? I mean, you're -- you -- you were an entirely different business than -- than the person that -- in whose shoes you stepped."
2016.16-349,1,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,2541.51,2553.81,"Well, I do think that we would have incentives to maintain their goodwill in the way that the sort of fly-by-night debt collectors that Congress was seeking to target 40 years ago, when it enacted the FDCPA, didn't."
2016.16-349,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2598.12,2612.755,"You don't -- you don't think that the definition of ""creditor,"" in excluding only those who have bought debt that's not in default, tells -- gives you a sign of who they are concerned about?"
2016.16-349,1,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,2612.755,2627.88,So I think both sides now recognize that the question of whether or not respondent is a debt collector doesn't in any way depend on the question of whether or not respondent falls within the definition of creditor or not.
2016.16-349,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2789.98,2821.295,"So he left that argument. What about the argument that was not made part of the -- the question presented? The -- what is it? 1592(a)(6), the -- not -- not the principle place of business -- not the principle business, but what -- what was -- what was the language?"
2016.16-349,1,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,2821.295,2822.42,Yes.
2016.16-349,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2824.08,2835.88,"Regularly -- yeah. Regularly -- the argument, as I understand it, is that one who regularly collects or attempts to collect debts owed to another."
2016.16-349,1,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,2860.73,2872.565,"So, Justice Ginsburg, we acknowledge that the question of whether an entity falls within the ""regularly collects"" definition requires an inquiry into the entity's overall practices."
2016.16-349,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3066.06,3084.459,"But wouldn't we, assuming we agree with you, have to leave open that -- the question of the character of the business, the sixth definition."
2016.16-349,1,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,3094.795,3099.47,"Justice Ginsburg, I think that that is an issue that could be raised in another case."
2016.16-349,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3175.37,3200.915,"Court of appeals did address the issue, but it said even under this ""regularly collects,"" it would have to be a debt owed to -- what are the magic words? Well, first tell me, am I right that the alternative argument that was not raised here was raised --"
2016.16-349,1,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,3200.915,3205.15,I actually don't think that it was raised below or passed upon by the court of appeals.
2016.16-349,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3423.57,3426.63,Is Citi -- Citi out of business? It's no longer writing debts?
2016.16-349,1,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,3426.63,3453.02,"My understanding is that Citi in very much still in business, but it's not in the auto lending business, and that Santander, in two separate transactions, acquired somewhere in the neighborhood of $6.5 billion worth of auto loans. Citi, like many other large lenders, essentially got out of the auto lending business in the wake of the last financial crisis, and Santander acquired this entire portfolio."
2016.16-349,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3475.065,3478.349,"Thank you, counsel. Two minutes, Mr. Russell."
2016.16-349,2,33970,kevin_k_russell,,3478.349,3480.22,Thank you.
2016.16-349,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3634.105,3634.53,Sure.
2016.16-349,2,33970,kevin_k_russell,,3634.53,3650.685,"All they have to do is change their contract with their customer to arrange for the -- a purchasing of the debt that they've been hired to collect and arrange to give back 60 percent of what they collect by virtue of that assignment, and they would evade regulation as well."
2016.16-349,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3650.685,0.0,"Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted."
