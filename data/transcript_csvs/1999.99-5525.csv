1999.99-5525,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.934,"We'll hear argument now in Number 99-5525, Charles Thomas Dickerson v. The United States."
1999.99-5525,0,31063,james_w_hundley,,11.199,14.027,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1999.99-5525,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,63.865,67.583,"Mr. Hundley, are those requirements substantive requirements?"
1999.99-5525,0,31063,james_w_hundley,,72.69,76.095,"Yes, Justice Scalia."
1999.99-5525,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,90.121,112.158,"I presume that if a policeman should beat someone with a rubber hose and extract a confession, and then introduce that confession in a criminal prosecution, that the policeman would be subject to a civil action not only for assault, but also for a violation of the constitutional right, or Fifth Amendment right."
1999.99-5525,0,31063,james_w_hundley,,112.158,113.846,Yes.
1999.99-5525,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,113.846,127.716,"Now, do you think that a policeman who fails to Mirandize the suspect, obtains a confession without having Mirandized them and then introduces that confession in court, is subject to suit?"
1999.99-5525,0,31063,james_w_hundley,,130.293,136.102,"I am unaware of any... well, Justice Scalia, let me take that back."
1999.99-5525,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,150.05,165.184,"I'd be very surprised if that is prosecutable civilly, which makes me think that the right we're talking about here is a procedural, is a procedural guarantee that the court instituted, rather than a substantive one."
1999.99-5525,0,31063,james_w_hundley,,165.184,165.903,Yes.
1999.99-5525,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,172.339,178.696,"In the criminal process, an exclusionary rule, in effect, that we won't let in these confessions."
1999.99-5525,0,31063,james_w_hundley,,178.696,179.259,--Well--
1999.99-5525,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,179.259,190.41,"Regardless of whether they've been technically extracted in violation of the Constitution, as a matter of criminal procedure, we won't admit them, nor will the States."
1999.99-5525,0,31063,james_w_hundley,,190.41,206.419,"--I would respond, Your Honor, that they cannot be submitted because they were obtained without the requisite protections that the Constitution demands to ensure their voluntariness, to dispel the inherent compulsion--"
1999.99-5525,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,206.419,213.853,"So then your answer is, is that the warnings specified in Miranda are constitutional requirements, and I thought you'd said--"
1999.99-5525,0,31063,james_w_hundley,,213.853,214.556,--The--
1999.99-5525,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,214.556,218.415,--something somewhat different at the very outset.
1999.99-5525,0,31063,james_w_hundley,,218.415,225.476,"--I did, and it's a subtle distinction, Justice Kennedy, and it's a distinction I think which has perhaps led to some confusion in the literature."
1999.99-5525,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,250.09,254.041,"Well, how is 3501 deficient under that analysis?"
1999.99-5525,0,31063,james_w_hundley,,254.041,278.751,"Because 3501, rather than requiring affirmative objective procedures which provide notice to the defendant and provide protections for the suspect, simply reverts the analysis back to the totality-of-circumstances test, which courts in this country wrestled with for many decades until Miranda explicitly rejected it as unworkable and inconsistent."
1999.99-5525,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,278.751,296.336,"Mr. Hundley, as I understand it, Miranda made a switch from the totality-of-the-circumstances that related to due process, don't give people the third degree, to something quite different, and I'm not sure you're explicit about it."
1999.99-5525,0,31063,james_w_hundley,,310.238,310.738,Yes.
1999.99-5525,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,310.738,325.592,"Not a right to be free from third degree procedures, but a right to notice, and opportunity to exercise your right to silence, and that that was an interpretation of what the self-incrimination privilege required, is that correct?"
1999.99-5525,0,31063,james_w_hundley,,325.592,327.78,"Yes, Justice Ginsburg."
1999.99-5525,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,354.159,356.142,"Well, Mr. Hundley, you say shifted."
1999.99-5525,0,31063,james_w_hundley,,365.811,366.78,Yes.
1999.99-5525,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,366.78,375.308,That a confession that is not voluntarily extracted is nonetheless a... is a violation of the Constitution.
1999.99-5525,0,31063,james_w_hundley,,375.308,377.433,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, that is correct."
1999.99-5525,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,402.624,405.483,"Well, you say it provides clear-cut evidence."
1999.99-5525,0,31063,james_w_hundley,,418.619,423.836,"I would respectfully disagree, Mr. Chief Justice."
1999.99-5525,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,452.198,464.647,"Mr. Hundley, when you say it replaced the totality-of-the-circumstances analysis, it replaced that, the totality-of-the-circumstances analysis was not a criterion of police conduct."
1999.99-5525,0,31063,james_w_hundley,,494.978,495.978,Yes.
1999.99-5525,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,496.977,498.274,"Well, is that right?"
1999.99-5525,0,31063,james_w_hundley,,503.037,503.537,"--Oh, no."
1999.99-5525,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,507.537,509.957,Miranda itself was from a State court.
1999.99-5525,0,31063,james_w_hundley,,509.957,515.515,"--Yes, it was, as were numerous other decisions of this Court interpreting and tailoring the decision, and the fact--"
1999.99-5525,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,515.515,521.639,Are you suggesting that we can't apply any procedural requirements upon State courts?
1999.99-5525,0,31063,james_w_hundley,,530.121,535.369,--Only those procedures which themselves are demanded by the Constitution.
1999.99-5525,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,535.369,537.649,Why is that?
1999.99-5525,0,31063,james_w_hundley,,560.576,592.813,"Well, Justice Scalia, in that example, that would be an exercise of the Court's Federal statutory jurisdiction, but in cases such as Miranda, unless the Court is interpreting and applying the Constitution, its procedures would not be applicable to the States unless the Court were to embrace the theory put forth by a court-appointed amicus that there is some form of constitutional common law, which this Court to my knowledge has never recognized, and--"
1999.99-5525,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,592.813,597.202,It seems to me you're swallowing the camel and straining out the gnat.
1999.99-5525,0,31063,james_w_hundley,,617.945,622.177,"--Justice Scalia, I would disagree."
1999.99-5525,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,641.983,681.264,"Mr. Hundley, I think you are getting away now from what I thought you had established clearly before, that what we're talking about now is something that's discrete from and in addition to voluntariness, that is, notice and opportunity to exercise your right of silence, and I don't think those two should be blended together, because what made Miranda different was not that it did away with the voluntariness law, but that it recognized a discrete right, a procedural right, if you will, but a constitutional right to notice and opportunity of your right to silence."
1999.99-5525,0,31063,james_w_hundley,,681.264,683.044,"Yes, I agree, Justice--"
1999.99-5525,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,683.044,686.277,"If that's the basis for Miranda, why don't we have the same rule for consent?"
1999.99-5525,0,31063,james_w_hundley,,693.322,694.166,"--No, Justice--"
1999.99-5525,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,694.166,695.352,--requisite for Miranda?
1999.99-5525,0,31063,james_w_hundley,,695.352,696.383,"--Excuse me, Justice Kennedy."
1999.99-5525,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,714.83,717.702,The right to privacy and personal protection against seizure is not fundamental?
1999.99-5525,0,31063,james_w_hundley,,717.702,733.415,"--Not in the context of maintaining a fair criminal trial, because the evidence found in a Fourth Amendment violation, while there may be a violation of constitutional rights, is probative to guilt or innocence."
1999.99-5525,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,762.294,763.685,"Very well, Mr. Hundley."
1999.99-5525,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,766.263,775.057,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1999.99-5525,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,789.816,800.499,"Well, in our past Miranda cases I think the Government has taken the position that Miranda warnings are not constitutionally required."
1999.99-5525,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,800.499,828.971,"--That is correct, Justice O'Connor, and in that regard, and I must... I will say at the outset with regard to all of the, whether it's 30 or 50 Miranda decisions this case has decided, the Court is leading, and we are respectfully following, but the Court explained in Miranda that the warnings themselves were not constitutionally required, and it repeatedly invited legislatures, including the national legislature, to enact constitutionally adequate safeguards."
1999.99-5525,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,855.617,858.74,What's the source of that authority for the Court--
1999.99-5525,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,858.74,859.506,--The--
1999.99-5525,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,859.506,864.239,--and how do you equate it with other exercises of such a right?
1999.99-5525,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,864.239,864.973,--The--
1999.99-5525,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,864.973,870.579,"If it isn't a Fifth Amendment right itself, what is it, and how do we have the power to--"
1999.99-5525,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,870.579,888.276,"--Justice O'Connor, the Court itself has repeatedly said that Miranda's requirements are based on its power to interpret and apply the Constitution, and that the doctrine, the Court has said, is necessary."
1999.99-5525,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,920.685,927.901,"--I really want you to get to your other two points, but what you're talking about just now is something I don't understand."
1999.99-5525,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,933.725,934.209,Yes.
1999.99-5525,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,934.647,934.835,My--
1999.99-5525,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,934.835,935.069,--This--
1999.99-5525,2,37783,paul_g_cassell,,1676.152,1679.12,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1999.99-5525,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1749.905,1763.118,"Well, Mr. Cassell, I think you can point to other cases, too, including one which I authored, Michigan v. Tucker, that refers to it as a prophylactic rule, but here we're kind of faced with a conundrum."
1999.99-5525,2,37783,paul_g_cassell,,1774.941,1778.048,"Well, we think it certainly relates to the Constitution."
1999.99-5525,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1778.048,1782.937,"But I mean, what does relates... does that mean something different than arises out of, or stems from?"
1999.99-5525,2,37783,paul_g_cassell,,1782.937,1788.419,"Well, it stems from... the point... the way that we would describe the Miranda procedures is this."
1999.99-5525,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1796.526,1806.428,"Well, is it like the Anders requirements, for example, where we imposed on States and others certain requirements on appellate review?"
1999.99-5525,2,37783,paul_g_cassell,,1806.428,1807.006,--Yes.
1999.99-5525,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1819.814,1823.594,By an adequate alternative procedure.
1999.99-5525,2,37783,paul_g_cassell,,1823.594,1824.454,--That's right.
1999.99-5525,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1824.454,1837.556,"So in your view does this case boil down, as I take it the Solicitor General also expresses, the notion that we have to determine whether section 3501 is an adequate alternative?"
1999.99-5525,2,37783,paul_g_cassell,,1837.556,1840.93,"Well, like the Solicitor General, we have three arguments as well."
1999.99-5525,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1861.532,1879.4,"Mr. Cassell, before you proceed with that, may I ask what you do... we are dealing with... Miranda is the bedrock decision, and the Court repeatedly said, unless we are shown other procedures which are at least as effective, effective to do what?"
1999.99-5525,2,37783,paul_g_cassell,,1909.762,1913.947,"You've certainly accurately quoted the opinion, Justice Ginsburg."
1999.99-5525,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1921.882,1959.226,"I thought Miranda said the police station, station house, is a Fifth Amendment venue in the same way a court is, in the same way a legislative committee that's inquiring into something that may lead to a criminal indictment, and in those settings... take the court, whether it's the first appearance before a magistrate, whether it's a guilty plea, that's written right into the rules of what the court must advise the defendant, the right to remain silent, that statements can be used against him, the right to counsel."
1999.99-5525,2,37783,paul_g_cassell,,1975.408,1980.889,"--When we talk about court procedures, we're talking about a different stage in the criminal justice process."
1999.99-5525,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1988.245,1995.118,"I don't... the initial presentation before a magistrate, there's no trial yet."
1999.99-5525,2,37783,paul_g_cassell,,2004.099,2012.191,"--There are certainly varying procedures around the country, and that is one of the approaches that's taken, but again, that is the point at which the Sixth Amendment rights attach."
1999.99-5525,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2019.001,2039.085,"But I thought what Miranda's whole point was, that we're going to treat the station house as that kind of forum, or perhaps you can tell me, because I really don't know, what is done by a legislative investigating committtee when they are investigating something that could lead to the criminal prosecution of certain witnesses."
1999.99-5525,2,37783,paul_g_cassell,,2044.115,2049.643,"--I've testified before Congress and I... on Miranda, and I actually did not get my rights to remain silent--"
1999.99-5525,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2051.284,2052.174,I don't think--
1999.99-5525,2,37783,paul_g_cassell,,2052.174,2053.533,So my personal experience is no.
1999.99-5525,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2053.533,2058.828,--I doubt that you were in any jeopardy at all of a criminal prosecution.
1999.99-5525,2,37783,paul_g_cassell,,2058.828,2063.373,"Actually, there was a death penalty hearing where I was sworn to tell the truth, but there were no warnings given to me at that time."
1999.99-5525,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2082.21,2093.377,"Because there, wasn't it the parole officer had a relationship, kind of a caring, fatherly relationship with the... as distinguished from the police encounter?"
1999.99-5525,2,37783,paul_g_cassell,,2093.377,2108.715,"--I don't think... the parole officer in that case was asking Mr. Murphy whether he had committed a homicide, so I don't think it was a caring sort of relationship there and, indeed, those statements were used against Mr. Murphy later in a prosecution... for--"
1999.99-5525,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2108.715,2114.26,"Well, I think you... the parole officer is supposed to be there to help rehabilitate the person."
1999.99-5525,2,37783,paul_g_cassell,,2123.13,2135.454,"--We're not saying that they're exactly the same, but we are saying that this Court said, and I believe this is a paraphrase of the Court's holding in Murphy, that the general Fifth Amendment rule is that warnings and waivers are not required."
1999.99-5525,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2135.454,2166.535,"Mr. Cassell, could I go back to what I think was the kernel of Justice Ginsburg's original question, and that was, she stated an understanding of Miranda which is my understanding, too, and that was that the experience with a system based purely on inquiries into voluntariness had been sufficiently unsatisfactory that the Court said in Miranda, we are going to go to a somewhat different system which we think will produce better results."
1999.99-5525,2,37783,paul_g_cassell,,2239.349,2243.91,"Well, I think the point that we would emphasize, Justice Souter, is this."
1999.99-5525,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2260.045,2262.059,Voluntariness system alone.
1999.99-5525,2,37783,paul_g_cassell,,2262.059,2262.794,That's right.
1999.99-5525,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2262.794,2269.337,"That's right, and the statute goes back to, I guess, a voluntariness system alone."
1999.99-5525,2,37783,paul_g_cassell,,2269.337,2272.132,That's not the way... that's our second argument.
1999.99-5525,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2273.632,2275.288,I've given you a golden opportunity.
1999.99-5525,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2275.288,2282.582,"I thought your first point was, even if it did, it contradicts nothing but dicta in Miranda and not the holding of Miranda."
1999.99-5525,2,37783,paul_g_cassell,,2282.582,2283.801,Absolutely correct.
1999.99-5525,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2283.801,2288.127,But that's exactly the point which I think Justice Ginsburg and Justice Souter were getting at.
1999.99-5525,2,37783,paul_g_cassell,,2327.033,2328.58,Thirty-four years.
1999.99-5525,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2328.58,2347.979,"And at the end of that, and this is what I want you to focus on, the Court is asked, why don't you let the States or rule-making... other rule-making bodies figure out how to enforce the Fifth Amendment, and these are the words ending the opinion, not some obscure phrase buried in dicta:"
1999.99-5525,2,37783,paul_g_cassell,,2384.262,2387.838,"Well, there are a number of responses, Justice Breyer."
1999.99-5525,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2409.423,2411.297,But they do not require it.
1999.99-5525,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2421.855,2424.214,"Is that your argument, though?"
1999.99-5525,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2427.307,2429.463,One at a time.
1999.99-5525,2,37783,paul_g_cassell,,2429.463,2434.945,"If I could answer Justice Souter's questions... question first, and then, Justice Breyer, I would be glad to answer your question as well."
1999.99-5525,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2446.002,2449.173,Incentive is not required.
1999.99-5525,2,37783,paul_g_cassell,,2449.173,2450.548,--There is certainly a difference.
1999.99-5525,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2450.548,2451.218,You bet.
1999.99-5525,2,37783,paul_g_cassell,,2451.218,2459.31,But the fact of the matter is that General Waxman has represented to this Court that Federal agencies will continue to deliver Miranda warnings should--
1999.99-5525,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2459.31,2460.279,"No, but could I ask just one question."
1999.99-5525,2,37783,paul_g_cassell,,2477.928,2480.816,--We think that it provides a substitute adequate--
1999.99-5525,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2480.816,2482.238,That is equally adequate to the Miranda warnings?
1999.99-5525,2,37783,paul_g_cassell,,2482.238,2483.081,--That is adequate.
1999.99-5525,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2489.86,2499.654,"Well, let me ask you, Mr. Cassell, with respect to the quotation Justice Breyer read you, were there any rule-making proceedings before the Court in Miranda?"
1999.99-5525,2,37783,paul_g_cassell,,2499.654,2500.793,Absolutely.
1999.99-5525,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2500.793,2501.278,"So that's dicta, too."
1999.99-5525,2,37783,paul_g_cassell,,2501.278,2518.88,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, and in fact one of the sentences that has been quoted here begins in a... or is in the paragraph that begins with the statement, it is impossible for us to foresee the potential alternatives that might be devised by Congress and the States, so--"
1999.99-5525,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2518.88,2523.409,"Could you then... one quick... would you state the holding in Miranda, in your own view?"
1999.99-5525,2,37783,paul_g_cassell,,2523.409,2523.909,--Yes.
1999.99-5525,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2546.885,2552.195,"Oh, I will assume that that is going to be so in most cases."
1999.99-5525,2,37783,paul_g_cassell,,2632.007,2634.991,"I believe you are, with all respect, Justice Souter."
1999.99-5525,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2649.656,2662.838,"Well, not... I don't know that it goes so far as to say that it is automatically coercive in the sense that you would automatically draw the conclusion that coercion was involved, but that there was invariably a coercive effect."
1999.99-5525,2,37783,paul_g_cassell,,2664.868,2680.565,"--And in cases such as Elstad, New York v. Quarles, the Chief Justice has mentioned his opinion in Michigan v. Tucker, the Court has clarified whatever ambiguity may reside in some of the passions... passages of Miranda, that there is no constitutional violation."
1999.99-5525,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2681.518,2714.629,"There is no constitutional violation in the sense that there is no passage in the Constitution that says, you have to give these warnings, but those cases, it seems to me, have not overruled or jettisoned the proposition that, in order to get to a constitutionally mandated result with sufficient assurance that the Constitution is being served, we are going to require, as a matter of practical necessity, the giving of these warnings."
1999.99-5525,2,37783,paul_g_cassell,,2714.629,2715.192,--Well--
1999.99-5525,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2715.192,2729.483,"And just number two, we are there... for that reason we are going to go to a waiver-based, knowing waiver-based system, and I don't think those cases have jettisoned those propositions."
1999.99-5525,2,37783,paul_g_cassell,,2729.483,2737.185,"--Well, I would urge the Court to read carefully, then, the opinion in New York v. Quarles, which we think takes a different view."
1999.99-5525,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2752.88,2767.624,"Mr. Cassell, do you see the Miranda holding, or ruling, or whatever you want to call it, as differently based than the exclusionary rule under Mapp v. Ohio?"
1999.99-5525,2,37783,paul_g_cassell,,2767.624,2769.139,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice."
1999.99-5525,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2769.139,2770.576,What is that difference?
1999.99-5525,2,37783,paul_g_cassell,,2770.576,2776.341,The exclusionary rule applies when there has been an actual constitutional violation of the defendant's rights.
1999.99-5525,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2813.513,2814.31,Mr. Cassell--
1999.99-5525,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2814.31,2830.536,"--Mr. Cassell, the point was made earlier that under 3501 you suggested there would be an incentive for the police to continue to give the Miranda warnings, and the point was made that, however, they would not be required."
1999.99-5525,2,37783,paul_g_cassell,,2835.69,2836.502,The--
1999.99-5525,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2836.502,2839.548,"The confession will be excluded, so it's really just the same thing."
1999.99-5525,2,37783,paul_g_cassell,,2841.235,2842.032,--The--
1999.99-5525,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2842.032,2848.748,Unless you think that you can have a cause of action against the policeman who fails to give... what is your view of that?
1999.99-5525,2,37783,paul_g_cassell,,2848.748,2874.113,"--I believe nine courts of appeals around the country have ruled on that question and there's an ambiguous opinion from the Ninth Circuit, but every other court of appeals that has addressed precisely the hypothetical you have given has concluded that there is no Bivens action, for example, or 1983 action in a State setting because to violate the Miranda procedures is in no way a violation of the Constitution."
1999.99-5525,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2874.113,2879.782,But you accept the proposition that they are required if you want to get the statement in in the case in chief?
1999.99-5525,2,37783,paul_g_cassell,,2879.782,2882.437,"Not as a matter of constitutional law, and that is the--"
1999.99-5525,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2882.437,2888.295,They are required under Miranda if you want to get the statement in as part of your case in chief?
1999.99-5525,2,37783,paul_g_cassell,,2888.295,2890.311,--That is part of the Miranda procedures that this Court announced--
1999.99-5525,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2890.311,2892.231,"Well, that's the holding of Miranda, isn't it?"
1999.99-5525,2,37783,paul_g_cassell,,2892.231,2900.947,"--That's the, as we view it, the provisional, interim judgment that this Court announced, and then invited Congress and the States to consider other approaches."
1999.99-5525,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2904.868,2920.362,"Yes, but absent the conclusion from this Court that another approach provides the equivalence, the Miranda warning and the knowing waiver is a necessity if the statement is to be admitted as part of the State's case in chief to prove guilt."
1999.99-5525,2,37783,paul_g_cassell,,2922.172,2927.672,--We accept the proposition that the alternative has to be adequate to safeguard constitutional rights.
1999.99-5525,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2928.967,2929.733,But that's not my question.
1999.99-5525,2,37783,paul_g_cassell,,2930.857,2931.403,--I'm sorry.
1999.99-5525,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2931.403,2946.476,"--assumed that, in the absence of something that was found to be equivalent, the warnings and the knowing waiver are necessities for admissibility if the statement is to be used in the case in chief to prove guilt, and you... I... you do accept that proposition, don't you?"
1999.99-5525,2,37783,paul_g_cassell,,2946.476,2949.053,"Well, I think I would phrase it slightly differently, Justice Souter."
1999.99-5525,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2973.808,2974.043,Well--
1999.99-5525,2,37783,paul_g_cassell,,2974.043,2975.761,--up to every feature of Miranda.
1999.99-5525,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2975.761,2976.198,--I understand your point.
1999.99-5525,2,37783,paul_g_cassell,,2979.54,2982.836,"No, I'm sorry, Justice Souter, I very much want to answer the question."
1999.99-5525,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2982.836,2985.663,--My question is just simply an understanding of what Miranda held--
1999.99-5525,2,37783,paul_g_cassell,,2985.663,2986.773,Our--
1999.99-5525,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2986.773,3007.562,"--and it goes to the question of what is the necessity, and my point is that Miranda held, as I understand it, that in the absence of a conclusion that there was an... a constitutionally equivalent procedure, the warnings and finding of knowing waiver are in fact necessities for the admission of the statement to prove guilt."
1999.99-5525,2,37783,paul_g_cassell,,3008.326,3008.701,--We would--
1999.99-5525,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3008.701,3011.03,"--You do accept that, that that's what Miranda held, don't you?"
1999.99-5525,2,37783,paul_g_cassell,,3011.03,3012.731,--I would phrase it slightly differently.
1999.99-5525,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3024.039,3025.32,What is your formulation?
1999.99-5525,2,37783,paul_g_cassell,,3025.32,3026.412,--My formulation is this.
1999.99-5525,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3035.425,3039.892,"May I just interrupt you, because I do want to clarify just exactly what your position is."
1999.99-5525,2,37783,paul_g_cassell,,3049.169,3052.433,"Again, I would phrase it slightly differently, Justice Stevens."
1999.99-5525,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3054.854,3055.37,Correct.
1999.99-5525,2,37783,paul_g_cassell,,3055.37,3059.322,They don't have to match up to every single jot and jiggle in the Miranda warning.
1999.99-5525,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3059.322,3060.4,Absolutely right.
1999.99-5525,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3060.4,3061.353,"Well, Miranda said they did."
1999.99-5525,2,37783,paul_g_cassell,,3064.008,3075.301,There is a sentence in Miranda which we believe has been clarified in cases like New York v. Quarles to make it clear that there is no constitutional imperative requiring the exclusion of unwarned statements.
1999.99-5525,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3075.301,3079.706,"Let me just finish up, because I'm really... I'm trying to understand your position as accurately as I can."
1999.99-5525,2,37783,paul_g_cassell,,3094.324,3098.713,It was not intended to overrule Miranda to get to your second question directly.
1999.99-5525,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3098.916,3104.587,"You don't think so, that Senator McClellan and Senator Ervin at that time had that in mind at all?"
1999.99-5525,2,37783,paul_g_cassell,,3104.587,3111.771,"--Well, I certainly... I don't know if this Court has ever seen posturing taking place in the course of a criminal justice legislation."
1999.99-5525,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3117.534,3129.092,"I don't think there's anything in that legislative history that suggests they thought they were providing a substitute for the guarantees that Miranda provided, that rather, they... it seems to me they said they wanted to go back to the old voluntariness test."
1999.99-5525,2,37783,paul_g_cassell,,3129.092,3130.967,"--No, Justice Stevens."
1999.99-5525,3,31063,james_w_hundley,,3473.36,3475.625,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1999.99-5525,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3535.585,3535.867,"In fact, it doesn't--"
1999.99-5525,3,31063,james_w_hundley,,3535.867,3536.273,It clearly does not.
1999.99-5525,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3536.273,3540.177,--It doesn't call for the inadmissibility of an involuntary confession.
1999.99-5525,3,31063,james_w_hundley,,3546.582,3547.393,That's correct.
1999.99-5525,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3549.284,3555.36,"I assume the Constitution... you don't need a statute to exclude an involuntary confession, do you?"
1999.99-5525,3,31063,james_w_hundley,,3557.608,3566.823,"--But this Court in Miranda clearly defined that the Fifth Amendment needed additional protections to be fully effective, to be more than a formal--"
1999.99-5525,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3566.823,3570.619,Not in order to exclude from court a confession that is known to be involuntary.
1999.99-5525,3,31063,james_w_hundley,,3573.429,3575.585,--That's correct.
1999.99-5525,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3575.585,3579.585,"Thank you, Mr. Hundley. The case is submitted."
