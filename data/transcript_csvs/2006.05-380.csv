2006.05-380,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,8.67,"We'll hear argument first this morning in case 05-380, Gonzales vs. Carhart."
2006.05-380,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,9.789,12.724,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
2006.05-380,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,66.208,83.154,"General Clement, couldn't a similar record be made with respect to what is the more common procedure, the D&E, that involves dismemberment of a fetus inside the womb."
2006.05-380,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,102.032,118.058,"I don't think so, Justice Ginsburg, and I think that this Court's precedence, in particular the Danforth case, would stand as an obstacle to that piece of legislation, because in Danforth, this Court struck down an effort to ban what was then the majority method of inducing a second term abortion."
2006.05-380,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,144.025,161.154,"Even though we are told by some of the medical briefs that the procedure is basically the same, they start out in the same way and that the difference... the differences are not large in particular cases."
2006.05-380,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,161.154,164.605,"--Well, Justice Ginsburg, let me make a couple of points in response to that."
2006.05-380,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,290.703,296.69,"Well, didn't those doctors testified in the congressional hearings or in the Eighth Circuit or Ninth Circuit or the Second Circuit?"
2006.05-380,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,308.998,314.652,"They did, Justice Kennedy, and in particular, Dr. Creinin is an expert."
2006.05-380,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,331.98,340.969,"Just from my going through this record, I compare it with Stenberg, with what's in Congress."
2006.05-380,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,395.437,398.972,"Well, Justice Breyer, I think you certainly owe deference to both."
2006.05-380,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,399.372,426.575,"Well, if we owe deference to both, and I would have thought that we did, then I think in the Nebraska case, despite the deference that was owed, the Court came to the conclusion that the statute of Nebraska was unconstitutional because it lacked an exception for the health of the mother, something that came from preceding cases."
2006.05-380,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,443.6,450.504,"--Well, Justice Breyer, I mean, obviously I'm at a certain deficit to you in discussing what this Court held in the Stenberg opinion, which you wrote."
2006.05-380,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,510.808,515.794,"General Clement, are not some of the findings by Congress clearly erroneous?"
2006.05-380,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,524.068,529.37,"--Well, I mean, specifically what Congress found in that finding was that none of them provided it as part of a curriculum."
2006.05-380,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,537.891,539.743,Do you think that finding is correct?
2006.05-380,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,539.743,543.029,"--I don't know if it's correct, based on the curriculum."
2006.05-380,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,543.029,558.822,"Supposing there was a lot of evidence introduced in the district court that there were schools like Yale and New York University that did include this as part of a curriculum, could the district court disregard that finding and make a contrary finding?"
2006.05-380,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,558.822,568.428,"I think if the evidence in the district court were overwhelmingly to the contrary, I think that the district court could effectively undermine that one finding."
2006.05-380,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,570.713,577.384,"Well, on other findings, is there a different standard of review of what the district court found as opposed to what Congress found?"
2006.05-380,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,577.384,579.985,"--Well, Justice Stevens, I would answer you this way."
2006.05-380,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,615.556,615.723,"Well, I don't understand--"
2006.05-380,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,647.46,657.316,"Sure, Justice Stevens, I think I need to clarify an important point there, which is to say, the statute didn't focus on viable versus nonviable, because it applies to both sides of the viability line."
2006.05-380,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,657.316,658.832,I'm talking about the findings.
2006.05-380,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,666.088,688.518,"I don't think there is, Justice Stevens, but I wouldn't find that at all remarkable in a statute that applies and bans certain procedures without regard to whether the procedure is applied to a viable or nonviable fetus and when Congress does make specific findings that the procedure it's banning would have the effect of preventing a lethal act on a fetus just inches from being born."
2006.05-380,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,688.934,690.6,May I interrupt?
2006.05-380,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,690.6,691.034,--Sure.
2006.05-380,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,691.034,700.825,"It's not preventing, It's requiring that the lethal act be performed prior to any part of the delivery, because there is no doubt there will be a lethal act."
2006.05-380,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,704.777,706.36,The issue is whether--
2006.05-380,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,706.36,706.646,Yes.
2006.05-380,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,706.646,707.146,--Yes.
2006.05-380,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,715.483,716.585,Whether the fetus is more than halfway out.
2006.05-380,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,716.585,717.302,I'm sorry?
2006.05-380,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,717.302,724.339,"Whether the fetus is more than halfway out, and some of these fetuses I understand in the procedure, are only four or five inches long."
2006.05-380,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,728.207,730.493,"--Justice Stevens, again, you're right."
2006.05-380,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,730.493,734.278,"When it's halfway out, I guess you can call it either a child or a fetus."
2006.05-380,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,735.811,738.58,"I think you could use either terminology, Justice Scalia."
2006.05-380,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,763.545,768.182,Wouldn't the fetus be... I think it suffer a demise in seconds anyway.
2006.05-380,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,768.182,772.384,"--Well it may be seconds, it may be hours; it depends on... because even a pre--"
2006.05-380,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,772.384,777.954,"Do you not agree that it has no chance of surviving, in most cases?"
2006.05-380,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,777.954,782.239,--If we are talking about previability then by definition chances are it won't survive.
2006.05-380,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,782.239,782.858,"Yes, that's right."
2006.05-380,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,782.858,787.31,"But again, I don't think that, you know, that anything in this act--"
2006.05-380,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,787.31,794.916,Congress has made the judgment that it is far preferable to ensure that fetal demise takes place before any delivery begins.
2006.05-380,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,796.449,800.571,"--Well, I'm not sure if it's whether, that's a fair, that's a fair summary."
2006.05-380,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,819.466,831.459,"Would it, would it be lawful or would it be infanticide to deliver the fetus entirely and just let it expire without any attempt to keep it alive?"
2006.05-380,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,831.459,837.613,"Well, in the post viability context it would clearly be, it would clearly be infanticide."
2006.05-380,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,847.652,848.185,Mr.--
2006.05-380,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,848.185,861.395,"--But I do think by contrast if somebody tried to, with the fetus, you know, perfectly alive and in the hours that it might have to live, if somebody came in and ripped its head open, I think we'd call that murder, and in fact Congress passed another statute--"
2006.05-380,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,861.395,875.821,"--General Clement, that's not what this case is about, because I think you have recognized, quite appropriately, that we're not talking about whether any fetus will be preserved by this legislation."
2006.05-380,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,903.305,911.66,"--Justice Ginsberg, that's right, but I don't think that's to trivialize Congress's interest in maintaining a bright line between abortion and infanticide."
2006.05-380,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,966.078,972.715,But if this case were limited to post viability abortions it would be a different matter.
2006.05-380,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,981.154,994.397,"--I think that's probably right, Justice Ginsburg, but I think the point I would make is that Congress has an interest in maintaining the spatial line between infanticide and abortion, even with respect to previability fetuses and that's true for at least two reasons."
2006.05-380,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,994.397,999.199,If... I see what you're driving at in terms of the procedure.
2006.05-380,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1005.186,1005.753,Right.
2006.05-380,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1005.753,1006.538,Okay.
2006.05-380,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1010.94,1014.292,"Well, with the caveat that the statute does apply both--"
2006.05-380,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1014.292,1015.41,And that's the area of focus.
2006.05-380,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1015.41,1015.727,--Right.
2006.05-380,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1015.727,1030.05,"Now, Congress has said the doctor, you can achieve that result through method A, but not through method B, and you're saying Congress had good reason for doing that."
2006.05-380,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1048.079,1050.381,"Oh, I think that's right, Justice Breyer."
2006.05-380,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1051.25,1051.683,All right.
2006.05-380,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1052.3,1054.216,--took this Court's Stenberg's decision as a given--
2006.05-380,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1054.216,1054.45,--Right.
2006.05-380,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1138.253,1142.871,"--With respect, Justice Breyer, here is the problem with that way of approaching the statute."
2006.05-380,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1180.928,1181.211,No.
2006.05-380,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1221.338,1224.457,"Well, they do have a different view of the facts."
2006.05-380,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1225.373,1229.111,"So if they have a different view of the facts, why can't we leave it up to whatever facts develop?"
2006.05-380,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1240.317,1241.102,"--Well, I think--"
2006.05-380,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1241.102,1241.985,And otherwise not.
2006.05-380,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1241.985,1252.893,--If this Court rejects the facial challenge to this statute it is still going to be open for litigants in the future to try to identify specific conditions where this procedure is the safer alternative.
2006.05-380,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1252.893,1262.349,Can you tell me a hypothetical instance in which an as applied challenge could be brought if we sustain the statute on its face?
2006.05-380,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1293.868,1300.272,"Justice Kennedy, what I think I have in mind principally would be a preenforcement challenge that was an as applied challenge."
2006.05-380,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1319.4,1327.423,"Why isn't that already in the record, then, in the Ninth Circuit, in the Second Circuit and in the Eighth Circuit, in the district courts, proceedings in those circuits?"
2006.05-380,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1327.423,1329.958,"Well, there is an effort to make that showing."
2006.05-380,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1362.429,1369.849,"General Clement, I'm just thinking, trying to imagine how an as applied challenge would be really much different from what we have seen already."
2006.05-380,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1369.849,1378.272,"Well, I don't think, I mean, they've challenged everything including every application of the statute and they've tried to pick off some particular conditions."
2006.05-380,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1390.413,1396.4,"But General... General Clement, conditions don't show up in the abstract."
2006.05-380,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1423.134,1441.846,"--Well, Justice Ginsburg my understanding is that even when you talk about an idiosyncratic condition, I mean, the doctors who perform these abortions perform, you know, hundreds of them a year and they can identify those conditions and they have names for those conditions and I think it would be amenable to bringing a more as applied challenge."
2006.05-380,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1441.846,1452.903,"General, do you understand the scope of this statute to be different than the scope of the statute at issue in Stenberg, focusing in particular on the deliberate and intentional language?"
2006.05-380,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1452.903,1470.298,"I certainly do, Mr. Chief Justice, and I think that this statute, unlike the Nebraska statute, clearly uses an anatomical landmark approach that is based in the text of the statute and clearly distinguishes between the D&E procedure on the one hand and the D&X on the other hand."
2006.05-380,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1470.298,1475.75,But isn't it quite independent of the anatomical approach that the health exception is denied?
2006.05-380,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1581.499,1584.201,"Well, we would urge you to take any one of them."
2006.05-380,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1584.201,1585.035,Take all three.
2006.05-380,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1586.403,1590.005,"But in fairness, I mean, you know, we have an obligation to defend the statute."
2006.05-380,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1593.641,1597.778,"--Okay, but the problem, I guess... focus the problem this way."
2006.05-380,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1653.448,1655.882,"--I don't think so, Justice Souter."
2006.05-380,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1715.587,1716.404,"Thank you, General."
2006.05-380,1,38302,priscilla_j_smith,,1720.456,1731.412,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court--
2006.05-380,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1785.898,1791.016,Can you tell me... I didn't find it in the materials.
2006.05-380,1,38302,priscilla_j_smith,,1824.906,1825.423,No.
2006.05-380,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1865.1,1872.854,We have no evidence either in the record before the Court or Congress as to how often that situation arises?
2006.05-380,1,38302,priscilla_j_smith,,1872.854,1874.289,"No, we don't, Your Honor."
2006.05-380,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1895.953,1900.69,A have just other question that's generally related to the first.
2006.05-380,1,38302,priscilla_j_smith,,1944.802,1945.635,--Because it's what sir?
2006.05-380,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1945.635,1949.187,Because it's purely elective and not medically necessary.
2006.05-380,1,38302,priscilla_j_smith,,1949.187,1949.954,"No, Your Honor."
2006.05-380,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2006.791,2013.845,"Well, it might be related in the sense that the government's argument that there are alternate mechanisms is not a practical alternative."
2006.05-380,1,38302,priscilla_j_smith,,2025.918,2027.187,"No, not at all, Your Honor."
2006.05-380,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2035.258,2036.56,So in terms of--
2006.05-380,1,38302,priscilla_j_smith,,2036.56,2039.512,"--of any kind, not about any particular procedure."
2006.05-380,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2040.412,2044.566,--I didn't like your characterization and the government's of the state of the record.
2006.05-380,1,38302,priscilla_j_smith,,2078.103,2078.902,Yes.
2006.05-380,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2078.902,2087.226,"More statements in Congress, more statements that you... doctors who say, I need this procedure for safety."
2006.05-380,1,38302,priscilla_j_smith,,2087.226,2089.178,There are many more in this--
2006.05-380,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2089.178,2097.617,There are many more in this case than there were... in these two cases there are many more than there were in Congress and in Congress there are many more than they were in first Stenberg.
2006.05-380,1,38302,priscilla_j_smith,,2097.617,2098.051,--That's right.
2006.05-380,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2098.051,2118.78,"Now, if we look to the other side of the coin, the doctors who say, no, it isn't safe, there I'd have to say there are probably many more in Congress than there are... who say it isn't safe, there are probably many more in Congress; and then there are some in these cases, too; and there are hardly any in Stenberg, not too many."
2006.05-380,1,38302,priscilla_j_smith,,2118.78,2119.347,"Well, there is--"
2006.05-380,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2119.347,2120.347,"It was against you, in other words."
2006.05-380,1,38302,priscilla_j_smith,,2120.347,2123.799,--There are many letters written to Congress that are in the record.
2006.05-380,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2126.251,2126.834,Yes.
2006.05-380,1,38302,priscilla_j_smith,,2126.834,2131.155,--there were in Congress eight live witnesses that testified.
2006.05-380,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2131.155,2146.33,"All right, so I'm left with a record where I guess you have a subjective characterization that there is at least as much evidence in these cases supporting you and as much in Congress supporting you as there was in the first Stenberg case."
2006.05-380,1,38302,priscilla_j_smith,,2151.216,2151.818,Right.
2006.05-380,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2166.326,2171.113,"Ms. Smith, was the statement of the American College of Obstetricians and--"
2006.05-380,1,38302,priscilla_j_smith,,2173.165,2190.876,"Yes, Your Honor, it was, as was the brief that was filed, the amicus brief that was filed in this case in Stenberg was before Congress, and also testimony from numerous physicians in the form of a letter."
2006.05-380,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2194.928,2214.056,We'll give you an extra 30 seconds.
2006.05-380,1,38302,priscilla_j_smith,,2216.757,2218.109,"That's fine, Your Honor."
2006.05-380,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2224.763,2238.588,"My question basically I think you might have been going after is, I was saying that I agreed with you in that there is more evidence supporting your side in these cases than there was before Congress, than there was in first Stenberg."
2006.05-380,1,38302,priscilla_j_smith,,2238.588,2239.088,Yes.
2006.05-380,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2239.088,2256.299,"But still there was a finding in Congress and there wasn't a finding in the Nebraska legislature, and so does that fact of the finding being in Congress and not in the Nebraska legislature... what kind of legal difference does that make?"
2006.05-380,1,38302,priscilla_j_smith,,2256.299,2259.401,"And Your Honor, what I would say in this case, it makes none."
2006.05-380,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2283.017,2286.651,May I ask you this question about what you think we should do.
2006.05-380,1,38302,priscilla_j_smith,,2318.686,2341.786,"--Well, I think there is, there's been some confusion about the word ""necessary"" and it's been used sometimes to talk about whether there are other procedures that could be used, as opposed to the determination that it is the safest procedure that reduces significantly the risk of very serious complications, not the risks of minor complications."
2006.05-380,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2341.786,2344.071,I guess that gets back to the point earlier.
2006.05-380,1,38302,priscilla_j_smith,,2349.824,2352.843,"No, not at all, Your Honor."
2006.05-380,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2386.415,2394.52,What degree of marginal impact on safety do you think is necessary to override the State's interest?
2006.05-380,1,38302,priscilla_j_smith,,2411.132,2416.284,I don't believe a marginal benefit in safety is enough and I don't believe that's what we have here.
2006.05-380,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2436.93,2448.904,"But I thought your submission earlier is that we don't have any record evidence about how often the complications arise, so it's hard to get a handle on exactly what the difference is in terms of safety under your submission."
2006.05-380,1,38302,priscilla_j_smith,,2448.904,2451.371,We don't have a quantification of the safety.
2006.05-380,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2480.173,2494.783,"If we could go back to the first question that the Chief asked you, you said yes, it will prevent abortions because of this uncertain line between the D&X and the D&E."
2006.05-380,1,38302,priscilla_j_smith,,2506.157,2507.607,"Absolutely, Your Honor."
2006.05-380,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2549.103,2557.959,May I ask you to focus on one particular problem that I think is implicated by Justice Ginsburg's question.
2006.05-380,1,38302,priscilla_j_smith,,2640.613,2641.313,"Yes, Your Honor."
2006.05-380,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2658.658,2659.758,I understand that.
2006.05-380,1,38302,priscilla_j_smith,,2659.758,2660.191,Yes.
2006.05-380,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2660.191,2666.511,But could you start simply with the factual predicate for your argument and his argument.
2006.05-380,1,38302,priscilla_j_smith,,2677.251,2677.751,Yes.
2006.05-380,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2690.043,2700.249,I thought the evidence was that you're looking for a different degree of dilation if you're intending to perform D&E than if... and you're looking for a greater degree if you're intending to perform a D&X.
2006.05-380,1,38302,priscilla_j_smith,,2700.249,2702.184,It doesn't play out that way.
2006.05-380,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2709.238,2716.278,"Is your submission that there aren't dilation protocols if you're intending a D&E and if you're intending a D&X, they're the same?"
2006.05-380,1,38302,priscilla_j_smith,,2716.278,2717.411,--It varies by doctor.
2006.05-380,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2731.453,2742.576,"Well, they may not be able to control it in an absolute sense, but can't they go about it in a way that would tend to produce less rather than more dilation?"
2006.05-380,1,38302,priscilla_j_smith,,2742.576,2743.428,Not--
2006.05-380,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2743.428,2759.288,"It can't guarantee results, but couldn't they at least start with a, I don't know how you put it, a procedure that would be likely to produce less rather than more, and hence come within the safe harbor, if you will, of the statute?"
2006.05-380,1,38302,priscilla_j_smith,,2759.288,2761.889,"--Well, they are always looking for a minimal amount of dilation."
2006.05-380,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2775.982,2778.268,"Well, you say they don't, but my question is, can they?"
2006.05-380,1,38302,priscilla_j_smith,,2787.707,2790.159,"--Not in the first day of dilation, no."
2006.05-380,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2795.98,2799.698,Can you tell us where to look in the record for the evidence on that?
2006.05-380,1,38302,priscilla_j_smith,,2799.698,2808.887,"Each doctor testifies about their own dilation protocols, Your Honor, and I believe that's in the Eighth Circuit appendix."
2006.05-380,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2819.426,2823.48,If there were a health exception--
2006.05-380,1,38302,priscilla_j_smith,,2823.48,2823.98,Yes.
2006.05-380,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2823.98,2832.486,"--The health of the woman, would that obviate the vagueness and overbreadth problems that you bring up?"
2006.05-380,1,38302,priscilla_j_smith,,2856.784,2872.51,"Not if this is not limited to intact, Your Honor, because then you would be limiting D&E abortions, which is 95 percent of all abortions, to circumstances where the doctor could prove that it was in fact the safest procedure."
2006.05-380,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2900.544,2910.352,"Do you think the, on the same issue I think, that the addition of the deliberately and intentionally language in the congressional act addresses that concern?"
2006.05-380,1,38302,priscilla_j_smith,,2910.352,2915.471,"No, Your Honor, because actually that same language is in the Stenberg, the Nebraska statute."
2006.05-380,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2960.684,2962.467,"That's what I was wondering, because--"
2006.05-380,1,38302,priscilla_j_smith,,2962.467,2962.917,I'm sorry.
2006.05-380,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2962.917,2980.163,"--Suppose, this might help, suppose the physician testifies that I wanted to do a nonintact, an in utero D&E, that that's, that was my intent, that's what I wanted to do, that's what I always want to do."
2006.05-380,1,38302,priscilla_j_smith,,2995.775,2995.941,No.
2006.05-380,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3047.124,3051.243,"Well, give me one instance in which your proposed interpretation would work in the real world."
2006.05-380,1,38302,priscilla_j_smith,,3051.243,3079.345,"--Well, there are allegations in the Congressional Record, for example, in reference... in Justice Thomas' dissent by Nurse Schaffer, Dr. Pamela Smith, about circumstances where the physician actually holds the fetus in the woman's body in order to cause fetal demise, rather than causing fetal demise because it's an integral part of removal of the fetus from the woman's uterus."
2006.05-380,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3088.968,3096.722,"Well, just on that last point, I mean, we are interested of course in different interpretations, but it just seems to me that your interpretation would have very little practical effect."
2006.05-380,1,38302,priscilla_j_smith,,3096.722,3133.58,"Well, it would... it would ban certainly a certain type of intact procedure that was discussed, and I think the image many people have of ""partial birth abortion"" frankly, that this is something that's done gratuitously, not as an integral part of making this procedure the safest for the woman, and avoiding instrumentation and avoiding perforation and hysterectomies, which are serious complications that though rare, when they occur, they are catastrophic and life changing and disastrous."
2006.05-380,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3306.809,3308.326,Could I ask you just one thing?
2006.05-380,1,38302,priscilla_j_smith,,3308.326,3308.91,Yes.
2006.05-380,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3308.91,3314.462,"The statute, of course, refers to both feet first and vertex deliveries."
2006.05-380,1,38302,priscilla_j_smith,,3319.632,3320.032,Not very common.
2006.05-380,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3337.393,3350.32,"And in giving your arguments toward the safety benefits of the D&X, I couldn't understand why they wouldn't also apply to the total delivery of the fetus in a vertex delivery situation."
2006.05-380,1,38302,priscilla_j_smith,,3350.32,3351.27,I'm sorry.
2006.05-380,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3352.92,3356.891,"Well, my understanding is that the vertex, the skull and head are already outside the mother."
2006.05-380,1,38302,priscilla_j_smith,,3356.891,3357.307,Yes.
2006.05-380,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3357.307,3363.461,And the objection in the feet first is that you want fewer instrument passes and so on.
2006.05-380,1,38302,priscilla_j_smith,,3363.461,3363.995,Yes.
2006.05-380,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3363.995,3369.281,"But in that case, it's not the skull itself that is preventing the delivery of the fetus."
2006.05-380,1,38302,priscilla_j_smith,,3369.281,3369.749,Right.
2006.05-380,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3369.749,3380.506,"So your arguments about why the D&X is safer than feet first, wouldn't that apply in the case of total delivery of the fetus as well?"
2006.05-380,1,38302,priscilla_j_smith,,3392.647,3396.599,"Yes, but these are circumstances where the fetus can't be delivered."
2006.05-380,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3403.769,3407.771,"In the case of a vertex delivery, where is the obstruction?"
2006.05-380,1,38302,priscilla_j_smith,,3407.771,3418.095,"--The obstruction would come from a distension of the abdomen, usually from a fetal anomaly like a sides, which is, this is a serious anomaly."
2006.05-380,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3429.82,3439.426,It seems to me that your argument is that there is always a constitutional right to use what the physician thinks is the safest procedure.
2006.05-380,1,38302,priscilla_j_smith,,3439.426,3441.044,"No, Your Honor."
2006.05-380,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3441.711,3446.782,I inferred that from your comments.
2006.05-380,1,38302,priscilla_j_smith,,3446.782,3447.898,"--I don't think so, Your Honor."
2006.05-380,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3477.467,3485.49,"So then, you think there are instances in which the state can require that a procedure be used, even if it's not the safest procedure?"
2006.05-380,1,38302,priscilla_j_smith,,3485.49,3486.79,I'm sorry.
2006.05-380,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3487.273,3488.359,"So then, the--"
2006.05-380,1,38302,priscilla_j_smith,,3488.359,3489.109,--Yeah.
2006.05-380,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3489.109,3499.131,"--The obverse of the proposition I put at first, it must be true that there are some instances in which the state can prohibit a procedure even if it is the safest procedure."
2006.05-380,1,38302,priscilla_j_smith,,3499.131,3513.74,"That's true, Your Honor, as long as it doesn't pose an undue burden on the woman, which as you know, certainly the circumstance with the D&E, which is 95 percent of abortions, under the Stenberg ruling."
2006.05-380,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3513.74,3514.157,Can I just follow up on that?
2006.05-380,1,38302,priscilla_j_smith,,3514.157,3514.507,Yes.
2006.05-380,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3514.507,3515.176,I don't understand that.
2006.05-380,1,38302,priscilla_j_smith,,3527.067,3527.317,I don't understand what you mean.
2006.05-380,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3527.317,3535.404,"--He said that the state can prohibit something even if it is the safest procedure, and your answer was so long as it doesn't--"
2006.05-380,1,38302,priscilla_j_smith,,3535.404,3536.339,No.
2006.05-380,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3536.339,3537.239,--pose an undue burden.
2006.05-380,1,38302,priscilla_j_smith,,3546.629,3547.045,No.
2006.05-380,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3613.587,3614.87,"Thank you, Miss Smith."
2006.05-380,1,38302,priscilla_j_smith,,3614.87,3615.837,"Thank you, Your Honor."
2006.05-380,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3615.837,3618.055,"General Clement, you have two minutes remaining."
2006.05-380,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,3618.055,3622.19,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2006.05-380,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3736.377,3736.96,"Thank you, General."
