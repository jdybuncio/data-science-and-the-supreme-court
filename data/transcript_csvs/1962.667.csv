1962.667,0,35398,morris_b_abram,,10.407,15.854,Mr. Chief Justice and members of the Court.
1962.667,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,82.8,84.533,"There was no preliminary hearing, was there?"
1962.667,0,35398,morris_b_abram,,84.533,85.558,Yes sir I'm --
1962.667,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,85.558,85.8,There was?
1962.667,0,35398,morris_b_abram,,85.8,88.909,The record Your Honor is silent on that point.
1962.667,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,95.109,95.3,I see.
1962.667,0,35398,morris_b_abram,,95.3,97.476,-- but it is not in the record.
1962.667,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,296.941,298.382,[Inaudible]
1962.667,0,35398,morris_b_abram,,298.382,300.035,"All in the records, yes sir."
1962.667,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,300.035,302.261,[Inaudible]
1962.667,0,35398,morris_b_abram,,302.261,303.021,There maybe more.
1962.667,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,351.471,356.183,[Inaudible]
1962.667,0,35398,morris_b_abram,,356.183,364.739,That was -- I think the Court will find that was with respect to the testimony outside the presence of a jury on the question of admissibility.
1962.667,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,534.678,536.187,Was that true?
1962.667,0,35398,morris_b_abram,,536.187,539.874,"Yes, I think as far as I know it was Mr. Chief Justice."
1962.667,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,866.971,870.704,"Before you start that may I ask, how long was the trial?"
1962.667,0,35398,morris_b_abram,,870.704,871.616,One day Your Honor.
1962.667,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,871.616,873.278,One day.
1962.667,0,35398,morris_b_abram,,873.278,880.42,"And I might add in respect to that, there was half a page of cross examination of the prosecutrix in this case."
1962.667,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1425.171,1430.026,Is the defendant entitled to call witnesses at the preliminary examination?
1962.667,0,35398,morris_b_abram,,1430.026,1434.453,I do not know what the law is under this -- with Mississippi Your Honor.
1962.667,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1708.549,1720.592,"Mr. Abram, may I ask what you base your statement on when you say that the atmosphere of prejudice was pervasive and it is --"
1962.667,0,35398,morris_b_abram,,1720.592,1722.973,I say that Your Honor in view of the following.
1962.667,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1735.009,1741.008,Do you question – do you question the statement of the State that this is done routinely for everybody in that event?
1962.667,0,35398,morris_b_abram,,1741.008,1744.31,I have no knowledge of it one way or another Your Honor.
1962.667,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1924.088,1930.463,[Inaudible]
1962.667,0,35398,morris_b_abram,,1930.463,1932.638,That's exactly my point Your Honor.
1962.667,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1933.768,1935.301,It is not their function?
1962.667,0,35398,morris_b_abram,,1935.301,1938.952,It is not the function of the jury to decide upon the admissibility of the confession.
1962.667,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1938.952,1942.152,[Inaudible]
1962.667,0,35398,morris_b_abram,,1942.152,1943.546,"I think that is correct, sir."
1962.667,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1943.546,1944.948,And it's the function of the judge?
1962.667,0,35398,morris_b_abram,,1944.948,1946.055,It's the function of the Judge.
1962.667,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1946.055,1950.295,[Inaudible]
1962.667,0,35398,morris_b_abram,,1950.295,1963.435,"Well, I would have thought Your Honor that what he was doing was placing upon the jury a determination which essentially was his and he was sharing it to the jury."
1962.667,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1963.435,1964.514,He had made the determination?
1962.667,0,35398,morris_b_abram,,1964.514,1974.494,"He had made the determination but then he turned around and says, “You may take into account whether the evidence was made or obtained under the influence of hope or fear."
1962.667,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1974.494,1977.618,"That's giving the defendant more than he's entitled to under the Mississippi law, isn't it?"
1962.667,0,35398,morris_b_abram,,1977.618,1986.894,"I think Your Honor that it is confusing the jury because it permits the jury again to pass on the question of admissibility, of the confession to begin with."
1962.667,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1998.156,2003.512,[Inaudible]
1962.667,0,35398,morris_b_abram,,2003.512,2021.809,"Well, I can see the Court's point about it but on the other hand, in the Richmond case, the Court held that the defendant is entitled to a correct and non-confusing statement and I'm not sure whether in that case the Court would've considered it beneficial or not beneficial but at least it was considered to be confusing."
1962.667,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2021.809,2027.957,[Inaudible]
1962.667,0,35398,morris_b_abram,,2027.957,2028.242,I didn't hear Mr. --
1962.667,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2028.242,2033.463,[Inaudible]
1962.667,0,35398,morris_b_abram,,2033.463,2036.131,"On that point, that's right, that's exactly right."
1962.667,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2036.131,2043.473,"If the Court had simply called the jury that the -- the Court had determined that the confession was voluntary, that's all."
1962.667,0,35398,morris_b_abram,,2043.473,2043.918,"Yes sir, I think (Voice Overlap) --"
1962.667,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2043.918,2046.933,I think that would've been more helpful to the defendant than the charge of the accused?
1962.667,0,35398,morris_b_abram,,2046.933,2050.077,"Well, I can't -- I can't make that judgment Your Honor."
1962.667,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2064.591,2066.681,[Inaudible]
1962.667,0,35398,morris_b_abram,,2066.681,2073.074,"Well, I don't really know, I think that's a tough question."
1962.667,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2131.383,2132.37,Mr. Lyell.
1962.667,1,25627,g_garland_lyell_jr,,2132.37,2137.252,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1962.667,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2426.608,2430.247,[Inaudible]
1962.667,1,25627,g_garland_lyell_jr,,2430.247,2434.227,"I have no idea, Mr. Justice Goldberg."
1962.667,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2439.507,2440.977,[Inaudible]
1962.667,1,25627,g_garland_lyell_jr,,2440.977,2457.275,"All I know is what's in this brief if we can take that as fact and that's predicated on two newspaper items, one in the Jackson paper, one in the Madison County paper to the effect that the accused had waived the preliminary hearing."
1962.667,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2463.877,2464.596,The White case.
1962.667,1,25627,g_garland_lyell_jr,,2464.596,2471.878,The White -- White versus Maryland and I certainly don't think this situation would be equated with that.

1962.667,1,25627,g_garland_lyell_jr,,2483.54,2483.948,Sir?
1962.667,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,2483.948,2487.93,[Inaudible] plea on hand?

1962.667,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2526.231,2536.672,"Before you leave the preliminary hearing, you're brief says that Mississippi law requires taking of an offender before proper official without unnecessary delay?"
1962.667,1,25627,g_garland_lyell_jr,,2536.672,2537.431,It does.
1962.667,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2537.431,2545.809,Is that done -- in practice is there -- is there usually or a preliminary hearing or is there always a preliminary hearing?

1962.667,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2841.566,2849.31,Was it open to counsel when he was appointed to attack the composition of the grand jury?
1962.667,1,25627,g_garland_lyell_jr,,2849.31,2850.189,"Yes, sir."

1962.667,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2856.199,2873.502,"But what -- what did he lose by reason of the fact that he didn't attack the grand jury before it was empanelled? He did lose some right, didn't you -- didn't you say that he could do something --"
1962.667,1,25627,g_garland_lyell_jr,,2873.502,2875.669,"I must've misunderstood you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1962.667,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2878.458,2890.044,"I understood you to say that there was one certain kind of attack that he could make on -- against the grand jury, but it would have to be made before the jury was empanelled?"
1962.667,1,25627,g_garland_lyell_jr,,2890.044,2896.199,That would be as to the qualificate -- qualification of a particular person to sit on that grand jury.
