1998.98-208,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.077,"We'll hear argument now in No. 98-208, Carole Kolstad v. the American Dental Association."
1998.98-208,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,9.848,13.26,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1998.98-208,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,60.483,69.818,"Well, is it your position... and I take it that it is... that every case of intentional discrimination should at least go to the jury on the question of punitives?"
1998.98-208,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,69.818,71.29,That is not our position.
1998.98-208,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,79.353,85.879,"Well, does proof of intentional discrimination suffice for a jury to find punitives?"
1998.98-208,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,85.879,87.638,--Not necessarily.
1998.98-208,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,99.688,100.819,Reckless disregard of what?
1998.98-208,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,100.819,105.17,--Of the... of the rights... the federally protected rights of the plaintiff.
1998.98-208,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,105.17,111.806,And where do you get that out of the statute... that it should be reckless disregard of--
1998.98-208,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,111.806,112.647,I'm sorry... reckless indifference.
1998.98-208,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,115.549,123.512,--But one ordinarily thinks that intentional is a higher level of... of mens rea than recklessness.
1998.98-208,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,129.377,144.306,"But there... there could be circumstances, as was true in the Hazen case, in which the... for example, the law was sufficiently unclear as to whether or not a particular act of discrimination, although technically intentional, was, nonetheless, illegal."
1998.98-208,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,152.832,154.685,"So, it's kind of like qualified immunity in a--"
1998.98-208,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,154.685,157.166,"--Well, it... it's a little bit analogous."
1998.98-208,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,161.747,162.648,"--But, Mr.... I'm sorry--"
1998.98-208,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,162.648,176.648,--If... if you had a situation in which... the standard that we propose with regard to reckless indifference is that the defendant either knew or should reasonably have known that what it was doing was probably illegal.
1998.98-208,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,180.451,194.059,"--Well, do you think that, just in general, that Congress probably intended, as is normally the case, to make it more difficult to get... to be entitled to punitive damages than to gain compensatory damages, really?"
1998.98-208,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,194.059,208.357,"The... the statutory standard for... for punitive damages in many Title VII cases will, as a practical matter, be satisfied by proof of intent, but not all."
1998.98-208,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,214.121,215.874,"Well, you didn't answer my question, though."
1998.98-208,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,215.874,216.485,--I'm sorry.
1998.98-208,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,216.485,223.077,"Which is, do you think Congress intended for it to be more difficult to get punitive damages than to get compensatory damages?"
1998.98-208,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,231.853,235.276,"Well, I... I... I think the textual answer is yes."
1998.98-208,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,238.327,239.589,"Oh, you think Congress may have made a mistake?"
1998.98-208,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,239.589,241.309,"--No, no, no."
1998.98-208,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,241.309,242.601,"It ended up that way, but they really didn't--"
1998.98-208,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,242.601,243.082,No.
1998.98-208,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,251.808,253.047,"--Well, Mr. Schnapper--"
1998.98-208,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,253.047,256.289,"If that's a question about... about whether it was debated, I think I purport it was not."
1998.98-208,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,256.289,256.839,--I see.
1998.98-208,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,282.038,284.238,It does not require any knowledge of the law for there to be--
1998.98-208,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,284.238,284.729,All right.
1998.98-208,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,294.203,304.522,"--Yes, it would require either knowledge or... or, as the Court said, I think, in McLaughlin, recklessness in determining what the defendants knew their obligations were."
1998.98-208,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,304.522,304.893,Okay.
1998.98-208,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,345.789,346.36,Yes.
1998.98-208,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,346.36,352.114,"Well, then, if you're correct in that, Mr.... then it... it bears a remarkable resemblance to qualified immunity."
1998.98-208,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,352.114,362.839,"The... the... the difference, Your Honor, as we formulate the standard, is that the knowledge required here is that the action is probably illegal."
1998.98-208,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,368.051,372.396,And you would charge... you would charge the jury to find whether or not something was probably illegal?
1998.98-208,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,372.396,374.847,"--If... if, in a particular--"
1998.98-208,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,374.847,376.557,"I mean, you would have to, wouldn't you?"
1998.98-208,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,384.725,393.23,"--Your Honor, if... if there was a question as to whether or not the action was probably illegal, our view is that that would be a question the judge would have to decide."
1998.98-208,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,393.23,394.469,But--
1998.98-208,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,398.904,403.274,The defendant's knowledge or the defendant's lack of care in ascertaining the law would be jury questions.
1998.98-208,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,403.274,403.865,--Yes.
1998.98-208,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,404.366,407.128,But the question of whether or not... what the state of the law in fact was--
1998.98-208,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,407.128,407.709,--The jury... the jury--
1998.98-208,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,417.375,417.694,--No.
1998.98-208,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,437.059,445.443,"You mean usually... I mean, my goodness... you mean usually there's... there's no intent to injure when you... when you discriminate on this basis?"
1998.98-208,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,448.575,461.634,"I think a desire that the victim be injured is not necessarily present in... in a case like this, where the defendant has been found to have preferred to hire... to promote Mr. Spangler because he's a man."
1998.98-208,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,467.148,469.639,"Mr. Schnapper, you gave one such example."
1998.98-208,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,511.538,512.328,"Yes, Your Honor."
1998.98-208,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,546.469,554.585,"Well, I take it what Congress was trying to do was to tell us that there are degrees of culpability insofar as the defendants are concerned."
1998.98-208,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,593.471,594.933,--Yes.
1998.98-208,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,613.563,618.585,How does the... how does the jury... how is the jury instructed?
1998.98-208,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,618.585,629.644,"Well, at this point in time, with regard to the second phase, the... the practices vary quite widely as to whether juries are in fact given much guidance as to how to exercise that discretion."
1998.98-208,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,639.65,641.753,"Mr. Schnapper, what about... what about attribution?"
1998.98-208,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,670.03,673.052,We don't believe so.
1998.98-208,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,681.029,682.188,Well... well--
1998.98-208,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,693.885,694.336,Allen.
1998.98-208,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,694.336,694.927,Allen.
1998.98-208,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,707.563,713.359,"I think, if... if one were to look only at agency principles, even... even Wheat would be high enough."
1998.98-208,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,715.65,718.122,Was... Wheat was the head of the Washington office?
1998.98-208,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,718.122,718.462,Yes.
1998.98-208,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,718.462,721.003,And Allen was the executive director of the whole operation?
1998.98-208,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,721.003,722.105,That's exactly right.
1998.98-208,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,778.042,779.103,"Well, how do I know that that was the reason?"
1998.98-208,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,779.103,779.374,--Because--
1998.98-208,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,779.374,781.294,"I mean, all I see is the text of the statute."
1998.98-208,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,819.138,823.382,--Let me... let me take another try at answering this.
1998.98-208,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,852.311,854.001,"Mr. Schnapper, may I just interject this thought?"
1998.98-208,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,860.486,866.069,"--Well, in this case, I would hope I could persuade even Justice Scalia, because this is in fact in the text of the statute."
1998.98-208,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,879.037,883.472,It's not in your appendix A. It's... it's in the prologue of the... of the statute?
1998.98-208,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,886.521,887.322,--I... I believe that's right.
1998.98-208,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,889.314,891.887,I'll be happy to look at the Public Law.
1998.98-208,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,891.887,894.338,"--Thank you, Your Honor."
1998.98-208,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,894.828,910.407,"May I ask... now, the position of the en banc dissenters here supported the notion that it must be the company or the Dental Association itself that acted recklessly or with malice here, was it not?"
1998.98-208,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,916.053,919.355,--I think that's... I think that's probably the right... correct reading.
1998.98-208,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,925.297,928.151,"Thank you, Mr. Schnapper."
1998.98-208,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,931.531,936.994,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1998.98-208,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,966.935,969.278,"Well, Mr.... General Waxman, that's quite true."
1998.98-208,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,996.784,1015.747,"Mr. Chief Justice, it is entirely appropriate for this Court, and other courts, to proceed on the assumption that punitive damages are generally not favored in the law, and that, as this Court demonstrated in BMW v. Gore, there are constitutional limitations on the amount of punitive damages that are awarded."
1998.98-208,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1098.721,1106.856,"Should it be the consciousness of the company itself or, in this case, the Association, or some lesser employee?"
1998.98-208,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1106.856,1113.582,"Well, clearly, the defendant in the case is the employer."
1998.98-208,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1135.154,1136.566,"Well, I'm asking you for a principle."
1998.98-208,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1136.566,1137.807,--Well--
1998.98-208,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1137.807,1140.798,Because I want to keep that in mind as we decide this case.
1998.98-208,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1142.51,1173.873,"--I think our position on it, Justice O'Connor... let me first say that, following this Court's decisions in Faragher and Ellerth last spring, there has already developed a split in the circuits, between the Fifth and the 11th Circuit, in cases, both coincidentally involving Wal-Mart, over whether the paradigm that this Court created in Faragher and Ellerth should be directly applied to punitive damages, or whether you should do what the... whether you should start from the place this Court began in those cases."
1998.98-208,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1269.485,1275.487,"But if the EEOC considers something like that, I mean, it's not on the basis of running jury trials, is it?"
1998.98-208,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1275.487,1276.329,"Well, no."
1998.98-208,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1282.813,1287.455,"Well, why... why does the EEOC have any business laying down jury instructions?"
1998.98-208,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1287.455,1292.941,"--The EEOC, Your Honor, under Title VII, is a plaint... is a plaintiff in very many of these cases."
1998.98-208,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1292.941,1297.052,"So, you're talking about not the EEOC as an administrative body, but when it goes to court?"
1998.98-208,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1297.052,1297.662,"Oh, sure."
1998.98-208,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1317.104,1319.716,"Well, have you answered my question yet?"
1998.98-208,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1319.716,1320.487,I haven't fin--
1998.98-208,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1320.487,1321.338,Because I'm not sure you have.
1998.98-208,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1324.831,1334.889,"--I would... our position, Justice O'Connor, is that in cases resulting in tangible employment consequences, as in this case, the EEOC--"
1998.98-208,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1334.889,1336.859,"By that, you mean not hiring?"
1998.98-208,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1336.859,1340.262,"--Not fired... not fired, not hired, demoted, promoted."
1998.98-208,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1344.562,1346.755,"Well, that's 90 percent of the cases, but go ahead."
1998.98-208,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1346.755,1361.894,"--In those cases, we believe that the... the principle expressed in the Restatement, that if the employee acted in a managerial capacity and was within the scope of his employment, the company is liable for punitive damages in the jury's discretion."
1998.98-208,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1362.404,1371.12,Is that the same as the traditional agency principles for when you subject a company to punitive damages liability?
1998.98-208,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1371.12,1372.012,--That... that... what I've told you--
1998.98-208,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1372.012,1373.104,Or is some variation of that?
1998.98-208,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1373.104,1379.679,"--Well, what I've... the articulation I've given you is verbatim out of the Restatement of Torts."
1998.98-208,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1416.391,1417.462,"General Waxman, could--"
1998.98-208,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1417.462,1418.324,--almost never arisen.
1998.98-208,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1418.324,1427.27,"--Can I ask you, before you sit down, what charge would you request or what charge would you say fits with your interpretation of the law?"
1998.98-208,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1433.255,1437.414,"Well, I think that the jury ought to be charged in the language of the statute that Congress set out."
1998.98-208,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1449.843,1466.975,"Suppose you have a case in which the employer tells the female employee, you're... you're carrying a child, you're going to be a mother soon, we think this position is... is just going to put too much stress on you, because women have special bonds with the child."
1998.98-208,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1477.002,1478.822,"--Well, that--"
1998.98-208,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1478.822,1489.1,"--and say, well, this man was wrong under the law, but he acted in, really, her best interest, he wasn't malice... malicious in the usual sense of that term; could the jury--"
1998.98-208,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1489.1,1489.921,"--Well, if the... if the... if--"
1998.98-208,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1489.921,1492.343,--consider that among themselves in their own deliberations?
1998.98-208,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1492.343,1494.322,--The answer is certainly yes.
1998.98-208,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1495.424,1495.915,Okay.
1998.98-208,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1498.126,1501.338,"--Well, with respect to punitive damages--"
1998.98-208,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1501.338,1505.542,"Yeah, if you could complete the... you didn't get to finish what your instruction would be."
1998.98-208,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1505.993,1506.393,--No.
1998.98-208,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1536.142,1537.154,"--Thank you, General Waxman."
1998.98-208,2,39257,raymond_c_fay,,1541.847,1544.838,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1998.98-208,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1592.439,1594.192,May... may I just... I'm just not quite sure I followed your argument.
1998.98-208,2,39257,raymond_c_fay,,1603.358,1605.549,"It's both, Justice Stevens."
1998.98-208,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1629.415,1639.66,"So, your answer would be different, and... and you would... would you concede that Plaintiff is correct, if instead of saying ""punitive damages"" it had been called ""liquidated damages""?"
1998.98-208,2,39257,raymond_c_fay,,1651.468,1655.701,"--That may... very well may be a... a different signal, Your Honor."
1998.98-208,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1674.034,1680.459,"Well, I'm... I'm proposing liquidated damages without embell... embellishment, or, say, if it had said statutory damages."
1998.98-208,2,39257,raymond_c_fay,,1680.459,1686.333,And... and my answer is that I agree that that may very well have a different meaning.
1998.98-208,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1691.465,1693.225,How about civil penalties?
1998.98-208,2,39257,raymond_c_fay,,1693.225,1696.677,Civil penalties come in different... different shapes.
1998.98-208,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1704.342,1710.416,"Mr. Fay... Mr Fay, I'm... you said the... the language, it's reckless indifference to the federally protected rights."
1998.98-208,2,39257,raymond_c_fay,,1714.45,1714.971,--It certainly does.
1998.98-208,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1751.485,1754.049,"No, but malice... malice is conduct?"
1998.98-208,2,39257,raymond_c_fay,,1754.049,1758.161,"--Well, when... again, the statute is framed this way."
1998.98-208,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1768.519,1770.809,"Well, the reference is to the statute... to the... to the rights."
1998.98-208,2,39257,raymond_c_fay,,1773.169,1782.426,"It also tells us, Justice Souter, that it is the... it is the discriminatory practice that is done with respect to those rights."
1998.98-208,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1785.548,1795.546,"And the mental state looks to rights, not to the conduct or consciousness of the conduct, or even consciousness of the tangible consequences of the conduct."
1998.98-208,2,39257,raymond_c_fay,,1795.546,1797.466,"It does both, Your Honor."
1998.98-208,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1798.966,1808.183,"Well, at the very least, then, you agree that it does look to consciousness or... or indifference to the existence of the sources of the legal rights?"
1998.98-208,2,39257,raymond_c_fay,,1808.183,1808.824,--That's correct.
1998.98-208,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1808.824,1809.304,Okay.
1998.98-208,2,39257,raymond_c_fay,,1809.304,1811.715,And what I'm saying is you can't divorce that from the conduct that's at issue.
1998.98-208,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1825.644,1827.146,Why isn't it up to the jury?
1998.98-208,2,39257,raymond_c_fay,,1849.921,1851.243,They certainly would take it into account.
1998.98-208,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1869.253,1869.794,"Well, what--"
1998.98-208,2,39257,raymond_c_fay,,1879.111,1879.682,It is.
1998.98-208,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1879.682,1887.479,"What it says specifically is the first question in these cases is, was there intentional discrimination, say, on the ground of gender?"
1998.98-208,2,39257,raymond_c_fay,,1976.876,1985.232,"I... I think that your second question, Justice Breyer, does not take into account what types of damages these are."
1998.98-208,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2005.345,2012.781,"Mr. Fay, do I understand that you are riding... putting your heaviest weight on the label ""punitive damages""?"
1998.98-208,2,39257,raymond_c_fay,,2024.157,2035.454,"The second part of my answer to the... to your previous question, Your Honor, was that at common law, reckless indifference was, as stated in footnote 10 of the Smith v. Wade opinion, the equivalent of malice."
1998.98-208,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2035.454,2043.599,"Oh, so, then, the label doesn't matter, and you'd say the same thing, even if it said ""liquidated damages"" or ""statutory damages"" and not ""punitive damages""?"
1998.98-208,2,39257,raymond_c_fay,,2044.39,2045.312,No.
1998.98-208,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2054.396,2056.659,"--So, suppose the label were ""liquidated damages""."
1998.98-208,2,39257,raymond_c_fay,,2062.121,2064.983,--It would be very much closer to Justice Breyer's description.
1998.98-208,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2064.983,2075.909,"Well, you're saying, I guess, then, that there's got to be deliberate indifference with respect to the... to the... to the right, as such, but there's got to be some egregiousness in addition to that."
1998.98-208,2,39257,raymond_c_fay,,2080.864,2085.337,"I'm saying that it... it has to be, as part of it, in this statutory framework."
1998.98-208,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2085.337,2090.73,"Well, if that's the case, then why doesn't deliberate... egregious, deliberate indifference just collapse into malice?"
1998.98-208,2,39257,raymond_c_fay,,2105.61,2105.96,That's correct.
1998.98-208,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2105.96,2115.457,"And I... I don't know quite how I would draw a line between malice, in that sense of consciousness, and some kind of egregious degree of... of indifference."
1998.98-208,2,39257,raymond_c_fay,,2115.457,2117.067,Well--
1998.98-208,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2117.067,2119.979,I don't know how... I don't know how a jury would ever tell them apart.
1998.98-208,2,39257,raymond_c_fay,,2119.979,2127.305,"--The... in terms of the classical definitions of malice, which is actual evil motive or intent to injure, and--"
1998.98-208,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2127.305,2139.983,"No, but you've just given... I don't want to put words in your mouth if you don't want to take them... but I thought you had... had agreed with me that malice here probably means a... an actual knowledge of the legal prohibition."
1998.98-208,2,39257,raymond_c_fay,,2139.983,2142.344,"--Oh, it may--"
1998.98-208,2,39257,raymond_c_fay,,2142.344,2143.223,You... you don't agree with me on that?
1998.98-208,2,39257,raymond_c_fay,,2143.223,2151.06,--malice may have a actual intent which is irrespective of the knowledge of the requirements of the law.
1998.98-208,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2151.06,2153.141,"Malice is an intent to be... to be nasty, to hurt."
1998.98-208,2,39257,raymond_c_fay,,2153.141,2153.472,Yes.
1998.98-208,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2153.962,2154.223,You--
1998.98-208,2,39257,raymond_c_fay,,2170.983,2171.684,And that's--
1998.98-208,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2171.684,2173.104,--How could that be malice?
1998.98-208,2,39257,raymond_c_fay,,2173.104,2175.557,"--And that's precisely why, Justice Scalia--"
1998.98-208,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2175.557,2184.41,"So, I think malice may well mean... malice may well mean actual knowledge that it's against the law, and nothing but that."
1998.98-208,2,39257,raymond_c_fay,,2184.41,2186.042,--Well--
1998.98-208,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2186.042,2189.335,Because you have to read it: malice or deliberate indifference.
1998.98-208,2,39257,raymond_c_fay,,2192.878,2193.967,--That's true.
1998.98-208,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2212.991,2213.572,Exactly.
1998.98-208,2,39257,raymond_c_fay,,2216.464,2217.403,I agree... I agree with that.
1998.98-208,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2217.403,2220.173,"So, actual knowledge of unlawfulness is malice; you agree with that?"
1998.98-208,2,39257,raymond_c_fay,,2220.173,2224.027,I... I don't think you need actual knowledge of unlawfulness to get to malice.
1998.98-208,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2240.049,2241.799,"Again, my problem isn't even an intention to injure."
1998.98-208,2,39257,raymond_c_fay,,2249.005,2251.156,If it's unrelated to the sex discrimination.
1998.98-208,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2251.156,2260.181,"Well, but isn't discriminating against someone because of sex... isn't that an intent... intent to injure them?"
1998.98-208,2,39257,raymond_c_fay,,2266.325,2268.997,And that is... that is injurious.
1998.98-208,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2275.432,2278.323,But how... you say the conduct is serious enough.
1998.98-208,2,39257,raymond_c_fay,,2280.235,2307.051,"The... the classic example of... of the difference between the two... and Congress' intending to have only the more serious cases go to the jury... is that this Court, in McDonnell Douglas v. Green, and follow-up cases, has established a paradigm of proof for intentional discrimination in which there may be very little known about what the employer thinks; that pretext alone may suffice, by judicial presumptions and inferences, to get to the jury on the question of intentional discrimination."
1998.98-208,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2307.051,2311.433,"You don't suggest, Mr. Fay, that every time there's an intent to discriminate, there's also the intent to harm the individual?"
1998.98-208,2,39257,raymond_c_fay,,2326.254,2329.746,And that would also be... be true in the pretext cases.
1998.98-208,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2329.746,2330.397,Sure.
1998.98-208,2,39257,raymond_c_fay,,2330.397,2339.215,"It... it is classified as intentional discrimination, but it certainly does not carry with it any reckless indifference to their rights or malicious intent."
1998.98-208,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2339.215,2339.584,Why?
1998.98-208,2,39257,raymond_c_fay,,2340.866,2342.295,Well--
1998.98-208,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2342.295,2343.277,The pretext was a pretext.
1998.98-208,2,39257,raymond_c_fay,,2344.769,2345.808,--Because a person could be--
1998.98-208,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2345.808,2348.199,"--on the facts, discriminated intentionally."
1998.98-208,2,39257,raymond_c_fay,,2348.199,2355.003,"--Well, for example, an employer may be misguided in thinking that they need to foster affirmative action, when affirmative action might result--"
1998.98-208,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2355.003,2384.083,"If... if in fact the employer thinks that if I'm doing this intentionally, I don't know if it's illegal, I agree that then you would have, on I think what I'm taking is the opposite theory from yours, as I said, that if the employer believes that intentional discrimination is not unlawful, then punitives would not be assessable unless he should have known that it was unlawful."
1998.98-208,2,39257,raymond_c_fay,,2415.945,2417.044,--That's correct.
1998.98-208,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2419.916,2428.502,"And so... so, given the cap that's in the statute, why do we think that Congress would not have wanted them widely assessable?"
1998.98-208,2,39257,raymond_c_fay,,2428.502,2436.158,"One answer I think is that there were, as this Court is aware, many, many compromises in reaching this... this Act the second time around."
1998.98-208,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2461.313,2484.538,"I... I just want to make it clear what you're... do... do you agree that every time the employer knows, or should have known, that his official... or its official actions is a violation of the law and the employer then proceeds to take that action in any event, that there is malice or reckless disregard?"
1998.98-208,2,39257,raymond_c_fay,,2484.538,2485.619,No.
1998.98-208,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2485.619,2487.009,All right.
1998.98-208,2,39257,raymond_c_fay,,2490.572,2505.202,"If... the instances are in which there is no risk of serious physical, psychological or, in the rare instance, economic, harm to the individual."
1998.98-208,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2509.917,2511.727,Was that true in this case?
1998.98-208,2,39257,raymond_c_fay,,2511.727,2515.119,It was certainly true in this case.
1998.98-208,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2530.55,2538.504,"But wasn't... wasn't the woman, in her... in her own mind and in her own psyche, injured, disturbed, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera?"
1998.98-208,2,39257,raymond_c_fay,,2538.504,2538.805,No.
1998.98-208,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2544.378,2546.71,"If she had, the result would have been different?"
1998.98-208,2,39257,raymond_c_fay,,2546.71,2547.491,If she--
1998.98-208,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2547.491,2556.185,"If she said, you know, I really knew I was discriminated against for being a woman... woman, and it... it hurt me very, very badly, it upset me, et cetera, et cetera?"
1998.98-208,2,39257,raymond_c_fay,,2556.185,2561.278,"--If there had been inter... first of all, that would have qualified for... for compensatory damages under the statute."
1998.98-208,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2576.198,2581.741,"So... so, you capture this by instructing the jury in terms of egregious behavior?"
1998.98-208,2,39257,raymond_c_fay,,2581.741,2587.736,"I don't think you need to capture it by instructing the jury of that, because it's up to the judge to make the threshold determination."
1998.98-208,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2590.557,2594.561,"Well, then... then we capture it by putting the law of this Court, that it has to be egregious behavior?"
1998.98-208,2,39257,raymond_c_fay,,2594.561,2596.721,--Because that's what's required at the common law.
1998.98-208,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2596.721,2603.827,"And that all comes from the label ""punitive"", because the common law wasn't that way for liquidated or statutory?"
1998.98-208,2,39257,raymond_c_fay,,2603.827,2605.427,"It's more than from the label ""punitive"", Your Honor."
1998.98-208,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2620.076,2626.972,"Why did it say malice or deliberate indifference, then, if it wasn't... if it wasn't changing what... what punitive damages were at the common law?"
1998.98-208,2,39257,raymond_c_fay,,2630.364,2641.972,"--Because it was using as its reference point the case... this Court's decision in Smith v. Wade, in which malice and reckless indifference were defined as standards for punitive damages under the common law."
1998.98-208,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2667.298,2669.081,Let me just be sure about one thing.
1998.98-208,2,39257,raymond_c_fay,,2675.983,2680.707,"--I... yes, I think that its common law roots are the same, Your Honor."
1998.98-208,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2680.707,2684.51,Did Smith and... did Smith and Wade refer to indifference to rights?
1998.98-208,2,39257,raymond_c_fay,,2690.702,2691.393,That... those were the very words--
1998.98-208,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2691.393,2691.864,Yeah.
1998.98-208,2,39257,raymond_c_fay,,2691.864,2694.595,--from Smith v. Wade that were incorporated here.
1998.98-208,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2722.544,2730.499,"Let me go one step further with you, to be sure I... there was a very sharp debate in Smith against Wade as to exactly what the common law did mean."
1998.98-208,2,39257,raymond_c_fay,,2738.974,2743.499,--That's... that's the rule which explicates the common law and was carried forward in this statute.
1998.98-208,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2743.499,2744.238,"We usually do that, don't we?"
1998.98-208,2,39257,raymond_c_fay,,2745.34,2746.051,"Yes, Your Honor."
1998.98-208,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2746.051,2762.71,"Will you also clarify whether... at one point you said that malice is a synonym for reckless indifference to the federally protected rights of the aggrieved individual, and at another point you seem to suggest that those two terms had discrete meanings."
1998.98-208,2,39257,raymond_c_fay,,2768.624,2780.893,"I... certainly malice implicates the actual intent, and recklessness implicates more than negligence but less than the actual intent, in terms of looking at the mental state."
1998.98-208,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2799.006,2800.925,"So, but let's take these words written into this statute."
1998.98-208,2,39257,raymond_c_fay,,2827.683,2839.331,And my point is... is that the reckless indifference is not so radically different from the malice standard that it becomes a statutory standard whereby all cases of intentional discrimination would go to the jury.
1998.98-208,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2840.192,2852.59,"Well, we've already established that there are some cases, like good faith but wrong judgment, about the exceptions under the law, the BFOQ, when you're allowed to make a religious preference."
1998.98-208,2,39257,raymond_c_fay,,2852.59,2862.495,"--And our position on that, Your Honor, frankly, is that it's better not to establish any type of classes of cases that would be exempt from punitive damages."
1998.98-208,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2880.258,2885.99,"Well, what egregious... I mean, what do you mean by... by an... an egregious act?"
1998.98-208,2,39257,raymond_c_fay,,2899.851,2915.249,"--If you look at it in terms of... of the risk of harm that someone is put to, it... it... there can be aggravating circumstances, where someone is put into a horrible mental state because of the actions that took place with the firing."
1998.98-208,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2920.882,2921.463,"So, if--"
1998.98-208,2,39257,raymond_c_fay,,2930.129,2939.335,"--In... earlier, I answered a question, saying that the interaction between the plaintiff and the defendant might make... might show that the defendant's behavior is more serious."
1998.98-208,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2939.335,2941.539,I have it: Firing on Christmas Eve.
1998.98-208,2,39257,raymond_c_fay,,2943.438,2951.504,"Timing has been an issue in the case law, at... that is cited as one of the factors."
1998.98-208,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2951.504,2973.729,"--Well, why... why isn't intentional... intentional discrimination... you have to assume the facts show it... we intentionally dismissed someone from her... her job on the basis, let's say, of gender, because she's a woman, or of race, and I... the employer does it intentionally, for that reason, knowing that it's unlawful under the law of the United States; why isn't that egregious?"
1998.98-208,2,39257,raymond_c_fay,,2973.729,2975.77,It may... it very well may be.
1998.98-208,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2975.77,2976.861,Just in and of itself?
1998.98-208,2,39257,raymond_c_fay,,2987.698,2988.847,It very well could be.
1998.98-208,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3000.477,3000.976,Well--
1998.98-208,2,39257,raymond_c_fay,,3010.422,3010.662,Yes.
1998.98-208,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3021.158,3022.55,And it's not before... before the Court why?
1998.98-208,2,39257,raymond_c_fay,,3022.55,3032.338,"--Well, the... the question of... of the difference in standards that was referred to by Mr. Schnapper and the Solicitor General is not precisely before the Court."
1998.98-208,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3039.251,3045.764,"The question presented is, in what circumstances may punitive damages be awarded under Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act?"
1998.98-208,2,39257,raymond_c_fay,,3048.997,3058.204,"--In... in direct response to the question, the... I don't think the Petitioner or the Respondent briefed this issue at length."
1998.98-208,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3074.245,3076.226,In your answer to Justice Breyer's question--
1998.98-208,2,39257,raymond_c_fay,,3076.226,3076.947,Yes.
1998.98-208,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3076.947,3080.4,--you said there's an intentional violation; why isn't that the end of the case?
1998.98-208,2,39257,raymond_c_fay,,3080.4,3080.678,Because--
1998.98-208,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3080.678,3082.4,"You said ""It may very well be""."
1998.98-208,2,39257,raymond_c_fay,,3094.327,3094.818,--One... one way I can--
1998.98-208,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3094.818,3096.087,--but I... I want to know when it isn't.
1998.98-208,2,39257,raymond_c_fay,,3096.087,3112.768,"--One way to describe the very difference in approach between the Petitioner and the Respondent here is... is to contrast the EEOC's policy guidance, which is referred to in the government's brief, and some of the examples that the government gives that would get you to the jury on punitive damages."
1998.98-208,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3128.879,3129.64,Where are you reading from?
1998.98-208,2,39257,raymond_c_fay,,3129.64,3136.924,"--I... I'm reading from pages 11 and 12 of the government's brief, where it sets forth a list of things that would be examples to go to the jury."
1998.98-208,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3171.816,3176.08,"Well, I'm glad we don't carry over the government's resentment of Federal civil rights law into the income tax."
1998.98-208,2,39257,raymond_c_fay,,3202.748,3203.69,Yes.
1998.98-208,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3203.69,3211.533,"You... you've also said that the... that the indifference standard in the statute is... is virtually identical, or tantamount, to that kind of malice."
1998.98-208,2,39257,raymond_c_fay,,3219.668,3227.155,"In that instance, we are focusing solely on the mental state, and I think there is a difference to... his question, as I understood it, was if somebody knew darn well that they were violating the law."
1998.98-208,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3227.155,3230.818,"Well, the... Justice Breyer's question focused only on the mental state."
1998.98-208,2,39257,raymond_c_fay,,3230.818,3231.265,That's right.
1998.98-208,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3231.265,3234.227,"And... and you said, yes, that would be enough to get to the jury."
1998.98-208,2,39257,raymond_c_fay,,3234.227,3241.624,Because he was posing an example... I thought Justice Breyer was posing an example where the employer knew that there was a violation of the law.
1998.98-208,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3241.624,3242.135,That's right.
1998.98-208,2,39257,raymond_c_fay,,3242.135,3255.131,"We get into a... a different area... a little bit different area where, instead of actual knowledge of an intentional violation, someone is acting recklessly as to... as to whether or not those actions are in violation."
1998.98-208,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3255.131,3255.772,Right.
1998.98-208,2,39257,raymond_c_fay,,3255.772,3263.048,"But, again, I don't... I don't think you can take any of that into consideration without looking at the statutory framework, which says we're talking about punitive damages--"
1998.98-208,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3263.048,3269.36,"Well, I... I just... I just want to... to go further in terms of your answer to his question."
1998.98-208,2,39257,raymond_c_fay,,3291.155,3293.757,--Because both would require serious actions.
1998.98-208,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3294.848,3295.88,"Thank you, Mr. Fay."
1998.98-208,3,23226,eric_schnapper,,3297.67,3315.532,I'd like to respond to a number of the questions that have been asked by the Court by returning to the distinction I made at the outset between the statutory prerequisites and instructions that might be given to guide the discretion of the jury.
1998.98-208,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3368.396,3375.242,"But in... in the Faragher case last year, we certainly imported standards from the Restatement that weren't in the statute."
1998.98-208,3,23226,eric_schnapper,,3375.242,3379.915,"--You weren't... you weren't dealing with this specific statute, which is... is quite--"
1998.98-208,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3379.915,3388.229,"Well, we weren't dealing with the same statute, but I... I don't see why that bears on the desirability or vel non."
1998.98-208,3,23226,eric_schnapper,,3388.229,3389.0,--I--
1998.98-208,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3389.0,3400.648,"I mean, this... this statute is simply confusing to... no... no one can pretend that it's a clear guideline as to where... where a court is to go."
1998.98-208,3,23226,eric_schnapper,,3400.648,3405.091,--I think that the text of the statute does... does provide some guidance.
1998.98-208,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3405.091,3408.683,"Well, look... look at the way the Court of Appeals split on it."
1998.98-208,3,23226,eric_schnapper,,3414.198,3419.902,I don't want to characterize six members of the D.C. Court of Appeals as unreasonable.
1998.98-208,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3429.285,3433.389,"Well, but I mean, the argument made by... by your opponent is not an unreasonable one."
1998.98-208,3,23226,eric_schnapper,,3466.04,3471.333,I certainly wouldn't want to disagree with you as to whether that's plausible.
1998.98-208,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3478.078,3486.714,The question is whether they are limitations upon normal punitive damages or whether they are a re-description of what punitive damages consist of.
1998.98-208,3,23226,eric_schnapper,,3488.494,3498.131,"--Either way, I don't think the Court is... is free to add to them, and I don't think egregious conduct is a possible interpretation of... of any provision in the statute."
1998.98-208,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3498.131,3508.819,"Well, there was one brief, at least, that said, inherent in the very word ""punitive damages"" is this egregiousness notion."
1998.98-208,3,23226,eric_schnapper,,3513.572,3517.953,I... I think that that really is a stretch of the language.
1998.98-208,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3529.042,3533.855,"When the Court summarized its holding in Smith against Wade, did it use the word ""egregious""?"
1998.98-208,3,23226,eric_schnapper,,3533.855,3534.846,It did not.
1998.98-208,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3534.846,3545.922,Suppose... suppose it said compensatory damages may be awarded if there is malice or... or reckless indifference.
1998.98-208,3,23226,eric_schnapper,,3559.023,3559.503,"I would agree, Your Honor."
