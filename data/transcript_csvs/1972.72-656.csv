1972.72-656,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,15.336,"We’ll hear arguments next this morning in number 72-656, Logue against the United States."
1972.72-656,0,30088,james_deanda,,16.776,21.552,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1972.72-656,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,295.847,301.226,"Mr. DeAnda, would that be negligence in selecting the contractor basically?"
1972.72-656,0,30088,james_deanda,,301.226,301.536,"No, sir."
1972.72-656,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,431.88,461.503,"Well, is this an argument that even if the state official-- the relationship between the United States and the state jail or prison was one of independent contractor, even if it was, that under these circumstances it was negligent for the Marshal to have lodged the man there without first making certain that whatever the independent contractor did, he did to safeguard this fellow from committing-- attempting suicide again."
1972.72-656,0,30088,james_deanda,,462.676,463.208,"Yes, Your Honor."
1972.72-656,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,524.183,531.336,But did the Marshal had any choice but-- when he was released from the hospital to put him in this very jail?
1972.72-656,0,30088,james_deanda,,531.336,533.117,"Yes, he had every choice in the world."
1972.72-656,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,533.117,534.081,What could he have done?
1972.72-656,0,30088,james_deanda,,534.081,535.102,Left him in the hospital.
1972.72-656,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,553.244,557.822,"But, locally, were the choices either to leave him in the hospital or put him in this jail?"
1972.72-656,0,30088,james_deanda,,564.06,567.08,"MAs-- I do not believe he would have, Mr. Justice."
1972.72-656,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,579.873,583.653,"But there did exist a contract with this jail to take these federal prisoners, didn’t they?"
1972.72-656,0,30088,james_deanda,,583.653,586.659,"Yes, the jail did have a contract to accept federal prisoners."
1972.72-656,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,586.659,590.911,"Well, then that did rather limit the Marshal’s options, did it not?"
1972.72-656,0,30088,james_deanda,,590.911,593.363,"Well, it would limit him either to the-- well, that’s what I said."
1972.72-656,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,597.634,604.12,"Well, you’re saying that the specific conduct of this federal Marshal in these circumstances was, itself, negligent."
1972.72-656,0,30088,james_deanda,,604.12,607.068,"Yes, Mr. Justice, in taking in not--"
1972.72-656,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,607.068,615.996,And this could be true even if the conduct of the jailer that he-- into whose custody he delivered the man was not negligent.
1972.72-656,0,30088,james_deanda,,615.996,617.731,This would be true.
1972.72-656,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,617.731,618.976,And is it true in this case?
1972.72-656,0,30088,james_deanda,,618.976,625.32,"No, it is not, because-- the reason it is not, well, this Trial Court found that it wasn’t."
1972.72-656,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,630.449,635.838,But absent this conduct of this particular federal Marshal.
1972.72-656,0,30088,james_deanda,,643.711,668.39,"Yes, that would be my second position, Mr. Justice, that, here-- this is I think what we’re talking about non-delegable duties which I haven’t discussed yet but, in other words, it’s our position that the statute places a mandatory duty on the Marshal to safely keep his prisoner and that he cannot delegate that responsibility--"
1972.72-656,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,668.39,676.17,But you don’t need to get to that if the Marshal’s duty-- Marshal’s specific conduct here was negligent in itself.
1972.72-656,0,30088,james_deanda,,676.17,696.741,"That, I believe, that’s correct, Mr. Justice, that you would not necessarily reach that point if we were correct in what I’ve said here that the-- and the Trial Court did find-- the Trial Court found that the Marshal--"
1972.72-656,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,696.741,697.629,Himself was negligent.
1972.72-656,0,30088,james_deanda,,697.629,704.432,Himself was negligent in not making arrangements for constant surveillance of the man.
1972.72-656,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,704.432,711.016,What did the District Court find with respect to the Marshal’s decision to move in from the hospital to the local jail?
1972.72-656,0,30088,james_deanda,,711.016,717.191,"The Court found that that was a discretionary function and we did not appeal from that finding, Your Honor."
1972.72-656,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,717.191,721.745,A discretionary function for which there could be no liability on the part of the United States.
1972.72-656,0,30088,james_deanda,,721.745,724.771,Under the Tort Claims Act.
1972.72-656,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,780.8,801.579,"Do you think that absent of some affirmative conduct by the Marshal involve your two positions that really run together, that the marshals of the United States nor the marshals could do his duty unless it participated in a custody of this prisoner after he was delivered to this jail?"
1972.72-656,0,30088,james_deanda,,801.579,819.388,"Well, it is our position, Your Honor, that under the contract and under the practices that were followed, as reflected by this record, that the Marshal did have a great deal to say with reference to the keeping of the man in the conditions under which he was kept."
1972.72-656,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,819.388,827.648,"Mr. DeAnda, I’d rather understood your alternative position to be this."
1972.72-656,0,30088,james_deanda,,873.647,874.272,Your Honor--
1972.72-656,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,874.272,881.882,To a situation where he had no control to—over the proper kind of surveillance that the man was going to be given.
1972.72-656,0,30088,james_deanda,,881.882,895.758,"Your Honor, the Circuit Court points out that the Marshal had no authority over the internal operations of the jail and, in the ordinary case, certainly that is true."
1972.72-656,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,895.758,903.224,"And if that’s true, then it wasn’t negligence, in your submission, for him to turn him over to a jail where he had no control over what was going to happen inside of it."
1972.72-656,0,30088,james_deanda,,903.224,917.735,"Yes, it’s my position, Your Honor, that he did have a duty, knowing the mass propensity for suicide that he could not just take him over and turn him over to someone."
1972.72-656,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1021.948,1030.387,"So he was-- if he did have the power to make arrangements, he was negligent on your submission in not making the proper arrangements, and that’s what the District Court found."
1972.72-656,0,30088,james_deanda,,1030.387,1030.582,"Yes, sir."
1972.72-656,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1030.582,1046.262,"If on the other hand, as the Court of Appeals found, he did not have any power to influence what arrangements were made inside the jail, then he was negligent in putting this man, knowing his condition and his propensity to commit suicide, into that jail which he had no power to control."
1972.72-656,0,30088,james_deanda,,1047.602,1048.309,"Mr. Justice, that’s what--"
1972.72-656,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1048.309,1050.573,At least on this branch of the case as to other branches.
1972.72-656,0,30088,james_deanda,,1050.573,1052.368,"That would be a way of putting it. Yes, sir."
1972.72-656,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1052.368,1060.188,Isn’t your answer to the second question another way of stating a non-delegable duty?
1972.72-656,0,30088,james_deanda,,1060.188,1090.006,"The non-delegable phase of it comes in, Mr. Justice, when you have a situation, and I believe Judge Brown pointed that in his decision-- in his opinion, excuse me, where the Marshal has a specific statutory duty and he has a set of circumstances that he recognizes to be ultra dangerous, unusual."
1972.72-656,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1151.544,1174.424,"Mr. DeAnda, what does your position leave of the statute, Section 2671 which reads, with some omissions, as used in this chapter, as used in this Title, the term “federal agency” does not include any contractor with the United States."
1972.72-656,0,30088,james_deanda,,1174.424,1175.094,Your Honor--
1972.72-656,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1175.094,1177.348,"It doesn’t leave very much of it, does it?"
1972.72-656,0,30088,james_deanda,,1177.348,1184.719,"Well, Your Honor, if it were not a-- if it were a-- if it were not a non-delegable duty, Mr. Chief Justice."
1972.72-656,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1184.719,1191.912,"Where does the statute speak about the non-delegable duties, what section?"
1972.72-656,0,30088,james_deanda,,1191.912,1206.555,"Your Honor, there’s nothing in the statute that speaks of non-delegable duties anymore than there’s anything in that statute that says the Marshal’s duty is to safely keep the prisoner."
1972.72-656,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1219.906,1227.372,What would be the situation if he had-- this man had committed suicide while in the hospital?
1972.72-656,0,30088,james_deanda,,1231.593,1232.812,"No, Your Honor."
1972.72-656,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1266.914,1277.616,"That is, for example, if they had put him in the hospital and just drop the matter there, then you might argue that that would be negligence in it of itself."
1972.72-656,0,30088,james_deanda,,1277.616,1284.618,"No, I don’t believe there’s any absolute-- there’s no assu-- the government is not an insurer of that man’s safety."
1972.72-656,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1316.292,1323.785,What is your argument situation in Texas so far as a lawsuit against the county is concerned?
1972.72-656,0,30088,james_deanda,,1323.785,1335.769,"Your Honor, we have-- Texas has passed a Tort Claims Act, but it does not encompass within it assurance."
1972.72-656,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1460.591,1468.554,I’m interested in your comment about the government’s suggestion as between Deputy Bowers and Deputy Jones?
1972.72-656,0,30088,james_deanda,,1483.415,1487.398,"Your Honor, the-- both of these men are marshals."
1972.72-656,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1584.874,1587.598,Does the record show how he committed suicide?
1972.72-656,0,30088,james_deanda,,1587.598,1589.069,He hung himself.
1972.72-656,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1604.082,1605.673,He used the bandage?
1972.72-656,0,30088,james_deanda,,1605.673,1606.213,I beg your pardon?
1972.72-656,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1606.213,1607.311,Did he use the bandage?
1972.72-656,0,30088,james_deanda,,1607.311,1609.377,"Yes, he used the bandage."
1972.72-656,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1627.552,1628.739,"The Kerlix bandage, whatever that means."
1972.72-656,0,30088,james_deanda,,1628.739,1632.044,"Kerlix, it was a long-- it was a very long bandage."
1972.72-656,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1653.1,1656.507,Of course suicides take place in hospitals too.
1972.72-656,0,30088,james_deanda,,1656.507,1657.127,Well--
1972.72-656,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1657.127,1662.608,I take it you’re not pinning your case on the removal to the jail.
1972.72-656,0,30088,james_deanda,,1666.473,1667.109,"Yes, Your Honor."
1972.72-656,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1710.534,1714.659,Very well.
1972.72-656,1,35781,mark_l_evans,,1722.197,1724.949,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1972.72-656,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1811.838,1812.975,"What page are you on, Mr. Evans?"
1972.72-656,1,35781,mark_l_evans,,1812.975,1818.373,This is page 608 and 609 of Volume 2.
1972.72-656,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1864.076,1872.048,Do you think there would have been a duty to-- for the federal government to have made some arrangements when they delivered the prisoner to the jail?
1972.72-656,1,35781,mark_l_evans,,1872.048,1881.23,"I think that knowing that a man is eminently suicidal as they did here, that they had a duty to take precautions to ensure that he did not commit suicide while he was in the jail."
1972.72-656,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1881.23,1887.374,"Yes, and they had at least a duty to stay in that to the contractee."
1972.72-656,1,35781,mark_l_evans,,1887.374,1888.248,That’s right.
1972.72-656,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1888.248,1900.817,"If you’re saying that having a contractee insulates the United States from liability to the contractee, you are not saying that the United States must not tell a contractee what his duty is."
1972.72-656,1,35781,mark_l_evans,,1900.817,1902.951,That’s right.
1972.72-656,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1902.951,1907.523,There’s no question the Marshall knew he had this bandage.
1972.72-656,1,35781,mark_l_evans,,1907.523,1912.241,It is not clear from the record whether the Marshall was aware of the type of bandage that have been placed on the man’s arm.
1972.72-656,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1912.241,1913.625,But didn’t he see it?
1972.72-656,1,35781,mark_l_evans,,1913.625,1915.492,"Well, he saw it but the bandage--"
1972.72-656,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1915.492,1916.422,So he saw the bandage.
1972.72-656,1,35781,mark_l_evans,,1916.422,1923.677,"It could’ve been, so far as it can be told from the record that it wasn’t clear whether it was a gauze with tape or whether it was a wraparound bandage, as in fact it was."
1972.72-656,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1923.677,1925.367,He did see that it was a bandage.
1972.72-656,1,35781,mark_l_evans,,1925.367,1926.643,"He knew that it was a bandage on the arm, yes."
1972.72-656,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1926.643,1928.508,And he saw the room he was put in?
1972.72-656,1,35781,mark_l_evans,,1928.508,1929.54,"Yes, he did."
1972.72-656,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1929.54,1931.093,And there’s no question about that?
1972.72-656,1,35781,mark_l_evans,,1931.093,1934.654,That’s right.
1972.72-656,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1934.654,1935.027,"Well, Mr.--"
1972.72-656,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1935.027,1938.226,And the question that he could’ve left him in the hospital?
1972.72-656,1,35781,mark_l_evans,,1938.226,1939.564,He could’ve left him in the hospital.
1972.72-656,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1958.126,1960.772,The record show that he was in the hospital.
1972.72-656,1,35781,mark_l_evans,,1960.772,1962.311,That’s right.
1972.72-656,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1962.311,1964.756,Being treated for a mental disorder?
1972.72-656,1,35781,mark_l_evans,,1964.756,1965.138,"No, sir."
1972.72-656,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1971.839,1973.416,He was under medication.
1972.72-656,1,35781,mark_l_evans,,1973.416,1976.605,He was under-- he had been given a tranquilizer at the time of his admission.
1972.72-656,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1976.605,1978.658,Because he was suicidal.
1972.72-656,1,35781,mark_l_evans,,1978.658,1980.37,Because he was psychotic.
1972.72-656,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1980.37,1981.805,Because he was psychotic.
1972.72-656,1,35781,mark_l_evans,,1981.805,1982.579,"Yes, sir."
1972.72-656,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1982.579,1986.346,"And he was going to be transferred to Springfield, right?"
1972.72-656,1,35781,mark_l_evans,,1986.346,1987.948,That’s right.
1972.72-656,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1987.948,1989.332,"Which, is another hospital."
1972.72-656,1,35781,mark_l_evans,,1989.332,1990.285,That’s right.
1972.72-656,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1990.285,1994.281,"And so, what the Marshal did was in between."
1972.72-656,1,35781,mark_l_evans,,1998.704,1999.664,"Well, the--"
1972.72-656,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1999.664,2000.071,Is that right?
1972.72-656,1,35781,mark_l_evans,,2000.071,2000.464,That’s right.
1972.72-656,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2001.387,2002.923,Does that make sense at all?
1972.72-656,1,35781,mark_l_evans,,2002.923,2005.348,"In the context of this case, it does."
1972.72-656,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2062.38,2071.134,Was there any coordination of the marshals giving him the necessary protection in the hospital?

1972.72-656,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2113.617,2118.108,The primary responsibility was to make sure he was held and not his health.

1972.72-656,1,35781,mark_l_evans,,2141.833,2144.19,There’s no other need for him to be in the hospital.
1972.72-656,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2144.19,2161.167,"Didn’t the District Court review all that and hold, in effect, made a finding and a conclusion that even if it was a mistake in judgment, it was a mistake in judgment under the discretionary provisions if the Federal Tort Claims Act for which there could be no liability?"
1972.72-656,1,35781,mark_l_evans,,2161.167,2162.04,"That’s exactly right, Mr. Chief Justice."
1972.72-656,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2162.04,2167.551,And I understand Mr. Dandridge to concede that that’s out of the case because he did not file a cross-petition.
1972.72-656,1,35781,mark_l_evans,,2167.551,2170.147,I understood him to say the same thing.
1972.72-656,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2170.147,2172.228,Exactly what?
1972.72-656,1,35781,mark_l_evans,,2172.228,2173.498,That leads only to--
1972.72-656,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2173.498,2181.247,"That, by doing so, the Marshal took on the additional responsibility of seeing that the man did not commit suicide."
1972.72-656,1,35781,mark_l_evans,,2181.247,2188.786,"That’s right and, as I was suggesting before, I think that the marshals did undertake that duty and did satisfy it."
1972.72-656,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2261.041,2262.065,"Let me understand it, Mr. Evans."
1972.72-656,1,35781,mark_l_evans,,2262.065,2262.388,Yes?
1972.72-656,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2262.388,2269.381,Is that a set of facts subject of any finding of the District Judge?
1972.72-656,1,35781,mark_l_evans,,2269.381,2270.203,"No, sir."
1972.72-656,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2270.379,2272.4,"Well, is that important?"
1972.72-656,1,35781,mark_l_evans,,2272.4,2277.852,"Well, it’s important only in the sense that he did not resolve those facts against us, as Mr. DeAnda suggested."
1972.72-656,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2277.852,2289.08,"Yes, but he did find that there was no specific arrangement made by Bowers with respect to certain things, and you’re saying that if there was a deficiency that was made up by Jones, but we haven’t any findings about that."
1972.72-656,1,35781,mark_l_evans,,2289.08,2294.092,"Well this, in our view, is in the essence of what the Court of Appeals’ holding was."
1972.72-656,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2316.136,2324.24,"Your position, I take it, is that this, being a non-jury case, the Court of Appeals was in as good a position as the District Court to make a finding on that subject?"
1972.72-656,1,35781,mark_l_evans,,2324.24,2326.218,I think that’s a reasonable interpretation.
1972.72-656,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2326.218,2327.999,"I don’t follow this, Mr. Evans."
1972.72-656,1,35781,mark_l_evans,,2337.002,2337.958,That’s right.
1972.72-656,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2337.958,2347.486,"Now-- and you now say that, what, as to the telephone conversation between the jailer and Jones?"

1972.72-656,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2356.186,2358.936,What’s the significance of his being supervisor?
1972.72-656,1,35781,mark_l_evans,,2358.936,2362.2,"Well, I’m just relating him as what his function was in the operation."

1972.72-656,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2373.782,2381.571,"But, you would-- you don’t concede then that-- you don’t concede that whatever it was that Bowers did by himself was negligent?"
1972.72-656,1,35781,mark_l_evans,,2381.571,2382.111,"Well, the reason that--"

1972.72-656,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2417.827,2423.266,That everything that Jones did satisfy any duty and no matter what Bowers did was immaterial.

1972.72-656,1,35781,mark_l_evans,,2461.594,2462.04,That’s right.
1972.72-656,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2462.757,2464.91,Even though the District Court found that he was?

1972.72-656,1,35781,mark_l_evans,,2492.727,2496.333,I don’t believe any of the marshals themselves were made part of it.

1972.72-656,1,35781,mark_l_evans,,2516.522,2517.573,That’s correct.
1972.72-656,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2517.573,2522.761,"If the supervisor had been sued, would you defend him?"
1972.72-656,1,35781,mark_l_evans,,2522.761,2531.377,"Certainly, because in the circumstances of this case, the supervisor made the necessary arrangements with the jailer of the county jail."

1972.72-656,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2630.04,2632.17,Was that evidence disputed anywhere?
1972.72-656,1,35781,mark_l_evans,,2632.17,2638.442,The only dispute was that the Chief Jailer of the Nueces County Jail testified.
