2014.13-553,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.27,"We'll hear argument next in Case No. 13-553, the Alabama Department of Revenue v. CSX Transportation."
2014.13-553,0,56097,andrew_l_brasher,,8.72,11.672,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2014.13-553,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,41.872,51.144,"Well, is said that -- it said that in -- in (b)(1), and it doesn't say that in (b)(4)."
2014.13-553,0,56097,andrew_l_brasher,,51.144,53.513,Right.
2014.13-553,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,54.263,59.75,"Another tax that discriminates is all it says, whereas in (1) it said “ as R value ” --"
2014.13-553,0,56097,andrew_l_brasher,,66.92,68.355,--Well--
2014.13-553,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,68.355,75.093,They're so specific there and -- and in (4) they just say another tax that discriminates against the rail carrier.
2014.13-553,0,56097,andrew_l_brasher,,75.093,84.815,"--But I think the question is whether there's any reason to read (b)(4) to require a comparison class that is different than the one in (b) -- (b)(1), (b)(2), and (b)(3)."
2014.13-553,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,84.815,85.051,Yeah.
2014.13-553,0,56097,andrew_l_brasher,,91.038,107.064,"Well, I don't think that -- that is a sufficient reason because I think that the comparison class that is spelled out in (b)(1), (b)(2), and (b)(3), if you apply it in (b)(4), it ensures that railroads are being treated fairly by tying them to a broad enough mass of politically influential taxpayers to keep their rates fair."
2014.13-553,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,125.126,153.293,"But, General, I think on -- on this question, CSX 1, I think your reasoning flies straight into the face of it, because CSX 1 talks about the notion that (1) through (3) is very different from (4) and that you can't -- this is just along the lines of what Justice Scalia says -- that you can't draw anything about the meaning of (4) from (1) through (3) given that they clearly -- they use different language, they're directed towards different things."
2014.13-553,0,56097,andrew_l_brasher,,153.293,163.834,"Well, I think -- I think the question here is -- is whether you should be looking at general businesses or whether you should be looking at CSX's handpicked class of competitors."
2014.13-553,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,169.055,171.338,"Well, why -- why do you say handpicked?"
2014.13-553,0,56097,andrew_l_brasher,,178.761,192.351,"--Well, because in this particular situation, CSX is comparing itself to motor carriers and water carriers, but is not comparing itself to, for example, airlines or pipelines, which also compete with respect to CSX in transportation."
2014.13-553,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,204.142,207.278,"Well, if they're not similarly situated, then the railroad loses."
2014.13-553,0,56097,andrew_l_brasher,,207.278,208.38,That's right.
2014.13-553,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,210.23,213.965,But that's a different question than saying what class they should be compared to.
2014.13-553,0,56097,andrew_l_brasher,,213.965,214.7,--I don't think so.
2014.13-553,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,225.323,245.903,"But, you see, when you say “ similarly situated ”, and I think that's right, but that seems to go to your second argument, which is, look, they're not similarly situated because there's another tax that falls upon motor carriers that doesn't fall upon railroads, and that seems to me completely fair and -- but -- but not on the first question."
2014.13-553,0,56097,andrew_l_brasher,,245.903,252.99,"Well, let me -- let me explain briefly on how I think it does go to the first question, which is that we're talking about a sales and use tax, which is a tax on a transaction."
2014.13-553,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,274.836,283.092,"But the problem is that, generally, one thinks of sales and use taxes as flip sides of each other."
2014.13-553,0,56097,andrew_l_brasher,,306.292,306.792,Right.
2014.13-553,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,325.688,330.673,The circuit below said that was fortuitous and that at some point that could change.
2014.13-553,0,56097,andrew_l_brasher,,330.673,337.161,"Well, I'm saying that as a practical matter, they're -- they're the taxes that are paid by these entities on diesel."
2014.13-553,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,345.933,362.394,"On the -- on the comparator issue, suppose that railroads and trucks used exactly the same fuel all the time, no difference whatsoever, and suppose that Alabama taxed the fuel purchased by the railroads but not by the trucks."
2014.13-553,0,56097,andrew_l_brasher,,363.778,373.169,"Our position would be that, no, there would not be a violation on the comparison class issue as long as the general mass of businesses are still paying the same tax rate."
2014.13-553,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,380.856,383.458,Do you think that result is consistent with the purpose of this statute?
2014.13-553,0,56097,andrew_l_brasher,,383.458,384.258,Yes.
2014.13-553,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,409.359,413.577,"No, but they wanted to prop up -- they wanted to support the rail industry in a number of ways."
2014.13-553,0,56097,andrew_l_brasher,,427.321,427.754,--Well--
2014.13-553,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,427.754,439.128,"And their -- that's -- their economic viability depends upon how they're faring with respect to their competitors, not how they're, you know, faring with respect to, you know, an agricultural conglomerate in the State."
2014.13-553,0,56097,andrew_l_brasher,,439.128,442.346,"--Well, ultimately, railroads are competing against other railroads."
2014.13-553,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,442.946,443.412,"Well, no."
2014.13-553,0,56097,andrew_l_brasher,,444.729,453.416,"--Well -- well, I think -- I think there's some -- to a certain extent that they do compete, but to a certain extent they're also complementary forms of transportation."
2014.13-553,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,459.237,463.207,You really -- you want -- you -- you want us to write an opinion to say railroads generally do not compete with trucking companies?
2014.13-553,0,56097,andrew_l_brasher,,465.975,466.375,No.
2014.13-553,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,477.55,477.966,"Well, then fine."
2014.13-553,0,56097,andrew_l_brasher,,531.851,538.772,"--Well, the why is because I think the goal should be here to create some kind of balance that actually gives enough ex ante guidance--"
2014.13-553,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,538.772,541.057,"Well, what about my case, then, when you say balance, et cetera?"
2014.13-553,0,56097,andrew_l_brasher,,541.524,545.009,"--Well, I think -- I think ultimately, the railroads would probably win that case."
2014.13-553,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,545.009,549.829,"Because we look at all the tax, all the things, everybody pays 8 percent."
2014.13-553,0,56097,andrew_l_brasher,,550.812,551.248,"Oh, no."
2014.13-553,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,552.581,553.681,But railroads.
2014.13-553,0,56097,andrew_l_brasher,,553.681,555.949,--If there was a special tax on kerosene and--
2014.13-553,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,555.949,556.316,Yeah.
2014.13-553,0,56097,andrew_l_brasher,,556.316,559.418,"--and the only two entities that -- I mean, that -- that's -- for example, there's a -- there's a case--"
2014.13-553,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,559.418,559.668,All right.
2014.13-553,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,564.003,566.255,"Mr. Brasher, what -- what's an ice cream wagon anyway?"
2014.13-553,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,567.507,571.976,--It's -- it's a wagon that uses kerosene to deliver ice cream.
2014.13-553,0,56097,andrew_l_brasher,,571.976,585.802,"--But I think -- I think the main point here is that there are lots of businesses in Alabama that are paying the sales tax on the items that they need for their business, and there are also lots of businesses that are paying the sales tax on the diesel fuel when they need diesel fuel for their businesses."
2014.13-553,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,596.358,605.464,"On the question of diesel fuel, I -- I got the impression -- this just an informational question -- but I got the impression from briefs that diesel fuel is diesel fuel except some of it is dyed."
2014.13-553,0,56097,andrew_l_brasher,,619.456,622.241,It's my understanding that they are chemically the same.
2014.13-553,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,678.162,693.522,"General, one of the things that Mr. Phillips talks about is he -- he makes the point that this is a very hard inquiry to carry out and that the experience of courts, when they try to do this in commerce cases, shows that."
2014.13-553,0,56097,andrew_l_brasher,,695.19,708.447,"Well, the -- the inquiry that we're asking the Court to perform is not difficult at all, and the district court performed it in one paragraph of its decision, which is you simply compare the taxes that we are imposing on diesel fuel for the truckers versus the taxes that the railroads are paying on the same item."
2014.13-553,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,745.039,752.043,You're -- you -- are you representing on the behalf of the State that the railroads could pay the motor vehicle tax--
2014.13-553,0,56097,andrew_l_brasher,,752.043,752.293,--Yes.
2014.13-553,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,752.293,752.893,--if they chose?
2014.13-553,0,56097,andrew_l_brasher,,752.893,753.309,Yes.
2014.13-553,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,762.315,763.517,They use the same type of diesel?
2014.13-553,0,56097,andrew_l_brasher,,763.517,770.688,"The truckers use clear diesel, which is chemically identified -- identical to the dyed diesel that the railroads use."
2014.13-553,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,770.688,771.471,Can they use--
2014.13-553,0,56097,andrew_l_brasher,,771.471,772.34,"Oh, I'm sorry."
2014.13-553,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,772.34,777.425,"--according to -- in Federal law, can the railroads use the undyed--"
2014.13-553,0,56097,andrew_l_brasher,,777.425,779.36,"As far as I'm aware, there is no prohibition under Federal law."
2014.13-553,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,783.414,785.247,But the truckers can't use the dyed fuel.
2014.13-553,0,56097,andrew_l_brasher,,785.247,785.78,That's correct.
2014.13-553,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,785.78,786.366,Why -- why is that?
2014.13-553,0,56097,andrew_l_brasher,,786.366,792.184,"Well, it's because -- it's because the tax on the clear diesel is higher than the tax on the dyed diesel."
2014.13-553,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,792.184,795.722,"So that would be why they might not want to, but why--"
2014.13-553,0,56097,andrew_l_brasher,,795.722,796.005,No.
2014.13-553,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,801.209,801.959,--It's not for environmental reasons?
2014.13-553,0,56097,andrew_l_brasher,,802.692,803.759,--I don't think so.
2014.13-553,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,828.543,830.459,"--Now, talk about the water carriers."
2014.13-553,0,56097,andrew_l_brasher,,830.459,831.078,Right.
2014.13-553,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,831.078,838.315,"Are you going to suggest that if they stop at a dock and eat a meal, they can't be charged a sales tax?"
2014.13-553,0,56097,andrew_l_brasher,,838.315,855.111,"Well, I think the district court said two things about water carriers and neither one makes sense, which is that the railroads didn't show any practical disadvantage with respect to water carriers because the only evidence in the record with respect to water carriers is that they make up 1 percent of the market for shipping goods from one part of Alabama to another."
2014.13-553,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,891.45,895.838,"Well, there is a practical disadvantage; they paid a tax that the water carriers haven't--"
2014.13-553,0,56097,andrew_l_brasher,,895.838,896.604,--Well--
2014.13-553,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,896.604,900.14,--and it makes the water carriers more competitive against them.
2014.13-553,0,56097,andrew_l_brasher,,900.14,906.643,"--Well, and my point, I think the district court was right to say, well, they're only 1 percent of the market for moving goods from one part of the--"
2014.13-553,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,906.643,914.149,"Well, but under your argument then, you could give tax exemptions to many businesses and then those businesses would grow and give more goods to the railroads."
2014.13-553,0,56097,andrew_l_brasher,,915.549,924.355,"--Well, I think -- I think -- my point being is that if the only evidence is what the railroads put into the record here, the district court doesn't have to assume that they're going to be practically disadvantaged."
2014.13-553,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,945.101,949.405,"Well, why doesn't Alabama tax the fuel purchased by the water -- water carriers?"
2014.13-553,0,56097,andrew_l_brasher,,957.242,958.011,Yes.
2014.13-553,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,994.849,999.069,You -- you tax the water carriers when they move within Alabama?
2014.13-553,0,56097,andrew_l_brasher,,999.069,1001.771,We tax intrastate shipments.
2014.13-553,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1005.823,1018.648,"How is that -- how is that consistent with the statute admitting Alabama to the Union, which says the water -- the first time -- the water will remain -- forever remain public highways without any tax, duty, impost or toll?"
2014.13-553,0,56097,andrew_l_brasher,,1018.648,1021.85,"Well, fortunately, we haven't had that litigation, but--"
2014.13-553,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1037.361,1048.684,"You think that when we send it back, if we did and you won, that suppose you win on the ground that there is no fixed group, it depends on the case who you compare them with."
2014.13-553,0,56097,andrew_l_brasher,,1097.25,1099.869,"Well, I think the district court already addressed that."
2014.13-553,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1139.927,1144.748,And the trucker tax is not directed to highways exclusively?
2014.13-553,0,56097,andrew_l_brasher,,1146.098,1152.319,"--No, the -- the fuel tax that the truckers are paying is set aside for highway construction, highway maintenance."
2014.13-553,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1213.392,1214.394,"Thank you, counsel."
2014.13-553,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,1228.986,1232.455,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2014.13-553,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1341.077,1347.664,"Ms. Goldenberg, could I ask, you know, in one set of cases maybe a railroad is saying we're being singled out."
2014.13-553,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,1368.827,1371.443,"As far as I'm aware, there is not."
2014.13-553,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1503.612,1505.98,Could I ask you about the second point?
2014.13-553,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,1546.889,1547.574,I think--
2014.13-553,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1547.574,1549.857,Why is it a manageable comparison to make?
2014.13-553,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,1549.857,1557.597,--I think with respect to both of them there are -- I can explain why I think the taxes are comparable despite the arguments that have been raised.
2014.13-553,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1584.43,1589.734,Although I do think that might make one of Mr. Phillips' point is that maybe those cases don't fill one with confidence.
2014.13-553,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,1589.734,1598.257,"Well, I think there is a long history, particularly in the dormant commerce clause area, of the Court looking to alternative and comparable taxes."
2014.13-553,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1609.965,1612.749,"Well, you say it's doable, so can you address--"
2014.13-553,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,1612.749,1613.349,Yes.
2014.13-553,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1613.349,1614.533,--any of the points that I mentioned?
2014.13-553,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,1630.561,1632.361,I'm happy to talk about each of those.
2014.13-553,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1654.76,1655.176,"Well, wait a minute, wait a minute."
2014.13-553,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,1697.937,1700.139,"--Well, I don't think you have to take it into account."
2014.13-553,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1703.691,1704.007,Because?
2014.13-553,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,1704.007,1715.649,--the tax and the tax burden because of the language of (b)(4) and also because otherwise you would end up in a very bizarre situation where you could have a unitary tax that fell on motor carriers and railroads equally.
2014.13-553,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1772.135,1777.722,"What about the second part, that it -- does it make a difference taxes on use as opposed to taxes on sales?"
2014.13-553,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,1777.722,1782.793,I don't think it makes a difference that one is on use and one is on sale.
2014.13-553,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1829.756,1831.739,What about water carriers?
2014.13-553,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,1833.225,1834.575,--Certainly.
2014.13-553,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1861.559,1869.331,"Do you think that -- that the ruling, the district court's ruling on the comparability of the taxes is also dubious?"
2014.13-553,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,1869.331,1870.833,The district court's ruling on--
2014.13-553,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1870.833,1875.818,The district court found that these were complementary or--
2014.13-553,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,1875.818,1876.085,--No.
2014.13-553,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1883.491,1884.791,"Thank you, counsel."
2014.13-553,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1890.645,1893.014,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2014.13-553,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1923.383,1924.135,Why do you bother?
2014.13-553,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1930.622,1956.02,"--Well, I mean, there -- there are ways of doing business, but we also are entitled to the protections under the 4-R Act which is designed, candidly, to ensure that our financial stability which means that we ought to always be in a position where we can approach all of our business decisions in the most efficient way and hopefully put ourselves in a position in order to compete against the motor carriers and the -- and the water carriers."
2014.13-553,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2026.484,2030.504,"Well, just on the comparison class, can't you let the water carriers go?"
2014.13-553,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2041.626,2047.197,"--I -- I won't take that last comment personally, Mr. Chief Justice."
2014.13-553,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2101.517,2104.119,"So if there's one water carrier, you win?"
2014.13-553,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2108.505,2108.755,I -- I--
2014.13-553,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2108.755,2110.539,That sounds like most-favored nation to me.
2014.13-553,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2110.539,2112.689,"--No, but that's not -- that's not the way the case comes here."
2014.13-553,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2125.366,2125.882,The district court--
2014.13-553,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2125.882,2126.666,--they have 1 percent.
2014.13-553,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2126.666,2136.172,"--The district court appeared in its opinion -- and I -- and I may be wrong -- to say that you, in fact, had not proven that they were really competitors."
2014.13-553,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2140.309,2140.809,Right.
2014.13-553,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2140.809,2147.396,"And that's what I took it to be saying, that you hadn't shown that they really do take resources away from you."
2014.13-553,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2147.396,2150.098,"Well, first of all, that's inconsistent with the stipulation."
2014.13-553,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2285.62,2289.088,I'm -- I'm just not moved by the purpose part for the following reason.
2014.13-553,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2325.763,2330.665,"--But, Justice Sotomayor, I think it's a more -- it should be a more nuanced analysis than that."
2014.13-553,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2448.258,2450.86,"Now, just to get back to them, it's 1 percent and 6 percent of what?"
2014.13-553,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2450.86,2452.479,Of the interstate business.
2014.13-553,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2452.479,2453.695,Interstate business.
2014.13-553,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2453.695,2462.934,Did -- did the court of appeals deal with your point you just made about the -- a special purpose of the extra tax that the truckers pay?
2014.13-553,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2462.934,2466.469,Not in -- not in precisely those terms.
2014.13-553,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2466.469,2472.456,What I'm trying to figure out is -- is how are they supposed to conduct this comparison analysis?
2014.13-553,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2472.456,2473.358,"Well, that -- no, but that is exactly--"
2014.13-553,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2473.358,2474.258,What they did is they didn't do it.
2014.13-553,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2474.258,2474.558,"--No, no."
2014.13-553,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2476.327,2476.694,Right.
2014.13-553,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2476.694,2487.985,"--is that once you open that box and get into the business, all other kinds of things that Professor Hellerstein tells you you have to look at, the inquiry becomes limitless and that the carrier--"
2014.13-553,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2487.985,2488.218,"Well, fine."
2014.13-553,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2511.933,2525.341,"--Well, what I would say is, when you know that the taxes are not mutually exclusive proxies, I mean, the question is -- I don't think this Court is going to have any -- any ability to sort of sit down here and try to come up with a set of standards of comparability."
2014.13-553,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2560.598,2562.033,Of course it isn't.
2014.13-553,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2565.152,2565.752,"Well, even if I--"
2014.13-553,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2565.752,2567.67,--What's worry -- what's worrying me is--
2014.13-553,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2567.67,2569.204,--For an academic I would say the same thing.
2014.13-553,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2569.204,2595.604,"--you know, but it's not -- it's -- State taxes are so complex and -- and that they didn't even have a -- they didn't really have a chance -- they could have, but they didn't, go into the what is this extra tax the truckers pay, is it comparable, and that's a good reason for having them pay less sales tax, or does it really have nothing to do with the price of anything and, therefore, it's a bad reason and, therefore, you win."
2014.13-553,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2604.527,2604.943,Well--
2014.13-553,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2604.943,2611.214,"We're going to have to tell them just what to do, which that sounds worse to me, and -- and, moreover, it may come back here again."
2014.13-553,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2611.214,2615.501,--We can -- we can -- I understand all that.
2014.13-553,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2640.05,2640.616,How do we do that?
2014.13-553,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2663.065,2663.815,But--
2014.13-553,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2663.815,2665.848,--It didn't quite say what you said.
2014.13-553,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2665.848,2676.123,"--No, but I -- I think, one, the Court can certainly recognize that what I said is precisely part of the problem that comes out of the comparability analysis."
2014.13-553,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2678.658,2684.644,"Now -- now you want a really broad rule that says you've got to -- you've got to use the same label on every tax, States."
2014.13-553,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2688.78,2689.313,"--Well, it's the same tax."
2014.13-553,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2690.632,2691.015,Well--
2014.13-553,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2691.015,2693.115,"At the end of the day, that is the rule I'm hoping for."
2014.13-553,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2693.115,2696.369,"--If they -- if they had done a mirror excise tax, you would have been happy?"
2014.13-553,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2696.369,2699.136,"I -- yes, I would not have a complaint on that score."
2014.13-553,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2702.606,2703.79,But that's a still comparability issue.
2014.13-553,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2703.79,2704.59,--Right.
2014.13-553,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2704.59,2705.308,We've always said--
2014.13-553,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2705.308,2707.825,But it's a single compare -- comparability issue.
2014.13-553,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2727.488,2727.805,--All right.
2014.13-553,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2738.363,2747.052,"Well, that's because the reasons they were given were completely -- well, the -- the concurring -- the concurring Judge Cox did."
2014.13-553,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2805.006,2805.272,Yes.
2014.13-553,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2818.581,2822.383,--Because it didn't -- it didn't take into account the rest of the analysis.
2014.13-553,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2832.575,2845.233,"But it also said that if you don't engage in that kind of comparison, then you're going to end up with the railroad becoming the most favored taxpayer."
2014.13-553,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2845.233,2848.1,"But that's just a conclusion, and it's not -- it's not true."
2014.13-553,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2884.208,2886.142,Is--
2014.13-553,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2886.142,2897.7,"I might have -- I might have missed it, but why isn't it a sufficient justification for different treatment of the water carriers that the statute admitting Alabama to the union said they couldn't tax traffic on the river?"
2014.13-553,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2897.7,2903.937,"Well, I think because the -- the chain -- because the Constitution has changed."
2014.13-553,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2904.971,2906.723,"The Constitution might have changed, but the statute didn't."
2014.13-553,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2906.723,2912.693,"--But I don't know that that's a tax on the river because that could just be a tax that's designed to deal with, like, a toll road."
2014.13-553,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2944.831,2954.204,"So suppose the State taxed railroads at 4 percent, but then gave them a -- a credit against what they paid on the highway tax."
2014.13-553,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2956.822,2960.957,Gave an exemption to the -- I'm sorry?
2014.13-553,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2960.957,2968.896,That they gave -- they gave a deduction for the sales tax against what they've paid in highway taxes.
2014.13-553,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2968.896,2973.182,So you're talking about the railroads and what we pay a highway tax?
2014.13-553,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2973.182,2974.534,"No, so the -- the truckers."
2014.13-553,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2974.534,2975.45,I just want to make sure I understand.
2014.13-553,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2975.45,2977.034,I -- I -- I misstated.
2014.13-553,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2980.018,2980.437,Right.
2014.13-553,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2980.437,2984.055,But then they give the truckers a deduction for whatever they paid in the highway tax.
2014.13-553,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2984.055,2985.439,"Well, no."
2014.13-553,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2988.191,3001.601,"--As -- as I understand the court of appeals' judgment as to the truckers, the court of appeals just said it's too complicated, forget it, we're not even going to look at Alabama's argument."
2014.13-553,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3027.166,3031.47,"Well, in the first place, it's not a problem for me if you decide on the water carriers."
2014.13-553,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3055.836,3061.505,"Well, doesn't it have to be appropriate as going in that Alabama can say, here's the tax that we impose on truckers?"
2014.13-553,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3069.578,3072.797,"Right, but -- and -- and we did say why that's wrong."
2014.13-553,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3072.797,3074.463,But that's not what the court of appeals said.
2014.13-553,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3085.788,3085.955,Right.
2014.13-553,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3153.265,3153.882,"Thank you, counsel."
2014.13-553,3,56097,andrew_l_brasher,,3155.284,3159.653,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice: Let me just make a few quick points."
2014.13-553,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3398.109,3400.127,Anything you can give us on barges?
2014.13-553,3,56097,andrew_l_brasher,,3400.127,3415.287,"--Well, I would make one point about that and that the only thing in the record is not only that they're 1 percent of the market, but that specific stipulation that we entered into is about the intrastate market, 1 percent of the intrastate market."
2014.13-553,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3453.346,3454.279,"Thank you, counsel."
