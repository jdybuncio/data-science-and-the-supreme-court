1974.73-1309,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,47.463,We'll hear arguments next in Bigelow against Virginia.
1974.73-1309,0,36947,melvin_l_wulf,,49.661,52.919,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1974.73-1309,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,105.422,136.345,"Would it make any difference Mr. Wulf to your decision you have asserted in your briefs if that were explicitly an ad which solicited, actively solicited -- you say this is just an announcement of service, but suppose they solicited and fixed prices and set credit terms can be arranged in an extensive treatment that usually associated with solicitation of business?"
1974.73-1309,0,36947,melvin_l_wulf,,136.345,136.626,"No, sir."
1974.73-1309,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,136.82,151.838,"It wouldn't make any difference at all, then it follows the state has no power to regulate the advertising of professional services?"
1974.73-1309,0,36947,melvin_l_wulf,,151.838,157.279,"Well, these were not directly professional services that were being regulated in any case, these were referral services."
1974.73-1309,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,171.079,176.804,"As a matter -- that's conduit to the professional services, isn't it, a direct --"
1974.73-1309,0,36947,melvin_l_wulf,,176.804,178.691,It surely is.
1974.73-1309,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,346.411,362.802,I suppose it follows from your position Mr. Wulf that a state would be constitutionally prohibited from telling newspapers that they could not advertise cigarettes?
1974.73-1309,0,36947,melvin_l_wulf,,362.802,364.169,"Yes, yes."
1974.73-1309,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,375.1,386.245,What about the Virginia newspaper carrying an ad for a Maryland Lottery assuming the lottery is illegal in Virginia but legal in Maryland?
1974.73-1309,0,36947,melvin_l_wulf,,386.245,392.636,"I think, I think that's lawful too because I don't think that that would be any different than the facts in the case here, yes, Your Honor."
1974.73-1309,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,392.636,395.144,What do you do with the Pittsburgh Press --
1974.73-1309,0,36947,melvin_l_wulf,,395.144,396.515,I disagree with it Your Honor.
1974.73-1309,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,396.515,401.911,"Well, you got five people that are still here though that joined it."
1974.73-1309,0,36947,melvin_l_wulf,,403.433,418.796,"Well, what I do with Pittsburgh Press is to try to persuade at least one of the members of that majority but this is not commercial speech that's involved in my case, and I will deal with that because I think it's pretty clearly not."
1974.73-1309,0,36947,melvin_l_wulf,,831.904,833.261,"No, I didn't concede that Your Honor."
1974.73-1309,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,837.813,844.462,"I thought you said that they could forbid the doctrine, they couldn't forbid the newspaper from taking the ad?"
1974.73-1309,0,36947,melvin_l_wulf,,844.462,863.275,"I said more generally that producers of good -- I think what I said was the produce -- at least what I intended to say was producers of goods and services could be prohibited from advertising in some cases, which I don't have to define that there is a difference between prohibiting them from advertising and prohibiting and penalizing newspapers for running the advertisement."
1974.73-1309,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,870.112,888.388,Some of the members of the Court in the Pittsburgh Press case thought that employers might be prohibited from specifying certain factors in employment ads but the newspapers could not.
1974.73-1309,0,36947,melvin_l_wulf,,892.846,893.193,Yes.
1974.73-1309,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,939.864,946.212,Isn't it true that the pressure here really put on the doctor who does the advertisement and not on the paper who carried it?
1974.73-1309,0,36947,melvin_l_wulf,,946.212,947.301,I beg your --
1974.73-1309,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,947.301,953.169,Isn't the usual pressure on that doctor not to use the newspaper rather the newspaper who published it?
1974.73-1309,0,36947,melvin_l_wulf,,953.169,977.327,"Well, surely I think the pressure is a thread of being disbarred on -- yes, and not on the newspaper because the doctor, I think in practical terms doctors -- I don't recall ever seeing an advertisement by a physician for standard medical services."
1974.73-1309,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,977.327,979.361,What if there have been Dental?
1974.73-1309,0,36947,melvin_l_wulf,,979.361,979.949,I'm sorry?
1974.73-1309,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,979.949,981.591,There have been Dental cases?
1974.73-1309,0,36947,melvin_l_wulf,,981.591,989.244,"Yes, there was a case the similar case here of course upheld the power to prohibit that but again there wasn't any First Amendment issue raised there."
1974.73-1309,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,989.244,991.45,It was the Head case wasn't it?
1974.73-1309,0,36947,melvin_l_wulf,,993.58,995.243,That was oculist or optometrist.
1974.73-1309,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,995.452,996.081,Optometrist.
1974.73-1309,0,36947,melvin_l_wulf,,996.081,997.157,"Yes, yes."
1974.73-1309,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1033.674,1059.683,"Mr. Wulf, you pointed out that this advertisement related to abortions in New York where they were practically illegal, suppose you'd had an advertisement for narcotics in Virginia, the ad indicating that if you got in touch with a certain individual, he could direct you to a place where narcotics could be obtained?"
1974.73-1309,0,36947,melvin_l_wulf,,1059.683,1063.012,I think that could be prohibited indeed.
1974.73-1309,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1074.11,1091.174,"Would your answer be the same if five years ago before this Court's decision on abortions, this ad had related to abortions in Virginia where at that time they were illegal except under certain circumstances?"
1974.73-1309,0,36947,melvin_l_wulf,,1091.174,1105.705,I don't think so Your Honor because I think that we must look not only at the question of whether a particular service or goods is prohibited but we also have to look at the nature of the service or the goods.
1974.73-1309,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1152.137,1161.106,I thought you would (Inaudible).
1974.73-1309,0,36947,melvin_l_wulf,,1161.106,1166.044,"I wouldn't Your Honor where -- no, I don't think I said that, if I did I didn't intend to."
1974.73-1309,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1167.933,1170.12,But I think you would not say more?
1974.73-1309,0,36947,melvin_l_wulf,,1170.12,1181.145,"Well, I might make it but I don't have the additional argument that it could be prohibited because it was solicitation of criminal offense, but I don't."
1974.73-1309,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1187.603,1193.374,Unless assassins mentions for hire -- assassins for hire?
1974.73-1309,0,36947,melvin_l_wulf,,1193.374,1202.947,I might make it but I wouldn't make it very confidently although I might argue that you couldn't proceed against the newspaper that you have to proceed against the advertiser.
1974.73-1309,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1241.513,1243.694,Mr. Lowe.
1974.73-1309,1,31488,john_c_lowe,,1243.694,1246.578,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1974.73-1309,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1283.161,1290.856,Do newspapers ordinarily accept pay for exercising the editorial function?
1974.73-1309,1,31488,john_c_lowe,,1295.442,1317.345,"Your Honor, I am most certainly suggesting that in the context particularly of an underground newspaper where it's a hand to mouth operation where a dollar here and there helps to keep the paper going that they do accept fund from whatever source including accepting advertisement which follows their editorial policy and supports it, but which will provide some revenues, and in fact this is the case here."
1974.73-1309,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1415.277,1428.508,"If an editor is so enthusiastic about a particular activity, he can promote that in his editorial columns and his news column without calling on ads, can't he?"
1974.73-1309,1,31488,john_c_lowe,,1428.508,1429.775,He can and he does.
1974.73-1309,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1473.131,1476.707,Are these newspapers on the record?
1974.73-1309,1,31488,john_c_lowe,,1476.707,1477.6,The other ones are not.
1974.73-1309,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1804.878,1814.301,"Well, what about the -- what about the law, doctors may not advertise the newspapers may not carry their ads?"
1974.73-1309,1,31488,john_c_lowe,,1814.301,1816.302,I think the first will Mr. Justice White that that is --
1974.73-1309,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1816.302,1819.051,"Yes, that is narrow?"
1974.73-1309,1,31488,john_c_lowe,,1819.051,1825.942,I think that would but I think that would be overbroad in sweeping in much conduct which would not be proper now --
1974.73-1309,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1825.942,1827.346,Like what?
1974.73-1309,1,31488,john_c_lowe,,1827.346,1832.69,"Well, for example I think that there -- well, of course obviously adopted to advertise for health."
1974.73-1309,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1832.69,1838.327,"Well, they don't have to ask for their medical services."
1974.73-1309,1,31488,john_c_lowe,,1838.327,1839.934,I would have to say Mr. Justice White --
1974.73-1309,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1839.934,1845.119,"Well, let's just make it as narrow as you can possibly imagine and so that you have to get down on the substitute --"
1974.73-1309,1,31488,john_c_lowe,,1845.119,1845.866,"Yes, sir."
1974.73-1309,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1845.866,1850.23,-- and not talk about overbreadth.
1974.73-1309,1,31488,john_c_lowe,,1850.23,1851.198,"Alright, of course I take --"
1974.73-1309,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1851.198,1861.506,May the press be permitted to carry the ad of a person who is forbidden to publish an ad?
1974.73-1309,1,31488,john_c_lowe,,1861.506,1869.499,I would have to first answer somewhat as Mr. (Inaudible) had just answered that I must answer that in a context of the First Amendment as this Court has handed down through decisions.
1974.73-1309,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1882.066,1886.31,Pittsburgh is the one that you would center on?
1974.73-1309,1,31488,john_c_lowe,,1886.31,1888.136,I think I would center on Pittsburgh.
1974.73-1309,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1888.136,1890.262,Because it's the most recent or the most definitive?
1974.73-1309,1,31488,john_c_lowe,,1890.262,1900.437,"No, I think it's just the most definitive on point there, and again I have not -- we have dealt in the terms of an abortion referral agency which I think it's a little different than a professional, a doctor."
1974.73-1309,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1909.207,1913.678,"Well, wasn't there some flavor of this in the Virginia Court's opinion in this case?"
1974.73-1309,1,31488,john_c_lowe,,1913.678,1916.022,"Oh! I think that there was such a flavor, yes."
1974.73-1309,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1916.022,1921.018,That the doctors shouldn't advertise; the newspaper shouldn't carry their ads?
1974.73-1309,1,31488,john_c_lowe,,1921.018,1923.709,"I believe that that is the part of the basis, yes."
1974.73-1309,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1933.021,1935.384,Mr. Lacy.
1974.73-1309,2,21138,d_patrick_lacy_jr,,1935.384,1942.278,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1974.73-1309,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2079.3,2101.24,What -- did you find any evidence that the statute was based on anything other than an assumption that a newspaper shouldn't advertise or services that were illegal?
1974.73-1309,2,21138,d_patrick_lacy_jr,,2101.24,2101.645,"No, sir."
1974.73-1309,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2132.505,2142.502,Do you think that the -- just a specialize application of the general prohibition against advertising by doctors?
1974.73-1309,2,21138,d_patrick_lacy_jr,,2142.502,2145.244,That certainly was a holding of the Supreme Court of Virginia.
1974.73-1309,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2165.883,2171.716,"Well, what business that it have -- Virginia would have to New York medical?"
1974.73-1309,2,21138,d_patrick_lacy_jr,,2171.716,2177.992,"Well, the business of Virginia obviously we cannot tell New York what its law should be."
1974.73-1309,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2191.702,2195.949,But they're not advertising medical services in Virginia.
1974.73-1309,2,21138,d_patrick_lacy_jr,,2199.552,2210.3,"But the advertisement is in Virginia, the actual advertisement of medical services is in Virginia, although the medical services are going to be performed in New York, the advertisement for those medical services is in Virginia."
1974.73-1309,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2210.3,2214.68,And how is it going injure the Commonwealth of Virginia?
1974.73-1309,2,21138,d_patrick_lacy_jr,,2214.68,2223.002,"Well, the same way in advertising from medical services that would be performed to Virginia could harm a woman."
1974.73-1309,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2224.016,2236.298,You're talking about “medical services in New York City” or rather “medical services outside of the Commonwealth of Virginia?”
1974.73-1309,2,21138,d_patrick_lacy_jr,,2236.298,2236.318,Correct sir.
1974.73-1309,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2236.318,2240.652,That's what you're seeking to regulate.
1974.73-1309,2,21138,d_patrick_lacy_jr,,2240.652,2240.818,The statute --
1974.73-1309,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2240.818,2243.295,Do you think it's prohibited?
1974.73-1309,2,21138,d_patrick_lacy_jr,,2243.295,2249.086,"We're not seeking to prohibit -- this statute is not a statute of prohibiting abortion, no sir."
1974.73-1309,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2249.086,2252.873,What is prohibited then people from traveling to New York to get one?
1974.73-1309,2,21138,d_patrick_lacy_jr,,2252.873,2254.026,"No sir, it is not."
1974.73-1309,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2254.262,2255.233,"Well, what is it?"
1974.73-1309,2,21138,d_patrick_lacy_jr,,2255.233,2257.805,There's no statutory prohibition against the woman leaving --
1974.73-1309,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2257.805,2261.545,"What it is, it's just penalizing the newspaper for publishing it?"
1974.73-1309,2,21138,d_patrick_lacy_jr,,2261.545,2271.09,"No sir, it's a statute intended to keep commercial -- purely commercial advertising out of the medical health field."
1974.73-1309,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2273.049,2279.947,"Well, could you prohibit them from advertising Alka-Seltzer?"
1974.73-1309,2,21138,d_patrick_lacy_jr,,2279.947,2287.521,"Well, Alka-Seltzer, I don't think is within that frame of medical health."
1974.73-1309,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2289.092,2291.526,"Well, Aspirin?"
1974.73-1309,2,21138,d_patrick_lacy_jr,,2291.526,2292.163,I think they could prohibit --
1974.73-1309,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2292.163,2294.913,Aspirin is slightly medical?
1974.73-1309,2,21138,d_patrick_lacy_jr,,2294.913,2297.613,I think they could prohibit proscription drugs then you get in the --
1974.73-1309,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2297.613,2307.851,Could they prohibit the advertising to people of Virginia that you can buy Aspirin in New York?
1974.73-1309,2,21138,d_patrick_lacy_jr,,2307.851,2309.134,"No sir, but not for the reasons --"
1974.73-1309,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2309.134,2314.061,And the difference between that and this case is just what?
1974.73-1309,2,21138,d_patrick_lacy_jr,,2314.061,2320.791,The difference between that case in this case is the fact that abortion is a medical procedure.
1974.73-1309,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2361.864,2366.883,Professionalism in New York?
1974.73-1309,2,21138,d_patrick_lacy_jr,,2366.883,2373.339,Professionalism -- anybody wants to render medical services to individuals in Virginia.
1974.73-1309,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2373.339,2375.715,In New York?
1974.73-1309,2,21138,d_patrick_lacy_jr,,2375.715,2378.209,We have the right to make sure --
1974.73-1309,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2378.209,2383.536,You make sure that New York does its medical job properly?
1974.73-1309,2,21138,d_patrick_lacy_jr,,2383.536,2388.207,Make sure that anybody who comes down to Virginia and advertises in Virginia.
1974.73-1309,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2393.402,2407.896,"I don't think you had anything to do with this, if this was -- and advertise would mail down through the mail, you don't want to have anything to do with that, because of interstate commerce, and they sent it down and sent the check and then they published it."
1974.73-1309,2,21138,d_patrick_lacy_jr,,2414.235,2419.016,It's not a question of -- you can't point to the injury right there.
1974.73-1309,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2419.016,2424.291,Could you pass a statute to say that no woman in Virginia can go to New York and get an abortion?
1974.73-1309,2,21138,d_patrick_lacy_jr,,2424.291,2426.295,Absolutely not.
1974.73-1309,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2426.295,2435.081,"The Supreme Court of Virginia seemed to put it on the basis of Virginia's sovereign power to protect its citizens, did it not?"
1974.73-1309,2,21138,d_patrick_lacy_jr,,2435.081,2440.272,"Precisely sir, the police power to protect the health and welfare of its citizens."
1974.73-1309,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2468.994,2469.919,Mr. Lacy.
1974.73-1309,2,21138,d_patrick_lacy_jr,,2469.919,2471.172,"Yes, sir."
1974.73-1309,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2471.172,2491.642,"Suppose the advertisement had advised readers where they could get the best appendectomy in Virginia, is there any statute in Virginia that would proscribe that type of advertisement?"
1974.73-1309,2,21138,d_patrick_lacy_jr,,2491.642,2497.483,"Am I to understand Your Honor from the hypothetical that it would be no profit, it's just an informational bulletin."
1974.73-1309,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2497.483,2497.839,No.
1974.73-1309,2,21138,d_patrick_lacy_jr,,2548.631,2571.046,"Well, the answer to your first question or your second question first Your Honor, I believe it would withstand and I believe the state has a valid interest in seeing that medical services, medical procedures are not advertised, in seeing that doctors don't say, I perform or I specialize in hemorrhoidectomy or whatever it may be called and my price is so and so or something this."
1974.73-1309,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2625.431,2626.941,I wonder how far this goes.
1974.73-1309,2,21138,d_patrick_lacy_jr,,2642.436,2649.02,"Well, that the statute itself only pertains to people who publish it or who cause it to be published."
1974.73-1309,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2655.652,2657.573,Whether if it's enforced or not.
1974.73-1309,2,21138,d_patrick_lacy_jr,,2664.624,2667.907,"Well, first of all I don't think it would apply to the distributor."
1974.73-1309,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2669.836,2670.758,Yes.
1974.73-1309,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2679.16,2680.897,As to who can be prohibited?
1974.73-1309,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2680.897,2682.586,Yes.
1974.73-1309,2,21138,d_patrick_lacy_jr,,2682.586,2682.791,"Well, we certainly --"
1974.73-1309,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2682.791,2687.046,Reversed and appeared not in this paper but in New York Times.
1974.73-1309,2,21138,d_patrick_lacy_jr,,2691.037,2693.973,"It is sold in Virginia, yes sir."
1974.73-1309,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2693.973,2696.223,Could it be distributed (Voice Overlap)?
1974.73-1309,2,21138,d_patrick_lacy_jr,,2696.223,2697.375,"No, sir."
1974.73-1309,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2697.375,2698.033,Why not?
1974.73-1309,2,21138,d_patrick_lacy_jr,,2704.285,2711.207,"Well, one big factual difference is that this person, the appellant in this particular case is a person who actually published it."
1974.73-1309,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2714.101,2717.238,"Well, I'm assuming a statute would reach those other than distributor."
1974.73-1309,2,21138,d_patrick_lacy_jr,,2717.238,2724.62,Oh! I'm sorry.
1974.73-1309,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2726.834,2736.333,There's nothing except what -- you have this advertisement in New York Times instead of the newspaper distributed in Virginia?
1974.73-1309,2,21138,d_patrick_lacy_jr,,2736.333,2738.269,I think so for this reason.
1974.73-1309,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2738.269,2739.518,It could?
1974.73-1309,2,21138,d_patrick_lacy_jr,,2739.518,2741.442,"Yes sir, I think so for this reason."
1974.73-1309,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2769.735,2777.655,"And from putting the ad into a newspaper, advertisement?"
1974.73-1309,2,21138,d_patrick_lacy_jr,,2777.655,2779.319,"Precisely, yes sir."
1974.73-1309,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2779.319,2785.922,"And do you think your statute 18.163, as it existed, went that far?"
1974.73-1309,2,21138,d_patrick_lacy_jr,,2785.922,2787.023,"No, sir."
1974.73-1309,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2787.023,2805.137,"And it says if any person by publication much your advertisement or by the sale or circulation of any publication, wouldn't that cover Mr. Justice Brennan's hypothetical?"
1974.73-1309,2,21138,d_patrick_lacy_jr,,2805.137,2814.687,"The sale circulation, I think it's the economic activity, obviously it probably would in that particular instance."
1974.73-1309,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2814.687,2819.1,So the New York Times is in trouble if it carries its ads on the paper of Virginia?
1974.73-1309,2,21138,d_patrick_lacy_jr,,2819.1,2820.363,"No sir, it's not in trouble now."
1974.73-1309,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2820.363,2821.027,Do you think --
1974.73-1309,2,21138,d_patrick_lacy_jr,,2821.027,2824.726,The statute [Laughter Attempt] -- the statute is no longer here.
1974.73-1309,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2839.066,2842.137,They effectively repeal what has been repealed?
1974.73-1309,2,21138,d_patrick_lacy_jr,,2842.137,2846.387,"Well, no sir what I mean is that it was amended I said effectively repeal by amendment."
1974.73-1309,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2859.073,2865.172,"In other words, that would be procedures by other than licensed physician?"
1974.73-1309,2,21138,d_patrick_lacy_jr,,2866.381,2868.585,"Excuse me sir, I didn't -- I'm sorry."
1974.73-1309,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2868.585,2875.976,I understood your last statement that was limited to abortions that were illegal in Virginia.
1974.73-1309,2,21138,d_patrick_lacy_jr,,2875.976,2877.178,That's the amended version.
1974.73-1309,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2877.178,2878.041,Of statute?
1974.73-1309,2,21138,d_patrick_lacy_jr,,2878.041,2878.231,"Yes, sir."
1974.73-1309,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2878.231,2884.526,That simply means that it's the one that's performed by someone other than a physician then?
1974.73-1309,2,21138,d_patrick_lacy_jr,,2884.526,2893.077,"Precisely, we had -- we have to follow the decisions of this Court in Roe v. Wade and Doe v. Bolton."
1974.73-1309,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2893.077,2900.072,But they have nothing to do with advertising of medical services as I think Mr. Justice Powell pointed out.
1974.73-1309,2,21138,d_patrick_lacy_jr,,2908.799,2908.991,I'm sorry.
1974.73-1309,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2908.991,2913.634,This is a case involving advertising not the whole of the conduct.
1974.73-1309,2,21138,d_patrick_lacy_jr,,2913.634,2925.745,"Precisely, but what the General Assembly did Your Honor up to the appellant's conviction -- and there's nothing in the record show they did it with regard to this case or not it was done."
1974.73-1309,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2931.64,2939.735,Did you tell us that this was the first prosecution under the statute in modern times?
1974.73-1309,2,21138,d_patrick_lacy_jr,,2939.735,2944.874,The best information I have is not only in modern times but in any time.
1974.73-1309,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3245.422,3258.201,How does that interpret an Act passed in 1872 as to what New York is doing there?
1974.73-1309,2,21138,d_patrick_lacy_jr,,3258.201,3263.399,"Well, the Supreme Court of Virginia interpreted the Act."
1974.73-1309,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3263.399,3269.096,On the basis of what's going on now in as to compared to 1872?
1974.73-1309,2,21138,d_patrick_lacy_jr,,3269.096,3281.526,"That could just easily have gone in Your Honor, but I submit that the Supreme Court of Virginia supposed we have no legislative history as you may know in Virginia versus Sullivan do we have legislation --"
1974.73-1309,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3281.526,3292.24,"Do you know, the Supreme Court of Virginia knows one single thing about what goes on in the matter of profession in the State of New York, am I correct?"
1974.73-1309,2,21138,d_patrick_lacy_jr,,3292.24,3297.261,"We know from the New York cases, the Supreme Court of Virginia cited the New York cases."
1974.73-1309,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3297.261,3313.196,That's all you know but you don't know how -- the Commonwealth of Virginia takes position that the medical profession is -- New York has long or (INaudible)?
1974.73-1309,2,21138,d_patrick_lacy_jr,,3313.196,3320.351,"No sir, but the thing -- but the point is Your Honor that we don't have to wait."
1974.73-1309,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3324.411,3330.537,It was decided in Virginia to advertise in New York is wrong.
1974.73-1309,2,21138,d_patrick_lacy_jr,,3330.537,3331.066,"Well, we've --"
1974.73-1309,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3331.066,3343.754,"Now do you -- Mr. Lacy, do you have a -- is there before us in the brief story where the new statute in Virginia -- the text of it?"
1974.73-1309,2,21138,d_patrick_lacy_jr,,3343.754,3345.348,"Yes sir, for definitely."
1974.73-1309,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3345.348,3347.197,Where?
1974.73-1309,2,21138,d_patrick_lacy_jr,,3347.197,3368.093,At page 4 of our brief in the footnote if Your Honor please footnote 2 on page 4.
1974.73-1309,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3368.093,3371.422,So that is the effective statute.
1974.73-1309,2,21138,d_patrick_lacy_jr,,3378.173,3392.959,If the rationale -- Our rationale is underlying that overbreadth doctrine's chilling effect on First Amendment rights or maybe possibly selective enforcement of the statute -- if the statute is unenforceable those things cannot even exist.
1974.73-1309,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3392.959,3400.802,"So, you're saying that the present statute merely prohibits advertisings about illegal abortions."
1974.73-1309,2,21138,d_patrick_lacy_jr,,3400.802,3402.21,But that's what the statute says.
1974.73-1309,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3402.21,3405.69,"Well, the present statute wouldn't reach this advertisement?"
1974.73-1309,2,21138,d_patrick_lacy_jr,,3405.69,3407.969,"Precisely, precisely."
1974.73-1309,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3410.642,3415.068,It wouldn't reach anything except promoting what would be in illegal abortion.
1974.73-1309,2,21138,d_patrick_lacy_jr,,3415.068,3415.506,Precisely.
1974.73-1309,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3415.506,3417.905,But there are still illegal abortions.
1974.73-1309,2,21138,d_patrick_lacy_jr,,3420.043,3422.496,"Oh! Excuse me, you're precisely correct."
1974.73-1309,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3425.032,3430.511,And in order there are still some abortions that are illegal?
1974.73-1309,2,21138,d_patrick_lacy_jr,,3430.511,3442.088,"I'm talking in terms, we had a statute in Virginia or have a statute in Virginia almost identical to the Georgia statute in Doe v. Bolton if that's what referring to."
1974.73-1309,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3543.181,3560.0,"What do you think if the overbreadth -- let's assume the overbreadth argument is draw practical purposes out of the case, what do you think the issue is with respect to -- that's left in this case."
1974.73-1309,2,21138,d_patrick_lacy_jr,,3562.887,3564.087,Precisely Your Honor.
1974.73-1309,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3564.087,3565.213,And a conviction?
1974.73-1309,2,21138,d_patrick_lacy_jr,,3565.213,3566.441,"A conviction, yes sir."
1974.73-1309,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3566.441,3574.989,"For doing what, for preparing an advertisement about an abortion or an illegal abortion or a legal abortion?"
1974.73-1309,2,21138,d_patrick_lacy_jr,,3574.989,3583.394,"For curing and advertisement about a medical service to with abortion, abortion services, not illegal abortion services."
1974.73-1309,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3583.394,3586.494,"And in your view, it doesn't make any difference whether legal or illegal?"
1974.73-1309,2,21138,d_patrick_lacy_jr,,3586.494,3587.234,Yes sir.
1974.73-1309,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3599.243,3611.913,"But I gather your whole point Mr. Lacy is that your Supreme Court has said this reaches on commercial ads, this is a commercial ad, there go the First Amendment argument fails, is that it?"
1974.73-1309,2,21138,d_patrick_lacy_jr,,3612.871,3614.739,Purely commercial.
1974.73-1309,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3614.739,3626.287,"Well, that maybe right about the old statute but that's a conduct for which this defendant was convicted wouldn't violate this new statute?"
1974.73-1309,2,21138,d_patrick_lacy_jr,,3626.287,3640.522,"No sir, because it would have to -- well, it would have to be -- you gave me one example, I was to assume when I said that no illegal abortion in Virginia and you're correct in the -- that if they advertise that come down to the local midway --"
1974.73-1309,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3640.522,3645.183,Now is there some general statute that prevents doctors from advertising it?
1974.73-1309,2,21138,d_patrick_lacy_jr,,3645.183,3646.659,"Yes sir, there is."
1974.73-1309,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3646.659,3652.047,Is there any general statute that says newspapers can't publish doctors ads for their services?
1974.73-1309,2,21138,d_patrick_lacy_jr,,3652.047,3657.664,"No, but they could be subjected to aiding and abetting and doctors do publish that."
1974.73-1309,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3657.664,3670.619,"Well then, why did you tell me carrying an ad -- carrying that this -- the ad that's involved in this case wouldn't be illegal in Virginia?"
1974.73-1309,2,21138,d_patrick_lacy_jr,,3670.619,3676.079,This is not an ad by a doctor.
1974.73-1309,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3676.079,3679.145,"It's an ad about a medical service, isn't it?"
1974.73-1309,2,21138,d_patrick_lacy_jr,,3679.145,3682.977,"Well, you asked me whether we have a statute specifically drawn to doctors and I'm sorry."
1974.73-1309,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3682.977,3683.15,Do you --
1974.73-1309,2,21138,d_patrick_lacy_jr,,3683.15,3687.515,"Yes sir we do, specifically drawn to doctors."
1974.73-1309,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3687.515,3704.19,"What if the doctor had his nurse, his receptionist put the ad in the paper, just simply giving out a name such as this one reliable medical referral service?"
1974.73-1309,2,21138,d_patrick_lacy_jr,,3704.19,3707.021,"Could we prohibit that sir, is that your question?"
1974.73-1309,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3707.021,3711.354,Does the present statute of Virginia prohibit that?
1974.73-1309,2,21138,d_patrick_lacy_jr,,3719.309,3729.2,"It's Section 54-317, sub-paragraph 13 and it says, ""any doctor either directly or indirectly""."
1974.73-1309,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3745.8,3746.415,Thank you gentlemen.
