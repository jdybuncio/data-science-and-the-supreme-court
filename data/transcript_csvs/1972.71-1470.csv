1972.71-1470,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,46.42,"We’ll hear arguments next in 71-1470, Lemon against Kurtzman."
1972.71-1470,0,20530,david_p_bruton,,49.145,53.67,"Mr. Chief Justice and members of the Court, may it please the Court."
1972.71-1470,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,423.893,425.872,You said these agreements now?
1972.71-1470,0,20530,david_p_bruton,,425.872,434.212,I’m now referring to agreements covering the 1970-1971 school year that is the year and the only year which is at issue here.
1972.71-1470,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,434.212,439.036,"And those are the contracts that were made in January, something 1971?"
1972.71-1470,0,20530,david_p_bruton,,439.036,441.385,"That’s right, halfway through that year."
1972.71-1470,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,441.802,444.509,"The school year I gather, begins September doesn’t it or August?"
1972.71-1470,0,20530,david_p_bruton,,444.509,448.093,"Yes, September 1, I think is essentially the beginning."
1972.71-1470,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,448.093,450.63,No point was made as to 1969-1970 at all?
1972.71-1470,0,20530,david_p_bruton,,450.63,451.336,That’s correct.
1972.71-1470,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,470.833,474.585,And was the amount for the 1969 that you actually disbursed?
1972.71-1470,0,20530,david_p_bruton,,474.585,475.746,I do not have that figure.
1972.71-1470,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,478.366,480.351,And that sum that you now have is?
1972.71-1470,0,20530,david_p_bruton,,480.351,483.619,About $24 or $25 million approximately.
1972.71-1470,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,483.619,492.475,"Mr. Bruton was that January a date in which the contracts went into issue, or just a random date, or do you correspond to some appropriation, or something like that?"
1972.71-1470,0,20530,david_p_bruton,,492.475,505.864,"It is the date which was established Mr. Justice Rehnquist, in the schedule which was put out by the State itself with its rules and regulations when they were issued under the statute."
1972.71-1470,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,514.145,523.058,"Mr. Bruton, do I correctly have the impression that you did not seek a temporary restraining order or an injunction in this case?"
1972.71-1470,0,20530,david_p_bruton,,523.058,524.526,That is correct.
1972.71-1470,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,524.526,526.418,Is there any significance in that at all?
1972.71-1470,0,20530,david_p_bruton,,526.418,529.775,"I do not believe at this time that there is, Your Honor."
1972.71-1470,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,551.123,557.392,"Well, if you had sought an injunction would it have been against disbursements, or against entering under these agreements?"
1972.71-1470,0,20530,david_p_bruton,,557.392,559.387,It would have been against the disbursements.
1972.71-1470,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,564.546,577.182,"Well, if these funds can’t be disbursed now as a constitutional matter, then recovery of the amounts paid in prior years is in what status in your view?"
1972.71-1470,0,20530,david_p_bruton,,584.204,592.105,"Constitutionally I would say yes, because I think that there is at least since the Tidal Oil case in 1924."
1972.71-1470,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,615.92,618.995,What kind of policy would you call that?
1972.71-1470,0,20530,david_p_bruton,,623.013,624.154,I think in that --
1972.71-1470,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,624.154,625.987,Is that official policy?
1972.71-1470,0,20530,david_p_bruton,,625.987,651.647,"Yes, I think I have reference to the standards which have been suggested in Linkletter and certain other cases in which it’s been indicated that when one is considering retroactive application, one ought to look at the substance of the rule which is laid down, and determine whether the policy that lies behind that rule will be offended or not if only a prospective application is given."
1972.71-1470,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,849.927,858.121,"For that Montgomery School, is it a disbursement for the 1970-1971 school year?"
1972.71-1470,0,20530,david_p_bruton,,858.121,868.286,"There are two years in question in that case. One of them is 1970-1971, one of them is 1969 and 1970, in which is also interesting and I’ll come to that in a moment."
1972.71-1470,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,962.363,965.405,It would be agreement to say “constitutional rulings.”
1972.71-1470,0,20530,david_p_bruton,,965.405,972.454,Constitutional rulings primarily although I think one can find precedence which address the same problem even in other areas of which --
1972.71-1470,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,972.454,977.309,"But all judicial -- all judicial rulings are not retroactive, are they?"
1972.71-1470,0,20530,david_p_bruton,,977.309,982.03,"Surely, injunctions by their very nature or not, yes."
1972.71-1470,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,982.03,986.963,"You mean, you put emphasis on constitutional ruling, constitutional adjudication?"
1972.71-1470,0,20530,david_p_bruton,,986.963,988.053,Principally.
1972.71-1470,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1051.495,1054.647,What about the reliance factor here?
1972.71-1470,0,20530,david_p_bruton,,1054.647,1058.517,This is exactly what I’m coming to.
1972.71-1470,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1065.838,1067.787,May I ask why you call them “so called?”
1972.71-1470,0,20530,david_p_bruton,,1067.787,1077.937,"Well, I think there’s a real question, Your Honor, as to whether these agreements are true contracts in the sense of a quid pro quo between the Commonwealth and the schools."
1972.71-1470,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1087.651,1088.898,You mean it’s a subsidy really?
1972.71-1470,0,20530,david_p_bruton,,1088.898,1093.196,They’re really being subsidized for doing what they would be doing anyway.
1972.71-1470,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1107.334,1135.446,"Well, isn’t there a quid in the sense broadly for the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania or any other state in that the maintenance of private schools relieves the state of considerable burden, and that even an open subsidy identified as the subsidy is a partial recompense for that?"
1972.71-1470,0,20530,david_p_bruton,,1135.446,1135.72,Perhaps.
1972.71-1470,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1135.72,1139.401,But you’re now talking just about contract law and not the constitutional law.
1972.71-1470,0,20530,david_p_bruton,,1139.401,1140.595,That’s right.
1972.71-1470,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1286.584,1289.919,"Just a moment here to find page 9 of the appendix, you say?"
1972.71-1470,0,20530,david_p_bruton,,1289.919,1290.7,I’m sorry.
1972.71-1470,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1292.945,1293.591,Oh!
1972.71-1470,0,20530,david_p_bruton,,1293.67,1297.99,-- rather than the appendix itself.
1972.71-1470,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1297.99,1299.025,Thank you.
1972.71-1470,0,20530,david_p_bruton,,1299.025,1303.402,Page 9 of the appendix which is toward the rear.
1972.71-1470,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1341.928,1350.33,"But you have the course of the conduct over the relationships between the parties that might give a basis for some reliance, haven’t you?"
1972.71-1470,0,20530,david_p_bruton,,1350.33,1353.064,You’ve anticipated my next point Mr. Chief Justice.
1972.71-1470,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1397.953,1409.521,"Well, will you state again Mr. Bruton the date on which the District Court first held that statute unconstitutional in relation to this January 15, 1971 date?"
1972.71-1470,0,20530,david_p_bruton,,1409.521,1413.895,"The first decision, I’m not sure I know which decision you’re referring to."
1972.71-1470,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1417.695,1419.039,And that was to what effect?
1972.71-1470,0,20530,david_p_bruton,,1419.039,1421.839,And that was to the effect that the statute was constitutional.
1972.71-1470,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1421.839,1422.294,Was constitutional.
1972.71-1470,0,20530,david_p_bruton,,1422.294,1423.619,They dismissed the complaint.
1972.71-1470,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1423.619,1424.125,Right.
1972.71-1470,0,20530,david_p_bruton,,1424.125,1430.291,"The second decision was not rendered until after remand from this Court, which was in I think November of 1971."
1972.71-1470,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1430.291,1437.665,"So at least so far as would any judicial determination, that determination was favorable at the constitutionality of the statute?"
1972.71-1470,0,20530,david_p_bruton,,1437.665,1438.234,That’s correct.
1972.71-1470,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1438.234,1440.133,As of the time these agreements were made.
1972.71-1470,0,20530,david_p_bruton,,1440.133,1442.1,That -- it is correct.
1972.71-1470,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1442.1,1445.459,"Of course in the meantime, you had the Rhode Island decision the other way?"
1972.71-1470,0,20530,david_p_bruton,,1445.459,1461.382,"DiCenso case came down from the three-judge District Court in June of 1970 before the school year in question here eight months before the contracts were signed, unanimously striking down a very similar statute concerning salary supplements."
1972.71-1470,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1486.403,1493.244,"As you go along, will you let me have your ideas about burden of proof as to reliance."
1972.71-1470,0,20530,david_p_bruton,,1494.103,1497.163,I’ll be happy to.
1972.71-1470,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1531.335,1532.871,Go along on what you’ve just suggested.
1972.71-1470,0,20530,david_p_bruton,,1532.871,1545.778,"Well, they’ve cited the Allen case for the proposition that on this kind of record it must be presumed that the State has been doing everything right, and that at this point, this money can be distributed."
1972.71-1470,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1599.006,1629.328,"Mr. Bruton, isn’t the -- at least in normal litigation of where you have a judgment of the lower court in your favor, isn’t the normal approach to the equities in this situation that if you think it’s going to be reversed on appeal, you get a temporary restraining order or a stay rather than requiring the prevailing party to anticipate the often serpentine pass of adjudication in the higher courts?"
1972.71-1470,0,20530,david_p_bruton,,1629.328,1631.629,That is certainly often done.
1972.71-1470,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1788.16,1794.853,"Do I infer it correctly Mr. Bruton that if you’re wrong in this reliance point, your case is lost?"
1972.71-1470,0,20530,david_p_bruton,,1794.853,1802.214,"No, I think that the reliance point is only an element which has been indicated in the decisions of this Court to be taken into account."
1972.71-1470,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1812.253,1816.959,You mean the entanglement of trying to determine these past events?
1972.71-1470,0,20530,david_p_bruton,,1816.959,1818.253,Precisely.
1972.71-1470,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1854.723,1875.952,"Well, would it be appropriate for someone at some point to try to find out where their $24 million if that’s the amount involved here, would have a rationale relationship to the totality of secular education costs involved here?"
1972.71-1470,0,20530,david_p_bruton,,1875.952,1879.147,"If the inquiry is, would this fully pay for the --"
1972.71-1470,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1879.147,1891.829,"No, would it be more than, not fully pay for, would it be more than the total secular education expense that these private schools dealt with?"
1972.71-1470,0,20530,david_p_bruton,,1891.829,1896.884,"It is my presumption Your Honor, that it is less than that in fact that there are more --"
1972.71-1470,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1896.884,1897.648,I don’t think so.
1972.71-1470,0,20530,david_p_bruton,,1897.648,1903.33,"We have here the Attorney General, the Commonwealth I’m sure if necessary he could be more specific on that."
1972.71-1470,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1903.33,1913.123,"Well, I gather Mr. Bruton, for what you’ve been telling us about the Philadelphia Montgomery case, do I get this correctly?"
1972.71-1470,0,20530,david_p_bruton,,1922.099,1925.13,"Well, the inquiry seemed to me to be quite perjury."
1972.71-1470,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1930.035,1930.954,"Well, whatever it was."
1972.71-1470,0,20530,david_p_bruton,,1930.954,1932.648,"Whatever it was, an inquiry was made."
1972.71-1470,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1932.648,1944.381,"Then it was determined therefore that perhaps this involves some support of the religious education in school, and therefore, that that school was not qualified."
1972.71-1470,0,20530,david_p_bruton,,1950.681,1951.069,I’m suggesting --
1972.71-1470,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1951.069,1952.797,From which this 24 million would go?
1972.71-1470,0,20530,david_p_bruton,,1952.797,1962.516,"I’m suggesting, Your Honor that if the State were to be consistent with what it has done in this case, it would have to do that and that if the same standard were applied, it would rule out all the schools."
1972.71-1470,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1964.372,1969.298,Who was -- was this a single district judge who took the view he couldn’t look into this?
1972.71-1470,0,20530,david_p_bruton,,1969.298,1969.922,That’s correct.
1972.71-1470,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1984.001,1992.126,Mr. Ball.
1972.71-1470,1,43859,william_b_ball,,1992.126,1996.589,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1972.71-1470,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2302.661,2305.699,When had the Act been asked by the legislature?
1972.71-1470,1,43859,william_b_ball,,2305.699,2307.886,"In June of 1968, Mr. Justice Stewart."
1972.71-1470,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2307.886,2308.605,In June?
1972.71-1470,1,43859,william_b_ball,,2308.605,2308.757,Yes.
1972.71-1470,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2308.757,2312.828,And as you say it was immediately announced publicly that there was going to be a --
1972.71-1470,1,43859,william_b_ball,,2312.828,2313.461,That is correct.
1972.71-1470,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2313.461,2315.019,-- attack upon it in the course?
1972.71-1470,1,43859,william_b_ball,,2315.019,2318.021,"Yes, that’s correct."
1972.71-1470,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2320.468,2324.412,"And actually Mr. Ball, when was the action brought?"
1972.71-1470,1,43859,william_b_ball,,2324.412,2328.622,"The action was brought June 3, 1969."
1972.71-1470,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2328.622,2330.037,Almost a year?
1972.71-1470,1,43859,william_b_ball,,2330.037,2331.381,Almost a year.
1972.71-1470,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2331.381,2334.751,But the announcement had been made upon its adoption that one would be brought?
1972.71-1470,1,43859,william_b_ball,,2334.751,2337.826,"Yes, that is correct as counsel in his statement --"
1972.71-1470,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2337.826,2342.777,"And was it the folks who announced that they were going to bring it, in fact the ones who did bring it?"
1972.71-1470,1,43859,william_b_ball,,2342.777,2344.303,Yes.
1972.71-1470,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2431.041,2434.144,"Mr. Ball, when were the appropriations available?"
1972.71-1470,1,43859,william_b_ball,,2434.144,2439.731,The appropriations under the scheme of the Act would not become available till the following September.
1972.71-1470,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2457.407,2480.641,"Well, what you’re -- do I understand that what you’re saying is that in effect in January 1969 effect was that they executed a formal contract that carried out informal understandings and agreements that had been reached beginning with the opening of the school or before the opening of school?"
1972.71-1470,1,43859,william_b_ball,,2480.641,2494.997,"That is correct Mr. Chief Justice, just a passing word about contracts because we do not think that the existence of a contract is essential to our case though we believe it adds to the equities of our case."
1972.71-1470,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2541.116,2549.805,"Mr. Ball, was anything added or any difference, did any difference result by virtue of these contracts?"
1972.71-1470,1,43859,william_b_ball,,2554.369,2557.354,"Yes, Mr. Justice Blackmun."
1972.71-1470,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2642.967,2651.084,"What I expect Mr. Ball that’s not to suggest that the schools had this Act not been passed, would not have taught these four subject."
1972.71-1470,1,43859,william_b_ball,,2651.084,2652.851,No indeed.
1972.71-1470,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2742.131,2748.642,"Which is to suggest then that in fact, this enable expansion of faculties at least in terms of numbers?"
1972.71-1470,1,43859,william_b_ball,,2748.642,2750.775,"Or indeed it did, yes."
1972.71-1470,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2859.982,2870.942,But Mr. Ball am I not right that at least some of the opinions in Walz suggest that there might be a distinction between subsidy situations and tax exemption?
1972.71-1470,1,43859,william_b_ball,,2870.942,2875.004,"That’s perfectly true Mr. Justice Brennan, but the fact --"
1972.71-1470,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2875.004,2886.514,"I think its fair -- isn’t it fair to say that the Court’s opinion indicated some doubts about, at least doubt about direct subsidies?"
1972.71-1470,1,43859,william_b_ball,,2886.514,2914.188,"I think there can be no doubt of that, but on balance as we read that opinion, we felt that it did not disturb and could not have disturbed what was already determined by the Court in Board of Education versus Allen, where we have a clear support with public funds of the secular function clearly spelled out by the Court which takes place or is offered in sectarian schools."
1972.71-1470,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2954.095,2955.514,That was a dissent?
1972.71-1470,1,43859,william_b_ball,,2955.514,2960.238,"That indeed was a dissent, but a very authoritative dissent, if I may say so."
1972.71-1470,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2960.238,2965.164,"Oh, I’m sure of that."
1972.71-1470,1,43859,william_b_ball,,2965.164,2983.786,"We also examined the concept of entanglement in terms of, or in comparison to the extensive regulation of nonpublic schools which this Court had pointed to in Board of Education versus Allen."
1972.71-1470,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3092.416,3108.453,"Well, I take it you’re addressing yourself in part at least to the predictability of the Court’s holding on this program as of sometime before the holding was actually rendered?"
1972.71-1470,1,43859,william_b_ball,,3122.636,3123.488,Yes.
1972.71-1470,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3123.488,3131.353,"I don’t recall now for the numbers in the first Lemon Kurtzman, there were dissenting opinions --"
1972.71-1470,1,43859,william_b_ball,,3131.353,3131.515,Yes.
1972.71-1470,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3131.515,3132.222,-- they were representing.
1972.71-1470,1,43859,william_b_ball,,3132.222,3137.326,There were indeed Mr. Chief Justice.
1972.71-1470,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3220.108,3223.866,"As I recall it, Judge Hastie dissented in the first three-judge court?"
1972.71-1470,1,43859,william_b_ball,,3223.866,3228.884,That is correct Mr. Chief Justice.
1972.71-1470,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3316.915,3326.887,And before you do Mr. Ball may I ask does payment out of this $24 million contemplate doing this as to each of the recipient schools?
1972.71-1470,1,43859,william_b_ball,,3326.887,3329.751,It contemplates that it will have been done.
1972.71-1470,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3329.751,3331.341,But before the money is paid out?
1972.71-1470,1,43859,william_b_ball,,3331.341,3331.704,Precisely.
1972.71-1470,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3331.704,3337.336,"What you’re now going to tell us it should be done before the money is paid out, is that it?"
1972.71-1470,1,43859,william_b_ball,,3337.336,3337.837,Yes.
1972.71-1470,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3337.837,3338.371,Thank you.
1972.71-1470,1,43859,william_b_ball,,3338.371,3339.434,That’s right.
1972.71-1470,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3506.654,3512.284,Do we know in fact exactly what audit procedures were followed as to teachers’ salaries?
1972.71-1470,1,43859,william_b_ball,,3512.284,3513.883,As to teachers’ salaries?
1972.71-1470,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3513.883,3514.86,Is there anything in the record to tell?
1972.71-1470,1,43859,william_b_ball,,3514.86,3517.567,As to the instruction.
1972.71-1470,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3518.607,3521.707,"Well, I thought you said Mr. Ball perhaps I didn’t catch it correctly."
1972.71-1470,1,43859,william_b_ball,,3521.707,3522.515,Yes.
1972.71-1470,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3522.515,3525.553,That a teacher logged in a certain number of hours?
1972.71-1470,1,43859,william_b_ball,,3525.553,3526.413,Yes.
1972.71-1470,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3526.413,3530.89,"And then submits, I gather, the school submits in her behalf a reimbursement?"
1972.71-1470,1,43859,william_b_ball,,3530.89,3531.121,That is correct.
1972.71-1470,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3531.121,3534.404,"To the school of the amount paid out to that teacher, isn’t that it?"
1972.71-1470,1,43859,william_b_ball,,3534.404,3536.685,And there are two audits which then take place.
1972.71-1470,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3536.685,3537.784,"That’s what I was, yes."
1972.71-1470,1,43859,william_b_ball,,3537.784,3543.911,"First of all there is an audit which neither of us has referred to in our briefs, but it takes place under Pennsylvania Law."
1972.71-1470,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3568.732,3571.54,"But, that’s the extent of his audit?"
1972.71-1470,1,43859,william_b_ball,,3571.54,3572.598,That is correct.
1972.71-1470,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3589.615,3591.619,"Now, how does he go about doing that?"
1972.71-1470,1,43859,william_b_ball,,3591.619,3594.804,That I can not answer.
1972.71-1470,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3624.954,3629.171,"But I gather Mr. Ball, we have nothing in this record to show us what in fact he did?"
1972.71-1470,1,43859,william_b_ball,,3629.171,3630.785,That is perfectly correct --
1972.71-1470,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3630.785,3634.818,"What about this Philadelphia, the case that Mr. Bruton mentioned?"
1972.71-1470,1,43859,william_b_ball,,3634.818,3638.671,"Well, this course is not on the record of this case."
1972.71-1470,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3638.671,3639.27,"Yes, I know."
1972.71-1470,1,43859,william_b_ball,,3639.27,3643.98,And nothing that has been cited on the brief submitted is necessarily true or false.
1972.71-1470,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3643.98,3644.275,Yes.
1972.71-1470,1,43859,william_b_ball,,3644.275,3648.365,It’s a statement of counsel about what’s going on in another case.
1972.71-1470,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3665.073,3670.529,Doesn’t that get us into the very problem of entanglement?
1972.71-1470,1,43859,william_b_ball,,3670.529,3671.519,Precisely.
1972.71-1470,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3676.9,3679.681,"Your basic point is that that’s water over the dam in any event, isn’t it"
1972.71-1470,1,43859,william_b_ball,,3679.681,3681.56,Basic point is that it is water over the dam.
1972.71-1470,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3681.56,3687.117,"It was that entanglement that formed the basis of the Court’s holding in the prior case, was it not?"
1972.71-1470,1,43859,william_b_ball,,3687.117,3688.081,Exactly.
1972.71-1470,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3733.893,3737.552,And you said that under Pennsylvania law that it’s presumptively correct?
1972.71-1470,1,43859,william_b_ball,,3737.552,3738.501,Yes.
1972.71-1470,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3738.501,3747.0,"Do we now Mr. Ball, whether there been any disqualifications of schools upon that kind of audit, and a determination that they had been teaching these?"
1972.71-1470,1,43859,william_b_ball,,3747.0,3750.431,I’m quite confident that there have been disqualifications of schools.
1972.71-1470,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3822.403,3829.215,"I gather Mr. Ball, those are the only two audit operations had take place?"
1972.71-1470,1,43859,william_b_ball,,3830.657,3832.362,Approval of the textbooks.
1972.71-1470,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3832.362,3832.775,Yes.
1972.71-1470,1,43859,william_b_ball,,3832.775,3838.475,"Yes, secondly, the Secretary of Education’s check out of the teacher."
1972.71-1470,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3838.475,3839.085,"Yes, and then the --"
1972.71-1470,1,43859,william_b_ball,,3839.085,3841.725,"Thirdly, the State Treasurer’s audit."
1972.71-1470,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3841.725,3842.466,Audit.
1972.71-1470,1,43859,william_b_ball,,3842.466,3844.539,"And fourthly, a post audit."
1972.71-1470,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3876.462,3882.821,"Well is this a check on the state officials, rather than a check on the --"
1972.71-1470,1,43859,william_b_ball,,3882.821,3884.936,It’s a check on the check so to speak.
1972.71-1470,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3884.936,3885.222,Yes.
1972.71-1470,1,43859,william_b_ball,,3885.222,3891.91,"In other words, let us what takes place in the post audit is simply a review of the audit of the State Treasurer."
1972.71-1470,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3956.142,3969.706,"Mr. Ball, will you take just a minute and try to get me clear on the point that Mr. Bruton was making as I understood in that there was a mistake in the record as to the date the contracts were entered into?"
1972.71-1470,1,43859,william_b_ball,,3986.529,3993.936,My response to that is that the problem of contracting had been established in the 1968.
1972.71-1470,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4063.262,4063.946,Thank you gentlemen.
