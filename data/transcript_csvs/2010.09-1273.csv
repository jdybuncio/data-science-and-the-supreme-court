2010.09-1273,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,5.785,"We'll hear argument next this morning in Case 09-1273, Astra USA v. Santa Clara County."
2010.09-1273,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,6.504,9.956,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2010.09-1273,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,37.673,39.625,I don't understand that.
2010.09-1273,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,75.63,76.88,Yes.
2010.09-1273,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,119.326,129.365,"--How do you answer the point that, if Congress wanted to make this a pure regulatory statute, it wouldn't have even required a contract?"
2010.09-1273,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,151.63,152.396,Well--
2010.09-1273,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,152.396,156.765,--discretion that is consistent with normal contract principles?
2010.09-1273,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,156.765,157.048,--Right.
2010.09-1273,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,277.839,287.63,Your adversary claims you gave up your argument that the contract doesn't make the manufacturers a third-party intended beneficiary.
2010.09-1273,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,288.847,289.297,No.
2010.09-1273,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,334.527,335.06,Private enforcement.
2010.09-1273,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,335.06,345.266,--Private enforcement -- to withhold a private remedy in favor of 340B entities and instead channel exclusive authority to the Secretary to enforce it.
2010.09-1273,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,355.89,374.185,"Is it -- I'm not sure of the answer, but is it different in this case or unusual that the agreement is between the Federal Government and private entities, as opposed to what I think is the more typical situation in which these cases come up, where it is, say, an agreement between the Federal Government and the State?"
2010.09-1273,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,374.185,386.259,"--Well, all your Medicaid cases obviously under State plans, and a lot of your implied right of action jurisprudence is dealing with spending clause legislation as to State entities."
2010.09-1273,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,410.275,416.945,"Ms. Blatt, would you explain the function that the contract mechanism serves?"
2010.09-1273,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,433.307,444.782,"Well, I don't think it is any different than Mobil Oil or Jackson Transit, where Congress wants to specify the terms of the contract and the contract incorporates in haec verba the statutory terms."
2010.09-1273,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,498.932,509.89,"Before the statute was amended by the -- I think the Patient Protection Act and there was a breach of the agreement, did the government assess penalties?"
2010.09-1273,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,509.89,511.057,Well--
2010.09-1273,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,511.057,516.461,Because -- and the reason I'm asking this is that you indicate that the government had a contract remedy.
2010.09-1273,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,518.496,519.863,--It has got a lot of remedies.
2010.09-1273,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,521.198,526.75,"What was the contract remedy that it had at the time this case arose, which was before the -- these--"
2010.09-1273,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,526.75,527.186,--Yes.
2010.09-1273,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,595.913,600.365,"Ms. Blatt, you said that there's not a whole lot of difference between your position and the government's."
2010.09-1273,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,603.25,607.654,"--Well, the government says a contract is not a contract even though it says it's a contract."
2010.09-1273,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,610.006,610.79,"That doesn't make much sense, does it?"
2010.09-1273,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,610.79,618.528,"The government sees this, I think, as just a unilateral, that the manufacturers walked in and said: We're here and happy to be bound."
2010.09-1273,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,638.673,641.107,What did the manufacturer promise in exchange for the contract?
2010.09-1273,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,646.178,652.165,"Well, the billions and billions in price discounts they were not obliged to do unless they -- they signed the contract."
2010.09-1273,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,666.609,668.711,So what is Santa Clara County supposed do?
2010.09-1273,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,677.983,691.04,"--Well, the way they have been getting the money, and for better or worse until 2010, they have been at the mercy of the vastly larger Medicaid rebate program, which is run on behalf of the States."
2010.09-1273,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,703.448,706.567,I'm interested in procedurally what are they supposed to do?
2010.09-1273,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,706.567,710.204,"Oh, pick up the phone and either call the manufacturer, the prime vendor--"
2010.09-1273,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,710.204,713.74,"The manufacturer says: Okay, you're wrong; I'm not; I'm undercharging you."
2010.09-1273,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,714.173,717.625,"--Ultimately, if they can't get the Secretary to--"
2010.09-1273,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,717.625,718.108,He's busy.
2010.09-1273,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,718.108,723.095,"--If she's busy and won't return the calls, Congress said: You can't enforce it."
2010.09-1273,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,723.095,735.486,"Why can't they -- can they, for example, file a claim with the -- with the Secretary and say: We would like the Secretary to order them to give us the money; they're violating this?"
2010.09-1273,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,741.64,745.192,"There's just -- right now, there's just an informal, non-mandatory--"
2010.09-1273,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,745.192,745.544,Okay.
2010.09-1273,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,753.115,764.922,"--Because the statute itself said: We're going to go out of our way to give manufacturers remedies, make this confidential; manufacturers have rights of audit, but 340B entities don't."
2010.09-1273,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,771.242,777.313,"But normally under the law from Marbury v. Madison onward, where there's a wrong, there's a remedy."
2010.09-1273,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,777.313,777.713,But--
2010.09-1273,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,777.713,781.967,"And the remedy could be administrative, could be judicial, et cetera."
2010.09-1273,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,782.817,783.15,--No.
2010.09-1273,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,799.762,802.713,"But in such cases, there very often is an administrative remedy--"
2010.09-1273,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,802.713,803.213,--That's true.
2010.09-1273,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,803.213,814.605,"--and the person always -- any individual in the United States can go ask any agency to do anything, and there is even review in instances of a refusal to withhold -- a withholding of action."
2010.09-1273,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,814.605,816.557,There's always an APA action against the Secretary--
2010.09-1273,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,816.557,816.973,Is there here?
2010.09-1273,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,818.023,820.592,"--Well, I think it would be hard to bring an APA action."
2010.09-1273,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,820.592,822.894,What about a False Claims Act action?
2010.09-1273,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,822.894,823.494,Yes.
2010.09-1273,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,829.698,841.506,"Well, to the extent that you're objecting to the disruption of the Secretary, there is disruption when it's a private party bringing a False Claims Act."
2010.09-1273,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,841.506,842.906,"Well, it is not a private party."
2010.09-1273,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,855.813,861.067,"Even if the United States doesn't take over the case, this works to keep them related?"
2010.09-1273,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,861.067,862.0,--Right.
2010.09-1273,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,871.108,876.929,You -- you emphasize that the contract has the language in haec verba of the statute.
2010.09-1273,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,902.294,902.594,Yes.
2010.09-1273,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,903.227,903.662,Yes?
2010.09-1273,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,903.662,912.435,"--If it is not enforced in the statute -- only if, and I think it's significant that plaintiffs always lose under a third-party beneficiary because the bar is so high."
2010.09-1273,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,992.72,999.791,Is this a contract with the Secretary or a contract with the United States executed on behalf of the United States by the Secretary.
2010.09-1273,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,999.791,1010.431,"It is a contract executed by HRSA, the administrator of the agency within, and he or she, whoever the administrator is at the time, enters it on behalf of the Secretary."
2010.09-1273,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1012.714,1015.066,It is in the name of the Secretary?
2010.09-1273,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,1015.066,1019.204,It is in the Pet App. starting at around 169.
2010.09-1273,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1037.147,1037.749,"Thank you, counsel."
2010.09-1273,1,24896,ginger_d__anders,,1048.521,1050.807,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2010.09-1273,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1070.72,1072.153,Is it a contract at all?
2010.09-1273,1,24896,ginger_d__anders,,1072.153,1078.707,--It is not an ordinary contract in that it doesn't give rise to contract rights in the -- in the regulated entities.
2010.09-1273,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1100.405,1107.659,"Well, how do we distinguish between what you call an ordinary contract and this sort of a contract, if it is any kind of contract?"
2010.09-1273,1,24896,ginger_d__anders,,1107.659,1126.807,"Well, I think when the statute directs an agency to enter into an agreement for the sole purpose of memorializing the parties' opt-in to the regulatory scheme and directs what the terms shall be, so here provides statutorily what the reporting requirements will be, that's when the contract is simply a regulatory mechanism."
2010.09-1273,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1126.807,1165.265,"Counsel, are you telling me you're taking -- then you're co-counsel is right; you're agreeing with her totally -- if Congress wrote the statute, said these are the terms we want to give you in a contract, you figure out how to implement and enforce this, the Secretary says I don't have the resources to enforce this, I'm going to write a contract that gives the 340B entities a private cause of action, the manufacturers can take it or leave it, you're taking the position that the Secretary is without authority to do this?"
2010.09-1273,1,24896,ginger_d__anders,,1165.265,1167.8,I think it would be a difficult question.
2010.09-1273,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1180.441,1194.117,"Well, that begs the exception that Justice Alito asked you, which is if we go your route, which is, is this a regulatory or some sort of other contract, how do we tell the difference, and do we need to go that far?"
2010.09-1273,1,24896,ginger_d__anders,,1212.246,1213.313,That's exactly right.
2010.09-1273,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1249.452,1253.573,You mean there's no negotiated element to it?
2010.09-1273,1,24896,ginger_d__anders,,1264.797,1265.43,That's right.
2010.09-1273,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1272.081,1275.717,"You could do this, I guess, by regulation, right?"
2010.09-1273,1,24896,ginger_d__anders,,1275.717,1277.602,I think--
2010.09-1273,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1277.602,1284.389,"Issue a regulation saying manufacturers who participate in this program agree to do, you know, whatever your contract says."
2010.09-1273,1,24896,ginger_d__anders,,1284.389,1286.425,"--I think that would be one way to do it, yes."
2010.09-1273,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1309.306,1332.405,"Could you tell us whether you agree with the Petitioner's argument in part D of its brief that private suits would seriously disrupt the comprehensive statutory scheme, in light of the position that the government has taken in other litigation involving actions brought by States, In re Pharmaceutical Industry Average Wholesale Price Litigation in the District of Massachusetts?"
2010.09-1273,1,24896,ginger_d__anders,,1332.405,1343.713,"We do agree with the Petitioners that permitting third-party beneficiary suits here, if you construe this as a contract, would interfere with the government's ability to administer the statutory scheme."
2010.09-1273,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1366.893,1370.095,You're walking away from your position in the District of Massachusetts?
2010.09-1273,1,24896,ginger_d__anders,,1375.498,1375.748,No.
2010.09-1273,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1402.815,1404.248,An implied cause of action?
2010.09-1273,1,24896,ginger_d__anders,,1406.683,1411.504,--Those are actually State law suits that were involved in the Average Wholesale Price--
2010.09-1273,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1411.504,1417.158,How is that regulatory scheme any different from the one involving the PPA?
2010.09-1273,1,24896,ginger_d__anders,,1417.158,1427.681,"--Well, the Medicaid Act itself gives States an enforce responsibility and says that they are to use their efforts to find fraud and the prosecute it."
2010.09-1273,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1433.185,1438.654,Suppose that the State of California says we would like our counties to be able to enforce this.
2010.09-1273,1,24896,ginger_d__anders,,1439.721,1442.44,--Under the Medicaid Act there would be--
2010.09-1273,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1442.44,1450.546,"Well, suppose that California -- if California wants to say, we could bring this suit like Massachusetts did, you agree, they could."
2010.09-1273,1,24896,ginger_d__anders,,1455.966,1459.001,"--Well, we think it is very different when you have covered entities."
2010.09-1273,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1459.001,1468.607,What's the difference between a State doing its itself through its attorney general and the State saying we would like the county to do it through its county attorney?
2010.09-1273,1,24896,ginger_d__anders,,1468.607,1473.928,"Well, there's consultation with the Federal Government at the front end when the State brings a suit."
2010.09-1273,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1481.914,1495.841,"California comes to you tomorrow and says, the attorney general says, you know, this is a problem, you don't have time to enforce this, there should be some enforcement and we want to enforce it, and, moreover, we would like each county affected to enforce it."
2010.09-1273,1,24896,ginger_d__anders,,1500.126,1504.078,"--Well, in that sort of situation you might be able to have a State law fraud suit."
2010.09-1273,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1504.078,1508.213,I'm trying to analogize it to the Massachusetts one.
2010.09-1273,1,24896,ginger_d__anders,,1522.539,1541.619,"Well, in the covered entity context, the concern is that, because you have so many of them, if you start permitting covered entities to bring suit, this is essentially a preemption question, but you then have 50 different State regimes, State court regimes, put onto, grafted onto, the Medicaid rebate requirements."
2010.09-1273,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1585.732,1590.284,It identified the problem that the individual beneficiaries did not have a remedy?
2010.09-1273,1,24896,ginger_d__anders,,1595.338,1616.417,"--There were -- there were OIG reports raising concerns with oversight and enforcement at a general level, and the way Congress reacted to that was to put in place this administrative remedy which will allow covered entities to bring these claims and will allow HHS to have the first opportunity to determine the meaning of the AMP and best price requirements, and to take into account--"
2010.09-1273,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1616.417,1617.234,Ms. Blatt said nothing has been done.
2010.09-1273,1,24896,ginger_d__anders,,1624.273,1624.923,--Yes.
2010.09-1273,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1639.7,1662.482,"So I understand your position clearly, In a regulatory contract situation like this one the Secretary is without authority to decide he or she can't enforce the statute and to confer expressly by contract third-party beneficiary rights to the -- to the people receiving the benefit?"
2010.09-1273,1,24896,ginger_d__anders,,1677.325,1681.694,--I think it would be difficult to say that the agency would have been totally without authority to do that.
2010.09-1273,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1691.065,1691.899,"Thank you, counsel."
2010.09-1273,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,1702.207,1703.74,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2010.09-1273,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1746.067,1746.85,"Well, wait--"
2010.09-1273,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,1746.85,1748.102,We submit that the answer is no.
2010.09-1273,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1748.102,1764.462,"--Third-party beneficiary rights are part of normal contracts, but the third-party beneficiary has rights under -- under the normal contract only when the parties intend him to have rights."
2010.09-1273,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,1790.262,1797.249,"Justice Scalia, you find the intent in part 2A of the agreement which is set forth in the petition appendix."
2010.09-1273,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1822.631,1823.349,"Yes, you didn't hear my question."
2010.09-1273,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,1838.525,1839.842,"Well, that's not the standard, Justice Scalia."
2010.09-1273,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1839.842,1840.175,"Well, I--"
2010.09-1273,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,1840.175,1859.772,"The standard for a third-party beneficiary as set forth in the restatement and as recognized by this Court is whether or not the parties objectively intended to create intended third-party beneficiaries whose right to bring the suit would enforce the contract, and that's precisely what we have here."
2010.09-1273,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1859.772,1860.722,Could you tell me where--
2010.09-1273,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1860.722,1873.413,"Mr. Frederick, I thought when this case went back to the -- to the district court the -- the agency's position was, this is a total surprise to us, 14,000 suits or whatever it is."
2010.09-1273,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,1883.638,1884.738,The 340B entities.
2010.09-1273,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1884.738,1891.659,--We never envisioned making them beneficiaries and -- and allowing them to sue.
2010.09-1273,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,1897.813,1904.984,The government cannot argue for subjective intent of an agreement written 18 years ago.
2010.09-1273,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1914.49,1920.227,"Well, I -- I don't understand why what Justice Scalia said isn't the same as what you said."
2010.09-1273,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,1937.955,1938.255,Okay.
2010.09-1273,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1988.971,1989.671,Could there be--
2010.09-1273,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,1989.671,1992.504,That bargain was the discount.
2010.09-1273,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2002.729,2003.829,"--Well, could there be--"
2010.09-1273,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2003.829,2004.764,--Third-party beneficiaries -- I'm sorry.
2010.09-1273,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2004.764,2026.344,"--Could there be a third-party -- a suit by an intended beneficiary and a purported intended beneficiary, if it is clear that Congress intended to the extent it can intend something for those beneficiaries to get the benefit of the price, but did not intend for them to be able to sue?"
2010.09-1273,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2026.344,2027.66,Yes.
2010.09-1273,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2027.66,2029.562,So if there were--
2010.09-1273,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2029.562,2043.222,"I think indirectly here, Justice Alito, that the patients here certainly are incidental beneficiaries, insofar as those who can't afford to pay for the drugs get them for free at the county's expense."
2010.09-1273,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2066.587,2075.877,"--If there were a provision in the law saying expressly there is no private right of action under this statute, would you be able to make the same argument?"
2010.09-1273,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2075.877,2076.16,No.
2010.09-1273,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2094.404,2095.654,Counsel -- I'm sorry.
2010.09-1273,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2116.85,2119.119,That is how the restatement frames it.
2010.09-1273,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2129.475,2130.577,No matter how--
2010.09-1273,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2130.577,2131.493,--because they have access to this market.
2010.09-1273,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2131.493,2151.341,"--No matter how you want to draw this line, if the issue is, what's the objective intents about enforceability, if I look at the PPA, it makes the manufacturer's obligation one-way to the government to provide the pricing information."
2010.09-1273,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2191.382,2193.751,"But that is the key, Justice Sotomayor."
2010.09-1273,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2243.2,2247.135,That's true of -- I was thinking maximum resale price maintenance.
2010.09-1273,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2288.262,2309.978,"--Number one, there's no evidence that Congress intended there to be a departure from normal operating contract principles, and this Court, in Winstar, in Mobil Oil, in Jackson Transit, in Central Airlines, all said that when Congress uses contracts or agreements, it intends to incorporate the full cluster of the common law rights as they've existed."
2010.09-1273,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2351.888,2353.072,"Well, which way does that cut?"
2010.09-1273,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2373.468,2374.051,Well--
2010.09-1273,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2374.051,2378.955,That strikes me as an argument in favor of leaving the enforcement with the Secretary.
2010.09-1273,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2378.955,2391.43,"--No, I think it is an argument that may misunderstand some of the benefits that class action practice can provide, where there is a uniform way of analyzing the problem, because these prices, Mr. Chief Justice--"
2010.09-1273,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2391.43,2392.549,"It doesn't have to be a class action, does it?"
2010.09-1273,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2392.549,2393.415,"--Well, it doesn't."
2010.09-1273,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2404.004,2405.772,That's why it was brought as a class action?
2010.09-1273,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2405.772,2422.651,"--Well, it was brought as a class action because the County of Santa Clara stands in exactly the same position as the other 57 counties of California and the other counties in the United States who are overpaying for drugs that the manufacturers are--"
2010.09-1273,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2422.651,2436.042,"What do you think about -- is the -- I'm not sure I'm right at all here, but as I understand the development of this argument today, it is open to you and the other 57 counties to go to the State AG, and you say, you bring the lawsuit, okay?"
2010.09-1273,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2446.43,2464.625,"--I don't know that the State, because these are entities that are not defined in the agreement -- this is a different agreement than under the Medicaid rebate agreement, which is set forth in the joint appendix, where the States are the third-party beneficiaries of those agreements."
2010.09-1273,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2506.286,2520.961,"I thought it was because the States have been given a role in the statute itself, where the 340B entities have not."
2010.09-1273,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2546.213,2561.888,"Justice Ginsburg, I don't think that was the basis for Judge Saris's opinion in the District of Massachusetts, which looked at the third-party beneficiary theory of the States in giving them a place at the table and bringing these kinds of claims."
2010.09-1273,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2595.109,2597.811,--But the government's footnote doesn't -- doesn't rely on the contract.
2010.09-1273,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2635.936,2636.519,--Well--
2010.09-1273,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2636.519,2640.221,And here the entities you're representing are not.
2010.09-1273,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2640.221,2651.362,"--Justice Scalia, and that is why resort to the normal canons of construction that this Court has long applied to government contracts is what is most pertinent here."
2010.09-1273,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2695.558,2698.927,"A big -- a big difference, it seems to me, Mr. Frederick, is that the States are sovereign."
2010.09-1273,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2719.506,2737.301,"Well, Justice Scalia, I think if you took that argument to its logical extreme, you would have come to a different answer in the Arthur Andersen case, where there, you recognized a third-party beneficiary's right to invoke a statute to get an arbitration agreement upheld."
2010.09-1273,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2765.968,2770.853,"That's Miree, that's 1977."
2010.09-1273,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2804.041,2814.782,"Well, let me address that directly, Mr. Chief Justice, because Justice Rehnquist, who was not any fan of implied rights of action, was the author for the Court's opinion in the Miree decision."
2010.09-1273,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2814.782,2822.138,And that was pretty well -- that analysis was certainly consistent with the established jurisprudence in this area then.
2010.09-1273,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2835.379,2838.83,"We're not asking you to imply a private right of action, Mr. Chief Justice."
2010.09-1273,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2842.718,2844.318,"The result is the same, Mr. Frederick."
2010.09-1273,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2909.641,2915.529,--A contract is a voluntary agreement entered into between the drug manufacturer and the Secretary.
2010.09-1273,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2929.788,2934.34,But the statute wouldn't apply to someone who doesn't want to be in the program.
2010.09-1273,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2934.34,2948.166,"Justice Ginsburg, those cases all involve the imposition of duties on the part of an entity or actor out in society."
2010.09-1273,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2963.692,2969.096,It is the same situation with the states under spending clause legislation.
2010.09-1273,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2979.387,2981.637,"But the remedy is different, Mr. Chief Justice."
2010.09-1273,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2991.611,3004.502,"Whatever you're saying, that's all we're talking about, we are told that computing the price is a very intricate business."
2010.09-1273,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,3028.534,3030.653,And there are two ways to calculate it.
2010.09-1273,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3057.868,3059.136,--control over them.
2010.09-1273,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,3061.236,3070.492,"--Well, no, the difference in a qui tam case, as your question earlier to my colleague earlier acknowledged, Justice Ginsburg, is the government doesn't have to intervene in a False Claims Act case."
2010.09-1273,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3184.383,3206.732,"You take the position that nothing has changed as a result of the new legislation, that is, Ms. Anders told us that this statute told us that this statute's going -- to become effective, there's going to be procedures, better procedures than there were before."
2010.09-1273,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,3215.386,3220.89,"We don't know, Justice Ginsburg, is the simple and plainest answer I can give you."
2010.09-1273,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3281.364,3282.597,"Thank you, Mr. Frederick."
2010.09-1273,3,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,3284.982,3286.299,Yes.
2010.09-1273,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3434.614,3436.347,"Thank you, counsel, counsel."
