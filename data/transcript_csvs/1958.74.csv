1958.74,0,23205,eugene_stanley,,23.6,29.806,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1958.74,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,238.846,241.508,"Where these men, where these men ever indictment themselves --"
1958.74,0,23205,eugene_stanley,,241.508,247.582,"No sir, these men will not under indictment either in the State Court or in the Federal Court."
1958.74,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,249.921,258.515,Were they notoriously designated or intended to be accused?
1958.74,0,23205,eugene_stanley,,258.515,260.353,I cannot say that but they were --
1958.74,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,260.353,267.517,Does the record show that they were in the mind of prosecutor equal to be prosecuted?
1958.74,0,23205,eugene_stanley,,267.517,279.89,"Well the record does show this, it bears out this fact, but doesn't show exactly what Your Honor Mr. Justice Frankfurter asks, but it is an admitted fact that these two men had been engaged in the operation of lotteries for years."
1958.74,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,335.636,340.216,"Do they say what that collaboration, cooperation consisted of?"
1958.74,0,23205,eugene_stanley,,340.216,359.778,"They said this, they did not know if Your Honor please the details of that collaboration and assistance, but they did say this that the state district attorney for the Parish of Orleans Mr. Hubert had held conferences with the United States attorney regarding public bribery on the part of members of the New Orleans police department, the record bears that out."
1958.74,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,365.875,370.445,What is the bearing of that fact on the issue that you are presenting here?
1958.74,0,23205,eugene_stanley,,370.445,377.045,Well the bearing of that fact is this if Your Honors please that I would just if Your Honor would just permit me to make the statement.
1958.74,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,377.045,378.493,You just go your own way?
1958.74,0,23205,eugene_stanley,,378.493,386.385,"I will just say this Your Honor please, their pleas were denied and they were fined a $100 in 10 days and exhausted all remedies in the State Court."
1958.74,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,454.122,455.21,Where was that held?
1958.74,0,23205,eugene_stanley,,455.21,459.843,"That held if Your Honor please in Ballmann v. Fagin, 200 United States, Page --"
1958.74,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,459.843,463.368,That was held there?
1958.74,0,23205,eugene_stanley,,465.797,466.677,I beg your pardon.
1958.74,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,466.677,468.674,I asked you whether that was held?
1958.74,0,23205,eugene_stanley,,468.674,477.009,I -- that's on Page 2 of my supplemental brief.
1958.74,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,493.188,494.188,That's minority rule.
1958.74,0,23205,eugene_stanley,,494.188,495.65,That was -- minority rule.
1958.74,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,496.61,500.389,I thought we still differentiate between a court decision and a dissent.
1958.74,0,23205,eugene_stanley,,500.389,501.195,I beg your pardon sir.
1958.74,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,501.195,507.535,"I thought we still differentiate between court decision and dissent, but apparently not?"
1958.74,0,23205,eugene_stanley,,507.535,509.484,I am at little hard at hearing if Your Honor please.
1958.74,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,509.484,516.552,You say it's the minority view and then don't assert it was held here so I want to know which it is or are they all the same.
1958.74,0,23205,eugene_stanley,,516.552,521.506,"I would say, I would stand corrected and say that that is a minority rule sir."
1958.74,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,664.542,675.903,Well it's because of that I think my brother Brennan asked you what preciously was what you call collaboration between state and federal officials and you said that that you didn't know about that.
1958.74,0,23205,eugene_stanley,,675.903,676.939,I said.
1958.74,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,676.939,680.327,Before you said a constitutional right you must have some basis in the record.
1958.74,0,23205,eugene_stanley,,680.327,726.327,"Well if Your Honor please this is the, this is my position briefly in a nutshell where a state official collaborates with the federal officials in an effort to obtain -- obtain testimony and where that state official visits that federal official and collaborates and confers with him and cooperates with him in an investigation with said federal official is conducting and wherein he had already secured indictment that that state official is to all intents and purposes acting as a federal official and is barred by the same restrictions and the same limitations which the federal laws drape around the shoulders of the federal official himself."
1958.74,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,726.327,735.822,"You mean that the only way in which you can avoid this is that state prosecutors, United States attorney insulate themselves against one another, is that it?"
1958.74,0,23205,eugene_stanley,,735.822,755.259,"Well I say this, if Your Honor please, no deference in respect to Your Honor that the only way you could avoid it if the federal prosecutor is seeking to obtain evidence for the purpose of prosecuting men in the federal court, he should obtain this evidence through the investigating officials of the proper United States department."
1958.74,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,768.443,771.177,I am not suggesting that you are not right.
1958.74,0,23205,eugene_stanley,,785.361,793.986,Well if Your Honor please I know that nobody can show what went on between the United States attorney and the United – and state attorney --
1958.74,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,793.986,807.474,"Only that case is here and that was shown, you then held that the federal authorities use the state authorities engaging and then hide themselves behind them, so that's merely a sham and a front."
1958.74,0,23205,eugene_stanley,,812.107,812.408,Yes.
1958.74,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,812.408,830.73,"We held the testimony thus secured, or in fact secured by the federal authorities in violation of the Fifth Amendment, but a buck-shot charge that federal attorneys and state attorneys talk to each other that he made lunch together therefore invalidate every action by the state authority to something else."
1958.74,0,23205,eugene_stanley,,830.73,834.62,Well that's a matter that Your Honors are going to have to eventually determine.
1958.74,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,834.62,837.602,Well we can only determine it on the basis of the record.
1958.74,0,23205,eugene_stanley,,837.602,840.996,"Well we might, we made the record as we best could."
1958.74,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,908.454,913.303,They did not have Federalism (Inaudible).
1958.74,0,23205,eugene_stanley,,913.303,914.045,Beg your pardon sir?
1958.74,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,914.045,920.784,They did not have a constitutional federal result holding this the basis of holding (Inaudible)
1958.74,0,23205,eugene_stanley,,920.784,924.391,"Well some of the, well I won't detail with your honor please."
1958.74,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,924.391,926.055,That's true isn't it?
1958.74,0,23205,eugene_stanley,,926.055,935.655,"Yes that's correct, yes there as no federalism, there was no federalism in the two (Inaudible) in the British empire."
1958.74,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,935.655,938.829,"And the chancellor, they exercise the chancellor's discretion."
1958.74,0,23205,eugene_stanley,,938.829,939.541,Right sir.
1958.74,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,939.541,944.558,"It's another thing, but you are making a constitutional claim."
1958.74,0,23205,eugene_stanley,,944.558,967.751,"Now there are a number of a state cases what effect those state cases have on Your Honor, will have on Your Honors I am unable to say, which have held that a defendant in a contempt proceeding cannot be, say -- of contempt if the evidence to forge was served as a basis for a federal prosecution."
1958.74,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1051.315,1057.289,"Well this argument does not rest on any collaboration then between the state and federal officials, but --"
1958.74,0,23205,eugene_stanley,,1057.289,1057.526,I wish --
1958.74,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1057.526,1064.87,Only the fact that they were in their affairs or actually under enquiry by the federal authority?
1958.74,0,23205,eugene_stanley,,1064.87,1077.941,The basis of petitioners' appeal Your Honor Mr. Justice is not only the collaboration between two officials at the state official for intents and purposes were the federal officials.

1958.74,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1400.409,1403.817,"It has not been put in narrative form reform by stipulation, is that correct?"

1958.74,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1414.259,1415.848,"That's what I'm asking, all right."
1958.74,1,36898,milo_b_williams,,1415.848,1418.656,Not in narrative form.
1958.74,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1513.527,1524.239,"But that only would relate, the point you are now making relates to the extent of immunity for prosecution by Louisiana in the state courts, in any event it wouldn't go to federal immunity?"
1958.74,1,36898,milo_b_williams,,1524.239,1557.312,"Yes, we say this because throwing that aside would be a violation of his rights of due process of law under the Fourteenth Amendment sir, plus what those un-enumerated rights listed in the Ninth Amendment, which there is jurisprudence to the effect applies to these states as well as the federal government, as you know there is jurisprudence to the affect that only the first eight amendments apply solely to the federal government."

1958.74,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2079.715,2084.251,Is this a prosecution of what you speak alive?
1958.74,1,36898,milo_b_williams,,2085.29,2088.163,"Which prosecution, you are speaking the matter which is before Your Honors?"

1958.74,1,36898,milo_b_williams,,2095.992,2100.68,I cannot -- my positive knowledge answer that.
1958.74,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2104.634,2107.542,Might make a difference then -- since your argument.
1958.74,1,36898,milo_b_williams,,2107.542,2117.572,"I really don't know, but at the time my brief was written, it was alive, but I believe that they have, some of them have been dismissed."

1958.74,1,36898,milo_b_williams,,2136.572,2137.928,Provided it wasn't --
1958.74,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2137.928,2147.616,"So that if this an alive prosecution and he is convicted, then you have a case as to invalidity on your claim of that conviction."
