2018.17-1299,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.085,7.76,"We'll hear argument this morning in Case 17-1299, Franchise Tax Board of California versus Hyatt. Mr. Waxman."
2018.17-1299,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,7.76,55.04,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The participants in the ratification debates disagreed about whether the new constitution would, or should, subject states to suit in the new courts of the soon-to-be superior sovereign, but they were unanimous in their understanding that states could not be sued in the courts of other states. Edmund Pendleton, chairing the Virginia Convention, proclaimed ""the impossibility of calling a sovereign before the jurisdiction of another sovereign,"" echoing writings and speeches given by Hamilton, Marshall, and Madison, among others."
2018.17-1299,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,59.18,66.05,"Counsel, it's nice that they felt that way, but what we know is they didn't put it in the Constitution."
2018.17-1299,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,92.145,93.05,So --
2018.17-1299,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,93.05,95.51,What is new from --
2018.17-1299,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,95.51,97.14,Are -- you say the original case.
2018.17-1299,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,98.75,99.05,Yes.
2018.17-1299,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,100.64,100.96,Well --
2018.17-1299,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,100.96,106.15,-- in any of the arguments that were raised in Nevada versus Hall that weren't addressed by the Court?
2018.17-1299,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,106.15,109.59,"Well, as we point out -- first of all, what was new --"
2018.17-1299,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,109.59,111.705,I know you say it was wrong.
2018.17-1299,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,113.065,116.44,I -- I want to -- I want to -- I -- I -- I'm not going to harp on the wrongness.
2018.17-1299,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,119.93,122.58,"Well, I know that's your position, but let's --"
2018.17-1299,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,122.58,122.655,Yeah.
2018.17-1299,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,186.93,206.22,"So what do you think is the structure, since most sovereign immunity -- there's a lot of customary law involving it, but, at the essence, and it was this way in the United States for a very long time, recognizing the sovereign immunity of a foreign state was at the discretion of the host state."
2018.17-1299,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,206.22,206.75,So --
2018.17-1299,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,206.75,213.46,"Now the U.S. followed the pattern, but, in the Tate letter, it changed it around."
2018.17-1299,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,239.235,242.32,I don't know what you're talking about. (Laughter.)
2018.17-1299,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,242.32,243.375,That there -- yeah.
2018.17-1299,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,291.08,291.33,Okay.
2018.17-1299,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,366.47,367.27,But just so I understand you --
2018.17-1299,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,367.27,369.63,-- wild west of international law.
2018.17-1299,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,369.63,385.95,"Mr. Waxman, just so I understand you, are you saying that the states, pre the Constitution, were in the same position as foreign nations? In other words, it was -- their immunity then was a matter of comity, rather than as -- a matter of legal requirement? Is that correct?"
2018.17-1299,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,385.95,458.17,"So my view is -- my view is -- and I think this is -- this is well recognized in the Court's cases -- that prior to -- certainly, prior to the Articles of Confederation, but, you know, in any event, prior to the Constitution, the states stood in respect to each other and had obligations under the law of nations. And the law of nations, you know, it's true that the -- in essence, the law of nation obligation to not haul an unconsenting sovereign into your courts was unenforceable, and it's true that this Court has referred to it as, therefore, in effect, a matter of comity. And states were in that situation. But this Court explained in First National City Bank versus the Bank of China and in the Sabbatino versus Cuba case that -- and it's reflected in The Schooner Exchange itself, that what comity meant was that there was no obligation to adhere to -- to apply that or any other law of nations except with respect to friendly nations that the sovereign recognized."
2018.17-1299,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,458.17,458.51,What do you --
2018.17-1299,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,458.51,463.36,And those -- that certainly characterized the -- the states of the union.
2018.17-1299,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,501.47,511.58,"It's odd then that Marshall didn't say that in Schooner McFaddon, nor did Joseph Story in Santissima Trinidad or whatever it is, nor did Vattel."
2018.17-1299,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,528.56,528.69,Yes.
2018.17-1299,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,528.69,529.73,-- that's what they said.
2018.17-1299,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,529.73,530.17,Yes.
2018.17-1299,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,530.44,532.9,I didn't find language like raw power.
2018.17-1299,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,598.625,599.03,With --
2018.17-1299,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,599.03,609.2,"And what in the Constitution, it would have to be something that in this respect makes them less sovereign, what is it that says you can't have an outlier?"
2018.17-1299,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,609.2,615.39,"So, when you say, you know, if some states refuse to recognize that principle, well, that was one thing."
2018.17-1299,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,629.12,631.46,I know they didn't. That isn't quite my question.
2018.17-1299,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,631.46,632.0,"Well, but --"
2018.17-1299,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,632.0,633.335,"Of course, they didn't."
2018.17-1299,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,633.335,633.525,So --
2018.17-1299,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,633.525,637.325,Almost all countries recognize sovereign immunity.
2018.17-1299,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,647.855,648.46,So --
2018.17-1299,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,648.46,656.205,"And the answer of Marshall, Story, Vattel, no, you don't have to."
2018.17-1299,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,656.205,697.975,"So I think Vattel, who was quoted and referenced in -- I'm going to talk about Vattel, The Schooner Exchange, and then the point of what changed when the Constitution was adopted, and then where in the text of the Constitution I'm citing my authority, which I -- I forgot to address. Vattel and other commentators at the time whose jurisprudence was also referenced in the ratification debate held -- stated that sovereign immunity was a mandatory limit on the power of one sovereign to adjudicate another's claim, another -- to adjudicate claims against another sovereign."
2018.17-1299,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,765.52,769.79,"Well, Marshall -- Marshall, who is a pretty good authority -- I happen to know this because we had this case before."
2018.17-1299,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,770.97,771.605,You did?
2018.17-1299,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,771.605,791.13,"-- look at quotes 4, Vattel, 472, okay, and what he says Vattel says -- I never read all those pages, I read some of them -- he says Vattel says that the consent of a foreign sovereign may be implied through a tacit convention, but it suggests that it rested upon consent."
2018.17-1299,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,791.13,791.66,So -- and --
2018.17-1299,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,791.66,793.65,It says that consent may be applied.
2018.17-1299,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,793.65,823.11,"Yes, and with respect, Justice Breyer, what The Schooner Exchange says several times in Justice Mar -- Chief Justice Marshall's opinion, is that the state -- sovereign states are deemed to have consented to recognize the sovereign immunity of other sovereigns in those instances in which, and that are enumerated, and he explains why a visiting warship of a friendly nation is one of those things."
2018.17-1299,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,823.11,824.4,"Well, I don't want to waste time."
2018.17-1299,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,824.4,824.68,Mister --
2018.17-1299,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,824.68,826.04,"Now, even if -- even if I'm -- oh, I'm sorry."
2018.17-1299,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,826.495,827.56,"Yeah, sure."
2018.17-1299,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,827.56,849.63,"Even if I'm wrong about that, the fact of the matter is that in the plan of convention and in the text itself, the states, in order to form a more perfect union, surrendered all of the retaliatory means that nations would have had in order to deter or enforce --"
2018.17-1299,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,849.63,850.62,"Well, that's what I understood --"
2018.17-1299,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,850.62,853.215,"-- or punish violations, and --"
2018.17-1299,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,853.215,871.33,"Mr. Waxman, that's what I understood your basic argument to be, right, that there was this system of comity, it all worked very well, essentially at least in part because states knew that they had all these powers that they could use against each other, and then they gave up those powers at the convention."
2018.17-1299,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,877.21,878.16,"Yes, a constitutional --"
2018.17-1299,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,878.16,891.52,"And I guess I just find myself thinking that, I mean, sort of, you know, going back to Justice Sotomayor's question, what's the evidence of that, because this is a gigantic constitute -- you know, constitutional debate."
2018.17-1299,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,912.015,912.75,What was --
2018.17-1299,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,912.75,925.09,"And unless you can show me evidence that that was the trade, I mean, if I could just -- if you would bear with me for one more moment -- Professors Baude and Sachs tell about another trade."
2018.17-1299,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,946.9,985.315,"So I would say the evidence -- I mean, there -- there is a lot of evidence -- I don't think there's any disagreement that the framers intended to constitutionalize fundamental aspects of sovereignty. The reference to the former colonies as states, the reference to in the privileges and immunities clause of citizens of states, the limitation, the express limitations in the Constitution, including Section 10 of Article I, and, of course, the Eleventh Amendment itself, make sense only if the states are sovereign."
2018.17-1299,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,985.315,986.22,"Well, maybe that's --"
2018.17-1299,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,986.22,986.28,Now --
2018.17-1299,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,986.28,1004.675,"-- your answer to this question, but I'm still, you know -- because we are all always very vigilant not to read things into the Constitution that can't be found in the text, I'm waiting for the answer to Justice Sotomayor's question about what provisions of the Constitution you would point to."
2018.17-1299,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1004.675,1055.55,"So I -- I've -- I would point to the provisions of the Constitution that are enumerated by Justice Scalia in his opinion for the Court in Printz, which were reiterated again by Justice Kennedy for the Court in Alden, some of which I have -- I have recognized, I -- I have -- I have already recited. The -- the -- preserving fundamental aspects of sovereignty yet withdrawing the ability to protect sovereignty vis-a-vis either nations or other states was in -- in exchange for a guarantee that the then law of nations -- the then principle of sovereignty under the law of nations would be protected by the Constitution and enforced by this Court. Justice Kagan has referred to it as a one-for-one bargain."
2018.17-1299,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1094.67,1095.53,Given how --
2018.17-1299,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1095.53,1096.67,-- that I -- I -- I mean --
2018.17-1299,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1096.67,1123.59,"Given -- given how important this is, as you describe, why is it not in the text of the Constitution in your view, given that the Constitution is a document, in my view, of majestic specificity. It's got a lot of specific details on very minute things, and this issue which you say rightly is so important, but then somehow was not mentioned in the text of the Constitution."
2018.17-1299,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1123.59,1172.78,"Well, I mean, this -- this Court has been explaining at least since Hans that the principle of sovereign immunity -- of state sovereign immunity was so fundamental that it is a postulate that underlies and gives meaning to other provisions of the Constitution, including, as -- as then Justice Rehnquist explained in his dissent in Nevada versus Hall, the Eleventh Amendment itself. But, in this regard, Justice Kavanaugh, this principle of state sovereign immunity is no different than Chief Justice Marshall's recognition in McCulloch versus Maryland of the constitutional principle of intergovernmental immunity, of the principle against commandeering that's recognized by the Court in Printz and New York versus United States, in the principle --"
2018.17-1299,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1172.78,1173.275,Mr. Waxman --
2018.17-1299,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1173.275,1176.265,-- the equal footing doctrine and the Dormant Commerce Clause.
2018.17-1299,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1197.32,1207.52,"Mr. Waxman, when the states disagreed with us in Chisholm about the ability to haul states into federal court, the states amended the Constitution."
2018.17-1299,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1233.405,1241.72,"Well, that -- that statement, that observation, Justice Sotomayor -- and, by the way, I mean, including California, there are 47 states."
2018.17-1299,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1244.79,1245.39,They've got a lot of --
2018.17-1299,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1245.39,1246.32,But a lot of states --
2018.17-1299,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1246.32,1248.49,-- representatives in the House and in the Senate.
2018.17-1299,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1252.065,1252.76,"You know, Justice --"
2018.17-1299,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1252.76,1256.92,"Except -- but, instead, they're choosing to let us decide --"
2018.17-1299,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1256.92,1257.98,You -- you could have said --
2018.17-1299,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1257.98,1262.88,-- that an individual state doesn't have the right to protect its citizens.
2018.17-1299,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1262.88,1269.17,You could have said exactly the same thing about why Parden shouldn't be overruled.
2018.17-1299,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1287.25,1288.96,But this is a very serious step.
2018.17-1299,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1288.96,1289.08,Yes.
2018.17-1299,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1289.08,1295.305,We are entrenching very directly on the state's right to protect its citizens.
2018.17-1299,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1310.265,1311.36,And counting.
2018.17-1299,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1311.36,1315.885,"Well, that's because of the attorneys, but -- (Laughter.)"
2018.17-1299,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1315.885,1317.32,It's always the attorneys.
2018.17-1299,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1317.32,1318.24,Always the attorneys.
2018.17-1299,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1318.24,1325.41,"Well, and the millions of dollars in costs that the sovereign State of California has expended defending itself."
2018.17-1299,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1440.115,1479.405,"Mr. Waxman, if I could take you back to some of the questions you were previously asking, because I want to give you a chance to sort of give your best argument, which is, you know, given that you're claiming that the system of comity, which was working well for all the states, that this system was converted into a particular constitutional rule at the framing, and a very particular one, because there could have been other ways, as Professors Baude and Sachs suggest, for the states to protect themselves. Given that that's what you're claiming, what is the best -- and I'll -- I'll expand what some of my colleagues had said. You don't have to give me even textual evidence."
2018.17-1299,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1487.435,1487.75,Okay.
2018.17-1299,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1592.355,1603.545,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Chemerinsky."
2018.17-1299,1,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,1603.545,1620.02,"Good morning, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Forty years ago in Nevada versus Hall, this Court held that states may exercise their sovereign power under the Tenth Amendment to define the jurisdiction of the courts to protect their citizens when they're injured, including by other states."
2018.17-1299,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1660.44,1666.96,"Mr. Chemerinsky, your -- Mr. Waxman did point to something that's important."
2018.17-1299,1,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,1689.15,1691.865,"First, comity protects states."
2018.17-1299,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1714.45,1716.76,I -- I just don't see comity being enough.
2018.17-1299,1,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,1752.52,1754.615,"Well, they invaded his property rights."
2018.17-1299,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1760.11,1762.22,But was that in Nevada or in California?
2018.17-1299,1,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,1762.22,1765.365,That was in Nevada at his home they did these things.
2018.17-1299,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1873.9,1895.33,"What do you do with Federalist 81, which said that it was inherent in the nature of sovereignty not to be amenable to the suit of an individual without its consent and said that would remain with the states? That was Hamilton speaking in Federalist 81, reflecting a notion that it's inherent to the nature of sovereignty. Is that incorrect?"
2018.17-1299,1,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,1895.33,1899.21,"No, Your Honor, it's not incorrect, but you must put it in the context in which it's written."
2018.17-1299,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1944.74,1960.0,"But do you think it's plausible that there would be a great concern about a state's being sued in a federal court, which is a more neutral tribunal, but no concern about a state being sued in the state -- in the courts of another state?"
2018.17-1299,1,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,1960.0,1972.08,"Yes, for two reasons, Your Honor. First, the framers were very concerned, especially the anti-federalists were concerned about the powers of this new level of government, the federal courts."
2018.17-1299,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1996.385,2018.24,"But the comity that exists -- well, what is your answer to the -- to the argument that -- that once the United States was formed, either under the articles or under the Constitution, the relationship between the states was entirely different from the relationship among foreign states?"
2018.17-1299,1,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,2018.24,2020.5,"Yes, Your Honor, it was different."
2018.17-1299,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2038.45,2048.19,"You know, if California were a republic, I mean, we had the -- if we had the California republic, which is something some people in California would like -- (Laughter.)"
2018.17-1299,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2048.19,2054.225,"-- it would have a lot of leverage over Nevada that it doesn't have now, wouldn't it?"
2018.17-1299,1,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,2054.225,2056.14,"Well, yes and no, Your Honor."
2018.17-1299,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2056.52,2059.815,"We could have, you know, it overwhelms it in every respect."
2018.17-1299,1,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,2068.14,2072.555,I think Nevada might already feel that California overwhelms it too much. (Laughter.)
2018.17-1299,1,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,2072.555,2086.4,"But, in terms of international, I go back to Justice Breyer's point with regard to his questions to Mr. Waxman. The Schooner Exchange case said that under the national law, the only protection a foreign country had on another sovereign was based on comity."
2018.17-1299,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2094.55,2111.1,"Well, the remedy for the failure to accord comity at international law was recognized to be war. What remedy do the states have under your view if a state chooses not to extend comity to a sister state?"
2018.17-1299,1,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,2111.1,2122.285,"Well, they certainly have remedy in this Court based on Hyatt II. The damages would be limited to the amount that the forum state would be liable. And, second, they have a perspective remedy that's quite important."
2018.17-1299,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2129.04,2131.65,That requires an agreement of the other states.
2018.17-1299,1,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,2131.65,2144.005,"Well, for example, to go back to Justice Alito's question, California and Nevada could enter into a compact any time they want that they will not allow suits in their courts against the other state."
2018.17-1299,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2145.55,2148.53,"Well, but you have to assume that the -- the two states are willing to do that."
2018.17-1299,1,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,2167.465,2171.1,"Well, Your Honor, that's true, but then you go back to the Tenth Amendment."
2018.17-1299,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2320.45,2322.23,Just on the stare decisis question --
2018.17-1299,1,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,2322.23,2322.44,"Yes, please."
2018.17-1299,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2322.44,2355.325,"-- wouldn't -- wouldn't it be relevant, though, that the case law that's developed subsequent to Nevada versus Hall seems quite inconsistent with the principles in the majority opinion and more consistent with the principles in Justice Rehnquist's dissent and the series of cases that you describe? In other words, if we were five years after Nevada v. Hall being asked to overrule it, that might have been a harder hill to climb, but now that you have all these other cases, that might leave Nevada versus Hall seeming an outlier. How do you respond to that argument?"
2018.17-1299,1,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,2355.325,2356.675,I -- I disagree.
2018.17-1299,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2426.765,2442.93,"How -- how should we think about the fact that 47 or 45 or whatever it is states have joined in this amicus brief, indicating that they think that their sovereign immunity power is a good deal more important than the power that you've referenced to protect their own citizens in their own courts?"
2018.17-1299,1,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,2442.93,2449.79,The attorney generals of those states filed a brief saying they don't want to have to defend suits.
2018.17-1299,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2475.735,2476.21,"Well, it's a pretty --"
2018.17-1299,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2476.21,2477.535,Have there been attempts --
2018.17-1299,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2477.535,2485.935,It's a pretty remarkable assertion that we shouldn't understand representations of the states' attorneys general to represent the views of the state.
2018.17-1299,1,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,2504.56,2522.02,"Your Honor, the attorney general is an officer of the state, but I don't necessarily know that in filing the brief in this Court, it's reflecting the views of the state legislatures or the judiciaries. The question is, do those state governments want to give up the power to define the jurisdiction of their courts and provide remedies?"
2018.17-1299,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2522.02,2528.555,Should we regard the submissions of the Solicitor General here as reflecting the views of the United States or simply the Solicitor General?
2018.17-1299,1,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,2528.555,2532.155,The Solicitor General is representing the United States Government.
2018.17-1299,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2550.36,2557.49999995,Have there been attempts by the states to -- to enter into agreements of this sort?
2018.17-1299,1,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,2557.49999995,2562.78,"Not that I'm aware of, Your Honor, but I think that probably reflects this isn't a serious problem."
2018.17-1299,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2586.665,2606.27500005,"Would the 47 states that don't like this rule make an effort to find things that has -- have happened to their citizens in this state caused by Nevada, and so they all start suing Nevada in their own courts, perhaps Nevada's attitude would change. (Laughter.)"
2018.17-1299,1,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,2606.27500005,2610.3,"It might, Your Honor, but the fact that that hasn't happened in 40 years --"
2018.17-1299,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2610.3,2610.84,Not a problem?
2018.17-1299,1,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,2610.84,2615.19,-- since Nevada versus Hall leads one to the conclusion it's not a problem.
2018.17-1299,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2635.06,2638.045,"I'm sorry, he could have gone to the California courts."
2018.17-1299,1,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,2638.045,2647.81,"No, he couldn't have gone to the California courts because California gives sovereign immunity to itself and has a statute that gives broad protection. In fact, Hyatt I --"
2018.17-1299,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2647.81,2655.925,There's no -- there's no administrative process against the -- the tax assessment that was laid against him?
2018.17-1299,1,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,2655.925,2661.35,"Well, there was an administrative proceeding with regard to the tax assessment, something that's been pending since the 1990s."
2018.17-1299,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2662.31,2665.89,That -- that actually is a factual question I had.
2018.17-1299,1,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,2668.725,2669.87,"Yes, Your Honor."
2018.17-1299,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2716.38,2732.08,Could the Nevada court have adjudicated the factual premises? Could he have brought some sort of suit in Nevada to adjudicate whether he was a resident of California or not or to find that he had no tax liability?
2018.17-1299,1,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,2732.08,2743.92,"I think a challenge to tax liability would be different, in part because of the Tax Injunction Act, and also because of a different principle of comity under Fair Assessment in Real Estate versus McNary."
2018.17-1299,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2755.195,2775.465,"Counsel, what do you do about the Petitioner's argument that it's incongruous that Indian tribes have this sort of immunity while states don't? The -- the -- Chief Justice Marshall, who we've heard about, described the tribes, of course, as quasi-sovereigns, yet the states are recognized as -- as sovereigns."
2018.17-1299,1,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,2781.615,2788.885,"Two responses, Your Honor. First, this Court has never decided whether state courts can hear tort claims against Indian tribes."
2018.17-1299,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2807.55,2810.955,So your answer is throw the Indian tribes under the bus? Well --
2018.17-1299,1,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,2810.955,2813.63,"No, Your Honor, I'm saying that it's an unresolved question."
2018.17-1299,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2854.385,2858.7,The doctrine of stare decisis serves many valuable purposes.
2018.17-1299,1,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,2872.145,2889.92,"Well, I'd go back to this Court's decision in the Hilton versus South Carolina case, and this Court there said adherence to precedent promotes stability, predictability, and respect for judicial authority. And this was a case about overturning precedent in the area of constitutional law. This is about stability of law."
2018.17-1299,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2923.13,2924.345,That -- that's often --
2018.17-1299,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2924.345,2948.495,"I -- I want to follow that up, because this is a general question I have and I'd like to call on your knowledge on this, is this imaginary or not, what I'm about to say, that every time we overrule a case, it's like a little chink in an armor, because lawyers have to use our cases to talk to clients, and the client doesn't like what he's hearing."
2018.17-1299,1,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,2981.14,2982.14,"Yes, Your Honor."
2018.17-1299,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2982.14,2985.04,I thought that would be your answer. (Laughter.)
2018.17-1299,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2985.04,2988.5,"Yes, I'm making it up out of my imagination or it's true?"
2018.17-1299,1,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,2988.5,2988.95,No.
2018.17-1299,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2993.93,3022.775,"Well, Mr. Chemerinsky, do you think that the public would have greater respect for an institution that says, you know, we're never going to admit we made a mistake, because we said it and we decided it, we're going to stick to it even if we think it's wrong, or an institution that says, well, you know, we're generally going to stick to what we've done, but we're not perfect, and when we look back and we think we made a big mistake, we're going to go back and correct it. Which kind of institution would they respect more?"
2018.17-1299,1,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,3022.775,3026.68,"Of course, this Court should overrule precedent at times."
2018.17-1299,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3046.38,3092.385,"But then the question is how we figure out what the compelling reason is, and that's very difficult. And you say nothing has changed. That's true in a lot of cases where the Court has nonetheless overruled a prior decision. And so how are we supposed to think about it? Is it enough, for example, if we think it's egregiously wrong and the prior decision has severe practical consequences and there's no real reliance interest at stake? Is that enough? How to apply that to a particular case is hard, but what -- what I just said in terms of egregiously wrong, severe practical consequences, no real reliance, is that enough in your view to overrule?"
2018.17-1299,1,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,3092.385,3100.61,"I think egregiously wrong, no practical consequence to overruling precedent, certainly go a long way to indicating there is a compelling reason for doing so."
2018.17-1299,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3108.83,3115.155,"Well, if we applied that strictly, a lot of cases that everyone agrees should be overruled would not have been overruled."
2018.17-1299,1,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,3119.47,3121.45,But I think it's a starting point in the analysis.
2018.17-1299,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3210.805,3213.955,"Thank you, counsel. Four minutes, Mr. Waxman."
2018.17-1299,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3213.955,3248.94,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. In McCulloch versus Maryland, Chief Justice Marshall announced for the Court the constitutional principle, the atextual constitutional principle of intergovernmental immunity because, as he explained, the power of one sovereign to tax another is the power to destroy. Today, Hall versus Nevada stands as the only thing that states can do to each other, the power to render judgments against states that, when they entered the union, were effectively bankrupt."
2018.17-1299,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3437.88,3439.325,"Thank you, Mr. Waxman, counsel."
