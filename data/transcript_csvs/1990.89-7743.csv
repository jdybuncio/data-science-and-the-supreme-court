1990.89-7743,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.272,"We'll hear argument now in No. 89-7743, Thaddeus Donald Edmonson v. Leesville Concrete Company, Inc.--"
1990.89-7743,0,30018,james_e_doyle,,11.622,14.074,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.89-7743,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,128.282,135.087,"Is that the way it's done in that State, you go to the judge's chambers to exercise the peremptory?"
1990.89-7743,0,30018,james_e_doyle,,135.087,137.889,"--That was the practice of this particular Federal district judge, Justice Kennedy."
1990.89-7743,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,150.179,154.75,And the challenges for cause have been exhausted in open court?
1990.89-7743,0,30018,james_e_doyle,,154.75,159.654,"The challenges... there was one challenge for cause in this case, and it was done in open court."
1990.89-7743,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,162.772,166.308,The routine he employed was that the challenges for cause were in open court?
1990.89-7743,0,30018,james_e_doyle,,166.308,166.691,--Yes.
1990.89-7743,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,166.691,168.676,And then the peremptory challenges were in chambers?
1990.89-7743,0,30018,james_e_doyle,,168.676,172.295,"Well, the peremptory challenges were made known in chambers."
1990.89-7743,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,339.186,341.803,This is essentially Judge Rubin's approach--
1990.89-7743,0,30018,james_e_doyle,,341.803,342.055,"Yes, sir."
1990.89-7743,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,342.055,344.138,"--in a panel decision anyway, isn't it?"
1990.89-7743,0,30018,james_e_doyle,,344.138,345.09,"That's correct, Justice Blackmun."
1990.89-7743,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,346.423,353.327,"Mr. Doyle, I suppose if it's a constitutional argument you're making, you would apply equally to state courts?"
1990.89-7743,0,30018,james_e_doyle,,353.327,353.794,"Yes, sir."
1990.89-7743,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,353.794,359.065,"So if a State court did its business in a different way than a Federal court, that wouldn't make any difference?"
1990.89-7743,0,30018,james_e_doyle,,359.065,363.1,The State court would be bound by the same equal protection considerations.
1990.89-7743,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,371.372,377.526,I also assume it wouldn't... would it just apply to racial discrimination?
1990.89-7743,0,30018,james_e_doyle,,379.576,384.263,"We take the position, Justice Scalia, that Batson should be adopted as Batson now exists."
1990.89-7743,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,388.398,393.119,"Um-hum, um-hum."
1990.89-7743,0,30018,james_e_doyle,,393.119,405.11,"The first question we submit that should be addressed is whether those who participate in an inherently governmental function, that is, selecting a jury that is going to try and hear a case in a Federal courtroom, engage in governmental action during this process."
1990.89-7743,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,456.292,458.361,What about the decision not to have a jury at all?
1990.89-7743,0,30018,james_e_doyle,,467.015,470.55,"No, that's a joint decision made by two private parties."
1990.89-7743,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,470.55,472.783,--Why... how do you shift back and forth?
1990.89-7743,0,30018,james_e_doyle,,481.858,488.261,"I think, Justice Scalia, that the decision that he makes when he selects a jury is different from the decision that he makes in other aspects of the trial."
1990.89-7743,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,498.967,502.938,So he decides I want my client tried by a judge instead of by a jury?
1990.89-7743,0,30018,james_e_doyle,,502.938,503.388,That's right.
1990.89-7743,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,503.388,504.804,He's selecting the official.
1990.89-7743,0,30018,james_e_doyle,,504.804,505.154,Well--
1990.89-7743,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,505.154,507.323,He's acting as a... as the Government then.
1990.89-7743,0,30018,james_e_doyle,,508.675,512.46,"--I don't think that would be a Government decision in the same way, because he can't pick the judge."
1990.89-7743,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,513.427,515.162,"Well, but he can pick either judge or jury."
1990.89-7743,0,30018,james_e_doyle,,515.162,515.645,That's correct.
1990.89-7743,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,517.28,520.232,And you say that's the Government... he's making that as a governmental decision then?
1990.89-7743,0,30018,james_e_doyle,,520.232,522.866,--Not when he picks the judge... not when he decides not to have a jury.
1990.89-7743,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,523.352,536.075,"So it would be okay for him to say, well, in this district I think the jury is likely to be black and I know we have a white judge on the docket, and therefore, I'll waive the jury trial."
1990.89-7743,0,30018,james_e_doyle,,538.277,542.646,"--What I'm suggesting to you is if he makes that decision, he not discriminating against black jurors--"
1990.89-7743,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,542.646,543.279,So it's okay?
1990.89-7743,0,30018,james_e_doyle,,543.279,548.067,"--It's okay, because it's not... it doesn't address the same point that's addressed in Batson."
1990.89-7743,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,557.403,560.874,I think it excludes every one of them... every one of the jurors... every one of them.
1990.89-7743,0,30018,james_e_doyle,,560.874,563.39,"But if there's no jury trial, they haven't yet been called."
1990.89-7743,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,570.96,581.285,"What if they had been called into the courtroom, and the plaintiff at the last minute waives a jury trial as having looked at the veniremen, so to speak?"
1990.89-7743,0,30018,james_e_doyle,,581.285,591.373,"I still don't think at that point it would be the same as in Batson, Mr. Chief Justice, because at that point, the stigma which applies to the individual jurors of the minority race is not yet attached."
1990.89-7743,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,600.813,601.396,Mr. Doyle--
1990.89-7743,0,30018,james_e_doyle,,601.396,602.265,Yes?
1990.89-7743,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,602.265,613.387,--in California the... each party is entitled to recuse the judge... you can made that motion only at one point... in the State superior courts.
1990.89-7743,0,30018,james_e_doyle,,619.477,626.963,"I believe that would have the same effect constitutionally, because it would still be the selection of a governmental official."
1990.89-7743,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,753.277,764.335,"Well, Mr. Doyle, is your identification of the private lawyer as a part of a Government operation consistent with our decision in Dodson against Polk County?"
1990.89-7743,0,30018,james_e_doyle,,764.335,775.476,"I think it's a different case from Dodson, Mr. Chief Justice, because in the Polk County v. Dodson case, the only issue reached was whether the public defender acted under color of State law in section 1983."
1990.89-7743,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,783.213,788.717,Do you think it's different... that the Government action can be different for one constitutional provision than for another?
1990.89-7743,0,30018,james_e_doyle,,788.717,789.034,"--No, sir."
1990.89-7743,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,806.595,808.03,Like picking the jury?
1990.89-7743,0,30018,james_e_doyle,,808.03,818.403,"Picking the jury if it... if you accept as a hypothetical premise that the Batson equal protection analysis would apply to a public defender in a defense context, and I'm not reaching that point."
1990.89-7743,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,827.842,852.024,"Mr. Doyle, under your view, in a private, civil action on behalf of, let's say, a plaintiff who was black, would the plaintiff's exercise of peremptory challenges against white perspective jurors be similarly suspect and open to challenge under the Equal Protection Clause?"
1990.89-7743,0,30018,james_e_doyle,,852.024,856.611,Clearly it would under the Equal Protection Clause if that is the limited focus of the analysis.
1990.89-7743,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,866.05,874.823,"But on your argument then, your client's own peremptory challenges would be open to the same attack?"
1990.89-7743,0,30018,james_e_doyle,,874.823,876.106,"--Certainly, if they met--"
1990.89-7743,1,29232,john_s_baker_jr,,1603.607,1607.076,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.89-7743,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1749.954,1753.24,Not that the county didn't involve the selection of a jury?
1990.89-7743,1,29232,john_s_baker_jr,,1753.24,1754.106,--That's true.
1990.89-7743,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1782.759,1794.9,"In Terry v. Adams, the white primary case, we focused on the actions of the members who were voting in the straw poll, did we not?"
1990.89-7743,1,29232,john_s_baker_jr,,1794.9,1795.45,"Yes, but they--"
1990.89-7743,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1795.45,1795.917,Initially?
1990.89-7743,1,29232,john_s_baker_jr,,1795.917,1796.617,"--Sure, but we--"
1990.89-7743,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1796.617,1809.993,"And we then said that if this straw poll is, as a matter of custom and practice, simply a necessary predicate to State action, that we were going to treat it as a State action."
1990.89-7743,1,29232,john_s_baker_jr,,1833.942,1843.648,"--I think that in all of the State action cases, Your Honor, there is always this problem of identifying what the actual actor is actually doing."
1990.89-7743,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1896.265,1896.816,xxx.
1990.89-7743,1,29232,john_s_baker_jr,,1915.679,1922.083,"--Well, I don't think it is in the context of your own decisions regarding the whole line of cases on jury discrimination."
1990.89-7743,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2041.51,2041.877,Counsel--
1990.89-7743,1,29232,john_s_baker_jr,,2041.877,2044.645,That's a quarrel with the statute.
1990.89-7743,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2045.314,2047.097,--Where did the peremptory come from?
1990.89-7743,1,29232,john_s_baker_jr,,2047.097,2049.283,"It comes from Congress, Your Honor."
1990.89-7743,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2049.283,2052.717,And at... Louisiana enforces it?
1990.89-7743,1,29232,john_s_baker_jr,,2052.717,2055.253,"This is a Federal statute, Your Honor."
1990.89-7743,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2056.955,2057.455,"Yeah, I know."
1990.89-7743,1,29232,john_s_baker_jr,,2064.208,2065.225,"Yes, Your Honor."
1990.89-7743,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2065.225,2069.512,And there's a difference [inaudible] between the two.
1990.89-7743,1,29232,john_s_baker_jr,,2069.512,2069.762,But--
1990.89-7743,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2069.762,2076.433,"So if you say that it's State and not Federal, you're still stuck, aren't you?"
1990.89-7743,1,29232,john_s_baker_jr,,2076.433,2081.82,"--Well Your Honor, if this case is decided on constitutional grounds, it certainly has application to the State."
1990.89-7743,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2090.426,2093.628,Are you going to get to Shelley and Kraemer?
1990.89-7743,1,29232,john_s_baker_jr,,2093.628,2095.33,I'll be happy to address Shelley and Kraemer.
1990.89-7743,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2132.67,2133.955,That was the law before Shelley.
1990.89-7743,1,29232,john_s_baker_jr,,2133.955,2134.705,"I'm sorry, Your Honor?"
1990.89-7743,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2134.705,2137.657,That was the law before Shelley.
1990.89-7743,1,29232,john_s_baker_jr,,2140.208,2141.559,"Yes, Your Honor."
1990.89-7743,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2141.559,2146.096,"But Shelley destroyed that, didn't it?"
1990.89-7743,1,29232,john_s_baker_jr,,2146.096,2146.829,"Yes, Your Honor."
1990.89-7743,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2146.829,2149.131,Did Shelley say the judge was enough?
1990.89-7743,1,29232,john_s_baker_jr,,2149.131,2149.764,"Yes, Your Honor."
1990.89-7743,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2150.564,2151.833,And we have a judge here.
1990.89-7743,1,29232,john_s_baker_jr,,2151.833,2152.8,"--Yes, but the judge--"
1990.89-7743,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2152.8,2153.8,And why isn't that enough?
1990.89-7743,1,29232,john_s_baker_jr,,2153.8,2156.552,"--It wasn't just the judge was enough, Your Honor."
1990.89-7743,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2158.82,2161.872,"Well, who could enforce this other than the judge?"
1990.89-7743,1,29232,john_s_baker_jr,,2161.872,2164.974,"--Your Honor, in a State court you wouldn't need the judge to enforce it."
1990.89-7743,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2164.974,2169.128,Who else would try to enforce it?
1990.89-7743,1,29232,john_s_baker_jr,,2169.128,2174.097,"Your Honor, the judge is there and presides over the trial, and to that extent, he governs everything in the trial."
1990.89-7743,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2175.716,2176.216,But that--
1990.89-7743,1,29232,john_s_baker_jr,,2176.216,2181.852,"We're asking, Your Honor, about the action to make the choice."
1990.89-7743,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2189.539,2189.925,--That's right.
1990.89-7743,1,29232,john_s_baker_jr,,2189.925,2190.791,--of the attorney.
1990.89-7743,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2190.791,2194.593,But the judge enforces it.
1990.89-7743,1,29232,john_s_baker_jr,,2194.593,2196.195,The judge is enforcing the statute.
1990.89-7743,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2199.314,2204.099,"He enforces the statute, the Federal statute."
1990.89-7743,1,29232,john_s_baker_jr,,2204.099,2205.318,--He enforces the Federal statute.
1990.89-7743,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2220.495,2237.022,"May ask on the question of the judge's participation, the Seventh Circuit opinion, as I understand it, makes the argument that the judge does have an input into the preemptive challenge process, because he can decide which side challenges first, whether there shall be a writing done simultaneously."
1990.89-7743,1,29232,john_s_baker_jr,,2246.928,2256.501,"--Well, Your Honor, the peremptory is part of the overall process in which the decision on voir dire, whether it is to be done by the judge or whether it's to be done by the jury."
1990.89-7743,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2279.266,2283.884,"He can influence... of course, he can influence that choice in some ways by the way he rules on challenges for cause."
1990.89-7743,1,29232,john_s_baker_jr,,2293.507,2303.381,"--But, Your Honor, the judge has... courts have influence on all kinds of things that we don't attribute State action to or governmental action to because of the decisions of courts."
1990.89-7743,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2303.381,2305.833,What about our case involving the probate court?
1990.89-7743,1,29232,john_s_baker_jr,,2306.183,2306.716,The Tulsa case.
1990.89-7743,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2306.716,2307.216,--Yes.
1990.89-7743,1,29232,john_s_baker_jr,,2307.216,2313.57,"You were very clear in that case, Your Honor, that you had a State statute that didn't give notice except through a private party."
1990.89-7743,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2376.68,2378.946,It's endorsing their right to march--
1990.89-7743,1,29232,john_s_baker_jr,,2378.946,2379.632,--Exactly.
1990.89-7743,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2379.632,2382.448,--which is preserved under the First Amendment.
1990.89-7743,1,29232,john_s_baker_jr,,2382.448,2383.834,"That's right, but not the content."
1990.89-7743,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2384.65,2385.535,"Yes, but that was State action."
1990.89-7743,1,29232,john_s_baker_jr,,2385.535,2394.391,"--the judge is endorsing the congressionally created right to exercise a peremptory, not what is done in the peremptory."
1990.89-7743,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2394.391,2403.247,"Well, but the question is whether or not that consists with the Fourteenth Amendment, which is a constitutional clause which gives the juror an equal right."
1990.89-7743,1,29232,john_s_baker_jr,,2412.435,2418.756,If he has an equal protection right not to be discriminated against by a State actor.
1990.89-7743,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2493.854,2502.176,"Mr. Baker, I suppose the judge tells witnesses to step down, too."
1990.89-7743,1,29232,john_s_baker_jr,,2530.262,2530.612,--Your Honor--
1990.89-7743,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2530.612,2536.333,The independent decision taken by a private individual on racial grounds but the judge enforcing it in the course of the trial.
1990.89-7743,1,29232,john_s_baker_jr,,2536.333,2540.468,"--Okay, but do we know that... in your hypothet I didn't... it wasn't clear."
1990.89-7743,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2547.689,2551.259,"No, no more than it is in a peremptory strike."
1990.89-7743,1,29232,john_s_baker_jr,,2553.878,2555.395,"Well, there's no reason why he can't do that."
1990.89-7743,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2555.395,2563.651,Even though the private party is... the reason the private party is getting this witness off the stand is racial?
1990.89-7743,1,29232,john_s_baker_jr,,2563.651,2565.167,The judge doesn't know what the reason is.
1990.89-7743,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2571.756,2581.445,"Do you think it would be different if he said, Your Honor... or he said to the witness, I think you're antagonizing this all-white jury and I'd rather not have you go on?"
1990.89-7743,1,29232,john_s_baker_jr,,2584.147,2584.697,"Well, Your Honor--"
1990.89-7743,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2584.697,2590.051,"Then could the judge... the judge would have to say, no, you shall continue to cross examine or--"
1990.89-7743,1,29232,john_s_baker_jr,,2590.051,2593.086,"--Well, what would he do if he told him to continue?"
1990.89-7743,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2606.044,2614.249,--That's why I'm not sure the distinction you draw between whether the judge knows about the racial reason or not is very satisfying one.
1990.89-7743,1,29232,john_s_baker_jr,,2631.045,2631.528,"--Well, Your Honor--"
1990.89-7743,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2631.528,2634.247,The effective actor is either the lawyer or the judge.
1990.89-7743,1,29232,john_s_baker_jr,,2641.917,2653.958,"--Judge, I think... Your Honor, I think what is being alluded to in some of the other questions, however, on our... the prior cases in terms of State action."
1990.89-7743,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2674.038,2686.196,"Well, you'd draw a distinction if... let's assume you're in a State that has 15 peremptories and every single peremptory is used by the plaintiff to strike a black juror."
1990.89-7743,1,29232,john_s_baker_jr,,2698.939,2707.176,"Your Honor, in that situation if you had a statute that allowed that, you might have a claim against the statute."
1990.89-7743,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2845.148,2851.838,"Would it make any difference if, in this civil litigation, the State were a party?"
1990.89-7743,1,29232,john_s_baker_jr,,2851.838,2857.742,"Your Honor, we have carefully distinguished the issue in this case by focusing on nongovernmental."
1990.89-7743,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2859.642,2861.277,"I know you have, and I'm asking the question."
1990.89-7743,1,29232,john_s_baker_jr,,2861.277,2864.996,"--Your Honor, there are clearly other arguments that can be made."
1990.89-7743,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2916.78,2917.763,"Mr. Baker, you've mentioned that statute."
1990.89-7743,1,29232,john_s_baker_jr,,2933.29,2949.252,"--Well, Your Honor, in our brief, I think I went through and related the several statutes and how each related to the other, and I think you have reference to the... do you have reference to the inclusion of the particular provisions of the jury selection statute?"
1990.89-7743,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2949.252,2953.969,"18... section 1862, yes."
1990.89-7743,1,29232,john_s_baker_jr,,2953.969,2959.707,No citizen shall be excluded from jury service as a grand or petit juror in the district court.
1990.89-7743,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2959.707,2960.54,On account of race.
1990.89-7743,1,29232,john_s_baker_jr,,2960.54,2962.392,"On account of race, yes, Your Honor."
1990.89-7743,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2962.392,2964.511,"Now, why doesn't that apply?"
1990.89-7743,1,29232,john_s_baker_jr,,2964.511,2973.883,It seems to me that Congress has specifically set out the Jury Selection and Service Act that more specifically tells us how those principles apply.
1990.89-7743,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3034.272,3040.575,I'm not... I must say I'm not quite clear I understand what the answer is to the... to the text of the statute.
1990.89-7743,1,29232,john_s_baker_jr,,3040.575,3043.194,"The State's not excluding anyone, Your Honor."
1990.89-7743,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3043.194,3044.329,It doesn't say the State.
1990.89-7743,1,29232,john_s_baker_jr,,3056.104,3058.639,"They're not excluded from service, Your Honor."
1990.89-7743,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3058.639,3062.091,"You mean if you're stricken in the peremptory, you're not excluded from service?"
1990.89-7743,1,29232,john_s_baker_jr,,3062.091,3064.96,"In that particular case, but you're not stricken from the venire."
1990.89-7743,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3068.095,3070.697,I see.
1990.89-7743,1,29232,john_s_baker_jr,,3077.482,3084.438,"I think if you read it in the context of its history and the other statutes, Your Honor, I think that that is in fact the case that's always been interpreted."
1990.89-7743,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3093.11,3108.12,"And indeed if you did apply it on a case-by-case basis, you wouldn't be able to strike rich people from the jury or... which certainly happens quite frequently, I would think."
1990.89-7743,1,29232,john_s_baker_jr,,3108.12,3120.427,"Your Honors, while peremptory challenges are not constitutionally required, they are a congressionally created right."
1990.89-7743,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3153.132,3157.867,"Before you sit down, do you have any comment about supervisory power?"
1990.89-7743,1,29232,john_s_baker_jr,,3157.867,3163.937,"Your Honor, again, that was not at all addressed below."
1990.89-7743,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3191.524,3192.657,Would be inappropriate?
1990.89-7743,1,29232,john_s_baker_jr,,3192.657,3193.274,"Yes, Your Honor."
1990.89-7743,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3193.274,3196.678,So Congress can cut us off in that respect?
1990.89-7743,1,29232,john_s_baker_jr,,3196.678,3197.694,"Your Honor, if there is a cut--"
1990.89-7743,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3197.694,3198.21,That's what you're saying.
1990.89-7743,1,29232,john_s_baker_jr,,3198.21,3203.997,"--Normally, congressional statutes are implemented unless they're unconstitutional, Your Honor."
1990.89-7743,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3203.997,3205.181,"Thank you, Mr. Baker."
1990.89-7743,2,30018,james_e_doyle,,3208.985,3210.868,"Mr. Chief Justice, and my it please the Court:"
1990.89-7743,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3247.876,3252.678,"Well, why is the judge assisting him in that any more than when he... the judge tells a witness to step down?"
1990.89-7743,2,30018,james_e_doyle,,3252.678,3259.148,Because the selection of the person who is going to sit on the jury is a more material decision which is made.
1990.89-7743,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3260.434,3260.8,Well--
1990.89-7743,2,30018,james_e_doyle,,3260.8,3261.967,--than who testifies in the case.
1990.89-7743,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3261.967,3265.921,--But that doesn't say why the judge is assisting him any more than in the other case.
1990.89-7743,2,30018,james_e_doyle,,3268.973,3277.896,"Well, I suppose that's true, Justice Scalia, except that the lawyer can always say, I have no further questions, and then the witness gets off the witness stand, perhaps without the judge opening his mouth."
1990.89-7743,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3289.703,3306.463,"--If a lawyer makes an argument to a judge, asking for the judge's cooperation and the judge agrees with him, and that judge is later reversed and then the lawyer is sued."
1990.89-7743,2,30018,james_e_doyle,,3308.048,3308.531,"No, sir."
1990.89-7743,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3309.617,3317.604,"Well, the judge is giving him an awful lot more cooperation and help than he is in this case."
1990.89-7743,2,30018,james_e_doyle,,3317.604,3326.726,"--Well, I suppose that's true, Justice White, but I have a hard time conceiving how that can be a violation of either equal protection or due process, unless there's something--"
1990.89-7743,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3326.726,3328.828,xxx the question.
1990.89-7743,2,30018,james_e_doyle,,3329.778,3331.363,--Is he a State actor?
1990.89-7743,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3332.346,3333.046,"Well, why isn't he?"
1990.89-7743,2,30018,james_e_doyle,,3333.046,3333.648,Because--
1990.89-7743,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3333.648,3334.932,On your approach in this case.
1990.89-7743,2,30018,james_e_doyle,,3334.932,3339.719,--Because I'm suggesting to you that not everything the lawyer does to ply his trade in court is going to be State action.
1990.89-7743,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3355.996,3366.636,"Well, here's a State-provided system to settle disputes in court rather than by force and that's... if you want to collect some money from somebody, you don't beat him up."
1990.89-7743,2,30018,james_e_doyle,,3368.103,3368.821,"Yes, sir."
1990.89-7743,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3374.54,3375.956,"Thank you, Mr. Doyle."
