1968.306,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,19.143,"Number 306, Fortner Enterprises Incorporated, petitioner versus United States Steel Corporation."
1968.306,0,33757,kenneth_l_anderson,,19.143,30.268,Mr. Chief Justice and may it --
1968.306,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,30.268,32.656,"Mr. Anderson, now you may proceed with your argument."
1968.306,0,33757,kenneth_l_anderson,,32.656,36.377,"Thank you, Your Honor, may it please the Court."
1968.306,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,292.389,305.453,I'm sufficiently ignorant and naive in this general field of financing so that I don't quite -- I'm not quite sure I understand what 6% interest at 10 points is? Give me an example of that.
1968.306,0,33757,kenneth_l_anderson,,305.453,317.435,"The 6% interest would be 6% per year and in terms of the loan, the 10 points would be 10% of the gross amount of the loan."
1968.306,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,317.435,318.206,In which way?
1968.306,0,33757,kenneth_l_anderson,,319.021,327.353,Deducted when the loan proceeds are distributed a 10% is deducted from the amount that is distributed to the person receiving the loan.
1968.306,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,327.353,328.441,Borrower?
1968.306,0,33757,kenneth_l_anderson,,328.441,328.619,"Yes, the borrower."
1968.306,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,328.619,329.874,The borrower.
1968.306,0,33757,kenneth_l_anderson,,329.874,330.365,So that it --
1968.306,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,330.365,334.545,"The borrower, let's say the borrower borrows a million dollars."
1968.306,0,33757,kenneth_l_anderson,,334.545,336.949,"Alright, he gets $900,000.00."
1968.306,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,336.949,340.767,"He gets $900,000.00 and he pays 6% interest on the million?"
1968.306,0,33757,kenneth_l_anderson,,340.767,341.507,On the million.
1968.306,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,341.507,342.084,On the million.
1968.306,0,33757,kenneth_l_anderson,,342.084,343.003,"Right, and has --"
1968.306,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,343.003,346.147,"And what happens to that difference of a $100,000.00."
1968.306,0,33757,kenneth_l_anderson,,346.147,354.649,"Well, as far -- it's in effect, if the Court please, a form of usury which is condoned unfortunately by the courts."
1968.306,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,354.649,356.164,The borrower never gets that.
1968.306,0,33757,kenneth_l_anderson,,356.164,358.048,"No, sir."
1968.306,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,361.651,364.487,I could see that.
1968.306,0,33757,kenneth_l_anderson,,364.487,364.835,This is why --
1968.306,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,364.835,375.756,"The loan purporst to my example, it purports to be a million dollar loan you pay 6% of a million dollar but actually all you ever -- all the borrower ever gets get is $900,000.00."
1968.306,0,33757,kenneth_l_anderson,,375.756,378.079,Right.
1968.306,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,378.079,381.822,"Even though, I mean there's not any sort of an escrow proposition."
1968.306,0,33757,kenneth_l_anderson,,381.822,382.227,"No, sir."
1968.306,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,382.227,384.745,"Or a conditional thing he just never gets that, that less $100,000.00."
1968.306,0,33757,kenneth_l_anderson,,384.745,385.885,He never gets that.
1968.306,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,389.626,392.169,"Yeah, okay."
1968.306,0,33757,kenneth_l_anderson,,392.169,404.768,"So that this was substantially attractive proposition to this man who is in business and he has a corporation in existence which is called Fortner Enterprises, Inc."
1968.306,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,783.869,792.545,"I quite, can't quite see the theory of the conspiracy to monopolize, to monopolize what housing and --"
1968.306,0,33757,kenneth_l_anderson,,792.545,793.392,That the --
1968.306,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,793.392,794.776,-- the building of new subdivisions in Louisville?
1968.306,0,33757,kenneth_l_anderson,,794.776,798.556,"Prefabricated -- house market, yes sir."
1968.306,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,818.415,821.942,Well now that's something short of conspiracy to monopoly.
1968.306,0,33757,kenneth_l_anderson,,821.942,822.118,Well it --
1968.306,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,822.118,832.337,"I suppose to every businessman is always either on his own or in corporation with others trying to do better, trying to obtain a larger share of the business."
1968.306,0,33757,kenneth_l_anderson,,832.337,836.755,"Yes sir, and there are proper ways to do it and improper ways to do it."
1968.306,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,836.755,841.132,"I didn't -- well, what is the theory of the conspiracy to monopolize."
1968.306,0,33757,kenneth_l_anderson,,846.555,850.466,"Well I've regarded it, Your Honor, as their whole market area."
1968.306,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,874.21,874.789,Yeah.
1968.306,0,33757,kenneth_l_anderson,,874.789,877.189,And this is what really this case is all about.
1968.306,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,977.937,981.058,"Well the tie-in cases are Section 1 cases, aren't they?"
1968.306,0,33757,kenneth_l_anderson,,981.058,982.275,"Yes sir, they are Section 1."
1968.306,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,982.275,983.707,"They're not, they're not monopolization."
1968.306,0,33757,kenneth_l_anderson,,983.707,985.588,"That is correct, sir."
1968.306,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,992.81,1002.64,"Well, the Section 1 violation, what provisions would you have other than what is in the record already?"
1968.306,0,33757,kenneth_l_anderson,,1002.64,1021.359,"Well, I'm sure that Mr. Flinn in his brief has apparently completely have changed the respondent's approach to this matter and is now I feel more directly meeting the issues that are involved."
1968.306,1,35783,macdonald_flinn,,2202.274,2205.812,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
