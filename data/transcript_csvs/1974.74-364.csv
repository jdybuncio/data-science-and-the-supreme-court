1974.74-364,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,62.594,"We'll hear arguments next in 74-364, United States against Hale."
1974.74-364,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,65.718,69.159,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1974.74-364,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,299.011,306.264,"Did the district judge give that admonition to the jury without on his own, without any request from the part of the --"
1974.74-364,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,306.264,314.624,"Well, he initially interrupted the questioning without any objection by defense counsel to indicate that it was an improper question."
1974.74-364,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,362.361,366.75,"Mr. Frey, I have trouble with this silence part."
1974.74-364,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,369.762,371.828,"That's correct, there's no question about that."
1974.74-364,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,371.828,376.04,And this money was not counterfeit was it?
1974.74-364,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,376.04,376.796,No.
1974.74-364,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,376.796,379.351,It wasn't contraband was it?
1974.74-364,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,379.351,380.806,No.
1974.74-364,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,380.806,387.552,"Well, why should he -- I mean they took out his keys, you can say anything about those either, do they?"
1974.74-364,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,387.78,388.467,Well --
1974.74-364,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,388.467,393.495,Why did he have the obligation of opening his mouth about --
1974.74-364,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,393.495,397.934,We don't in anyway suggest that he had any obligation to give any explanation.
1974.74-364,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,413.028,419.234,"But the fact that he had money in his pocket, he was about -- he was obliged to explain it."
1974.74-364,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,419.234,421.478,He was not obliged to explain it to the police.
1974.74-364,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,424.997,427.682,"Well, why was he asked the question?"
1974.74-364,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,427.682,434.906,He was asked the question because his failure to explain that even though he was not oblige to explain it was nevertheless probative and I think I'm --
1974.74-364,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,434.906,440.573,"Well, was it probative that he had a watch on it and then explained that?"
1974.74-364,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,440.95,442.008,"Well, it would have been --"
1974.74-364,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,442.008,443.994,"-- pack of cigarettes, he didn't explain --"
1974.74-364,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,443.994,444.274,No.
1974.74-364,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,461.868,463.652,What condition?
1974.74-364,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,463.652,465.609,"Well, he was unemployed."
1974.74-364,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,465.609,466.455,Did they know that?
1974.74-364,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,469.248,472.19,He didn't say but his wife testified on cross-examination that he was unemployed.
1974.74-364,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,472.19,477.525,"But come under the question was asked, they didn't talk to his wife."
1974.74-364,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,477.525,480.447,"Well, I'm not sure that I understand."
1974.74-364,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,480.447,487.043,"You say that we're talking about -- you use your words, the condition he was in when he was arrested."
1974.74-364,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,491.604,491.991,That's right.
1974.74-364,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,494.456,498.149,$123.00 in this day and age is a large sum of money?
1974.74-364,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,498.149,501.181,"Well, I think it was unusually larger under the --"
1974.74-364,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,501.181,503.504,"He gets paid with it, huh?"
1974.74-364,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,507.327,510.449,"Well, I think for -- in Hale circumstances --"
1974.74-364,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,510.449,512.982,"Well, what were the circumstances?"
1974.74-364,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,512.982,527.403,"The circumstances were that he was arrested shortly after a robbery in which a similar although slightly lesser sum of money had been stolen from the victim, that Mr. Hale was unemployed, that it was not --"
1974.74-364,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,527.403,531.812,They didn't know he was unemployed at that time.
1974.74-364,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,531.812,536.442,But that's not -- the question is not what the police knew at that time.
1974.74-364,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,536.442,540.701,"You assumed he was unemployed, why?"
1974.74-364,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,540.701,552.765,"Well, the question is not what the police knew Mr. Justice Marshall, the question is what the jury would know in evaluating the truthfulness of Hale's testimony at trial of his explanation and I think it's --"
1974.74-364,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,552.765,557.345,They just told him that he had a right to be silent.
1974.74-364,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,557.345,558.94,"Yes, they had."
1974.74-364,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,558.94,560.096,And he was silent.
1974.74-364,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,560.096,561.751,"Yes, he was."
1974.74-364,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,561.751,563.785,He was penalized?
1974.74-364,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,563.785,565.989,"Well now, I don't think he penalized for it."
1974.74-364,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,575.029,576.616,-- U.S. Attorney asked that question?
1974.74-364,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,580.734,582.708,"Well, I'm not sure why he asked that question, but I think it's --"
1974.74-364,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,582.708,587.479,Is it not the question that once you give Miranda warnings you can do anything you want then?
1974.74-364,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,591.808,594.393,I don't -- I'm not sure that I understand.
1974.74-364,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,596.629,601.308,"He asked the witness, he said but you were given the warnings weren't you?"
1974.74-364,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,601.308,611.695,"Well, I think that the reason that question was asked, I think it's appropriate to call to the jury's attention as Judge Gesell did here that there is no duty to answer questions."
1974.74-364,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,633.023,647.723,-- the fact that money was stolen rather than a watch or package of cigarettes that makes a question about money relevant whereas a question about a watch or cigarettes might not have been.
1974.74-364,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,647.723,648.689,That's correct.
1974.74-364,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,679.074,689.472,"That was not -- as I remember the record, they asked him where you search at the time you were pick up and he said no."
1974.74-364,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,704.692,707.784,"Well, this was cross-examination by the prosecutor."
1974.74-364,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,724.352,727.706,"It's already an evidenced from the police, wasn't it?"
1974.74-364,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,727.706,740.961,"Well, I understand that the fact of his possession of the money was already in evidence, but what was also an evidenced at the point that this cross-examination took place was his explanation of how he came to have the money."
1974.74-364,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,937.905,949.11,"Did he make any effort to show after this episode, can you make any effort to show through his wife precisely where she had got the cash?"
1974.74-364,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,949.11,951.403,"Yes, that was shown in great detail."
1974.74-364,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1025.27,1030.127,"Are you telling us that if he just said that was my wife's money, they have to given that back to him and instead to move?"
1974.74-364,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1030.127,1031.945,"Well, I'm not sure whether they -- I'm not --"
1974.74-364,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1031.945,1035.597,Do you really mean that he was ready being booked.
1974.74-364,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1035.597,1036.613,"Well, I'm not saying that they would have given --"
1974.74-364,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1036.613,1038.896,"He had been search, am I right?"
1974.74-364,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1038.896,1039.156,I'm not --
1974.74-364,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1039.156,1041.638,Already being booked.
1974.74-364,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1041.638,1051.79,"I think he was -- I'm not clear whether he was being booked at the time he was searched, but I think it's probably true to say that they would not have given him back the money without checking it out."
1974.74-364,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1106.684,1112.72,The -- in point of fact he was asked to explain his possession --
1974.74-364,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1112.72,1113.317,He was.
1974.74-364,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1121.443,1123.946,So the jury never knew that he was asked?
1974.74-364,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1123.946,1127.986,The jury never knew that he was asked; that's correct.
1974.74-364,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1550.998,1571.715,"I just ask you before you sit down Mr. Frey, do you -- what if the trial judge had not told the jury of what he did in this case, i.e. what if he had not told them that the defendant was not required to give any explanation whatever at the time his arrest?"
1974.74-364,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1571.715,1575.655,"Well, we think that -- well, there are two pieces."
1974.74-364,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1621.139,1630.777,But you don't contend your privilege to put on his silence on your side of the case?
1974.74-364,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1630.777,1636.623,We're not contending that we could put this on as evidence in Chief.
1974.74-364,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1642.732,1651.885,And so you think it would be error if the court didn't instruct the jury that it's useable only for impeachment?
1974.74-364,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1651.885,1656.264,You mean assuming that the defendant requested such on limiting instruction?
1974.74-364,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1656.264,1656.803,Yes.
1974.74-364,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1656.803,1662.537,"For purposes of the ruling that we seek here, we don't seek a ruling that it can be used as evidence in Chief."
1974.74-364,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1663.333,1666.816,But you con -- it's your position that it can't.
1974.74-364,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1666.816,1668.014,It cannot.
1974.74-364,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1668.014,1669.86,Isn't it?
1974.74-364,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1669.86,1679.192,"Well, when the case arose in which there were some -- I would have to look at a concrete case in see what how I would evaluate the consideration."
1974.74-364,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1679.192,1682.826,"-- I thought you made it, I thought you took the taking the position that --"
1974.74-364,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1682.826,1683.034,Well --
1974.74-364,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1683.034,1683.97,It could not be used as --
1974.74-364,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1683.97,1689.379,It can't be use for the general purpose of showing guilt;
1974.74-364,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1697.066,1707.952,"Well then, you really are using it -- this isn't just for impeachment then, is it -- even when you ask it on cross-examination when he takes the stand?"
1974.74-364,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1707.952,1708.202,It is --
1974.74-364,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1708.202,1711.194,You're not using it as substantive evidence of his guilt.
1974.74-364,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1711.194,1712.182,"No, no."
1974.74-364,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1714.338,1723.989,"You're using it to cast and doubt the content, the truthfulness of his explanation."
1974.74-364,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1723.989,1731.851,"Of a particular part of his explanation, this is an important distinction that I think that respondent fails to understand in discussing the Stewart case."
1974.74-364,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1740.267,1747.071,"But you're saying to the jury in effect the same jury -- if his explanation were really true, he would have said something about it."
1974.74-364,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1747.071,1747.882,That's what we're saying --
1974.74-364,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1747.882,1751.565,"So, you're saying there, his explanation is not true?"
1974.74-364,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1751.565,1752.381,That's right.
1974.74-364,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1763.779,1770.234,You have not made a point to if I recall your brief that the fact that no objection was made by the defense here.
1974.74-364,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1770.234,1779.833,"Well, there was an objection after the court first itself spoke, then the defense said “Well, we object to and we don't make a point of that.”"
1974.74-364,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1779.833,1783.574,"Also, made a motion to strike."
1974.74-364,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1783.574,1786.496,"Well, I think they did, but the resolution of that --"
1974.74-364,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1786.496,1788.612,-- made a motion to strike.
1974.74-364,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1788.612,1794.955,"Well of course, we think there was no -- the contention that we make is that they had no right to have it restricted."
1974.74-364,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1794.955,1796.861,(Inaudible)
1974.74-364,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1796.861,1801.34,"Yes, but we're not relying on -- we're not saying that they were silent to their detriment."
1974.74-364,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1807.268,1814.475,What was this colloquy down in the appendix under the asterisks on page 5?
1974.74-364,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1820.324,1828.957,"No, that was shortly after in connection with the discussion of the -- there was a request for a mistrial by the defense at that point."
1974.74-364,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1836.246,1837.863,That was at bench?
1974.74-364,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1837.863,1842.696,Yes and the court said “I don't think you're entitled to a mistrial because I think I've corrected it”.
1974.74-364,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1846.609,1847.695,And the jury didn't hear that?
1974.74-364,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1847.695,1852.104,"The jury did not hear the material under the asterisk, that's correct."
1974.74-364,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1855.018,1858.373,Very well.
1974.74-364,1,35046,larry_j_ritchie,,1859.619,1862.91,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1974.74-364,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2058.639,2067.862,"That's true in the Griffin situation where the -- in other words, where the defendant doesn't elect to take the witness stand at his own trial."
1974.74-364,1,35046,larry_j_ritchie,,2077.452,2078.059,That's correct.
1974.74-364,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2088.005,2102.295,"And yet, nobody has ever held that the -- then you couldn't so long as there is a right of the defendant not to testify at his trial."
1974.74-364,1,35046,larry_j_ritchie,,2128.394,2129.4,"Well, the --"
1974.74-364,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2129.4,2131.037,-- made in the Griffin case.
1974.74-364,1,35046,larry_j_ritchie,,2131.037,2149.896,"The jury by the instruction to limit this to credibility is really being told that they can consider the silence and that into infer that the defendant is lying on the stand when he says that he is innocent, but they can't consider his silence to infer guilt."
1974.74-364,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2162.115,2176.947,"Well, does it not as Mr. Justice Stewart just suggested involve some struggle on the part of the jury to listen perhaps for four or five days to witnesses testifying against the defendant and then never hear from the defendant?"
1974.74-364,1,35046,larry_j_ritchie,,2182.145,2183.131,"Yes, there is."
1974.74-364,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2184.967,2186.983,Can you think of any cure for that?
1974.74-364,1,35046,larry_j_ritchie,,2186.983,2198.512,The only cure for that is going back many years ago before the federal statute in many state statutes were passed of relieving the defendant of his incompetency to testify at all.
1974.74-364,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2232.893,2234.979,"-- uninstructed, was unguided --"
1974.74-364,1,35046,larry_j_ritchie,,2234.979,2236.476,"Unguided, they can see --"
1974.74-364,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2236.476,2238.522,-- action on the part of the jury then isn't it?
1974.74-364,1,35046,larry_j_ritchie,,2238.522,2239.32,That is correct.
1974.74-364,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2239.32,2244.1,But do they have --they did have the benefit of some instruction on the subject didn't they?
1974.74-364,1,35046,larry_j_ritchie,,2244.1,2247.022,"They did, but here, they couldn't see it Your Honor."
1974.74-364,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2258.879,2269.47,"Do you have any hypothesis to suggest why given your view of the case here, necessary view of the case that there wasn't an objection as soon as the first question was asked."
1974.74-364,1,35046,larry_j_ritchie,,2277.063,2278.121,I think it did Your Honor.
1974.74-364,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2289.118,2301.466,It looks as though he at least remained silent whether seated or otherwise until the judge acted and then he thanked the judge for intervening for in fact making the objection.
1974.74-364,1,35046,larry_j_ritchie,,2301.466,2306.714,That is the way the record appears.
1974.74-364,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2306.714,2310.594,At that time from your point of view it was too late to do --
1974.74-364,1,35046,larry_j_ritchie,,2310.594,2313.359,That is correct.
1974.74-364,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2313.359,2315.323,You think a mistrial should have been granted?
1974.74-364,1,35046,larry_j_ritchie,,2315.323,2318.716,I do.
1974.74-364,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2319.315,2324.804,You left that one point; it did make a motion to strike.
1974.74-364,1,35046,larry_j_ritchie,,2326.549,2326.816,Yes.
1974.74-364,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2334.725,2336.33,-- mistrial.
1974.74-364,1,35046,larry_j_ritchie,,2338.973,2341.326,That is correct.
1974.74-364,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2455.771,2465.086,If there were no Fifth Amendment -- no privilege against self-incrimination just as a matter of evidence and proof.
1974.74-364,1,35046,larry_j_ritchie,,2474.888,2476.126,"Yes, I would."
1974.74-364,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2476.126,2480.675,And how is that?
1974.74-364,1,35046,larry_j_ritchie,,2480.675,2491.65,"The reason why silence would not be relevant, the Government's argument is really that if the defendant had this exculpatory testimony available to him, he had been given the money by his wife."
1974.74-364,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2504.403,2513.068,"Well, the police say you stole -- obviously, you stole this money, we're going to charge with it, and he said wait, here's what I got the money."
1974.74-364,1,35046,larry_j_ritchie,,2515.414,2537.805,"No, I do not, and the reason I don't is really two for one reason is because that the fact that was under arrest, without mass media television shows, I think it's common knowledge by great deal of society that possibly the best strategic policy to exercise at the police station is to remain silent."
1974.74-364,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2557.346,2563.883,"But the Hornbooks, I think, are solidly against you on that point, absent Fifth Amendment considerations."
1974.74-364,1,35046,larry_j_ritchie,,2581.96,2597.02,"Mr. Justice, there are number of state courts then considering this sort of an issue with regard to the tacit admission doctrine that if held, that arrest is a per se rule indicates that the silence after that arrest is not probative."
1974.74-364,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2599.414,2604.911,But isn't that in the context to the Fifth Amendment?
1974.74-364,1,35046,larry_j_ritchie,,2604.911,2619.903,"To some degree, it is, but I think the other thing that we have to pay attention to here is that the police themselves have just told the defendant that he has the right to remain silent, that he has the right not to answer any questions until he confers with counsel."
1974.74-364,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2629.388,2633.917,"But the fact that he was told he could do it, doesn't mean that he is totally has to do it?"
1974.74-364,1,35046,larry_j_ritchie,,2633.917,2636.42,"No, it doesn't."
1974.74-364,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2642.496,2646.935,Both of which are true and both of which were relied on this case.
1974.74-364,1,35046,larry_j_ritchie,,2646.935,2654.724,"He might also infer that if he is silent, he will not get into any particular trouble, that it will not be use against him."
1974.74-364,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2654.724,2659.502,"That's his inference certainly, that's nothing that the police told him."
1974.74-364,1,35046,larry_j_ritchie,,2659.502,2670.031,"No, but it certainly imply I think in the warnings, it wouldn't be unreasonable for him to get that sort of feeling from the warnings that are actually given."
1974.74-364,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2670.031,2680.39,"Well, if its at best of implication, why isn't the best way to handle it as an evidentiary matter to say that he can adduce that on redirect."
1974.74-364,1,35046,larry_j_ritchie,,2692.356,2701.17,"Well, I think that is a question where the Fifth Amendment privilege does come into play because of the impermissible inference of guilt that's associated with that silence."
1974.74-364,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2716.29,2724.549,-- you're saying Harris and Walden or Walder and Oregon against Hass are wrong because that's exactly what the jury was told to meet you those cases.
1974.74-364,1,35046,larry_j_ritchie,,2724.549,2729.128,Those cases did not involve a violation of the Fifth Amendment.
1974.74-364,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2733.747,2743.491,"Well, they involve the statement that was made in violation of the Miranda rules which you describe as prophylactic and not part of the Fifth Amendment?"
1974.74-364,1,35046,larry_j_ritchie,,2743.491,2744.23,That's correct.
1974.74-364,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2744.23,2752.408,"Well, why are those rules any less at par of the Fifth Amendment than the Griffin holding that comment violates it?"
1974.74-364,1,35046,larry_j_ritchie,,2755.402,2757.568,"No, it isn't written into the Fifth Amendment."
1974.74-364,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2773.044,2796.44,"So the police -- what you argued and the response for which the way you responded to Justice Rehnquist, all these matters could be brought out (a) by this redirect examination and (b) in the closing argument to the jury, the members of the jury presumably see as many television programs as your client does or other people do."
1974.74-364,1,35046,larry_j_ritchie,,2809.707,2813.268,These things could be brought out on rebuttal.
1974.74-364,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2831.957,2851.486,"-- that objection goes to -- if that's valid, then the whole business of impeachment of credibility through questions and which bring out such things as prior offenses and so on would be invalid, and yet, that's being accepted --"
1974.74-364,1,35046,larry_j_ritchie,,2851.486,2855.955,"Well, I think we got a special danger here where the Fifth Amendment is involved."
1974.74-364,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2855.955,2871.385,"If your argument is that the jury will not be able to comprehend the limiting instructions as to the use of what was brought out on cross-examination, that's a very broad attack on the whole use of impeachment."
1974.74-364,1,35046,larry_j_ritchie,,2871.385,2873.661,"Oh, I think not."
1974.74-364,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2880.353,2881.329,Prior offenses and so on?
1974.74-364,1,35046,larry_j_ritchie,,2881.329,2887.577,Prior offenses and it's a great deal of different I think in the privilege against self-incrimination.
1974.74-364,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2887.577,2891.747,And prior inconsistent testimony not in this context?
1974.74-364,1,35046,larry_j_ritchie,,2891.747,2896.555,"That's right, yes Your Honor."
1974.74-364,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2936.159,2971.625,"Mr. Ritchie, I wonder if almost all of your arguments would not also be directed at the well accepted rule, but unexplained possession of recently stolen property affords the jury an opportunity to draw an inference of guilt, not just an inference of want, of reliability as a witness or credibility but an inference of guilt."
1974.74-364,1,35046,larry_j_ritchie,,2971.625,2973.0,I think not.
1974.74-364,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3014.289,3045.599,"What if in this particular situation, the evidence of the Government showed that the amount stolen from the victim was a $157.33 and that that turned out to be precisely the amount of money in his pocket when they caught up with him, and that the denominations corresponded to the denominations of the money taken, would you -- where would that fall?"
1974.74-364,1,35046,larry_j_ritchie,,3054.791,3057.446,It may.
1974.74-364,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3093.278,3124.321,"Of course, Mr. Justice Frankfurter's opinion to be sure it was a concurring opinion not an opinion of the court was to the effect that in the ordinary run of the generality of human experience, if people have an explanation, a valid explanation, they give it, and that therefore the failure to do what is found to be the generality of human experience is something a jury is entitled to hear about and consider."
1974.74-364,1,35046,larry_j_ritchie,,3128.721,3130.987,"Yes, I would."
1974.74-364,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3149.981,3161.764,"Once you given up more than you have to, in this case, I would assume that you take position that that small amount of money he had, he had no one obligation to do it."
1974.74-364,1,35046,larry_j_ritchie,,3161.764,3162.95,"No, that is correct."
1974.74-364,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3164.026,3165.88,"Well, you have him abandon that that holds."
1974.74-364,1,35046,larry_j_ritchie,,3165.88,3168.056,"Oh no, I certainly have not."
1974.74-364,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3168.056,3185.678,"Well, if it were $5,000.00 and then it has been a bank robbery or supermarket robbery, where they've had that kind of money these days, would you say the rule of law would be different, $5,000.00 instead of a $150.00?"
1974.74-364,1,35046,larry_j_ritchie,,3185.678,3186.594,"No, it would not."
1974.74-364,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3191.754,3192.341,Why?
1974.74-364,1,35046,larry_j_ritchie,,3201.236,3219.368,The pressure to explain at trial by the presumption of that that exists when a person is found in possession of recently stolen property is a difference sort of pressure than the pressure at the police station that a defendant might feel to talk to the police.
1974.74-364,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3219.368,3223.148,I'm talking about the explanation at the same point in time.
1974.74-364,1,35046,larry_j_ritchie,,3226.003,3226.949,At trial.
1974.74-364,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3226.949,3231.939,"-- is $5,000.00 or to make it clear $20,000.00."
1974.74-364,1,35046,larry_j_ritchie,,3242.926,3245.599,"I'm sorry Your Honor, you're talking about at trial now."
1974.74-364,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3280.071,3283.535,"-- only difference is the amount of the money, isn't it?"
1974.74-364,1,35046,larry_j_ritchie,,3283.535,3285.07,It's the amount of the money.
1974.74-364,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3312.697,3326.427,"Mr. Ritchie, in light of Justice Harlan's opinion in Grunewald, is it necessary for you to rely as strongly as you do on the Fifth Amendment?"
1974.74-364,1,35046,larry_j_ritchie,,3326.427,3335.369,"Well, I think it is for the reason that Grunewald was a case in which the court exercised their supervisory power over the lower federal courts."
1974.74-364,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3335.369,3337.735,It was not a constitutional decision.
1974.74-364,1,35046,larry_j_ritchie,,3337.735,3338.721,That is correct.
1974.74-364,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3338.721,3344.14,"Now, the four dissenting justices would have made it a constitutional holding."
1974.74-364,1,35046,larry_j_ritchie,,3344.14,3345.386,"Yes, Your Honor."
1974.74-364,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3345.386,3356.924,"So, the majority decision really tend as I read it on the question whether or not the evidence had probative value in light of the Fifth Amendment?"
1974.74-364,1,35046,larry_j_ritchie,,3356.924,3358.619,That is correct Your Honor.
1974.74-364,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3403.67,3409.496,"Was that still true with the D.C. court Reorganization Act, do you think?"
1974.74-364,1,35046,larry_j_ritchie,,3409.496,3411.033,"Yes, I do."
1974.74-364,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3418.328,3419.406,That court reorganization;
1974.74-364,1,35046,larry_j_ritchie,,3421.332,3422.4,It was.
1974.74-364,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3432.011,3434.095,"Today, this offense would be tried in the Superior --"
1974.74-364,1,35046,larry_j_ritchie,,3434.095,3440.56,"Today, it would be tried in the Superior Court."
1974.74-364,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3440.56,3447.176,"Certainly, there are still some supervisory of power is there not, at least toward the federal District Courts in the District of Columbia?"
1974.74-364,1,35046,larry_j_ritchie,,3447.176,3450.51,"Yes, I thought think there is."
1974.74-364,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3450.51,3462.526,"You mean, it's just a non-constitutional error is all -- in the federal trial is what supervisory power means."
1974.74-364,1,35046,larry_j_ritchie,,3462.526,3479.651,The Government has argued that there would be no -- but by your ruling that it seeks there would be no way that the police could possibly violate the use of those such a ruling to violate the rights of the accused.
1974.74-364,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3738.802,3747.894,"Let me see if I understand you, would you feel that an affirmance here would result in an overruling of the Raffel?"
1974.74-364,1,35046,larry_j_ritchie,,3747.894,3749.113,I'm not sure that it would.
1974.74-364,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3760.986,3761.952,They didn't overrule it?
1974.74-364,1,35046,larry_j_ritchie,,3761.952,3763.527,They did not overrule it.
1974.74-364,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3763.527,3770.751,And it was a unanimous opinion and the court which included Justices Holmes and Brandeis.
1974.74-364,1,35046,larry_j_ritchie,,3770.751,3772.176,That is correct.
1974.74-364,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3772.176,3775.15,"In fact, Justice Brandeis wrote the opinion."
1974.74-364,1,35046,larry_j_ritchie,,3775.15,3777.955,That is correct sir.
1974.74-364,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3778.412,3783.46,"Mr. Ritchie, you have I think two minutes left to --"
1974.74-364,2,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3914.797,3783.46,Thank you.
1974.74-364,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3916.384,3917.222,Thank you Mr. Frey.
