2003.02-1343,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,26.0,38.51,"We'll hear argument now in No. 02-1343, Engine Manufacturers Association and Western States Petroleum Association v. the South Coast Air Quality Management District."
2003.02-1343,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,39.746,42.058,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2003.02-1343,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,82.925,86.081,"Mr. Phillips, this is a facial challenge?"
2003.02-1343,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,86.081,88.665,"Yes, Justice O'Connor, it is a facial challenge."
2003.02-1343,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,88.665,90.522,Claiming total preemption.
2003.02-1343,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,90.522,92.464,"Yes, claiming total preemption."
2003.02-1343,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,92.464,109.182,"What if we were to think that at least as applied to the district's own purchases of vehicles, that it could limit itself to what kinds of vehicles it wanted to purchase and therefore is valid at least in part?"
2003.02-1343,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,109.182,110.957,"Well, the...  there are two answers to that."
2003.02-1343,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,119.833,132.093,"Well, but let's suppose it wants to establish a standard to apply now and in the future for itself and for any other jurisdiction, public jurisdiction, within its area?"
2003.02-1343,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,132.093,133.292,"Well, if it goes beyond..."
2003.02-1343,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,133.292,134.9,If it's authorized to do that.
2003.02-1343,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,134.9,144.559,"Well, if it goes beyond what it wants to purchase itself and imposes requirements on others, then it seems to me that's a standard that falls within the ambit of the preemption."
2003.02-1343,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,144.559,151.701,"What if...  what if the State...  what if the State of California says that all of our officials, including the Governor, shall have a low emissions vehicle?"
2003.02-1343,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,151.701,157.152,I think that...  that there is a serious question as to whether or not that would be preempted.
2003.02-1343,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,162.315,169.745,"Well, but it seems...  it seems to me that...  that it is from...  from the standpoint of...  of governmentally owned and operated vehicles."
2003.02-1343,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,169.745,187.168,"Well, I think the answer to the question at the end of the day, Justice Kennedy, would be that you would require a clearer statement from Congress than what you have in section 209(a) to interfere with the kind of purchasing decisions that localities are...  are making in contrast to this."
2003.02-1343,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,187.168,197.116,"Right, but...  but it seems to me not...  not an answer to Justice O'Connor's concern to say that it goes beyond the particulars of this case because when you make a facial challenge, you are going beyond the particulars of this case."
2003.02-1343,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,197.116,199.467,"Well, I understand that, Justice Scalia."
2003.02-1343,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,245.329,246.238,"No, but we may..."
2003.02-1343,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,246.238,247.437,I'm still not sure...  sure where we are.
2003.02-1343,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,265.02,271.585,"Well, our...  our challenge is not intended, frankly, to interfere with the local jurisdiction's ability to purchase their own vehicles on their own behalf."
2003.02-1343,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,271.585,273.443,Local jurisdictions.
2003.02-1343,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,311.587,312.663,They can do that.
2003.02-1343,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,312.663,312.802,Yes.
2003.02-1343,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,313.156,313.322,All right.
2003.02-1343,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,313.322,314.808,We don't...  we don't have any challenge to that.
2003.02-1343,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,314.808,322.571,"In that case we're now down to the possibility that we're talking about some garbage trucks, I think, and some airport vehicles because I think all the rest of it did just involve the State."
2003.02-1343,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,322.571,334.46,"Well, it's difficult to know precisely what the metes and bounds of it is, but the portion of this that offends us and the portion that we think does not require a clearer statement, which is that which goes directly to non-governmental entities."
2003.02-1343,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,364.675,383.789,"Mr. Carter, if these regulations had been adopted by the State of California rather than a regional district as its 246, in...  in lieu of the Federal plan, would that have been permissible?"
2003.02-1343,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,383.789,401.25,"Assuming, Justice Ginsburg, that you...  that California took...  complied with all of the requirements of section 246, and there are specific requirements in order to get a...  in the...  in the State action plan that...  State implementation plan that need to be satisfied."
2003.02-1343,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,414.913,419.742,So your objection is to this on a regional basis.
2003.02-1343,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,425.975,430.145,"Yes, providing you comply with the standards of section 246."
2003.02-1343,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,430.145,433.406,But...  so...  but the substance of it would be okay statewide.
2003.02-1343,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,435.346,441.291,"Well, I don't know if the precise terms of this...  of these rules would qualify under section 246 or not."
2003.02-1343,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,463.044,464.713,"Well, it's not sale requirements."
2003.02-1343,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,465.895,481.786,"Well, under the respondents' theory of this case which limits the term standards to production mandates imposed on manufacturers, then it seems to me that it clearly extends to all purchases and sales and whether it extends to fleets, it wouldn't...  it's not limited to fleets at all."
2003.02-1343,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,505.542,515.862,"Well, if...  if one local jurisdiction affects other governmental jurisdictions, but the latter don't care, then it's just as if, as the hypothetical just posed, the State had the...  had...  had the rule."
2003.02-1343,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,527.651,541.851,"Well, this Court has long recognized that you can't analyze a preemption case solely on the basis of the single action by a single actor, that in fact you have to consider the possibility that all 50 States or, in this case, every local jurisdiction could follow suit."
2003.02-1343,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,550.313,560.716,"Well, I...  I had not understood your argument to be based on any conception that this particular district would be treated differently than the State as a whole, but I...  I...  am I wrong in that?"
2003.02-1343,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,560.716,580.035,"Well, the State of California would have certain prerogatives, obviously, under the entire scheme that are different, but even if California had simply done what the district did here, which is to just announce a set of fleet rules, not made any effort to comply with 246, not made any effort to comply with section 209(b)..."
2003.02-1343,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,580.035,581.604,"Well, what...  what does...  what does 246 provide?"
2003.02-1343,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,581.604,595.517,"Section 246 provides that in certain nonattainment States, one of the options they have available in order to eliminate the overall...  or to...  to improve the overall ambient air quality is to adopt certain types of fleet rules."
2003.02-1343,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,610.294,613.183,So it didn't comply in your view with 246.
2003.02-1343,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,613.183,613.926,"Oh, it clearly didn't comply."
2003.02-1343,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,619.499,635.557,"Your...  your argument, as I understand it, going back to your answer to Justice Ginsburg, is that although there is an avenue for the State, as it were, to get where...  where it might want to go on a...  on a fleet policy under 246, the district simply does not have that avenue open to it."
2003.02-1343,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,635.557,637.415,"Yes, that's absolutely clear."
2003.02-1343,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,637.415,637.682,Yes.
2003.02-1343,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,637.682,640.283,And that's...  and that's part of the way this entire scheme operates.
2003.02-1343,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,640.283,641.852,But that gets me back to my question.
2003.02-1343,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,654.4,673.142,"Well, I...  I think the answer is that there are various components of the fleet rules, and I think unlike if you're...  if you're seeking pre-enforcement of a statute, where you'd have to find every application of it, the question is are there subcomponents of these rules that are properly challengeable and therefore properly enjoinable rather than being allowed to go in."
2003.02-1343,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,674.545,683.379,"That eliminates the doctrine entirely, I mean, the doctrine that facial challenge has to show the statute is...  is invalid in all its applications."
2003.02-1343,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,692.378,697.951,"Well, no, Justice Scalia, I think it's a little more complicated than that because what you're really talking about is a...  is a host of rules."
2003.02-1343,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,722.721,722.926,But...
2003.02-1343,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,722.926,723.548,that's what we've done.
2003.02-1343,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,740.971,754.756,"But I thought...  I thought this was the case in...  in which part A applies both to the district, as in Justice O'Connor's question, and to non-governmental entities so that it's not that A applies to...  to one kind of buyer and B to another."
2003.02-1343,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,775.811,780.723,"And my answer to you is I don't think that's the proper application of Salerno and I don't...  I mean, I recognize..."
2003.02-1343,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,780.723,781.383,I'm not applying Salerno.
2003.02-1343,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,792.036,814.448,"And my response is the rule that covers the governmental situation and the private situation is the same rule, and if that rule has a substantial number of constitutional applications or...  or non-preempted applications, doesn't that, in...  in effect, defeat the facial challenge?"
2003.02-1343,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,814.448,841.298,"Well, except for the fact that if...  if we don't get past the ruling of the court below at this stage, which is that none of this is preempted, that...  whether it's a facial challenge or a non-facial challenge, we're going to have rules that are out there that are being implemented at this stage and will be upheld as constitutional under the Ninth Circuit's ruling as the...  as the controlling rule of law, and we won't be in a position even to get at any portion of those rules that are clearly unconstitutional because they..."
2003.02-1343,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,841.298,846.36,"You can, can you not...  I'm just trying to draw this back because it seems to me you're not challenging the public part."
2003.02-1343,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,854.201,854.738,Right.
2003.02-1343,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,854.738,860.971,And I take it what you're challenging is rule 1194 insofar as it applies to private operators.
2003.02-1343,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,860.971,861.154,Right.
2003.02-1343,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,861.154,870.259,"Rule 1193, the same, and rule 1186.1, the same, and nothing else."
2003.02-1343,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,870.259,871.169,I think that...
2003.02-1343,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,871.169,876.492,"In each of those rules, having looked at them, it does say at the beginning, these apply to public and private."
2003.02-1343,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,882.808,885.12,"That...  that is our...  I mean, our primary concern."
2003.02-1343,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,886.317,888.258,"Well, but that's what you're challenging, nothing else."
2003.02-1343,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,888.258,888.425,Right.
2003.02-1343,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,901.344,902.459,Yes.
2003.02-1343,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,902.459,906.711,that it will make a certain purchasing decision as a purchasing decision.
2003.02-1343,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,917.28,917.568,What do you mean?
2003.02-1343,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,918.561,919.387,A public entity.
2003.02-1343,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,919.387,919.797,Oh.
2003.02-1343,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,919.797,935.112,"What I was saying is...  what...  what I meant to answer your question earlier, Justice Breyer, was to say if you're asking me can public entities make purchasing decisions free of the restrictions of the Clean Air Act, I think the answer is yes because I don't think Congress spoke to that."
2003.02-1343,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,949.191,951.215,"Well, now just let's think..."
2003.02-1343,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,951.215,951.958,that controls emissions and is unconstitutional.
2003.02-1343,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,951.958,955.839,of the complexity of State and central government in light of what you just said.
2003.02-1343,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,966.159,978.047,"No, but the...  the problem is much simpler than that, Justice Breyer, because there's a scheme in place where if you don't like the way the regulatory arrangements are worked out, you can take the issue to California and California can take it to the EPA."
2003.02-1343,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,987.047,987.213,the merits.
2003.02-1343,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,987.213,989.897,My problem is to try to figure out what's being challenged.
2003.02-1343,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,989.897,998.813,"Well, we're challenging the effort by the district to impose these kinds of requirements, these standards which control emissions."
2003.02-1343,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,998.813,999.185,On its...
2003.02-1343,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,999.185,999.928,But if California...
2003.02-1343,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,999.928,1000.549,On everyone.
2003.02-1343,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1000.549,1005.007,"if California accepts that as a matter of its domestic law, who are we to say otherwise?"
2003.02-1343,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1005.007,1007.275,"Well, because that's what the Clean Air Act is all about."
2003.02-1343,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1084.119,1085.809,"Because they were enacted at different times, I think, the two sections."
2003.02-1343,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1085.809,1086.802,They were enacted at different times.
2003.02-1343,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1086.802,1086.924,Yes.
2003.02-1343,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1086.924,1090.062,What about the distinction between standard and requirement?
2003.02-1343,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1090.062,1103.065,"Well, the use of requirement in the second sentence is simply a recognition that there could be standardless requirements imposed by States requiring a certification or some other kind of documentation that don't have standards."
2003.02-1343,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1110.558,1111.051,"Very well, Mr. Phillips."
2003.02-1343,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1112.909,1119.103,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2003.02-1343,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1147.338,1167.567,"General Olson, does...  does the Government take the position that petitioner has just taken, that these rules are invalid even insofar as they apply to governmental subdivisions in California?"
2003.02-1343,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1167.567,1182.056,"I think the answer is...  is no, but let me explain, that to the extent that agencies of government, the State or subdivisions, are purchasing their own vehicles, we do not contend that that is unconstitutional."
2003.02-1343,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1182.799,1182.965,"No, no."
2003.02-1343,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1182.965,1186.514,I'm not talking about whether their doing of it is unconstitutional.
2003.02-1343,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1192.709,1209.177,Our...  our position...  I don't...  I'm not sure I know the answer to that because I don't know what authority this agency has with respect to requiring different units of...  of the government of the State of California to purchase or not purchase vehicles.
2003.02-1343,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1260.054,1261.811,"Has it happened, General Olson?"
2003.02-1343,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1280.387,1281.752,Not that I know of.
2003.02-1343,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1411.95,1425.529,"But...  but, Mr. Olson, why can't a local agency or community decide it's going to buy vehicles and will buy no diesel vehicles?"
2003.02-1343,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1428.584,1442.143,"Well, it is not...  we...  we are not contending, Justice O'Connor...  I want to make it very clear that local agencies, San Francisco or Los Angeles, can put for their own vehicles anything they want."
2003.02-1343,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1444.084,1448.421,"Well, does this district have the authority to so provide for its own purchases?"
2003.02-1343,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1448.421,1448.792,For its own purchases.
2003.02-1343,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1454.281,1459.771,Does it have authority to...  to make that requirement for cities within its jurisdiction?
2003.02-1343,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1459.771,1467.573,We don't think that it has the authority to require other governmental agencies based upon emission standards to do something.
2003.02-1343,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1467.573,1468.854,"Well, that's a matter of State law."
2003.02-1343,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1468.854,1480.371,"That is a matter of State law, and it's...  and...  and what we're talking about here is the requirement by particular agencies to pick out different types of motor vehicles that may or may not be sold."
2003.02-1343,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1480.371,1484.087,"Well, I suppose the separate States could do that for its own purchases."
2003.02-1343,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1484.087,1486.649,"For their own...  for their own purchases, Justice Kennedy."
2003.02-1343,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1486.649,1486.804,All right.
2003.02-1343,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1486.804,1486.938,they can't...
2003.02-1343,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1486.938,1489.083,And could they also do that for all their governmental subdivisions?
2003.02-1343,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1494.49,1504.111,"I agree with the...  with the way that the Chief Justice put it, that that's their own purchasing decisions, and it's a matter of State law as to whether they can...  but that is not what this case is about."
2003.02-1343,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1537.381,1542.832,"Maybe, but most of what it covers is simply the...  the purchase by governmental units."
2003.02-1343,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1557.731,1558.474,Justice...
2003.02-1343,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1558.474,1559.672,subdivisions to purchase only...
2003.02-1343,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1559.672,1569.498,"From the standpoint of the United States Government, we're not contending that the State or an individual can choose whatever vehicle he or she or it wants to purchase."
2003.02-1343,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1621.056,1629.063,"General Olson, you mentioned that there are Federal vehicles involved, postal vehicles, but you also are stressing purchase."
2003.02-1343,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1644.833,1647.268,"Well, A, I think that is an inhibition."
2003.02-1343,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1702.79,1706.3,"Just so I have it clear, because it...  this is very important to me."
2003.02-1343,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1714.845,1715.921,To the extent that...  yes.
2003.02-1343,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1729.046,1730.986,"Thank you, General Olson."
2003.02-1343,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1733.215,1737.098,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2003.02-1343,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1885.129,1888.556,Suppose that California passes a law and says no one can sell a diesel bus in California.
2003.02-1343,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1888.556,1889.504,Well...
2003.02-1343,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1889.504,1892.393,Clearly you'd have to go get permission if you want a rule like that.
2003.02-1343,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1892.659,1894.705,A...  a rule that...
2003.02-1343,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1894.705,1898.958,The rule is exactly what I said: no one can sell a diesel bus in California
2003.02-1343,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1898.958,1908.868,A...  one could...  I believe that a good argument could be made that that rule is preempted because it conflicts with the overall purposes of the Clean Air Act.
2003.02-1343,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1909.034,1909.117,Yes.
2003.02-1343,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1909.117,1909.656,"I mean, you'd have to go to EPA."
2003.02-1343,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1909.656,1911.718,"But, Justice Breyer, please let me finish."
2003.02-1343,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1911.718,1911.835,Yes.
2003.02-1343,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1911.835,1913.487,This is a very important point.
2003.02-1343,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1932.601,1935.118,"I'm...  for purposes of my question, I'm rejecting that argument."
2003.02-1343,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1939.41,1939.864,"Yes, and..."
2003.02-1343,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1939.864,1949.069,"And where I was going, if you want to see, I'll show you because then you...  it...  it seems to me clearly you'd have to ask question...  nobody can sell a diesel bus in California."
2003.02-1343,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1984.53,1986.926,Here is my...  here is my first effort at an answer.
2003.02-1343,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2023.911,2025.685,"Mr. Waxman, can I interrupt you just a moment?"
2003.02-1343,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2047.977,2048.72,Well...
2003.02-1343,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2048.72,2061.723,I think it may well be they're...  and...  and we don't have to worry about the enforced or implied in the terms that a statute because all it has to be that...  the only prohibition is against anything relating to a standard.
2003.02-1343,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2061.723,2062.799,"No, it's..."
2003.02-1343,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2062.799,2072.376,And if the standard is limited to the numerical term...  I don't find in the text of the...  of any part of the statute here your...  your point about enforcement against.
2003.02-1343,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2077.493,2078.235,Justice...
2003.02-1343,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2078.235,2080.465,"I have the same problem, if I could second it."
2003.02-1343,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2099.208,2102.552,I'll try...  I'll be efficient and try and answer two questions at once then.
2003.02-1343,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2166.247,2173.14,I agree with you completely that the statute imposes these obligations on the manufacturers to comply with the standards.
2003.02-1343,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2178.591,2185.733,"Well, I think the...  the word standard...  I'll...  I'll say this one more time and then retreat to another...  another argument."
2003.02-1343,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2206.288,2206.66,Excuse me.
2003.02-1343,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2206.66,2208.617,Now you say it's not just manufacturers.
2003.02-1343,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2211.572,2227.426,"Well, there are provisions in section 203, which is the Prohibited Acts, that it...  it is imposed on the people who make cars and requires them or limits them in what those people can make."
2003.02-1343,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2227.426,2242.576,"I mean, it...  it's hard enough to say that the word standards on its own is automatically limited to manufacturers, but it's doubly hard to say it is limited not to just to manufacturers, but to manufacturers and sellers, but not to manufacturers, sellers, and purchasers."
2003.02-1343,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2242.576,2259.415,"It...  it is...  Justice Scalia, there is a provision in section 203 of the act, the Prohibited Acts, that deals with the instance in which a manufacturer, for example, produces cars overseas and then tries to sell noncompliant cars through a distributor or some other entity."
2003.02-1343,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2285.011,2290.667,"Yes, but as soon as there's...  as soon as there's one commercial vehicle available, that's going to have effect on the manufacturing."
2003.02-1343,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2290.667,2302.101,"Well, there may be...  the...  the vehicle has to be...  the rules make quite clear that the vehicles have to be available and able to be used by that user in the locality, the fuel..."
2003.02-1343,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2302.101,2307.469,And you...  and you have to get...  apply for an exemption which the petitioner says is very difficult to get.
2003.02-1343,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2307.469,2317.871,"There...  the petitioner does not say it's very difficult to get, and that footnote 7 on page 8 of their brief is truly the 13th chime of the clock in their argument."
2003.02-1343,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2336.819,2338.389,What's...  what's that 13th chime?
2003.02-1343,3,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3544.741,3548.911,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2003.02-1343,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3642.329,3655.415,"Mr. Carter, Mr. Waxman said in his brief that the position he's taking is the position that EPA takes, and EPA is not with us this morning."
2003.02-1343,3,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3655.415,3664.825,"Oh, I believe EPA is very much with us this morning because the Solicitor General speaks for the United States, and EPA is clearly a part of the United States Government."
2003.02-1343,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3670.565,3672.71,So you...  you say that's just wrong when...
2003.02-1343,3,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3672.71,3674.196,"Oh, absolutely that's just wrong."
2003.02-1343,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3680.596,3681.543,"Thank you, Mr. Phillips."
