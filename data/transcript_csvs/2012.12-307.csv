2012.12-307,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,9.106,"We will hear argument this morning in Case 12-307, United States v. Windsor, and we will begin with the jurisdictional discussion."
2012.12-307,0,43614,vicki_c_jackson,,10.006,18.478,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2012.12-307,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,85.67,88.103,Who else is going to be aggrieved if she is not?
2012.12-307,0,43614,vicki_c_jackson,,102.132,112.754,"--Your Honor, it is possible that in district courts where other taxpayers sue the United States on similar relief, that the district courts will rule differently."
2012.12-307,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,125.481,126.064,Excuse me.
2012.12-307,0,43614,vicki_c_jackson,,130.968,132.018,--Your Honor--
2012.12-307,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,132.018,139.072,"I mean, the Government comes in and says “ I agree ” -- or if there was jurisdiction, why did the Court ever have to get to the merits?"
2012.12-307,0,43614,vicki_c_jackson,,171.51,184.269,"--Your Honor, the -- the two questions that you asked me, why did the district court have jurisdiction, the first answer is that the party invoking the district court's jurisdiction was Ms.--"
2012.12-307,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,217.591,218.774,"Really, that's very peculiar."
2012.12-307,0,43614,vicki_c_jackson,,228.048,237.07,"--Well, Your Honor, the jurisdiction of the Court, it seems to me, is not affected by the length of the proceedings it undertook."
2012.12-307,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,238.086,238.553,I'm not talking about jurisdiction now.
2012.12-307,0,43614,vicki_c_jackson,,245.84,262.635,"--I am not sure I have a wonderful answer to that question, Justice Scalia, but I do think the case bears some similarities to Kentucky against Indiana, which was discussed by the parties, where Kentucky sued Indiana in this Court's original jurisdiction on a contract."
2012.12-307,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,296.806,301.01,"Well, the Solicitor General's standing argument is very abstract."
2012.12-307,0,43614,vicki_c_jackson,,356.678,358.447,"I think not, Your Honor."
2012.12-307,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,398.772,409.828,"Why -- why wouldn't -- imagine -- there in Article II, it says that the President shall take care that the laws be faithfully executed."
2012.12-307,0,43614,vicki_c_jackson,,465.73,472.734,"Well, the trustee, I think, would be able to go to a court of first instance to get an adjudication of the claim."
2012.12-307,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,488.662,489.812,And that's the part I don't understand.
2012.12-307,0,43614,vicki_c_jackson,,533.207,545.165,"In the first instance, the obligations are uncertain the trustee is presumably subject to potentially adverse competing claims on his or her action."
2012.12-307,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,545.165,546.015,"Well, I would have thought--"
2012.12-307,0,43614,vicki_c_jackson,,546.015,546.265,Those are--
2012.12-307,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,546.265,555.121,--I would have thought your answer would be that the Executive's obligation to execute the law includes the obligation to execute the law consistent with the Constitution.
2012.12-307,0,43614,vicki_c_jackson,,576.867,582.271,"--Mr. Chief Justice, I think that's a hard question under Article II."
2012.12-307,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,594.596,599.914,"In Federal court's jurisprudence, are you saying there's a lack of adversity here?"
2012.12-307,0,43614,vicki_c_jackson,,599.914,602.266,I am saying primarily--
2012.12-307,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,602.266,603.452,Can you give us a pigeonhole?
2012.12-307,0,43614,vicki_c_jackson,,603.452,617.109,"--I -- it's a little difficult, because the circumstance is unusual, Justice Kennedy, but I think the most apt of the doctrines, although they are overlapping and reinforce each other, the most apt is standing."
2012.12-307,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,633.904,635.104,But it seems to me there -- there's injury here.
2012.12-307,0,43614,vicki_c_jackson,,635.104,650.097,"Well, Your Honor, I do not agree that the injuries alleged by the United States should be cognizable by the Article III courts, because those injuries are exactly what it asked the courts below to -- to produce."
2012.12-307,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,692.093,698.413,"But, Ms. Jackson, I mean, to go back to Justice Kennedy's point, we have injury here in the most classic, most concrete sense."
2012.12-307,0,43614,vicki_c_jackson,,729.832,734.503,"--Justice Kagan, there is a three-prong test."
2012.12-307,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,791.373,812.87,"But don't we often separate those two things, ask whether there's injury for Article III purposes and causation and redressability, as you say, but then say, well, sometimes when all of those are met, there's not going to be adequate presentation of the arguments, and so we will appoint an amicus or we'll restructure things?"
2012.12-307,0,43614,vicki_c_jackson,,819.359,820.792,"Yes, Your Honor."
2012.12-307,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,862.536,865.321,"No, they're -- they're not in agreement about whether to pay the money or not."
2012.12-307,0,43614,vicki_c_jackson,,886.251,891.805,"Your Honor, I don't think that Chadha is identical, with respect."
2012.12-307,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,927.978,928.494,You can finish your sentence.
2012.12-307,0,43614,vicki_c_jackson,,928.494,929.061,Thank you.
2012.12-307,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,959.946,960.48,"Thank you, counsel."
2012.12-307,0,43614,vicki_c_jackson,,961.615,962.465,"--Oh, I'm sorry."
2012.12-307,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,963.932,983.046,Mr. Srinivasan?
2012.12-307,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,983.046,987.348,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2012.12-307,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1011.965,1020.052,"On the first one, is there any case where all the parties agreed with the decision below and we upheld appellate jurisdiction?"
2012.12-307,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1021.654,1023.321,Where the parties agreed--
2012.12-307,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1023.321,1028.258,All the parties agreed with the decision below and we nonetheless upheld appellate jurisdiction.
2012.12-307,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1028.258,1031.893,"--Well, you didn't speak to it in Lovett, Your Honor, but that was the circumstance in Lovett."
2012.12-307,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1031.893,1037.614,"No, it wasn't raised -- it wasn't raised or addressed, and that had the distinct situation of an appeal, direct appeal from an Article I tribunal."
2012.12-307,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1037.614,1043.351,"Well, I don't -- I don't know that that matters, because you had to satisfy Article III prerequisites to have the case in this Court."
2012.12-307,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1048.67,1049.087,Okay.
2012.12-307,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1052.206,1054.489,"--No, I don't know of one."
2012.12-307,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1056.674,1057.341,So this is totally unprecedented.
2012.12-307,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1062.145,1064.014,"--Let me say two things about that if I might, Your Honor."
2012.12-307,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1070.434,1072.034,"No, it's not just -- it's not unusual."
2012.12-307,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1073.552,1076.754,"--Well, it's totally unprecedented in one respect, Your Honor."
2012.12-307,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1094.716,1121.533,"It has not arisen very often in the past, because in the past, when I was at the Office of Legal Counsel, there was an opinion of the Office of Legal Counsel which says that the Attorney General will defend the laws of the United States, except in two circumstances: Number one, where the basis for the alleged unconstitutionality has to do with presidential powers."
2012.12-307,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1175.951,1185.126,"--Justice Scalia, one recognized situation in which an act of Congress won't be defended in court is when the President makes a determination that the act is unconstitutional."
2012.12-307,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1191.63,1193.597,But then why does he enforce the statute?
2012.12-307,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1193.597,1196.348,"Well, that's an option that's available to him, Justice Kennedy."
2012.12-307,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1211.86,1225.868,"But let me ask you, suppose that constitutional scholars have grave doubts about the practice of the President signing a bill but saying that he thinks it's, unconstitutional -- what do you call it, signing statements or something like that."
2012.12-307,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1244.864,1251.835,"--I -- in the -- in the signing statement situation, Your Honor, one example in the past is Turner Broadcasting."
2012.12-307,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1279.937,1282.47,Sometimes you do and sometimes you don't.
2012.12-307,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1293.428,1296.647,"Mr. Chief Justice, I'd hesitate to give you a black-and-white algorithm."
2012.12-307,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1301.017,1301.683,Excuse me.
2012.12-307,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1311.222,1311.705,"--No, no."
2012.12-307,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1312.155,1313.488,"Or the Solicitor General, is that enough?"
2012.12-307,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1313.488,1325.646,--28 U.S.C. 530(d) presupposes -- Congress presupposes that there are going to be occasions in which a statute is -- is not defended because of a conclusion by the Attorney General that it's unconstitutional.
2012.12-307,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1325.646,1328.265,"Oh, it can be either the Attorney General or the Solicitor General?"
2012.12-307,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1328.265,1332.551,"It could be, but this is a situation in which the President made the determination."
2012.12-307,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1353.565,1366.64,"So when Congress enacts a statute, it cannot be defended, it has no assurance that that statute will be defended in court, if the Solicitor General in his view thinks it's unconstitutional?"
2012.12-307,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1366.64,1368.492,--There have -- Justice Scalia--
2012.12-307,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1368.492,1369.092,Is that right?
2012.12-307,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1369.092,1370.092,--there have been occasions in the past.
2012.12-307,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1370.092,1370.676,Yes or no?
2012.12-307,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1370.676,1371.893,Yes.
2012.12-307,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1392.407,1392.94,Mr. Srinivasan--
2012.12-307,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1392.94,1395.142,"It's not what the OLC opinion said, by the way."
2012.12-307,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1395.142,1398.178,--It can be that the President decides to enforce it.
2012.12-307,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1402.596,1410.819,--But when the Government -- when the -- when the case is adjudicated in the first instance -- we're talking here about appellate authority.
2012.12-307,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1410.819,1411.536,--Correct.
2012.12-307,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1411.536,1418.257,The Government sometimes loses cases in the first instance and then it doesn't appeal.
2012.12-307,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1445.759,1450.128,"Well, there are -- there are a number of considerations that could factor into it, Justice Ginsburg."
2012.12-307,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1475.444,1478.562,"Counsel, could you not run out of time on the BLAG standing?"
2012.12-307,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1486.152,1487.668,"I -- I won't, Your Honor."
2012.12-307,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1513.766,1514.532,"Well, how are you aggrieved?"
2012.12-307,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1535.995,1542.433,I guess we'd -- I'd subscribe to the aggrievement analysis that the Court made in Chadha at pages 929 to 931 of its opinion.
2012.12-307,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1562.013,1564.865,"Could I just -- before you go on to the House group, could I just clear up something?"
2012.12-307,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1569.767,1570.436,Correct.
2012.12-307,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1570.436,1574.405,You're -- you're representing the Judiciary as you stand before us here today--
2012.12-307,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1574.405,1574.988,Well--
2012.12-307,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1574.988,1577.522,"--trying to persuade the Court, you're representing the Court?"
2012.12-307,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1577.522,1580.141,--We represent the sovereign interests of the United States.
2012.12-307,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1596.42,1597.586,It seems very strange.
2012.12-307,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1610.511,1618.7,"--Well, I think -- I guess what I would say is this: The United -- the United States -- the Executive Branch represents the sovereign interests of the United States before the Court."
2012.12-307,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1640.865,1645.251,"Mr. Srinivasan, Chadha says what you said it said about what it means to be aggrieved--"
2012.12-307,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1645.251,1645.967,Yes.
2012.12-307,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1645.967,1648.286,--but Chadha also left open the Article III question.
2012.12-307,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1653.007,1656.892,I don't -- I don't know why Chadha didn't engage on it in particular.
2012.12-307,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1690.477,1693.831,Didn't Chadha -- didn't Chadha suggest that Congress could have standing in -- in Chadha?
2012.12-307,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1693.831,1694.481,--I'm sorry?
2012.12-307,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1694.481,1707.755,"In Chadha, there was an argument that Congress had standing, because what was at issue in the case was precisely a prerogative of Congress to exercise the one-house or two-house veto."
2012.12-307,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1707.755,1712.725,There wasn't a -- there -- that was an issue in Chadha.
2012.12-307,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1727.669,1732.889,So you say we shouldn't be concerned about that part of Chadha because the issue wasn't joined there?
2012.12-307,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1732.889,1734.556,"Well, I don't -- I don't read the--"
2012.12-307,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1734.556,1738.71,But we should take Lovett as a binding precedent even though the issue wasn't addressed at all?
2012.12-307,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1738.71,1747.815,"--I didn't -- to be -- to be fair or, as was suggested this morning, to be cricket, I -- I didn't mean to suggest that Lovett is binding precedent, Mr. Chief Justice."
2012.12-307,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1754.552,1754.969,All right.
2012.12-307,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1755.652,1757.337,So -- sure.
2012.12-307,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1757.337,1758.721,And the issue wasn't joined.
2012.12-307,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1763.741,1764.391,Right.
2012.12-307,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1764.941,1769.979,"But what is your reading of what that means, that Congress can--"
2012.12-307,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1769.979,1772.264,--I think that--
2012.12-307,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1772.264,1776.315,--intervene in situations in which its interests are injured?
2012.12-307,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1776.315,1776.648,--Sure.
2012.12-307,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1826.498,1833.502,So are you accepting the amici's formulation that somehow the representative has to be of both houses and not just one?
2012.12-307,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1833.502,1834.435,No.
2012.12-307,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1860.901,1862.167,So you take the position that Congress--
2012.12-307,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1862.167,1862.684,--there might be standing in that situation.
2012.12-307,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1864.436,1866.519,"--Well, I want to know what you're conceding."
2012.12-307,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1866.519,1868.155,--I'm conceding that at most--
2012.12-307,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1868.155,1870.773,Let's assume this very case.
2012.12-307,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1880.313,1881.446,"--Well, there are two different cases."
2012.12-307,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1890.67,1891.67,You can finish your sentence.
2012.12-307,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1891.67,1892.186,--this thought.
2012.12-307,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1899.709,1900.742,"Thank you, counsel."
2012.12-307,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,1903.744,1907.03,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2012.12-307,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1923.99,1929.893,"Mr. Clement, Chadha was somewhat different because there was a unique House prerogative in question."
2012.12-307,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,1940.351,1942.117,"Well, Justice Sotomayor--"
2012.12-307,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1942.117,1948.857,It's a law of the United States and the person who defends it generally is the Solicitor -- Solicitor General.
2012.12-307,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,1948.857,1953.242,"--Sure, generally, unless and until they stop defending it, at which point we submit--"
2012.12-307,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1953.242,1956.194,"Well, then, why shouldn't -- why shouldn't taxpayers have a right to come in?"
2012.12-307,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,1957.296,1964.8,--Because the House is very -- in a very different position in a case like this and in Chadha from just the general taxpayer.
2012.12-307,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1986.046,1987.832,"Well, that -- that assumes the premise."
2012.12-307,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,1993.236,1997.521,"--Well, with all due respect, Justice Kennedy, I think the House--"
2012.12-307,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1997.521,2001.992,"--We are talking about ex ante, not ex post, what is standing at the outset?"
2012.12-307,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2004.444,2005.027,--Sure.
2012.12-307,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2033.61,2048.554,"So you don't think that there is anything to the argument that in Chadha the House had its own unique institutional responsibilities and prerogatives at stake, either the one-house veto or the legislative veto?"
2012.12-307,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2048.554,2049.989,"--Well, I would say two things."
2012.12-307,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2049.989,2050.556,That's irrelevant?
2012.12-307,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2050.556,2052.508,I don't think -- I don't think it's irrelevant.
2012.12-307,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2087.345,2100.335,"What if you -- what if you disagree with -- the executive is defending one of your laws, if that's the way you insist on viewing it, and you don't like their arguments, you say, they are not making the best argument."
2012.12-307,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2106.839,2109.289,"No, I would say we would not, Mr. Chief Justice."
2012.12-307,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2138.624,2141.909,How about a couple of cases sort of in the middle of the Chief Justice's and this one?
2012.12-307,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2164.941,2176.33,"--Well, I think -- if in a particular case, which is obviously not this case, the Executive decides, we are not going to defend the statute as applied I think in that situation the House could come in."
2012.12-307,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2194.378,2197.496,Does that include the -- does that include the courts of appeals or just this Court?
2012.12-307,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2197.496,2200.631,"--That includes all courts, but excluding the DOMA cases."
2012.12-307,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2223.813,2229.551,This is what -- we have always had the distinction between the public action and the private action.
2012.12-307,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2281.0,2284.301,"Well, I would -- a couple of things, Justice Breyer."
2012.12-307,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2287.337,2295.691,Chadha is really different because of course there is an interest in the legislature in defending a procedure of the legislature.
2012.12-307,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2306.065,2307.148,"Well, if I--"
2012.12-307,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2307.148,2309.85,And that's -- I'm afraid of opening that door.
2012.12-307,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2309.85,2312.283,"--Well, it's understandable."
2012.12-307,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2317.87,2318.203,"No, no."
2012.12-307,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2358.028,2364.265,I can point to you a couple of cases that will help but may not be a complete solution for some of the reasons you built into your question.
2012.12-307,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2410.741,2412.76,Can you tell me where the authorization is here?
2012.12-307,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2472.464,2474.648,"Well, Justice Sotomayor, I can point you to two places."
2012.12-307,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2482.087,2493.062,What other House Rule creates the power of the majority leaders to represent the House outside of the functions of the House?
2012.12-307,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2493.062,2497.264,"I'm not sure there is another one, but that's the sole purpose of Rule 2.8."
2012.12-307,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2499.382,2503.783,"This would be, I think, sort of unheard of, that--"
2012.12-307,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2503.783,2505.969,"--I don't think so, Justice Sotomayor."
2012.12-307,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2521.343,2521.978,--We don't even have a vote here.
2012.12-307,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2521.978,2522.445,We do.
2012.12-307,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2539.538,2548.211,"Under your view, would the Senate have the right to have standing to take the other side of this case, so we have the House on one side and the Senate on the other?"
2012.12-307,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2548.211,2551.679,"--No, Justice Kennedy, they wouldn't have the standing to be on the other side of this case."
2012.12-307,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2560.034,2560.334,"Well, why not?"
2012.12-307,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2568.038,2572.176,It -- because it wouldn't have the authority to do so under Chadha.
2012.12-307,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2616.871,2617.321,Then why is--
2012.12-307,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2617.321,2618.088,--but if that's not going to happen--
2012.12-307,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2618.088,2622.859,--Then why is it sufficient for one house to take the position that the statute is constitutional?
2012.12-307,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2627.496,2636.117,"--Justice Alito, I think it makes perfect sense in this context, because every -- each individual house has a constitutional rule before a statute is repealed."
2012.12-307,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2656.846,2668.74,"Well, if the law is passed by a bare majority of one of the houses, then each member of that -- of that house who was part of the majority has the same interest in defending its constitutionality."
2012.12-307,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2668.74,2671.373,"I don't think that's right after Raines, Justice Alito."
2012.12-307,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2801.84,2803.456,That -- that would give you intellectual whiplash.
2012.12-307,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2805.292,2805.975,It -- it does.
2012.12-307,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2818.916,2819.552,"Thank you, counsel."
2012.12-307,3,43614,vicki_c_jackson,,2821.318,2824.02,"Thank you, Your Honor."
2012.12-307,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3012.107,3015.642,"Well, could I ask you this question: On the question of the House resolution--"
2012.12-307,3,43614,vicki_c_jackson,,3015.642,3016.342,"--Yes, sir."
2012.12-307,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3016.342,3033.87,"--if -- if a house -- if one of the houses passes a resolution saying that a particular group was always authorized to represent us, do you think it's consistent with the separation of powers for us to examine whether that's a correct interpretation of the rules of that House of Congress?"
2012.12-307,3,43614,vicki_c_jackson,,3033.87,3040.274,"Yes, I do, Your Honor, because that resolution is not something operating only internally within the House."
2012.12-307,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3072.912,3079.399,"Maybe I -- as long as you have a minute, I -- what did you think of Mr. Clement's argument this way, that -- that the execution -- can I--"
2012.12-307,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3079.399,3080.266,Sure.
2012.12-307,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3080.266,3109.601,"--to execute the laws is in Article II, but where the President doesn't in a particular law, under those circumstances, a member of the legislature, appropriately authorized, has the constitutional power -- a power that is different than the average person being interested in seeing that the law is carried out; they can represent the power to vindicate the interest in seeing that the law is executed."
2012.12-307,3,43614,vicki_c_jackson,,3116.439,3123.511,"Your Honor, I think that when the Executive declines to do so, it is exercising its Take Care Clause authority."
2012.12-307,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3152.445,3165.603,"Ms. Jackson, before you sit down, I would like to note that you briefed and argued this case as amicus curiae at the invitation of the Court, and you have ably discharged the responsibility, for which you have the gratitude of the Court."
2012.12-307,3,43614,vicki_c_jackson,,3165.603,3166.355,"Thank you, Your Honor."
2012.12-307,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3166.355,3166.871,Thank you.
2012.12-307,4,37772,paul_d_clement,,3241.85,3244.801,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2012.12-307,4,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3294.315,3327.788,"Mr. Clement, the problem is if we are totally for the States' decision that there is a marriage between two people, for the Federal Government then to come in to say no joint return, no marital deduction, no Social Security benefits; your spouse is very sick but you can't get leave; people -- if that set of attributes, one might well ask, what kind of marriage is this?"
2012.12-307,4,37772,paul_d_clement,,3327.788,3348.619,"And I think the answer to that, Justice Ginsburg, would be to say that that is a marriage under State law, and I think this Court's cases when it talks about the fundamental right to marriage, I take it to be talking about the State law status of marriage; and the question of what does that mean for purposes of Federal law has always been understood to be a different matter."
2012.12-307,4,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3359.741,3360.093,How about divorce?
2012.12-307,4,37772,paul_d_clement,,3367.097,3379.738,"--Well, we've never had that, Your Honor, and I think that there is a difference when it comes to divorce, because with divorce uniquely, you could have the -- possibility that somebody's married to two different people for purposes of State law and Federal law."
2012.12-307,4,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3409.09,3411.709,But only if the State recognizes it.
2012.12-307,4,37772,paul_d_clement,,3411.709,3414.161,"--No, I don't think that is true for purposes of that provision."
2012.12-307,4,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3414.161,3416.513,"And so there is a common law, Federal common law definition?"
2012.12-307,4,37772,paul_d_clement,,3416.513,3419.129,"That's my understanding, that's -- as discussed--"
2012.12-307,4,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3419.129,3424.617,"I thought it was reverse, that if the State law recognized common law marriages, the Federal law--"
2012.12-307,4,37772,paul_d_clement,,3424.617,3434.991,"--My understanding is that there is a Federal -- that the Federal law recognizes in -- in the Social Security context even if it doesn't; and in all events, there are other situations -- immigration context, tax consequences."
2012.12-307,4,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3479.353,3484.405,"Well, it applies to over what, 1,100 Federal laws, I think we are saying."
2012.12-307,4,37772,paul_d_clement,,3527.25,3529.167,"Well, Justice Kennedy, two points."
2012.12-307,4,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3573.979,3578.698,"Well, but it's not really uniformity because it regulates only one aspect of marriage."
2012.12-307,4,37772,paul_d_clement,,3580.567,3604.182,"Well, that's true but I don't think that's a mark against it for federalism purposes, and it -- it addressed a particular issue at a point, remember in 1996, Congress is addressing this issue because they are thinking that the State of Hawaii through its judicial action is about to change the definition of marriage from a way that it had been defined in every jurisdiction in the United States."
2012.12-307,4,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3634.884,3650.061,"Suppose we look just at the estate tax provision that's at issue in this case, which provides specially favorable treatment to a married couple as opposed to any other individual or economic unit."
2012.12-307,4,37772,paul_d_clement,,3668.69,3697.81,"Well, I think for these purposes actually, Justice Alito, if you go back to the beginning of the estate tax deduction, what Congress was trying to do was trying to provide uniform treatment of taxpayers across jurisdictions, and if you look at the brief that Senator Hatch and some other Senators filed, they discussed this history, because what was happening in 1948 when this provision was initially put into Federal law was you had community property States and common law States, and actually there was much more favorable tax treatment if you were in a community law State than a common law State."
2012.12-307,4,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3747.507,3752.194,"--But that's begging the question, because you are treating the married couples differently."
2012.12-307,4,37772,paul_d_clement,,3752.194,3752.678,--Well--
2012.12-307,4,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3752.678,3759.032,You are saying that New York's married couples are different than Nebraska's.
2012.12-307,4,37772,paul_d_clement,,3759.032,3760.2,--But -- but the only way--
2012.12-307,4,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3760.2,3761.234,I picked that out of a hat.
2012.12-307,4,37772,paul_d_clement,,3763.419,3767.288,--But the -- the only way they are different is because of the way the State law treats them.
2012.12-307,4,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3793.188,3802.211,"You would say it would be the same thing if the State passed a law -- Congress passes a law which says, well, there's some States -- they all used to require 18 as the age of consent."
2012.12-307,4,37772,paul_d_clement,,3834.848,3837.048,"Well, I guess I would -- I would say two things."
2012.12-307,4,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3842.018,3843.252,"No, I just want your bottom line."
2012.12-307,4,37772,paul_d_clement,,3875.739,3882.493,"--Again, I think the right way to analyze it would be, you know, is -- is there any distinction drawn that implicates what level of scrutiny is implicated."
2012.12-307,4,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3888.395,3888.945,"No, there isn't any."
2012.12-307,4,37772,paul_d_clement,,3891.68,3896.232,"--Well, I -- I think the uniform treatment of individuals across State lines--"
2012.12-307,4,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3896.232,3896.565,All right.
2012.12-307,4,37772,paul_d_clement,,3907.673,3910.123,"--No, I see exactly where you're going, Justice Breyer."
2012.12-307,4,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3910.123,3910.423,All right.
2012.12-307,4,37772,paul_d_clement,,3910.673,3914.991,"And -- and obviously, every one of those cases would have to be decided on its own."
2012.12-307,4,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3919.445,3919.729,"Yes, okay."
2012.12-307,4,37772,paul_d_clement,,3920.262,3921.529,--There's a powerful interest in treating--
2012.12-307,4,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3921.529,3922.879,"Fine, but once -- the first part."
2012.12-307,4,37772,paul_d_clement,,3938.739,3949.879,"--Well, again, if we're -- if we're coming at this from the premise that the States have the option to choose, and then we come at this from the perspective that Congress is passing this not in a vacuum, they're passing this in 1996."
2012.12-307,4,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,4006.48,4015.318,But what gives the Federal Government the right to be concerned at all at what the definition of marriage is?
2012.12-307,4,37772,paul_d_clement,,4040.37,4043.822,"--Well, at least two -- two responses to that, Justice Sotomayor."
2012.12-307,4,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,4060.949,4084.564,"So they can create a class they don't like -- here, homosexuals -- or a class that they consider is suspect in the marriage category, and they can create that class and decide benefits on that basis when they themselves have no interest in the actual institution of marriage as marriage."
2012.12-307,4,37772,paul_d_clement,,4086.68,4095.384,"--Just to clarify, Justice Sotomayor, I'm not suggesting that the Federal Government has any special authority to recognize traditional marriage."
2012.12-307,4,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,4102.606,4103.256,"No, I'm -- I'm--"
2012.12-307,4,37772,paul_d_clement,,4103.256,4104.392,--Okay.
2012.12-307,4,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,4105.742,4106.775,--Assuming I assume the States can--
2012.12-307,4,37772,paul_d_clement,,4106.775,4109.277,"--So then, if the States can--"
2012.12-307,4,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,4109.277,4109.91,--what creates the right--
2012.12-307,4,37772,paul_d_clement,,4109.91,4116.883,--the Federal Government has sort of two sets of authorities that give it sort of a legitimate interest to wade into this debate.
2012.12-307,4,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,4154.239,4156.689,But I -- I see an illogic in your argument.
2012.12-307,4,37772,paul_d_clement,,4174.902,4175.502,"--No, no."
2012.12-307,4,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,4182.672,4198.448,"We're helping the States do -- if they do what we want them to, which is -- which is not consistent with the historic commitment of marriage and -- and of questions of -- of the rights of children to the State."
2012.12-307,4,37772,paul_d_clement,,4198.448,4200.383,"With respect, Justice Kennedy, that's not right."
2012.12-307,4,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,4216.627,4219.279,They're not -- they're not a question of additional benefits.
2012.12-307,4,37772,paul_d_clement,,4260.622,4263.891,"--With respect, Justice Ginsburg, that's not what the Federal Government is saying."
2012.12-307,4,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,4278.068,4289.791,"Mr. Clement, for the most part and historically, the only uniformity that the Federal Government has pursued is that it's uniformly recognized the marriages that are recognized by the State."
2012.12-307,4,37772,paul_d_clement,,4348.147,4350.082,"--A couple of responses, Justice Kagan."
2012.12-307,4,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,4449.594,4455.731,"Well, is what happened in 1996 -- and I'm going to quote from the House Report here -- is that"
2012.12-307,4,37772,paul_d_clement,,4466.004,4468.723,--Does the House Report say that?
2012.12-307,4,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,4519.338,4523.459,"Well, but your statute applies also to States where the voters have decided it."
2012.12-307,4,37772,paul_d_clement,,4523.459,4524.642,--That's true.
2012.12-307,4,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,4530.846,4535.683,"Just to be clear, I think your answer is fair and rational."
2012.12-307,4,37772,paul_d_clement,,4553.609,4560.964,--I think -- I think there is so clearly is a Federal power because DOMA doesn't define any term that appears anywhere other than in a Federal statute that we assume that there is Federal power for.
2012.12-307,4,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,4568.901,4570.684,"Well, I think -- I think it is a DOMA problem."
2012.12-307,4,37772,paul_d_clement,,4577.923,4584.511,"--And it doesn't have the authority to regulate marriages, as such, but that's not what DOMA does."
2012.12-307,4,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,4598.501,4611.744,"Well, Congress could have achieved exactly what it achieved under Section 3 by excising the term “ married ” from the United States Code and replacing it with something more neutral."
2012.12-307,4,37772,paul_d_clement,,4637.042,4639.911,"--That would make no difference, Justice Alito."
2012.12-307,4,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,4660.324,4674.501,"When you started, you started by, I think, agreeing -- maybe not -- that uniformity in and of itself with nothing else is not likely to prove sufficient, at least if it's rational basis-plus."
2012.12-307,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,4729.202,4734.205,I didn't understand that courts were so central to your position.
2012.12-307,4,37772,paul_d_clement,,4742.892,4745.594,"Well, I -- I think that's true, Justice Scalia."
2012.12-307,4,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,4749.065,4752.583,"That means courts -- the courts, they do dictate in respect to time."
2012.12-307,4,37772,paul_d_clement,,4772.162,4783.286,"Well, let me -- let me just get on record that -- to take issue with one of the premises of this, which is we are at somehow rational basis-plus land, because I would suggest strongly that three levels of scrutiny are enough."
2012.12-307,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4836.221,4837.606,"Thank you, Mr. Clement."
2012.12-307,5,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,4841.825,4844.191,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2012.12-307,5,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4870.258,4873.877,"Suppose your -- you agree that Congress could go the other way, right?"
2012.12-307,5,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,4889.722,4894.524,"We think that wouldn't raise an equal protection problem like this statute does, Mr. Chief Justice."
2012.12-307,5,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4894.524,4899.678,"Well, no, my point is: It wouldn't -- you don't think it would raise a federalism problem either, do you?"
2012.12-307,5,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,4899.678,4901.111,I don't think it would raise a federalism problem.
2012.12-307,5,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4901.111,4901.361,Okay.
2012.12-307,5,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,4901.361,4911.986,"And I -- but the key for the -- for the -- our purposes is that, in addition to denying these fundamental important -- fundamentally important benefits, is who they are being denied to."
2012.12-307,5,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4911.986,4917.138,"So just to be clear, you don't think there is a federalism problem with what Congress has done in DOMA?"
2012.12-307,5,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,4917.138,4919.238,"We -- no, we don't, Mr. Chief Justice."
2012.12-307,5,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4919.238,4919.571,Okay.
2012.12-307,5,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,4919.571,4931.479,"The question is: What is the constitutionality for equal protection purposes, and because it's unconstitutional and it's embedded into numerous Federal statutes, those statutes will have an unconstitutional effect."
2012.12-307,5,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,4935.266,4943.788,You think Congress can use its powers to supercede the traditional authority and prerogative of the States to regulate marriage in all respects?
2012.12-307,5,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,4950.059,4952.994,"--No, I'm not saying that, Your Honor."
2012.12-307,5,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,4958.465,4964.469,"Well, but then there is a federalism interest at stake here, and I thought you told the Chief Justice there was not."
2012.12-307,5,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,4964.469,4970.523,"--Well, with respect to Section 3 of DOMA, the problem is an equal protection problem from the point of view of the United States."
2012.12-307,5,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,4970.523,4984.696,"Yes, but, General, surely the question of what the Federal interests are and whether those Federal interests should take account of the historic State prerogatives in this area is relevant to the equal protection inquiry?"
2012.12-307,5,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,4984.696,4987.215,"It's central to the inquiry, Justice Kagan."
2012.12-307,5,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4989.148,4993.385,"Oh, so it would be central to the inquiry if Congress went the other way, too?"
2012.12-307,5,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,4993.385,5007.627,"Well, the difference is what Section 3 does is impose this exclusion from Federal benefits on a class that has undeniably been subject to a history of terrible discrimination on the basis of--"
2012.12-307,5,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,5007.627,5008.044,I understand that.
2012.12-307,5,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,5016.734,5019.367,"--Well, I think -- I just want to clarify."
2012.12-307,5,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,5023.321,5024.954,I know the equal protection argument.
2012.12-307,5,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,5024.954,5042.716,"--But the federalism concerns come into play in the following way: In that Mr. Clement has made the argument that, look, whatever States can do in terms of recognizing marriage or not recognizing marriage, the Federal Government has commensurate authority to do or not do."
2012.12-307,5,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,5056.125,5067.6,"But you're -- you are insisting that we get to a very fundamental question about equal protection, but we don't do that unless we assume the law is valid otherwise to begin with."
2012.12-307,5,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,5080.325,5080.758,--Yeah.
2012.12-307,5,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,5112.544,5118.298,"Can I take you back to the example that you began with, where a member of the military is injured."
2012.12-307,5,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,5155.304,5165.343,"The question in the case, Justice Alito is whether Congress has a sufficiently persuasive justification for the exclusion that it has imposed."
2012.12-307,5,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,5178.417,5180.535,Let me take you back to the example.
2012.12-307,5,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,5190.391,5206.087,"Well, the question before the Court is whether the exclusion that DOMA imposes violates equal protection, and it does violate equal protection because you can't treat this as though it were just a distinction between optometrists and ophthalmologists, as the Lee Optical case did."
2012.12-307,5,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,5216.359,5224.631,"But that's -- that's the same in the example that we just gave you, that discrimination would have been visited on the same group, and you say there it's okay."
2012.12-307,5,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,5224.631,5225.464,"--No, I didn't say that."
2012.12-307,5,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,5229.516,5234.837,"So you think that's bad as well, that all three of those has to be treated the same, despite State law about marriage."
2012.12-307,5,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,5234.837,5253.648,"They have to be analyzed under equal protections principles, but whatever is true about the other situations, in the situation in which the couple is lawfully married for purposes of State law and the exclusion is a result of DOMA itself, the exclusion has to be justified under this Court's equal protection analysis, and DOMA won't do it."
2012.12-307,5,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,5253.648,5254.831,"General Verrilli, I have a question."
2012.12-307,5,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,5266.206,5266.906,"Yes, Your Honor."
2012.12-307,5,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,5266.906,5268.841,"All right, heightened in some way."
2012.12-307,5,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,5301.395,5306.53,"You would have -- you would have to impose the heightened scrutiny equal protection analysis, sure."
2012.12-307,5,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,5306.53,5306.963,Exactly.
2012.12-307,5,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,5316.57,5317.754,"Yes, that's certainly--"
2012.12-307,5,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,5317.754,5327.543,"--strict scrutiny on whether the use of race as a class, whether they are white or a black, is justified by a compelling interest."
2012.12-307,5,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,5327.543,5328.645,"--That is certainly true, Your Honor."
2012.12-307,5,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,5389.917,5398.14,"So as soon as one State adopted same sex marriage, the definition of marriage throughout the Federal code had to change?"
2012.12-307,5,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,5408.097,5424.29,"Well, I don't know, Mr. Chief Justice, why you wouldn't assume that what Congress was doing when it enacted a statute, particularly a statute that had the word “ marriage ” in it, was assuming that the normal rule that applies in the vast majority of circumstances of deference to the State definition of marriage would be the operative principle."
2012.12-307,5,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,5424.29,5430.861,So you don't think that when Congress said “ marriage ” in every one of these provisions that they had in mind same-sex marriages?
2012.12-307,5,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,5430.861,5439.633,"No, but they may well have had in mind deferring to the normal State definition of marriage, whatever it is."
2012.12-307,5,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,5541.098,5545.302,So that was the view of the 84 Senators who voted in favor of it and the President who signed it?
2012.12-307,5,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,5546.869,5548.504,"--No, Mr. Chief Justice."
2012.12-307,5,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,5632.275,5638.594,"General, your bottom line is, it's an equal protection violation for the Federal Government, and all States as well?"
2012.12-307,5,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,5638.594,5645.265,"Yes, Your Honor, and that's the -- we took the position we took yesterday with respect to marriage -- the analysis--"
2012.12-307,5,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,5645.265,5651.571,"Is there any argument you can make to limit this to this case, vis-à-vis the Federal Government and not the States?"
2012.12-307,5,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,5651.571,5661.86,"--Well, as we said yesterday, we think it's an open question with respect to State recognition of marriage, and they may well be able to advance interests -- they may be able to advance it."
2012.12-307,5,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,5670.716,5671.132,Then yet -- but here--
2012.12-307,5,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,5671.132,5684.706,"--But -- but here, the Federal Government's not in the same position because as BLAG concedes, the Federal Government at the most can act at the margins in influencing these decisions about marriage and child rearing at the State level."
2012.12-307,5,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,5718.863,5721.749,"--Or if there's no interest -- I mean, I'm back where we were yesterday."
2012.12-307,5,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,5740.793,5747.047,"--But our point here, Justice Breyer, is that whatever -- may I finish?"
2012.12-307,5,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,5767.274,5768.31,"Thank you, General."
2012.12-307,6,39703,roberta_kaplan,,5778.582,5780.868,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2012.12-307,6,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,5830.701,5833.653,Could I ask you the same question I asked the Solicitor General?
2012.12-307,6,39703,roberta_kaplan,,5840.39,5840.89,Right.
2012.12-307,6,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,5840.89,5851.03,"--but a federalism issue, Congress said, we're going to recognize same-sex couples -- committed same-sex couples -- even if the State doesn't, for purposes of Federal law?"
2012.12-307,6,39703,roberta_kaplan,,5851.03,5857.001,"Obviously, with respect to marriage, the Federal Government has always used the State definitions."
2012.12-307,6,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,5867.809,5875.83,I just am asking whether you think Congress has the power to interfere with the -- to not adopt the State definition if they're extending benefits.
2012.12-307,6,39703,roberta_kaplan,,5877.415,5881.467,I think the question under the Equal Protection Clause is what -- is what the distinction is.
2012.12-307,6,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,5881.467,5882.05,"No, no."
2012.12-307,6,39703,roberta_kaplan,,5892.857,5895.809,With the Federal Government--
2012.12-307,6,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,5895.809,5905.015,"With Congress passing a law saying, we are going to adopt a different definition of marriage than those States that don't recognize same-sex marriage."
2012.12-307,6,39703,roberta_kaplan,,5911.586,5919.759,--It has certainly been argued in this case by others that -- whether or not that's in any way the powers of the Federal Government.
2012.12-307,6,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,5931.832,5933.001,I don't understand your answer.
2012.12-307,6,39703,roberta_kaplan,,5938.686,5945.273,I -- I think the Federal Government could extend benefits to gay couples to equalize things on a programmatic basis to make things more equal.
2012.12-307,6,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,5953.029,5966.103,"Well, it's just -- all these statutes use the term “ marriage ”, and the Federal Government says in all these statutes when it says marriage, it includes same-sex couples, whether the State acknowledges them to be married or not."
2012.12-307,6,39703,roberta_kaplan,,5966.103,5968.038,"But that -- I don't know if that would work, because they wouldn't--"
2012.12-307,6,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,5968.038,5969.138,What do you mean whether or not it would work?
2012.12-307,6,39703,roberta_kaplan,,5974.525,5977.31,--The power to marry people is a power that rests with the States.
2012.12-307,6,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,5977.31,5977.994,Yes.
2012.12-307,6,39703,roberta_kaplan,,5977.994,5979.577,The Federal Government doesn't issue marriage licenses.
2012.12-307,6,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,5980.177,5984.379,"Well, it's not doing that, it's just saying for purposes -- just what it's doing here."
2012.12-307,6,39703,roberta_kaplan,,6002.84,6007.41,"As long as the people were validly married under State law, and met the requirements of State law to get married--"
2012.12-307,6,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,6007.41,6008.377,"No, no, no, no."
2012.12-307,6,39703,roberta_kaplan,,6009.346,6018.718,"--I'm not sure that the Federal Government -- this answers your question, Justice Scalia -- I'm not sure the Federal Government can create a new Federal marriage that would be some kind of marriage that States don't permit."
2012.12-307,6,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,6018.718,6021.237,"Well, let me get to the question I asked Mr. Clement."
2012.12-307,6,39703,roberta_kaplan,,6032.794,6033.327,Yes.
2012.12-307,6,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,6034.927,6036.496,So it's just the word “ marriage ”?
2012.12-307,6,39703,roberta_kaplan,,6038.698,6040.498,"--Well, that's what the Federal Government has always chosen to do."
2012.12-307,6,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,6061.812,6071.42,"But if the estate tax follows State law, would not that create an equal protection problem similar to the one that exists here?"
2012.12-307,6,39703,roberta_kaplan,,6101.022,6103.155,"Well, let me -- let me answer that question very clearly."
2012.12-307,6,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,6152.472,6154.657,Just -- if I could follow up with one -- one question.
2012.12-307,6,39703,roberta_kaplan,,6178.805,6180.155,That would be certainly a different case.
2012.12-307,6,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,6256.122,6266.247,"What -- what do you think of his -- the argument that I heard was, to put the other side, at least one part of it as I understand it said: Look, the Federal Government needs a uniform rule."
2012.12-307,6,39703,roberta_kaplan,,6285.225,6285.925,I don't--
2012.12-307,6,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,6285.925,6288.344,--and the way to stay out of it is to go with the traditional thing.
2012.12-307,6,39703,roberta_kaplan,,6292.379,6294.415,"--I think it's an incorrect argument, Justice Breyer, for the--"
2012.12-307,6,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,6294.415,6296.432,I understand you do; I'd like to know the reason.
2012.12-307,6,39703,roberta_kaplan,,6296.682,6297.198,--Of course.
2012.12-307,6,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,6347.031,6348.715,Is the--
2012.12-307,6,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,6348.715,6356.82,"Now, the -- the discriminations are not the sexual orientation, but on a class of marriage; is that what you're--"
2012.12-307,6,39703,roberta_kaplan,,6356.82,6359.772,It's a class of married couples who are gay.
2012.12-307,6,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,6359.772,6363.407,--So I pose the same question I posed to the General to you.
2012.12-307,6,39703,roberta_kaplan,,6373.432,6376.065,I think that it's -- they're different cases.
2012.12-307,6,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,6449.932,6458.202,--So 84 Senators -- it's the same question I asked before; 84 Senators based their vote on moral disapproval of gay people?
2012.12-307,6,39703,roberta_kaplan,,6458.202,6473.981,"No, I think -- I think what is true, Mr. Chief Justice, is that times can blind, and that back in 1996 people did not have the understanding that they have today, that there is no distinction, there is no constitutionally permissible distinction--"
2012.12-307,6,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,6473.981,6475.747,"Well, does that mean -- times can blind."
2012.12-307,6,39703,roberta_kaplan,,6478.699,6480.715,--No; some clearly did.
2012.12-307,6,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,6505.349,6508.301,--Why -- why are you so confident in that -- in that judgment?
2012.12-307,6,39703,roberta_kaplan,,6513.103,6513.603,--Today?
2012.12-307,6,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,6514.103,6514.736,9.
2012.12-307,6,39703,roberta_kaplan,,6521.79,6526.761,"I think with respect to the understanding of gay people and their relationships there has been a sea change, Your Honor."
2012.12-307,6,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,6526.761,6531.398,How many States have civil unions now?
2012.12-307,6,39703,roberta_kaplan,,6531.398,6536.649,"I believe -- that was discussed in the arguments, 8 or 9, I believe."
2012.12-307,6,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,6536.649,6540.353,And how many had it in 1996?
2012.12-307,6,39703,roberta_kaplan,,6540.353,6542.872,"I -- yes, it was much, much fewer at the time."
2012.12-307,6,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,6545.674,6554.613,"I suppose the sea change has a lot to do with the political force and effectiveness of people representing, supporting your side of the case?"
2012.12-307,6,39703,roberta_kaplan,,6554.613,6571.389,"I disagree with that, Mr. Chief Justice, I think the sea change has to do, just as discussed was Bowers and Lawrence, was an understanding that there is no difference -- there was fundamental difference that could justify this kind of categorical discrimination between gay couples and straight couples."
2012.12-307,6,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,6571.389,6577.559,"You don't doubt that the lobby supporting the enactment of same sex-marriage laws in different States is politically powerful, do you?"
2012.12-307,6,39703,roberta_kaplan,,6577.559,6585.396,"With respect to that category, that categorization of the term for purposes of heightened scrutiny, I would, Your Honor."
2012.12-307,6,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,6586.163,6586.581,Really?
2012.12-307,6,39703,roberta_kaplan,,6586.581,6587.031,--Yes.
2012.12-307,6,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,6587.031,6594.468,"As far as I can tell, political figures are falling over themselves to endorse your side of the case."
2012.12-307,6,39703,roberta_kaplan,,6594.468,6605.493,"The fact of the matter is, Mr. Chief Justice, is that no other group in recent history has been subjected to popular referenda to take away rights that have already been given or exclude those rights, the way gay people have."
2012.12-307,6,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,6634.093,6648.353,"Well, but you just referred to a sea change in people's understandings and values from 1996, when DOMA was enacted, and I'm just trying to see where that comes from, if not from the political effectiveness of -- of groups on your side of the case."
2012.12-307,6,39703,roberta_kaplan,,6648.353,6661.511,"To flip the language of the House Report, Mr. Chief Justice, I think it comes from a moral understanding today that gay people are no different, and that gay married couples' relationships are not significantly different from the relationships of straight married couples."
2012.12-307,6,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,6661.944,6662.677,I understand that.
2012.12-307,6,39703,roberta_kaplan,,6670.199,6675.17,"--I -- I think it came -- is, again is very similar to the, what you saw between Bowers and Lawrence."
2012.12-307,6,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,6687.828,6689.328,"Thank you, Ms. Kaplan."
2012.12-307,7,37772,paul_d_clement,,6691.446,6697.267,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, just three points in rebuttal."
2012.12-307,7,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,6745.865,6749.317,"Rational basis, Mr. Clement -- is a problem in your briefing."
2012.12-307,7,37772,paul_d_clement,,6774.2,6774.984,--Well--
2012.12-307,7,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,6774.984,6778.002,And yet the Court said this is rank discrimination and it failed.
2012.12-307,7,37772,paul_d_clement,,6778.002,6785.908,"--And, Justice Ginsburg, applying rational basis to DOMA, I think that there are many rational bases that support it."
2012.12-307,7,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,6906.787,6908.087,"Thank you, counsel, counsel."
