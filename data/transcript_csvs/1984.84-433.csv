1984.84-433,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,12.079,We will hear arguments first this morning in School Committee of Burlington against the Department of Education of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.
1984.84-433,0,20571,david_berman,,15.801,45.603,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, on June 4th, 1979, the school officials of the town of Burlington conducted a core evaluation to determine the appropriate future placement for Michael Panico, a learning disabled child who is handicapped within the meaning of the Education of the Handicapped Act."
1984.84-433,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,185.393,191.457,Did he consult with the school authorities before that transfer was made?
1984.84-433,0,20571,david_berman,,191.457,196.17,"He informed the school authorities, Your Honor, that he was going to make a transfer."
1984.84-433,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,199.441,202.684,"Counsel, all this is five or six years ago."
1984.84-433,0,20571,david_berman,,205.125,215.063,"I am informed now, Your Honor, that the youngster is in a private school in Beverly, Massachusetts, called the Landmark School."
1984.84-433,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,415.976,429.464,"Mr. Berman, does it strike you as at all odd that Congress should have given the school authorities the right to appeal from the superintendent of education's decision to the federal court?"
1984.84-433,0,20571,david_berman,,429.464,446.724,"Well, no, it doesn't, Your Honor, really, strike me as odd, although I am constrained to admit that it did strike me odd when I first thought about the statute, and I thought, why would Congress want to give the school authorities this kind of power to seek review?"
1984.84-433,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,752.255,753.216,Mr. Berman.
1984.84-433,0,20571,david_berman,,753.216,753.907,"Yes, Your Honor."
1984.84-433,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,753.907,757.949,Do you plan to argue the legal issue that we have to resolve in this case?
1984.84-433,0,20571,david_berman,,757.949,759.01,"Yes, Your Honor."
1984.84-433,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,759.951,768.667,Because I didn't think that we were going to review the propriety of the IEP here.
1984.84-433,0,20571,david_berman,,792.152,796.895,"--Your Honor, there are actually two issues as to which this Court has granted certiorari."
1984.84-433,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,926.829,928.171,"Mr. Berman, could you help me?"
1984.84-433,0,20571,david_berman,,931.741,941.779,"Well, it is found amongst many other places at Page 28B of the statutory appendix to the petition for writ of certiorari."
1984.84-433,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,965.966,968.898,--It is at Page 127A.
1984.84-433,0,20571,david_berman,,972.411,987.779,"Now, there is yet another reason why the suggested reading that the parents would give this statute is untenable, because... notice what Congress says."
1984.84-433,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1040.086,1049.053,"Mr. Berman, your brief acknowledged that there was no effective placement in effect when the new IEP was drawn up."
1984.84-433,0,20571,david_berman,,1057.699,1060.04,"--I don't think my brief, Your Honor--"
1984.84-433,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1060.04,1061.181,Page 42.
1984.84-433,0,20571,david_berman,,1061.181,1064.271,"--acknowledges... it says, if there was no effective placement."
1984.84-433,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1073.257,1074.709,"Well, it just didn't seem to meet the language of the statute."
1984.84-433,0,20571,david_berman,,1074.709,1090.998,"--There is no effective placement in the sense that the parents have rejected the IEP, but there is certainly a placement, Your Honor, in the practical sense that there is a classroom to which this child is expected to report the following September."
1984.84-433,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1103.928,1106.018,"And it is effective without the parents' consent, in your view?"
1984.84-433,0,20571,david_berman,,1106.018,1106.89,"--Excuse me, Your Honor?"
1984.84-433,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1106.89,1110.473,"It is effective without the parents' agreement, in your view?"
1984.84-433,0,20571,david_berman,,1110.473,1112.153,As an interim basis.
1984.84-433,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1134.819,1138.33,"May I just be sure I understand, because this is why I was looking for the statute."
1984.84-433,0,20571,david_berman,,1148.267,1149.847,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1984.84-433,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1149.847,1154.291,Even though he hadn't yet enrolled and the parents hadn't consented?
1984.84-433,0,20571,david_berman,,1154.291,1157.653,"That is correct, Your Honor, yes."
1984.84-433,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1193.417,1198.289,"The words ""shall remain"" are a little bit hard to fit into that."
1984.84-433,0,20571,david_berman,,1204.103,1229.75,"Well, I would have to agree with Your Honor that the word ""remain"" is a troublesome word, but I think Congress in most instances considers remaining in the sense of remaining in a placement that has been put there on paper as opposed to remaining physically in a placement."
1984.84-433,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1229.75,1251.675,Isn't that some support for the position taken by your opponents that the purpose of this subsection of the statute was to prevent the removal by school authorities of a child who was in an effective placement without the consent of the parents?
1984.84-433,0,20571,david_berman,,1254.186,1257.999,"That is... the use of the word ""remain"" is some support for that, Your Honor."
1984.84-433,1,22543,ellen_l_janos,,1580.53,1590.368,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this case presents two question of statutory interpretation involving the Education of the Handicapped Act."
1984.84-433,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1605.505,1617.195,"What do you think Congress had in mind about parents taking these steps on their own initiative unilaterally, without consultation?"
1984.84-433,1,22543,ellen_l_janos,,1617.195,1621.978,We don't think Congress intended to bar parents from making traditional educational choices.
1984.84-433,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1633.005,1640.15,"Do you mean Congress contemplated that the parents could pick any school any place, any institution they wanted?"
1984.84-433,1,22543,ellen_l_janos,,1640.15,1644.321,Congress contemplated private school placements under the Act.
1984.84-433,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1686.949,1689.621,What if the decision had been unfavorable?
1984.84-433,1,22543,ellen_l_janos,,1697.025,1707.614,"If the decision had been unfavorable, the parents are then taking a risk by appealing to state or federal court that they may not prevail, and that they may not get any reimbursement."
1984.84-433,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1710.375,1720.66,"So they have no... if the school is providing a proper plan, the parents unilaterally may not remove them and get reimbursement?"
1984.84-433,1,22543,ellen_l_janos,,1720.66,1722.803,We believe they can remove them at any time they want.
1984.84-433,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1722.803,1723.124,Yes.
1984.84-433,1,22543,ellen_l_janos,,1723.793,1725.074,But they may not be able to collect for reimbursement--
1984.84-433,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1725.074,1725.465,Exactly.
1984.84-433,1,22543,ellen_l_janos,,1725.465,1731.84,"--if the state finds that the town's plan is appropriate, which was not the case here, and if the Court ultimately finds that the town's plan is appropriate."
1984.84-433,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1731.84,1741.874,"But ultimately, ultimately there was a court finding that the plan was all right."
1984.84-433,1,22543,ellen_l_janos,,1741.874,1744.348,"That court finding has been set aside, Your Honor."
1984.84-433,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1757.286,1759.385,What did the Court of Appeals do with that plan?
1984.84-433,1,22543,ellen_l_janos,,1761.917,1770.204,--The Court of Appeals found that the District Court failed to take into consideration a number of factors that the state hearing officer had.
1984.84-433,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1778.82,1787.135,"Well, suppose the District Court considers everything it is supposed to and still rules against the parents?"
1984.84-433,1,22543,ellen_l_janos,,1791.219,1803.805,"We agree with the First Circuit's decision that at least for the period, the year period that the state ordered the child in the private school, the parents should not be financially responsible for that period."
1984.84-433,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1815.563,1824.849,What are these procedural violations that the state hearing officer and the Court of Appeals felt were important?
1984.84-433,1,22543,ellen_l_janos,,1824.849,1842.059,The year before the town had proposed a plan for the child and had in the middle of the year or actually closer to the beginning of the year cut the child's special education reading time in half without any notice to the parents.
1984.84-433,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1842.059,1847.094,How did the Court of Appeals feel that that bore on the plan now proposed?
1984.84-433,1,22543,ellen_l_janos,,1847.094,1855.34,The Court of Appeals believed the District Court should consider that in determining whether the town had the ability and the capacity to implement that plan.
1984.84-433,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1855.34,1856.542,Does that make much sense to you?
1984.84-433,1,22543,ellen_l_janos,,1856.542,1857.894,To some extent it does.
1984.84-433,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1862.055,1865.308,"Well, were there repeated and continuing procedural violations?"
1984.84-433,1,22543,ellen_l_janos,,1865.308,1868.42,"There were... the hearing officer in this case found yes, and we believe yes."
1984.84-433,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1868.42,1871.064,What were they in addition to the one you have already given?
1984.84-433,1,22543,ellen_l_janos,,1871.064,1881.86,In earlier years the town had failed to notify the parents regarding certain meetings that were supposed to take place.
1984.84-433,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1881.86,1884.913,That is all now to be assessed against the school board on this new plan?
1984.84-433,1,22543,ellen_l_janos,,1884.913,1889.283,That is all to be taken into consideration in two respects on remand.
1984.84-433,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1895.378,1902.654,How could procedural violations in a preceding year affect as plan that is now up on the merits?
1984.84-433,1,22543,ellen_l_janos,,1902.654,1908.478,It might affect the town's ability to implement a new plan.
1984.84-433,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1971.957,1979.404,Who ultimately passes on the appropriateness of the amount of the cost?
1984.84-433,1,22543,ellen_l_janos,,1979.404,2003.601,"I believe the First Circuit has instructed the District Courts to determine at the conclusion of the judicial proceedings what would be the appropriate amount of reimbursement if indeed reimbursement is sought, and instructed the District Courts to take into consideration the prevailing party, of course, and other traditional equitable factors."
1984.84-433,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2005.331,2024.393,"Well, I would assume that if the parents unilaterally decided that some specialist in Paris or Geneva was the best remedy for the problem, if they sent the child off abroad, they might have difficulty collecting all the costs."
1984.84-433,1,22543,ellen_l_janos,,2024.902,2027.395,"They might have difficulty in that situation, yes."
1984.84-433,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2110.538,2129.472,"Ms. Janos, in your reading of Section 1415(e)(3), do you think that the language of it should be interpreted to mean that the state in this case and the parents have agreed?"
1984.84-433,1,22543,ellen_l_janos,,2129.472,2131.152,"Yes, that's correct, Your Honor."
1984.84-433,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2131.152,2139.438,And it is your position that the state as such by virtue of the board's ruling has agreed with this placement?
1984.84-433,1,22543,ellen_l_janos,,2139.438,2140.899,That's correct.
1984.84-433,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2156.389,2173.531,"Now, if we were to disagree with the Court of Appeals on the meaning of 1415(e)(3), do I understand that Massachusetts has a state law that would allow reimbursement of tuition in any event?"
1984.84-433,1,22543,ellen_l_janos,,2173.531,2174.693,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1984.84-433,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2174.693,2177.644,Regardless of how we decide--
1984.84-433,1,22543,ellen_l_janos,,2177.644,2178.585,"Well, this case--"
1984.84-433,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2178.585,2180.135,--1415 should be interpreted?
1984.84-433,1,22543,ellen_l_janos,,2180.135,2181.935,--Not exactly.
1984.84-433,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2192.913,2193.645,It said it was preempted.
1984.84-433,1,22543,ellen_l_janos,,2193.645,2194.133,Yes.
1984.84-433,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2194.133,2196.244,The state statute was preempted.
1984.84-433,1,22543,ellen_l_janos,,2196.244,2197.406,That's correct.
1984.84-433,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2202.378,2204.001,"All right, so that question is not before us, the--"
1984.84-433,1,22543,ellen_l_janos,,2204.001,2204.601,"No, it is not."
1984.84-433,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2267.351,2268.833,--Yet it seems to have done that.
1984.84-433,1,22543,ellen_l_janos,,2268.833,2270.624,It seems to have done that.
1984.84-433,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2353.878,2355.04,May I ask this question?
1984.84-433,1,22543,ellen_l_janos,,2355.04,2355.999,Yes.
1984.84-433,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2355.999,2362.042,"Assuming there has been cooperation, and finally in the end the parents and school district disagree."
1984.84-433,1,22543,ellen_l_janos,,2372.972,2379.603,The party who is appealing from the state agency decision should bear the burden of overturning that state agency decision.
1984.84-433,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2379.603,2381.035,That means the parents?
1984.84-433,1,22543,ellen_l_janos,,2381.035,2384.058,"In this case, of course, the town appealed."
1984.84-433,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2394.524,2404.622,The parents in this case finally placed the child in a school that had not been approved by the school district?
1984.84-433,1,22543,ellen_l_janos,,2404.622,2406.572,That was not in the plan.
1984.84-433,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2412.947,2413.999,Yes.
1984.84-433,1,22543,ellen_l_janos,,2413.999,2427.796,"The parents, of course, are in a difficult choice at that point when they have... in this case there was advice from the child's teacher and the child's doctor that the school could not offer an appropriate placement."
1984.84-433,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2453.052,2467.362,"Are you suggesting that unless we agree with you, the local school would have left the child in that placement that the parent and the locals agreed was inadequate, was not right?"
1984.84-433,1,22543,ellen_l_janos,,2467.362,2471.704,"--If we take the petitioners' reading of that statute, the parents cannot move their child--"
1984.84-433,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2471.704,2472.255,"Well, I thought--"
1984.84-433,1,22543,ellen_l_janos,,2472.255,2474.306,--and the child would have had to remain in that--
1984.84-433,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2474.306,2478.49,"--Well, that's right, but the school wouldn't have left him in that inappropriate placement."
1984.84-433,1,22543,ellen_l_janos,,2483.633,2489.146,"--Well, it is their proposed placement which our state found inappropriate, so that--"
1984.84-433,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2489.146,2492.439,"Well, that may be."
1984.84-433,1,22543,ellen_l_janos,,2496.582,2502.005,"--They could have, of course, but then they would need to go through all of the procedures for removing the child."
1984.84-433,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2502.005,2506.547,We are only dealing here with the proposed placement--
1984.84-433,1,22543,ellen_l_janos,,2506.547,2507.859,That's correct.
1984.84-433,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2507.859,2510.711,--that the school district had proposed.
1984.84-433,1,22543,ellen_l_janos,,2510.711,2511.281,That's correct.
1984.84-433,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2511.281,2515.093,And which the parents and the state have found was inappropriate.
1984.84-433,1,22543,ellen_l_janos,,2515.093,2520.188,"That's correct, and which is now going back for trial to determine that."
1984.84-433,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2523.53,2529.733,Mr. Rosenberg.
1984.84-433,2,21459,david_w_rosenberg,,2529.733,2549.305,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, I want to address the three factual points that will, I hope, place the question of the appropriate construction of 1415(e)(3) in proper context for the Court."
1984.84-433,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2655.417,2659.441,"Of course, you and your opponent disagree on what the then current placement was."
1984.84-433,2,21459,david_w_rosenberg,,2659.441,2661.701,I understand that we disagree.

1984.84-433,2,21459,david_w_rosenberg,,2681.974,2682.785,--That is my--
1984.84-433,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2682.785,2685.677,"It seems to me one can argue it either way, is all I am suggesting."
1984.84-433,2,21459,david_w_rosenberg,,2685.677,2695.192,"--In my view, the then current placement was where the child was at the time the IEP in question--"
1984.84-433,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2695.192,2695.563,He was on vacation.
1984.84-433,2,21459,david_w_rosenberg,,2698.144,2708.152,"--Not at the time the individual educational plan which is the subject of this entire proceeding, was being constructed."
1984.84-433,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2720.59,2722.213,Don't we... excuse me.
1984.84-433,2,21459,david_w_rosenberg,,2731.169,2731.97,"Yes, there is--"
1984.84-433,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2731.97,2733.049,--a concrete proposal?
1984.84-433,2,21459,david_w_rosenberg,,2733.049,2733.981,--There is--
1984.84-433,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2733.981,2734.471,Verbal?
1984.84-433,2,21459,david_w_rosenberg,,2734.471,2735.751,"--Yes, Your Honor, there--"
1984.84-433,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2735.751,2736.973,It was verbal?
1984.84-433,2,21459,david_w_rosenberg,,2736.973,2743.377,--The proposal which the town made is found in the joint appendix.
1984.84-433,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2768.582,2774.486,"Mr. Rosenberg, don't we have another threshold question as to what is the relevant date for deciding what the last current placement was?"
1984.84-433,2,21459,david_w_rosenberg,,2788.406,2789.356,"Well, I--"
1984.84-433,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2789.356,2793.609,--Isn't there room for argument on which is the right date to focus on?
1984.84-433,2,21459,david_w_rosenberg,,2793.609,2797.563,--There is room for argument because it has been argued.
1984.84-433,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2828.263,2830.664,Could I just... excuse me.
1984.84-433,2,21459,david_w_rosenberg,,2840.161,2841.072,--That's correct.
1984.84-433,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2841.072,2843.564,But the placement was still... there was still a placement.
1984.84-433,2,21459,david_w_rosenberg,,2843.564,2845.585,That's right.
1984.84-433,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2845.585,2854.4,"And just because they disagreed, or just because they agreed on that and disagreed on the new placement didn't remove the fact that there was a placement."
1984.84-433,2,21459,david_w_rosenberg,,2854.4,2859.793,"Well, there was a placement, and it was in the Memorial School--"
1984.84-433,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2859.793,2870.181,"So I don't understand how you can argue that there is no room for 1415(e)(3) at all, because there was a placement."
1984.84-433,2,21459,david_w_rosenberg,,2870.181,2883.87,"--There was a placement, and it would be the height, I think, of absurdity to have the child placed in a placement, the Memorial School, which both the town and the parents had agreed was inappropriate."
1984.84-433,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2883.87,2896.779,"Well, it may also be absurd then to say that therefore 1415(e)(3) has no place at all because you cannot consider the new placement."
1984.84-433,2,21459,david_w_rosenberg,,2896.779,2899.059,It may well be.
1984.84-433,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2899.059,2901.86,It certainly... at least there was a placement.
1984.84-433,2,21459,david_w_rosenberg,,2906.633,2908.005,That's correct.
1984.84-433,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2908.005,2916.38,And that is certainly one... one aim of the Act is to have the public schools provide these placements.
1984.84-433,2,21459,david_w_rosenberg,,2916.38,2917.061,That's correct.
1984.84-433,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3029.375,3050.738,"What if the child is being mainstreamed under this type of program and has been in placement in a sixth grade, in a school district which has an elementary school that goes only through sixth grade, then in the next year he would normally be expected to go to junior high school, in a different building, a different school."
1984.84-433,2,21459,david_w_rosenberg,,3059.923,3073.243,"Well, Your Honor, they do not in the normal case, with all due respect, arise in my view if people are doing... following the regulations properly in the summer."
1984.84-433,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3074.733,3080.308,"Well, whether they arise or not, what is the child's placement during the summer between the sixth and seventh grades?"
1984.84-433,2,21459,david_w_rosenberg,,3080.308,3081.919,--It is the prior placement.
1984.84-433,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3085.95,3092.385,And would it be a new placement for the child to move in the normal progress of age to the seventh grade?
1984.84-433,2,21459,david_w_rosenberg,,3092.385,3108.876,"Well, in that case, Your Honor, I think if he was simply moving from the same type of class, let's say a regular sixth grade to a regular seventh grade class, I believe it would be difficult for me to maintain that the sixth grade was the correct placement."
1984.84-433,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3123.056,3133.154,"In other words, placement may not refer at all to the normal progression of a child within the same type of class in the public school system."
1984.84-433,2,21459,david_w_rosenberg,,3137.435,3139.094,--That's what I believe.
1984.84-433,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3340.927,3345.779,In that event I suppose the state will have to pay the parents.
1984.84-433,2,21459,david_w_rosenberg,,3345.779,3347.291,The state?
1984.84-433,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3347.291,3349.292,Or the local school district.
1984.84-433,2,21459,david_w_rosenberg,,3349.292,3351.603,"Well, that is my view."
1984.84-433,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3368.126,3369.986,"Do you have anything further, Mr. Berman?"
1984.84-433,3,20571,david_berman,,3369.986,3371.769,Briefly.
1984.84-433,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3373.96,3378.181,"Is that your position, the position that the gentleman has stated?"
1984.84-433,3,20571,david_berman,,3378.181,3379.443,"--No, it is not, Your Honor."
1984.84-433,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3398.536,3406.641,"Let's suppose you completely lose in all respects what is on the remand to the District Court, on the new trial."
1984.84-433,3,20571,david_berman,,3406.641,3407.092,Yes.
1984.84-433,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3407.092,3410.813,Let's assume it is found that whatever plans you had were wholly inadequate.
1984.84-433,3,20571,david_berman,,3420.699,3422.141,"Yes, we do say that, Your Honor."
1984.84-433,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3422.141,3422.871,That is what I thought.
1984.84-433,3,20571,david_berman,,3422.871,3423.592,Yes.
1984.84-433,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3472.314,3472.705,"Mr. Berman, just a minute."
1984.84-433,3,20571,david_berman,,3481.709,3483.331,"Yes, I understand that, Your Honor, but--"
1984.84-433,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3483.331,3484.631,Then you can't say it is totally without remedy.
1984.84-433,3,20571,david_berman,,3484.631,3491.917,"--It is, though, because if the local... if the IEP is found to be a good IEP, they are always stuck with the cost."
1984.84-433,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3491.917,3499.583,"Are you saying that if it is ultimately found to have been a bad IEP, they had a duty to leave the child there for the entire period it takes to litigate the question?"
1984.84-433,3,20571,david_berman,,3499.583,3501.193,"Your Honor, they had a duty to--"
1984.84-433,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3501.193,3502.463,Is that your position?
1984.84-433,3,20571,david_berman,,3502.463,3507.146,"--Well, they certainly... yes, they had a duty to leave the child there at least--"
1984.84-433,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3507.146,3509.767,No matter how bad the IEP might have been?
1984.84-433,3,20571,david_berman,,3509.767,3510.158,--it was--
1984.84-433,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3510.158,3512.218,No matter how bad the IEP might have been?
1984.84-433,3,20571,david_berman,,3512.218,3514.111,"--Except for one thing, Your Honor."
1984.84-433,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3522.046,3527.389,"But until they get a court to act or judicial relief of some kind, the child must remain there at all--"
1984.84-433,3,20571,david_berman,,3527.389,3530.091,The child must remain in his current placement.
1984.84-433,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3598.926,3599.737,"Thank you, counsel."
