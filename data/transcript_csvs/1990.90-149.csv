1990.90-149,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.157,"We'll hear argument next in No. 90-149, Michigan against Lucas."
1990.90-149,0,20485,don_w_atkins,,46.292,50.434,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.90-149,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,158.465,167.1,"Well, Mr. Atkins, in this case aren't we dealing just with the notice requirement of this statute?"
1990.90-149,0,20485,don_w_atkins,,169.582,170.884,"Precisely correct, Your Honor."
1990.90-149,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,170.884,181.871,And the statute does not itself specify what the trial court will do if the notice is not given in a timely fashion.
1990.90-149,0,20485,don_w_atkins,,181.871,183.049,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1990.90-149,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,183.049,196.76,And in this case the trial court decided to preclude the testimony and the evidence because of the failure to comply with the notice requirement.
1990.90-149,0,20485,don_w_atkins,,196.76,197.521,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1990.90-149,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,197.521,208.468,And the Michigan court of appeals held that preclusion of the evidence in every case would be unconstitutional.
1990.90-149,0,20485,don_w_atkins,,208.468,210.128,I believe that's what they said.
1990.90-149,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,210.829,222.587,"So that's what we have to review, whether that approach is correct and whether there might be some cases were preclusion is allowable."
1990.90-149,0,20485,don_w_atkins,,222.587,223.298,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1990.90-149,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,265.185,268.547,"The statute simply doesn't say what the remedy is, does it?"
1990.90-149,0,20485,don_w_atkins,,268.547,269.236,"No, it does not, Your Honor."
1990.90-149,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,281.004,287.438,"You said there were two interests that the State had, and one is the privacy rights of the victim, and what's the other?"
1990.90-149,0,20485,don_w_atkins,,287.438,292.173,"The other one is the balancing of the rights of the defendant, the confrontational rights of the defendant."
1990.90-149,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,318.059,323.652,Is there much doubt in this case but that the evidence should not have been admitted had the notice been given?
1990.90-149,0,20485,don_w_atkins,,323.652,326.454,"Should not have been admitted, Your Honor?"
1990.90-149,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,326.454,327.664,Or should have been admitted?
1990.90-149,0,20485,don_w_atkins,,327.664,345.876,"Taking it either way, Your Honor, I think there is a legitimate argument that could be made, and I think I attempted to make it earlier in my brief, that what I think we were dealing with in this particular case was not so much the evidence of the actual details of the sexual encounters that they experienced in a previous time before this event."
1990.90-149,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,385.023,395.37,"Well, do you think that if there had been a hearing in the case the judge would have given certain instructions and rulings as to the extent to which this relationship could have been described?"
1990.90-149,0,20485,don_w_atkins,,395.37,398.001,I don't think there's any question but that the judge could have fashioned a remedy.
1990.90-149,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,429.802,442.722,"Well, are you saying that there are substantial privacy rights of the victim that could and would likely have been protected in this case had some advance notice, particularly the notice required by the statute, been given?"
1990.90-149,0,20485,don_w_atkins,,442.722,443.86,That is precisely my point.
1990.90-149,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,443.86,452.987,What happens in a preliminary hearing in a case like this?
1990.90-149,0,20485,don_w_atkins,,459.061,460.203,It was in fact.
1990.90-149,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,460.203,470.548,"That doesn't sound like it's got, that the State has much interest in the privacy of the victim, if a public preliminary hearing washes all this linen."
1990.90-149,0,20485,don_w_atkins,,470.548,477.964,"It is true, Your Honor, and it's quite regrettable, and I believe, and I'll admit to the Court that I think the prosecutor at the preliminary examination simply dropped the ball."
1990.90-149,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,479.694,482.025,Would the statute apply to the preliminary hearing?
1990.90-149,0,20485,don_w_atkins,,482.025,486.8,"--I believe it would have, because the statute is silent as to what occurs prior to trial."
1990.90-149,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,497.056,498.127,On what grounds?
1990.90-149,0,20485,don_w_atkins,,498.127,500.999,"The examination... well, if nothing else, Your Honor, certainly on relevance grounds."
1990.90-149,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,519.12,522.871,Was this... was this testimony at the preliminary brought out by the prosecutor?
1990.90-149,0,20485,don_w_atkins,,522.871,527.597,"No, it was brought out by defense counsel during his cross-examination of the witness."
1990.90-149,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,530.187,534.389,Are there provisions in Michigan for closing the preliminary hearings?
1990.90-149,0,20485,don_w_atkins,,534.389,538.763,"There are provisions, Your Honor, but I don't believe it would have applied in this case anyway."
1990.90-149,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,569.264,570.944,The trial is before a 12-person jury?
1990.90-149,0,20485,don_w_atkins,,570.944,572.674,This one wasn't.
1990.90-149,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,575.499,576.758,Was this a bench trial?
1990.90-149,0,20485,don_w_atkins,,576.758,581.272,--It ended up being a bench trial after the oral motion made on the day of trial was denied.
1990.90-149,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,592.138,600.813,"Mr. Atkins, what is the State's... there's no question about the interest in the victim's privacy or in the defendant's right to confrontation."
1990.90-149,0,20485,don_w_atkins,,607.889,610.292,10 days after the arraignment on the information.
1990.90-149,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,662.556,672.543,"--So that we really ought to look at it not so much as a case requiring, or a statute requiring notice 10 days after arraignment, but requiring notice say 3 or 4 weeks before the trial date?"
1990.90-149,0,20485,don_w_atkins,,676.264,688.682,"I think it could have been done either way, Your Honor, but I think the arraignment on the information date was selected because, quite frankly, Federal felony trials such as this could be tried, certainly in Wayne County even though it's a busy metropolitan court, anywhere from 2 to 4 weeks after the arraignment."
1990.90-149,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,767.293,774.019,"Well, Mr. Atkins, I didn't think the court below addressed the question of whether the notice period is too short."
1990.90-149,0,20485,don_w_atkins,,775.621,776.69,"No, I don't believe it is."
1990.90-149,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,776.69,777.321,No?
1990.90-149,0,20485,don_w_atkins,,777.321,778.142,That particular question is not.
1990.90-149,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,778.142,800.955,"And why isn't the State's interest sufficiently protected, even though the request comes late to consider this testimony and offer it, if the trial court grants an in camera hearing and considers alternative sanctions but lets the evidence in?"
1990.90-149,0,20485,don_w_atkins,,807.34,809.07,"It could be in other situations, Your Honor."
1990.90-149,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,836.348,838.521,"Mr. Atkins, can I interrupt?"
1990.90-149,0,20485,don_w_atkins,,867.199,868.889,"Oh, yes, Your Honor, I believe it is."
1990.90-149,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,868.889,872.913,Where in the opinion do they say anything about... they don't cite the Sixth Amendment or any Federal cases.
1990.90-149,0,20485,don_w_atkins,,872.913,874.235,I believe they did in the initial opinion.
1990.90-149,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,878.917,880.808,"By the initial opinion, do you mean the opinion in this case or in the Williams case?"
1990.90-149,0,20485,don_w_atkins,,880.808,883.99,"No, in this case, which relied upon the Williams decision."
1990.90-149,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,896.098,896.619,Right.
1990.90-149,0,20485,don_w_atkins,,896.619,898.439,"--at 95 Michigan appeals, I believe it is."
1990.90-149,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,903.864,904.332,I'm asking about this case.
1990.90-149,0,20485,don_w_atkins,,909.618,911.719,"I think it makes it clearer, Your Honor, that in fact the Lucas--"
1990.90-149,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,911.719,919.074,Can you tell me whether on the face of this opinion there is a reasonable basis for believing this decision was based on Federal law?
1990.90-149,0,20485,don_w_atkins,,919.074,922.425,"--Yes, Your Honor, I do, because it in turn relied upon the Williams case."
1990.90-149,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,922.425,924.966,Just because it cited a Michigan case which in turn relied on it.
1990.90-149,0,20485,don_w_atkins,,929.22,930.632,"I think you could do that, yes, Your Honor."
1990.90-149,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,930.632,932.162,"Well, you must do it, isn't that true?"
1990.90-149,0,20485,don_w_atkins,,932.162,934.943,"If the Sixth Amendment is not mentioned in the Lucas opinion, then you, of course--"
1990.90-149,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,934.943,938.257,I don't find it mentioned and I don't find any Federal cases cited.
1990.90-149,0,20485,don_w_atkins,,947.072,947.712,"--Yes, it did."
1990.90-149,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,947.712,953.946,"Mr. Atkins, I just want to go back to something you said in response to one of Justice O'Connor's questions."
1990.90-149,0,20485,don_w_atkins,,960.9,961.551,Yes.
1990.90-149,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,961.551,962.081,Okay.
1990.90-149,0,20485,don_w_atkins,,962.081,962.732,Absolutely.
1990.90-149,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,988.388,990.709,"Very well, Mr. Atkins."
1990.90-149,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,992.101,999.535,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.90-149,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1049.187,1055.412,"May I ask, General Starr, in the survey, is this the only statute that has this particular 10-day notice requirement?"
1990.90-149,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1055.412,1056.854,That is correct.
1990.90-149,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1067.168,1074.705,"But the only reason I ask you, I suppose if we affirm in this case it would not necessarily invalidate the rape shield statutes all over the country."
1990.90-149,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1074.705,1082.6,"Well, except that the ground on which this statute was invalidated did not have to do with the timing of the notice."
1990.90-149,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1134.943,1138.907,"Yes, but the trial judge would have excluded it even if the offer had been made on the eleventh day, as I understand."
1990.90-149,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1138.907,1142.168,"--Oh, I disagree with that, with all respect, Justice Stevens."
1990.90-149,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1177.212,1181.833,All I did was read the court of appeals opinion which says based solely on the failure to comply with the notice provision.
1990.90-149,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1181.833,1184.326,--There was a complete failure to--
1990.90-149,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1184.326,1186.227,And that was the sole reason for their decision.
1990.90-149,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1186.227,1188.488,--But at a critical point.
1990.90-149,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1188.488,1191.73,"So we have to examine the trial transcript to find out the grounds for decision, too?"
1990.90-149,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1193.591,1203.108,"I don't think that there is... the specific issue that is before the Court is, as Justice O'Connor was suggesting, a very narrow one."
1990.90-149,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1318.143,1321.795,"Why would trial before a judge make any difference than trial before a jury on that point, General Starr?"
1990.90-149,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1321.795,1325.6,"--Well, the evidence... I simply mean that... it makes none."
1990.90-149,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1364.074,1365.764,"It wasn't marginal, General Starr."
1990.90-149,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1372.7,1382.367,"--This Court, in reversing a State trial on confrontation clause grounds, has looked to whether this was critical evidence."
1990.90-149,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1413.957,1427.514,"Well, General Starr, I suppose we don't have to decide that question because the court below didn't make any findings on the critical nature of the evidence or the prejudice to the defendant here."
1990.90-149,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1427.514,1428.856,That is exactly correct.
1990.90-149,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1430.005,1430.646,It could be remanded.
1990.90-149,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1430.646,1440.614,"--The issue is very narrow as to whether this kind of notice requirement, which is found in the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, is unconstitutional per se."
1990.90-149,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1440.614,1445.957,"So, well... we should remand and say what?"
1990.90-149,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1457.235,1459.308,It seems to me that the Court can--
1990.90-149,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1459.308,1460.367,Suppose it was crucial evidence.
1990.90-149,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1461.258,1465.031,--If it were crucial evidence I think we would have a different case under Chambers--
1990.90-149,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1465.031,1465.94,I know we'd have a different case.
1990.90-149,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1466.901,1468.13,--I think the result might be different.
1990.90-149,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1470.013,1471.502,"Well, would it?"
1990.90-149,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1471.502,1472.484,Not here.
1990.90-149,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1477.156,1477.567,I know it.
1990.90-149,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1483.15,1483.641,"--Oh, yes."
1990.90-149,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1484.021,1484.973,"I mean, there are a lot of other provisions."
1990.90-149,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1495.209,1495.81,Quite right.
1990.90-149,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1495.81,1496.811,Do you have to let that witness on?
1990.90-149,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1496.811,1497.72,No.
1990.90-149,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1508.047,1514.292,This whole thing is governed by what a State can do with respect to individual cumulative witnesses is governed by the Constitution?
1990.90-149,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1514.292,1516.022,It can be under this Court's--
1990.90-149,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1516.022,1518.393,Chambers is a total sport.
1990.90-149,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1521.257,1529.011,"--Well, this Court has looked to the importance of evidence, including more recently in Rock against Arkansas."
1990.90-149,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1558.01,1560.702,"Thank you, General Starr."
1990.90-149,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1560.702,1561.142,Thank you.
1990.90-149,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1561.142,1562.193,Mr. Magidson.
1990.90-149,2,36385,mark_h_magidson,,1562.193,1567.707,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.90-149,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1629.229,1637.163,"Mr. Magidson, are you saying that all the others, the other 47 States all have that particular exception?"
1990.90-149,2,36385,mark_h_magidson,,1637.163,1637.544,--Yes.
1990.90-149,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1683.743,1691.147,"Well, we don't have the question of the validity of the time of the notice before us in this case, though, do we?"
1990.90-149,2,36385,mark_h_magidson,,1691.147,1691.778,"No, that's correct."
1990.90-149,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1691.778,1697.272,"Granted, it's short, but I didn't think we had to decide that... decide it on that basis here."
1990.90-149,2,36385,mark_h_magidson,,1697.272,1697.983,"No, you don't."
1990.90-149,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1699.525,1700.494,Uh-huh.
1990.90-149,2,36385,mark_h_magidson,,1700.494,1710.591,"--it's so out of proportion, the length of time is so out of proportion to all of the other jurisdictions, including the Federal rule, that I think it's significant, that it raises an issue."
1990.90-149,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1710.591,1711.061,Now... yes.
1990.90-149,2,36385,mark_h_magidson,,1726.64,1729.004,"No, Justice O'Connor."
1990.90-149,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1729.004,1731.675,"In essence that appeared to be its holding, a per se rule."
1990.90-149,2,36385,mark_h_magidson,,1731.675,1732.075,No.
1990.90-149,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1756.84,1779.327,"Well, it certainly appears, if you look at the authorities they rely on, that the Michigan court of appeals thinks at least that in all cases where it would preclude evidence of sexual conduct between a victim and the defendant, that preclusion cannot be imposed."
1990.90-149,2,36385,mark_h_magidson,,1783.168,1784.67,The court painted with a broad brush.
1990.90-149,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1785.642,1790.823,"Well, if that was its rule, do you think that's accurate?"
1990.90-149,2,36385,mark_h_magidson,,1800.899,1801.4,Yes.
1990.90-149,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1848.871,1854.945,"Mr. Magidson, why, why isn't it always an appropriate sanction, at least as far as the Federal Constitution is concerned?"
1990.90-149,2,36385,mark_h_magidson,,1854.945,1855.786,Because--
1990.90-149,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1855.786,1859.35,Why isn't it always all right to insist upon the rules of trial?
1990.90-149,2,36385,mark_h_magidson,,1890.268,1892.54,"--Well, first this was before the trial started."
1990.90-149,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1892.54,1896.423,"Well, it's a different time, it's a different rule, but it's the same principle."
1990.90-149,2,36385,mark_h_magidson,,1902.997,1904.588,I would agree--
1990.90-149,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1904.588,1905.319,What's the matter with that?
1990.90-149,2,36385,mark_h_magidson,,1905.319,1913.272,"--The problem here is that there was no evidence that he intentionally, in this case she intentionally disregarded the court rule."
1990.90-149,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1913.663,1916.445,"Well, in my hypothetical counsel just forgot."
1990.90-149,2,36385,mark_h_magidson,,1920.548,1921.717,--And the court can.
1990.90-149,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1951.327,1955.59,"Is that a constitutional ruling of the Supreme Court of Michigan, or just an interpretation of the statute?"
1990.90-149,2,36385,mark_h_magidson,,1955.59,1958.142,--It's interpretation of the statute.
1990.90-149,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1967.288,1970.401,"But that, but that's the issue for the discretion of the judge."
1990.90-149,2,36385,mark_h_magidson,,1983.528,1986.871,--It becomes a constitutional issue where... it's a balancing test.
1990.90-149,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2010.756,2017.232,"You would extend that to the first hypothetical I gave you also, to where the trial is over, the jury is retired, and you want to get in additional evidence?"
1990.90-149,2,36385,mark_h_magidson,,2017.232,2017.833,--Based on--
1990.90-149,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2017.833,2018.323,You would extend that rule?
1990.90-149,2,36385,mark_h_magidson,,2019.595,2027.039,--I don't think that there should be a per se blanket... per se preclusion under any circumstances.
1990.90-149,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2035.067,2036.195,I don't know why it's more extreme.
1990.90-149,2,36385,mark_h_magidson,,2040.268,2047.241,"--Well, if the reason perhaps is that the defense counsel suffered a stroke or something during trial and didn't recall, I don't know all the possibilities."
1990.90-149,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2047.241,2049.803,I don't think the Constitution requires a State to do that.
1990.90-149,2,36385,mark_h_magidson,,2057.418,2066.114,"Well, the problem, at least with this statute as it was interpreted by the trial judge, the statute itself is silent."
1990.90-149,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2128.266,2136.531,"But the Michigan court of appeals, as I read their opinion, Mr. Magidson, didn't rely at all on the first part, on the first of the two problems you say."
1990.90-149,2,36385,mark_h_magidson,,2143.447,2145.287,"No, that's correct."
1990.90-149,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2226.23,2244.67,"But that... didn't... wasn't their stated reason for saying this thing is applied or this statute was unconstitutional was that you could not preclude testimony about past relationships between the defendant and the victim, whatever you could do with respect to third parties?"
1990.90-149,2,36385,mark_h_magidson,,2244.67,2245.371,No.
1990.90-149,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2368.996,2389.66,"Was part of the reason of the Michigan court of appeals' holding that this... the purpose of the statute was only to provide notice and give the State a chance to investigate this testimony, and since it was testimony only involving the defendant and the victim there was no need for that sort of investigation?"
1990.90-149,2,36385,mark_h_magidson,,2389.66,2393.222,--I think that was the thrust of the analysis of the Michigan court of appeals.
1990.90-149,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2393.222,2409.143,"And then they in effect rejected the State's claim that this evidence, quite apart from notice, could be reviewed and excluded if it was not material?"
1990.90-149,2,36385,mark_h_magidson,,2409.143,2431.247,"I think the court of appeals indicated that this becomes like just a normal type of weighing the prejudicial effect versus probative value, and that if it was in fact more prejudicial than probative, then it wouldn't be admitted and that a separate hearing could have been held outside the presence of the jury to do that."
1990.90-149,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2433.63,2457.764,"Well, they, the Michigan court of appeals reversed this conviction because, as I read it, it said that, that what is left is the usual evidentiary issues of the materiality of the evidence to the issues in the case and the balancing of its probative value with the danger of unfair prejudice."
1990.90-149,2,36385,mark_h_magidson,,2466.392,2467.873,That's true.
1990.90-149,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2467.873,2469.433,--excluded the evidence on those grounds.
1990.90-149,2,36385,mark_h_magidson,,2469.433,2469.833,That's true.
1990.90-149,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2469.833,2476.737,"So, it sounds... it doesn't sound to me like the Michigan court of appeals was saying there's a per se rule--"
1990.90-149,2,36385,mark_h_magidson,,2476.737,2477.488,No.
1990.90-149,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2477.488,2480.521,"--against the exclusion, total exclusion of these--"
1990.90-149,2,36385,mark_h_magidson,,2480.521,2481.459,"No, absolutely not."
1990.90-149,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2482.271,2485.373,"--Williams reads like it, but this opinion doesn't."
1990.90-149,2,36385,mark_h_magidson,,2485.373,2499.833,"--This opinion is limited, as I see it, to the particular facts of this case where the... there had been notice already and the trial court failed to exercise its discretion in getting this information."
1990.90-149,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2682.28,2685.333,You could exclude parts of his testimony on the ground that they were irrelevant.
1990.90-149,2,36385,mark_h_magidson,,2685.333,2685.914,"--Yes, you could."
1990.90-149,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2687.844,2692.168,Was there an effort made to cross-examine the victim on the same subject?
1990.90-149,2,36385,mark_h_magidson,,2692.168,2699.244,"There was... whenever the efforts were made the prosecutor, the trial prosecutor would jump up and object."
1990.90-149,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2699.943,2700.754,And it was sustained by the court?
1990.90-149,2,36385,mark_h_magidson,,2700.754,2701.275,Absolutely.
1990.90-149,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2805.573,2829.497,Do you suppose the court of appeals said that where the evidence offered is prior sexual relationship between the victim and the defendant that you never exclude the evidence based solely on the lack of notice?
1990.90-149,2,36385,mark_h_magidson,,2829.497,2833.19,--No.
1990.90-149,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2834.482,2835.964,They didn't?
1990.90-149,2,36385,mark_h_magidson,,2855.256,2856.027,Not because of notice.
1990.90-149,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2860.22,2860.641,Exactly.
1990.90-149,2,36385,mark_h_magidson,,2860.641,2861.479,Exactly.
1990.90-149,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2861.479,2863.232,And they followed Williams in that regard.
1990.90-149,2,36385,mark_h_magidson,,2863.232,2863.572,Right.
1990.90-149,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2863.572,2873.599,"So it is a per se rule that where the victim and the defendant are the ones involved, that the notice statute cannot be applied at all?"
1990.90-149,2,36385,mark_h_magidson,,2873.599,2878.263,It... I think that that's one interpretation of the court of appeals.
1990.90-149,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2899.784,2904.269,Even where the... where the evidence concerns the victim and the defendant?
1990.90-149,2,36385,mark_h_magidson,,2904.269,2911.382,"--Certainly there is a far less need to require notice, and that's what the Michigan court of appeals indicated."
1990.90-149,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2939.632,2951.78,Do you agree that there are instances in which the victim's relation with the defendant cannot be explored as to certain of the details of that relationship?
1990.90-149,2,36385,mark_h_magidson,,2955.511,2956.142,--Sure.
1990.90-149,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2958.774,2969.472,And do you agree that there are some instances when it would be of material assistance to the court to have that hearing in advance of the trial?
1990.90-149,2,36385,mark_h_magidson,,2969.472,2982.879,"I think it could, but when balancing the two I don't think that it would be that great of inconvenience to have a... it prior to trial."
1990.90-149,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2982.879,2984.501,But it would be some inconvenience?
1990.90-149,2,36385,mark_h_magidson,,2984.501,3002.802,"There would be some inconvenience, because the normal administration of justice, but there are normally, in any felony trial there is normally motions eliminating other pretrial matters taken up by a court, and frequently other types of hearings are conducted at the type of trial, walker hearing, motions to suppress."
1990.90-149,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3096.375,3097.795,"Thank you, Mr. Magidson."
1990.90-149,3,20485,don_w_atkins,,3101.206,3102.218,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1990.90-149,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3146.517,3167.421,"Mr. Atkins, Justice White asked your colleague a question about whether the last part of the opinion of the court of appeals in this case doesn't suggest that the testimony could have been excluded on the basis of its material... lack of materiality or on the balancing process, the thought being that the court of appeals suggested that the trial court might have done that."
1990.90-149,3,20485,don_w_atkins,,3167.421,3173.465,"I think, Your Honor, you could have taken another tack, and the tack is this, whether or not that evidence would have been object--"
1990.90-149,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3173.465,3178.949,"I mean, but I'm interested in your view of whether or not the Michigan court of appeals said that or held that."
1990.90-149,3,20485,don_w_atkins,,3178.949,3179.59,"--No, Your Honor."
1990.90-149,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3190.525,3191.146,"In this case, you mean?"
1990.90-149,3,20485,don_w_atkins,,3191.146,3191.836,"--Yes, Your Honor, I do believe that."
1990.90-149,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3191.836,3194.877,You mean just the fact of having... of requiring notice?
1990.90-149,3,20485,don_w_atkins,,3197.161,3209.957,"Well, the notice... I think they have said that both the notice and the pretrial hearing provision, in camera hearing provision, were both in... together... tandem, unconstitutional when applied to this situation without any further consideration."
1990.90-149,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3209.957,3215.361,"--They didn't say the notice provision was unconstitutional, only enforcing it by exclusion was unconstitutional."
1990.90-149,3,20485,don_w_atkins,,3215.361,3232.103,"I'm not so sure that that is quite how I see it either, Your Honor, but I do see it as a situation in which the notice itself cannot, in my opinion, preclude a defendant from... or deny a defendant his Sixth Amendment right of confrontation."
1990.90-149,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3273.34,3275.423,"Thank you, Mr. Atkins."
