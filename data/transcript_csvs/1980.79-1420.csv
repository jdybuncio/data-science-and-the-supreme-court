1980.79-1420,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,8.685,We will hear arguments next in Firestone Tire & Rubber Company v. Risjord.
1980.79-1420,0,27144,harvey_m_grossman,,10.716,15.354,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1980.79-1420,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,28.801,33.128,"If it wasn't appealable, then we don't ever get to the second question?"
1980.79-1420,0,27144,harvey_m_grossman,,33.128,34.284,"That's correct, Mr. Justice."
1980.79-1420,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,163.856,171.01,"Mr. Grossman, may I interrupt you for a moment to ask you a question that doesn't really go to the merits of this case at all?"
1980.79-1420,0,27144,harvey_m_grossman,,205.403,215.946,"As I understand the question, it is directed to the matter of--"
1980.79-1420,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,215.946,219.085,Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company.
1980.79-1420,0,27144,harvey_m_grossman,,219.085,220.381,"--I would say, no, Your Honor."
1980.79-1420,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,224.27,230.956,"Was or is the insurance carrier for Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company, Home?"
1980.79-1420,0,27144,harvey_m_grossman,,230.956,233.096,--I don't know.
1980.79-1420,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,238.311,239.435,"And it's not a part of this litigation, I know."
1980.79-1420,0,27144,harvey_m_grossman,,239.435,242.871,"--No, and I am not aware of who covers them."
1980.79-1420,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,249.541,252.931,Perhaps your brother will be able to answer my question.
1980.79-1420,0,27144,harvey_m_grossman,,255.149,257.678,I see no problem whatever in that regard.
1980.79-1420,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,308.97,314.327,--Why was it any concern of Firestone's?
1980.79-1420,0,27144,harvey_m_grossman,,314.327,339.426,"Because, Your Honor, Firestone viewed the matter, or had to view the matter not only in terms of whether the case might be won or lost, but also from the standpoint of insurability."
1980.79-1420,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,367.696,382.128,"Well, let's assume Firestone, for a moment, doesn't represent the public interest but just itself."
1980.79-1420,0,27144,harvey_m_grossman,,383.065,398.013,"Well, assume that... well, there are at least three ways that Firestone would suffer, we would contend."
1980.79-1420,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,430.656,440.87,"Would the options open to the plaintiffs' counsel as to insurability or not, affect recovery against Firestone?"
1980.79-1420,0,27144,harvey_m_grossman,,440.87,451.49,"As I said, they could affect the prospect that any recovery might be fashioned in such a way as to avoid coverage under the policy."
1980.79-1420,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,471.327,480.823,"Mr. Grossman, let me continue the interruption."
1980.79-1420,0,27144,harvey_m_grossman,,489.477,492.709,"That action is still pending, Mr. Justice."
1980.79-1420,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,492.709,498.676,"Is it being held for resolution of this case, or just clogged in the calendar?"
1980.79-1420,0,27144,harvey_m_grossman,,498.676,499.644,No.
1980.79-1420,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,518.355,536.27,"Your answer is basically that Firestone might have to pay a greater or lesser amount depending on how much insurability there was in its policy with Home, is that correct?"
1980.79-1420,0,27144,harvey_m_grossman,,536.27,562.01,"Our position is that Firestone is put at risk because it stands a greater chance that recovery or the prospects of recovery might more likely be guided, or I should say the recovery might more likely be fashioned in such a way as to avoid coverage under Home's policy."
1980.79-1420,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,589.093,603.525,"Mr. Grossman, suppose this lawyer had withdrawn his name and had in turn given all of his plans, all of his trial briefs, to another lawyer."
1980.79-1420,0,27144,harvey_m_grossman,,605.836,619.002,"If he imparted his matters of public to another lawyer, we would have no quarrel with that."
1980.79-1420,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,619.002,623.702,"If he handed anything he wanted to him, could you complain about it?"
1980.79-1420,0,27144,harvey_m_grossman,,623.702,632.934,"Ordinarily, I would say, not unless there was some link between the two."
1980.79-1420,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,647.35,649.817,"Well, suppose he's a new lawyer that Home had just hired?"
1980.79-1420,0,27144,harvey_m_grossman,,657.111,658.454,"Well, if Home assigned--"
1980.79-1420,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,658.454,664.873,"You're still worried about what might happen, which has not happened, and might not happen."
1980.79-1420,0,27144,harvey_m_grossman,,667.982,673.948,"--The reason we are concerned, Your Honor, is that we--"
1980.79-1420,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,673.948,674.698,You might have to pay more money.
1980.79-1420,0,27144,harvey_m_grossman,,674.698,677.681,"--Well, not just the question of paying more money."
1980.79-1420,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,680.789,687.631,"Well, are you pursuing the public interest or your own private Firestone interests?"
1980.79-1420,0,27144,harvey_m_grossman,,691.286,728.13,"--Our position, obviously, is prompted by what we perceive to be Firestone's interests, but we believe in this particular case Firestone's interest happens to coalesce with the public interest because the continued prosecution of this case in the face of the conflict of interest that Firestone's complaining of in our view would be contrary to the public interest because it injects an element of the case, that is, the consideration of Home, a division of loyalty, a lack of independent judgment, which ought not to be permitted."
1980.79-1420,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,762.257,765.662,Is Home Fire Firestone's excess insurer--
1980.79-1420,0,27144,harvey_m_grossman,,765.662,767.911,"Yes, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, it is."
1980.79-1420,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,941.246,943.527,--Is your claim abuse of discretion?
1980.79-1420,0,27144,harvey_m_grossman,,943.527,954.196,"--We don't believe any discretion was involved, Mr. Justice Marshall, because the trial court acknowledged that the conflict existed."
1980.79-1420,1,30655,john_r_gibson,,1862.222,1867.799,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1980.79-1420,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2045.46,2052.536,"We never get to any of this if we find that the order refusing to disqualify was not appealable, do we?"
1980.79-1420,1,30655,john_r_gibson,,2052.536,2056.254,"I'm sorry, I didn't get the first part of your question?"
1980.79-1420,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2056.254,2065.499,We never get to this conflict situation if we were to conclude that the order refusing to disqualify Risjord was not appealable?
1980.79-1420,1,30655,john_r_gibson,,2065.499,2065.905,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1980.79-1420,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2159.228,2163.539,"Mr. Gibson, Home is not only listed in Martindale, it's listed first."
1980.79-1420,1,30655,john_r_gibson,,2163.539,2168.365,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1980.79-1420,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2179.798,2180.25,Who wouldn't do it?
1980.79-1420,1,30655,john_r_gibson,,2181.719,2187.701,"--Martindale just simply would not alphabetize it for him, and he simply gave up after repeated requests."
1980.79-1420,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2187.701,2194.916,You mean Martindale would not adhere to his request for a change in his listing of representative clients?
1980.79-1420,1,30655,john_r_gibson,,2194.916,2200.944,"That is his testimony, that he could not get them to alphabetize it."
1980.79-1420,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2216.441,2218.861,Do you know why they made that choice?
1980.79-1420,1,30655,john_r_gibson,,2218.861,2219.627,I'm sorry?
1980.79-1420,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2219.627,2221.173,Do you know why they made that choice?
1980.79-1420,1,30655,john_r_gibson,,2221.173,2222.985,"I cannot say, Your Honor."
1980.79-1420,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2294.862,2300.687,"Well, don't all lawyers use tactical and strategic weapons in trying to beat their opponents?"
1980.79-1420,1,30655,john_r_gibson,,2300.687,2313.682,"They certainly do, but the courts have particularly pointed out that this is a particular subject of abuse, and the five circuits have... in the last month two more circuits have joined the procession."
1980.79-1420,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2411.126,2416.577,"Mr. Gibson, is Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company tangentially involved in this case?"
1980.79-1420,1,30655,john_r_gibson,,2416.577,2423.685,They are named as additional defendants in a number of the cases where that's applicable.
1980.79-1420,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2431.431,2435.633,Who is their insurance carrier?
1980.79-1420,1,30655,john_r_gibson,,2435.633,2437.257,The record is silent on that subject.
1980.79-1420,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2458.936,2460.888,"And you don't know, personally?"
1980.79-1420,1,30655,john_r_gibson,,2460.888,2461.466,"I do not know, sir."
1980.79-1420,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2461.466,2467.573,Was there a motion made in any of the Goodyear cases to disqualify Mr. Risjord?
1980.79-1420,1,30655,john_r_gibson,,2467.573,2468.511,This is the only motion to disqualify.
1980.79-1420,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2468.511,2473.29,So then Goodyear has no interest in the outcome of this case?
1980.79-1420,1,30655,john_r_gibson,,2473.29,2480.099,"Firestone who is arguing here that what's good for Firestone is good for the public, is the only person making the complaint in this disqualification matter."
1980.79-1420,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2596.147,2604.722,Is the trend the same way with respect to orders granting disqualification?
1980.79-1420,1,30655,john_r_gibson,,2604.722,2631.884,"Several of the cases, Community Broadcasting, Melamed, I think the 8th Circuit in this case, and Armstrong, all held that because the orders granting disqualification parted a client from the lawyer, and because the order granting really certified that there was merit, that there was a reason for treating them differently."
1980.79-1420,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2657.482,2659.699,"So the answer to my question is, yes?"
1980.79-1420,1,30655,john_r_gibson,,2665.197,2665.775,--Yes.
1980.79-1420,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2840.157,2852.746,"As an element necessary for certification, you would have to say that it is a probably dispositive issue in the case, don't you?"
1980.79-1420,1,30655,john_r_gibson,,2852.746,2854.682,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1980.79-1420,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2854.682,2862.336,How could you ever say that the disqualification of a lawyer was a probably dispositive issue in the case?
1980.79-1420,1,30655,john_r_gibson,,2862.336,2880.672,"Well, not... I think under 1292(b) a legal question has to be shown, but I think all of these circuits have discussed the fact that these discretionary procedures will be available where there is irreparable damage posed."
1980.79-1420,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2880.672,2883.811,"Well, how have they answered the question that I just put to you?"
1980.79-1420,1,30655,john_r_gibson,,2883.811,2885.811,"Your Honor, I don't think they do."
1980.79-1420,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2937.524,2951.582,Was there any discussion in the trial court when this question came up as to whether the judge ought to entertain this suggestion on behalf of Firestone?
1980.79-1420,1,30655,john_r_gibson,,2951.582,2956.517,--The suggestion on behalf of Firestone that it consent?
1980.79-1420,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2959.375,2966.669,"No, as to whether or not this objection ought to be heard at all?"
1980.79-1420,1,30655,john_r_gibson,,2974.322,2978.164,--This is the point that we raise so far as the merits of this case are concerned--
1980.79-1420,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2978.164,2978.664,I know you do.
1980.79-1420,1,30655,john_r_gibson,,2978.664,2982.069,--that Firestone was never a client of Risjord.
1980.79-1420,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2982.069,2982.46,Yes.
1980.79-1420,1,30655,john_r_gibson,,2982.46,2988.535,And that the disqualification motion should only have been available to a client.
1980.79-1420,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2988.535,2991.08,I understand; that's your position now.
1980.79-1420,1,30655,john_r_gibson,,2994.611,2999.376,I don't think there was discussion of it at the time the trial court considered this.
1980.79-1420,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3000.952,3005.902,The trial judge must have thought it was a suggestion that deserved ruling on?
1980.79-1420,1,30655,john_r_gibson,,3005.902,3009.12,I think we'll know--
1980.79-1420,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3009.12,3010.167,I'd like to know.
1980.79-1420,1,30655,john_r_gibson,,3010.979,3017.102,--I think we simply can't know.
1980.79-1420,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3018.804,3023.443,--I suppose the transcript would show what the discussion was?
1980.79-1420,1,30655,john_r_gibson,,3023.443,3028.535,"--That's been... that's in the record, and I think there's no discussion of that at all."
1980.79-1420,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3048.776,3055.055,"Mr. Gibson, do you happen to know, has the trial been held in abeyance pending the outcome of this appeal?"
1980.79-1420,1,30655,john_r_gibson,,3055.055,3058.741,"The trial has not been held in abeyance, and I understand discovery has proceeded on."
1980.79-1420,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3069.862,3080.312,"Some trial courts view an appeal under 1291 as requiring that the trial proceedings stop, whereas an appeal under 1292(b) permits the trial proceedings to go on."
1980.79-1420,1,30655,john_r_gibson,,3082.513,3090.276,--In this case discovery activities have proceeded on and I think they are still a ways away from the trial of the first case.
1980.79-1420,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3129.714,3142.208,"Well, this is a troublesome point for me because in both the recent 2nd Circuit case here and the 8th Circuit here they first hold the order as nonappealable, and then they go ahead and decide it."
1980.79-1420,1,30655,john_r_gibson,,3142.208,3159.842,"I think as a matter of procedure in those circuits, these orders had been appealable and they were ruling that from this point on they would not be appealable, so that the lawyers would know what the rule is going to be, and they went ahead to pass on the merits, because the change was made in these cases."
1980.79-1420,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3165.215,3171.696,"Well, Judge Lay certainly spelled it out specifically, that it was prospective and not applicable to this case."
1980.79-1420,1,30655,john_r_gibson,,3171.696,3172.165,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1980.79-1420,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3172.165,3174.836,"That he had to, in order to rule."
1980.79-1420,1,30655,john_r_gibson,,3174.836,3175.664,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1980.79-1420,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3272.765,3277.06,"Of course, Mr. Risjord was a member of the Missouri Bar."
1980.79-1420,1,30655,john_r_gibson,,3277.06,3277.856,Yes.
1980.79-1420,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3277.856,3281.527,"If he were not, suppose he were a visiting lawyer, what you have just said would be rather inapplicable, wouldn't it?"
1980.79-1420,1,30655,john_r_gibson,,3281.527,3297.006,"Well, of course, I think, under the new rules, the new Uniform Rules of Attorney Conduct, the district court would have the means at its disposal to take care of the problem."
1980.79-1420,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3306.533,3307.547,Who is the district judge here?
1980.79-1420,1,30655,john_r_gibson,,3308.25,3308.891,Judge Collinson.
1980.79-1420,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3510.39,3511.343,"Thank you, gentlemen."
