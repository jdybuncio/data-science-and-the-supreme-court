2004.03-9659,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,0.0,6.224,We'll hear argument now in the case of Miller-El against Dretke.
2004.03-9659,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,32.811,41.782,"Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court:"
2004.03-9659,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,85.163,95.91,Do we have to find that the strike of at least one African American prospective juror was race-based for you to prevail?
2004.03-9659,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,95.91,97.041,I believe so.
2004.03-9659,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,133.495,142.369,"Were there any... were there any State decisions, or Federal court decisions for that matter, justifying the shuffle on the grounds of... I don't know... professional class versus working class or something like that?"
2004.03-9659,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,142.369,171.575,"The State has in its brief in this case, on this trip to the Court... the State has cited the Court to one other case in which the Court of Criminal Appeals acknowledged the State's justification in that case, that it shuffled because there was a member of the probation office in the front row that they didn't want to embarrass and that jurors in the front had tended more to have ties than jurors in the back."
2004.03-9659,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,176.967,183.661,Were there... were there any State court cases said that... or even in that case you're referring to... that the shuffle usually is race-based?
2004.03-9659,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,183.661,188.311,"--You know, I can't... the case is called Ladd v. State."
2004.03-9659,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,292.601,301.369,"And the... and the Fifth Circuit's answer to the jury shuffle was, well, the defense shuffled more times, as I--"
2004.03-9659,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,301.369,301.663,--The Fifth--
2004.03-9659,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,301.663,302.745,--as I recall.
2004.03-9659,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,302.745,308.98,--The... the Fifth Circuit said that we... that they shuffled twice and we shuffled five times.
2004.03-9659,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,375.071,384.196,"If... if we find or if there is a finding that the... that the attempted shuffle on this fifth try was race-based, does that win your case, even though the shuffle didn't take place?"
2004.03-9659,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,384.196,388.319,"--Well, it was the--"
2004.03-9659,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,388.319,390.762,"I mean, does it show the necessary animus so that it carries through the whole case?"
2004.03-9659,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,390.762,410.784,"--I think, if I needed to... I mean, we... we've argued that the shuffle, just like the race coding of the cards in the pre-Batson era, the disparate questioning on minimum punishment and the graphic script, all reinforce what we think the record shows with respect to each of the six peremptory strikes that we challenge--"
2004.03-9659,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,471.568,478.416,"Mr. Waxman, we really have to examine your... you know, your allegations, I suppose, one at a time."
2004.03-9659,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,513.866,514.938,I think that's wrong.
2004.03-9659,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,525.925,528.085,Was it brought to the attention of the court?
2004.03-9659,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,528.085,529.76,I... I am not sure.
2004.03-9659,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,543.84,544.939,"Oh, my."
2004.03-9659,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,564.657,568.188,Even... I understand your argument.
2004.03-9659,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,585.01,587.837,Were... were both of the cases cases of the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals?
2004.03-9659,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,587.837,588.061,"Yes, yes."
2004.03-9659,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,588.061,589.634,Decided by the court... the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals.
2004.03-9659,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,589.634,589.81,Yes.
2004.03-9659,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,592.573,594.712,"Well, now, Nelson... there's Macaluso?"
2004.03-9659,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,594.712,595.96,--Macaluso.
2004.03-9659,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,595.96,596.92,Macaluso and Nelson.
2004.03-9659,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,602.089,602.627,He certainly was.
2004.03-9659,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,602.627,606.766,--I thought he came in after... after the jury had been selected.
2004.03-9659,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,606.766,606.969,No.
2004.03-9659,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,682.683,682.859,"I mean, that's the problem."
2004.03-9659,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,684.838,685.798,"--Well, I--"
2004.03-9659,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,685.798,692.022,"And... and I'm... you know, I don't remember the names of people involved in... in prior cases in this Court."
2004.03-9659,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,694.278,695.1,--Justice--
2004.03-9659,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,695.1,699.105,"--you had this same officer before you, my goodness, I... I wouldn't remember it."
2004.03-9659,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,699.105,727.116,"--Justice Scalia, a... first of all, these... each of these cases was tried within months of Mr. Miller-El's case, and a finding by a... the State's highest court that a prosecutor has engaged in intentional, deliberate, race discrimination in the selection of a jury I respectfully submit... I certainly hope is not the kind of everyday finding that is easily forgotten."
2004.03-9659,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,781.858,782.253,May I--
2004.03-9659,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,782.253,784.573,--and with respect to the graphic script.
2004.03-9659,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,784.573,786.691,--May I ask on the minimum punishment ploy?
2004.03-9659,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,797.011,798.665,"Well, I can't speak to other cases."
2004.03-9659,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,840.527,841.925,Their response--
2004.03-9659,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,841.925,843.829,But you... you haven't really answered my question yet.
2004.03-9659,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,843.829,844.651,"Oh, I'm sorry."
2004.03-9659,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,844.651,855.397,"Does any... did any Texas trial judge, to your knowledge, ever fall for this ploy, ever grant a... a challenge for cause based on answers to the minimum punishment harangue?"
2004.03-9659,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,855.397,860.757,"I... I would defer to Ms. Bunn about that because I don't know about other cases, but--"
2004.03-9659,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,860.757,861.6,I didn't see any in this case.
2004.03-9659,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,861.6,866.389,"--Well, what happened in this case was there was an effort to rehabilitate."
2004.03-9659,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,882.005,912.496,"--The respondent's reply to this... this minimal punishment argument is that in fact the... the two white prospective jurors who had... who had expressed antagonism towards the death penalty were subjected to the same questioning, and that the seven out of eight black prospective were seven who had expressed antagonism to the death penalty."
2004.03-9659,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,913.472,926.139,"I think that if I... I believe that with respect to minimum punishment, as opposed to the graphic script, what the State is saying is last time we said there were 10 whites and 10 blacks who expressed hesitation."
2004.03-9659,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,982.939,994.449,"Well, we have to go through each one of them and see if the degree of hostility expressed by the white jurors was the same as the degree of hostility expressed by the black jurors."
2004.03-9659,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,998.699,999.755,Well--
2004.03-9659,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,999.755,1001.179,One said I really don't believe in it.
2004.03-9659,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1012.033,1014.001,--I--
2004.03-9659,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1014.001,1027.259,"Now, if... if there happens to be a different attitude towards the death penalty among the black jurors than there is among the white jurors, you cannot fault the... the attorneys for... for striking more of the black jurors."
2004.03-9659,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1027.259,1073.531,"--Justice Scalia, in the context of all of this other evidence, which is the context in which you need to weigh it and determine whether we have satisfied the stringent standard for review that applies, I respectfully submit that if you go through the... the voir dire questioning of Mr. Fields and Mr. Warren and Mr. Rand and the others that we've mentioned, and compare it, even leaving aside all of the other evidence, contemporaneous evidence, of race discrimination in the jury selection in this case, I think you will have to come to the conclusion that race was a but-for factor in these cases."
2004.03-9659,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1149.383,1149.591,"Well, now, wait."
2004.03-9659,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1158.455,1160.017,--He said--
2004.03-9659,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1160.017,1161.996,Do you think that's a strong--
2004.03-9659,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1161.996,1212.103,"--I'm... I'm not sure whether that's Rand or Warren, but I'm saying that if you compare Mr. Rand who thought that the death penalty might be applicable for all murder, who repeatedly... in our reply brief, we include the... the recitation... repeatedly said over and over and over and over again that he would answer the three questions yes, depending on the evidence, without any regard for his view about the death penalty, who testified that... I'm not saying that this is somebody whom, if this were a case in which there was nothing in this... we were just before this Court saying there's Rand and Mazza or there's Rand and Hearn and that's enough to satisfy our burden, I would be up here arguing it but it would be a much more difficult argument."
2004.03-9659,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1231.005,1232.125,"Well, that's the question."
2004.03-9659,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1232.125,1238.029,"--We have to deal with each of the six one by one, and... and they have arguments with respect to each of them."
2004.03-9659,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1246.483,1247.581,"--Well, I--"
2004.03-9659,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1247.581,1252.909,"--that doesn't strike me... and that... that's what respondent says Rand said, not... not one of the other ones."
2004.03-9659,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1256.835,1258.659,--And if this--
2004.03-9659,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1258.659,1266.755,"I mean, and... and, you know, a buckshot attack on it has to be examined pellet by pellet."
2004.03-9659,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1266.755,1270.099,--Justice... let me... let me switch your metaphor a little.
2004.03-9659,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1313.679,1321.125,Suppose that you have 10 white jurors and 10 black jurors.
2004.03-9659,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1335.018,1337.855,All in and of itself?
2004.03-9659,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1341.013,1344.725,So... so then you admit that you have to go one by one.
2004.03-9659,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1361.941,1362.096,"--No, I would give--"
2004.03-9659,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1362.096,1362.411,--for excusing them.
2004.03-9659,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1362.411,1370.859,"--I would give you a different answer, Justice Kennedy, if it's the jury shuffle because there's no plausible explanation available on the evidence in this case."
2004.03-9659,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1401.787,1422.619,"Mr. Waxman, you were dealing with Fields, and the answer in Fields' case that the prosecution gives is he had a strong feeling about rehabilitation, and so he was... he thought that everyone could rehabilitated... rehabilitated."
2004.03-9659,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1432.165,1433.984,"Yes, Justice... Justice Ginsburg."
2004.03-9659,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1534.0,1543.275,Was there any evidence that the jury cards in this... in the actual trial were marked or noted on the basis of race?
2004.03-9659,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1543.275,1545.142,"--Oh, absolutely."
2004.03-9659,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1545.142,1546.95,Where do we find that evidence?
2004.03-9659,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1546.95,1563.532,"The... the juror cards are in the joint lodging beginning on page 82, and every single card lists the gender and race, even the cards as to jurors that they never questioned."
2004.03-9659,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1611.249,1613.884,"All of those things are okay, right, except the race one."
2004.03-9659,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1613.884,1616.018,"--Well, I--"
2004.03-9659,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1616.018,1617.335,"I mean, maybe their right about beards and mustaches."
2004.03-9659,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1617.335,1617.548,--We know that--
2004.03-9659,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1617.548,1618.092,I don't know.
2004.03-9659,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1621.773,1627.522,"--I... we're not here... if this were gender or race, this Court has said that can't be the but-for reason."
2004.03-9659,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1634.317,1634.456,"Yes, by all means."
2004.03-9659,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1634.456,1635.043,Thank you.
2004.03-9659,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1635.043,1636.68,Ms. Bunn.
2004.03-9659,1,25031,gena_a_bunn,,1636.68,1641.464,"Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court:"
2004.03-9659,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1674.18,1689.332,Would... would the statement that you gave... let's assume there was a... a working premise that blacks were more... were less inclined to impose the death penalty.
2004.03-9659,1,25031,gena_a_bunn,,1694.217,1696.286,"--No, Your Honor, it would not."
2004.03-9659,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1733.519,1736.527,"Now... now, as I understand it, this case was here before."
2004.03-9659,1,25031,gena_a_bunn,,1859.638,1866.961,"--Your Honor, the first time before this Court, the issue was whether, based on a threshold examination of the record--"
2004.03-9659,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1866.961,1872.609,"I know that was the issue, but I'm saying if I read the opinion to say... now, maybe you'll tell me I shouldn't."
2004.03-9659,1,25031,gena_a_bunn,,1895.132,1919.67,"--Your Honor, I believe the most... the most important difference in the review of this Court the last time and the review of this... of the Court this time is that the Court did take a big-picture look at all of the pieces of evidence, but at this point, as the court of appeals did and as this... as this Court must do now, it must go, as Justice Scalia mentioned, juror by juror, the jurors who were challenged."
2004.03-9659,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1920.668,1922.438,"We only speak to the issues before us, don't we?"
2004.03-9659,1,25031,gena_a_bunn,,1934.545,1935.409,--That is correct.
2004.03-9659,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1935.409,1935.713,Right.
2004.03-9659,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1936.183,1936.828,And that's a good deal different.
2004.03-9659,1,25031,gena_a_bunn,,1943.234,1944.328,"No, Your Honor."
2004.03-9659,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1944.328,1945.123,I hate to say this--
2004.03-9659,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1945.123,1945.912,So that must be a different question--
2004.03-9659,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1945.912,1947.971,"--to my colleagues, but I'm very much interested in hearing what Ms. Bunn has to say."
2004.03-9659,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1947.971,1948.147,--because that wasn't the one I asked.
2004.03-9659,1,25031,gena_a_bunn,,1969.006,1980.958,"Yes, Your Honor, there was additional analysis, particularly of the six jurors Miller-El claims were discriminated against, which this Court did not review the first... in its first opinion specifically."
2004.03-9659,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2028.895,2029.178,May I ask you this?
2004.03-9659,1,25031,gena_a_bunn,,2042.362,2050.09,"Your Honor, there are other cases that I'm aware of in Texas where the State did challenge jurors on this basis."
2004.03-9659,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2055.914,2056.928,But have... and the challenges were granted?
2004.03-9659,1,25031,gena_a_bunn,,2056.928,2058.036,"Yes, Your Honor."
2004.03-9659,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2058.036,2059.69,"Of course, none of them were granted in this case."
2004.03-9659,1,25031,gena_a_bunn,,2060.362,2060.906,That's correct.
2004.03-9659,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2060.906,2069.792,So it... it was true that this was... was a ploy adopted for the purpose of trying to make it unnecessary to use a... a peremptory challenge.
2004.03-9659,1,25031,gena_a_bunn,,2069.792,2070.889,"Yes, Your Honor."
2004.03-9659,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2072.208,2073.232,And do you defend that practice?
2004.03-9659,1,25031,gena_a_bunn,,2073.232,2087.514,"Yes, if it is a legitimate tactic, recognized... as an attorney, if there is a... some means that is available to use so that you do not have to use a peremptory strike--"
2004.03-9659,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2087.514,2093.545,"If you... if you can get the venire person to make a mistake in his answer, then you... you get... get him off easy."
2004.03-9659,1,25031,gena_a_bunn,,2093.545,2097.744,"--That's what... that's what voir dire is all about, and the defense counsel did it in many occasions--"
2004.03-9659,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2097.744,2108.875,And suppose... suppose you have a system in which that attempt to find cause is applied much more rigorously to black prospective jurors than to white prospective jurors.
2004.03-9659,1,25031,gena_a_bunn,,2108.875,2115.686,"--If it's not... the record shows that there's no difference in the views expressed by the jurors, yes."
2004.03-9659,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2117.537,2117.665,No.
2004.03-9659,1,25031,gena_a_bunn,,2137.958,2140.252,"--No, Your Honor, not a Batson violation."
2004.03-9659,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2143.377,2158.849,So... so you say that in any case you can question black jurors more intensively than white jurors and still succeed in excusing them if the result of that voir dire shows some race-neutral basis.
2004.03-9659,1,25031,gena_a_bunn,,2158.849,2168.577,"--Your Honor, if the questioning itself results in the views that are the basis of the strike, that would present a problem."
2004.03-9659,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2180.924,2188.647,Suppose... suppose you have a manual of... from the district attorney's office that says all black jurors shall be questioned more intensively than white jurors.
2004.03-9659,1,25031,gena_a_bunn,,2188.647,2195.394,That would certainly be evidence that black jurors and white jurors were treated differently.
2004.03-9659,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2195.394,2197.608,You're saying that that is not what happened here.
2004.03-9659,1,25031,gena_a_bunn,,2197.608,2198.328,Yes.
2004.03-9659,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2198.328,2213.869,"It was on the basis of the questionnaires expressing hostility to the death penalty that more intensive questioning was given to some people than to others, and that the mere fact that a larger number of those people was black is not a violation."
2004.03-9659,1,25031,gena_a_bunn,,2213.869,2215.55,"Yes, Your Honor, that is correct."
2004.03-9659,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2215.55,2228.227,"So the hypothetical, assuming that you... you just have blacks and whites with no difference in... in what they... in what they had said on the questionnaire, is a hypothetical that you say does not exist in this case."
2004.03-9659,1,25031,gena_a_bunn,,2228.227,2228.755,Yes.
2004.03-9659,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2228.755,2234.606,"Yes, but you don't know what the questionnaire showed as to most of the white venire persons, do you?"
2004.03-9659,1,25031,gena_a_bunn,,2234.606,2236.136,"No, we don't, Your Honor."
2004.03-9659,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2236.136,2238.36,And how many white venire persons were there?
2004.03-9659,1,25031,gena_a_bunn,,2238.36,2240.227,48.
2004.03-9659,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2240.227,2240.808,48.
2004.03-9659,1,25031,gena_a_bunn,,2243.128,2244.531,On the graphic script?
2004.03-9659,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2244.531,2244.846,Yes.
2004.03-9659,1,25031,gena_a_bunn,,2244.846,2246.324,Two... three.
2004.03-9659,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2246.324,2254.75,And so are we to assume that all 46 of the other white venire persons were as tough on the death penalty as you'd like everybody to be?
2004.03-9659,1,25031,gena_a_bunn,,2254.75,2256.292,"No, Your Honor."
2004.03-9659,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2256.292,2259.23,"We just don't know about those other 46, do we?"
2004.03-9659,1,25031,gena_a_bunn,,2259.23,2259.908,We do not know.
2004.03-9659,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2260.495,2264.788,But is it not a reasonable inference that some of them might have expressed doubt about the death penalty?
2004.03-9659,1,25031,gena_a_bunn,,2264.788,2267.071,--That is... we do not know.
2004.03-9659,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2269.44,2272.368,"Well, if you don't know... if you don't know, you... there's an excellent way to know."
2004.03-9659,1,25031,gena_a_bunn,,2309.093,2311.621,"--Yes, Your Honor, I would."
2004.03-9659,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2311.621,2313.28,And did the prosecutor ever do that here?
2004.03-9659,1,25031,gena_a_bunn,,2313.28,2321.563,"No, but significantly in this case, the arguments regarding disparate questioning were never raised until Federal habeas corpus proceedings."
2004.03-9659,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2325.057,2326.294,Did the prosecutor not... was he there?
2004.03-9659,1,25031,gena_a_bunn,,2326.294,2327.462,"No, Your Honor."
2004.03-9659,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2328.14,2328.422,No.
2004.03-9659,1,25031,gena_a_bunn,,2330.63,2334.636,"--The prosecutors were contacted during that period, but the questionnaires--"
2004.03-9659,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2334.636,2334.786,All right.
2004.03-9659,1,25031,gena_a_bunn,,2334.924,2337.159,--no longer existed at that point.
2004.03-9659,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2337.159,2339.261,--But couldn't you have asked the prosecutors if that was the reason?
2004.03-9659,1,25031,gena_a_bunn,,2339.261,2344.84,20... 15 years after a case is tried--
2004.03-9659,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2344.84,2345.949,"I mean, what are we supposed to do?"
2004.03-9659,1,25031,gena_a_bunn,,2353.608,2358.781,"--Well, Your Honor, in this case, the... the inmate Miller-El has the burden."
2004.03-9659,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2370.723,2384.451,"Well, on... on that point, this is not exactly like McDonnell Douglas, Burdine where you have some prima facie case, the person was equally qualified, but was of a different gender than the one that got the job, and then the... you go back to square one."
2004.03-9659,1,25031,gena_a_bunn,,2395.091,2407.395,"--Your Honor, this evidence, however compelling a picture it draws of past injustice, simply cannot trump the State court's finding of no purposeful discrimination."
2004.03-9659,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2409.273,2417.945,"Well, don't we at some point have to have some reason to believe that the evidence of past practices become irrelevant?"
2004.03-9659,1,25031,gena_a_bunn,,2422.457,2437.828,"--There... there was evidence in the Swain hearing, and that... in fact, the cross examination by the prosecutors did indicate that practices that were in the past had been... had been vitiated, at least closer to the time of trial."
2004.03-9659,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2440.292,2451.774,"These are the same two prosecutors who in other cases had been found, in effect, guilty of... of racial discrimination and the same two prosecutors who were calling for the shuffle in these cases."
2004.03-9659,1,25031,gena_a_bunn,,2455.321,2464.095,"--Even assuming the evidence, the historical evidence... assuming its relevance, as the Fifth Circuit did--"
2004.03-9659,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2464.095,2477.38,"Well, I mean, I... I am assuming it is relevant, and I am asking the question, is there a reasonable basis to think that these particular individuals, engaging in the practice that they demonstrably engaged in, had had a change in heart in this case?"
2004.03-9659,1,25031,gena_a_bunn,,2477.38,2478.527,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2004.03-9659,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2493.098,2495.743,Is that why they engaged in the shuffle twice--
2004.03-9659,1,25031,gena_a_bunn,,2495.743,2497.589,Your Honor--
2004.03-9659,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2497.589,2501.962,--on... on a record that shows there were black jurors down front each time they engaged in it?
2004.03-9659,1,25031,gena_a_bunn,,2501.962,2507.77,"--The record shows that of 5 weeks of voir dire, the State requested shuffles three times."
2004.03-9659,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2515.93,2517.653,And... and that evidence was not refuted.
2004.03-9659,1,25031,gena_a_bunn,,2520.01,2523.242,"--Your Honor, there was no response from the prosecutors."
2004.03-9659,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2549.509,2552.394,The... I... I don't think that's his argument at all.
2004.03-9659,1,25031,gena_a_bunn,,2606.544,2621.109,"Your Honor, again, Miller-El's claim of purposeful discrimination must focus on these six jurors, and in answer to your question, a review of these six jurors does show that these strikes were not based on race."
2004.03-9659,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2622.048,2624.454,"--You think they're based, for example, on capital punishment."
2004.03-9659,1,25031,gena_a_bunn,,2691.932,2697.9,"--Your Honor, the... that was not the prosecutor's argument at trial and it's... it is not our position now that--"
2004.03-9659,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2697.9,2698.076,No.
2004.03-9659,1,25031,gena_a_bunn,,2767.513,2783.001,"--Your Honor, as to Juror Billy Jean Fields, he did not express qualms about the death penalty in general, but he did state that it was his belief that no one... no one... no matter their background or what they've done, is beyond rehabilitation."
2004.03-9659,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2853.392,2859.477,"Ms. Bunn, before you finish, there... there are two pieces of this I hope you can give me an answer to."
2004.03-9659,1,25031,gena_a_bunn,,2869.301,2872.208,--I... I don't... I don't have any information.
2004.03-9659,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2889.083,2897.92,Is it not a fair inference that each of the cues noted on the cards was something that the prosecutors thought relevant to whether or not to challenge the juror?
2004.03-9659,1,25031,gena_a_bunn,,2909.12,2911.221,--Not necessarily.
2004.03-9659,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2913.153,2913.723,"Well, why else would it be noted?"
2004.03-9659,1,25031,gena_a_bunn,,2913.723,2918.945,--There was... just to familiarize an attorney getting ready for voir dire of an extensive number of people--
2004.03-9659,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2918.945,2919.516,Is... is there any--
2004.03-9659,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2919.516,2924.263,Maybe the prosecutors didn't want to come up with an all-white jury for fear it would be challenged.
2004.03-9659,1,25031,gena_a_bunn,,2924.263,2925.81,--That's certainly--
2004.03-9659,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2925.81,2939.149,"That may be, but is it not... is it not clear that this is one of the factors that was used to decide whether or not to exercise a challenge, just as the beard and the other things that are mentioned in the... in the manual were?"
2004.03-9659,1,25031,gena_a_bunn,,2939.149,2940.669,"--No, Your Honor."
2004.03-9659,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2952.53,2958.562,"--Well, were the... were the cues on the card similar to the instructions in the manual?"
2004.03-9659,1,25031,gena_a_bunn,,2958.562,2964.526,"There were some that could... that would correlate, but there were others that aren't noted on the juror cards--"
2004.03-9659,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2964.526,2967.15,Can you quantify the correlation or lack of correlation for me?
2004.03-9659,1,25031,gena_a_bunn,,2967.15,2975.88,"--The... for instance, occupations were... or addresses... perhaps not occupations, but I know addresses were... were noted."
2004.03-9659,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2985.364,2988.841,I had asked you if they were still race and gender-coded.
2004.03-9659,1,25031,gena_a_bunn,,3007.374,3009.166,I do not know.
2004.03-9659,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3010.772,3026.057,"The other question I had, are these two prosecutors the same ones who were involved in other cases where it was determined that they had used tactics that violated Batson?"
2004.03-9659,1,25031,gena_a_bunn,,3035.23,3050.377,"--The record indicates that Prosecutor Macaluso was involved in jury selection in the Chambers case, and that case was tried months... I believe it was late 1985 when Chambers was tried."
2004.03-9659,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3050.377,3051.204,Wasn't that 2 months?
2004.03-9659,1,25031,gena_a_bunn,,3051.204,3053.481,2 months?
2004.03-9659,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3060.921,3065.113,Is it... is it unlawful to take sex into account in jury selection?
2004.03-9659,1,25031,gena_a_bunn,,3065.113,3065.988,Yes.
2004.03-9659,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3102.729,3107.316,Is... is that true with respect to weight and mustaches and things like that?
2004.03-9659,1,25031,gena_a_bunn,,3107.316,3110.17,--That... that doesn't--
2004.03-9659,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3110.17,3115.38,"They were... they were making notations of things like that, as I understand it, and they didn't have to worry about Batson there."
2004.03-9659,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3118.271,3120.532,And Batson hadn't been decided yet.
2004.03-9659,1,25031,gena_a_bunn,,3120.532,3121.647,"--Yes, that's true."
2004.03-9659,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3146.122,3147.781,"But I... I don't... I mean, I'd just like to go back to my question."
2004.03-9659,1,25031,gena_a_bunn,,3183.088,3193.936,"--Your Honor, the... the notations, though, correlate as well to simply visual cues that a litigant will use just simply to familiarize himself with the manual."
2004.03-9659,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3193.936,3198.171,The manual had said there are certain visual cues that indicate jurors you don't want on the jury.
2004.03-9659,1,25031,gena_a_bunn,,3211.638,3219.846,"Your Honor, there are other explainable reasons, there are other plausible reasons for noting those things."
2004.03-9659,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3233.675,3242.182,What about the Fifth Circuit said that comparing Rand's testimony... that that was in line with Mazza's.
2004.03-9659,1,25031,gena_a_bunn,,3249.104,3256.864,"Justice Ginsburg, they recognized, as Justice Scalia had in his concurring opinion, that that was basically as close as it got."
2004.03-9659,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3428.059,3430.624,"Thank you, Ms.... Ms. Bunn."
2004.03-9659,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3435.851,3436.934,I have just three points.
2004.03-9659,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3574.982,3577.398,The case is submitted.
