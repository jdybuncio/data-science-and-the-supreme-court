1964.7,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,32.45,"Number 7, National Labor Relations Board, Petitioner, versus John Brown, et al."
1964.7,0,37058,norton_j_come,,34.098,39.297,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1964.7,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,263.395,265.076,"So far, this is like Buffalo Linen?"
1964.7,0,37058,norton_j_come,,265.076,268.736,"So far, this is like Buffalo Linen."
1964.7,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,306.289,324.312,"I know you used the word “replacement” also in the brief, but do I understand that those folks who were hired were told that they were employed only for the duration of the strike and that the strikers will be reemployed when the strike ended?"
1964.7,0,37058,norton_j_come,,324.312,326.338,"Yes, Your Honor I --"
1964.7,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,326.338,327.555,You know my question is --
1964.7,0,37058,norton_j_come,,327.555,328.242,"Yes, Your Honor."
1964.7,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,328.242,330.805,-- on that set of facts.
1964.7,0,37058,norton_j_come,,339.407,348.388,"Well, I prefer with the adjective temporary replacements and I -- by the use of the word “temporary” as I've --"
1964.7,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,348.388,351.375,"Does that have any significance incidentally, do you think?"
1964.7,0,37058,norton_j_come,,357.046,378.047,"In the Board's view, that does not that although temporaries are less horrendous than permanents, still the use of temporaries in these circumstances would not be justified."
1964.7,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,378.047,398.007,"Well, Mr. Come, when Food Jet reopened if whatever follows -- with some replacement was temporary or permanent -- did it opened that full blast -- was it trying to also run at store with some of its other employee -- it didn't replace everyone, did it?"
1964.7,0,37058,norton_j_come,,398.007,417.012,"As nearly as the record shows, Your Honor, well, it hired a fair complement of temporaries; I don't think that the record shows that exactly how -- how full it was."
1964.7,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,428.128,432.984,"Well, this does have something to do with the question, doesn't it?"
1964.7,0,37058,norton_j_come,,432.984,446.341,"Well, under the right -- under the Mackay decision, Food Jet being a struck employer had a right to try to operate during the strike."
1964.7,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,446.341,456.746,"Yes, but the extent to which it actually operated during the strike has got something to do with what the other employers were committed to do, doesn't it or not?"
1964.7,0,37058,norton_j_come,,459.535,468.142,"Well, it does not to the extent of permitting them to substitute for the regular employees."
1964.7,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,493.643,495.045,Even temporary employee?
1964.7,0,37058,norton_j_come,,495.045,496.137,Even temporaries.
1964.7,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,496.137,497.856,"And in this instance, since they were temporary (Voice Overlap) --"
1964.7,0,37058,norton_j_come,,497.856,509.327,They were -- they were temporary as I was going to get to the nonstruck employers when Food Jet resumed operations likewise resumed operations.
1964.7,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,557.196,603.904,(Inaudible)
1964.7,0,37058,norton_j_come,,603.904,612.47,I think so but I would like to get to Buffalo Linen and what we understand to be the rationale behind it before I -- if I may come back to your question Mr. Justice Goldberg.
1964.7,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,744.747,765.422,The fact is not there on the principle but there is this difference isn't it with temporary employee that has simply less of an impact upon the striking or lockout employees and their future then did superseniority in the Erie Resistor --
1964.7,0,37058,norton_j_come,,765.422,771.371,There is no question that it had less of an impact in superseniority but let me --
1964.7,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,771.371,780.55,I thought you'd answer me that nevertheless we've already indicated that the Board has a really wide latitude to draw -- strike these balances and that the (Voice Overlap) --
1964.7,0,37058,norton_j_come,,780.55,781.337,The question is whether that (Voice Overlap) --
1964.7,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,781.337,783.17,(Voice Overlap) -- that not much of a distinction between.
1964.7,0,37058,norton_j_come,,783.17,800.197,"Well, the question is whether the Board could reasonably say that this was more a step beyond what you need to defend the integrity of the multiemployer unit which was sanction in Buffalo Linen which I am now going to get to."
1964.7,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,800.197,811.074,"I suppose on the same basis though you would argue, you'd say that on this fact, Food Jet is going to stay open and the other respondents couldn't hold down at all."
1964.7,0,37058,norton_j_come,,811.074,819.107,"No, I'm not going to say that Your Honor."
1964.7,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,821.202,827.381,You mean that -- you mean to say that Food Jet staying open isn't enough to get out of Buffalo Linen?
1964.7,0,37058,norton_j_come,,827.381,828.034,No.
1964.7,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,880.794,884.92,This is not what (Inaudible) case is closed.
1964.7,0,37058,norton_j_come,,891.508,891.844,That --
1964.7,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,891.844,893.068,-- (Inaudible)
1964.7,0,37058,norton_j_come,,893.068,893.544,That is correct.
1964.7,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,893.544,908.014,Perhaps the fundamental reason (Inaudible) that the other employer (Inaudible)?
1964.7,0,37058,norton_j_come,,908.014,928.761,"Well, I suppose that reasonably, you could balance this in such a way as to conclude that as soon as the -- as Food Jet resumed operations, the other employers had to reopen."
1964.7,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,952.769,962.869,"Well, of course you will have to base it with the Food Jet operator solely with the supervisor employee, solely the supervisor standard, then the other employers (Inaudible)?"
1964.7,0,37058,norton_j_come,,962.869,966.106,"Well, the point is this Your Honor."
1964.7,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1110.037,1127.641,"I guess it is wholly irrelevant from the -- what is the availability of the other employee, the employees (Inaudible) is wholly irrelevant if you operate the -- namely the integrity of the multiemployer bargaining unit?"
1964.7,0,37058,norton_j_come,,1127.641,1162.87,"Well, if you start with the premise that Buffalo Linen privileges majors that are necessary to defend the unit against the effect of a whipsaw strike and since you are balancing, you privilege no more than it is necessary under the circumstances and it seems to me that it is not wholly irrelevant Your Honor for this reason."
1964.7,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1258.251,1265.081,How long can they protect the bargaining unit if the whipsaw continued with the Board's theory was given?
1964.7,0,37058,norton_j_come,,1265.081,1276.523,They can protect the bargaining unit Your Honor by resuming operations with their regular employees on a reduced basis.
1964.7,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1276.523,1293.021,(Inaudible)
1964.7,0,37058,norton_j_come,,1293.021,1296.935,"Well, it only has -- it only has some of its members working."
1964.7,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1296.935,1297.69,(Inaudible)
1964.7,0,37058,norton_j_come,,1297.69,1304.327,"Now, granted that there are different ways of drawing the accommodation here."
1964.7,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1314.738,1333.217,How do I expect (Inaudible) the rationality of the economic (Inaudible) are not documented as the Erie.
1964.7,0,37058,norton_j_come,,1337.855,1340.304,"Yes, Your Honor."
1964.7,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1386.298,1388.659,Without the interrogation of insurance agents?
1964.7,0,37058,norton_j_come,,1388.659,1390.13,"No, Your Honor."
1964.7,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1395.052,1396.347,But if they still (Voice Overlap)
1964.7,0,37058,norton_j_come,,1396.347,1399.615,"Yes, yes but I was going to answer it though."
1964.7,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1399.615,1401.494,Yes.
1964.7,0,37058,norton_j_come,,1401.494,1420.391,"We believe, that in Insurance Agents, the question was whether or not the Board had the power to set in judgment on economic weapons in assessing the question as to whether or not it was a failure to bargain in good faith."
1964.7,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1455.445,1456.385,Under 8 (a) (1)?
1964.7,0,37058,norton_j_come,,1456.385,1457.681,Under 8 (a) (1).
1964.7,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1470.29,1471.245,"Well, I gather --"
1964.7,0,37058,norton_j_come,,1471.245,1471.337,Yes.
1964.7,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1471.337,1489.751,"-- do I understand then that the Board thinks that Buffalo Linen still fit the law in the sense -- I mean, from their stand point that at the same it came up again, they would resolve the way they did, make the judgment and the balance the way they did in Buffalo Linen?"
1964.7,0,37058,norton_j_come,,1489.751,1491.533,Yes Your Honor.
1964.7,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1491.858,1516.94,"Or if you didn't, I would suppose before you would be here arguing if for example we have Buffalo Linen on its precise facts and the Board struck the balance differently today and even at that time, I suppose you'd be here arguing I know but that's within what the Court has recognized to be the Board power to accommodate these problems and again, subject only limited review would be required to sustain that."
1964.7,0,37058,norton_j_come,,1516.94,1517.457,"Well, as you --"
1964.7,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1517.457,1520.185,They expect us to do at least.
1964.7,0,37058,norton_j_come,,1520.185,1520.69,I'm happy.
1964.7,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1524.099,1527.614,(Voice Overlap) maybe you do.
1964.7,0,37058,norton_j_come,,1527.614,1539.226,"Well, we have -- for the reason that I've indicated, I've tried to point out that the situation here is different, factually different."
1964.7,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1662.897,1681.183,"Presume, I'd say, the Board's order doesn't need -- their opinion doesn't leave any room of the -- the way I read it, the contention that you now make that other respondents may partially close down to key their operations to those of the struck employer."
1964.7,0,37058,norton_j_come,,1684.4,1690.445,"Well, we think that it --"
1964.7,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1690.445,1694.48,I think that's been argued later?
1964.7,0,37058,norton_j_come,,1694.48,1696.639,"It could be it, it could well be."
1964.7,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1723.357,1728.536,(Inaudible)
1964.7,0,37058,norton_j_come,,1728.536,1731.697,"Well, the Board is not trying to second guess the employer."
1964.7,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1746.319,1752.692,(Inaudible)
1964.7,0,37058,norton_j_come,,1752.692,1762.832,"Well, with the difference, however, that they were continuing the discrimination against their regular employees who are ready and willing to come to work."
1964.7,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1767.86,1768.858,Mr. Keller.
1964.7,1,45221,william_l_keller,,1768.858,1775.295,If it please the Court.
1964.7,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1814.07,1821.668,"Well then how -- how far can judges go in assessing whether they did or didn't properly balanced, if we get to that first?"
1964.7,1,45221,william_l_keller,,1821.668,1837.757,"Well, I think we -- we'll reach that point because we will point out in our argument, respondents, during the course of the hearing, tried to introduce evidence of economic necessity to show that it was mandatory that they continued operations and we were not permitted that opportunity."
1964.7,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1879.648,1887.773,"Mr. Keller, is there a -- is that point you made revealed in this record that you were -- didn't have an opportunity to present your case?"
1964.7,1,45221,william_l_keller,,1887.773,1888.994,"That's in the record, yes."
1964.7,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1888.994,1894.742,"Well, could you give me a citation on that, I don't want to waste your time now but it is in there."
1964.7,1,45221,william_l_keller,,1894.742,1895.401,It's in there.
1964.7,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1895.401,1896.498,Have you made a point of it in your brief (Voice Overlap)?
1964.7,1,45221,william_l_keller,,1896.498,1897.833,I may point out on the brief --
1964.7,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1897.833,1898.028,Alright.
1964.7,1,45221,william_l_keller,,1898.028,1899.74,-- but that was the ruling of the trial examiner.
1964.7,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1950.381,1952.895,"Well, each did hire outsiders so to speak?"
1964.7,1,45221,william_l_keller,,1952.895,1953.615,No Sir.
1964.7,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1953.615,1954.438,None did?
1964.7,1,45221,william_l_keller,,1954.438,1956.3,"I didn't say “none”, you said each."
1964.7,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1956.3,1957.802,"Oh, I got it."
1964.7,1,45221,william_l_keller,,1957.802,1973.689,"I think the record will show that two respondents hired no temporary replacements and that most, all respondents, or the remaining two, hired maybe some place between one and four temporary replacements."
1964.7,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1985.075,1989.991,"Now, wives of managerial employees, isn't that regular employee was it?"
1964.7,1,45221,william_l_keller,,1989.991,1994.671,We have one or two in there that have performed some part-time services for the respondents.
1964.7,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1994.671,1998.73,But otherwise wouldn't the wives should be outside to work for it?
1964.7,1,45221,william_l_keller,,1998.73,2007.961,Our contention is that we would not concern a big temporary replacement if they were helping their husbands or the owners of the business protect their business interest.
1964.7,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2007.961,2009.605,"Yeah, but in a domestic union?"
1964.7,1,45221,william_l_keller,,2009.605,2010.287,I beg you pardon?
1964.7,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2010.287,2012.044,They haven't been in a domestic union.
1964.7,1,45221,william_l_keller,,2012.044,2012.17,That's right.
1964.7,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2012.17,2013.441,To get it on.
1964.7,1,45221,william_l_keller,,2013.441,2015.093,That's right.
1964.7,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2025.675,2027.666,Well what about the Safeway store?
1964.7,1,45221,william_l_keller,,2027.666,2033.911,"Well, the exception Safeway stores, they're small respondent grocers in Carlsbad, New Mexico."
1964.7,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2033.911,2037.839,(Inaudible)
1964.7,1,45221,william_l_keller,,2037.839,2039.912,The record does not show that sir.
1964.7,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2039.912,2044.239,(Inaudible)
1964.7,1,45221,william_l_keller,,2044.239,2056.871,"I think if I recall correctly that Food Jet of course was the smallest that operation from the nature of drive-in, it had an owner and his wife and maybe two or three clerk."
1964.7,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2093.949,2097.63,(Inaudible)
1964.7,1,45221,william_l_keller,,2097.63,2098.769,That's correct Sir.
1964.7,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2098.769,2104.55,(Inaudible)
1964.7,1,45221,william_l_keller,,2104.55,2105.445,That's correct sir.
1964.7,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2122.062,2130.945,(Inaudible)
1964.7,1,45221,william_l_keller,,2130.945,2134.401,That's correct.
1964.7,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2414.141,2422.561,What do you think the Court (Inaudible)?
1964.7,1,45221,william_l_keller,,2422.561,2426.776,I don't think it has much merit frankly for these reasons.
1964.7,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2779.217,2781.817,Safeway closed down one store and went open?
1964.7,1,45221,william_l_keller,,2781.817,2784.187,That's correct sir.
1964.7,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2784.187,2791.995,But now reinstate and give back pay to employees and the closed store?
1964.7,1,45221,william_l_keller,,2791.995,2800.346,The Board ruled that Safeway would not be required to give back pay to the employees in the store which was for the period it was closed during the strike.
1964.7,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2800.346,2801.623,But the other one would?
1964.7,1,45221,william_l_keller,,2801.623,2802.487,The other one would.
1964.7,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2811.207,2820.014,I looked at your brief in the record to this business here not being given a fair opportunity to put in your evidence.
1964.7,1,45221,william_l_keller,,2829.594,2863.056,"They place to -- I would point out to the Court that in this case, the Board relies on Buffalo Linen and it's the Board's vast expertise to balance all these and to delicately balance the conflicting interests between the parties to this type of an action and it just doesn't quite seem right to the respondents that when you attempt to offer evidence of economic necessity to show the Board why you are compelled to continue to operate your stores, that you are not given that opportunity."
