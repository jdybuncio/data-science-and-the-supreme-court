1978.77-1575,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,71.589,We'll hear arguments next in Federal Communications Commission against Midwest Video and the consolidated cases.
1978.77-1575,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,76.671,81.472,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1978.77-1575,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,343.541,359.431,"Just before you go back just a moment, Mr. Wallace, why do you suppose the Court of Appeals addressed the constitutional question if you found that what the Commission did was not authorized by the Act?"
1978.77-1575,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,359.431,389.515,"Well, as Judge Webster pointed out in this concurring opinion there was no need to do so but two of the judges choose to do so and the questions were argued to the Court and perhaps it was to make clear what would happen if this Court should disagree with the Court of Appeals on the statutory issue as it did in the last Midwest Video case disagreed with the same Court of Appeals' interpretation of the Commission's statutory jurisdiction."
1978.77-1575,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,389.515,394.263,Do you mean that is a typical alternative ground for decision?
1978.77-1575,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,394.263,408.447,"Well, they refrain from calling it an alternative holding but they made quite clear their view that the rules would violate the First Amendment and suggested strongly that they would violate the Fifth Amendment as well."
1978.77-1575,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,418.453,430.832,Isn't there -- did they indicate in your view that their statutory holding was influenced by their constitutional views sometimes you know.
1978.77-1575,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,430.832,431.304,Yes.
1978.77-1575,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,431.304,437.28,And because of constitutional difficulties one feels impelled of construe a statute to certain way?
1978.77-1575,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,437.28,451.325,It's really hard for me to answer that question I don't think the opinion is all that clear on the extent to which the constitutional view influenced the statutory holding.
1978.77-1575,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,529.073,537.402,"It is difficult to describe that as a holding, is it not, in view of the fact of the Chief Justice's concurrence in the result?"
1978.77-1575,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,537.402,542.983,"Yes, but there was a judgment of the Court, there was a holding that those rules were valid."
1978.77-1575,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,542.983,548.713,"But the reasoning for upholding, I mean it cannot really be attributed to the Court?"
1978.77-1575,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,548.713,572.845,"Well, I understand, but on the other hand there was no disagreement in any of the opinions with that proposition and this is I think an accurate, generic categorization of the rules that were issued before the Court and it was the Commission's own description of the rules on the basis for its authority."
1978.77-1575,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,678.758,685.934,"Well, you are saying that the mandatory access was necessary to the decision of the Court in Southwest cable?"
1978.77-1575,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,685.934,690.968,"No, the Court merely held that the Commission had jurisdiction to promulgate rules on this subject."
1978.77-1575,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,872.833,884.273,"Mr. Wallace, did you think in this case these rules you are describing that the Commission is imposed on cable telecasters would be permissible for it to impose on broadcasters?"
1978.77-1575,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,884.273,900.383,"Well, the Court suggested in The Democratic National Committee case, CBS against The Democratic National Committee that narrowly defined access requirements might be valid in broadcasting."
1978.77-1575,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,935.456,940.224,Why could not the Commission just say you broadcast for ten hours a day and let other people broadcast it for four hours a day?
1978.77-1575,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,940.224,946.596,"Well, that would be an analogous requirement, but it wouldn't be the same requirement."
1978.77-1575,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1028.992,1036.018,"But is it not correct that the rule applies even if there is no unused capacity, even if there was a full that a licensee --"
1978.77-1575,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1036.018,1050.88,"The rule applies but with the qualifications that I mentioned that no established programming is to be bumped under this rule, no established programming in effect on June 21, 1976 other than automated time and weather programming."
1978.77-1575,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1050.88,1056.543,"Suppose next year or two, they do get enough period that they would like to put on, they are restricted as to just one thing --"
1978.77-1575,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1056.543,1061.038,That's right unless they want to build in additional capacity.
1978.77-1575,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1073.519,1087.643,Following upon Mr. Justice Rehnquist's question about other licensee's isn't there a similarity between these rules and the prime time rules that say only three out of the four hours of prime time can be used for network television?
1978.77-1575,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1087.643,1095.452,Well there is a similarity in the constitutional argument being made here.
1978.77-1575,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1155.545,1159.878,Do you think congress could impose these rules on newspapers?
1978.77-1575,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1159.878,1163.621,Well I think that's very dubious theory.
1978.77-1575,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1198.438,1208.126,"Well, isn't that something more fundamental namely, broadcasting and its related elements are regulated."
1978.77-1575,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1210.538,1216.89,Well of course I think basically that's the difference.
1978.77-1575,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1275.546,1283.158,"But is that quite right, don't they have the judgment as to which materials will be selected and which sources of material will be used?"
1978.77-1575,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1283.158,1283.813,Of course they do have some --
1978.77-1575,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1283.813,1285.563,It's just a matter of editorial judgment.
1978.77-1575,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1285.563,1292.635,Of course there is editorial judgment and we do not contend that they do not have First Amendment protection.
1978.77-1575,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1292.635,1295.17,So the analogy of the telephone company you really did not realize --
1978.77-1575,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1295.17,1356.739,"It wasn't my analogy and we don't rely on it, [Attempt to Laughter] no but there are similarities to the telephone company and similarities to broadcasters, similarities to the print medias, similarities to common carriers and to other public utility companies all of which we argue in our brief have to be taken into account in looking at the first amendment contention and in addition to this basic point about the nature of the enterprise the familiar signal carriage requirements that I talked about before show that there has never been in this field, a promise of unfettered editorial judgment about what can or must be carried among the programming offered, there is --"
1978.77-1575,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1356.739,1359.258,"Mr. Wallace, could you clear up one detail for me?"
1978.77-1575,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1376.05,1426.506,"The regulation says that the cable company should adopt procedures, rules for itself to show how it will handle request on first come first serve basis, so this anticipates that people don't have to be given the particular time slot that they request that scheduling can be done to use the capacity that blackout time can be used on other channels when time is available and so forth and if the domain gets large enough and there is available a second channels and that two should be made available up to four channels if they are available, but the experience so far has been that a composite channel pretty much is able to cover it."
1978.77-1575,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1580.67,1592.435,"Mr. Wallace, could I ask you, are there â€“ does the Commission have rules of perspective to the acquisition or ownership of cable systems by broadcasters or by the networks?"
1978.77-1575,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1592.435,1602.13,"I'm not aware of them if they do, but I have not heard that they do but I can't inform you of their content."
1978.77-1575,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1611.932,1616.875,Mr. Shapiro.
1978.77-1575,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1616.875,1620.472,"Mr. Shapiro, could you at some point answer that question I just asked?"
1978.77-1575,1,26102,george_h_shapiro,,1620.472,1622.158,I certainly will Your Honor.
1978.77-1575,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1622.158,1622.721,Thank you.
1978.77-1575,1,26102,george_h_shapiro,,1622.721,1627.001,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1978.77-1575,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1646.826,1648.608,But not in other markets?
1978.77-1575,1,26102,george_h_shapiro,,1648.608,1655.244,Not in other markets.
1978.77-1575,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1808.778,1818.605,"Mr. Shapiro perhaps my colleagues don't cheer my ignorance of cable television, but what is involved in activating a new channel for the cable TV operator?"
1978.77-1575,1,26102,george_h_shapiro,,1818.605,1829.363,"Your Honor, cable system channels are -- a television set is only able to receive normally 12 channels of VHF transmission."
1978.77-1575,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1906.834,1916.616,"Mr. Shapiro, perhaps I shouldn't ask these kind of questions like Mr. Justice Rehnquist, does this converter that would increase capacity from 12 to 20 does that only goes on the sets or that goes on the cable system?"
1978.77-1575,1,26102,george_h_shapiro,,1916.616,1918.136,Normally it goes on the set Your Honor.
1978.77-1575,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1923.696,1928.249,"But does the system itself, how does system itself get capacity increased from 12 to 20?"
1978.77-1575,1,26102,george_h_shapiro,,1928.249,1938.952,Well this depends on when the system -- modern systems have the capacity to deliver 20 or more channels if converters exist.
1978.77-1575,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1938.952,1940.467,I see.
1978.77-1575,1,26102,george_h_shapiro,,1940.467,1944.797,The purchase â€“ there is evidence in the record on the cost of converters.
1978.77-1575,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2068.54,2086.012,"Mr. Shapiro, is there any barrier that you can suggest if the Commission issued traditional broadcast license to a TV or a radio, not a cable TV or broadcast license."
1978.77-1575,1,26102,george_h_shapiro,,2086.012,2086.665,"Yes, Your Honor."
1978.77-1575,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2086.665,2098.066,"On condition that they dedicate 25% of the operating time to public educational programs selected by some described method, any barriers of that?"
1978.77-1575,1,26102,george_h_shapiro,,2098.066,2106.432,"Well, Your Honor I thought that the -- this Court's decision in the CBS versus Democratic National Committee was a barrier to that."
1978.77-1575,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2110.22,2115.329,Didn't that go to the specific content rather than the allocation?
1978.77-1575,1,26102,george_h_shapiro,,2125.467,2127.739,"Let me be sure I understand your question, Your Honor."
1978.77-1575,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2146.36,2147.177,The content.
1978.77-1575,1,26102,george_h_shapiro,,2147.177,2152.41,Without -- and leaving the content of that programming to the broadcast station.
1978.77-1575,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2154.228,2155.454,"Well, let's back it up."
1978.77-1575,1,26102,george_h_shapiro,,2164.296,2171.209,I believe that they could.
1978.77-1575,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2197.392,2201.522,Is that the sort of thing we get on and tuck it from Atlanta Georgia.
1978.77-1575,1,26102,george_h_shapiro,,2201.522,2212.929,What you get on them tuck it from Atlanta Georgia Your Honor probably an independent signal of a television station which is distributed by satellite.
1978.77-1575,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2224.407,2225.622,Satellite.
1978.77-1575,1,26102,george_h_shapiro,,2225.622,2230.507,"No, it's distributed by satellite Your Honor but it's not the retransmission of a broadcast signal."
1978.77-1575,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2237.672,2240.134,"Well, It was sold by a common carrier I gather not by the --"
1978.77-1575,1,26102,george_h_shapiro,,2240.134,2247.582,"No Your Honor, it's sold by a joint venture of Madison Square Garden and a cable company which distributes the programming."
1978.77-1575,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2247.582,2249.548,"Well, is that a broadcaster then?"
1978.77-1575,1,26102,george_h_shapiro,,2249.548,2251.499,"No, it is not a broadcaster."
1978.77-1575,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2251.499,2252.742,Unregulated then?
1978.77-1575,1,26102,george_h_shapiro,,2252.742,2255.189,"Well, Your Honor, it's originated programming."
1978.77-1575,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2279.479,2283.307,"That they don't originate, neither does a broadcaster?"
1978.77-1575,1,26102,george_h_shapiro,,2283.473,2289.508,The cable system does not originate it in the same sense that a broadcast station which carries a network program doesn't originate.
1978.77-1575,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2289.508,2290.969,"In other words, it doesn't prepare it."
1978.77-1575,1,26102,george_h_shapiro,,2290.969,2294.066,"It doesn't prepare it, that's correct, Your Honor."
1978.77-1575,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2576.471,2578.126,Which goals?
1978.77-1575,1,26102,george_h_shapiro,,2578.126,2585.924,Well the Commission -- they were the goals of increasing the outlets of community expression and providing diversified programming.
1978.77-1575,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2585.924,2589.079,So it was connected with the broadcast?
1978.77-1575,1,26102,george_h_shapiro,,2589.079,2592.41,It was connected to the Commissions broadcast regulatory goals.
1978.77-1575,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2600.733,2604.001,Are those goals specified anywhere in the Act?
1978.77-1575,1,26102,george_h_shapiro,,2604.001,2629.274,"Well, the Court found them in Section 1, it found them in Section 303 (g) which authorizes the Commission to take action to further the larger and more effective use of radio in the public interest and it found them in Section 307 (b) which authorizes the Commission to allocate radio facilities on a fair efficient and equitable basis."
1978.77-1575,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2629.274,2638.557,So you don't read the plurality in Midwest I as authorizing the Commission to simply set goals quite apart from the statutory framework.
1978.77-1575,1,26102,george_h_shapiro,,2638.557,2640.588,I think its just the contrary Your Honor.
1978.77-1575,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2663.598,2664.862,But there was a judgment?
1978.77-1575,1,26102,george_h_shapiro,,2664.862,2665.968,There was a judgment.
1978.77-1575,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3024.926,3031.151,Do you think Congress has given them the authority to do it if they decided that was in the public entity?
1978.77-1575,1,26102,george_h_shapiro,,3031.151,3033.198,The Congress has given the FCC authority to --
1978.77-1575,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3033.198,3034.323,How is it given?
1978.77-1575,1,26102,george_h_shapiro,,3034.323,3035.788,To do what to regulate or --
1978.77-1575,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3035.788,3036.791,Regulate.
1978.77-1575,1,26102,george_h_shapiro,,3036.791,3038.662,Cable systems has common carriers?
1978.77-1575,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3038.662,3045.558,"No, to regulate the rates just to that extent?"
1978.77-1575,1,26102,george_h_shapiro,,3045.558,3047.939,"Of broadcasters, Your Honor or cable systems?"
1978.77-1575,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3047.939,3050.45,Cable.
1978.77-1575,1,26102,george_h_shapiro,,3050.45,3067.94,To the extent that -- the position thus far Your Honor the Court's recognition of the jurisdiction of the FCC is based upon -- has been based on broadcast regulatory authority.
1978.77-1575,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3073.133,3073.899,Could it?
1978.77-1575,1,26102,george_h_shapiro,,3073.899,3074.353,Huh?
1978.77-1575,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3074.353,3076.313,"Could it, does it have the legal --"
1978.77-1575,1,26102,george_h_shapiro,,3076.313,3078.973,I don't think it could under the existing statute.
1978.77-1575,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3078.973,3085.834,But you I take it from that you concede that the Congress could confer that power on the Commission?
1978.77-1575,1,26102,george_h_shapiro,,3085.834,3090.333,To regulate broadcasting rates?
1978.77-1575,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3227.227,3232.114,"Well, the First Amendment gave it rather than this Court?"
1978.77-1575,1,26102,george_h_shapiro,,3232.114,3233.491,Excuse me Your Honor I didn't her that.
1978.77-1575,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3233.491,3239.931,I would have thought the First and Fourteenth Amendments had given it to them rather than this Court?
1978.77-1575,1,26102,george_h_shapiro,,3239.931,3246.679,Perhaps I should say recognized rather than gave.
1978.77-1575,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3340.746,3358.343,Would you think then what you are saying now you don't think is inconsistent with what you said -- the way you answered the Chief Justice with respect to a broadcaster being required to allocate 25% of its broadcast time to public service?
1978.77-1575,1,26102,george_h_shapiro,,3358.343,3360.33,Well Your Honor --
1978.77-1575,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3360.33,3363.822,"Because there is a difference between broadcasters and cables and newspapers, I guess?"
1978.77-1575,1,26102,george_h_shapiro,,3363.822,3373.127,Yes there is the different broad -- different regulation is always been applicable to broadcasters than to other media.
1978.77-1575,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3373.127,3374.579,Because of spectrum limitations?
1978.77-1575,1,26102,george_h_shapiro,,3374.579,3382.789,"Because primarily of spectrum limitation, there have been other types of differences in the --"
1978.77-1575,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3382.789,3387.972,"And you suggest Mr. Shapiro, the spectrum limitations do not apply to cable business?"
1978.77-1575,1,26102,george_h_shapiro,,3387.972,3391.62,"Spectrum limitations do not apply to cable, that is correct."
1978.77-1575,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3391.62,3394.668,What public resource does cable television use?
1978.77-1575,1,26102,george_h_shapiro,,3394.668,3409.376,"To the extent that it uses any Your Honor, it uses its rights of way to the string cables over public easements, streets, highways."
1978.77-1575,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3409.376,3413.322,"When you say public easements, do you mean the easements own by the federal government?"
1978.77-1575,1,26102,george_h_shapiro,,3413.322,3418.109,"No, normally these are easements owned by states or municipalities."
1978.77-1575,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3418.109,3420.426,Easement is over property?
1978.77-1575,1,26102,george_h_shapiro,,3420.426,3421.651,Easement is over property.
1978.77-1575,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3421.651,3422.544,Or under?
1978.77-1575,1,26102,george_h_shapiro,,3422.544,3423.632,Or under.
1978.77-1575,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3423.632,3428.697,But the limitations on them are more on being able to get them more economic than anything else?
1978.77-1575,1,26102,george_h_shapiro,,3428.697,3442.076,"That is precisely our point Your Honor and in the Miami Herald versus Tornillo, this Court held that economic restrains did not --"
1978.77-1575,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3442.076,3452.492,"Is it not true Mr. Shapiro that it as a fact of the matter, any one local market is apt to be served by only one cable system because of these problems of physical installation and the like?"
1978.77-1575,1,26102,george_h_shapiro,,3452.492,3464.285,"Your Honor, that is true in by far the bulk of the instances, just as it is true that there is only one newspaper in by far the bulk of the markets."
1978.77-1575,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3482.293,3484.58,"Mr. Wallace, do you have anything further?"
1978.77-1575,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3484.58,3488.148,Yes Mr. Chief Justice.
1978.77-1575,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3500.736,3503.267,Why do you call that as a public resource?
1978.77-1575,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3503.267,3512.851,"Well, that they have been treated as such in the history of regulation under the Communications Act."
1978.77-1575,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3580.794,3588.953,"Does the government take the position that there was power to promulgate these rules, if they were not limited to systems that retransmitted television stations?"
1978.77-1575,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3588.953,3607.351,"Well, I think there would be because even in the instances of other kinds of programming that Mr. Shapiro referred to, programming beamed in from satellites, those are beamed on microwave transmissions that are regulated under Title II of the Communications Act."
1978.77-1575,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3735.1,3737.723,(Inaudible)
1978.77-1575,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3737.723,3755.445,That is an example and certainly there is no further limitation on cable television which is not even referred to in this Section 153 (h).
1978.77-1575,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3868.267,3880.315,"Mr. Wallace, you spoke quite glowingly on two occasions in your response of the Chief Justice's concurrence in Midwest Video."
1978.77-1575,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3914.449,3940.541,"Well, I do not concede that it cannot be required of broadcasters because the very same opinion points out that limited access rules might be properly required of broadcasters notwithstanding that can be drawn from failure of Congress to enact an exclusive requirement, Congress nevertheless gave the Commission authority to further public interest goals."
1978.77-1575,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3970.062,3970.75,Thank you gentlemen.
