1979.79-116,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,73.318,We will hear argument next in Thomas v. Washington Gas Light Company.
1979.79-116,0,30598,james_f_green,,74.615,77.094,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1979.79-116,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,183.093,185.755,"Let me back up a little bit, Mr. Green."
1979.79-116,0,30598,james_f_green,,185.755,186.348,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice."
1979.79-116,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,186.348,193.973,"In Virginia, he received compensation for total but not permanent disability, is that right?"
1979.79-116,0,30598,james_f_green,,193.973,194.504,"That is correct, Mr. Chief Justice."
1979.79-116,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,194.504,195.676,Totally but not permanent.
1979.79-116,0,30598,james_f_green,,195.676,196.3,That is correct.
1979.79-116,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,196.3,199.417,The claim now is that he is permanently disabled.
1979.79-116,0,30598,james_f_green,,199.417,200.081,That is correct.
1979.79-116,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,201.531,207.575,Is his claim foreclosed in Virginia for permanent disability?
1979.79-116,0,30598,james_f_green,,216.28,221.247,"Your Honor, the question of permanent and total disability was never resolved in the Commonwealth of Virginia."
1979.79-116,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,222.391,222.934,Why not?
1979.79-116,0,30598,james_f_green,,222.934,235.06,"Because the benefits in the District of Columbia after Mr. Thomas obtained counsel were more generous to Mr. Thomas, and a claim was initiated in the District of Columbia for permanent and total disability benefits."
1979.79-116,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,235.06,249.249,"I perhaps misunderstood this situation, but I thought the fact was that he has now been paid all that he could be paid under the Virginia Workmen's Compensation Act for -- even for total permanent disability."
1979.79-116,0,30598,james_f_green,,249.249,251.868,"Mr. Justice Stewart, you do not misunderstand what he has been paid."
1979.79-116,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,258.188,262.25,Even if one concedes that he was totally and permanently disabled?
1979.79-116,0,30598,james_f_green,,262.25,263.536,"That is correct, Mr. Justice."
1979.79-116,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,263.536,264.267,That is what I thought.
1979.79-116,0,30598,james_f_green,,264.267,278.01,"He has been paid that amount, the point being that they continue to pay the Virginia award even after the District of Columbia had granted Thomas' claim for permanent and total disability; an award was entered, they never paid the award."
1979.79-116,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,278.01,282.874,I am having a little difficulty reconciling your two answers just on the factual situation.
1979.79-116,0,30598,james_f_green,,282.874,283.365,Let me see if I can --
1979.79-116,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,283.365,288.69,"That is why I put the question, because I was confused as to the reality."
1979.79-116,0,30598,james_f_green,,296.43,300.984,"And my answer to your question, Mr. Chief Justice, would have been he could have pursued such a remedy in Virginia."
1979.79-116,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,326.223,331.991,And what would it have been open to him to pursue in virginia after his initial award?
1979.79-116,0,30598,james_f_green,,331.991,344.554,"He would have been able in Virginia to pursue under a separate statutory policy permanent disability, that is permanent and total disability, although it is not captioned as such in Virginia, under their statute he could have --"
1979.79-116,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,344.554,346.723,"Well, what did he get an award for?"
1979.79-116,0,30598,james_f_green,,346.723,352.699,"He received an award, a voluntary award for temporary total disability."
1979.79-116,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,352.699,353.638,Temporary total.
1979.79-116,0,30598,james_f_green,,353.638,354.56,Yes.
1979.79-116,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,354.56,358.403,So he could have pursued another award for permanent in Virginia?
1979.79-116,0,30598,james_f_green,,358.403,361.08,"It would be our position that he could have, Mr. Justice White, yes."
1979.79-116,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,361.08,365.76,But would he have obtained a single dime more than he had already obtained?
1979.79-116,0,30598,james_f_green,,365.76,371.411,"Mr. Justice Blackmun, he would not have obtained any more money because the Virginia statue at that time --"
1979.79-116,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,371.411,374.282,"Precisely, therefore why go to Virginia?"
1979.79-116,0,30598,james_f_green,,374.282,382.911,"That is why he came to D. C., sir, that was the election and he made it and came to the District of Columbia and brought his action and received the award which has not been honored."
1979.79-116,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,382.911,385.87,It seems to me we are making a lot of fuss over nothing here.
1979.79-116,0,30598,james_f_green,,393.282,393.493,Not just the money --
1979.79-116,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,393.493,395.73,Whether it is total or whether it is permanent.
1979.79-116,0,30598,james_f_green,,395.73,398.78,"Correct, Mr. Justice Blackmun, not just the money but also the medical benefits."
1979.79-116,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,447.756,453.475,What do you consider to be the holding as you described it in McCartin?
1979.79-116,0,30598,james_f_green,,453.475,481.235,"Mr. Justice Rehnquist, I consider the holding to be that in a statutory scheme where a state allows for recovery by an injured worker having only limited demands prior common law right to sue his employer through that statutory scheme, he can bring an additional action in any state or any forum in which he desires to do so, allowing certain constitutional contacts that would give him the right to bring that claim."
1979.79-116,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,481.235,484.947,Isn't a good deal of what you have just said dicta rather than a holding?
1979.79-116,0,30598,james_f_green,,484.947,486.047,I don't believe that it is.
1979.79-116,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,507.009,517.841,But a court can write a ten-page opinion and say we hold that in every paragraph and that still doesn't make each paragraph a holding.
1979.79-116,0,30598,james_f_green,,517.841,524.623,"I would agree with that, but I would urge that it is not dicta in McCartin, that it is the rule of McCartin and has been so interpreted."
1979.79-116,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,592.044,599.19,Mr. Horowitz.
1979.79-116,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,599.19,602.655,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1979.79-116,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,633.147,653.764,"So the fact is that he has gotten all that he could possibly get under the Virginia system and all that somebody who didn't have even a potential choice of going into another jurisdiction system, all that such a person could possibly get."
1979.79-116,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,653.764,654.313,That's correct.
1979.79-116,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,654.313,655.862,"He has received, hasn't he?"
1979.79-116,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,655.862,656.2,Correct.
1979.79-116,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,658.61,659.201,Right.
1979.79-116,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,659.201,660.831,Had he gone to the District of Columbia initially --
1979.79-116,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,660.831,673.649,"And if he had a Virginia employer and been injured in Virginia and had no connection with any other jurisdiction and had been totally and permanently disabled, this is all he could ever get under the Virginia system, isn't that correct?"
1979.79-116,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,673.649,676.301,"That's right, under the statute as it was written at the time."
1979.79-116,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,676.301,677.496,As it was then written.
1979.79-116,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,677.496,678.799,That's correct.
1979.79-116,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,722.47,727.256,"That is wholly at odds with accepted full faith and credit doctrine, isn't it?"
1979.79-116,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,727.256,728.682,"No, I don't believe it is."
1979.79-116,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,728.682,737.985,"It is not the intent, it is what effect the home state would give that judgment --"
1979.79-116,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,737.985,738.235,That's correct.
1979.79-116,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,738.235,740.005,-- and the foreign state must give the same effect.
1979.79-116,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,740.005,742.686,"That's correct, but it does not have to give any greater effect."
1979.79-116,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,743.668,755.393,It has nothing to do with -- you wouldn't concede that the statement of the Court in McCartin was a little bit at odds with normally accepted full faith and credit?
1979.79-116,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,755.393,756.529,I don't believe so.
1979.79-116,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,779.194,782.955,It only has to give it that and under full faith and credit it must give it that.
1979.79-116,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,782.955,784.504,That's quite correct.
1979.79-116,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,795.664,806.28,"Under ordinary full faith and credit doctrine, it is not that the law of Virginia says we want to make very clear that this must be given effect in other jurisdictions."
1979.79-116,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,807.114,814.12,"I agree, but the question is what does the Virginia award mean in Virginia."
1979.79-116,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,814.12,815.299,Precisely.
1979.79-116,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,815.299,824.861,"But in Virginia, the Virginia courts would not hear a claim under the District of Columbia statute, so there is no way to tell, there is not going to be any case law to tell --"
1979.79-116,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,824.861,830.338,Virginia courts would hear a petition for a permanent disability award.
1979.79-116,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,835.782,844.535,"Well, I think for the purposes of this case we can treat it as if he had gotten his award in Virginia and it had been called a permanent disability award."
1979.79-116,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,844.535,855.335,"I would think you would want to treat it that way, but the fact is he was given a temporary permanent disability award and Virginia did not bar his seeking a permanent disability award."
1979.79-116,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,855.335,857.489,"Well, suppose he had gone to Virginia and gotten a permanent disability award --"
1979.79-116,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,857.489,862.63,"Well, the Fourth Circuit certainly knows more about Virginia law than we do."
1979.79-116,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,862.63,866.924,"Well, first of all, on the question of Virginia law, there is a dispute."
1979.79-116,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,891.594,894.956,"And for what it is worth, the Fourth Circuit was divided in Pettus."
1979.79-116,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,894.956,896.95,"That's true, the Fourth Circuit was divided on Pettus."
1979.79-116,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,916.148,929.368,"If we have to choose between the Fourth Circuit's interpretation of Virginia law and the D.C. Circuit's interpretation of Virginia law, ordinarily we would defer to the Fourth Circuit rather than the D.C. Circuit, wouldn't we?"
1979.79-116,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,929.368,954.234,"I don't think the Court has to defer to the Fourth Circuit because the Court specified in McCartin what the rule of construction was for interpreting these worker's compensation statutes when they don't specifically address the question of an award under another state's statute, and that rule of construction is that the state must specify by unmistakable language that it intends to bar such an award."
1979.79-116,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,964.226,976.371,"But we have three judges sitting down in Richmond who are presumably familiar with the cases they are talking about, they talk about McCartin and they say McCartin does not control this case."
1979.79-116,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,976.371,977.781,"Right, and I think --"
1979.79-116,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,977.781,989.485,"They may be wrong, but if you are saying that they misinterpreted Virginia law, I think you are leading on a rather weak reed."
1979.79-116,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,989.485,992.887,I am saying that they misinterpreted McCartin.
1979.79-116,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,992.887,1000.286,"Well, that may be another question, but they didn't understand what McCartin told them they had to find in order to do what they did."
1979.79-116,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1000.286,1008.517,"That's right, and so they did not interpret -- they made no attempt to interpret the Virginia statute in line as prescribed by this Court in McCartin."
1979.79-116,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1017.098,1021.127,"Mr. Horowitz, something slipped my mind here."
1979.79-116,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1026.113,1035.627,"Well, there is a provision in the Longshoremen's Act that appeal should be to the circuit where the injury occurred."
1979.79-116,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1133.188,1142.921,What you are saying by that is that there is no interest of the Commonwealth of Virginia that is really implicated here.
1979.79-116,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1142.921,1161.792,"Well, to the extent that there is an interest -- it is conceivable that Virginia might have decided that it was better not to have supplemental awards, that they prefer the limitations, but to the extent that they have expressed themselves on that, they have shown that their interest is in providing supplemental awards, that is that the stronger interest is to compensate the injured employees."
1979.79-116,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1161.792,1172.724,"But if Virginia is not concerned about awards elsewhere, one would think that it isn't concerned about its own allocation of awards."
1979.79-116,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1172.724,1175.122,"That's correct, that it just would not want to restrict it."
1979.79-116,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1176.316,1184.27,Does Virginia have any economic interest or any other kind of interest in being concerned about how much money someone else pays out?
1979.79-116,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1184.27,1187.067,It certainly has no direct economic interest.
1979.79-116,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1187.9,1198.212,"Whatever some other state -- whatever is achieved in some other state relieves any tension or pressure for Virginia to expand its awards, is that not so?"
1979.79-116,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1198.212,1201.238,"That's correct, in a case where there is jurisdiction of both states."
1979.79-116,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1201.238,1209.669,"But that 90 percent or more of the industrial accidents in Virginia, an injured person wouldn't have a choice of two jurisdictions."
1979.79-116,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1209.886,1212.182,That's correct.
1979.79-116,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1239.881,1241.874,Because he was a resident or --
1979.79-116,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1241.874,1247.876,Because he was a resident and because the respondent is an employer in the District of Columbia.
1979.79-116,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1249.427,1251.492,But in fact he went to Virginia.
1979.79-116,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1251.492,1252.986,"That's right, in fact he went to Virginia."
1979.79-116,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1278.197,1281.479,"But no one forced him to sign the award, did they?"
1979.79-116,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1281.479,1283.599,There is no evidence that he was forced to sign the award.
1979.79-116,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1289.441,1292.181,Is the issue here constitutional or not?
1979.79-116,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1292.181,1296.666,"Well, we think the constitutional issue has been settled by McCartin if this Court --"
1979.79-116,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1296.666,1299.385,So there is one?
1979.79-116,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1299.385,1301.396,If the Court is going to reconsider McCartin.
1979.79-116,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1301.396,1304.742,Was there a statutory issue in the case?
1979.79-116,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1304.742,1305.394,In this case?
1979.79-116,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1305.394,1306.143,Yes.
1979.79-116,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1306.143,1311.768,"Well, there is always a statutory issue as to whether the Virginia statute intends to preclude a D.C. award."
1979.79-116,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1311.768,1317.177,"Well, what about the Longshoremen's Act?"
1979.79-116,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1317.177,1318.594,I'm afraid I don't understand the question.
1979.79-116,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1318.594,1321.284,The two first arguments made by your brother.
1979.79-116,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1321.284,1323.838,"Oh, I'm sorry."
1979.79-116,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1325.581,1328.289,The second of them.
1979.79-116,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1328.289,1330.244,As to the scope of the Longshoremen's Act.
1979.79-116,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1330.244,1334.685,Whether the Longshoremen's Act permits a longshoremen's award if a state has granted an award.
1979.79-116,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1334.685,1336.303,"Well, that --"
1979.79-116,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1336.303,1338.341,Was that ever presented?
1979.79-116,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1338.341,1341.686,That was apparently presented in the Court of Appeals.
1979.79-116,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1342.785,1343.533,Was it passed on?
1979.79-116,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1343.533,1344.647,"No, it was not passed on."
1979.79-116,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1344.647,1347.69,Why wasn't it?
1979.79-116,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1347.69,1348.638,I don't know.
1979.79-116,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1350.971,1354.822,"It certainly would have avoided the constitutional question, wouldn't it?"
1979.79-116,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1354.822,1355.664,"Well, the court --"
1979.79-116,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1355.664,1357.871,"Maybe, if it had been decided one way."
1979.79-116,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1357.871,1362.208,"The Court of Appeals may have felt that it wasn't raised below, they didn't say."
1979.79-116,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1362.208,1363.381,"Well, was it?"
1979.79-116,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1365.121,1366.93,"Well, it was not raised in the administrative hearing."
1979.79-116,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1367.796,1371.468,"Well, you don't usually raise those in an administrative hearing."
1979.79-116,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1371.468,1383.087,"Well, there was a contention that the D.C. law did not apply because of the full faith and credit clause and at the administrative hearing they --"
1979.79-116,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1383.087,1390.903,How about the claim that the D.C. law didn't apply because it is the Longshoremen's Act and the Longshoremen's Act does not permit awards where a state has awarded?
1979.79-116,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1390.903,1400.637,"That was conceded at the administrative hearing, that there was no contention that the District of Columbia act would not have applied if it were not for the Virginia award."
1979.79-116,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1400.637,1415.385,"Is there any possibility here that if a total and permanent award were made in the District of Columbia, Virginia could recover from what it has paid out?"
1979.79-116,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1415.385,1419.0,"Well, all the monies that are paid out are paid out by the employer."
1979.79-116,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1419.294,1421.683,"Well, I meant to say the employer."
1979.79-116,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1421.683,1425.567,"Yes, the District of Columbia award would give credit for the monies paid out in Virginia."
1979.79-116,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1435.155,1451.06,"Let's assume that an issue had been raised that no longshoremen's style recovery may be had because the state has already entered an award, and you read something out of the Longshoremen's Act to that effect."
1979.79-116,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1465.192,1466.701,"Well, under the --"
1979.79-116,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1466.701,1470.55,Would that have been a correct ruling or not?
1979.79-116,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1470.55,1472.654,"No, under the Longshoremen's Act, no, that is not a correct ruling."
1979.79-116,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1472.654,1475.857,Why wouldn't it have been?
1979.79-116,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1475.857,1486.971,"Because the Longshoremen's Act does not restrict its recoveries to cases that are not covered under other state laws, and that contention of respondents is incorrect."
1979.79-116,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1490.557,1492.741,But the Court of Appeals didn't rule on the question.
1979.79-116,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1492.741,1493.798,The Court of Appeals didn't say anything about it.
1979.79-116,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1498.553,1503.873,"Well, you just had a two-paragraph opinion in the Court of Appeals because they sat on the Pettus result."
1979.79-116,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1503.873,1504.543,That's right.
1979.79-116,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1504.543,1509.623,So really what is challenged here is the Pettus case and not this one.
1979.79-116,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1509.623,1511.392,"Yes, but technically this case."
1979.79-116,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1511.392,1513.656,Which perhaps we should have taken.
1979.79-116,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1513.656,1519.333,"If the statutory question was implicitly rejected, we should reach it first here?"
1979.79-116,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1522.796,1526.858,"Well, the Court might want to remand to the Court of Appeals for consideration of the statute."
1979.79-116,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1526.858,1528.696,"Well, you told me they rejected it."
1979.79-116,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1528.696,1530.429,I don't know if they rejected it.
1979.79-116,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1532.371,1534.844,Certainly this Court has never decided it.
1979.79-116,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1534.844,1537.157,"No, this Court has not decided it."
1979.79-116,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1537.157,1542.158,"Mr. Horowitz, before you sit down, you said there was a constitutional question."
1979.79-116,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1545.621,1560.616,"Well, there was a question prior to McCartin as to whether the full faith and credit clause would bar this award simply because an award was made in Virginia and Virginia has a general exclusivity provision that makes that award exclusive."
1979.79-116,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1560.616,1564.762,Is the District of Columbia a state within the meaning of the full faith and credit clause?
1979.79-116,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1564.762,1567.847,"Well, I think for these purposes it would be."
1979.79-116,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1567.847,1569.92,Has that ever been held?
1979.79-116,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1577.023,1586.591,"Well, the full faith and credit clause ties both the Constitution implementing statute to the full faith and credit clause, and they are practically coextensive."
1979.79-116,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1586.591,1595.349,"But if it is not a constitutional question, we may not have the problem Mr. Justice White suggests of needing to address some other statutory question before this statutory question."
1979.79-116,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1595.349,1601.803,"It is like a 1983 case, a purely statutory claim but reads right on the Constitution."
1979.79-116,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1601.803,1605.327,"That's right, but this one does not read on the Constitution and that is why you needed the statute."
1979.79-116,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1605.327,1612.555,"Well, the main issue in this case is also simply a statutory question and that is what does the Virginia statute say."
1979.79-116,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1616.899,1640.8,But you also suggest in your brief that we might reconsider both Magnolia and McCartin to the extent of being persuaded that the full faith and credit clause of the Constitution and its supplementary statute have nothing to do with workmen's compensation awards or that workmen's compensation awards are an exception.
1979.79-116,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1640.8,1647.271,"Well, I certainly don't think the Court has to reconsider Magnolia in this case."
1979.79-116,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1649.673,1652.845,You suggest it on page 26 of your brief.
1979.79-116,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1652.845,1667.778,"Well, we suggested that other -- we were trying to have the Court not step back from the McCartin rationale and in support of that we have noted that some commentators have suggested that even Magnolia was wrong and that is not really an issue in this case."
1979.79-116,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1667.778,1676.791,"Exactly, and that the full faith and credit clause of the Constitution or its equivalent statute are simply inapplicable to workmen's compensation actions."
1979.79-116,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1676.791,1679.043,Because of the nature of workmen's compensation actions --
1979.79-116,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1679.043,1679.593,Exactly.
1979.79-116,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1679.593,1682.573,-- that the state never considers the --
1979.79-116,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1682.573,1689.324,"And that would require reexamination of both Magnolia and McCartin, at least as to their underlying premises."
1979.79-116,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1689.324,1692.16,"Yes, if you were to reach that argument, but there is no need to do so."
1979.79-116,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1692.16,1693.488,Then why did you put it in your brief?
1979.79-116,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1693.488,1697.689,Because I thought it was supportive of the notion that McCartin was correct.
1979.79-116,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1705.778,1715.722,"Which is quite contrary, as I suggested at the outset in my question, from ordinarily accepted doctrine under the full faith and credit clause."
1979.79-116,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1715.722,1716.107,Except that --
1979.79-116,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1716.107,1722.267,It is the duty of a foreign jurisdiction to give precisely the same effect as the local jurisdiction would give to that judgment.
1979.79-116,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1722.267,1723.2,"That's right, and so the question of --"
1979.79-116,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1723.2,1726.289,Regardless of what the legislature might have said.
1979.79-116,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1726.289,1730.24,And so the question is whether the Virginia award would preclude the D.C. award.
1979.79-116,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1730.24,1730.414,That's the question.
1979.79-116,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1730.414,1736.484,"And because Virginia never considers D.C. awards, you can't tell that from what happens in Virginia."
1979.79-116,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1736.484,1738.928,May I ask a question.
1979.79-116,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1792.145,1800.119,"Well, the provision that is in the Virginia law is practically identical to the provision that was in the Illinois law that was considered in McCartin."
1979.79-116,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1800.119,1810.159,"The Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit said, if I recall, in Pettus that it was practically identical with the statute before the Court in Magnolia."
1979.79-116,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1810.159,1826.852,"That's correct, although the Magnolia case had the extra feature which the Court specifically relied on, that the state of Texas did not permit its own courts to give supplemental awards, whereas here Virginia does permit its courts to give supplemental awards."
1979.79-116,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1826.852,1829.066,You rely solely on that distinction?
1979.79-116,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1829.066,1844.243,"Well, I think that is what was at the bottom of the Magnolia finding, that Texas -- in Magnolia, the Court did not specifically on this language but they found that Texas did not permit its awards -- did not permit another state to give supplemental awards."
1979.79-116,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1844.243,1849.049,"Putting that aside, could a state statute be any more explicit than 65.1-40?"
1979.79-116,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1849.049,1849.931,"Yes, it could."
1979.79-116,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1853.751,1856.17,What would you suggest in summary as to --
1979.79-116,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1856.17,1858.322,"Well, the Nevada statute is unique, isn't it?"
1979.79-116,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1858.322,1858.739,"Yes, it is unique."
1979.79-116,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1858.739,1859.56,Among the fifty states.
1979.79-116,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1859.56,1867.509,"It is unique because states have no interest in restricting supplemental awards in other states, and some of the state haven't done that."
1979.79-116,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1867.509,1884.112,"Mr. Horowitz, despite the language that Justice Powell mentioned to you, you just answered him that after this temporary permanent disability award in Virginia, he could have gone back and got a permanent disability award."
1979.79-116,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1885.543,1886.96,In Virginia.
1979.79-116,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1886.96,1889.908,But it wouldn't give him any more money is your --
1979.79-116,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1889.908,1896.34,But that language that Justice Powell read to you wouldn't bar his again proceeding in the --
1979.79-116,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1896.34,1899.623,"No, because that was under the worker's compensation statute."
1979.79-116,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1913.006,1917.055,It bars all other remedies at common law or otherwise.
1979.79-116,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1917.055,1917.438,That's right.
1979.79-116,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1917.438,1918.898,That is pretty broad language.
1979.79-116,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1918.898,1919.722,That is what it states.
1979.79-116,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1960.437,1967.983,"When you talk about an award, you are talking about something that is ultimately paid for by a tax on his employer, are you not?"
1979.79-116,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1967.983,1972.237,"Well, in this case it is paid directly by his employer."
1979.79-116,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1972.237,1976.111,"Could the worker go to Nevada, for instance, and get an award?"
1979.79-116,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1976.111,1980.769,"No, there would be no jurisdiction under the Nevada statute."
1979.79-116,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1980.769,1985.19,"Mr. Horowitz, you may have answered this, but I want to be sure."
1979.79-116,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1990.54,1990.692,No.
1979.79-116,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1990.692,1992.739,You think you can live with it.
1979.79-116,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1992.739,1993.092,Yes.
1979.79-116,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1993.092,1999.779,Yet the commentators in the academic world think there is a bit of tension between Magnolia and McCartin.
1979.79-116,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1999.779,2000.181,"Yes, that's true."
1979.79-116,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2000.181,2001.061,Do you agree with that?
1979.79-116,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,2001.061,2006.995,"Well, there is some tension, they are not satisfied as a theoretical conflicts of law problem."
1979.79-116,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2018.37,2026.097,There was a change in the Chief Justice and the later case was unanimous with only one Justice concurring in the result.
1979.79-116,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,2030.711,2048.032,"The McCartin case severely limited Magnolia and the Magnolia case can still come up, it can still come up in Nevada, but the fact is there is no policy for a state to have such a statute so it is unlikely that this Court will ever be faced with the need to overrule Magnolia or with that question."
1979.79-116,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2053.136,2054.777,Mr. Baldwin.
1979.79-116,2,33769,kevin_jeffrey_baldwin,,2054.777,2058.117,"Mr. Chief Justice, and if it please the Court."
1979.79-116,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2209.557,2214.043,"That isn't the usual rule under the Longshoremen's Act though, is it?"
1979.79-116,2,33769,kevin_jeffrey_baldwin,,2214.043,2246.645,"Your Honor, in 1928 the Longshoremen's Act came after a rather hard line of cases, the Jensen case and then back up to 1942 where this Court, speaking through Justice Black, described these early cases as employees being caught in a twilight zone, that is pursuing a state remedy and then being unable to recover under a one-year statute."
1979.79-116,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2257.314,2265.273,But isn't there now currently an overlap between the state laws and the Longshoremen's --
1979.79-116,2,33769,kevin_jeffrey_baldwin,,2265.273,2269.198,By overlap do you mean today or do you mean when this accident happened?
1979.79-116,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2269.198,2272.4,"Well, when it happened."
1979.79-116,2,33769,kevin_jeffrey_baldwin,,2272.4,2274.43,I would say that --
1979.79-116,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2274.43,2285.893,Your argument is that getting a recovery under state law precluded a recovery under the Longshoremen's Act.
1979.79-116,2,33769,kevin_jeffrey_baldwin,,2285.893,2289.491,"There is no overlap in this case, Your Honor."
1979.79-116,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2318.184,2322.711,"Well, was this question presented to the Court of Appeals?"
1979.79-116,2,33769,kevin_jeffrey_baldwin,,2322.711,2325.437,"Yes, it was in brief, Your Honor."
1979.79-116,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2326.125,2327.421,And they didn't decide it?
1979.79-116,2,33769,kevin_jeffrey_baldwin,,2327.421,2329.705,They did not decide it.
1979.79-116,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2472.038,2478.393,And why is the full faith and credit clause involved here?
1979.79-116,2,33769,kevin_jeffrey_baldwin,,2478.393,2485.198,"It is involved, Your Honor, because we have in this --"
1979.79-116,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2485.198,2487.589,But the --
1979.79-116,2,33769,kevin_jeffrey_baldwin,,2487.589,2502.832,"-- we have the Constitution, we have an act implementing it, and that is the act of Congress gives the effect of a judgment in one state the some effect in every other state."
1979.79-116,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2502.832,2504.362,Like the District of Columbia?
1979.79-116,2,33769,kevin_jeffrey_baldwin,,2504.362,2521.955,"That is correct, Your Honor, so the rights that are -- when the parties have their rights concluded, the cause of action is merged in the first state and it is merged in every other state."
1979.79-116,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2554.203,2558.601,Now you are going to mention McCartin?
1979.79-116,2,33769,kevin_jeffrey_baldwin,,2558.601,2559.594,When am I going to?
1979.79-116,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2559.594,2561.718,"I say you are going to, are you not?"
1979.79-116,2,33769,kevin_jeffrey_baldwin,,2561.718,2565.546,"Yes, Your Honor, I intend to and let me get to --"
1979.79-116,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2565.546,2568.881,"It is the later of the two cases, and I would like to know how you --"
1979.79-116,2,33769,kevin_jeffrey_baldwin,,2568.881,2574.634,"I am familiar with both cases, your Honor."
1979.79-116,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2622.475,2631.634,But you could go back in Virginia and get an award for permanent disability?
1979.79-116,2,33769,kevin_jeffrey_baldwin,,2631.634,2634.512,"Your Honor, I am not going to mislead you."
1979.79-116,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2662.154,2663.438,The dollars are the same.
1979.79-116,2,33769,kevin_jeffrey_baldwin,,2663.438,2666.072,"Yes, it is the same --"
1979.79-116,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2666.072,2687.284,"Assume, rightly or wrongly, we agreed with your colleagues that even though the money is the same, he could have gone back -- Virginia just didn't bar going back and getting an award for permanent disability, even though there had been an award for temporary total disability."
1979.79-116,2,33769,kevin_jeffrey_baldwin,,2688.211,2690.383,I don't know why one would.
1979.79-116,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2690.383,2696.23,"I know, but suppose -- I heard that from the other side, and you heard it, too."
1979.79-116,2,33769,kevin_jeffrey_baldwin,,2696.23,2697.171,Yes.
1979.79-116,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2697.171,2700.385,And you say that is wrong.
1979.79-116,2,33769,kevin_jeffrey_baldwin,,2700.385,2703.037,"It is under subparagraph 18, Your Honor --"
1979.79-116,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2703.037,2706.849,But suppose they were right in what they said?
1979.79-116,2,33769,kevin_jeffrey_baldwin,,2706.849,2709.463,"Your Honor, they don't."
1979.79-116,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2709.463,2711.15,So you don't want to suppose?
1979.79-116,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2712.114,2731.881,"But don't you have supporting you the decision of the Court of Appeals in Pattus at 631 of deciding where they say, turning to the Virginia statute, we find it as exclusive of the second proceeding as the Chief Justice in Magnolia found the Texas law?"
1979.79-116,2,33769,kevin_jeffrey_baldwin,,2731.881,2734.753,"Yes, Your Honor."
1979.79-116,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2834.232,2840.12,"What would the consequence of an appeal of the Virginia award, if I understood you correctly --"
1979.79-116,2,33769,kevin_jeffrey_baldwin,,2840.12,2841.036,How would you do it?
1979.79-116,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2841.259,2843.996,"No, what would be the consequence of it?"
1979.79-116,2,33769,kevin_jeffrey_baldwin,,2846.265,2848.634,There is nothing to be appealed.
1979.79-116,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2848.634,2850.35,That is what I am asking you.
1979.79-116,2,33769,kevin_jeffrey_baldwin,,2851.186,2858.04,There are no facts that you can put on the bones to make an appeal.
1979.79-116,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2864.863,2871.591,"Isn't the Virginia, statute almost identical with the Illinois statute in McCartin?"
1979.79-116,2,33769,kevin_jeffrey_baldwin,,2871.591,2894.254,"Your Honor, I am not the greatest one for interpreting statutes, but the Illinois statute says -- it replaces common law and statutory law, actions against the employer."
1979.79-116,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2901.161,2901.749,I am talking about --
1979.79-116,2,33769,kevin_jeffrey_baldwin,,2901.749,2904.694,"-- is the word ""otherwise"" greater than ""statutory"" --"
1979.79-116,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2904.694,2906.044,I am talking about Illinois.
1979.79-116,2,33769,kevin_jeffrey_baldwin,,2906.621,2910.476,Illinois says common law or statutory.
1979.79-116,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2918.355,2920.766,"Does ""otherwise"" include ""statutory""?"
1979.79-116,2,33769,kevin_jeffrey_baldwin,,2920.766,2921.309,"Pardon, Your Honor?"
1979.79-116,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2921.309,2926.291,"Does ""otherwise"" include ""statutory""?"
1979.79-116,2,33769,kevin_jeffrey_baldwin,,2926.291,2929.535,"Your Honor, ""otherwise"" --"
1979.79-116,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2929.535,2930.868,"Well, let me ask you, what is the otherwise designated?"
1979.79-116,2,33769,kevin_jeffrey_baldwin,,2930.868,2934.293,"I am not interpreting the act, Your Honor."
1979.79-116,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2934.293,2940.223,You don't agree that they are similar?
1979.79-116,2,33769,kevin_jeffrey_baldwin,,2940.223,2960.858,"I would take the position of the court in the Fourth Circuit that if they think that the Virginia act is more similar to the Texas act, fine, but it is a matter of degree, Your Honor."
1979.79-116,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3141.194,3146.403,"You say ""any other common law judgment,"" this is not a common law judgment, is it?"
1979.79-116,2,33769,kevin_jeffrey_baldwin,,3147.355,3149.051,It has the same effect as a common law judgment.
1979.79-116,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3149.051,3151.185,But it precludes common law remedies.
1979.79-116,2,33769,kevin_jeffrey_baldwin,,3151.185,3169.003,"That's right, and what I am talking about is the arguments that have been made in tax cases, the wrongful death cases, the gambling cases, bigamy, child support, Winds v. North Carolina, a long line of hard decisions."
1979.79-116,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3198.375,3198.844,Very well.
