1978.78-58,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,45.296,We'll hear arguments next Brown against Felsen.
1978.78-58,0,18630,craig_a_christensen,,48.562,52.53,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1978.78-58,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,198.462,200.83,Did he file the claim?
1978.78-58,0,18630,craig_a_christensen,,200.83,202.118,"In the state court, Your Honor?"
1978.78-58,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,202.118,204.765,"No, in the bankruptcy court?"
1978.78-58,0,18630,craig_a_christensen,,204.765,209.956,"Mr. Brown, I don't believe that he had filed a claim."
1978.78-58,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,209.956,211.517,Would he have too?
1978.78-58,0,18630,craig_a_christensen,,211.517,217.009,"No, I don't believe he have to by virtue of the adversary proceeding because the court is bound there to enter judgment."
1978.78-58,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,220.223,220.434,I see.
1978.78-58,0,18630,craig_a_christensen,,220.434,222.697,-- that was eventual rights to collect it.
1978.78-58,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,222.697,226.534,"Well, if the bankrupt list him as a debtor, he's going to be included anyway?"
1978.78-58,0,18630,craig_a_christensen,,226.534,229.703,"Thus, well, he wouldn't be included in the distribution, Mr. Justice."
1978.78-58,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,229.703,230.672,Is that right?
1978.78-58,0,18630,craig_a_christensen,,230.672,233.297,He would not share in the distribution from the estate.
1978.78-58,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,247.518,250.36,And what's the jurisdiction of the court?
1978.78-58,0,18630,craig_a_christensen,,250.36,251.791,The bankruptcy court?
1978.78-58,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,261.43,269.714,"Well, the -- you say you're suggesting that however that he doesn't have to -- have been determine to be a creditor by filing a claim?"
1978.78-58,0,18630,craig_a_christensen,,269.714,270.109,No.
1978.78-58,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,286.253,289.668,"Well, it's just -- I just -- I was asking this what the jurisdiction --"
1978.78-58,0,18630,craig_a_christensen,,289.668,301.568,"Yes, it comes up but I think under 17c under U.S.C. under 1254 for review of the bankruptcy determinations."
1978.78-58,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,361.134,364.309,"Well, what if the issue had been raised in the state litigation."
1978.78-58,0,18630,craig_a_christensen,,377.998,379.17,That's correct.
1978.78-58,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,384.152,385.008,Except on facts?
1978.78-58,0,18630,craig_a_christensen,,385.678,386.358,That's right.
1978.78-58,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,402.437,405.203,It would be any such a thing as res judicata in that?
1978.78-58,0,18630,craig_a_christensen,,405.203,408.348,"Well, there would be no res judicata because the claims aren't the same."
1978.78-58,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,411.67,413.311,That's fundamental to your case up here?
1978.78-58,0,18630,craig_a_christensen,,413.311,414.577,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1978.78-58,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,414.577,429.582,"Well, we don't have to decide here any possible instances on which a bankruptcy court might in pursuing this authority given out of 70 amendments, treat factual adjudication in state court is binding on it?"
1978.78-58,0,18630,craig_a_christensen,,429.582,432.098,That I don't believe you have to reach that point.
1978.78-58,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,435.882,440.927,"Except -- except your exertion the way you made it, it is broad enough to cover those situations?"
1978.78-58,0,18630,craig_a_christensen,,440.927,444.304,That's correct.
1978.78-58,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,664.173,677.287,"I presume that the holder of a promissory note against a solvent signor of it has no particular interest in getting a judgment based on fraud, if he can simply get a judgment on the note?"
1978.78-58,0,18630,craig_a_christensen,,677.287,678.767,"Absolutely true, Your Honor."
1978.78-58,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,765.802,769.876,Would you think that Tenth Circuit would come out the same as there been no state court litigation?
1978.78-58,0,18630,craig_a_christensen,,781.519,781.75,No.
1978.78-58,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,813.522,818.397,Some of the most successful litigators specialized in default judge?
1978.78-58,0,18630,craig_a_christensen,,818.397,819.925,That is correct.
1978.78-58,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,862.732,863.514,Very well.
1978.78-58,1,16365,alex_stephen_keller,,867.971,871.717,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1978.78-58,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,963.219,978.497,"Well, I take it that did you understand counsel to say that he thought the intended the federal law the dischargeability provisions was to make sure that the fraud which barred dischargeability was the same countrywide?"
1978.78-58,1,16365,alex_stephen_keller,,979.473,979.927,"No, sir."
1978.78-58,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,983.174,985.238,That is that different?
1978.78-58,1,16365,alex_stephen_keller,,992.272,996.534,I understood counsel to say that I can't really argue against that.
1978.78-58,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,996.534,997.5,You can't?
1978.78-58,1,16365,alex_stephen_keller,,997.5,997.642,No.
1978.78-58,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,998.597,1003.681,"Well, you don't suggest that Colorado law fraud is the same as the law of fraud in every state, do you?"
1978.78-58,1,16365,alex_stephen_keller,,1003.681,1005.062,"No, I don't."
1978.78-58,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1016.694,1041.557,And why do you -- why do you agree so readily that it has to be that -- that Bankruptcy Act contemplates a national standard of fraud rather than picking up the fraud standard from the state in which the bankruptcy court is sitting or picking up the fraud standard of any state -- of the -- of any state law which might govern the country -- or the transaction?
1978.78-58,1,16365,alex_stephen_keller,,1041.557,1042.968,The reason I say that and I could --
1978.78-58,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1042.968,1052.724,The -- Mr. Justice -- that's the case that Mr. Justice Stevens announce this morning seem to think that the state law wouldn't govern it and it might the state law might be different in every state.
1978.78-58,1,16365,alex_stephen_keller,,1052.724,1056.535,"Well, I couldn't -- of course it would be entirely in error."
1978.78-58,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1057.787,1059.549,I'm sure you could buy that?
1978.78-58,1,16365,alex_stephen_keller,,1059.549,1060.516,"Oh, yes."
1978.78-58,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1075.746,1083.992,So you think that the perhaps the Bankruptcy Law did contemplate in national standard of fraud with respect to dischargeability?
1978.78-58,1,16365,alex_stephen_keller,,1083.992,1088.521,I think it contemplates a national standard in the light of good common sense.
1978.78-58,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1117.46,1120.338,And often don't need you to get their judgment?
1978.78-58,1,16365,alex_stephen_keller,,1120.338,1121.45,Right.
1978.78-58,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1181.861,1187.218,I thought the cross complaint here did refer to misrepresentation?
1978.78-58,1,16365,alex_stephen_keller,,1187.218,1187.788,"No, Your Honor."
1978.78-58,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1187.788,1188.638,It did not?
1978.78-58,1,16365,alex_stephen_keller,,1188.638,1189.907,"No, sir."
1978.78-58,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1203.595,1209.124,"Oh, you did not include -- you did not charge Mr. Felsen with misrepresentation?"
1978.78-58,1,16365,alex_stephen_keller,,1209.124,1210.002,"No, sir."
1978.78-58,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1217.17,1223.651,"Well, I thought it's just as Mr. Justice Powell did that's in the answer?"
1978.78-58,1,16365,alex_stephen_keller,,1233.301,1234.282,It's not --
1978.78-58,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1234.282,1234.339,You just stated --
1978.78-58,1,16365,alex_stephen_keller,,1234.339,1235.804,I believe it's an affirmative --
1978.78-58,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1235.804,1237.824,That he filed of the appendix?
1978.78-58,1,16365,alex_stephen_keller,,1237.824,1239.273,What?
1978.78-58,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1239.273,1242.389,That it says the other defendants that only two other defendants of the case?
1978.78-58,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1242.389,1243.249,That's right.
1978.78-58,1,16365,alex_stephen_keller,,1243.249,1245.183,That's correct.
1978.78-58,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1294.093,1300.366,But Mr. Keller is it not true that pleading fraud would not have done the guarantor any good in the state court action.
1978.78-58,1,16365,alex_stephen_keller,,1304.102,1309.001,As it -- as in the action by the banks against the guarantor would have availed him nothing?
1978.78-58,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1309.001,1309.638,I see.
1978.78-58,1,16365,alex_stephen_keller,,1309.638,1313.96,In the guarantor's cross-claim against Mark Felsen.
1978.78-58,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1337.573,1338.697,Which is unlikely?
1978.78-58,1,16365,alex_stephen_keller,,1338.697,1340.273,Unlikely.
1978.78-58,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1370.862,1385.098,"Mr. Keller, all of the cross-claim by Brown against Felsen appears at page 38 of the appendix?"
1978.78-58,1,16365,alex_stephen_keller,,1385.098,1386.418,"Yes, sir."
1978.78-58,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1386.418,1387.897,And there as I read it.
1978.78-58,1,16365,alex_stephen_keller,,1392.908,1400.278,Not a hint.
1978.78-58,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1400.278,1404.779,If there had been would your case be significantly different?
1978.78-58,1,16365,alex_stephen_keller,,1412.34,1414.486,I believe the judgment controls --
1978.78-58,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1414.486,1422.998,"So if there -- if there had been an allegation of fraud and no mention of it in the consent judgment, your argument would be the same, I take it?"
1978.78-58,1,16365,alex_stephen_keller,,1422.998,1425.684,It would be weaker but it would be essentially the same.
1978.78-58,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1425.684,1426.279,Right.
1978.78-58,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1426.279,1454.315,"Then what the Tenth Circuit is saying in effect is that, if Brown did not affirmatively cross-claim against Felsen in the state court base on fraud, the bankruptcy court cannot exercise its power under the 70 amendments to decide independently or de novo or whatever you want to call it whether or not that particular debt was obtained by fraud."
1978.78-58,1,16365,alex_stephen_keller,,1454.315,1455.335,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1978.78-58,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1473.894,1475.274,Well what issue?
1978.78-58,1,16365,alex_stephen_keller,,1477.402,1478.609,The issue of fraud.
1978.78-58,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1478.609,1494.05,"Yes, the issue will -- typically, the creditor going against the debtor or guarantor going against the personal be guaranteed if he feels the person be guaranteed is solvent, just wants a judgment."
1978.78-58,1,16365,alex_stephen_keller,,1510.789,1524.132,"When he stipulates in a judicial sense and enters into a consent judgment base entirely on contract and indemnity, entirely on that."
1978.78-58,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1525.385,1538.3,"That's on -- that's only if you can say, it's a classical res judicata is applicable and that anything that was litigated or might have been litigated as foreclose, isn't that true?"
1978.78-58,1,16365,alex_stephen_keller,,1538.3,1539.901,That is certainly one of the situations.
1978.78-58,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1543.487,1548.682,"Well, that's a rather stringent standard to apply in view of the 70 amendments, the Bankruptcy Act, don't you think?"
1978.78-58,1,16365,alex_stephen_keller,,1548.682,1555.212,"Well the 70 Amendments, do they really change the substantive law or do they simply change the procedure."
1978.78-58,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1664.654,1666.186,In a state court proceeding?
1978.78-58,1,16365,alex_stephen_keller,,1666.186,1668.52,"Yes, sir."
1978.78-58,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1700.838,1701.878,Why should there be a waiver?
1978.78-58,1,16365,alex_stephen_keller,,1713.845,1717.717,There are many reasons to raise fraud in the state court proceeding.
1978.78-58,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1717.717,1719.171,You mentioned punitive damages.
1978.78-58,1,16365,alex_stephen_keller,,1728.011,1730.623,"In our case, it's so happens that -- but let's take the case --"
1978.78-58,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1730.623,1732.623,So that's almost by hypothesis.
1978.78-58,1,16365,alex_stephen_keller,,1735.012,1736.461,"Well, they take bankruptcy after --"
1978.78-58,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1736.461,1736.612,Right.
1978.78-58,1,16365,alex_stephen_keller,,1736.612,1738.658,-- the conclusion of the state court and that's I've said that --
1978.78-58,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1738.658,1742.456,"That they were totally solvent and could pay the debt hundred cents on a dollar, why even then?"
1978.78-58,1,16365,alex_stephen_keller,,1750.234,1757.574,There are at least under Colorado law some additional benefits by being able to prove fraud.
1978.78-58,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1770.495,1773.921,That's very helpful when one of your debtors is corporation though?
1978.78-58,1,16365,alex_stephen_keller,,1773.921,1774.403,No.
1978.78-58,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1774.403,1775.723,No.
1978.78-58,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1775.723,1777.455,Mr. Keller.
1978.78-58,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1790.773,1791.446,"Yes, sir."
1978.78-58,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1791.446,1798.706,And you said I understood it that there's not a word in that with respect to the misrepresentation.
1978.78-58,1,16365,alex_stephen_keller,,1809.793,1812.393,"Well, that was the previous answer and I'm not sure --"
1978.78-58,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1812.393,1824.64,Now the previous answers on page 34 as I understand it and on page 35 in paragraph 3 under affirmative defenses as the Chief Justice read to you.
1978.78-58,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1835.157,1841.878,And also paragraph 5 on page 36.
1978.78-58,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1841.878,1843.576,As paragraph 5 is the one I read to you before.
1978.78-58,1,16365,alex_stephen_keller,,1843.576,1863.339,"Yes, and thats the one I'm referring to and that is included in the affirmative defense which uses loose language, misrepresentation and non-disclosure of material facts which is incorporated by reference in the preliminary sense on page 38."
1978.78-58,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1883.438,1883.638,Right.
1978.78-58,1,16365,alex_stephen_keller,,1891.789,1894.407,"Well I would say, yes."
1978.78-58,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1895.116,1898.305,It's incorporated by reference whatever he said in the --
1978.78-58,1,16365,alex_stephen_keller,,1898.305,1899.336,Yes.
1978.78-58,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1899.336,1900.472,-- in the answer.
1978.78-58,1,16365,alex_stephen_keller,,1902.443,1907.263,But to say that paragraph 5 on page 36 is an allegation of fraud.
1978.78-58,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1907.953,1909.528,Paragraphs 3 and 5.
1978.78-58,1,16365,alex_stephen_keller,,1909.528,1913.721,"Yes, I don't construed that way."
1978.78-58,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1929.881,1945.753,"Well how more do you need to say to in a pleading, in a pleading to make out of fraud claim than to say that this was done by misrepresentation and non-disclosure of material facts?"
1978.78-58,1,16365,alex_stephen_keller,,1945.753,1947.535,Under --
1978.78-58,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1947.535,1949.108,What rules of Colorado --
1978.78-58,1,16365,alex_stephen_keller,,1949.108,1952.615,It's Rule 9 (b) of the Colorado rules of civil procedures --
1978.78-58,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1952.615,1953.863,Is it in here anywhere?
1978.78-58,1,16365,alex_stephen_keller,,1953.863,1954.304,"Yes, sir."
1978.78-58,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2020.023,2022.728,Mr. Christensen.
1978.78-58,2,18630,craig_a_christensen,,2022.728,2027.43,Very briefly Your Honor.
1978.78-58,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2083.862,2093.069,Maybe -- maybe so that the he had to go to the court but the question is what are the ingredients of that decision --
1978.78-58,2,18630,craig_a_christensen,,2093.069,2094.646,That -- that is correct Mr. Justice White.
1978.78-58,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2094.646,2103.162,And you seem to concede yourself that if the whole case turn on the fact that had been determining against the creditor in the state proceeding.
1978.78-58,2,18630,craig_a_christensen,,2108.217,2112.533,If the issue had been determined against the debtor?
1978.78-58,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2112.533,2115.833,If -- if it had been determined against the creditor.
1978.78-58,2,18630,craig_a_christensen,,2117.743,2118.171,Yes.
1978.78-58,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2118.171,2121.713,-- determined against the creditor whose claiming nondischargeability.
1978.78-58,2,18630,craig_a_christensen,,2124.559,2125.002,No.
1978.78-58,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2128.48,2132.253,And did you know eventhough -- eventhough it was exercising exclusive jurisdiction.
1978.78-58,2,18630,craig_a_christensen,,2132.253,2132.958,That's correct.
1978.78-58,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2139.268,2145.858,"Well, counsel it is just suggesting that that's the case here."
1978.78-58,2,18630,craig_a_christensen,,2157.016,2158.939,I understand that contention.
1978.78-58,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2199.786,2205.276,What if the -- what if the creditors sues in the state court for fraud?
1978.78-58,2,18630,craig_a_christensen,,2205.276,2206.733,And if it's actually litigated --
1978.78-58,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2206.733,2206.908,Well --
1978.78-58,2,18630,craig_a_christensen,,2206.908,2208.387,-- I think those facts are binding.
1978.78-58,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2209.524,2211.559,"Yes, but let me suggest to you."
1978.78-58,2,18630,craig_a_christensen,,2218.567,2219.452,Yes.
1978.78-58,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2221.048,2223.608,Then what if he said -- and what if there's no asset?
1978.78-58,2,18630,craig_a_christensen,,2227.894,2229.46,"Well, the --"
1978.78-58,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2229.46,2233.89,Would the bankruptcy court re-determine the legal question of fraud?
1978.78-58,2,18630,craig_a_christensen,,2233.89,2237.306,I think that the -- if it actually been litigated.
1978.78-58,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2239.424,2240.493,The law -- the law questions --
1978.78-58,2,18630,craig_a_christensen,,2240.493,2242.736,-- don't reach the standards of Section 17.
1978.78-58,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2242.736,2245.459,So you say it works both ways?
1978.78-58,2,18630,craig_a_christensen,,2245.459,2245.601,Yes.
1978.78-58,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2245.601,2246.115,What place?
1978.78-58,2,18630,craig_a_christensen,,2253.282,2253.972,Not the legal test.
1978.78-58,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2258.119,2258.754,"Yes, right."
1978.78-58,2,18630,craig_a_christensen,,2258.754,2268.436,That fact would be binding but the state court determination of fraud under its states standards of pleading requirements would not bind the federal court's determination of federal law for dischargeability.
1978.78-58,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2268.436,2272.483,I have -- has it been and there been a lot of cases on this?
1978.78-58,2,18630,craig_a_christensen,,2272.483,2275.079,I believe that there had been five since the 1970 --
1978.78-58,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2275.079,2275.284,And that --
1978.78-58,2,18630,craig_a_christensen,,2275.284,2277.412,-- amendments that have reach the circuits.
1978.78-58,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2277.412,2282.474,And the what's the -- is there some general view about whether there's a national standards and --
1978.78-58,2,18630,craig_a_christensen,,2282.474,2292.771,I believe that three -- four of the five circuits to reach the question have allowed the bankruptcy court to consider it the matter again with extrinsic evidence.
1978.78-58,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2292.771,2294.161,What about the standard --
1978.78-58,2,18630,craig_a_christensen,,2294.161,2296.292,The standard applied --
1978.78-58,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2296.292,2297.489,Is it a national standard?
1978.78-58,2,18630,craig_a_christensen,,2297.489,2299.955,I don't know that either courts have ever addressed that question.
1978.78-58,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2328.712,2330.723,That's -- that's close to this --
1978.78-58,2,18630,craig_a_christensen,,2330.723,2331.051,I think it's suppose --
1978.78-58,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2331.051,2332.284,As close to the example I gave.
1978.78-58,2,18630,craig_a_christensen,,2332.284,2332.592,Yes.
1978.78-58,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2333.687,2333.745,What about --
1978.78-58,2,18630,craig_a_christensen,,2333.745,2334.256,-- that I can think of?
1978.78-58,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2334.256,2335.933,What about - what about you said four of the five.
1978.78-58,2,18630,craig_a_christensen,,2337.537,2338.9,The fifth is the Tenth Circuit.
1978.78-58,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2339.708,2340.225,"Oh, I see."
1978.78-58,2,18630,craig_a_christensen,,2340.225,2344.074,So it is contrary.
1978.78-58,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2344.074,2352.285,You haven't specifically back up to this Rule 9 (b)?
1978.78-58,2,18630,craig_a_christensen,,2356.59,2358.881,The Colorado rule of procedure.
1978.78-58,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2415.341,2415.938,Why?
1978.78-58,2,18630,craig_a_christensen,,2417.085,2422.375,Because I think the fresh start provisions are probably the most essential ingredient to bankrupt.
1978.78-58,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2432.42,2434.336,"Oh, it did before 1970, didn't it?"
1978.78-58,2,18630,craig_a_christensen,,2434.336,2435.264,Absolutely.
1978.78-58,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2435.264,2441.79,"Well and certainly, you concede if a issue of fraud had been fully litigated that there would be a collateral estoppel of thing?"
1978.78-58,2,18630,craig_a_christensen,,2441.79,2442.902,Would be bind in fact --
1978.78-58,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2442.902,2444.169,Only -- only the facts?
1978.78-58,2,18630,craig_a_christensen,,2444.169,2444.869,That was correct.
1978.78-58,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2451.813,2460.836,You would think -- you would say the state decision could have they -- could have concluded there was fraud under state law and the federal court could decide.
1978.78-58,2,18630,craig_a_christensen,,2466.401,2469.247,That's correct because the legal standards may be different.
1978.78-58,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2469.247,2474.423,But it would have to be on the basis of a different legal standard not on the over turning of the factual determination?
1978.78-58,2,18630,craig_a_christensen,,2474.423,2475.234,I think that's correct.
1978.78-58,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2522.359,2531.676,You don't -- I take it you don't -- you think there's anything specific in the legislative history of that?
1978.78-58,2,18630,craig_a_christensen,,2531.676,2535.008,"It is cited in the brief, Mr. Justice White, the legislative history."
1978.78-58,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2535.008,2535.433,Yes.
1978.78-58,2,18630,craig_a_christensen,,2539.164,2539.76,I'm sorry?
1978.78-58,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2540.11,2543.952,Is there something that reads right on it out of the legislative history?
1978.78-58,2,18630,craig_a_christensen,,2543.952,2549.988,I think that in the brief at page 7.
1978.78-58,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2549.988,2550.695,Page 7 then --
1978.78-58,2,18630,craig_a_christensen,,2550.695,2556.552,It talks -- it talks about exclusive jurisdiction at the very top where we cite the Senate House reports.
1978.78-58,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2556.552,2559.564,"That -- that doesn't get you very far along the line, is it?"
1978.78-58,2,18630,craig_a_christensen,,2559.564,2563.78,"With respect to the federal as oppose to state standard, no."
1978.78-58,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2568.357,2573.045,Or it doesn't help you one way or another with respect to collateral estoppel?
1978.78-58,2,18630,craig_a_christensen,,2573.045,2587.787,"Well, I think it does because I think not a collateral estoppel but a res judicata, I don't believe that that is finding if the first court had not subject matter jurisdiction and if Congress intended and did in fact as they state put an exclusive subject matter jurisdiction in the bankruptcy court."
1978.78-58,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2601.463,2603.628,That's a post-bankruptcy determination.
1978.78-58,2,18630,craig_a_christensen,,2603.628,2605.211,That's correct.
1978.78-58,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2616.984,2617.673,Thank you gentlemen.
