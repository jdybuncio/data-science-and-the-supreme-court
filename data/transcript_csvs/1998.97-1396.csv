1998.97-1396,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.254,"We'll hear argument now in Number 97-1396, Vicky Lopez v. Monterey County."
1998.97-1396,0,28788,joaquin_g_avila,,9.789,16.443,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1998.97-1396,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,41.743,53.718,"Well, but if it's a fair reading of the statute it has weight in its own right, doesn't it, even if it might be contrary to some earlier decisions of this Court."
1998.97-1396,0,28788,joaquin_g_avila,,53.718,54.618,"Yes, it would."
1998.97-1396,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,123.981,139.923,"Well, the courtesy legislation point, I mean, I guess you have to acknowledge that a covered county can do some nasty things which it hasn't tried to do before by getting the State to acknowledge State-wide legislation."
1998.97-1396,0,28788,joaquin_g_avila,,141.19,142.025,That's correct.
1998.97-1396,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,161.004,168.259,"If you appeal the plain language, what do you do when the State adopts a general provision of legislation?"
1998.97-1396,0,28788,joaquin_g_avila,,181.083,187.221,If... the focus is on the voting changes that occur within the covered jurisdiction.
1998.97-1396,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,199.795,201.231,Why wouldn't--
1998.97-1396,0,28788,joaquin_g_avila,,207.735,231.933,"The plain language of section 5 would suggest that either a covered State or a political subdivision, but, however, the responsibility, the primary responsibility would be on Monterey County to make sure that it submits any voting change, irrespective of its source, when it effectuates a voting change in that covered county."
1998.97-1396,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,231.933,232.35,I'm not sure I understand you.
1998.97-1396,0,28788,joaquin_g_avila,,236.737,245.093,"Yes, it is, and the seeks to administer refers, in fact, to the act of administering, not, as the State argues, to an administrative act."
1998.97-1396,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,249.878,251.663,Suppose the State has not... pardon me.
1998.97-1396,0,28788,joaquin_g_avila,,284.318,289.103,"That interpretation, seeks to administer means seeking to implement."
1998.97-1396,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,291.838,293.173,"Well, it's not seeking to do anything."
1998.97-1396,0,28788,joaquin_g_avila,,296.358,299.06,--It is implementing a voting change.
1998.97-1396,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,299.06,305.314,"But it's not seeking to in the sense of wanting to, of asking to."
1998.97-1396,0,28788,joaquin_g_avila,,307.833,328.58,"Well, even if it obeys a command from the State, when it effectuates voting change within that covered jurisdiction it has to be submitted for section 5 preclearance, otherwise you're going to create huge exemptions, especially in States that have... that include covered section 5 counties, like North Carolina."
1998.97-1396,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,328.58,335.417,"You say a huge exemption, but it's perfectly arguable from the language that that's what Congress intended."
1998.97-1396,0,28788,joaquin_g_avila,,335.417,339.019,It is a re... it is one interpretation.
1998.97-1396,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,374.208,388.785,"Well, but isn't there an argument on the other side, that here we deal with national and State relations, and that since this does impinge on them, it should probably not get a terribly sweeping interpretation."
1998.97-1396,0,28788,joaquin_g_avila,,394.622,413.083,"--Yes, but that balance, that balance between... that delicate balance that was struck by Congress back in 1965 between a State's sovereignty and the Federal interest in eliminating the blight of voting discrimination, that was struck in 1965, and it's been reratified, or ratified three times."
1998.97-1396,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,413.083,419.506,"Precisely, so let's look at the language and not some cry for a very broad interpretation of it."
1998.97-1396,0,28788,joaquin_g_avila,,419.506,422.958,It is not a cry for a very broad interpretation.
1998.97-1396,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,540.868,562.466,"Well, one of your arguments is the... what... the risk of what you refer to as the courtesy legislation, that in fact if State law itself is a means to avoid section 5, the usual State capitol log-rolling will simply mean that the counties will get the legislature to enact what they want."
1998.97-1396,0,28788,joaquin_g_avila,,592.151,598.389,"Yes, because in fact the State of California has a choice here in enacting State legislation."
1998.97-1396,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,1018.546,1028.002,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1998.97-1396,2,21569,daniel_g_stone,,1612.345,1621.051,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1998.97-1396,3,28788,joaquin_g_avila,,3373.283,3376.485,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
