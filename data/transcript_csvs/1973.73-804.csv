1973.73-804,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,39.82,"We’ll hear arguments next in 73-804, Baker against Gold Seal Liquors."
1973.73-804,0,37832,paul_r_duke,,42.312,46.169,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1973.73-804,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,240.875,241.89,That was a net judgment?
1973.73-804,0,37832,paul_r_duke,,241.89,243.731,"You’re right, Your Honor, that’s the trouble."
1973.73-804,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,313.287,317.01,What do you concede to be property of the debtor that was here involved?
1973.73-804,0,37832,paul_r_duke,,317.01,322.817,"This shows as an action, Your Honor, for freight charges which came into their possession on June 21, 1970."
1973.73-804,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,336.168,336.819,Oh!
1973.73-804,0,37832,paul_r_duke,,345.247,356.563,"Well, if Your Honor please in re Roman it was a straight bankruptcy case where there is no right of set off and I think Judge Friendly’s discussion in Lehigh and Hudson River distinguished it."
1973.73-804,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,373.138,378.593,But what’s they’re talking about there is that what is the property of the bankrupt?
1973.73-804,0,37832,paul_r_duke,,378.593,379.64,That’s right.
1973.73-804,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,379.64,386.192,And I would think the -- whether when the particular amount occurred wouldn’t have too much role than so far as there definition is concerned?
1973.73-804,0,37832,paul_r_duke,,386.192,400.619,"Well, I think it will not Your Honor to the extent that it goes to the issue of whether or not, if you have effectuated to set off to prior to the entry of the order boring set offs, you may have raised to substantial adverse claim to the property and I say that’s the essential holding of Lehigh and Hudson River."
1973.73-804,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,400.619,405.554,But that deals with the summary of jurisdiction in the bankruptcy court rather than a plenary action?
1973.73-804,0,37832,paul_r_duke,,405.554,406.755,That’s right.
1973.73-804,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,423.931,436.606,"Well, do you think the bankruptcy court has the authority to tell the trustees that you can go into any District Court in the country and sue and I am going to immunize you against the normal consequences of litigation in that Court?"
1973.73-804,0,37832,paul_r_duke,,436.606,457.401,"No, I think -- well, the normal consequences of litigation Your Honor, I say, do not mean under 77 that the trustees have to risk their property, risk that a Illinios District Court will order the payment of these claims by netting out this judgment simply because they go to collect their property."
1973.73-804,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,457.401,465.866,Mr. Duke the damage claims under the transportation charges all arose out of different shipment --
1973.73-804,0,37832,paul_r_duke,,465.866,467.218,"That’s correct, Your Honor."
1973.73-804,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,467.218,475.289,"Would it make any difference if there was one damage claim and one transportation charge, and was out of the same shipper?"
1973.73-804,0,37832,paul_r_duke,,475.289,477.207,"Your Honor, that’s a tougher question obviously."
1973.73-804,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,539.308,543.634,"Well, then you’ve got two completely different points there."
1973.73-804,0,37832,paul_r_duke,,562.792,564.032,"No, it was not liquidated, it was --"
1973.73-804,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,564.032,569.242,"So, it would have had to sue just like it did here, the trustee in an appropriate court?"
1973.73-804,0,37832,paul_r_duke,,569.242,569.79,"That’s right, Your Honor."
1973.73-804,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,569.79,576.793,"But once, it was establish, the only way that it collect its claim would be to file it."
1973.73-804,0,37832,paul_r_duke,,580.13,580.387,"That’s correct, Your Honor."
1973.73-804,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,580.387,589.334,"And that’s what underlies the rule against set offs, but in ordinary bankruptcy, Section 68 expressed that permits set offs?"
1973.73-804,0,37832,paul_r_duke,,589.334,590.207,That’s correct Your Honor.
1973.73-804,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,590.207,597.025,"But in reorganization as I understand it, it’s been held that that 68 is not necessarily controlling?"
1973.73-804,0,37832,paul_r_duke,,597.025,600.352,And it is a matter for the discretion of the court supervising --
1973.73-804,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,600.352,603.288,"And wherever set off is allowed, it does effect to preference?"
1973.73-804,0,37832,paul_r_duke,,603.288,605.826,"That’s correct, Your Honor."
1973.73-804,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,605.826,620.024,"Yeah but the other point is then not only the collect of the -- whether -- well, you’ve answered my one question as to whether the other court had jurisdiction to give judgment to the claimant and you say it did?"
1973.73-804,0,37832,paul_r_duke,,620.024,622.828,We did not contest the jurisdiction to litigate the claims on the lower court.
1973.73-804,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,622.828,630.111,"So, it’s really the remaining point as to whether that claim may be satisfied out of a claim of the trustee?"
1973.73-804,0,37832,paul_r_duke,,630.111,631.106,"That’s right, Your Honor."
1973.73-804,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,649.066,652.237,Yet there were concededly happened in straight bankruptcy?
1973.73-804,0,37832,paul_r_duke,,652.237,654.152,"Oh, no question about it Your Honor."
1973.73-804,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,660.517,666.738,"Well, your policy against preferences is just as strong in straight bankruptcy as it in reorganizations, isn’t it?"
1973.73-804,0,37832,paul_r_duke,,666.738,673.137,Except Your Honor that Congress has in effect granted that preference to Section 68.
1973.73-804,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,747.165,749.734,How is it -- the decision been appealed at all?
1973.73-804,0,37832,paul_r_duke,,749.734,754.892,"Your Honor, as far as I know, it has not yet although there have been indications that it will be."
1973.73-804,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,756.095,758.29,May I ask you a question first?
1973.73-804,0,37832,paul_r_duke,,758.29,759.274,"Yes, Your Honor."
1973.73-804,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,759.274,765.714,"What is the relevance, if any of Sections 31 and 67 the Interstate Commerce Act?"
1973.73-804,0,37832,paul_r_duke,,765.714,770.853,"That established Your Honor, the jurisdiction to bring our action."
1973.73-804,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,803.256,804.746,That’s a non-judicial netting?
1973.73-804,0,37832,paul_r_duke,,804.746,835.689,Because the requirement of Section 67 Your Honor that freight charges be paid in cash and that all shippers pay in the same form prevented any -- and the general policy of the Act against secret rebates and secret arrangements prevented the shipper from -- any railroad from agreeing off the record or outside the confines of a judicial proceeding that they would net out their freight charges in loss and damage claims.
1973.73-804,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,835.689,843.615,But this case is different because you don’t have a netting out but the party who has a claim against the railroad?
1973.73-804,0,37832,paul_r_duke,,843.615,846.539,"That’s right Your Honor, and it did not occur pre-reorganization."
1973.73-804,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,866.476,868.944,Mr. Herst.
1973.73-804,1,42776,theodore_j_herst,,868.944,873.306,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1973.73-804,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,968.302,970.294,Why didn’t you file a claim in the Reorganization Court?
1973.73-804,1,42776,theodore_j_herst,,970.294,981.56,"Well, we didn’t file a claim in the reorganization, Your Honor because we saw the lawsuit coming and because frankly, we were concerned as to what the effect of participating in Philadelphia would be."
1973.73-804,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,981.56,988.119,Do you think it would -- that they just note the claim or was it --
1973.73-804,1,42776,theodore_j_herst,,988.119,997.147,"Your Honor, what they did is they sent a notice if we look at the genesis of the lawsuit, the suit was filed in the end of 1970."
1973.73-804,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1034.377,1040.261,"So, it was a -- so in effect it was -- it really was an admitted liquidated amount?"
1973.73-804,1,42776,theodore_j_herst,,1040.261,1042.215,"No, it was not Your Honor."
1973.73-804,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1044.233,1051.884,"My question is, do you think that that was subject to the filing of the proof of claim without a judgment?"
1973.73-804,1,42776,theodore_j_herst,,1053.83,1055.684,I see what you mean Mr. Justice White.
1973.73-804,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1055.684,1062.255,I asked your colleague whether or not this was fileable as a claim in the Bankruptcy Court without further liquidation.
1973.73-804,1,42776,theodore_j_herst,,1073.268,1074.343,In that amount.
1973.73-804,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1074.343,1076.955,But if that isn’t true then it wasn’t liquidated?
1973.73-804,1,42776,theodore_j_herst,,1076.955,1078.13,That is correct.
1973.73-804,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1092.616,1094.013,"Amount is $18,000.00?"
1973.73-804,1,42776,theodore_j_herst,,1094.013,1094.28,"Yes, Your Honor."
1973.73-804,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1094.28,1095.609,The original amount was higher?
1973.73-804,1,42776,theodore_j_herst,,1095.609,1102.247,"Yes, Mr. Justice Stewart we completely -- actually claimed close to $20,000.00, $19,000.00 in some figure."
1973.73-804,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1102.247,1109.446,"And that that you just had in your hand and read to us was notice that you, your client got --"
1973.73-804,1,42776,theodore_j_herst,,1109.446,1110.286,Yes.
1973.73-804,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1110.286,1112.807,-- from the debtor and reorganization?
1973.73-804,1,42776,theodore_j_herst,,1112.807,1114.055,From the trustees.
1973.73-804,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1114.055,1119.785,"Yes, from the trustees, saying -- it went to say that we acknowledge the existence of a --"
1973.73-804,1,42776,theodore_j_herst,,1119.785,1137.059,"No, they say it does not constitute an admission, but they simply state to notify us that the attached described claims and it’s actually their statement of account have been presented by us, have been presented by you to the debtor because we’ve made the claims under the --"
1973.73-804,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1137.059,1138.921,You've made the claim prior to reorganization?
1973.73-804,1,42776,theodore_j_herst,,1138.921,1144.708,"Prior to reorganization under the Interstate Commerce Act a claim on the Bill of Lading, Mr. Justice White."
1973.73-804,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1144.708,1145.928,I see.
1973.73-804,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1145.928,1148.954,But then they see you’ll need not file a claim.
1973.73-804,1,42776,theodore_j_herst,,1154.656,1155.924,"Yes, I would suggest --"
1973.73-804,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1155.924,1157.655,Without of filing of the claim.
1973.73-804,1,42776,theodore_j_herst,,1161.44,1165.538,"In that amount, I suppose that is the only way you could regard it."
1973.73-804,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1166.977,1171.036,But it’s not liquidated and I mean the amount is not agreed upon or was not at that time?
1973.73-804,1,42776,theodore_j_herst,,1171.036,1171.941,It was not agreed.
1973.73-804,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1171.941,1175.959,"Well, I take it, if that’s all you wanted to claim; you would not need the file claim."
1973.73-804,1,42776,theodore_j_herst,,1175.959,1184.538,"I suppose if we would walk away Mr. Justice Stewart, I mean there are a lot of ifs Mr. Justice White, in response to Mr. Justice Stewart’s question."
1973.73-804,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1200.873,1202.633,"Alright, thank you."
1973.73-804,1,42776,theodore_j_herst,,1202.633,1205.742,"Secondly, we believe continuing --"
1973.73-804,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1205.742,1208.3,When will you have to take your first step?
1973.73-804,1,42776,theodore_j_herst,,1208.3,1208.777,Sir?
1973.73-804,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1208.777,1212.967,"When will you have to take your first step, with respect to your claim?"
1973.73-804,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1212.967,1213.776,You would not.
1973.73-804,1,42776,theodore_j_herst,,1216.483,1217.156,That is correct.
1973.73-804,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1229.666,1234.155,So your first would be after that lawsuit has begun against you?
1973.73-804,1,42776,theodore_j_herst,,1234.155,1244.714,"Right, whatever the results would be of the lawsuit would in effect be our claim and therefore our claim in effect by the lawsuit has been reduced to $11,000.00."
1973.73-804,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1268.751,1270.424,Where is it in the appendix?
1973.73-804,1,42776,theodore_j_herst,,1270.424,1280.153,"Your Honor, that order is found in the appendix at page A22 and following."
1973.73-804,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1354.753,1356.772,But Lowden itself was that kind of a case?
1973.73-804,1,42776,theodore_j_herst,,1356.772,1361.024,"Exactly, Lowden was a loose case."
1973.73-804,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1370.695,1374.92,And there the bank in Minnesota had on its own initiative set off against the --
1973.73-804,1,42776,theodore_j_herst,,1374.92,1376.292,"Yes, Your Honor."
1973.73-804,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1733.184,1733.938,Thank you Mr. Herst.
1973.73-804,2,37832,paul_r_duke,,1735.664,1740.91,"One or two things Your Honor, and of course a number of suits is not of record."
1973.73-804,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1781.4,1784.107,Not even filed in the Reorganization Court?
1973.73-804,2,37832,paul_r_duke,,1784.107,1792.332,"Your Honor, the procedure to which Mr. Herst, the notice which he received was a notice prescribed by Judge Fullam pursuant to Order 164."
1973.73-804,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1818.949,1826.355,"But you get them account sometimes when he is auditing in your potential claimant, you just want to verify really the --"
1973.73-804,2,37832,paul_r_duke,,1826.355,1826.924,That’s right.
1973.73-804,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1843.777,1856.275,But you also have said if you don’t object to this amount we need to file a claim as far as bankruptcy for amendment you wouldn’t take that amount into consideration conforming?
1973.73-804,2,37832,paul_r_duke,,1856.275,1858.56,"The amount that we have approved, Your Honor."
1973.73-804,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1865.781,1870.351,"You don’t have to break that time making explain, if you didn’t to provide after having said that?"
1973.73-804,2,37832,paul_r_duke,,1870.351,1871.239,"Oh, We have to."
1973.73-804,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1886.7,1888.606,"Very well, the case is submitted."
