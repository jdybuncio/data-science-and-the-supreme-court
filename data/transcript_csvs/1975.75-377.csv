1975.75-377,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,55.0,"We will hear arguments next in 75-377, Ludwig against Massachusetts."
1975.75-377,0,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,56.298,61.537,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1975.75-377,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,209.011,219.209,"At that point at the first tier, there were conviction and the sentence of imprisonment imposed and then a man took an appeal, does he go to prison?"
1975.75-377,0,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,219.209,219.867,"No, he does not."
1975.75-377,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,250.156,254.665,The judgment does not exist anymore?
1975.75-377,0,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,254.665,263.533,But his revocation exists of his license and that is an effect and that is penalty that is being imposed because he is convicted of a criminal offense.
1975.75-377,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,265.989,275.445,"If he has not been convicted, if you set aside, whatever the jury may be, the Law of Massachusetts says that even after it is set aside, his license is revoked."
1975.75-377,0,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,275.624,282.981,"That is quite correct and because it arises out of a criminal offense, it is not a civil sanction."
1975.75-377,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,295.591,306.979,"Whereas the law of Massachusetts is that a conviction in the District Court, even after it is set aside in a driving case of this kind, has the collateral consequence of depriving a person of his driver’s license?"
1975.75-377,0,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,306.979,307.81,That is correct.
1975.75-377,1,31089,john_j_irwin_jr,,1462.976,1468.275,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1975.75-377,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1728.179,1739.968,"And you say the reason this is not properly an appeal is because the challenge is not to the Massachusetts statute, but to the custom and practice followed in the Massachusetts Court System?"
1975.75-377,1,31089,john_j_irwin_jr,,1739.968,1745.261,"Yes, that is the primary reason that I assert Mr. Justice Rehnquist."
1975.75-377,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1755.614,1763.981,"But it is well settled Massachusetts Law as a matter of judicial construction of the statute, is it not?"
1975.75-377,1,31089,john_j_irwin_jr,,1763.981,1765.197,"Yes, it is Mr. Justice Stewart."
1975.75-377,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1765.197,1775.255,"Well, that is what the statute means because that is what the Massachusetts Courts have said that means, would that follow?"
1975.75-377,1,31089,john_j_irwin_jr,,1775.255,1777.464,I would suggest that does follow.
1975.75-377,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1794.13,1804.411,It is not up to us to construe the statute that has been done for us by the Massachusetts Court which had made it clear that there is no right to a jury trial at the first tier.
1975.75-377,1,31089,john_j_irwin_jr,,1804.411,1805.57,That is right.
1975.75-377,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1805.57,1816.03,"It this not the reason that they made it clear is not because of any provision of the statute, but because of their own ruling as to the right of jury trial in Massachusetts Trial Court?"
1975.75-377,1,31089,john_j_irwin_jr,,1816.03,1820.338,That is exactly right Mr. Justice Rehnquist.
1975.75-377,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2007.218,2009.631,Is there a Superior Court in every county in Massachusetts?
1975.75-377,1,31089,john_j_irwin_jr,,2009.631,2011.542,"Yes, there is Mr. Justice Stewart."
1975.75-377,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2017.223,2018.399,Being multi-judge?
1975.75-377,1,31089,john_j_irwin_jr,,2018.399,2018.787,Some of them --
1975.75-377,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2018.787,2019.991,Some being maybe a single-judge?
1975.75-377,1,31089,john_j_irwin_jr,,2019.991,2020.801,That is right.
1975.75-377,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2186.322,2191.012,"So functionally, that is not unlike just the binding over proceeding, is that what you are --?"
1975.75-377,1,31089,john_j_irwin_jr,,2191.012,2192.965,That is right Mr. Justice Stewart.
1975.75-377,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2192.965,2201.664,"Alright and is that practice availed of when its clear that the defendant has to go to the Superior Court, it is done only then?"
1975.75-377,1,31089,john_j_irwin_jr,,2201.664,2203.26,"Yes, it is."
1975.75-377,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2221.794,2231.377,It is almost by agreement that tradition is evolved that this has been converted into a traditional binding over?
1975.75-377,1,31089,john_j_irwin_jr,,2231.377,2233.594,"That is right Mr. Justice, yes it is."
1975.75-377,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2233.594,2238.05,Except of course on his record is this conviction that is now been set aside --
1975.75-377,1,31089,john_j_irwin_jr,,2238.05,2238.734,That is right.
1975.75-377,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2238.734,2250.129,"-- which your brother told us might have, in a vehicle case might have the collateral consequence of the deprivation of the defendants driving license for a period?"
1975.75-377,1,31089,john_j_irwin_jr,,2250.129,2252.506,"Yes, it might."
1975.75-377,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2252.506,2259.469,Is the motion to appeal need made substantially simultaneously with the entry to plead guilty?
1975.75-377,1,31089,john_j_irwin_jr,,2259.469,2260.565,"Yes, it is Your Honor."
1975.75-377,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2260.565,2263.041,So all of this can happen in a matter of 15 minutes?
1975.75-377,1,31089,john_j_irwin_jr,,2263.041,2267.02,It could happen in a matter of 10 minutes if you Your Honor please and many times it does.
1975.75-377,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2267.02,2275.895,"So in effect you stipulate to probable cause, guilty, a judgment of conviction --"
1975.75-377,1,31089,john_j_irwin_jr,,2275.895,2276.681,Right.
1975.75-377,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2276.681,2280.245,"You say, I appeal and the judgment is (Inaudible)?"
1975.75-377,1,31089,john_j_irwin_jr,,2280.245,2292.887,"That is correct, Your Honor and his appeal is entered and I think when we are talking about appeal, my conviction is or the Commonwealth's conviction is that that is not very well denominated."
1975.75-377,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2316.407,2321.248,He does not even need to report to a larger error in the first trial in order to go to (Inaudible)?
1975.75-377,1,31089,john_j_irwin_jr,,2321.248,2323.875,He does not Mr. Justice Stewart.
1975.75-377,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2323.875,2326.996,Are there any costs imposed as a result of first trial?
1975.75-377,1,31089,john_j_irwin_jr,,2326.996,2330.132,They are not Mr. Justice Stevens.
1975.75-377,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2330.132,2332.457,What is the purpose of the first trial?
1975.75-377,1,31089,john_j_irwin_jr,,2332.457,2333.035,I am sorry.
1975.75-377,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2333.035,2337.766,What is the purpose it serves -- what interest does the Commonwealth have in having the first trial?
1975.75-377,1,31089,john_j_irwin_jr,,2337.766,2356.604,"I would suggest that the Commonwealth has this interest that there is before the Court in the record here and in the briefs an indication that the Massachusetts District Court system as we know it, handles approximately one million criminal matters a year."
1975.75-377,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2373.059,2376.101,By way of it guilty and a minor punishment that --
1975.75-377,1,31089,john_j_irwin_jr,,2376.101,2378.135,"Exactly, that would be acceptable to the defendant."
1975.75-377,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2378.135,2379.992,(Voice Overlap) case and there is no reason to appeal?
1975.75-377,1,31089,john_j_irwin_jr,,2379.992,2380.797,Exactly.
1975.75-377,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2380.797,2390.909,"What about – the Court of Appeals would say, well, since you are going to appeal and you are going to a jury trial, you do not have to go through this over."
1975.75-377,1,31089,john_j_irwin_jr,,2402.267,2414.795,"Well, in this situation that you posited Mr. Justice Marshall, I would say the state really has no benefit if what you are suggesting is the situation that I think you are that where they know he is going to appeal."
1975.75-377,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2414.795,2416.923,I am suggesting the situation you said.
1975.75-377,1,31089,john_j_irwin_jr,,2436.313,2458.868,"Well, in the situation that you just posited Mr. Justice Marshall, the Court, the District Court in question, given the situation that you just posted, in my judgment would do nothing more than satisfy itself that there is probable cause for the existence of that complaint and to a finding of guilty and say, leave and go have your appeal because it is the expeditious way to handle the matter in my judgment."
1975.75-377,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2458.868,2462.677,That is the way because you just transferred to the other Court?
1975.75-377,1,31089,john_j_irwin_jr,,2462.677,2466.558,"Well, that is in effect what they are doing."
1975.75-377,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2466.558,2471.908,"The legislature has to do it by this particular mechanism except for the judge has no option, does it?"
1975.75-377,1,31089,john_j_irwin_jr,,2471.908,2473.968,The judge has no option.
1975.75-377,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2473.968,2476.135,He may not just accept the plea of guilty?
1975.75-377,1,31089,john_j_irwin_jr,,2476.135,2478.951,He may accept the plea of guilty.
1975.75-377,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2478.951,2481.347,Without any evidence?
1975.75-377,1,31089,john_j_irwin_jr,,2481.347,2488.691,"Well no, I think what he would do Mr. Justice White if a plea of guilty was entered in the District Court where he had final jurisdiction."
1975.75-377,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2488.691,2490.109,Can he appeal for a plea of guilty?
1975.75-377,1,31089,john_j_irwin_jr,,2490.109,2496.169,"Yes, he can, but the only thing that is open to him on a an appeal from a plea of guilty is the disposition of the case, the sentencing."
1975.75-377,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2496.169,2500.203,So that he may not have a jury trial if he pleads guilty?
1975.75-377,1,31089,john_j_irwin_jr,,2500.203,2502.394,He may not.
1975.75-377,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2502.394,2516.497,"This hypothetical we have done putting to you about his standing aside in order to get a jury trial do not fit this case, do they, because he did not want a jury trial in the second tier?"
1975.75-377,1,31089,john_j_irwin_jr,,2516.497,2517.048,That is right.
1975.75-377,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2535.501,2548.754,You said normally the purpose in most cases of bypassing or standing mute at the first tier trial is in order to get a jury?
1975.75-377,1,31089,john_j_irwin_jr,,2548.754,2549.9,Exactly.
1975.75-377,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2549.9,2551.887,But that is not the objective in this case?
1975.75-377,1,31089,john_j_irwin_jr,,2551.887,2554.363,Apparently it was not.
1975.75-377,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2554.363,2569.856,"Mr. Irwin, you sister state of Rhode Island I think has a very similar not almost identical statutory system which I understand has been declared to be invalid."
1975.75-377,1,31089,john_j_irwin_jr,,2578.389,2579.671,"No, I think your are correct, Your Honor."
1975.75-377,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2579.671,2583.002,And how does Rhode Island go about it now?
1975.75-377,1,31089,john_j_irwin_jr,,2583.002,2598.409,"I am not sure if Your Honor please how Rhode Island goes about it except that apparently my understanding is that what they do now is offer a jury trial in the first instance at the District Court level, allow the defendant to assert his right to jury trial and set it out for a jury trial."
1975.75-377,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2604.214,2610.22,(Inaudible) without an amendment to your statute?
1975.75-377,1,31089,john_j_irwin_jr,,2610.22,2620.367,I would say Massachusetts I suppose could advance a Court rule by Rule of Court or probably without legislative change do exactly that if Your Honor please.
1975.75-377,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2626.354,2632.191,As for Mr. Chief Justice's question you said at the very outset that the statute itself does not explicitly deny a jury trial?
1975.75-377,1,31089,john_j_irwin_jr,,2632.191,2632.716,It does not.
1975.75-377,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2632.716,2634.032,At the first tier?
1975.75-377,1,31089,john_j_irwin_jr,,2634.032,2634.588,It does not.
1975.75-377,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2634.588,2641.343,"So presumably the answer to the Chief Justice's question is yes, Massachusetts could do this without an amendment to the statute?"
1975.75-377,1,31089,john_j_irwin_jr,,2641.343,2642.912,I would say yes.
1975.75-377,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2646.258,2655.744,I understand you could not just sort of refer the case to the second tier?
1975.75-377,1,31089,john_j_irwin_jr,,2655.744,2657.771,I do not think you could do that now.
1975.75-377,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2659.697,2665.204,Or just permit an appeal from a guilty plea?
1975.75-377,1,31089,john_j_irwin_jr,,2665.204,2669.743,"No, you could not."
1975.75-377,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2669.743,2673.125,Do you know the Holiday case that was cited in the briefs?
1975.75-377,1,31089,john_j_irwin_jr,,2673.79,2676.067,"Yes, I believe it is if Your Honor please."
1975.75-377,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2677.894,2686.29,What Court?
1975.75-377,1,31089,john_j_irwin_jr,,2686.29,2690.099,"The Rhode Island Supreme Court, if your Honor please."
1975.75-377,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2690.099,2692.434,A Rhode Constitution or the State?
1975.75-377,1,31089,john_j_irwin_jr,,2692.434,2697.896,I think they decided as a matter of state constitutional law.
1975.75-377,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2697.896,2701.794,"(Inaudible) Under Rhode Island 93, is that it?"
1975.75-377,1,31089,john_j_irwin_jr,,2701.794,2702.895,"Yes, it is if Your Honor please."
1975.75-377,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2702.895,2707.118,Thank you.
1975.75-377,1,31089,john_j_irwin_jr,,2707.118,2745.367,"Your Honor it is moving along in the argument, the Commonwealth's position is that when this Court enunciated Duncan and Louisiana, what it did really was a establish a right to trial by jury, but did not establish a mode to constitutional jury trial, and therefore, it is open to Massachusetts and other de novo states to examine whether or not the de novo procedures that they have in effect deliver constitutionally mandated jury trial in a constitutional mode."
1975.75-377,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2914.423,2918.597,What do you do about Callan against Wilson?
1975.75-377,1,31089,john_j_irwin_jr,,2918.597,2927.661,"Well, again I think that my position in Callan against Wilson, of the Callan and Wilson case is this if your Honor please."
1975.75-377,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3026.458,3029.144,Mr. Justice Ford has in his concurring opinion in Duncan?
1975.75-377,1,31089,john_j_irwin_jr,,3029.144,3029.733,Exactly.
1975.75-377,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3038.461,3045.123,"Now, what was the maximum sentence of imposable under the offense for which he was tried?"
1975.75-377,1,31089,john_j_irwin_jr,,3045.123,3052.066,Two years in the House of Correction and a fine up to $200.00.
1975.75-377,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3052.066,3056.172,And one more question while I have interrupted.
1975.75-377,1,31089,john_j_irwin_jr,,3068.204,3070.78,The jury will not know about it.
1975.75-377,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3070.78,3075.155,"If there is a waiver of the jury, will the judge know?"
1975.75-377,1,31089,john_j_irwin_jr,,3075.155,3076.29,If there is a waiver at the District Court?
1975.75-377,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3076.29,3077.801,As in this case there was?
1975.75-377,1,31089,john_j_irwin_jr,,3077.801,3079.027,The judge would know.
1975.75-377,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3080.054,3086.617,"And if the jury would not know about the judgment, he would presumably also certainly not know about that sentence imposed?"
1975.75-377,1,31089,john_j_irwin_jr,,3086.617,3088.008,That is right.
1975.75-377,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3088.008,3101.025,"But at the new trial, there would be a complete and uninhabited freedom for the Court to impose any sentence within the statutory limits, regardless of the sentence that had been imposed at the District Court?"
1975.75-377,1,31089,john_j_irwin_jr,,3101.025,3103.933,"Exactly, if Your Honor please."
1975.75-377,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3103.933,3109.259,(Inaudible) to imposed heavier sentence than it was initially?
1975.75-377,1,31089,john_j_irwin_jr,,3109.259,3110.313,"Yes, it is."
1975.75-377,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3122.368,3123.999,Through the trial of de novo in that sense?
1975.75-377,1,31089,john_j_irwin_jr,,3123.999,3127.633,"Yes, it is if Your Honor please."
1975.75-377,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3255.842,3259.012,There is ever a need jury trials in this Court --
1975.75-377,1,31089,john_j_irwin_jr,,3259.012,3259.551,I am sorry.
1975.75-377,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3259.551,3262.535,Are there jury trials of any kind in your District Court?
1975.75-377,1,31089,john_j_irwin_jr,,3262.535,3263.751,There are not.
1975.75-377,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3284.005,3288.073,Very well.
1975.75-377,2,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,3288.843,3290.482,May I clear up one or two points Your Honor.
1975.75-377,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3348.042,3356.745,"(Inaudible) It is common defaults or many defaults, is it not? You are saying if he defaults, he is in trouble."
1975.75-377,2,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,3356.745,3361.242,Sure he is but you cannot convict the man in absentia and that is what it is.
1975.75-377,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3363.417,3371.58,"On the contrary, convictions can be held in absentia if the defendant voluntary absents himself?"
1975.75-377,2,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,3371.58,3374.809,I believe that issue Your Honor was raised and Tacon versus Arizona right.
1975.75-377,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3396.777,3400.566,"(Inaudible) I think it was default, his failure to show at the second tier trial?"
1975.75-377,2,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,3400.566,3402.387,That is correct.
1975.75-377,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3407.52,3409.526,Well certainly --
1975.75-377,2,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,3409.526,3411.627,"I suppose they can arrest them, Your Honor."
1975.75-377,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3411.627,3417.909,"What I mean if you put a rule that if a man does not show in the second tier, he goes free?"
1975.75-377,2,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,3417.909,3418.871,Oh! I did not say that Your Honor.
1975.75-377,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3418.871,3422.586,"Well, I think you would have a little difficulty to get that, would you?"
1975.75-377,2,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,3422.586,3428.94,"Yes, I do your Honor, but you see what happens is that it shifted the burden here to defendant."
1975.75-377,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3443.962,3449.85,"But in a single tier system if you failed to make untimely demand for jury trial, you waive it?"
1975.75-377,2,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,3449.85,3462.529,"Well, in criminal proceedings Your Honor, I do not believe there can be any constitute waiver for the specific fundamental procedural right in a criminal trial unless it is expressed."
1975.75-377,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3484.717,3494.367,(Inaudible) privilege to -- would it satisfy your argument if the defendant had the privilege of pleading guilty and then appealing?
1975.75-377,2,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,3494.367,3497.874,I do not like to see the fact that he has to plead guilty Your Honor.
1975.75-377,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3500.206,3503.39,"I am asking, I know you do not like it, but how about if Congress has constitutional --?"
1975.75-377,2,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,3503.39,3506.46,"Well, that is a close issue because that is the case in --"
1975.75-377,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3506.46,3508.103,What is your position on that?
1975.75-377,2,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,3508.103,3514.134,"Well, I have to concede to that point Your Honor because you wrote the opinion in Colten that is what you said so."
1975.75-377,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3515.966,3517.455,Well in Colten --
1975.75-377,2,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,3517.455,3518.101,He has not pleaded guilty.
1975.75-377,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3518.101,3522.773,You suggested in Colten that he can get a jury trial in the first tier Court?
1975.75-377,2,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,3522.773,3524.932,That is correct.
1975.75-377,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3524.932,3526.973,I thought he could just plead guilty?
1975.75-377,2,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,3526.973,3527.598,"Yes, he can."
1975.75-377,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3534.202,3542.515,"I understand that, but you are suggesting that will be elected in Colten under the Kentucky system that he can have a jury trial in the first tier?"
1975.75-377,2,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,3542.515,3544.946,Yes.
1975.75-377,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3553.299,3559.953,"Well, this is not quite the same thing to say you can plead guilty and do not have a jury trial in an Upper Court and to say that you can have --"
1975.75-377,2,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,3559.953,3560.615,That is right.
1975.75-377,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3561.28,3563.894,"Well alright, now which is it in the Colten case?"
1975.75-377,2,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,3563.894,3576.901,"Well, because you have a right to a jury trial in Colten, in the first tier then I think that if you plead guilty, it certainly different and if you did not have that opportunity before the jury trial."
1975.75-377,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3576.901,3586.052,"Well, I am frank to say, I did not recall that about the Kentucky system I knew that you could plead guilty and automatically get a jury trial when you appeal."
1975.75-377,2,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,3586.052,3588.963,"Yes, but you have that right for the jury trial in the --"
1975.75-377,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3588.963,3589.831,You could elect?
1975.75-377,2,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,3589.831,3592.904,Oh! Yes in the 16-jurisdiction it is like that.
1975.75-377,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3596.252,3597.696,Do you think it was true in Colten?
1975.75-377,2,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,3597.696,3600.146,"Yes, I know it is true in Colten Your Honor."
1975.75-377,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3625.849,3627.832,You are going to file those data with the clerk?
1975.75-377,2,39429,robert_w_hagopian,,3627.832,3628.73,"Yes, I have that later on."
1975.75-377,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3631.51,3632.255,Thank you gentlemen.
