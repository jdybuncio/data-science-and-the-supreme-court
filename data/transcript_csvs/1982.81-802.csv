1982.81-802,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,7.947,We will hear arguments first this morning in City of Lockhart against the United States.
1982.81-802,0,45491,walter_h_mizell,,12.276,16.492,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1982.81-802,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,54.692,56.985,Was it a majority vote or plurality?
1982.81-802,0,45491,walter_h_mizell,,56.985,58.143,Plurality.
1982.81-802,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,585.705,591.484,"Well, you seem to suggest then that this was a change, subject to Section 5."
1982.81-802,0,45491,walter_h_mizell,,591.484,593.827,"The enlargement of the council, yes, sir."
1982.81-802,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,593.827,594.78,You agree with that?
1982.81-802,0,45491,walter_h_mizell,,594.78,601.385,"We believe that the enlargement was a Section 5 change, and needed to be considered, reviewed by the Justice Department and pre-cleared."
1982.81-802,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,601.385,604.056,And was that always your position?
1982.81-802,0,45491,walter_h_mizell,,604.056,607.351,"Yes, sir, Justice White, it always has been."
1982.81-802,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,613.942,616.301,Said it wasn't even subject to preclearance.
1982.81-802,0,45491,walter_h_mizell,,616.301,617.474,--Said it was not subject to preclearance.
1982.81-802,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,620.067,625.707,So you concede that it was a change that must satisfy the Beer standard.
1982.81-802,0,45491,walter_h_mizell,,625.707,626.924,--We certainly do.
1982.81-802,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,973.577,976.951,"Mr. Mizell, was his testimony... is that orally or in affidavit form?"
1982.81-802,0,45491,walter_h_mizell,,976.951,977.921,It was presented orally.
1982.81-802,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1124.607,1133.497,Are you going to get to the suggestion that the amendment to Section 2 has an impact on this case?
1982.81-802,0,45491,walter_h_mizell,,1133.497,1139.884,"Well, that certainly has been... there has been a flurry of activity on that point."
1982.81-802,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1139.884,1155.502,"Isn't there... if the law has been changed in a way that affects this case, don't we have to judge this case based on the current law rather than on some prior law?"
1982.81-802,0,45491,walter_h_mizell,,1155.502,1157.237,I would not contest that point.
1982.81-802,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1157.237,1173.292,"I'm not suggesting that the change does have an impact, but the argument is that Section 2 means that even if this was not a regressive change, you must nevertheless... it must nevertheless pass muster under Section 2."
1982.81-802,0,45491,walter_h_mizell,,1173.292,1176.587,"I understand that to be the argument, and I would make two responses to that."
1982.81-802,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1212.821,1216.533,Is that in the statute itself or just in the history?
1982.81-802,0,45491,walter_h_mizell,,1216.533,1217.723,It's just in the legislative history.
1982.81-802,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1237.229,1238.963,Was any change made in Section 5?
1982.81-802,0,45491,walter_h_mizell,,1238.963,1240.414,No changes at all.
1982.81-802,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1242.383,1248.053,"Well, say a city makes a change that everybody agrees is a change."
1982.81-802,0,45491,walter_h_mizell,,1283.429,1290.285,"Well, Section 5 preclearance was never intended to preclude an attack on the constitutionality of the system."
1982.81-802,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1290.285,1291.346,I agree with you.
1982.81-802,0,45491,walter_h_mizell,,1291.346,1294.298,"And it would not, in any way, preclude an attack--"
1982.81-802,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1294.298,1309.545,But isn't that awfully wasteful of litigation to say that the district court in this case would have been... would be disentitled to recognize the possible illegality of the plan under Section 2?
1982.81-802,0,45491,walter_h_mizell,,1309.545,1323.146,"--The purpose of Section 5, as I understand it, was to allow a quick administrative review through the Justice Department, and a hearing if necessary before the District Court of the District of Columbia on a very limited nature."
1982.81-802,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1346.387,1351.465,So if there's got to be Section 2 litigation it ought to go on back in the home country.
1982.81-802,0,45491,walter_h_mizell,,1351.465,1362.052,"--Where the witnesses are located, where there's knowledge of the local law if that's necessary, and avoid the expense of dragging a city like Lockhart with 7500 people to Washington, D.C. to fight a Section 2--"
1982.81-802,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1362.052,1365.019,Don't we have to deal with this point here?
1982.81-802,0,45491,walter_h_mizell,,1365.019,1366.926,--The Section 2/Section 5 interrelationship?
1982.81-802,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1366.926,1368.002,Yes.
1982.81-802,0,45491,walter_h_mizell,,1368.002,1371.784,"Well, I have one more point on that, Mr. Justice White, which I'd like to suggest."
1982.81-802,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1437.757,1442.316,"All you're saying is that even if Section 2 was relevant here, it's been satisfied."
1982.81-802,0,45491,walter_h_mizell,,1442.316,1446.379,--It was not raised at the proper time because it should have been raised under--
1982.81-802,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1446.379,1450.844,"Well, it couldn't have been raised because the amendments hadn't been passed yet."
1982.81-802,0,45491,walter_h_mizell,,1450.844,1454.327,--But the underlying of Section 2 could have been.
1982.81-802,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1454.327,1455.734,You mean in a constitutional--
1982.81-802,0,45491,walter_h_mizell,,1455.734,1457.045,In the constitutional context.
1982.81-802,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1462.48,1466.855,"--Yes, but Section 2... the amendment to Section 2 couldn't have changed the constitutional standard."
1982.81-802,0,45491,walter_h_mizell,,1473.133,1474.428,--That's correct.
1982.81-802,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1474.428,1480.893,"So there really wasn't a chance before the amendment was made to argue this point, I wouldn't think."
1982.81-802,0,45491,walter_h_mizell,,1493.703,1517.428,"I can only say that it is my understanding from reviewing Section 2's history from the House and Senate records that what they were trying to do was restate the same standards that had previously existed under the constitutional guidelines laid down in White versus Register and the other at-large, single-member district litigation."
1982.81-802,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1520.396,1522.33,I understand that argument.
1982.81-802,0,45491,walter_h_mizell,,1531.142,1537.0,I believe that you should tell the district court to resume the hearing on the issue of intent.
1982.81-802,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1542.946,1550.367,Wouldn't it be appropriate also to ask them to consider the question whether Section 2 is now relevant without us necessarily deciding it?
1982.81-802,0,45491,walter_h_mizell,,1550.367,1564.799,"--It would be the city's position that if there were violations of the sort that would have raised the constitutional issue below, they should have been raised then, and it shouldn't be raised now, going back down."
1982.81-802,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1568.141,1577.184,But one could make the argument that numbered posts or staggered terms have an effect or result that's specifically intended to be prohibited by Section 2.
1982.81-802,0,45491,walter_h_mizell,,1587.51,1589.304,With the Section 2/Section 5?
1982.81-802,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1589.304,1590.068,--Yes.
1982.81-802,0,45491,walter_h_mizell,,1590.068,1596.456,"I think you should tell the district court that first, they made a mistake in the standard that they applied as far--"
1982.81-802,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1596.456,1596.818,I understand that.
1982.81-802,0,45491,walter_h_mizell,,1597.271,1604.515,"--Second, that they don't need to consider Section 2 because the same issues could have been raised the first time through in the context of an allegation of unconstitutionality."
1982.81-802,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1616.198,1619.65,Mr. Garza?
1982.81-802,1,30442,jose_garza,,1619.65,1622.586,"Mr. Chief Justice, and if it please the Court:"
1982.81-802,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1814.446,1830.329,"Mr. Garza, it's your position then that even had there been no increase in the number of positions or any change to staggered terms, that the mere adoption of home rule charter would trigger a Section 5 review."
1982.81-802,1,30442,jose_garza,,1831.265,1833.327,"--That's correct, Justice O'Connor."
1982.81-802,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1833.327,1845.556,"Mr. Garza, it would help me to know whether the bottom line really of your position is you'd like to return to the old form of government in this town."
1982.81-802,1,30442,jose_garza,,1849.9,1857.458,I think what our position is that the system that was adopted within the charter is discriminatory.
1982.81-802,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1878.167,1883.822,Does that mean you'd go back to the election system that existed from 1917?
1982.81-802,1,30442,jose_garza,,1883.822,1895.568,"--I think what you would go back to is, in terms of your election structure, what you had under a general law city; that is, an at-large plurality, no place system."
1982.81-802,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1897.864,1912.842,"Well, my understanding is that this particular city, although it was a general law city, had a mayor elected at large and two commissioners elected from numbered posts by a plurality vote."
1982.81-802,1,30442,jose_garza,,1914.953,1917.217,"--No, Your Honor."
1982.81-802,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1917.217,1920.232,Do you want to write a new charter?
1982.81-802,1,30442,jose_garza,,1920.232,1920.965,No.
1982.81-802,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1927.383,1928.272,I beg your pardon.
1982.81-802,1,30442,jose_garza,,1946.515,1951.982,--The city would have to revert back to a legal system.
1982.81-802,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1954.638,1957.06,You're saying it's been illegal since 1917.
1982.81-802,1,30442,jose_garza,,1957.06,1958.276,--That's correct.
1982.81-802,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1958.276,1962.603,"And that's because of the constitution, not because of the Voting Rights Act."
1982.81-802,1,30442,jose_garza,,1962.603,1965.384,It's because of Texas law.
1982.81-802,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1993.871,1997.246,"You're saying the invalidity is a matter of Texas law, primarily."
1982.81-802,1,30442,jose_garza,,1997.246,1998.636,--Yes.
1982.81-802,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1998.636,2004.663,"Mr. Garza, does your opponent agree with you on that issue of Texas law?"
1982.81-802,1,30442,jose_garza,,2004.663,2012.849,"They have stated that they don't, but they have not presented any substantial contrary position--"
1982.81-802,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2012.849,2019.112,"Well, what division did the district judge put in, lately?"
1982.81-802,1,30442,jose_garza,,2019.112,2027.266,--The only mention of an election system in the district judge's order is that they should go to the pre-existing election system.
1982.81-802,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2027.266,2029.437,Which is a numbered post system.
1982.81-802,1,30442,jose_garza,,2029.437,2034.776,Which is the election system under a general law city.
1982.81-802,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2034.776,2042.898,I can't imagine the judge thought that that prior system should be put back in if it was unauthorized by Texas law.
1982.81-802,1,30442,jose_garza,,2042.898,2045.32,The judge never made a ruling.
1982.81-802,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2046.474,2049.161,"I know, but must we assume--"
1982.81-802,1,30442,jose_garza,,2049.161,2063.297,"--We made a specific request the judge have a hearing and make a ruling on that specific issue, and the judge decided, without giving reason, that he was not going to take any--"
1982.81-802,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2063.297,2067.201,"--But he nevertheless restored the old system, at least temporarily."
1982.81-802,1,30442,jose_garza,,2067.201,2068.437,--He restored the old system.
1982.81-802,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2068.437,2074.856,"And you think that he nevertheless, that he didn't believe that it was valid under Texas law?"
1982.81-802,1,30442,jose_garza,,2074.856,2077.714,I don't think that he felt that.
1982.81-802,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2078.728,2080.306,Do you think he just overlooked it?
1982.81-802,1,30442,jose_garza,,2080.306,2081.257,No.
1982.81-802,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2090.659,2094.395,Wasn't it his obligation to apply Texas law?
1982.81-802,1,30442,jose_garza,,2094.395,2102.093,--I think his only obligation was to enjoin the use of an unpre-cleared election system.
1982.81-802,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2187.309,2207.161,"Do you think Congress really intended, in referring these matters involving states far away from the District of Columbia to have the District Court for the District of Columbia, whose judges presumably have no expertise in the law of Texas, to pass on questions of state law as well as questions of federal arising under the Voting Rights Act?"
1982.81-802,1,30442,jose_garza,,2207.161,2219.032,"I think that the District Court in Washington, D.C. has a duty to examine what the discriminatory impact of an election change is."
1982.81-802,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2240.163,2253.706,"Why shouldn't the District of Columbia Court, inexperienced as I presume they might admit they were on Texas law, simply apply the usual presumption that goes with official acts; that they're presumed valid unless shown to be otherwise."
1982.81-802,1,30442,jose_garza,,2253.706,2285.3,"I think what's significant in that, Justice Rehnquist, is just having the challenge, just having the possibility that that system is illegal and no question at all but that it is legal under the charter, I think that signifies a change that the district court talked about... no longer, after the adoption of the charter, will the minority community in Lockhart have the opportunity to challenge a feature that everybody admits has the potential for discriminating against the Mexican Americans."
1982.81-802,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2285.3,2286.208,"Well, he could have done it somewhat differently."
1982.81-802,1,30442,jose_garza,,2315.852,2328.158,"I think we have... since the filing of the 1979 action, through today, there has not been the opportunity to go back to Texas and the state courts and challenge that."
1982.81-802,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2352.243,2355.99,Don't you have declaratory judgment down there?
1982.81-802,1,30442,jose_garza,,2355.99,2358.786,Advisory opinions are not proper under Texas law.
1982.81-802,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2358.786,2360.054,I said declaratory judgment.
1982.81-802,1,30442,jose_garza,,2360.054,2361.863,"Yes, declaratory judgment."
1982.81-802,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2361.863,2363.38,"That's not an advisory opinion, sir."
1982.81-802,1,30442,jose_garza,,2363.38,2363.754,Right.
1982.81-802,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2379.185,2384.963,You never heard of declaratory judgment to determine whether a future act is good or not?
1982.81-802,1,30442,jose_garza,,2387.713,2390.536,"Yes, Your Honor."
1982.81-802,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2400.379,2407.561,There is no certainty that you will have elections in this town in the future?
1982.81-802,1,30442,jose_garza,,2407.561,2412.201,There is no certainty that they will use the numbered post provision in those elections.
1982.81-802,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2412.201,2415.153,There is a certainty that there will be elections; is that true?
1982.81-802,1,30442,jose_garza,,2415.153,2417.217,"They have... yes, Your Honor."
1982.81-802,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2417.217,2427.648,"Mr. Garza, though, did not the recent order by the district court in Texas indicate that they were free to use the old system, which would include numbered posts?"
1982.81-802,1,30442,jose_garza,,2427.648,2431.976,They were... the restraining order did not prohibit them from using it.
1982.81-802,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2447.625,2454.137,"And then if they should do in the future what they last did in the past, they would be using numbered posts, I would assume."
1982.81-802,1,30442,jose_garza,,2454.137,2463.991,"But we would have... if there is no pre-clearance of the charter, we would have the opportunity to go into Texas state courts, and I think rather quickly--"
1982.81-802,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2463.991,2465.337,I see.
1982.81-802,1,30442,jose_garza,,2465.337,2468.085,--preclude the use of the numbered post provision.
1982.81-802,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2474.706,2494.372,"Mr. Garza, certainly there is language in the Perkins case that would indicate that what the court should look at in the Section 5 review is the system actually being employed, rather than something that perhaps was mandated by state law that's different."
1982.81-802,1,30442,jose_garza,,2495.402,2496.042,Yes.
1982.81-802,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2676.483,2680.842,"Mr. Garza, is that really a very satisfactory way of interpreting legislation?"
1982.81-802,1,30442,jose_garza,,2715.454,2719.155,"--Well, I think it's consistent with the purpose of Section 5."
1982.81-802,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2740.177,2750.015,"Your suggestion is that both the attorney general, if things are presented to him, and the court must consider Section 2 in pre-clearance."
1982.81-802,1,30442,jose_garza,,2750.015,2750.873,--Yes.
1982.81-802,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2750.873,2758.544,"And I take it that if the system is to go ahead, it's going to have to pass muster under both Section 5 and Section 2."
1982.81-802,1,30442,jose_garza,,2758.544,2770.321,"I think that it must be shown to the satisfaction to the district court that there is no retrogression and that also, there is no discriminatory result."
1982.81-802,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2770.321,2784.393,"So I take it, then, that if you approach the Section 5 issue first, if you pre-clear it, you're nevertheless going to have to go to Section 2."
1982.81-802,1,30442,jose_garza,,2790.922,2797.325,I think the starting point is the retrogression standard.
1982.81-802,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2803.119,2806.539,But which should you start with?
1982.81-802,1,30442,jose_garza,,2820.409,2838.121,"I think the record in this case supports a Section 2 violation in terms of just the numbers showing that the system is not equally open to members of the minority community, and that election history has been--"
1982.81-802,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2838.121,2843.12,"Yes, but shouldn't that argument be made in the district court and not here, in the first instance?"
1982.81-802,1,30442,jose_garza,,2843.12,2845.589,--I think that would be proper.
1982.81-802,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2845.589,2851.774,"If that's so, that would suggest if you're right not an affirmance here but a remand, wouldn't it?"
1982.81-802,1,30442,jose_garza,,2851.774,2860.488,I think the Court must find that there has been no retrogression and the court below was clearly erroneous in its conclusion.
1982.81-802,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2926.799,2929.97,"Do you have anything further, Mr. Mizell?"
1982.81-802,2,45491,walter_h_mizell,,2929.97,2937.173,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, I'd like to just make a point or two in response to the questions that were raised a moment ago."
1982.81-802,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2968.439,2970.143,What page are you on there?
1982.81-802,2,45491,walter_h_mizell,,2970.143,2974.752,"The appendix to the Jurisdictional Statement, it's the... it's not the record itself."
1982.81-802,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2981.53,2981.998,And what's the point?
1982.81-802,2,45491,walter_h_mizell,,2981.998,2993.696,"The point is that in the Supplemental Brief we filed on page S4, finding number 11 is the corresponding paragraph in the order."
1982.81-802,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3034.133,3046.862,"Well, the order on page S8 expressly says that you're allowed to conduct elections pursuant to the pre-existing electoral system."
1982.81-802,2,45491,walter_h_mizell,,3046.862,3054.466,"Your Honor, my point is that when counsel was standing here a moment ago, he suggested that there was nothing that would preclude us from doing it i the first place."
1982.81-802,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3072.009,3076.49,"Well, there's no question that the pre-existing electoral system used numbered places."
1982.81-802,2,45491,walter_h_mizell,,3076.49,3077.208,--That's correct.
1982.81-802,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3077.208,3078.459,And he expressly permits it.
1982.81-802,2,45491,walter_h_mizell,,3078.459,3081.926,He does in the 1982 order.
1982.81-802,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3081.926,3082.846,Yes.
1982.81-802,2,45491,walter_h_mizell,,3082.846,3084.035,But in 71--
1982.81-802,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3084.035,3096.14,"I know, but my interest is whether he... whether we must assume that he considered the legality of it under Texas law."
1982.81-802,2,45491,walter_h_mizell,,3096.14,3103.682,"--I can only go outside the record to answer that, but it was fully briefed as vigorously as either side knew how, on all issues."
1982.81-802,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3103.682,3112.257,"Does that mean, Mr. Mizell, that you take the position that as a matter of Texas law, a general law city could use numbered posts?"
1982.81-802,2,45491,walter_h_mizell,,3112.257,3115.192,"We take that position initially, yes."
1982.81-802,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3119.693,3120.878,I understand that position.
1982.81-802,2,45491,walter_h_mizell,,3123.159,3124.08,Certainly do.
1982.81-802,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3125.503,3128.814,You think Judge Garza... what was his name?
1982.81-802,2,45491,walter_h_mizell,,3128.814,3129.968,--Judge Garcia.
1982.81-802,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3129.968,3139.012,That Judge Garcia must have thought the numbered post system in a general law city was all right?
1982.81-802,2,45491,walter_h_mizell,,3139.012,3145.979,I don't know whether he decided that or whether he looked at the Voting Rights Act and decided that whatever system was previously in place could be carried forward.
1982.81-802,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3151.568,3172.309,"Is it clear whether he thought that there was no coverage for purposes of Section 5 review as a result of that, or that he looked at it and found no retrogressive effect; that there was a coverage issue but it wasn't retrogressive?"
1982.81-802,2,45491,walter_h_mizell,,3172.309,3177.807,I don't think he was making a determination about retrogression at all on that point.
1982.81-802,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3177.807,3178.591,It's just an interim plan.
1982.81-802,2,45491,walter_h_mizell,,3178.591,3180.65,I think it was just an interim plan.
1982.81-802,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3188.879,3190.423,"Thank you, gentlemen, the case is submitted."
