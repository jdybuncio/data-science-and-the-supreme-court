1960.102,0,34731,lawrence_s_lesser,,629.338,631.226,It was in reference to a general problem.

1960.102,0,34731,lawrence_s_lesser,,693.468,693.925,It's a note.
1960.102,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,693.925,694.87,What is the note about?
1960.102,0,34731,lawrence_s_lesser,,694.87,695.372,Pardon?
1960.102,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,695.372,696.923,What is the note about?
1960.102,0,34731,lawrence_s_lesser,,696.923,703.702,The note is about the Secretary of State's construction of the 1881 Convention.

1960.102,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,708.416,710.008,-- will construe the act of 1880 –
1960.102,0,34731,lawrence_s_lesser,,710.008,722.815,"No, the -- the Yugoslav Ambassador inquired and the inquiry is set out on page 12A."
1960.102,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,722.815,724.716,What did he inquire about?
1960.102,0,34731,lawrence_s_lesser,,739.805,756.725,"Well, the precise -- the precise occasion was the inquiry by the Yugoslav Ambassador as to what the view of the United States was in that regard with respect to Article II of the Convention."
1960.102,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,785.098,786.536,This is 1958.
1960.102,0,34731,lawrence_s_lesser,,786.536,788.268,"1958, sir."
1960.102,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,789.262,793.433,"It was in connection with this very suit, was it Mr. Lesser?"
1960.102,0,34731,lawrence_s_lesser,,793.433,804.226,"I wouldn't say in connection with this suit, but I must say that from what I understand there's been a great deal of litigation involving Yugoslav inheritances."
1960.102,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,804.226,805.772,True.
1960.102,0,34731,lawrence_s_lesser,,805.772,812.54,"In some of the cases, the treaty wasn't involved at all, in others, it has been."
1960.102,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,813.512,835.756,"My curiosity is whether this pronouncement by the Secretary of the State was a post motam litem and was directed to a specific litigation in which he gave an opinion as to what the Treaty meant or whether it was a pronouncement, neutral as it were so far as a particular litigation was concerned --"
1960.102,0,34731,lawrence_s_lesser,,835.756,835.923,But --
1960.102,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,835.923,854.995,"-- namely, that there is an inquiry generally or whatever provoked it, maybe in the re-consideration of a treaty, maybe the Yugoslav Ambassador wanted to know what the State Department thought because if they gave one answer, they might propose a modification and if they gave another answer, they would rest on the --"
1960.102,0,34731,lawrence_s_lesser,,854.995,855.099,I --
1960.102,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,855.099,871.751,"It seemed like that or in mind, Mr. Lesser because -- we start again with a proposition that a settled construction by State Department, our treaty governs the courts, that's the general proposition."
1960.102,0,34731,lawrence_s_lesser,,871.751,882.824,"Well, I think Your Honor that the construction by the State Department here is one that was demonstrably that of the negotiator in 1881."
1960.102,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,894.777,904.55,What you're saying is that the later construction by the Secretary of State was in confirmation of the attending circumstances of the original treaty?
1960.102,0,34731,lawrence_s_lesser,,904.55,907.417,"Yes, sir."
1960.102,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,919.559,920.417,Not a suit.
1960.102,0,34731,lawrence_s_lesser,,920.688,921.676,"Not this, oh on."
1960.102,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1525.292,1537.203,"That means fully -- irrespective of treaties or where no treaty exists, the Bretton Woods Agreement was to accomplish the results that you urge under this Article II."
1960.102,0,34731,lawrence_s_lesser,,1537.203,1544.781,"With respect -- with respect to this particular case and this is the holding of the court below under Section 1 (b), yes, sir."
1960.102,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1587.754,1602.701,I think that's (Inaudible) this -- this state of your argument would undercut the great body I should think of state legislation regarding eligibility by -- by foreigners.
1960.102,0,34731,lawrence_s_lesser,,1602.701,1604.153,It might get involved sir.
1960.102,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1658.479,1659.961,Ms. Zorn.
1960.102,1,20442,catherine_zorn,,1659.961,1663.17,Mr. Chief Justice.
1960.102,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2025.117,2042.938,May I cover to you to explain with some particularity whether the Bretton Woods Act was nonoperative until there were -- there were some implementing action by the Government either through the Congress or through the Executive Department?
1960.102,1,20442,catherine_zorn,,2042.938,2043.043,I thought --
1960.102,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2043.043,2058.414,"In other words, I gather from what you've just said that the Bretton Woods Act as such, to which the Government -- the -- the United States was a party, as such did not affect the free movement of capital, is that right?"
1960.102,1,20442,catherine_zorn,,2058.414,2064.65,I believe the -- the agreement itself leaves the fund controls of capital transfers pretty untouched.
1960.102,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2073.781,2087.004,"That is if -- does the fund have to do something or derive by the Act and by the Treaty which then might affect contrary state legislations, is that your view?"
1960.102,1,20442,catherine_zorn,,2087.004,2092.292,"I don't believe I quite follow, but my thought is this --"
1960.102,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2092.292,2104.08,"You said that -- that the Act itself, that there was nothing done to carry out the policy under the Act dealing with or free capital movements?"
1960.102,1,20442,catherine_zorn,,2104.08,2110.463,"As far as the United States is concerned, it did not adopt any fund control or any exchange restrictions."
1960.102,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2110.463,2114.922,"And therefore the Act itself did not -- did not deal with the matter, is that it?"
1960.102,1,20442,catherine_zorn,,2114.922,2119.065,The Act itself leaves capital transfers pretty much untouched.
1960.102,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2133.637,2137.403,So the Act was merely an authorizing power?
1960.102,1,20442,catherine_zorn,,2137.403,2138.12,Yes.
1960.102,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2138.12,2141.523,(Voice Overlap) if some step were taken by the fund.
1960.102,1,20442,catherine_zorn,,2141.523,2143.129,Yes or by the United States.
1960.102,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2143.129,2145.72,"Or by the United States, separately."
1960.102,1,20442,catherine_zorn,,2148.989,2149.496,That's right.
1960.102,1,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,2158.506,2161.64,"So why didn't the board, done anything -- you said, I believe the board --"
1960.102,1,20442,catherine_zorn,,2161.64,2172.236,The annual reports to the board indicate that capital movement is permitted to the members of the fund at all times.
1960.102,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2286.497,2287.613,Mr. Lesser.
1960.102,2,34731,lawrence_s_lesser,,2287.613,2292.221,May I address myself for a moment to the question Mr. Justice Frankfurter put?
1960.102,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2292.221,2294.541,You may.
1960.102,2,34731,lawrence_s_lesser,,2294.541,2309.208,The United States became a party to the International Monetary Fund Agreement pursuant to the authority granted to the Executive by the Congress in the Bretton Woods Agreement Act.
