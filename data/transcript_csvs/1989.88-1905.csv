1989.88-1905,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.939,"We'll hear argument next in No. 88-1905, Eddie Keller v. the State Bar of California."
1989.88-1905,0,15742,anthony_t_caso,,15.693,19.811,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.88-1905,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,148.762,155.666,May they lobby on any subject permissibly against the views of some minority?
1989.88-1905,0,15742,anthony_t_caso,,155.666,159.534,If it is... if it is supported by a compelling governmental interest.
1989.88-1905,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,167.038,173.728,So... so your answer to my question is that they can... they can lobby for nothing unless there's a compelling interest for it?
1989.88-1905,0,15742,anthony_t_caso,,173.728,174.144,Yes.
1989.88-1905,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,174.144,179.631,Could they lobby for a pro bono requirement for all attorneys in the state?
1989.88-1905,0,15742,anthony_t_caso,,179.631,187.701,"Again, if the state identifies that as an interest for forcing all attorneys into an association--"
1989.88-1905,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,187.701,189.553,"Well, that... take this... take this case."
1989.88-1905,0,15742,anthony_t_caso,,206.182,221.608,"--I don't believe so because I believe that there's an underlying public policy purpose behind such legislation that doesn't extend to a reason for California to force these people into a group, to force them to pay a fee to make that type of a political judgment."
1989.88-1905,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,221.608,230.964,"Well, do you have to start kind of building the wheel from scratch every... every question you get to with respect to the State Bar?"
1989.88-1905,0,15742,anthony_t_caso,,245.89,250.128,"Indeed, that is what this Court did in Lathrop."
1989.88-1905,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,259.233,268.755,"Well, but couldn't you say some of these things are at least offshoots of the need to regulate the practice of... regulate the practice of law?"
1989.88-1905,0,15742,anthony_t_caso,,268.755,270.672,If indeed they are offshoots.
1989.88-1905,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,278.278,288.586,"Well, do... but do you think the Lathrop decision that a state may integrate its bar is based on a compelling necessity for integrating the State Bar?"
1989.88-1905,0,15742,anthony_t_caso,,288.586,291.788,I'm not sure that the Court in Lathrop used those terms.
1989.88-1905,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,310.249,313.617,"Indeed, Lathrop didn't involve speech at all, did it?"
1989.88-1905,0,15742,anthony_t_caso,,317.069,318.002,It was both--
1989.88-1905,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,318.002,318.185,Was it--
1989.88-1905,0,15742,anthony_t_caso,,318.185,321.937,"--a speech and association case, and only the association issue was decided."
1989.88-1905,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,321.937,323.723,--Only the association issue was decided.
1989.88-1905,0,15742,anthony_t_caso,,336.697,342.684,It... it... there can be underlying compelling state interest.
1989.88-1905,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,344.267,344.517,To make them lobby.
1989.88-1905,0,15742,anthony_t_caso,,351.837,355.623,"Well, to take the Lathrop example, improving the quality of legal services."
1989.88-1905,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,370.798,379.738,--And then you're saying there's a compelling state interest that the bar association must lobby on qualifications for law schools?
1989.88-1905,0,15742,anthony_t_caso,,379.738,381.19,"No, Your Honor."
1989.88-1905,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,401.87,403.556,But the bar wouldn't have to do that?
1989.88-1905,0,15742,anthony_t_caso,,403.556,404.672,It would not have to do that.
1989.88-1905,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,405.339,406.139,It may authorize to--
1989.88-1905,0,15742,anthony_t_caso,,406.139,406.923,--It would be authorized.
1989.88-1905,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,406.923,407.357,--Uh-huh.
1989.88-1905,0,15742,anthony_t_caso,,412.292,413.411,And again--
1989.88-1905,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,413.411,418.565,My dues are still going to... to subsidize that lobbying against a position--
1989.88-1905,0,15742,anthony_t_caso,,418.565,419.898,"--Precisely, and your rights are--"
1989.88-1905,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,419.898,420.848,--But you say that would be okay?
1989.88-1905,0,15742,anthony_t_caso,,420.848,421.933,--Your rights are infringed.
1989.88-1905,1,41457,seth_m_hufstedler,,1156.704,1163.358,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.88-1905,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1214.373,1219.944,"But, Mr. Hufstedler, didn't they also ask for a refund of money that had been used to support political activities?"
1989.88-1905,1,41457,seth_m_hufstedler,,1219.944,1228.05,"No, Justice Stevens, they didn't, and so far as I can determine, until today, other than saying Hudson should control here, they have never said, we really ought to--"
1989.88-1905,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1228.05,1234.787,Paragraph 3 of the prayer of the complaint asked for an injunction compelling Respondent Defendants to reimburse the treasury of the State Bar and so forth and so on.
1989.88-1905,1,41457,seth_m_hufstedler,,1238.656,1239.072,"--Oh, no."
1989.88-1905,2,15742,anthony_t_caso,,2832.975,2834.392,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1989.88-1905,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2882.772,2885.859,"Well, what if... what if we agree with you, what will our judgment be?"
1989.88-1905,2,15742,anthony_t_caso,,2885.859,2894.632,"Your judgment will be that the... the bar can do those things that the state has an interest in, and if it wishes to do other things, it must--"
1989.88-1905,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2894.632,2895.632,That the state has an interest in.
1989.88-1905,2,15742,anthony_t_caso,,2895.632,2898.834,--That the state has an important or compelling interest.
1989.88-1905,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2898.834,2901.286,"Well, the state obviously thinks it has an interest in all these things."
1989.88-1905,2,15742,anthony_t_caso,,2902.519,2903.269,There--
1989.88-1905,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2903.269,2912.844,--You think there... we would have to... we would have to say there may be an integrated bar but only for certain purposes?
1989.88-1905,2,15742,anthony_t_caso,,2912.844,2923.449,--The Court has already ruled that there may be a mandatory bar association when the state's purpose is to improve the quality and delivery of legal services.
1989.88-1905,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2925.317,2925.851,Not... not--
1989.88-1905,2,15742,anthony_t_caso,,2925.851,2926.317,--is having done that--
1989.88-1905,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2926.317,2927.519,--Not the administration of justice?
1989.88-1905,2,15742,anthony_t_caso,,2927.519,2929.336,--What does that term mean?
1989.88-1905,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2929.336,2930.055,I... I don't know.
1989.88-1905,2,15742,anthony_t_caso,,2930.055,2932.771,"Under... in the court below, that term is limitless, Your Honor."
1989.88-1905,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2932.771,2936.792,What does improving the quality... the delivery of legal services mean?
1989.88-1905,2,15742,anthony_t_caso,,2936.792,2945.398,"In Lathrop, the Court looked at very specific examples of what was happening, continuing legal education, admission and discipline of attorneys."
1989.88-1905,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2947.381,2956.021,"Well, do you think... do you think the reform... that reformation of the tort... law of torts would be improving the delivery of legal services?"
1989.88-1905,2,15742,anthony_t_caso,,2956.021,2956.955,"--No, Your Honor."
1989.88-1905,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2969.694,2976.098,"May I ask you this question, because the administration of justice obviously can be a large or small term--"
1989.88-1905,2,15742,anthony_t_caso,,2976.098,2976.431,That's right.
1989.88-1905,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2976.431,2977.364,--depending on what you include in it.
1989.88-1905,2,15742,anthony_t_caso,,2994.857,2996.892,I'm not sure it is that small.
1989.88-1905,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2998.259,2998.842,"Well, how about... what's your judgment?"
1989.88-1905,2,15742,anthony_t_caso,,3003.111,3003.511,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1989.88-1905,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3030.611,3031.996,"--Yes, but you don't object to all of this--"
1989.88-1905,2,15742,anthony_t_caso,,3031.996,3032.396,Correct.
1989.88-1905,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3032.396,3033.263,--as I understand your brief.
1989.88-1905,2,15742,anthony_t_caso,,3042.336,3044.436,It can change the law when the--
1989.88-1905,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3044.436,3044.702,I mean to lobby for--
1989.88-1905,2,15742,anthony_t_caso,,3044.702,3046.204,--state has that interest.
1989.88-1905,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3051.775,3056.144,"--Well, it wants to improve the administration of justice, and there's an area of dispute about what that includes."
1989.88-1905,2,15742,anthony_t_caso,,3066.867,3071.855,I go back to the 1982 figures as my base point.
1989.88-1905,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3085.496,3089.198,"Well, I know, but, see, you do have a remedy on specific issues you disagree with."
1989.88-1905,2,15742,anthony_t_caso,,3095.554,3096.354,--But... but the--
1989.88-1905,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3096.354,3097.004,--like the nuclear freeze.
1989.88-1905,2,15742,anthony_t_caso,,3097.004,3104.409,"--California Supreme Court has... has laid down the definition of what those terms mean in California, what those terms mean in this statute."
1989.88-1905,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3107.278,3108.428,But what exactly--
1989.88-1905,2,15742,anthony_t_caso,,3108.428,3109.194,Anything--
1989.88-1905,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3109.194,3110.98,--in this statute are you opposed to?
1989.88-1905,2,15742,anthony_t_caso,,3111.93,3114.432,--We're not opposed to the words in the statute.
1989.88-1905,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3114.432,3114.915,Well--
1989.88-1905,2,15742,anthony_t_caso,,3114.915,3116.55,"It's the way California defined them, Your Honor."
1989.88-1905,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3118.834,3124.471,"--In line with Justice Stevens, we have to say... you want us to say something specific, don't you?"
1989.88-1905,2,15742,anthony_t_caso,,3124.471,3124.99,"Yes, Your Honor."
1989.88-1905,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3124.99,3128.108,What do you want us to say specifically?
1989.88-1905,2,15742,anthony_t_caso,,3130.208,3146.551,"The remedy this Court should issue is that... to decide the bar is well within its power to use mandatory association and mandatory fees to finance those activities related to the delivery of quality legal services, as this Court determined in Lathrop."
1989.88-1905,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3154.339,3163.595,But it doesn't... it doesn't... I thought you were... you wanted... you were asking perhaps an injunction against the bar from doing those things.
1989.88-1905,2,15742,anthony_t_caso,,3163.595,3168.749,Certainly when I go back to the courts in California with this decision it will be... I don't--
1989.88-1905,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3168.749,3183.057,"If you get a... if we agree with you, you don't... you're not... wouldn't... would it solve your problem to... to have a little refund of dues or do you want an injunction against the bar from doing these things as long as they have an integrated bar?"
1989.88-1905,2,15742,anthony_t_caso,,3183.057,3186.378,"--Your Honor, on the association rights we want an injunction."
1989.88-1905,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3191.746,3192.013,It isn't going to do you--
1989.88-1905,2,15742,anthony_t_caso,,3192.013,3193.198,--then the refund solves the problem.
1989.88-1905,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3193.198,3200.102,--It isn't going to satisfy you to... to have the... the kind of a solution that there is in the labor union area?
1989.88-1905,2,15742,anthony_t_caso,,3200.102,3208.874,That does not take care of what we assert are the association rights at stake here because this is an expressive association that they're compelled to be members of.
1989.88-1905,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3208.874,3211.29,"No, but it does take care of your free speech claim."
1989.88-1905,2,15742,anthony_t_caso,,3211.29,3212.576,It does take care of the speech claims.
1989.88-1905,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3212.576,3214.944,A refund of about $10 out of the $200 would do it.
1989.88-1905,2,15742,anthony_t_caso,,3214.944,3215.411,Sure.
1989.88-1905,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3219.313,3220.113,"Well, according to Mr. Hufstedler--"
1989.88-1905,2,15742,anthony_t_caso,,3220.113,3220.848,--compel all doctors--
1989.88-1905,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3220.848,3223.634,--a refund of about 25 cents out of that $200 would do it.
1989.88-1905,2,15742,anthony_t_caso,,3239.227,3240.477,--Interest that would--
1989.88-1905,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3240.477,3240.643,I think you could make--
1989.88-1905,2,15742,anthony_t_caso,,3240.643,3240.977,--Okay.
1989.88-1905,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3240.977,3249.999,--a very rational argument... a lot of people could... that nothing is more important to morality and to continued law than a nuclear freeze.
1989.88-1905,2,15742,anthony_t_caso,,3249.999,3250.499,Okay.
1989.88-1905,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3252.285,3258.189,And so are we supposed to judge whether or not each of these issues on an issue-by-issue basis is somehow compelling?
1989.88-1905,2,15742,anthony_t_caso,,3258.189,3258.905,--No.
1989.88-1905,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3271.948,3286.791,But would you apply some test that if there is a voluntary association of lawyers that's willing to provide the... the analysis or the advice there's... there's prima facia no compelling state interest in impressing every lawyer in the state to supporting such an enterprise?
1989.88-1905,2,15742,anthony_t_caso,,3286.791,3291.493,--Certainly I don't think you can delegate to a voluntary association a regulatory function.
1989.88-1905,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3291.493,3292.21,I'm not saying delegating.
1989.88-1905,2,15742,anthony_t_caso,,3305.669,3320.945,"Well, certainly, and there are a number of those associations, and the legislature is better served because only those people that want to belong to that association are making that message and the legislature is better able to evaluate it in that respect."
1989.88-1905,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3320.945,3324.214,And what do you need a mandatory association of all the state lawyers for?
1989.88-1905,2,15742,anthony_t_caso,,3326.349,3334.355,"Well, this Court has recognized that's okay for the state to do, for discipline matters, for continuing legal education, for ethics requirements."
1989.88-1905,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3344.71,3351.75,How do you expect us to write something that you won't write yourself?
1989.88-1905,2,15742,anthony_t_caso,,3351.75,3354.602,"I'm sorry, Your Honor."
1989.88-1905,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3355.852,3356.002,No.
1989.88-1905,2,15742,anthony_t_caso,,3358.637,3365.791,"--Well, again, I'd just have to go back to the fact that California has--"
1989.88-1905,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3365.791,3368.41,Is it written down so I can read it?
1989.88-1905,2,15742,anthony_t_caso,,3368.41,3370.778,--Unfortunately I didn't provide a real clear--
1989.88-1905,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3370.778,3371.412,Sir?
1989.88-1905,2,15742,anthony_t_caso,,3371.412,3376.115,"--I did not provide a clear definition of that in my papers, and I apologize for that, Your Honor."
