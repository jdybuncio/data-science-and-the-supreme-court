1989.88-952,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.529,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Number 88-952, United States versus Sperry Corporation."
1989.88-952,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,9.856,13.949,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.88-952,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,178.381,186.83,"At what point, Mr. Wallace, do you get to the point where it really wouldn't be permissible to attribute these costs to--"
1989.88-952,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,186.83,198.638,"--Well, I am just... I think insofar as they can be related to a benefit that is conferred upon the special class of persons they could be included."
1989.88-952,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,385.563,387.25,"--Well, that's not really this case, is it?"
1989.88-952,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,399.869,401.697,--Exactly so.
1989.88-952,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,401.697,408.272,And I would... I don't think they concede that the settlement was adequate if you take into account the deduct.
1989.88-952,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,411.052,416.129,"Exactly so, Mr. Justice."
1989.88-952,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,479.711,488.115,"Well, you could say that, though, about a 25 percent fee, that didn't purport to be equal to the cost."
1989.88-952,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,496.706,509.871,"Well, that is quite so, but the point nonetheless is relevant to the foreseeability of what the consequences of the settlement would be, and--"
1989.88-952,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,509.871,521.991,"Well, of course, I suppose Sperry could foresee that that fee would be declared unconstitutional, or unauthorized rather, by the United States claims court, so that still brings us back to square one, it seems to me."
1989.88-952,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,521.991,561.32,"--Since Sperry did not waive its right to challenge the fee... there is, however, Justice Kennedy, another respect in which these aggregate figures are relevant here, and that is that, as we have pointed out in our footnote 16, thus far Iran has managed to satisfy its obligations to replenish the security account by means of payments out of an escrow fund that has been created for the interest earned by the security account."
1989.88-952,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,675.68,676.086,"Mr. Wallace, excuse me."
1989.88-952,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,691.471,693.579,"--Well,--"
1989.88-952,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,693.579,706.293,"I mean it just seems to me a little bit unreal to say, were I Sperry, I would feel a little bit aggrieved when the government says you cannot pursue your claims through normal legal means; we are going to erect a barrier to that."
1989.88-952,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,712.118,717.944,"--Well, that depends on what you mean by normal legal means, Mr. Justice."
1989.88-952,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,721.006,725.161,Attaching any of the assets of Iran in this country and levying upon them.
1989.88-952,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,725.161,745.48,"--Eleven months after the president froze Iranian assets in this country, at a time when there was a threat by Iran to withdraw all those assets, Sperry did attach the assets."
1989.88-952,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,769.705,774.656,"Because of the government's order that we approved previously, correct?"
1989.88-952,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,774.656,783.027,"Well, the assets were there only because the president froze them in the first place because of the international crisis that had arisen."
1989.88-952,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,905.09,912.227,"You are saying that this is a user fee that has a nexus to the transaction that Sperry entered into, and therefore it is essentially reasonable."
1989.88-952,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,913.898,915.725,"--Well, that is correct."
1989.88-952,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,916.632,918.958,What about the retroactivity aspect of it?
1989.88-952,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,947.586,986.978,"--Well, it is common for tax laws to be made retroactive, as this Court has upheld many times, the United States against Darusmont, and others, where there is no specific service that was provided to the taxpayer, but Congress wanted to achieve uniform treatment of the taxpayers under this Court's decisions dealing with the question of retroactivity of legislation regulation economic relationships, the Pension Benefit Guaranty cases, and Usery against Turner Elkhorn."
1989.88-952,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1025.009,1035.285,So you would say that anyone who uses services of the government is under the contingent liability that they may be charged a retroactive user fee?
1989.88-952,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1035.285,1044.876,It does not exceed the cost to the government of providing those services... if it is reasonable to do that.
1989.88-952,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1091.747,1097.964,"Well, what if Congress decided that the filing fees in the district court have been low for a lot of years."
1989.88-952,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1114.487,1159.408,"That would raise problems considerably beyond the problems here since there was already a two percent fee prescribed before Sperry submitted its claim, even though Sperry had a legal argument that that fee would not be valid, and the fee is also much less than the five percent fee that historically has been charged under the Foreign Claims Settlement Act for the president's undertaking to settle claims of American companies against foreign governments, such as in the Shanghai Power case."
1989.88-952,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1170.387,1177.322,"Mr. Wallace, is it not true that in this case Sperry filed its claim before the treasury two percent regulation was put into effect?"
1989.88-952,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1177.322,1188.599,"It filed its claim, yes, but submitted the settlement for the entry of the award after it went into effect."
1989.88-952,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1188.599,1196.126,"Well, I understand they settled it after it, but when they invoked the jurisdiction of the Tribunal, there was no notice that any claim would be filed, any two percent or one and half percent would be collected."
1989.88-952,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1196.126,1199.953,"Not at that time, but--"
1989.88-952,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1199.953,1222.367,"Under your rationale, would it be permissible for the United States, after the whole claims process is completed, then to say we think the claimants should pay the expenses, and then assess it at that time, rather than after claims are filed but before judgments or awards are issued."
1989.88-952,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1227.067,1237.953,"--I think that that would meet the standards this Court has applied in its retroactivity cases, yes, but this is an easier case because Sperry--"
1989.88-952,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1237.953,1245.169,Would you say the same thing if the assessment also included the use of the claims Tribunal by unsuccessful claimants?
1989.88-952,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1253.713,1264.568,"--The, the fee could have been assessed against all claimants who invoked the Tribunal, but Congress chose not to do it that way."
1989.88-952,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1271.378,1274.408,I understand.
1989.88-952,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1274.408,1281.716,And Sperry and Iran did not have to seek a payment out of the security account or an award from the Tribunal.
1989.88-952,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1308.456,1312.58,You say Sperry did not have to seek an award from the Tribunal.
1989.88-952,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1315.251,1324.747,"Well, that depended entirely on settlement negotiations between the parties to the dispute, Sperry and Iran."
1989.88-952,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1353.814,1358.919,Never mind options that depend upon Iran's agreement to the options.
1989.88-952,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1367.541,1371.415,"No other option within its own control, but--"
1989.88-952,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1371.415,1371.572,All right.
1989.88-952,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1375.398,1377.835,"--Well, it was Sperry who undertook to do business with Iran."
1989.88-952,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1405.619,1413.977,"Yes, but even with regard to the settlement that did not come from the payment from the Tribunal, they had first filed a claim with the Tribunal, had they not?"
1989.88-952,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1413.977,1415.163,They had.
1989.88-952,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1415.163,1423.159,"So that they really, apparently at that time, didn't have any alternative but... for seeking relief, except through the Tribunal."
1989.88-952,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1423.159,1427.19,"Well, that may well have been a part of their negotiation strategy."
1989.88-952,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1435.092,1438.887,Or the settlement may have been part of their litigating strategy.
1989.88-952,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1438.887,1441.901,That is quite true.
1989.88-952,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1521.401,1523.213,"Very well, Mr. Wallace."
1989.88-952,1,32856,john_d_seiver,,1525.635,1533.789,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.88-952,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1693.131,1703.439,"Well, might not this come out of the Curtiss Wright doctrine where they say in foreign affairs, there is a much looser legislative delegation doctrine, and that sort of thing?"
1989.88-952,1,32856,john_d_seiver,,1703.439,1706.063,"Well, we're not really in foreign affairs anymore."
1989.88-952,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1730.194,1739.878,But the fact that the deduction occurs in New York surely can't be a complete answer if a good deal of the rest of the transaction relates to foreign affairs.
1989.88-952,1,32856,john_d_seiver,,1741.347,1754.013,"Well, yes, I agree that is not a complete answer, but it demonstrates that really what is going on here is something that is removed from foreign relations and the general concept of what the executive has power to do in furthering foreign relations."
1989.88-952,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1817.143,1819.253,Where did the Tribunal set?
1989.88-952,1,32856,john_d_seiver,,1819.253,1820.564,"In The Hague, in the Netherlands."
1989.88-952,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1820.564,1820.955,In The Hague.
1989.88-952,1,32856,john_d_seiver,,1820.955,1832.48,"When treasury went about promulgating its directive license, it made no reasonable calculation of what the costs were that could be attributable to successful claimants."
1989.88-952,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1862.267,1865.639,"May I ask, may I ask you a question about this point, Mr. Seiver."
1989.88-952,1,32856,john_d_seiver,,1894.784,1895.83,"--I think not, Your Honor."
1989.88-952,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1895.83,1896.939,You think not.
1989.88-952,1,32856,john_d_seiver,,1896.939,1912.386,"I think that that, there would be a retroactive problem, but even as to cases that were pending, or the day before they were filed, we have a situation where a revenue-related assessment, that is purportedly to reimburse costs, has no relationship to the costs that are sought to be reimbursed."
1989.88-952,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2073.775,2075.554,"That is notice, isn't it?"
1989.88-952,1,32856,john_d_seiver,,2075.554,2091.376,"Well, I think, Your Honor, if we take any illegal act by an executive agency as notice that that could be retroactively authorized by Congress at some future time when it wished, then we are subject to no control on the authority of the executive."
1989.88-952,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2117.522,2132.923,"Is it your view that the government here is bound by the claims court opinion that there was no authority in the various acts the government relied on for the assessment of this fee, prior to the congressional adoption of it?"
1989.88-952,1,32856,john_d_seiver,,2132.923,2138.904,"Well, bound to the extent that they did not ever pursue another course of action except to go to Congress to ask--"
1989.88-952,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2138.904,2141.06,"Well, I mean bound in the sense of res judicata."
1989.88-952,1,32856,john_d_seiver,,2141.06,2148.729,"--Well, Your Honor, it has been mooted, and I am not sure whether or not we could have an argument for res judicata, but probably collateral estoppel."
1989.88-952,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2152.774,2157.116,"Well, I don't... thinking it over though, this is the same case, isn't it?"
1989.88-952,1,32856,john_d_seiver,,2157.116,2158.146,"--Yes, it is, Your Honor."
1989.88-952,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2158.146,2161.066,"Well, then, there wouldn't be any collateral estoppel."
1989.88-952,1,32856,john_d_seiver,,2163.956,2165.768,"Well, there wasn't a final judgment."
1989.88-952,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2189.9,2197.677,"Excuse me, why is it that the government can apply a tax retroactively, but not a fee of this sort?"
1989.88-952,1,32856,john_d_seiver,,2197.677,2204.284,"--Well, Justice Scalia, when a tax is applied retroactively, we look at it basically as it is involuntary."
1989.88-952,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2232.788,2239.974,Now how much voluntary... it seems to me you are really trying to ride two horses going in different directions in some of your argument.
1989.88-952,1,32856,john_d_seiver,,2256.59,2258.059,"Well, Your Honor, you are absolutely right."
1989.88-952,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2268.196,2269.038,Is that so?
1989.88-952,1,32856,john_d_seiver,,2269.444,2277.378,"--Well, generally that is the process of determining when someone has gotten a special benefit that is not available to everyone else."
1989.88-952,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2277.378,2287.547,"I can impose a user fee for water, couldn't I, for water services from the municipality, and I guess you would have a choice to not have any water, if you consider that a choice."
1989.88-952,1,32856,john_d_seiver,,2289.186,2296.871,"We had a choice to give up a $2.8 million settlement, or an $18 million claim, however we looked at it, but is that really a choice?"
1989.88-952,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2296.871,2297.418,"No, it isn't."
1989.88-952,1,32856,john_d_seiver,,2300.105,2311.491,"Well, Your Honor, as far as the involuntariness aspect, that has been our main argument, and we only brought up the voluntariness to try and say this is not really a user fee, it is a tax."
1989.88-952,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2311.491,2316.27,"Are you saying a user fee can't be charged for items that are involuntary, is that it?"
1989.88-952,1,32856,john_d_seiver,,2316.27,2320.221,"I believe if it is involuntary, then it is really a tax, because you don't have a choice."
1989.88-952,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2387.319,2395.067,"But the government says the fees were less than compensatory for its expenses, which would surely put a limit on the percentage."
1989.88-952,1,32856,john_d_seiver,,2395.067,2399.423,"Well, Your Honor, but what are the expenses that are being incurred on our benefit?"
1989.88-952,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2420.305,2429.958,"That may not be an answer to some other points in your case, but it seems to me it is an answer that this is no different than an 80 percent charge, or a 50 percent charge."
1989.88-952,1,32856,john_d_seiver,,2429.958,2437.814,"Well, I am trying to analyze it in the terms of what was the legislative and administrative record at the time these were imposed."
1989.88-952,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2462.21,2471.254,"Well, how much chance for success would you have had in your litigation in the district court if the president hadn't frozen the assets?"
1989.88-952,1,32856,john_d_seiver,,2471.254,2474.268,"Well, I guess we'll never really know what we would have done."
1989.88-952,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2480.781,2484.264,"We all know that there are judgments and there are judgments, though."
1989.88-952,1,32856,john_d_seiver,,2484.264,2492.511,"--Perhaps we would have had a judgment for, let's say, the $18 million of our claim, and we'd go to Europe; we'd try to find some Iranian assets."
1989.88-952,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2570.932,2578.086,"Mr. Seiver, you assert two reasons for that, two principal reasons for that, I think."
1989.88-952,1,32856,john_d_seiver,,2593.298,2598.234,"Well, the other bank claimants... we had no choice to take anything but our payments from the security account."
1989.88-952,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2604.121,2610.292,"But some victorious claimants did not have to use that procedure, and therefore didn't pay any fee."
1989.88-952,1,32856,john_d_seiver,,2610.292,2611.245,That is correct.
1989.88-952,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2611.245,2621.896,And that is one respect in which you claim you have been treated inequitably in the sense that what you pay doesn't have any relationship to how you benefit.
1989.88-952,1,32856,john_d_seiver,,2621.896,2622.146,"Yes, it is."
1989.88-952,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2622.146,2628.111,And the other respect is that the losers get as much benefit as the winners.
1989.88-952,1,32856,john_d_seiver,,2628.111,2628.846,Yes.
1989.88-952,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2650.978,2657.694,"Let's just take one of those, the fact that the fees are only assessed against the victorious claimants."
1989.88-952,1,32856,john_d_seiver,,2664.567,2665.877,"--No, it isn't, Your Honor."
1989.88-952,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2692.977,2695.007,That is water over the dam.
1989.88-952,1,32856,john_d_seiver,,2714.999,2720.012,"--Well, that contradicts the entire process of this country's adjudicatory process where losers pay costs."
1989.88-952,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2722.793,2723.574,I didn't ask that.
1989.88-952,1,32856,john_d_seiver,,2727.259,2731.117,--I think... I am using the prior existing policy of showing that it is irrational.
1989.88-952,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2736.037,2738.037,Anything else has to be irrational therefore?
1989.88-952,1,32856,john_d_seiver,,2738.037,2745.267,"--Well, not necessarily everything else has to be irrational, Justice Scalia, but if we look at it, at least we know when we go to court what we're in for."
1989.88-952,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2745.267,2755.357,"But those are two different kinds of costs, the costs that are assessed now against losers in favor of winners are the out of pocket costs of the party."
1989.88-952,1,32856,john_d_seiver,,2769.664,2770.305,"Well, Your Honor, yes."
1989.88-952,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2792.138,2792.654,"No, but wait."
1989.88-952,1,32856,john_d_seiver,,2820.003,2821.3,"Well, in my mind, yes."
1989.88-952,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2894.207,2897.424,"May I make sure about one point, Mr. Seiver."
1989.88-952,1,32856,john_d_seiver,,2909.436,2915.699,"--I think that is a very, much more difficult question, and one again which we don't have to answer, but I will venture one."
1989.88-952,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2938.501,2943.141,"In the practical matter, you make a very forceful argument, that your choices were quite limited."
1989.88-952,1,32856,john_d_seiver,,2957.494,2971.582,"--Well, we might have added something to our claim to include the possibility of recovering that award from Iran, so instead of taking 2.8 million we would have taken 2.8 million, five hundred thousand dollars, or something that would have at least accounted for that."
1989.88-952,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2974.034,2974.534,I see.
1989.88-952,1,32856,john_d_seiver,,2985.703,2987.561,"--Well, this was our agreement."
1989.88-952,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2988.499,2992.762,"--You got as much money from Iran as you could get from Iran, I hope, didn't you?"
1989.88-952,1,32856,john_d_seiver,,2992.762,2999.182,"Well, Your Honor, to... what went into the decision to take that amount of money at that point--"
1989.88-952,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2999.182,3008.881,"I mean, to say I would have got another 42 if I had known I would have had this expense, my goodness, I should think the shareholders of Sperry would be very upset to know you just left $42,000 on the table."
1989.88-952,1,32856,john_d_seiver,,3008.881,3012.207,"--Well, Your Honor, we sued to get the $<forty-two thousand> [= 42,000] back, and had won."
1989.88-952,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3112.417,3113.931,"Thank you, Mr. Seiver."
1989.88-952,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3115.65,3118.337,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice."
1989.88-952,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3262.214,3276.053,"I agree with that, Mr. Wallace, and it doesn't seem to me that to make the winner pay is very bad, but I don't understand why only those who use the particular payment mechanism should be those that were hit with the fee."
1989.88-952,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3277.959,3291.375,"--Well, that... there is considerable expense involved in maintaining the security account and the services supplied by the federal reserve bank."
1989.88-952,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3291.375,3298.091,"True, but you didn't calculate the total amount of the fees that had to be collected solely on the basis of that account."
1989.88-952,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3306.088,3330.5,"Well, that is a, an easy method to calculate what bottom line benefit from the whole mechanism a particular claimant is receiving through a payment being made through the security account and through the rest of the mechanism."
1989.88-952,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3411.031,3412.718,"Thank you, Mr. Wallace."
