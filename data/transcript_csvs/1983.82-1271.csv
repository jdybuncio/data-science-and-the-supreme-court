1983.82-1271,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,69.977,"Mr. Frey, I think you may proceed when you're ready."
1983.82-1271,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,69.977,72.779,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1983.82-1271,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,238.087,241.289,"Mr. Frey, may I ask you a preliminary question?"
1983.82-1271,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,241.289,241.856,Certainly.
1983.82-1271,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,241.856,253.18,And that relates to whether the Plaintiffs here in the case below had standing under the Lyons decision of this Court last time.
1983.82-1271,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,253.18,254.214,"Yes, I believe that they do."
1983.82-1271,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,255.549,257.949,"I know you don't, but why not?"
1983.82-1271,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,257.949,278.062,"Well, the reason I think they do is that these work place surveys are recurrent and at garment factories where these individuals were employed it is likely that there will be, and in fact at Davis Pleating Company there were two surveys during the year in question."
1983.82-1271,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,278.062,282.616,"And is that likely to be repeated in the future, assuming the practice?"
1983.82-1271,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,282.616,285.818,It is likely to be repeated if the Ninth Circuit's decision is reversed.
1983.82-1271,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,336.934,343.338,Is there something in the record about that... about the fact that these aren't just random?
1983.82-1271,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,345.621,348.123,"--Well, I think there is, yes."
1983.82-1271,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,372.357,374.057,"Mr. Frey, is an administrative warrant possible?"
1983.82-1271,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,374.057,378.594,There were warrants in two of the three searches in this case.
1983.82-1271,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,411.982,423.456,What would be the situation if the employees were working on a paving project or building a bridge out in the open... no enclosure at all?
1983.82-1271,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,423.456,437.815,"Well, the Court of Appeals decision relied for its holding, in part, on the fact that the factories are enclosed and that the exits... that agents were stationed at the exits."
1983.82-1271,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,450.107,456.211,Could a warrant be obtained to check out in open spaces?
1983.82-1271,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,456.211,456.394,No.
1983.82-1271,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,473.055,474.438,"Mr. Frey, may I ask?"
1983.82-1271,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,513.098,527.607,I think that would pose some interesting and difficult questions whether... if you had this abstract 20 or 25 percent probability that the individual you stopped had committed a crime but no specific information.
1983.82-1271,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,549.104,551.806,"No, but the interrogations were random, were they not?"
1983.82-1271,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,551.806,558.209,"Well, as I... the interrogations are not random but the interrogations--"
1983.82-1271,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,558.209,559.578,"Well, they are in the sentence, are they not?"
1983.82-1271,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,559.578,560.211,--But they are not.
1983.82-1271,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,562.196,562.813,I know.
1983.82-1271,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,566.748,570.636,"Well, but the Fourth Amendment doesn't apply on interrogations."
1983.82-1271,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,583.277,589.781,"Well, Mr. Frey, is there not a seizure or detention when the agents question the employee?"
1983.82-1271,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,602.071,602.487,I think that is absolutely clear.
1983.82-1271,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,621.883,623.484,"If he says it's none of your business, you don't seize him?"
1983.82-1271,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,623.484,623.967,We don't.
1983.82-1271,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,635.475,637.392,What happens if the person refuses to answer the question?
1983.82-1271,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,637.392,639.51,You move on to another person.
1983.82-1271,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,675.517,686.575,"Mr. Frey, what if there is a particularized suspicion about a particular person and the agent goes up to him and says ""Are you a citizen""?"
1983.82-1271,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,691.762,694.264,"--Well, that would be the--"
1983.82-1271,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,694.264,695.931,He hasn't got probable cause.
1983.82-1271,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,695.931,702.937,"--Well, there is nothing... that is the problem that's inherent in any Terry stop situation, if the individual refuses--"
1983.82-1271,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,702.937,704.086,"Well, then he can walk away."
1983.82-1271,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,704.086,709.523,"--If probable cause does not develop during the course of the detention, then the detention must be terminated."
1983.82-1271,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,709.523,710.156,Exactly.
1983.82-1271,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,720.814,734.639,"Well, that's what the Court said in Florida against Royer... even questions of people who they suspect, as long as it is not accompanied by conduct that would lead the person reasonably to believe that they were not free to leave."
1983.82-1271,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,734.639,744.429,"But if you have particularized suspicion but not probable cause, you may momentarily detain them to ask a question; is that right or not?"
1983.82-1271,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,744.429,752.702,"Yes, you may detain them and you may ask a question and if in the course of that brief detention probable cause develops, you may then arrest him."
1983.82-1271,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,752.702,753.285,But if he says
1983.82-1271,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,760.273,772.581,You are out of luck except in circumstances where there may be some other brief investigative measure that you can take while you're holding him that might clarify the situation and develop probable cause.
1983.82-1271,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,772.581,786.423,"But it's your position that the reasonable suspicion that's required here is not reasonable suspicion of illegal presence in the country, but merely reasonable suspicion of Hispanic origin?"
1983.82-1271,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,786.423,799.064,"Well, let me define somewhat the issues in this case because I think it's very important and I think the Ninth Circuit's opinion and the Respondents' brief is quite confusing on this."
1983.82-1271,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,831.118,836.42,"Well, but you've already answered me that you say the questioning does not involve a seizure."
1983.82-1271,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,836.42,837.106,That's correct.
1983.82-1271,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,837.106,846.795,But you said in response to Justice White it might involve a momentary detention of the Terry-type to ask questions.
1983.82-1271,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,846.795,847.328,"No, no, no, no."
1983.82-1271,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,905.017,911.07,"Well, it does present, does it not, situations where individuals were questioned?"
1983.82-1271,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,917.058,925.247,"Yes, but as I said earlier, the Fourth Amendment does not regulate questioning; it regulates seizures."
1983.82-1271,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,927.247,928.497,You said there were no seizures in this case.
1983.82-1271,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,928.497,929.13,--Hum?
1983.82-1271,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,929.13,931.115,And there were no individual seizures?
1983.82-1271,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,931.115,949.26,"There were no... I maintain as stoutly as I am able to that there were no individual seizures in this case, and if you look at the interchanges Correa was not asked any questions during the first survey and during the second survey; she was asked if she was a citizen, said she was, and the agent moved on."
1983.82-1271,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,949.26,960.218,What are they... what do the agents do if there is someone that they want to ask questions and the person just leaves the premises?
1983.82-1271,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,963.086,972.042,"Well, if they do not have a reasonable suspicion that the person is an alien unlawfully present in the country or has committed some violation of the immigration laws, they let him leave."
1983.82-1271,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,985.584,988.386,"Mr. Frey, can I ask you a question on this point?"
1983.82-1271,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,988.386,988.819,Yes.
1983.82-1271,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,988.819,996.474,One of my problems is that I think that what one might normally expect in the way of findings of fact are really quite sparse in this case.
1983.82-1271,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1002.961,1005.33,"No, I think you have to look at the testimony."
1983.82-1271,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1011.384,1012.601,That's really what troubles me.
1983.82-1271,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1012.601,1015.186,--I would say there is no dispute about the material facts.
1983.82-1271,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1022.625,1030.814,"But should we have to look at the testimony in a case of this kind that comes in this way, because I read the briefs and I get an entirely different impression of the facts from both sides."
1983.82-1271,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1033.347,1035.199,"Well, you can get a different impression from the adjectives."
1983.82-1271,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1035.199,1037.468,And in a summary judgment case that normally isn't true.
1983.82-1271,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1051.561,1053.594,"Well, they did in this case."
1983.82-1271,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1053.594,1054.263,Pardon me?
1983.82-1271,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1054.263,1055.713,The Respondents did.
1983.82-1271,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1057.715,1061.167,"And we have to read the testimony to so conclude, don't we?"
1983.82-1271,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1061.167,1061.934,No.
1983.82-1271,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1062.917,1072.474,What I'm really asking... I won't take your time up... but is it not possibly a case which requires some findings of fact to know exactly what should be done with it?
1983.82-1271,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1072.474,1101.994,"--Well, I think it's a case in which it would have been perhaps helpful to have some findings of fact, but if the Court of Appeals is right in its legal conclusions it makes no difference whether anybody was stopped or would have been stopped, because the Court of Appeals says that the fact that agents were visible in the doorways was itself enough to constitute a seizure and violate the Fourth Amendment, and on that basis an injunction has been issued against--"
1983.82-1271,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1101.994,1103.127,I understand your position there.
1983.82-1271,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1113.533,1114.717,"--Well, there were cross motions for summary judgment."
1983.82-1271,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1114.717,1119.503,"Well, I understand that, but is that your position... that we should reenter the District Court's summary judgment?"
1983.82-1271,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1119.503,1127.375,"That would be our position, I think, but we are into some areas of civil procedure that I don't feel terribly comfortable with."
1983.82-1271,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1127.375,1134.965,"Aren't you just objecting to the holding of the Court of Appeals as a matter of law, that the whole factory is seized?"
1983.82-1271,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1134.965,1137.417,Yes.
1983.82-1271,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1150.908,1152.025,Do we have to reach anything else?
1983.82-1271,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1152.025,1155.878,"--The entire Court of Appeals decision, I think, falls because there is no suggestion--"
1983.82-1271,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1155.878,1158.246,"And then we remand for further proceedings, if there are any."
1983.82-1271,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1158.246,1161.365,"--I would do that if I were in your shoes, yes."
1983.82-1271,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1161.365,1165.5,"Mr. Frey, you identified two separate questions."
1983.82-1271,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1168.852,1169.336,No.
1983.82-1271,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1214.75,1221.571,"Well, what evidence is there that individuals were declined the right to walk away from--"
1983.82-1271,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1221.571,1242.234,"Well, I wanted to talk a bit about what evidence there is in this case, what allegations there are in the complaint, and what evidence there is in the deposition testimony of anything that might be argued, and my opponents do argue, are in some instances Fourth Amendment violations."
1983.82-1271,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1453.103,1455.489,"--When you handcuffed somebody, you sort of seize them, don't you?"
1983.82-1271,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1455.489,1457.722,"--Well, but there may have been probable cause to do so."
1983.82-1271,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1459.857,1462.209,But you're arguing that he wasn't seized.
1983.82-1271,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1462.209,1468.113,"--I'm not... if her testimony is accurate, I would say that he was seized, I would agree."
1983.82-1271,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1474.951,1475.867,Whether there was an illegal seizure.
1983.82-1271,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1475.867,1492.46,I would also like to direct the Court's attention on this question of whether the entire work force was seized to the factors that the Court of Appeals relied on in holding that the entire work force was seized.
1983.82-1271,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1568.393,1572.78,Are these agents in uniform?
1983.82-1271,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1572.78,1573.397,--They are not in uniform.
1983.82-1271,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1595.628,1599.015,"They were free to leave, too."
1983.82-1271,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1599.015,1599.648,They were free to leave.
1983.82-1271,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1771.408,1773.475,"Mr. Frey, may I ask you a question on--"
1983.82-1271,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1773.475,1774.177,Certainly.
1983.82-1271,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1774.177,1776.227,"--on my time, if I have any."
1983.82-1271,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1784.966,1787.402,I don't remember whether I heard the argument.
1983.82-1271,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1787.402,1789.354,"Well, you are familiar with the case, I am sure."
1983.82-1271,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1789.354,1789.87,Somewhat.
1983.82-1271,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1789.87,1797.96,"It is the law of the United States that an employer violates no crime or no law when he employs aliens, isn't it?"
1983.82-1271,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1826.377,1826.979,I see no inconsistency.
1983.82-1271,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1826.979,1827.479,--None whatever?
1983.82-1271,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1827.479,1828.112,None whatever.
1983.82-1271,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1828.112,1828.912,None whatever?
1983.82-1271,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1828.912,1831.764,"Not the slightest, not the slightest."
1983.82-1271,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1834.816,1836.351,"I understand that, but I'm talking--"
1983.82-1271,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1836.351,1837.635,The employer has no duty.
1983.82-1271,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1851.527,1854.479,--I'm afraid you've misunderstood the import of my question.
1983.82-1271,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1854.479,1855.729,I'm not sure I did.
1983.82-1271,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1855.729,1857.664,I'm talking about the policy of the United States.
1983.82-1271,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1863.152,1863.952,"Well, if Congress wants--"
1983.82-1271,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1863.952,1867.704,--nine million Americans unemployed in the United States that the--
1983.82-1271,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1867.704,1880.28,"--Sure-tan turns on the problem of the special policies which... of the National Labor Relations Act, which may or may not control the result in that case."
1983.82-1271,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1897.223,1899.175,--I'd like for you to understand my question.
1983.82-1271,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1912.918,1915.453,"Well, perhaps so."
1983.82-1271,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1915.453,1919.255,Am I correct that this is a non-union shop we are dealing with here?
1983.82-1271,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1919.255,1920.789,"No, this is a union shop."
1983.82-1271,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1920.789,1921.607,It is a union shop.
1983.82-1271,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1921.607,1922.457,A union shop.
1983.82-1271,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1930.462,1934.264,Mr. Fenton.
1983.82-1271,1,26995,henry_r_fenton,,1934.264,1937.283,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1983.82-1271,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2102.674,2109.412,"Under the routine of the workplace, were they allowed to go out whenever they wanted to?"
1983.82-1271,1,26995,henry_r_fenton,,2109.412,2115.149,"They were allowed to go out whenever they wanted to, certainly."
1983.82-1271,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2115.149,2118.934,"So they could go across the street and get a cup of coffee, leave for the day?"
1983.82-1271,1,26995,henry_r_fenton,,2118.934,2120.886,"That was their freedom as American citizens, certainly."
1983.82-1271,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2120.886,2127.124,"Well, how about the rule... did the employer just let them take off whenever they felt like it during working hours?"
1983.82-1271,1,26995,henry_r_fenton,,2127.124,2144.585,"Well, no, the employer didn't, but I think our point is that in a free society in that setting if they had known in advance the kind of intrusion they would have been subjected to, I would submit that a reasonable worker under those circumstances would have chosen not to remain at work, Your Honor."
1983.82-1271,2,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3941.918,3943.954,"A couple of points, Mr. Chief Justice."
1983.82-1271,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3995.053,3997.738,"Mr. Frey, what standing do these four people have to seek an injunction?"
1983.82-1271,2,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3997.738,4013.764,"Well, I think they have standing to seek an injunction on the ground that the Ninth Circuit... if the Ninth Circuit is right, they are being illegally seized and they are exposed to a threat, and given the number of illegal aliens--"
1983.82-1271,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4013.764,4014.283,I know.
1983.82-1271,2,15933,andrew_l_frey,,4025.406,4029.793,--Probably a declaratory judgment would suffice.
1983.82-1271,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4034.012,4034.528,"--No, no."
1983.82-1271,2,15933,andrew_l_frey,,4042.533,4046.671,"Well, they are exposed to a future--"
1983.82-1271,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4046.671,4053.408,Does the government represent they are going to sweep this particular factory again?
1983.82-1271,2,15933,andrew_l_frey,,4053.408,4054.058,--We won't tell you when.
1983.82-1271,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4054.058,4059.062,"No, of course, not, but you are going to... the likelihood is--"
1983.82-1271,2,15933,andrew_l_frey,,4059.062,4063.014,"Given the results that we've had at these places, they are likely targets."
1983.82-1271,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4150.453,4151.02,"Thank you, gentlemen."
