2006.05-9264,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,4.874,We'll hear argument first this morning in James versus United States.
2006.05-9264,0,18654,craig_l_crawford,,6.686,9.434,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2006.05-9264,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,136.601,146.753,"If we were looking at attempted generic burglary of a residence, wouldn't that involve conduct that presents the serious potential risk of physical injury to another?"
2006.05-9264,0,18654,craig_l_crawford,,146.753,167.465,"--Your Honor, in Taylor, this Court was clear that under enumerated burglary or generic burglary, the offense becomes a... has that serious potential risk when the person actually enters the dwelling or enters the structure; and under an attempted burglary, at least in Florida and in most other States, that act has not occurred."
2006.05-9264,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,170.821,182.317,"If the would-be burglar is climbing through the window or on a ladder with the intent to climb through the window, wouldn't that involve almost the same risk or maybe the same risk?"
2006.05-9264,0,18654,craig_l_crawford,,182.317,188.393,"If the conduct... again, we're looking at, then, a fact-based inquiry."
2006.05-9264,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,213.351,220.083,"But in Florida, that would be burglary itself, right, because it covers the curtilage around the house?"
2006.05-9264,0,18654,craig_l_crawford,,220.083,231.751,"The curtilage is a unique concept, I guess in Florida, in that the curtilage is the enclosed space around the house that has some kind of enclosure, whether by fence or whether by bushes."
2006.05-9264,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,240.857,241.465,Right.
2006.05-9264,0,18654,craig_l_crawford,,258.053,266.908,"Well, it would be a burglary in the State of Florida, but under the test enunciated in Taylor, it wouldn't qualify because Taylor was very specific."
2006.05-9264,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,277.373,285.714,"Well, you could do it in a noncurtilage burglary State simply by putting the ladder up to the window and getting on the first rung of the ladder."
2006.05-9264,0,18654,craig_l_crawford,,305.33,310.906,"Well, trying to use the Court's words in Taylor, Taylor talked about that--"
2006.05-9264,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,310.906,312.967,"Well, how about my question first?"
2006.05-9264,0,18654,craig_l_crawford,,312.967,313.358,--Okay.
2006.05-9264,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,313.358,322.261,"I mean, haven't you in the words of the statute, created the potential for the risk when you take that substantial step by starting up the ladder?"
2006.05-9264,0,18654,craig_l_crawford,,322.261,332.132,"If you started up the ladder and that's the way the attempted burglary conviction came down, it would be a lot closer call to say that would be a potential risk."
2006.05-9264,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,336.473,342.173,But you wouldn't analyze it on the basis of whether this defendant started up the ladder.
2006.05-9264,0,18654,craig_l_crawford,,355.325,359.511,"That's the way that we submit it has to be done, and you wouldn't be getting to those facts."
2006.05-9264,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,359.511,377.065,"No, but I thought your argument was that that analysis would not lead to the result unfavorable to your client because the nature of starting up the ladder did not create or could not reasonably be seen as creating this kind of risk."
2006.05-9264,0,18654,craig_l_crawford,,403.712,405.446,I think I understand.
2006.05-9264,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,422.438,429.483,And that's why simply charging attempted burglary will never satisfy the statute under a Taylor analysis as you understand it.
2006.05-9264,0,18654,craig_l_crawford,,429.483,430.138,That's correct.
2006.05-9264,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,430.138,434.715,"But even if it would, that's only one manner of attempt."
2006.05-9264,0,18654,craig_l_crawford,,498.282,503.982,"Of those four, extortion does seem to potentially have the least risk of all those crimes enumerated."
2006.05-9264,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,504.326,506.311,"And what's a potential risk, by the way?"
2006.05-9264,0,18654,craig_l_crawford,,506.311,508.029,--A potential risk--
2006.05-9264,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,508.029,509.029,A potential potential?
2006.05-9264,0,18654,craig_l_crawford,,511.95,522.648,"--In the Government's... in the Respondent's brief, they talked about how risk and potential and serious, some of those worlds potentially knock each other out, and I apologize for using that very word, but--"
2006.05-9264,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,522.648,524.679,You think potential risk is just risk really?
2006.05-9264,0,18654,craig_l_crawford,,524.679,526.334,--I think it is a risk.
2006.05-9264,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,526.334,532.503,"But isn't one way of looking at it... I mean, I, when I read it, you know, I thought it's just redundant."
2006.05-9264,0,18654,craig_l_crawford,,539.017,557.571,"If that were true, I mean, Congress when they wrote the statute, and in 924(e)(2)(B)(ii), or (e)(2)(B)(ii)(1), they specifically enumerated attempted crimes to qualify under that violence."
2006.05-9264,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,569.051,571.628,Specifically deleted or didn't--
2006.05-9264,0,18654,craig_l_crawford,,571.628,573.284,"They did not include it, and under--"
2006.05-9264,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,573.284,575.455,--That's quite different than specifically deleting it.
2006.05-9264,0,18654,craig_l_crawford,,578.111,585.763,"--In 1984 actually, there was a proposal where burglary would qualify and attempted burglary would qualify."
2006.05-9264,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,598.899,610.91,"So, do I understand your submission to be that putting a ladder against the side of a house to attempt burglary, starting up the ladder, that that generically does not pose a potential risk of physical injury?"
2006.05-9264,0,18654,craig_l_crawford,,610.91,633.713,"If that were the only way to prove an attempted burglary within a State, if that would be... that would be the requirement, the legal requirement that you have to put the ladder against the house and that's an element of the offense, that to me would be a much closer call; but still, under the analysis that we have provided the Court with the Russello presumption, it should not qualify."
2006.05-9264,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,643.429,651.269,We understand from your friend on the other side that an overt act toward fulfilling the attempt is required under Florida law.
2006.05-9264,0,18654,craig_l_crawford,,655.595,657.297,Correct.
2006.05-9264,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,657.297,660.421,You've got to take an affirmative step toward accomplishing the burglary.
2006.05-9264,0,18654,craig_l_crawford,,660.421,664.014,It is an overt act that is beyond mere thinking about it.
2006.05-9264,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,664.014,666.231,"Why doesn't anybody... you know, count."
2006.05-9264,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,707.855,711.338,We're not going to be able to do that in time to decide this case.
2006.05-9264,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,711.338,715.009,"But wouldn't it be, as a method of approaching--"
2006.05-9264,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,715.009,717.945,It would also keep the professors from other mischief.
2006.05-9264,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,719.147,726.316,But what do we know about the dimensions of the Florida attempt crime?
2006.05-9264,0,18654,craig_l_crawford,,752.54,757.772,"Well, it's not really a step analysis, a substantial step analysis."
2006.05-9264,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,763.833,765.301,What is that concretely?
2006.05-9264,0,18654,craig_l_crawford,,778.826,803.098,"--If you had a diagram of the person's house and you had burglary tools in your car and you had maybe even called to make sure the business was closed and you were driving there and as you're driving there you're telling the person sitting beside you: I'm going to break into that, you know, business at 254 Main Street."
2006.05-9264,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,810.016,824.855,"I guess we have to decide how many attempts involve that kind of initial action, which doesn't seem very physical threatening, and how many of them involve putting a ladder up against the side of the house."
2006.05-9264,0,18654,craig_l_crawford,,841.051,858.731,"That may be... that may be a very difficult question to answer, and maybe the Respondent had that obligation in the district court, because they have the obligation to prove that this enhancement has that substantial or that serious potential risk of physical injury to another and of course they didn't do that."
2006.05-9264,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,883.019,918.832,"May I ask you this question: It seems to me there are two ways to read the burglary, arson or extortion examples: That they are clear examples of crimes that would involve harm to individuals, physical injury to another; or they are put in the statute to say, even though they don't involve serious risk, these specific crimes will be covered, because your statistic of 3 percent suggests that burglary itself probably would not qualify as a crime that presents a serious risk of physical injury, but the statute nevertheless defines it."
2006.05-9264,0,18654,craig_l_crawford,,928.048,949.162,"--I think it can be read either way, although I think even the Government's brief in... or the Respondent's brief in Taylor talks about extortion and burglary being crimes that can be committed with no risk of physical injury to another person and yet Congress still specifically enumerated those--"
2006.05-9264,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,949.162,953.302,"Mr. Crawford, if you had that meaning in mind, you would not have used the word ""otherwise""."
2006.05-9264,0,18654,craig_l_crawford,,997.363,1010.124,"--Using that analysis, it's hard to figure out, but again the Government had this obligation or we submit the Government had this obligation, and they've not shown an attempted burglary to be any more dangerous."
2006.05-9264,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1010.124,1017.417,"Do you think that, is conspiracy to commit burglary a crime that poses a serious potential risk as burglary does?"
2006.05-9264,0,18654,craig_l_crawford,,1017.417,1027.897,"In Florida, or in the Eleventh Circuit, they have determined that conspiracy to commit enumerated offenses do present that serious potential risk."
2006.05-9264,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1027.897,1030.771,"--Sorry, go ahead."
2006.05-9264,0,18654,craig_l_crawford,,1030.771,1033.675,So in the Eleventh Circuit they have determined that.
2006.05-9264,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1044.703,1045.468,Doesn't that seem like a fine line?
2006.05-9264,0,18654,craig_l_crawford,,1062.133,1067.177,They both present very little potential risk.
2006.05-9264,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1078.127,1079.985,You think the Eleventh Circuit is wrong?
2006.05-9264,0,18654,craig_l_crawford,,1079.985,1083.015,--I believe the Eleventh Circuit is wrong with conspiracy as well.
2006.05-9264,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1083.015,1105.459,"If we don't know and if I can't get too far with the language and I frankly could sit in my office looking at the computer screen I think for hours and I wouldn't be closer to knowing whether there is or is not a lot of injury that accompanies attempted burglary, but that is something that is possible to know."
2006.05-9264,0,18654,craig_l_crawford,,1139.399,1153.393,"Well, the sentencing commission when they were interpreting the career offender statute, or guidelines, they were looking at a guideline that is worded different than the--"
2006.05-9264,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1153.393,1170.667,"They're trying to find out the same answer to the same kind of question: How many of these attempted burglaries, how many burglaries, how many other crimes are accompanied by an individual being hurt?"
2006.05-9264,0,18654,craig_l_crawford,,1193.923,1207.543,"--Well, they came to that conclusion dealing with whether a career offender provision should include attempted burglary not under the armed career criminal statute and they specifically recognized that."
2006.05-9264,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1253.524,1262.131,"Mr. Crawford, we've held that the named crimes have to be considered generically according to their elements, right?"
2006.05-9264,0,18654,craig_l_crawford,,1309.064,1324.293,"Well, Taylor and Shepard both talk about that predicate offenses under 924(e) should be looked at in a... using a categorical approach, and the Court has talked about that being an approach looking to the elements of the offense."
2006.05-9264,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1324.293,1328.854,Was it referring to the residual category?
2006.05-9264,0,18654,craig_l_crawford,,1328.854,1332.04,It didn't specifically refer to the residual category.
2006.05-9264,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1333.132,1339.692,Maybe it's not too late to save ourselves from sending out legions of law professors to do studies.
2006.05-9264,0,18654,craig_l_crawford,,1339.692,1363.043,"--If the Court were to step back and say that the Mr. James' case there are no facts, so it may not make any difference for him because there's no facts to indicate what kind of burglary really occurred here."
2006.05-9264,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1363.043,1366.417,You mean no facts in the indictment or charging documents?
2006.05-9264,0,18654,craig_l_crawford,,1366.417,1366.839,Correct.
2006.05-9264,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1366.839,1368.931,But there is in the presentence report?
2006.05-9264,0,18654,craig_l_crawford,,1368.931,1370.884,That is correct.
2006.05-9264,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1375.741,1383.145,"You don't have any doubt that, at least with respect to two of the other named crimes, attempts would present a serious potential risk?"
2006.05-9264,0,18654,craig_l_crawford,,1390.86,1391.797,"Actually, no."
2006.05-9264,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1408.275,1412.617,Don't you think attempted use of explosives is at least as dangerous as extortion?
2006.05-9264,0,18654,craig_l_crawford,,1425.706,1438.606,"Getting back to your question, maybe this answers part of it: Although the Court... you asked, Justice Scalia, you asked a question about why can't we make this basically maybe a fact-based inquiry."
2006.05-9264,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1454.226,1465.517,"Mr. Crawford, does the record show that the facts in the PSR came from police reports rather than from a plea colloquy or someplace in the court records?"
2006.05-9264,0,18654,craig_l_crawford,,1465.517,1473.452,"The plea colloquy was not ever presented or produced, and it does show that they came from police reports."
2006.05-9264,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1473.452,1474.467,Where is that in the record?
2006.05-9264,0,18654,craig_l_crawford,,1474.467,1484.963,"I believe that is stated in the PSR regarding the facts that they alleged under the attempted burglary, which again were objected to."
2006.05-9264,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1497.302,1506.438,"Mr. Crawford, may I ask you a question about the relationship between generic burglary and what Florida takes as sufficient to show an attempt?"
2006.05-9264,0,18654,craig_l_crawford,,1534.787,1538.115,The evidence... I see my time is up.
2006.05-9264,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1551.78,1559.464,So there's no such thing as attempted entry of the curtilage as an attempt offense under burglary under Florida law.
2006.05-9264,0,18654,craig_l_crawford,,1559.464,1564.073,--Under Florida law attempting to enter the curtilage is an attempted burglary; it is the same thing.
2006.05-9264,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1567.775,1570.99,"Okay, so when you say dwelling you mean dwelling as defined to include curtilage."
2006.05-9264,0,18654,craig_l_crawford,,1570.99,1571.365,Correct.
2006.05-9264,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1571.365,1571.756,Okay.
2006.05-9264,0,18654,craig_l_crawford,,1571.756,1572.74,Thank you.
2006.05-9264,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1572.74,1573.444,"Thank you, Mr. Crawford."
2006.05-9264,1,32074,jonathan_l_marcus,,1579.567,1583.674,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
2006.05-9264,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1597.417,1618.987,"Mr. Marcus, do you agree with your brother's answer to my last question that there would be an attempt... could be an attempt under Florida law simply to take an overt... to commit an overt act toward entering the curtilage as distinct from entering a physical dwelling or a physical structure?"
2006.05-9264,1,32074,jonathan_l_marcus,,1618.987,1622.486,"Yes, while I would disagree with that, but while there are... with your characterization."
2006.05-9264,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1631.263,1632.95,We don't know basically what Florida law is?
2006.05-9264,1,32074,jonathan_l_marcus,,1634.981,1636.261,--Yes.
2006.05-9264,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1645.82,1670.044,"So that literally, I take it then if someone did have a fence around the house, and I, I... I walked from the sidewalk onto the lawn toward the fence, with the intent of getting over the fence, that would qualify then, as you understand it, as an attempted burglary under Florida law?"
2006.05-9264,1,32074,jonathan_l_marcus,,1670.044,1672.152,Yes... it could.
2006.05-9264,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1672.762,1681.306,Would that be true if I simply wanted to get into the... if my intent was to get on the other side of the fence but not into the dwelling?
2006.05-9264,1,32074,jonathan_l_marcus,,1685.273,1686.272,"--Well, I think--"
2006.05-9264,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1686.272,1688.896,Would that qualify as attempted burglary?
2006.05-9264,1,32074,jonathan_l_marcus,,1688.896,1690.224,--I think it could.
2006.05-9264,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1691.865,1702.392,"Doesn't that give you a pretty tough row to hoe, in saying that there is a sufficient potential risk of the sort of harm that qualifies under the act?"
2006.05-9264,1,32074,jonathan_l_marcus,,1702.392,1703.517,"--I don't think so, Your Honor."
2006.05-9264,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1780.001,1784.811,There are a number of Florida cases that involve open carports.
2006.05-9264,1,32074,jonathan_l_marcus,,1795.306,1804.553,"Well, I think under the current, I think under the current statute, it has been amended since, since 1993 and '94, and... which is relevant, the statute is relevant to this case."
2006.05-9264,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1863.734,1889.394,"So in an ordinary city street in Miami walking along the street, there are a lot of houses, and there's a little bit of lawn or bushes in front, and there's not a fence, because there isn't, or there aren't fences in many city blocks, a person goes up to the house and starts to monkey around with the window to raise it or whatever, that's attempted burglary, not burglary, in Florida?"
2006.05-9264,1,32074,jonathan_l_marcus,,1889.394,1891.315,That... yes.
2006.05-9264,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1893.673,1894.189,All right.
2006.05-9264,1,32074,jonathan_l_marcus,,1922.773,1930.065,"Well, I think... I don't think when Congress enacted this law that it expected the courts would have statistics available to--"
2006.05-9264,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1930.065,1936.391,How are you supposed to decide it if there's a question as there is this instance I think?
2006.05-9264,1,32074,jonathan_l_marcus,,1946.106,1947.605,"--Well, there are several things you can do."
2006.05-9264,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1949.917,1951.776,I read the text several times.
2006.05-9264,1,32074,jonathan_l_marcus,,1951.776,1958.055,Congress provided some guidance by setting out four examples of crimes that do present the type of risk they had in mind.
2006.05-9264,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1958.055,1958.665,Correct.
2006.05-9264,1,32074,jonathan_l_marcus,,1993.432,2003.662,"Well, I think... I think you have to consider what Congress's purpose... in enacting the statute, Congress directed your attention to the serious potential risk that an offense presents."
2006.05-9264,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2017.702,2029.432,"Mr. Marcus, it is a lot easier to do that with respect to the facts and circumstances of a particular crime than it is to do it generically... you know... picking out attempted burglary."
2006.05-9264,1,32074,jonathan_l_marcus,,2071.853,2075.929,"--Well, all that... this law has been interpreted for many years."
2006.05-9264,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2098.983,2106.48,"And would you agree, Mr. Marcus, that this Court's decision in Shepard excludes that interpretation?"
2006.05-9264,1,32074,jonathan_l_marcus,,2109.01,2117.429,"Well, I think the Court referred both in Taylor and Shepard to the... to Congress's approach."
2006.05-9264,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2123.131,2139.201,"Didn't we... didn't we also go further and say one reason to construe it that way is we don't want courts to have to be, in effect, having sort of subsidiary collateral trials after the fact, to establish... you know... the facts of old trials."
2006.05-9264,1,32074,jonathan_l_marcus,,2146.277,2147.947,--There was that as well.
2006.05-9264,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2165.331,2170.158,"Mr. Marcus, isn't there this... this linguistic problem with the statute anyway?"
2006.05-9264,1,32074,jonathan_l_marcus,,2189.821,2191.68,--And either--
2006.05-9264,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2191.68,2196.788,"Either means sometimes presents a potential risk of physical injury, then obviously they're all covered."
2006.05-9264,1,32074,jonathan_l_marcus,,2210.0,2211.25,--No.
2006.05-9264,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2218.168,2233.631,"If that were true, and if as your opponent said, that in actual burglaries there's only three percent of them actually involve risk to... of physical injury to another, then attempted burglary must necessarily be somewhat less than three percent."
2006.05-9264,1,32074,jonathan_l_marcus,,2236.849,2237.428,--I think it would.
2006.05-9264,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2239.098,2240.254,Why is it two or three percent?
2006.05-9264,1,32074,jonathan_l_marcus,,2240.254,2250.391,--The statistics he is referring to came out before Congress amended the statute in 1986 and expanded it and specifically enumerated burglary as one of the crimes that it thought paradigmatically presented a serious potential risk of injury.
2006.05-9264,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2250.391,2252.265,"Well, I don't think that's perfectly clear."
2006.05-9264,1,32074,jonathan_l_marcus,,2276.771,2283.55,"Well, this Court interpreted the statute that way in Taylor... I mean, I'm sorry, on page... on page 597 of Taylor."
2006.05-9264,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2318.442,2324.283,"That would be fine if burglary were the only thing that Congress said there, but it also said extortion."
2006.05-9264,1,32074,jonathan_l_marcus,,2334.762,2342.587,"Well, Congress identified it as a violent felony presumably because it believed it had... it had the criteria."
2006.05-9264,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2342.587,2350.866,"Yes, but is the criterion ""characteristically"", or is the criterion whatever minimal risk of harm there is in extortion?"
2006.05-9264,1,32074,jonathan_l_marcus,,2350.866,2357.613,"Well, that it carries the potential risk, because when any... when someone commits extortion there might be a tendency to... if there--"
2006.05-9264,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2357.613,2363.127,Is the level of potential risk the level that exists in extortion?
2006.05-9264,1,32074,jonathan_l_marcus,,2367.343,2368.375,--Yes.
2006.05-9264,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2372.436,2384.571,"--Maybe, the same point, isn't it reasonable to assume that the risk of harm in these attempt cases is characteristically going to be pretty close to zero?"
2006.05-9264,1,32074,jonathan_l_marcus,,2393.63,2394.066,"I don't agree, Your Honor."
2006.05-9264,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2396.706,2410.405,One way to do that is to say the potential risk is the potential for the risk of the harm that comes from the commission of the crime itself.
2006.05-9264,1,32074,jonathan_l_marcus,,2451.278,2459.056,"When you're assessing the risk presented by particular conduct, I think you have to take into account the intent that goes along with that conduct."
2006.05-9264,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2459.056,2460.291,"Oh, I agree with you."
2006.05-9264,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2471.332,2474.097,Don't believe it for a minute.
2006.05-9264,1,32074,jonathan_l_marcus,,2525.077,2527.576,"Well, Congress doesn't look to attempt as a lesser offense."
2006.05-9264,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2590.957,2597.282,I would suppose the unsuccessful burglar poses a greater risk of physical injury than the successful burglar.
2006.05-9264,1,32074,jonathan_l_marcus,,2597.282,2599.625,--Arguably.
2006.05-9264,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2633.829,2644.857,"--Well, what do you say about your brother's argument that the statistics show there's a 3 percent chance, I think it was a 3 percent chance of violence in the course of committing the burglary?"
2006.05-9264,1,32074,jonathan_l_marcus,,2657.133,2662.364,"But again, I think... I don't think you need to have those statistics."
2006.05-9264,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2662.364,2672.001,"No, I don't think you do either, but I mean, I think your whole argument has got to rest really on the potential for harm in the commission of the offense."
2006.05-9264,1,32074,jonathan_l_marcus,,2672.001,2682.092,"That's the very reason that attempts are prohibited, because they present the serious potential to produce the harms that the completed offense presents."
2006.05-9264,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2682.092,2694.509,"Do I correctly understand, we don't need the statistics, I guess they're not available, but in your view if we did have statistics and they showed that in 1/10 of 1 percent of the category of crimes across the nation, there was this risk, that would be enough?"
2006.05-9264,1,32074,jonathan_l_marcus,,2694.509,2697.133,For attempts?
2006.05-9264,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2697.133,2697.648,Yes.
2006.05-9264,1,32074,jonathan_l_marcus,,2712.048,2714.469,"Yes, I think Congress wanted to treat a frustrated burglar the same--"
2006.05-9264,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2714.469,2715.359,The answer is yes?
2006.05-9264,1,32074,jonathan_l_marcus,,2715.359,2716.28,--Yes.
2006.05-9264,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2721.607,2726.761,"So then it's a really easy case, because really there is some risk in every case."
2006.05-9264,1,32074,jonathan_l_marcus,,2731.165,2734.82,But that's not what we're asking the Court here.
2006.05-9264,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2745.738,2751.392,"Yes, but none of the elements of the offense satisfy the risk of physical injury in the burglary case."
2006.05-9264,1,32074,jonathan_l_marcus,,2753.078,2767.26,"--But in considering the conduct involved in the offense, the attempting to get, the attempt to enter a dwelling, enter someone's home, someone's residence, that creates a dynamic situation in which violence could occur--"
2006.05-9264,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2767.26,2767.729,Right.
2006.05-9264,1,32074,jonathan_l_marcus,,2767.947,2768.26,--That doesn't--
2006.05-9264,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2768.26,2777.194,"--If in 1/10 of 1 percent of the cases, there is in fact a physical confrontation, that's enough, which makes it a pretty easy case."
2006.05-9264,1,32074,jonathan_l_marcus,,2777.194,2779.208,--Yes.
2006.05-9264,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2802.917,2815.319,"So in other words, you're saying that in measuring the risk, you should consider not just what this particular defendant succeeded in accomplishing, but what the defendant was attempting to accomplish?"
2006.05-9264,1,32074,jonathan_l_marcus,,2815.319,2815.928,That's correct.
2006.05-9264,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2849.29,2851.039,What about attempted assault?
2006.05-9264,1,32074,jonathan_l_marcus,,2856.304,2867.269,"--Well, I think, my understanding would be that would be covered under the first subsection for the use... attempted use or threat, threatened use of force."
2006.05-9264,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2867.269,2868.534,All right.
2006.05-9264,1,32074,jonathan_l_marcus,,2889.04,2900.085,"But there in those type offenses, if you look at the elements of the offense, there's no nexus between those elements and the... a reaction that someone might have just to being prosecuted."
2006.05-9264,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2901.614,2902.239,So what's the test?
2006.05-9264,1,32074,jonathan_l_marcus,,2924.604,2933.632,"--Well, in this statute you're talking about career criminals, people who have committed a number of crimes and have recently just been convicted of being an armed felon."
2006.05-9264,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2959.871,2978.849,"Mr. Marcus, assuming we accept your view about the way the statute should be read, I take it you agree that because of the curtilage possibility under Florida law, that Florida law, that burglary in Florida is not a generic burglary?"
2006.05-9264,1,32074,jonathan_l_marcus,,2978.849,2981.925,We haven't argued that it is generic burglary.
2006.05-9264,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2982.206,2989.922,"I guess my... so that leads me to this question, because... I mean, I, my understanding is it's not a generic burglary."
2006.05-9264,1,32074,jonathan_l_marcus,,3037.825,3038.653,"I mean, no."
2006.05-9264,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3044.228,3049.444,"No, but the only thing we know under the otherwise clause, is that this was an attempt at burglary."
2006.05-9264,1,32074,jonathan_l_marcus,,3057.472,3058.347,--Yes.
2006.05-9264,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3058.347,3060.206,But this is not a generic burglary.
2006.05-9264,1,32074,jonathan_l_marcus,,3086.554,3087.054,No.
2006.05-9264,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3103.751,3110.701,"Well, could you tell us what your position is if we choose to use the noncategorical or the modified categorical approach?"
2006.05-9264,1,32074,jonathan_l_marcus,,3119.838,3120.323,--Yes.
2006.05-9264,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3127.273,3132.692,And we don't have any transcript of colloquies with the court or anything like that?
2006.05-9264,1,32074,jonathan_l_marcus,,3132.692,3133.036,No.
2006.05-9264,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3133.036,3140.001,"Well, what about... do you think the facts in the presentence report are admitted by your opponent or not?"
2006.05-9264,1,32074,jonathan_l_marcus,,3140.001,3144.532,He didn't object to the facts in the presentence report.
2006.05-9264,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3145.889,3147.968,"Therefore, can we consider them?"
2006.05-9264,1,32074,jonathan_l_marcus,,3147.968,3149.451,--Yes.
2006.05-9264,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3149.451,3155.246,"So therefore, then the question is whether throwing the hammer through the window is sufficient; is that right?"
2006.05-9264,1,32074,jonathan_l_marcus,,3155.246,3164.663,"Well, that would resolve Justice Souter's question about whether it would involve the curtilage at all, which would show that there was an attempted physical entry into the residence."
2006.05-9264,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3164.663,3171.224,Would you think that the hammer through the window is a decisive fact if we do look at the individual case?
2006.05-9264,1,32074,jonathan_l_marcus,,3171.224,3181.125,"Well, we don't... yes, certainly we think that any attempted burglary of a dwelling presents a serious potential risk categorically."
2006.05-9264,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3194.386,3199.791,"Because the hammer is thrown through the window, is that... I just want to be sure I understand your view of the importance of the hammer."
2006.05-9264,1,32074,jonathan_l_marcus,,3199.791,3202.632,Because there was an attempted physical entry into the residence.
2006.05-9264,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3206.662,3211.738,I'm still a little unclear as to how much significance we pay to that hammer.
2006.05-9264,1,32074,jonathan_l_marcus,,3211.738,3218.939,"Again, we don't think you have to attribute any particular significance to that."
2006.05-9264,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3231.215,3239.368,Even though there's some cases in this large category that clearly wouldn't involve any risk to anybody.
2006.05-9264,1,32074,jonathan_l_marcus,,3251.285,3253.002,--That's correct.
2006.05-9264,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3299.952,3305.2,"Do you agree that this presentence report cannot be consulted under the reasoning of Shepard, we need more?"
2006.05-9264,1,32074,jonathan_l_marcus,,3305.2,3314.494,"Well, under Shepard, the defendant in Shepard had objected to the use of police reports."
2006.05-9264,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3330.799,3334.703,You don't think the PSR has some kind of significance that the police report did not?
2006.05-9264,1,32074,jonathan_l_marcus,,3334.703,3338.437,"It wouldn't, no."
2006.05-9264,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3340.499,3359.523,"Is the following sort of summary fair: Because Florida is not a generic burglary State, the mere conviction of burglary would not satisfy the burglary prong in subsection 2?"
2006.05-9264,1,32074,jonathan_l_marcus,,3370.767,3372.205,Argument--
2006.05-9264,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3372.205,3373.703,Is that a fair statement of your argument?
2006.05-9264,1,32074,jonathan_l_marcus,,3373.703,3374.047,--Yes.
2006.05-9264,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3383.903,3386.714,"Thank you, Mr. Marcus."
2006.05-9264,1,32074,jonathan_l_marcus,,3386.714,3386.995,Thank you.
2006.05-9264,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3386.995,3390.667,"Mr. Crawford, you have four minutes."
2006.05-9264,2,18654,craig_l_crawford,,3390.667,3398.772,"It seems to me that Respondent's position is taking the ""otherwise"" clause to trump the entire rest of the statute."
2006.05-9264,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3435.601,3443.784,It's different when you're dealing with an escapee or someone who has visitation right and then doesn't report back and qualifies as a escaped felon from prison.
2006.05-9264,2,18654,craig_l_crawford,,3446.816,3450.86,--But there's still the same potential for violence in either one of those.
2006.05-9264,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3450.86,3451.079,No.
2006.05-9264,2,18654,craig_l_crawford,,3467.634,3471.446,For someone who's escaped.
2006.05-9264,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3537.702,3539.484,"Thank you, Mr. Crawford."
