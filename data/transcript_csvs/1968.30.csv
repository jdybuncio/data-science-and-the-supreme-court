1968.30,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,16.643,"30, James C. Kirkpatrick, Secretary of State of Missouri, et al. appellants versus Paul W. Preisler, et al."
1968.30,0,42637,thomas_j_downey,,30.804,37.42,"May it please the Court, Mr. Chief Justice."
1968.30,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,381.07,399.966,"May I ask if you -- it's your position that under no circumstances could this deviation be legal, or is it because of the reasons that are assigned for it to the manner in which it is done constitute the illegality?"
1968.30,0,42637,thomas_j_downey,,399.966,406.264,It is our contention Mr. Chief Justice that this Act is legal.
1968.30,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,424.841,431.466,Regardless of the reasons for the deviations?
1968.30,0,42637,thomas_j_downey,,431.466,433.685,"Yes, Your Honor."
1968.30,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,442.809,444.254,Where do you stop on the deviation?
1968.30,0,42637,thomas_j_downey,,444.254,449.563,And that of course is the big question.
1968.30,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,478.739,481.002,What is largest difference?
1968.30,0,42637,thomas_j_downey,,481.002,485.763,"The largest difference Your Honor is slightly more than 25,000."
1968.30,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,485.763,487.937,Out of how many people?
1968.30,0,42637,thomas_j_downey,,487.937,501.417,"Out of approximately 304 no -- 4,320,000 population in the State of Missouri."
1968.30,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,501.417,502.794,I'm not talking about the whole state.
1968.30,0,42637,thomas_j_downey,,504.311,511.865,"And the largest district is 445,000 population."
1968.30,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,511.865,516.118,"Is that the one in which there's the 25,000 difference?"
1968.30,0,42637,thomas_j_downey,,516.118,528.157,"And that is 25,000 larger than the smallest district which is 419,000 population."
1968.30,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,577.573,582.012,"Mr. Downey, I gather the larger of the two was eight is it?"
1968.30,0,42637,thomas_j_downey,,583.08,584.904,"The Eighth District, yes, Your Honor."
1968.30,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,584.904,588.896,"And the smallest is district four with 419,000 is that it?"
1968.30,0,42637,thomas_j_downey,,588.896,589.575,"Yes, Your Honor."
1968.30,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,589.575,591.71,"And they're contiguous districts, aren't they?"
1968.30,0,42637,thomas_j_downey,,591.71,594.822,They are contiguous districts.
1968.30,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,594.822,600.758,Well what explains that difference between contiguous districts?
1968.30,0,42637,thomas_j_downey,,600.758,603.74,We have several factors.
1968.30,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,614.178,616.943,"Well they're not included in the 419,000 are they?"
1968.30,0,42637,thomas_j_downey,,616.943,617.52,They are.
1968.30,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,617.52,619.424,"Or rather 445, they are?"
1968.30,0,42637,thomas_j_downey,,619.424,621.111,They are included in the 445.
1968.30,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,621.111,625.63,That is the military population plus the college population?
1968.30,0,42637,thomas_j_downey,,625.63,630.309,The military population and the college population are included in the census counts.
1968.30,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,636.056,643.323,"And if you -- and if they were to be deducted from the 445, what would the figure then be for eight?"
1968.30,0,42637,thomas_j_downey,,643.323,658.332,"If they would -- if full weight was given to the population, if they were to be deducted in their entirety there would be in excess of 50,000 population taken out of the Eighth District."
1968.30,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,658.871,663.641,"But that would be assuming that all of those people were nonresident, but not --"
1968.30,0,42637,thomas_j_downey,,663.641,669.437,"That would be assuming that all over nonresident, yes Your Honor, which of course would be an erroneous subject."
1968.30,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,669.437,674.827,"But if half -- if you took half of them, why it would cut it down by about 25,000?"
1968.30,0,42637,thomas_j_downey,,674.827,675.732,"That's right, Your Honor."
1968.30,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,675.732,678.117,But that would make it exactly equal to the other district.
1968.30,0,42637,thomas_j_downey,,678.117,680.313,That would equalize pretty well.
1968.30,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,805.343,813.468,"I don't understand Mr. Attorney General these ratio figures, the 10% and the 40 to 50%."
1968.30,0,42637,thomas_j_downey,,815.551,830.839,"The ratio, Your Honor is the ratio of the total number of votes in the county cast in a particular election as related to the 1960 census population for that county."
1968.30,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,830.839,835.079,You mean -- would you give us in illustrative figures?
1968.30,0,42637,thomas_j_downey,,835.079,840.466,"In other words, if the population of the county was a hundred thousand."
1968.30,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,840.466,841.366,Yes.
1968.30,0,42637,thomas_j_downey,,841.366,849.609,"And there were 10,000 votes cast in a particular election, then 10% of the population voted in that election --"
1968.30,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,849.609,850.946,Right.
1968.30,0,42637,thomas_j_downey,,850.946,863.598,"-- and as I say in Pulaski County where Fort Leonard Wood is located, in every election there has consistently been below 10% of the population voting."
1968.30,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,874.717,879.083,Those counties all making up one district?
1968.30,0,42637,thomas_j_downey,,879.083,879.294,"Not necessarily, Your Honor."
1968.30,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,879.294,880.332,Not necessarily?
1968.30,0,42637,thomas_j_downey,,881.021,886.278,We made this comparison simply to illustrate the fact that --
1968.30,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,886.278,889.263,That Pulaski County contain a great many transients and nonvoters.
1968.30,0,42637,thomas_j_downey,,889.263,889.822,"Yes, Your Honor."
1968.30,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,889.822,890.608,Right.
1968.30,0,42637,thomas_j_downey,,890.608,895.366,"And after all, we are talking here about voting rights."
1968.30,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,911.434,914.924,Well then may I ask you this question?
1968.30,0,42637,thomas_j_downey,,942.564,946.207,"Well, I'm saying Your Honor that you have to look at the entire picture."
1968.30,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,946.207,952.922,"Well I know but you got to take one or the other position or unless you want to take both, I don't know."
1968.30,0,42637,thomas_j_downey,,978.196,987.24,"We say first of all Your Honor, we say first of all that these are de minimis variations that they are of no consequence."
1968.30,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,987.24,987.999,Under any circumstances?
1968.30,0,42637,thomas_j_downey,,987.999,989.294,Under any circumstances.
1968.30,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,989.294,990.322,Very well.
1968.30,0,42637,thomas_j_downey,,990.322,998.401,That a ratio of 1.06 to 1 is not a significant debasement of a vote.
1968.30,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1006.282,1025.374,"Even though 25,000 people have their votes lessened, and they could've been given an equal vote by having a more contiguous district than you have yourself lined out."
1968.30,0,42637,thomas_j_downey,,1025.374,1030.194,"We contend, Your Honor that that 25,000 is de minimis."
1968.30,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1054.197,1056.661,"Well, isn't that then the ultimate question?"
1968.30,0,42637,thomas_j_downey,,1061.821,1068.562,"Well, I recognize Your Honor that you may not agree with that argument."
1968.30,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1068.562,1069.61,"Yes, alright."
1968.30,0,42637,thomas_j_downey,,1069.61,1073.924,You may come to conclusion that this is an unconstitutional debasement of a vote.
1968.30,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1073.924,1075.239,"Yes, yes."
1968.30,0,42637,thomas_j_downey,,1075.239,1084.021,"And in recognition of that, I say that this 25,000 difference is justified in the context of this particular case."
1968.30,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1084.021,1088.315,"Yes, well that's what I wanted to get clear in my mind."
1968.30,0,42637,thomas_j_downey,,1104.264,1105.992,"That is my position, Your Honor."
1968.30,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1105.992,1109.675,In what congressional district is Pulaski County?
1968.30,0,42637,thomas_j_downey,,1109.675,1114.26,"Pulaski County is in the Eighth District, Your Honor, the largest district."
1968.30,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1114.26,1120.176,"But where you have an underage don't you, not an overage?"
1968.30,0,42637,thomas_j_downey,,1120.176,1122.529,We have -- it is the largest district.
1968.30,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1146.208,1149.162,Well may I ask this?
1968.30,0,42637,thomas_j_downey,,1190.742,1192.539,The Eighth District of course --
1968.30,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1192.539,1193.894,"Yes, yes."
1968.30,0,42637,thomas_j_downey,,1193.894,1196.16,-- Your Honor.
1968.30,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1203.483,1203.806,Yes.
1968.30,0,42637,thomas_j_downey,,1203.806,1215.929,"And what would actually about 10 or 11,000 of that population being resident voting population."
1968.30,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1217.385,1230.184,"Well, why do you have to go from one border of your state way over to the middle of the state in that circuitous way in order to carve out a district?"
1968.30,0,42637,thomas_j_downey,,1230.184,1236.902,"Well my only reply to that question, Your Honor, is that this is the legislature at work."
1968.30,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1236.902,1237.03,Well --
1968.30,0,42637,thomas_j_downey,,1237.03,1248.235,Trying to agree upon districts will come within reasonable population variations and districts that will meet the requirements of the Constitution.
1968.30,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1248.235,1253.622,Now for what reason? For what reasons you say they're dealing with the legislature?
1968.30,0,42637,thomas_j_downey,,1265.801,1269.474,"Well, I think Your Honor that it is contiguous."
1968.30,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1271.268,1272.326,I beg your pardon?
1968.30,0,42637,thomas_j_downey,,1272.326,1272.925,I believe that --
1968.30,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1272.925,1275.051,"If you configure the microphone, please."
1968.30,0,42637,thomas_j_downey,,1275.051,1277.57,"Yes, Your Honor I'm sorry."
1968.30,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1293.15,1293.707,Yes.
1968.30,0,42637,thomas_j_downey,,1296.07,1306.857,"And you simply -- when you get into this business of drawing districts, you get into what has been called redistricting checkers and you --"
1968.30,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1306.857,1308.055,What is that?
1968.30,0,42637,thomas_j_downey,,1309.081,1313.903,Redistricting checkers or dominoes as it is been referred to.
1968.30,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1314.808,1316.582,Who refers to it in that sense?
1968.30,0,42637,thomas_j_downey,,1318.273,1326.365,"Yes, I believe the Judge of the Eighth Circuit who wrote the dissenting opinion referred to it in that matter."
1968.30,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1326.365,1328.768,Not in a favorable way though.
1968.30,0,42637,thomas_j_downey,,1328.768,1333.0,"Not in a favorable way, no Your Honor."
1968.30,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1343.071,1346.405,Just a question I'm trying to get at.
1968.30,0,42637,thomas_j_downey,,1360.873,1370.952,"I think the reason, Your Honor, I think the explanation is that this is the district which takes in the central part of the state."
1968.30,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1381.837,1382.616,A lot of what?
1968.30,0,42637,thomas_j_downey,,1382.616,1384.939,A trading of counties.
1968.30,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1388.233,1394.837,Well isn't that what -- isn't that what Reynolds versus Sims tried to avoid?
1968.30,0,42637,thomas_j_downey,,1407.372,1411.632,"I don't recall that factor in Reynolds, Your Honor."
1968.30,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1426.38,1437.465,Could you have maintained the integrity of counties here by a change of this district that would've brought them more into conformity with equality?
1968.30,0,42637,thomas_j_downey,,1437.465,1442.453,"I think, Your Honor, had we done so we would've made this district look worse."
1968.30,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1461.101,1468.927,"Well suppose you would take one of those two counties along the line between the fourth and the eighth, as I look back here."
1968.30,0,42637,thomas_j_downey,,1478.326,1480.051,"Saline County, Your Honor."
1968.30,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1480.051,1481.406,No in the eighth.
1968.30,0,42637,thomas_j_downey,,1481.406,1483.392,"Oh in the eighth, Howard County."
1968.30,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1483.392,1484.71,And below that is what?
1968.30,0,42637,thomas_j_downey,,1484.71,1486.035,And that's Cooper County.
1968.30,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1486.035,1489.599,And what's the population of those two joint?
1968.30,0,42637,thomas_j_downey,,1489.599,1493.212,"Howard 10,859."
1968.30,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1493.212,1493.841,Next.
1968.30,0,42637,thomas_j_downey,,1493.841,1495.376,"Cooper 15,448."
1968.30,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1495.376,1498.248,"Alright, right there that's 25,000 isn't it?"
1968.30,0,42637,thomas_j_downey,,1498.248,1498.867,"Right, yes."
1968.30,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1498.867,1501.334,Suppose you put those two counties on the fourth?
1968.30,0,42637,thomas_j_downey,,1501.334,1504.387,That you put those two counties in the Fourth District --
1968.30,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1504.387,1505.573,Would that equalize it?
1968.30,0,42637,thomas_j_downey,,1505.573,1508.974,You would have equalized the population.
1968.30,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1514.287,1520.761,"If you done that, the eighth wouldn't have looked any worse that does now."
1968.30,0,42637,thomas_j_downey,,1520.761,1522.619,"Look pretty poor, Your Honor, in my opinion."
1968.30,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1522.619,1522.916,Maybe it wouldn't --
1968.30,0,42637,thomas_j_downey,,1522.916,1524.413,A matter of fact it's pretty bad.
1968.30,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1524.413,1526.315,-- be pretty poor now.
1968.30,0,42637,thomas_j_downey,,1526.315,1528.533,"It doesn't look good, I recognize that."
1968.30,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1532.655,1535.631,But it would be equal.
1968.30,0,42637,thomas_j_downey,,1535.631,1541.227,It would've equalized pure raw census statistics figures.
1968.30,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1576.657,1584.918,Do you have any other military installations in Missouri and other parts of the state than this eighth?
1968.30,0,42637,thomas_j_downey,,1584.918,1592.178,We have some other military installations but they are not of the size and significance of Fort Leonard Wood.
1968.30,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1593.336,1604.658,"Have you taken consideration, in the consideration those installations in this reapportionment?"

1968.30,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1624.89,1653.008,"Well, Mr. Attorney General, the lower court was disturbed and I confess that I'm somewhat disturbed by the current fact that both the legislative committee and the legislature itself proceeded to draft, consider and enact a bill based upon, what shall I say, incorrect."
1968.30,0,42637,thomas_j_downey,,1712.373,1726.943,"Mr. Justice Fortas, many years ago Chief Justice Hughes in speaking before the American Bar Association made the remark that in this world of imperfections the faults of human clay are always manifested."
1968.30,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1726.943,1728.608,"No, that doesn't quite work here."
1968.30,0,42637,thomas_j_downey,,1760.778,1777.632,"Well, Your Honor the error about which we are speaking is a difference between the plan we have is a 25,000 population difference between the smallest and the largest district."
1968.30,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1784.868,1786.66,Well just take it very simply.
1968.30,0,42637,thomas_j_downey,,1792.481,1793.719,"Yes, Your Honor."
1968.30,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1793.719,1806.681,"If the -- if the -- on the basis of the correct figures, the overage there is what, 3.13% overage over the ideal."
1968.30,0,42637,thomas_j_downey,,1806.681,1807.497,"Yes, Your Honor."
1968.30,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1807.497,1813.921,"And the overage over the smallest district is in the neighborhood of 6%, is that right?"
1968.30,0,42637,thomas_j_downey,,1813.921,1816.647,Approximately 6% larger than the smallest district.
1968.30,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1816.647,1836.484,"Now if you take the figures that the legislature used, the incorrect figures that the legislature used, the percent of variation in district eight, Pulaski County etcetera, over the idea would've been only 1.85, isn't that what your --"
1968.30,0,42637,thomas_j_downey,,1836.484,1836.732,"That's right, Your Honor."
1968.30,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1836.732,1837.778,-- submission here says?
1968.30,0,42637,thomas_j_downey,,1837.778,1840.321,Just slightly less than 2%.
1968.30,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1840.321,1849.232,"And if you -- and I don't have -- now that's 1.85 over the ideal, isn't it?"
1968.30,0,42637,thomas_j_downey,,1849.232,1849.951,"Yes, Your Honor."
1968.30,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1849.951,1859.863,And the difference between the largest which is district eight and the smallest would've been what?
1968.30,0,42637,thomas_j_downey,,1859.863,1863.531,The smallest district under what the legislature thought --
1968.30,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1863.531,1867.621,What been around say 3% to 3.5%?
1968.30,0,42637,thomas_j_downey,,1867.621,1872.15,-- was the Tenth District with an under percentage of --
1968.30,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1872.15,1872.537,1.88.
1968.30,0,42637,thomas_j_downey,,1872.537,1874.242,--1.88%.
1968.30,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1874.242,1892.224,So that what you're doing is comparing a 6% in approximate which is just under 6% variation in terms of the true facts as against a somewhat around of 3 to 4% variation?
1968.30,0,42637,thomas_j_downey,,1892.224,1893.352,Just under 4%.
1968.30,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1893.352,1899.759,Just under 4% variation which is what the legislature thought it was doing.
1968.30,0,42637,thomas_j_downey,,1899.759,1900.569,"Yes, Your Honor."
1968.30,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1900.569,1932.033,"Now, taking into account the fact which I am for one accept that we should give a great deal of weight to what the legislature does, you have the curiosity here which seemed to have impressed the lower court and I must say it bothers me that the legislature proceeded on the basis of, what shall I say again using a colorless word, incorrect figures."
1968.30,0,42637,thomas_j_downey,,1938.09,1941.492,"That's right, Your Honor."
1968.30,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1979.686,1986.061,Is it a matter of calculation or don't you get from the census county by county figures?
1968.30,0,42637,thomas_j_downey,,1986.061,1987.299,"Yes, Your Honor, you do."
1968.30,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1987.606,2005.618,"So it's not a matter of having to make a recalculation in which errors of allocation or what not might occur, because they get their figures from the census county by county and then it's a matter of putting them together, is that right?"
1968.30,0,42637,thomas_j_downey,,2005.618,2012.182,"Well there's a very glaring error, Your Honor, right up here in the Sixth District which contains whole counties."
1968.30,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2051.703,2067.129,The lower court seems to have been so impressed by it and you would be really asked to do is to give the legislature the usual presumption of the correctness of its result.
1968.30,0,42637,thomas_j_downey,,2085.841,2094.844,Well I don't agree that the situation is as serious as the lower court has made it out to be.
1968.30,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2125.803,2127.677,It makes it five.
1968.30,0,42637,thomas_j_downey,,2129.713,2130.162,"Pardon me, Your Honor?"
1968.30,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2130.162,2132.278,Three and two make five.
1968.30,0,42637,thomas_j_downey,,2132.278,2133.833,"Yes, Your Honor, I realize that."
1968.30,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2133.833,2135.887,"Or it might make it one, three minus two make one."
1968.30,0,42637,thomas_j_downey,,2135.887,2138.769,And it could as well make it one.
1968.30,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2157.522,2158.772,Where was that?
1968.30,0,42637,thomas_j_downey,,2158.772,2161.302,In the State of Florida in Gong versus Kirk.
1968.30,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2161.302,2163.069,"Oh, yes."
1968.30,0,42637,thomas_j_downey,,2163.069,2169.175,And that was brought to the attention of this Court and this Court found nothing wrong with it.
1968.30,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2179.931,2210.566,"Is there any furious argument made here supported by strong areas part of those either who support or reject the reapportionment that there's really difference in order to change the results of the district of having a Republican congressman instead of a Democratic congressman, or a Democratic congressman instead of a Republican congressman?"
1968.30,0,42637,thomas_j_downey,,2210.566,2215.967,There's nothing in the record Your Honor to indicate this political factor.
1968.30,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2217.003,2219.947,Is that the argument it's made.
1968.30,0,42637,thomas_j_downey,,2221.911,2223.229,"No, Your Honor."
1968.30,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2223.229,2225.592,That argument is not presented to us?
1968.30,0,42637,thomas_j_downey,,2225.592,2227.409,That is not presented to the Court.
1968.30,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2227.409,2246.309,"So we can take the case as though there's no question raised in it which requires our attention, might involve a deliberate effort to shift parties in congressional districts."
1968.30,0,42637,thomas_j_downey,,2246.309,2248.957,"That's right, Your Honor."
1968.30,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2267.624,2269.904,You mean the said Republicans?
1968.30,0,42637,thomas_j_downey,,2269.904,2271.754,The leaders of the Republican Party that --
1968.30,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2271.754,2272.81,Who's the leader?
1968.30,0,42637,thomas_j_downey,,2272.81,2279.235,The minority leader of the House and the minority leader of the Senate.
1968.30,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2279.235,2286.19,"But you did tell us the legislature itself, it went strictly on party lines?"
1968.30,0,42637,thomas_j_downey,,2286.19,2290.497,"Yes, Your Honor."
1968.30,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2298.736,2299.423,Was what?
1968.30,0,42637,thomas_j_downey,,2299.423,2303.263,Was absolutely guaranteed to put a Republican in Congress and --
1968.30,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2303.263,2304.481,Well which one is that?
1968.30,0,42637,thomas_j_downey,,2304.481,2315.304,That was the Second District to the City of St. Louis that -- or the County of St. Louis that had been strongly Republican for years and years and years.
1968.30,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2317.542,2318.987,That didn't change?
1968.30,0,42637,thomas_j_downey,,2318.987,2324.108,But the people didn't follow the legislature in doing that.
1968.30,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2329.924,2331.381,That showed this doesn't always work.
1968.30,0,42637,thomas_j_downey,,2331.381,2332.699,It doesn't always work.
1968.30,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2356.545,2358.936,Is there record about that?
1968.30,0,42637,thomas_j_downey,,2361.313,2366.649,The census data would sustain it would be the only thing Your Honor that's --
1968.30,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2366.649,2367.498,But there was no testimony to legislate --
1968.30,0,42637,thomas_j_downey,,2367.498,2369.921,"There was no testimony on that point, no."
1968.30,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2369.921,2371.248,-- attempted to do this?
1968.30,0,42637,thomas_j_downey,,2371.248,2371.797,No.
1968.30,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2371.797,2375.34,Or there wasn't any testimony about the other matter you referred to?
1968.30,0,42637,thomas_j_downey,,2375.34,2376.846,"That's right, no Your Honor."
1968.30,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2376.846,2384.748,Is there any testimony that there was some effort in forming these districts to permit incumbents to run from their home district?
1968.30,0,42637,thomas_j_downey,,2384.748,2388.552,There's no testimony to that effect.
1968.30,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2391.582,2394.794,"The lower court thought that was a consideration, didn't it?"
1968.30,0,42637,thomas_j_downey,,2394.794,2395.95,That's right.
1968.30,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2407.861,2431.85,Well now in making the statement you made about the so-called sure Republican district and about the so-called Negro district are you representing that these are actually the facts that really did influence the legislature?
1968.30,0,42637,thomas_j_downey,,2431.85,2437.018,These were very definitely facts that influenced the legislature Your Honor.
1968.30,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2437.018,2438.952,Were there any findings to that effect?
1968.30,0,42637,thomas_j_downey,,2438.952,2439.91,There are not.
1968.30,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2446.655,2461.717,Or might it not be relevant if they deliberately made the district that it was not a convenience in order to elect white men or colored men either one might have not make a difference.
1968.30,0,42637,thomas_j_downey,,2461.717,2470.975,"It would be relevant only in so far as to population disparity of a district would be involved, Your Honor."
1968.30,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2474.557,2486.628,"Well this shape, form and size of eighth had been made for an incumbent congressman?"
1968.30,0,42637,thomas_j_downey,,2486.628,2489.782,"Well there again, there's nothing in the record in regard to that."
1968.30,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2502.578,2503.504,What county?
1968.30,0,42637,thomas_j_downey,,2503.504,2505.949,"Texas County, Your Honor."
1968.30,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2507.356,2509.575,What's the county's city?
1968.30,0,42637,thomas_j_downey,,2509.575,2516.308,Houston.
1968.30,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2542.045,2545.686,Is that the -- in that district?
1968.30,0,42637,thomas_j_downey,,2545.686,2546.243,"No, Your Honor."
1968.30,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2568.411,2569.798,Mr. Collins.
1968.30,1,20662,david_collins,,2569.798,2572.368,May it please the Court.
1968.30,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2776.911,2785.207,"But if you carry that kind of analysis to the state as a whole, nobody's been that is both diluted at all."
1968.30,1,20662,david_collins,,2785.207,2786.908,Well that would almost be correct.
1968.30,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2814.074,2830.819,Would you mind pointing out to us the reasons that you rely on in this case for the legislature in departing from equality?
1968.30,1,20662,david_collins,,2832.633,2834.012,"Alright sir, I will."
1968.30,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2846.782,2847.92,"Yes, I understand that."
1968.30,1,20662,david_collins,,2847.92,2850.993,"Right, now the reasons are these."
1968.30,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2880.931,2886.743,"And therefore, you rely on it regardless of equality?"
1968.30,1,20662,david_collins,,2886.743,2887.784,That's right Your Honor.
1968.30,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2906.871,2910.873,That's another question whether it could or not.
1968.30,1,20662,david_collins,,2924.851,2934.467,"Well, I think that's obviously true from the record, Your Honor absent compulsion from this Court or some other federal court, that's true."
1968.30,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2934.467,2946.623,You mean absent following the rules that have been laid down by this Court for reapportionment?
1968.30,1,20662,david_collins,,2946.623,2949.569,"No, I think the rules have been followed."
1968.30,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2956.891,2957.544,Yes.
1968.30,1,20662,david_collins,,2957.544,2957.664,And it --
1968.30,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2957.664,2965.556,"But it has said that it could not be unequal for certain reasons, hasn't it?"
1968.30,1,20662,david_collins,,2965.556,2973.894,That's right and there's absolutely no indication in this record that there's been any reason quite was unequal.
1968.30,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2973.894,2987.747,"But you're telling us that the reason that you can rely on that is because it's a legislative function and that's the only bill, they could pass therefore it is all right."
1968.30,1,20662,david_collins,,2987.747,3000.458,I don't think any legislature whether the map looks like this or whether it looks otherwise that you can hammer out and get the votes to pass a bill that's closer than 3% ideal.
1968.30,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3006.634,3009.786,Well if it was 6%?
1968.30,1,20662,david_collins,,3009.786,3014.335,"Well if it were 6%, in my judgment it would still be good."
1968.30,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3014.335,3015.411,12?
1968.30,1,20662,david_collins,,3015.411,3018.732,I think the cutoff point ought to be in the area of ten.
1968.30,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3099.408,3103.271,Would that be -- even then it would only be with respect to 1960.
1968.30,1,20662,david_collins,,3103.271,3104.137,That's true.
1968.30,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3104.137,3111.331,Then you have enormous changes I suppose in certain places in Missouri since 1960?
1968.30,1,20662,david_collins,,3111.331,3113.245,"That's true, that's true."
1968.30,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3113.245,3124.397,"I think Mr. Downey suggested, Mr. Collins that there are who -- wherein they vote going on population changes."
1968.30,1,20662,david_collins,,3130.897,3132.093,In the fourth that's true.
1968.30,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3136.62,3141.789,What you are suggesting was because of Kansas City in the fourth and its environs?
1968.30,1,20662,david_collins,,3141.789,3142.066,That's right.
1968.30,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3142.066,3147.416,There is a trend that's possible in any event in the way of increase there is if any in eight --
1968.30,1,20662,david_collins,,3147.416,3149.859,Oh I'm sure that's true.
1968.30,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3167.125,3169.618,"Now that is 15, 17,000 approximate --"
1968.30,1,20662,david_collins,,3169.618,3172.291,Well it was about seven -- 15 to 17 then.
1968.30,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3241.796,3250.879,"I understood they take it under consideration in the City of St. Louis, for instance, the transitory population in a great city like that."
1968.30,1,20662,david_collins,,3253.29,3256.264,There's no evidence in the record Your Honor that they did.
1968.30,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3256.264,3262.802,You don't think there is any transitory population in a great city like St. Louis?
1968.30,1,20662,david_collins,,3262.802,3267.221,"Well, talking about what I think and what's in the record are two different things."
1968.30,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3274.518,3277.31,"This taking is after the fact too, isn't it?"
1968.30,1,20662,david_collins,,3282.64,3284.285,"The testimony did, yes sir."
1968.30,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3284.285,3293.652,"Yes but in the legislature, was it argued that there was a university in the Eighth District and there was a --"
1968.30,1,20662,david_collins,,3293.652,3295.838,"Yes, sir, that was the testimony."
1968.30,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3295.838,3296.29,Well --
1968.30,1,20662,david_collins,,3296.29,3297.595,The testimony by these legislative --
1968.30,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3297.595,3299.739,-- well the testimony was that what they intended.
1968.30,1,20662,david_collins,,3304.497,3306.134,"Not other than the testimony, no sir."
1968.30,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3348.081,3357.557,Could the Census Bureau indicate why it conceded a possible error as much as 3%?
1968.30,1,20662,david_collins,,3357.557,3360.002,I don't know the answer to that Your Honor.
1968.30,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3362.297,3364.878,Was there a witness from the Census Bureau there?
1968.30,1,20662,david_collins,,3364.878,3365.148,"No, sir."
1968.30,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3365.148,3367.769,How did this get into the record?
1968.30,1,20662,david_collins,,3367.769,3375.824,Simply a statement in the Attorney General's brief that I think this is a part of the documentary part of the -- those booklets.
1968.30,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3377.818,3379.185,What is the stipulation?
1968.30,1,20662,david_collins,,3382.083,3387.364,"I don't know the page number of the appendixes, Your Honor."
1968.30,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3388.472,3392.392,"If he knows, would you get him to tell you later so you can let us know?"
1968.30,1,20662,david_collins,,3392.392,3393.638,"Yes, sir."
1968.30,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3427.769,3442.337,But did the courts agree that the difference is in the Mississippi were for the same reasons that you rely upon here?
1968.30,1,20662,david_collins,,3442.337,3445.381,"Well, there's no opinion of this Court in the Mississippi case."
1968.30,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3445.381,3449.763,"No, the courts I said."
1968.30,1,20662,david_collins,,3449.763,3450.817,I'm sorry I don't understand you.
1968.30,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3450.817,3454.088,Was there an opinion of any kind in that case?
1968.30,1,20662,david_collins,,3454.088,3454.977,In the lower court
1968.30,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3454.977,3458.189,"Yes, well I asked in whatever court it was."
1968.30,1,20662,david_collins,,3466.185,3468.121,"No, I don't assert that Your Honor."
1968.30,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3468.8,3477.308,"I thought you did, and I thought also that your colleague said that."
1968.30,1,20662,david_collins,,3477.308,3482.496,"Well, I don't say this is the only kind of a bill that you can get through the legislature."
1968.30,2,28475,irving_achtenberg,,3929.412,3932.964,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1968.30,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4020.834,4024.07,What do you say is the test?
1968.30,2,28475,irving_achtenberg,,4027.605,4028.284,We think --
1968.30,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4028.284,4028.621,The crucial?
1968.30,2,28475,irving_achtenberg,,4028.621,4035.991,-- the test in each case must be that the Court must examine the evidence before it.
1968.30,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4083.085,4087.664,What do you suggest the legislature could've done?
1968.30,2,28475,irving_achtenberg,,4089.908,4104.286,"If the Court please I will -- if Mr. Justice Black please, I will refer to the map which is simply an enlargement of the map appearing on page 15 of appellees' brief, was also before the Court."
1968.30,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4315.205,4319.526,What difference would that have made in the other districts?
1968.30,2,28475,irving_achtenberg,,4319.526,4321.474,This is true of every district.
1968.30,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4370.02,4371.956,"You mean 5,000 people?"
1968.30,2,28475,irving_achtenberg,,4371.956,4372.525,"Yes, sir."
1968.30,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4372.525,4374.878,Splitting up the counties?
1968.30,2,28475,irving_achtenberg,,4374.878,4390.259,"With -- you can take Scotland County from district nine into district six, which would bring district six up to 5,000 closer to equality."
1968.30,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4394.188,4396.404,Would that split the county?
1968.30,2,28475,irving_achtenberg,,4396.404,4396.733,"No, sir."
1968.30,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4397.232,4399.727,Keep it in the same district?
1968.30,2,28475,irving_achtenberg,,4399.727,4403.099,That would be shifting a full county from district to district.
1968.30,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4403.099,4411.521,"Do you think it's advisable if possible, to keep the identity of the county boundaries on congressional district?"
1968.30,2,28475,irving_achtenberg,,4411.521,4416.501,I think that is a consideration which this Court has accepted.
1968.30,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4435.083,4435.663,Well that's absolutely --
1968.30,2,28475,irving_achtenberg,,4435.663,4438.066,-- that we would follow their plan --
1968.30,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4438.066,4441.33,"That's absolutely necessary, I mean in the big cities."
1968.30,2,28475,irving_achtenberg,,4441.33,4442.695,"I would think so, yes sir."
1968.30,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4443.813,4446.318,"Yes, I see in some of the very large cities."
1968.30,2,28475,irving_achtenberg,,4446.318,4451.656,And we don't quarrel with the legislature's attempt to hold the county lines where they could.
1968.30,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4451.656,4457.003,Do you make any complaint about the structure of that eight?
1968.30,2,28475,irving_achtenberg,,4462.087,4462.307,"Well, I --"
1968.30,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4462.307,4465.139,With reference to the way it's built?
1968.30,2,28475,irving_achtenberg,,4465.139,4468.662,I think it is almost a two-headed gerrymander.
1968.30,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4495.663,4499.214,"Well, I guess they will always do that, won't they?"
1968.30,2,28475,irving_achtenberg,,4499.214,4503.903,"They will do it to the extent that the rulings of this Court permit, but not --"
1968.30,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4503.903,4515.149,But did I understand you to say Mr. Achtenberg that you are not defending the District Court judgment on any ground that in any event aid as a gerrymander and an infamous one?
1968.30,2,28475,irving_achtenberg,,4515.149,4518.56,"Well, we think that the whole plan is a political error."
1968.30,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4518.56,4531.264,"No, no, no but are you -- are you defending the District Court judgment on the ground that eight constitutes an impermissible political gerrymandering?"
1968.30,2,28475,irving_achtenberg,,4533.009,4536.47,Now I think you're correct sir.
1968.30,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4536.47,4551.47,"Well Mr. -- counsel I noticed that district eight is 13,542 above the normal."
1968.30,2,28475,irving_achtenberg,,4575.775,4576.082,I think the fourth --
1968.30,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4576.082,4580.054,To which would equalize the two districts?
1968.30,2,28475,irving_achtenberg,,4580.054,4593.035,"I think not to arrive from the mathematical perfection, but to get within 2,000 you could shift either Howard County with 10,859 and it abuts for --"
1968.30,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4593.035,4593.345,Yes.
1968.30,2,28475,irving_achtenberg,,4593.345,4613.689,"-- direct from district four, or you could reach almost the same result by shifting Morgan County, which again completely abuts the adjoining county with a population of 9,476 which would bring your variances in those two cases to a matter of a thousand or two, rather than the range of 26,000."
1968.30,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4613.689,4628.035,"Well are your clients concerned only of, I mean is there any practical foundation for political or something for your protest against this result?"
1968.30,2,28475,irving_achtenberg,,4638.655,4647.017,"Well, if the Court please, we're in this manner of political, we have -- one can never speak for why the individual parties are there."
1968.30,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4652.386,4659.263,"So your client's only interest in this is that it be done as the constitutional decisions require it to be, is that it?"
1968.30,2,28475,irving_achtenberg,,4659.263,4669.023,I think that statement is correct and I can certainly say that that their attorneys are only proposing -- are only appearing and we appear of course as appellees.
1968.30,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4669.023,4671.857,"Well, what narrowly you know in these cases?"
1968.30,2,28475,irving_achtenberg,,4678.969,4687.99,"To my knowledge, no sir. Again, this is my statement confirmed by Mr. Preisler who is one of the plaintiffs and is not in the record."
1968.30,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4687.99,4700.274,Well is the dispute simply over that in fact that the courts have said they must be nearly like as possible in population?
1968.30,2,28475,irving_achtenberg,,4707.563,4712.074,I would agree with Mr. Justice's statement except that not a little closer.
1968.30,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4719.016,4731.468,But there's no -- you have no argument of any kind based on the fact that somehow that voters are going to be heard of what is done?
1968.30,2,28475,irving_achtenberg,,4731.468,4736.304,Well we certainly have answers to their discussion on votings.
1968.30,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4760.674,4761.311,Why?
1968.30,2,28475,irving_achtenberg,,4761.311,4774.071,"Well, let me take them one by one with regard to the position which is not specifically articulated by the appellants."
1968.30,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4795.831,4801.868,So do you think -- do you think that's not worthy of any consideration whatever?
1968.30,2,28475,irving_achtenberg,,4801.868,4809.437,What we think that that argument sir could be used to justify any denial of equal representation.
1968.30,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4809.437,4823.168,"I mean, do you think or maybe so but do you think it has no right to have any weight at all, practical pragmatic situation of what you can do in the legislative body?"
1968.30,2,28475,irving_achtenberg,,4823.168,4827.49,Well we think it is an element of the pragmatic problem to be weighed.
1968.30,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4828.057,4832.227,You do then think it should be given some weight but you don't say how much.
1968.30,2,28475,irving_achtenberg,,4832.227,4835.498,Well I have to be specific.
1968.30,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4863.37,4868.508,"But that is a pragmatic fact of life that has to be considered, doesn't it?"
1968.30,2,28475,irving_achtenberg,,4869.185,4874.842,"I would say no sir, because this legislature met three times on this vote."
1968.30,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4890.138,4896.613,"Now if that's true, unless you can show something, it just shocks you someway."
1968.30,2,28475,irving_achtenberg,,4914.152,4914.252,"Well, I --"
1968.30,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4914.252,4919.078,How do we know how much those -- they live in that district.
1968.30,2,28475,irving_achtenberg,,4939.065,4960.601,"Well, I think that the history of reapportionment is, Mr. Justice Black well knows, shows that what happened after Colegrove versus Green was that the legislatures of the several states structured congressional districts which ranged as far as 600,000 from the -- one range to the other."
1968.30,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4960.601,4964.212,I know that very well and I said it isn't that case.
1968.30,2,28475,irving_achtenberg,,4964.212,4964.36,And after the --
1968.30,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4964.36,4967.512,That's why they said it from what the court held.
1968.30,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4982.701,4983.477,But we have --
1968.30,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4983.477,4991.73,Without regard to the fact that the trade -- they are in the legislature and they're doing the best they can to bring them out any further.
1968.30,2,28475,irving_achtenberg,,4991.73,5009.721,I would still not accept the argument made of legislative practicability because this in effect says that in a state as in Missouri where one party has the majority in both Houses it may politically structure the district so as to be favorable to that party.
1968.30,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5020.323,5028.82,Is -- calling your attention to the table on page 55 of the appellant's brief on the merits.
1968.30,2,28475,irving_achtenberg,,5060.8,5064.042,"I believe so sir, yes sir."
1968.30,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5064.042,5074.812,And that shows Missouri to be the what? The eleventh best in the country from the point of view of size of deviation?
1968.30,2,28475,irving_achtenberg,,5074.812,5078.113,"I just count it, yes sir that is correct."
1968.30,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5078.113,5081.626,And I don't know that it appears here.
1968.30,2,28475,irving_achtenberg,,5092.062,5094.897,And I believe Florida which --
1968.30,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5094.897,5098.109,Florida is about twentieth.
1968.30,2,28475,irving_achtenberg,,5098.109,5099.724,If I might address myself to that?
1968.30,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5099.724,5106.808,"And Missouri -- well I was going to ask you, do you quarrel with the accuracy of this -- the factual accuracy of this table?"
1968.30,2,28475,irving_achtenberg,,5106.808,5111.447,I don't quarrel with the percentage variations.
1968.30,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5121.214,5122.929,"Well, I agree with you on that."
1968.30,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5133.624,5137.355,"May I ask you, sorry, may I ask you this question?"
1968.30,2,28475,irving_achtenberg,,5293.681,5303.074,"Well, Mr. Justice Fortas it seems to me that the burden does not shift when we get into this matter of the weight of the evidence."
1968.30,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5324.467,5327.239,There is certainly may be a more accurate way of stating it.
1968.30,2,28475,irving_achtenberg,,5327.239,5338.875,Of showing that that they have failed in that regard and that they have failed to justify what we consider substantial variances under the peculiar situation in Missouri.
1968.30,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5338.875,5354.103,"But if you assume that they have -- the state has before its burden by showing that these figures are within tolerable range, then the only thing you've been talking about thus far is that they could've done better?"
1968.30,2,28475,irving_achtenberg,,5354.103,5355.398,No sir.
1968.30,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5358.442,5363.132,We'll recess now Mr. --
1968.30,2,28475,irving_achtenberg,,5363.132,5369.238,To continue with my answer to Mr. Justice Fortas's question.
1968.30,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5740.739,5749.414,"Mr. Achtenberg, fully understanding your position that percentage comparisons per se are not very meaningful."
1968.30,2,28475,irving_achtenberg,,5815.055,5819.556,"Well, I certainly can't speak of specific knowledge of each of those cases."
1968.30,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5828.165,5829.979,"Well it was in Florida, we agree."
1968.30,2,28475,irving_achtenberg,,5829.979,5832.684,For the Florida case yes.
1968.30,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5855.561,5861.273,"Yes, what my explicit question was when it says here that the data has been verified by court opinion."
1968.30,2,28475,irving_achtenberg,,5868.389,5869.218,"No, sir."
1968.30,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,6029.151,6041.073,"Can you, without too much trouble, indicate what were the lines of the Eighth District before this redistricting?"
1968.30,2,28475,irving_achtenberg,,6045.335,6047.349,"Frankly, I can not sir."
1968.30,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,6055.788,6063.991,"There's no map anywhere in these papers, is there that shows district lines before the redistricting?"
1968.30,2,28475,irving_achtenberg,,6063.991,6064.907,I think not.
1968.30,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6097.024,6104.996,Are there any improper counties you describe with the legislature?
1968.30,2,28475,irving_achtenberg,,6104.996,6111.716,"Well, I would certainly have to be bound by the record and by the statements of the appellants' counsel."
1968.30,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6171.673,6181.73,"What's the make up of the present congressional delegation from the State of Missouri, 10 members of the House of Representatives?"
1968.30,2,28475,irving_achtenberg,,6181.73,6184.163,Can somebody answer that?
