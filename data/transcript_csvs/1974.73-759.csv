1974.73-759,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,84.523,"We'll hear arguments next in number 73-759, Edwards against Healy and Others."
1974.73-759,0,34013,kendall_l_vick,,95.804,99.612,"Mr. Chief Justice, may I please the Court."
1974.73-759,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,288.706,291.454,"Mr. Vick, what's the status of that draft order?"
1974.73-759,0,34013,kendall_l_vick,,295.52,317.238,"I dare say, if I please the Court, is very much like a draft opinion that you would circulate to your brother and I checked with the Director of the judicial counsel and also with Justice Tate, who is the author of this order, on Friday and he said they was still being circularized to his brother."
1974.73-759,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,344.442,348.311,I don't know where can you speak the Supreme Court of Louisiana?
1974.73-759,0,34013,kendall_l_vick,,348.311,349.851,I don't presume to do so.
1974.73-759,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,349.851,352.024,"Well, I thought you said --"
1974.73-759,0,34013,kendall_l_vick,,352.024,353.427,I don't presume to do so.
1974.73-759,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,355.347,363.9,"Is that so, that one man has drafted an order, one member of the Court and it circulated period, is that the facts?"
1974.73-759,0,34013,kendall_l_vick,,363.9,365.368,That is a fact.
1974.73-759,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,365.368,367.399,Do we have anything more than that?
1974.73-759,0,34013,kendall_l_vick,,367.399,369.84,"As of Friday, I have nothing more Your Honor."
1974.73-759,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,369.84,371.94,"Well, as of today --"
1974.73-759,0,34013,kendall_l_vick,,371.94,376.561,"As of today, nothing more."
1974.73-759,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,376.975,379.836,We still have your opinion as to what's going to happen?
1974.73-759,0,34013,kendall_l_vick,,379.836,384.341,"Yes, Your Honor I do."
1974.73-759,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,399.442,402.705,What's the selection from voter's list or something?
1974.73-759,0,34013,kendall_l_vick,,402.705,403.953,"Yes, Your Honor."
1974.73-759,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,403.953,404.852,Primarily or?
1974.73-759,0,34013,kendall_l_vick,,404.852,407.894,"Yes, Your Honor."
1974.73-759,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,488.799,495.783,"Mr. Vick, what's the practical importance of question of whether or not this case is moot to the?"
1974.73-759,0,34013,kendall_l_vick,,499.531,501.74,"Well, that's --"
1974.73-759,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,501.74,509.559,And whether the same question arises and where no question of mootness could possibly exist.
1974.73-759,0,34013,kendall_l_vick,,511.652,515.831,Practical importance is to bring the Court to the Court's attention pursuant of the rules of this Court.
1974.73-759,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,515.831,516.76,Which we appreciated --
1974.73-759,0,34013,kendall_l_vick,,516.76,517.654,Any change.
1974.73-759,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,517.654,520.181,But I just wondered what --
1974.73-759,0,34013,kendall_l_vick,,520.181,525.283,"Now, our position is whatever the Court has of course is a matter for --"
1974.73-759,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,525.283,526.007,Let's say --
1974.73-759,0,34013,kendall_l_vick,,526.007,526.141,Court.
1974.73-759,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,526.141,533.374,"Let's say, we agree that this particular case was moot but the same issue exist in the next case, where there can be no question with mootness, isn't that?"
1974.73-759,0,34013,kendall_l_vick,,533.374,533.925,That's correct.
1974.73-759,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,537.672,538.867,Right.
1974.73-759,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,538.867,555.131,But don't you think that the defendant in the next case could loose that case and excluded potential women's jurors could win this case as an equal protection matter --
1974.73-759,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,555.131,556.569,"Depart from mootness, you mean?"
1974.73-759,0,34013,kendall_l_vick,,556.569,558.654,It's possible.
1974.73-759,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,560.134,563.429,"Well, I mean just legally and logically it could happen I take it?"
1974.73-759,0,34013,kendall_l_vick,,563.429,564.84,Yes.
1974.73-759,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,564.84,567.239,"So, it doesn't make some difference to whether this case is moot or not?"
1974.73-759,0,34013,kendall_l_vick,,567.239,568.091,The only problem --
1974.73-759,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,568.091,570.464,But the other case may not determine this one?
1974.73-759,0,34013,kendall_l_vick,,570.464,571.149,Indeed.
1974.73-759,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,584.667,597.971,"What ground do you think the -- in this case, didn't the Court find this settled down on the -- on potential litigants as the ones with standing?"
1974.73-759,0,34013,kendall_l_vick,,597.971,598.873,In the District Court?
1974.73-759,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,598.873,599.147,Yes.
1974.73-759,0,34013,kendall_l_vick,,599.147,600.083,"Yes, You Honor."
1974.73-759,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,600.083,609.913,"And wasn't the rationale of the Court that there was such an opportunity for bias, for biased jurors that the exclusion of women was unconstitutional?"
1974.73-759,0,34013,kendall_l_vick,,609.913,610.824,"Indeed, they did."
1974.73-759,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,610.824,612.277,Isn't that a due process matter?
1974.73-759,0,34013,kendall_l_vick,,612.277,613.454,It is indeed.
1974.73-759,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,613.454,617.798,Don't -- most due process decisions retroactive?
1974.73-759,0,34013,kendall_l_vick,,617.798,620.321,"Well, they have been from time to time."
1974.73-759,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,635.523,638.46,That could be a Sixth Amendment decision?
1974.73-759,0,34013,kendall_l_vick,,638.46,639.297,It could indeed.
1974.73-759,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,639.297,640.468,"Not a due process, isn't it?"
1974.73-759,0,34013,kendall_l_vick,,640.468,642.032,Yes sir.
1974.73-759,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,642.032,645.011,"Well, I mean it could be a Sixth Amendment through the due processes, isn't it?"
1974.73-759,0,34013,kendall_l_vick,,645.011,647.522,"Yes, You Honor."
1974.73-759,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,647.522,654.61,"Which may be different than a -- the due process decision that has been rendered by the three-judge District Court, isn't it?"
1974.73-759,0,34013,kendall_l_vick,,654.61,655.66,"Yes, Your Honor."
1974.73-759,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,655.66,663.925,"Well, there could be a question of standing in this -- in the appeal from the criminal conviction, whether or not as to whether a man has standing to raise this claim?"
1974.73-759,0,34013,kendall_l_vick,,663.925,667.746,"Well, Your Honor."
1974.73-759,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,681.847,686.763,What in Louisiana -- could the legislature give exemptions with the --
1974.73-759,0,34013,kendall_l_vick,,686.763,687.828,Not.
1974.73-759,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,687.828,690.131,With the present 11.28?
1974.73-759,0,34013,kendall_l_vick,,690.131,692.136,Not under the present Constitution.
1974.73-759,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,712.612,718.239,"That word, I mean on the language itself doesn't it preclude the legislature?"
1974.73-759,0,34013,kendall_l_vick,,718.239,719.29,Unequivocally.
1974.73-759,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,719.29,722.421,That's what I thought.
1974.73-759,0,34013,kendall_l_vick,,722.421,725.146,Thank you.
1974.73-759,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,725.146,728.713,Very well.
1974.73-759,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,734.624,738.524,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1974.73-759,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,866.422,869.686,Would that be true after January the 1st?
1974.73-759,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,869.686,870.923,There is no way unknowing that --
1974.73-759,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,870.923,877.127,"Is that volunteers only, would that continue after January 1st, until there was a Supreme Court rule?"
1974.73-759,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,877.127,886.059,Unless and until something comes from the Supreme Court or from the legislature there is nothing on which to base a change.
1974.73-759,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,896.057,901.667,What is -- what will the New Constitution say about jury service Mrs. Ginsburg?
1974.73-759,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,901.667,914.511,"It will say, “Simply,” this is practically verbatim from the text, “all citizens who have reached the age of majority are eligible for jury service.”"
1974.73-759,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,931.038,937.475,What if neither of those bodies act and you simply have the constitutional provision and nothing else?
1974.73-759,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,941.294,957.074,"Likely still to follow the statute and Louisiana Code of Criminal Procedure 402, which says that we don't put women on the list unless they register, the statute would still be enforced unless the legislature acts to ignore it."
1974.73-759,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,957.074,963.324,"Well, wouldn't it be inconsistent with the constitutional provision, it says all persons are eligible?"
1974.73-759,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,963.324,969.34,All persons are eligible for jury service or all citizens are eligible for jury service in Louisiana.
1974.73-759,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1083.825,1087.12,The class -- the class was what?
1974.73-759,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1087.545,1093.943,There are three classes in the action as instituted in a District Court.
1974.73-759,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1114.914,1122.443,"So, that he allowed the class of women litigants or potential women litigants?"
1974.73-759,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1122.443,1122.753,Yes.
1974.73-759,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1122.753,1124.748,Only potential?
1974.73-759,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1126.207,1127.159,"Oh, yes they were."
1974.73-759,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1139.315,1144.331,Civil and/or criminal litigants?
1974.73-759,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1144.331,1146.645,That presented a certain problem.
1974.73-759,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1174.496,1176.397,What is that claimed damage?
1974.73-759,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1178.272,1180.264,Two claims.
1974.73-759,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1192.374,1199.476,Why -- I thought the new theory was that there's very little difference between men and women and so why wouldn't a men jury be there --
1974.73-759,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1199.476,1201.86,"Well, I am not aware of that new theory."
1974.73-759,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1231.553,1232.661,What was the other's injury?
1974.73-759,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1236.148,1238.565,And the other is denial of due process.
1974.73-759,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1262.201,1263.623,What's the source of that?
1974.73-759,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1263.623,1264.611,Yes.
1974.73-759,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1264.611,1266.811,What is the source of that?
1974.73-759,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1266.811,1269.854,Provision of the Constitution 21.08?
1974.73-759,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1269.854,1271.599,"Well, due process, yes."
1974.73-759,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1271.599,1274.704,What decision?
1974.73-759,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1274.704,1282.401,"This Court has expressed in, for example, appeal against Southern Pacific Company 328 --"
1974.73-759,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1282.401,1284.02,It was a Federal Court case?
1974.73-759,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1284.02,1291.959,"Yes, but the proposition expressed that went beyond supervision of the Federal Judicial system."
1974.73-759,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1305.279,1311.905,"Well, what -- the state could try these civil cases without any jury at all as far as any decision this Court is concerned?"
1974.73-759,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1311.905,1346.73,"Yes the -- well, at least I should put it even if there is no Seventh Amendment right to jury trial in a state court, once the State does provide a jury trial Justice White, the State does provide a grand jury though it's not required, then its selection and procedures become subject to equal protection and due process scrutiny as does any other state action."
1974.73-759,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1475.478,1480.345,"Is Louisiana -- Louisiana is unique as I understand it from the briefs, is it not?"
1974.73-759,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1480.345,1482.486,In the registration system.
1974.73-759,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1510.173,1511.26,"For the basis of Hoyt, isn't it?"
1974.73-759,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1511.26,1514.503,"Yes, and Hoyt is precedent."
1974.73-759,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1514.503,1523.949,What's the present status Mrs. Ginsburg of the proposed equal rights amendment to the Constitution of the United States?
1974.73-759,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1523.949,1529.748,The proposed amendment has been ratified by 33 States.
1974.73-759,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1535.634,1536.246,79?
1974.73-759,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1536.246,1536.463,Yes.
1974.73-759,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1536.463,1538.122,And it requires a how many States?
1974.73-759,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1538.122,1538.725,38.
1974.73-759,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1538.725,1541.165,38 and it's been ratified by 30?
1974.73-759,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1541.165,1541.685,33.
1974.73-759,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1541.685,1542.625,33.
1974.73-759,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1542.625,1545.356,That include the two that have drawn?
1974.73-759,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1545.356,1545.796,No.
1974.73-759,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1554.778,1556.332,Two and you're including those two in the 33?
1974.73-759,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1556.332,1557.297,I know I'm not.
1974.73-759,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1559.875,1562.739,"Well, you're including those two in the 33?"
1974.73-759,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1562.739,1565.682,"I am including them, yes correct, yes."
1974.73-759,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1565.682,1569.465,"So, there are at least five to go between now and 1979?"
1974.73-759,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1569.465,1575.481,At least five and if you accept the argument that withdrawal is effective than seven.
1974.73-759,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1575.563,1579.809,How many have affirmatively rejected?

1974.73-759,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1624.751,1625.473,You think what?
1974.73-759,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1625.473,1626.806,Unrelated.

1974.73-759,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2502.081,2513.145,And in that respect -- in that respect the Hoyt can't hardly be squared can it with this three-judge court decision?
1974.73-759,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2513.145,2516.325,But Hoyt cannot be squared with these three judge court decision.

1974.73-759,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2543.103,2555.763,"And the question was -- one of the questions was, whether exclusion of women -- that there was an unfair jury not whether there are some other --"
1974.73-759,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2555.763,2563.2,"Well, there after all women are like men so they represented a cross section so it can be achieved by having men represent women."
1974.73-759,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2563.2,2574.3,"I know, but the judge -- the judgment you're defending is that excluding women means they are unfair bias juries?"

1974.73-759,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2576.494,2579.564,This point has acknowledged that this --
1974.73-759,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2579.564,2584.606,-- that juries without women on are more unfair today than they were 15 years ago?

1974.73-759,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2598.657,2606.46,"But it is a general rule I believe, I mean not only from (Inaudible) but from Williams case --"
1974.73-759,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2606.46,2608.376,But it wasn't in Hoyt?
1974.73-759,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2608.376,2631.41,"No, it certainly wasn't in Hoyt, but there been a lot of jury cases in this Court, Carter against Jury Commission, Williams against Florida, talking about the essential attributes of a jury trial and one of the critical attributes is that it would be drawn from a representative cross section of the community, something that cannot be achieved if women are absent --"
1974.73-759,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2631.41,2649.252,"Can I suggest to you that the representative cross section requirements more related to equal protection than the due process in the sense of unfairness, equal protection and the sense of protecting members of the community from exclusion from jury service?"
1974.73-759,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2649.252,2657.067,"Well, I think that it has come up in at least three context equal protection, due process, and then specifically, in the context of the Sixth Amendment."

1974.73-759,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2712.409,2714.155,And this -- I think --
1974.73-759,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2714.155,2719.527,And a jury without women on it trying a woman defendant would be unfair.
