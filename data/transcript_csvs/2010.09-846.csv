2010.09-846,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.754,"We will hear argument next in Case 09-846, United States v. Tohono O'Odham Nation."
2010.09-846,0,17293,anthony_a_yang,,8.856,11.808,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2010.09-846,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,80.535,84.987,But you recognize that sequential suits could be brought.
2010.09-846,0,17293,anthony_a_yang,,99.247,100.699,That is correct.
2010.09-846,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,112.173,124.314,"But you don't have control over how long the district court case is going to take, and there is no mechanism to stop the running of the statute of limitations."
2010.09-846,0,17293,anthony_a_yang,,124.314,130.635,"--Well, I think there is some control that you can exercise over the -- how promptly the suit proceeds."
2010.09-846,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,268.956,270.358,"Well, but that's -- you just--"
2010.09-846,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,270.358,284.234,"In the cotton cases, why isn't my reading of it quite very simple, which is Congress was concerned with ensuring that a claimant didn't get double-recovered in two different suits."
2010.09-846,0,17293,anthony_a_yang,,284.234,285.668,Well--
2010.09-846,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,285.668,295.626,"Isn't that a simple -- you know, you've got people suing in different jurisdictions over getting the same pot of money or something close to it."
2010.09-846,0,17293,anthony_a_yang,,303.213,307.516,"--Well, it wasn't the same pot of money."
2010.09-846,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,354.664,356.797,But you couldn't get both.
2010.09-846,0,17293,anthony_a_yang,,394.739,396.507,--I don't know--
2010.09-846,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,396.507,399.041,It's not here -- it's quite different.
2010.09-846,0,17293,anthony_a_yang,,415.219,417.838,--You may in certain instances.
2010.09-846,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,506.627,511.513,I -- I'm not sure I understand your answer to my question.
2010.09-846,0,17293,anthony_a_yang,,532.611,535.813,That might have been true in one direction but maybe not in the other.
2010.09-846,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,588.593,592.48,"--Well, but it's not -- it's not as broad as your test,"
2010.09-846,0,17293,anthony_a_yang,,616.54,621.111,--I -- that's -- that's true in some cases of an accounting.
2010.09-846,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,656.165,661.45,Is that -- is that to assert the basis about why an accounting should be required?
2010.09-846,0,17293,anthony_a_yang,,661.45,671.091,"--No, because back -- the counts -- these are back on pages 90 and 91a of the petition appendix."
2010.09-846,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,720.506,723.858,"Well, what is the -- maybe I don't know enough about what an accounting is."
2010.09-846,0,17293,anthony_a_yang,,733.581,734.148,The tribe--
2010.09-846,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,734.148,742.437,"And they can get -- and then it may be a basis for a further claim that, if that's all we've got, where did the rest of it go, and that might be the Court of Claims action."
2010.09-846,0,17293,anthony_a_yang,,746.473,754.245,"--It -- it should be that way if there were a narrowly tailored APA-type-like suit in district court, but that's not this."
2010.09-846,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,800.893,805.945,Is it accounting what should have been in the trust fund or what actually is?
2010.09-846,0,17293,anthony_a_yang,,815.735,816.369,"--Well, there's a difference--"
2010.09-846,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,816.369,818.521,"--does he go back and say, well, this should be there but it's not?"
2010.09-846,0,17293,anthony_a_yang,,818.521,827.008,"--The -- there is a difference between the parties, and I don't think it's been fully fleshed out here, about what an accounting is."
2010.09-846,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,841.201,841.801,Going forward.
2010.09-846,0,17293,anthony_a_yang,,841.801,853.242,"Going forward, not going back, and only with respect to moneys that were deposited or invested under a specific statutory authority that involves deposits that were made in banks."
2010.09-846,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,871.12,873.655,"Well, are you at cross-purposes on those two issues?"
2010.09-846,0,17293,anthony_a_yang,,882.927,884.593,"--No, I don't think we are at cross-purposes."
2010.09-846,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,914.297,925.27,"Do you read the claim in section 1500 the same way that it should be -- or do you think we should read it the same way in 1500 and 12(b)(6), failure--"
2010.09-846,0,17293,anthony_a_yang,,925.27,926.706,I think so.
2010.09-846,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,927.289,930.074,--Whether or not you've stated a claim upon which relief can be granted?
2010.09-846,0,17293,anthony_a_yang,,930.074,933.943,"--Right, which draws a distinction between the claim and the relief, right?"
2010.09-846,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,986.495,992.732,"But not so, not so here, because of the way Congress has set up the authority of each court."
2010.09-846,0,17293,anthony_a_yang,,998.034,998.969,(C).
2010.09-846,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,998.969,1003.271,--54(c) is the relief to which you were entitled.
2010.09-846,0,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1020.799,1023.501,"Well, yes and no."
2010.09-846,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1038.242,1043.229,But I also thought that the Court of Claims could give--
2010.09-846,0,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1043.229,1044.312,All of these claims could be brought--
2010.09-846,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1044.312,1044.962,--Could be brought--
2010.09-846,0,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1044.962,1046.098,--in the Court of Claims.
2010.09-846,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1046.098,1048.716,--They can give injunctive relief where that's necessary.
2010.09-846,0,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1048.716,1090.377,"That's correct, but if you have a claim, for instance -- taking the old money/new money framework, which we don't think is borne out by the complaints, but even if we were correct, if they were seeking so-called old money in district court -- that is, money that should have been there, but was improperly allocated and therefore didn't show up in their account -- they could also bring a claim under the Indian Tucker Act claiming that there was some breach of duty under a statute or regulation, clear and -- this is a Navajo Nation-type question -- and you could get an accounting through -- in order to determine the proper amount that should be there."
2010.09-846,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1139.089,1150.713,Is there any instance you've been able to think of where an Indian tribe could have a claim for money of some kind and some other kind of relief that they seek where they couldn't get it all in the Court of Claims?
2010.09-846,0,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1150.713,1155.783,"--A declaratory judgment, for instance."
2010.09-846,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1158.152,1158.818,Declaratory judgment.
2010.09-846,0,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1159.735,1166.406,"--Um -- well, I mean, you wouldn't be able to get injunctive relief."
2010.09-846,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1166.406,1167.591,No injunctive relief.
2010.09-846,0,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1167.591,1169.543,Not normally in the Court of Claims.
2010.09-846,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1170.36,1170.893,No matter what.
2010.09-846,0,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1181.566,1186.47,There is no question that section 1500 may put a plaintiff at a difficult choice.
2010.09-846,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1186.47,1188.203,That's a big choice.
2010.09-846,0,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1188.203,1191.624,"It's a choice that has existed since 1868, when Congress--"
2010.09-846,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1191.624,1209.501,"To test that choice -- it's pretty stark in the Casman case, where Congress said back pay is for the Claims Court, reinstatement for the district court."
2010.09-846,0,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1232.081,1233.45,--That's correct.
2010.09-846,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1277.127,1280.745,"Your basic point is this: You're just saying it's too bad, go to Congress."
2010.09-846,0,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1305.194,1306.06,"Well, let me qualify--"
2010.09-846,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1306.06,1307.229,And hardship is definite.
2010.09-846,0,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1309.079,1310.514,--The hardship may be there.
2010.09-846,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1314.483,1316.418,Why isn't it just as bad as what I just said?
2010.09-846,0,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1316.418,1326.023,"--Because you might be able to bring, for instance, an APA suit that completes before the six-year statute of limitations ends."
2010.09-846,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1339.367,1343.319,You have to extend a case that I didn't agree with when it came out.
2010.09-846,0,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1347.254,1347.804,"--No, no."
2010.09-846,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1358.495,1361.531,You could complete it to a denial of recovery?
2010.09-846,0,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1361.531,1362.816,"--Perhaps, that's right."
2010.09-846,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1365.216,1368.636,"I don't think that's any comfort to the Indian tribe, do you?"
2010.09-846,0,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1368.636,1374.171,"--Well, but that's precisely what they are seeking to do here, and we just disagree whether that relief is available in district court."
2010.09-846,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1425.556,1433.393,"It's not -- I mean, you are putting a pejorative spin on what they are doing, saying, you know, many plaintiffs like to take a chance in more than one court."
2010.09-846,0,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1445.47,1447.037,"In some cases, it's is a tough choice."
2010.09-846,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1474.387,1491.415,"So why isn't our rule simply -- what is so wrong with a rule that says if you can bring it in the Court of Claims you have to, but if there's relief that you can't secure there you can have two lawsuits?"
2010.09-846,0,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1493.533,1495.819,"--Well, that doesn't square--"
2010.09-846,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1495.819,1497.685,If there is no double recovery possible.
2010.09-846,0,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1497.685,1501.973,--But that doesn't square even with the history of what Congress is trying to target.
2010.09-846,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1512.095,1520.768,"We have already gone through that because most of those claims would have had some element of double recovery, that might have precluded a second action."
2010.09-846,0,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1529.957,1540.645,"--I don't think it squares with the text of the statute, which is broader than, doesn't provide for a claim, it doesn't provide for relief, it doesn't speak to double recovery."
2010.09-846,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1548.084,1548.918,"Thank you, Mr. Yang."
2010.09-846,1,21594,danielle_spinelli,,1556.155,1560.44,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2010.09-846,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1625.465,1649.181,"Your argument assumes that there is available in the district courts injunctive relief under the Administrative Procedure Act, and that is far from clear, even after Bowen, it's far from clear if you had any business being in the district court anyway."
2010.09-846,1,21594,danielle_spinelli,,1671.53,1679.7,"Justice Scalia, it is disputed whether or not the district court has jurisdiction to entertain the Nation's claims there."
2010.09-846,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1711.505,1717.992,The main thrust that I was raising was does this really get the Tribe into trouble?
2010.09-846,1,21594,danielle_spinelli,,1735.052,1736.471,"No, not at all, Justice Breyer."
2010.09-846,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1745.309,1747.559,But it couldn't get it in the court -- in the claims?
2010.09-846,1,21594,danielle_spinelli,,1747.559,1748.809,Correct.
2010.09-846,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1748.809,1752.361,It couldn't get that kind of relief in the Court of Claims?
2010.09-846,1,21594,danielle_spinelli,,1752.361,1753.463,Correct.
2010.09-846,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1753.463,1754.146,"Yes, it could."
2010.09-846,1,21594,danielle_spinelli,,1754.146,1755.429,"No, no, no."
2010.09-846,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1777.244,1790.552,Isn't it well established that part of the jurisdiction of the equity court when it requires an accounting is to give damages for breach of the trustee's duty?
2010.09-846,1,21594,danielle_spinelli,,1792.421,1798.325,"That may well be the case, Justice Kennedy, in common law trust suits."
2010.09-846,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1800.275,1802.277,"No, I'm talking about historically in equity."
2010.09-846,1,21594,danielle_spinelli,,1808.181,1811.732,"--You are correct that normally, that in the past--"
2010.09-846,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1811.732,1813.501,"It's not common law, it's not common law, it's equity."
2010.09-846,1,21594,danielle_spinelli,,1816.203,1816.886,--Correct.
2010.09-846,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1836.7,1838.283,Isn't that unrealistic?
2010.09-846,1,21594,danielle_spinelli,,1865.267,1867.636,"With respect, Justice Scalia, that is not the case."
2010.09-846,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1965.815,1970.517,Can you get the accounting in conjunction with the claim of damages?
2010.09-846,1,21594,danielle_spinelli,,1987.063,1992.467,--The Court of Federal Claims can order something called an accounting in aid of judgment.
2010.09-846,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2014.23,2014.746,Okay.
2010.09-846,1,21594,danielle_spinelli,,2021.902,2037.246,"It is because it requires the trustee to provide all information about the trust that might be relevant to the beneficiary, and it does so without requiring the beneficiary to prove any mismanagement."
2010.09-846,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2037.996,2042.732,Were those accountings available before the Administrative Procedure Act was passed?
2010.09-846,1,21594,danielle_spinelli,,2053.421,2059.175,"--The waiver of sovereign immunity that is being asserted in the district court is the APA, that's correct."
2010.09-846,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2059.175,2061.194,What about this--
2010.09-846,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2061.194,2064.079,So you didn't have a right to that before the APA was passed?
2010.09-846,1,21594,danielle_spinelli,,2064.079,2068.015,"In the district court, no."
2010.09-846,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2068.015,2070.383,Either in the district court nor in the Court of Claims.
2010.09-846,1,21594,danielle_spinelli,,2073.602,2074.419,It's a little bit more complicated--
2010.09-846,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2074.419,2075.887,"It was thought about for a century, anyway."
2010.09-846,1,21594,danielle_spinelli,,2075.887,2096.8,"--It's a little bit more complicated than that because prior to -- prior to the Court of Federal Claims in its current incarnation, certain claims for an accounting could have been brought before the Indian Claims Commission, but -- I mean that's going a little far afield."
2010.09-846,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2113.496,2117.548,"Well, why have -- you say Congress has specifically recognized it by statute."
2010.09-846,1,21594,danielle_spinelli,,2119.983,2140.229,"No, I'm referring to the 1994 Indian Trust Fund Management Reform Act, which specifically required the Department of the Interior to provide Tribal beneficiaries with certain statements, certain accountings regarding their--"
2010.09-846,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2140.229,2145.181,But did not provide for a lawsuit against -- against the government.
2010.09-846,1,21594,danielle_spinelli,,2145.181,2147.05,"--They did not -- they did not expressly do so, no."
2010.09-846,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2147.05,2158.441,"--When you are in the CFC, don't you get -- you aren't you asking for compensation for losses and injuries from the commingling or the misappropriation of assets?"
2010.09-846,1,21594,danielle_spinelli,,2158.441,2171.598,"No, Justice Kennedy, in the Court of Federal Claims, as a close reading of the complaint will show, the Nation is requesting four specific kinds of relief."
2010.09-846,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2207.371,2212.556,But your brief makes the -- seems to make the point that that's all just interest on capital.
2010.09-846,1,21594,danielle_spinelli,,2218.46,2220.726,"It's -- it's not just interest, you are correct."
2010.09-846,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2280.45,2285.652,My problem is that I read the CFC complaint as including both.
2010.09-846,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2289.12,2299.162,"What I'm trying to work out still in my mind, is if you say, look, Indian Tribe: You have to go to the court of claims, period."
2010.09-846,1,21594,danielle_spinelli,,2307.518,2308.084,Yes.
2010.09-846,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2308.084,2309.251,I know you think yes.
2010.09-846,1,21594,danielle_spinelli,,2313.838,2314.555,Yes.
2010.09-846,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2314.555,2315.522,--is in section 2--
2010.09-846,1,21594,danielle_spinelli,,2315.522,2316.207,I apologize.
2010.09-846,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2316.207,2335.585,"--of 1491 there is a sentence which says, about the court of claims, in any case including the 1505 Tucker Act, the court shall have the power to remand appropriate matters to any administrative or executive body or official with such direction as it is may deem proper and just."
2010.09-846,1,21594,danielle_spinelli,,2356.765,2357.534,Justice Breyer--
2010.09-846,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2357.534,2358.217,I'm just quoting.
2010.09-846,1,21594,danielle_spinelli,,2359.167,2375.162,"--Justice Breyer, you're -- you are exactly right about what 1491(a)(2) provides, but it also provides that any such relief can be ordered only as an incident of and collateral to a judgment of a claim of which the Court of Federal Claims otherwise has jurisdiction."
2010.09-846,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2375.162,2375.728,"Well, you want money; that causes the problem."
2010.09-846,1,21594,danielle_spinelli,,2377.864,2380.214,And notwithstanding this language--
2010.09-846,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2380.214,2380.899,Yes.
2010.09-846,1,21594,danielle_spinelli,,2380.899,2389.22,--the court of claims has continued to hold that it lacks jurisdiction to grant an equitable pre-liability accounting.
2010.09-846,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2403.162,2404.931,I'm not sure I understand.
2010.09-846,1,21594,danielle_spinelli,,2417.589,2420.107,"--Well, two -- two things, Justice Sotomayor."
2010.09-846,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2440.855,2453.495,"--It does, because why couldn't you simply have said, they owe us that original extra 10 bucks -- $10, and we want it?"
2010.09-846,1,21594,danielle_spinelli,,2455.214,2465.07,"--Dividing -- well, it is clear that the accounting sought in the district court couldn't have been obtained in the court of claims."
2010.09-846,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2528.495,2531.864,The government says the statute is simple.
2010.09-846,1,21594,danielle_spinelli,,2598.807,2601.509,"--With respect, Justice Ginsburg, I would disagree."
2010.09-846,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2671.169,2672.769,"Well, excuse me, it didn't make it easier."
2010.09-846,1,21594,danielle_spinelli,,2680.608,2684.493,"--No, I think after -- after the amendment--"
2010.09-846,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2684.493,2685.929,You had to go to the court of claims.
2010.09-846,1,21594,danielle_spinelli,,2685.929,2686.495,--Yes.
2010.09-846,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2689.63,2695.117,"No, but if they were just making it easier, they -- they would have said, you know, you can do either one."
2010.09-846,1,21594,danielle_spinelli,,2695.117,2699.569,"Well, I mean, clearly the easier path is to have one suit."
2010.09-846,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2816.008,2825.883,"That would be inconsistent with the definition of ""claim"" in the federal rules, I think."
2010.09-846,1,21594,danielle_spinelli,,2825.883,2830.335,"Yes, I think the definition of ""claim"" in the federal rules -- I think that's a different definition of ""claim""."
2010.09-846,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2857.235,2867.46,"If you give it that narrow meaning, however, the government says you are contradicting what was the case with regard to the cotton suits."
2010.09-846,1,21594,danielle_spinelli,,2887.438,2892.492,"I don't think that is our definition of ""claim"", but let me explain."
2010.09-846,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2922.809,2925.475,"That is different from the word ""claim""."
2010.09-846,1,21594,danielle_spinelli,,2948.654,2962.562,"--The word 1500 refers to claims over which the Court of Federal Claims has jurisdiction, just as it does in the Tucker Act."
2010.09-846,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3039.776,3054.551,"I had under the impression that sometimes they sued for some money out of a fund, which would have been partial, and other times they sued for the value of the cotton, and other times they sued for the cotton itself, which in certain circumstances could have been worth a lot more."
2010.09-846,1,21594,danielle_spinelli,,3059.605,3068.128,"I believe we do know it was always duplicative, notwithstanding the fact that the amount that one might recover might differ."
2010.09-846,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3068.128,3073.032,"Well, if the amount differs, then, why do you suppose the cotton belonged to the Indian Tribe?"
2010.09-846,1,21594,danielle_spinelli,,3082.888,3084.554,That is not--
2010.09-846,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3084.554,3087.356,--That's Justice Scalia's question.
2010.09-846,1,21594,danielle_spinelli,,3087.356,3088.975,--That is not duplicative.
2010.09-846,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3204.083,3208.385,"But in your case -- now, let's assume the government prevails."
2010.09-846,1,21594,danielle_spinelli,,3228.198,3228.814,The reason--
2010.09-846,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3228.814,3237.72,"And the statute wouldn't have run generally, because if you are seeking the injunction, it's only latches bars you, and you are not barred by latches because you couldn't have gone sooner."
2010.09-846,1,21594,danielle_spinelli,,3237.72,3240.506,"--There are a couple of reasons why that doesn't work, Justice Kennedy."
2010.09-846,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3321.605,3323.89,"--Thank you, counsel."
2010.09-846,2,17293,anthony_a_yang,,3326.926,3328.842,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2010.09-846,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3435.611,3448.186,Do you agree with your friend that there are differences between the accounting you can get in the district court and the accounting you can get in the court of federal claims as a prelude to monetary damages?
2010.09-846,2,17293,anthony_a_yang,,3448.186,3454.007,I'm not exactly sure the differences that they are pointing to.
2010.09-846,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3483.842,3487.746,They don't even know who has hunting leases and--
2010.09-846,2,17293,anthony_a_yang,,3487.746,3489.996,That's what discovery -- that's what discovery is for.
2010.09-846,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3565.477,3572.833,"But the accounting doesn't come out of the trust corpus if there is misfeasance, the trustee has to pay the damages for that?"
2010.09-846,2,17293,anthony_a_yang,,3572.833,3578.987,"I can't speak to that, Justice Kennedy, that is possible."
2010.09-846,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3584.105,3587.324,What about the Loveladies situation?
2010.09-846,2,17293,anthony_a_yang,,3587.324,3591.211,"In Loveladies, if I may answer."
2010.09-846,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3591.211,3591.895,Sure.
2010.09-846,2,17293,anthony_a_yang,,3591.895,3597.949,Loveladies involved a district court claim for a declaration that the action wasn't taken.
2010.09-846,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3610.839,3612.208,"Thank you, Mr. Yang, Ms. Spinelli."
