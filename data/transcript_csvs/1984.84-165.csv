1984.84-165,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,8.754,We will hear arguments next in Gould against Ruefenacht.
1984.84-165,0,39169,robert_c_epstein,,13.389,52.931,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, it is our contention that Mr. Ruefenacht's right to veto every major company decision is joint management of the Continental business in which he repeatedly referred to himself as a partner and the fact that this was an entirely private transaction unique between two individuals which in no sense involved a public capital market, that these collective factors require the conclusion that in substance this was the purchase of a one-half interest in a business, and that the transfer of stock was merely incidental to the transaction."
1984.84-165,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,203.395,212.235,"Well, this argument would lead to just saying that there isn't any private sale of stock that was reached by the securities law."
1984.84-165,0,39169,robert_c_epstein,,212.235,213.77,"No, Your Honor, that is not our position."
1984.84-165,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,213.77,215.472,"Well, it sounds like it so far."
1984.84-165,0,39169,robert_c_epstein,,215.472,217.205,"Well, it is not our position--"
1984.84-165,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,217.205,219.024,A purely private transaction?
1984.84-165,0,39169,robert_c_epstein,,219.024,220.641,--We are a purely private transaction.
1984.84-165,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,220.641,223.209,"Well, so are thousands of others that are covered, I suppose."
1984.84-165,0,39169,robert_c_epstein,,223.209,225.125,"Well, that may be so, Your Honor."
1984.84-165,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,264.666,280.193,"Well, if I just buy some shares of General Motors from some other person and he misrepresents, is that exempt from the securities laws?"
1984.84-165,0,39169,robert_c_epstein,,280.193,282.462,"--I don't believe so, Your Honor, because--"
1984.84-165,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,282.462,284.914,I can't imagine anything more private.
1984.84-165,0,39169,robert_c_epstein,,284.914,291.233,"--Well, except for the fact, Your Honor, that there is an important public element there, and that public element is--"
1984.84-165,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,291.233,292.917,"Well, what if the stock isn't registered?"
1984.84-165,0,39169,robert_c_epstein,,305.827,307.043,"--No, Your Honor."
1984.84-165,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,312.081,315.433,Would that be covered by the securities laws under your view?
1984.84-165,0,39169,robert_c_epstein,,315.433,322.872,"Under my view, Your Honor, an entirely private transaction like the one you just... I would have to ask Your Honor some more questions about the facts."
1984.84-165,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,322.872,323.472,You may.
1984.84-165,0,39169,robert_c_epstein,,326.24,334.596,The first question I would ask would be whether Your Honor as the purchaser of that stock in a privately held corporation--
1984.84-165,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,334.596,336.546,I would have to report it at a certain way.
1984.84-165,0,39169,robert_c_epstein,,336.546,337.631,"--I understand that, Justice."
1984.84-165,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,344.968,350.872,"I just bought the stock for investment, and that is all I wanted to do."
1984.84-165,0,39169,robert_c_epstein,,350.872,363.08,"Assuming that to be true, Your Honor, I would also ask whether this stock that Your Honor bought was a smaller unit of a larger offering or whether it was--"
1984.84-165,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,363.08,367.234,"No, it was just... the stock has been in these same hands for a long time."
1984.84-165,0,39169,robert_c_epstein,,371.519,372.519,"--Not covered, Your Honor."
1984.84-165,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,372.519,373.554,Not covered.
1984.84-165,0,39169,robert_c_epstein,,373.554,374.121,Not covered.
1984.84-165,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,374.121,376.339,Is that the established rule or--
1984.84-165,0,39169,robert_c_epstein,,376.339,379.875,"Well, Your Honor, there is no established rule."
1984.84-165,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,728.702,735.105,--What is your... I know you say we ought to look at the economic realities and all that.
1984.84-165,0,39169,robert_c_epstein,,745.496,750.032,"--The objective of the transaction, Your Honor, is one of the economic realities."
1984.84-165,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,752.55,753.584,"Well, which is it?"
1984.84-165,0,39169,robert_c_epstein,,757.054,764.808,"--There are gradations of cases, Your Honor, and it is difficult for me to answer that entirely in the abstract."
1984.84-165,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,765.91,769.362,"Well, if you can't, I don't know what kind of a bright line you are drawing."
1984.84-165,0,39169,robert_c_epstein,,769.362,777.551,"--Your Honor, the line we are drawing is between the kinds of transactions Congress intended to cover and did not intend to cover."
1984.84-165,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,778.717,779.483,That is fine.
1984.84-165,0,39169,robert_c_epstein,,781.05,781.383,--Okay.
1984.84-165,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,818.573,825.829,In general you are talking about whether he is making an investment or whether he is buying it to make money by himself.
1984.84-165,0,39169,robert_c_epstein,,825.829,827.279,"That is exactly correct, Your Honor."
1984.84-165,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,828.445,832.231,"Well, refine it if that is too general."
1984.84-165,0,39169,robert_c_epstein,,832.231,834.283,"Well, there are two components to that inquiry."
1984.84-165,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,861.6,863.968,"He didn't have an affirmative control, did he?"
1984.84-165,0,39169,robert_c_epstein,,863.968,870.356,"He could not impose his will on the corporation, Mr. Chief Justice, that is correct, but what he could do--"
1984.84-165,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,870.356,871.206,He could veto.
1984.84-165,0,39169,robert_c_epstein,,871.206,887.568,"--That is exactly right, Your Honor, and not only that, through his joint management of the company as a result of his efforts in obtaining sales and operations and so on and so forth, he had, as the magistrate found, a fundamental influence over whether this corporation did well or did not do well."
1984.84-165,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,891.435,892.804,You speak to the veto power.
1984.84-165,0,39169,robert_c_epstein,,895.021,900.475,"Yes, Your Honor, in the sense that Mr. Ruefenacht could not do anything without his partner going along."
1984.84-165,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,900.475,900.891,Exactly.
1984.84-165,0,39169,robert_c_epstein,,900.891,902.51,"That is exactly right, Your Honor."
1984.84-165,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,912.016,914.551,"But it is also a good way to protect his investment, isn't it?"
1984.84-165,0,39169,robert_c_epstein,,914.551,919.039,"--In a generic sense of the term ""investment"", Your Honor, that is true."
1984.84-165,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,929.828,936.131,"Yes, but a veto power doesn't always have the characteristics of control."
1984.84-165,0,39169,robert_c_epstein,,942.82,943.854,--That is true.
1984.84-165,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,963.568,964.401,May I ask a question?
1984.84-165,0,39169,robert_c_epstein,,964.401,965.401,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1984.84-165,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,965.401,968.436,We are all trying to grasp exactly where the dividing line is.
1984.84-165,0,39169,robert_c_epstein,,974.59,975.09,No.
1984.84-165,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,975.09,982.113,It is only if there is a sale of control and the purchaser thereafter relies on the management efforts of other to produce--
1984.84-165,0,39169,robert_c_epstein,,982.113,984.646,"Yes, Your Honor, and in a private setting that would be especially true."
1984.84-165,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,984.646,998.205,"--So every sale of a business to, say, a bank or a trustee which would then be... you would have to get some outsider to manage for them, those would all be covered, 12 percent sale of the business in the other case or your business here."
1984.84-165,0,39169,robert_c_epstein,,998.205,999.907,"Again, if we are talking--"
1984.84-165,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,999.907,1004.192,To a bank or a university who is going to hire some management expert to run the business for them.
1984.84-165,0,39169,robert_c_epstein,,1004.842,1009.013,"--If we are dealing in a totally private setting, not a publicly traded security in any sense--"
1984.84-165,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1009.013,1010.313,Not a publicly traded security.
1984.84-165,0,39169,robert_c_epstein,,1010.313,1015.75,"--Then it would not be covered, and the fact that management was delegated to somebody else makes no difference."
1984.84-165,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1015.75,1024.106,So is every sale of control of an unlisted security exempt under your view?
1984.84-165,0,39169,robert_c_epstein,,1024.106,1025.206,"No, Your Honor."
1984.84-165,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1063.898,1065.6,"Well, let me go back."
1984.84-165,0,39169,robert_c_epstein,,1074.788,1076.824,"Yes, Your Honor, I believe so."
1984.84-165,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1080.359,1094.084,"All right, then the next question is, all sales of control of an unlisted security by control block, 52 percent 30, or whatever it takes to constitute realistic control of an unlisted security, always exempt?"
1984.84-165,0,39169,robert_c_epstein,,1094.084,1103.642,"Yes, if... yes, if that security was not of a nature which could be publicly marketable."
1984.84-165,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1104.475,1107.094,"Well, I mean, if it is a big company, you are always going to be publicly marketed."
1984.84-165,0,39169,robert_c_epstein,,1107.094,1125.305,"--Well, if we are talking about a security, Your Honor, which has roughly equivalent value to most people, and I take that language from the Weaver case, if we are dealing in that kind of security, in my view, you start to implicate the kinds of Congressional concerns that I have been trying to address."
1984.84-165,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1152.206,1156.425,"I am assuming, you know, ordinary common stock, you know."
1984.84-165,0,39169,robert_c_epstein,,1166.132,1183.677,"--Your Honor, when I talk about idiosyncratic instruments, I am talking about the kind of stock that was involved in this case, which had value only as between Mr. Ruefenacht and Mr. Burkle, and had no widespread value to anyone else, had no equivalent value, as I said before, to other people."
1984.84-165,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1183.677,1186.177,Why didn't it have value to somebody else?
1984.84-165,0,39169,robert_c_epstein,,1190.614,1196.166,"It would have value in that sense, but it did not have the kind of value that existed between these two people."
1984.84-165,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1217.181,1222.483,But you would come out differently if it were a publicly traded security?
1984.84-165,0,39169,robert_c_epstein,,1222.483,1223.418,"Yes, Your Honor--"
1984.84-165,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1223.418,1229.839,"You would agree, sale of control of a publicly traded security with management prerogatives and all this is covered by the Act?"
1984.84-165,0,39169,robert_c_epstein,,1229.839,1230.405,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1984.84-165,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1428.998,1435.754,But I suppose you must hope that we decide the immediate preceding case in a particular way.
1984.84-165,0,39169,robert_c_epstein,,1435.754,1436.754,"That's right, Your Honor."
1984.84-165,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1443.825,1445.542,Either way.
1984.84-165,0,39169,robert_c_epstein,,1451.296,1459.934,"Your Honor leads me to an interesting point, and that is the point of common venture which was raised earlier in the colloquy, and I would like to tackle that one head-on."
1984.84-165,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1540.686,1541.836,Very well.
1984.84-165,1,38242,peter_steven_pearlman,,1549.409,1594.788,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, on behalf of Max Ruefenacht, the purchaser of one-half of the shares of traditional common stock of Continental Import and Export, Inc., I submit that to accept the sale of business doctrine will require this Court to disregard accepted principles of statutory construction by ignoring the specific and unambiguous language of the securities statutes, abandon its own prior precedent and policy, and to adopt a policy which is ambiguous, unworkable, not readily definable, and which creates results which are arbitrary and unfair in the extreme."
1984.84-165,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1907.692,1910.127,What did we use in the notes case?
1984.84-165,1,38242,peter_steven_pearlman,,1910.127,1916.631,I don't believe that this Court has made a determination on--
1984.84-165,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1916.631,1917.65,On notes?
1984.84-165,1,38242,peter_steven_pearlman,,1917.65,1919.65,--a specific notes case.
1984.84-165,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1927.006,1927.472,On that?
1984.84-165,1,38242,peter_steven_pearlman,,1927.472,1928.906,--on that issue as well.
1984.84-165,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1935.612,1936.962,Maybe you will be here on that.
1984.84-165,1,38242,peter_steven_pearlman,,1936.962,1939.98,"It would be my great pleasure, Justice White."
1984.84-165,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1942.016,1945.218,"Well, that really is the most difficult part of your argument, isn't it?"
1984.84-165,1,38242,peter_steven_pearlman,,1954.739,1961.227,"Justice Rehnquist, I don't believe that it is necessary to make these differentiations with respect to notes."
1984.84-165,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2225.882,2235.671,"Well, you say that any sale of any kind of stock that any fool would recognize as stock is reached by the securities laws?"
1984.84-165,1,38242,peter_steven_pearlman,,2235.671,2240.908,I don't know if any stock that any fool would recognize as stock is reached by the securities laws.
1984.84-165,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2246.628,2250.663,"Well, a fortiori if a fool would even recognize it."
1984.84-165,1,38242,peter_steven_pearlman,,2252.532,2255.65,--I am sure that was intended to reflect the recognition.
1984.84-165,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2255.65,2260.702,"Anyway, you think that stock is stock, any sales stock is covered."
1984.84-165,1,38242,peter_steven_pearlman,,2260.702,2262.804,Any sale of what is really stock is covered.
1984.84-165,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2450.025,2452.727,"None, apparently."
1984.84-165,1,38242,peter_steven_pearlman,,2452.727,2453.21,Thank you.
1984.84-165,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2453.21,2460.916,Mr. Goelzer.
1984.84-165,2,20931,daniel_l_goelzer,,2460.916,2462.285,Thank you.
1984.84-165,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2657.445,2667.235,"Mr. Goelzer, if your view is adopted by this Court, what is it likely to do to the numbers of cases dealt with by the Commission?"
1984.84-165,2,20931,daniel_l_goelzer,,2670.837,2689.916,"If my view is adopted, I think it won't have any effect on the number of cases that the Commission deals with, since it has always been the Commission's assumption since 1933 and 1934 that any transaction in ordinary stock is within the scope of the securities laws."
1984.84-165,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2700.956,2708.562,"Is it likely to increase the numbers of cases filed in federal courts, do you think, to any significant degree?"
1984.84-165,2,20931,daniel_l_goelzer,,2708.562,2710.247,"--I think not, Your Honor."
1984.84-165,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2737.997,2749.455,"What is the Commission's position concerning notes, and what type of meaning should be adopted for that word in the statute?"
1984.84-165,2,20931,daniel_l_goelzer,,2749.455,2754.526,"Well, as was pointed out earlier, this Court, of course, has not considered the meaning of the term ""note"" in the--"
1984.84-165,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2754.526,2756.509,"No, I asked what the Commission's position is."
1984.84-165,2,20931,daniel_l_goelzer,,2756.509,2766.501,"--Well, as I would with stock, I would begin with the literal term of the statute, and start with a presumption that any note is included within the scope of the Act."
1984.84-165,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3051.384,3054.319,"Do you have anything further, Mr. Epstein?"
1984.84-165,3,39169,robert_c_epstein,,3054.319,3055.038,"Yes, briefly, Your Honor."
1984.84-165,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3056.004,3057.654,You have four minutes remaining.
1984.84-165,3,39169,robert_c_epstein,,3057.654,3059.056,"--Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1984.84-165,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3203.7,3205.116,"Thank you, gentlemen."
