1989.88-1213,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.357,"We'll hear argument next in Number 88-1213, Employment Division of Oregon v. Alfred Smith."
1989.88-1213,0,20843,david_b_frohnmayer,,64.944,68.335,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.88-1213,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,127.634,138.213,"General Frohnmayer, the Oregon Supreme Court really didn't tell us whether the Oregon constitution would have been violated by this statute, did it?"
1989.88-1213,0,20843,david_b_frohnmayer,,144.764,158.455,"In footnote 3 of the Oregon Supreme Court's decision on remand, Justice O'Connor, the court reserved the question of what would happen in a fact-specific criminal prosecution related to the conduct of a specific person arrested and prosecuted."
1989.88-1213,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,158.455,171.903,Has... does... do we know whether there have ever been any criminal prosecutions in Oregon under the statute of members of the Native American Church for peyote use?
1989.88-1213,0,20843,david_b_frohnmayer,,171.903,172.594,"Yes, we do."
1989.88-1213,1,18806,craig_j_dorsay,,1752.177,1756.431,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.88-1213,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1813.409,1833.361,"Well, it could... couldn't it be that the exception that the Oregon court was referring to might have been an exception for the use of peyote in insignificant quantities that could... could not produce any hallucinogenic or other adverse physical effect?"
1989.88-1213,1,18806,craig_j_dorsay,,1856.962,1857.751,"Well, that is correct."
1989.88-1213,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1873.371,1877.094,"--Yeah, but, you see, I don't see a correlation between the wine and the peyote."
1989.88-1213,1,18806,craig_j_dorsay,,1887.012,1888.451,"No, I do not disagree with that."
1989.88-1213,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1910.205,1913.298,How did it get to be a Schedule I controlled substance?
1989.88-1213,1,18806,craig_j_dorsay,,1913.298,1914.53,"Well, I think it has--"
1989.88-1213,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1914.53,1915.228,"I mean, somebody thinks it is harmful."
1989.88-1213,1,18806,craig_j_dorsay,,1915.228,1915.629,--Yes.
1989.88-1213,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1943.862,1946.372,How would such evidence be acquired?
1989.88-1213,1,18806,craig_j_dorsay,,1952.349,1957.342,"Well, we have a long history with this church of hundreds of years, and there has been no documented evidence."
1989.88-1213,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2085.927,2092.062,"--It gives the appearance of being [inaudible] script in a way, when it says, when it is describing its previous opinion."
1989.88-1213,1,18806,craig_j_dorsay,,2094.123,2094.603,That is correct.
1989.88-1213,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2094.603,2097.265,--as it if was just repeating what it said in its earlier opinion.
1989.88-1213,1,18806,craig_j_dorsay,,2097.265,2105.171,"Well, I believe what they did is they responded to the dissent's invitation to say this is what we said the first time."
1989.88-1213,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2142.097,2145.99,"Mr. Dorsay, I... whether it is irrelevant is a matter of state law."
1989.88-1213,1,18806,craig_j_dorsay,,2152.452,2152.943,Yes.
1989.88-1213,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2152.943,2156.526,"--for violation of your state rules, as an original matter."
1989.88-1213,1,18806,craig_j_dorsay,,2174.659,2183.176,"That is correct, unless it is job related or is involved in the actual firing of the person."
1989.88-1213,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2227.165,2234.759,Why do you... why do you say that the... these people are entitled to workmen's compensation?
1989.88-1213,1,18806,craig_j_dorsay,,2234.759,2241.494,Because they had a right to practice their religion under the First Amendment to the Constitution.
1989.88-1213,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2241.494,2244.036,"So, so the First Amendment issue is here, I take it?"
1989.88-1213,1,18806,craig_j_dorsay,,2244.036,2247.278,"It is, yes, in either form."
1989.88-1213,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2259.887,2268.541,But it says that the... your court says they are entitled to compensation because the First Amendment requires it.
1989.88-1213,1,18806,craig_j_dorsay,,2268.541,2269.032,That is correct.
1989.88-1213,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2269.032,2278.408,Even though the... even though the employee breached the rules of the employer.
1989.88-1213,1,18806,craig_j_dorsay,,2278.408,2280.441,"Well, we have a dispute about that."
1989.88-1213,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2283.194,2285.725,"Well, suppose it is that there was a rule like that."
1989.88-1213,1,18806,craig_j_dorsay,,2285.725,2297.733,"--If that was the rule, and if the employee knew of that rule when they were hired, then the state could validly deny unemployment benefits."
1989.88-1213,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2298.434,2299.315,Despite the First Amendment.
1989.88-1213,1,18806,craig_j_dorsay,,2299.315,2305.199,"--No, not... only if the interest was criminalized."
1989.88-1213,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2366.741,2380.742,"Well, suppose that... suppose someone who wasn't claiming a religious privilege to use peyote was a drug counselor, and he used peyote."
1989.88-1213,1,18806,craig_j_dorsay,,2380.742,2381.193,That's right.
1989.88-1213,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2383.546,2384.175,Why?
1989.88-1213,1,18806,craig_j_dorsay,,2384.175,2384.455,It is--
1989.88-1213,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2384.455,2385.296,"Why, why?"
1989.88-1213,1,18806,craig_j_dorsay,,2385.296,2387.238,--It is the religious belief that changes the issue.
1989.88-1213,2,20843,david_b_frohnmayer,,3601.896,3605.137,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.88-1213,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3656.81,3665.716,"The reason the benefits are required in this case, according to the court below, is that it... the First Amendment requires it."
1989.88-1213,2,20843,david_b_frohnmayer,,3665.716,3666.236,That is correct.
1989.88-1213,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3669.219,3675.693,"And it may, it may have said that, whether it is criminal under Oregon law is irrelevant--"
1989.88-1213,2,20843,david_b_frohnmayer,,3675.693,3675.743,--That is correct.
1989.88-1213,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3675.743,3681.798,"--but, but we don't need to think that it is irrelevant to the First Amendment issue."
1989.88-1213,2,20843,david_b_frohnmayer,,3681.798,3683.059,And we hope that you do not.
1989.88-1213,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3684.381,3686.762,That is why we... I suppose that is why we remanded.
1989.88-1213,2,20843,david_b_frohnmayer,,3686.762,3693.578,"--That's... and we believe that a different answer would have been forthcoming on remand, because we believe that it is relevant and it is a distinguishing factor."
1989.88-1213,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3719.534,3732.092,"General, suppose you just frankly said, or just from experience you would conclude that the state's criminal law, even if they could apply it, is just never applied to these ceremonies."
1989.88-1213,2,20843,david_b_frohnmayer,,3740.877,3753.544,"At the very least it is alive because of that, and also because there is on the books a very adverse precedent decided by the Oregon Supreme Court purporting to construe federal law in a way which we believe is not consistent with the teachings of this Court."
1989.88-1213,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3756.256,3757.548,"Thank you, General Frohnmayer."
