1966.27,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,7.926,"James B. Giles et. al, petitioner versus Maryland."
1966.27,0,30227,joseph_forer,,9.205,13.447,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1966.27,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,103.998,105.605,What time of the night was it?
1966.27,0,30227,joseph_forer,,105.605,111.302,This was late at night close to midnight.
1966.27,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,407.594,408.608,What was that last you said?
1966.27,0,30227,joseph_forer,,408.608,413.211,I said it's an open secret that his faith abides the result in this case.
1966.27,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,413.211,414.79,Has he been tried?
1966.27,0,30227,joseph_forer,,414.79,418.616,"He has been tried, convicted, sentenced to death commuted."
1966.27,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,426.529,427.597,Why was that trial a different kind?
1966.27,0,30227,joseph_forer,,429.587,431.458,He got a severance and a change of venue.
1966.27,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,431.458,431.924,Change of venue.
1966.27,0,30227,joseph_forer,,431.924,432.211,Yes.
1966.27,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,432.211,436.236,There's no question about the venue where this alleged crime --
1966.27,0,30227,joseph_forer,,436.236,437.785,"Oh no, this happened in Montgomery County."
1966.27,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,437.785,439.061,"Yeah, yeah."
1966.27,0,30227,joseph_forer,,439.061,445.547,The Patuxent River is the border line between Montgomery and Howard and they were on the Montgomery County side.
1966.27,1,21311,donald_needle,,3779.075,3784.302,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1966.27,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4022.808,4025.69,Can you tell us what you mean by the prosecutor?
1966.27,1,21311,donald_needle,,4025.69,4035.863,"By the prosecutor sir I mean in this instance, the prosecutor of Montgomery County, the jurisdiction of the case."
1966.27,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4035.863,4036.721,You mean --
1966.27,1,21311,donald_needle,,4036.721,4042.113,He and his agents or assistants plus Montgomery County police report.
1966.27,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4042.113,4062.591,"Well, let's suppose that the top state's attorney to tell whatever it is and Montgomery County -- suppose the state's attorney for Montgomery County I don't know what it's called, will include him and then would you include the file staff all of the lawyers on the file staff along with the lawyers who investigate it."
1966.27,1,21311,donald_needle,,4062.591,4063.384,Yes sir.
1966.27,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4063.384,4073.405,But you would include the head of the -- would you include the head of the office whether or not he was engaged on the particular case that's when I'm really asking (Voice Overlap).
1966.27,1,21311,donald_needle,,4073.405,4074.433,"Well, yes sir."
1966.27,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4090.285,4093.746,Whether or not the state's attorney was actually engaged to --
1966.27,1,21311,donald_needle,,4093.746,4095.32,Yes sir I would say too.
1966.27,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4095.32,4101.218,"But so, you had made a distinction between that and the police."
1966.27,1,21311,donald_needle,,4101.218,4101.466,Well --
1966.27,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4101.466,4106.223,"In other words, so far as the police I'm really just trying --"
1966.27,1,21311,donald_needle,,4106.223,4106.585,I think --
1966.27,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4106.585,4123.836,"I'm trying to get exact what you are pointing and I assume we're going to talk about -- I understand what you said, you would place, you would impute our views as a practical knowledge of dispute."
1966.27,1,21311,donald_needle,,4128.524,4129.663,Yes sir.
1966.27,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4129.663,4134.548,"And the trial staff of the lawyers and the investigating staff, isn't that right?"
1966.27,1,21311,donald_needle,,4134.548,4135.477,Correct.
1966.27,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4135.477,4147.805,"But, if I correctly understood you so far as the police are concerned, we would include only the police who were actively engaged in that particular investigation."
1966.27,1,21311,donald_needle,,4147.805,4149.493,No sir.
1966.27,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4152.261,4155.75,Or maybe I adhere to you but -- (Voice Overlap).
1966.27,1,21311,donald_needle,,4155.75,4166.572,"If the state's attorney has not in fact prosecuted the case at trial, then he of course would never be charged with suppressing evidence."
1966.27,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4170.939,4175.555,"Now, I want to know whose knowledge we're talking about not who has charged the suppression."
1966.27,1,21311,donald_needle,,4201.672,4213.875,"I would say no sir, would that interest in the case is of the prosecutor and any information that his subagents might have given him and would have aide him in the prosecution."
1966.27,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4213.875,4217.062,Well I think now I'm getting to understand you.
1966.27,1,21311,donald_needle,,4241.744,4242.407,Yes sir.
1966.27,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4242.407,4243.483,Have I got your position (Voice Overlap)?
1966.27,1,21311,donald_needle,,4243.483,4244.636,Yes sir.
1966.27,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4244.636,4252.127,That's a narrower view than that laid down by the majority in your Court of Appeals.
1966.27,1,21311,donald_needle,,4252.127,4252.631,Yes it is.
1966.27,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4252.631,4254.951,So why do you have to ask us to narrow the --
1966.27,1,21311,donald_needle,,4254.951,4255.457,No --
1966.27,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4255.457,4262.019,"-- Maryland Court of Appeals view accepting that view, the breadth of that view, they're still decided in your favor, didn't they?"
1966.27,1,21311,donald_needle,,4264.107,4271.969,We don't ask you to narrow it sir but we point out in our position to the defense claim that our Court of Appeals was in error.
1966.27,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4273.473,4276.282,It was decided in your favor but why do you have to argue with an error?
1966.27,1,21311,donald_needle,,4276.282,4278.426,"Well, we're not saying it was."
1966.27,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4295.366,4306.665,"Well the only respect in which Court of Appeals is broader in the view that you think is correct is to include all of the police in Montgomery County, is that right?"
1966.27,1,21311,donald_needle,,4306.665,4311.562,I think that implication can be read into the language of the Court of Appeals.
1966.27,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4311.846,4338.888,"It is very important for us to know just what the Court of Appeals decided and as I understood your prior statement, the Court of Appeals said that the prosecution is chargeable with the knowledge that Mr. Kardy and his assistant and with the knowledge of all of the police in Montgomery County, is that correct?"
1966.27,1,21311,donald_needle,,4338.888,4361.335,The course came out with an odd statement that the prosecution should be charged with knowledge of the state's attorney and his assistants and of the police department of that jurisdiction which has the control or the jurisdiction to hear the case.
1966.27,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4530.232,4532.097,You find what lying on the ground?
1966.27,1,21311,donald_needle,,4532.097,4535.523,"Joyce Roberts sir, the prosecuting witness."
1966.27,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4714.087,4716.316,The defense counsel was an assigned counsel?
1966.27,1,21311,donald_needle,,4716.316,4717.035,Yes sir.
1966.27,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4717.035,4720.297,Did that include assignment as an investigator to help her?
1966.27,1,21311,donald_needle,,4720.297,4722.344,There was no request for investigators.
1966.27,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4722.344,4728.974,Would there have been assigned if he did the test under Maryland?
1966.27,1,21311,donald_needle,,4728.974,4730.934,I don't know Your Honor of any --
1966.27,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4730.934,4733.57,He was assigned (Voice Overlap).
1966.27,1,21311,donald_needle,,4733.57,4733.917,Yes sir.
1966.27,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4794.816,4797.648,But was there any record in Montgomery County?
1966.27,1,21311,donald_needle,,4802.676,4805.422,If you will look at --
1966.27,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4805.422,4807.745,Was there at that time new?
1966.27,1,21311,donald_needle,,4811.492,4812.176,No sir.
1966.27,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4822.795,4823.806,In Montgomery County.
1966.27,1,21311,donald_needle,,4823.806,4825.045,Yes sir.
1966.27,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4832.355,4836.129,They're claiming that there was such a case.
1966.27,1,21311,donald_needle,,4836.129,4840.256,"There is no direct testimony in the record sir, one way or the other."
1966.27,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,4840.256,4845.734,"Well, you based this on the fact that his client have told him that she have said she was on probation."
1966.27,1,21311,donald_needle,,4845.734,4847.037,Yes sir.
1966.27,2,39989,robert_c_murphy,,7956.511,7958.801,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1966.27,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,8377.084,8387.894,Is there any way under Maryland law where he can now do -- these petitions can do anything that so far as this newly discovered evidence.
1966.27,2,39989,robert_c_murphy,,8387.894,8391.959,I think basically Your Honor the newly discovered evidence is that what she says is suppressed.
1966.27,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,8391.959,8392.87,I beg your pardon?
1966.27,2,39989,robert_c_murphy,,8392.87,8394.355,"Yeah, she is doing it right now."
1966.27,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,8414.174,8426.399,"Yes, well I just begging your co-counsel has said that this wasn't admissible because of Maryland law."
1966.27,2,39989,robert_c_murphy,,8439.96,8440.68,I think not.
1966.27,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,8440.68,8441.277,You think not?
1966.27,2,39989,robert_c_murphy,,8441.277,8444.078,I think not.
1966.27,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,8444.078,8445.055,Thank you.
1966.27,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,8445.055,8451.121,"Mr. Forer, before you begin, may I ask I gather if you prevail, there will have to be a new trial."
1966.27,3,30227,joseph_forer,,8451.121,8452.237,Yes.
1966.27,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,8452.237,8457.252,"And I take it, I think presently stand a new trial but again was all on the death penalty."
1966.27,3,30227,joseph_forer,,8457.252,8458.306,Yes.
1966.27,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,8458.306,8460.3,The Giles brothers familiar with that?
1966.27,3,30227,joseph_forer,,8460.3,8461.682,They certainly are.
1966.27,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,8461.682,8463.409,And they are willing to?
1966.27,3,30227,joseph_forer,,8463.409,8468.187,"They are not only willing, they have insisted."
1966.27,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,8485.536,8490.036,Did the state's counsel agreed with that?
