2004.03-1488,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,11.274,"We'll hear argument now in No. 03-1488, Ulysses Tory v. Johnnie L. Cochran."
2004.03-1488,0,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,13.03,14.091,Good morning.
2004.03-1488,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,67.054,68.198,How about you?
2004.03-1488,0,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,70.817,71.571,"Yes, I am, Your Honor."
2004.03-1488,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,84.608,91.337,"Mr. Chemerinsky, you speak about the injunction, and the injunction has three parts."
2004.03-1488,0,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,118.472,118.992,"No, Your Honor."
2004.03-1488,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,143.398,155.496,"But your question is preventing all future speech about an admitted public figure, and the first and third provisions of this injunction do not prohibit all future speech."
2004.03-1488,0,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,155.496,157.683,"Yes, Your Honor, that's correct."
2004.03-1488,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,168.965,172.734,But that isn't what you've said in the question presented.
2004.03-1488,0,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,178.422,180.337,"Well, of course, you're limited to the question presented."
2004.03-1488,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,194.616,207.76,"Yes, but you understand Justice Ginsburg's question surely, and I would imagine that even if you prevail, nothing we would order would affect the first and third parts."
2004.03-1488,0,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,207.76,214.186,"Well, Your Honor, certainly we believe that the injunction is most clearly unconstitutional in its overbreadth."
2004.03-1488,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,232.354,233.268,"Well, but that doesn't--"
2004.03-1488,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,233.268,238.451,"Mr. Chemerinsky, is it true that your client intends to go on defaming Mr. Cochran?"
2004.03-1488,0,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,238.451,239.808,"No, Your Honor."
2004.03-1488,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,244.876,248.441,Does he intend to continue making the same comments that he made before?
2004.03-1488,0,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,248.441,253.561,His exact words were that perhaps he would continue to express his view that Mr. Cochran owes him money.
2004.03-1488,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,253.561,254.026,All right.
2004.03-1488,0,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,268.713,269.908,"Yes, Your Honor."
2004.03-1488,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,269.908,270.214,What is it?
2004.03-1488,0,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,270.214,271.733,"There is, of course, a remedy."
2004.03-1488,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,285.879,289.353,"But if... if the defendant is judgment-proof, what good does that do?"
2004.03-1488,0,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,289.353,294.405,"--Your Honor, there is a damage judgment that forever would be available against the person."
2004.03-1488,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,298.602,304.342,"Well... well, your... your answer should be to Justice O'Connor there is no effective legal remedy under your theory of the case."
2004.03-1488,0,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,304.342,306.817,"--No, Your Honor, I would disagree with that."
2004.03-1488,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,306.817,309.309,"I mean, you... you say he has the remedy of... of counter-speech."
2004.03-1488,0,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,316.948,319.257,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2004.03-1488,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,333.363,338.058,"Well, it... it seems to me that that really avoids the problem... the problem."
2004.03-1488,0,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,343.769,351.955,"--But then, Justice Kennedy, it can't be the rule that poor people have their speech enjoined, but those with assets can continue to speak in the future."
2004.03-1488,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,351.955,359.907,"--Well, it also can't be the rule that poor people can defame ad libitum and... and people who have money cannot."
2004.03-1488,0,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,362.383,368.856,"No, Your Honor, but that's why there would be, of course, the ability of a court to issue a damage judgment."
2004.03-1488,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,371.628,373.847,It's worthless against a... against a person who has no assets.
2004.03-1488,0,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,373.847,376.343,"But that's true everywhere in the legal system, Your Honor."
2004.03-1488,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,383.067,385.148,That's another one that is in your brief.
2004.03-1488,0,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,408.762,410.407,"--I would disagree, Your Honor."
2004.03-1488,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,417.203,418.143,Not... not this injunction.
2004.03-1488,0,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,442.861,450.43,"--Your Honor, what I am saying is that the question presented does ask whether this injunction, which permanently restricts speech--"
2004.03-1488,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,450.43,450.579,"No, it doesn't."
2004.03-1488,0,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,458.466,460.579,--We would argue--
2004.03-1488,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,460.579,467.74,There's nothing about this particular injunction which is based upon speech that is not defamation.
2004.03-1488,0,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,469.101,476.038,"--Your Honor, our position is that question asks whether an injunction violates the First Amendment, and certainly it is about this case."
2004.03-1488,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,481.464,481.687,All right.
2004.03-1488,0,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,481.687,482.042,"Now, if that's so--"
2004.03-1488,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,482.042,494.014,"Well... well, there really... there are findings against you, and to say that a lawyer is a crook, a liar, and a thief and you're trying to tell us that that's not defamatory, I mean, I... I think we should just proceed on... on some other basis for this argument."
2004.03-1488,0,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,495.733,495.941,--Sure.
2004.03-1488,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,518.534,519.01,--All right.
2004.03-1488,0,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,621.427,626.88,I would suggest three different ways in which you could write the opinion that distinguished the case.
2004.03-1488,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,689.001,694.258,"Mr. Chemerinsky, this case comes up to us from a California appellate court."
2004.03-1488,0,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,698.775,712.832,"--Yes, Your Honor, but they did not base their decision on the privacy claim because California law is clear that when it's false light invasion of privacy brought together with a defamation action, the false light claim is dismissed."
2004.03-1488,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,716.77,723.399,"Well, we're not going to debate among ourselves over what California law is."
2004.03-1488,0,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,723.399,724.069,"No, Your Honor."
2004.03-1488,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,743.686,747.215,"Suppose this picketing had taken place in front of his house, every day in front of his house."
2004.03-1488,0,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,747.215,750.661,"Your Honor, under Frisby v. Schultz, that would be a different situation."
2004.03-1488,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,752.907,753.244,All right.
2004.03-1488,0,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,779.95,780.754,"--Well, Your Honor--"
2004.03-1488,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,780.754,784.647,--that disparages quality of goods to the serious injury of a... of a business?
2004.03-1488,0,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,784.647,790.721,"--Actually, Your Honor, the vast majority of cases have held that you cannot have an injunction for product defamation."
2004.03-1488,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,813.775,830.211,"Well, if... if this under... the underlying claim seems to be that Mr. Cochran is essentially being blackmailed; that is, this... this... your client wants tribute to go away."
2004.03-1488,0,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,848.849,850.676,"--Yes, Your Honor, there is."
2004.03-1488,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,860.864,865.244,What kind of a jurisprudence is it that a person can go to jail but that he's freed from an injunction?
2004.03-1488,0,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,867.117,872.807,"Well, Your Honor, that's because this Court has said that injunctions of speech are even worse than criminal penalties."
2004.03-1488,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,874.304,876.817,But... but why... is that true in every case?
2004.03-1488,0,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,894.359,905.815,"--But, Your Honor, I'd remind you of this Court's language in the Vance v. Universal Amusement where the Court said presumption against prior restraints is heavier and the degree of protection broader than against limits on criminal penalties."
2004.03-1488,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,905.815,907.203,"I know, but I'm asking you why that... why that should be."
2004.03-1488,0,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,918.688,924.441,"But, Your Honor, in terms of the First Amendment, there are reasons why an injunction has always been regarded as worse."
2004.03-1488,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,924.441,924.957,Always?
2004.03-1488,0,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,938.801,942.425,"Your Honor, I don't want to push the principle at all to harassment."
2004.03-1488,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,966.409,975.026,"Why can't we say that speech that is... is being used for extortion is different, just as speech which is being used for harassment is different?"
2004.03-1488,0,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,984.989,989.401,"--Yes, Your Honor, there can be an injunction for extortion, but this was not extortion."
2004.03-1488,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1010.121,1021.381,"Here I think there was... why isn't there a use of fear when, you know, you're afraid of this person destroying your business by calling you a liar and a cheat?"
2004.03-1488,0,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,1026.669,1032.027,"--Your Honor, this Court is required to do an independent review of the record under Bose v. Consumers Union."
2004.03-1488,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1054.175,1061.847,"Mr. Chemerinsky, the district... I mean, the trial court made certain findings and I'm looking at page 42 of the joint appendix."
2004.03-1488,0,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,1122.232,1132.524,"But, Your Honor, since this is a defamation action, not an extortion action, the rules under the First Amendment for defamation have to apply."
2004.03-1488,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1139.261,1141.651,"Well, so this finding... the court shouldn't have made these findings?"
2004.03-1488,0,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,1142.771,1145.341,"Well, Your Honor, I believe that the--"
2004.03-1488,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1145.341,1147.992,Was there an objection to the testimony that established this?
2004.03-1488,0,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,1147.992,1149.758,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2004.03-1488,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1157.645,1164.202,"No, but it seems to me... and I think what bothers me is... is what bothers Justice Kennedy."
2004.03-1488,0,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,1230.715,1231.669,"No, Your Honor."
2004.03-1488,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1256.623,1265.288,"Well, it can certainly... the... the issue is certainly before us as to whether such an injunction can be issued with respect to defamation pure and simple."
2004.03-1488,0,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,1308.977,1311.327,"I would disagree in this way, Your Honor."
2004.03-1488,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1320.972,1324.184,"With respect to the defamation, pure and simple."
2004.03-1488,0,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,1342.816,1347.822,"But, Your Honor, it was not treated here as an action for extortion or harassment--"
2004.03-1488,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1347.822,1350.254,"Mr. Chemerinsky, let me put the question this way."
2004.03-1488,0,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,1376.269,1379.244,"--Your Honor, I would say the history of the First Amendment is different."
2004.03-1488,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1395.796,1397.342,May I ask this... may I ask this question?
2004.03-1488,0,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,1412.927,1419.412,"No, Your Honor, because the law is clear that injunctions are not a permissible remedy in defamation cases."
2004.03-1488,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1419.412,1420.797,What's the best authority you have for that proposition?
2004.03-1488,0,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,1420.797,1428.346,Near v. Minnesota would be the best authority where this Court said clearly that injunctive relief should not be awarded in a defamation case.
2004.03-1488,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1428.346,1435.566,Add to Justice Stevens'... add to Justice Stevens' hypothetical that he shows that he's losing some clients.
2004.03-1488,0,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,1435.566,1441.187,"But, Your Honor, even... yes, Your Honor."
2004.03-1488,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1446.693,1449.361,Would you add too that he's judgment-proof?
2004.03-1488,0,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,1449.361,1458.311,"Well, again, as I said to Justice O'Connor, I don't think it can matter whether he's judgment-proof because we can't have a different rule that we allow poor people's speech to enjoin and not wealthy people."
2004.03-1488,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1458.311,1468.71,You're saying... you're saying that a State cannot constitutionally prohibit someone from making false statements in front of the business that causes the business to lose money.
2004.03-1488,0,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,1468.71,1471.265,"Well, Your Honor, there are other causes of action that may allow that."
2004.03-1488,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1472.313,1477.09,"So I'm... my question is, is this constitutional to prohibit this conduct?"
2004.03-1488,0,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,1477.09,1479.414,"--Not in a defamation action, Your Honor."
2004.03-1488,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1479.414,1479.921,That's--
2004.03-1488,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1479.921,1480.111,I--
2004.03-1488,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1480.111,1481.195,--that's not the question.
2004.03-1488,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1481.195,1483.358,But what is your authority for that proposition?
2004.03-1488,0,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,1483.358,1491.755,"Well, I would say that the authority comes from the fact that never in 214 years has this Court ever upheld an injunction in a defamation case."
2004.03-1488,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1491.755,1493.339,Have we ever set aside an injunction that did that?
2004.03-1488,0,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,1493.339,1495.473,"Well, not under those facts."
2004.03-1488,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1495.473,1495.902,Have we done it either way?
2004.03-1488,0,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,1495.902,1496.199,No.
2004.03-1488,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1497.108,1501.986,Have we ever... have we ever considered a case where there's a strong element of extortion involved?
2004.03-1488,0,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,1501.986,1505.674,"I would say yes, extortion for Austin v. Keith."
2004.03-1488,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1513.973,1515.444,"Very well, Mr. Chemerinsky."
2004.03-1488,0,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,1515.444,1515.714,Thank you.
2004.03-1488,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1515.714,1518.598,"Mr. Cole, we'll hear from you."
2004.03-1488,1,29573,jonathan_b_cole,,1518.598,1523.587,"Mr. Chief Justice Rehnquist, and may it please the Court:"
2004.03-1488,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1551.746,1555.465,"Well, do you... do you defend the injunction in its entirety?"
2004.03-1488,1,29573,jonathan_b_cole,,1555.465,1557.216,Yes--
2004.03-1488,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1557.216,1579.578,"In other words, the... the... Mr. Chemerinsky didn't have too much chance to... to get very far into it, but one of his points was that there was... quite apart from any injunction against picketing, harassment, et cetera, there was an injunction simply against speech on a given subject directed to a lot of people with no limit of time."
2004.03-1488,1,29573,jonathan_b_cole,,1583.405,1584.195,--Yes.
2004.03-1488,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1588.985,1598.95,"Well, it was directed, number one, to a named person who was not a party to the case, and it was directed to agents and employees of... of the named party."
2004.03-1488,1,29573,jonathan_b_cole,,1607.926,1618.25,--I believe this Court said in Madsen that that would raise an abstract controversy that Mr. Tory doesn't have standing to attack the injunction for other persons who are not before the court.
2004.03-1488,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1627.067,1628.748,"Well, let me ask you a law school question."
2004.03-1488,1,29573,jonathan_b_cole,,1643.248,1651.394,"--I defend the injunction, and respondent defends the injunction on the ground that it is conduct that was being enjoined--"
2004.03-1488,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1651.394,1652.237,I... I asked you--
2004.03-1488,1,29573,jonathan_b_cole,,1652.237,1652.992,--from the use of unprotected speech.
2004.03-1488,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1652.992,1655.112,--to exclude the... the issue of conduct.
2004.03-1488,1,29573,jonathan_b_cole,,1681.101,1683.892,"Yes, we defend the injunction."
2004.03-1488,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1683.892,1686.945,Let's take specifically the words of the injunction.
2004.03-1488,1,29573,jonathan_b_cole,,1695.582,1696.416,Yes.
2004.03-1488,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1696.416,1698.688,You say that someone can be enjoined--
2004.03-1488,1,29573,jonathan_b_cole,,1698.688,1705.352,"Based upon the unique facts of this case, Justice Ginsburg, I say somebody can be enjoined."
2004.03-1488,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1707.463,1711.089,"Well, you can't square that with the Near case at all."
2004.03-1488,1,29573,jonathan_b_cole,,1718.665,1727.874,"But in Near, they set forth certain factors, and those factors included that it was not a private redress of private wrongs."
2004.03-1488,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1734.635,1735.069,You don't know that.
2004.03-1488,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1735.069,1735.324,You don't--
2004.03-1488,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1735.324,1737.39,You don't know what future speech is going to be.
2004.03-1488,1,29573,jonathan_b_cole,,1745.927,1754.343,"But, Justice Scalia, what I'm relying on is the fact that he has engaged in 3 years in a pattern of continuing, repetitive conduct."
2004.03-1488,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1754.343,1759.109,"Well, what... what you're saying is that an... an injunction can be overbroad based on past wrongful conduct."
2004.03-1488,1,29573,jonathan_b_cole,,1761.653,1768.308,I'm not suggesting that this injunction is necessarily overbroad based upon that proposition because I believe there are--
2004.03-1488,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1768.308,1774.633,"But we have just pointed out that it... that it... it prohibits lawful, harmless, truthful speech."
2004.03-1488,1,29573,jonathan_b_cole,,1774.633,1777.857,"--I disagree with that, Justice Kennedy."
2004.03-1488,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1777.857,1779.835,"--Well, it does on its face."
2004.03-1488,1,29573,jonathan_b_cole,,1784.246,1791.838,"Well, if you're asking me, based upon the breadth of the injunction, what I... if... if there was... are you asking me what I would do to modify the injunction?"
2004.03-1488,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1803.773,1805.956,"Now, let... let me ask you about that."
2004.03-1488,1,29573,jonathan_b_cole,,1832.803,1833.555,Yes.
2004.03-1488,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1864.345,1884.445,"So... so if... before leaving that point, what the injunction prohibits is that Tory and those acting in concert, cooperation, or participation with him from, in a public forum, orally uttering statements about Cochran."
2004.03-1488,1,29573,jonathan_b_cole,,1905.301,1906.305,Absolutely not.
2004.03-1488,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1906.305,1907.956,Absolutely not.
2004.03-1488,1,29573,jonathan_b_cole,,1908.495,1910.097,"First of all, that's why--"
2004.03-1488,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1910.097,1910.833,It said the words.
2004.03-1488,1,29573,jonathan_b_cole,,1915.648,1918.746,--Because I don't believe that's a public forum.
2004.03-1488,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1918.746,1919.78,"Oh, no, no."
2004.03-1488,1,29573,jonathan_b_cole,,1932.252,1940.047,"Your... Your Honor, I believe there are alternative channels of communication here."
2004.03-1488,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1940.047,1940.71,No.
2004.03-1488,1,29573,jonathan_b_cole,,1955.484,1956.366,"Well, I was--"
2004.03-1488,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1956.366,1957.39,"But, now, you haven't said that."
2004.03-1488,1,29573,jonathan_b_cole,,1962.185,1969.797,"--I think I said it when I said there was a continuing pattern of repetitive conduct under Pittsburgh Press, over 3 years that that was the conduct that he has engaged in."
2004.03-1488,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1979.946,1989.922,"In more than one case, we've said that an injunction has to be precise and clear and not leaving things to the imagination."
2004.03-1488,1,29573,jonathan_b_cole,,1989.922,1992.51,"Well, I think this is precise and clear."
2004.03-1488,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2005.593,2007.281,"Well, it's... it's--"
2004.03-1488,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2007.281,2009.403,But nothing in the injunction refers to prior conduct.
2004.03-1488,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2009.403,2010.23,--That's right.
2004.03-1488,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2010.771,2012.747,The injunction just speaks for itself.
2004.03-1488,1,29573,jonathan_b_cole,,2015.673,2017.281,--The injunction--
2004.03-1488,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2017.281,2019.842,You cannot picket Cochran or Cochran's law firm.
2004.03-1488,1,29573,jonathan_b_cole,,2020.875,2039.728,"--If we restricted the injunction to specific words used such as you cannot picket Johnnie Cochran's law firm and say he's a crook, liar, and thief, the response will be that he'll come up with five new words to defame Mr. Cochran for purposes of extorting--"
2004.03-1488,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2039.728,2040.984,"Well, maybe there are different grades of specificity."
2004.03-1488,1,29573,jonathan_b_cole,,2046.328,2055.478,"--Well, there could be no picketing for purposes of... no... which contains defamatory speech for purposes of extorting Mr. Cochran."
2004.03-1488,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2057.464,2065.735,All I'm suggesting is just draft it... just excising (ii) and (iii) from paragraph 2 would not necessarily solve the problem completely.
2004.03-1488,1,29573,jonathan_b_cole,,2073.181,2086.668,"--Well, I would disagree based upon the prior... continuing course of... of repetitive conduct and the fact that this... over a period 3 years, once a week, this man spent 3 to 4 hours a day of his time defaming Mr. Cochran at his law office."
2004.03-1488,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2131.314,2133.802,--You... you did draft this injunction.
2004.03-1488,1,29573,jonathan_b_cole,,2141.558,2142.523,--It--
2004.03-1488,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2142.523,2144.498,This... the terms of this injunction.
2004.03-1488,1,29573,jonathan_b_cole,,2144.498,2148.671,"--Were aided... were aided by my advocacy, Your Honor."
2004.03-1488,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2148.671,2152.689,Aided and--
2004.03-1488,1,29573,jonathan_b_cole,,2152.689,2156.602,"Well said, Chief Justice Rehnquist."
2004.03-1488,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2170.818,2171.298,--Why?
2004.03-1488,1,29573,jonathan_b_cole,,2194.922,2205.199,"--I think we would be... that injunction then would be attacked on being vague or ambiguous, that Mr. Tory wouldn't have sufficient notice as to what he was allowed to say and not allowed to say."
2004.03-1488,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2206.697,2209.659,"Well, if... if that's so, then maybe Mr. Chemerinsky is right."
2004.03-1488,1,29573,jonathan_b_cole,,2218.418,2219.069,--No.
2004.03-1488,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2257.833,2268.693,"--You can... you can certainly have, you know, some unprotected speech in connection with extortion, like give me $5 million or I'll shoot you."
2004.03-1488,1,29573,jonathan_b_cole,,2284.754,2286.968,"--It certainly does, Justice Rehnquist."
2004.03-1488,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2312.183,2316.159,But the injunction isn't limited to the same conduct.
2004.03-1488,1,29573,jonathan_b_cole,,2316.159,2323.989,But I don't think it needs to be because of the pattern and practice that this man has engaged in over 3 years.
2004.03-1488,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2337.86,2339.304,I thought he lived in L.A.--
2004.03-1488,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2344.009,2345.752,I think he'd like to get him up to San Francisco.
2004.03-1488,1,29573,jonathan_b_cole,,2347.688,2356.208,"He can certainly seek to modify the injunction, and that, as I pointed out in a subsequent letter brief, there's... California doesn't adopt the collateral bar rule."
2004.03-1488,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2395.057,2397.697,"Well, I'm... I'm baffled by that."
2004.03-1488,1,29573,jonathan_b_cole,,2403.046,2404.595,"No, no, no, no."
2004.03-1488,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2405.881,2407.333,I... I fell off the track here.
2004.03-1488,1,29573,jonathan_b_cole,,2407.333,2415.218,"--All I'm... all I'm saying is that if the collateral bar rule was in effect, you would waive your right to contest."
2004.03-1488,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2437.738,2442.15,"Oh, yes, but he's different from other citizens because he's at... he's at risk of a contempt citation."
2004.03-1488,1,29573,jonathan_b_cole,,2442.15,2443.26,--I don't dispute that.
2004.03-1488,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2443.26,2446.858,"I mean, his speech is being chilled with... with respect to protected speech."
2004.03-1488,1,29573,jonathan_b_cole,,2446.858,2448.636,But there's nothing unusual--
2004.03-1488,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2448.636,2452.206,So the collateral bar rule doesn't help you at all because he's subject to a contempt citation.
2004.03-1488,1,29573,jonathan_b_cole,,2452.206,2464.065,"--He's subject to it, but there's a check and balance there in terms of when you balance, the potential remedy for Mr. Cochran... what... what is going to give Mr. Cochran the remedy he needs?"
2004.03-1488,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2475.681,2477.032,But it would be so easy.
2004.03-1488,1,29573,jonathan_b_cole,,2498.803,2499.568,That's exactly--
2004.03-1488,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2499.568,2505.754,"And you are saying if in fact it's ever enforced outside that heartland, you can have a defense."
2004.03-1488,1,29573,jonathan_b_cole,,2523.333,2525.599,"--And I have no dispute with that, Justice Breyer."
2004.03-1488,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2542.499,2543.044,That's what he's arguing.
2004.03-1488,1,29573,jonathan_b_cole,,2545.124,2550.056,"--I'm saying if this Court... well, I'm gleaning the impression that this Court thinks it's overbroad."
2004.03-1488,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2550.056,2553.357,"Ah, you're very perceptive."
2004.03-1488,1,29573,jonathan_b_cole,,2556.555,2564.111,"And having gleaned that perception, I'm trying to suggest that, number one, there was no attack on paragraphs 1 and 3, and now we're focused on paragraph 2."
2004.03-1488,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2581.95,2584.319,You're sort of saying the opposite of what your opponent said.
2004.03-1488,1,29573,jonathan_b_cole,,2586.593,2588.836,--It's never been there.
2004.03-1488,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2588.836,2589.109,What are we taking away?
2004.03-1488,1,29573,jonathan_b_cole,,2589.109,2593.308,I... I agree it's never... you've never found it there and you've never said it can't be there.
2004.03-1488,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2593.308,2595.242,How does California work in that respect?
2004.03-1488,1,29573,jonathan_b_cole,,2642.417,2651.418,"Yes, I think that you could limit the injunction to defamatory speech of a similar nature designed to extort."
2004.03-1488,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2651.418,2653.376,Would... would that make Mr. Cochran happy?
2004.03-1488,1,29573,jonathan_b_cole,,2678.242,2681.425,"No, and I think that would be subject to the same injunctive relief."
2004.03-1488,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2695.334,2695.741,You've got to give us some line.
2004.03-1488,1,29573,jonathan_b_cole,,2712.48,2719.57,I don't think you need to place a limitation other than you can enjoin the defamation conduct.
2004.03-1488,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2730.46,2731.513,But then you run into the public figure.
2004.03-1488,1,29573,jonathan_b_cole,,2758.872,2764.118,"There's no authority, but there's no authority that says you can't do it."
2004.03-1488,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2812.32,2817.029,But you've just said something that I think that's inconsistent with your earlier presentation.
2004.03-1488,1,29573,jonathan_b_cole,,2842.74,2862.412,"Well, Justice Ginsburg, I think where that leaves us is you'd have to engage in some sort of balancing about the... how narrowly tailored the injunction is and does it provide a sufficient remedy and, you know... and... and in this... and what test we would analyze it under, strict scrutiny, intermediate scrutiny, or the Ward test."
2004.03-1488,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2883.38,2897.458,"Now, you... you... to the extent that you're complaining about extortion-like conduct, something else that you drafted... I'm looking at the complaint on page 7 of the joint appendix."
2004.03-1488,1,29573,jonathan_b_cole,,2912.723,2929.379,"--If you'd... if I could direct you, Justice Ginsburg, to page 12 of the joint appendix at paragraphs (j) and (k) of the verified complaint, you will see that we alleged in a verified complaint that he'd engaged in three previous efforts of this same type of conduct, one."
2004.03-1488,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2935.752,2937.005,I... I was going to ask you about that.
2004.03-1488,1,29573,jonathan_b_cole,,2940.043,2942.867,--Findings to substantiate--
2004.03-1488,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2942.867,2950.013,Specifically about the extorting money from the bank and the oil company.
2004.03-1488,1,29573,jonathan_b_cole,,2950.013,2952.269,"--No, Justice Kennedy, there were not."
2004.03-1488,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2952.269,2952.439,No findings.
2004.03-1488,1,29573,jonathan_b_cole,,2952.439,2956.701,"There was some testimony only on one of those issues, which was the oil company."
2004.03-1488,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2977.947,2989.501,"But what... what I mean is could you have... without using the label defamation, have stated a claim for extortion or blackmail?"
2004.03-1488,1,29573,jonathan_b_cole,,3005.774,3009.918,--I think we could have pled extortion had we chose to.
2004.03-1488,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3015.637,3022.076,Does California law require you to label the type of the cause of action or is it notice pleading based on facts?
2004.03-1488,1,29573,jonathan_b_cole,,3022.076,3025.244,"--Notice pleading based on facts, but we do label the causes of action."
2004.03-1488,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3170.599,3172.876,"Thank you, Mr. Cole."
2004.03-1488,2,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,3175.815,3177.046,Thank you.
2004.03-1488,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3231.352,3239.993,"Yes, but you're asking us now to... the... the trial court found there was defamation, and now you want to argue, no, it wasn't defamation."
2004.03-1488,2,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,3245.503,3249.101,I think it is because it goes to the question whether the injunction is permissible.
2004.03-1488,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3310.847,3317.031,"There have been... there have been injunctions against harassing conduct, threatening, stalking."
2004.03-1488,2,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,3317.031,3321.846,"--Yes, Your Honor, and we have no objection to injunctions of that sort."
2004.03-1488,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3332.312,3334.658,"Thank you, Mr. Chemerinsky."
