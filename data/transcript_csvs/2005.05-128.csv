2005.05-128,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.904,"We'll hear argument first today in 05-128, Howard Delivery Service v. Zurich American Insurance Company."
2005.05-128,0,55316,paul_farrell_strain,,9.189,11.974,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
2005.05-128,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,86.939,90.491,Can I get you to step back just... the presumption that you began with.
2005.05-128,0,55316,paul_farrell_strain,,97.145,111.071,"The strongest authority for that, Your Honor, is the opinion in Kothe, K, o, t, h, e, a 1930 opinion, followed by Nathanson, followed by Embassy Restaurant, and it is the--"
2005.05-128,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,111.071,114.523,Nathanson is the... you cite the dissenting opinion for this proposition?
2005.05-128,0,55316,paul_farrell_strain,,114.523,115.323,--No.
2005.05-128,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,198.39,200.74,Where... where is the unomitted language?
2005.05-128,0,55316,paul_farrell_strain,,202.156,211.612,"--It's on page 20, Your Honor, of Zurich."
2005.05-128,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,279.989,312.293,"Now, ERISA... ERISA makes it very clear that... that a plan to pay insurance for employee benefits, whether it's disability or retirement or whatever else, is an employee benefit plan and... and explicitly excludes workmen's comp because otherwise it would fall within that definition of an employee benefit plan."
2005.05-128,0,55316,paul_farrell_strain,,312.293,313.959,"I believe that is... is correct, Justice Scalia."
2005.05-128,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,313.959,315.828,I know that's a different statute.
2005.05-128,0,55316,paul_farrell_strain,,328.819,330.171,"I disagree with you, Justice Scalia--"
2005.05-128,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,330.171,330.488,All right.
2005.05-128,0,55316,paul_farrell_strain,,330.838,332.538,--to this... to this extent.
2005.05-128,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,402.883,407.62,Would it... would it if the employer were self insured?
2005.05-128,0,55316,paul_farrell_strain,,409.72,411.82,The employer can be self insured for workers'--
2005.05-128,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,411.82,413.605,Would that be a plan then?
2005.05-128,0,55316,paul_farrell_strain,,413.605,440.255,"--I think it would not, Your Honor, because the self insurance for workers' comp, as I understand them, what they normally do is, just as the Court referred to in that omitted section of the Pegram opinion, is it simply is... is an agreement that it will provide the necessary wherewithal and bonding to pay the benefits as specified, as they may change from time to time in a State statute."
2005.05-128,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,456.348,459.9,"So it would be an employee benefit program, but not a plan."
2005.05-128,0,55316,paul_farrell_strain,,459.9,465.886,"--It would be, Your Honor, or in the case of our case, an employee benefit policy."
2005.05-128,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,469.254,472.706,"Before you... before you go on, could you satisfy a curiosity of mine?"
2005.05-128,0,55316,paul_farrell_strain,,495.62,507.928,"--Your Honor, I don't know that there is any good way to do that, and I think that's one of the anomalies in trying to superimpose an insurance policy under the rubric of an employee benefit plan."
2005.05-128,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,514.082,517.866,"Oh, if it said premiums due within the last 180 days, I could understand it--"
2005.05-128,0,55316,paul_farrell_strain,,517.866,522.152,--And there is a mechanism in the policy to determine the payment of premiums.
2005.05-128,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,522.152,528.056,But isn't... doesn't the mechanism take into account the number of employees who are on the rolls at any given time?
2005.05-128,0,55316,paul_farrell_strain,,528.056,528.972,"I believe it does, Your Honor."
2005.05-128,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,528.972,541.63,"Well, if that's the case, then... then doesn't the premium that you're supposed to pay depend in... in... on the number of employees within the last 180 days, which in turn depends on their working in the last 180 days?"
2005.05-128,0,55316,paul_farrell_strain,,541.63,548.217,It is not understanding... and I may be mistaken because this policy was not placed in the record by Zurich.
2005.05-128,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,554.354,554.354,"Well, how... maybe you just don't know the answer."
2005.05-128,0,55316,paul_farrell_strain,,554.354,567.178,"--certainly, Justice Souter, you may be right, but we've checked the proof of claim filed by Zurich which started this off, and they did not attach the workers' compensation insurance policy to it."
2005.05-128,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,570.546,573.498,So that's... that's really not an issue for us.
2005.05-128,0,55316,paul_farrell_strain,,573.498,575.414,"--Well, I... I will not say that it's not an issue, Your Honor."
2005.05-128,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,577.264,584.851,"Well, if you want to make it an issue, you'd have to get the... the predicate in the record to do it, and... and we just don't have that."
2005.05-128,0,55316,paul_farrell_strain,,584.851,585.534,--Well--
2005.05-128,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,585.534,587.453,We... we couldn't resolve that.
2005.05-128,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,587.453,591.822,--Or else establish that there's no conceivable way that 180 days makes any sense.
2005.05-128,0,55316,paul_farrell_strain,,591.822,598.343,"--And... and I... I think that, as... as I hope may blend the answers to both questions."
2005.05-128,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,598.76,600.61,"Consider us together, yes."
2005.05-128,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,600.61,601.212,We're together on this.
2005.05-128,0,55316,paul_farrell_strain,,602.012,605.847,--I... I think that is... I think that is where we... where we are.
2005.05-128,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,624.542,636.516,"Is there anything in the statute which says how promptly the premiums have to be paid as it... to... to make it analogous, say, to withholding where you might have to pay every quarter on... by a certain day?"
2005.05-128,0,55316,paul_farrell_strain,,645.538,649.923,"Well... well, certainly the priority statute does not because the priority statute doesn't--"
2005.05-128,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,649.923,651.723,No. I meant the State workmen's comp law.
2005.05-128,0,55316,paul_farrell_strain,,651.723,653.458,--The State workers'... workers' comp law.
2005.05-128,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,676.271,689.964,"If you have an employer who says, I promise to give $200 a month per worker to a fund, which money will go to pay their health costs when they're sick, that's plainly covered."
2005.05-128,0,55316,paul_farrell_strain,,689.964,691.364,"--Yes, it is, Your Honor."
2005.05-128,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,691.364,705.974,"And now suppose it's exactly the same, but instead of his paying $200 a month, he pays $200 to an insurance company in return for a promise that they'll pay precisely the same amount to the employee if he gets sick."
2005.05-128,0,55316,paul_farrell_strain,,707.259,714.83,"In our view... in our view, Your Honor... I... if... if I may, I think that the hypothetical you pose is not quite our case."
2005.05-128,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,714.83,715.08,Of course.
2005.05-128,0,55316,paul_farrell_strain,,715.896,716.396,It... it--
2005.05-128,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,716.396,719.764,I want to know how you are going to answer my hypothetical.
2005.05-128,0,55316,paul_farrell_strain,,720.597,727.184,"--Your Honor, I... I think the... the focus of the answer should be on whether it is an employee benefit or not."
2005.05-128,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,727.184,729.386,I'm not... I'm asking you--
2005.05-128,0,55316,paul_farrell_strain,,729.386,729.969,Yes.
2005.05-128,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,729.969,732.338,--to answer my hypothetical please.
2005.05-128,0,55316,paul_farrell_strain,,734.804,735.956,"No, no."
2005.05-128,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,736.49,737.473,Then what is the answer?
2005.05-128,0,55316,paul_farrell_strain,,737.473,737.973,"--I understand it, Your Honor."
2005.05-128,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,737.973,740.425,"In your view, is my hypothetical covered or not?"
2005.05-128,0,55316,paul_farrell_strain,,740.425,741.591,"I... I think it is not, Your Honor."
2005.05-128,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,741.591,742.341,It is not.
2005.05-128,0,55316,paul_farrell_strain,,742.341,742.341,I think--
2005.05-128,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,742.341,758.601,"And therefore, if we accept your interpretation, then all those employers who, instead of contributing directly to health funds, instead buy insurance policies to do the same thing, will discover they do not have the advantage of the fifth priority."
2005.05-128,0,55316,paul_farrell_strain,,758.601,759.067,--All right.
2005.05-128,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,767.205,787.368,"Now, if they are covered... if they are covered, as I thought, then what is the difference whether the employer buys a policy whereby the insurance companies pays for their health benefit when they're sick or pays for their accident benefit when they have an accident at work?"
2005.05-128,0,55316,paul_farrell_strain,,787.368,791.487,"--Your Honor, I think the difference are... are several."
2005.05-128,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,813.936,836.699,"The... the correlative hypothetical would be a plan such as Justice Breyer describes in which the employer has contracted to pay his employees $200 a month for when they're sick, and that's a contractual obligation of his, and then he buys insurance to cover that contractual obligation."
2005.05-128,0,55316,paul_farrell_strain,,836.699,837.385,And--
2005.05-128,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,837.385,838.851,You say that would be this case.
2005.05-128,0,55316,paul_farrell_strain,,838.851,840.018,"--That would be this case, Your Honor."
2005.05-128,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,840.018,841.42,And you say that wouldn't be covered.
2005.05-128,0,55316,paul_farrell_strain,,841.42,850.209,"And that would not be covered, and that would not be covered in great part because it is an employer benefit, employer choice, employer benefit."
2005.05-128,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,851.443,853.561,"Well, that's... that's a better way to put it."
2005.05-128,0,55316,paul_farrell_strain,,884.699,885.016,--No.
2005.05-128,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,912.349,912.766,And why did--
2005.05-128,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,912.766,913.699,And that's clearly covered.
2005.05-128,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,913.699,917.253,--why did you answer Justice Scalia's question as you did?
2005.05-128,0,55316,paul_farrell_strain,,923.157,931.161,"Your Honor, I answered that because, as Justice Scalia changed the hypothetical, it was not an employee benefit."
2005.05-128,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1028.991,1034.579,Would the same thing happen under multi employer plans?
2005.05-128,0,55316,paul_farrell_strain,,1042.835,1053.023,"It would... they would typically... in a multi employer plan, as many of our priority claimants are here, because the money is spread, the employees still get some money."
2005.05-128,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1063.498,1091.666,"I thought there's also, isn't there, the Pension Benefit... even if there's no money in the till for the plan, isn't there a Government fund so that the worker would receive the benefit in any event if... I don't see the distinction that you're making based on whether the worker would get a benefit whether or not the employer made the contribution."
2005.05-128,0,55316,paul_farrell_strain,,1091.666,1111.979,"--Well, Your Honor, there certainly is... there certainly are... in most States at least, there certainly are funds that step in if a workers' comp insurer or an employer does not make... is not available to pay an award to a workers' comp injured... a worker who was injured on the job."
2005.05-128,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1127.089,1129.691,"Well, I recognize there are different schemes."
2005.05-128,0,55316,paul_farrell_strain,,1141.764,1142.098,Yes.
2005.05-128,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1144.466,1150.704,And is there any requirement that there be an actual fund in place or is it just a general liability?
2005.05-128,0,55316,paul_farrell_strain,,1150.704,1156.841,"--Well, there is... there is... it is a... a traditional self insurance with the overlay."
2005.05-128,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1169.016,1169.432,A bond.
2005.05-128,0,55316,paul_farrell_strain,,1169.432,1182.408,"--which is an interesting point because if Zurich prevails, we have the... the camel's nose is under the tent because in all the self insurance contexts, the bond issuer will have an equivalent claim to Zurich."
2005.05-128,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1251.132,1252.818,"Well, if there were letters of credit, why is Zurich injured?"
2005.05-128,0,55316,paul_farrell_strain,,1255.52,1256.87,"They... they were not, Your Honor."
2005.05-128,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1257.638,1258.222,Mr. Strain--
2005.05-128,0,55316,paul_farrell_strain,,1290.027,1291.743,It... I haven't mentioned it.
2005.05-128,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1317.658,1318.574,Where does (a)(3) appear?
2005.05-128,0,55316,paul_farrell_strain,,1322.943,1324.228,"--Section (a)(3), Your Honor."
2005.05-128,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1351.979,1353.497,"Well, it would have been nice to have it in your brief--"
2005.05-128,0,55316,paul_farrell_strain,,1353.497,1354.147,I agree.
2005.05-128,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1354.147,1355.98,--and numbered... numbered 3 instead of 4.
2005.05-128,0,55316,paul_farrell_strain,,1357.099,1359.865,"I... I certainly recognize that, Your Honor."
2005.05-128,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1439.05,1456.595,"Let... let me, if I may, ask you about other possible wage surrogates because what you're saying now seems to me to mesh with the argument, another legislative history argument, to the effect that the... the current provision was meant to overrule two prior cases of this Court."
2005.05-128,0,55316,paul_farrell_strain,,1485.448,1490.768,"Well, Your Honor, I... I would answer from... in part from the legislative history."
2005.05-128,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1561.198,1562.664,"Thank you, Mr. Strain."
2005.05-128,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1564.666,1571.387,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
2005.05-128,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1587.313,1589.515,You're begging the question by calling it a plan.
2005.05-128,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1597.121,1615.433,"--Well, I'd be happy to go right to the question of whether it's a plan, Justice Scalia, because I think it's indisputably a plan under this... under the dictionary definition, ordinary meaning of plan, this Court's interpretation of it in Pegram, under ERISA, under the Department of Labor's interpretation of it, and under plain common sense."
2005.05-128,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1631.794,1639.464,"Mr. Verrilli, there's no employer or employee, for that matter, who's doing the planning."
2005.05-128,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1641.233,1641.75,"See, I... I--"
2005.05-128,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1641.75,1644.202,--because what's covered is prescribed by law.
2005.05-128,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1644.202,1647.654,"--I think there is a plan for this reason, Justice Ginsburg."
2005.05-128,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1682.058,1683.343,But the it is not negotiable.
2005.05-128,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1706.57,1716.562,"I agree that that aspect of the arrangement is not negotiated, but there is nonetheless an arrangement that secures and guarantees the provisions of the benefits, and that's the plan."
2005.05-128,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1728.185,1740.66,"So that if an employer decides to... because his employees have had a good year, he's going to put in a new parking lot for them... he... his plan is to have a contact with a paving company to pave the parking lot."
2005.05-128,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1746.664,1749.783,"--I don't think the answer to that question is yes, Mr. Chief Justice."
2005.05-128,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1756.337,1757.789,It seems like the consequence of your theory though--
2005.05-128,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1757.789,1758.639,--I don't think so.
2005.05-128,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1784.77,1792.709,"--But... but providing for workers' compensation through insurance, rather than through self insurance, is also not on the list."
2005.05-128,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1792.709,1802.981,"--Well, I think both of them are on the list actually, Mr. Chief Justice, because both of those are programs or arrangements to secure the provision of benefits, and one is through insurance and the other through self... insurance."
2005.05-128,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1804.933,1808.885,What's your answer to the 180 days' question I answered... I asked?
2005.05-128,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1825.245,1825.729,Right.
2005.05-128,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1825.729,1831.148,How do you square that with... with the purchase of block insurance like this?
2005.05-128,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1831.148,1848.86,"Well, because the amounts that Zurich is seeking in premiums are the amounts that were due for providing coverage during the 180 days before Howard ceased operations, and the reason that arises from... it seems to me there are two ways in which that could arise from services rendered."
2005.05-128,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1870.523,1882.497,But each of those insurance premiums that's paid by the employer doesn't just cover workers who worked for the last 180 days.
2005.05-128,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1893.286,1893.736,--Well--
2005.05-128,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1893.736,1898.257,"I mean, it just seems to me it's a square peg in a round hole."
2005.05-128,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1901.309,1911.83,"--I appreciate that, Justice Scalia, but I do think the... the obligation on the part of the employer to keep paying that premiums during that period arises from the fact that the employees are continuing to work during that period."
2005.05-128,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1920.872,1928.109,"If... if they don't pay the premium with respect to the 180 days, if there's an accident during the 180 days, the insurance doesn't cover the accident."
2005.05-128,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1928.109,1935.096,"--That's an important point, Justice Souter, and I would like to focus on that and I... I hope correct something that the petitioners said."
2005.05-128,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1996.67,2000.038,--You really think that... that they cut it that fine?
2005.05-128,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2005.876,2006.659,--It's absolutely--
2005.05-128,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2006.659,2009.811,"I think as soon as they smell bankruptcy, they're going to pull the plug anyway."
2005.05-128,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2009.811,2012.096,"--That... I... I disagree with that, Justice Scalia."
2005.05-128,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2043.282,2046.953,There... there are two parts in my mind to this.
2005.05-128,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2090.179,2101.218,"--I think my answer would be the same as to the Chief Justice that in some sense, I suppose you could say it's an employee benefit; in some sense, I suppose you could say that there's a contract to provide it."
2005.05-128,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2107.973,2121.448,"Well, actually... this is... to me anyway, this is an important point because at some point you have to draw the line between the things of a kind that workers might bargain for and things not."
2005.05-128,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2126.185,2127.618,"--Well, I don't... I don't think so, Justice Breyer--"
2005.05-128,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2127.618,2128.301,Because?
2005.05-128,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2130.053,2136.041,"--Well, first, if I can make a prefatory point, that the bottled water example doesn't distinguish the petitioners' position from our position."
2005.05-128,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2147.931,2154.768,"Well, sure, if they have a contract, as part of their... part of their contract, they get the bottled water, that's... that's easy to see why that's covered."
2005.05-128,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2163.607,2164.574,"--Right, but--"
2005.05-128,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2164.574,2167.226,It has to be arising from services rendered.
2005.05-128,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2171.963,2173.18,"--Well, I... I don't think that's right."
2005.05-128,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2184.27,2198.428,"But there's one feature of this that is... does make it different, at least one, and that is this is a benefit to the employer in the way that the others are not."
2005.05-128,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2216.27,2222.423,"--Well, the fact that there may be a benefit to the employer doesn't make it any less of an employee benefit."
2005.05-128,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2262.584,2264.369,"May I ask this question, Mr. Verrilli?"
2005.05-128,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2264.369,2264.969,--better morale.
2005.05-128,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2264.969,2268.937,Can I... can I ask you... it goes back to the first point your opponent made.
2005.05-128,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2294.136,2297.44,"I think there are four things I'd like to say in response to that, Justice Stevens."
2005.05-128,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2304.277,2310.931,"Well, it talks about contributions to an employee benefit plan which one would not normally think of as paying insurance premiums."
2005.05-128,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2310.931,2314.216,"--And the second think... well, I think to the contrary, Justice Stevens."
2005.05-128,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2355.441,2369.35,"--Mr. Verrilli, what... what is your response to Mr. Strain's assertion that if you get a priority, so should the secondary insurer, that is, the... the bank that gave letters of credit?"
2005.05-128,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2396.166,2396.966,The answer is no.
2005.05-128,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2413.776,2414.809,Where... where does that appear?
2005.05-128,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2414.809,2415.511,--I'm sorry.
2005.05-128,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2417.161,2418.096,"Yes, because it's not in the briefs--"
2005.05-128,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2418.096,2419.663,"--I'm sorry, Justice Scalia."
2005.05-128,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2419.663,2421.465,--just... just as the contract isn't before us.
2005.05-128,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2421.465,2422.715,It should be in the briefs.
2005.05-128,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2431.071,2437.075,"But if the payment of the premiums doesn't increase the likelihood that the employees will get the benefits, why should you get priority?"
2005.05-128,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2437.075,2443.479,"It does increase the likelihood, and it goes back to the example I was... I was discussing with Justice Souter earlier."
2005.05-128,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2458.754,2463.808,"What... what about the... the example we discussed, payment of a bond premium if you're self insured?"
2005.05-128,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2463.808,2464.875,--No.
2005.05-128,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2470.296,2471.796,How do we know what you've just told us?
2005.05-128,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2480.518,2482.02,The insurance contract is not in the record.
2005.05-128,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2482.703,2485.988,So we... we have your assurance that that's what happens here.
2005.05-128,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2485.988,2490.44,"--As a systematic matter... it seems to me as a systematic matter, this is what insurance companies will do."
2005.05-128,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2497.677,2498.46,"Well, it has to be that way?"
2005.05-128,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2500.629,2503.914,"--Well... well, sure, but the contracts comply with State law."
2005.05-128,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2514.905,2515.138,That's a--
2005.05-128,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2515.138,2516.821,"Mr. Verrilli, before--"
2005.05-128,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2516.821,2521.208,But I was... can... can I... I still don't quite understand the answer to the bond premium question.
2005.05-128,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2521.208,2532.498,"Well, that... there would be no priority there because that would be... that would be a subrogated claim, and the last section of section of... the last provision of section 507 says if you're subrogated to a--"
2005.05-128,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2532.498,2532.85,No.
2005.05-128,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2538.401,2539.836,"--Well, I don't think--"
2005.05-128,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2539.836,2541.602,And it files the claim directly with the bankruptcy.
2005.05-128,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2541.602,2547.59,"--I don't think that would be a claim for contribution to the plan, Your Honor, in the same sense that we're talking about here."
2005.05-128,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2548.406,2555.262,"You couldn't have the plan without the bond, just as here you wouldn't have a plan without the insurance policy."
2005.05-128,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2557.312,2570.188,"--Well, I'm... I think there's an order of... there's another order of degree of removal, and it would make it a harder question, I suppose, as to whether there would be a... whether there would be a claim for priority in that context."
2005.05-128,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2574.99,2577.009,--May I detract you just for a moment?
2005.05-128,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2625.089,2625.422,Yes.
2005.05-128,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2683.508,2692.447,"Mr. Verrilli, your... your friend's argument about the interrelation between (a)(3) and (a)(4) seems like a compelling one."
2005.05-128,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2693.197,2716.812,"I think the complete explanation for the relationship between (a)(3) and (a)(4) was that Congress was trying to expand the scope of the priority here without doing damage either to the wage priority above it, which... and... and there would have been damage to the wage priority above it if wages were simply redefined to include the broader set of employee benefits... or to the priorities below."
2005.05-128,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2798.245,2806.85,"Counsel, much of your case hinges on the assumption that Congress incorporated the ERISA definition into the bankruptcy code."
2005.05-128,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2809.1,2816.473,"Well, I think the fact that the phrase is identical to the phrase that appears in ERISA, employee benefit plan, is significant."
2005.05-128,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2884.914,2891.752,"To follow up on the earlier question of the Chief Justice, by whom do you understand the services have to be rendered within the meaning of the act?"
2005.05-128,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2891.752,2895.687,"Well, I think that the... I think that the statute could be read--"
2005.05-128,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2895.687,2898.888,Does it refer to the... the bankrupt's employees or your employees?
2005.05-128,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2898.888,2901.173,"--It could be the... it could be either, it seems to me, Justice Stevens."
2005.05-128,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2901.173,2901.757,You think it could be either.
2005.05-128,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2901.757,2906.577,And I... but I don't think it matters in this case because you get to the same answer either way.
2005.05-128,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2918.802,2919.921,--But it's not just to those.
2005.05-128,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2921.587,2923.456,--But it... but it arises from.
2005.05-128,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2940.667,2943.15,"--Well, except the workers who had already been injured in the past--"
2005.05-128,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2943.15,2943.702,"--Right, but you don't need--"
2005.05-128,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2943.702,2945.552,--and... and whom you continue to pay.
2005.05-128,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2945.752,2946.654,--But... yes.
2005.05-128,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2953.474,2954.258,Right.
2005.05-128,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2954.258,2956.26,--and... but... and so--
2005.05-128,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2956.26,2970.168,"And I assume that each of your premiums takes into account the fact that you're not only going to be paying for people, you know, who were injured between the last premium and now, but that you're also going to be paying for people who were injured a long time ago."
2005.05-128,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2970.168,2972.285,"--Well, depending on the kind of policy, that may be true to some extent."
2005.05-128,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3110.424,3113.793,What is... what is unemployment compensation?
2005.05-128,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3125.101,3129.688,"No, because the employer doesn't have the obligation to provide unemployment compensation."
2005.05-128,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3202.9,3204.336,"Thank you, Mr. Verrilli."
2005.05-128,2,55316,paul_farrell_strain,,3207.002,3208.721,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2005.05-128,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3248.781,3250.281,"Well, they're doing that to get a standard."
2005.05-128,2,55316,paul_farrell_strain,,3250.281,3251.081,"I'm sorry, Your Honor?"
2005.05-128,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3251.081,3262.589,And I'd like to know what your... they're trying to use that as a basis for separating the bottled water from the workmen's comp from the health benefit.
2005.05-128,2,55316,paul_farrell_strain,,3283.935,3297.325,"What we look to, Justice Breyer, first of all, is whether it is a true wage substitute rather than a policy to take care of a nonnegotiable statutory requirement that's--"
2005.05-128,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3297.325,3308.383,"So if, in fact... if, in fact, the State legislature mandates certain health benefits, then the plan that provides those benefits would no longer qualify."
2005.05-128,2,55316,paul_farrell_strain,,3308.383,3311.769,"--That would be one significant factor to consider, Your Honor."
2005.05-128,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3456.294,3456.294,"Thank you, Mr. Strain."
2005.05-128,2,55316,paul_farrell_strain,,3456.294,3456.294,Thank you.
2005.05-128,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3456.294,3460.294,The case is submitted.
