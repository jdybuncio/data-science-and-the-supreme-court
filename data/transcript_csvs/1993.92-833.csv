1993.92-833,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.986,"We'll hear argument next in No. 92-833, Kevin Albright v. Roger Oliver."
1993.92-833,0,29011,john_h_bisbee,,45.0,52.226,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1993.92-833,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,52.226,53.405,"Wait just a minute, Mr. Bisbee."
1993.92-833,0,29011,john_h_bisbee,,59.45,62.23,"--Thank you, Your Honor."
1993.92-833,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,173.305,174.535,"Well, Mr. Bisbee."
1993.92-833,0,29011,john_h_bisbee,,174.535,175.586,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1993.92-833,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,175.586,186.061,Why is it that the mere filing of a criminal charge without more should constitute a deprivation of liberty?
1993.92-833,0,29011,john_h_bisbee,,197.899,211.359,"Your Honor, I believe if that charge is without probable cause... it is without deprivation of liberty, but the Court need not reach that question particularly under the circumstances--"
1993.92-833,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,211.359,223.167,"Well, why should it be, in light of holdings that, for instance, a defamatory statement by a government official would not constitute a deprivation of liberty?"
1993.92-833,0,29011,john_h_bisbee,,223.167,232.383,"--A defamatory statement by a government official does not deprive liberty because it does not deprive any right protected by the Constitution of the United States, Your Honor."
1993.92-833,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,271.63,281.457,"So your contention is that even though he is never arrested on the criminal charge, that the mere filing of it deprives him of liberty."
1993.92-833,0,29011,john_h_bisbee,,281.457,285.43,"If the mere filing of it is without probable cause, Your Honor, that is my contention."
1993.92-833,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,287.912,292.584,"Mr. Bisbee, he was arrested, and police officers don't prosecute, they arrest."
1993.92-833,0,29011,john_h_bisbee,,343.387,352.763,"Justice Ginsburg, it is altogether correct, as you state, that the police officer's original and customary duty is to make the arrest."
1993.92-833,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,402.835,406.879,What is the police officer doing other than backing up his arrest?
1993.92-833,0,29011,john_h_bisbee,,441.911,444.072,--I must respectfully disagree with the predicate of your question.
1993.92-833,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,464.625,472.482,Couldn't that be regarded simply as consistent with and perpetuating the arrest status of the defendant?
1993.92-833,0,29011,john_h_bisbee,,472.482,475.075,"Well, it certainly is part of that."
1993.92-833,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,507.195,520.982,"What is the closest decision of this Court, Mr. Bisbee, that supports your contention that the interests of the defendant in not being prosecuted on probable cause is a substantive liberty interest?"
1993.92-833,0,29011,john_h_bisbee,,520.982,524.174,Probably Brinegar v. the United States.
1993.92-833,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,525.707,526.578,What was the first one?
1993.92-833,0,29011,john_h_bisbee,,526.578,530.041,"--Brinegar v. the United States, decided in 1949."
1993.92-833,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,530.041,532.753,"Well, that didn't... that dealt with the Fourth Amendment."
1993.92-833,0,29011,john_h_bisbee,,532.753,533.404,It certainly did.
1993.92-833,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,541.389,556.578,"Well, Brinegar was a case in a Federal court and the dicta certainly didn't say that not being... freedom from prosecution without probable cause is a substantive liberty interest, did it?"
1993.92-833,0,29011,john_h_bisbee,,556.578,558.749,"--Your Honor, it came awfully close."
1993.92-833,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,575.632,587.968,"Well, do you think we should then go through all our cases that explain the reason for the adoption of, say, the Fourth Amendment or the Fifth Amendment, and say that all of those reasons become substantive liberty interests?"
1993.92-833,0,29011,john_h_bisbee,,587.968,591.851,"Well, I think... in your case... in this situation, Your Honor, the answer is yes."
1993.92-833,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,645.757,656.754,"You're taking three cases, all of which were decided against the claimant of constitutional rights, and saying that dicta in them have created a new constitutional right."
1993.92-833,0,29011,john_h_bisbee,,656.754,672.004,"--Your Honor, I'm saying that the dicta in those cases created the assumption that has been implicit in this Court's decisions from... as long... as far back as 1884 in an explicit sense, that probable cause is required to support a prosecution."
1993.92-833,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,672.004,677.647,"Mr. Bisbee, are you familiar with Graham against Connor, a 1989 decision of this Court?"
1993.92-833,0,29011,john_h_bisbee,,677.647,678.168,Yes.
1993.92-833,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,678.168,683.982,Which seemed to me similar in that there was an argument that we shift from the Fourth Amendment to the Fifth Amendment.
1993.92-833,0,29011,john_h_bisbee,,691.057,692.547,That's because it was a Fourth Amendment case.
1993.92-833,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,700.793,714.262,"Wasn't Mr. Albright seized throughout... from the time that he first showed up until the time that that criminal charge was dropped, wasn't he technically seized?"
1993.92-833,0,29011,john_h_bisbee,,714.262,715.251,--Certainly.
1993.92-833,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,719.275,723.696,But I thought you were claiming that he was seized without probable cause?
1993.92-833,0,29011,john_h_bisbee,,723.696,726.019,"Well, he was seized without probable cause."
1993.92-833,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,726.518,727.86,Isn't that a Fourth Amendment violation?
1993.92-833,0,29011,john_h_bisbee,,727.86,728.191,--That would have been.
1993.92-833,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,728.702,731.393,Without... you can do it as gently as possible.
1993.92-833,0,29011,john_h_bisbee,,731.393,732.204,--Pardon... excuse me?
1993.92-833,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,732.204,733.694,You can do it entirely gently.
1993.92-833,0,29011,john_h_bisbee,,737.477,738.318,That part of it is.
1993.92-833,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,756.128,764.925,Is it... is it an incident that the person is in a state of seizure until the criminal prosecution is dropped.
1993.92-833,0,29011,john_h_bisbee,,773.27,778.924,"--Your Honor, it's an attribute of being arrested at some point."
1993.92-833,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,787.51,795.103,"I can understand your argument if the arrest started at a certain point and stopped, and then the charge started at a certain point."
1993.92-833,0,29011,john_h_bisbee,,808.453,820.652,"Well, in the... the easy answer to that in this case, as you pointed out, was that the statute of limitations was not abided by by the plaintiff in this case, and therefore he had no Fourth Amendment claim."
1993.92-833,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,825.935,830.507,But why do you... you take that to be gospel.
1993.92-833,0,29011,john_h_bisbee,,844.665,845.136,--Maybe so.
1993.92-833,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,846.057,846.718,But you didn't argue that.
1993.92-833,0,29011,john_h_bisbee,,846.718,849.0,--I didn't argue that and it's not how I understood the law.
1993.92-833,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,872.504,895.86,"All right, assuming it does and assuming that we were to accept your position by approaching the case not on the assumption that Justice Ginsburg has questioned on, but on the assumption that somehow there is an independent set of interests at stake, your answer to Justice O'Connor's question in which you were telling, sort of, what the... what the consequences were, were all property consequences."
1993.92-833,0,29011,john_h_bisbee,,910.519,913.301,"Well, those too are money issues, those too are property issues."
1993.92-833,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,917.134,926.841,"They don't turn it into a liberty claim, do they, independent of the liberty interest implicated by the arrest and its consequences for him?"
1993.92-833,0,29011,john_h_bisbee,,926.841,929.502,"--Not necessarily so, but they are alleged in the complaint in this case."
1993.92-833,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,932.264,932.784,"No, I realize that."
1993.92-833,0,29011,john_h_bisbee,,942.63,959.731,"--Well, we believe they are, Your Honor, for the simple reason that the liberty to be free from a prosecution, with all of its attendant consequences, is... entails--"
1993.92-833,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,959.731,966.365,Well then under the Takings Clause we've got a liberty interest because the property owner has a liberty interest in being free from improper takings.
1993.92-833,0,29011,john_h_bisbee,,969.968,971.859,--But that's a specific prohibition.
1993.92-833,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,981.816,984.708,Isn't there some majesty in property under due process?
1993.92-833,0,29011,john_h_bisbee,,984.708,985.659,"--Well, certainly there is, Your Honor."
1993.92-833,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1000.629,1002.339,You can't go after the prosecutor.
1993.92-833,0,29011,john_h_bisbee,,1002.9,1004.091,That's so.
1993.92-833,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1004.091,1014.049,Isn't it odd that you're going after the police officer whose main job is to arrest for a prosecution because you can't go against the prosecutor?
1993.92-833,0,29011,john_h_bisbee,,1016.241,1020.083,"We, Your Honor, you know there's certainly superficial appeal to that position."
1993.92-833,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1031.96,1046.51,"Well, Mr. Bisbee, it could well be that the police officer just sees what he sees and reports it to the prosecutor without being negligent or deficient or misleading, and the prosecutor makes a decision to proceed."
1993.92-833,0,29011,john_h_bisbee,,1046.51,1047.869,In which case the police--
1993.92-833,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1047.869,1050.231,Should the police officer be liable?
1993.92-833,0,29011,john_h_bisbee,,1050.231,1053.294,"--No, he shouldn't be, and I don't think he would be because there--"
1993.92-833,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1053.294,1056.188,Absent any misleading or misconduct?
1993.92-833,0,29011,john_h_bisbee,,1056.188,1069.174,"--He would... if what the police officer presented to the prosecutor is within the realm of what the Court talked about as being within the realm of objective reasonableness in Malley v. Briggs, the police officer would not be liable."
1993.92-833,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1070.305,1072.106,Let me ask you something else.
1993.92-833,0,29011,john_h_bisbee,,1076.838,1082.872,We rest the claim on the right to travel as an incident of the liberty.
1993.92-833,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1122.549,1123.651,And you didn't mention in--
1993.92-833,0,29011,john_h_bisbee,,1132.835,1137.53,"Well, I believe... you may be correct."
1993.92-833,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1144.204,1151.167,"Well, it may be alleged in the complaint, but the complaint was a couple of years ago back in the district court."
1993.92-833,0,29011,john_h_bisbee,,1158.573,1160.604,"Well, I'll concede that certainly, Your Honor."
1993.92-833,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1198.308,1207.654,"Mr. Bisbee, you are making a constitutional tort analogue for the common law tort of malicious prosecution."
1993.92-833,0,29011,john_h_bisbee,,1218.273,1227.476,"It was... Your Honor, it was dismissed with leave, without prejudice, under the provisions of rule 41(a)(1), (2), or something like that, without prejudice."
1993.92-833,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1264.162,1267.996,You're saying one reason... one reason was the statute of limitations.
1993.92-833,0,29011,john_h_bisbee,,1271.728,1274.947,"Well, that did create a final judgment, Your Honor, correct."
1993.92-833,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1282.143,1298.143,"And you never did argue that on the... on the false arrest, or Fourth Amendment arrest without probable cause, that the statute of limitations might have run from the dismissal of the charges rather than from the date of the arrest?"
1993.92-833,0,29011,john_h_bisbee,,1298.143,1299.535,"I did not argue that, Your Honor."
1993.92-833,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1307.46,1315.276,A good faith argument... you think it's meritless to say that the statute of limitations might have run from when the arrest ended rather than from when the arrest started?
1993.92-833,0,29011,john_h_bisbee,,1315.276,1318.498,--As I understand the... as I understood the law at that time.
1993.92-833,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1333.698,1338.16,"Mr. Bisbee, could I go back to what Justice O'Connor was asking."
1993.92-833,0,29011,john_h_bisbee,,1362.136,1363.366,Your Honor--
1993.92-833,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1363.366,1364.437,Other than the arrest.
1993.92-833,0,29011,john_h_bisbee,,1364.437,1364.968,--Your Honor--
1993.92-833,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1364.968,1367.899,You say he had have to spend money to defend himself.
1993.92-833,0,29011,john_h_bisbee,,1372.572,1382.249,"--Your Honor, the processes of the State are not invoked in any formal sense in the case of an incidental defamation by someone who happens--"
1993.92-833,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1382.249,1382.56,So what.
1993.92-833,0,29011,john_h_bisbee,,1385.201,1391.525,"--Who... Your Honor, who cares about processes when you're facing the prospect of jail, when you're facing the prospect of punishment, when you're facing--"
1993.92-833,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1391.525,1392.757,You could say the same thing in the defamation case.
1993.92-833,0,29011,john_h_bisbee,,1400.972,1401.87,"--Your Honor, that may be the situation."
1993.92-833,1,32862,james_g_sotos,,1499.495,1503.989,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1993.92-833,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1569.682,1579.898,Does the existence of the cause of action for malicious prosecution in the State of Illinois have a bearing on any one of those three rationales that you've mentioned?
1993.92-833,1,32862,james_g_sotos,,1579.898,1586.223,We think it would have some bearing on our second submission with respect to the procedures that are provided by the State.
1993.92-833,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1601.742,1602.293,All right.
1993.92-833,1,32862,james_g_sotos,,1612.529,1613.41,We--
1993.92-833,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1613.41,1619.914,But that doesn't seem to me to account for the malicious prosecution action which I'm somewhat surprised that is missing from your analysis.
1993.92-833,1,32862,james_g_sotos,,1619.914,1633.274,"--Well, we do believe that under a Parratt v. Taylor type analysis, that the fact that the State of Illinois provides a common law tort remedy for malicious prosecution certainly makes it much easier for the Court to conclude that the entirety of Illinois' procedures are adequate."
1993.92-833,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1637.924,1638.145,Yes.
1993.92-833,1,32862,james_g_sotos,,1654.858,1661.35,"We think that the focus, for purposes of a procedural due process analysis, should be on the entirety of the remedies that the State provides."
1993.92-833,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1668.096,1672.49,But then your argument would be the same if there were no malicious prosecution action in the State of Illinois?
1993.92-833,1,32862,james_g_sotos,,1672.49,1686.207,"That would be a difficult... more difficult case, but we would... I would not take the position that the State remedies were rendered inadequate solely because a State chose to do away with its common law tort remedy."
1993.92-833,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1686.207,1690.241,"So you're relying on the State criminal procedure apparatus to vindicate the defendant's rights, correct?"
1993.92-833,1,32862,james_g_sotos,,1690.241,1694.512,"In this case we're not, Your Honor, because the State of Illinois does provide the common law tort remedy."
1993.92-833,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1715.637,1732.777,"Well, so, Mr. Sotos, you take the view, then, that if the officer makes an arbitrary arrest without probable cause there is no Fourth Amendment violation simply because the State has its criminal procedures to take care of these things?"
1993.92-833,1,32862,james_g_sotos,,1732.777,1734.239,"--No, certainly we do not take that position."
1993.92-833,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1751.461,1764.309,"Well, do you think there might be a valid substantive due process claim made on the basis of travel restrictions that are imposed as a result of an unlawful arrest?"
1993.92-833,1,32862,james_g_sotos,,1764.309,1765.799,I don't think so.
1993.92-833,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1769.582,1770.481,And why not?
1993.92-833,1,32862,james_g_sotos,,1770.481,1774.324,Because in this particular case--
1993.92-833,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1774.324,1777.807,"That is a constitutionally protected liberty interest, is it not?"
1993.92-833,1,32862,james_g_sotos,,1777.807,1778.368,"--Certainly, it is."
1993.92-833,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1786.132,1798.4,"Well, but if it results in an order saying you can't leave and all of this was obtained on the basis of an unlawful arrest, is there... is there some deprivation of the right to travel there?"
1993.92-833,1,32862,james_g_sotos,,1798.4,1804.424,"--I would say not in this case, because there is no allegation here that the petitioner even sought to leave the State."
1993.92-833,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1804.424,1805.884,Well suppose that is the allegation?
1993.92-833,1,32862,james_g_sotos,,1805.884,1823.586,"Under those circumstances, if there had been an allegation that the petitioner sought to leave the State, I would submit that the restriction that the State of Illinois imposes on the fundamental right to travel is a very narrowly tailored restriction which is necessary to serve the State's compelling interest of insuring that criminal defendants appear for trial."
1993.92-833,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1823.586,1829.132,So it's okay to enter such an order even though it is based on an arrest made without probable cause.
1993.92-833,1,32862,james_g_sotos,,1829.76,1830.461,No.
1993.92-833,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1856.067,1861.452,May I give you hypothetical that has kind of troubled me as I've thought about this case.
1993.92-833,1,32862,james_g_sotos,,1887.138,1890.501,"So, the probable cause would dissipate from the point of arrest--"
1993.92-833,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1890.501,1890.771,Correct.
1993.92-833,1,32862,james_g_sotos,,1890.771,1891.871,--To the time of moving forward.
1993.92-833,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1898.986,1901.528,Supposing it was just restriction to the bond conditions.
1993.92-833,1,32862,james_g_sotos,,1906.182,1917.69,"No, we would contend that under those circumstances that's not a significant enough restraint on liberty to warrant a separate determination of probable cause and to prevent the State from going forward."
1993.92-833,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1917.69,1920.12,The restraint is precisely the same as the one that was caused by the arrest.
1993.92-833,1,32862,james_g_sotos,,1920.12,1943.796,"Again, we would distinguish between the restraint that is caused by the arrest, which is an actual seizure where the person's body is taken into custody, and the restraint which may be imposed by the conditions of the bond, which... and in saying that, we don't seek to minimize or belittle the fact that a criminal defendant, even one who is on bail, can suffer a substantial price in terms of anxiety, emotional distress, and--"
1993.92-833,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1943.796,1953.591,"Mr. Sotos, isn't a criminal defendant technically in a state of arrest, whether he's out on bond, until the proceeding concludes?"
1993.92-833,1,32862,james_g_sotos,,1953.591,1955.153,"--I don't think so, Justice Ginsburg."
1993.92-833,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1961.217,1974.905,"Isn't... isn't, even on the civil side, the historical notion that the sheriff tags a person, brings that person before the tribunal, and that seizure is what gives the tribunal authority?"
1993.92-833,1,32862,james_g_sotos,,1987.514,1989.114,--I would disagree with that.
1993.92-833,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2011.74,2013.851,So in this case you say there was never really any arrest.
1993.92-833,1,32862,james_g_sotos,,2021.496,2024.039,"Well, the petitioner alleges that he was under arrest."
1993.92-833,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2024.317,2029.322,And I thought that that was accepted by the district court and by the court of appeals.
1993.92-833,1,32862,james_g_sotos,,2029.322,2030.302,--Certainly.
1993.92-833,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2040.459,2045.531,"What was the moment of that arrest, since he wasn't... he wasn't, in fact, seized by a police officer?"
1993.92-833,1,32862,james_g_sotos,,2045.531,2052.917,"--Perhaps at the point where he had to go through the indignities of the booking process, being photographed, taken through the process."
1993.92-833,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2061.873,2068.576,You think... the criminal defendant has asked the question; are you arrested after the charge is lodged?
1993.92-833,1,32862,james_g_sotos,,2071.491,2072.82,That's correct.
1993.92-833,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2121.022,2135.932,"Whether the arrest technically persists until the end, certainly the effects of the arrest continue until the person is discharged, until the indictment is dismissed... or the information, in this case."
1993.92-833,1,32862,james_g_sotos,,2135.932,2146.688,"I would concede that certainly the criminal defendant suffers the effects, the anxiety and the emotional distress as a result of the pendency of all of the proceedings against him, which may include the fact that he had been arrested."
1993.92-833,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2165.781,2172.204,Even if there are restrictions where he can travel on his release?
1993.92-833,1,32862,james_g_sotos,,2174.895,2187.414,"That, again, would depend upon... I think that would depend on an allegation that the petitioner would have to make that the proceedings were brought in order to curtail his fundamental right to travel and--"
1993.92-833,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2187.414,2195.071,"Is the arrest over once he's released from the jailhouse, even though he's told he can't leave the State?"
1993.92-833,1,32862,james_g_sotos,,2195.071,2198.431,--If he was told that he could not leave the State.
1993.92-833,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2198.431,2198.732,Right.
1993.92-833,1,32862,james_g_sotos,,2198.732,2199.653,That would perhaps be true.
1993.92-833,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2208.848,2213.761,"Well, if we said don't leave the State unless we tell you you can, that's what you should say."
1993.92-833,1,32862,james_g_sotos,,2221.678,2233.065,"--Well, again, I think that the... for purposes of analyzing the... any claim that... which would be based on a fundamental right to travel, the focus would have to be on whether or not the State's restriction was narrowly tailored to serve its compelling State interests."
1993.92-833,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2233.065,2233.884,I'm not talking about right to travel now.
1993.92-833,1,32862,james_g_sotos,,2242.071,2244.172,If you're told--
1993.92-833,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2244.172,2247.544,"And if you say no, my next question is going to be what if you can't leave the city?"
1993.92-833,1,32862,james_g_sotos,,2247.544,2257.071,"--I would think that that would... if you're told you can't leave the city or the State, that that would be tantamount to perhaps a continuation of the arrest."
1993.92-833,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2262.394,2264.665,That was my question.
1993.92-833,1,32862,james_g_sotos,,2284.667,2294.144,We don't view that as a necessary... as an acceptable justification for not going into court and asking the court to leave... to leave the State.
1993.92-833,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2294.144,2302.539,"But the question is doesn't that restraint show that the arrest is, indeed, continuing, that he can't leave the State without getting permission from the court?"
1993.92-833,1,32862,james_g_sotos,,2302.539,2303.361,Again--
1993.92-833,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2303.361,2306.443,"If he weren't arrested, why would he need the State's permission?"
1993.92-833,1,32862,james_g_sotos,,2306.443,2307.672,--We would not make that concession.
1993.92-833,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2328.067,2333.03,You cannot leave the State unless the court permits you to.
1993.92-833,1,32862,james_g_sotos,,2333.03,2336.292,"Unless you first seek leave of court, correct."
1993.92-833,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2336.292,2350.682,"Well, I suppose you would argue at least that before a defendant subject to that sort of a bond could raise the question, he would have had to go and see if he might have been allowed to leave the State."
1993.92-833,1,32862,james_g_sotos,,2350.682,2363.23,"Certainly, that is our contention, that the individual would at least have to allege that he sought to leave the State and he was restricted from doing so, before he would raising a claim based on a fundamental right to travel."
1993.92-833,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2369.745,2372.824,I wasn't asking about a fundamental right to travel.
1993.92-833,1,32862,james_g_sotos,,2382.732,2392.609,"--We would contend that under the circumstances of this case he was not under arrest after he left the police station, and was essentially free to go about his daily affairs with very few restrictions by the State."
1993.92-833,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2392.609,2401.926,"And if he couldn't make bail so that he was actually incarcerated, would his claim be a Fourth Amendment or Fifth Amendment claim?"
1993.92-833,1,32862,james_g_sotos,,2401.926,2415.213,"We believe that under Gerstein v. Pugh that would be a Fourth Amendment claim, because Gerstein held that the Fourth Amendment requires a preliminary determination of probable cause to all criminal defendants who are incarcerated who don't make bail."
1993.92-833,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2470.459,2476.202,"Which was time barred, and that's why it was dropped?"
1993.92-833,1,32862,james_g_sotos,,2476.202,2490.363,Early in the proceedings in the district court I pointed out to Mr. Bisbee that the Illinois Tort Immunity Act required common law claims against public officials to be brought within 1 year... a common law malicious prosecution claim to be brought within 1 year of the dismissal of the charges.
1993.92-833,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2494.053,2494.804,Without prejudice?
1993.92-833,1,32862,james_g_sotos,,2494.804,2497.006,"--Without prejudice, that's correct."
1993.92-833,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2560.148,2560.889,I don't quite understand that argument.
1993.92-833,1,32862,james_g_sotos,,2570.046,2571.295,--That's correct.
1993.92-833,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2581.513,2582.732,And then don't they have a false arrest charge?
1993.92-833,1,32862,james_g_sotos,,2582.732,2583.473,--Pardon?
1993.92-833,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2583.473,2590.478,"If they can do that, don't they have a false arrest claim as a matter of State law, if they're going to argue there was no probable cause?"
1993.92-833,1,32862,james_g_sotos,,2590.478,2594.38,That would address probable cause for the filing of the... for the arrest.
1993.92-833,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2594.38,2594.72,Right.
1993.92-833,1,32862,james_g_sotos,,2594.72,2598.092,But in this particular case... a little background about this case.
1993.92-833,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2598.473,2603.155,I thought you said you needed malice for the State... for the State claim to be sustained.
1993.92-833,1,32862,james_g_sotos,,2603.155,2604.417,--Of a malicious prosecution claim.
1993.92-833,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2604.417,2604.658,Yes.
1993.92-833,1,32862,james_g_sotos,,2604.658,2605.028,That's true.
1993.92-833,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2606.518,2607.279,But not false arrest.
1993.92-833,1,32862,james_g_sotos,,2607.279,2608.16,--That's correct.
1993.92-833,2,29011,john_h_bisbee,,2732.412,2733.971,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1993.92-833,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2733.971,2742.917,"Maybe you can clarify whether you're urging here reversal of the judgment against the city... the City of Macomb, or is that out of the case now?"
1993.92-833,2,29011,john_h_bisbee,,2742.917,2744.667,It's not out of the case.
1993.92-833,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2749.262,2752.564,On the basis of what?
1993.92-833,2,29011,john_h_bisbee,,2752.564,2755.646,"Now, let me see if I... perhaps I misunderstood your question, Justice Ginsburg."
1993.92-833,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2755.646,2762.639,I understood that the... the City of Macomb was out of it because there was no pattern or practice or something to establish--
1993.92-833,2,29011,john_h_bisbee,,2762.639,2763.35,That's correct.
1993.92-833,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2781.202,2788.448,"--Well, where is that in your question... your question presented certainly doesn't say anything about a judgment against the City of Macomb."
1993.92-833,2,29011,john_h_bisbee,,2788.448,2794.061,"And by further answer to that, I do not believe that is raised within the... it's contemplated within the question presented on certiorari."
1993.92-833,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2794.061,2795.571,So it's not for us to decide.
1993.92-833,2,29011,john_h_bisbee,,2795.571,2798.423,"I wouldn't think so, and I should have answered that quickly."
1993.92-833,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2829.734,2834.427,But you never raise it as the... as a claim of a constitutional right to travel.
1993.92-833,2,29011,john_h_bisbee,,2834.427,2839.89,"Not as a separate constitutional claim of right to travel, except as set forth in the complaint."
1993.92-833,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2883.799,2894.648,"Mr. Bisbee, you are taking the constitutional tort enunciated in Bivens and you're fitting it precisely to the common law mold."
1993.92-833,2,29011,john_h_bisbee,,2910.456,2913.157,"Your Honor, I hope that I am not understood as saying that."
1993.92-833,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2928.869,2936.532,"So the whole thing should... Bivens even should have been under... instead of the Fourth Amendment, should have been under due process because it's this encompassing concept."
1993.92-833,2,29011,john_h_bisbee,,2936.532,2948.002,"--As I understand Bivens, Your Honor, it came about simply because there was not a... an analogue to section 1983 which covers Federal... Federal deprivations of constitutional rights committed by Federal officials."
1993.92-833,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2974.09,2979.381,"But I don't... I understand what you said, that there was nothing... no statute between the Constitution and the claim."
1993.92-833,2,29011,john_h_bisbee,,2990.829,3010.752,"--Well, I don't know why the Court did what it did in Bivens in that respect, Your Honor, except to say that all elements, the Fourth, the Fifth, and the Sixth Amendments all combine to create and delineate the contours of the liberty which is protected in these situations from a prosecution."
1993.92-833,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3012.814,3014.016,"Thank You, Mr. Bisbee."
