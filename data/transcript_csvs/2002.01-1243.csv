2002.01-1243,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,0.0,9.353,"The Court will hear argument in Borden Ranch against the Corps of Engineers, No. 1243."
2002.01-1243,0,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,56.442,58.85,"Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court:"
2002.01-1243,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,123.959,135.369,"Well, did... did the district court here find that the deep ripping tracked material into wetland areas from the adjacent uplands?"
2002.01-1243,0,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,135.369,140.163,--Only as to 3 of the 30-odd wetlands that are involved.
2002.01-1243,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,140.163,142.381,And as to those three?
2002.01-1243,0,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,142.381,148.591,And that... that is not... and that was not the basis of the judgment below or of the penalty.
2002.01-1243,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,216.469,220.492,"Even so, if we agreed that that's a proper basis--"
2002.01-1243,0,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,220.492,225.195,--That would not be a basis on which you could affirm here because that was not--
2002.01-1243,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,225.195,228.429,--But we'd have to... we'd have to remand for that to be considered?
2002.01-1243,0,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,228.429,258.188,"--And we believe that a remand that focused on that issue would show, first of all, that there were on some occasions a minimal amount of material that was moved into the edge of the wetland, just on some occasions, a minimal amount that would be well below the amount of fill that would have fitted at that time with on the... under the nationwide permit so that no individual permit would be required in this case."
2002.01-1243,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,309.971,311.489,What... what is the relevance of that?
2002.01-1243,0,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,312.753,312.967,"Well, the Government is--"
2002.01-1243,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,312.967,314.505,--Let me explain how I'm thinking of this case.
2002.01-1243,0,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,323.103,323.54,--No.
2002.01-1243,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,323.54,324.046,No.
2002.01-1243,0,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,324.046,325.314,That would regulated under the rivers--
2002.01-1243,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,325.314,325.995,"Okay, it wouldn't violate the act."
2002.01-1243,0,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,334.906,336.342,--That would fall under section 404.
2002.01-1243,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,336.342,336.942,"Absolutely, okay."
2002.01-1243,0,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,343.388,343.728,We bring no--
2002.01-1243,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,343.728,345.319,--you brought in some dirt and you punched the hole.
2002.01-1243,0,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,345.731,347.987,--We bring... we bring a little dirt in at the margin.
2002.01-1243,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,347.987,354.341,"--So your argument is because you only brought a little dirt and you were mostly interested in punching the hole, you fall outside the act."
2002.01-1243,0,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,354.341,355.031,That's right.
2002.01-1243,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,355.508,355.709,That's it.
2002.01-1243,0,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,361.744,362.09,"--No, no."
2002.01-1243,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,462.195,465.136,"Mr. Bishop, will you explain something to me?"
2002.01-1243,0,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,492.633,515.635,"We don't think it's permissible, Justice Ginsburg, to protect wetlands by ignoring the plain language of the statute because Congress, through using the terms that it did, imposed limits on Federal power that preserve and protect, as 101(b) says, the power of the States to regulate nonpoint source pollution."
2002.01-1243,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,516.779,516.994,So when you say--
2002.01-1243,0,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,516.994,517.317,--so it--
2002.01-1243,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,517.317,522.789,"--you say, well, nonpoint is... that's another issue, whether this is a point source, whether the--"
2002.01-1243,0,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,522.789,524.391,--We don't believe this is a point source.
2002.01-1243,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,526.808,527.153,--But that's... that's another issue--
2002.01-1243,0,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,527.153,527.905,--or dredged material.
2002.01-1243,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,527.905,533.227,--than whether... I thought you were saying this is a redeposit of the same material.
2002.01-1243,0,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,536.482,539.296,It's... it's a redeposit of the material.
2002.01-1243,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,541.566,541.879,Yes.
2002.01-1243,0,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,541.879,543.749,--of material to the wetland.
2002.01-1243,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,543.749,545.061,Is there any redeposit that could be?
2002.01-1243,0,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,545.061,577.998,"Well, the... the... Judge Silberman in the National Mining case said that the terms addition in section 404 and also the concept that a 404 permit is for the... is for the deposit of material to a specified disposal site, that read together, those show that Congress intended that there be a geographic or temporal separation between the dredging activity or where the material comes from and where it is deposited."
2002.01-1243,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,633.051,637.752,Is there a difference between deep ripping and deep plowing?
2002.01-1243,0,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,637.752,639.199,They're the same.
2002.01-1243,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,648.58,673.233,"Well, what... what is the effect of section 1344 which says nonprohibited discharge of dredged or fill materials, that the discharge from normal farming and activities such as plowing are not considered, I guess, as a--"
2002.01-1243,0,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,673.233,687.82,"Well, Justice O'Connor, our... our take on this case is that we never get to 404(f), that this activity is not a discharge to begin with because it doesn't satisfy the requirements set out in 404(a)."
2002.01-1243,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,697.675,699.157,"--So, you think we never get there."
2002.01-1243,0,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,699.157,701.48,That's... that's our argument.
2002.01-1243,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,701.48,713.752,"But if we were to disagree with you, because of this marginal shifting of soil from the uplands to the wetland, then we'd have to look at that?"
2002.01-1243,0,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,713.752,723.381,"If... well, that would be... that would be an issue, but as I say, there's no finding as to that sort of a... that sort of an addition."
2002.01-1243,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,747.126,754.368,Why... there's something called a backhoe that has been labeled a point source and a bulldozer that has been labeled.
2002.01-1243,0,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,754.368,754.616,Right.
2002.01-1243,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,754.616,756.457,Why not a ripper?
2002.01-1243,0,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,756.457,757.8,"Well, let me explain."
2002.01-1243,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,826.957,827.143,Why?
2002.01-1243,0,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,831.263,832.445,A dump... a dump--
2002.01-1243,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,832.445,833.011,--what I do is I have my truck.
2002.01-1243,0,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,839.222,839.994,--A dump truck--
2002.01-1243,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,839.994,840.942,"Now, is the truck a point source?"
2002.01-1243,0,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,840.942,843.726,--A dump truck confines the material and it conveys it.
2002.01-1243,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,843.726,844.747,"Well, it doesn't say confined anywhere in the statute."
2002.01-1243,0,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,844.747,845.32,"Yes, it does."
2002.01-1243,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,845.32,845.457,Which word--
2002.01-1243,0,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,845.457,847.997,"It says a discernible, confined, and discrete--"
2002.01-1243,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,847.997,849.056,--Not confining.
2002.01-1243,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,850.111,852.55,"It's the conveyance that is confined, not the material."
2002.01-1243,0,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,852.55,853.589,"--Well, that's the Government's theory, but--"
2002.01-1243,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,853.589,856.097,"Well, but isn't that what the plain language says?"
2002.01-1243,0,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,856.097,856.62,"--No, no."
2002.01-1243,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,856.62,859.299,"It says confined conveyance, not confining conveyance."
2002.01-1243,0,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,859.299,860.585,"Well, I don't think that's right."
2002.01-1243,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,868.785,869.413,"Well, we're coming up with it now."
2002.01-1243,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1643.397,1645.339,"Thank you, Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court:"
2002.01-1243,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1673.2,1679.639,And the... the legislation doesn't require that these wetlands be... be left fallow.
2002.01-1243,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1689.092,1689.812,--That is correct.
2002.01-1243,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1692.989,1697.348,Could be used for normal farming and plowing presumably without a permit.
2002.01-1243,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1697.348,1700.314,--They could be under the normal farming exemption.
2002.01-1243,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1747.813,1753.89,"So is a... is a point source a defined, discrete conveyance?"
2002.01-1243,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1756.798,1761.701,"The... the statute states that a point source is a discernible, confined, discrete conveyance."
2002.01-1243,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1761.701,1766.283,And is a plow of this type such a conveyance?
2002.01-1243,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1766.283,1767.763,"Yes, it is, and let me describe."
2002.01-1243,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1767.763,1767.89,Why?
2002.01-1243,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1767.89,1768.784,Let me describe.
2002.01-1243,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1768.784,1774.022,Because that's a point of disagreement between you and your opponent here.
2002.01-1243,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1774.022,1775.97,"That is correct, Your... Your Honor."
2002.01-1243,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1818.499,1821.506,It doesn't just go in and come out.
2002.01-1243,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1822.222,1823.737,--It pulls--
2002.01-1243,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1823.737,1826.577,--in your view moves the material?
2002.01-1243,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1826.577,1828.31,"--Yes, and in fact the district court--"
2002.01-1243,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1828.31,1830.502,To the side or forward or something?
2002.01-1243,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1830.502,1830.832,--Yes.
2002.01-1243,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1836.235,1848.499,"Yes, but if... so long as the material that... that moved a couple of inches or even a couple of feet horizontally is moved from within the wetlands to within the wetlands, you haven't added anything to the wetlands, have you?"
2002.01-1243,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1848.499,1848.95,No.
2002.01-1243,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1872.977,1878.875,"Well, that's easy to see, a dredge that takes a quantity of material and physically moves it to another place."
2002.01-1243,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1888.117,1888.853,--No.
2002.01-1243,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1904.749,1905.344,He says that's not the purpose.
2002.01-1243,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1918.958,1925.468,"And it was one that was resolved, with respect, Your Honor, by the district court which made clear that the purpose here is to break up the clay pan."
2002.01-1243,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1930.676,1932.422,"Well, he doesn't deny that."
2002.01-1243,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1932.422,1933.034,Yes.
2002.01-1243,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1933.861,1940.939,But... but you're... you're describing the moving it... of it... of it at least vertically as being the whole purpose of the operation.
2002.01-1243,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1959.604,1962.348,"But, Your Honor, the purpose here is not what matters."
2002.01-1243,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1969.04,1978.924,"Well, I suppose there's an addition if I'm walking through a wetland that... you know, that... that happens to be dry at this time a year and I kick... I kick a dirt ball and it moves to another part of the wetland."
2002.01-1243,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1981.479,1984.895,The regulations make clear... EPA has made clear that those types of--
2002.01-1243,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1984.895,1985.653,Lucky for me my foot is not a conveyance.
2002.01-1243,2,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,3383.262,3392.175,I think it's a shame that the Government has chosen to insert at this level for the very first time this idea that soil came in from outside the wetland.
2002.01-1243,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3489.617,3490.928,What does primary mean?
2002.01-1243,2,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,3490.928,3494.26,Primary I think means just preparation.
2002.01-1243,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3521.953,3523.529,Why do you need the exception for it?
2002.01-1243,2,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,3524.604,3527.639,"Well, you don't need an exception for it."
2002.01-1243,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3627.663,3628.806,"Thank you, Mr. Bishop."
2002.01-1243,2,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,3628.806,3629.158,Thank you.
2002.01-1243,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3629.158,3630.141,The case is submitted.
