1991.90-954,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,21.246,"We'll hear argument next in number 90-954, Robert C. Rufo v. The Inmates of the Suffolk County Jail, and 90-1004, Thomas C. Rapone v. The Inmates of the Suffolk County Jail."
1991.90-954,0,19301,chester_a_janiak,,50.183,55.051,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1991.90-954,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,183.536,186.654,Does the record tell us how many of these transfers there are?
1991.90-954,0,19301,chester_a_janiak,,186.654,189.256,I think we could compute.
1991.90-954,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,202.731,203.766,Thousands?
1991.90-954,0,19301,chester_a_janiak,,203.766,204.983,"Yes, there would be... there would be--"
1991.90-954,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,204.983,209.92,And would the change in the consent decree that you're asking for totally eliminate these transfers?
1991.90-954,0,19301,chester_a_janiak,,209.92,212.872,--They most probably would totally eliminate it.
1991.90-954,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,438.818,451.728,How did the... how did a cell in the new facility compare with the old facility?
1991.90-954,0,19301,chester_a_janiak,,451.728,453.995,The old facility--
1991.90-954,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,453.995,456.097,If it was going to have two people in it?
1991.90-954,0,19301,chester_a_janiak,,456.097,463.453,--The smallest-sized cell in the new facility is... the minimum-sized cell in the new facility is 70 square feet.
1991.90-954,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,471.206,477.276,What about the... and you suggested in the smallest of these cells that some might be double-bunked?
1991.90-954,0,19301,chester_a_janiak,,477.276,483.264,"In some instances, in the small, minimum-sized cells of 70 square feet, there would be double-bunking."
1991.90-954,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,483.264,486.382,"Double-bunked, which would be less commodious than the old... the old--"
1991.90-954,0,19301,chester_a_janiak,,486.382,489.084,The cells in the new facility--
1991.90-954,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,489.084,489.884,--facility.
1991.90-954,0,19301,chester_a_janiak,,489.884,494.305,"--The cells in the new facility would be, in some instances, would be smaller than the cells in the old facility."
1991.90-954,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,522.139,532.347,"Yes, but I suppose... your... the decree... the court refused to set aside the decree based on the standard that you attack."
1991.90-954,0,19301,chester_a_janiak,,532.347,533.563,--Correct.
1991.90-954,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,533.563,535.399,"Now, let's assume we agreed with you."
1991.90-954,0,19301,chester_a_janiak,,550.159,556.045,"That's... the judge below said he did not have to reach any issue, and there are no findings."
1991.90-954,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,556.045,563.299,"What if we agreed with you, wouldn't we just remand to have the Eighth Amendment issue fleshed out in the court below?"
1991.90-954,0,19301,chester_a_janiak,,563.299,575.607,"I think the... perhaps the most appropriate result, then, would be to remand to apply a new standard to make the determination of whether double-bunking this particular facility--"
1991.90-954,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,575.607,576.059,Yes.
1991.90-954,0,19301,chester_a_janiak,,576.059,577.892,--would meet constitutional standards.
1991.90-954,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,577.892,587.248,"Mr. Janiak, do you plan to discuss with us the standard employed below and the standard that you employed below?"
1991.90-954,0,19301,chester_a_janiak,,587.248,588.684,"Yes, Justice O'Connor."
1991.90-954,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,615.017,624.357,Does rule 60(b)(5) have anything to do with the authority of the court to consider a modification?
1991.90-954,0,19301,chester_a_janiak,,624.357,629.944,"I think the issue would be, given the language of that rule, what--"
1991.90-954,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,629.944,630.911,Does the rule apply?
1991.90-954,0,19301,chester_a_janiak,,630.911,631.878,--Yes.
1991.90-954,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,631.878,635.997,"So the question is whether it's equitable, basically."
1991.90-954,0,19301,chester_a_janiak,,635.997,639.116,I think the question is what does equitable mean in this particular kind of case.
1991.90-954,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,639.116,640.032,Okay.
1991.90-954,0,19301,chester_a_janiak,,640.032,654.606,"And the district court judge first looked to the Swift case in answering that, which I submit is not the proper standard, given this Court's decision in the Dowell case, particularly, and then went on to apply what he said was, quote, ""a flexible standard""."
1991.90-954,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,665.897,675.269,Does a consent decree have any contractual aspects to it that are the source of special concern?
1991.90-954,0,19301,chester_a_janiak,,675.269,681.442,"I think that a consent decree has a contractual aspect to it, but it should not be considered a contract."
1991.90-954,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,726.304,726.971,Is that--
1991.90-954,0,19301,chester_a_janiak,,740.046,752.871,"I think, given this Court's holding in the Local 93 case, that is probably correct, that they would have... if the parties agree to it, and it goes beyond what the court could have ordered after trial, it may be entered as a consent decree."
1991.90-954,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,767.881,773.619,Would it be an abuse of the discretion for the district court to say I'll do no more than the constitutional minimum?
1991.90-954,0,19301,chester_a_janiak,,773.619,784.759,"I think that... in fact, what the court would be required to do is to look to the underlying Federal law which occasion the court's original intervention--"
1991.90-954,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,784.759,786.292,I mean at the outset of the decree.
1991.90-954,0,19301,chester_a_janiak,,794.115,796.484,--I believe that the court would have that discretion.
1991.90-954,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,797.667,798.834,"Well, it may be--"
1991.90-954,0,19301,chester_a_janiak,,812.391,818.645,"--Well, I think that's a tough question, given this Court's... and which... I'm sure that's why it was asked, Justice White."
1991.90-954,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,829.186,832.721,Was that a constitutional case?
1991.90-954,0,19301,chester_a_janiak,,832.721,834.506,That was not a constitutional case.
1991.90-954,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,841.56,860.305,"I suppose a district court can... if he thinks he's... there's really a constitutional violation involved, can spell out what he thinks might be an appropriate remedy, and especially if it's consented to, he could enter the order."
1991.90-954,0,19301,chester_a_janiak,,871.28,871.93,--That's correct.
1991.90-954,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,890.241,893.462,"Mr. Janiak, can I ask you a question about your standard on the changed circumstances?"
1991.90-954,0,19301,chester_a_janiak,,899.08,903.068,"I think my... in my view, they don't have to be foreseeable."
1991.90-954,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,903.068,911.257,"It would be all right if everybody could predict the increase in prison population, and then they still... you could still rely on that increase to do it."
1991.90-954,0,19301,chester_a_janiak,,917.743,928.885,"Well, what the district court judge did here, Justice Stevens, he looked... he discussed the issue of foreseeability only in the context of applying the Swift standard."
1991.90-954,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,973.164,975.964,But it seems to me your standard has the same problem in it.
1991.90-954,0,19301,chester_a_janiak,,992.709,1000.732,"That is... that any time, if there was a change in circumstance, which led to a further increase--"
1991.90-954,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1000.732,1002.065,Whether foreseen or unforeseen.
1991.90-954,0,19301,chester_a_janiak,,1002.065,1008.985,"--Foreseen or unforeseen, then you would have to make a showing that that was a change in circumstance, and had an adverse affect."
1991.90-954,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1015.991,1018.943,"Thank you, Mr. Janiak."
1991.90-954,1,31738,john_t_montgomery,,1021.061,1030.667,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1991.90-954,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1110.786,1119.659,"If they wanted to have a question about the... present a question about the new jail, they should start a new lawsuit."
1991.90-954,1,31738,john_t_montgomery,,1119.659,1121.344,"That's exactly right, Your Honor."
1991.90-954,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1121.344,1137.536,"You're saying that once the consent decree has been complied with for any period of time, that ends the power of the court to enforce that decree except insofar as a change may fall below constitutional standards."
1991.90-954,1,31738,john_t_montgomery,,1138.42,1158.934,"Your Honor, what we're saying is that once the underlying constitutional violations have been cured, and are unlikely to recur, at that point... which we concede is difficult to define in many cases... the power of the court ends, no matter what the consent decree says."
1991.90-954,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1158.934,1163.771,"Then under those... under your rule, there doesn't have to be any changed circumstance."
1991.90-954,1,31738,john_t_montgomery,,1186.786,1191.655,"Your Honor, we really make here... in this case... two arguments."
1991.90-954,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1211.001,1221.274,"But you're saying to the extent that there is an attempt to enforce a consent decree which goes beyond constitutional minima, equitable considerations really are irrelevant?"
1991.90-954,1,31738,john_t_montgomery,,1221.274,1223.642,"We do not go that far, Your Honor."
1991.90-954,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1274.325,1279.713,"Well, you could be more specific... and you were... that the decree had to do with the old jail."
1991.90-954,1,31738,john_t_montgomery,,1279.713,1281.498,"That's exactly right, Your Honor."
1991.90-954,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1281.498,1282.498,And the old jail's closed.
1991.90-954,1,31738,john_t_montgomery,,1282.498,1283.148,That's right.
1991.90-954,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1283.148,1287.152,So the decree is just over.
1991.90-954,1,31738,john_t_montgomery,,1292.037,1292.805,That's right.
1991.90-954,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1297.94,1298.376,Yes.
1991.90-954,1,31738,john_t_montgomery,,1298.376,1304.78,"Indeed, the consent decree, and its hundreds of pages of attachments, were the architectural plan for the new jail."
1991.90-954,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1314.569,1326.277,"Well, it isn't... it isn't if the consent decree, or the court, thought that there was a per se rule against double-bunking in any prison."
1991.90-954,1,31738,john_t_montgomery,,1326.277,1328.479,--That's true.
1991.90-954,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1330.396,1339.703,"And if there was a... if that element was in the decree, why, there's been a changed condition, namely that the law has been changed."
1991.90-954,1,31738,john_t_montgomery,,1342.403,1344.238,"--We agree with that, Your Honor."
1991.90-954,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1355.729,1358.415,"Mr. Montgomery, I don't really understand what you're saying."
1991.90-954,1,31738,john_t_montgomery,,1384.565,1394.254,"Your Honor, the question is the context on which the assessment is made of whether there isn't... some violation of the law that occurs."
1991.90-954,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1462.148,1477.508,"Well, what if, in the showing in the... for the original decree, Mr. Montgomery, it was shown that this sheriff had been sheriff of three or four different jails, and in every one of them he double-celled."
1991.90-954,1,31738,john_t_montgomery,,1491.502,1514.033,"If the court had believed, in 1973 when it entered its original decision after trial that single-celling was, per se, a violation of the Constitution, and such a sheriff were a party to the case, then I would agree with Your Honor's suggestion that it would be difficult to show that there was not a likelihood of recurrence."
1991.90-954,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1539.583,1547.588,"Your answer to Chief Justice assumes that courts can take account of character evidence, even though juries may not be able to."
1991.90-954,1,31738,john_t_montgomery,,1550.606,1552.073,"I suppose that's true, Your Honor."
1991.90-954,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1562.848,1569.352,"Under your view, what are the key differences between a consent decree and a judgment after litigation?"
1991.90-954,1,31738,john_t_montgomery,,1569.352,1580.976,"For purposes of the argument that we make concerning the limits of the court's authority, there is no difference at all, in our view."
1991.90-954,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1583.095,1589.765,Do consent decrees serve an important function in our litigation and adversary system?
1991.90-954,1,31738,john_t_montgomery,,1589.765,1591.7,--They serve a very important function.
1991.90-954,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1612.131,1620.018,"Well, does the court have any greater authority to enter relief pursuant to a consent decree than pursuant to a litigated judgment?"
1991.90-954,1,31738,john_t_montgomery,,1620.018,1631.342,"--Under Local 93, there certainly is an argument to be made that there is some greater authority under a consent decree to enter relief."
1991.90-954,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1676.473,1687.429,"Mr. Montgomery, on your theory that the power of the court terminated when the new facility was built, what case in this Court most strongly supports your suggestion?"
1991.90-954,1,31738,john_t_montgomery,,1689.631,1692.333,"No, I believe Dowell most strongly supports our position."
1991.90-954,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1692.333,1693.149,Dowell was your authority.
1991.90-954,1,31738,john_t_montgomery,,1693.149,1699.839,"As I said in response to Justice Kennedy's question, we see no difference between consent decrees and litigated decrees."
1991.90-954,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1817.546,1819.748,"Thank you, Mr. Montgomery."
1991.90-954,1,31738,john_t_montgomery,,1819.748,1820.415,I thank the Court.
1991.90-954,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1820.415,1822.8,"Mr. Stern, we'll hear now from you."
1991.90-954,2,36762,max_d_stern,,1822.8,1830.806,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1991.90-954,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1994.829,2005.969,"Mr. Stern, do you agree with the application of the so-called Swift standard by the lower court in looking at this question?"
1991.90-954,2,36762,max_d_stern,,2005.969,2010.771,"We... yes, we have no problem with the Swift standard."
1991.90-954,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2011.754,2013.77,"Well, I might have a problem with it because--"
1991.90-954,2,36762,max_d_stern,,2013.77,2014.287,"--Yes, I understand that."
1991.90-954,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2014.956,2020.424,--I'm not sure that is the standard that ought to be applied in cases like this.
1991.90-954,2,36762,max_d_stern,,2020.424,2021.776,"--Well, perhaps not."
1991.90-954,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2067.705,2071.793,Would it be fair to say that he applied the second standard somewhat perfunctorily?
1991.90-954,2,36762,max_d_stern,,2074.16,2077.779,"--Well, I think it was a little more than one sentence, Your Honor."
1991.90-954,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2135.283,2147.341,Do you agree that a consent decree cannot go beyond what the court has power to... order without the consent decree?
1991.90-954,2,36762,max_d_stern,,2147.341,2149.293,"No, I do not agree with that."
1991.90-954,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2149.776,2152.495,It can go beyond remedying the constitutional violations.
1991.90-954,2,36762,max_d_stern,,2152.495,2156.664,--I believe that is what Local 93 established.
1991.90-954,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2177.745,2184.899,"What is the authority of a court to do that, to order something that is not necessary to prevent a violation of law?"
1991.90-954,2,36762,max_d_stern,,2184.899,2187.518,"Well, it's the basis--"
1991.90-954,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2187.518,2188.801,Just the agreement of the parties?
1991.90-954,2,36762,max_d_stern,,2188.801,2193.172,"--I would say so, as long as it is within the subject matter jurisdiction of the court."
1991.90-954,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2193.172,2198.558,So the court converts a private contract into a rule of law?
1991.90-954,2,36762,max_d_stern,,2198.558,2211.116,"I suppose you could put it that way, but that is what a consent decree is all about... although it is not completely a private contract because, since it is also an order, it isn't immutable."
1991.90-954,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2223.841,2240.635,"The judge says to the parties when they come into this consent decree, the judge says to the plaintiff, look, I would never enter an order like this if we litigated this case and you won, I would not enter this order."
1991.90-954,2,36762,max_d_stern,,2248.324,2250.324,"Well, I suppose."
1991.90-954,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2294.37,2306.511,You say that the double-celling provisions should be enforced even though double-celling per se is not necessarily unconstitutional?
1991.90-954,2,36762,max_d_stern,,2306.511,2310.232,--We say it is... not necessarily.
1991.90-954,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2315.017,2322.706,"But nevertheless, the consent decree should be enforced without even considering whether or not the conditions in the new jail are unconstitutional?"
1991.90-954,2,36762,max_d_stern,,2322.706,2324.472,"Your Honor, please, this was--"
1991.90-954,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2324.472,2325.591,"That is right, is it not?"
1991.90-954,2,36762,max_d_stern,,2325.591,2326.741,"--Yes, it is."
1991.90-954,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2329.542,2330.209,That was the deal.
1991.90-954,2,36762,max_d_stern,,2330.209,2331.242,--that was the deal.
1991.90-954,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2338.615,2339.898,But you did not know who was going to win.
1991.90-954,2,36762,max_d_stern,,2339.898,2340.684,--Of course.
1991.90-954,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2371.286,2372.419,"Well, sue them for breach of contract."
1991.90-954,2,36762,max_d_stern,,2391.949,2406.209,"This is, if I might say so, this is an even stronger case than Local 93 because at least here, unlike Local 93, this was a very disputable issue."
1991.90-954,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2418.017,2426.29,"But I think one can say, if you are talking about a judgment for damages in the settlement, no difficulty arises."
1991.90-954,2,36762,max_d_stern,,2437.311,2448.803,That is exactly why rule 60(b)(5) provides the leeway for defendants to get out of it in a substantial change of circumstances.
1991.90-954,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2477.972,2505.29,"What if in this case the precise same... rather, a different consent decree had been entered saying that generally speaking double-celling is okay, and Bell v. Wolfish and Rhodes v. Chapman had come out differently in this Court so that there is now a per se rule against double, could the State insist that it can continue to run the jail under that decree?"
1991.90-954,2,36762,max_d_stern,,2505.29,2507.242,--I am not sure I understand.
1991.90-954,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2509.742,2516.431,Supposing that the consent decree had said no problem with double... double-celling as a general rule.
1991.90-954,2,36762,max_d_stern,,2523.418,2524.302,I see.
1991.90-954,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2524.302,2525.887,Per se rule against doubling.
1991.90-954,2,36762,max_d_stern,,2531.94,2535.392,"Well, I think you then might have the System Federation case."
1991.90-954,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2535.392,2536.325,"Well, that's a deal."
1991.90-954,2,36762,max_d_stern,,2537.575,2554.103,"Well, the System Federation case held that when the result that was part of the consent decree, it turns out to be affirmatively contrary to Federal law, when the result... in System Federation the consent decree said union shops are illegal."
1991.90-954,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2555.805,2564.142,"Well, part of Federal law is that you don't bind... you do not tell a State how to run its business unless they're trying to run it contrary to the constitution."
1991.90-954,2,36762,max_d_stern,,2564.142,2567.529,"Well, that is certainly the basis for jurisdiction."
1991.90-954,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2570.565,2582.206,"Mr. Stern, isn't your answer to the Chief Justice that the particular plaintiffs in the case will be bound, but that would not bind the next group of inmates who came in because they certainly would not be bound by a consent decree to which they are not a party?"
1991.90-954,2,36762,max_d_stern,,2582.206,2591.329,I do think that there is parity and that both sides are bound in this class action.
1991.90-954,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2592.462,2604.369,The plead of the plaintiffs in that case would be bound to not to take the benefit of the... our hypothetical ruling that single... double-celling is prohibited.
1991.90-954,2,36762,max_d_stern,,2606.738,2618.812,"--I think the question is whether the, whether System Federation would apply, whether there is a difference because this Court has now held that something is illegal."
1991.90-954,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2620.498,2624.366,"No, but is not the difference that they could waive the illegality?"
1991.90-954,2,36762,max_d_stern,,2645.463,2650.765,We certainly have not argued and don't argue that anything could be done to enlarge the jurisdiction of the court.
1991.90-954,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2670.428,2673.446,"You know what we mean by enlarging the jurisdiction of the court, Mr. Stern."
1991.90-954,2,36762,max_d_stern,,2687.937,2689.389,I do think that a court.
1991.90-954,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2689.389,2691.158,And your answer is?
1991.90-954,2,36762,max_d_stern,,2691.158,2692.091,Does have such power.
1991.90-954,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2692.091,2692.758,It has not.
1991.90-954,2,36762,max_d_stern,,2692.758,2702.763,"But at least it has such power when it is a disputable issue at the time the court approaches it, when it is something that is negotiable, something that could go either way."
1991.90-954,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2706.083,2711.219,"Mr. Stern, was there any constitutional violation proved in this case other than the double-celling?"
1991.90-954,2,36762,max_d_stern,,2711.219,2712.737,"Oh, yes, Your Honor."
1991.90-954,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2713.337,2717.955,So the court had the power to fashich a remedy for a constitutional violation that was proved.
1991.90-954,2,36762,max_d_stern,,2721.823,2730.013,--No one questioned the jurisdiction at the beginning or the middle or the end or anytime during this 20-year episode.
1991.90-954,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2753.978,2759.365,"The mechanism for that solution as a practical matter really had to be a consent decree, didn't it?"
1991.90-954,2,36762,max_d_stern,,2774.542,2775.475,I agree with Your Honor.
1991.90-954,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2776.558,2778.326,I could not think of it either.
1991.90-954,2,36762,max_d_stern,,2804.144,2805.811,Perhaps so.
1991.90-954,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2834.128,2837.18,"Mr. Stern, how much do you need to assure that?"
1991.90-954,2,36762,max_d_stern,,2853.856,2854.824,That's all I need in this case.
1991.90-954,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2854.824,2855.724,That's all you need in this case.
1991.90-954,2,36762,max_d_stern,,2895.968,2905.057,"No, it wouldn't, because once the consent decree is negotiated and entered... first of all, in the process of negotiation, there are mutual trade-offs."
1991.90-954,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2918.598,2920.733,"On close questions of law, as you are saying."
1991.90-954,2,36762,max_d_stern,,2934.176,2937.878,"--Some points are close questions of the law, but other points are not."
1991.90-954,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2966.297,2984.859,"And if it were still a close question and if we put the burden on the side trying to break the consent decree to show that double occupancy is not a violation of the constitution, that would normally be hard to show if it was still a close question."
1991.90-954,2,36762,max_d_stern,,2990.329,2997.083,"It would still mean... and, of course, that is, the burden is always on the movement."
1991.90-954,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3195.362,3197.481,Was there any length or term of years on this consent decree?
1991.90-954,2,36762,max_d_stern,,3197.481,3198.631,"No, there isn't."
1991.90-954,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3198.631,3202.183,Rule against perpetuity or something?
1991.90-954,2,36762,max_d_stern,,3202.183,3213.991,"Well, until there is a change of circumstance, if there is one, but at least... at least beyond the day the jail is supposed to open its doors."
1991.90-954,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3232.72,3239.808,"Of course, all the Government has to do is build another jail to keep up with the prisoner population."
1991.90-954,2,36762,max_d_stern,,3239.808,3242.16,That is certainly true over the long term.
1991.90-954,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3242.16,3245.962,Which is what happened because of the case that was brought.
1991.90-954,2,36762,max_d_stern,,3245.962,3247.58,"That's right, Your Honor."
1991.90-954,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3433.701,3435.82,"Was that constitutionally required, too?"
1991.90-954,2,36762,max_d_stern,,3448.545,3452.097,"--Justice Scalia, perhaps not a constitutional requirement."
1991.90-954,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3567.302,3569.171,"Thank you, Mr. Stern."
