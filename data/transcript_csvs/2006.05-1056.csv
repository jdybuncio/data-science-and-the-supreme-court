2006.05-1056,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,0.0,7.17,"We'll hear argument now in No. 05-1056, Microsoft against AT&T."
2006.05-1056,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,9.689,10.872,"Thank you, Justice Stevens."
2006.05-1056,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,38.089,43.677,"Mr. Olson, before you get into the merits I have a question, a preliminary question."
2006.05-1056,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,73.279,75.131,"No, I don't believe so, Justice Scalia."
2006.05-1056,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,75.131,90.158,"Well, suppose two parties just, you know, parties that otherwise do not have a case or controversy, bet each other that the district court will come out one way or the other way in, in a trumped-up suit."
2006.05-1056,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,93.593,96.212,This is by no means a trumped-up suit.
2006.05-1056,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,109.637,113.256,"--Well, you could say the same thing in the hypothetical I gave."
2006.05-1056,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,116.391,126.414,"This is an entirely legitimate, I submit, means by which parties may preserve a legal issue depending upon how a legal question is decided."
2006.05-1056,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,134.353,137.722,"Do you know of any, any precedent for that?"
2006.05-1056,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,137.722,147.327,"It seems to me, Justice Scalia, that it happens frequently, especially in criminal cases where there is... someone pleads guilty in and preserving a right to appeal a certain issue."
2006.05-1056,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,168.26,172.212,Suppose the amount were trivial and you just wanted to get a resolution of this--
2006.05-1056,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,173.845,174.164,"--Well, I think that if the amount--"
2006.05-1056,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,174.164,175.997,Then there would be a case--
2006.05-1056,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,178.532,188.304,"--I don't know what the Court might mean by the word trivial, Justice Kennedy, but this is a very significant major amount involved in this case."
2006.05-1056,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,194.958,199.91,"That's so, but is there a lot of money involved depending on whether you win or lose?"
2006.05-1056,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,199.91,200.662,Yes.
2006.05-1056,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,200.662,202.895,Okay.
2006.05-1056,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,202.895,218.839,"In this case, notwithstanding the limitation of in Section 271(f) that the components, there's... liability of the components are created here, and reassemble the broad."
2006.05-1056,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,279.545,290.436,"Mr. Olson, isn't one of the questions whether the software is really being copied when it's transferred from the golden disk to the new manufacturer, or whether it's actually being supplied?"
2006.05-1056,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,290.436,291.704,It is being copied.
2006.05-1056,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,349.908,352.843,Is the master disk a component?
2006.05-1056,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,352.843,356.814,"The master... well, AT&T has taken two positions on that."
2006.05-1056,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,357.28,357.83,What's your position?
2006.05-1056,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,357.83,364.651,--Our position is that it's not a component of the final product computers that are made abroad.
2006.05-1056,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,374.006,377.643,Just the disk but not the information on the disk is the component.
2006.05-1056,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,377.643,386.749,--The information on the disk is of no use to the computer unless it's made into a physical machine readable document... object.
2006.05-1056,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,386.749,410.799,"That... Mr. Olson, that is the position of AT&T as I understand it, that what you call the object code appears in the... in the computer that it's... that is what is sent, along with the master disk, and the object code is the critical component, according to AT&T."
2006.05-1056,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,424.958,430.612,"If I understand your question, Justice Ginsburg, let me answer it this way."
2006.05-1056,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,456.827,458.845,But I still would like to know your position.
2006.05-1056,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,460.964,461.981,It is not a component--
2006.05-1056,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,461.981,465.333,But copies of the golden disk are or are not components?
2006.05-1056,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,465.333,468.737,"--The copies, the physical manifestation on a hard drive--"
2006.05-1056,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,468.737,469.353,Physical manifestation?
2006.05-1056,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,469.353,473.322,--Our components of the foreign manufactured computers.
2006.05-1056,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,475.807,481.509,"I suppose if you could, if you made 99 copies, those would be 99 components."
2006.05-1056,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,493.4,502.506,"--If... well, I think, if I understand your question, if you make... and it depends upon where you make it, where you transfer--"
2006.05-1056,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,502.506,503.673,You make them abroad.
2006.05-1056,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,503.673,508.676,"--If you make it abroad, that... and it's... that is where the component is supplied from."
2006.05-1056,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,511.711,518.048,"But if the disk, if the golden disk itself after they finish the copies, were used--"
2006.05-1056,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,518.048,518.532,--If the physical--
2006.05-1056,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,518.532,521.067,"--in a hardware, then that would be a component."
2006.05-1056,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,521.067,525.619,--If that physical golden disk were actually put into a computer and used without more.
2006.05-1056,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,525.619,533.641,"Well, I'm a little confused, because I thought the golden disk was just one method of getting the software into the new computers."
2006.05-1056,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,539.862,542.664,"Well, that's why I said AT&T has taken two positions."
2006.05-1056,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,556.49,562.125,But do you... what is your view on whether or not software is a component?
2006.05-1056,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,562.125,568.298,"--The... if I may answer that by saying that people use the word ""software"" in two different ways."
2006.05-1056,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,585.555,588.274,Or at least the correct way to understand component.
2006.05-1056,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,588.274,589.692,It is the correct way to understand the--
2006.05-1056,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,589.692,598.647,And the component then would be either a disk which is put into a computer or the portion of the hard drive to which the code is transferred.
2006.05-1056,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,598.647,599.197,--Yes.
2006.05-1056,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,638.622,644.676,So are you saying that neither the source code nor the compilation are a component?
2006.05-1056,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,644.676,645.928,Of the foreign?
2006.05-1056,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,663.99,674.798,"So that neither the source code nor the compilation are a component, save as, the compilation is put on a disk?"
2006.05-1056,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,674.798,675.865,That's correct.
2006.05-1056,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,678.999,679.733,That seems odd.
2006.05-1056,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,684.337,687.205,--Justice Kennedy--
2006.05-1056,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,687.205,688.889,It says buy our program because the program means something.
2006.05-1056,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,688.889,694.526,--But the program is nothing until made into a physical manifestation that can be made by the computer.
2006.05-1056,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,694.526,695.378,What is patented?
2006.05-1056,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,700.33,702.282,The AT&T patent--
2006.05-1056,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,702.282,702.699,Right.
2006.05-1056,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,702.699,710.721,"--The '580 patent is a program, as I understand it, that's married to a computer, has to be married to a computer in order to be patented."
2006.05-1056,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,710.721,716.792,"You can't patent, you know, on-off, on-off code in the abstract, can you?"
2006.05-1056,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,716.792,718.125,"That's correct, Justice Scalia."
2006.05-1056,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,718.125,719.193,There needs to be a device.
2006.05-1056,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,719.193,723.778,"An idea or a principle, two plus two equals four can't be patented."
2006.05-1056,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,742.442,745.026,That depends on what you consider the component.
2006.05-1056,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,753.665,757.701,"They have attempted, Justice Ginsburg, with respect, to have it both ways."
2006.05-1056,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,775.347,777.047,What did the Federal Circuit say?
2006.05-1056,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,793.709,794.059,Yes.
2006.05-1056,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,850.711,857.401,"Suppose you had a patent on a biological organism and it was contained in a little vial, and you shipped it abroad."
2006.05-1056,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,862.953,868.173,"If it reproduces itself, Justice Kennedy, somewhere outside the United States--"
2006.05-1056,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,868.173,868.607,Right.
2006.05-1056,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,868.607,875.363,--What you're suggesting is that there is a pattern or a recipe or a template or a mold.
2006.05-1056,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,888.02,904.28,"Isn't this an artificial distinction in... when you're talking about the making of a tangible part, there's at least some cost involved in doing it here or doing it abroad, and some time involved."
2006.05-1056,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,925.978,927.995,I think there are three answers to that.
2006.05-1056,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,973.442,982.898,Mr. Joseffer.
2006.05-1056,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,982.898,985.084,"Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court:"
2006.05-1056,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1064.131,1079.124,"Mr. Joseffer, to the, to the extent that you are claiming that there are foreign nations that would have an interest in this, usually when that is so, hear from them and in this case there is a strange silence in that regard."
2006.05-1056,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,1079.124,1081.89,--I think that... I can say... a couple points I can make.
2006.05-1056,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1158.39,1162.611,Let me ask you about a domestic law question.
2006.05-1056,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,1187.909,1191.297,Not ordinarily.
2006.05-1056,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1194.665,1195.315,Copyright.
2006.05-1056,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,1196.248,1198.6,You can certainly copyright something like that.
2006.05-1056,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1198.6,1199.617,"Yeah, but patent--"
2006.05-1056,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,1199.617,1207.123,"Well the... no, but the... I think the most important point here is that the components of patented inventions do not have to be patentable."
2006.05-1056,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1213.193,1216.561,"Well, there can be a process patent."
2006.05-1056,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,1216.561,1226.1,"Yes, and we don't... I mean, process patents, a process patent is a series of steps or acts for performing a certain function, such as turning rubber into a tire."
2006.05-1056,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1229.602,1232.687,"What, what is your view of what the component is in this case."
2006.05-1056,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,1232.687,1238.158,"--The component is the, is the actual machine readable copy of software that is inserted in--"
2006.05-1056,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1238.158,1240.091,The software is the component?
2006.05-1056,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,1240.091,1248.095,"--Well, but the, the... but like with anything, you could say a computer is also the component, but it's the actual computer, not you know, any copy of the same computer."
2006.05-1056,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1248.095,1259.053,"But in this case, you're... but Mr. Olson said the component is either the disk or the portion of the hard drive to which the, the coded instructions are transferred."
2006.05-1056,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,1259.053,1259.436,Right.
2006.05-1056,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1259.436,1260.92,Do you accept that?
2006.05-1056,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,1260.92,1270.96,"The United States view... I'm not sure exactly how much we disagree on this... but the United States view is that, for example, a blank disk is not a component of this invention because you don't need a blank disk to practice this invention."
2006.05-1056,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1279.316,1283.084,"In other words, the disk plus the... plus the coded instructions."
2006.05-1056,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,1283.084,1283.401,--Yes.
2006.05-1056,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1288.522,1289.955,It could be on the hard drive.
2006.05-1056,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,1289.955,1293.892,"--And once it's copied on to the hard drive, then the copy on the hard drive is itself a component."
2006.05-1056,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1293.892,1301.313,I take it that we are operating under the assumption that software is patentable?
2006.05-1056,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,1303.997,1305.033,"No, but as I was saying before--"
2006.05-1056,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1305.033,1306.666,So what should we do here?
2006.05-1056,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,1311.52,1312.337,--I think if--
2006.05-1056,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1312.337,1316.841,"--If I were writing something, should I say on the assumption that it's patentable?"
2006.05-1056,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,1318.424,1318.957,--No.
2006.05-1056,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1328.999,1331.601,Can have you have a copyright on a program?
2006.05-1056,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,1331.601,1333.851,"Ah, if you wrote it out, yes."
2006.05-1056,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1343.457,1352.979,"Can I ask you, the point I don't understand when you say the... the component is the disk that contains material, I understand that because here is a separate piece; it's a disk."
2006.05-1056,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,1372.976,1373.376,--Well--
2006.05-1056,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1373.376,1374.809,"How can you call, you know, what?"
2006.05-1056,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,1378.994,1386.45,"--Well, you could go later in and delete that software off the hard drive which confirms that the software does have a separate physical existence in there."
2006.05-1056,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1405.762,1414.267,"If these... if these computers are built abroad and are sold with Windows installed, the component is the electrons on the hard drive?"
2006.05-1056,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,1415.984,1420.421,--It's the physical embodiment of the software which in some instances is manifested by... by those electrons.
2006.05-1056,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1462.331,1468.485,"Is that analogous to the source and the compilation, the source being the design, the compilation being the key?"
2006.05-1056,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,1468.485,1468.952,No.
2006.05-1056,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1515.464,1518.333,--Windows wasn't around when this statute was passed.
2006.05-1056,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,1518.333,1521.101,"Well, the statute was enacted in 1984 when software was certainly present."
2006.05-1056,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1554.923,1579.74,"I thought it was the position of the Federal Circuit that Deepsouth has to be brought into an electronic era, and so the... the Federal Circuit was taking a statute that had a shrimp deveiner in mind and saying well, this is how that notion should apply to an electronic world."
2006.05-1056,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,1579.74,1579.823,Right.
2006.05-1056,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1602.42,1606.723,"Your time is up, but I want to ask you one yes or no question."

2006.05-1056,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1612.627,1614.961,Thank you.
2006.05-1056,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1622.233,1625.202,"Mr. Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court."
2006.05-1056,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1691.913,1694.096,Suppose I send someone to the Patent Office--
2006.05-1056,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1694.096,1694.629,--Excuse me?
2006.05-1056,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1694.629,1705.487,"--Suppose I send someone to the Patent Office, goes there, picks up the patent, and this patent is written very, very, very concretely and specifically."
2006.05-1056,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1727.567,1728.267,That's not the--
2006.05-1056,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1728.267,1730.019,Is that... how is that different from this?
2006.05-1056,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1731.235,1759.719,"--That is very different than this case because what... first of all, we all agree that software code in and of itself, removed from a physical structure, cannot be patentable and when software... when some... when an invention that is practiced with software is patented, at the most what you will see is preferred embodiments of the source code which is language that humans understand and which computers do not."
2006.05-1056,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1782.251,1782.701,"No, no."
2006.05-1056,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1815.136,1815.905,Well--
2006.05-1056,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1815.905,1822.242,"Now, does it matter, if instead of sending the individual, we send the machine to Germany."
2006.05-1056,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1828.913,1863.552,"--When you're talking... when you're talking about sending designs over or blueprints or management instructions or a high level version of, gee let's have a code that will perform the following functions, and you have people design and make and compile and test and debug that code overseas, of course that component, the component is the object code, the precise commands that reside in the computer and continually interact with the hardware of the computer in a way I'm going to describe and is not disputed, millions of times a second."
2006.05-1056,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1894.071,1895.857,And that is what is on master disk.
2006.05-1056,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1895.857,1907.748,"And that is what is either on the master disk or, although either side obscures this, that is what is represented in the electric... electronic transmission, that is another means by which the code is supplied."
2006.05-1056,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1966.018,1968.737,Is that really what happens?
2006.05-1056,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1981.463,1992.502,"Well, I think that paragraph 7 of the stipulation, it doesn't specify one way or the other, but their case, Justice Stevens, depends upon the following."
2006.05-1056,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1993.271,2002.293,"If you're correct that they're just sending from New York direct to the 500 different machines all on one transmission from New York, there's no lawsuit here."
2006.05-1056,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2002.293,2003.86,--Let me give you two examples--
2006.05-1056,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2003.86,2011.482,"Is that what you're trying to tell us, that they do send it directly from New York to 500 different recipients in Germany?"
2006.05-1056,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2011.482,2011.865,"--No, no, no."
2006.05-1056,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2035.514,2041.585,"Would it be a violation if they sent, if they sent the golden disk abroad and nobody ever copied anything off the golden disk?"
2006.05-1056,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2041.585,2046.406,If they sent the golden disk abroad or if the Microsoft engineer--
2006.05-1056,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2046.406,2047.089,Would you answer my question?
2006.05-1056,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2047.089,2048.206,--I think I am.
2006.05-1056,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2048.922,2053.225,"If they send the golden disk abroad and never use it, would that be a violation?"
2006.05-1056,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2053.225,2056.094,--If they had the necessary intent and purpose.
2006.05-1056,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2064.55,2066.6,"Suppose it is never, it is never combined?"
2006.05-1056,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2066.6,2067.902,--It wouldn't matter.
2006.05-1056,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2067.902,2072.687,So you... and the reason it wouldn't matter on your view is that the component is--
2006.05-1056,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2077.091,2077.824,That's right.
2006.05-1056,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2077.824,2078.458,All right.
2006.05-1056,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2079.71,2080.092,It could be--
2006.05-1056,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2080.092,2084.844,--Why doesn't that get you right back to the point that Justice Breyer was making?
2006.05-1056,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2111.145,2112.764,--Here's the difference.
2006.05-1056,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2112.764,2113.881,What is the difference?
2006.05-1056,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2113.881,2120.768,"And it's nicely embodied in Microsoft's reply's use, repeated use of the word ""antecedent""."
2006.05-1056,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2149.769,2162.444,"Yes, but the ""continuously"" does not describe the process of going from the master disk to what you claim to be the infringing computer sold in Europe."
2006.05-1056,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2215.913,2225.935,"I have to disagree, Justice Souter, because the blueprint... the patent is not the actual series of commands that runs the machine and neither is the blueprint."
2006.05-1056,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2301.116,2310.639,"But suppose, suppose you had a machine that makes another machine, and if you ship that machine to Europe... and there's a patent for the machine that makes it."
2006.05-1056,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2317.892,2318.342,"--No, no, no."
2006.05-1056,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2342.09,2374.979,"How would you, how would you... go back for a second, please, because, if you're finished with that, because I don't see how to decide for you without at the same time permitting a person to walk over to the Patent Office, to read that application and the description, which after all at least can be a very highly detailed set of instructions of how to make a machine, getting on the phone, explaining that just like the blueprint which it is just like to somebody in Europe."
2006.05-1056,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2382.584,2383.417,--I don't because--
2006.05-1056,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2383.417,2388.821,And so what's the difference between that and this case for you?
2006.05-1056,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2388.821,2416.054,"--Justice Breyer, there is a long, long spectrum with respect to software that goes, goes from high level system architecture to all the way down through component architecture, pseudo code, source code, which is, which is a description that humans understand, and the actual machine language that a computer will understand."
2006.05-1056,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2486.735,2489.187,"That, that code is not patentable, you've said."
2006.05-1056,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2489.187,2490.52,--The code is not patentable.
2006.05-1056,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2504.446,2507.664,But what is it that they export and send overseas?
2006.05-1056,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2507.664,2511.95,They export in a variety of different physical forms--
2006.05-1056,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2511.95,2512.802,"Right, it's a thing."
2006.05-1056,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2514.385,2518.706,--It is an intangible sequence of commands that is carrying--
2006.05-1056,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2518.706,2526.11,"It is an object that has coded onto it, transferred to it in a readable way, those commands."
2006.05-1056,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2527.093,2529.078,"--Well, it's not necessarily an object."
2006.05-1056,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2534.381,2539.785,"Mr. Waxman, this may, this may help focus that question."
2006.05-1056,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2551.843,2554.962,If... that depends how it were made.
2006.05-1056,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2555.645,2557.914,I hope we can continue calling it the golden disk.
2006.05-1056,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2563.151,2566.937,"--Justice Ginsburg, the question is what is made."
2006.05-1056,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2575.042,2575.492,No.
2006.05-1056,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2584.981,2597.289,"--If the, if the object code itself, the very precise sequence that can't be changed, is supplied from the United States--"
2006.05-1056,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2597.289,2597.739,Yes.
2006.05-1056,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2597.739,2599.907,--the act is implicated.
2006.05-1056,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2599.907,2601.241,So the only thing--
2006.05-1056,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2601.241,2601.774,Regardless of--
2006.05-1056,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2601.774,2610.53,"--The only thing supplied is this, one side calls it abstract, one side calls it something else."
2006.05-1056,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2618.868,2619.368,--That's right.
2006.05-1056,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2619.368,2622.487,Any physical manifestation of it is done abroad.
2006.05-1056,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2626.658,2638.03,"Well, yes, except that the intangible sequence of commands can only be carried in the form of, by attaching it to a physical platform or a bucket."
2006.05-1056,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2638.03,2638.549,"Yes, but it doesn't have to be--"
2006.05-1056,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2638.549,2640.399,Even a radio wave.
2006.05-1056,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2644.268,2648.588,--The physical object does not have to originate in the United States.
2006.05-1056,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2655.058,2656.26,"Well, of course, and they do that."
2006.05-1056,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2656.26,2657.027,Yes.
2006.05-1056,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2657.027,2675.889,They press a button and they have an electronic transmission that sends a stream of protons under the Atlantic Ocean and are changed into electrical impulses that are used to inscribe the precise code onto a hard drive in the form of electromagnetic pulses.
2006.05-1056,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2675.889,2678.924,But that they now send to some central point which redistributes them.
2006.05-1056,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2686.947,2688.899,That may be.
2006.05-1056,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2689.549,2691.767,Which is exactly what happens in this case?
2006.05-1056,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2691.767,2693.834,--It's one of the things that happens in this case.
2006.05-1056,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2699.437,2710.895,"My question is if that is what happens, when the retransmission takes place when one copy is converted into 500 how can those 500 all be components rather than copies of the single component?"
2006.05-1056,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2710.895,2716.132,"Well, the only... I have two answers to that question, both of them I think directly answering your question."
2006.05-1056,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2742.116,2744.616,But is there any precedent for that sort of thing?
2006.05-1056,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2808.392,2810.261,I'm not aware of any.
2006.05-1056,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2888.594,2898.05,"Well, is it an answer to Justice Breyer, or maybe it isn't, that we have no conceptual problem saying there would be liability if this happened within the territorial limits of the United States?"
2006.05-1056,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2898.05,2899.135,Absolutely not.
2006.05-1056,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2899.135,2906.305,"And so there shouldn't be a greater conceptual problem if you prevail, in applying it abroad."
2006.05-1056,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2906.305,2907.091,That's--
2006.05-1056,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2907.091,2907.724,"Well, sure, there is."
2006.05-1056,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2908.257,2911.476,"--If I can, I just want to make sure I answer your question."
2006.05-1056,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2911.476,2917.197,--But it's totally different in that of course it violates the patent in the United States.
2006.05-1056,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2971.598,2972.2,Okay.
2006.05-1056,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3058.056,3058.439,All right.
2006.05-1056,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3058.873,3061.674,These are instructions not about how to make something.
2006.05-1056,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3066.994,3069.261,--You can perfectly well say that in this case.
2006.05-1056,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3081.754,3098.098,"You could not say that because if you take the information from a golden master or a stream of photons and put it on a hard drive, unless that continues to move and change in form, the computer will not work."
2006.05-1056,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3126.533,3143.828,"That simply means that after the... the... the... the idea as you put it, has been placed on the hard drive, certain other processes must take place too before we get the result that people are buying computers to... to obtain."
2006.05-1056,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3168.61,3172.396,--It's not because the blueprint has no further work to do.
2006.05-1056,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3173.098,3173.498,Sure.
2006.05-1056,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3174.631,3191.225,"--Something you teach, has no further work to do with respect to the infringing device, but the object code works continuously and gives continuous instructions to the various hardware components completely unlike."
2006.05-1056,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3191.959,3195.194,The object code has several jobs.
2006.05-1056,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3229.065,3255.133,"--Justice Souter, just taking your... taking that as... that as the case, the United States in footnote 2 of its brief repeats what Microsoft argued in the court of appeals and the district court, which is that if it took instead of one golden master, but 100,000 CDs, which is what a golden master is, one for each computer, that would be a 271(f) infringement."
2006.05-1056,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3393.456,3400.646,Can you think of any machine... can you think of any machine other than a computer that has a component that is not a physical thing?
2006.05-1056,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3400.646,3401.512,--I can't.
2006.05-1056,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3433.767,3435.902,"Thank you, Mr. Waxman."
2006.05-1056,3,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3439.021,3440.137,"Thank you, Justice Scalia."
2006.05-1056,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3468.373,3468.973,I'm sorry.
2006.05-1056,3,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3468.973,3476.794,What this essentially comes down to is something that Mr. Waxman repeatedly said.
2006.05-1056,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3528.612,3546.541,"His answer to me is that... that... it's sort of misleading to think of this as if it's just information, because it's really a method that switches things at a level of detail that is impossible to put in a patent application."
2006.05-1056,3,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3558.014,3558.614,--That's right.
2006.05-1056,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3558.614,3561.633,And it's putting that on the disk and then it makes other things happen.
2006.05-1056,3,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3561.633,3562.483,I agree.
2006.05-1056,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3562.483,3573.524,"It's putting something physical on a disk, pits and lands, instructions that are copied from the master disk and then put into either a hard drive or a disk, it's the same thing."
2006.05-1056,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3593.871,3599.758,Are you saying that the infringement act that happened in the United States involved no components?
2006.05-1056,3,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3599.758,3612.766,"The infringement that happened in the United States which was under Section B, which provides Section B inducement liability for making copies domestically of... the same thing that happened here."
2006.05-1056,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3635.948,3645.304,"--So they had a license to do that, because if they didn't have a license to make the master disk here in the United States, the making of it would have violated the patent; is that right?"
2006.05-1056,3,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3645.304,3655.095,"--The making of the master disk if actually used in a computer with a microphone and a speaker, and that's the liability that existed in the stipulation under 271(a)."
