2000.99-1871,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,14.261,"We'll hear argument next in Number 99-1871, Department of the Interior and Bureau of Indian Affairs v. Klamath, the Klamath Water Users Protective Association."
2000.99-1871,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,61.461,64.381,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2000.99-1871,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,91.682,92.916,"By DOI, Department of the Interior?"
2000.99-1871,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,92.916,93.619,--That's correct.
2000.99-1871,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,109.815,118.67,"Mr. Stewart, there was some long-term plan for this water basin that was being considered?"
2000.99-1871,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,118.67,130.009,"At the time that the documents submitted, the Department of Interior or the Bureau of Reclamation more specifically was attempting to prepare a long-term operations plan for the Klamath project."
2000.99-1871,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,130.009,132.338,Has that been abandoned?
2000.99-1871,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,132.338,133.853,It has not been abandoned.
2000.99-1871,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,138.15,140.102,Is it still under preparation?
2000.99-1871,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,140.102,141.382,--It is still under preparation.
2000.99-1871,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,141.382,141.788,Is it ongoing?
2000.99-1871,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,141.788,153.204,"It is still ongoing on a year-by-year basis the Bureau of Reclamation, or BOR, manages the Klamath project based on water availability during the course of that year."
2000.99-1871,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,210.48,217.21,So in the Oregon litigation I take it then the United States is really acting as counsel for the tribes?
2000.99-1871,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,217.21,219.273,We are not technically acting as their attorney.
2000.99-1871,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,228.363,236.657,"Well, are the claims that the tribes' lawyers are supporting the claims that the United States filed, or are they separate claims?"
2000.99-1871,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,236.657,239.5,--The United States has filed claims on behalf of the tribes.
2000.99-1871,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,252.463,252.852,So--
2000.99-1871,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,252.852,264.692,"With respect to a small fraction of the case the tribes have filed their own claim that differs marginally from that of the United States on their behalf, but I think there is nearly a 100-percent alignment of interests in the Oregon--"
2000.99-1871,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,264.692,267.863,"--So your interests... with that minor exception, your interests are identical."
2000.99-1871,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,270.346,271.08,--That's correct.
2000.99-1871,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,271.08,271.346,Okay.
2000.99-1871,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,276.641,277.406,That's correct.
2000.99-1871,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,288.369,300.599,"If there were a separation of responsibility within the United States presentations and if these documents had been given to the right hand rather than the left hand of the United States, would you still say they were privileged?"
2000.99-1871,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,300.599,320.686,"--I think we would certainly say that to the extent the submissions were submitted... to the extent the documents were submitted to the United States in its capacity as trustee, that is, with regard to the preparation of the United States' claims on the tribes' behalf, they would be privileged and confidential."
2000.99-1871,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,320.686,329.383,But wasn't there some effort at the time the FOIA was drafted or amended to put in an exemption for a trustee which Congress turned down?
2000.99-1871,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,329.383,344.331,"In 1976 there was a legislative proposal that would have created a new FOIA exemption for all documents in the possession of a Government agency pertaining to the exercise of trust responsibilities, and that bill was never acted on."
2000.99-1871,1,16131,andrew_hitchings,,1712.191,1722.263,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2000.99-1871,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2674.365,2687.017,"I'd like to address the question of the role of the Government in allocating a scarce benefit, and particularly with regard to the Oregon general stream adjudication."
