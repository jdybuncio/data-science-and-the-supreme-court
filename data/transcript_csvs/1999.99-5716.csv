1999.99-5716,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.965,"We'll hear argument next in No. 99-5716, Floyd Carter v. United States."
1999.99-5716,0,21197,donald_j_mccauley,,15.698,18.165,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1999.99-5716,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,54.417,57.993,"I don't think the Government contests you on that point, Mr. McCauley."
1999.99-5716,0,21197,donald_j_mccauley,,71.674,77.782,I don't believe... the Prince case reveals that there was not an altering of the common law.
1999.99-5716,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,137.241,141.38,What do you make... how do you distinguish or how do you treat the Bell case?
1999.99-5716,0,21197,donald_j_mccauley,,141.38,148.175,The Bell case doesn't... it's not changing the common law understanding.
1999.99-5716,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,179.788,187.94,"Well, do... do you agree that we apply the so-called elements test to determine whether it's a lesser included offense?"
1999.99-5716,0,21197,donald_j_mccauley,,187.94,188.909,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1999.99-5716,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,190.925,191.237,Okay.
1999.99-5716,0,21197,donald_j_mccauley,,211.072,216.288,"Well, if I may address the monetary value problem first, Justice O'Connor."
1999.99-5716,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,253.883,257.63,"Well, what if the Court says it doesn't go to punishment, it's an element?"
1999.99-5716,0,21197,donald_j_mccauley,,258.819,265.035,--Then it is... then it is embraced in the robbery provision's requirement of money... a money requirement.
1999.99-5716,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,265.035,277.109,Why isn't the simple answer that the... that the... whatever it is... the... the lesser degree of... of larceny is clearly included because there is no particular value requirement there at all?
1999.99-5716,0,21197,donald_j_mccauley,,284.464,285.355,Yes.
1999.99-5716,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,285.355,291.415,"That's all you have to do to... to win your... I mean, on this point, that's all you have to show to win your case, isn't it?"
1999.99-5716,0,21197,donald_j_mccauley,,291.415,300.147,"Show that the elements are a subset of the greater, and I believe the money requirement in the greater offense embraced whether it's $1,000, whether it's $100, whether it's above $100--"
1999.99-5716,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,300.147,318.513,"No, but let's... I mean, in order for you to prevail here, I think all we would have to conclude was that there was some value requirement in the robbery statute, as you pointed out, and that there was some value requirement in at least one version of larceny."
1999.99-5716,0,21197,donald_j_mccauley,,331.509,332.82,"--Yes, Justice Souter."
1999.99-5716,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,332.82,344.004,But then... but then the... the greater larceny charge would not be a lesser included offense and you would not have give the instruction if you want to get the fellow for... I'm sorry.
1999.99-5716,0,21197,donald_j_mccauley,,348.579,355.124,"The $1,000 I submit is within the universe of the monetary element of robbery."
1999.99-5716,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,355.124,359.403,"No, but all you want is a lesser... maybe I don't understand your case."
1999.99-5716,0,21197,donald_j_mccauley,,362.902,363.918,That's correct.
1999.99-5716,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,363.918,371.352,"So, if you get a lesser included instruction for whatever it is, the... the minor... the lesser larceny, that's all you want."
1999.99-5716,0,21197,donald_j_mccauley,,373.258,373.602,"No, you do not."
1999.99-5716,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,373.602,393.671,"Well, that's not going to help you very much if... if your client stole a yacht and the jury is instructed, you need not... you need not convict him of... of robbery for stealing the yacht if you find that instead he's guilty of larceny of property worth... worth less than $1,000."
1999.99-5716,0,21197,donald_j_mccauley,,400.902,403.947,"And both of them are within that, yes, Your Honor."
1999.99-5716,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,404.119,404.385,You do.
1999.99-5716,0,21197,donald_j_mccauley,,404.385,406.103,--my client has never been on a yacht.
1999.99-5716,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,408.368,410.664,"Yes, but this was $16,000."
1999.99-5716,0,21197,donald_j_mccauley,,415.256,416.115,"--Yes, Justice O'Connor."
1999.99-5716,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,416.115,419.77,There's no way that... that the lesser larceny instruction would have helped you.
1999.99-5716,0,21197,donald_j_mccauley,,423.582,428.111,"The lesser offense of larceny, as that term is understood, a conviction on that."
1999.99-5716,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,439.792,445.104,"Well, what if the court were to think it was an element not going... not a sentencing factor, but an element?"
1999.99-5716,0,21197,donald_j_mccauley,,446.571,456.38,"--I submit it... it is not outside the Schmuck understanding and... as a subset of the universal monetary, 0 to a million, thousand is within."
1999.99-5716,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,456.38,458.599,And you've... you've not addressed the carrying away problem.
1999.99-5716,0,21197,donald_j_mccauley,,458.599,462.941,The carrying away is a common law term signifying asportation.
1999.99-5716,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,495.583,498.599,Was asportation involved in common law larceny too?
1999.99-5716,0,21197,donald_j_mccauley,,502.534,502.972,Yes.
1999.99-5716,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,502.972,507.299,And common law larceny was considered a lesser included offense of robbery at common law.
1999.99-5716,0,21197,donald_j_mccauley,,507.299,508.172,"Yes, Your Honor."
1999.99-5716,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,508.172,509.625,What about the third?
1999.99-5716,0,21197,donald_j_mccauley,,519.837,520.525,Yes.
1999.99-5716,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,520.525,525.367,"Then you have larceny, which involves taking money from a bank."
1999.99-5716,0,21197,donald_j_mccauley,,531.928,532.787,Yes.
1999.99-5716,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,532.787,536.77,"Now, my problem, I guess from the Government's point of view, is I happen to leave out one phrase."
1999.99-5716,0,21197,donald_j_mccauley,,572.897,576.801,That... that term is no longer there.
1999.99-5716,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,601.635,606.663,"First, before we get to the clarification, you're saying the word feloniously... that did it."
1999.99-5716,0,21197,donald_j_mccauley,,617.769,619.159,--Intent to steal.
1999.99-5716,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,619.159,619.519,--Right.
1999.99-5716,0,21197,donald_j_mccauley,,619.519,621.298,"Yes, Justice Ginsburg."
1999.99-5716,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,672.856,677.463,"If you're right, Mr. McCauley, why didn't they change the other statute too?"
1999.99-5716,0,21197,donald_j_mccauley,,681.697,685.492,--The term feloniously was not in the larceny provision.
1999.99-5716,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,685.492,692.926,"You're saying they thought that feloniously would... would confuse the reader to think it has... it was a felony, rather than a misdemeanor."
1999.99-5716,0,21197,donald_j_mccauley,,692.926,694.504,That... that may... that may explain it.
1999.99-5716,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,697.096,699.626,But it was a part of a wholesale cleanup operation.
1999.99-5716,0,21197,donald_j_mccauley,,708.061,708.498,--Yes.
1999.99-5716,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,708.498,710.139,They took out other feloniously's?
1999.99-5716,0,21197,donald_j_mccauley,,710.139,710.982,Yes.
1999.99-5716,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,731.927,735.207,"Well, Morissette is totally different from this case, it seems to me."
1999.99-5716,0,21197,donald_j_mccauley,,746.265,749.639,--I think there's a subtle difference.
1999.99-5716,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,809.631,818.267,"That a criminal statute is going to be... if... if it's silent as to intent, there's going to be some mens rea requirement."
1999.99-5716,0,21197,donald_j_mccauley,,818.267,818.783,--Yes.
1999.99-5716,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,818.783,829.483,But I think that's quite different from the situation here where the elements have been quite... quite specifically specified and one... one substantially differs from the other.
1999.99-5716,0,21197,donald_j_mccauley,,829.483,837.463,"My point is the missing mens rea in the conversion statute interpreted in Morissette was a general mens rea, a general--"
1999.99-5716,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,837.463,838.275,Is... is--
1999.99-5716,0,21197,donald_j_mccauley,,838.275,840.572,--whereas robbery is specific intent to steal.
1999.99-5716,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,858.659,863.062,--May I just go back to... I want to make sure that I understood your... understand your argument.
1999.99-5716,0,21197,donald_j_mccauley,,923.57,925.21,"Exactly, Justice Souter."
1999.99-5716,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,925.21,925.46,Okay.
1999.99-5716,0,21197,donald_j_mccauley,,925.46,927.194,Exactly.
1999.99-5716,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,927.194,931.505,May I just ask one question going back to the dollar problem in the case?
1999.99-5716,0,21197,donald_j_mccauley,,940.486,941.126,Yes.
1999.99-5716,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,963.008,964.491,How about grand larceny?
1999.99-5716,0,21197,donald_j_mccauley,,964.96,972.926,"--Grand larceny was greater than the sixpence, but grand larceny was... Blackstone says it's right within the robbery understanding."
1999.99-5716,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,979.236,985.172,"I think your answer to my question was what Justice Souter just said, but I'm not sure."
1999.99-5716,0,21197,donald_j_mccauley,,996.559,997.354,--Yes.
1999.99-5716,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,997.354,997.729,Yes.
1999.99-5716,0,21197,donald_j_mccauley,,1000.493,1002.149,After 1948--
1999.99-5716,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1002.149,1003.461,"Not, not."
1999.99-5716,0,21197,donald_j_mccauley,,1007.648,1009.615,--My understand--
1999.99-5716,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1009.615,1012.708,"Now, this is the case that I think tests it."
1999.99-5716,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1531.925,1543.094,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1999.99-5716,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1566.131,1567.816,"Mr. Frederick, you said it is a lesser included offense."
1999.99-5716,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1567.816,1568.16,--Sorry.
1999.99-5716,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1594.823,1606.068,"That's actually a bad example, but I'm just... it does illustrate that my great difficulty in finding an instance where this intent to steal could make a difference."
1999.99-5716,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1607.536,1607.895,--Yes.
1999.99-5716,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1607.895,1608.536,What?
1999.99-5716,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1608.536,1614.315,And we have given you the... we have given you this fact situation in the footnote in our briefs.
1999.99-5716,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1614.315,1615.596,You mean the Tenth Circuit hypothetical.
1999.99-5716,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1615.596,1615.877,Yes.
1999.99-5716,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1617.861,1618.049,What?
1999.99-5716,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1618.502,1630.779,--where the defendant commits a bank robbery because he is unable to live in a free society and in a comfortable way and commits a bank robbery with the intent of getting captured.
1999.99-5716,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1632.479,1634.978,The intent of stealing and getting caught stealing.
1999.99-5716,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1637.196,1643.242,--He doesn't have an intent to deprive permanently the custodial arrangement of the bank of property.
1999.99-5716,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1643.242,1646.192,"--Well, he would if he knew that that's the only thing that's going to get him in jail."
1999.99-5716,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1646.192,1670.823,"Justice Scalia, what is important here is what the prosecution must plead and prove beyond a reasonable doubt, and it is reasonable to infer that Congress, in enacting the bank robbery provision, would not want to subject the Government to proof where the robber had engaged in such unambiguously dangerous activity as using force or putting somebody in fear or intimidation to take property."
1999.99-5716,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1670.823,1677.915,"Yes, but in the real world, that proof requirement is going to be as simple... is satisfied as simply as rolling off a log."
1999.99-5716,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1677.915,1698.437,"Justice Souter, in addition to the instance where the person is not committing the robbery with the intent to steal because he wants to go back to prison, there are circumstances and there... there are real cases where the defendant commits the robbery with the purpose of having the Bureau of Prisons provide health care for the person."
1999.99-5716,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1698.437,1698.703,"Oh, yes."
1999.99-5716,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1720.491,1726.474,"--Or to put it another way, why is leaving it out of the statute any more absurd than leaving it out of the common law?"
1999.99-5716,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1726.474,1727.894,Justice--
1999.99-5716,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1727.894,1729.16,"I mean, the common law didn't include it."
1999.99-5716,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1730.785,1731.582,--The common law--
1999.99-5716,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1731.582,1732.317,That cannot be.
1999.99-5716,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1732.317,1736.798,"--You know, Justice Scalia, I would want to... to refer to the common law in this regard."
1999.99-5716,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1748.483,1750.139,What about... what we really want to know is the words--
1999.99-5716,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1750.139,1753.138,--There was a question before that.
1999.99-5716,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1754.574,1777.409,"The words that Congress actually used in not having an intent to steal requirement were consistent with the modern trend of legislatures, including Congress, to make robbery a general intent crime because robbery is a crime against the person, and the social evil that legislatures are legislating against is the knowing use of force to take property from a person."
1999.99-5716,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1792.512,1794.543,Now answer Justice Breyer's question.
1999.99-5716,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1794.543,1797.339,"Could you rephrase your question please, sir?"
1999.99-5716,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1797.339,1798.621,Sorry.
1999.99-5716,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1829.779,1831.028,Well--
1999.99-5716,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1831.028,1833.45,"So, I... I don't know why that's a good example."
1999.99-5716,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1843.32,1848.865,--I have two other examples to provide the Court for its consideration.
1999.99-5716,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1874.151,1875.214,And you want to get him for bank robbery.
1999.99-5716,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1875.214,1875.605,--Yes.
1999.99-5716,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1875.605,1876.119,Weird.
1999.99-5716,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1876.119,1877.072,"No, it's not."
1999.99-5716,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1877.072,1881.087,Isn't there some other provision of the United States Code that... that would cover this kind of thing?
1999.99-5716,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1881.087,1892.005,"Justice Scalia, the elements that Congress provided demonstrate that the defendant has engaged in the kind of behavior that should be held criminally culpable."
1999.99-5716,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1894.097,1904.781,"But my problem with that argument is do you... do you consider that until the word feloniously was taken out, it was a lesser included offense?"
1999.99-5716,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1904.781,1905.905,--No.
1999.99-5716,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1905.905,1909.075,"Ah, so what was the law pre-1948?"
1999.99-5716,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1909.075,1919.446,"The Government has consistently charged these as independent provisions, according to their elements, from the time of enactment up until the present day."
1999.99-5716,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1919.446,1937.768,"So, before 1948, if on a bank robbery indictment, which did not include also a count of bank larceny, counsel for the defense had said, judge, I would like you to give a lesser included offense charge pre-1948."
1999.99-5716,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1943.297,1961.227,"That's correct for the two additional reasons that we've highlighted as differences between these two provisions, that there is no carrying away, asportation, requirement in bank robbery and that for a felony bank larceny to be made out, the prosecution must plead and prove that the property is worth more than $1,000."
1999.99-5716,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1961.227,1963.321,"But not for misdemeanor larceny, I take it."
1999.99-5716,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1963.321,1970.458,"That's correct, as to the valuation element, Justice Souter, but there's no carrying away requirement as a distinction."
1999.99-5716,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1970.458,1973.254,Do... do you know what was the Department of Justice's practice before 1948?
1999.99-5716,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1983.36,1986.937,I... I cannot give you the specific charging practice.
1999.99-5716,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2014.723,2021.205,"But in these cases, has the Government ever... ever taken the position that they can charge both offenses and get cumulative punishment for the two?"
1999.99-5716,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2021.205,2024.422,"--Prior to Prince, the Government did take that position."
1999.99-5716,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2031.732,2032.732,It could under your theory of the case.
1999.99-5716,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2032.732,2033.31,--That's correct.
1999.99-5716,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2033.31,2033.841,Yes.
1999.99-5716,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2033.841,2034.794,That's correct.
1999.99-5716,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2057.409,2062.407,"Mr. Frederick, tell me about those three others because one of his points was, it was a... I did... I did the job the same way."
1999.99-5716,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2075.402,2077.87,"I don't think that's correct, Justice Ginsburg."
1999.99-5716,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2091.833,2098.394,"Yes, but isn't it true that in the typical case... John Dillinger statute... he goes in, robs a bank."
1999.99-5716,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2104.562,2109.982,"No, I don't think that's correct, Justice Stevens, as a matter of the way the sentencing guidelines work."
1999.99-5716,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2111.217,2111.592,"Well, forget the sentencing guidelines."
1999.99-5716,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2113.09,2114.105,--We could prosecute him for both--
1999.99-5716,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2114.105,2114.543,Right.
1999.99-5716,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2114.543,2117.433,--because it requires proof of distinctive elements.
1999.99-5716,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2117.433,2117.964,Right.
1999.99-5716,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2117.964,2124.634,And I would point out to you that this is no different from the way many State courts have construed modern robbery statutes.
1999.99-5716,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2167.226,2168.679,Let's... let's do the money.
1999.99-5716,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2215.208,2222.986,Because it requires the prosecution to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that element which changes the offense.
1999.99-5716,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2222.986,2234.246,"But the purpose of that proof is just to decide which of the two lesser included offenses you get into, but to get into the category of lesser included offense, you don't have to prove anything."
1999.99-5716,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2254.379,2267.125,"It changes the constitutional requirements, Justice Scalia, because in this provision, felony bank larceny requires that fact to be put in the indictment and found by the grand jury."
1999.99-5716,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2272.685,2275.232,"Yes, but wouldn't that be taken care of in the instruction to the jury."
1999.99-5716,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2294.208,2295.739,It depends on how the--
1999.99-5716,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2295.739,2297.567,And it just... let me just ask one question.
1999.99-5716,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2303.33,2313.451,"--I don't think that there is a conclusive answer at common law because even Blackstone was reciting not just common law decisions, but also the statutes."
1999.99-5716,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2331.85,2332.397,"Well, that's a--"
1999.99-5716,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2332.397,2333.116,--Isn't it still the rule?
1999.99-5716,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2340.174,2362.54,"Justice Ginsburg, I don't know what the rule in England is now, but I do know that the rule in the States of the United States is that in those places where State legislatures have changed the elements of the crime, robbery and larceny are not lesser and greater included offenses where robbery does not require proof of elements that are found in larceny."
1999.99-5716,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2366.07,2366.648,They go both ways I think.
1999.99-5716,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2366.648,2373.239,"They go unrebutted by the other side, Justice Ginsburg, with respect to those specific elements on all three of them."
1999.99-5716,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2373.239,2380.581,Aren't there a number of States that have holdings that bank larceny is a lesser included offense of bank robbery?
1999.99-5716,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2382.423,2389.014,State courts construing 2113 or State courts construing their own robbery and larceny statutes?
1999.99-5716,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2392.997,2399.681,"--I wouldn't... I don't know why a State court would be interpreting 21... they wouldn't have the prosecution for that, so it would have to be their own statutes."
1999.99-5716,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2399.681,2405.055,"--Well, actually that's not correct because there's not exclusive jurisdiction with respect to this provision."
1999.99-5716,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2405.305,2410.053,Is it... what is the incidence of... of State prosecutions under the Federal statute?
1999.99-5716,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2410.053,2412.584,--I'm not aware of a large number of those.
1999.99-5716,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2435.808,2450.771,"Given... that... that's basically... you're now right at the point of where my real question is because I... the... the serious question is this, that I imagine it's possible... we were thinking of facts of the Thomas Crowne Affair."
1999.99-5716,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2532.877,2550.355,"Justice Breyer, the Thomas Crowne Affair involved a larceny and not a robbery, and that distinction is critical because if Thomas Crowne had pulled out a gun and used force to take the painting, regardless of what he ultimately intended to do with it, he would have done something that demonstrates criminal culpability."
1999.99-5716,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2550.355,2552.385,That is precisely my point.
1999.99-5716,2,21197,donald_j_mccauley,,3345.042,3346.448,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1999.99-5716,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3387.681,3390.821,Does the common law include any statutes?
1999.99-5716,2,21197,donald_j_mccauley,,3390.821,3394.132,"--There were statutes based upon the common law, taking the common law terms."
1999.99-5716,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3562.047,3563.609,"Thank you, Mr. McCauley."
