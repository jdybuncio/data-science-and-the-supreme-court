2001.01-682,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,2.395,"We'll hear argument next in No. 01-682, Kay Barnes v. Jeffrey Gorman."
2001.01-682,0,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,2.601,30.548,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Eighth Circuit held in this case that a private plaintiff may obtain punitive damages in an action brought against municipal government defendants under section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act."
2001.01-682,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,62.499,72.901,"Mr. Robbins, did any... did the petitioners raise the Newport case at any time below?"
2001.01-682,0,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,72.901,73.273,No.
2001.01-682,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,73.273,74.304,Why not?
2001.01-682,0,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,74.304,77.814,The... the party--
2001.01-682,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,77.814,82.849,"I mean, it looks like the most obvious source of law on this topic."
2001.01-682,0,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,84.13,93.213,"--In the lower court, my client took the position that it was, in fact, an arm of the State, not an arm of the municipal government."
2001.01-682,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,146.379,147.305,"It doesn't change the issue, I take it."
2001.01-682,0,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,147.305,148.403,--It does not change the issue.
2001.01-682,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,163.18,164.212,Was there a reason?
2001.01-682,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,164.212,167.45,And I suppose it's not like an immunity from suit that can be waived.
2001.01-682,0,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,173.211,174.037,Exactly.
2001.01-682,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,185.926,188.239,Doesn't the Eighth Circuit allow you to argue in the alternative?
2001.01-682,0,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,199.756,203.964,--I... I think counsel could have taken that measure.
2001.01-682,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,209.72,211.745,What are we supposed to do then?
2001.01-682,0,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,249.373,254.657,"Well, I think the answer, Justice Breyer, is that we have urged both arguments."
2001.01-682,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,299.899,303.782,"Well, the Eighth Circuit said appropriate remedies."
2001.01-682,0,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,308.816,311.6,"--Well, I think that... that's the language from Franklin."
2001.01-682,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,311.6,312.903,Yes.
2001.01-682,0,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,312.903,318.271,And we think Franklin is properly confined to compensatory remedies for the reasons we've said in the brief.
2001.01-682,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,344.87,355.794,"Mr. Robbins, I don't understand why you say if this Court says Newport or Fact Concepts, whatever you want to call it... it says, a municipality is immune."
2001.01-682,0,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,374.12,377.071,"Well, I... I think it does."
2001.01-682,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,378.457,385.266,"And why should we in your case, where there is a clear ground, not decide it on that basis?"
2001.01-682,0,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,391.953,396.29,"--Let me say two things with respect to that, Justice Ginsburg."
2001.01-682,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,465.225,465.969,If the Court--
2001.01-682,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,465.969,472.013,--We would... the... the broader position would be... would be taking the case on the same basis that the Eighth Circuit decided it.
2001.01-682,0,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,473.953,476.288,I think that's correct.
2001.01-682,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,476.288,478.107,And there... this is not a constitutional matter.
2001.01-682,0,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,478.107,478.889,No.
2001.01-682,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,478.889,487.434,"So, the doctrine of... of observing the narrowest possible constitutional ground does not apply here."
2001.01-682,0,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,487.988,488.26,No.
2001.01-682,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,492.263,508.572,"So, this would be an opportunity to... to do what the Court is supposed to do, and that is clean up confusion below on the meaning of a statute, and the broader confusion is certainly much... much more worth clearing up than the narrower confusion."
2001.01-682,0,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,508.572,523.842,"Right, and I might say one of the matters we've pointed to in the petition for certiorari is, in fact, that this misconstruction of Franklin is not confined to this case, to this statute, and certainly to the Eighth Circuit."
2001.01-682,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,570.987,572.595,Explicitory?
2001.01-682,0,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,573.521,573.976,--I'm sorry?
2001.01-682,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,573.976,575.295,Did you say explicitory?
2001.01-682,0,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,575.295,576.97,"Good heavens, I hope not."
2001.01-682,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,577.591,578.084,I like it though.
2001.01-682,0,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,580.479,601.862,"Well, what... what I certainly meant to say is that Bell and Hood stem from a line of authority that says that courts have the authority, the inherent authority I... I had meant to say, when... when charged with the construction of a statute to make good the wrong done."
2001.01-682,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,629.892,638.52,"Well, did the compensatory damages in this case include damages for humiliation, or am I wrong about that?"
2001.01-682,0,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,638.52,643.366,I... I do not... I have not seen an indication that it included that.
2001.01-682,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,644.215,651.524,In... in this... is the jury instructed in this jurisdiction that compensatory damages include damages?
2001.01-682,0,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,659.53,675.051,"--I... we have included the instruction, Justice Kennedy, at page 72 of the joint appendix, and I do not find a specific reference to that."
2001.01-682,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,676.537,678.273,"Well, I guess it... it goes to the make-whole point."
2001.01-682,0,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,694.248,706.63,"--Well, I guess I'd be inclined to... to think about that in a case in which somebody had argued that below or here."
2001.01-682,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,706.63,708.078,But it wouldn't achieve that.
2001.01-682,0,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,708.078,709.042,But... but--
2001.01-682,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,709.042,709.397,It wouldn't achieve that.
2001.01-682,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,730.286,744.032,"--But I want you to assume... and I believe this is the law in many jurisdictions... that punitive damages are given in part to ease the... the... it's smart money in order to ease the... the pain that the person suffers, et cetera."
2001.01-682,0,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,744.032,744.608,--Right.
2001.01-682,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,774.868,775.09,I understand.
2001.01-682,0,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,775.09,776.27,--for the category called pain and suffering and he was made whole.
2001.01-682,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,789.373,797.281,"Well, that's true, but the statute doesn't say specifically about whether to give an injunction, about whether you could give a trademark remedy."
2001.01-682,0,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,819.45,821.019,--Well--
2001.01-682,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,821.019,827.745,"Why should we divide up, in other words... there's this amount of the common law action, but not that amount."
2001.01-682,0,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,838.248,839.141,--Yes.
2001.01-682,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,839.141,840.377,--that private people can bring.
2001.01-682,0,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,846.943,849.272,Precisely because this is not a common law action.
2001.01-682,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,851.317,851.977,--All right.
2001.01-682,0,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,851.977,853.175,--as to which--
2001.01-682,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,853.175,854.018,"So, which one shall we separate out?"
2001.01-682,0,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,856.064,856.231,"--Well, as to which Congress has spoken."
2001.01-682,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,946.714,947.996,"Very well, Mr. Robbins."
2001.01-682,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,951.09,973.835,"The statutes at issue in this case, section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act and title II of the ADA, do not sanction the award of punitive damages which are, by their definition, damages in excess of that necessary to make good any wrong done."
2001.01-682,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1058.83,1059.573,Tell me.
2001.01-682,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1064.653,1076.375,"We think the Court addressed that in passing in the Carlson v. Green case, and we think that that... the discussion of punitive damages in that case is properly regarded as... as dictum in that case."
2001.01-682,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1077.489,1088.346,"So, do... do I infer from your... from your response that it is the position of the Department that punitive damages should not be awarded in Bivens cases?"
2001.01-682,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1088.346,1092.146,"--Yes, but there are two distinctions between Bivens and this case."
2001.01-682,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1120.502,1121.867,What about 1983?
2001.01-682,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1125.498,1129.297,"That... that's correct, Justice Ginsburg."
2001.01-682,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1185.247,1190.72,"But you... and you rely on the heavy gun in statutes like title VI, title IX."
2001.01-682,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1205.952,1207.81,"--Well, first of all, it does happen."
2001.01-682,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1226.385,1229.812,"Under the Rehabilitation Act, it has been used under 504?"
2001.01-682,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1229.812,1230.351,Yes.
2001.01-682,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1356.667,1357.632,"Thank you, Mr. Garre."
2001.01-682,2,41826,scott_l_nelson,,1361.125,1387.215,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This case presents the issue of whether Congress foreclosed awards of punitive damages when it enacted the rights of action to enforce section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act and title II of the ADA which together prohibit discrimination against people with disabilities in the provision of public services."
2001.01-682,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1399.036,1408.308,"Well, if... now that the Eleventh Amendment immunity issue is gone, don't we have to deal with City of Newport?"
2001.01-682,2,41826,scott_l_nelson,,1408.308,1411.735,"--Well, I think the answer to that, Justice O'Connor, is no."
2001.01-682,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1421.888,1426.634,"Well, do you say that we are precluded from considering that authority as we resolve this case?"
2001.01-682,2,41826,scott_l_nelson,,1426.634,1427.543,"No, I don't say--"
2001.01-682,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1427.543,1427.832,No.
2001.01-682,2,41826,scott_l_nelson,,1427.832,1428.575,--you're precluded from it.
2001.01-682,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1429.607,1429.978,No.
2001.01-682,2,41826,scott_l_nelson,,1430.887,1432.002,--Yes.
2001.01-682,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1480.012,1482.9,"Franklin wasn't dealing with punitive damages, was it?"
2001.01-682,2,41826,scott_l_nelson,,1482.9,1484.553,"That's right, Mr. Chief Justice."
2001.01-682,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1490.043,1503.993,"And appropriate relief does not sound to me to be consistent with your beginning premise which was that unless Congress forecloses the remedy, we must give it."
2001.01-682,2,41826,scott_l_nelson,,1503.993,1525.337,"Well, I certainly don't mean to say that... that in any particular case, the Court must give it unless Congress forecloses it, but if Congress has not foreclosed it, it's potentially available if, in view of the policies of... of the particular statute, it's an appropriate remedy and in view of the conduct that's being addressed."
2001.01-682,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1540.319,1553.488,"Well, what do you make of the... the argument that the whole touchstone for damages here is 504, which is essentially the... the spending power... the... the... a statute resting on the spending power?"
2001.01-682,2,41826,scott_l_nelson,,1559.267,1562.339,"Well, there... there are two answers to that."
2001.01-682,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1570.374,1574.871,"But that referred to 504 for... for... in effect, for its remedial scheme."
2001.01-682,2,41826,scott_l_nelson,,1574.871,1602.157,"--To the extent that... that what it... what it says is that the remedies available, the remedies being a private right of action... and that does not necessarily, however, import a limitation imposed on that remedy from above by the Spending Clause that doesn't inhere in the... in the nature of the statute itself, assuming that the Spending Clause does impose that limitation, which I don't concede, and I'll get to in a moment."
2001.01-682,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1770.911,1772.602,"Well, you say... you say she wasn't a party to the contract."
2001.01-682,2,41826,scott_l_nelson,,1776.606,1781.314,"--Well, you could, I suppose, analogize her to a third party beneficiary, but to suggest that--"
2001.01-682,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1781.314,1783.376,--And contract actions were original tort actions.
2001.01-682,2,41826,scott_l_nelson,,1787.258,1790.23,"--Well, and in fact--"
2001.01-682,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1790.23,1790.823,I... I'm not sure a whole lot hangs on--
2001.01-682,2,41826,scott_l_nelson,,1790.823,1799.64,"--that... that argument can go the other way, too, because the States are broadly recognizing that... that malicious and bad faith breaches of contract carry with them tort remedies."
2001.01-682,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1833.92,1856.111,"--Mr.... Mr. Nelson, why don't we look specifically at this context, which is the ADA, and the anomaly that when Congress thought about punitive damages, as we know it did in the employment part, it provided for them with qualifications and with caps on amount."
2001.01-682,2,41826,scott_l_nelson,,1888.599,1903.172,"It's under title I that the caps apply, Justice Ginsburg, and I think that what that illustrates is not... not the point that... that Congress didn't intend to provide these remedies."
2001.01-682,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2005.256,2008.682,Am I right that title III says no punitive damages?
2001.01-682,2,41826,scott_l_nelson,,2008.682,2028.457,"Title III says no punitive damages at all as part of a... of a remedial scheme that is similarly circumscribed to... to title I, although in somewhat different ways, a remedial scheme that under title III doesn't make a private right of action for damages of any kind available to an individual plaintiff."
2001.01-682,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2070.0,2070.355,Why?
2001.01-682,2,41826,scott_l_nelson,,2077.952,2078.734,That's correct.
2001.01-682,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2078.734,2086.784,"So... so, I thought punitives are primarily designed to compensate an individual who's not going to be compensated."
2001.01-682,2,41826,scott_l_nelson,,2091.902,2093.201,Well--
2001.01-682,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2093.201,2106.969,"Now, why would you want that big club to be wielded against private people in limited amounts, but when you get to a government which, after all, represents the entire public, you say the sky is the limit?"
2001.01-682,2,41826,scott_l_nelson,,2115.308,2129.26,"--Well, I think the... part of the answer to that is the whole structure of the ADA remedial scheme indicates an intention to make broader remedies available against public entities than private entities to begin with."
2001.01-682,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2196.217,2209.88,"But that's an anomaly too because in title... title III, which is the... the title that imposes... title I is the one... employment."
2001.01-682,2,41826,scott_l_nelson,,2210.18,2210.623,--Correct.
2001.01-682,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2210.623,2221.108,And are government employers liable for punitive damages under title I?
2001.01-682,2,41826,scott_l_nelson,,2221.108,2221.769,"No, they are not."
2001.01-682,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2221.769,2234.483,"So, your... your notion that... that the government is not well representative in the legislature... here is a title that says, private sector, you're going to be stuck."
2001.01-682,2,41826,scott_l_nelson,,2238.57,2242.824,"Well, that... that was... that was what happened in the 1991 round."
2001.01-682,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2332.36,2334.384,But doesn't that seem rather perverse?
2001.01-682,2,41826,scott_l_nelson,,2334.384,2343.3,"Well, I think it... it seems... it seems to me that... that one can look at it either way."
2001.01-682,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2386.396,2396.799,But... but your... your Newport case certainly suggests that traditionally public entities are treated differently than private entities for the same conduct if you're talking about punitive damages.
2001.01-682,2,41826,scott_l_nelson,,2396.799,2398.452,--That's certainly true.
2001.01-682,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2440.844,2448.236,"About the issue, are you... are you suggesting that it is not included in the question presented?"
2001.01-682,2,41826,scott_l_nelson,,2448.236,2450.01,"--No, I'm not making that argument."
2001.01-682,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2450.01,2456.038,Then... then did you in your brief in opposition point out that this was not properly raised in the lower courts?
2001.01-682,2,41826,scott_l_nelson,,2456.038,2458.1,"Yes, that was pointed out in the brief in opposition."
2001.01-682,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2458.1,2464.704,I want to be sure you... suppose that we did look at the Newport issue.
2001.01-682,2,41826,scott_l_nelson,,2485.798,2486.541,Yes.
2001.01-682,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2819.216,2835.48,"Mr. Nelson, last year in... in the Alexander case and this year in the Malesko case, we've indicated that we're taking a much more critical look, I think, at these kind of claims than we ever did in Carlson."
2001.01-682,2,41826,scott_l_nelson,,2835.48,2846.421,"--Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I don't think that that's... that that's quite right with respect to... with respect to the evolution of this Court's doctrine."
2001.01-682,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2898.517,2910.527,"Well, but what... what you're arguing basically is that every one of these things is fixed in time permanently not just as to its holding, but as... as to language in it."
2001.01-682,2,41826,scott_l_nelson,,2920.93,2923.985,"Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I think that's clearly... that's clearly true."
2001.01-682,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2988.258,2995.317,And didn't say anything about whether punitives would be appropriate relief because all Franklin involved was compensatory damages.
2001.01-682,2,41826,scott_l_nelson,,3012.052,3014.181,"That's correct, Justice Ginsburg."
2001.01-682,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3097.401,3098.516,"Thank you, Mr. Nelson."
2001.01-682,3,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,3101.777,3103.141,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2001.01-682,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3354.743,3356.889,"Thank you, Mr. Robbins."
2001.01-682,3,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,3356.889,3357.548,Perhaps not.
2001.01-682,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3358.103,3359.611,You've already ended.
