1990.109_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.197,"We'll hear argument now in No. 109 Original, Oklahoma and Texas v. New Mexico."
1990.109_orig,0,36277,marian_matthews,,10.098,12.632,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.109_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,120.452,127.167,Are the provisions of the compact that you are talking about in your brief?
1990.109_orig,0,36277,marian_matthews,,127.167,128.598,Yes.
1990.109_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,278.432,286.467,I suppose there wouldn't have been any argument on this point if instead of building Ute Reservoir you had enlarged Conchas Dam?
1990.109_orig,0,36277,marian_matthews,,286.467,288.04,"That's precisely right, Your Honor."
1990.109_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,288.04,293.773,And you could have caught the floodwaters in that dam and nobody could have hardly disputed your right to do that.
1990.109_orig,0,36277,marian_matthews,,293.773,294.234,That's right.
1990.109_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,364.06,369.396,"But your, you claim that limitation only applies to water originating below Conchas; is that it?"
1990.109_orig,0,36277,marian_matthews,,369.396,371.256,"That's right, Your Honor."
1990.109_orig,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,402.619,415.958,"Ms. Matthews, is it practicable to measure how much of the water in the Ute Reservoir is from upper, above Conchas drainage and how much below?"
1990.109_orig,0,36277,marian_matthews,,415.958,416.7,"Yes, Your Honor."
1990.109_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,462.319,477.721,"Now that was one of the reasons, though, that the Master construed the compact the way he did, as I understand, was the difficulty of measuring the amount of water stored below Conchas that had originated above Conchas."
1990.109_orig,0,36277,marian_matthews,,477.721,487.597,The Master had concern about whether the alleged difficulty would be in conflict with the goal of the negotiators to have a simple compact.
1990.109_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,544.255,564.228,"Could I ask, is there any major concern here or any question about water originating above Conchas that is delivered directly to the Ute without going through Conchas Dam?"
1990.109_orig,0,36277,marian_matthews,,573.234,579.407,"I understand the question, Your Honor, and in fact the geography here is very interesting and it supports the upper and lower basin distinction."
1990.109_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,579.407,589.095,"Well, is there, but is that... the same argument, I suppose, would apply to those, the water arriving in the Canadian below Conchas if it originated above."
1990.109_orig,0,36277,marian_matthews,,589.095,593.78,"Well, in fact there are no tributaries above Conchas that flow into Ute."
1990.109_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,599.835,607.08,"Oh, so there are no, no tributaries of the Canadian that originate above Conchas that flow into the Canadian below Conchas?"
1990.109_orig,0,36277,marian_matthews,,607.08,609.252,That's my understanding of the geography.
1990.109_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,615.156,618.418,"What do you mean above Conchas, by the way?"
1990.109_orig,0,36277,marian_matthews,,620.381,621.092,Yes.
1990.109_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,632.642,633.002,Um hum.
1990.109_orig,0,36277,marian_matthews,,633.002,642.989,"And then you go downstream to Ute, and Ute is fed by Pajarito Creek and Ute Creek, both of which come in below Conchas."
1990.109_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,642.989,644.862,"But they flow into the river, do they?"
1990.109_orig,0,36277,marian_matthews,,644.862,646.172,Yes.
1990.109_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,647.163,649.574,They don't flow directly into the reservoir?
1990.109_orig,0,36277,marian_matthews,,649.574,650.235,--No.
1990.109_orig,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,657.991,661.345,And their headlands are below Conchas as well?
1990.109_orig,0,36277,marian_matthews,,661.345,661.525,Yes.
1990.109_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,675.004,678.256,When you say the lower basin you mean below Ute?
1990.109_orig,0,36277,marian_matthews,,678.256,679.228,Below Conchas.
1990.109_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,679.228,680.618,Below Conchas?
1990.109_orig,0,36277,marian_matthews,,680.618,680.918,Yes.
1990.109_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,680.918,691.226,"So there are some tributaries that arise below Conchas but above Ute that are not dammed up by Ute, that flow into the river below Ute?"
1990.109_orig,0,36277,marian_matthews,,691.907,696.141,I'm not sure that that's accurate.
1990.109_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,702.047,702.195,Yeah.
1990.109_orig,0,36277,marian_matthews,,702.195,706.77,"There are additional tributaries in the lower basin which do not flow into Ute, which flow--"
1990.109_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,706.77,709.02,What do you mean by the lower basin?
1990.109_orig,0,36277,marian_matthews,,709.02,710.132,--Below Conchas.
1990.109_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,711.013,713.505,"Okay, well then go ahead and finish your statement."
1990.109_orig,0,36277,marian_matthews,,713.505,713.795,Okay.
1990.109_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,739.103,739.243,Right.
1990.109_orig,0,36277,marian_matthews,,746.338,747.249,As a practical matter.
1990.109_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,820.208,830.854,"There was originally a contention by Texas and New Mexico, was there not, that the 200,000 limitation applied to the structure and not to the amount of water?"
1990.109_orig,0,36277,marian_matthews,,830.854,848.437,"Texas and Oklahoma originally sued New Mexico claiming that the fact that New Mexico had enlarged Ute to be, to have a gross physical capacity of more than 200,000 acre-feet was in itself a violation of the compact regardless of how much water we actually stored in it."
1990.109_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,848.437,848.735,Yes.
1990.109_orig,0,36277,marian_matthews,,848.735,860.804,"Now that was resolved against Texas and Oklahoma by the Special Master, and my understanding today is that only Oklahoma still maintains that position and took exception to that part of the report."
1990.109_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,860.804,861.204,But Oklahoma has accepted?
1990.109_orig,0,36277,marian_matthews,,861.204,862.295,"Yes, Oklahoma has."
1990.109_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1166.321,1174.838,"So you in effect said we don't anticipate any need for more water below Conchas than 200,000 acre-feet."
1990.109_orig,0,36277,marian_matthews,,1178.992,1182.284,"That was at the time of, for below Conchas, yes."
1990.109_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1182.284,1189.21,"Well, is there any possible way that you could use 250,000 acre-feet then?"
1990.109_orig,0,36277,marian_matthews,,1189.21,1191.07,"Well, yes, Your Honor."
1990.109_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1196.846,1198.076,It's drying up.
1990.109_orig,0,36277,marian_matthews,,1198.076,1199.057,--It's drying up.
1990.109_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1210.938,1219.342,"So you could use the, if there is floodwater that you're going to store in Ute beyond 200,000 feet, you can use it?"
1990.109_orig,0,36277,marian_matthews,,1219.342,1220.191,Yes.
1990.109_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1249.135,1251.865,"Well, you know, if you don't use it sooner or later it will evaporate."
1990.109_orig,0,36277,marian_matthews,,1251.865,1253.157,"--Well, that's true, Your Honor."
1990.109_orig,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1304.399,1307.301,"Excuse me, before you get off that, it really doesn't say that, though."
1990.109_orig,0,36277,marian_matthews,,1331.64,1334.621,--I don't believe it's a different thing than saying--
1990.109_orig,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1334.621,1337.072,"I mean if they said you can use 200,000 feet, that would be different."
1990.109_orig,0,36277,marian_matthews,,1339.004,1341.857,--I'm not sure we disagree.
1990.109_orig,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1345.83,1347.573,"No, it doesn't say you can store it."
1990.109_orig,0,36277,marian_matthews,,1372.48,1375.542,"Well, this is the point that Oklahoma--"
1990.109_orig,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1375.542,1375.672,Right.
1990.109_orig,0,36277,marian_matthews,,1375.672,1376.544,--and Texas had raised.
1990.109_orig,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1377.084,1380.554,You don't want to get to that now?
1990.109_orig,0,36277,marian_matthews,,1381.415,1383.747,"No, I'd be happy to get to that now."
1990.109_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1422.384,1429.601,You're a strict constructionist as to the first clause of Part (b) and a liberal constructionist as to the second clause.
1990.109_orig,0,36277,marian_matthews,,1429.601,1432.472,"Well, I don't like to look at it that way, Your Honor."
1990.109_orig,1,37856,paul_elliott,,1744.302,1748.045,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.109_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1773.461,1779.365,Does the compact recite that they intend to equitably apportion the waters?
1990.109_orig,1,37856,paul_elliott,,1779.365,1780.417,"--No, it does not."
1990.109_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1783.59,1785.853,"Because that's sort of a term of art in original cases, isn't it?"
1990.109_orig,1,37856,paul_elliott,,1785.853,1787.593,"Yes, sir, it is."
1990.109_orig,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1879.944,1893.634,"I thought their position on that part was more that the compact just wasn't, made no attempt to apportion anything to Colorado, that was to go to, ought to go to Colorado."
1990.109_orig,1,37856,paul_elliott,,1901.18,1904.542,"Well, that's actually, Mr. Chief Justice, a different interpretation."
1990.109_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1969.971,1978.656,"So you say the, you say the water, the overflow water from Conchas, you should say arises below Conchas?"
1990.109_orig,1,37856,paul_elliott,,1978.656,1979.807,"Once it... yes, sir."
1990.109_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1984.862,1988.115,"Although it came from above, it arises below?"
1990.109_orig,1,37856,paul_elliott,,1988.115,1989.825,"--Once it enters into the basin, that's correct."
1990.109_orig,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2087.592,2090.503,"Tucumcari is located in what's called the lower basin, below Conchas?"
1990.109_orig,1,37856,paul_elliott,,2090.503,2091.103,That's correct.
1990.109_orig,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2092.614,2104.654,"Under your theory it has nothing to do with, the compact has nothing to do with what water you get to use, but simply with where you ought to build your reservoirs."
1990.109_orig,1,37856,paul_elliott,,2104.654,2106.925,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1990.109_orig,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2119.293,2124.589,So that New Mexico doesn't have to let anything enter the lower basin?
1990.109_orig,1,37856,paul_elliott,,2124.589,2136.694,"If New Mexico could enlarge Conchas Dam, which they looked into and found it was economically infeasible, that is correct, as Justice White asked earlier."
1990.109_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2138.807,2140.568,The waters arising above.
1990.109_orig,1,37856,paul_elliott,,2140.568,2143.069,"The waters at Conchas Dam, yes, sir."
1990.109_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2157.511,2161.412,And floods were rare.
1990.109_orig,1,37856,paul_elliott,,2161.412,2163.842,The floods were infrequent.
1990.109_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2235.865,2241.77,"So what, what percentage of the water, of the storage in, what is it, Lake Meredith?"
1990.109_orig,1,37856,paul_elliott,,2241.77,2243.269,Lake Meredith is in Texas.
1990.109_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2243.269,2250.353,"What percentage of storage there comes from the Canadian, or comes from New Mexico, put it that way?"
1990.109_orig,1,37856,paul_elliott,,2250.353,2251.315,Roughly half.
1990.109_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2251.315,2252.244,Roughly half.
1990.109_orig,1,37856,paul_elliott,,2252.244,2252.675,Right.
1990.109_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2252.675,2258.762,"And of course there are a lot of other, a lot of tributaries flow into the Canadian below Ute."
1990.109_orig,1,37856,paul_elliott,,2258.762,2263.163,There are some fairly major tributaries that come in below Ute.
1990.109_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2272.58,2276.784,What other water besides the Canadian services Meredith?
1990.109_orig,1,37856,paul_elliott,,2276.784,2283.72,"Just the Canadian and tributaries that are below the project, below Ute and below the Texas state line."
1990.109_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2283.72,2289.061,"There are no, no other streams that flow directly into Meredith?"
1990.109_orig,1,37856,paul_elliott,,2289.061,2289.532,That's correct.
1990.109_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2290.884,2294.737,What's the capacity of Meredith?
1990.109_orig,1,37856,paul_elliott,,2294.737,2297.81,"The capacity is 1,400,000."
1990.109_orig,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2322.225,2332.732,"What city in Texas is the furthest away from the dam of the 11 cities that get the water, in order of magnitude?"
1990.109_orig,1,37856,paul_elliott,,2334.663,2337.056,--Lubbock is one of the first cities.
1990.109_orig,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2341.791,2344.011,So you're talking about a couple hundred miles possibly?
1990.109_orig,1,37856,paul_elliott,,2344.011,2353.268,"--They are serviced off a canal primarily that runs from Lake Meredith, it goes south and then services several cities as it moves south."
1990.109_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2408.046,2412.459,"But you don't question their right to keep 200,000 acre-feet there, do you?"
1990.109_orig,1,37856,paul_elliott,,2412.459,2413.829,--Absolutely not.
1990.109_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2415.6,2420.112,"You're just, you're mostly fighting over floodwaters?"
1990.109_orig,1,37856,paul_elliott,,2420.112,2424.835,"--The floodwaters in '87 triggered this, and of course--"
1990.109_orig,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2424.835,2433.843,"Well, floodwaters which I guess you concede they could capture at least at Conchas if they increase that capacity?"
1990.109_orig,1,37856,paul_elliott,,2433.843,2434.753,"--That's correct, they could."
1990.109_orig,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2434.753,2440.987,So New Mexico has the right and the means ultimately to keep all that water.
1990.109_orig,1,37856,paul_elliott,,2440.987,2444.451,"Well, as a practical matter they found that they can't do it."
1990.109_orig,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2454.649,2454.899,Right.
1990.109_orig,1,37856,paul_elliott,,2456.872,2458.092,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1990.109_orig,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2458.092,2466.977,"And I take it from the earlier part of your argument that the Sanford Reservoir, the Sanford Project was planned without regard to floodwaters?"
1990.109_orig,1,37856,paul_elliott,,2466.977,2469.0,No.
1990.109_orig,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2483.612,2489.496,Does the history show that in planning for the feasibility of the project they depended on floodwaters?
1990.109_orig,1,37856,paul_elliott,,2489.496,2491.637,They used the floodwaters.
1990.109_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2562.406,2566.577,Have they made any claim in this case that they are entitled to those waters?
1990.109_orig,1,37856,paul_elliott,,2566.577,2567.999,--They have claimed that they are entitled to them.
1990.109_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2574.224,2576.707,It would cost them more than it's worth?
1990.109_orig,1,37856,paul_elliott,,2576.707,2579.98,"--Well, and there would certainly be a battle over it because it would be extremely subjective."
1990.109_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2579.98,2582.762,So as a practical matter we're just talking about the floodwaters?
1990.109_orig,1,37856,paul_elliott,,2582.762,2585.875,That's what this fight is over.
1990.109_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2653.072,2666.221,"You don't say there's any, it's really very... that it's impractical, is it, to measure the floodwaters, the amount of water that flows over the Conchas Dam?"
1990.109_orig,1,37856,paul_elliott,,2667.362,2675.507,"--In 1972 the gauge below Conchas was discontinued, and there really is not any flow measurement of the water below Conchas."
1990.109_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2675.507,2678.079,"Well, I know there may not be, but it wouldn't be easy to, it wouldn't be hard to have it."
1990.109_orig,1,37856,paul_elliott,,2678.079,2681.822,"There could be a new gauge installed, I suppose."
1990.109_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2681.822,2684.173,"Well, yeah, and it wouldn't cost a fortune either, would it?"
1990.109_orig,1,37856,paul_elliott,,2684.173,2686.123,"The gauge itself would not, no."
1990.109_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2686.123,2686.644,"Yeah, all right."
1990.109_orig,1,37856,paul_elliott,,2686.644,2692.678,But there would still have to be an accounting for what happened to that water after it passed the gauge--
1990.109_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2692.678,2692.899,That's right.
1990.109_orig,1,37856,paul_elliott,,2692.899,2695.072,--in terms of losses and evaporation.
1990.109_orig,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2706.962,2714.486,"How many miles does the river travel between Conchas and Ute, approximately?"
1990.109_orig,1,37856,paul_elliott,,2714.486,2716.676,In river miles--
1990.109_orig,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2716.676,2716.977,River miles.
1990.109_orig,1,37856,paul_elliott,,2716.977,2717.477,--River miles?
1990.109_orig,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2832.774,2850.244,"Mr. Elliott, how do you respond to the argument that you can't really compute a capacity that precisely, 200,000, and also that it keeps changing as it silts up, and it's so exorbitantly expensive to increase the capacity that it's not reasonable to think that that's what they bargained about?"
1990.109_orig,1,37856,paul_elliott,,2850.244,2859.22,"We believe that there are some practical implications of limiting the, their right to a capacity limitation."
1990.109_orig,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2900.026,2902.398,"Thank you, Mr. Elliott."
1990.109_orig,2,39799,r_thomas_lay,,2904.641,2912.856,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.109_orig,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2970.634,2972.557,It doesn't use the word capacity.
1990.109_orig,2,39799,r_thomas_lay,,2982.236,2982.795,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1990.109_orig,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3020.786,3028.421,"Wouldn't that present some very difficult problems of measurement, if you have all those different kinds of storage behind the same dam undifferentiated?"
1990.109_orig,2,39799,r_thomas_lay,,3028.421,3034.037,"Mr. Chief Justice, as we understand it, it's not, and again it gets into an engineering question."
1990.109_orig,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3059.474,3064.59,But Oklahoma's position is not that its interpretation limits the size of the structure?
1990.109_orig,2,39799,r_thomas_lay,,3064.59,3066.65,Not the total size of the structure.
1990.109_orig,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3070.613,3075.957,But can you say that any one part of a structure like a dam relates to conservation storage?
1990.109_orig,2,39799,r_thomas_lay,,3075.957,3083.623,"I think we can, Your Honor, and I think as developed in this case, the way it turns out is that at Ute Reservoir at a given elevation you have outlet works."
1990.109_orig,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3105.621,3115.709,"Well, do you determine it by the actual use that is made from time to time, or the intent with which it was stored, or the design, the design features of the dam, or all three?"
1990.109_orig,2,39799,r_thomas_lay,,3115.709,3119.081,"Justice Kennedy, I think all three may come into play."
1990.109_orig,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3136.107,3147.554,Do you cite some treatises or some history where the term conservation storage is contrasted and compared with other types of storage?
1990.109_orig,2,39799,r_thomas_lay,,3147.554,3150.566,"--Your Honor, off the top of my tongue I cannot cite you a treatise."
1990.109_orig,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3174.793,3178.146,How do you administer it on your theory?
1990.109_orig,2,39799,r_thomas_lay,,3207.057,3230.962,"I think under our theory, Justice Souter, it is simply that once New Mexico has conservation storage capacity in excess of 200,000 acre-feet, that capacity, that excess water that might be represented in that excess capacity is required to be released to the downstream states, because the extent of the stream flow depletion by New Mexico was clearly intended to be limited to 200,000 acre-feet."
1990.109_orig,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3230.962,3241.36,"You might let them... I take it on your theory it would be, it would be consistent with the compact if they in good faith said well, we want to raise the water level three more feet for recreational purposes."
1990.109_orig,2,39799,r_thomas_lay,,3253.248,3253.949,That is our theory.
1990.109_orig,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3254.72,3254.861,Okay.
1990.109_orig,2,39799,r_thomas_lay,,3254.861,3256.353,"And to clarify, we certainly--"
1990.109_orig,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3256.353,3259.305,"What if they say okay, we're going to add on another four feet for recreation?"
1990.109_orig,2,39799,r_thomas_lay,,3262.718,3270.164,"--Justice Scalia, we have interpreted recreation use as being a consumptive use under the compact."
1990.109_orig,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3295.298,3299.813,"So you, so there's no such thing as conservation storage, then, you're saying, right?"
1990.109_orig,2,39799,r_thomas_lay,,3304.598,3306.758,"That would be a correct analogy with what I'm saying, Your Honor."
1990.109_orig,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3316.968,3320.681,"Well then let me go back to my question, because I don't think I understood, or I may have misled you."
1990.109_orig,2,39799,r_thomas_lay,,3343.077,3351.893,"If I may clarify, Your Honor, they can only store 200,000 acre-feet for what are deemed to be conservation storage uses and purposes."
1990.109_orig,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3351.893,3357.376,But I thought your answer to Justice Scalia's question was that they couldn't store anything more for any other purpose.
1990.109_orig,2,39799,r_thomas_lay,,3364.29,3369.364,They could not increase their storage capacity for conservation purposes.
1990.109_orig,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3410.87,3421.017,"Well, I suspect that sediment control requires that the water sit there and not be released, and that's another exception to the storage."
1990.109_orig,2,39799,r_thomas_lay,,3421.017,3422.688,"That is correct, Justice O'Connor."
1990.109_orig,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3425.67,3425.82,Right.
1990.109_orig,2,39799,r_thomas_lay,,3425.82,3427.322,"--and not chargeable against the 200,000."
1990.109_orig,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3427.322,3430.044,"And not chargeable against the 200,000."
1990.109_orig,2,39799,r_thomas_lay,,3435.107,3435.758,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1990.109_orig,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3436.799,3452.808,"Would it be too crude to say, then, to summarize what you have said, that the capacity can be increased for any purpose which is realized ultimately by releasing the water over the dam?"
1990.109_orig,2,39799,r_thomas_lay,,3452.808,3455.76,"I think that is consistent with the theory, Justice Souter."
1990.109_orig,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3455.76,3455.9,Okay.
1990.109_orig,2,39799,r_thomas_lay,,3455.9,3457.993,"Again, I would want to articulate and qualify it."
1990.109_orig,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3468.298,3477.977,"Each of those capacities, as I understand you to have described them, requires by its very nature the release of the water?"
1990.109_orig,2,39799,r_thomas_lay,,3477.977,3478.407,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1990.109_orig,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3478.407,3482.076,"Well, you just said sediment control did not require release."
1990.109_orig,2,39799,r_thomas_lay,,3483.358,3485.269,"Your Honor, that... may I finish my answer, Your Honor?"
1990.109_orig,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3485.269,3485.46,"Yes, you may."
1990.109_orig,2,39799,r_thomas_lay,,3485.46,3487.65,"Yes, Your Honor, that is correct."
1990.109_orig,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3497.497,3499.36,"Thank you, Mr. Lay."
1990.109_orig,2,39799,r_thomas_lay,,3499.36,3499.61,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1990.109_orig,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3499.61,3500.39,The case is submitted.
