1975.74-206,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,29.598,"We will hear arguments next in 74-206, Thermtron Products against Hermansdorfer."
1975.74-206,0,23823,frank_g_dickey_jr,,32.842,36.276,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1975.74-206,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,109.756,124.744,Where do we get any authority at all in view of 1447(d) that says an order of remanding a case to a State Court pursuant to that was removed pursuant to Section 1443 shall not be reviewable by appeal or otherwise?
1975.74-206,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,124.744,129.228,And in connection with that I think it did not cite 1447(d) at all.
1975.74-206,0,23823,frank_g_dickey_jr,,130.574,135.613,"If Your Honor please, 1447(d) says exactly that."
1975.74-206,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,166.704,190.573,"Why is it not just as possible to say that what 1447(d) contemplates is that Congress rather deliberately chose to avoid the danger of delay that would come from appealing an order of remand, even though that order was erroneous rather than to make sure that an erroneous order of remand was straightened out by the Court of Appeals every time."
1975.74-206,0,23823,frank_g_dickey_jr,,190.573,203.971,"Mr. Justice Rehnquist, I would agree that Congress did intend not to burden the Circuit Courts of Appeals with review of every order of remand that came along."
1975.74-206,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,305.316,310.514,Would that not come up on the appeal from the final judgment?
1975.74-206,0,23823,frank_g_dickey_jr,,310.514,365.128,"Mr. Justice Blackmun, if my memory serves me correctly, there are cases which say that even if the order of remand in a case where there is no jurisdiction and the case goes back to State Court and is tried and comes, in this case, to the Court of Appeals for the Commonwealth of Kentucky, that this Court I believe would say and has stated or at least the Sixth Circuit has stated that that order of remand is not reviewable under Section 1447(d) for the simple reason that that order of remand in that particular case was made because the Court obviously did not have jurisdiction and to hold otherwise, would create a volume of appeals."
1975.74-206,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,389.53,395.17,"Well, Congress certainly choose that unfortunate language in 1447(d), did it not?"
1975.74-206,0,23823,frank_g_dickey_jr,,395.17,406.263,"In this particular instance and under these facts, yes sir they did, because in this case, the facts in record herein are decisive."
1975.74-206,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,482.039,500.342,"Do you know -- to the other, some 28 actions which this judge remanded similar to this diversity action or they are just sitting there in the State Court or what has happened to them?"
1975.74-206,0,23823,frank_g_dickey_jr,,500.342,511.063,"Mr. Justice Blackmun, I believe that reference is made in the petitioner's petition for writ of mandamus to the Sixth Circuit."
1975.74-206,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,511.063,513.902,"Page 26 of the appendix, I just want to --?"
1975.74-206,0,23823,frank_g_dickey_jr,,513.902,545.257,"That reference was made upon information to counsel for the petitioners and even though it is not in the record, I would have to advise the Court that I have subsequently been advised that 14 cases, I believe is the correct number which consists of all of those cases which were removed during the year 1973 from the Pike Circuit Court to United States District Court."
1975.74-206,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,634.474,649.118,"It has long been recognized, has it not, that constitutional provision is subject to the terms and conditions for diversity jurisdiction that Congress might specify?"
1975.74-206,0,23823,frank_g_dickey_jr,,649.118,652.095,"Yes, Your Honor it is, since 1789."
1975.74-206,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,652.095,671.705,"Congress has specified, you say that a case such as yours, is clearly removable by your client to the District Court and Congress has further specified that an order of a District Judge remanding a case that has been sought to be removed is unreviewable by any Court."
1975.74-206,0,23823,frank_g_dickey_jr,,675.963,688.237,Those are the terms and conditions to the extent that it contemplates that an order of remand will not be entered unless the case is removed improvidently and without jurisdiction.
1975.74-206,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,688.237,710.826,"Well, the District Judge has told that, but assume you are quite right that the District Judge was acting quite erroneously when he remanded this, but Congress has simply said that one of the terms and conditions of diversity jurisdiction is that the action of the District Judge, however erroneous it may be, is unreviewable?"
1975.74-206,0,23823,frank_g_dickey_jr,,710.826,717.03,"If Your Honor please, I think that is what the language of Section 1447(d) --"
1975.74-206,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,717.03,717.425,It seems to say --
1975.74-206,0,23823,frank_g_dickey_jr,,717.425,718.677,Exactly.
1975.74-206,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,738.249,740.575,That is what the -- that what seems to be said?
1975.74-206,0,23823,frank_g_dickey_jr,,740.575,741.686,And I would submit to the Congress --
1975.74-206,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,741.686,743.503,"What Congress seems to have said, is it not?"
1975.74-206,0,23823,frank_g_dickey_jr,,743.503,744.012,And I would submit --
1975.74-206,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,744.012,748.71,"And that is one of the limitations on diversity jurisdiction, is it not?"
1975.74-206,0,23823,frank_g_dickey_jr,,748.71,792.44,"If that is what that says and if that is what Congress intended which I submit that is not, singularly any District Court Judge in this entire country could arbitrarily, discretionarily upon mere whim say to any removing defendant, I do not like your case, I am too busy, I do not like this party and even though that party has a statutory right of removal, granted by Congress, he would have no remedy whatsoever from action on behalf of a District Court Judge?"
1975.74-206,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,792.44,792.904,Mr. Dickey --
1975.74-206,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,792.904,795.523,"The statute does say, is it not?"
1975.74-206,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,795.523,807.666,"For the first hundred years in this country that there were trials in the Federal Courts for criminal offenses, there was no appeal whatever beyond the District Court until 1889."
1975.74-206,0,23823,frank_g_dickey_jr,,848.338,887.573,"Mr. Justice Rehnquist, I would submit to this Court that this Court does have inherent authority over all Lower Federal Courts, over all District Court Judges in fact, where there is such a flagrant denial of a defendant’s right of removal and denial of a statutory right, that there must be some extraordinary remedy and this Court does have the inherent jurisdiction or the inherent authority to discipline Lower Court Judges --"
1975.74-206,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,887.573,892.903,"Does that mean, it is not reviewable language right out of the statute?"
1975.74-206,0,23823,frank_g_dickey_jr,,892.903,901.552,"As I pointed out before Mr. Chief Justice, it does read exactly that way, but obviously it was not contemplated by Congress to mean that."
1975.74-206,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,944.262,948.086,Did the statute not read differently then than it does now?
1975.74-206,0,23823,frank_g_dickey_jr,,948.086,999.546,"If Your Honor please, that was under Section 28 of the Judicial Code and at that particular time, there was also the same language as in Section 1447(d) forbidding review of an order of remand in a case such as the one that was taken to the Fourth Circuit and in that case the Fourth Circuit stated that leave would be granted to the defendant in that case to file a petition for writ of mandamus, requiring the Court below to hear and determine the case and the Court further stated that it will probably not be necessary for the defendant to file such petition as the learned judge may of his own motion vacate the order, remanding the case and proceed to hear and decide it."
1975.74-206,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1053.332,1071.513,"As has been suggested to you, every element of reviewability is a creature of Congress, it is a result of Congress defining it, so you have to point to specific statute, do you not, to use jurisdiction to review?"
1975.74-206,0,23823,frank_g_dickey_jr,,1079.452,1094.92,"If Your Honor please, I think that to deny a review of a decision such as this would squarely fall within in the concept of the constitution and deny the petitioner’s due process law."
1975.74-206,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1140.419,1154.579,I suppose what you are saying is that this decision below opens a way for the Federal Judiciary country-wide to do away independently with diversity jurisdiction?
1975.74-206,0,23823,frank_g_dickey_jr,,1154.579,1167.966,"Mr. Justice Blackmun, if I had to look into the mind of Judge Hermansdorfer, which I obviously cannot do, I would say that this was the intent of his order of remand."
1975.74-206,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1167.966,1176.001,"This is the responsibility, is it not, for every Federal Judge to follow his example and just clear their calendars of diversity cases?"
1975.74-206,0,23823,frank_g_dickey_jr,,1176.001,1178.516,It would certainly be unless this Court --
1975.74-206,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1178.516,1182.634,And only remove -- of diversity cases –-
1975.74-206,0,23823,frank_g_dickey_jr,,1182.634,1211.071,"If Your Honor please, I think if the order of remand in this particular case is permitted to stand, this Court is going to have to legislate judicially which is an area which is completely within the realm of Congress and this Court would also have to eliminate original diversity jurisdiction as well as removal."
1975.74-206,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1234.275,1241.441,"Mr. Dickey, Congress could remedy and stop this with just one stroke of (Inaudible) --"
1975.74-206,0,23823,frank_g_dickey_jr,,1241.441,1242.179,If Your Honor please --
1975.74-206,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1242.179,1246.19,Just take the word “mandate” out of their provision?
1975.74-206,0,23823,frank_g_dickey_jr,,1246.19,1247.508,"Well, I think that what Congress --"
1975.74-206,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1247.508,1248.985,Right?
1975.74-206,0,23823,frank_g_dickey_jr,,1249.385,1250.582,Yes sir.
1975.74-206,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1263.75,1288.875,"Is not the substance of your argument that we ought not comes to 1447(d) as literally written, but as limited in application to cases you regularly sent back under the 1447(c) on some reason that might be error?"
1975.74-206,0,23823,frank_g_dickey_jr,,1298.04,1303.296,That is entirely correct Your Honor.
1975.74-206,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1303.296,1319.179,"It is kind of odd to say that it is not reviewable with even though erroneous, unless the error is serious, what sort of a doctrine is that?"
1975.74-206,0,23823,frank_g_dickey_jr,,1319.179,1330.653,"Well, if Your Honor please, the 1447(d) says that an order remanding a case is not reviewable on appeal or otherwise."
1975.74-206,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1330.653,1332.436,Yes.
1975.74-206,0,23823,frank_g_dickey_jr,,1332.436,1341.502,"Otherwise, under the cases which have been interpreted before means by any remedy or by any means?"
1975.74-206,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1367.005,1369.875,"Well, that is what you always say on appeal or on mandamus."
1975.74-206,0,23823,frank_g_dickey_jr,,1392.674,1407.548,What I am saying is Mr. Justice Stewart that this Court has the inherent authority to discipline District Court Judges as far as administrative matters are concerned and this is an administrative matter.
1975.74-206,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1407.548,1408.654,Where do we get that?
1975.74-206,0,23823,frank_g_dickey_jr,,1424.523,1436.359,This Court has the authority to control the dockets and where an attempt is made to deny the petitioner’s statutory right of removal --
1975.74-206,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1436.359,1456.424,"You might be on solid ground if you argued that Section 332 Title XVIII gives Council of the Circuit that kind of authority, but where do you find the counterpart statute to Section 332 vesting this Court with such authority?"
1975.74-206,0,23823,frank_g_dickey_jr,,1456.424,1467.109,I feel that this Court could probably order under that particular statute the implementation of the relief sought by the petitioners in this case.
1975.74-206,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1467.109,1470.473,But we are not the Judicial Council.
1975.74-206,0,23823,frank_g_dickey_jr,,1477.242,1485.22,"Well, that particular Judicial Council has been notified as indicated in the memorandum opinion of the --"
1975.74-206,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1485.22,1495.026,"I gather that the Sixth Circuit was concerned about what the judge had done and was going to try that perhaps set them straight informally, that does not help you either?"
1975.74-206,0,23823,frank_g_dickey_jr,,1495.026,1496.47,That does not help me a bit.
1975.74-206,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1629.155,1656.161,"Mr. Dickey, looking through this Fourth Circuit Case that you cited a moment ago, the Traveler’s Protective Association case in 1934, the statute then apparently read that an order of remand shall be carried into exertion and no appeal or writ of error from the decision of the District Court, so remanding the cause shall be allowed."
1975.74-206,0,23823,frank_g_dickey_jr,,1680.495,1687.05,"Well, the way I had read that Mr. Justice Rehnquist was that it read the same."
1975.74-206,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1705.429,1709.071,But the Fourth Circuit said differently certainly.
1975.74-206,0,23823,frank_g_dickey_jr,,1716.732,1721.25,But without being fictitious may be otherwise does not include mandamus.
1975.74-206,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1732.785,1736.873,Mr. Combs?
1975.74-206,1,18716,c_kilmer_combs,,1736.873,1745.828,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1975.74-206,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1870.335,1871.833,May I ask Mr. Combs?
1975.74-206,1,18716,c_kilmer_combs,,1871.833,1872.261,Yes sir.
1975.74-206,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1872.261,1884.347,Whether then on his docket any Federal Employer's Liability Act cases or Jones Act Cases that had been brought into Kentucky Courts?
1975.74-206,1,18716,c_kilmer_combs,,1884.347,1886.284,That is brought to this Court?
1975.74-206,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1886.284,1889.693,Yes or removed to this Court?
1975.74-206,1,18716,c_kilmer_combs,,1889.693,1891.605,I cannot answer that question Your Honor.
1975.74-206,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1891.605,1904.402,"Because I gather the Federal question cases such as those pending on the State Courts which were also removable might have been included in the remand, might they not?"
1975.74-206,1,18716,c_kilmer_combs,,1904.402,1906.37,"They could have Your Honor, I am not aware."
1975.74-206,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1906.37,1908.565,Even though they are Federal question cases?
1975.74-206,1,18716,c_kilmer_combs,,1908.565,1910.008,Yes.
1975.74-206,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1911.411,1922.003,"There are other types of Federal question cases besides Federal Employer's Liability and Jones Act cases, are there not, that might also be removed?"
1975.74-206,1,18716,c_kilmer_combs,,1922.003,1923.746,I would think there are.
1975.74-206,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1926.208,1927.209,Yes.
1975.74-206,1,18716,c_kilmer_combs,,1927.209,1928.587,But in any event --
1975.74-206,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1928.587,1946.294,Will you not have in the Sixth Circuit pressures as other Circuits have to get all cases tried and off the docket and given priority to bring in visiting judges from other places to help clear up these old cases?
1975.74-206,1,18716,c_kilmer_combs,,1946.294,1949.129,We have those pressures Your Honor.
1975.74-206,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1983.83,1990.327,I am just suggesting that there are other ways to clear a calendar than to (Voice Overlap)?
1975.74-206,1,18716,c_kilmer_combs,,1990.327,1992.405,There are.
1975.74-206,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2014.912,2018.039,"By state issues, you mean issues of state law?"
1975.74-206,1,18716,c_kilmer_combs,,2018.039,2022.107,"Issues of State Law involving state occurrences, Your Honor."
1975.74-206,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2022.107,2025.833,Did you not say that he exercised his discretion?
1975.74-206,1,18716,c_kilmer_combs,,2025.833,2026.603,"Yes, I did."
1975.74-206,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2026.603,2029.304,Where did he get the discretion?
1975.74-206,1,18716,c_kilmer_combs,,2029.304,2029.725,He gets that –-
1975.74-206,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2029.725,2033.887,Is that not really the point is whether he did have any discretion?
1975.74-206,1,18716,c_kilmer_combs,,2033.887,2034.299,This –-
1975.74-206,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2034.299,2035.229,Does that not support?
1975.74-206,1,18716,c_kilmer_combs,,2035.229,2038.441,This is the real issue.
1975.74-206,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2038.441,2040.394,You assume he had it.
1975.74-206,1,18716,c_kilmer_combs,,2040.394,2046.841,"Well, I hope I can demonstrate it Your Honor and if I may I will try to do it right now."
1975.74-206,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2125.36,2129.016,Why that should be improvident?
1975.74-206,1,18716,c_kilmer_combs,,2129.016,2133.322,Improvident as I understand the word --
1975.74-206,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2133.322,2142.437,"As I understand in this case if he had less cases on his docket, it would have not been remanded, am I right?"
1975.74-206,1,18716,c_kilmer_combs,,2142.437,2143.71,"No, Your Honor."
1975.74-206,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2143.71,2147.15,"Well, what is the reason because he had too many cases?"
1975.74-206,1,18716,c_kilmer_combs,,2147.15,2153.791,"Well, that has nothing to do with the improvident removal as I understand it and as I concede."
1975.74-206,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2172.13,2173.617,(Inaudible)
1975.74-206,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2173.617,2188.614,"But the right to remove, is that qualified in some way or is it an absolute right on the part of the litigants, the litigant claiming diversity?"
1975.74-206,1,18716,c_kilmer_combs,,2188.614,2196.377,"In my view and as I hopefully, correctly understand the intent of the Congress, it is a qualified right."
1975.74-206,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2220.061,2227.965,I could understand that better if the statute said improvidently or without jurisdiction?
1975.74-206,1,18716,c_kilmer_combs,,2227.965,2231.38,"I had the same problem Your Honor, but then --"
1975.74-206,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2231.38,2236.316,It is about all diversity cases in the country?
1975.74-206,1,18716,c_kilmer_combs,,2236.316,2241.482,"All removal diversity, of course there is no remand to --"
1975.74-206,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2241.482,2244.445,That would interfere with quite a few motions?
1975.74-206,1,18716,c_kilmer_combs,,2244.445,2247.174,Well –-
1975.74-206,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2247.174,2250.082,Just to accommodate one court they --
1975.74-206,1,18716,c_kilmer_combs,,2250.082,2252.605,Be it as it may.
1975.74-206,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2252.605,2257.383,"I know you get some judges to agree with you, but it would though?"
1975.74-206,1,18716,c_kilmer_combs,,2257.383,2258.511,Well --
1975.74-206,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2258.511,2265.379,"I understand that once the case is remanded, that is it and the only way you can do it is on jurisdiction."
1975.74-206,1,18716,c_kilmer_combs,,2271.524,2274.641,"Now, getting back to --"
1975.74-206,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2274.641,2283.281,"Just to maintain the interruption here, had you -- then your -- this case originally in the Federal Court it could not be remanded?"
1975.74-206,1,18716,c_kilmer_combs,,2283.281,2285.153,"No, Your Honor it could not be dismissed."
1975.74-206,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2285.153,2289.286,Even though the same considerations might under into Judge Hermansdorfer's mind?
1975.74-206,1,18716,c_kilmer_combs,,2289.286,2294.022,"Yes, Your Honor."
1975.74-206,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2364.367,2368.851,"Why do we say “and,” I could take or and come out the same way."
1975.74-206,1,18716,c_kilmer_combs,,2375.451,2376.886,I have no case Your Honor.
1975.74-206,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2376.886,2380.95,I did not think you did.
1975.74-206,1,18716,c_kilmer_combs,,2380.95,2381.867,But in all –-
1975.74-206,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2381.867,2384.51,This is brand new?
1975.74-206,1,18716,c_kilmer_combs,,2384.51,2406.606,"To my knowledge, it is, but I will say that it sounds at least in my mind that this hearing -- now in one case where I believe it was a jurisdictional question in this Court."
1975.74-206,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2504.4,2509.417,"Of course, there were no hearing on that to hear, was there?"
1975.74-206,1,18716,c_kilmer_combs,,2509.417,2513.327,"Yes, it was Your Honor and I want to defend Judge Hermansdorfer on that."
1975.74-206,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2559.352,2570.551,"But supposing in Kentucky, your Federal Jury is chosen from a larger geographical area than the State Court Jury, is it not?"
1975.74-206,1,18716,c_kilmer_combs,,2570.551,2587.816,"Yes, Your Honor and that the Eastern District is divided up into divisions and not statutory, but divisions nevertheless and they do come from all let us say, five or six or seven counties instead of just a one."
1975.74-206,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2587.816,2591.143,You said seven different places --?
1975.74-206,1,18716,c_kilmer_combs,,2591.143,2593.005,"Yes, Your Honor."
1975.74-206,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2632.142,2635.731,That is not really an issuer here.
1975.74-206,1,18716,c_kilmer_combs,,2641.348,2643.383,I would say you could not Your Honor.
1975.74-206,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2675.615,2682.787,"Of course, the defendant’s right to remove is not conditioned on a showing of prejudice in an individual case, is it not?"
1975.74-206,1,18716,c_kilmer_combs,,2682.787,2692.349,"No, it is not, but I suggest that it arises Your Honor on remand or improvident removal."
1975.74-206,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2732.271,2736.364,"The statute does not say impartial tribunal, does it?"
1975.74-206,1,18716,c_kilmer_combs,,2736.364,2738.023,"No sir, it is improvidence."
1975.74-206,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2738.216,2748.325,The statute does not say that you have to give an impartial tribunal that is why you remove and do not say a word about that because it just says removal?
1975.74-206,1,18716,c_kilmer_combs,,2748.325,2762.815,"But if I recall correctly, Your Honor, this Court has construed that as being the purpose of the removal statute."
1975.74-206,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2762.815,2767.477,"What is the purpose, when it was passed it did not have a little while?"
1975.74-206,1,18716,c_kilmer_combs,,2779.318,2781.231,I do not want to throw him out.
1975.74-206,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2781.231,2785.987,"But you do, unless you want to exception for your district?"
1975.74-206,1,18716,c_kilmer_combs,,2785.987,2786.8,I want to give --
1975.74-206,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2786.8,2788.522,And we cannot do that.
1975.74-206,1,18716,c_kilmer_combs,,2788.522,2804.358,"I want to give the District Judge in every District the discretion and I would agree that it must be carefully, wisely and soundly exercised to remand whether it is a improvident removal --"
1975.74-206,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2804.358,2805.838,In each case?
1975.74-206,1,18716,c_kilmer_combs,,2805.838,2811.473,In each case upon his suggestion or upon the suggestion of the parties.
1975.74-206,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2811.473,2822.263,"(Inaudible) the amount of judicial time spent if you had a hearing on each case that would cut down judicial time, is that what you are saying?"
1975.74-206,1,18716,c_kilmer_combs,,2822.263,2826.176,"No, I am not suggesting it as an administrative matter at all, Your Honor."
1975.74-206,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2826.176,2830.655,His basis it is that this judge is overloaded?
1975.74-206,1,18716,c_kilmer_combs,,2830.655,2837.331,His response in the Sixth Circuit indicates that it is on the same basis that I am arguing now.
1975.74-206,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2843.565,2850.911,"Mr. Combs, this is not the issue that is before us at all, is it?"
1975.74-206,1,18716,c_kilmer_combs,,2866.903,2877.071,"Well, certainly as I see it, that is an issue just as well as the reviewability."
1975.74-206,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2885.384,2889.28,"That was not at all the basis of the Court of Appeals decision, was it?"
1975.74-206,1,18716,c_kilmer_combs,,2889.28,2900.596,"No, it was not, Your Honor, but as noted by counsel they handled the thing as administrative matter."
1975.74-206,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2918.927,2924.838,"You have not a single, that is not what the statute says and that is not what any other case has ever held, is it?"
1975.74-206,1,18716,c_kilmer_combs,,2924.838,2925.473,"No, it is not."
1975.74-206,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2925.473,2929.576,That is not issue before this Court.
1975.74-206,1,18716,c_kilmer_combs,,2938.744,2943.959,"Well, by the same token, I have no authority that says it is reviewable."
1975.74-206,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2945.107,2949.311,"Yes, a very strong authority, that says it is not, and that is an act of Congress."
1975.74-206,1,18716,c_kilmer_combs,,2949.311,2950.593,"Yes, I do Your Honor."
1975.74-206,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2950.593,2956.365,That is what is before us whether or not that act of Congress means what it seems to say?
1975.74-206,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2956.365,2974.817,"You could concede that Judge Hermansdorfer’s action was in itself improvident, imprudent and unauthorized and yet stand on the statute that Justice Stewart has just referred to which says that even if that is true, no Court can reveal it."
1975.74-206,1,18716,c_kilmer_combs,,2979.823,2989.903,"Well, certainly that is the heart of it because if that be true, then that is the end of the case."
1975.74-206,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2989.903,3004.094,"Maybe you feel like we are more likely to decide that it is reviewable, if we feel that is grossly wrong and if we feel less that is grossly wrong, we are less likely to find it reviewable?"
1975.74-206,2,23823,frank_g_dickey_jr,,3284.1,3288.684,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1975.74-206,3,18716,c_kilmer_combs,,3345.049,3348.509,Oh! I agree wholeheartedly Your Honor.
1975.74-206,4,23823,frank_g_dickey_jr,,3348.509,3351.365,That does not have to be diversity?
1975.74-206,5,18716,c_kilmer_combs,,3351.365,3356.79,That is true.
1975.74-206,5,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3404.278,3405.028,Thank you gentlemen.
