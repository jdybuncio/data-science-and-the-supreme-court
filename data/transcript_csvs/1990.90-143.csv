1990.90-143,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.158,"We'll hear argument first this morning in No. 90-143, Connecticut and John F. DiGiovanni v. Brian K. Doehr."
1990.90-143,0,26670,henry_s_cohn,,12.069,14.89,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.90-143,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,63.823,64.394,I'm not sure I--
1990.90-143,0,26670,henry_s_cohn,,73.978,97.176,"--Yes, Your Honor, the evidence before the court was limited, and therefore matters such as the effect on the debtor and the length of time it takes to obtain a hearing, the post... the immediate post-seizure hearing, things of that nature, were not developed in the district court."
1990.90-143,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,115.845,117.798,No evidence was taken in the trial court?
1990.90-143,0,26670,henry_s_cohn,,117.798,123.683,"No, there were two facts presented in the trial court on summary judgment."
1990.90-143,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,154.441,157.443,"Well, it was applied in this case, was it not?"
1990.90-143,0,26670,henry_s_cohn,,165.599,166.53,Yes.
1990.90-143,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,168.453,168.81,For these litigants.
1990.90-143,0,26670,henry_s_cohn,,175.406,176.157,Well--
1990.90-143,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,176.157,184.28,This is... it has been applied in this case to these parties.
1990.90-143,0,26670,henry_s_cohn,,184.28,195.087,"--It was applied to these parties, but the case that came before the district court was not based upon the factual--"
1990.90-143,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,195.087,197.01,"Well, summary judgment was granted."
1990.90-143,0,26670,henry_s_cohn,,197.01,198.189,--That's right.
1990.90-143,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,208.928,213.15,"As long as you're... interrupted me, I asked you one thing about the statute."
1990.90-143,0,26670,henry_s_cohn,,225.407,226.469,"Yes, it is, Your Honor."
1990.90-143,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,256.12,262.794,"Well, is the notice given at the time the complaint is served to start the lawsuit, or is there some other notice given?"
1990.90-143,0,26670,henry_s_cohn,,262.794,264.527,It's at the time a complaint is served.
1990.90-143,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,264.527,267.878,So that could be a 90-day period?
1990.90-143,0,26670,henry_s_cohn,,267.878,269.188,The 90-day--
1990.90-143,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,269.188,278.195,"Meaning technically someone could go in and get the lien, and then have it in existence and serve the complaint 90 days later?"
1990.90-143,0,26670,henry_s_cohn,,278.195,279.924,--Technically speaking that is true.
1990.90-143,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,292.293,296.818,Do we know in this case whether a notice was received right away?
1990.90-143,0,26670,henry_s_cohn,,296.818,297.757,"Oh, yes, absolutely."
1990.90-143,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,330.378,336.282,You say in this particular case notice was served immediately upon the debtor?
1990.90-143,0,26670,henry_s_cohn,,336.282,337.033,"Yes, Your Honor."
1990.90-143,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,360.889,365.34,Does Connecticut have a lis pendens scheme--
1990.90-143,0,26670,henry_s_cohn,,365.34,365.63,"Oh, yes, indeed."
1990.90-143,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,365.63,366.472,--in addition to this?
1990.90-143,0,26670,henry_s_cohn,,366.472,367.193,"Yes, we do."
1990.90-143,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,430.144,448.855,"One difference, in many States, and I believe this was true where I practiced in Arizona, is that a lis pendens can be sought only where you are bringing an action that somehow affects the land on which you want the lis pendens, whereas an attachment, you can seek that on property that has nothing to do with the underlying cause of action."
1990.90-143,0,26670,henry_s_cohn,,450.227,451.196,I believe it is true.
1990.90-143,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,453.109,455.551,"Mr. Cohn, before you go on let me just be sure I understood one of your answers."
1990.90-143,0,26670,henry_s_cohn,,463.355,468.681,The attachment was obtained without notice--
1990.90-143,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,468.681,469.007,Okay.
1990.90-143,0,26670,henry_s_cohn,,469.007,477.613,"--however, then the party started the lawsuit, and notice and attachment were given at the same time as--"
1990.90-143,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,477.613,481.147,But that means that the party had the right to come in and seek to have the attachment set aside.
1990.90-143,0,26670,henry_s_cohn,,481.147,481.818,--That's right.
1990.90-143,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,481.818,484.559,But the attachment was already in place before there was any notice?
1990.90-143,0,26670,henry_s_cohn,,484.559,485.711,Within a day or so.
1990.90-143,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,485.711,488.151,"Yeah, but at least it preceded the notice."
1990.90-143,0,26670,henry_s_cohn,,488.151,488.642,"Oh, yes."
1990.90-143,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,488.642,489.103,Okay.
1990.90-143,0,26670,henry_s_cohn,,489.103,491.997,Because that's why it is an ex parte procedure.
1990.90-143,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,491.997,492.055,Right.
1990.90-143,0,26670,henry_s_cohn,,492.536,493.257,Yes.
1990.90-143,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,635.92,641.845,"Does that mean that there is, he find that there is a likelihood of success on the merits?"
1990.90-143,0,26670,henry_s_cohn,,641.845,642.295,--That is right.
1990.90-143,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,642.295,644.115,That it's more probable than not--
1990.90-143,0,26670,henry_s_cohn,,644.115,645.027,That's right.
1990.90-143,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,645.027,649.02,--that the plaintiff will prevail?
1990.90-143,0,26670,henry_s_cohn,,649.02,650.44,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1990.90-143,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,650.44,657.495,And I take it that's the same standard that the plaintiff has to meet again if a hearing is sought after the attachment?
1990.90-143,0,26670,henry_s_cohn,,657.495,658.156,That is right.
1990.90-143,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,665.27,666.301,Excuse me--
1990.90-143,0,26670,henry_s_cohn,,666.301,666.702,--Yes.
1990.90-143,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,666.702,674.977,--Are you sure that it is clear from Connecticut law that it means it is more likely than not that the plaintiff is going to win?
1990.90-143,0,26670,henry_s_cohn,,680.029,686.334,We would say that the probable cause standard means that there is a likelihood of success for the--
1990.90-143,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,686.334,694.418,"Gee, it doesn't, it certainly doesn't mean that in the context in which we are most familiar with that phrase, that is whether there is probable cause to conduct a search."
1990.90-143,0,26670,henry_s_cohn,,705.966,708.22,"--It certainly is not suspicion, Your Honor."
1990.90-143,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,717.456,722.798,"Well, if it's more likely than not, then that's sufficient for the plaintiff to prevail in an ordinary civil action, I take it."
1990.90-143,0,26670,henry_s_cohn,,722.798,723.399,--That's right.
1990.90-143,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,723.399,724.849,What is your authority for that?
1990.90-143,0,26670,henry_s_cohn,,729.671,734.627,"Well, I would rely on the Connecticut Fermont case, Fermont v. Smith, which is cited in our brief."
1990.90-143,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,734.627,736.106,--And that holds that?
1990.90-143,0,26670,henry_s_cohn,,736.106,738.507,That describes the nature.
1990.90-143,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,752.078,759.631,"Well then if the plaintiff does not prevail, the defendant is automatically entitled to double damages?"
1990.90-143,0,26670,henry_s_cohn,,764.426,767.956,"--Well, the remedy is there in any event, and they'd have to--"
1990.90-143,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,767.956,773.75,"Well, the remedy is that you... if the suit is commenced without probable cause you get double damages."
1990.90-143,0,26670,henry_s_cohn,,774.371,774.802,--That is right.
1990.90-143,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,774.802,780.996,"So under your theory, anytime the defendant prevails, the defendant is entitled to double damages?"
1990.90-143,0,26670,henry_s_cohn,,780.996,783.357,"I would have to say yes, Your Honor."
1990.90-143,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,783.357,787.771,But no bond or security is required under Connecticut scheme.
1990.90-143,0,26670,henry_s_cohn,,787.771,788.071,No.
1990.90-143,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,788.071,799.68,Do most States that have a pre-attachment proceeding like this require a bond or security to be furnished?
1990.90-143,0,26670,henry_s_cohn,,799.68,800.447,Yes.
1990.90-143,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,825.174,828.287,"Well, the only protection is the finding of probable cause."
1990.90-143,0,26670,henry_s_cohn,,828.287,834.591,That and the right to sue if the... if there has been a wrongful attachment.
1990.90-143,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,834.591,843.356,"Well, that doesn't do any good if the person who makes the attachment is judgment proof, in effect."
1990.90-143,0,26670,henry_s_cohn,,843.356,844.288,"That is true, but--"
1990.90-143,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,844.288,852.282,"It wouldn't take much to require some kind of security to be furnished, would it?"
1990.90-143,0,26670,henry_s_cohn,,852.282,853.992,"--No, it wouldn't, Your Honor."
1990.90-143,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,871.415,873.258,Is the attachment in the sum certain?
1990.90-143,0,26670,henry_s_cohn,,875.238,875.619,Yes.
1990.90-143,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,875.619,879.461,"And if the damages recovered are $50,000, then what?"
1990.90-143,0,26670,henry_s_cohn,,879.461,884.143,Then the... that is just a contingency.
1990.90-143,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,885.675,896.572,"Well, has the, has the defendant... can the defendant show damages and recover if the attachment was for $100,000 but the amount of the judgment was only 50?"
1990.90-143,0,26670,henry_s_cohn,,896.572,897.613,--Certainly.
1990.90-143,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,903.675,911.272,"But there would be the same cause of action, but if the plaintiff in the original case was in good faith and believing the damages would be over $100,000, there'd be no recovery, would there?"
1990.90-143,0,26670,henry_s_cohn,,911.272,912.163,Probably not.
1990.90-143,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,912.163,912.781,Yeah.
1990.90-143,0,26670,henry_s_cohn,,925.199,944.343,"The question is whether or not he is in good faith, because he has to make a judgment at the time when he commences his lawsuit as to what the possible outcome will be and what security he needs."
1990.90-143,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,945.583,946.244,"Okay, well, now, wait a minute."
1990.90-143,0,26670,henry_s_cohn,,970.51,971.552,I would say no.
1990.90-143,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,971.552,974.741,"Well, isn't that inconsistent with your earlier answer?"
1990.90-143,0,26670,henry_s_cohn,,993.875,994.566,"No, I don't."
1990.90-143,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,995.756,996.888,"Well, I don't see how it--"
1990.90-143,0,26670,henry_s_cohn,,996.888,1009.446,"--There's a separate suit which is brought after the initial lawsuit is over in the superior court, and when that separate suit comes up all these factors become important in deciding whether there is a recovery or not."
1990.90-143,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1009.446,1010.635,"--Well, I am sure they are all important."
1990.90-143,0,26670,henry_s_cohn,,1038.233,1039.336,"No, I don't believe so."
1990.90-143,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1041.627,1042.606,--But you have said it already.
1990.90-143,0,26670,henry_s_cohn,,1042.606,1044.628,--I apologize to Your Honor.
1990.90-143,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1065.272,1071.337,So you can defend against the double-damage lawsuit so long as your initial submission was in good faith.
1990.90-143,0,26670,henry_s_cohn,,1071.848,1072.275,Yes.
1990.90-143,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1072.275,1072.836,--Okay.
1990.90-143,0,26670,henry_s_cohn,,1072.836,1078.44,"And in addition, Your Honor, I think I should point out that there is the judge in here."
1990.90-143,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1113.244,1117.997,"Mr. Cohn, I want to go back to another aspect of that probable cause standard."
1990.90-143,0,26670,henry_s_cohn,,1133.917,1137.058,"Yes, Your Honor."
1990.90-143,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1137.058,1143.011,Was anything presented to the judge in this case beyond this particular affidavit?
1990.90-143,0,26670,henry_s_cohn,,1143.011,1152.438,"Actually, I think Your Honor should look at the full affidavit, which is on page 24A of the joint appendix."
1990.90-143,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1160.095,1162.306,What has been clipped out?
1990.90-143,0,26670,henry_s_cohn,,1164.207,1167.087,"Well, just a bit more about what the damages were."
1990.90-143,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1167.087,1177.616,"Well, let's go to the issue for a moment of the likelihood of there being a right to recovery at all."
1990.90-143,0,26670,henry_s_cohn,,1186.492,1190.053,"I would say that it is the bare bones, Your Honor."
1990.90-143,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1193.007,1194.326,This is enough to pass muster?
1990.90-143,0,26670,henry_s_cohn,,1194.326,1198.68,--This is... this was enough for this judge to pass.
1990.90-143,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1198.68,1201.75,"Well, was the judge right or wrong?"
1990.90-143,0,26670,henry_s_cohn,,1201.75,1203.343,I would agree that the judge was right.
1990.90-143,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1203.343,1204.364,All right.
1990.90-143,0,26670,henry_s_cohn,,1248.445,1251.684,"He does say that he was willfully, wantonly, and maliciously assaulted."
1990.90-143,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1251.684,1253.186,"Yeah, but that is purely conclusory."
1990.90-143,0,26670,henry_s_cohn,,1288.701,1294.423,"There is one other point, Your Honor, and that is that he also has the complaint in front of him as well."
1990.90-143,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1294.423,1297.195,"But a complaint is just an allegation, isn't it?"
1990.90-143,0,26670,henry_s_cohn,,1299.366,1308.692,"No, it supplements... the way the practice works is that it supplements the affidavit so that the judges look both at the affidavit and the complaint."
1990.90-143,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1308.692,1313.756,Is the complaint the one found on 28A of the joint appendix?
1990.90-143,0,26670,henry_s_cohn,,1313.756,1314.296,No.
1990.90-143,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1317.168,1320.691,What is the complaint on 28A?
1990.90-143,0,26670,henry_s_cohn,,1320.691,1320.921,"Oh, excuse me."
1990.90-143,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1322.533,1325.756,And what does that add to the affidavit?
1990.90-143,0,26670,henry_s_cohn,,1325.756,1329.677,It does say that he assaulted the plaintiff and beat him with his fists.
1990.90-143,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1329.677,1332.609,So beating with the fists is what's added?
1990.90-143,0,26670,henry_s_cohn,,1332.609,1333.58,"Yes, Your Honor."
1990.90-143,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1333.58,1334.662,That's all?
1990.90-143,0,26670,henry_s_cohn,,1347.759,1348.53,"Yes, Your Honor."
1990.90-143,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1348.53,1361.639,But I guess I come back to the question what does the... what does the affidavit really do beyond repeat or summarize in a conclusory way a series of allegations?
1990.90-143,0,26670,henry_s_cohn,,1361.639,1367.962,In this case I would admit that it is a very skeletal affidavit.
1990.90-143,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1368.462,1381.381,"But if this is enough to pass muster, then a judge really can authorize an attachment on the Connecticut law without being in a position to make any judgment whatsoever about the probability of success."
1990.90-143,0,26670,henry_s_cohn,,1381.942,1383.562,"--No, I would disagree."
1990.90-143,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1407.258,1417.055,"Mr. Cohn, I'd like to come back to your statement at the outset that the judge makes a determination that it is more likely than not that the plaintiff will win."
1990.90-143,0,26670,henry_s_cohn,,1422.208,1422.768,No.
1990.90-143,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1422.768,1426.54,"I mean, he takes all these... so, don't you have to modify that statement?"
1990.90-143,0,26670,henry_s_cohn,,1436.587,1442.961,He looks through the papers to decide whether or not there is sufficient evidence there--
1990.90-143,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1442.961,1446.144,Assuming that everything the plaintiff says is true.
1990.90-143,0,26670,henry_s_cohn,,1446.144,1447.075,--Yes.
1990.90-143,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1447.075,1450.906,But he makes no evaluation as to whether that... this plaintiff could be a thorough liar.
1990.90-143,0,26670,henry_s_cohn,,1451.607,1451.968,Yes.
1990.90-143,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1451.968,1453.137,And he makes no inquiry into that at all.
1990.90-143,0,26670,henry_s_cohn,,1453.137,1454.289,"No, he does not."
1990.90-143,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1454.289,1461.193,"So it's not really an inquiry as to whether it's more likely than not that he'll win, but rather it's more likely than not that if he isn't a liar he'll win."
1990.90-143,0,26670,henry_s_cohn,,1462.312,1464.065,"Well, not so much."
1990.90-143,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1469.619,1472.2,"Well, all he does is really say that the complaint is sufficient."
1990.90-143,0,26670,henry_s_cohn,,1472.611,1476.622,To allow this attachment to go on a debtor's property.
1990.90-143,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1476.622,1479.356,"Really, the complaint survives a motion to dismiss."
1990.90-143,0,26670,henry_s_cohn,,1480.736,1481.287,Yes.
1990.90-143,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1482.637,1483.778,Can I ask one quick question?
1990.90-143,0,26670,henry_s_cohn,,1483.778,1484.129,Yes.
1990.90-143,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1484.129,1488.75,"How do they get the $75,000 on a $15,000 ad damnum?"
1990.90-143,0,26670,henry_s_cohn,,1488.75,1494.865,"The ad damnum, in Connecticut the way it works is you list the minimum, and it could be anything higher than that."
1990.90-143,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1497.516,1499.8,"What is the factual basis for the $75,000?"
1990.90-143,0,26670,henry_s_cohn,,1501.068,1501.859,Not in this affidavit.
1990.90-143,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1502.119,1503.22,--Just picked out of the air?
1990.90-143,0,26670,henry_s_cohn,,1503.22,1515.007,"Normally in an affidavit that was... that would meet constitutional... that would be a little bit better than what we have got here today, they would actually put down money... monetary figures and show exactly how they arrived at that figure."
1990.90-143,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1515.698,1521.532,"Mr. Cohn, may I take you all the way back to the bond, the absence of a bond?"
1990.90-143,0,26670,henry_s_cohn,,1521.532,1521.973,Yes.
1990.90-143,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1521.973,1528.888,"Even though you lost below, am I not correct that two of the judges felt that this was of no consequence?"
1990.90-143,0,26670,henry_s_cohn,,1528.888,1533.5,"Yes, Your Honor, they relied on the fact that you had the right to sue for a wrongful--"
1990.90-143,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1533.5,1542.816,"So that one of the judges in the majority nevertheless felt the bond was not an unconstitutional absence, so to speak?"
1990.90-143,0,26670,henry_s_cohn,,1542.816,1547.62,"--Two felt that the bond was... lack of bond was okay, and one felt that it was not."
1990.90-143,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1550.43,1551.812,"Very well, Mr. Cohn."
1990.90-143,1,30331,joanne_s_faulkner,,1554.243,1557.906,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.90-143,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1589.156,1594.84,"Mrs. Faulkner, when you say reasons for the attachment, you mean something like the defendant is liable to leave the jurisdiction, or something like that?"
1990.90-143,1,30331,joanne_s_faulkner,,1594.84,1604.196,"--That is correct, Your Honor, or the defendant is transferring his property in fraud of creditors or some other emergency circumstances, or the defendant is a deadbeat and doesn't pay his debts, whatever."
1990.90-143,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1638.55,1647.586,Are you suggesting that the due process clause of the Federal Constitution requires that sort of a showing of necessity for an attachment?
1990.90-143,1,30331,joanne_s_faulkner,,1647.586,1649.968,"--I am not suggesting that in this case, Your Honor."
1990.90-143,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1764.992,1772.936,So you disagree with him that the standard is that it's more likely than not that the plaintiff will prevail?
1990.90-143,1,30331,joanne_s_faulkner,,1772.936,1774.298,"I vigorously disagree, Your Honor."
1990.90-143,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1774.739,1778.63,What case do you rely on that we might look at from Connecticut to--
1990.90-143,1,30331,joanne_s_faulkner,,1778.63,1789.568,"--There are several cases cited in my brief, Your Honor, for the proposition that probable cause means merely that he has to have a belief in his cause of action and that belief does not need to be more true than false."
1990.90-143,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1789.568,1794.481,"--I have been reading the Fermont case, and I don't see any reference to that one way or the other."
1990.90-143,1,30331,joanne_s_faulkner,,1794.481,1795.563,"I don't think you will, Your Honor."
1990.90-143,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1831.414,1838.28,"Well, the court... the court below didn't deal with the sufficiency of this particular affidavit, did it?"
1990.90-143,1,30331,joanne_s_faulkner,,1838.28,1840.511,"No, Your Honor, it didn't."
1990.90-143,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1840.511,1842.063,Did they invalidate it on other ground?
1990.90-143,1,30331,joanne_s_faulkner,,1842.063,1843.332,"That is correct, Your Honor, but the--"
1990.90-143,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1843.332,1848.966,And are you defending the judgment below on the grounds they used?
1990.90-143,1,30331,joanne_s_faulkner,,1848.966,1849.937,"--No, Your Honor."
1990.90-143,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1863.926,1868.009,But you are defending the reasons that the court below gave?
1990.90-143,1,30331,joanne_s_faulkner,,1868.009,1869.879,"Yes, Your Honor."
1990.90-143,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1875.533,1880.508,Do you in fact defend it on the grounds that it did rule on?
1990.90-143,1,30331,joanne_s_faulkner,,1880.508,1881.607,"Yes, indeed."
1990.90-143,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1889.544,1889.993,And no hearing.
1990.90-143,1,30331,joanne_s_faulkner,,1889.993,1890.904,And no hearing.
1990.90-143,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1894.416,1903.683,You wouldn't say it would be enough to give him notice if he wasn't entitled to a hearing before the attachment went on?
1990.90-143,1,30331,joanne_s_faulkner,,1903.683,1904.813,"--No, I would not, Your Honor."
1990.90-143,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1904.813,1912.317,"And if a bond or security were furnished, would that overcome any constitutional deficiency?"
1990.90-143,1,30331,joanne_s_faulkner,,1912.317,1915.17,"That would certainly be of assistance, Your Honor."
1990.90-143,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1917.821,1918.832,"Well, what is your position?"
1990.90-143,1,30331,joanne_s_faulkner,,1918.832,1928.838,"--My position is that, unless there are very unusual circumstances, the defendant should have an opportunity to tell his side of the case to the judge before his property is attached."
1990.90-143,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1928.838,1937.984,"Under the holding of the court which we're reviewing, I suppose no State's lis pendens law would survive."
1990.90-143,1,30331,joanne_s_faulkner,,1937.984,1947.901,"I think a lis pendens law is entirely different, Your Honor, and that is because a lis pendens affects a particular piece of property that is an issue."
1990.90-143,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1947.901,1951.902,"But there is no notice, there's no advance hearing."
1990.90-143,1,30331,joanne_s_faulkner,,1963.242,1988.959,"I disagree, Your Honor, because in mechanics liens statutes, in lis pendens statutes, we have a particular piece of property that everybody knows the defendant and the plaintiff have adverse claims to, so that in effect the defendant knows somebody is going to... if a mechanics lien, for instance, is put on the property, work has been done on that property and the defendant really knows that somebody has another interest in that property."
1990.90-143,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2002.265,2018.917,"Well, in your view, Ms. Faulkner, one could have had the most elaborate affidavit in the world here, sworn to by 20 bishops, in effect, and still, without a prior notice and a prior hearing, it still would be unconstitutional."
1990.90-143,1,30331,joanne_s_faulkner,,2018.917,2020.558,"Yes, Your Honor, that is my position."
1990.90-143,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2020.558,2034.198,"Mrs. Faulkner, in the... in the lis pendens situation there is another distinction too, isn't there, and that is that the lien at least allegedly already exists."
1990.90-143,1,30331,joanne_s_faulkner,,2034.198,2038.449,An inchoate lien or some kind... of some kind exists.
1990.90-143,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2038.449,2039.291,"Well, that's the basis of the lawsuit--"
1990.90-143,1,30331,joanne_s_faulkner,,2039.291,2039.851,That's correct.
1990.90-143,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2039.851,2043.004,"--that I have a lien, and I am just asking the court to affirm it."
1990.90-143,1,30331,joanne_s_faulkner,,2043.004,2043.622,That's correct.
1990.90-143,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2043.622,2046.694,Whereas this action is what creates the lien.
1990.90-143,1,30331,joanne_s_faulkner,,2046.694,2047.475,That is correct.
1990.90-143,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2047.475,2050.277,There's... there's no even arguable claim that any lien exists.
1990.90-143,1,30331,joanne_s_faulkner,,2050.277,2051.529,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1990.90-143,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2074.125,2075.495,Is there some authority for that?
1990.90-143,1,30331,joanne_s_faulkner,,2075.495,2085.362,--The case law views that a wrongful attachment is only wrongful if it is completely dissolved and not if it is only partially dissolved.
1990.90-143,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2109.797,2111.579,"What happened in this case, however?"
1990.90-143,1,30331,joanne_s_faulkner,,2111.579,2118.474,"--In this case, Your Honor, there was, the attachment was served on the defendant within about 3 days of the time it was issued."
1990.90-143,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2149.483,2156.118,What... the return date was the date upon which your client could ask for a hearing if he so desired?
1990.90-143,1,30331,joanne_s_faulkner,,2156.118,2161.944,"--He could move for a hearing on that date, he could file an answer, he could do any number of things, but he couldn't do it before the return date."
1990.90-143,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2165.816,2170.139,"So he had notice, but he was unable to take any steps to defeat the attachment before the return date?"
1990.90-143,1,30331,joanne_s_faulkner,,2170.139,2178.765,"--Under the Practice Book Rule 114, that is correct, Your Honor, unless he brought a separate action or an order to show cause at additional expense, in which case he would get a--"
1990.90-143,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2178.765,2183.377,Now was that all in evidence before the district court or the court of appeals here?
1990.90-143,1,30331,joanne_s_faulkner,,2183.377,2187.05,"--No, Your Honor, it's just on the face of our practice and procedure."
1990.90-143,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2187.05,2191.224,May I go back to one... one further issue on that?
1990.90-143,1,30331,joanne_s_faulkner,,2200.048,2204.561,It is the first day upon which a response may be filed.
1990.90-143,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2204.561,2208.935,"Oh, so the clerk of court would not receive or would not accept pleadings prior to that date?"
1990.90-143,1,30331,joanne_s_faulkner,,2208.935,2216.008,"The clerk might accept pleadings, but the other party could say this is... should be stricken from the record because it was not properly filed."
1990.90-143,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2216.008,2217.07,They would have no legal effect?
1990.90-143,1,30331,joanne_s_faulkner,,2217.07,2217.791,That is correct.
1990.90-143,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2217.791,2224.544,"If the return day is the first day, what is the last day upon which responsive pleadings can be filed?"
1990.90-143,1,30331,joanne_s_faulkner,,2224.544,2229.899,"There is a time frame that could go as long as a year or two, Your Honor."
1990.90-143,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2229.899,2230.187,I see.
1990.90-143,1,30331,joanne_s_faulkner,,2230.187,2231.509,It is not like in Federal court.
1990.90-143,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2231.509,2235.392,What is the status of this practice handbook that you refer to?
1990.90-143,1,30331,joanne_s_faulkner,,2255.805,2266.672,"We have a separate statute which says that the pleadings are governed by rules of practice established by the judicial department, and their practice book is the rules of practice established by the judicial department."
1990.90-143,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2266.672,2267.453,I see.
1990.90-143,1,30331,joanne_s_faulkner,,2270.786,2271.865,"I do not, Your Honor."
1990.90-143,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2304.316,2309.431,"That seems unfair, but does that illustrate some constitutional proposition?"
1990.90-143,1,30331,joanne_s_faulkner,,2310.51,2329.072,"--It just shows that a hearing and notice before an attachment is eminently practicable, and ordinarily this Court has not dispensed with a prior notice and opportunity to be heard unless there were emergency circumstances, unless the attachment were random and unauthorized and an advance hearing was not practicable."
1990.90-143,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2329.072,2344.232,"--Well, of course the real estate attachment is a little different than coming in and seizing someone's wages or household goods and carting them off."
1990.90-143,1,30331,joanne_s_faulkner,,2344.232,2345.704,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1990.90-143,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2345.704,2351.317,Because the homeowner is not dispossessed as of the time that the lien goes on.
1990.90-143,1,30331,joanne_s_faulkner,,2362.764,2370.421,"That could be, Your Honor, except that I think a real estate attachment is very significant, and that is because... for several reasons."
1990.90-143,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2454.525,2459.969,"Well, as a practical matter, don't settlement negotiations of some sort usually precede a lawsuit in Connecticut?"
1990.90-143,1,30331,joanne_s_faulkner,,2459.969,2463.442,As a practical matter?
1990.90-143,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2469.816,2476.511,"But I mean, are there no discussions between attorneys before a lawsuit is filed?"
1990.90-143,1,30331,joanne_s_faulkner,,2476.511,2483.814,"When a real estate attachment is available, they go and get it, and then they start talking, Your Honor."
1990.90-143,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2492.51,2498.805,"Mrs. Faulkner, is your position that there has to be a pre-attachment hearing?"
1990.90-143,1,30331,joanne_s_faulkner,,2508.301,2513.714,In Grant there were also emergency circumstances.
1990.90-143,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2531.346,2538.212,"But you're, you're not insisting that there absolutely must be a pre-attachment hearing?"
1990.90-143,1,30331,joanne_s_faulkner,,2538.212,2541.103,"No, Your Honor, there are circumstances--"
1990.90-143,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2541.103,2549.158,"If there are certain other things, perhaps a bond, perhaps the necessity of emergency circumstances, or so forth, you might be able to get one without a hearing, constitutionally?"
1990.90-143,1,30331,joanne_s_faulkner,,2549.158,2549.479,--That is correct.
1990.90-143,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2550.019,2558.564,"Well, don't you think the court below held that there had to be a pre-attachment hearing?"
1990.90-143,1,30331,joanne_s_faulkner,,2558.564,2562.397,"Yes, Your Honor, in the circumstances of this case."
1990.90-143,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2563.108,2572.562,"Well, so you say that an immediate post-attachment hearing would not be sufficient?"
1990.90-143,1,30331,joanne_s_faulkner,,2572.562,2574.174,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1990.90-143,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2574.174,2575.966,And that is what the holding was below?
1990.90-143,1,30331,joanne_s_faulkner,,2575.966,2576.757,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1990.90-143,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2596.278,2603.454,You and your opponent disagree on whether you could apply before the return date.
1990.90-143,1,30331,joanne_s_faulkner,,2609.007,2614.05,--Practice Book 114 says pleadings and motion shall start on the return date.
1990.90-143,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2614.05,2620.775,Your opponent says that you can apply for an immediate hearing.
1990.90-143,1,30331,joanne_s_faulkner,,2620.775,2625.337,"Without citing any authority for that proposition, Your Honor."
1990.90-143,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2625.337,2637.176,Did either of the lower courts make any finding on that point as to whether a relatively prompt or immediate hearing was available?
1990.90-143,1,30331,joanne_s_faulkner,,2637.176,2638.126,"No, Your Honor."
1990.90-143,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2652.124,2654.876,Did you take any steps in the State court?
1990.90-143,1,30331,joanne_s_faulkner,,2654.876,2660.192,"--That is outside the record, Your Honor, but the answer is no."
1990.90-143,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2660.192,2664.773,"The... your opponent says,"
1990.90-143,1,30331,joanne_s_faulkner,,2674.892,2676.14,"I am not sure what it means, Your Honor."
1990.90-143,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2681.726,2682.134,"Well, what did you do?"
1990.90-143,1,30331,joanne_s_faulkner,,2684.077,2685.737,"Yes, there was, Your Honor."
1990.90-143,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2740.433,2750.04,"Mrs. Faulkner, how do you distinguish, if you want to distinguish, the Williams against Bartlett summary affirmance here on the lis pendens statute?"
1990.90-143,1,30331,joanne_s_faulkner,,2753.171,2753.822,"Yes, Your Honor."
1990.90-143,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2767.512,2778.829,"But the plaintiff who gets a lis pendens, until that... until he get it, files it, he has no interest in the property."
1990.90-143,1,30331,joanne_s_faulkner,,2784.402,2785.691,"Yes, he does, Your Honor."
1990.90-143,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2793.919,2794.828,"Well, when can you get a lis pendens?"
1990.90-143,1,30331,joanne_s_faulkner,,2796.41,2797.191,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1990.90-143,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2800.712,2802.154,"Well, that's--"
1990.90-143,1,30331,joanne_s_faulkner,,2809.468,2813.021,You have to have a... some kind of preexisting interest in the property.
1990.90-143,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2813.021,2814.022,So a preexisting interest in the property?
1990.90-143,1,30331,joanne_s_faulkner,,2814.022,2814.443,Right.
1990.90-143,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2814.443,2820.874,How about a claim that the property has been transferred in fraud of creditors?
1990.90-143,1,30331,joanne_s_faulkner,,2822.406,2822.777,Yes.
1990.90-143,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2823.776,2831.122,But can you really say that the person has a preexisting interest in that situation?
1990.90-143,1,30331,joanne_s_faulkner,,2844.072,2848.334,"Well, he has an interest in enforcing his judgment."
1990.90-143,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2850.337,2850.884,Yeah.
1990.90-143,1,30331,joanne_s_faulkner,,2854.578,2854.868,--Right.
1990.90-143,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2854.868,2865.264,"--Well, of course even in that case, even though you can't say the plaintiff claims that he has an interest, you can claim that he is asserting that the purported owner of the property does not have an interest."
1990.90-143,1,30331,joanne_s_faulkner,,2871.447,2872.098,That's correct.
1990.90-143,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2872.098,2883.096,"So I think in all these lis pendens cases you may be correct that at least what is at issue is it is not conceded that the other person is the owner of the property, and I want to get a lien on it."
1990.90-143,1,30331,joanne_s_faulkner,,2885.329,2888.882,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1990.90-143,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2933.389,2937.472,What's the status of the assault suit?
1990.90-143,1,30331,joanne_s_faulkner,,2937.472,2947.679,"Again, that is outside the record, but it is still pending in the State court, and Mr. Doehr has filed a counterclaim against DiGiovanni."
1990.90-143,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2951.771,2959.197,"Can you give us any indication, I am sure it varies from case to case, that, how long it takes to bring a suit like this to trial in Connecticut, assuming diligence on all sides?"
1990.90-143,1,30331,joanne_s_faulkner,,2959.197,2965.519,"--I would say anywhere from 4 years to non-jury to 7 years for a jury trial, and this is a jury trial."
1990.90-143,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2998.401,2999.753,"Thank you, Mrs. Faulkner."
1990.90-143,2,26670,henry_s_cohn,,3002.925,3009.069,"Your Honors, I think I should respond immediately to the return date question which Justice White had."
1990.90-143,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3104.021,3111.968,"What... even if you are right that you can come in and ask for a hearing, you could file a motion for a hearing right away--"
1990.90-143,2,26670,henry_s_cohn,,3111.968,3112.306,Yes.
1990.90-143,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3112.306,3122.063,"--when... there is no guarantee in the statute or anyplace else that the hearing would be, would be given within a particular time?"
1990.90-143,2,26670,henry_s_cohn,,3124.464,3125.856,"No, that's not true, Your Honor."
1990.90-143,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3125.856,3128.228,"Well, where is the provision for an immediate hearing?"
1990.90-143,2,26670,henry_s_cohn,,3128.228,3140.967,"The statute, which is 52.278(E)(c) says that the hearing shall be expeditious, and the Fermont case says that it should be immediate."
1990.90-143,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3152.994,3153.734,Within 10 days?
1990.90-143,2,26670,henry_s_cohn,,3153.734,3156.127,--It certainly could be.
1990.90-143,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3164.472,3167.304,When did the defendant ask for it in that case?
1990.90-143,2,26670,henry_s_cohn,,3167.304,3169.495,In the Fermont case?
1990.90-143,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3169.495,3169.855,Yes.
1990.90-143,2,26670,henry_s_cohn,,3169.855,3171.107,In the Fermont case--
1990.90-143,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3171.107,3172.456,How soon after the attachment?
1990.90-143,2,26670,henry_s_cohn,,3172.456,3181.863,"--Um, I believe in the Fermont case, as I understand the facts, the attachment had gone on, but the defendant hadn't asked for any sort of hearing."
1990.90-143,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3205.799,3216.525,"Well, it's sort of inconsistent with the requirement for an immediate hearing to say that under the rules you have to wait 20 days before you can even ask for it."
1990.90-143,2,26670,henry_s_cohn,,3216.525,3220.719,"Yes, but we would contest that that is the situation that would happen."
1990.90-143,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3220.719,3221.889,"Thank you, Mr. Cohn."
1990.90-143,3,30331,joanne_s_faulkner,,3229.473,3230.024,"Yes, Your Honor."
1990.90-143,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3230.024,3230.94,Thank you.
