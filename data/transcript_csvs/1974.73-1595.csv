1974.73-1595,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,30.641,"We'll hear arguments next in 73-1595, Colonial Pipeline against Traigle."
1974.73-1595,0,39646,r_gordon_kean,,35.339,39.904,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1974.73-1595,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,252.905,255.589,What other tax is archived by Colonial --
1974.73-1595,0,39646,r_gordon_kean,,255.589,265.328,"Colonial passed a Mr. Justice Rehnquist, the property tax on its facilities which are located in the State of Louisiana."
1974.73-1595,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,344.054,347.489,Are you objecting to the imposition of the income tax by Louisiana as well?
1974.73-1595,0,39646,r_gordon_kean,,347.489,349.445,"No sir, we do not."
1974.73-1595,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,349.445,359.903,"Well, if you prevail here, what's to prevent Louisiana from merely increasing the rates of its income tax of the same amount as your franchise tax?"
1974.73-1595,0,39646,r_gordon_kean,,359.903,368.184,"Well, I think that if they increase the rates of the corporation income tax, they got to increase those rates across the board."
1974.73-1595,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,380.944,397.598,"Let me put it in another way then, explain first the -- how that Colonial's tax burden in Louisiana is different from the burden born by domestic corporations?"
1974.73-1595,0,39646,r_gordon_kean,,397.598,415.062,"As I view it, Mr. Justice Blackmun, colonial pays the property tax for which it has the right to and to get police protection for protection in the other protection that a state would afford on to those circumstances."
1974.73-1595,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,454.288,464.017,"Well then, I go back to my other question, why can't Louisiana accomplish the same thing by increasing the income tax across the board if you will?"
1974.73-1595,0,39646,r_gordon_kean,,464.017,478.675,"Well, they could perhaps increase the income tax across the board so if all the corporations in the State of Louisiana pay an increased income tax and under those circumstances, it may well be that they would accomplish otherwise the same result."
1974.73-1595,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,514.789,525.086,"You could say then in effect that even though Louisiana can and I gather does impose the same tax on domestic corporations, it can impose it on your client."
1974.73-1595,0,39646,r_gordon_kean,,525.086,525.954,That's correct.
1974.73-1595,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,555.482,559.941,But why do you concede then that Louisiana can subject Colonial to an income tax?
1974.73-1595,0,39646,r_gordon_kean,,559.941,577.079,For the simple reason that this Court has held in the prior cases that are fairly apportioned income tax is that it can be levied against an interstate carrier because it's on the income as distinguished from the right to carry on the interstate business.
1974.73-1595,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,577.079,581.768,You're making no claim here of unfair apportionment of the franchise tax?
1974.73-1595,0,39646,r_gordon_kean,,581.768,582.016,"No, sir."
1974.73-1595,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,601.261,610.488,"How the -- how was the interstate portion, though not -- is it, is it some rough major of the income earned from doing business in Louisiana?"
1974.73-1595,0,39646,r_gordon_kean,,610.488,610.684,"Yes, sir."
1974.73-1595,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,612.791,619.743,"Well, did you have a source of income then if you could see this in Louisiana?"
1974.73-1595,0,39646,r_gordon_kean,,619.743,619.948,"Yes, sir."
1974.73-1595,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,619.948,621.495,And then you are doing business in Louisiana.
1974.73-1595,0,39646,r_gordon_kean,,621.495,622.473,We are doing business.
1974.73-1595,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,630.62,635.928,"Well, you don't think -- do you think that Louisiana can -- could you qualify to do business in Louisiana."
1974.73-1595,0,39646,r_gordon_kean,,635.928,638.673,We qualify in Louisiana to do intrastate business.
1974.73-1595,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,638.673,655.87,"Yeah, and do you think -- do you think they could say, ?Well, if you want him to -- if you want the privilege of doing business in Louisiana, doing business for which you're going to generate an income in Louisiana, for that privilege, we're going to charge you $100.00 a year."
1974.73-1595,0,39646,r_gordon_kean,,655.87,668.858,"I don't think so, as long as that business was a purely intrastate business because under those circumstances, you give to the state the right to deny interstate business within its borders based upon the payment of some fee."
1974.73-1595,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,668.858,676.477,"Well, that maybe -- that maybe true but at the same time you are doing business in Louisiana."
1974.73-1595,0,39646,r_gordon_kean,,676.477,677.622,"Yes, sir."
1974.73-1595,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,677.709,679.151,And generating income in Louisiana.
1974.73-1595,0,39646,r_gordon_kean,,679.151,681.865,We operate a pipeline system in Louisiana.
1974.73-1595,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,681.865,689.778,And asking for the -- and asking for Louisiana's protection in the course -- in the course of doing so.
1974.73-1595,0,39646,r_gordon_kean,,689.778,693.758,We asked nothing from Louisiana with respect to the right to carry on --
1974.73-1595,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,693.758,695.703,You're getting them anyway.
1974.73-1595,0,39646,r_gordon_kean,,695.703,715.509,The right to carry on the interstate business because our position is under decided cases of this Court that the right to carry on a purely intrastate business is derived from the Constitution and therefore there's nothing for us to pay Louisiana in the way of the privilege tax to carry on that business.
1974.73-1595,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,715.509,733.621,Wasn't that argument came in Northwestern State's case as was argued here and rejected and I think I'm still troubled by the distinction between the income tax which you do not contest because of the Northwestern case and this one.
1974.73-1595,0,39646,r_gordon_kean,,733.621,742.451,"Well, as I appreciate the difference Mr. Justice Blackmun and the distinction made by the Court in the Northwestern State's case."
1974.73-1595,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,861.809,866.558,"It does take oil out and put oil in at stations in Louisiana, doesn't it?"
1974.73-1595,0,39646,r_gordon_kean,,866.558,878.876,"They pick up oil from a city service refinery in Lake Charles, Louisiana and they transport that further to the east outside the state."
1974.73-1595,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1254.019,1260.481,"Do you know whether any of the airlines are subject to this tax, airlines that --"
1974.73-1595,0,39646,r_gordon_kean,,1260.481,1261.587,That are operating in Louisiana?
1974.73-1595,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1261.587,1264.538,"Yes, without making any local stops except --"
1974.73-1595,0,39646,r_gordon_kean,,1264.538,1266.753,I don't know Mr. Chief Justice.
1974.73-1595,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1273.838,1284.954,"I take it your view would be that Louisiana did not tax an airline that was coming in and landing merely at New Orleans and then picking up passengers and going out, discharging in picking up."
1974.73-1595,0,39646,r_gordon_kean,,1284.954,1301.489,"Well, it would depend I think on whether or not the Court could find from activities that the airline was conducting in the State of Louisiana that they were indeed engaged in local activities separate from that interstate operation which might then form the basis of the tax."
1974.73-1595,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1375.561,1382.387,"Well, but you're protected to a certain extent by the fact that this tax applies equally to domestic corporation."
1974.73-1595,0,39646,r_gordon_kean,,1382.387,1390.814,"Well, this Court held Mr. Justice Rehnquist in Spector Motors which was dealing with the transportation operation."
1974.73-1595,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1390.814,1393.387,"Well, isn't Spector pretty much of an anomaly?"
1974.73-1595,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1560.29,1569.17,"But you're protected by the principle that a tax on interstate commerce can't discriminate against interstate commerce and here, you don't really claim any discrimination."
1974.73-1595,0,39646,r_gordon_kean,,1569.17,1589.96,"No, I don't feel that interstate commerce is protected by apportionment of -- by apportionment of a privilege tax because the tax there is laid upon interstate commerce and no manner of apportionment can deny that fact."
1974.73-1595,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1641.181,1645.652,But Northwestern States came along after Spector.
1974.73-1595,0,39646,r_gordon_kean,,1645.652,1646.774,"As my recollection, it did."
1974.73-1595,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1647.393,1652.998,"And at least that was some kind of an incursion on Spector, wasn't it?"
1974.73-1595,0,39646,r_gordon_kean,,1652.998,1653.854,"No, sir, but --"
1974.73-1595,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1653.854,1655.199,"That was before an income tax, was it?"
1974.73-1595,0,39646,r_gordon_kean,,1655.199,1656.904,That's what an apportioned income tax.
1974.73-1595,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1657.738,1659.554,This is an unapportioned franchise tax.
1974.73-1595,0,39646,r_gordon_kean,,1659.554,1660.058,If you read --
1974.73-1595,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1660.058,1663.639,But you're making the same argument here that was made in Northwestern States.
1974.73-1595,0,39646,r_gordon_kean,,1663.639,1674.525,"No sir, I'm not, because as I pointed out a moment ago, Northwestern States was dealing with an income tax."
1974.73-1595,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1674.525,1678.931,Exactly and some states call an income tax is a franchise tax.
1974.73-1595,0,39646,r_gordon_kean,,1678.931,1680.273,"No, sir."
1974.73-1595,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1724.686,1726.574,"No, I'm not blaming you for this argument."
1974.73-1595,0,39646,r_gordon_kean,,1735.29,1745.94,"Well, I must say it, Mr. Justice Blackmun that in all of the cases which you dealt with the problem, the decisions have been by a sharply divided Court."
1974.73-1595,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1745.94,1747.405,Indeed they have a --
1974.73-1595,0,39646,r_gordon_kean,,1747.405,1754.911,"As a matter of fact in the Memphis Gas versus Stone case, it was not even a majority opinion as the Court may recall."
1974.73-1595,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1780.898,1794.307,I think we realized this and there's not any question about it but I'm just suggesting that the difference between Northwestern States in this case is a very thin one and this Court drew it but I think it's a very thin one.
1974.73-1595,0,39646,r_gordon_kean,,1794.307,1799.58,I don't share your view Mr. Justice Blackmun that it is a thin one.
1974.73-1595,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1829.622,1831.402,Even though measured by income.
1974.73-1595,0,39646,r_gordon_kean,,1831.402,1831.686,"Yes, sir."
1974.73-1595,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1833.78,1837.281,Does that make any sense to you just as a practical matter?
1974.73-1595,0,39646,r_gordon_kean,,1837.281,1838.825,"Yes, sir."
1974.73-1595,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1874.457,1880.996,"Very well, Mr. Kean."
1974.73-1595,1,44239,whit_m_cook_ii,,1893.018,1897.23,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1974.73-1595,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2033.836,2046.608,"Mr. Cook, for tax purposes, what's the difference between levying a tax or what's the difference between doing interstate business and doing interstate business in a corporate form?"
1974.73-1595,1,44239,whit_m_cook_ii,,2046.608,2051.155,That is the heart of this case today.
1974.73-1595,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2051.155,2053.539,And let me add that at a second question.
1974.73-1595,1,44239,whit_m_cook_ii,,2067.445,2080.074,The Louisiana Supreme Court recognized that the state may not and the state has not attempted here to impose a tax on the privilege of doing interstate business in Louisiana.
1974.73-1595,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2168.657,2180.391,"Mr. Kean, as I read the statute, there's no apportionment of any kind on this tax, is that correct?"
1974.73-1595,1,44239,whit_m_cook_ii,,2186.355,2186.715,"No, sir."
1974.73-1595,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2190.589,2192.351,What page in your brief is that on?
1974.73-1595,1,44239,whit_m_cook_ii,,2192.351,2204.499,That's set out in the appendix to my brief on page 45.
1974.73-1595,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2223.359,2229.314,"As a matter of information, what's the basis of the apportionment, I've overlooked that."
1974.73-1595,1,44239,whit_m_cook_ii,,2229.314,2231.183,I'll have to go over that.
1974.73-1595,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2231.183,2232.77,"Well, if you don't remember just go ahead."
1974.73-1595,1,44239,whit_m_cook_ii,,2238.378,2250.23,"Now, what is the difference between tax in the privilege of doing interstate business and the tax imposed in this case?"
1974.73-1595,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2271.924,2284.561,Do you have to take -- impose a tax on a privilege of doing this business in a non-corporate form and have then complemented tax?
1974.73-1595,1,44239,whit_m_cook_ii,,2284.561,2286.752,The tax is only imposed upon corporations.
1974.73-1595,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2287.152,2289.425,"No, I'm -- we're talking about constitutional power."
1974.73-1595,1,44239,whit_m_cook_ii,,2289.425,2289.999,Yes.
1974.73-1595,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2289.999,2305.809,"And I read it, I know that this tax is imposed on corporations and you justified by saying that at least arguendo that the beyond the power of Louisiana is to tax that business as a business since it's purely interstate."
1974.73-1595,1,44239,whit_m_cook_ii,,2321.356,2335.82,"If the state granted to the partnership or whatever other type of association it was benefits, local benefits upon which he can levy the tax, yes."
1974.73-1595,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2350.192,2357.752,"And there's nothing left of the interstate immunity, is there?"
1974.73-1595,1,44239,whit_m_cook_ii,,2357.752,2359.372,The interstate immunity still exists --
1974.73-1595,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2359.372,2373.203,"If the state tax -- if the state can tax a purely interstate business by way of a franchise tax on the basis of the form on which it's conducted, whether it be corporate on non-corporate and there's nothing left to the exemption, is there?"
1974.73-1595,1,44239,whit_m_cook_ii,,2373.203,2377.529,"I agree with your statement, except for the one point."
1974.73-1595,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2414.604,2415.229,That's true.
1974.73-1595,1,44239,whit_m_cook_ii,,2427.056,2427.609,That is true.
1974.73-1595,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2431.213,2435.492,And what are these benefits?
1974.73-1595,1,44239,whit_m_cook_ii,,2435.492,2440.485,As pointed out by Louisiana Supreme Court.
1974.73-1595,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2440.485,2443.698,This is isn't a Louisiana corporation.
1974.73-1595,1,44239,whit_m_cook_ii,,2443.698,2444.185,"No, sir."
1974.73-1595,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2448.049,2451.546,Could they have run the pipeline through without qualifying?
1974.73-1595,1,44239,whit_m_cook_ii,,2451.546,2452.484,"Yes, they could."
1974.73-1595,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2455.38,2461.249,"I suppose if they haven't qualified, they would have run the risk that in the event of an explosion."
1974.73-1595,1,44239,whit_m_cook_ii,,2466.848,2468.443,Yes.
1974.73-1595,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2469.639,2476.465,"The statute which prevents some from going into the state court if they have not qualified, do you have such statute?"
1974.73-1595,1,44239,whit_m_cook_ii,,2476.465,2477.792,We do have such a statute.
1974.73-1595,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2552.241,2571.855,Have I heard your answer to Justice Stewart's question which I think followed mine as to whether in your opinion Louisiana have the power to tax the doing of interstate business in an individual where sole proprietorship or a partnership on?
1974.73-1595,1,44239,whit_m_cook_ii,,2571.855,2574.015,"Yes, I did answer that."
1974.73-1595,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2584.332,2591.179,"Well, suppose Colonial were owned Mr. Colonial who was an individual, could they tax him?"
1974.73-1595,1,44239,whit_m_cook_ii,,2591.179,2593.482,"Well, could they tax him?"
1974.73-1595,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2598.115,2609.312,"Well, may they take their place specifically expressed the congressional intent to make the incidents of the taxation the privilege of doing this business as an individual proprietorship."
1974.73-1595,1,44239,whit_m_cook_ii,,2609.312,2616.003,"Well, he would have the right to receive the same police protections that Colonial receives in this case."
1974.73-1595,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2627.895,2631.991,Could you answer my Brother Blackmun's question?
1974.73-1595,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2631.991,2633.637,Or Mr. Justice Stewart's question.
1974.73-1595,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2633.637,2633.945,"Oh, yeah."
1974.73-1595,1,44239,whit_m_cook_ii,,2635.739,2637.05,I thought that I did.
1974.73-1595,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2641.618,2644.273,"Well, you mentioned fire protection."
1974.73-1595,1,44239,whit_m_cook_ii,,2644.273,2645.059,Yes.
1974.73-1595,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2658.314,2666.308,Suppose -- conferred by Delaware whether New Jersey or wherever this place is incorporated?
1974.73-1595,1,44239,whit_m_cook_ii,,2666.308,2674.433,"The tax, the power of the state to tax is only upon entities emanating from the state."
1974.73-1595,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2684.107,2686.485,You don't really --
1974.73-1595,1,44239,whit_m_cook_ii,,2686.485,2693.993,"Colonial, voluntarily came into Louisiana, qualify with the secretary of the state, received the certificate of --"
1974.73-1595,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2693.993,2695.51,Did they get that free to that?
1974.73-1595,1,44239,whit_m_cook_ii,,2695.51,2695.969,Pardon me?
1974.73-1595,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2695.969,2700.416,"Did they get that free or to that to pay a fee, filing fee?"
1974.73-1595,1,44239,whit_m_cook_ii,,2700.416,2701.36,I can't answer that question.
1974.73-1595,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2701.36,2703.987,"They probably did, so when can't the state --"
1974.73-1595,1,44239,whit_m_cook_ii,,2703.987,2705.844,Filing fee.
1974.73-1595,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2705.844,2719.566,"Well, when I go -- if I should go, I'll never have but fashioned go to the Mardi Gras in New Orleans, I get police protection and fire protection so that that incident alone isn't very much of a basis for levying taxes, is it?"
1974.73-1595,1,44239,whit_m_cook_ii,,2719.566,2720.354,I agree with that.
1974.73-1595,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2720.354,2721.363,It's the corporate form.
1974.73-1595,1,44239,whit_m_cook_ii,,2721.363,2723.497,It's the corporate -- it's the corporation itself.
1974.73-1595,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2723.497,2726.47,"Well, that don't they pay property taxes?"
1974.73-1595,1,44239,whit_m_cook_ii,,2726.47,2726.938,They do.
1974.73-1595,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2729.214,2733.697,"Well, is that -- is that or is that not for fire protection, the police protection?"
1974.73-1595,1,44239,whit_m_cook_ii,,2736.786,2741.023,"That goes to the local parishes for their use, yes."
1974.73-1595,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2745.726,2747.198,There is not a corporate tax.
1974.73-1595,1,44239,whit_m_cook_ii,,2752.464,2756.134,That's correct and they do pay a local property tax.
1974.73-1595,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2756.134,2763.177,"So, what is this other benefit they get, in addition to all others?"
1974.73-1595,1,44239,whit_m_cook_ii,,2763.177,2769.216,"The state is levying a tax on the corporation, on the corporate form of existence."
1974.73-1595,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2769.216,2771.902,And it gives what in return?
1974.73-1595,1,44239,whit_m_cook_ii,,2771.902,2779.043,It gives to the corporations the various corporate benefits they received by virtue of being incorporated.
1974.73-1595,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2779.043,2781.424,Name one or two of them?
1974.73-1595,1,44239,whit_m_cook_ii,,2781.424,2786.322,The absence of individual liability.
1974.73-1595,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2799.514,2802.569,And that's given by Louisiana?
1974.73-1595,1,44239,whit_m_cook_ii,,2802.569,2809.674,It is to the state's -- to the corporations which one are domestic or two which have qualified --
1974.73-1595,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2809.674,2813.165,"One of it you said, didn't apply to interstate?"
1974.73-1595,1,44239,whit_m_cook_ii,,2813.165,2813.854,Pardon me.
1974.73-1595,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2813.854,2818.654,"You say, one of those benefits didn't apply to interstate corporations, didn't you?"
1974.73-1595,1,44239,whit_m_cook_ii,,2818.654,2824.131,It wouldn't but the corporation has voluntarily qualified in the state.
1974.73-1595,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3152.847,3155.661,"So, they're paying property taxes on that, aren't they?"
1974.73-1595,1,44239,whit_m_cook_ii,,3155.661,3156.363,Correct.
1974.73-1595,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3161.444,3164.632,"Well, but you've taken care of that with the property tax, haven't you?"
1974.73-1595,1,44239,whit_m_cook_ii,,3164.632,3166.348,"That is -- yes, sir."
1974.73-1595,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3201.137,3203.071,Tax about --
1974.73-1595,1,44239,whit_m_cook_ii,,3203.071,3203.62,That's correct.
1974.73-1595,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3203.62,3204.578,The income tax.
1974.73-1595,1,44239,whit_m_cook_ii,,3204.578,3209.661,That's correct.
1974.73-1595,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3210.806,3213.45,"Now, that's what every domestic corporation --"
1974.73-1595,1,44239,whit_m_cook_ii,,3213.45,3213.727,That's correct.
1974.73-1595,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3213.727,3215.175,Put on each of these --
1974.73-1595,1,44239,whit_m_cook_ii,,3215.175,3216.296,"Yes, sir."
1974.73-1595,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3232.09,3238.957,"Now, what's -- what's the counterpart tax of a domestic corporation if you spell that out for me again?"
1974.73-1595,1,44239,whit_m_cook_ii,,3242.263,3244.069,It is the same tax.
1974.73-1595,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3244.52,3257.412,"Well, the domestic corporation, let's assume that you have one that went from Baton Rouge to New Orleans if that were feasible, domestic entirely."
1974.73-1595,1,44239,whit_m_cook_ii,,3263.232,3270.433,They would pay the corporate franchise tax imposed by the statute in question.
1974.73-1595,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3303.629,3321.264,"Well, if the -- if the individual that was postulated by I think Mr. Justice Stewart and Mr. Justice Blackmun had started this pipeline in Texas and went all the way to the east coast, what would be the situation on -- would he be able to condemn lands?"
1974.73-1595,1,44239,whit_m_cook_ii,,3321.264,3323.016,Would it be a common carrier?
1974.73-1595,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3323.016,3325.082,It's a common carrier.
1974.73-1595,1,44239,whit_m_cook_ii,,3325.082,3326.955,I would have to look this Act --
1974.73-1595,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3326.955,3329.989,Wouldn't that might be quite important?
1974.73-1595,1,44239,whit_m_cook_ii,,3329.989,3330.047,Yes.
1974.73-1595,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3330.047,3331.131,In this case?
1974.73-1595,1,44239,whit_m_cook_ii,,3331.131,3334.075,"Well, no sir because it has not been issue in the case."
1974.73-1595,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3334.075,3338.383,"Now, you're speaking of the power to eliminate domain is it your --"
1974.73-1595,1,44239,whit_m_cook_ii,,3338.383,3346.443,"Okay, I'll -- if we are talking strictly of the power the state to do it, then yes."
1974.73-1595,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3353.004,3357.825,"Yes, but you wouldn't be taxing this individual or would you?"
1974.73-1595,1,44239,whit_m_cook_ii,,3360.078,3361.314,No.
1974.73-1595,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3361.314,3370.939,Are there any individuals that you know of in Louisiana that have $40 million invested in a transcontinental pipeline?
1974.73-1595,1,44239,whit_m_cook_ii,,3370.939,3372.999,"No, there's none."
1974.73-1595,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3372.999,3384.156,But you might have individuals that have a substantial some invested in a trucking concern running from Texas to Mississippi.
1974.73-1595,1,44239,whit_m_cook_ii,,3384.156,3385.495,That's correct.
1974.73-1595,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3385.495,3390.209,But I'm just wondering what your last argument.
1974.73-1595,1,44239,whit_m_cook_ii,,3407.691,3408.357,"No, I'm not."
1974.73-1595,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3422.085,3435.542,"But that's not -- if I understood your response correctly, that's not any different from what it would be if Mr. H. L. Hunter over in Texas, had to individually build a pipeline or had run a truck line across?"
1974.73-1595,1,44239,whit_m_cook_ii,,3435.542,3436.358,That's correct.
1974.73-1595,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3466.085,3471.842,But I thought you would concede it that they would not levy this tax on the individual?
1974.73-1595,1,44239,whit_m_cook_ii,,3471.842,3477.536,They would not levy this tax and the state is not attempting to levy this tax on the individual.
1974.73-1595,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3485.369,3491.829,"What Mr. Justice Stewart said, ""We're not talking about exactly what the state has done here."""
1974.73-1595,1,44239,whit_m_cook_ii,,3499.719,3505.261,I attempted and I'll attempt to do it again and that is this.
1974.73-1595,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3529.31,3543.493,"Give me an example of this because I detect, I think an inference that the only thing granted Colonial is the right to do business in corporate form, is this what you're saying?"
1974.73-1595,1,44239,whit_m_cook_ii,,3543.493,3545.533,That is what is being taxed.
1974.73-1595,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3558.981,3564.247,Are there any other benefits that Colonial receives from Louisiana?
1974.73-1595,1,44239,whit_m_cook_ii,,3564.247,3571.33,"The benefits are the normal corporate benefits that any other corporation, domestic or foreign receives."
1974.73-1595,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3571.33,3583.761,But don't they have a fire protection all the rest to this kind of thing and is this answered by Mr. Justice Marshall's comment or that's taken care of by the property tax?
1974.73-1595,1,44239,whit_m_cook_ii,,3583.761,3585.141,"No, sir."
1974.73-1595,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3615.972,3624.495,"Well, you referred to before didn't you to the limited liability, not necessarily that the state spends money to give Colonial."
1974.73-1595,1,44239,whit_m_cook_ii,,3647.808,3648.358,That is correct.
1974.73-1595,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3648.358,3655.219,"And it's taxing all corporations that do business in the Louisiana domestic or foreign for these particular privileges, isn't it?"
1974.73-1595,1,44239,whit_m_cook_ii,,3655.219,3662.501,That's correct.
1974.73-1595,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3732.642,3733.51,"Very well, Mr. Cook."
1974.73-1595,2,39646,r_gordon_kean,,3736.262,3737.778,Thank you.
1974.73-1595,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3806.417,3812.197,"Well, a right doesn't have to be exercised necessarily to be valuable, does it?"
1974.73-1595,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3832.68,3833.474,"Thank you, gentlemen."
