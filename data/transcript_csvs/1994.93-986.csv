1994.93-986,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.606,"We'll hear argument next in Number 93-986, Joseph McIntyre v. the Ohio Elections Commission."
1994.93-986,0,20917,david_a_goldberger,,59.639,66.625,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1994.93-986,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,84.07,95.526,"You're not saying that that's why the leaflets were made punishable, because they urge somebody to vote a particular way."
1994.93-986,0,20917,david_a_goldberger,,95.526,114.255,"It seems to me, Your Honor, that it's the contention of the State of Ohio that anonymous political leaflets are unprotected when the leaflets address voters, so indeed it was a combination of the anonymity and the fact that the leaflets were addressed to voters in a coming election."
1994.93-986,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,114.255,119.909,"Because... you say that's the only place where the Ohio statute applies, is when the leaflets are addressed to voters?"
1994.93-986,0,20917,david_a_goldberger,,119.909,130.431,"According to the... it's when they... they address voters on a referendum issue, or on an election, if that's the thrust of the Court's question."
1994.93-986,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,214.019,215.752,"Well, what sort of a town is Westerville?"
1994.93-986,0,20917,david_a_goldberger,,218.521,222.192,"Westerville is a suburb of Columbus, Ohio."
1994.93-986,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,234.265,267.721,"Mr. Goldberger, had the flier of Ms. McIntyre related to a congressional election, and if it cost more than $250 to produce, there would have been certain Federal requirements, would there not, of disclosing the expenditure to the FEC and her identity in making an expenditure, and so forth?"
1994.93-986,0,20917,david_a_goldberger,,267.721,282.646,"Your Honor, under 441(d) of the Federal Election Campaign Act, there is a disclosure requirement with respect to expenditures to produce leaflets."
1994.93-986,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,284.182,291.669,"Now, do you take the position that that kind of a requirement is valid?"
1994.93-986,0,20917,david_a_goldberger,,293.602,293.985,--No.
1994.93-986,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,305.827,307.862,"Well, that wasn't my question."
1994.93-986,0,20917,david_a_goldberger,,312.332,312.865,I believe it--
1994.93-986,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,312.865,328.842,"I think it requires furnishing information to the FEC that I have spent X amount of dollars in connection with a political campaign, and that identity is then a matter of record."
1994.93-986,0,20917,david_a_goldberger,,333.746,334.646,--Your Honor--
1994.93-986,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,334.646,336.198,It doesn't have to appear on the leaflet.
1994.93-986,0,20917,david_a_goldberger,,340.666,349.688,"--No, we do not, Your Honor, but I... with all due respect, I do believe 441(d) includes a requirement that the name appear on the face of the leaflet."
1994.93-986,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,359.211,368.666,What about a requirement on a television ad that the identity of the people running the ad be shown?
1994.93-986,0,20917,david_a_goldberger,,368.666,384.259,"--I believe that's a different kind of a case, Your Honor, because television is a conduit for a great variety of communication, and there's a potential for confusion when a viewer is watching television as to who's saying what and under what circumstances."
1994.93-986,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,394.634,398.603,So that we do have an interest in knowing who is the speaker?
1994.93-986,0,20917,david_a_goldberger,,398.603,410.743,"You do have an interest in knowing a situation in which there may be confusion, because the speaker appears to be someone other than whom the speaker actually is, but that--"
1994.93-986,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,410.743,415.63,"Well, suppose Mrs. McIntyre had hired other people to put out the leaflets, might there not have been confusion there?"
1994.93-986,0,20917,david_a_goldberger,,415.63,420.182,"--Well, I don't believe so, Your Honor, because the leaflets are... they speak for themselves."
1994.93-986,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,440.063,442.448,But your typical TV ad isn't that way.
1994.93-986,0,20917,david_a_goldberger,,448.518,462.111,"Well, it seems to me, Your Honor, under those circumstances, if there's clarity as to who the vehicle is, I believe that there's... there shouldn't be an absolute necessity to place it on the screen."
1994.93-986,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,480.073,487.226,"What if you just said on the television screen, vote no on the referendum for the Westerville middle school?"
1994.93-986,0,20917,david_a_goldberger,,487.226,503.022,"It seems to me that to the extent there's an interest in anonymity and there's no confusion as to who is speaking, in light of the fact that you have the television serving as the conduit, that is arguably constitutionally protected."
1994.93-986,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,503.022,514.144,"Well, if the State showed that there were confusion as to who were handing out leaflets, would there then be a requirement of anon... of named persons?"
1994.93-986,0,20917,david_a_goldberger,,514.144,520.548,"It seems to me if you had a statute... well, you have statutes which deal with election fraud and misrepresentation."
1994.93-986,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,523.082,528.285,"Well, I'm positing an assumption where there are a lot of leaflets going around and somebody's confused about who's writing the leaflets."
1994.93-986,0,20917,david_a_goldberger,,528.285,529.904,"I don't believe that's the business of the State, Your Honor."
1994.93-986,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,529.904,536.157,"Well then, that's not the answer to the question between, asking you to distinguish between television and pamphlets."
1994.93-986,0,20917,david_a_goldberger,,536.157,542.627,"Well, that assumes that television is governed by the same set of ground rules that are applicable to pamphlets."
1994.93-986,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,550.417,552.433,What has spectrum scarcity got to do with this issue?
1994.93-986,0,20917,david_a_goldberger,,555.821,571.914,"Well, Red Lion is not only a spectrum scarcity case, Your Honor, it's also a case which deals with the problem of having a conduit of communication going into the home which... there is an immediate impact in which there is a potential for confusion."
1994.93-986,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,571.914,586.073,"Well, isn't there an equal potential for confusion when I walk up to the polling place and I'm handed 6 or 8 or 10 or 12 leaflets saying, vote for this, that, or the other person or issue on the way up to vote?"
1994.93-986,0,20917,david_a_goldberger,,586.073,591.31,"Your Honor, I believe that the voters are capable of deciding for themselves."
1994.93-986,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,593.929,598.314,You just did not see my puzzlement last September when I was on my way into the primary.
1994.93-986,0,20917,david_a_goldberger,,617.461,627.4,"--In my view, Your Honor, it is constitutional in the context of broadcasting, because I believe broadcasting poses a separate question."
1994.93-986,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,627.4,629.685,"That's all it applies to, is radio and television advertising."
1994.93-986,0,20917,david_a_goldberger,,629.685,630.902,That's correct.
1994.93-986,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,630.902,638.375,"So you can, in any and all radio and television ads, the State legitimately can require identification of the speaker?"
1994.93-986,0,20917,david_a_goldberger,,638.375,647.997,"I believe that... I believe that's true, but I think it's important to keep in mind that these are not political ads."
1994.93-986,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,668.644,669.427,"Well, Mr.--"
1994.93-986,0,20917,david_a_goldberger,,678.016,682.654,"In a broadcast, or just on the flier?"
1994.93-986,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,683.104,688.391,"You said the thing was the spending of money, substantial amounts of money."
1994.93-986,0,20917,david_a_goldberger,,695.645,697.996,"--That would track 441(d), Your Honor."
1994.93-986,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,723.129,724.314,"Well, Mr. Goldberger--"
1994.93-986,0,20917,david_a_goldberger,,724.314,725.397,I believe that should be unconstitutional.
1994.93-986,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,725.397,740.34,"--the statute 441(d) does say that whenever a person makes an expenditure for the purpose of financing communications for an election, such communication shall clearly state the name of the person making it."
1994.93-986,0,20917,david_a_goldberger,,752.131,758.302,"Your Honor, 441(d) addresses the question of expenditures."
1994.93-986,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,776.949,779.499,But this is less restrictive than an expenditure statute.
1994.93-986,0,20917,david_a_goldberger,,786.971,787.454,--I--
1994.93-986,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,787.454,790.439,Are you saying that the State can do the greater and not the lesser.
1994.93-986,0,20917,david_a_goldberger,,790.439,793.958,"--No, I... I'm not sure I understand the Court's question."
1994.93-986,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,793.958,809.337,"Well, you're saying that you would assume... I interpreted this from your answer... that if there were an expenditure limitation, that a disclosure requirement might be valid."
1994.93-986,0,20917,david_a_goldberger,,809.337,814.889,"Well, a disclosure requirement, I believe a disclosure requirement to the election commission would be appropriate."
1994.93-986,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,824.096,830.416,Do you think it's constitutional to require that anytime anybody prints a leaflet they disclose that to an elections commission?
1994.93-986,0,20917,david_a_goldberger,,830.416,833.118,"No, I believe that's not so."
1994.93-986,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,848.712,857.199,So the constitutionality of such a prohibition would depend on some minimum to be selected by the legislature?
1994.93-986,0,20917,david_a_goldberger,,857.199,857.651,No--
1994.93-986,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,857.651,860.936,Could the legislature suggest 25... choose $25?
1994.93-986,0,20917,david_a_goldberger,,860.936,897.526,"--I believe, Your Honor, that the minimum has constitutional... has a constitutional element to the extent that it is a minimum which interferes with the ability of street corner leafleters to disseminate their views and to articulate their views, and for others that have a legitimate basis for remaining anonymous because of their fear of retaliation, the kind of retaliation which the justice below suggested might have existed in this case, that there is anonymity and that any threshold requirement has to leave room for that anonymity."
1994.93-986,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,992.02,1000.843,"What about the First Bank of Boston, the Bellotti case, where the Court said that that law was unconstitutional but a disclosure requirement would be okay?"
1994.93-986,0,20917,david_a_goldberger,,1006.08,1012.151,--I believe that the Court should draw a line between individuals like McIntyre and corporations.
1994.93-986,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1012.151,1014.52,What about rich individuals versus poor corporations?
1994.93-986,0,20917,david_a_goldberger,,1014.52,1015.153,It seems to me--
1994.93-986,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1074.408,1080.712,"Under the Arizona statute, do you have to disclose the names of major donors on the leaflet itself?"
1994.93-986,0,20917,david_a_goldberger,,1080.712,1092.436,"--As I read the new statute, Your Honor, you disclose the name of one donor, the major donor, one or two donors who have contributed a substantial sum of money on the leaflet."
1994.93-986,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1106.696,1109.748,"But you suggest it may not have been a useful step, if you--"
1994.93-986,0,20917,david_a_goldberger,,1109.748,1110.865,"Well, it seems to me--"
1994.93-986,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1110.865,1111.683,--it's constitutional.
1994.93-986,0,20917,david_a_goldberger,,1111.683,1128.959,"--I don't have any difficulty in compelling the name of the political committee to be placed on the leaflet, and I also don't have any difficulty with substantial contributors being compelled to disclose their expenditures and contributions to the Election Campaign Commission."
1994.93-986,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1128.959,1136.815,"Well, certainly some of our cases have said that organizations couldn't be required to disclose the names of their members, the NAACP, for example."
1994.93-986,0,20917,david_a_goldberger,,1136.815,1149.707,"That's correct, Your Honor, and we rely on those cases, but I believe that the State statute in Ohio contains no exception whatsoever, and the difficulty with the statute is that it's a flat ban on anonymous leafleting."
1994.93-986,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1149.707,1164.568,"Well, why can't it be justified on the possibility of fraud, libel, slander, that obtains in that sort of thing, and that the identification permits that sort of action where it's warranted?"
1994.93-986,0,20917,david_a_goldberger,,1164.568,1172.488,"Well, it seems to me, Your Honor, that the State has valid libel and fraud laws, and it can use those laws."
1994.93-986,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1173.105,1176.107,"Well, but how can it use them if it doesn't know who published the statement?"
1994.93-986,0,20917,david_a_goldberger,,1176.107,1187.832,"--Well, first of all, Your Honor, to quote the... well, first of all, to quote the State's brief, prevaricators cannot be expected to point a beacon at their own lies."
1994.93-986,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1203.876,1206.395,To prevaricate isn't the only thing.
1994.93-986,0,20917,david_a_goldberger,,1208.911,1221.738,"Well, Your Honor, libel is unlikely in a referendum election, or at least the kind of libel that this Court should be... how do you... it is... I believe it's impossible to libel a referendum, to the ex--"
1994.93-986,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1221.738,1228.908,What if you said the school superintendent has deliberately misrepresented the need for this budget bill?
1994.93-986,0,20917,david_a_goldberger,,1228.908,1234.562,"--Well, I will say that I believe that sounds a great deal like political advocacy to me."
1994.93-986,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1241.984,1247.286,He can't file it against an anonymous leafleter if he doesn't know who wrote the leaflet.
1994.93-986,0,20917,david_a_goldberger,,1247.286,1256.744,"--But he will find out, if necessary, by going to the... if a disclosure requirement is imposed, by going to the Election Campaign--"
1994.93-986,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1256.744,1259.244,But the State of Ohio hasn't chosen a disclosure--
1994.93-986,0,20917,david_a_goldberger,,1259.244,1259.613,--No.
1994.93-986,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1264.148,1273.253,"--Well, and I'm saying, what's wrong with it, because if the thing is libelous, the person who is libeled ought to know who it was so that he can have some recourse."
1994.93-986,0,20917,david_a_goldberger,,1273.253,1299.755,"Your Honor, I will agree that there is a State interest in ferreting out individuals who have engaged in libel which affect the election process, but I don't believe that the court can do it at the expense of individuals who are engaged in pure speech, who wish to remain anonymous, and who will otherwise not distribute their leaflets or make their political statements in political literature."
1994.93-986,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1299.755,1301.623,"In this case, she didn't wish to remain anonymous."
1994.93-986,0,20917,david_a_goldberger,,1307.01,1307.86,That's true.
1994.93-986,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1314.564,1322.02,"You never made a claim, I take it, that there was any such interest as was recognized in NAACP in Alabama."
1994.93-986,0,20917,david_a_goldberger,,1332.292,1344.017,"--Well, going into this thing, it didn't appear that that was the case, and her position was, before the commission, that she had attempted to comply with the statute, and it was basically a trap for the unwary."
1994.93-986,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1385.094,1398.27,"Wouldn't she have been in exactly the same position if she didn't have to put her name on the leaflet, but she did have to register with the election commission so that mean school official that... could have found out her name that way?"
1994.93-986,0,20917,david_a_goldberger,,1398.27,1424.652,"Well, Your Honor, there are going to be... in my view, individuals who do not expend sufficient funds to make them legitimate targets of campaign expenditure laws should be left alone, and she would not have... making a leaflet on a home computer, duplicating at the local copy store would not have placed her within the reach of an appropriately drafted statute."
1994.93-986,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1424.652,1440.43,"So you would have no difficulty with a procedure where, if there were a libelous pamphlet, the attorney for the plaintiff could take the deposition of everybody who made a disclosure to the financing authorities and asked them, did you print this leaflet, what leaflets have you printed?"
1994.93-986,0,20917,david_a_goldberger,,1440.43,1461.776,"Well, it seems to me, Your Honor, when you have... if you have... now, we're talking New York Times v. Sullivan libel, I assume, but to the extent that you have some kind of a criminal libel, you have law enforcement tools which are readily available with or without these kinds of statutes, and anyone can be asked by an appropriate law enforcement official who--"
1994.93-986,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1461.776,1468.263,"Well, I'm not familiar with proceedings in which policemen help plaintiffs' lawyers enforce civil libel actions."
1994.93-986,0,20917,david_a_goldberger,,1468.263,1468.83,"--Oh, I see."
1994.93-986,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1470.782,1474.084,And it seems to me that's an even worse specter.
1994.93-986,0,20917,david_a_goldberger,,1474.084,1480.905,"Well, Your Honor, I don't believe it's the function of the State election laws to help civil libel litigants."
1994.93-986,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1482.84,1493.565,"I thought you were justifying the answers to some of your questions and to some of these problems that we confront by saying that there are public disclosure requirements for many, many pamphlets."
1994.93-986,0,20917,david_a_goldberger,,1493.565,1503.67,"--But the purpose of any public disclosure requirement, Your Honor, is to assist the State in making sure that there is not an election fraud which will affect the outcome of an election."
1994.93-986,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1514.978,1515.661,Can I ask a question?
1994.93-986,0,20917,david_a_goldberger,,1534.456,1535.006,Right.
1994.93-986,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1535.006,1549.233,"Now, suppose the State has an enforcement mechanism, and I think this is a question that's been asked before, but I... the enforcement mechanism says, you have to sign a paper, send it to the commission, and say you've spent no more than $10,000."

1994.93-986,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1560.521,1560.956,All right.
1994.93-986,0,20917,david_a_goldberger,,1583.386,1590.642,"Well, I don't believe they can... I don't think they can do that under circumstances in which the individual can legitimately claim a need for anonymity."
1994.93-986,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1590.642,1592.692,"--Oh, so in other words, they could say,"
1994.93-986,0,20917,david_a_goldberger,,1599.331,1604.216,"I believe... well, at that point we would be dealing with this Court's holding in Brown v.--"
1994.93-986,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1604.216,1626.312,"But what's the... what is the practical, that is the functional... what's the reasoning by which it would make sense to say, you can in fact list all these things by name, you have to list, I spent the $10,000 on A, on B, on C, but the commission can't say, and attach as appendix 1 the actual pamphlet so we know that you really did it?"
1994.93-986,0,20917,david_a_goldberger,,1626.312,1634.299,"--I believe, Your Honor, that is the problem that this Court faced in the disclosure requirements with respect to the unpopular political parties."
1994.93-986,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1638.386,1640.503,Because--
1994.93-986,0,20917,david_a_goldberger,,1640.503,1647.808,"Because of the interest in anonymity, and to the extent that there is an interest, she must be left alone."
1994.93-986,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1649.041,1651.593,--But you have not made an anonymity claim.
1994.93-986,0,20917,david_a_goldberger,,1658.681,1661.499,"--Yes, but we're now... the questions that have been put to me, Your Honor--"
1994.93-986,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1661.499,1673.191,"No, but your answer, as I understood, your answer to that question is that the point of limit comes when the individual can assert that kind of a Brown anonymity claim, and you don't assert it in this case."
1994.93-986,0,20917,david_a_goldberger,,1673.191,1678.578,"--Your Honor, because the statute is a flat ban, the statute falls of its own weight."
1994.93-986,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1691.254,1713.268,"So you're saying that in this case... let's take this case, that if there were an identification requirement, but the law provided in any case in which an individual can make a specialized showing of danger from disclosure, some State official can excuse the individual from compliance, that that would be a constitutional statute?"
1994.93-986,0,20917,david_a_goldberger,,1713.268,1734.681,"Your Honor, to the extent that Buckley v. Valeo allows expenditure disclosures, it would seem to me that to the extent that the State is trying to learn about expenditure disclosure and... expenditures in election, and not trying to regulate the content of protected leaflets, yes, it would be a valid requirement, to the--"
1994.93-986,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1734.681,1743.703,"Well, would that be the proper inference from the statute that I just described to you, that the State's motives were benign, not malign?"
1994.93-986,0,20917,david_a_goldberger,,1743.703,1751.976,"--Well, if it's not benign, I don't understand why they're asking for the information, why they need the information."
1994.93-986,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1751.976,1769.004,"No, but in the case of my hypothetical, in which the statute contains the circuit breaker, would you infer by virtue of the circuit breaker's existence that the State's interest was a constitutionally cognizable one?"
1994.93-986,0,20917,david_a_goldberger,,1769.004,1772.039,I believe so in candidate elections.

1994.93-986,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1861.475,1867.879,"--Did the Court say there didn't have to be any line, so that people who don't spend any money still have to report?"
1994.93-986,1,16981,andrew_l_sutter,,1867.879,1890.911,"Well, Your Honor, in Bellotti the Court decided that there was no distinction, especially in the context of ballot measure elections, between corporations and individuals, that their First Amendment rights were coextensive, so I don't understand how there could be a principled basis upon which one could require a corporation to disclose just because they were better heeled and might be able to communicate more effectively."
1994.93-986,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1890.911,1908.04,"My distinction wasn't in terms of the character of the identity, but of... does there need to be some point below which, if you're not... if the concern is big spending, mustn't you have some limit to leave out the little people like Ms. McIntyre?"
1994.93-986,1,16981,andrew_l_sutter,,1908.04,1930.386,"No, Your Honor, because the only concern before the Court in Buckley was not just campaign contributions and expenditures, some sort of threshold to distinguish big money from small money, the Court specifically recognized, as a distinct and independent compelling interest, the disclosure of information that was important to the electorate to help them evaluate candidates."
1994.93-986,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1963.377,1969.53,What interest do you want to rely on here to support the State's ban?
1994.93-986,1,16981,andrew_l_sutter,,1969.53,1971.23,"Your Honor, there are two."

1994.93-986,1,16981,andrew_l_sutter,,1984.123,1992.46,"--Yes, there are, Your Honor, but these circumstances are very similar to Buckley, for example, where the Court recognized the existence of bribery statutes."
1994.93-986,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2021.296,2032.021,"I mean, I guess you'd say that Ohio could require, had we been back in those days, the disclosure of the writers of all of the Federalist Papers."
1994.93-986,1,16981,andrew_l_sutter,,2032.021,2032.604,"No, Your Honor."
1994.93-986,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2039.591,2046.428,"Well, they were circulated in support of a referendum on whether the Constitution should be adopted or ratified."
1994.93-986,1,16981,andrew_l_sutter,,2050.899,2053.85,"Your Honor, the circumstances then were somewhat different."

1994.93-986,1,16981,andrew_l_sutter,,2119.626,2120.243,"Yes, Your Honor."
1994.93-986,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2134.636,2136.587,How about Mrs. McIntyre's address?
1994.93-986,1,16981,andrew_l_sutter,,2139.539,2141.323,"--Yes, Your Honor, and that's required by the law."
1994.93-986,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2141.323,2144.777,"All right, and how about her partisan affiliation?"
1994.93-986,1,16981,andrew_l_sutter,,2144.777,2150.145,"Your Honor, we think there is a point at which too much information would cross the line."

1994.93-986,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2207.018,2224.043,"Well, Mr. Sutter, I would have thought if the First Amendment stood for anything at all, it stood for my right to put out a flier at a local school board election on an issue that I cared about without identifying myself."
1994.93-986,1,16981,andrew_l_sutter,,2239.655,2247.826,"--Your Honor, the State would acknowledge that there's core political speech involved here, but there's a difference, we think, between the ability to deliver--"

1994.93-986,1,16981,andrew_l_sutter,,2251.813,2253.999,"--Your Honor, the court below--"
1994.93-986,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2253.999,2256.95,And do you think the court below applied strict scrutiny?
1994.93-986,1,16981,andrew_l_sutter,,2256.95,2274.56,"--No, Your Honor, the court did not apply strict scrutiny, but under the circumstances, we believe, regardless of what test the court applies, whether it be the flexible standard under Anderson v. Celebrezze, or strict scrutiny, this statute passes constitutional muster because it serves compelling interests."
1994.93-986,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2274.56,2277.947,"Well, do you think it's appropriate to apply a flexible standard to core political speech?"
1994.93-986,1,16981,andrew_l_sutter,,2277.947,2305.014,"Your Honor, I think when there's a competing interest of equal importance, as there is in this case, protecting the right to vote, that a flexible approach has appeal in that it permits the court to measure the amount of intrusion against the interest of the State, but under the circumstances, the court never has to reach that question, because we believe that the statute involves serves compelling State interests, and addressing--"

1994.93-986,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2305.964,2324.726,"--recognize that to be compatible with the First Amendment there would at least have to be an exception for the Socialist Worker Party kind of case, where the person said, if I put my name... if I put my name on this piece of literature, I may be subject to assault, or some danger?"
1994.93-986,1,16981,andrew_l_sutter,,2324.726,2330.23,"Your Honor, that really goes to an overbreadth question, and we do believe--"
1994.93-986,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2330.23,2334.451,"Well, suppose Ms. McIntyre, instead of saying,"
1994.93-986,1,16981,andrew_l_sutter,,2349.226,2357.316,"--Your Honor, we think that the Ohio courts would construe the statute in constitutional fashion, just as this Court did in the Buckley case."
1994.93-986,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2357.316,2359.366,Does there have to be an exception of that type?
1994.93-986,1,16981,andrew_l_sutter,,2359.366,2361.434,We think that that would be appropriate.
1994.93-986,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2362.451,2362.834,Necessary.
1994.93-986,1,16981,andrew_l_sutter,,2366.755,2375.528,"--We would concede even necessary, but we don't think it's fatal to the constitutionality of the statute that it's silent on the subject, any more than it was fatal to the statute in Buckley."
1994.93-986,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2410.015,2416.355,"So if someone feared retaliation and wanted to keep anonymity, they'd go to a court and file a lawsuit?"
1994.93-986,1,16981,andrew_l_sutter,,2422.508,2428.162,"Your Honor, I think there would be an opportunity for something like a Jane Doe lawsuit, but I don't think this is so different--"
1994.93-986,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2428.162,2431.114,Sounds to me like that would deter at least a rather shy person.

1994.93-986,1,16981,andrew_l_sutter,,2491.786,2492.753,"Yes, Your Honor."
1994.93-986,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2492.753,2499.925,"--Justice O'Connor brought up the tradition of pamphleteering, going back to the Federalist Papers."
1994.93-986,1,16981,andrew_l_sutter,,2505.495,2506.195,"Yes, Your Honor."
1994.93-986,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2506.195,2512.249,"About, it was traditional, accepted that you could have unobtrusive signs on your own property."
1994.93-986,1,16981,andrew_l_sutter,,2518.886,2520.355,I think there is a tradition.
1994.93-986,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2568.252,2570.954,"Well, your argument, basically I guess you make two arguments."
1994.93-986,1,16981,andrew_l_sutter,,2597.605,2603.592,"Well, Your Honor, we can't completely control the conduct of anyone under these circumstances."
1994.93-986,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2603.592,2607.711,"No, but is there reason to believe that this is going to be effective in the cases that you posit?"
1994.93-986,1,16981,andrew_l_sutter,,2607.711,2610.996,"Yes, we do, and it's been followed on a regular basis."
1994.93-986,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2631.592,2654.692,"No, but the State's interest has to be evaluated in a realistic fashion, and I guess you're telling me you have found no instances, there are no instances on the record or disclosed in any of the amicus briefs here, in which that kind of double fraud has been perpetrated, and therefore has rendered the State's interest one of hope, rather than of realistic expectation."
1994.93-986,1,16981,andrew_l_sutter,,2654.692,2656.56,There's nothing in this record to demonstrate that.
1994.93-986,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2734.06,2743.582,Do you want to say anything more about the strength of the State's interest in requiring this?
1994.93-986,1,16981,andrew_l_sutter,,2802.788,2803.271,All right.
1994.93-986,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2859.241,2862.86,"Mr. Sutter, what's the pedigree of provisions like this?"
1994.93-986,1,16981,andrew_l_sutter,,2872.148,2893.462,"--Your Honor, I believe that these laws started to appear in the early portion of the 20th Century, around 1910, 1915, at the same time that other types of campaign reform was underway, as the Court noted in Burson, with the Australian ballot procedure, and these particular statutes have extended on through the years."
1994.93-986,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2898.716,2900.318,And they go back that far.
1994.93-986,1,16981,andrew_l_sutter,,2900.318,2901.135,"Yes, Your Honor."
1994.93-986,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2926.885,2935.222,Do you think the disclosure requirement in Buckley was intended to help the voter evaluate the message that was being paid for by the political organization?
1994.93-986,1,16981,andrew_l_sutter,,2935.222,2935.741,"Yes, Your Honor."
1994.93-986,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2965.843,2966.443,"Where he gets the money, yes."
1994.93-986,1,16981,andrew_l_sutter,,2966.443,2967.86,--His associations.
1994.93-986,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2968.879,2974.199,"But didn't Buckley focus on candidates, support of candidates as distinguished from issues?"
1994.93-986,1,16981,andrew_l_sutter,,2988.191,3001.1,"--Your Honor, the Court did say that, but in the context of Buckley, the first answer is that there are no referenda or initiatives, actual issues that go on the ballot, in Federal law."
1994.93-986,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3047.979,3051.664,"No, but it was surely was to support or defeat an issue of some importance."
1994.93-986,1,16981,andrew_l_sutter,,3051.664,3054.632,"Yes, Your Honor, but it was not designed--"
1994.93-986,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3054.632,3055.984,And that's what your statute pertains to.
1994.93-986,1,16981,andrew_l_sutter,,3055.984,3064.59,"--Your Honor, what this statute pertains to, it's not attempting to control public discussion of public policy or foreign affairs."

1994.93-986,1,16981,andrew_l_sutter,,3131.651,3149.613,"--But the Court makes a point... in Buckley, in Bellotti, in Citizens Against Rent Control v. Berkeley, the Court makes a point of indicating that disclosure requirements are the least intrusive method for regulating lections in this way."
1994.93-986,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3180.799,3210.268,"You know, in this context, though, it almost seems that on... when the leaflet speaks to the merits of a particular issue, as this does, that the electorate can take into consideration the fact that there is no identification of the speaker attached to the message and can conclude, if it wishes, that therefore it should be discounted."
1994.93-986,1,16981,andrew_l_sutter,,3233.117,3242.39,"Your Honor, I think that is a difficult question, and one that the legislature wrestled with, and I think this Court in a way wrestled with it in Buckley."
