1996.95-259,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,3.913,We'll hear argument now in No. 95-259.
1996.95-259,0,19009,constantine_john_gekas,,12.629,15.441,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1996.95-259,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,114.017,123.504,"Mr. Waxman, what would be an example of the kind of a person... the... the kind of job they held... who was counted under your view but not counted under the Seventy Circuit's view?"
1996.95-259,0,19009,constantine_john_gekas,,123.504,128.029,"--Well, under our view, all employees who have an ongoing employment relationship would be counted."
1996.95-259,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,155.717,171.439,"Well, what if the employee is... shows up for work one day a month to do some accounting work and, therefore, is kept on the employer's so-called overall list of employees to do this stuff one day a month... that's enough--"
1996.95-259,0,19009,constantine_john_gekas,,171.439,173.229,"Yes, it is, because the--"
1996.95-259,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,173.229,174.231,--to count for the whole month?
1996.95-259,0,19009,constantine_john_gekas,,174.231,174.581,--That's right.
1996.95-259,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,177.362,186.909,"Well, what if the person is listed, hasn't been taken off the computer base, but in fact hasn't done any work for, let's say, 4 months; do we count that person for the 4 months?"
1996.95-259,0,19009,constantine_john_gekas,,186.909,194.272,"--Well, Your Honor, I think that that focuses on the question of whether or not, during the time that the person is not there, that person is an employee."
1996.95-259,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,228.697,230.176,But there are some questions?
1996.95-259,0,19009,constantine_john_gekas,,230.176,232.008,"Yes, it's questions, but question--"
1996.95-259,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,232.008,242.224,"Do you completely endorse the Department of Labor's regulations, adopting the payroll method for the Family Leave Act?"
1996.95-259,0,19009,constantine_john_gekas,,242.224,242.484,"--Yes, we have, generally."
1996.95-259,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,243.856,244.066,Uh-huh.
1996.95-259,0,19009,constantine_john_gekas,,244.066,244.447,"Yes, we do."
1996.95-259,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,281.895,294.684,"What does it... what does it mean when the statute says that the EEOC... it not only does not specifically confer rulemaking authority on the EEOC, but it specifically denies rulemaking authority to the EEOC?"
1996.95-259,0,19009,constantine_john_gekas,,306.96,312.927,"--Well, clearly, under the case law, as I understand it, that is a distinction about the degree of deference that is given."
1996.95-259,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,337.781,338.632,I said that first.
1996.95-259,0,19009,constantine_john_gekas,,338.632,350.432,"--Yes, you did, indeed."
1996.95-259,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,377.761,379.603,Is it Strick... are you saying Strickland or Skidmore?
1996.95-259,0,19009,constantine_john_gekas,,379.944,380.565,"--Skidmore, that's right."
1996.95-259,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,401.121,401.262,"Well, is that any different?"
1996.95-259,0,19009,constantine_john_gekas,,417.886,419.025,"--Well, that's--"
1996.95-259,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,419.025,422.938,"You know, Williston and Corbin, and if... if... you give certain deference to their views."
1996.95-259,0,19009,constantine_john_gekas,,424.741,430.214,"--Well, that kind of detailed criteria is not contained in the more recent decisions on that."
1996.95-259,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,439.07,439.711,Okay.
1996.95-259,0,19009,constantine_john_gekas,,439.711,440.662,--whether or not--
1996.95-259,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,440.662,445.353,"You're talking about rational force and not authoritative effect, which is what Chevron talks about?"
1996.95-259,0,19009,constantine_john_gekas,,445.353,459.915,"--Well, I'm saying... I'm saying that if the... if the test is the Skidmore test, then it's... this regulation satisfies it, because it has rational force, internally coherent, sensibly based on the statutory language."
1996.95-259,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,471.983,479.38,"Mr.... Mr. Gekas, may I interrupt just to ask if I understood your answer to Justice O'Connor correctly?"
1996.95-259,0,19009,constantine_john_gekas,,490.906,491.207,--Yes.
1996.95-259,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,491.207,496.559,"And then we got back... but what you're saying is that, suppose there were no EEOC, that is the interpretation--"
1996.95-259,0,19009,constantine_john_gekas,,496.559,496.75,Yes.
1996.95-259,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,496.75,497.641,--the one that they put forward--
1996.95-259,0,19009,constantine_john_gekas,,497.641,497.871,Yes.
1996.95-259,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,497.871,499.772,--is also the one that you put forward?
1996.95-259,0,19009,constantine_john_gekas,,512.591,513.042,Yes.
1996.95-259,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,513.042,515.986,So someone... the computer had to take their name off the payroll.
1996.95-259,0,19009,constantine_john_gekas,,524.041,525.313,Yes.
1996.95-259,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,531.299,533.0,"No, no, not... not the retaliation."
1996.95-259,0,19009,constantine_john_gekas,,535.363,535.952,--Yes.
1996.95-259,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,535.952,538.415,--as working for that week--
1996.95-259,0,19009,constantine_john_gekas,,538.415,538.916,Yes.
1996.95-259,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,538.916,542.527,--when that person is discharged or quits on Thursday?
1996.95-259,0,19009,constantine_john_gekas,,542.527,542.908,Yes.
1996.95-259,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,545.372,545.582,Yes.
1996.95-259,0,19009,constantine_john_gekas,,545.582,547.172,--if I understand the focus of your question.
1996.95-259,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,577.221,593.632,"Now... now, I would like to ask what sense it would make to take your person who comes in once a month for one hour and say... count that person, but not count the person who has worked, let's say, 10 hours a day for 4 days, but leaves the job permanently on the fifth day?"
1996.95-259,0,19009,constantine_john_gekas,,593.632,603.92,"--Well, with any reasonable test, there are going to be hypotheticals, I think, perhaps more infrequent in practice than not, that suggest that, at the fringes, maybe the rule doesn't have intuitive sense."
1996.95-259,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,626.696,632.069,"But, more specifically, you're talking about the portion of the scheme that creates a small business exemption."
1996.95-259,0,19009,constantine_john_gekas,,661.128,661.338,Sure.
1996.95-259,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,661.338,662.189,That doesn't seem to me to make much sense.
1996.95-259,0,19009,constantine_john_gekas,,662.189,665.642,"Well, the reason for it is because Congress had to draw a line somewhere."
1996.95-259,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,678.722,681.603,"Well, it certainly could be a bright-line test to say that the term,"
1996.95-259,0,19009,constantine_john_gekas,,691.74,698.005,"--If there's any experience from this case that we can gain, it is that that test, the working day test, is not a bright-line test."
1996.95-259,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,703.4,708.212,"Well, it may have been difficult to calculate, but the rule was clear."
1996.95-259,0,19009,constantine_john_gekas,,708.212,708.663,--Well--
1996.95-259,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,708.663,713.227,"You could determine each person for each working day, could you not?"
1996.95-259,0,19009,constantine_john_gekas,,713.227,720.083,"--Well, when I say statement of... of bright-line rule, I don't mean just one that can be easily stated and capsulized in a phrase."
1996.95-259,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,723.784,726.826,"Well, that's a different rationale, ease of administration."
1996.95-259,0,19009,constantine_john_gekas,,734.461,745.15,"Well, I suggest... well, I suggest that, to the extent that the Senate debates focussed on ease of administration... and they did to a great extent... that's what I mean when I say ""a bright-line test""."
1996.95-259,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,745.15,754.617,"Under your proposed rule or interpretation, I take it that an individual could be employed by three or four different employers?"
1996.95-259,0,19009,constantine_john_gekas,,754.617,755.445,Absolutely correct.
1996.95-259,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,814.168,819.211,"Well, I am troubled, though, by what we do with this language, ""for each working day""."
1996.95-259,0,19009,constantine_john_gekas,,827.608,834.301,"--Well, the... I guess our point is that you can't read, ""for each working day"", just in isolation from the rest of the statute."
1996.95-259,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,856.757,858.467,"Thank you, Mr. Gekas."
1996.95-259,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,860.4,871.787,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1996.95-259,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,918.472,921.414,"What does... what does the term ""part-time employee"" mean?"
1996.95-259,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,924.597,928.7,"Well, I would... I would think that that would be a tautology."
1996.95-259,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,930.834,935.455,"But you... you suggested that all employees are full-time employees, even if they're part-time employees."
1996.95-259,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,935.455,937.438,"--Oh, to... to the contrary, Justice Scalia."
1996.95-259,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,970.67,976.314,You... you... you can produce absurd results under either theory; will... will you concede that?
1996.95-259,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,976.314,976.755,--I will--
1996.95-259,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,976.755,978.026,Either theory will produce some?
1996.95-259,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,978.026,980.639,"--I will concede, because even the devil can quote Scripture."
1996.95-259,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1072.889,1082.486,"But under your test, a person who is hired to come in one day a month and do some special accounting work is an employee for every day of the month, I gather?"
1996.95-259,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1082.486,1086.239,"Well, I'm... I'm with you part of the way, Justice O'Connor."
1996.95-259,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1109.527,1110.426,--the rest of the month.
1996.95-259,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1110.426,1134.352,"--Or the rest of the month... but has a employment relationship such that his job responsibilities, as an employee... he's not an independent contractor, he's an employee who works 1 day a month... the answer is yes, he is an employee for the rest of those periods of time if, applying the traditional standards that this Court applied in NLRB v. Town & Country, and Nationwide Insurance v. Darden, an employment relationship exists."
1996.95-259,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1202.514,1210.26,But someone could be an employee... a part-time employee is an employee for purposes of bringing a Title VII complaint.
1996.95-259,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1236.337,1236.597,--Of the counting.
1996.95-259,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1236.597,1247.796,"--And on that question, I would like to ask you, on your reading, what purpose Congress could have had... you say, Well, we do give meaning to this phrase, ""for each working day""."
1996.95-259,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1260.156,1261.418,I hope I can answer all these questions.
1996.95-259,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1262.68,1263.441,That's the only question I asked.
1996.95-259,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1263.441,1269.395,"--It is not our position that if a person quits on Friday, that person isn't counted for the week."
1996.95-259,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1293.801,1296.754,"What... well, first, tell me what... what meaning you give to those words--"
1996.95-259,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1296.754,1297.104,We--
1996.95-259,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1297.104,1298.396,--because you just gave me an answer that I thought--
1996.95-259,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1298.396,1298.994,--Okay--
1996.95-259,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1298.994,1301.097,--is counter to what you say in your brief.
1996.95-259,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1301.097,1308.571,"--We, like the Respondents, give the same meaning to that word, which means that, in determining whether there are 15... the issue is 15 what +/?"
1996.95-259,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1352.73,1353.921,"Well, ""weeks"" alone would do that."
1996.95-259,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1356.984,1357.214,"--Oh, no."
1996.95-259,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1397.243,1401.965,"That's fine, but that difference would have nothing to do with seasonality versus nonseasonality."
1996.95-259,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1401.965,1402.586,"Oh, I... I--"
1996.95-259,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1402.586,1407.949,"The 20-week provision, by itself, takes care of the seasonal worker problem."
1996.95-259,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1417.565,1417.875,--I--
1996.95-259,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1417.875,1420.717,"--""# each working day"" has anything to do with seasonality."
1996.95-259,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1420.717,1425.872,"--I... I have to... I have to respectfully disrespect... disagree with you, Justice Scalia."
1996.95-259,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1425.872,1426.703,"Yes, you do."
1996.95-259,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1430.615,1432.477,"I respect you, and I disagree with you."
1996.95-259,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1469.495,1470.875,"Well, I guess my concern is--"
1996.95-259,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1470.875,1471.215,It just applies an accounting method.
1996.95-259,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1471.215,1491.277,"--is how you read into it an employment relationship for each such day, and you find an employment relationship even in situations where somebody isn't there for months, but stays on some convenient, little payroll, in case, sometime in the future, hauled in to be a substitute for something or other."
1996.95-259,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1491.277,1501.095,"Well, in that instance, Your Honor, the Court would have to address the question of whether, in fact, that was an employee, applying whatever standard that this Court will announce in this case--"
1996.95-259,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1501.095,1503.346,"But applying your standard, it's an employee."
1996.95-259,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1503.346,1503.736,--It may--
1996.95-259,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1503.736,1504.878,He's on that employer's list--
1996.95-259,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1504.878,1505.469,--It may very well--
1996.95-259,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1505.469,1506.549,--and might come back some day.
1996.95-259,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1506.549,1508.051,--It may very well not be an employee.
1996.95-259,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1514.125,1519.059,"He expects to come back the first Tuesday of every summer, or at least occasionally during the year."
1996.95-259,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1519.059,1530.076,"--And my... my response to you is that if an employer chooses to operate his business that way, that is, by using large numbers of intermittent employees who come regularly but intermittently, that employer should--"
1996.95-259,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1530.076,1530.277,Not large numbers.
1996.95-259,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1543.836,1548.25,"--Well, I do think... with respect to the 14 and 15, there has to be a line anywhere."
1996.95-259,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1578.54,1584.114,"Mr. Waxman, may I take another example, which I take it might be a more common, seasonal practice?"
1996.95-259,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1623.768,1624.039,There--
1996.95-259,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1624.039,1627.681,And... and why wouldn't that run counter to what the Dirksen amendment was intended to do?
1996.95-259,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1627.681,1630.345,"--Well, this... this employer... there are a lot of plausible explanations."
1996.95-259,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1639.572,1639.802,"Well, let's assume it does come up."
1996.95-259,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1640.994,1641.935,--I--
1996.95-259,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1641.935,1642.967,It's... it's another marginal case.
1996.95-259,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1648.783,1661.63,"--If I were... if... I... I think a very creditable argument could be made in that instance, if I were litigating a case, that because Congress meant to exclude seasonal businesses, there was not an employment relationship during the intervening 11 months."
1996.95-259,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1661.63,1670.576,"Well, then... then what is the distinction you're drawing between Justice O'Connor's once a month... one day a month, and... and the one month a year?"
1996.95-259,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1677.321,1691.851,"Yes, I think... I think applying Federal law, construing the definition of employer as this Court will interpret it, this... a... a court... or the EEOC would have to determine whether there was in fact a real, ongoing employment relationship."
1996.95-259,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1693.653,1694.154,Mr. Waxman--
1996.95-259,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1704.092,1704.513,It--
1996.95-259,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1704.513,1706.943,We refer to the payroll method and the payroll.
1996.95-259,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1710.044,1713.978,"--There is no... to my knowledge, Justice Kennedy, there is no fixed method."
1996.95-259,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1720.765,1721.967,"I think you've answered the question, Mr. Waxman."
1996.95-259,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1721.967,1722.425,--Thank you.
1996.95-259,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1722.425,1724.418,"Mr. Falahee, we'll hear from you."
1996.95-259,2,37881,patrick_j_falahee_jr,,1724.418,1738.247,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1996.95-259,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1813.617,1815.939,"Mr. Falahee, was... was there any model for that?"
1996.95-259,2,37881,patrick_j_falahee_jr,,1836.492,1844.216,"--Your Honor, I'm not aware of any such... of any such prior statute that Congress would have looked to."
1996.95-259,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1860.378,1867.411,"Is there any similar exemption in the Fair Labor Standards Act of small business, 15 or more employers?"
1996.95-259,2,37881,patrick_j_falahee_jr,,1867.411,1871.985,"I'm aware of no... no exemption that's similar to... to this, Your Honor, no."
1996.95-259,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1891.857,1897.193,"Well, now, there is identical language now in the Family Leave Act, is there not?"
1996.95-259,2,37881,patrick_j_falahee_jr,,1897.193,1898.852,"Yes, Your Honor, there is."
1996.95-259,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1898.852,1900.795,And what is the result there?
1996.95-259,2,37881,patrick_j_falahee_jr,,1905.439,1906.972,Congress has--
1996.95-259,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1906.972,1909.502,"The... the payroll method is used, as it's called?"
1996.95-259,2,37881,patrick_j_falahee_jr,,1909.502,1916.969,--Congress has authorized the EEOC to promulgate regulations for purposes of the Family and Medical Leave Act.
1996.95-259,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1924.756,1933.681,"And that same construction, apparently, is going to apply in ADA and ADEA cases, as well?"
1996.95-259,2,37881,patrick_j_falahee_jr,,1933.681,1935.541,Arguably it could.
1996.95-259,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1956.275,1966.423,"But it is strange, is it not, that at the end of the day, you might end up with the payroll method used under the Family Leave Act, ADA, ADAEA, and a different one under Title VII."
1996.95-259,2,37881,patrick_j_falahee_jr,,1968.342,1975.849,The possibility of arriving at inconsistent results does indeed exist.
1996.95-259,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1999.024,2007.92,Do the Family Medical Leave Act regulations give a clear definition of what an employment relationship consists of?
1996.95-259,2,37881,patrick_j_falahee_jr,,2007.92,2009.863,"I don't believe they do, Your Honor."
1996.95-259,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2011.703,2011.974,May I--
1996.95-259,2,37881,patrick_j_falahee_jr,,2045.546,2048.068,"I would... I would agree with that, Your Honor."
1996.95-259,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2048.068,2048.719,I would think you would.
1996.95-259,2,37881,patrick_j_falahee_jr,,2073.038,2074.467,"Yes, Your Honor--"
1996.95-259,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2074.467,2079.302,On what those words... at least some legislators... thought they meant.
1996.95-259,2,37881,patrick_j_falahee_jr,,2079.302,2081.052,--Yes.
1996.95-259,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2151.448,2154.71,May... may I ask you two questions that I'd just like to get your views on?
1996.95-259,2,37881,patrick_j_falahee_jr,,2163.616,2164.637,"No, they do not, Your Honor."
1996.95-259,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2164.637,2172.625,"You could have two sets of work force that... one works two days and the other works 3 days, but on each of the days, they'll be 15, but they're a different 15 every--"
1996.95-259,2,37881,patrick_j_falahee_jr,,2172.625,2184.202,"Except... except for... where I would differ with... with Your Honor on that is I think there can only be a single work force, not multiple work forces."
1996.95-259,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2184.202,2186.242,--No... but why not?
1996.95-259,2,37881,patrick_j_falahee_jr,,2200.743,2202.266,"Yes, it would."
1996.95-259,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2202.266,2203.004,Okay.
1996.95-259,2,37881,patrick_j_falahee_jr,,2203.004,2203.325,"Yes, it would."
1996.95-259,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2205.588,2214.426,"Then my second question is, is it not possible that the words, ""for each working day"", simply fulfill the function of deciding how long the workweek is?"
1996.95-259,2,37881,patrick_j_falahee_jr,,2223.051,2227.833,"--That would be a... a permissible interpretation of the phrase, ""for each working day""."
1996.95-259,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2227.833,2231.106,"And without that phrase in it, you wouldn't know whether the whole week had been covered or not?"
1996.95-259,2,37881,patrick_j_falahee_jr,,2235.059,2238.289,"I... I... I don't believe there would be a way to determine that, Your Honor, no."
1996.95-259,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2239.981,2246.547,"Well, it's been... it's been argued, or suggested, that the payroll method is much easier to work with."
1996.95-259,2,37881,patrick_j_falahee_jr,,2272.894,2281.018,"--Well, I... I believe Your... Your Honor's question presents a hypothetical similar to the one suggested by... by Justice O'Connor."
1996.95-259,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2300.422,2313.389,"Is there some clerical reason that people are kept on the payroll, because there's a certain amount of information, W-2 forms, et cetera, that it... it's... so it's just much easier to carry them forward than to keep putting them back on and taking them off every time?"
1996.95-259,2,37881,patrick_j_falahee_jr,,2313.389,2329.551,"Well, while... while an... an employer is required to maintain certain information for tax purposes, particularly to generate W-2 forms at the end of the year, I think the... the answer to... to Your Honor's question would really depend on what type of a payroll service was... was being utilized."
1996.95-259,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2344.772,2358.252,"While... while I have you, in connection with Justice Stevens's question... because I was thinking of the same thing when the Solicitor General was arguing... suppose you had an employer that worked a 10-hour day, 4 days a week."
1996.95-259,2,37881,patrick_j_falahee_jr,,2366.306,2368.189,"Under... under our approach, yes."
1996.95-259,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2370.129,2375.152,"Because, 4 working days, and they're there all... for each working day?"
1996.95-259,2,37881,patrick_j_falahee_jr,,2375.152,2376.524,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1996.95-259,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2376.524,2384.82,"But they wouldn't be covered if... if the... if the business stayed open a fifth day and brought in only one employee, right?"
1996.95-259,2,37881,patrick_j_falahee_jr,,2394.377,2400.241,"While the... while the result is theoretically possible, I think the issue that--"
1996.95-259,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2400.241,2401.38,It's very smart.
1996.95-259,2,37881,patrick_j_falahee_jr,,2405.466,2411.23,--I... I... I believe that the... that the hypothetical Your Honor posits raises a somewhat different question.
1996.95-259,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2439.259,2446.984,"But, Mr. Falahee, I'm confused by your answer to Justice Kennedy's question, because I thought that it would be the other way on your method."
1996.95-259,2,37881,patrick_j_falahee_jr,,2462.054,2463.837,"No, Your Honor."
1996.95-259,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2487.554,2488.654,Who doesn't come in on Friday.
1996.95-259,2,37881,patrick_j_falahee_jr,,2519.736,2520.147,No.
1996.95-259,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2528.491,2537.768,"So, in any week, somebody who comes in 4 days a week, 10 hours a day, is not counted as an employee for that week for this purpose?"
1996.95-259,2,37881,patrick_j_falahee_jr,,2537.768,2541.961,--That... that individual would be counted for the days he or she worked.
1996.95-259,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2541.961,2547.713,Is... but that individual would never be someone who has worked for each working day.
1996.95-259,2,37881,patrick_j_falahee_jr,,2562.144,2571.969,"That... under that... under that set of facts, carried forward for 52 weeks, that... that person would not be considered an... an employer for--"
1996.95-259,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2571.969,2576.533,"The employer would not be covered by Title VII, because it would not have 15 or more employees?"
1996.95-259,2,37881,patrick_j_falahee_jr,,2576.533,2577.522,--That is... that is correct.
1996.95-259,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2577.522,2579.004,But that... that's true unless--
1996.95-259,2,37881,patrick_j_falahee_jr,,2586.338,2594.546,The same... the same individual need not report each day to be considered an employee.
1996.95-259,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2594.546,2597.1,They're an employee on each day that he or she reports.
1996.95-259,2,37881,patrick_j_falahee_jr,,2597.1,2597.879,That's correct.
1996.95-259,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2597.879,2605.614,And they can be... you can have 15 on Monday and an entirely different 15 on Tuesday and Wednesday and so forth and still come within the statute?
1996.95-259,2,37881,patrick_j_falahee_jr,,2605.614,2606.964,Yes.
1996.95-259,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2606.964,2607.615,"Yeah, okay."
1996.95-259,2,37881,patrick_j_falahee_jr,,2607.615,2607.835,Yes.
1996.95-259,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2607.835,2609.057,But I think Justice Ginsburg was--
1996.95-259,2,37881,patrick_j_falahee_jr,,2629.54,2629.68,I--
1996.95-259,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2629.68,2652.706,"You're telling me that an employer... same number of hours, but somebody who works 4 days a week... is never counted... will never qualify that employer, whereas somebody who worked for that... who... who worked 2 hours a day each day a week, that employer would be under Title VII... if I understand your method correctly... is that right?"
1996.95-259,2,37881,patrick_j_falahee_jr,,2652.706,2657.329,"--The focus is on counting the number of individuals, not the particular individuals."
1996.95-259,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2657.329,2658.36,Right.
1996.95-259,2,37881,patrick_j_falahee_jr,,2663.313,2663.864,Yes.
1996.95-259,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2663.864,2669.107,--because you're missing the worker who was there 10 hours a day for 4 days--
1996.95-259,2,37881,patrick_j_falahee_jr,,2669.107,2669.727,Yes.
1996.95-259,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2669.727,2670.618,--that's one employer.
1996.95-259,2,37881,patrick_j_falahee_jr,,2671.75,2673.45,That would be correct.
1996.95-259,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2673.45,2683.688,"But, then, you have another employer who has the same 14 who show up for 8 hours a day, and then a 15th who comes in every day for 2 hours, that one is covered?"
1996.95-259,2,37881,patrick_j_falahee_jr,,2683.688,2688.81,"That... that... under that scenario, the employer would be subject to Title VII, yes, Your Honor."
1996.95-259,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2707.273,2708.663,"Well, I guess--"
1996.95-259,2,37881,patrick_j_falahee_jr,,2738.723,2739.725,Your--
1996.95-259,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2739.725,2744.226,"I mean, that seems to be the main difference, is what counts as an employment relationship."
1996.95-259,2,37881,patrick_j_falahee_jr,,2744.226,2750.711,"--Your Honor, our test does not focus upon the existence of an employment relationship whatsoever."
1996.95-259,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2752.571,2755.663,"Well, you agree that's the main point of difference between you?"
1996.95-259,2,37881,patrick_j_falahee_jr,,2755.663,2758.367,"--As... as to the focus, yes, Your Honor."
1996.95-259,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2759.058,2761.241,"Well, except you don't really say ""presence""."
1996.95-259,2,37881,patrick_j_falahee_jr,,2770.097,2771.215,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1996.95-259,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2771.215,2777.75,And you also... you also count workers who are on paid vacation.
1996.95-259,2,37881,patrick_j_falahee_jr,,2777.75,2779.151,"Yes, we do."
1996.95-259,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2779.151,2785.475,So it's really... the... the employer relationship you focus on is compensation for that day.
1996.95-259,2,37881,patrick_j_falahee_jr,,2785.475,2786.496,That's correct.
1996.95-259,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2786.496,2787.977,I... I wonder if you... if you--
1996.95-259,2,37881,patrick_j_falahee_jr,,2799.766,2801.637,"I'm not sure I understand the question, Your Honor."
1996.95-259,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2801.637,2811.454,"Well, if it's compensation... he doesn't show up at work on any Fridays, but in calculating eligibility for the Christmas bonus at the end of the year, they count all the days he was on the payroll."
1996.95-259,2,37881,patrick_j_falahee_jr,,2811.454,2820.728,"Well, if the... if the Christmas bonus test used the same language as Title VII, I believe we would have to apply the same test."
1996.95-259,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2825.903,2832.766,"Well, the bonus was you... you get a dollar a day for every day you're on the payroll, even though you didn't work certain days."
1996.95-259,2,37881,patrick_j_falahee_jr,,2856.401,2859.404,"No, Your Honor."
1996.95-259,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2880.899,2881.79,No; the only you have to do to earn it is be on the payroll.
1996.95-259,2,37881,patrick_j_falahee_jr,,2891.708,2892.727,"Yes, Your Honor."
1996.95-259,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2892.727,2900.874,"And I don't know why, then days on which you accrue additional vacation pay, only because you're on the payroll, wouldn't also count."
1996.95-259,2,37881,patrick_j_falahee_jr,,2900.874,2901.753,Because--
1996.95-259,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2901.753,2903.175,"Maybe there's a good reason, but I don't see it."
1996.95-259,2,37881,patrick_j_falahee_jr,,2903.175,2913.11,"--Because compensation, I believe, is a... is a better measure of the employer's work force for each working day."
1996.95-259,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2913.11,2914.322,But that is... but that is compensation.
1996.95-259,2,37881,patrick_j_falahee_jr,,2927.741,2928.843,"That would be correct, Your Honor."
1996.95-259,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2928.843,2930.376,"And you would count... you would count that, then?"

1996.95-259,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2934.199,2941.355,"If it were done that way, and you were getting compensation for that Friday, even though you didn't come to work, you would have to count it under your system, as I understand it?"
1996.95-259,2,37881,patrick_j_falahee_jr,,2941.355,2944.227,"Under... under our method, such an individual would be counted for that--"
1996.95-259,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2944.227,2946.898,"I mean, if there is such a crazy Christmas bonus system, then you count it."
1996.95-259,2,37881,patrick_j_falahee_jr,,2946.898,2948.33,"--Yes, Your Honor."

1996.95-259,2,37881,patrick_j_falahee_jr,,2990.776,2994.989,"There... there are several answers to that question, Your Honor."
1996.95-259,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3052.499,3052.819,"No, that's not right."
1996.95-259,2,37881,patrick_j_falahee_jr,,3062.746,3066.721,"--As... as to that purpose, that would be a permissible purpose, Your Honor."
1996.95-259,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3072.424,3072.924,"Well, it would."
1996.95-259,2,37881,patrick_j_falahee_jr,,3094.507,3103.493,I believe that the distinction really comes down to how we... in... in Your Honor's hypothetical... comes down to how we define part-time.
1996.95-259,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3120.024,3122.957,"But you include part-time people, too."
1996.95-259,2,37881,patrick_j_falahee_jr,,3128.74,3132.053,"And that individual, Your Honor, would be counted for each of those 5 days."
1996.95-259,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3136.775,3137.486,"Yeah, I understand that."

1996.95-259,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3167.386,3168.588,"Well, wholly apart from deference."
1996.95-259,2,37881,patrick_j_falahee_jr,,3181.246,3184.747,--I--
1996.95-259,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3184.747,3186.36,And I think there's no contest on that.
1996.95-259,2,37881,patrick_j_falahee_jr,,3190.621,3191.853,--Well--
1996.95-259,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3191.853,3198.258,"--I think you're... you're... you're in trouble once you assume that ""for each working day"" has a substantial meaning apart from the one that you want to give it."
1996.95-259,2,37881,patrick_j_falahee_jr,,3235.74,3240.305,"--Under... well, possibly, Your Honor."

1996.95-259,2,37881,patrick_j_falahee_jr,,3273.888,3276.589,"--Under a weekly payroll system, yes, Your Honor."
