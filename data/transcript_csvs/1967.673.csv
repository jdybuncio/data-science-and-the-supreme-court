1967.673,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,7.861,"Number 673, Albert A. Blinder -- no."
1967.673,0,15602,albert_a_blinder,,27.767,35.72,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1967.673,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,521.794,524.277,Who is the order here against?
1967.673,0,15602,albert_a_blinder,,524.277,528.883,The order of disqualification is against the appellant corporation.
1967.673,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,528.883,531.018,Anybody else?
1967.673,0,15602,albert_a_blinder,,531.018,543.381,"There's an automatic disqualification of the individual, pursuant to the statute and he also was disqualified but this proceeding was commenced only by the corporation."
1967.673,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,543.381,545.19,"Well, don't you have -- I beg your pardon."
1967.673,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,545.19,553.39,"And the order against them is on the account of the fact that that president, who has now resigned, has he?"
1967.673,0,15602,albert_a_blinder,,553.39,555.139,"Yes, he resigned before he was subpoenaed."
1967.673,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,555.139,560.244,But that president had refused to sign the waiver of immunity.
1967.673,0,15602,albert_a_blinder,,560.244,570.63,"That's precisely what the letter said that because of his refusal -- because of the former president's refusal to sign the waiver of immunity, the corporation was disqualified."
1967.673,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,582.196,585.806,There's no doubt on what the state law authorizes that --
1967.673,0,15602,albert_a_blinder,,585.806,586.991,I think that's considerable.
1967.673,1,37987,paul_w_hessel,,2147.471,2154.287,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1967.673,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2436.678,2438.309,It must do what now?
1967.673,1,37987,paul_w_hessel,,2438.309,2439.03,I beg your pardon?
1967.673,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2439.03,2440.725,It must do what?
1967.673,1,37987,paul_w_hessel,,2440.725,2445.535,The corporation or its officers by the contract as Your Honor has brought up.
1967.673,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2456.32,2458.727,Under the Fifth Amendment?
1967.673,1,37987,paul_w_hessel,,2458.727,2463.452,Only with respect to contracts or transactions had with the states or any of its subdivisions.
1967.673,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2463.452,2468.426,That is with the contracts in which their guilt of a crime is affected.
1967.673,1,37987,paul_w_hessel,,2468.426,2469.102,I beg your pardon.
1967.673,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2469.102,2475.42,That is in effect with whether their guilt of the crime is to be confessed.
1967.673,1,37987,paul_w_hessel,,2475.42,2475.917,Well --
1967.673,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2475.917,2478.79,Is that right?
1967.673,1,37987,paul_w_hessel,,2478.79,2481.057,-- the statute doesn't talk about it.
1967.673,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2482.471,2483.497,But that's what it does.
1967.673,1,37987,paul_w_hessel,,2483.497,2484.112,It may be.
1967.673,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2493.258,2501.963,"In other words, to straight out waiver of the Fifth Amendment immunity against self incrimination."
1967.673,1,37987,paul_w_hessel,,2501.963,2506.199,"That's right, by contract."
1967.673,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2506.199,2512.496,"You mean by contract, you can't add the contract unless you agree to it without provision and can't --"
1967.673,1,37987,paul_w_hessel,,2512.496,2513.354,That's right.
1967.673,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2515.951,2522.318,Voluntarily subscribed which don't get a contract unless you agree to this contract containing that provision.
1967.673,1,37987,paul_w_hessel,,2522.318,2523.575,That's right.
1967.673,2,41446,samuel_a_hirshowitz,,4126.578,4133.585,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1967.673,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4439.041,4439.931,May I ask you.
1967.673,2,41446,samuel_a_hirshowitz,,4439.931,4440.37,Yes sir.
1967.673,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4440.37,4461.502,"If this young man had signed the waiver and had testified and had revealed the evidence upon which some criminal violation might be charged as against him personally, do you think he would have had the benefit of Garrity?"
1967.673,2,41446,samuel_a_hirshowitz,,4462.423,4462.807,Yes.
1967.673,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4462.807,4464.089,-- as I understood Mr. (Inaudible).
1967.673,2,41446,samuel_a_hirshowitz,,4472.813,4474.055,Nothing he said could have been --
1967.673,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4474.055,4475.867,And he is -- would that be so here too?
1967.673,2,41446,samuel_a_hirshowitz,,4475.867,4476.785,"Yes sir, Your Honor."
1967.673,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4476.785,4480.645,"Now, is this because you think Garrity requires that answer?"
1967.673,2,41446,samuel_a_hirshowitz,,4480.645,4482.14,No.
1967.673,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4489.868,4490.948,Yes.
1967.673,2,41446,samuel_a_hirshowitz,,4490.948,4492.725,But of course --
1967.673,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4492.725,4495.073,Because there was some compulsion only to talk.
1967.673,2,41446,samuel_a_hirshowitz,,4495.073,4497.702,Yes.
1967.673,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4513.806,4519.958,"And you say even though this young man is not a public employee, the same application in Garrity you think would be required."
1967.673,2,41446,samuel_a_hirshowitz,,4519.958,4521.238,"Yes, Mr. Justice Brennan."
1967.673,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4521.238,4522.146,Yes.
1967.673,2,41446,samuel_a_hirshowitz,,4522.146,4537.594,"Of course, if he were in view on some of the questions of the Court that he were asked to sign a waiver and refuse and then what was brought and requested to answer questions and was directed to answer the questions."
1967.673,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4621.31,4622.934,Wait a minute.
1967.673,2,41446,samuel_a_hirshowitz,,4626.736,4627.557,No.
1967.673,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4637.536,4638.423,Testify.
1967.673,2,41446,samuel_a_hirshowitz,,4638.423,4639.241,Did testify.
1967.673,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4639.241,4641.572,"They waive, the sign the waiver and they testified."
1967.673,2,41446,samuel_a_hirshowitz,,4641.572,4641.961,Yes.
1967.673,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4641.961,4642.98,"Now, were they prosecuted?"
1967.673,2,41446,samuel_a_hirshowitz,,4642.98,4645.985,They were not prosecuted but that testimony was used --
1967.673,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4645.985,4647.109,Used against Campbell --
1967.673,2,41446,samuel_a_hirshowitz,,4647.109,4648.816,Right.
1967.673,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5203.564,5211.405,"Well, I think we will have to take the rest of your argument from your brief, Mr. Hirshowitz."
1967.673,3,15602,albert_a_blinder,,5216.939,5218.948,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1967.673,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5543.435,5546.887,We'll recess now.
