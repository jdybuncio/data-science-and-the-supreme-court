2018.18-266,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.4,"We'll hear argument next in Case 18-266, the Dutra Group versus Batterton. Mr. Waxman."
2018.18-266,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,7.4,21.08,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In Miles, this Court emphasized that when Congress enacted the Jones Act, it took principal responsibility for fashioning remedies for injured seamen."
2018.18-266,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,26.52,30.36,"I'm sorry, that -- that's a little bit backwards."
2018.18-266,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,44.24,48.64,So the Jones Act doesn't say anything about remedies --
2018.18-266,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,48.64,51.04,But our case law has said it repeatedly.
2018.18-266,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,51.04,68.0,"You -- what this Court said just a few years after the Jones Act was enacted was that the Jones Act provides, vis-a-vis unseaworthiness, alternative grounds for recovery of a single cause of action."
2018.18-266,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,84.96,91.4,But that doesn't tell me that their intent was to take away common law remedies.
2018.18-266,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,109.64,110.12,"Well, I --"
2018.18-266,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,110.12,112.92,That it's the exclusive remedy.
2018.18-266,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,112.92,116.36,"No, I think my -- I'm not sure that it is a different statement."
2018.18-266,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,207.4,208.6,Not a complete substitute.
2018.18-266,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,220.8,223.04,But I -- our -- our --
2018.18-266,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,223.04,224.88,It's a different cause of action.
2018.18-266,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,228.52,237.96,"The cause -- at the time that the Jones Act was enacted, the contours of the particular cause of action differed significantly."
2018.18-266,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,264.68,267.48,"But I thought -- Mr. Waxman, if I can interrupt you there."
2018.18-266,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,291.44,300.76,I -- I agree with that articulation that this Court rendered in the Osceola in 1905 and as to which the Jones Act was addressed.
2018.18-266,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,336.88,342.48,"It's even a little bit better sometimes, right, given it's a strict liability offense, isn't it?"
2018.18-266,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,342.48,353.72,"So it's -- it's not -- it is frequently said that it is a strict liability defense, whereas the Jones Act is a negligence standard."
2018.18-266,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,388.08,418.28,"I mean, maybe -- I guess one of the points in your brief that confused me, and maybe you're kind of providing an answer to it, but I'll just -- you say several times in your brief that the unseaworthiness action really has evolved, changed, quite a bit since the Jones Act. And I would think that if you're right as to your basic theory, which is that the Jones Act is a signal to courts to stop doing stuff --"
2018.18-266,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,418.28,418.64,Uh-huh.
2018.18-266,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,418.64,432.92,"-- because the Jones Act is now taking over the field, essentially, if you're right as to your basic theory, how is it possible that this action of unseaworthiness could have changed as much as you admit that it did?"
2018.18-266,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,432.92,459.88,"Well, the -- there are some differences, as Justice Sotomayor -- there were reasons why the court, when it enacted the Jones Act, didn't preempt other federal -- existing federal common law remedies. And the situation of preemption and the effect of a statutory scheme of remedies vis-a-vis preexisting common law is markedly different when the common law is federal rather than state."
2018.18-266,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,487.72,488.4,So I guess my -- if I --
2018.18-266,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,488.4,489.04,But if I -- if I can just --
2018.18-266,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,489.04,490.96,-- I guess my question is --
2018.18-266,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,490.96,492.04,I realize I'm talking --
2018.18-266,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,492.04,511.0,"-- Mister -- Mr. Waxman, is when does the Jones Act say stop, don't do stuff to -- to courts, and when does it allow courts to keep thinking about revising, developing these common law actions?"
2018.18-266,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,511.0,530.84,"Well, I think this Court came pretty close to attempting to articulate that line in Miles itself where it says, and I'm quoting from page 27, ""In this era, an admiralty court should look primarily to these legislative enactments for policy guidance."
2018.18-266,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,545.08,560.64,"And I guess what I'm asking is, how is that kind of flashing yellow light, which I agree with you, that sounds like a flashing yellow light to me, how is it consistent with all the changes that have occurred in the unseaworthiness action?"
2018.18-266,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,560.64,665.0,"And what you see is that the effectuation of those sentences I just read in Miles itself, in light of the scope of the Jones Act, Congress not only eliminated in Mahnich the -- for -- for unseaworthiness the defense of fellow servant, and then eliminated in light of the Jones Act the defense of contributory negligence under unseaworthiness, but, in Miles, following Moragne, the Court said, well, the Jones Act recognizes a wrongful death remedy for claims under the Jones Act. And because the Jones Act and unseaworthiness are just twin causes of action for the same injury, we will recognize the -- a -- we will recognize recoveries in wrongful death, in cases brought of an unseaworthiness. Now, importantly, what happened was, after this Court decided Moragne and said, well, the Jones Act allows a recovery for wrongful death and unseaworthiness, so we're going to, too, the question then came before the Court in Sea-Land Services versus Gaudet, well, what does that involve? Like, what are the remedies that you get for wrongful death? And what this Court held was that the remedies you get for wrongful death include the loss of society. The next case that comes along is Mobil Oil versus Higginbotham, raises wrongful death for unseaworthiness but for a wrongful death that occurred on the high seas. And this time what this Court says is, well, the Death on the High Seas Act doesn't -- only allows for recovery of pecuniary damages. Loss of society is not pecuniary damages."
2018.18-266,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,717.2,730.36,"I thought all those cases in the Miles line had to do with wrongful death actions and the whole history that there was no -- before Death on the High Seas Act, there was no such remedy?"
2018.18-266,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,730.36,772.6,"Well, the three cases that I identified just now, Justice Ginsburg, were wrongful death cases, although Miles itself also included a claim for a right of survivorship, which is a form of injury. And, once again, the Court said the Jones Act sets the limits for common law recoveries for injury or death to Jones Act seamen and held on the injury side of it that the representative of the deceased, pursuing a personal injury action on behalf of the deceased, could not recover future lost wages because the Jones Act doesn't allow it. Now, in Mahnich, it was not a wrongful death case."
2018.18-266,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,839.36,840.04,Is it --
2018.18-266,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,840.04,847.52,"And -- and this Court said, at common law, in particularly egregious cases, punitive damages were available."
2018.18-266,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,900.44,901.24,Any -- any counterevidence?
2018.18-266,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,901.24,901.88,Excuse me?
2018.18-266,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,901.88,903.12,Any counterevidence?
2018.18-266,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,903.12,908.12,"Well, here's -- here's the counterevidence, and it's -- it's -- it's revealing."
2018.18-266,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,976.32,976.6,I'd like --
2018.18-266,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,976.6,1068.04,"I can't find a case in which punitive damages were even requested. And if you look at -- and this -- this Court certainly has a rich body of unseaworthiness decisions between the 1880s and the -- and the present time, there are -- there is case after case of what is reported as shocking, egregious conduct in which there is no reflection in the briefs or in any of the opinions that punitive damages was even sought. And a reason may be -- and this is the other Townsend-related reason I want to address -- prior to -- we have a -- somewhat of a disagreement between us as to the exact date at the very end of the 19th Century in which any court first recognized that compensatory damages could be paid to an injured seaman for failure of seaworthiness, but at least until the middle 1880s, at a time when the treatises and the cases were saying you can get punitive damages for a willful refusal to provide medical care to an ill seaman, you couldn't even get under -- unseaworthiness compensatory damages. The remedy for unseaworthiness to a seaman was the privilege to refuse to embark on a vessel that was unseaworthy and yet to claim your wages. And that's the reason."
2018.18-266,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1109.76,1141.44,"And were there cases where it was quite egregious? Because I was thinking about this and thinking maybe it just wouldn't come up because an unseaworthiness action is basically you've taken deliberate action to ensure that your own ship sinks. So most people don't want the ship that they own to sink, right? So, you know, it might just be that when people bring this kind of action, they're not bringing it on the basis of the kind of behavior that would justify a punitive damages award."
2018.18-266,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1141.44,1151.8,"Justice Kagan, I have read you the Court's opinion in the Noddleburn, which finds that the shipowners not only knew of the unseaworthy condition, but they were --"
2018.18-266,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1151.8,1153.36,"Well, I do think that my --"
2018.18-266,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1153.36,1153.52,And --
2018.18-266,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1153.52,1156.64,-- my question is not answerable by pointing to a single case.
2018.18-266,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1156.64,1156.96,Okay.
2018.18-266,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1213.72,1218.56,But the owner -- the owner of the ship is not mostly -- generally isn't going to be on the ship.
2018.18-266,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1218.56,1218.92,Right.
2018.18-266,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1218.92,1247.84,"So, if it sinks, the owner is probably not going to be one of the ones that drowns. So, if the owner does a cost/benefit analysis of the -- the cost of getting a better ship or repairing the ship versus the amount of money that could be obtained from -- from going ahead with a voyage using that ship, is that always going to come out in favor of safety? Is it generally going to -- did it -- did it always -- did it generally come out in favor of safety in the -- in the 19th Century?"
2018.18-266,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1247.84,1332.24,"So I would suggest -- I mean, I didn't live in the 19th Century and although I feel like at this point I've read most of the cases decided in the 19th Century, I haven't seen policy discussions on this point. But I will say that when Congress enacted the Jones Act, and for that matter, when Congress enacted FELA -- I mean, the owners, the corporations that own railroads weren't riding on the railroads themselves -- Congress made a -- an obvious policy judgment to create -- to not go all the way to a workmen's compensation statute where, if you're injured, you just file a claim in front of a state administrative agency and you get the following kinds of recovery but not many others, but that is the spirit of what FELA and the Jones Act did, which is to provide a much broader, much more certain remedy, sweeping away the defenses of assumption of risk and contributory negligence and the fellow servant rule, in exchange for a -- a judgment that, in dealing with the policies and the thinking of what went on in people who ran railroads and ran steamship companies and people who worked there, Congress's choice was to say very easy streamlined recovery for compensatory damages, no recovery for punitive damages."
2018.18-266,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1332.56,1334.88,Is pain and suffering compensatory damages?
2018.18-266,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1334.88,1338.48,"Yes, pain and suffering is compensatory."
2018.18-266,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1339.36,1339.8,It's not pecuniary?
2018.18-266,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1339.8,1340.68,Excuse me?
2018.18-266,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1340.68,1343.04,It's not -- then it's not pecuniary?
2018.18-266,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1343.04,1344.24,It's not pecuniary.
2018.18-266,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1383.56,1385.08,But may I just stop you there.
2018.18-266,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1387.04,1387.76,That's right.
2018.18-266,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1398.48,1399.64,We've reserved that question.
2018.18-266,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1399.64,1400.32,Excuse me?
2018.18-266,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1400.32,1401.72,We reserved that question.
2018.18-266,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1401.72,1403.64,You did reserve that question.
2018.18-266,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1403.64,1405.8,So that's still an open question.
2018.18-266,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1405.8,1411.68,"Well, I mean, it is an open question in this Court."
2018.18-266,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1451.76,1452.56,So why did you in your --
2018.18-266,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1452.56,1454.04,I agree that this Court has not so cited.
2018.18-266,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1454.04,1462.48,-- brief say that FELA and the Jones Act bar on compensatory damages could include non-pecuniary losses?
2018.18-266,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1462.48,1463.96,"Well, there's a dis -- so --"
2018.18-266,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1463.96,1467.28,And that --
2018.18-266,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1467.28,1491.8,-- the non-pecuniary recovery for -- I don't have -- we don't have a position on whether pecuniary damages are non -- whether pecuniary damages are available under the Jones Act or not. What the -- the way that came about is pecuniary damages are not available under the Death on the High Seas Act.
2018.18-266,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1503.36,1504.52,But that may not --
2018.18-266,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1504.52,1506.2,-- in unseaworthiness cases.
2018.18-266,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1547.92,1548.88,There -- there seem to be --
2018.18-266,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1548.88,1551.36,-- imperative to -- to create that anomaly.
2018.18-266,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1551.36,1552.56,-- two ways we can look at this.
2018.18-266,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1575.84,1588.36,"I think it -- I think it factors in exactly -- I mean, this Court has said over and over again that the special solicitude to the wards of the admiralty does not dictate a result that the -- the seaman always wins."
2018.18-266,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1631.36,1636.92,"Certainly, counsel. Mr. Frederick."
2018.18-266,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1636.92,1654.32,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Our position is that punitive damages are available under the general maritime law for claims that a vessel is unseaworthy."
2018.18-266,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1671.44,1673.2,Except --
2018.18-266,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1673.2,1674.8,-- of the Jones Act.
2018.18-266,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1674.8,1682.64,"-- except that it's not like Townsend, where there were at least two cases where punitive damages were awarded."
2018.18-266,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1708.28,1741.92,"It's slightly different, Justice Sotomayor, but I would say that what the Court decided in Townsend, which controls here, is does the general rule of allowing punitive damages apply, unless there's some express case holding that says otherwise or Congress expressly said otherwise. And, certainly, the discussion that my friend offers of the Noddleburn indicates that the Court was considering whether to give exemplary or punitive damages in that case."
2018.18-266,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1834.12,1837.2,Is your adversary right -- adversary -- I mean --
2018.18-266,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1837.2,1838.4,He's my friend.
2018.18-266,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1838.4,1840.4,I know. (Laughter.)
2018.18-266,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1840.4,1852.52,Mr. Waxman right that the remedy for unseaworthiness was for a period of time only the ability to collect wages?
2018.18-266,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1852.52,1853.28,The -- yes.
2018.18-266,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1853.28,1854.44,And when did that change?
2018.18-266,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1854.44,1857.64,It started to change in the 1800s.
2018.18-266,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2031.16,2037.0,You're not disputing -- you're not disputing that they're often referred to as twin causes of action?
2018.18-266,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2037.0,2037.8,"No, they're not."
2018.18-266,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2064.6,2093.36,"But you're -- you're basically asking us to put on our common law hat and decide that punitive damages are a good thing because there -- there isn't any case pre-Jones Act saying that you could get -- that you could get punitive damages for unseaworthiness, and no court of appeals that I'm aware of has ever held that you can get it -- get them under either FELA or the Jones Act?"
2018.18-266,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2093.36,2093.88,Your Honor --
2018.18-266,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2093.88,2095.56,Is all that right?
2018.18-266,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2095.56,2119.48,"-- let me step back and say first that what this Court decided in Townsend, we think, controls and that if you were to substitute ""maintenance and cure"" for the words ""unseaworthiness"" in almost every paragraph of the first three parts of the Court's decision in Townsend, you would come to exactly the same result, the exceptions being a couple of the cases where we would offer to substitute in a few unseaworthiness cases --"
2018.18-266,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2119.48,2120.24,But if there were just --
2018.18-266,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2120.24,2121.64,-- versus a couple of cases that were cited.
2018.18-266,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2121.64,2133.56,"Sorry to interrupt, but if there were an established general rule in maritime cases that you get punitive damages, how do you account for the fact that there weren't cases awarding punitive damages for unseaworthiness?"
2018.18-266,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2133.56,2134.12,The -- I think --
2018.18-266,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2134.12,2136.56,How did this general rule escape everybody's attention?
2018.18-266,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2136.56,2138.84,It didn't escape everybody's attention.
2018.18-266,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2158.28,2169.76,"But, I mean, I think -- I wasn't around in the 19th Century either, but I think then and earlier, there were an awful lot of very unseaworthy vessels that were sent out to sea by owners."
2018.18-266,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2183.24,2185.56,"Well, I -- I -- there were claims, certainly."
2018.18-266,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2191.8,2192.8,"Well, there weren't holdings."
2018.18-266,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2194.92,2195.8,That is true.
2018.18-266,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2247.88,2253.44,"But there -- there -- but there's -- I mean, you're talking about, you know, sending rust buckets out to sea and all these things."
2018.18-266,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2275.96,2314.44,"Well, Your Honor, I think that they're both egregious situations. And I would not want to fight the premise of your question that the willful withholding of maintenance and cure is -- is egregious, because it certainly is. But, in Townsend, what the Court held was that just because there's overlap between the willful withholding of maintenance and cure does not mean that -- with the Jones Act remedy, does not mean that the Jones Act remedy forecloses the ability of obtaining punitive damages for that. Certainly, in situations where a -- a vessel is not reasonably fit for its intended purpose because of its --"
2018.18-266,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2314.44,2326.68,"Well, but that -- that includes a situation I discussed, right? If you had a hatch that didn't fully close, and, as a result, there was an injury, I mean, that's, you say, not fully fit for its purposes."
2018.18-266,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2335.76,2379.76,"Your Honor, I think that the key question, if I could take you to this place in the colloquy, is whether or not the owner acted in a wanton or willful way with conscious disregard of the safety. So really what we're talking about are those situations in maintenance and cure where the captain or the master of the vessel is acting in a wanton way that causes the danger to the crew member to exacerbate. The same kind of wantonness is what we're talking about in the unseaworthiness situation where, as in this case, air pressure was not vented and instructions for the safe use of this vessel were not even given to the master of the vessel, and --"
2018.18-266,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2379.76,2380.12,Can I --
2018.18-266,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2380.12,2385.76,-- and that's the kind of wantonness that we're talking about here that should be deterred and prevented.
2018.18-266,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2385.76,2402.4,"Mr. Frederick, one thing that I think is undisputable is the evidence is very slim that there were punitive damages, in fact, awarded for unseaworthiness claims."
2018.18-266,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2405.24,2407.32,"I -- I would agree with that, Justice Ginsburg."
2018.18-266,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2407.32,2417.0,And you would also agree on the Jones and FELA that the courts of appeals have been uniform in saying no?
2018.18-266,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2417.0,2418.72,That I don't agree with.
2018.18-266,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2456.4,2461.68,You also have four court of appeals who have given punitive damages for unseaworthiness.
2018.18-266,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2461.68,2462.28,You -- you --
2018.18-266,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2462.28,2464.24,They're listed in Petitioner's brief.
2018.18-266,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2464.24,2464.96,That's correct.
2018.18-266,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2515.84,2518.2,Can I -- I just want to make my list.
2018.18-266,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2524.8,2525.52,Yes.
2018.18-266,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2525.52,2531.04,And -- and it seems to me everybody's agreed that the standard of liability doesn't really make much difference.
2018.18-266,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2531.04,2531.68,That's not correct.
2018.18-266,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2531.68,2532.08,All right.
2018.18-266,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2533.8,2534.2,Okay.
2018.18-266,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2534.2,2535.64,-- and then go back and tell me what I'm missing.
2018.18-266,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2535.64,2536.0,Sure.
2018.18-266,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2536.0,2536.76,All right.
2018.18-266,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2538.56,2539.28,Yes.
2018.18-266,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2539.28,2542.52,"Number two, the ship owner versus the employer."
2018.18-266,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2542.52,2543.08,Yes.
2018.18-266,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2543.08,2545.84,And number three is you say passengers can sue.
2018.18-266,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2550.68,2552.44,The liability standard is different.
2018.18-266,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2554.96,2555.44,Yeah --
2018.18-266,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2555.44,2568.88,"-- whether the vessel equipment is staffing for an unfit purpose. The causation standard is different. For an unseaworthiness claim, the unseaworthiness has to be a substantial or proximate cause of the injury."
2018.18-266,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2689.48,2693.08,"But can we go back? Passengers, are there a lot of passenger suits?"
2018.18-266,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2693.08,2694.96,"I -- I -- I don't know that, Your Honor."
2018.18-266,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2696.8,2699.16,Which I assume there are not because you would -- you would probably know.
2018.18-266,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2699.16,2700.76,"No, that is -- that's correct."
2018.18-266,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2700.76,2700.84,The --
2018.18-266,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2700.84,2720.72,"But -- but also there are situations where other employees of other entities would have an unseaworthiness claim, and let me give a prosaic example if I might indulge the Court. Say you've got a cruise ship that's owned by a particular cruise line, but they subcontract out to a Broadway company to have a traveling music show on the cruise ship."
2018.18-266,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2748.04,2777.0,"So how do you think, Mr. Frederick, we should think about the question of the relationship between the Jones Act, on the one hand, and the common law maritime function, on the other? Because there is this language in Miles which seems to say broadly that, given the Jones Act, given that the Jones Act exists, courts should be wary of -- of doing things with their common law hat on. So how should we think about that?"
2018.18-266,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2777.0,2777.48,Let me offer --
2018.18-266,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2777.48,2778.04,What's the line?
2018.18-266,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2778.04,2780.32,"Here's the line. First, start with the statute."
2018.18-266,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2846.8,2847.52,So that makes Miles --
2018.18-266,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2847.52,2847.92,-- was legislating --
2018.18-266,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2847.92,2849.84,-- sound like a one-off.
2018.18-266,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2862.84,2898.2,"Well, in Townsend, the Court did explain not that Miles is a one-off but that it is proper and should be viewed within the context in which it arises. And it was that special context that Townsend was able to rule that because of the special progeny of the way wrongful death occurred -- because, remember, wrongful death claims were not cognizable at the common law. Personal injury claims were. And so, if you want to draw a line right there, you have a very distinctive history between wrongful death and survivorship."
2018.18-266,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2915.88,2922.36,"Isn't -- isn't that an anomaly, as Mr. Waxman says, though, if we were to agree with your position here?"
2018.18-266,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2922.36,2985.4,"No, I think that the anomaly actually works in the other direction, because the fact that many state courts, and there are footnotes in our amicus briefs that point out there were, you know, dozens of state courts that recognized punitive damages for wrongful death claims, even where they had allowed for only a more circumscribed compensatory damages in the wrongful death space, suggests that state legislators did not view an inconsistency between punitive damages, which were done to deter, and compensatory damages, which needed to look at the economic realities of what the deceased worker was providing as livelihood to his or her family. And so, for that reason, the wrongful death area has a very long and different lineage and, therefore, also gives rise to different views about how the interplay between this Court acting under its powers of the general maritime law should interface, where Congress has spoken in the area of wrongful death --"
2018.18-266,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2985.4,2985.76,I have --
2018.18-266,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2985.76,2986.16,-- and so --
2018.18-266,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2986.16,2991.04,"-- one other question, which was you've talked about the deterrent value of the punitive damages."
2018.18-266,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,3004.44,3005.52,"Thank you, Justice Kavanaugh."
2018.18-266,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3132.88,3133.92,I'm sorry.
2018.18-266,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,3149.32,3188.8,"Your Honor, the answer to your question depends on what kind of charter is arranged between the owner of the vessel and the operator of the vessel. For a bare boat charter, which was an operation in our case, the operator stands in the shoes by virtue of some very late 19th Century law about the effect of bare boat charters in creating a -- an owner pro hac vice for this purpose. In many other instances, the employer is not acting as the owner pro hac vice and it depends on the particular chartering arrangement that is established between the owner and the employer."
2018.18-266,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3188.8,3201.36,Can I ask a trivial question?
2018.18-266,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,3201.36,3202.12,"Yes, Your Honor."
2018.18-266,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3202.12,3202.68,All right.
2018.18-266,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,3227.0,3230.6,"With that, Your Honor, we'll rest."
2018.18-266,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3233.12,3236.56,"Thank you, counsel. Three minutes, Mr. Waxman."
2018.18-266,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3236.56,3237.24,Thank you.
2018.18-266,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3422.36,3422.92,"Thank you, counsel."
