1984.83-1065,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,12.991,We will hear arguments next in County of Oneida v. Oneida Indian Nation and New York State in the related case.
1984.83-1065,0,16067,allan_van_gestel,,17.878,22.346,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1984.83-1065,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,174.164,175.18,Mr. van Gestel.
1984.83-1065,0,16067,allan_van_gestel,,175.18,175.88,"Yesa, sir."
1984.83-1065,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,175.88,185.302,"To get back for a moment to the point you adverted to earlier, this is a case about ownership and not about sovereignty as such, I take it here."
1984.83-1065,0,16067,allan_van_gestel,,185.302,186.137,"No, Your Honor."
1984.83-1065,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,212.539,215.491,Wouldn't there have to be a reservation embracing the land?
1984.83-1065,0,16067,allan_van_gestel,,215.491,217.957,"No, there would not have to be a reservation."
1984.83-1065,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,416.805,428.295,"Mr. van Gestel, this is not an argument on the merits, I take it as to whether if they could get into... if the tribe could get into court they could properly assert this as an affirmative claim or as a defense."
1984.83-1065,0,16067,allan_van_gestel,,428.295,446.157,"This is an argument, Justice Rehnquist, on the issue of the intent of the Congress in 1793, and it seems to me the intent of the Congress, among other things, in addition to what its plain language said, has to be drawn from Congress' understanding of what was happening at the time."
1984.83-1065,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,463.953,478.295,But is it the intent of Congress as to whether the Indians should have a right of action under this particular statute or the intent of Congress as to how the merits of the statute should he interpreted if the tribe were to be able to get into court in some way?
1984.83-1065,0,16067,allan_van_gestel,,478.295,489.584,"In my reading of the cases of this Court since 1975, it is the intent of Congress as to whether the Indians should have a right of action under the particular statute."
1984.83-1065,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,544.405,546.357,"Well, let me ask you this question."
1984.83-1065,0,16067,allan_van_gestel,,566.77,581.011,"If the action were brought in state court and it were, as to use your words in the '74 opinion, a garden variety ejectment action, presumably it would be subject to the state law, including the defenses that would be available in a state court."
1984.83-1065,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,581.011,582.613,Such as the statute of limitations?
1984.83-1065,0,16067,allan_van_gestel,,582.613,595.003,"Such as the statute of limitations, such as adverse possession, the various kinds of things that are said at least by the lower courts not to apply when we are dealing with a Trade and Intercourse Act case in the federal system."
1984.83-1065,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,595.003,605.478,"Well, I think that is an important issue in your case, but why would it be resolved any differently in state court if the state court in deciding the case is subject to the overall limitations of federal law."
1984.83-1065,0,16067,allan_van_gestel,,605.478,607.661,Perhaps I misunderstand your question.
1984.83-1065,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,619.553,645.62,"Well, but supposing there is an appeal then taken, perhaps in the New York Court of Appeals or ultimately to this Court, and the Indian tribe or plaintiff says, look, this nonintercourse act of 1791 and the supplemental... or 1793, the supplemental act... say that this land shouldn't have been taken away from us the way it was, that we shouldn't have been allowed to deed it away without the attendant things specified in the statute, and therefore we are entitled to possession."
1984.83-1065,0,16067,allan_van_gestel,,648.405,656.911,"The federal question, I think what you would come to then, Your Honor, is whether a right of action was intended under that statute."
1984.83-1065,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,656.911,663.498,"Well, can't New York give a right of action under that statute when you are talking about a real property question?"
1984.83-1065,0,16067,allan_van_gestel,,663.498,668.719,I don't think New York could give a right of action under the 1793 Federal Trade and Intercourse Act.
1984.83-1065,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,672.871,683.228,"And doesn't New York give anyone a right to come into court and say we are now dispossessed of Black Acre; we are entitled by law to Black Acre: therefore, give us Black Acre."
1984.83-1065,0,16067,allan_van_gestel,,685.697,688.549,"I don't know whether by federal law, Justice White."
1984.83-1065,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,721.953,722.92,"Well, I won't pursue you further."
1984.83-1065,0,16067,allan_van_gestel,,739.665,747.688,"Well, it seems to me that the private right of action is an important issue, and I really don't mean to back down from it in any sense."
1984.83-1065,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,747.688,750.206,Put you've only got limited time.
1984.83-1065,0,16067,allan_van_gestel,,750.206,753.574,"I appreciate that, too, Mr. Justice White."
1984.83-1065,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,830.572,847.866,"Mr. van Gestel, what bearing, if any, does Section 2415 of Title 28 of the U.S. Code have on this claim asserted by the Indian tribes?"
1984.83-1065,0,16067,allan_van_gestel,,847.866,851.251,"I, Justice O'Connor, I think it has no bearing whatsoever."
1984.83-1065,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,868.195,871.399,"Well, the lawyer for the United States doesn't deal with it."
1984.83-1065,0,16067,allan_van_gestel,,871.399,873.899,"I realize that, Your Honor, and respectfully--"
1984.83-1065,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,873.899,877.116,"So your ""whatsoever"" is a little strong, isn't it?"
1984.83-1065,0,16067,allan_van_gestel,,877.116,886.741,"--Well, my ""whatsoever"" comes from a reading of the statutory history and the discussion by those in Congress at the time of the enactment of that statute."
1984.83-1065,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,916.927,922.514,"Except to conclude that if the United States isn't barred, neither are the Indians."
1984.83-1065,0,16067,allan_van_gestel,,922.514,925.699,"Correct, which is a conclusion that I think is inappropriate."
1984.83-1065,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,952.201,973.597,"Well, under the 1982 amendments, the Secretary of the Interior, under this federal statute of limitations, notifies the Indians of... the Indian tribes of the claims it intends to allow and extends the statute another year, presumably to let Indian tribes file their own claims."
1984.83-1065,0,16067,allan_van_gestel,,977.732,979.834,"I don't think so, respectfully, Your Honor."
1984.83-1065,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1013.222,1021.328,What would happen if the United States were bringing this action and it was an action for quiet title?
1984.83-1065,0,16067,allan_van_gestel,,1023.511,1028.248,I would assume that probably there would not be a statute of limitations against the United States.
1984.83-1065,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1028.248,1029.215,"Well, that would... that's just under the section."
1984.83-1065,0,16067,allan_van_gestel,,1035.735,1038.853,"You are talking now about 2415, Your Honor, or about some other section?"
1984.83-1065,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1038.853,1040.153,2415.
1984.83-1065,0,16067,allan_van_gestel,,1040.153,1047.274,"Under 2415, until the time runs out which is contained therein, the United States could bring an action."
1984.83-1065,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1047.274,1048.393,Yes.
1984.83-1065,0,16067,allan_van_gestel,,1050.828,1055.963,"If my memory serves me, it runs out at the end of this year."
1984.83-1065,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1055.963,1056.998,Uh-huh.
1984.83-1065,0,16067,allan_van_gestel,,1056.998,1061.533,"I think it is December 31, 1984, if I recall correctly."
1984.83-1065,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1061.533,1071.591,Do you think that the case of Ewert v. Bluejacket indicates that state statute of limitations don't apply to Indian claims?
1984.83-1065,0,16067,allan_van_gestel,,1071.591,1076.31,"I think Ewert v. Bluejacket suggests that state statutes do not apply, Justice O'Connor."
1984.83-1065,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1288.932,1295.319,"May I ask, Mr. van Gestel, is... the land here that is in dispute in this case is owned by counties."
1984.83-1065,0,16067,allan_van_gestel,,1301.408,1304.258,"Justice Stevens, I do not believe that they do."
1984.83-1065,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1316.168,1318.218,Did they acquire it directly from the State of New York?
1984.83-1065,0,16067,allan_van_gestel,,1318.218,1321.053,--They acquired it... they were created in part cut of this land.
1984.83-1065,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1331.011,1333.294,But there has been no intervening ownership in private hands.
1984.83-1065,0,16067,allan_van_gestel,,1344.935,1350.739,I cannot as I stand here say that some of the county land didn't come from somewhere else.
1984.83-1065,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1364.665,1370.903,"You think you have the same, just as strong a position as if you were a private, innocent purchaser through good faith, a third party purchaser?"
1984.83-1065,0,16067,allan_van_gestel,,1370.903,1374.271,"Yes, I do, Your Honor, and I would remind the Court--"
1984.83-1065,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1374.271,1377.973,"This case is then, on that basis, the case is quite different from the Ewert case."
1984.83-1065,0,16067,allan_van_gestel,,1377.973,1378.925,--Yes.
1984.83-1065,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1504.471,1517.463,"Mr. van Gestel, on page 4 of the state's brief, they mention two judgments, one against Madison of $9,060, and against Oneida of $7,634."
1984.83-1065,0,16067,allan_van_gestel,,1519.165,1521.533,"--That is the dollar amount, yes, Justice Brennan."
1984.83-1065,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1542.531,1544.298,But there is no issue as to dollar value?
1984.83-1065,0,16067,allan_van_gestel,,1544.298,1546.032,"No, there is no issue as to dollar value."
1984.83-1065,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1546.032,1550.036,"Well, what is the impact to which you refer, the broader scope?"
1984.83-1065,0,16067,allan_van_gestel,,1550.036,1574.585,"The broader scope, Your Honor, is that if it is determined that there is a right of action under the Trade and Intercourse Act, or if it is determined that there is no statute of limitations bar or there cannot be retroactive ratification or this is not a political question, then in this particular area you have the next shoe dropping, the next suit for the balance of the 100,000 acres against the private landowners."
1984.83-1065,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1574.585,1576.77,Most of which is in private ownership.
1984.83-1065,0,16067,allan_van_gestel,,1576.77,1578.487,Essentially all of which is in private ownership.
1984.83-1065,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1578.487,1581.489,So it would be valued like if you were condemning the land or something.
1984.83-1065,0,16067,allan_van_gestel,,1581.489,1592.713,"Well, that is an issue that we debated in the lower court, Your Honor, but nevertheless, when you take the value back 175 years and apply interest, you have a situation that is wholly unmanageable."
1984.83-1065,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1606.706,1609.158,But all of this could be cured by Congress.
1984.83-1065,0,16067,allan_van_gestel,,1609.158,1613.027,"All of this could be cured by Congress, yes, Justice Blackmun."
1984.83-1065,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1617.245,1623.399,How do you think it could be cured by Congress without paying out a lot of money?
1984.83-1065,0,16067,allan_van_gestel,,1623.399,1625.751,"The Congress may well have to pay out some money, Your Honor."
1984.83-1065,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1625.751,1629.052,"Well, some money, or at least as much as what is involved in these suits."
1984.83-1065,0,16067,allan_van_gestel,,1629.052,1630.238,I'm not so sure of that.
1984.83-1065,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1635.456,1637.008,Do you think it would?
1984.83-1065,0,16067,allan_van_gestel,,1637.008,1638.927,"--I, regrettably, it hasn't--"
1984.83-1065,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1638.927,1639.927,Without paying money?
1984.83-1065,0,16067,allan_van_gestel,,1639.927,1642.379,"--It hasn't done so thus far, but--"
1984.83-1065,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1642.379,1651.168,"The judgment of the Court says the Indians own the land and the Congress says, sorry, but we don't care what a court says, you don't own it."
1984.83-1065,0,16067,allan_van_gestel,,1651.168,1652.452,"--That, I'm not sure--"
1984.83-1065,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1652.452,1654.687,"That sounds very logical, in other words, sensible."
1984.83-1065,0,16067,allan_van_gestel,,1654.687,1659.341,"--It doesn't sound very nice, either, but I am not sure it is the basis to hold the private landowners hostage."
1984.83-1065,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1680.521,1682.956,Tactical reasons that they would have ratified or something?
1984.83-1065,0,16067,allan_van_gestel,,1682.956,1686.658,--The tactical reason being that they felt they would lose the ability--
1984.83-1065,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1686.658,1687.458,To bring this suit.
1984.83-1065,0,16067,allan_van_gestel,,1687.458,1689.693,"--To bring this suit, yes."
1984.83-1065,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1734.572,1736.008,They agree with you on the merits.
1984.83-1065,0,16067,allan_van_gestel,,1736.008,1763.658,"They do agree on the merits, and I think we should win on the merits, Your Honor, but nevertheless, assuming we do not, we then face the Eleventh Amendment, and I suggest that under the analysis set forth in our brief, what the State of New York did was they waived their Eleventh Amendment rights when the State of New York ratified the United States Constitution in September of 1788, which included, among other things, the commerce clause which placed--"
1984.83-1065,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1763.658,1767.543,"But isn't there a... isn't there a state ground for their being immune, too, or not?"
1984.83-1065,0,16067,allan_van_gestel,,1767.543,1770.662,"--I'm unaware of a state ground, Your Honor."
1984.83-1065,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1770.662,1772.847,You mean there isn't one they now claim anyway.
1984.83-1065,0,16067,allan_van_gestel,,1772.847,1787.374,"None that I'm aware of, and it seems to me that once the State of New York agreed that all management of affairs with Indians fell in with the federal government, therefore they were in a position in which they waived their rights."
1984.83-1065,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1787.374,1789.142,May I just ask one question on the Eleventh Amendment?
1984.83-1065,0,16067,allan_van_gestel,,1795.046,1799.931,"I doubt it, I doubt it."
1984.83-1065,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1810.139,1819.995,"You mean if you lose this case on the merits, you couldn't bring an independent suit in the state court for... against the state?"
1984.83-1065,0,16067,allan_van_gestel,,1819.995,1822.363,"We certainly would try, but I'm not at all confident that--"
1984.83-1065,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1822.363,1824.363,But what would be the defense'?
1984.83-1065,0,16067,allan_van_gestel,,1824.363,1828.516,"--I suppose the defense, among other things, would be a sovereign immunity type defense."
1984.83-1065,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1828.516,1829.716,Well that's what I was asking you before.
1984.83-1065,0,16067,allan_van_gestel,,1838.139,1842.61,"There is already litigation pending against the state, thus far not successful."
1984.83-1065,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1852.482,1854.418,Mr. Schiff.
1984.83-1065,1,38303,peter_h_schiff,,1854.418,1857.786,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1984.83-1065,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2250.956,2255.777,You don't mean that the test in Edelman is inapplicable.
1984.83-1065,1,38303,peter_h_schiff,,2258.093,2265.215,"Yes, I stand corrected, the test in Edelman is applicable, but it doesn't help the counties."
1984.83-1065,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2278.206,2280.992,"Well, you say it doesn't help the county, but does it help you?"
1984.83-1065,1,38303,peter_h_schiff,,2280.992,2283.194,"Oh, I think so because if you don't show that--"
1984.83-1065,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2283.194,2283.894,"Well, that... better--"
1984.83-1065,1,38303,peter_h_schiff,,2283.894,2284.544,--If--
1984.83-1065,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2284.544,2285.296,--That's the bottom line.
1984.83-1065,1,38303,peter_h_schiff,,2285.296,2297.52,"--Well, if you don't meet that threshold test, as I understand it, it simply isn't any... waiver could not have taken place."
1984.83-1065,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2518.045,2524.049,Did you raise some state law defense to state liability in this?
1984.83-1065,1,38303,peter_h_schiff,,2524.049,2524.582,I'm sorry.
1984.83-1065,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2524.582,2533.238,Did you raise any state grounds for being immune from liability over it?
1984.83-1065,1,38303,peter_h_schiff,,2533.238,2539.376,"Well, we have... we contend that the only liability could be under the Real Property Act--"
1984.83-1065,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2539.376,2540.042,"Well, this is--"
1984.83-1065,1,38303,peter_h_schiff,,2540.042,2542.528,--Which would not be in the federal court.
1984.83-1065,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2542.528,2547.647,--The county has claimed over against the state in this case.
1984.83-1065,1,38303,peter_h_schiff,,2547.647,2548.431,That's right.
1984.83-1065,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2548.431,2554.318,"And did you assert any defense to that claim over based on the state law, did you in this case?"
1984.83-1065,1,38303,peter_h_schiff,,2554.318,2555.67,"Well, we also argue that--"
1984.83-1065,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2555.67,2556.703,"Well, did you or not?"
1984.83-1065,1,38303,peter_h_schiff,,2557.853,2564.193,"--Well, I think we raised a defense that the law that was applied below, Justice White, was applied incorrectly."
1984.83-1065,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2564.193,2567.495,"What did you raise, what did you raise in the trial court?"
1984.83-1065,1,38303,peter_h_schiff,,2569.761,2576.165,I think we claimed sovereign immunity essentially.
1984.83-1065,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2576.165,2579.367,"On Eleventh Amendment grounds, but on state ground, too?"
1984.83-1065,1,38303,peter_h_schiff,,2579.367,2582.652,"Well, the argument in state is--"
1984.83-1065,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2582.652,2598.428,"I would think if you had claimed the state ground, that federal... the court would have decided the case on... never would have needed to reach the Eleventh Amendment."
1984.83-1065,1,38303,peter_h_schiff,,2598.428,2607.45,"--Well, as far as I read it, there was an argument before Judge Port, and we argued the real property law."
1984.83-1065,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2631.566,2633.351,"Well, what--"
1984.83-1065,1,38303,peter_h_schiff,,2633.351,2634.234,And the--
1984.83-1065,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2634.234,2641.957,"--What business would we have reaching the Eleventh, a federal constitutional issue if the case could go off on a state ground?"
1984.83-1065,1,38303,peter_h_schiff,,2641.957,2651.063,"--Well, I think that there is a threshold jurisdictional question, but that might be appropriate as well."
1984.83-1065,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2746.791,2751.495,Ms. Locklear?
1984.83-1065,2,16397,arlinda_f_locklear,,2751.495,2754.546,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1984.83-1065,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2878.761,2881.546,"The advice of the Attorney General doesn't make the law, does it?"
1984.83-1065,2,16397,arlinda_f_locklear,,2881.546,2884.598,"No, Your Honor, it does not, but what it does do is indicate--"
1984.83-1065,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2884.598,2887.367,I know that... I know some Attorneys General would like it that way.
1984.83-1065,2,16397,arlinda_f_locklear,,2887.367,2898.573,"--What it does do in this case, Justice White, is indicate that the state was acting not in ignorance of the law but had been put on notice that at least in the view of--"
1984.83-1065,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2898.573,2903.21,"Well, they could just have... could just honestly have disagreed with the Attorney General."
1984.83-1065,2,16397,arlinda_f_locklear,,2907.095,2911.233,"--Had that been the case, one might have expected a response, but Governor Jay did not respond."
1984.83-1065,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2912.049,2914.535,"Well, he may have thought it was a frivolous fight."
1984.83-1065,2,16397,arlinda_f_locklear,,2914.535,2917.069,"--That's possible, Your Honor, that's entirely possible."
1984.83-1065,3,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,4544.704,4547.992,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:"
1984.83-1065,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4580.629,4587.783,Are you going to say in your argument why you think the statute of limitations claim is limited?
1984.83-1065,3,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,4587.783,4594.371,I didn't mean to imply that the claim is limited; all I meant is that the issues are confined.
1984.83-1065,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4597.655,4598.607,I see what you men.
1984.83-1065,3,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,4598.607,4613.017,"--In fact, the point I would like to make with respect to the statute of limitations issue is that the arguments that are being advanced here go far beyond eastern land claims, and they go far beyond old claims as opposed to new ones."
1984.83-1065,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4649.957,4650.99,Why would that be so?
1984.83-1065,3,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,4654.261,4655.094,"Well, but the--"
1984.83-1065,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4655.094,4655.561,--They'd all be barred.
1984.83-1065,3,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,4655.561,4660.915,--One of the difficulties is that the... as--
1984.83-1065,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4660.915,4665.9,It is unusual to hear the suggestion that getting rid of a great mass of litigation would cause chaos.
1984.83-1065,3,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,4665.9,4682.344,--What the effect would be would be to create pressure for the United States to sue in perhaps a shorter period of time to resolve the claim in its own mind in a shorter period of time than Congress has intended to allow the United States to have in assessing a claim.
1984.83-1065,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4682.344,4686.113,"Well, Congress had to get around telling the Department of Interior to get with it, didn't they?"
1984.83-1065,3,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,4686.113,4702.492,"Well, that's right, but one of the... but it's important that in the background of the extensions of the statutes of limitation, one of the things Congress focused on each time it extended the statute of limitations was the vast number of claims that the Interior Department had to deal with, specifically, in that case, the claims that predated 1966."
1984.83-1065,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4729.475,4741.367,"Well, I don't think anyone is contending that after Congress prescribed particular limitations, end up in 1982, that state statutes apply."
1984.83-1065,3,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,4746.521,4769.736,"Well, but I had understood Petitioners to be arguing that the 2415 and the Indian Claims Limitation Act of 1982 have nothing to do with claims brought by tribes, and we think that that is clearly wrong both because, as Ms. Locklear pointed out, that the text and legislative history of the act shows that Congress intended it to apply to Indian claims, but also that it is the appropriate source of a statute of limitations."
1984.83-1065,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4769.736,4774.938,"Well, where does the text of the act show that it was intended to apply to claims by Indian tribes?"
1984.83-1065,3,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,4774.938,4801.088,"Well, specifically with respect to the procedures that Ms. Locklear referred to before with respect to furnishing the tribes, this is the procedure for the older damage claims, with respect to furnishing the tribes with the information about their claims and giving them one year within which to assess it, and then the Indian Claims Limitation Act says that any cause of action not brought within a year shall be barred, not just a cause of action by the United States, and this isn't just in 2415."
1984.83-1065,3,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,4814.415,4826.973,"Well, what is the relevance of those statutes relating to 2415 and the 1982 amendments to the 1970 lawsuit brought before they were enacted?"
1984.83-1065,3,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,4826.973,4834.143,"Well, I think what they are are the most recent manifestation of the accepted rule that has governed in Indian law."
1984.83-1065,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4863.746,4865.648,But the United States didn't bring this suit.
1984.83-1065,3,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,4865.648,4883.742,"But I think that the background that the United States is not barred is important with respect to this because the United... when the United States is litigating in the area of Indian affairs, it is typically bringing a cause of action with respect to property that it holds in trust for a beneficiary."
