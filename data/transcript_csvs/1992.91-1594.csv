1992.91-1594,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.177,"We'll hear argument next in Number 91-1594, Fred Edenfield v. Scott Fane."
1992.91-1594,0,38382,parker_d_thomson,,22.726,29.381,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1992.91-1594,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,86.177,88.959,"Mr. Thomson, may I just interrupt on this one question?"
1992.91-1594,0,38382,parker_d_thomson,,106.699,114.016,"The definition in the statute... I mean, in the rule, is of one that requests an immediate oral response."
1992.91-1594,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,122.601,131.837,Is there some empirical evidence that shows this sort of a request was made frequently?
1992.91-1594,0,38382,parker_d_thomson,,164.79,175.897,"The prohibition, Mr. Chief Justice, is of a circumstance, that is an event, a method of presentation."
1992.91-1594,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,195.778,197.571,That's not... that wasn't my question.
1992.91-1594,0,38382,parker_d_thomson,,197.571,198.11,--Excuse me.
1992.91-1594,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,198.11,213.611,"My question was, did the State of Florida or agency have some sort of empirical evidence before it that this sort of request, with a request for an immediate answer, was common or prevalent among accountants?"
1992.91-1594,0,38382,parker_d_thomson,,213.611,214.572,"No, Your Honor."
1992.91-1594,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,232.693,248.643,"Does the agency advance any particular reason why it selected this kind of conduct, if there were no empirical evidence why it picked out this demand for an immediate response?"
1992.91-1594,0,38382,parker_d_thomson,,248.643,261.333,There are two basic reasons that go to the two basic purposes of the governance of certified public accountants in the State of Florida.
1992.91-1594,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,378.378,386.224,"Mr. Thomson, does Florida have the same prohibition on the books with regard to attorneys?"
1992.91-1594,0,38382,parker_d_thomson,,386.224,387.333,Yes.
1992.91-1594,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,393.648,396.97,How about any other profession in Florida?
1992.91-1594,0,38382,parker_d_thomson,,400.112,412.621,"--No... Your Honor, I cannot answer your question specifically, but I believe that there are other... there are other of the so-called learned professions in which there are such prohibitions."
1992.91-1594,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,416.885,428.242,And no evidence was offered that the in-person solicitation gave rise to overreaching or deception or anything of that kind.
1992.91-1594,0,38382,parker_d_thomson,,428.242,429.962,"--No empirical evidence, Your Honor."
1992.91-1594,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,455.51,466.767,Did the legislature command this sort of a regulation?
1992.91-1594,0,38382,parker_d_thomson,,466.767,467.579,"Yes, Your Honor."
1992.91-1594,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,476.335,479.516,And the board--
1992.91-1594,0,38382,parker_d_thomson,,479.516,486.499,"I might say, Your Honor, that the prohibition in the statute is of direct, in-person, uninvited solicitation."
1992.91-1594,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,493.745,501.79,--What was declared unconstitutional?
1992.91-1594,0,38382,parker_d_thomson,,501.79,503.172,The statute and--
1992.91-1594,1,21650,david_c_vladeck,,1590.743,1591.264,"Yes, Your Honor."
1992.91-1594,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1591.264,1593.465,You may proceed.
1992.91-1594,1,21650,david_c_vladeck,,1593.465,1596.317,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1992.91-1594,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1638.627,1649.834,"It banned something besides direct solicitations, something besides those that demanded an immediate response."
1992.91-1594,1,21650,david_c_vladeck,,1649.834,1652.206,"Right, that's correct, Your Honor, though--"
1992.91-1594,2,38382,parker_d_thomson,,3016.114,3019.935,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1992.91-1594,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3036.046,3037.809,"Now, where are you reading from?"
1992.91-1594,2,38382,parker_d_thomson,,3037.809,3049.126,--I am reading... it is... it is an appendix to our brief--
1992.91-1594,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3049.126,3050.468,A-15 of the blue brief.
1992.91-1594,2,38382,parker_d_thomson,,3050.468,3052.108,--On A-15.
1992.91-1594,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3052.108,3055.28,A-15 to the blue brief?
1992.91-1594,2,38382,parker_d_thomson,,3055.28,3057.009,"A-15... A-15, Mr. Chief Justice."
1992.91-1594,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3057.009,3058.381,And whereabouts on A-15?
1992.91-1594,2,38382,parker_d_thomson,,3058.381,3074.721,"At the very top of the page: for purposes of this rule, the term direct, in-person, uninvited solicitation shall be deemed and construed to mean any communication which directly or implicitly requests an immediate oral response from the recipient."
1992.91-1594,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3077.752,3082.396,And you're telling us that this regulation was duly enacted by the board.
1992.91-1594,2,38382,parker_d_thomson,,3082.396,3098.446,"--That is correct, Your Honor, and what I started to say is, I do not want to suggest to this Court that the board is going to look... would look favorably on a request because it is their assumption that it would implicitly respond."
1992.91-1594,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3110.735,3113.509,"In fact, the next sentence in the regulation makes that rather clear."
1992.91-1594,2,38382,parker_d_thomson,,3113.509,3113.527,Correct.
1992.91-1594,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3113.527,3116.959,"Uninvited, in-person visits, and so forth, are prohibited."
1992.91-1594,2,38382,parker_d_thomson,,3116.959,3128.777,"Correct, Your Honor, and I did not want in any way to be... to suggest that the Court is going to look favorably on a request with respect to this matter."
1992.91-1594,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3158.165,3171.385,"But the second sentence that Justice Stevens just referred to does say uninvited, in-person visits or conversations or telephone calls to a specific potential client are prohibited."
1992.91-1594,2,38382,parker_d_thomson,,3180.121,3193.83,"Your Honor, I believe, reading the two sentences together, that there is an assumption that when such a call is made that it implicitly... at least implicitly requests a response."
1992.91-1594,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3193.83,3198.324,Even though no such response is requested by the caller.
1992.91-1594,2,38382,parker_d_thomson,,3198.324,3205.557,"Absolutely if no response... the question was asked to me before, what if I don't want your response?"
1992.91-1594,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3217.054,3231.934,"It seems to me, Mr. Thomson, that the whole purpose of that which directly or implicitly requests an immediate oral response is simply to distinguish the situation described in the last sentence, indirect forms of... such as giving speeches."
1992.91-1594,2,38382,parker_d_thomson,,3246.573,3253.789,"Well, certainly, as the words of the statute... as I said before, I do not believe that the board attempted to gut the statute with this rule."
1992.91-1594,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3253.789,3265.366,What do you say the State's interest is in doing that?
1992.91-1594,2,38382,parker_d_thomson,,3265.366,3266.909,The State's interest is dual.
1992.91-1594,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3296.187,3298.729,"Thank you, Mr. Thomson."
