1979.79-394,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,64.751,We will hear arguments next in the United States v. Ward and others.
1979.79-394,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,73.672,76.919,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1979.79-394,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,292.649,299.057,$500 doesn't go very far in cleaning up oil spills.
1979.79-394,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,301.715,303.368,I do not know the present balance.
1979.79-394,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,605.348,614.41,"Did the Court of Appeals make any effort to distinguish Helvering v. Mitchell, the Justice Brandeis opinion?"
1979.79-394,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,614.41,616.829,Right.
1979.79-394,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,619.701,624.285,I was just looking through it and it seemed to me it did not really mention it.
1979.79-394,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,624.285,626.824,I frankly do not recall if it was specifically mentioned.
1979.79-394,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,639.915,645.203,But it was also dealing with the self-reporting requirement of income tax.
1979.79-394,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,645.203,645.973,That is right.
1979.79-394,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,673.006,678.604,"Well, let me read you this language from Helvering v. Mitchell on page 309 of 303 U.S."
1979.79-394,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,707.92,709.84,"Yes, in that sense it does."
1979.79-394,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,771.449,782.167,"The tax statute that Mr. Justice Rehnquist referred to, of course the disclosure of information is required in order to decide the tax liability and the tax consequences."
1979.79-394,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,793.388,797.825,Not specifically.
1979.79-394,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,826.22,830.962,Did the Court of Appeals cite California v. Byers?
1979.79-394,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,832.471,835.069,Not to my recollection.
1979.79-394,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,835.069,843.886,They also said that that is primarily related to that that statute in California v. Byers is related to the civil aspects.
1979.79-394,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,851.609,852.685,To be sure.
1979.79-394,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,866.305,885.295,"The judgment in Byers is that the citizens of California rare compelled to leave their name and address if they had an automobile accident, and then that could be used against them in either civil or criminal."
1979.79-394,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,885.295,885.652,"That is right, that is right."
1979.79-394,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,910.193,920.167,I suppose you have no way of knowing now whether the California v. Byers was called to the attention of the Tenth Circuit.
1979.79-394,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,920.167,924.123,I don't know whether it was cited in our brief.
1979.79-394,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,924.123,930.936,"I would assume that the United States Attorney presenting it would have been aware of that case, wouldn't you?"
1979.79-394,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,930.936,931.717,It was cited.
1979.79-394,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,931.717,932.369,It was cited?
1979.79-394,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,932.369,938.649,Yes.
1979.79-394,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1081.01,1092.896,"Well, was the claim made -- I suppose the Respondent here made the self-incrimination claim very early in the proceeding."
1979.79-394,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1092.896,1093.707,Right.
1979.79-394,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1097.735,1101.251,But -- when what?
1979.79-394,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1105.638,1106.655,Right.
1979.79-394,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1132.567,1145.265,"Well, in the tax laws if someone wants -- isn't it the rule that if you want to claim your Fifth Amendment privilege you should claim it in connection with the matter that you don't want to report?"
1979.79-394,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1145.265,1160.79,"Well, in this particular case the provision requiring a report under Section 311(b)(5) contains an expressed immunity clause similar in language to other immunity provisions although in this case it is self-executing, there is no requirement."
1979.79-394,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1160.79,1165.528,So you automatically are -- you cannot be convicted at all.
1979.79-394,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1165.528,1167.066,It says it shall not be used in a criminal case.
1979.79-394,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1180.282,1198.584,"Well, in filing a tax return it is not unknown, is it, that certain expenses and deductions will be claimed, have been claimed but the detailed explanation is reserved on Fifth Amendment grounds."
1979.79-394,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1198.584,1200.978,I think that would be an appropriate --
1979.79-394,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1200.978,1208.786,"Now, that of course might arouse the interest of an Internal Revenue agent somewhat but that is the way to go about it."
1979.79-394,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1208.786,1209.3,That is right.
1979.79-394,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1429.609,1440.61,"Mr. Kneedler, is it correct however that even if the oil spill were entirely cleaned up by the person who reported it be nevertheless might have a penalty assessed against him?"
1979.79-394,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1440.61,1443.022,"Yes, indeed -- excuse me."
1979.79-394,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1482.232,1489.026,"As far as the legal issue is concerned, I understand the amount of the penalty can now be larger than at the time."
1979.79-394,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1489.026,1490.874,Yes.
1979.79-394,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1512.958,1531.315,"But as a matter of statutorial or constitutional power I would suppose that if the agency thought it were extremely serious and they wanted to deter future carelessness, even though there were no harm in the particular case, they could assess a penalty of $150,000 and we would have exactly the same legal issue, wouldn't we?"
1979.79-394,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1531.315,1550.531,"Yes, I think -- it is essentially the same legal issue although several of this Court's decisions, I think most recently in One Lot Emerald Cut Stones, has suggested that the penalty is so disproportionate to the conduct for which the penalty is attached that at that point it might be regarded as criminal."
1979.79-394,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1550.531,1551.125,Punitive.
1979.79-394,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1551.125,1564.152,But the statutory language both in the civil penalty provision involved here and also in the new one enacted in 1978 both specifically provide that the penalty should be tailored to the gravity of the offense.
1979.79-394,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1574.211,1593.895,"Mr. Kneedler, do you think it would be constitutional for the Congress to pass a law requiring motorists to report every time they exceeded the 55-mile limit and to pay a civil penalty of $5 a mile for the excess and say that the report could not be used in any criminal case against them?"
1979.79-394,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1593.895,1605.02,"Well, I think in terms of the self-incrimination clause there would be no constitutional question because of the specific language of the --"
1979.79-394,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1605.02,1611.864,"Certainly there is as great an interest in preventing death on the highway, I suppose, as there is in preventing oil spills."
1979.79-394,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1611.864,1612.529,That is right.
1979.79-394,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1612.529,1618.456,I should think your rationale would justify such a statute.
1979.79-394,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1618.456,1626.323,"Yes, I am trying -- I am not sure what the constitutional objection would be outside of the self-incrimination clause."
1979.79-394,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1714.687,1719.344,"Tell me again, what happens if you don't file the report at all?"
1979.79-394,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1719.344,1722.813,"If you don't file the report, you are subject to criminal liabilities for non-filing."
1979.79-394,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1725.21,1727.041,Failure to file an income tax return?
1979.79-394,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1727.041,1728.917,Right.
1979.79-394,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1769.398,1799.707,"Going back to Mr. Justice Stevens' hypothetical, suppose the statute provided that anyone going over 55 miles an hour had to make a report saying exactly what his speed was and his average point to point and $50 or $5 for each mile over 55; but that failure to file a report at all would be a $500 fine -- not criminal, $500 civil penalty."
1979.79-394,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1806.35,1806.854,Yes.
1979.79-394,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1840.151,1849.294,Should the civil penalty reach dimensions that would raise Fifth Amendment issues.
1979.79-394,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1855.447,1863.05,"Well, I would be reluctant to say that $5,000 would be a particular cutoff point."
1979.79-394,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1872.738,1884.542,"Suppose that it provided that forfeiture of the truck would follow; forfeiture of the vehicle, total forfeiture would be the civil penalty?"
1979.79-394,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1884.542,1897.293,"Well, in the Court's decision in Clara Toledo, for example, the Court upheld the forfeiture of a yacht that was based on essentially non--"
1979.79-394,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1897.293,1899.11,Registration error.
1979.79-394,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1899.11,1900.353,Right.
1979.79-394,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1916.616,1917.998,Mr. Jones.
1979.79-394,1,41544,stephen_jones,,1917.998,1920.691,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1979.79-394,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1973.317,1979.481,It is a stricter standard than the law that requires one to file in income tax return?
1979.79-394,1,41544,stephen_jones,,1979.481,1980.253,Yes.
1979.79-394,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1981.931,1984.237,"Well, generally speaking."
1979.79-394,1,41544,stephen_jones,,1984.237,1988.836,"Yes, sir, under the statutory scheme."
1979.79-394,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2029.207,2039.992,"But in Helvering, Justice Brandois says to insure full and honest disclosure to discourage fraudulent attempts to evade the tax Congress imposes sanctions."
1979.79-394,1,41544,stephen_jones,,2045.1,2054.404,"Sir, as I read Helvering and Sullivan and the other income tax cases and also Byers which I wanted to speak to, the information is essentially neutral."
1979.79-394,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2139.838,2143.893,Incriminating only if you assume the answer to the issue --
1979.79-394,1,41544,stephen_jones,,2143.893,2144.047,"Yes, sir."
1979.79-394,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2144.047,2145.089,-- it is a criminal case.
1979.79-394,1,41544,stephen_jones,,2145.089,2145.332,"Yes, sir."
1979.79-394,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2365.788,2373.67,"Mr. Jones, the cases you are referring to, do you treat the collection process as a criminal or not?"
1979.79-394,1,41544,stephen_jones,,2380.016,2380.82,"No, sir."
1979.79-394,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2390.993,2395.796,You mean there are cases saying that there can be no civil fines?
1979.79-394,1,41544,stephen_jones,,2395.796,2398.87,"No, sir."
1979.79-394,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2398.87,2402.338,All supposedly civil fines are criminal?
1979.79-394,1,41544,stephen_jones,,2402.338,2403.594,"No, sir."
1979.79-394,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2420.127,2420.525,Well --
1979.79-394,1,41544,stephen_jones,,2420.525,2421.851,That was specifically the issue in Lees.
1979.79-394,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2421.851,2426.848,"Yes, but that could be just because it would incriminate him in some other case."
1979.79-394,1,41544,stephen_jones,,2426.848,2428.258,"Well, no, sir."
1979.79-394,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2428.889,2434.628,"It is not because the civil collection proceeding in criminal, is it?"
1979.79-394,1,41544,stephen_jones,,2434.628,2435.259,"Yes, sir."
1979.79-394,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2598.434,2613.142,"I wouldn't think, counsel, that strict liability really helped you, because it cuts out all notion of mons re I think traditionally associated with culpable intent that are also associated with crime."
1979.79-394,1,41544,stephen_jones,,2617.785,2622.68,"Well, Your Honor, you can go to jail for strict liability crimes even though there is no mons re."
1979.79-394,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2623.609,2628.24,"Well, but what we are arguing here is whether this is a crime or a civil assessed penalty."
1979.79-394,1,41544,stephen_jones,,2628.24,2630.939,There is a unique feature about this.
1979.79-394,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2778.306,2782.747,"But Congress had already carved out a quite different use immunity provision, hadn't it?"
1979.79-394,1,41544,stephen_jones,,2782.747,2786.556,A use immunity for what Congress called a criminal proceeding.
1979.79-394,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2786.556,2786.988,Yes.
1979.79-394,1,41544,stephen_jones,,2786.988,2799.72,"Now, the way we feel that is significant here is that it meets the argument of the Government that if this Court would uphold the Tenth Circuit it would severely retard the enforcement of this Act."
1979.79-394,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2813.101,2816.003,"But it would still be a criminal proceeding, wouldn't it?"
1979.79-394,1,41544,stephen_jones,,2816.003,2817.856,"Yes, sir, it would be a criminal proceeding."
1979.79-394,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2817.856,2820.911,And how about the burden of proof?
1979.79-394,1,41544,stephen_jones,,2822.552,2823.401,"No, sir."
1979.79-394,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2824.148,2827.171,A criminal proceeding?
1979.79-394,1,41544,stephen_jones,,2827.171,2836.816,"Mr. Justice White, this Court has never held that actions to collect civil penalties, even if they are quasi-criminal, involve the right to a jury trial."
1979.79-394,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2840.712,2849.163,"I know, but how -- what is the theory of saying this is a criminal proceeding for purposes of the Fifth Amendment and not for the Sixth?"
1979.79-394,1,41544,stephen_jones,,2849.163,2874.022,"If we examine the cases closely what emerges to us, that the teaching of the case is just this - that the self-incrimination clause of the Fifth Amendment has a very high priority in our scheme of ordered liberty and that we are going -- I mean the courts are going to protect that and give it a greater breadth than we would otherwise enumerate in first ten Amendments."
1979.79-394,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2879.562,2886.15,If the Government sues to collect a civil fine you can have summary judgment and --
1979.79-394,1,41544,stephen_jones,,2886.15,2886.784,"Yes, sir."
1979.79-394,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2886.784,2888.575,And directed verdicts.
1979.79-394,1,41544,stephen_jones,,2888.575,2889.995,"Yes, sir."
1979.79-394,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2889.995,2891.937,And preponderance of the evidence.
1979.79-394,1,41544,stephen_jones,,2891.937,2892.992,"Yes, sir."
1979.79-394,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2892.992,2894.036,No juries.
1979.79-394,1,41544,stephen_jones,,2894.036,2895.609,"Yes, sir."
1979.79-394,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2926.263,2934.863,The Government advanced an argument which it has not repeated in its brief on the merit and that is that --
1979.79-394,1,41544,stephen_jones,,2934.863,2942.762,"Reason number one, they gave come interesting statistics concerning oil spills."
1979.79-394,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3181.001,3181.939,"Thank you, gentlemen."
