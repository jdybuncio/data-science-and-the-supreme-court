1967.257,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,20.744,"No. 257, Federal Maritime Commission, et. al., petitioner versus Svenska Amerika Linien and 258, The American Society of Travel Agents versus Svenska Amerika Linien."
1967.257,0,28683,irwin_a_seibel,,23.712,27.502,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1967.257,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,296.255,301.862,"These conference/agreements, I suppose, are very old and were filed under Sectiion15 long ago?"
1967.257,0,28683,irwin_a_seibel,,301.862,302.68,That’s right.
1967.257,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,302.68,303.693,Is that correct?
1967.257,0,28683,irwin_a_seibel,,303.693,304.123,Indeed.
1967.257,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,304.123,308.956,And did they from the -- have they always contain these two provisions?
1967.257,0,28683,irwin_a_seibel,,308.956,309.901,Almost always.
1967.257,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,318.337,327.705,"So up until now, they’ve been approved as part of the agreements that were filed under Section 15?"
1967.257,0,28683,irwin_a_seibel,,327.705,328.446,Exactly!
1967.257,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,328.767,331.997,"And here, they were attacked by your client?"
1967.257,0,28683,irwin_a_seibel,,331.997,334.566,This had been approved in the course of the non-adversary proceeding.
1967.257,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,334.566,335.337,In non-adversary proceeding?
1967.257,0,28683,irwin_a_seibel,,335.337,335.838,Yes.
1967.257,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,335.838,339.022,And that it was your client who --
1967.257,0,28683,irwin_a_seibel,,339.022,339.364,"No, no."
1967.257,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,341.756,342.666,Surely.
1967.257,0,28683,irwin_a_seibel,,343.326,346.472,If Mr. (Inaudible) that way.
1967.257,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,346.472,349.23,But the travel agents attacked the --
1967.257,0,28683,irwin_a_seibel,,349.23,350.732,"Yes, Your Honor."
1967.257,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,356.028,359.033,Right.
1967.257,0,28683,irwin_a_seibel,,359.033,383.561,"Now the travel agent, instead of recommending the disapproval of this so-called “unanimity rule” recommended only that the seven conference lines who do not serve the United States ports and therefore, derived little of any business from travel agents from the United States not be permitted to vote on the rates of commission payable to the travel agents."
1967.257,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,422.089,427.057,"Would you mind stating again, what was the qualification of the examiner?"
1967.257,0,28683,irwin_a_seibel,,427.057,432.824,The examiner did not recommend disapproval of the unanimity rule.
1967.257,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,671.064,674.34,Was further evidence taken on remand?
1967.257,0,28683,irwin_a_seibel,,674.34,695.252,"No, Your Honor, the Court had not suggested that further evidence be taken and nobody before the commission expressed their willingness to -- the parties submitted additional briefs and re-argued the issues before the Commission."
1967.257,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,695.252,701.539,"Well, on the next go around, the Court did criticize the Commission for not taking --"
1967.257,0,28683,irwin_a_seibel,,701.539,701.967,"Yes, Your Honor."
1967.257,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,701.967,704.919,-- additional evidence.
1967.257,0,28683,irwin_a_seibel,,704.919,708.352,All of us were surprised that finding that criticism but.
1967.257,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,708.352,713.244,That frequently happens to lawyers.
1967.257,0,28683,irwin_a_seibel,,713.244,733.193,"The Commission found that the tying rule, the rule that ties the agents to the conference lines and forbids them from selling to competing non-conference lines, was seriously more anticompetitive than was necessary to served any legitimate Shipping Act function."
1967.257,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,807.99,814.097,Did it remand the case to the Commissions or the agents there --
1967.257,0,28683,irwin_a_seibel,,814.097,814.248,Yes.
1967.257,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,814.248,818.672,-- have any further hearings or did it just reverse it out of --
1967.257,0,28683,irwin_a_seibel,,818.672,823.331,"The Court of Appeals on it’s first opinion, remanded it to the Commission."
1967.257,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,823.331,824.327,How about the second opinion?
1967.257,0,28683,irwin_a_seibel,,824.327,828.438,"The second opinion, it reversed and did not remand."
1967.257,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,831.735,841.214,Are you challenging that part of the Order because they did not -- because they decided for themselves instead of sending it back to the Commission?
1967.257,0,28683,irwin_a_seibel,,841.214,845.057,We have not challenged it because we thought it would be destruction.
1967.257,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,849.459,850.232,But suppose –
1967.257,0,28683,irwin_a_seibel,,850.232,850.558,This case --
1967.257,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,850.558,851.556,-- they hold it’s not.
1967.257,0,28683,irwin_a_seibel,,864.509,868.026,"Well, we think this case -- I’m not agreeing with that, Your Honor."
1967.257,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,885.342,892.714,All I want to find out is if the government has agreed that the Court has a right to end the case.
1967.257,0,28683,irwin_a_seibel,,892.714,895.312,"I don’t think the Court has a right to end the case, Your Honor."
1967.257,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,897.7,900.872,"Well, that’s the result of its action, isn’t it?"
1967.257,0,28683,irwin_a_seibel,,900.872,905.407,"Yes, it is but the result of its action is to end the case, however."
1967.257,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1059.906,1064.565,What are the present commissions paid to travel agents?
1967.257,0,28683,irwin_a_seibel,,1064.565,1076.044,The present commissions are 7% on point to point bookings and 10% on tourist package.
1967.257,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1076.044,1080.076,And how about -- what do airlines pay?
1967.257,0,28683,irwin_a_seibel,,1080.076,1082.767,"The airlines pay the same amount now, Your Honor."
1967.257,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1147.484,1156.26,Do these two provisions involve only travel agents in the United States of America?
1967.257,0,28683,irwin_a_seibel,,1156.26,1157.54,"Yes, Your Honor, travel agents."
1967.257,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1160.525,1161.336,Was there any --
1967.257,0,28683,irwin_a_seibel,,1161.336,1162.296,"In Canada as well, Your Honor."
1967.257,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1162.296,1171.919,-- finding as to the amount of work that it takes an agent to negotiate one of these tickets?
1967.257,0,28683,irwin_a_seibel,,1171.919,1172.457,"Yes, Your Honor."
1967.257,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1172.457,1173.673,Same on the Act?
1967.257,0,28683,irwin_a_seibel,,1173.673,1204.122,"The Commission was aware that it took a lot more time of the travel agents to book steamship passage than airlines and therefore pointed out even though the rates of commission ultimately -- the rates of commission pay travel agents for the steamship lines ultimately was on the same level as the airlines, the effective level of the commission because of the extra time was lower."
1967.257,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1290.614,1297.186,"And all the Commission did, if I understood you correctly, was to disapprove and cancel this rule."
1967.257,0,28683,irwin_a_seibel,,1298.394,1299.955,That’s right.
1967.257,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1299.955,1301.824,Although it does have power to modify?
1967.257,0,28683,irwin_a_seibel,,1301.824,1302.274,"Yes, Your Honor."
1967.257,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1302.274,1303.036,Is it not?
1967.257,0,28683,irwin_a_seibel,,1303.036,1303.507,That’s right.
1967.257,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1303.507,1304.468,It did not exercise that.
1967.257,0,28683,irwin_a_seibel,,1304.468,1309.027,"It did not exercise that power, it ordered them to eliminate this particular rule."
1967.257,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1309.027,1312.948,Without implying that no similar rule could --
1967.257,0,28683,irwin_a_seibel,,1312.948,1314.888,That’s right.
1967.257,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1314.888,1323.879,I understand you to say that the majority of the members of the conference were in favor of the government’s position?
1967.257,0,28683,irwin_a_seibel,,1323.879,1325.455,"Yes, Your Honor."
1967.257,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1434.788,1439.606,How many of these conference members have --
1967.257,0,28683,irwin_a_seibel,,1439.606,1446.628,There are 22 foreign lines in one and 23 foreign lines in the other.
1967.257,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1566.926,1585.347,"The technical grammar, I suppose is that gives the commission power to disapprove or cancel or modify any agreement or any modification/cancellation thereof but not a component provision of an agreement."
1967.257,0,28683,irwin_a_seibel,,1591.74,1594.521,The agreement is the conference agreement but I’m sure --
1967.257,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1594.521,1599.13,These are just two separate provisions of the agreement. You don’t have any difficulty to that.
1967.257,0,28683,irwin_a_seibel,,1599.13,1601.524,"No, I don’t have any difficulty, that’s always been accepted."
1967.257,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1849.438,1853.426,How does one go about booking on non- conference line?
1967.257,0,28683,irwin_a_seibel,,1853.426,1871.884,"Well, if you can go directly to the non-conference -- the company owing the non-conference vessel or if you can find a non-conference agent, there are some travel agents who are not."
1967.257,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1913.295,1949.946,"So I don’t want to disrupt your plan or order of argument but I would like to hear your views as to what I consider in a way to be the determinative factors in the Court’s opinions and I don’t gather that there is any extensive quarrel about facts of the merits of this thing but it seems to me that what the Court says is, number 1, Maritime Commission applied the wrong standard."
1967.257,0,28683,irwin_a_seibel,,2027.102,2028.231,"Yes, Your Honor."
1967.257,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2028.231,2073.726,"So you had five different judges of the Court of Appeals who arrived at the same conclusion and that conclusion, whatever the detailed reasons being, there were really as I read this to the effect that the Commission just didn’t do its job in terms of writing and in terms of setting code, the findings required by the Act in terms of the analytical and craftsmanship for part of the responsibility of an administrative agency where upon which our administrative jurisprudence is based and what do you say to that?"
1967.257,0,28683,irwin_a_seibel,,2073.726,2082.612,"I’d say to that, first let me say, Your Honor, I’m imposing upon my co-counsel’s time, I would like to answer the first part of your question and I’m sure he --"
1967.257,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2082.612,2085.425,I don’t want to burden you and just so that --
1967.257,0,28683,irwin_a_seibel,,2085.425,2086.231,"Well, let me --"
1967.257,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2086.231,2089.782,I would you appreciate somebody talking about that.
1967.257,0,28683,irwin_a_seibel,,2089.782,2095.594,Let me take the first part and I will leave to Mr. Sisk the balance of your question.
1967.257,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2152.058,2179.653,"And you are not conceding, are you that if the Commission concluded that this was anticompetitive and there were no off setting virtue, you don’t concede that in those circumstances, it would not have power to outlaw the rule under public interest standard of the statute, are you?"
1967.257,0,28683,irwin_a_seibel,,2179.653,2180.009,I am not --
1967.257,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2180.009,2182.018,Have I made myself clear?
1967.257,0,28683,irwin_a_seibel,,2208.081,2209.134,"Yes, sir."
1967.257,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2214.068,2220.11,"Well, we have to look at theory as you know."
1967.257,0,28683,irwin_a_seibel,,2220.11,2223.003,"Yes, Your Honor, this is our position."
1967.257,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2279.336,2280.989,"Well, that’s right, that’s right."
1967.257,0,28683,irwin_a_seibel,,2292.191,2292.845,"That’s right, Your Honor."
1967.257,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2292.845,2297.109,It’s the administrative agency’s function to write findings.
1967.257,0,28683,irwin_a_seibel,,2298.08,2298.286,We think --
1967.257,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2298.286,2317.281,"-- the Court, these two panels made quite a point what they considered to be of a Commission’s failure to make findings which may be nothing more than a failure of craftsmanship but there may be a small desist but favor."
1967.257,0,28683,irwin_a_seibel,,2317.281,2333.084,"Your Honor, I think as Mr. Sisk will point out the Commission did make the findings and I’m sure he will explain that they were supported."
1967.257,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2333.084,2335.273,Mr. Sisk?
1967.257,1,40546,robert_j_sisk,,2335.273,2339.611,"Mr. Chief Justice, May it please the Court."
1967.257,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2716.199,2757.443,"I wish you would take -- as far as it me as I got opinions of Courts here, sir, and they say that there were no findings that could support this regulation or this determination under the Act and I wish you would please tell me what the findings were and then let me know how you feel contrary to the Court of Appeals that they do satisfy the standards of the Act, as to my mind, that’s the issue."
1967.257,1,40546,robert_j_sisk,,2771.009,2783.227,"Well, the Court was wrong, Your Honor, in our view because it was applying a standard of review which this Court has subsequently held to be inconsistent with the Administrative Procedure Act."
1967.257,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2783.227,2788.508,You mean that the Court was wrong in insisting on findings by the administrative agency?
1967.257,1,40546,robert_j_sisk,,2788.508,2793.66,"No, the Court substituted its judgment for that of the agency with respect to the remedy."
1967.257,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3100.649,3107.417,Do you think the burden is on the shipping companies here?
1967.257,1,40546,robert_j_sisk,,3107.417,3112.757,That is our position and that was the position taken by the Commission.
1967.257,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3112.757,3114.683,I see.
1967.257,1,40546,robert_j_sisk,,3114.683,3123.509,"As this Court noted in the Carnation -- Pacific West Bound Conference case, the Congress, which enacted the Shipping Act, was not hostile to antitrust regulation."
1967.257,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3168.574,3176.289,Mr. Neaher?
1967.257,2,22901,edward_r_neaher,,3176.289,3180.116,Mr. Chief Justice and May it please the Court.
1967.257,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3335.679,3338.563,"Well, do you think they have authority to do that?"
1967.257,2,22901,edward_r_neaher,,3338.563,3340.501,Did I think the Court had authority to do that?
1967.257,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3340.501,3341.182,The Court had authority.
1967.257,2,22901,edward_r_neaher,,3341.182,3347.18,I believe it did and I believe this Court very recently in a case exercised that authority itself.
1967.257,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3368.718,3371.121,But you are challenging the findings --
1967.257,2,22901,edward_r_neaher,,3371.121,3372.02,Am I?
1967.257,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3372.02,3382.528,"You’re challenging the court’s findings -- who has the ultimate right to make those findings, the Commission or the reviewing Court?"
1967.257,2,22901,edward_r_neaher,,3382.528,3390.247,I must answer that the Commission alone is charged with the duty of making the factual findings.
1967.257,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3418.79,3421.82,"Well, you don’t say any antitrust principles are relevant."
1967.257,2,22901,edward_r_neaher,,3421.82,3424.059,"I certainly do not, Mr. Justice White."
1967.257,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3426.229,3438.831,"But would you -- do you say that the Commission, as a starting point in this case anyway, in starting to analyze the total public interest, which I suppose it must do."
1967.257,2,22901,edward_r_neaher,,3438.831,3439.091,Right.
1967.257,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3439.091,3440.401,"That’s certainly your position, doesn’t it?"
1967.257,2,22901,edward_r_neaher,,3440.401,3442.063,"Certainly is, yes."
1967.257,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3442.063,3452.762,"Would you say the Commission may not, when it meets face to face with an agreement like this say on the exclusive dealing part of it?"
1967.257,2,22901,edward_r_neaher,,3452.762,3453.541,Yes.
1967.257,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3453.541,3460.866,"And that the Commission may not on its face, say this is anticompetitive?"
1967.257,2,22901,edward_r_neaher,,3460.866,3464.679,It may say it is but I think something more is required.
1967.257,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3464.679,3467.412,"Well, I think we have to stop there for a minute."
1967.257,2,22901,edward_r_neaher,,3471.729,3474.294,That is my position that it may --
1967.257,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3474.294,3479.091,It may not treat this is a per se rule at all?
1967.257,2,22901,edward_r_neaher,,3479.091,3480.772,"That’s right, Your Honor."
1967.257,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3481.649,3495.153,"Because even if it could, I would suppose it must go on and listen to what you have to say anyway about yes, it’s anticompetitive but there are other factors which outway it."
1967.257,2,22901,edward_r_neaher,,3495.153,3496.95,That’s right and I would like to point out --
1967.257,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3496.95,3515.897,"If you could say that they may now even start with the idea that it’s anticompetitive without having somebody get on the stand, as some expert to say, “Well the normal consequence of this is that anticompetitive consequences” or what kind of evidence would you want?"
1967.257,2,22901,edward_r_neaher,,3515.897,3530.998,"I would say there would have to be evidence of the working of the rule in practice, in accordance with the evil label attached to it."
1967.257,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3558.067,3562.093,That’s why that just seems to be irrelevant but I just asked you --
1967.257,2,22901,edward_r_neaher,,3562.093,3565.0,Then I must have misunderstood.
1967.257,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3568.875,3576.769,"I would think that what you just said would say, you would yes that every agreement has got some anticompetitive consequences."
1967.257,2,22901,edward_r_neaher,,3579.122,3582.281,"That every agreement is a matter of competitive consequence, yes."
1967.257,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3582.281,3585.402,And the conference agreement is not a competitive by its very nature?
1967.257,2,22901,edward_r_neaher,,3585.402,3587.181,"Yes, it is."
1967.257,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3587.944,3593.306,You don’t need any evidence to prove it?
1967.257,2,22901,edward_r_neaher,,3593.306,3619.755,"Well, we’re talking about an agreement that’s presented to the Commission for the first time and the Commission has asked to approve the XYZ conference and on the face of the agreement is written, we agree that we won’t do a number of competitive things and the Commission can see right from the face of that agreement that of course, it would be antitrust violation for these lines to agree to that."
1967.257,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3619.755,3622.228,"Well, let’s forget about what is an antitrust violation."
1967.257,2,22901,edward_r_neaher,,3624.397,3628.653,"Well, anticompetitive – that it is an anticompetitive agreement."
1967.257,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3669.168,3672.881,I’m not sure there’s any argument about that with anybody in this case.
1967.257,2,22901,edward_r_neaher,,3672.881,3674.595,Well now I think – but I think the --
1967.257,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3674.595,3695.666,"I would have thought that the Commission isn’t going to -- the Commission, I suppose could say this is an anticompetitive agreement but there’s plenty of reason in the record to have an anticompetitive arrangement and the reasons are these based on some evidence I supposed."
1967.257,2,22901,edward_r_neaher,,3695.666,3696.334,That’s right.
1967.257,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3696.334,3702.367,"And so, they approved the agreement in the exemption on the antitrust laws is achieved."
1967.257,2,22901,edward_r_neaher,,3702.367,3702.899,Right!
1967.257,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3702.899,3722.902,"But the Commission says this is an anticompetitive agreement and nothing that the other side or that the conference has presented justifies that the public interest suffering as anticompetitive impact, I would suppose that under the same Act, they are authorized to disapprove it."
1967.257,2,22901,edward_r_neaher,,3722.902,3723.48,Right!
1967.257,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3723.48,3731.986,"Because the Act says they shall disapprove an agreement, unless it’s shown that the public interest is served by this."
1967.257,2,22901,edward_r_neaher,,3731.986,3736.421,"Well, I have a slight disagreement with you on that, Your Honor, because a public interest --"
1967.257,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3736.421,3738.067,And that is --
1967.257,2,22901,edward_r_neaher,,3738.067,3753.439,"Well, I believe it is in this respect that the public interest, as now inserted in Section 15 of the Shipping Act, and that standard was inserted when Congress passed the dual rate law in 1961."
1967.257,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3867.963,3871.977,Did you request to present more evidence in this second go around --
1967.257,2,22901,edward_r_neaher,,3871.977,3873.022,"No, we did not."
1967.257,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3875.496,3885.626,You assumed that the Commission had the burden of proving that this agreement was contrary to public interest?
1967.257,2,22901,edward_r_neaher,,3885.626,3888.501,"We had that -- no, Your Honor, I can’t say that."
1967.257,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3900.436,3930.027,"But what if the Commission had said to you, “We think this agreement on its face is kind of agreement that normally and almost imperatively produces anticompetitive consequences and that we’re not going to disapprove it if you can explain to us why this is in the public interest or why it does not have burden in the commerce of the United States?"
1967.257,2,22901,edward_r_neaher,,3941.128,3942.904,But the Commission didn’t do that.
1967.257,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3942.904,3943.495,It didn’t?
1967.257,2,22901,edward_r_neaher,,3943.495,3944.636,It did not.
1967.257,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3950.125,3954.792,"Well, you weren’t precluded from putting on in the evidence, were you?"
1967.257,2,22901,edward_r_neaher,,3954.792,3958.017,"Well, the form of the proceeding was simply we would comment."
1967.257,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3959.358,3961.215,You didn’t ask --
1967.257,2,22901,edward_r_neaher,,3961.215,3962.998,"No, we did not ask, Your Honor."
1967.257,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3974.45,3988.114,Did you have the opportunity in the original proceeding to do the things that Mr. Justice White suggested you might have done?
1967.257,2,22901,edward_r_neaher,,3988.114,4012.292,"When you say did we have the opportunity, we certainly tried through conference witnesses and through such documents as Winan to justify, if you can put up that way, our position which was that on all the matters in issue and most of the matters related to the matters which are not in issue here, very little attention was paid to this tying rule."
1967.257,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4034.46,4037.333,What did the Commission find on that disputed question --
1967.257,2,22901,edward_r_neaher,,4037.333,4053.973,"The examiner found that those arguments or the evidence offered in support of their arguments that had blocked the Commission, consideration and the result that in the travel agents not pushing any translation were not supported by substantial evidence and the --"
1967.257,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4053.973,4055.476,What did the Commission find?
1967.257,2,22901,edward_r_neaher,,4055.476,4058.189,And the Commission disagreed with that.
1967.257,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4070.902,4075.211,"Well, are you saying that they failed to establish; it was their burden to establish?"
1967.257,2,22901,edward_r_neaher,,4075.211,4088.888,"It was their burden to establish and I think, yes that when they attacked the rule, which has already been approved that it is their burden to show by evidence that it is doing what they say it is doing."
1967.257,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4102.451,4105.807,"Well, the 40 years of age didn’t have anything to do with it, did it?"
1967.257,2,22901,edward_r_neaher,,4107.731,4115.325,"I don’t question they had the right to change it but I say that surely, it shouldn’t be changed on an arbitrary basis."
1967.257,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4117.591,4124.442,"It gets back to the question, you would say they had the burden of proof and didn’t mean it."
1967.257,2,22901,edward_r_neaher,,4124.442,4128.635,"I’d say that -- here’s what I’m saying, Your Honor, --"
1967.257,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4128.635,4129.993,"Well, I assert you to say that."
1967.257,2,22901,edward_r_neaher,,4129.993,4137.946,"Alright, I’m trying to say this, they had the burden of reaching a decision upon a substantial evidence."
1967.257,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4139.42,4142.835,But what was your burden?
1967.257,2,22901,edward_r_neaher,,4142.835,4144.776,To produce whatever evidence we had?
1967.257,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4144.776,4148.268,To do what?
1967.257,2,22901,edward_r_neaher,,4151.755,4161.084,The burden of proof put on us to show -- you might say to show that the rule wasn’t bad despite it’s per se lingual to show that the rule wasn’t bad.
1967.257,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4161.084,4163.178,"Your claim is you did that, did you not?"
1967.257,2,22901,edward_r_neaher,,4163.178,4165.361,We claim we did whatever we could to demonstrate it.
1967.257,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4165.361,4170.859,"Well, do you claim that you have met the burden of proof so that it was attributed to the trial witness."
1967.257,2,22901,edward_r_neaher,,4170.859,4175.819,We say we did what we were required to do- -
1967.257,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4175.819,4179.563,"I understood you to say you would have thought, you had to carry the burden of proof."
1967.257,2,22901,edward_r_neaher,,4179.563,4180.486,"Yes, but I’m saying --"
1967.257,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4180.486,4182.408,And you claim that you did.
1967.257,2,22901,edward_r_neaher,,4182.408,4182.627,I’m saying --
1967.257,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4182.627,4184.622,"And you found you did not, isn’t it?"
1967.257,2,22901,edward_r_neaher,,4184.622,4186.622,"No, they did not find that, Your Honor."
1967.257,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4191.439,4194.709,"Well, isn’t that the issue?"
1967.257,2,22901,edward_r_neaher,,4194.709,4197.238,But wouldn’t the issue be that --
1967.257,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4197.238,4199.267,But isn’t that the main issue.
1967.257,2,22901,edward_r_neaher,,4210.29,4220.294,"Well, I think that perhaps I’m getting put into a position here that is not my position."
1967.257,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4240.699,4245.41,"But if is your burden to prove the other thing, couldn’t you?"
1967.257,2,22901,edward_r_neaher,,4245.41,4253.352,"Well, we don’t believe it is our burden to establish the substantial evidence by which the Commission had to condemn and/or prove the rule."
1967.257,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4253.352,4256.214,You mean you don’t believe it’s your burden to justify that –
1967.257,2,22901,edward_r_neaher,,4256.214,4256.832,That’s right.
1967.257,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4293.174,4295.56,And it was your burden to show that?
1967.257,2,22901,edward_r_neaher,,4295.56,4298.223,It has nothing to do with burden.
1967.257,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4298.223,4299.988,But whose burden do you think it was?
1967.257,2,22901,edward_r_neaher,,4299.988,4315.116,"I think it was the Commission’s burden to see to it that there was substantial evidence to support its order and that if it’s order is not substantially supported, it must be set aside."
1967.257,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4328.494,4347.448,"Let’s assume there’s only one thing that is put in this record that the Commission says that here is a agreement which amounts to boycott and these kinds of agreements are normally anticompetitive, very anticompetitive and they ask you, “Would you please justify this because we’d like to approve it."
1967.257,2,22901,edward_r_neaher,,4385.696,4388.028,I think so based on the legislative history.
1967.257,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4388.028,4391.125,"You would lose in that case, would you lose here?"
1967.257,2,22901,edward_r_neaher,,4391.125,4393.892,"If we lost in that case, we would be lose here."
1967.257,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4403.994,4404.286,"Yes, thank you."
1967.257,2,22901,edward_r_neaher,,4404.286,4405.311,I’m sorry.
1967.257,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4608.319,4627.915,"But suppose the carriers -- follow my Brother White’s questioning, suppose the carriers got together and they adopted the rule to the effect that none of the carriers will transport steel unless it was made by United States Steel, a single carrier."
1967.257,2,22901,edward_r_neaher,,4627.915,4632.886,I should think that would be -- are you saying the terms of the agreement or that the agreement that --
1967.257,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4632.886,4670.767,"Suppose you adopted such a rule and then the Commission started a proceeding, the Commission challenged that rule, and started a proceeding in which a staff challenged that rule on the grounds that, it was contrary to the public interest, is it your position that they would have to come forward with proof that that is contrary to the public interest or with the burden of going forward and the burden of proof as a substantive matter in those circumstances be on the carriers?"
1967.257,2,22901,edward_r_neaher,,4670.767,4689.408,"I think that if the agreement stopped with that, that they would only carry the steel of United States Steel, that would run squarely a foul of that Section which says you can’t approve an agreement which is unjustly discriminatory to import as or export as in that sort of thing."
1967.257,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4690.883,4726.399,"Well, alright but similarly, if change of facts and the carriers come forward with some other rule that on conventional theories of competition, it appears to be anticompetitive and perhaps therefore in the lexicon or folklore anyway, perhaps of our jurisprudence and therefore contrary to public interest."
1967.257,2,22901,edward_r_neaher,,4730.996,4751.03,"Well, the only answer I can again is this; I think that Congress has said, “If the Commission finds that an agreement operates contrary to one or more of the statutory standards, then it shall disapprove the agreement."
1967.257,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4764.485,4772.698,"No, but quite your substantial evidence turns and pried upon who has a burden of going forward."
1967.257,2,22901,edward_r_neaher,,4787.542,4788.856,Well --
1967.257,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4788.856,4806.235,"You start off with the rule and then as evidence is submitted at each point as evidence is submitted, the question of burden is relevant and may be critical on the question of substantial -- on the issue of substantial evidence."
1967.257,2,22901,edward_r_neaher,,4806.235,4832.279,I think I have to respectfully differ with that because I believe that what Your Honor is saying here is that ordinary rules of burden of proof as applicable in a court of law and adversary proceedings shall apply to the Commission’s determinations when it is exercising the responsibility placed on it by the Shipping Act.
1967.257,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4936.765,4951.484,Is there any in the industry in this nation that has such a franchise?
1967.257,2,22901,edward_r_neaher,,4951.484,4969.358,"I think, I’ll have to say I know of no other but I know of no other industry that doesn’t also happen to be fully within the control of a United States regulatory agency."
1967.257,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5080.923,5117.282,"When you get around the reading this Court’s central opinion, I think you’ll find some statements on that subject that is to say that -- to the effect that where there is an exemption from the antitrust, from our usual antitrust philosophy that there is a necessity of looking at the practice and why it is accepted that in that context in any event, private agreements are not to be accepted without any inquiry."
1967.257,2,22901,edward_r_neaher,,5117.282,5119.935,I am well aware of that ordinary rule.
1967.257,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5128.195,5132.157,Railroads aren’t subject to the ordinary antitrust rules --
1967.257,2,22901,edward_r_neaher,,5132.157,5135.282,"But it’s a domestic operation, Your Honor."
1967.257,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5166.934,5167.809,What case is that?
1967.257,2,22901,edward_r_neaher,,5167.809,5169.315,The Denvery O’Grand case.
1967.257,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5170.547,5174.991,I don’t think that case said that they are entitled to disregard the anticompetitive --
1967.257,2,22901,edward_r_neaher,,5174.991,5177.707,I didn’t mean it in that (Voice overlap)
1967.257,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5177.707,5178.35,They are entitled to override them.
1967.257,2,22901,edward_r_neaher,,5178.35,5180.006,Override them --
1967.257,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5180.006,5181.472,Or based on some evidence?
1967.257,2,22901,edward_r_neaher,,5181.472,5182.525,Based on some evidence.
1967.257,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5182.525,5183.355,And some reason?
1967.257,2,22901,edward_r_neaher,,5183.355,5185.014,"Right, and I am saying --"
1967.257,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5185.014,5186.333,And that of some reasons (Voice Overlap)
1967.257,2,22901,edward_r_neaher,,5186.333,5187.423,That is right.
1967.257,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5217.674,5245.702,"Well, I think it comes down to -- there is substantial evidence to support this agreement where the only evidence there is in the case, let’s just assume the case that is an agreement which normally on its face is quite anticompetitive and there is no other evidence, no other reasons given as to why the public interest should suffer these anticompetitive consequences."
1967.257,2,22901,edward_r_neaher,,5276.733,5277.78,May I -- right.
1967.257,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5302.562,5302.868,Very well.
1967.257,2,22901,edward_r_neaher,,5302.868,5325.063,"Two-fold standpoint, The tying ruleis a rule where by certain selected agents, travel agents, traditionally serving the steamship trade, have been appointed by the lines as their agents sort of exclusive dealing arrangement."
1967.257,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5383.166,5388.746,And the Commission agreed with Aster.
1967.257,2,22901,edward_r_neaher,,5388.746,5389.3,"No, no (Voice overlap)"
1967.257,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5389.3,5396.671,They exercised their judgment and said that there are no reasons which really justify this.
1967.257,2,22901,edward_r_neaher,,5396.671,5399.579,The Commission didn’t agree with Aster to this extent.
1967.257,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5447.137,5461.681,But you do disagree whether the estimation did conclude that there were no factors in this record which indicated that public interest requires the approval of this agreement.
1967.257,2,22901,edward_r_neaher,,5461.681,5464.309,"Well, I’m saying -- I was about to give you some reasons."
1967.257,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5464.309,5470.296,"I know but I’m just saying that you gave the reasons to the Commission, as I take it, but the Commission disagreed with you."
1967.257,2,22901,edward_r_neaher,,5470.296,5470.75,Right.
1967.257,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5471.637,5473.84,And you want us to disagree with the Commission (Voice overlap)
1967.257,2,22901,edward_r_neaher,,5473.84,5477.345,I don’t want you to disagree with the Commission at all.
1967.257,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5484.052,5487.778,You want us to approve the Courts below disagreeing with the Commission?
1967.257,2,22901,edward_r_neaher,,5487.778,5491.244,"That is right, on the basis of no substantial evidence."
1967.257,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5657.06,5664.949,Are you saying that without these travel agent rules these conferences would go out of existence?
1967.257,2,22901,edward_r_neaher,,5664.949,5666.637,I’m not saying they would.
1967.257,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5673.616,5678.176,You mean the travel agent rule is unimportant to the conference?
1967.257,2,22901,edward_r_neaher,,5678.176,5679.804,We maintain it is.
1967.257,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5703.198,5703.79,You mean whatever --
1967.257,2,22901,edward_r_neaher,,5703.79,5708.467,-- based on their trade that’s why they aren’t.
1967.257,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5708.467,5712.232,But if it’s a violation of law I suppose you would agree it’s a violation of --
1967.257,2,22901,edward_r_neaher,,5712.232,5716.776,If it’s a violation of law -- let me put it this way.
1967.257,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5720.741,5724.082,"If it’s a violation of Shipping Act, it’s a violation of the shipping trade?"
1967.257,2,22901,edward_r_neaher,,5724.082,5731.643,"Right, and even if it shown to be such by substantial evidence, our goose is cooked."
1967.257,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5740.321,5742.956,"Then the conference will go out of existence, are you making that representation?"
1967.257,2,22901,edward_r_neaher,,5742.956,5747.333,I’m not prepared to say that conference -- I’m not prepared to represent that to the Court.
1967.257,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5750.48,5753.716,And then the Conference also regulates rates?
1967.257,2,22901,edward_r_neaher,,5753.716,5755.572,The conference also regulates rates.
1967.257,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5755.572,5769.968,"What you’re saying to us is that if we don’t, that if we don’t validate the order of the Court below despite the other powers and functions of the conference, the conference will go out of existence?"
1967.257,2,22901,edward_r_neaher,,5769.968,5785.359,"I’m only telling, Your Honor, that the Alexander Report, which we cite in our brief, pointed out that the control of agency forces was a principal object of a passenger conference."
1967.257,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5794.798,5797.641,But that didn’t include of a passenger conference.
1967.257,2,22901,edward_r_neaher,,5797.641,5799.853,Uniformity of passenger fares is --
1967.257,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5799.853,5801.816,"Well, that’s control --"
1967.257,2,22901,edward_r_neaher,,5801.816,5802.719,"Well, it is in a way --"
1967.257,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5802.719,5803.42,-- passenger fares.
1967.257,2,22901,edward_r_neaher,,5803.42,5804.159,It is in a way.
1967.257,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5942.358,5947.866,"Yup, I understand that your argument as a general proposition."
1967.257,2,22901,edward_r_neaher,,5975.44,5978.092,My answer to that is two-fold.
1967.257,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6055.193,6055.966,I’m asking for information.
1967.257,2,22901,edward_r_neaher,,6055.966,6056.444,Yes.
1967.257,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6056.444,6067.656,"Out of these 25 members, are there any that have very little connection at all with either the Canada or the United States?"
1967.257,2,22901,edward_r_neaher,,6067.656,6078.422,"I think there are three lines, there were three lines at that time that had -- that did not call at U.S. ports --"
1967.257,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6078.422,6079.716,Or Canadian ports?
1967.257,2,22901,edward_r_neaher,,6079.716,6080.567,Or they call it Canadian ports.
1967.257,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6080.567,6081.322,"Well, no.(Voice overlap)"
1967.257,2,22901,edward_r_neaher,,6081.322,6082.698,"Oh, I’m sorry, I misunderstood."
1967.257,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6093.221,6094.17,And regularly call?
1967.257,2,22901,edward_r_neaher,,6094.17,6095.952,"And regularly, that’s right."
1967.257,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6180.287,6192.987,The ultimate sanction that the Maritime Commission or indeed our Courts have over these foreign trade lines?
1967.257,2,22901,edward_r_neaher,,6192.987,6205.078,"The ultimate sanction, I would say, is the adoption of regulations that the foreign lines are voluntarily willing to accept."
1967.257,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,6274.502,6302.431,"No, but if you look at this in terms of conventional, anti-trust law or conventional law with reference to statutory scheme, and look at it as, from my point of view, cartel law and certainly, the United States has jurisdiction to fly it’s laws, a) to its own citizens; b) to foreign persons doing business here."
1967.257,2,22901,edward_r_neaher,,6302.431,6302.789,Right.
1967.257,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,6302.789,6343.246,"It’s power would extend to exercising that jurisdiction over cartel aspects of it and you are not arguing, are you, that because of the foreign participation in this conference, the United States does not have jurisdiction to regulate or to abolish a cartel agreement with respect to the fees to be paid, restricting fees to be paid to travel agents here."
1967.257,2,22901,edward_r_neaher,,6343.246,6359.929,All I’m saying here is that Congress has made clear that our traditional antitrust concepts cannot be fully applied to this area of commerce.
1967.257,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,6372.878,6373.762,I agree.
1967.257,2,22901,edward_r_neaher,,6391.584,6392.72,This agreement is --

1967.257,2,22901,edward_r_neaher,,6418.057,6419.747,That’s what Congress was pointing out.

1967.257,2,22901,edward_r_neaher,,6462.495,6476.146,"Well, cartel as I know of that often evokes impressions of something evil and to be -- shall we say driven out of existence."
1967.257,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,6550.897,6562.482,"I follow your argument on this, I don’t follow your argument that seems to indicate some special immunity here but I misunderstood you."

1967.257,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,6562.908,6571.253,Other than what is specified in the statute with respect to this domestic U.S.A. activity.
1967.257,2,22901,edward_r_neaher,,6571.253,6593.14,"I really regret that there seems to be this misunderstanding because certainly it is not my intention to advance theories or positions here which in anyway militate against the power of an agency of this government to do what it is called upon to do to protect our citizens, our commercial interest."
1967.257,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6656.434,6659.705,May I ask you.
1967.257,2,22901,edward_r_neaher,,6669.391,6671.854,I would have to say it would.
1967.257,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6687.264,6696.427,That’s -- I want to ask you that question because I have understood by your argument that -- what has to be proved?
1967.257,2,22901,edward_r_neaher,,6716.186,6738.546,"Because I think that applying that notion of requiring someone who claims an exemption from antitrust laws to come forward and show he is entitled to it, is not the way Congress has said the Shipping Act shall be administered."
1967.257,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6752.569,6761.634,But it wouldn’t have decided to put on efforts itself -- that’s what bothers me and it seems to me like you stand up with (Voice overlap).

1967.257,2,22901,edward_r_neaher,,6766.858,6772.837,I can only say that substantial evidence must be the basis for its action.
