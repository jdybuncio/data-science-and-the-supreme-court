1999.99-536,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,11.189,"We'll hear argument next in No. 99-536, Roger Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Products, Inc.--"
1999.99-536,0,33604,jim_waide,,20.663,26.88,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1999.99-536,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,96.124,96.615,Excuse me.
1999.99-536,0,33604,jim_waide,,97.396,97.675,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1999.99-536,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,97.675,98.346,--Why is that?
1999.99-536,0,33604,jim_waide,,98.346,99.447,"I'm sorry, Your Honor?"
1999.99-536,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,99.447,100.767,Why is that?
1999.99-536,0,33604,jim_waide,,100.767,101.978,"Why is this rational, Your Honor?"
1999.99-536,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,101.978,111.816,"Why, when you eliminate all... all rational reasons, the only other irrational reason is discrimination?"
1999.99-536,0,33604,jim_waide,,118.989,119.32,Yes.
1999.99-536,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,128.936,131.509,We normally... we normally don't let a jury flip a coin.
1999.99-536,0,33604,jim_waide,,136.504,136.905,"--Yes, sir."
1999.99-536,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,166.043,169.977,"Well, Mr. Waide, you presented three rather specific questions."
1999.99-536,0,33604,jim_waide,,212.315,217.0,"Your Honor, this first one addresses the first issue; that is, what evidence is necessary to take the case to the jury."
1999.99-536,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,219.151,223.294,"--Yes, but don't blend them too much because some of us may think they're separate."
1999.99-536,0,33604,jim_waide,,223.294,224.484,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1999.99-536,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,224.484,227.896,"If you prevail on the first one, do you need to go any further?"
1999.99-536,0,33604,jim_waide,,227.896,238.864,"Your Honor, we think it's very important that we do because this... this test that the Fifth Circuit has of all evidence... what it's resulted in is the... is the judge is accepting as true the evidence that the jury didn't believe."
1999.99-536,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,238.864,242.698,But it has to be in the light most favorable to the non movant.
1999.99-536,0,33604,jim_waide,,242.698,254.566,"It's supposed to be, Your Honor, but in practical effect, when they start considering all the evidence, when they say, for example, in this case we say that Mr. Chestnut... this is a fellow that wrote his supposed boss, the one they claimed was his boss, and said, wake up and learn to do your job."
1999.99-536,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,263.763,287.157,"Well, then, maybe they applied that standard incorrectly, but if the standard... does it make a whole lot of difference whether it's all the evidence, just the petitioner's evidence, just the plaintiff's evidence, so long as you must draw every inference, you must read every piece of testimony in the light most favorable to the non movant?"
1999.99-536,0,33604,jim_waide,,287.157,295.994,"Your Honor... Your Honor, I do... respectfully, I do believe that it makes a difference because whenever you say all the evidence, that leaves you open to take evidence the jury didn't believe."
1999.99-536,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,330.886,334.68,"So, it does go beyond just the plaintiff's evidence?"
1999.99-536,0,33604,jim_waide,,334.68,334.72,"Yes, ma'am."
1999.99-536,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,379.139,389.247,What about... what... what's your position on evidence produced by the moving party that is not impeached or contested?
1999.99-536,0,33604,jim_waide,,389.247,392.4,"--I think Your Honor has already settled that, that would have to be accepted, Your Honor."
1999.99-536,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,394.95,395.21,What about--
1999.99-536,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,395.21,399.254,"--Well, how did... when did we settle it and how?"
1999.99-536,0,33604,jim_waide,,399.254,408.321,"Your Honor, you settled it in this Lesage summary judgment case, which I think the standards are the same, and in the Lesage summary judgment case, there was evidence that this applicant... he was saying it was race discrimination."
1999.99-536,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,414.094,414.314,So--
1999.99-536,0,33604,jim_waide,,414.314,415.226,--conclusive evidence--
1999.99-536,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,415.226,422.52,"--So then, you would agree that the summary judgment standard is the same as the rule 50 standard?"
1999.99-536,0,33604,jim_waide,,422.52,423.502,"--With only one exception, Your Honor."
1999.99-536,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,449.878,462.167,"I think you're wrong there, if I may say so, that the... the trial... at this stage, when you're talking about judgment as a matter of law, you're not supposed to be evaluating the truthfulness or the veracity of the witnesses."
1999.99-536,0,33604,jim_waide,,462.167,464.448,"You're not supposed to, but... Your Honor, but in fact they are."
1999.99-536,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,467.072,467.811,"Well, shame on them."
1999.99-536,0,33604,jim_waide,,476.868,481.801,"--Well, Your Honor, it... it's called a matter of law, but in fact it's an evaluation of evidence."
1999.99-536,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,488.286,499.563,"I think you're confusing a motion for a new trial where we do... where the appellate court is supposed to give some deference to the district court, where the judgment as a matter of law which, as you say, is de novo."
1999.99-536,0,33604,jim_waide,,499.563,499.843,Yes.
1999.99-536,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,519.327,540.201,"Mr. Waide, is it... is it your position that a plaintiff is always entitled to get to the jury in a case like this if he establishes that the employer's stated, articulated reason for the employment action is false?"
1999.99-536,0,33604,jim_waide,,540.201,546.425,"Your Honor, I hate to say, as Justice Scalia said in a Law Review article I just wrote, I hate to say never."
1999.99-536,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,552.169,558.233,"There might be a third unarticulated, valid reason for the action conceivably."
1999.99-536,0,33604,jim_waide,,558.233,567.119,"Your Honor, all I can say is if we have a situation like we have in this case, where we've disproved... we've... we've done all we... I mean, Justice Scalia says, well, maybe they just didn't like him."
1999.99-536,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,624.818,639.377,"When you say lying, I mean, you know, all it requires is that the jury think it more likely than not that the employer's explanation was not... was not the true one."
1999.99-536,0,33604,jim_waide,,664.652,664.662,"--No, Your Honor."
1999.99-536,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,702.529,703.057,--But you're saying--
1999.99-536,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,703.057,711.164,"--Well, you... you... I take it your answer is that in this case you introduced more than simply the prima facie case--"
1999.99-536,0,33604,jim_waide,,711.164,711.394,--We--
1999.99-536,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,711.394,720.171,--and you introduced more than simply showing that the pretext... or that the employer's alleged reason was false.
1999.99-536,0,33604,jim_waide,,721.209,722.031,"--We did, Your Honor."
1999.99-536,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,722.031,734.919,"--But our question is, as a matter of law, may you go to the case if you have just a prima facie case and a showing that the employer's asserted reason is not true?"
1999.99-536,0,33604,jim_waide,,734.919,739.493,"Yes, sir, so long as it's a showing not... that it's... that it's... that has mendacity."
1999.99-536,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,747.519,748.75,"So, then it depends... it depends on the... on the strength of--"
1999.99-536,0,33604,jim_waide,,748.75,749.561,"No, sir."
1999.99-536,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,749.561,751.134,--your reputation of the employer's asserted reasons?
1999.99-536,0,33604,jim_waide,,751.134,754.095,"As long as a plaintiff introduces evidence of it, Your Honor."
1999.99-536,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,760.55,764.072,"Mr. Waide, may I clarify one thing because Justice Scalia asked a question?"
1999.99-536,0,33604,jim_waide,,764.072,764.393,"Yes, ma'am."
1999.99-536,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,764.393,773.607,"Are you claiming that if you have the prima facie case and you have discredited the employer's proffered reason, that you win?"
1999.99-536,0,33604,jim_waide,,779.671,780.141,"Yes, ma'am."
1999.99-536,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,780.141,780.492,--with that.
1999.99-536,0,33604,jim_waide,,781.733,781.904,"Sure, we may lose."
1999.99-536,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,781.904,782.875,The jury could go either way.
1999.99-536,0,33604,jim_waide,,782.875,790.479,"Your Honor... Your Honor, when Justice Scalia wrote the opinion in just... everybody thought... they told the plaintiffs' lawyers, well, that's a very bad opinion for you all, isn't it?"
1999.99-536,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,840.19,840.481,"Very well, Mr. Waide."
1999.99-536,0,33604,jim_waide,,841.632,842.862,"Yes, Your Honor."
1999.99-536,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,842.862,844.975,--Ms. Millett.
1999.99-536,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,844.975,856.913,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1999.99-536,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,873.133,877.597,"Well, that isn't exactly how the question was phrased, unfortunately."
1999.99-536,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,903.696,904.477,--Yes.
1999.99-536,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,904.477,905.418,Bare bones.
1999.99-536,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,926.683,926.994,Yes.
1999.99-536,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,970.942,977.376,"Well, now you... you say false, but isn't what you mean a sufficient basis for the jury to determine falsity?"
1999.99-536,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,977.376,978.067,--That--
1999.99-536,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,978.067,980.038,Or it must be demonstrably false?
1999.99-536,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,980.038,980.599,--I'm sorry.
1999.99-536,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,987.013,990.296,You mean the jury can... did not conclude that it was true.
1999.99-536,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1001.075,1005.216,"--Absolutely not, but you... in employment... I'm sorry."
1999.99-536,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1005.216,1012.101,Or even that the... that the jury has found it more likely than not that this is not the real excuse.
1999.99-536,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1019.546,1027.912,"Well, it seems to me that in finding it more likely than not it was age, they have also found it... unless you're talking about mixed motives."
1999.99-536,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1031.022,1031.664,"Oh, okay."
1999.99-536,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1031.664,1032.614,But if the other explanation is--
1999.99-536,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1032.614,1033.114,That's... that's fair.
1999.99-536,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1033.114,1036.207,"--is the... is the correct one, outside the mixed motives--"
1999.99-536,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1036.207,1055.492,"So, then under your view only if in the case where the employer comes up with a purportedly nondiscriminatory reason for the discharge, only if that is unchallenged by the plaintiff does the defendant get judgment as a matter of law."
1999.99-536,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1055.492,1056.884,--Yes.
1999.99-536,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1070.42,1074.053,"And they could challenge it just by cross examination I suppose, could they not?"
1999.99-536,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1074.053,1080.948,"That's exactly what this Court said in Burdine, that a prima facie case, accompanied by cross examination, may be sufficient to establish pretext for discrimination."
1999.99-536,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1080.948,1099.18,"You know, it... it makes it sound all plausible and quite reasonable when you use... use the expression, a prima facie case, which in the law generally means, you know, enough evidence to... to make it more likely than not, without any other evidence, that a certain thing is true."
1999.99-536,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1119.994,1121.935,What... first of all--
1999.99-536,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1121.935,1124.278,"I mean, you could call it a prima facie case, but in the... is it really?"
1999.99-536,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1124.278,1146.892,"--The prima facie case also includes the requirement that the plaintiff show that the most likely explanations for the employment action have been eliminated, and I think as Justice O'Connor said in Price Waterhouse, there's... at that point you have made a... almost a statistical showing, assuming silence by the employer, that the more likely explanation is discrimination."
1999.99-536,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1148.164,1148.574,Excuse me.
1999.99-536,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1158.99,1159.812,--Ultimately at the end.
1999.99-536,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1163.014,1165.214,May I just make a suggestion here?
1999.99-536,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1178.775,1179.717,--There... there are two things.
1999.99-536,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1187.734,1192.739,--But qualified doesn't necessarily require him to come in and show that he was doing a good job.
1999.99-536,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1195.23,1195.41,Yes.
1999.99-536,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1260.552,1260.973,Ms. Millett--
1999.99-536,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1260.973,1266.79,"--Well, if we decide... if we decide the case on the basis that you're talking about, we really didn't need to grant certiorari."
1999.99-536,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1280.457,1296.759,"No. I think the... I think I... I think I mean to be talking about the first question and that is in which there is a conflict in the circuits, and that is whether what is called the prima facie case... the proof underlying the prima facie case, combined with the proof demonstrating the falsity of the employer's explanations--"
1999.99-536,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1296.759,1297.39,Is enough.
1999.99-536,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1297.39,1304.442,--those two alone are sufficient to create a reasonable inference... to permit a reasonable inference by a jury.
1999.99-536,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1305.694,1315.771,"And isn't the difference that the prima facie case... if the employer puts in no defense at all, then it is judgment as a matter of law for the plaintiff."
1999.99-536,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1344.78,1346.52,--That's... that's absolutely right.
1999.99-536,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1349.051,1355.175,"But if you take that rule, together with the rule that the jury is always free to disbelieve a witness, then you can go to the jury every time."
1999.99-536,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1355.175,1370.616,"--That's not true because this Court has said in Crawfordell and Bose Corporation v. Consumers Union and Anderson v. Liberty Lobby a plaintiff cannot just sit back and, at summary judgment or judgment for matter of law stage, and say, I've done nothing, but the jury could disbelieve the defendant's witnesses."
1999.99-536,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1374.519,1378.87,I'm not sure we said it can get to the jury no matter what other evidence there is.
1999.99-536,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1395.883,1396.842,--That--
1999.99-536,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1396.842,1404.839,"And... and then you mean to say that despite that uncontroverted evidence, all we look to is simply the prima facie case."
1999.99-536,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1422.313,1429.038,--That significant uncontroverted evidence is an excellent argument to make to the jury and it may be the inference that the jury draws.
1999.99-536,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1435.844,1445.099,And the jury... the jury is free to disbelieve even uncontroverted... a witness whose testimony is not controverted just because they think he might be telling... telling a lie I think.
1999.99-536,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1445.099,1445.53,--They are certainly free to do that.
1999.99-536,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1456.618,1457.478,"Thank you, Ms. Millett."
1999.99-536,2,43363,taylor_b_smith,,1459.231,1465.325,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1999.99-536,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1544.917,1548.109,You're going to deal with each of the three questions--
1999.99-536,2,43363,taylor_b_smith,,1548.109,1548.379,--Yes.
1999.99-536,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1548.379,1549.441,--presented in your oral argument?
1999.99-536,2,43363,taylor_b_smith,,1549.441,1549.711,"Yes, Your Honor."
1999.99-536,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1653.559,1657.934,"That was... those were bench... Anderson v. Bessemer City was a bench trial, was it not?"
1999.99-536,2,43363,taylor_b_smith,,1657.934,1659.215,"--It was, Your Honor."
1999.99-536,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1699.741,1702.863,"Well, but that's the clearly erroneous rule."
1999.99-536,2,43363,taylor_b_smith,,1704.926,1706.566,"Well, I think it does, Your Honor."
1999.99-536,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1726.648,1726.979,"Yes, but... okay."
1999.99-536,2,43363,taylor_b_smith,,1740.551,1759.312,"I think, Your Honor, that the... the rule meshes with respect to the function of an appellate court in determining under the substantive law is there sufficient evidence that would warrant a fair jury in reaching a result in favor of a party having the burden."
1999.99-536,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1759.653,1776.676,"Mr. Smith, would you agree that what the judge is supposed to ask on a motion for judgment as a matter of law is, I have to look at this evidence and I must draw every inference possible in favor of the non movant?"
1999.99-536,2,43363,taylor_b_smith,,1783.689,1798.909,"--Justice Ginsburg, I would agree with that with one caveat, and that is when we've used the word inference, the inference must be based on the evidence not on speculation and surmise and not a inference upon an inference."
1999.99-536,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1798.909,1801.821,Drawing every inference from the evidence.
1999.99-536,2,43363,taylor_b_smith,,1820.186,1830.342,"Yes, Your Honor, if it's a he said/she said, and the reviewing court cannot determine which one is telling the truth or which one is to be determined, the fact finder must do that."
1999.99-536,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1830.342,1834.897,It's just... just he said and... and she doesn't... doesn't deny it.
1999.99-536,2,43363,taylor_b_smith,,1849.965,1850.206,No.
1999.99-536,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1874.541,1884.068,--And that's built into the test that Professor Wright... that... that your friend quoted... Justice... Professor Wright.
1999.99-536,2,43363,taylor_b_smith,,1884.068,1884.539,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1999.99-536,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1884.539,1887.849,And did you have any quarrel with that articulation of the test?
1999.99-536,2,43363,taylor_b_smith,,1887.849,1888.089,No.
1999.99-536,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1888.54,1889.982,"So, then you're both... you're in agreement."
1999.99-536,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1895.147,1896.178,You agree with her.
1999.99-536,2,43363,taylor_b_smith,,1901.661,1902.092,Exactly.
1999.99-536,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1902.092,1902.563,All right.
1999.99-536,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1903.665,1909.849,"--So, then we can take what it says in Wright and Miller and that's it, and pass on to other questions in the case."
1999.99-536,2,43363,taylor_b_smith,,1909.849,1910.049,All right.
1999.99-536,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2020.869,2029.354,"But then doesn't Hicks also say... and indeed, doesn't the Fifth Circuit say in other cases... that ordinarily what you have is the prima facie case?"
1999.99-536,2,43363,taylor_b_smith,,2109.47,2116.735,"Justice Breyer, I think first we must visit the decision of the Fifth Circuit."
1999.99-536,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2246.558,2249.311,If I could... if I could bring you back just one second for my... the precise--
1999.99-536,2,43363,taylor_b_smith,,2249.311,2249.832,--Yes.
1999.99-536,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2249.832,2251.234,--response I was looking for.
1999.99-536,2,43363,taylor_b_smith,,2309.184,2323.332,"Justice Breyer, the... the statement by the Fifth Circuit found that there may be pretext for disbelief of certain things that the Fifth Circuit pointed out that Reeves contended."
1999.99-536,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2521.193,2526.136,"Well, but isn't there a conflict in the evidence about whether this man really did make the decision?"
1999.99-536,2,43363,taylor_b_smith,,2527.908,2532.992,"Your Honor, I think not, and let me point out why, if I may, Justice Stevens."
1999.99-536,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2532.992,2535.516,Is he... am I correct that he was married to the person who owned the company?
1999.99-536,2,43363,taylor_b_smith,,2535.516,2540.899,"He... he... at the time of the termination, Mr. Chestnut was married to the president of the company."
1999.99-536,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2540.899,2541.169,Right.
1999.99-536,2,43363,taylor_b_smith,,2541.169,2544.101,"At the time of the termination, he was director of manufacturing."
1999.99-536,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2559.682,2561.084,"Mr. Smith, it was not just Mr. Reeves."
1999.99-536,2,43363,taylor_b_smith,,2573.293,2574.523,"--Yes, Justice Ginsburg."
1999.99-536,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2637.066,2642.369,You didn't put on that defense that Sanderson disliked... you didn't make that--
1999.99-536,2,43363,taylor_b_smith,,2642.369,2642.62,--No.
1999.99-536,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2672.86,2678.506,"--But you could argue... you could argue that to the jury, but Mr. Oswalt said here I was doing the same thing with the records."
1999.99-536,2,43363,taylor_b_smith,,2709.344,2717.46,"Justice Ginsburg, with all deference, I think that's a perfect example of when the jury could not because what evidence did they have?"
1999.99-536,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2723.844,2732.092,"Yes, but how can you say totally disconnected if the man who made the decision to fire him 2 months ahead of that time said, you came over on the Mayflower and you're too old for the work?"
1999.99-536,2,43363,taylor_b_smith,,2739.205,2744.657,"--Under the decisions of this Court, as well as every circuit, no, you could not."
1999.99-536,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2755.346,2757.677,"So, it literally should have been excluded from evidence."
1999.99-536,2,43363,taylor_b_smith,,2760.368,2761.82,And that effort was made at the lower court.
1999.99-536,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2763.302,2764.954,You say the jury can do nothing with it.
1999.99-536,2,43363,taylor_b_smith,,2766.454,2771.469,"--Well, it... it... Justice Souter first and then Justice Ginsburg."
1999.99-536,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2791.772,2794.076,But the... it's competent.
1999.99-536,2,43363,taylor_b_smith,,2844.388,2845.227,"Yes, Your Honor."
1999.99-536,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2903.197,2905.318,"Well, if you're right, then there was no pretext."
1999.99-536,2,43363,taylor_b_smith,,2905.318,2907.13,"There was... pardon, Your Honor?"
1999.99-536,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2907.13,2908.098,Then it wasn't a pretext.
1999.99-536,2,43363,taylor_b_smith,,2910.179,2912.282,"That's correct, Justice Breyer."
1999.99-536,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2912.282,2913.922,"But, of course, the... the Fifth Circuit said the opposite."
1999.99-536,2,43363,taylor_b_smith,,2914.793,2924.811,"The Fifth Circuit, in finding that Reeves may well be right on three points, I... I repeat--"
1999.99-536,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2924.811,2925.301,It didn't say that.
1999.99-536,2,43363,taylor_b_smith,,2933.727,2934.147,--Yes--
1999.99-536,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2934.147,2938.4,"And then it said... that's what's claimed, and it said Reeves may very well be correct."
1999.99-536,2,43363,taylor_b_smith,,2938.4,2940.371,"--Yes, Justice Breyer, you're exactly right."
1999.99-536,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3036.164,3038.717,"Mr.... Mr. Smith, you're arguing evidence."
1999.99-536,2,43363,taylor_b_smith,,3079.073,3085.869,"Justice Ginsburg, the... the points you've mentioned were repudiated by uncontradicted testimony."
1999.99-536,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3093.733,3094.294,Let's take my first point.
1999.99-536,2,43363,taylor_b_smith,,3107.377,3117.782,"--Mr. Reeves went to the hospital later in that day, but he was present when... when the attendance records were made by the supervisor, Mr. Reeves, that day on her."
1999.99-536,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3118.943,3121.305,Is that established in... I thought that Mr.--
1999.99-536,2,43363,taylor_b_smith,,3121.305,3121.495,--Yes.
1999.99-536,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3122.606,3123.478,--Mr. Reeves was contending he was--
1999.99-536,2,43363,taylor_b_smith,,3123.478,3123.698,I'm sorry.
1999.99-536,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3123.698,3128.733,"--he was not the one, that he was not the one who did that, that Caldwell in fact did that."
1999.99-536,2,43363,taylor_b_smith,,3128.733,3129.484,No.
1999.99-536,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3148.064,3151.997,"So, you're saying there was nothing in the evidence that it was Caldwell who did it and not Reeves."
1999.99-536,2,43363,taylor_b_smith,,3151.997,3152.538,"--No, Your Honor."
1999.99-536,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3262.361,3262.681,"Thank you, Mr. Smith."
1999.99-536,2,43363,taylor_b_smith,,3262.681,3263.499,Thank you--
1999.99-536,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3263.499,3266.012,"Mr. Waide, you have 6 minutes remaining."
1999.99-536,3,33604,jim_waide,,3266.012,3267.172,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1999.99-536,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3474.59,3486.679,"The jury... the jury charge here says that the plaintiff can prove pretext by showing, one, that the stated reasons were not the real reasons for the discharge and, two, that age discrimination was the real reason."
1999.99-536,3,33604,jim_waide,,3486.679,3487.22,"--Yes, sir."
1999.99-536,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3487.22,3487.68,You didn't... you didn't--
1999.99-536,3,33604,jim_waide,,3487.68,3489.82,"I agree with that a hundred... I mean, I know it's the law--"
1999.99-536,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3489.82,3491.132,--Must you have number two as well?
1999.99-536,3,33604,jim_waide,,3491.132,3492.434,"--I'm sorry, Your Honor?"
1999.99-536,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3492.434,3495.827,Why isn't number one sufficient under your view of the case?
1999.99-536,3,33604,jim_waide,,3495.827,3504.452,"Because, Your Honor, he's... there has to be facts introduced sufficient to allow the jury to infer age discrimination."
1999.99-536,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3512.469,3516.363,I thought you were going to say it has to be a pretext for age discrimination.
1999.99-536,3,33604,jim_waide,,3516.363,3517.164,It has to be a pretext for age discrimination.
1999.99-536,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3517.164,3518.956,It can't be a pretext for hiding embezzlement or something.
1999.99-536,3,33604,jim_waide,,3518.956,3527.492,"If... if he had come in there... Mr. Sanderson had come in there... and said, actually what I think it is, I think Mr. Reeves has been going with my wife and that's the reason I fired him, then we'd have a different case."
1999.99-536,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3566.999,3568.639,"Mr. Waide... Mr. Waide, I don't understand."
1999.99-536,3,33604,jim_waide,,3574.656,3581.689,"--Your Honor, it's presented because... because the Fifth Circuit... that's what the Fifth Circuit said, that you've got to go further and prove something beyond."
1999.99-536,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3582.871,3583.68,"Well, you said... you said it's been proved."
1999.99-536,3,33604,jim_waide,,3589.156,3591.62,"--Your Honor, I'm just trying to give the Court all the facts about my case."
1999.99-536,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3605.859,3615.756,"--I thought you said you agreed with the statement that... that the charge to the jury was correct, that you have to show that this was not the reason and the age discrimination was."
1999.99-536,3,33604,jim_waide,,3619.447,3619.648,All right.
1999.99-536,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3648.037,3648.999,"Thank you, Mr. Waide."
