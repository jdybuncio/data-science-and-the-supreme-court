1987.86-1908,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.489,"We'll hear argument first this morning in number 86-1908, Stewart Organization, Inc. versus Ricoh Corporation."
1987.86-1908,0,23945,f_a_flowers_iii,,13.083,17.024,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1987.86-1908,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,219.39,220.959,"Mr. Flowers, can I ask you a question?"
1987.86-1908,0,23945,f_a_flowers_iii,,220.959,221.17,"Yes, sir."
1987.86-1908,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,221.17,225.464,"There was also a choice of law provision in the contract, wasn't there?"
1987.86-1908,0,23945,f_a_flowers_iii,,225.464,225.914,"Yes, sir."
1987.86-1908,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,225.914,228.686,And the parties agreed to apply New York law?
1987.86-1908,0,23945,f_a_flowers_iii,,228.686,229.136,"Yes, sir."
1987.86-1908,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,229.136,235.66,"Now, does New York law have any bearing on the issue we're talking about?"
1987.86-1908,0,23945,f_a_flowers_iii,,235.66,240.634,"New York law, Justice Stevens, does enforce forum selection clauses."
1987.86-1908,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,276.888,277.599,Excuse me.
1987.86-1908,0,23945,f_a_flowers_iii,,284.945,293.301,Alabama law would refuse to apply New York law with respect to the forum selection clause.
1987.86-1908,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,293.301,296.733,"I understand that, but what about with respect to the substance of the dispute?"
1987.86-1908,0,23945,f_a_flowers_iii,,296.733,305.369,"New York law would govern, assuming there was no conflict with the laws of Alabama."
1987.86-1908,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,310.24,329.986,"If Alabama's willing to apply New York substantive rules, what is the Alabama interest in not allowing the other... I understand you say there is a rule, but why do they have such a rule for a case like this where another State's law's going to apply any way?"
1987.86-1908,0,23945,f_a_flowers_iii,,329.986,357.935,"Well, it really gets down to the point that the fulfillment of the expectations of the parties is not the only interest in contract law, and the Courts of New York and Alabama and the court below recognized that the public policy of the forum State must be considered in deciding whether to apply or give effect to a choice of law clause."
1987.86-1908,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,357.935,361.708,"I understand, but what is Alabama's interest?"
1987.86-1908,0,23945,f_a_flowers_iii,,379.02,385.644,"Well, I don't think it's a question of whether the State law is concerned with what the Federal courts do."
1987.86-1908,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,451.118,454.25,"That isn't true in every situation, Mr. Flowers."
1987.86-1908,0,23945,f_a_flowers_iii,,478.816,480.268,"Well, that's true."
1987.86-1908,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,551.531,570.072,"Well, Mr. Flowers, I guess at least one or more of the Judges in the Court of Appeals thought that in making the venue, in deciding the venue issue that the parties' contractual provision is one of the factors to be considered."
1987.86-1908,0,23945,f_a_flowers_iii,,580.961,590.807,"First of all, the Court below did not base their decision to transfer on 1404(a)."
1987.86-1908,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,590.807,593.777,Do you think that the Court could have?
1987.86-1908,0,23945,f_a_flowers_iii,,599.402,600.953,"I don't think so, and for this reason."
1987.86-1908,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,658.311,669.047,"Wasn't the District Court, though, partly influenced by his view that the Alabama law should be given controlling significance here?"
1987.86-1908,0,23945,f_a_flowers_iii,,669.047,689.97,"Chief Justice Rehnquist, the Order by the District Court is a short one but in his finding that Alabama was as convenient forum as a New York forum, he did not say in his Order whether he considered the forum selection clause issue in making that determination of convenience."
1987.86-1908,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,711.155,715.829,You acknowledge that that's the second requirement and not just part of the first?
1987.86-1908,0,23945,f_a_flowers_iii,,715.829,717.319,Interest of justice?
1987.86-1908,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,717.319,720.0,You think that's a separate requirement?
1987.86-1908,0,23945,f_a_flowers_iii,,720.0,733.17,"Yes, sir, I think that there must be a finding of convenience in the parties of interest, and further convenience of the parties and witnesses, and further that it be in the interest of justice to support a transfer, and I rely on Ex Parte Collett."
1987.86-1908,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,733.17,738.543,For which purpose you can consider any other factors and not just the convenience of the parties and witnesses?
1987.86-1908,0,23945,f_a_flowers_iii,,738.543,743.628,"Well, you can--"
1987.86-1908,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,743.628,753.365,"That would make a big difference to me, if you think that there are two reasons why you can order a change of venue, either for the convenience of parties and witnesses, or in the interest of justice."
1987.86-1908,0,23945,f_a_flowers_iii,,753.365,753.644,"--No, sir, I'm contending that you've got to have both."
1987.86-1908,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,834.407,851.76,"Counsel, could the lower Court here, the District Court, have ordered that part of the action be transferred to New York and part retained in Alabama, assuming the requisite findings had been made?"
1987.86-1908,0,23945,f_a_flowers_iii,,854.311,869.501,"Justice Kennedy, the District Court held that the claims that were not... the non-contract claims could not be transferred to New York, even if the others could, which he said they couldn't, either."
1987.86-1908,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,882.472,888.846,"I just want to know, is there substantial authority in cases for Federal courts to transfer parts of actions and keep others?"
1987.86-1908,0,23945,f_a_flowers_iii,,890.616,896.169,I do not know of any case holding the retention of claims.
1987.86-1908,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,896.169,902.015,"I mean, because the District Court seemed to be influenced by that consideration in its order."
1987.86-1908,0,23945,f_a_flowers_iii,,904.226,912.862,"Well, I don't think that's the strongest point of his Order, but I'm just not aware of any cases other than the Bense case out of the Second Circuit and this one."
1987.86-1908,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,912.862,914.943,I agree that's not the strongest point in his Order.
1987.86-1908,0,23945,f_a_flowers_iii,,914.943,924.49,"Anyway, Alabama's law is an adoption of the common law policy."
1987.86-1908,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,946.422,948.315,"May I ask another question, Mr. Flowers?"
1987.86-1908,0,23945,f_a_flowers_iii,,959.572,964.074,"That's correct, unless the Federal Arbitration Act applies."
1987.86-1908,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,964.074,966.688,Then the Federal Statute would override that.
1987.86-1908,0,23945,f_a_flowers_iii,,966.688,966.908,Right.
1987.86-1908,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,966.908,985.59,"It's kind of ironic in a way... I understand your point, but... that arbitration which is a greater intrusion on the judicial process in Alabama than having it tried by another judicial forum in New York would override the policy but this action would not."
1987.86-1908,0,23945,f_a_flowers_iii,,988.533,988.883,That's right.
1987.86-1908,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1080.044,1090.362,"Well, wasn't the reasoning of the Eleventh Circuit majority, obviously they ruled against you, really that there is a Federal rule here, or Federal law, it's the Venue Statute?"
1987.86-1908,0,23945,f_a_flowers_iii,,1090.362,1098.226,"That's what they said, but I don't seen anywhere in the Venue Statutes that address this question."
1987.86-1908,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1101.418,1117.65,"Well, I know, but the contract certainly is aimed at controlling which Federal Court, if there's a diversity case, would try the case, which is a venue question, surely."
1987.86-1908,0,23945,f_a_flowers_iii,,1117.65,1120.262,"Well, the appropriate venue is determined by the Venue Statute."
1987.86-1908,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1120.262,1120.722,What does venue mean?
1987.86-1908,0,23945,f_a_flowers_iii,,1125.476,1126.167,That's correct.
1987.86-1908,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1126.167,1135.293,And the contractual provision is aimed directly at that question.
1987.86-1908,0,23945,f_a_flowers_iii,,1135.293,1135.832,"Yes, sir."
1987.86-1908,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1141.458,1146.591,And so the party argues that the Alabama Federal Court just isn't the proper Federal Court to hear the case.
1987.86-1908,0,23945,f_a_flowers_iii,,1146.591,1153.797,"--Well, I submit that, with all due respect, Your Honor, your analysis is wrong, and I say that for this reason."
1987.86-1908,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1225.997,1231.19,"Of course, you could have had an Alabama forum if you had just sued in Alabama courts."
1987.86-1908,0,23945,f_a_flowers_iii,,1231.19,1233.273,"No, sir, we had a Federal antitrust claim."
1987.86-1908,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1234.585,1236.335,This was an antitrust claim.
1987.86-1908,0,23945,f_a_flowers_iii,,1236.335,1238.007,"--There's one antitrust claim, yes, sir."
1987.86-1908,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1283.89,1298.179,"Suppose this had been an antitrust claim, so you had to sue in Federal court and then all of the arguments about diversity and Erie, things like that just wouldn't be relevant."
1987.86-1908,0,23945,f_a_flowers_iii,,1298.179,1299.989,"No, sir, I'd disagree, Justice White."
1987.86-1908,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1314.31,1320.514,"Well, that may be so, but it certainly avoids all the Erie arguments that you can make, doesn't it?"
1987.86-1908,0,23945,f_a_flowers_iii,,1320.514,1322.985,"No, sir, I don't think so."
1987.86-1908,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1322.985,1328.458,"Well, it certainly makes Bremen against Zapata more relevant if it isn't a diversity case, don't you think?"
1987.86-1908,0,23945,f_a_flowers_iii,,1328.458,1333.031,"Well, in a sense."
1987.86-1908,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1434.673,1441.184,I'm not sure that it's so anomalous to apply Federal law to some clauses in the contract and State law in the others.
1987.86-1908,0,23945,f_a_flowers_iii,,1452.984,1455.586,"Well, you simply have a Federal law that applies."
1987.86-1908,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1455.586,1456.074,That's right.
1987.86-1908,0,23945,f_a_flowers_iii,,1456.074,1459.036,You'd apply Federal law.
1987.86-1908,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1459.036,1463.58,"The Court would say, even if that's permissible under Alabama law, we don't care."
1987.86-1908,0,23945,f_a_flowers_iii,,1465.16,1465.491,That's right.
1987.86-1908,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1465.491,1469.595,So it's thinkable that you could apply Federal law to some.
1987.86-1908,0,23945,f_a_flowers_iii,,1469.595,1473.627,"Sure, but there's no Federal law governing enforceability of forum selection clauses, except this venue argument."
1987.86-1908,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1473.627,1475.147,But that's a different point.
1987.86-1908,0,23945,f_a_flowers_iii,,1476.198,1476.609,"Yes, sir."
1987.86-1908,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1482.125,1483.455,"Thank you, Mr. Flowers."
1987.86-1908,1,41853,scott_m_phelps,,1485.237,1495.152,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1987.86-1908,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1539.672,1559.754,"Before you get into whether there's any State interest, I really worry about importing into the Federal Venue Rules, the kind of choice of law determinations that have become standard in conflict of laws now."
1987.86-1908,1,41853,scott_m_phelps,,1574.946,1578.128,I think there are a number of parts to that question.
1987.86-1908,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1634.077,1649.945,"Suppose you have an Alabama contract rule that says that the insurance company cannot be held liable for penal damages in any event, all right?"
1987.86-1908,1,41853,scott_m_phelps,,1676.052,1681.566,"No, unless I misunderstood the hypothetical."
1987.86-1908,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1689.642,1690.321,"No, no, no."
1987.86-1908,1,41853,scott_m_phelps,,1721.144,1722.917,"Well, I am saying that."
1987.86-1908,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1750.887,1756.841,"Two different lines of analysis, aren't there?"
1987.86-1908,1,41853,scott_m_phelps,,1777.316,1787.061,I think that I am citing more of the second because I don't see it quite as distinct in two questions as the Chief Justice has put it.
1987.86-1908,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1801.012,1805.075,"Now, did either of the Courts below rely on that, on 1404?"
1987.86-1908,1,41853,scott_m_phelps,,1805.075,1817.033,"The Eleventh Circuit relied solely on the notion that venue is inherently a matter of Federal concern, which I think is equally a good position."
1987.86-1908,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1829.104,1831.374,But the District Court ruled against you.
1987.86-1908,1,41853,scott_m_phelps,,1831.374,1836.488,Because of his presumption that Alabama law applied.
1987.86-1908,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1855.401,1863.465,"Yet, the district court ruled against you on 1404, and as I read the Eleventh Circuit majority, they didn't rely on 1404."
1987.86-1908,1,41853,scott_m_phelps,,1863.465,1866.948,"I don't think that they ever really addressed 1404, actually."
1987.86-1908,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1869.569,1870.861,"Well, Tjoflat did."
1987.86-1908,1,41853,scott_m_phelps,,1870.861,1872.692,--Tjoflat did in the concurring opinion.
1987.86-1908,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1873.192,1875.824,I think the majority was aware of that?
1987.86-1908,1,41853,scott_m_phelps,,1875.824,1878.285,"I would presume so, yes, sir."
1987.86-1908,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1902.981,1906.484,"Mr. Phelps, a little while ago, you mentioned Burlington Northern."
1987.86-1908,1,41853,scott_m_phelps,,1924.268,1928.971,"It does, and I apologize for the oversight in the brief."
1987.86-1908,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2001.421,2003.023,A unanimous decision.
1987.86-1908,1,41853,scott_m_phelps,,2003.023,2003.351,"Yes, sir."
1987.86-1908,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2003.351,2006.346,And do you think it helps you or hurts you?
1987.86-1908,1,41853,scott_m_phelps,,2006.346,2007.064,I think it helps.
1987.86-1908,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2009.616,2011.289,But you don't cite it?
1987.86-1908,1,41853,scott_m_phelps,,2011.289,2015.109,"Yes, sir, that's right."
1987.86-1908,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2017.362,2017.522,You do now.
1987.86-1908,1,41853,scott_m_phelps,,2017.522,2018.223,I do now.
1987.86-1908,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2265.182,2268.284,"May I ask, you say the policy doesn't apply."
1987.86-1908,1,41853,scott_m_phelps,,2285.076,2288.469,--There's nothing in the opinion that suggests that.
1987.86-1908,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2311.277,2333.861,"Well, it's hard to read... I find it hard to read the Eleventh Circuit opinion by the majority as indicating that the transfer would be limited by 1404 considerations."
1987.86-1908,1,41853,scott_m_phelps,,2342.397,2349.312,The good thing about... the wisdom of the Bremen rule is that it matches up very nicely with 1404.
1987.86-1908,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2354.766,2361.09,So it didn't go through the relevant requirements under 1404.
1987.86-1908,1,41853,scott_m_phelps,,2361.09,2369.304,It didn't go through it beyond deciding that the forum selection clause should be given a strong presumption.
1987.86-1908,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2369.304,2369.785,Strong?
1987.86-1908,1,41853,scott_m_phelps,,2380.792,2381.684,They would have not transferred it.
1987.86-1908,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2381.684,2382.535,How do you know that?
1987.86-1908,1,41853,scott_m_phelps,,2382.535,2388.739,Because the case was reasoned by the Eleventh Circuit as the Bremen controls.
1987.86-1908,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2397.615,2401.799,"Well, how do we know that it was convenient to the parties to transfer it?"
1987.86-1908,1,41853,scott_m_phelps,,2401.799,2408.883,The District Court made a finding in a very inverted way that supports that position.
1987.86-1908,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2416.388,2416.558,Exactly.
1987.86-1908,1,41853,scott_m_phelps,,2420.501,2420.852,No.
1987.86-1908,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2448.791,2460.929,"Well, you say the judgmental analysis the discretion comes in the Bremen itself, and Judge Tjoflat would say it's factoring the forum selection clause into 1404."
1987.86-1908,1,41853,scott_m_phelps,,2463.041,2466.841,"That's what I'm saying, is that they fit together and they get to the same place."
1987.86-1908,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2503.665,2516.364,"Mr. Phelps, can I come back to your assertion that it makes a difference what the purpose of the State rule is in determining whether you will apply State law or Federal law."
1987.86-1908,1,41853,scott_m_phelps,,2546.785,2547.976,"No, the Federal court would."
1987.86-1908,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2552.971,2562.898,So then what difference does it make here whether the purpose of this State rule is to protect their courts or to protect their citizens?
1987.86-1908,1,41853,scott_m_phelps,,2562.898,2568.031,"The analysis in that cases changes slightly, and it's like York."
1987.86-1908,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2647.933,2649.095,Makes a lot of difference.
1987.86-1908,1,41853,scott_m_phelps,,2660.224,2661.763,--Not in this case.
1987.86-1908,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2697.38,2707.775,"Well, the rule that you're urging on us, though, and it is the first time I hear that you want it to apply only when the cause of action involves both a diversity cause of action and a Federal claim?"
1987.86-1908,1,41853,scott_m_phelps,,2715.181,2716.431,I think it would.
1987.86-1908,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2716.431,2719.193,"Well, in that case, it would make a difference."
1987.86-1908,1,41853,scott_m_phelps,,2720.434,2720.585,Yes.
1987.86-1908,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2802.96,2823.132,"I suppose you would agree if the validity of some substantive provision in the contract was at issue in a Federal court, you'd probably look to State law, some State law any way, the applicable State law?"
1987.86-1908,1,41853,scott_m_phelps,,2823.132,2823.893,Absolutely.
1987.86-1908,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2823.893,2830.528,And so why not look to State law with respect to the validity of this forum selection clause?
1987.86-1908,1,41853,scott_m_phelps,,2830.528,2838.134,Because the State law that is announced does not apply.
1987.86-1908,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2877.541,2884.297,"Well, what if there hadn't been a Federal issue in this case and the suit had been brought in a State court?"
1987.86-1908,1,41853,scott_m_phelps,,2884.297,2888.899,That's... Justice Scalia was working on me about that.
1987.86-1908,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2888.899,2889.059,Yes.
1987.86-1908,1,41853,scott_m_phelps,,2889.059,2894.284,I think the analysis is exactly the same.
1987.86-1908,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2928.369,2934.842,May I give you a converse case.
1987.86-1908,1,41853,scott_m_phelps,,2959.198,2965.014,I think that it would be an abuse of discretion for him to do that.
1987.86-1908,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2965.014,2970.298,Even if all the interest of justice factors point to Alabama as the logical venue for the trial?
1987.86-1908,1,41853,scott_m_phelps,,2970.298,2970.658,No.
1987.86-1908,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3237.649,3241.462,"Thank you, Mr. Phelps."
1987.86-1908,2,23945,f_a_flowers_iii,,3244.004,3253.16,I want to address three basic points in respondent's argument.
1987.86-1908,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3423.003,3424.767,"Thank you, Mr. Flowers."
