1966.86,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,28.125,"Number 86, United States versus Acme Process Equipment Company."
1966.86,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,29.385,33.35,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1966.86,1,32688,jack_rephan,,2025.956,2029.757,"Mister Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1966.86,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,2087.221,2089.859,What was Tucker's position?
1966.86,1,32688,jack_rephan,,2089.859,2090.213,Tucker's --
1966.86,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,2090.213,2092.958,"To the company, he had official position?"
1966.86,1,32688,jack_rephan,,2092.958,2112.477,Tucker was initially hired to be an expediter and because he said that he had knowledge in the field of government contract law and commercial contracts and he was initially retained to drum up business generally for government and commercial contracts as well.
1966.86,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,2112.477,2113.95,And on a commission basis?
1966.86,1,32688,jack_rephan,,2113.95,2116.767,He was initially on a commission basis.
1966.86,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2139.614,2143.852,"Well, one of the men involved in the -- I beg your pardon."
1966.86,1,32688,jack_rephan,,2152.546,2153.634,That's right Mr. Justice.
1966.86,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2153.634,2159.804,And he was -- I don't know whether he was an officer in a technical sense.
1966.86,1,32688,jack_rephan,,2159.804,2161.628,He was not an officer.
1966.86,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2164.51,2167.677,But he was a full time employee of the company.
1966.86,1,32688,jack_rephan,,2167.677,2168.161,"That's true, Your Honor."
1966.86,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2168.161,2173.696,"And he was head of a plant, not the plant in which this work was done but in another plant, is that right?"
1966.86,1,32688,jack_rephan,,2173.696,2174.563,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1966.86,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2174.563,2179.127,"And it was his father, Joshua Epstein, who was the president of the company."
1966.86,1,32688,jack_rephan,,2179.127,2180.426,"At that time, that's true."
1966.86,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2180.426,2198.492,"So that what we have here, as I understand it, as a minimum is two men, Tucker and Norris who were -- might be considered as the independent contractors, in a sense that they were compensated on a fee basis."
1966.86,1,32688,jack_rephan,,2206.132,2211.365,"That's true, Your Honor and we do not deny that he was an employee."
1966.86,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,2230.789,2237.98,Who signed the statement that Acme made with the Government that they did not have anyone on a contingent basis?
1966.86,1,32688,jack_rephan,,2237.98,2241.015,"There were several statements, Your Honor."
1966.86,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,2241.015,2243.302,One of the officials or did Tucker singed it?
1966.86,1,32688,jack_rephan,,2243.302,2247.503,"Well, Norris was given the authority to sign contracts initially."
1966.86,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,2249.763,2252.439,You mean Norris given that authority by Acme?
1966.86,1,32688,jack_rephan,,2252.439,2254.576,To sign the bids initially.
1966.86,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,2254.576,2257.086,"He was working for Acme, was he not?"
1966.86,1,32688,jack_rephan,,2257.086,2267.943,"Well, at the time Acme hired Mr. Norris and Mr. Tucker -- of course, they had already entered into agreements with the others -- some of the other subcontractors."
1966.86,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2316.086,2319.098,"Well, what was the violation of the contingent fee covenant?"
1966.86,1,32688,jack_rephan,,2327.22,2331.337,This was in the arrangement with Acme to get business for Acme and that's right Mr. Justice Brennan.
1966.86,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2331.337,2336.854,"That -- that's what the violation was which the Court of Claims said having done nothing about it over 14 months, the government can't --"
1966.86,1,32688,jack_rephan,,2336.854,2338.765,"For 14 months, that's correct Your Honor."
1966.86,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2338.765,2339.46,-- rely on it now.
1966.86,1,32688,jack_rephan,,2339.46,2342.015,It had nothing to do with the kickback arrangements whatsoever.
1966.86,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2342.015,2342.401,Yes.
1966.86,1,32688,jack_rephan,,2342.401,2343.228,This was an entirely different issue.
1966.86,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2343.228,2346.202,Had nothing to do with their kickback arrangements for subcontractors.
1966.86,1,32688,jack_rephan,,2346.202,2347.212,"That's true, Your Honor."
1966.86,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,2348.534,2362.365,"But you said there and I thought there might be some connection between the representations of Acme to the Government that there were no five-percenters in their group, in their organization?"
1966.86,1,32688,jack_rephan,,2362.365,2363.774,"No, Mr. Justice Clark."
1966.86,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2859.986,2886.474,"Suppose your -- I suppose your position at this point is that the Anti-Kickback Statute had no criminal provision, in other words just a civil provision, just had a civil remedy recovery of the amount involved that there is no principle of law which would enable the Government also to invoke the remedy of cancellation."
1966.86,1,32688,jack_rephan,,2886.474,2888.779,That's true Mr. Justice Fortas.
1966.86,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2909.517,2925.064,"I suppose the Government in about midway through the performance of the contract, should've find out that kickbacks are taking place as it did in this instance."
1966.86,1,32688,jack_rephan,,2933.296,2935.195,"Your Honor, that's exactly our position."
1966.86,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2936.696,2949.332,They didn't have to go ahead and let the fellow perform the contract and pay the fellow under the contract even though the situation were ripe with kickbacks.
1966.86,1,32688,jack_rephan,,2949.332,2955.16,"Your Honor, they have the right to withhold payment in the amount of the kickbacks."
1966.86,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2989.586,2993.517,"I say, it'd be kind of an uncomfortable situation now."
1966.86,1,32688,jack_rephan,,2993.517,2996.878,I believe so Your Honor.
1966.86,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2996.878,3003.128,"Well, did the Government ever assert the right to cancel for some convenience?"
1966.86,1,32688,jack_rephan,,3003.128,3010.582,This came up at the -- there some discussions at the time as to whether -- in fact it was after the actual cancellation --
1966.86,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3010.582,3020.643,"Oh, I'll put it this way, why has the Government precluded that this point from saying this cancellation is for the convenience of the Government pursuant to the terms of the contract?"
1966.86,1,32688,jack_rephan,,3020.643,3029.094,"Well, Your Honor, they made an express point of saying under no circumstances shall the contract be treated as a term “for convenience.”"
1966.86,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3034.939,3044.48,What would have been -- would there been some principles of which were applicable then to determine the amount that the Government would have to pay if it were a cancellation?
1966.86,1,32688,jack_rephan,,3044.48,3058.248,"Mr. Justice White, its true that under the contract, they were principles, cost principles as to how the termination cost would be determined if the Government invoked the termination for convenience clause."
1966.86,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3058.248,3067.232,Now has anybody has -- is there any way of figuring out at this point or knowing from this record what -- how much it would've had -- been had to pay?
1966.86,1,32688,jack_rephan,,3067.232,3072.976,The commissioner has an estimate in his findings of fact --
1966.86,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3072.976,3073.25,On the --
1966.86,1,32688,jack_rephan,,3073.25,3075.884,"-- of approximately $300,000."
1966.86,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3075.884,3077.059,If it had been a convenience?
1966.86,1,32688,jack_rephan,,3077.059,3078.911,If it had been a convenience termination.
1966.86,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3079.638,3088.541,"Why wasn't the Government -- did not specify, do you know why the Government specified this should not be considered a cancellation for convenience?"
1966.86,1,32688,jack_rephan,,3088.541,3101.594,"Well, I think this really involved General (Inaudible) in the discussions with G4 -- at the time G4 considered this weapon obsolete, they wanted to cancel all orders for the seventy five millimeter recoilless rifle."
1966.86,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3101.594,3105.277,"Because -- it's the difference between paying nothing and $300,000, I gather."
1966.86,1,32688,jack_rephan,,3105.277,3105.821,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1966.86,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3105.821,3106.444,That's really the --
1966.86,1,32688,jack_rephan,,3106.444,3121.49,"And the Government said -- in fact, the plaintiffs' position in the court below was that the reason this contract was really cancelled and the reason the Government really threw in the defenses of Anti-Kickback was to save itself $300,000."
1966.86,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3124.138,3125.613,The Government doesn't want to pay anything --
1966.86,1,32688,jack_rephan,,3125.613,3127.432,"The Government doesn't want to pay one nickel, that's correct, Your Honor."
1966.86,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3127.432,3132.394,"And if its position is upheld across the board, they won't pay anything?"
1966.86,1,32688,jack_rephan,,3132.394,3153.75,"On the damage question which I am about to reach, Your Honor, if the Court should hold that the Court of Claims adopted an erroneous measure of damages, under the commissioners' findings, the contractor is entitled approximately $314,000."
1966.86,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3153.95,3156.773,That -- that's only if the cancellation was wrongful.
1966.86,1,32688,jack_rephan,,3156.773,3158.234,If the cancelling -- lation --
1966.86,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3158.234,3159.542,If the cancellation was wrongful.
1966.86,1,32688,jack_rephan,,3159.542,3161.167,Was wrongful.
1966.86,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3161.621,3166.137,"But if the -- they were right in doing it, the Government doesn't pay anything."
1966.86,1,32688,jack_rephan,,3166.137,3167.915,"That's our position, Your Honor."
1966.86,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3181.258,3188.315,"No, but if the Government's position were sustained by us, I gather the Government will have to pay you a nickel, would they?"
1966.86,1,32688,jack_rephan,,3188.315,3189.821,"That's true, Your Honor."
1966.86,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3189.821,3193.013,Have to say what?
1966.86,1,32688,jack_rephan,,3193.013,3194.344,Would not have to pay --
1966.86,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3194.344,3194.709,Yes.
1966.86,1,32688,jack_rephan,,3194.709,3197.562,-- anything if the -- if we sustained the Government's position.
1966.86,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3197.562,3202.153,Yes.
1966.86,1,32688,jack_rephan,,3202.153,3212.481,"I might add that the Government knew about these kickback acts, the alleged violations prior to the time the contract was cancelled."
1966.86,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3212.481,3214.167,How long before?
1966.86,1,32688,jack_rephan,,3214.167,3216.873,"Approximately, two or three months?"
1966.86,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3216.873,3218.705,Was there a finding?
1966.86,1,32688,jack_rephan,,3218.705,3220.189,There's a finding I believe.
1966.86,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3220.189,3223.279,"Well, just -- don't try to -- looking for it, just what was the substance of it?"
1966.86,1,32688,jack_rephan,,3223.279,3227.369,The substance was it was in between April and July that the Government --
1966.86,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3227.369,3229.871,"Specifically, of what kickbacks, Tucker and --?"
1966.86,1,32688,jack_rephan,,3229.871,3239.902,"The names particularly of the gun engineering transaction between Norris and Epstein and Tucker and this dummy corporation and All Metals, the principal subcontractor."
1966.86,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3239.902,3241.223,Three months before the cancellation?
1966.86,1,32688,jack_rephan,,3241.223,3243.706,Approximately three months.
1966.86,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3413.287,3426.789,"Let's assume for a moment you had sued for damages, Acme had sued for damages for a breach of contract, what would you have recovered?"
1966.86,1,32688,jack_rephan,,3426.789,3445.5,"Mr. Justice White I believe the commissioner as far as damages is probably adopted the correct theory since it was shown that Acme could have reduced its losses, the measure of damages would be the unreimbursed cost as of the date of the breach."
1966.86,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3445.5,3447.762,"That's $314,000.00?"
1966.86,1,32688,jack_rephan,,3447.762,3452.811,"Well, in substance the total would be less cost of completion or loss to complete the contract."
1966.86,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3467.68,3475.898,"But if you had sued for damages, you would've been starting out -- configuring from the contract price for these rifles?"
1966.86,1,32688,jack_rephan,,3475.898,3480.979,"Well, the contract price for the rifles which had been delivered had been paid for."
1966.86,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3531.406,3547.398,"Tell me, in that connection, as in the matter of eligibility for future contract, had there been a cancellation for the convenience of the Government, well, I guess, the no question Acme's eligibility to bid on future contract."
1966.86,1,32688,jack_rephan,,3554.415,3566.522,"Mr. Justice Brennan, I think obviously not because the findings of facts make it clear that the Government said specifically that Acme was never considered to be in this repute in Government circles."
1966.86,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3579.01,3595.556,"Well, let's -- if the Government had said, “We cancelled the contract, one because of the Anti-Kickback Act -- activities here; or two, if that doesn't stick for our convenience, under the contract.”"
1966.86,1,32688,jack_rephan,,3608.146,3609.152,Your Honor --
1966.86,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3609.152,3613.184,Just because the Government disclaimed it?
1966.86,1,32688,jack_rephan,,3613.184,3613.468,Well this --
1966.86,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3613.468,3621.976,After all you've agreed in the way the contract is written to let the Government walk away from the contractor a certain amount of money?
1966.86,1,32688,jack_rephan,,3621.976,3635.637,"Well, why Your Honor, should the Government be allowed to do one thing and then when it's told its wrong here, they go by retroactively and say, “Well, now we're going to treat it as -- terminate it for convenience.”"
1966.86,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3653.334,3662.036,"Well, it's possible that the cancellation for convenience to the Government might give you more than the simple -- than ordinary damages."
1966.86,1,32688,jack_rephan,,3662.036,3663.894,It was approximately the same under the commissioner's --
1966.86,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3663.894,3675.182,"Oh, I know but this might give you a little bit more and what if we held that that giving -- that giving restitution was going too far?"
1966.86,1,32688,jack_rephan,,3675.182,3675.675,"Well, this raise --"
1966.86,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3675.675,3681.006,"Then what should you rather have -- which would you rather have, damages or cancellation for a --"
1966.86,1,32688,jack_rephan,,3681.006,3688.61,"Well, Your Honor, I might point out that even restitution not -- is not necessarily more here because the court says, they're reasonable cost."
1966.86,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3694.088,3694.473,Right.
1966.86,1,32688,jack_rephan,,3699.834,3701.072,"No, Your Honor, they have not."
1966.86,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3717.839,3719.359,That's still to be decided?
1966.86,1,32688,jack_rephan,,3719.359,3720.412,"That -- that's correct, Your Honor."
1966.86,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3723.25,3724.86,"But this may be shaved down, we don't know how much?"
1966.86,1,32688,jack_rephan,,3724.86,3727.325,This could be shaved down.
1966.86,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3731.496,3736.441,"Not likely to be shaved down to $314,000, I gather?"
1966.86,1,32688,jack_rephan,,3736.441,3739.76,Of course it goes back to the commissioner who made the initial determination.
1966.86,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3739.76,3743.557,Then either one of you would be up here instead of the shaved down readily?
1966.86,1,32688,jack_rephan,,3743.557,3750.774,"Well, that's true, Your Honor, but we submit that it's grossly unfair for the Government to say, “We're not going to terminate it.”"
1966.86,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3768.343,3772.474,"Mr. Solicitor General, you may have three minutes to --"
1966.86,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3772.474,3783.857,It's just two points on the question of Mr. Justice Fortas about how minor an official Norris is on page 125 of the record.
