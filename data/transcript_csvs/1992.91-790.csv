1992.91-790,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.965,"We'll hear argument now in number 91-790, CSX Transportation, Inc. v. Lizzie Beatrice Easterwood, and vice versa."
1992.91-790,0,28253,howard_j_trienens,,11.575,14.87,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1992.91-790,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,131.59,140.445,"At what time, at what date was the State law on grade crossings preempted in your view?"
1992.91-790,0,28253,howard_j_trienens,,140.445,142.132,1977.
1992.91-790,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,142.132,145.647,And that was at the time of the first regulation was issued?
1992.91-790,0,28253,howard_j_trienens,,145.647,146.1,Yes.
1992.91-790,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,146.1,149.114,What did that regulation require?
1992.91-790,0,28253,howard_j_trienens,,149.114,167.356,"It provided that the responsibility for determining the selection of devices... and we're talking now only about that State law tort duty, not all of them, but the State law tort duty of picking a reasonable selection of a device, gate, sign, flashing lights, which device shall be done."
1992.91-790,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,172.62,188.27,Even there there was going to be a lapse between the time the State could implement its program and the time when the railroads might begin withdrawing from this field.
1992.91-790,0,28253,howard_j_trienens,,189.363,191.863,"Well, possibly."
1992.91-790,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,204.856,208.824,"Well, except I think we should identify the point at which preemption occurred."
1992.91-790,0,28253,howard_j_trienens,,208.824,216.086,"Under the statute, the preemption occurred when the Secretary issued a regulation covering the subject matter of the State requirement."
1992.91-790,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,220.413,221.615,The problem--
1992.91-790,0,28253,howard_j_trienens,,266.051,266.832,"No, no."
1992.91-790,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,267.129,268.847,"--railroads, State, Federal, nobody."
1992.91-790,0,28253,howard_j_trienens,,268.847,271.018,--The question is who has got the responsibility and the duty.
1992.91-790,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,280.652,282.949,And you say that during that lapsed period--
1992.91-790,0,28253,howard_j_trienens,,282.949,283.824,"No, no, not the--"
1992.91-790,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,283.824,302.754,"--if... during that period, after the promulgation of that regulation, if there were an accident at a rail crossing, the person injured would not be able to sue the railroad because it was no longer the railroad's responsibility to guard the crossing by some device, nor could he sue the State because the State--"
1992.91-790,0,28253,howard_j_trienens,,302.754,303.332,--No.
1992.91-790,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,303.332,303.972,--He couldn't sue the State.
1992.91-790,0,28253,howard_j_trienens,,303.972,304.221,Why?
1992.91-790,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,304.893,306.876,Because the statute had just been passed.
1992.91-790,0,28253,howard_j_trienens,,311.515,313.358,These things didn't happen overnight.
1992.91-790,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,334.24,334.569,No.
1992.91-790,0,28253,howard_j_trienens,,338.676,344.752,--It's also 4 years after Congress passed the Highway Safety Act and section 130 that said that the States had this responsibility.
1992.91-790,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,366.727,375.49,"--Mr. Trienens, I'm having a... I guess a different problem about identifying the scope of the subject matter, and let me just give an example."
1992.91-790,0,28253,howard_j_trienens,,476.386,477.339,"No, no."
1992.91-790,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,490.193,496.613,Why does it imply a responsibility as opposed simply to a remaining power?
1992.91-790,0,28253,howard_j_trienens,,506.233,512.294,"No, because the reg in question... you're referring to I believe part 646 of the manual."
1992.91-790,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,512.294,512.511,"Yes, that's right."
1992.91-790,0,28253,howard_j_trienens,,512.511,517.4,The one I'm talking about is 924 and 655.
1992.91-790,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,561.649,564.444,"Well, does the manual have the force and effect of law?"
1992.91-790,0,28253,howard_j_trienens,,564.444,565.163,It's a regulation.
1992.91-790,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,570.348,593.291,"But even assuming that, isn't it still... number one, your argument basically is that by placing a responsibility on a State or local agency, that that is a regulation on the subject matter within the meaning of the Federal statute."
1992.91-790,0,28253,howard_j_trienens,,606.693,623.138,"Well, the manual and the way the States wanted it, because there was a... there was an effort to have further detail and elaborate formulas on whether gates or not gates... the way the States wanted it, knowing they had this responsibility, was to say there was a variety of circumstances, and they wanted more flexibility."
1992.91-790,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,690.379,705.075,"How do we know that the subject matter is the subject matter of all State rules affecting safety at grade crossings as opposed to State rules or simply rules affecting the need for devices, which is simply a subset of the former?"
1992.91-790,0,28253,howard_j_trienens,,705.075,710.525,"Well, I'm only talking now about the duty to select the appropriate device."
1992.91-790,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,761.553,772.142,"Mr. Trienens, why don't... why isn't a better explanation of what you're arguing for that this is conflict preemption?"
1992.91-790,0,28253,howard_j_trienens,,805.893,814.811,"Well, our argument in our brief makes both the conflict point and the point that the 434 covers the subject matter."
1992.91-790,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,841.894,842.504,Do you think--
1992.91-790,0,28253,howard_j_trienens,,842.504,843.41,--That's why I emphasized that point.
1992.91-790,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,843.41,850.703,--Is it sufficient to say that the subject matter of the State requirement is who's responsible?
1992.91-790,0,28253,howard_j_trienens,,850.703,850.984,"No, no."
1992.91-790,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,851.499,853.092,That's a strange subject matter.
1992.91-790,0,28253,howard_j_trienens,,853.092,853.295,"No, no."
1992.91-790,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,892.311,906.445,Does the plaintiff's theory include a failure... a theory that somehow the railroad failed to identify the existence of a hazardous crossing?
1992.91-790,0,28253,howard_j_trienens,,906.445,923.033,"Well, I... their theory apparently, as stated in their brief, is that the railroad had the responsibility... and presumably implicitly we failed to perform this duty... of determining that improved grade crossing devices are needed and to implement them."
1992.91-790,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,927.843,936.653,Or to at least identify and call to the attention of the State authorities the hazards?
1992.91-790,0,28253,howard_j_trienens,,936.653,943.588,"Well, they make that point, but it's... first place, if it's their responsibility... and after all, the railroads work with these people all the time."
1992.91-790,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1009.544,1014.371,"Well, would that give rise to a State law defense in the cause of--"
1992.91-790,0,28253,howard_j_trienens,,1014.371,1020.447,"Well, what it does give rise to is that the States are responsible."
1992.91-790,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1028.973,1029.301,"--Well, excuse me."
1992.91-790,0,28253,howard_j_trienens,,1032.036,1032.395,To whom?
1992.91-790,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1033.238,1034.535,To the railroad?
1992.91-790,0,28253,howard_j_trienens,,1034.535,1050.404,"I don't know because all I'm concerned about here is the fact that having this process, having the Federal regulations prescribing the process, and having a statute that says that when you cover this very subject matter, it's preempted, we don't get to that."
1992.91-790,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1060.68,1065.475,"Mr. Trienens, are you going to talk at all about the speed issue?"
1992.91-790,0,28253,howard_j_trienens,,1069.614,1075.018,"Well, the... on the speed issue, that's the one where we are the respondent."
1992.91-790,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1107.209,1110.394,What happens if the train went 70... went over the speed limit?
1992.91-790,0,28253,howard_j_trienens,,1113.284,1121.702,"It would be a violation of Federal law, but you could sue in the State court on a common law basis under a case Justice Brennan wrote called Crane."
1992.91-790,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1126.888,1127.232,--You could be covered.
1992.91-790,0,28253,howard_j_trienens,,1139.665,1144.209,"Well, the local hazard... I think the court of appeals below and the Solicitor General, we all agree."
1992.91-790,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1155.157,1157.64,"Well, but what would be?"
1992.91-790,0,28253,howard_j_trienens,,1173.542,1175.54,"Preempted, but there's the City of Cartersville."
1992.91-790,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1190.471,1212.635,"No, not a gate problem, just that because of the particular local conditions, the 60-mile-an-hour speed... it seems to me you could read the statute as saying the speed limit is not always going to be... there could be an essentially local safety hazard which would indicate that a lower rate of speed would be necessary to avoid the danger at that local place."
1992.91-790,0,28253,howard_j_trienens,,1212.635,1234.391,"Well, if a State... not the city, but if a State were to come along and say because there's something very unusual about the Horseshoe Curve... and I picked that because that's in the legislative history... and therefore, somehow there ought to be a special speed limit there, then I think... then that local exception would apply, but nobody has tried--"
1992.91-790,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1234.391,1237.123,"And that could apply even in a jury trial, even without a regulation."
1992.91-790,0,28253,howard_j_trienens,,1237.123,1237.405,--No.
1992.91-790,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1242.608,1246.011,"It's a more stringent law, rule, regulation, order, or standard."
1992.91-790,0,28253,howard_j_trienens,,1248.324,1248.948,--No.
1992.91-790,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1250.104,1257.601,"I guess I have a problem that goes one step beyond Justice Stevens', and again it's a textual problem."
1992.91-790,0,28253,howard_j_trienens,,1283.747,1292.15,"Well, we don't agree that there's any such implication, and one of the reasons is that the Secretary of Transportation has a number of motives, one of which is to get the trains through."
1992.91-790,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1310.282,1318.185,Suppose the railroad knows that the main road is closed and that a lot of school buses are taking a detour over an unmarked crossing.
1992.91-790,0,28253,howard_j_trienens,,1319.84,1323.199,"The railroad... no, no."
1992.91-790,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1324.637,1326.869,"Snowstorm, fog, no duty to slow down?"
1992.91-790,0,28253,howard_j_trienens,,1326.869,1327.213,--No.
1992.91-790,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1331.289,1333.274,Suppose they see the school bus stalled.
1992.91-790,0,28253,howard_j_trienens,,1334.475,1334.694,That's a lookout question.
1992.91-790,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1346.454,1349.236,"Do the regulations talk about a lookout problem, or is this something--"
1992.91-790,0,28253,howard_j_trienens,,1349.236,1349.281,--No.
1992.91-790,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1349.719,1351.828,--Why?
1992.91-790,0,28253,howard_j_trienens,,1353.53,1357.357,"Well, the Secretary, not having issued a regulation on that, the State law continues in force."
1992.91-790,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1357.357,1366.322,"Well, I'm not sure when a lookout problem begins and when a speed problem ends."
1992.91-790,0,28253,howard_j_trienens,,1366.322,1377.318,"Well, if he's going at the allowable speed, he looks, and under your question, he sees a school bus sitting there, he has got to take every step to... first, he has got to maintain an adequate lookout, and secondly, he has got to take every feasible step to avoid the accident."
1992.91-790,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1419.02,1422.019,"Thank you, Mr. Trienens."
1992.91-790,1,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,1425.003,1439.215,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1992.91-790,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1512.686,1516.777,"Well, Ms. Mahoney, on the grade crossing area--"
1992.91-790,1,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,1516.777,1517.605,"Yes, Your Honor."
1992.91-790,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1517.605,1532.459,--how should we view the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices which says the determination of need and selection of devices at a grade crossing is made by the public agency?
1992.91-790,1,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,1532.459,1537.786,We do not disagree that the determination has to be made by the public agency.
1992.91-790,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1541.721,1548.467,"Well, so, could there be a State tort law obligation on the railroad then to identify the need?"
1992.91-790,1,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,1548.467,1549.592,"--Absolutely, Your Honor."
1992.91-790,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1572.24,1575.973,"Authority over it, Ms. Mahoney, but not responsibility for it."
1992.91-790,1,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,1619.284,1628.872,"Your Honor, we don't see what you... we do not see anywhere in the statutes or the regulations that say that it is the State's responsibility to ensure that the grade crossings are safe."
1992.91-790,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1629.966,1631.231,It does not say that?
1992.91-790,1,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,1636.323,1638.181,--That's different than the MUTCD.
1992.91-790,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1685.397,1686.303,I'm not talking about payment.
1992.91-790,1,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,1712.496,1715.541,Unless... only when Federal funds are being used.
1992.91-790,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1715.541,1715.9,Only when Federal.
1992.91-790,1,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,1718.946,1721.023,"No, not under Federal law."
1992.91-790,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1734.83,1736.017,Doesn't the Federal Government--
1992.91-790,1,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,1736.017,1736.658,That would be a Pennhurst problem.
1992.91-790,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1736.658,1737.688,"--Ms. Mahoney, doesn't the Federal Government--"
1992.91-790,1,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,1739.907,1741.062,I'm sorry.
1992.91-790,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1767.629,1776.797,"But, Ms. Mahoney, this Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices is not speaking about Federally funded projects."
1992.91-790,1,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,1776.797,1777.047,"--No, it is not, Your Honor."
1992.91-790,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1777.047,1782.123,It just says the determination of need and selection of devices at a grade crossing--
1992.91-790,1,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,1782.123,1782.935,Yes.
1992.91-790,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1782.935,1784.764,--is made by the public agency--
1992.91-790,1,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,1784.764,1785.513,"Yes, it does."
1992.91-790,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1785.513,1786.841,"--I take it, meaning the State."
1992.91-790,1,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,1786.841,1791.386,This was adopted by virtue of... the history is important here.
1992.91-790,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1819.171,1822.108,"Well, that is certain State responsibility--"
1992.91-790,1,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,1822.108,1822.733,State--
1992.91-790,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1822.733,1825.591,--imposed by Federal regulation.
1992.91-790,1,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,1825.591,1833.339,--But it doesn't say that the State must go out on its own and determine what crossings need to be improved.
1992.91-790,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1850.862,1853.736,"Ms. Mahoney, does the... are you finished with your answer?"
1992.91-790,1,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,1853.736,1854.033,Yes.
1992.91-790,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1854.033,1861.373,Does the State have an obligation under Federal statutes to make a survey of all grade crossings?

1992.91-790,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1874.182,1879.039,"And this State, the State of Georgia, I take it, has undertaken that survey, has it not?"
1992.91-790,1,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,1879.039,1879.695,"Yes, it has."
1992.91-790,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1879.695,1888.097,And your position is that they are required to survey these nonfunded intersections just for the fun of it.
1992.91-790,1,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,1888.097,1888.753,"No, Your Honor."
1992.91-790,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1896.031,1896.218,But they're not used.
1992.91-790,1,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,1905.371,1905.887,"Well, you can't--"
1992.91-790,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1905.887,1907.433,--you shall survey every one in the State.
1992.91-790,1,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,1907.777,1914.399,"--Your Honor, how can you decide which ones you're going to use it on, if the whole point is you want to prioritize, unless you survey all of them?"
1992.91-790,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1925.115,1936.234,"No, you don't, and your position on the requirement that they shall determine the need is that they shall determine the need if the railroad comes and says there's a need."
1992.91-790,1,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,1938.811,1939.577,--We're talking about under the MUTCD.
1992.91-790,2,42506,tambra_p_colston,,2047.815,2057.654,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1992.91-790,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2087.003,2088.627,"Where can we find this in your brief, Mrs. Colston?"
1992.91-790,2,42506,tambra_p_colston,,2088.627,2091.639,"--Your Honor, it is all the way through there."
1992.91-790,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2104.417,2104.98,Thank you.
1992.91-790,2,42506,tambra_p_colston,,2104.98,2126.878,"Congress declares that the laws, rules, regulations, orders, and standards relating to railroad safety should be nationally uniform to the extent practicable, thus beginning the section with a recognition that all laws relating to railroad safety can't be completely uniform."
1992.91-790,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2171.453,2174.967,"Why do you say the statute is drawn very narrowly, Mrs. Colston?"
1992.91-790,2,42506,tambra_p_colston,,2174.967,2186.946,"Your Honor, without 434... the preemption might have even been broader without it, but it preserves State laws relating to railroad safety until the Secretary covered the subject matter, and that--"
1992.91-790,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2186.946,2192.209,"Well, yes, but that doesn't strike me as either a narrow or a broad statute."
1992.91-790,2,42506,tambra_p_colston,,2195.427,2202.924,"--Yes, Your Honor, it is fairly common, but the language used... the language Congress chose... we have to assume they knew the meaning of what they were saying."
1992.91-790,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2202.924,2210.64,"Well, that's exactly the language I'm referring to, and I'm telling you I don't see how you can classify that as a narrow preemption provision."
1992.91-790,2,42506,tambra_p_colston,,2210.64,2220.261,"Your Honor, I classify it as such because it says that State law is preserved relating to railroad safety, and then when it says what's preempted, what does it say?"
1992.91-790,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2358.317,2362.674,The statute does not say completely cover the subject matter.
1992.91-790,2,42506,tambra_p_colston,,2362.674,2362.861,"--No, Your Honor."
1992.91-790,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2362.861,2371.888,"It said... it says it has to be a... have adopted a rule, regulation, order, or standard covering the subject matter of such State requirement."
1992.91-790,2,42506,tambra_p_colston,,2371.888,2372.576,"Yes, Your Honor."
1992.91-790,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2440.455,2443.079,"Ms. Colston, I thought about this when I was reading it."
1992.91-790,2,42506,tambra_p_colston,,2450.124,2451.356,--Absolutely.
1992.91-790,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2451.356,2460.493,"Does that mean that in these rail yards that are near Union Station down here if the roadbed is good enough, the speed would be 60 or 110?"
1992.91-790,2,42506,tambra_p_colston,,2460.493,2460.915,"Yes, Your Honor."
1992.91-790,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2462.04,2467.241,"Are they shown that way on the national maps, that if you want to, you can do 110 in the rail yard?"
1992.91-790,2,42506,tambra_p_colston,,2467.241,2469.458,"--Your Honor, I don't know what the national maps show."
1992.91-790,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2495.151,2502.898,"You say that common... under your view, I take it, every municipality in the State of Georgia could pass a speed limit for trains passing through it?"
1992.91-790,2,42506,tambra_p_colston,,2502.898,2505.85,"--Yes, Your Honor, and in most cases they do."
1992.91-790,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2516.393,2519.173,Those cases held what was preempted?
1992.91-790,2,42506,tambra_p_colston,,2520.345,2521.845,--The local speed ordinances because they said they--
1992.91-790,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2521.845,2523.563,--That the local ordinances were invalid?
1992.91-790,2,42506,tambra_p_colston,,2523.563,2525.28,--In the lower courts.
1992.91-790,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2526.92,2533.791,I'm asking what is your position if a municipality passes an ordinance regulating the speed of trains.
1992.91-790,2,42506,tambra_p_colston,,2533.791,2536.618,"--I believe, Your Honor, that ordinance is not preempted."
1992.91-790,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2547.506,2552.207,And different municipalities could have different speed limits in the State of Georgia.
1992.91-790,2,42506,tambra_p_colston,,2552.207,2554.596,"--Yes, Your Honor, and I understand the concern that you're getting at."
1992.91-790,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2575.993,2579.179,"Well, you don't deny that the Secretary could do that if he wanted to."
1992.91-790,2,42506,tambra_p_colston,,2579.179,2580.007,He sure could.
1992.91-790,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2580.007,2582.756,Your point here is just that this particular regulation doesn't do it.
1992.91-790,2,42506,tambra_p_colston,,2582.756,2584.381,"That's absolutely right, Your Honor."
1992.91-790,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2584.381,2591.128,"So, if your... I mean, you acknowledge, do you not, that if the Secretary wanted to establish uniform speed limits for trains, he could."
1992.91-790,2,42506,tambra_p_colston,,2591.128,2592.097,He certainly could.
1992.91-790,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2592.487,2593.455,You just say he hasn't done it here.
1992.91-790,2,42506,tambra_p_colston,,2593.455,2607.543,"--No, sir, he has not, and I'm not certain how long he'd be Secretary if he did because the headlines, if they said... can you imagine saying Congress says we can travel 110 miles an hour across... through grade crossings on all railroad tracks in the United States."
1992.91-790,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2619.397,2620.257,I wonder if you're right about that.
1992.91-790,2,42506,tambra_p_colston,,2627.177,2632.487,"--That would be great, Your Honor, but 65 percent of the crossings out there have no active protection at all."
1992.91-790,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2632.487,2640.921,But what I'm suggesting is that perhaps the protection against the particular accidents you describe must rely on the crossing problem rather than the speed of the train.
1992.91-790,2,42506,tambra_p_colston,,2640.921,2642.779,"It's both very important, Your Honor."
1992.91-790,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2643.732,2650.433,"But if the crossing is adequately protected, I don't know why, if I'm sitting there in my car, I wouldn't rather have the train go by real fast rather than slow."
1992.91-790,2,42506,tambra_p_colston,,2650.433,2650.465,"--Yes, sir."
1992.91-790,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2666.615,2668.77,"It's a safety factor too, is it not?"
1992.91-790,2,42506,tambra_p_colston,,2668.77,2669.582,"--Yes, it is."
1992.91-790,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2669.582,2672.94,"I mean, not everybody is as patient as Justice Stevens and would sit there if it was a slow--"
1992.91-790,2,42506,tambra_p_colston,,2673.502,2676.657,"Absolutely, Your Honor, and it is a safety factor."
1992.91-790,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2734.68,2741.46,What's your position if a grade crossing has been improved with the crossing gate using Federal funds?
1992.91-790,2,42506,tambra_p_colston,,2741.46,2744.068,"Your Honor, if the crossing has been improved--"
1992.91-790,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2744.068,2744.91,Or pardon me.
1992.91-790,2,42506,tambra_p_colston,,2747.27,2752.845,"--We look at those, the gate arm regulations, strictly as funding regulations."
1992.91-790,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2755.172,2756.781,"So, your answer is no preemption."
1992.91-790,2,42506,tambra_p_colston,,2756.781,2757.859,"--No preemption, sir."
1992.91-790,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2775.93,2780.428,What jury is going to hold a railroad liable for doing everything that the railroad--
1992.91-790,2,42506,tambra_p_colston,,2780.428,2782.537,"Your Honor, I believe in the jury system."
1992.91-790,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2782.537,2783.474,--Come on.
1992.91-790,2,42506,tambra_p_colston,,2784.583,2791.159,"I believe in the jury system completely, and I do believe that more times than not they do the right thing."
1992.91-790,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2871.799,2875.766,"As I understand it, they have to survey every one of the crossings in the State."
1992.91-790,2,42506,tambra_p_colston,,2878.078,2880.625,"No, sir, not the private crossings at all."
1992.91-790,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2880.625,2881.342,"No, not the private, just the public ones."
1992.91-790,2,42506,tambra_p_colston,,2881.342,2882.249,Just the public crossings.
1992.91-790,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2883.327,2885.451,"But they can't look at a map and just say, well, we know."
1992.91-790,2,42506,tambra_p_colston,,2905.614,2906.426,"--Well, maybe they do."
1992.91-790,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2911.127,2911.596,They're not allowed to.
1992.91-790,2,42506,tambra_p_colston,,2913.423,2913.657,"Well, they're supposed to look at them all."
1992.91-790,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2913.657,2914.22,--they have to do all of them.
1992.91-790,2,42506,tambra_p_colston,,2914.22,2915.86,They're supposed to look at them all.
1992.91-790,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2948.643,2953.985,"Mrs. Colston, were there Federal funds involved in the site of this case?"
1992.91-790,2,42506,tambra_p_colston,,2953.985,2960.061,"--Your Honor, Mr. Trienens was correct up to a point, that they did decide... they did put it... well, let me say this."
1992.91-790,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2976.304,2976.851,No.
1992.91-790,2,42506,tambra_p_colston,,2982.66,2985.722,I wish I could.
1992.91-790,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3011.009,3013.024,And the accident occurred at Cook Street?
1992.91-790,2,42506,tambra_p_colston,,3013.024,3013.431,"--Yes, sir."
1992.91-790,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3091.367,3092.289,Are Federal funds--
1992.91-790,2,42506,tambra_p_colston,,3096.708,3098.489,"Yes, sir, they are."
1992.91-790,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3238.026,3238.729,You have to look out.
1992.91-790,2,42506,tambra_p_colston,,3240.76,3241.305,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1992.91-790,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3331.958,3337.207,I guess it's a little unfair to say that lookout is inconsistent with the speed limit.
1992.91-790,2,42506,tambra_p_colston,,3346.485,3349.639,"Well, Your Honor, under their interpretation, they say that they don't."
1992.91-790,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3360.01,3363.649,I hope you slow down in residential areas when you're driving a car--
1992.91-790,2,42506,tambra_p_colston,,3363.649,3364.368,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1992.91-790,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3364.368,3367.631,--and it says 30 miles or 25 miles and you see a pedestrian.
1992.91-790,2,42506,tambra_p_colston,,3368.818,3369.521,"Yes, Your Honor, and--"
1992.91-790,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3369.521,3372.926,But you'd say what's the maximum speed.
1992.91-790,2,42506,tambra_p_colston,,3376.269,3377.815,"--Right, but--"
1992.91-790,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3377.815,3378.924,That's all they're saying here I guess.
1992.91-790,2,42506,tambra_p_colston,,3378.924,3384.531,"--That is all they're saying, but what we're doing with the railroad is no more than we're doing with a truck driver on I-75."
1992.91-790,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3394.979,3399.01,"Maybe I don't understand the speed issue, but... your answer."
1992.91-790,2,42506,tambra_p_colston,,3402.681,3407.177,"It is, and now they're saying in their reply brief that they have the duty to slow down."
1992.91-790,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3419.002,3427.577,I suppose it's the difference between when you're on an interstate highway that has a posted speed limit of 55 and there's a major curve.
1992.91-790,2,42506,tambra_p_colston,,3434.137,3434.762,--Right.
1992.91-790,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3434.762,3440.775,"But you would be negligent if there were, you know, somebody fallen down in the road and you continued at that same speed."
1992.91-790,2,42506,tambra_p_colston,,3440.775,3441.29,Or--
1992.91-790,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3441.29,3441.836,That's all they're saying--
1992.91-790,2,42506,tambra_p_colston,,3441.836,3442.648,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1992.91-790,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3442.648,3447.537,--that the normal track conditions allow them to continue to go at whatever that speed is.
1992.91-790,2,42506,tambra_p_colston,,3447.537,3448.13,That's right.
1992.91-790,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3448.13,3450.692,"And if they see an obstruction, of course, they have the duty to slow."
1992.91-790,2,42506,tambra_p_colston,,3450.692,3473.653,"And if they knew... by that same reasoning, if they knew that there was a little path there because it was a national park and pedestrians, people, frequently and bicyclers frequently went over the tracks there to go into the other part of the national park, would they then not have a duty to know that that hazard is up there and that it's very likely that an accident could occur because the conditions are so bad and not slow down."
1992.91-790,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3481.726,3484.694,"Thank you, Mrs. Colston."
1992.91-790,3,28253,howard_j_trienens,,3486.411,3490.348,I'd like to devote that entirely to the confusion on Federal funding.
