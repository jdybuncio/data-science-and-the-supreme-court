1979.78-1557,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,33.746,We will hear arguments next in Nachman Corporation v. Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation.
1979.78-1557,0,39361,robert_w_gettleman,,33.746,35.49,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1979.78-1557,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,182.659,192.594,Do you equate that statutory language legally enforceable to mean legally collectable?
1979.78-1557,0,39361,robert_w_gettleman,,192.594,225.621,"Under the facts of this case, I think that they are synonymous because the rights under the particular plan that Nachman had with its employees were not enforceable or collectable because of the various provisions of the plan which made -- which precluded further employer liability, which allocated benefits on termination in a particular type of order, and benefits that are at issue in this litigation, Mr. Chief Justice, are those benefits which were not funded."
1979.78-1557,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,297.835,316.335,"Mr. Gettleman, is it your position that after January 1, 1976, an employer and a union could not negotiate a plan in which disclaimed personal liability on the part of the employer --"
1979.78-1557,0,39361,robert_w_gettleman,,316.335,317.948,"Basically, yes."
1979.78-1557,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,333.02,340.738,But how about a specific disclaimer of liability on the part of the employer as opposed to the plan?
1979.78-1557,0,39361,robert_w_gettleman,,340.738,342.685,"No, that would not have been, that would not have been allowed."
1979.78-1557,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,342.685,345.635,"You say after January 1, 1976, that is not permissible?"
1979.78-1557,0,39361,robert_w_gettleman,,345.635,348.266,"That is not permitted, that's right."
1979.78-1557,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,539.788,547.154,"Well, those two are the same, to say we disclaim any personal liability and to say you couldn't look any further than the assets in the plan."
1979.78-1557,0,39361,robert_w_gettleman,,549.158,553.371,"I think it goes a little further than just saying that, than just saying we disclaim any more liability."
1979.78-1557,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,621.082,626.434,"Mr. Gettleman, could I ask you a question while you are going through the plan here because it may bear on what you are saying."
1979.78-1557,0,39361,robert_w_gettleman,,645.785,649.914,"To answer the question directly, yes, but the plan would have been amended in 1976."
1979.78-1557,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,649.914,651.121,The statute would have required it?
1979.78-1557,0,39361,robert_w_gettleman,,651.121,655.891,"Yes, because at that time all plans were required to provide a non-forfeiture benefit."
1979.78-1557,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,664.777,676.982,"And they would have been amended out whether the collective bargaining agreement provided for such amendment or not, wouldn't they, simply by force of Congress' action?"
1979.78-1557,0,39361,robert_w_gettleman,,676.982,678.118,That's right.
1979.78-1557,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,742.239,752.884,"So you would be making your same argument between two plans if one is terminated the day before the deadline and one is terminated the day after, but things are just different?"
1979.78-1557,0,39361,robert_w_gettleman,,752.884,755.652,"That's right, and that is exactly what Congress intended."
1979.78-1557,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,757.406,760.469,Even though the relative burden on the company is exactly the same?
1979.78-1557,0,39361,robert_w_gettleman,,760.469,766.475,But the company had the opportunity to adjust to the new requirements.
1979.78-1557,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,766.475,768.282,You only had a day.
1979.78-1557,0,39361,robert_w_gettleman,,768.282,768.71,"No, no."
1979.78-1557,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,794.523,797.878,"And when did this plan expire, during the grace period?"
1979.78-1557,0,39361,robert_w_gettleman,,797.878,799.487,Yes.
1979.78-1557,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,799.487,806.415,So you are still saying there is a difference between the day before the grace period is over and the day after?
1979.78-1557,0,39361,robert_w_gettleman,,806.415,806.667,Yes.
1979.78-1557,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1191.098,1195.675,"Mr. Gettleman, do you suppose when I wrote that footnote I contemplated the issue that is before us now?"
1979.78-1557,0,39361,robert_w_gettleman,,1195.675,1202.653,"No, Your Honor, but you recognize the congressional intent that we rely upon in this case."
1979.78-1557,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1202.971,1208.151,"That wasn't the proposition, that there are staggered dates in ERISA, of course there are a lot of other staggered dates in ERISA."
1979.78-1557,0,39361,robert_w_gettleman,,1208.151,1211.138,"That's right, but that is precisely the point."
1979.78-1557,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1216.533,1221.394,"They did make one thing effective immediately, Mr. Gettleman, and that is the insurance program."
1979.78-1557,0,39361,robert_w_gettleman,,1221.394,1222.093,Yes.
1979.78-1557,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1222.093,1226.246,What does that insure during the period prior to the date of your termination of the plan?
1979.78-1557,0,39361,robert_w_gettleman,,1226.246,1234.071,"It insures by definition the same thing it insures after that date, non-forfeitable benefits under the terms of the plan."
1979.78-1557,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1234.071,1242.39,Is the purpose just to insure against the possibility that the money contributed to the fund will have been dissipated or stolen by the trustees?
1979.78-1557,0,39361,robert_w_gettleman,,1242.39,1260.1,"No, most funds, you must assume -- and I think it is true -- are operated honestly and the reason that there was insufficient funding was because of this past service liability, the contributions for the years before the establishment of a plan were substantial."
1979.78-1557,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1260.1,1264.608,You are not talking about the risk of dissipation of funds or maybe poor investments.
1979.78-1557,0,39361,robert_w_gettleman,,1266.952,1267.497,Okay.
1979.78-1557,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1351.632,1359.849,"Let me ask one other question, if I may, on the plans that were terminated during the interval before the date here and after the enactment of the act."
1979.78-1557,0,39361,robert_w_gettleman,,1363.73,1364.11,Yes.
1979.78-1557,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1364.11,1369.819,Did they also have provisions in them that the employer was liable for the full amount of the benefits --
1979.78-1557,0,39361,robert_w_gettleman,,1369.819,1372.944,They did not limit the employer's liability.
1979.78-1557,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1372.944,1375.747,"Then if that were true, I still don't see why you needed insurance, because --"
1979.78-1557,0,39361,robert_w_gettleman,,1375.747,1378.945,Because they terminated with insufficient assets.
1979.78-1557,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1379.411,1382.522,"If they terminated, wouldn't there be liability on the part of the employer?"
1979.78-1557,0,39361,robert_w_gettleman,,1382.522,1388.696,"There would but the employer, one, could be insolvent; two, there was a 30 percent limitation --"
1979.78-1557,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1388.696,1396.954,The risk being insured against was the insolvency of employers whose plans would terminate when there would be an obligation to pay the full amount of the benefits?
1979.78-1557,0,39361,robert_w_gettleman,,1396.954,1400.233,"More than just that, Your Honor."
1979.78-1557,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1457.206,1465.568,"Let me ask you one other -- maybe I -- I don't mean to be unfair, but there is reference in the legislative history to the termination of the Studebaker plan in South Bend, I think."
1979.78-1557,0,39361,robert_w_gettleman,,1465.568,1465.795,Yes.
1979.78-1557,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1465.795,1468.911,I think there is some evidence of intent that that situation have been covered.
1979.78-1557,0,39361,robert_w_gettleman,,1472.266,1473.831,I have never read the Studebaker plan.
1979.78-1557,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1476.714,1478.664,"That was a case of insolvency of the employer, I think."
1979.78-1557,0,39361,robert_w_gettleman,,1478.664,1479.805,I don't believe so.
1979.78-1557,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1503.55,1507.064,"Well, why are unions so critical in your analysis?"
1979.78-1557,0,39361,robert_w_gettleman,,1518.971,1519.517,Certainly.
1979.78-1557,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1625.802,1630.222,"Well, there is no impairment of contract clause applicable against the federal government, is there?"
1979.78-1557,0,39361,robert_w_gettleman,,1630.222,1637.111,"No, but there would be a very analogous due process argument, Justice Rehnquist, which we did raise in the lower courts."
1979.78-1557,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1662.321,1663.867,Mr. Rose.
1979.78-1557,1,27907,henry_rose,,1663.867,1667.836,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1979.78-1557,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1747.775,1759.335,"Mr. Rose, what is PBGC's position as to whether after January 1, 1976 there could be a disclaimer of personal liability on the part of the employer?"
1979.78-1557,1,27907,henry_rose,,1759.335,1762.375,There is no question that there could be such a disclaimer.
1979.78-1557,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1767.493,1769.335,So you disagree with your opponent on that?
1979.78-1557,1,27907,henry_rose,,1769.335,1773.521,"Yes, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, I certainly do."
1979.78-1557,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1812.003,1816.845,"It is less severe, you said, and it is less severe only by reason of that 30 percent limitation?"
1979.78-1557,1,27907,henry_rose,,1816.845,1817.996,"No, there are other reasons."
1979.78-1557,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1830.264,1831.585,Is that applicable here?
1979.78-1557,1,27907,henry_rose,,1831.585,1832.173,"No, it is not."
1979.78-1557,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1834.205,1837.918,"And the 30 percent allocation doesn't come into play here, does it?"
1979.78-1557,1,27907,henry_rose,,1837.918,1839.296,Not as far as I know.
1979.78-1557,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1840.306,1842.951,So in this case it is neither more nor less severe.
1979.78-1557,1,27907,henry_rose,,1842.951,1845.908,"As far as I know, that is true, yes."
1979.78-1557,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2054.431,2057.62,So that is apart from the reasoning of the Seventh Circuit at that point?
1979.78-1557,1,27907,henry_rose,,2057.62,2060.992,"To this extent, yes, sir."
1979.78-1557,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2069.408,2073.257,Although it doesn't affect your client.
1979.78-1557,1,27907,henry_rose,,2073.257,2073.679,"I'm sorry, sir?"
1979.78-1557,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2073.679,2076.693,Although it doesn't make any difference in this case which approach you --
1979.78-1557,1,27907,henry_rose,,2076.693,2083.356,"That's correct, it does not make a difference in this case, but we are construing a statute that has to be applied to 80,000 other plans."
1979.78-1557,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2083.356,2089.085,I understand but as applied to this one it will reach the same result with either approach.
1979.78-1557,1,27907,henry_rose,,2089.085,2092.634,That is correct.
1979.78-1557,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2116.015,2121.751,"Do you think that Congress used the terms ""vested"" and ""non-forfeitable"" interchangeably throughout the Act?"
1979.78-1557,1,27907,henry_rose,,2121.751,2124.393,"Yes, I think that is clear, Justice Rehnquist."
1979.78-1557,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2346.485,2353.55,"Mr. Rose, your opponent said about half the plans terminated during this period did not have such clauses."
1979.78-1557,1,27907,henry_rose,,2354.718,2355.623,"Yes, sir."
1979.78-1557,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2355.623,2358.667,How do we resolve this?
1979.78-1557,1,27907,henry_rose,,2361.346,2387.332,"The fact of the matter is there was an affidavit filed to the effect that 78 out of 136 plans had limitation of liability clauses like the one in the petitioner's plan, but that does not mean that, as the petitioner would have it, that the other plans did not have other language which was just as effective and accomplished the same purpose."
1979.78-1557,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2388.522,2391.128,Why would you file that affidavit?
1979.78-1557,1,27907,henry_rose,,2391.128,2406.574,"Well, at that time, Justice Rehnquist, we thought it was enough to show that a majority of the plans had practically identical language, but the fact of the matter is that practically all plans have similar language with the same legal effect."
1979.78-1557,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2640.378,2642.305,"Mr. Rose, let me just clarify one thing in my mind."
1979.78-1557,1,27907,henry_rose,,2658.141,2659.086,No.
1979.78-1557,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2662.468,2667.863,"I understand, but would they have been required to make any change in the plan?"
1979.78-1557,1,27907,henry_rose,,2667.863,2673.962,All plans were required to amend themselves to comply with Titles I and II.
1979.78-1557,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2699.45,2702.173,I see.
1979.78-1557,1,27907,henry_rose,,2702.173,2704.824,Reference has been made to statutory subjugation.
1979.78-1557,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2775.428,2777.042,Mr. Whitman.
1979.78-1557,2,36897,m_jay_whitman,,2777.042,2781.902,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1979.78-1557,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3207.986,3210.926,"I'm sorry, could I ask you one question."
1979.78-1557,2,36897,m_jay_whitman,,3227.417,3228.472,By the beneficiary.
1979.78-1557,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3228.472,3231.662,But the beneficiary may collect from PBGC or whatever the name of it is --
1979.78-1557,2,36897,m_jay_whitman,,3231.662,3231.769,"PBGC, right."
1979.78-1557,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3231.769,3234.553,-- who in turn may collect from the company.
1979.78-1557,2,36897,m_jay_whitman,,3234.553,3235.901,"Excuse me, Your Honor."
1979.78-1557,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3245.01,3246.108,I understand.
1979.78-1557,2,36897,m_jay_whitman,,3259.913,3261.643,I can illustrate with a simple example.
1979.78-1557,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3284.756,3291.447,"In other words, the insurance isn't for the full amount of the non-forfeitable benefit, it is only for the amount that the statute prescribes that it must be."
1979.78-1557,2,36897,m_jay_whitman,,3291.447,3297.226,"That's right, which in many cases is substantially less because PBGC doesn't guarantee the full sum."
1979.78-1557,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3297.226,3300.762,Is there any difference between the benefit level and the statutory mandated level?
1979.78-1557,2,36897,m_jay_whitman,,3300.762,3305.28,"In this situation, Your Honor, the benefit levels in the plan were very low."
1979.78-1557,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3316.586,3317.916,So there are two differences then.
1979.78-1557,2,36897,m_jay_whitman,,3324.45,3324.751,Yes.
1979.78-1557,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3324.751,3326.827,And the guarantee is different than the plan level.
1979.78-1557,2,36897,m_jay_whitman,,3326.827,3327.223,Yes.
1979.78-1557,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3327.223,3328.145,I understand that.
1979.78-1557,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3328.145,3349.831,"Mr. Whitman, if the company disclaims liability in its agreements with the employees as to the company itself, you say that Title IV nonetheless entitles PBGC to come after the company under the circumstances specified by Justice Stevens?"
1979.78-1557,2,36897,m_jay_whitman,,3349.831,3358.752,"No, the limitation of liability clause in the plan would prevent PBGC from pursuing the company on its own assets."
1979.78-1557,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3384.92,3385.28,Okay.
1979.78-1557,2,36897,m_jay_whitman,,3408.728,3415.241,If today for some reason that I can't imagine General Motors would --
