1981.81-150,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,1.004,"Thank you, gentlemen."
1981.81-150,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,79.594,83.294,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1981.81-150,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,149.167,152.051,Wasn't this on the phased in basis?
1981.81-150,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,152.051,152.924,That is correct.
1981.81-150,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,160.86,162.289,In 1984 (Voice Overlap) --
1981.81-150,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,162.289,163.731,"That is correct, Mr. Chief Justice."
1981.81-150,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,205.554,217.92,"Are you saying, General, that any time Congress has granted a specific authority to legislate, it has the authority to create a special system of courts then?"
1981.81-150,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,217.92,219.156,Certainly not.
1981.81-150,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,219.156,221.155,Then how do you distinguish?
1981.81-150,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,221.155,235.114,"On the basis of the guidelines that this Court laid down in Palmore which were -- but you have to have, first of all, of course, you have to have one of the specific grant of legislative authority to Congress."
1981.81-150,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,249.281,250.158,Can I stop you there?
1981.81-150,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,250.158,250.525,Surely.
1981.81-150,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,250.525,262.81,"When you say a specialized area, do you mean an area where the judges in filling the courts will have a specialized competence in a particular branch of law?"
1981.81-150,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,262.81,266.754,"As -- my answer to that is, “Yes”, Justice Rehnquist."
1981.81-150,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,280.366,290.603,But then it seems that you will have real trouble with this statute because the jurisdiction vested in the bankruptcy judges just covers the gamut of cases.
1981.81-150,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,290.603,299.345,And that is one of the major criticisms that was raised against it by our opponents.My answer to that is twofold.
1981.81-150,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,321.94,329.386,Is -- is there a severability clause in the acts that would several the non-bankruptcy matters from the bankruptcy?
1981.81-150,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,329.386,339.745,"I am not aware of the severability clause, Your Honor, but of course this Court has clarified on me occasions that -- that that is not dispositive and in effect that the Court will interpret in such a way as to say rather than to --"
1981.81-150,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,339.745,353.963,"Well for -- for example, if the habeas corpus jurisdiction were appealed to -- was respect to a bankruptcy judge."
1981.81-150,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,373.817,393.627,I would think clearly so and I would think also that there are other means available ultimately to this Court and indeed short of this Court that would be less severe such as the doctrine of abstention is applicable in the case of the bankruptcy courts.
1981.81-150,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,547.212,558.734,"Well taking this very case for a moment, before the statute was passed, could the bankruptcy referee have entered a binding judgment in this particular dispute?"
1981.81-150,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,558.734,560.66,"Oh, only if the parties consented."
1981.81-150,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,560.66,563.384,And if they did not consent they could not?
1981.81-150,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,563.384,564.357,That is correct.
1981.81-150,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,564.357,575.711,And is it clear that the non-Article III judge does have the -- you don't have any problem with him entering a binding judgment in a matter depending on state law between private parties?
1981.81-150,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,575.711,576.958,That is our position.
1981.81-150,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,577.665,580.318,Is -- is there any precedent for that at all?
1981.81-150,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,580.318,591.002,"Well, there is the precedent in the MacDonald versus Plymouth and Schumacher versus Beeler cases that that could be done by consent."
1981.81-150,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,695.428,703.35,"Do you think a special area language, generally might refer to a geographical area rather than --"
1981.81-150,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,703.35,704.669,No.
1981.81-150,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,771.723,787.471,"Could Congress, Mr. Solicitor General, have made the administration of bankruptcy problems totally and wholly administrative with traditional -- judicial review?"
1981.81-150,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,787.471,788.05,My answer to that question --
1981.81-150,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,788.05,791.47,Without having any judges at all in the bankruptcy area?
1981.81-150,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,791.47,794.034,"My answer to that question is, “Yes, Congress could have done that.”"
1981.81-150,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,795.836,799.803,You mean even resolving the dispute in this case?
1981.81-150,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,799.803,802.696,"Oh, I don't know -- well, I think that's why it would have been ineffective."
1981.81-150,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,804.839,806.992,"Then your answer to the Chief Justice is, “No”."
1981.81-150,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,806.992,810.191,"Well, they could not have -- I don't know."
1981.81-150,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,817.307,820.531,What's your present answer to the Chief Justice's question?
1981.81-150,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,820.531,842.978,"Well, my answer is that Congress could have solved this problem by relegating whatever power it could constitutionally have given to administrative agencies but I do not think it could have given -- I don't think it could constitutionally have given to administrative entities the power to do the kinds of things that these judges have the power to do."
1981.81-150,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,842.978,844.824,"Right, and then what, what is it?"
1981.81-150,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,844.824,849.49,"Well, entertain the suit in -- in this case."
1981.81-150,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,944.301,953.025,"Yes, but then when you graft onto that, the jurisdiction over this wide range of other cases is where you get into the problem."
1981.81-150,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,960.939,961.474,There are some who have suggested that.
1981.81-150,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,961.474,963.751,-- (Voice Overlap) virtually to limit.
1981.81-150,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,963.751,965.826,There are some rule have suggested that.
1981.81-150,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1049.733,1056.916,Well one distinction between this and Palmore is that Palmore dealt with an area of 67 square miles and this covers the whole country.
1981.81-150,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1056.916,1057.865,That is correct.
1981.81-150,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1063.338,1066.347,But I think Palmore is more like Canter in that respect.
1981.81-150,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1066.347,1066.977,That is correct.
1981.81-150,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1078.005,1079.267,Mr. Devney.
1981.81-150,1,29914,john_l_devney,,1079.267,1080.631,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1981.81-150,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1161.105,1163.376,We have -- we have a lot of (Inaudible) --
1981.81-150,1,29914,john_l_devney,,1163.376,1166.126,I think that there is.
1981.81-150,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1217.507,1226.244,"Do you think Congress proceeded on this basis on an Article III basis, I mean on the -- on the legislative court basis?"
1981.81-150,1,29914,john_l_devney,,1226.244,1227.563,"Yes, I do."
1981.81-150,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1227.563,1228.203,Yes.
1981.81-150,1,29914,john_l_devney,,1228.346,1229.269,I do because the --
1981.81-150,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1229.269,1230.663,You said both Houses did?
1981.81-150,1,29914,john_l_devney,,1230.663,1231.139,Pardon me?
1981.81-150,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1231.139,1233.492,You think both Houses did?
1981.81-150,1,29914,john_l_devney,,1233.492,1237.715,"Well, in both Houses were aware of the distinction."
1981.81-150,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1237.715,1248.023,But you don't -- you don't think they were -- thought they were approaching it on an Article III basis was these -- these kinds of judges as being an adjunct to the District Court?
1981.81-150,1,29914,john_l_devney,,1248.023,1251.401,"Well, that's -- that's obviously what their statute said."
1981.81-150,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1263.451,1269.215,"Well, so they purported to create an Article III -- Article III courts, is that right?"
1981.81-150,1,29914,john_l_devney,,1269.215,1269.97,No.
1981.81-150,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1271.666,1273.68,Article III officers or?
1981.81-150,1,29914,john_l_devney,,1273.68,1283.957,They -- they deposited jurisdiction initially in an Article III court and then automatically delegated -- delegated it to an Article I court.
1981.81-150,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1284.885,1287.222,"Well, do you think they thought that's what they were doing?"
1981.81-150,1,29914,john_l_devney,,1287.222,1291.654,"I sure do, I think that's what the statute very plainly says."
1981.81-150,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1291.654,1297.224,"The statute was originally drafted with the Article III courts in mind, was it not?"
1981.81-150,1,29914,john_l_devney,,1297.224,1301.532,"In the House of Representative as -- I think that's true, Your Honor."
1981.81-150,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1460.534,1467.182,(Inaudible) it would be something improper about the Court of Military Appeals upholding a death sentence if Congress had authorized it?
1981.81-150,1,29914,john_l_devney,,1467.182,1470.434,"No, not at all, but they're Article I judges."
1981.81-150,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1470.434,1471.66,So what?
1981.81-150,1,29914,john_l_devney,,1471.66,1478.629,"My point is, is that that is not the distinction between Article I and Article III."
1981.81-150,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1491.917,1494.934,"Couldn't you broaden that, the gravity of the problem?"
1981.81-150,1,29914,john_l_devney,,1494.934,1498.925,"Or perhaps -- perhaps so, sir."
1981.81-150,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1576.5,1588.164,"Well, Mr. Devney, do you think we can decide this case by saying, “Yes, Congress could authorize the bankruptcy court to decide a contract case and will wait until the next case to decide whether that (Inaudible) tort case or not?”"
1981.81-150,1,29914,john_l_devney,,1588.164,1588.353,No.
1981.81-150,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1591.882,1594.826,We -- we have to have some fairly generalized principle of it?
1981.81-150,1,29914,john_l_devney,,1594.826,1602.096,"Well, I think you -- the generalized principle is that this is a validly constituted Article I court."
1981.81-150,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1602.096,1609.465,"And it can decide contract, tort, antitrust, and a number of other things that might “pertain to” the bankruptcy."
1981.81-150,1,29914,john_l_devney,,1609.465,1613.46,Sure it can but only if there's a bankruptcy.
1981.81-150,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1616.843,1620.729,"Well, what about -- by bankruptcy you would include a chapter 11 reorganization?"
1981.81-150,1,29914,john_l_devney,,1620.729,1621.653,"Oh yes, sir."
1981.81-150,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1622.138,1627.066,"And I suppose you could broaden the definition of the reorganization to include quite a variety of things, couldn't you?"
1981.81-150,1,29914,john_l_devney,,1627.066,1641.304,"Well, you might be able to and I -- I think what we're talking about is jurisdiction under Title 11, yes, sir."
1981.81-150,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1646.488,1654.086,Mr. Orenstein.
1981.81-150,2,36439,melvin_i_orenstein,,1654.086,1657.587,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1981.81-150,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1669.679,1671.875,"Could you raise your voice a little bit, Mr. Orenstein?"
1981.81-150,2,36439,melvin_i_orenstein,,1671.875,1672.392,Yes.
1981.81-150,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1703.325,1709.657,How does that compare with the situation of the Court of Military Appeals?
1981.81-150,2,36439,melvin_i_orenstein,,1709.657,1724.965,"Your Honor, I believe that the Court of Military Appeals is based upon a principle that the Commander in Chief has a power to discipline his forces."
1981.81-150,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1725.112,1736.61,(Voice Overlap) -- wasn't the court created as -- as a civilian court in effect as a check or a second look at the military decisions?
1981.81-150,2,36439,melvin_i_orenstein,,1736.61,1738.469,"That may be, but Your Honor in the --"
1981.81-150,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1738.469,1739.709,Don't you think it is?
1981.81-150,2,36439,melvin_i_orenstein,,1739.709,1740.963,The Military Court of Appeals?
1981.81-150,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1740.963,1741.587,Yes.
1981.81-150,2,36439,melvin_i_orenstein,,1741.587,1742.162,Yes.
1981.81-150,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1742.162,1743.4,That was the purpose of it.
1981.81-150,2,36439,melvin_i_orenstein,,1743.4,1744.334,Yes.
1981.81-150,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1843.261,1858.484,"You mean that -- you mean they could -- you could have a special -- an Article I court to decide every case arising under one of the bill of rights, one of the amendments, one of the first 10 amendments?"
1981.81-150,2,36439,melvin_i_orenstein,,1863.471,1863.655,Yes.
1981.81-150,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1863.655,1872.557,"That wouldn't involve separation of powers between, necessarily between in the Federal Government or wouldn't involve any questions of federalism?"
1981.81-150,2,36439,melvin_i_orenstein,,1872.557,1880.919,"Well, I think that anytime that you have state created rights in any sense that once you create -- once you --"
1981.81-150,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1880.919,1897.473,"Well, what about -- what about the -- the First Amendment only applied for a long time when they applied it to the Federal Government and suppose there were some act of Congress that was attacked as violative of the First Amendment but we have a special Article I court decide that case?"
1981.81-150,2,36439,melvin_i_orenstein,,1897.473,1898.52,I don't think so.
1981.81-150,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1898.76,1899.204,Why not?
1981.81-150,2,36439,melvin_i_orenstein,,1899.204,1900.966,-- because I think that that --
1981.81-150,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1900.966,1904.638,"That isn't a separation of powers question, is it?"
1981.81-150,2,36439,melvin_i_orenstein,,1904.638,1907.158,"Well, on the other hand Your Honor if --"
1981.81-150,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1907.158,1909.246,"Certainly, it's just a federalism question."
1981.81-150,2,36439,melvin_i_orenstein,,1909.246,1914.575,"No, but I think that -- what that would lead to would be a position that Congress could establish."
1981.81-150,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1924.476,1943.846,"Could you -- could you tell me -- just summarize, what kind of matters did you say these -- new bankruptcy judges may decide that are beyond the control of any higher Court of the District Court or of the Court of Appeals?"
1981.81-150,2,36439,melvin_i_orenstein,,1943.846,1952.317,"Your Honor, it seems to me that we're talking about the kinds of cases that prior to the Bankruptcy Reform Act could not have been brought in the State or the Article III District Courts."
1981.81-150,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1952.317,1964.882,"Oh, I understand that but they are now -- can be -- but what matters are finely decided in the new bankruptcy courts that are not subject to control by the District Court or by the Court of Appeals?"
1981.81-150,2,36439,melvin_i_orenstein,,1964.882,1966.477,On the appeal process you mean?
1981.81-150,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1966.477,1966.552,Yes.
1981.81-150,2,36439,melvin_i_orenstein,,1966.552,1967.487,To the appeal process.
1981.81-150,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1967.487,1975.542,"Well, you just said that your fundamental objection was that these courts can now finally decide things that Article III judges have no control over?"
1981.81-150,2,36439,melvin_i_orenstein,,1975.542,1975.979,Yes.
1981.81-150,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2006.299,2010.52,What is the standard of review on facts?
1981.81-150,2,36439,melvin_i_orenstein,,2011.823,2012.088,Yes.
1981.81-150,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2012.088,2012.255,I take it --
1981.81-150,2,36439,melvin_i_orenstein,,2012.255,2012.462,Under --
1981.81-150,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2012.462,2012.568,"-- it is, isn't it?"
1981.81-150,2,36439,melvin_i_orenstein,,2012.568,2014.423,"Yes, under Rule 810 of the bankruptcy --"
1981.81-150,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2014.423,2020.873,"And so that Article -- no Article III judges on review can upset factfindings unless they're clearly erroneous, is that right?"
1981.81-150,2,36439,melvin_i_orenstein,,2020.873,2022.368,"Yes, that's right."
1981.81-150,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2022.601,2028.233,But I suppose all questions of law are subject to being reviewed.
1981.81-150,2,36439,melvin_i_orenstein,,2028.233,2030.736,"Questions of law would be subject to review, that's correct."
1981.81-150,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2070.516,2072.031,"Well, isn't the --"
1981.81-150,2,36439,melvin_i_orenstein,,2072.031,2072.639,-- in United States against Raddatz.
1981.81-150,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2072.639,2074.612,"Mr. Orenstein, isn't there another consideration?"
1981.81-150,2,36439,melvin_i_orenstein,,2087.452,2087.972,That's right.
1981.81-150,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2139.272,2150.038,Aren't you now addressing the wisdom of the statute of differing the time when an Article III court can review rather than the constitutionality.
1981.81-150,2,36439,melvin_i_orenstein,,2150.038,2151.174,"No, no Your Honor."
1981.81-150,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2151.174,2156.249,"Just because it's inconvenient, doesn't make something unconstitutional."
1981.81-150,2,36439,melvin_i_orenstein,,2156.249,2159.655,"All right, I think that's probably true."
1981.81-150,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2159.655,2160.175,Probably?
1981.81-150,2,36439,melvin_i_orenstein,,2160.175,2162.295,"Yes, okay that's true."
1981.81-150,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2181.651,2188.305,You're saying but because it's convenient doesn't make it constitutional?
1981.81-150,2,36439,melvin_i_orenstein,,2188.305,2188.863,That's right.
1981.81-150,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2190.068,2200.024,"Counsel on the other hand, the -- an Article III judges aren't around looking for business, in case you don't know that."
1981.81-150,2,36439,melvin_i_orenstein,,2200.024,2205.693,"Your Honor, I think wanted to be clearer on something."
1981.81-150,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2253.918,2258.231,Well you say that you are not attacking all of it.
1981.81-150,2,36439,melvin_i_orenstein,,2298.111,2315.966,"Well, as I have indicated Your Honor, I think that it's not -- I mean, it's not a question of convenience in my judgment to assert that the appeal process satisfies the control of relationships which have to exist between an Article III court and its delegate."
1981.81-150,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2353.902,2359.399,"Mr. Orenstein, how do you distinguish the case of the magistrates that we were concerned with in Raddatz?"
1981.81-150,2,36439,melvin_i_orenstein,,2359.399,2360.59,I really don't distinguish it.
1981.81-150,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2421.552,2423.728,Do these judges empanel a jury?
1981.81-150,2,36439,melvin_i_orenstein,,2423.728,2425.232,Yes sir.
1981.81-150,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2427.613,2429.195,"Well, so can the magistrates."
1981.81-150,2,36439,melvin_i_orenstein,,2429.195,2429.633,Pardon?
1981.81-150,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2429.633,2430.397,So can the magistrates.
1981.81-150,2,36439,melvin_i_orenstein,,2430.397,2432.821,"Yes, but by consent as I understand it."
1981.81-150,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2432.982,2440.181,I get -- I get the feeling that you're making a beautiful argument for Congress but we are not Congress.
1981.81-150,2,36439,melvin_i_orenstein,,2452.389,2452.968,"Well, Your Honor --"
1981.81-150,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2452.968,2454.83,Assuming it's bad.
1981.81-150,2,36439,melvin_i_orenstein,,2454.83,2455.299,Yes.
1981.81-150,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2455.299,2460.124,Assuming that's the worst we are doing it.
1981.81-150,2,36439,melvin_i_orenstein,,2461.754,2462.313,Yes.
1981.81-150,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2463.15,2471.209,And I -- you haven't said anything to me to convince me that it's not constitutional for Congress to do this.
1981.81-150,2,36439,melvin_i_orenstein,,2471.209,2473.622,"Well, Your Honor --"
1981.81-150,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2473.622,2481.906,"Congress is the one who make the determination as to whether it should be in Article I or an Article III court, that's Congress' job."
1981.81-150,2,36439,melvin_i_orenstein,,2481.906,2483.018,Okay.
1981.81-150,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2495.502,2497.427,"Well, what do you want us to do?"
1981.81-150,2,36439,melvin_i_orenstein,,2498.957,2499.957,"No, I don't."
1981.81-150,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2505.603,2508.167,Well that's Congress's point.
1981.81-150,2,36439,melvin_i_orenstein,,2508.167,2509.727,"Well, I don't think --"
1981.81-150,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2509.727,2512.168,Congress -- you said jurisdiction.
1981.81-150,2,36439,melvin_i_orenstein,,2512.168,2512.711,"Yes, but Your Honor --"
1981.81-150,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2512.711,2517.585,Congress determines the jurisdiction of all federal courts.
1981.81-150,2,36439,melvin_i_orenstein,,2517.585,2527.402,"Your Honor, I don't believe that Congress can create courts to exercise jurisdiction, unless those jurisdictional basis are within the limits of the constitution."
1981.81-150,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2528.093,2528.612,Of course --
1981.81-150,2,36439,melvin_i_orenstein,,2528.612,2536.73,-- there are limits to Congress's abilities to create Courts and to confer jurisdiction upon those courts and this case involves a --
1981.81-150,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2536.73,2550.087,Well couldn't take Congress take all of the jurisdiction of bankruptcy from the Article III courts?
1981.81-150,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2550.186,2551.571,"I suppose that's the issue, isn't it?"
1981.81-150,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2551.571,2554.89,And give it to an Article I court?
1981.81-150,2,36439,melvin_i_orenstein,,2554.89,2556.635,"No, I don't think it could."
1981.81-150,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2556.892,2557.638,Why not?
1981.81-150,2,36439,melvin_i_orenstein,,2557.638,2557.984,Okay.
1981.81-150,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2557.984,2558.551,Why not?
1981.81-150,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2558.551,2561.573,Even when it allows the appellate review by --
1981.81-150,2,36439,melvin_i_orenstein,,2561.573,2562.25,No --
1981.81-150,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2562.25,2564.479,-- by an Article III court?
1981.81-150,2,36439,melvin_i_orenstein,,2564.479,2571.525,"Well, Your Honor, I have already one through that appeal argument and I supposed you may or may not be persuaded or convinced."
1981.81-150,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2583.198,2584.762,"Well, what if you don't call them judges?"
1981.81-150,2,36439,melvin_i_orenstein,,2593.1,2593.216,Well --
1981.81-150,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2593.216,2594.623,-- substantial evidence.
1981.81-150,2,36439,melvin_i_orenstein,,2594.623,2601.927,"Well, but now you're getting into the question of, “Can you create this court as an agency with all of these kinds of powers and with all of the --"
1981.81-150,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2601.927,2608.472,"Well, I know, but it doesn't -- all you're doing -- arguably all you're doing is changing the name on -- on the organization."
1981.81-150,2,36439,melvin_i_orenstein,,2613.826,2614.262,No.
1981.81-150,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2624.297,2636.63,"Well, I -- let me just -- you know what the National Labor Relations Board can do, they can -- they can make determinations of unfair labor practices and give an award in back pay in very, very large amounts."
1981.81-150,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2636.63,2639.346,Is that award got any legal effect until the court enters this?
1981.81-150,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2639.346,2641.051,(Inaudible) by the Court of Appeals?
1981.81-150,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2641.051,2643.861,Or do they have to petition an Article III judge to get it enforced?
1981.81-150,2,36439,melvin_i_orenstein,,2643.861,2645.264,That may be true.
1981.81-150,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2646.216,2656.797,That maybe -- that maybe true but when they petition for enforcement the Article III court has no authority to upset any factfinding that is -- that is supported by substantial evidence.
1981.81-150,2,36439,melvin_i_orenstein,,2661.128,2664.118,But you have a different principle with the NLRB.
1981.81-150,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2668.943,2672.002,"Where did they get that, to mean -- to decide these cases?"
1981.81-150,2,36439,melvin_i_orenstein,,2672.002,2682.27,"This Court has long ago stated that there are certain kinds of factfinding functions which can be delegated to an agency, and that's done on the basis of --"
1981.81-150,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2682.27,2690.764,"Well, what about the -- the kind of -- what's -- what's the matter with delegating pursuant to the bank -- the bankruptcy power, the that of factfinding that is delegated to these bankruptcy judges."
1981.81-150,2,36439,melvin_i_orenstein,,2690.764,2707.157,Because there are certain areas in which this Court has said Congress can make this kind of a delegation and these are areas involving public rights where a sovereign is suing to enforce a particular statute under a federally enacted legislation.
1981.81-150,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2707.916,2713.192,"(Voice Overlap) -- the sovereign isn't suing for anything under the National Labor Relations Board, private parties litigate before it."
1981.81-150,2,36439,melvin_i_orenstein,,2713.192,2718.887,"Okay, then if it's a private party's situation then if it's a private parties situation, then you have to have as this case said in the Crowell case."
1981.81-150,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2728.546,2728.697,And let's (Voice Overlap) a moment here.
1981.81-150,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2728.697,2740.815,"Do you think -- do you think as the -- the sovereign is enforcing its own laws, it can -- it can create anything it wants to -- have the disputes adjudicated by any kind of a --"
1981.81-150,2,36439,melvin_i_orenstein,,2740.815,2741.896,No.
1981.81-150,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2742.606,2743.901,The criminal case.
1981.81-150,2,36439,melvin_i_orenstein,,2743.901,2745.402,"I say, don't think it can."
1981.81-150,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2753.774,2768.958,"Getting back up to one of your earlier responses, it gave me the impression that you thought that the Congress of the United States had to get some leave or approval from the judiciary in order to create the Labor Board or the Federal Communications Commission."
1981.81-150,2,36439,melvin_i_orenstein,,2768.958,2769.175,I didn't mean --
1981.81-150,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2769.175,2776.68,"Congress was exercising its own inherent constitutional powers, was it not, when they created these agencies?"
1981.81-150,2,36439,melvin_i_orenstein,,2776.68,2777.679,When it creates agencies?
1981.81-150,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2778.391,2786.801,"Now, the Federal Communications Committee can give -- a Commission can give or it can take away a broadcast license worth hundreds of millions of dollars --"
1981.81-150,2,36439,melvin_i_orenstein,,2786.801,2788.276,That's correct.
1981.81-150,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2788.276,2810.49,"And that's subject to review by the Court of Appeals in the first instance but as Justice White pointed out the Court of Appeals is at least bound to affirm what the Commission has done, if it's supported by substantial evidence even if they disagree with the result reached."
1981.81-150,2,36439,melvin_i_orenstein,,2811.462,2812.203,I think that's right.
1981.81-150,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2812.203,2814.479,Through the Federal Power Commission.
1981.81-150,2,36439,melvin_i_orenstein,,2814.479,2814.872,Yes.
1981.81-150,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2824.689,2828.326,What is it -- what is it that -- what is that different principle?
1981.81-150,2,36439,melvin_i_orenstein,,2828.326,2831.024,It's a -- it's a doctrine which this Court has announced in the past.
1981.81-150,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2831.024,2846.198,"Suppose you file it before the Interstate Commerce Commission, you want to get reparations from another party, so here's a -- so here's a dispute between a shipper and a carrier and the Court and they -- and reparations are awarded."
1981.81-150,2,36439,melvin_i_orenstein,,2846.198,2846.825,All right.
1981.81-150,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2846.825,2850.156,And a $1 million -- worth a $1 million.
1981.81-150,2,36439,melvin_i_orenstein,,2850.156,2851.106,"Your Honor, I believe that's --"
1981.81-150,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2851.106,2852.464,(Voice Overlap) --
1981.81-150,2,36439,melvin_i_orenstein,,2852.464,2852.647,Yes.
1981.81-150,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2855.487,2856.075,What?
1981.81-150,2,36439,melvin_i_orenstein,,2856.859,2857.69,I -- I understand it's a public --
1981.81-150,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2857.69,2858.677,Under a public statute?
1981.81-150,2,36439,melvin_i_orenstein,,2858.677,2862.666,"Well, a statute which confers a public right upon the individuals."
1981.81-150,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2911.471,2920.468,Suppose that when Congress pass this Act it had called these bankruptcy people bankruptcy magistrates and --
1981.81-150,2,36439,melvin_i_orenstein,,2920.468,2921.599,Okay.
1981.81-150,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2921.599,2922.707,-- what about it?
1981.81-150,2,36439,melvin_i_orenstein,,2926.542,2930.3,The label does not make any difference in my judgment.
1981.81-150,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2997.667,3006.221,Nothing unusual about Congress changing its positions during the course of the evolution of a statutory scheme is there?
1981.81-150,2,36439,melvin_i_orenstein,,3006.221,3006.642,"Oh, no."
1981.81-150,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3006.66,3009.71,"Deciding on one's Act and have amendments, conferences and --"
1981.81-150,2,36439,melvin_i_orenstein,,3009.71,3010.305,Yes.
1981.81-150,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3048.823,3055.025,Can be more final than any of the commissions that Justice White and others have mentioned to you?
1981.81-150,2,36439,melvin_i_orenstein,,3055.025,3055.262,In the --
1981.81-150,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3055.262,3060.184,"That is the -- the Federal Communications, Federal Power, Labor Board, Interstate Commerce."
1981.81-150,2,36439,melvin_i_orenstein,,3060.184,3064.323,They're not anymore final on that sense but they exercise different powers.
1981.81-150,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3071.138,3072.816,That stands the argument on its head.
1981.81-150,2,36439,melvin_i_orenstein,,3083.775,3092.04,"No, I think that gets into a question of what kinds of rights you're entitled to a jury trial in and in -- under the Act which you suggest, I suspect --"
1981.81-150,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3092.04,3093.187,You get a money award.
