1982.81-129,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,10.578,We will hear arguments first this morning in Landon against Plasencia.
1982.81-129,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,15.141,20.783,Thank you.
1982.81-129,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,252.987,257.569,"Mr. Schulder, was the husband charged with any offense?"
1982.81-129,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,257.569,260.602,"No, the husband is a United States citizen."
1982.81-129,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,260.602,263.212,"I know that, but was he charged with any offense?"
1982.81-129,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,263.212,268.076,"No, he was not charged with any offense, Your Honor, as far as I am aware."
1982.81-129,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,274.969,288.6,"Mr. Schulder, is it the government's position that assuming an exclusion proceeding is the proper proceeding, that the alien is entitled to due process at that hearing?"
1982.81-129,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,288.6,289.121,"--Absolutely, yes."
1982.81-129,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,289.121,291.923,"And what process is due, do you think?"
1982.81-129,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,291.923,307.922,"Well, as this Court noted in Kwong Hai Chew versus Colding, that a resident alien returning from a trip abroad is entitled to notice of the charges and an opportunity... and a hearing and an opportunity to respond to those charges."
1982.81-129,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,307.922,315.778,Do you think some specific period of time has to be given in which to prepare for the hearing?
1982.81-129,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,315.778,323.152,"Well, I am not sure that the Constitution mandates a fixed period of time."
1982.81-129,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,332.569,337.051,"Mr. Schulder, Kwong Hai Chew just construed a regulation, didn't it?"
1982.81-129,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,339.662,340.604,"Well, that's correct."
1982.81-129,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,342.975,352.641,"What about the language in Knauff versus Shaughnessy, that whatever the procedure authorized by Congress is, it is due process so far as an alien denied entry is concerned?"
1982.81-129,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,352.641,363.089,"--Well, the Court in Kwong Hai Chew strongly suggested that it would have constitutional problems with the regulation that it construed."
1982.81-129,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,363.089,364.88,But it certainly didn't hold that.
1982.81-129,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,364.88,368.383,It did not go so far as to hold that there was an absolute--
1982.81-129,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,368.383,373.745,You treat that case as though it was a holding.
1982.81-129,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,374.955,376.507,"--Well, the Immigration--"
1982.81-129,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,376.507,377.927,Your practice is now--
1982.81-129,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,377.927,383.901,"--Well, the Immigration Service has accepted that case, and the District of Columbia--"
1982.81-129,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,383.901,385.944,--You mean the implications of the case?
1982.81-129,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,385.944,398.402,"--The implications of the case, and the District of Columbia Circuit's decision in Kwong Hai Chew versus Rogers that an alien, resident alien is entitled to due process--"
1982.81-129,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,398.402,401.823,Do you think the Circuit Court of the District of Columbia can overrule the Knauff case?
1982.81-129,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,401.823,403.415,"--No, Your Honor."
1982.81-129,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,429.842,440.809,"Well, of course, naturally, any procedure contrary to the due process would be struck down under the due process clause, but Knauff says whatever procedure Congress provides is due process."
1982.81-129,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,440.809,445.532,That's correct.
1982.81-129,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,491.823,502.76,"But the Service has not, as I understand it, drafted separate regulations to cover the kind of hearing that is required for a returning permanent resident as opposed to a brand new person."
1982.81-129,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,507.992,509.294,That's correct.
1982.81-129,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,509.294,514.467,So that you don't in your actual rules differentiate between the two kinds of cases?
1982.81-129,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,514.467,522.852,"Well, the regulations themselves do not differentiate, but the Board of Immigration Appeals in its decisions has differentiated between--"
1982.81-129,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,522.852,526.895,"Well, can we tell from its decisions, for example, the answer to Justice O'Connor's question?"
1982.81-129,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,536.823,561.527,"--Well, the only standard that I am specifically aware of, Your Honor, is the Board of Immigration Appeals has said that an alien may be excluded on the basis of charges that are not necessarily included in the formal written notice of the charges received prior to a hearing."
1982.81-129,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,574.267,581.121,"It sounds like there is no requirement of advanced notice in advance of the hearings, if I understand you correctly."
1982.81-129,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,585.674,591.156,--It is not absolutely clear from the record what the notice was.
1982.81-129,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,591.156,597.451,Is there any requirement that the person be advised of any right to be represented by counsel?
1982.81-129,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,597.451,608.888,"Yes, the Immigration Service's regulations provide that the immigration judge must advise the alien of the right to obtain counsel--"
1982.81-129,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,608.888,610.751,How long in advance of the hearing?
1982.81-129,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,610.751,614.051,"--Well, the--"
1982.81-129,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,614.051,616.284,"Right at the outset of the hearing, is what happened here."
1982.81-129,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,616.284,622.379,"--At the outset of the hearing, the alien is so advised, but the notice of charges that is required--"
1982.81-129,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,622.379,625.702,Does that advice include advice as to how to find a lawyer?
1982.81-129,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,625.702,630.303,"--Well, the Service's current regulations provide that the alien is to be informed--"
1982.81-129,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,630.303,631.455,At the time of the hearing here.
1982.81-129,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,631.455,636.677,"--At the time of the hearing here, there was no such provision that the alien be informed of the availability of--"
1982.81-129,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,636.677,642.981,So the hearing as conducted in this case did not comply with the regulations that you now have in effect.
1982.81-129,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,646.264,647.624,--That's correct.
1982.81-129,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,918.321,919.561,May I interrupt once more?
1982.81-129,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,926.727,941.677,"--Yes, we believe that Respondent did receive due process, but we like to point out that Respondent did not really raise the due process issues that she is now raising here in the courts below."
1982.81-129,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,949.592,952.694,The due process point.
1982.81-129,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,952.694,954.834,"That is clearly an argument, yes."
1982.81-129,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,954.834,964.31,"What you really mean is, they got due process on this type of a hearing, but it wouldn't be due process on a deportation hearing."
1982.81-129,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,968.283,969.425,"Well, the deportation--"
1982.81-129,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,969.425,970.505,Is that your position?
1982.81-129,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,970.505,972.047,--I'm not--
1982.81-129,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,972.047,974.608,You have different types of due process?
1982.81-129,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,974.608,978.75,"--There are different types of due process, depending on the--"
1982.81-129,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,978.75,981.423,"Some are a whole lot, and some are a little?"
1982.81-129,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,981.423,993.78,"--Well, our position is that it is not absolutely necessary that the precise procedures that happen to be available in deportation hearings have to be provided in exclusion hearings."
1982.81-129,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,996.103,1006.929,"But as I understand you, you do concede that the process required in the exclusion of a permanent resident alien may be greater than the process required for an alien who is not a permanent alien."
1982.81-129,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,1006.929,1007.44,That's correct.
1982.81-129,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1007.44,1016.775,But you also say that the process given here satisfies your concept of that intermediate level of process that the Constitution requires.
1982.81-129,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,1016.775,1029.224,"That's correct, but the point, the major point that we make here is that even if there was a problem here in terms of the process that was provided, the Ninth Circuit's remedy was totally wrong."
1982.81-129,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1029.224,1033.928,What would the proper... you say the remedy isn't to require a deportation hearing.
1982.81-129,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,1033.928,1034.677,That's correct.
1982.81-129,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1034.677,1036.85,The remedy is to require sort of an intermediate hearing.
1982.81-129,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,1036.85,1037.651,That's correct.
1982.81-129,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1037.651,1044.403,"Now, how should that be done, assuming that we thought you were wrong on the adequacy of the process in this case?"
1982.81-129,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,1059.833,1076.714,"Well, if the Immigration Service is informed of the deficiencies in any of its procedures in exclusion hearings, it should be... it would provide for regulations, I would think."
1982.81-129,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1076.714,1081.069,I thought you said that they should improve the exclusionary hearing.
1982.81-129,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,1081.069,1091.594,"That's correct, but I'm saying that the Service most likely would provide specifically for regulations that would deal with permanent resident aliens in an exclusion setting."
1982.81-129,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1091.594,1093.316,"Well, could we tell them what to do?"
1982.81-129,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,1097.89,1102.592,"Well, the Court conceivably could say that the particular procedures--"
1982.81-129,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1102.592,1104.485,"Conceivably, or could?"
1982.81-129,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,1104.485,1143.97,"--The Court could certainly say that the procedures that were made available here were not adequate, but the point that I was trying to make earlier is that the issue really is not properly presented here, because it hadn't been presented either in the district court or the court of appeals, and that because of the peculiar posture of the case, there is really no basis for relying on this as an alternative ground for affirmance, since the proper remedy if due process was not provided would not be to send the case back for a deportation hearing, but instead to send the case back for an exclusion hearing."
1982.81-129,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1143.97,1153.517,"The case has sort of a peculiar procedural history, because the alien was successful in persuading, I guess, both the magistrate and the district court and the court of appeals that she was entitled to a deportation hearing."
1982.81-129,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,1153.517,1154.258,That's correct.
1982.81-129,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1154.258,1161.283,"So there really wasn't an occasion for her to say, well, in the alternative, if I don't get that, I should at least get something more than I received in this particular case."
1982.81-129,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,1161.283,1165.715,"Well, she certainly had the opportunity to raise that claim in the district court."
1982.81-129,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1165.715,1168.186,Did she raise it?
1982.81-129,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,1168.186,1194.333,"Well, she did argue that she was entitled to the procedural safeguards of the deportation hearing, but what the record actually shows is that she was arguing for an entitlement to entry into the country and being placed in deportation proceedings rather than to the same types of safeguards that happen to be available in the deportation context."
1982.81-129,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1194.333,1223.281,"Well, Mr. Schulder, just to clarify it, as far as the government is concerned, this Court could be asked to simply determine whether she was entitled to a deportation proceeding or an exclusion proceeding, and if it were determined that she were entitled to an exclusion proceeding, just remand it for that without attempting to spell out all of the requirements for that proceeding."
1982.81-129,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,1224.413,1225.564,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1982.81-129,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1350.636,1354.848,May I ask one other question on the meaningful departure exception to the general rule?
1982.81-129,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,1373.481,1378.133,We submit that it is sufficient at the time of returning to the country.
1982.81-129,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1382.917,1388.29,And you would satisfy that clearly here even if... assuming your proof is correct.
1982.81-129,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,1388.29,1388.74,Absolutely.
1982.81-129,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1405.341,1427.995,"On that point, on the gain, the trial examiner, the judge, whatever he was called, on Page 33 of the abstract asked one of the witnesses if it was the witness's understanding that he was going to pay the alien an amount of $200 after he arrived in Los Angeles, and he said yes, he had that understanding, although he didn't indicate whether it was based on conversation with the alien."
1982.81-129,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,1439.923,1452.192,"I'm not exactly aware, but I believe there was a statement... I believe there were statements from the alien witnesses that were admitted."
1982.81-129,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1452.192,1458.506,And would they be things that the trial examiner would look at in an ex parte fashion during a hearing of this kind?
1982.81-129,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,1458.506,1462.16,"Well, these were statements that were, I believe, admitted into evidence."
1982.81-129,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1464.431,1465.762,I see.
1982.81-129,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,1472.413,1477.158,"Well, she was paroled into this country by the district director."
1982.81-129,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1484.121,1492.547,Mr. Manulkin.
1982.81-129,1,25737,gary_h_manulkin,,1492.547,1527.342,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, I would like to begin argument with a little discussion of the manner of the framing of the issues by the court below, by the Petitioner, and by the Respondent, because I think that will tend to simplify, at least for my purposes, further argument, the reasoning behind our argument or behind our briefs, and behind the decision and the rationale of the court below."
1982.81-129,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1549.325,1561.462,"What by the way of notice, for example, would be greater in the deportation proceeding than in the exclusion?"
1982.81-129,1,25737,gary_h_manulkin,,1561.462,1564.314,--In the... I am sorry.
1982.81-129,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1567.566,1568.027,Yes.
1982.81-129,1,25737,gary_h_manulkin,,1574.121,1574.812,Yes.
1982.81-129,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1584.618,1586.48,I am not talking about the number of days.
1982.81-129,1,25737,gary_h_manulkin,,1588.361,1589.332,"Well, the content is different--"
1982.81-129,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1589.332,1592.293,So that she would know what it was she was being charged with.
1982.81-129,1,25737,gary_h_manulkin,,1592.293,1639.565,"--From the record... I was not present at the time of the hearing, but from the record, I can only determine that the notice was written to her a few minutes before the judge proceeded, the immigration judge in this case proceeded with the presentation of the case and allowed the trial attorney to go forward, and from the record again, I only discern that the judge read that you are being charged with aiding and abetting the entry of aliens into the United States for gain, the illegal entry of those aliens, although I will say that the notice itself was a little difficult to read, and I noticed that someone in fact had to make some marks over it to be read."
1982.81-129,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1784.842,1799.34,"Mr. Manulkin, getting back to what the government said, suppose the rule is changed which says simply that at an explusion hearing you have the exact same as the deportation hearing."
1982.81-129,1,25737,gary_h_manulkin,,1802.021,1824.328,"Well, the difficulty that we feel there is with that type of a route would be the preclusion of all of those sections of the Immigration Act that are not regulation but statutory sections, such as a stay of deportation in Section 243(h), which she would very possibly--"
1982.81-129,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1824.328,1826.419,You just want to rewrite the statute.
1982.81-129,1,25737,gary_h_manulkin,,1826.419,1832.292,"--Well, we certainly don't... yes, we certainly don't want to cause a multiplicity of litigation."
1982.81-129,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1832.292,1834.793,"Or rather, you want us to rewrite the statute."
1982.81-129,1,25737,gary_h_manulkin,,1834.793,1838.546,What we are asking the Court to--
1982.81-129,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1838.546,1840.166,"You don't really want us to do that, do you?"
1982.81-129,1,25737,gary_h_manulkin,,1840.166,1840.547,--No.
1982.81-129,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1851.263,1856.539,What more can we do than say that they must give due process?
1982.81-129,1,25737,gary_h_manulkin,,1856.539,1860.36,--I think Chew v. Colding is our answer.
1982.81-129,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1884.785,1889.29,"Chew had simply taken passage on an American ship, hadn't he?"
1982.81-129,1,25737,gary_h_manulkin,,1893.101,1898.186,"In fact, I believe he was an American merchant seaman, that's correct, yes, and he had--"
1982.81-129,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1898.186,1899.375,"Yes, on an American ship."
1982.81-129,1,25737,gary_h_manulkin,,1899.375,1910.522,"--On a ship, and for four months he had been gone from the United States, and he was without any visible family, or there were no particular hardships in terms of his home."
1982.81-129,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1933.807,1939.603,"But he didn't deliberately leave for foreign soil, the way your client did."
1982.81-129,1,25737,gary_h_manulkin,,1942.165,1942.906,No.
1982.81-129,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1963.476,1966.561,"Mr. Manulkin, if we could go back to the Chew case for a minute--"
1982.81-129,1,25737,gary_h_manulkin,,1966.561,1966.969,Yes.
1982.81-129,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1966.969,1979.909,--would you agree that the Chew decision does not give returning resident aliens a right to treatment that is identical to that of a continuously present resident?
1982.81-129,1,25737,gary_h_manulkin,,1979.909,1980.57,No.
1982.81-129,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1983.441,1984.032,You don't agree.
1982.81-129,1,25737,gary_h_manulkin,,1984.032,1990.654,"And the reason I don't agree with that is because of the language in the Chew v. Colding, that specific language that says,"
1982.81-129,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2032.782,2036.285,"Well, all that shows is that the District of Columbia Circuit agrees with the Ninth Circuit."
1982.81-129,1,25737,gary_h_manulkin,,2036.285,2041.518,"Yes, that is true, and agrees, they felt, agreed with the Supreme Court of the United States."
1982.81-129,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2041.518,2051.716,"Well, Chew was actually decided prior to the Immigration Act of 1952, when the Congress codified all of these immigration policies."
1982.81-129,1,25737,gary_h_manulkin,,2058.789,2069.567,"I believe, Your Honor, that the case was in fact... you are right... begun before 1952, but in actuality this Court's decision was rendered in 1953, after the 1952 Immigration Act."
1982.81-129,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2069.567,2072.737,"Yes, but it didn't purport to construe the 1952 Act."
1982.81-129,1,25737,gary_h_manulkin,,2072.737,2075.111,"Well, no, it did in one sense."
1982.81-129,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2107.762,2115.619,"Well, are you suggesting that Chew when the 1952 Act wasn't before the Court, attempted to cast doubt on the 1952 Act?"
1982.81-129,1,25737,gary_h_manulkin,,2115.619,2116.598,No.
1982.81-129,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2288.531,2289.973,You say it is possible?
1982.81-129,1,25737,gary_h_manulkin,,2289.973,2297.548,"The evidence is very difficult from the 20-some pages of transcript to determine, I feel."
1982.81-129,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2325.467,2344.337,"Mr. Manulkin, if the alien had been out of the country for five years under your theory, would that alien be entitled on coming back in to say, it isn't true, I contest this, and therefore be entitled to a deportation hearing."
1982.81-129,1,25737,gary_h_manulkin,,2344.337,2346.259,"You mean, if she had remained in Mexico for five years?"
1982.81-129,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2346.259,2346.908,Sure.
1982.81-129,1,25737,gary_h_manulkin,,2346.908,2347.629,"No, no."
1982.81-129,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2347.629,2350.411,"Comes back in and says, no, no, that is not true, I want a deportation hearing."
1982.81-129,1,25737,gary_h_manulkin,,2350.411,2350.952,No.
1982.81-129,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2350.952,2351.653,What is the difference?
1982.81-129,1,25737,gary_h_manulkin,,2351.653,2366.233,"Well, because we feel that... we agree with the Shaughnessy versus Mezei decision of this Court when it stated that Mr. Mezei, having left the United States for 19 months to go to Hungary without the permission of this--"
1982.81-129,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2366.233,2371.736,"But under your theory, those facts should be determined at a deportation hearing."
1982.81-129,1,25737,gary_h_manulkin,,2372.828,2384.304,"--No, no, because in that particular case, there is not a brief visit outside the United States, in either Shaughnessy versus Mezei or the factual situation that you just presented."
1982.81-129,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2395.151,2407.33,"Why shouldn't the government be entitled to proceed at an exclusion proceeding, as the statute might well indicate, and simply afford the alien whatever process is due?"
1982.81-129,1,25737,gary_h_manulkin,,2407.33,2438.728,"Well, I think one of the most difficult problems with a person put into that situation would be the sections dealing with the amelioration of the hardships attendant to being deported from the United States, such as, I mentioned earlier Section 243(h) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, which states that a person can apply for a stay of deportation if there is a well-founded fear of the likelihood of persecution on the basis of race, religion, or political opinion."
1982.81-129,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2531.861,2534.743,How long since she undertook to the United States?
1982.81-129,1,25737,gary_h_manulkin,,2534.743,2535.093,--I am sorry?
1982.81-129,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2535.093,2538.594,How many years have passed since this episode occurred?
1982.81-129,1,25737,gary_h_manulkin,,2538.594,2540.887,"Well, she has been living in the United States."
1982.81-129,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2540.887,2544.82,"The episode, coming across the border with aliens."
1982.81-129,1,25737,gary_h_manulkin,,2544.82,2546.119,How long had she been living in the United States?
1982.81-129,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2546.119,2548.901,"No, how many years ago did this occur?"
1982.81-129,1,25737,gary_h_manulkin,,2548.901,2550.992,"This occurred in 1975, Your Honor."
1982.81-129,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2550.992,2554.835,So now it is seven years.
1982.81-129,1,25737,gary_h_manulkin,,2554.835,2555.576,"Yes, it is, Your Honor."
1982.81-129,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2555.576,2563.0,"Now, if you prevailed here, could any criminal charges be brought against her?"
1982.81-129,1,25737,gary_h_manulkin,,2563.0,2567.264,"Under the possible statute of limitations, I believe not."
1982.81-129,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2567.264,2568.544,The statute of limitations has run.
1982.81-129,1,25737,gary_h_manulkin,,2568.544,2568.774,That's right.
1982.81-129,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2569.535,2573.509,"What about a deportation proceeding, the full-scale proceeding that you would like?"
1982.81-129,1,25737,gary_h_manulkin,,2573.509,2574.17,Yes.
1982.81-129,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2575.499,2576.12,That could be brought?
1982.81-129,1,25737,gary_h_manulkin,,2576.12,2577.111,"Yes, I believe so."
1982.81-129,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2577.111,2578.922,"The evidence is seven years old now, isn't it?"
1982.81-129,1,25737,gary_h_manulkin,,2578.922,2597.313,"Well, the government did have written statements from all of the witnesses, as we understand it, and written statements are admissible in deportation proceedings when there is unavailability of the individuals to testify, so I believe the government would be very little prejudiced by holding a deportation hearing today."
1982.81-129,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2633.025,2636.227,How long had she lived in the United States before?
1982.81-129,1,25737,gary_h_manulkin,,2636.227,2639.68,"She had... It is not in the record, Your Honor."
1982.81-129,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2639.68,2642.011,"Well, she's got three children that are getting ready to go in the Army."
1982.81-129,1,25737,gary_h_manulkin,,2642.011,2655.051,"Well, as a matter of fact, I believe only one of those was a son, but she had come to the United States in probably the late sixties, about 1968, and then immigrated in 1970."
1982.81-129,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2655.051,2656.493,Did she bring those children with her?
1982.81-129,1,25737,gary_h_manulkin,,2656.493,2657.613,"Yes, she did."
1982.81-129,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2657.613,2659.776,I thought you said they were American citizens.
1982.81-129,1,25737,gary_h_manulkin,,2659.776,2662.237,"No, the children never became American citizens."
1982.81-129,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2662.237,2664.938,"Oh, I guess I misunderstood you."
1982.81-129,1,25737,gary_h_manulkin,,2664.938,2665.299,They are still permanent residents.
1982.81-129,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2707.557,2714.542,"Well, why couldn't I... I could personally distinguish on the fact that he wasn't importing illegal aliens?"
1982.81-129,1,25737,gary_h_manulkin,,2714.542,2717.664,"Because he was a danger to national security, as I would--"
1982.81-129,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2717.664,2719.414,"Well, that is a distinguishing proposition, isn't it?"
1982.81-129,1,25737,gary_h_manulkin,,2719.414,2732.765,"--It would be a matter, I suppose, of weighing which is more in violation of immigration policy, to aid and abet illegal entry or to become a danger to national security."
1982.81-129,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2733.703,2735.714,"Well, Chew also simply construed a regulation."
1982.81-129,1,25737,gary_h_manulkin,,2743.701,2747.734,"--It only... like I said, Your Honor, in the footnotes, discussed 101(a)(13), which--"
1982.81-129,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2747.734,2749.415,The footnote discusses it in two sentences.
1982.81-129,1,25737,gary_h_manulkin,,2749.415,2749.946,"--Yes, it does."
1982.81-129,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2750.477,2753.415,Not in the long discourse which you are suggesting.
1982.81-129,1,25737,gary_h_manulkin,,2753.415,2777.3,"No, you are right, it does not go into a long discussion of the 1952 Act, but I believe I would differ in that it did in fact construe the situation of a continuing permanent resident as to the amount of procedural protections and due process that that individual is entitled to, whatever the statute is, whether it was a pre-'52 statute or a post-'52."
1982.81-129,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2777.3,2783.825,Doesn't Chew contain the statement that all we are doing is construing this regulation and saying it wasn't authorized by statute?
1982.81-129,1,25737,gary_h_manulkin,,2783.825,2785.247,It did attempt to limit--
1982.81-129,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2785.247,2787.799,I thought it quite successfully limited it.
1982.81-129,1,25737,gary_h_manulkin,,2790.901,2804.752,"--Well, I believe, Your Honor, that you are right, that it did construe a regulation, and I believe that it did attempt to narrow at the very latter part of the case, after it had already said these words in different contexts three or four times,"
1982.81-129,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2823.094,2830.377,"But here, the statute clearly authorizes what was done, and in Chew they simply held the statute didn't authorize what was done."
1982.81-129,1,25737,gary_h_manulkin,,2830.377,2831.729,--That is basically true.
1982.81-129,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2899.243,2902.756,How would that help her on her exclusion?
1982.81-129,1,25737,gary_h_manulkin,,2902.756,2907.028,"--Well, it wouldn't, as a matter of fact, help her if she were found guilty, Your Honor."
1982.81-129,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2923.339,2931.044,"The government might at that time have decided to prosecute him and not her, if she was excludable and excluded."
1982.81-129,1,25737,gary_h_manulkin,,2931.044,2932.436,"They did not though, Your Honor."
1982.81-129,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3029.769,3030.259,Wait a minute.
1982.81-129,1,25737,gary_h_manulkin,,3034.842,3037.523,"Well, Your Honor, we are arguing--"
1982.81-129,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3037.523,3041.397,You said you want her held for deportation.
1982.81-129,1,25737,gary_h_manulkin,,3045.188,3050.731,"--I feel... that is my position, if we are asking for an affirmance of the Ninth Circuit."
1982.81-129,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3050.731,3052.844,"Well, does your client agree with you?"
1982.81-129,1,25737,gary_h_manulkin,,3052.844,3054.224,"Well, certainly not."
1982.81-129,2,23151,elliott_schulder,,3070.906,3072.336,"Yes, Your Honor."
1982.81-129,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3321.6,3322.662,"Thank you, gentlemen."
