1988.87-2050,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,12.141,14.424,Thank you.
1988.87-2050,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,47.395,49.678,"So, it was on private property?"
1988.87-2050,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,49.678,50.847,"Yes, Your Honor."
1988.87-2050,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,130.596,133.881,"And we had a Scarsdale, New York case."
1988.87-2050,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,133.881,135.083,"Yes, Your Honor."
1988.87-2050,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,200.991,204.693,What was it that surrounded the creche in the Pawtucket case?
1988.87-2050,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,204.693,220.737,"Well, the creche in the Pawtucket case was surrounded by a variety of things, including a jumbo candy-cane, a talking wishing well, some reindeer, a Santa Claus, a sleigh and a variety of Christmas symbols."
1988.87-2050,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,220.737,226.908,And did the court find that that had some significance for the Establishment Claim?
1988.87-2050,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,226.908,231.26,"Well, that's a matter of dispute in the case, Your Honor."
1988.87-2050,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,243.687,248.389,None of those things that you've listed were... surrounded the creche in this case.
1988.87-2050,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,248.389,249.022,--All right.
1988.87-2050,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,349.67,350.206,Counsel--
1988.87-2050,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,350.206,350.989,--sponsored by the city.
1988.87-2050,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,350.989,358.309,--would you think that the context of the Christmas season would justify holding a religious service in the City-County Building?
1988.87-2050,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,362.778,371.467,"Well, Your Honor, that question was raised during the oral argument in Lynch, and I think I'll answer it the same way as the Solicitor General answered it on that occasion."
1988.87-2050,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,445.848,460.608,"Do you think the message conveyed by a display may be different when the symbol is located in a city hall or a courthouse instead of a park in a commercial district, a private park?"
1988.87-2050,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,460.608,462.475,"Your Honor, we don't think so."
1988.87-2050,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,517.444,519.729,Are all symbols passive?
1988.87-2050,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,527.733,530.769,Yes.
1988.87-2050,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,637.522,639.589,Am I saying your name right?
1988.87-2050,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,639.589,640.891,Buscemi.
1988.87-2050,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,640.891,641.574,Buscemi.
1988.87-2050,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,656.601,657.603,I'm not aware that--
1988.87-2050,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,657.603,658.336,--pick a Moslem holiday.
1988.87-2050,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,665.423,669.042,--I'm not aware that the city does put up a similar display for any holiday.
1988.87-2050,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,682.968,683.668,Uh-huh.
1988.87-2050,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,683.668,686.67,"So, just to answer your specific question--"
1988.87-2050,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,686.67,687.538,"Well, pick another faith."
1988.87-2050,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,707.267,715.79,--The key point in the Lynch case and the key point in my answer to your question would be the Christmas holiday season itself.
1988.87-2050,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,757.533,759.733,"Well, that explains the creche but not the menorah."
1988.87-2050,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,759.733,769.341,"The menorah, I think, Your Honor, is part and parcel of the holiday season, as it is celebrated by the residents of Pittsburgh."
1988.87-2050,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,803.062,806.698,Do the creche and menorah have to be about the same size?
1988.87-2050,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,811.668,823.409,"Well, in fact, in this particular case we had a menorah next to a Christmas tree without a nativity scene, and then a nativity scene on the staircase indoors without a menorah at all."
1988.87-2050,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,830.915,831.498,"Well, what if--"
1988.87-2050,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,831.498,832.015,--as I said--
1988.87-2050,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,832.015,835.033,--the menorah were there without a Christmas tree next to it?
1988.87-2050,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,843.806,849.543,"--Well, Your Honor, I would say that that would also be permissible."
1988.87-2050,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,899.04,902.992,Did any of the Plaintiffs in this case challenge the Christmas tree by itself?
1988.87-2050,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,902.992,904.109,"No, sir."
1988.87-2050,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,920.887,921.87,"Very well, Mr. Buscemi."
1988.87-2050,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,922.805,934.13,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1988.87-2050,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1070.419,1071.536,Mr. Lewin--
1988.87-2050,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,1071.536,1072.186,--their own holidays.
1988.87-2050,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1072.186,1079.441,"--Mr. Lewin, do you think the city had a duty to put up the menorah if there had been a request for or having already decided to display the creche?"
1988.87-2050,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,1079.441,1080.507,That's our--
1988.87-2050,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1080.507,1081.307,A constitutional duty?
1988.87-2050,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,1081.307,1088.297,"--We argue alternatively, Justice Stevens, that under Larson and Valente there is a basis for such an argument."
1988.87-2050,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1102.021,1102.338,"Well, that's the--"
1988.87-2050,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,1102.338,1103.057,--were to approach the--
1988.87-2050,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1103.057,1103.707,--next question I was going to ask.
1988.87-2050,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,1103.707,1104.223,--city and it were possible--
1988.87-2050,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1104.223,1115.579,"If then you have two religions represented, would you have a constitutional obligation to satisfy the request of a third or fourth and a fifth that might have different... pagan symbols or whatever they might be?"
1988.87-2050,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,1115.579,1126.685,"--We think that a city that has a place, such as the steps of city hall, or something, where it could put other symbols, should not discriminate among religions and should--"
1988.87-2050,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1126.685,1127.085,The how large--
1988.87-2050,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,1127.085,1127.47,--in fact--
1988.87-2050,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1127.47,1127.837,--how large--
1988.87-2050,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,1127.837,1128.52,--put other symbols there as well.
1988.87-2050,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1128.52,1132.005,--How large must the religious group be to be entitled to that kind of representation?
1988.87-2050,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,1132.005,1139.694,"Well, frankly, I think a religious group that is a bona fide religious group."
1988.87-2050,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1145.664,1150.05,I suppose three or four persons who sincerely believed in the particular faith would be sufficient.
1988.87-2050,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,1150.05,1151.085,"Well, again--"
1988.87-2050,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1151.085,1152.052,"Well, why not?"
1988.87-2050,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,1152.052,1152.585,--I think it's--
1988.87-2050,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1152.585,1152.985,Why not?
1988.87-2050,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,1152.985,1153.468,--It's--
1988.87-2050,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1153.468,1155.37,Is this a majority rule kind of thing--
1988.87-2050,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,1155.37,1158.156,"--No, I don't... it's not a majority rule, Justice Stevens."
1988.87-2050,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1161.608,1168.428,"--I mean, there can be a very large religion from, you know, another country where they have only three or four representatives in Pittsburgh, but they may feel just as deeply about it."
1988.87-2050,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,1168.428,1178.95,"--And I think that for... indeed, if, for example, the City of Pittsburgh had a public forum which was open to religious faiths to conduct meetings on, it would be guided by the same the standard."
1988.87-2050,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1178.95,1181.069,"Well, has it not adopted a public forum?"
1988.87-2050,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,1182.236,1192.876,"Well, in this case the evidence, frankly, doesn't support the public forum position because there was no effort made at the trial level to demonstrate that the steps of City Hall were a public forum."
1988.87-2050,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1222.51,1225.495,How about a menorah for a very small group?
1988.87-2050,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,1227.947,1230.049,"--No, they need not be the same size, Justice Scalia."
1988.87-2050,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1348.125,1357.998,"--Well, Mr. Lewin, why wouldn't the city have to open up its steps on another holiday for another religious faith?"
1988.87-2050,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,1357.998,1367.021,"That's... I submit, Justice White, that... that's a much more difficult question than when it is already opening it up to the majority faith."
1988.87-2050,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1368.956,1375.61,"Well, I know, but if a religion says we have no business... we haven't any interest in putting our symbol up there at Christmas time."
1988.87-2050,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,1388.35,1401.677,"--Quite frankly, Justice White, if... if there were a, a public forum that was opened up to Christian ceremonies at Christmas time, then I think it would be appropriate to say to a minority faith,"
1988.87-2050,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1440.816,1441.283,"Well, doesn't it have--"
1988.87-2050,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,1441.283,1442.049,--an answer to Justice Scalia.
1988.87-2050,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1442.049,1442.985,--Doesn't it have to be a public forum?
1988.87-2050,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,1453.491,1455.693,"No, I don't think--"
1988.87-2050,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1455.693,1456.476,The majority religion.
1988.87-2050,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,1456.476,1464.132,"--I think if there is an area that is not thrown open to public meetings and, therefore, there is no evidence that it is a public forum--"
1988.87-2050,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1464.132,1468.183,"Well, here's steps that are thrown open to religious symbols by a majority faith."
1988.87-2050,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,1468.183,1476.956,"--If the steps are thrown open to religious symbols by a majority faith, then I think that they are a public forum as to which a minority faith may say,"
1988.87-2050,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1480.074,1481.124,"So, it has to be a public forum for this purpose?"
1988.87-2050,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,1481.124,1481.674,Yes.
1988.87-2050,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1481.674,1482.491,For that purpose only.
1988.87-2050,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,1482.491,1482.943,"Yes, I agree."
1988.87-2050,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1484.043,1490.364,Is it not correct that the whole premise of your argument is that the creche itself conveys a religious message?
1988.87-2050,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,1490.364,1492.382,The creche conveys a religious message.
1988.87-2050,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1505.19,1506.423,Are you defending Lynch?
1988.87-2050,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,1506.423,1509.142,"Of course we're... yes, we stand--"
1988.87-2050,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1509.142,1509.508,All right.
1988.87-2050,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,1509.508,1510.177,--firmly behind Lynch.
1988.87-2050,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1526.687,1527.487,"Thank you, Mr. Lewin."
1988.87-2050,2,39772,roslyn_m_litman,,1529.639,1534.841,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1988.87-2050,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1674.533,1676.733,And it is with the Christmas tree?
1988.87-2050,2,39772,roslyn_m_litman,,1676.733,1679.318,"That is exactly correct, Justice Rehnquist."
1988.87-2050,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1730.017,1734.619,"Well, the... the two displays are, are somewhat different, aren't they, Mrs. Litman?"
1988.87-2050,2,39772,roslyn_m_litman,,1734.619,1737.255,"--They are totally different displays, Justice Blackmun."
1988.87-2050,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1737.255,1744.158,But you take the position that you're supporting both of them in your position?
1988.87-2050,2,39772,roslyn_m_litman,,1744.158,1747.462,We take the same position as to both of them.
1988.87-2050,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1750.497,1754.366,"From your point of view, the county one is easier, isn't it?"
1988.87-2050,2,39772,roslyn_m_litman,,1754.366,1763.555,"Well, Justice Blackmun, I think that the county one could be considered to be an easier one in one sense."
1988.87-2050,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1822.594,1825.462,Unembellished by anything except flowers?
1988.87-2050,2,39772,roslyn_m_litman,,1825.462,1849.511,"Yes, Justice Blackmun, and I think that it is significant that both Father Swiderski, who testified saying that this profaned his symbol to have it there between the signs of the county commissioner here, the official signs, the controller and the treasurer here, and the nativity scene, which he testified was similar to the kinds one sees in a, in a Catholic Church."
1988.87-2050,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1856.85,1868.491,"Mr. Lewin's point is that precisely to eliminate any such misperception on the part of this young man, it would be good to have a menorah there as well."
1988.87-2050,2,39772,roslyn_m_litman,,1868.491,1877.68,"Well, of course, Justice Scalia, I would assume that perhaps Mr. Lewin would like a menorah next to the nativity scene, although that... that wasn't asked."
1988.87-2050,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1881.465,1881.849,Uh-huh.
1988.87-2050,2,39772,roslyn_m_litman,,1881.849,1893.773,"--which is the premise of his argument... he says that the Christmas tree by itself sends a religious message, and, therefore, that necessitates that the city have the menorah as well."
1988.87-2050,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1911.584,1913.27,It was in Lynch--
1988.87-2050,2,39772,roslyn_m_litman,,1913.27,1913.686,--selected--
1988.87-2050,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1913.686,1914.92,"--It was in Lynch too, of course."
1988.87-2050,2,39772,roslyn_m_litman,,1914.92,1915.805,--Yes.
1988.87-2050,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1949.193,1949.643,"Well, where--"
1988.87-2050,2,39772,roslyn_m_litman,,1949.643,1952.561,--that he or she will be treated equally irrespective of religion.
1988.87-2050,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1952.561,1953.278,--Where was it in Lynch?
1988.87-2050,2,39772,roslyn_m_litman,,1953.278,1953.761,In--
1988.87-2050,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1953.761,1958.049,I had the impression it was in a place that it would be even more difficult to avoid.
1988.87-2050,2,39772,roslyn_m_litman,,1958.049,1958.682,--It... it--
1988.87-2050,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1958.682,1961.084,"And it was clear that that was a governmental display, wasn't it?"
1988.87-2050,2,39772,roslyn_m_litman,,1971.725,1982.848,"--Justice Scalia, I think that the, the decision in this case should hinge on the confluence, the combination of all three factors."

1988.87-2050,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2068.47,2070.388,--the carols had any connection with religion?

1988.87-2050,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2074.959,2075.992,"Well, why did you drop it?"
1988.87-2050,2,39772,roslyn_m_litman,,2075.992,2077.726,"Oh, it wasn't dropped, Your Honor."
1988.87-2050,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2095.438,2097.073,Is that going to be the line?
1988.87-2050,2,39772,roslyn_m_litman,,2118.053,2125.892,"In this case not, Justice Scalia, because the... well, in this case not so clear because the carols are done by outside groups."

1988.87-2050,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2137.683,2152.126,"--do you think that the city and county government can open up a courthouse or other public building to allow carolers to come in and sing at holiday seasons, and presumably other groups as well, at appropriate times?"
1988.87-2050,2,39772,roslyn_m_litman,,2152.126,2167.886,"Justice O'Connor, with respect to that... and, of course, that is not the question before the Court... I think that one could raise a question as to the propriety of singing one religion's carols."
1988.87-2050,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2170.671,2171.704,"So, you take the--"

1988.87-2050,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2253.458,2254.108,It wouldn't be the government doing it.
1988.87-2050,2,39772,roslyn_m_litman,,2255.877,2257.527,"--I think not, Justice Scalia."
1988.87-2050,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2273.155,2273.605,Uh-huh.
1988.87-2050,2,39772,roslyn_m_litman,,2273.605,2282.094,"--in a building that is so closely linked, that has this symbolic link with government, you can't dispel the concept that government is endorsing it."
1988.87-2050,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2283.011,2286.296,That's a very rational position until you say that carols are okay.

1988.87-2050,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2310.612,2313.28,--does the government have a duty to accommodate religion?

1988.87-2050,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2334.242,2345.4,Would you say that at some point a... an attempt by the government to purge religious symbols from our life can constitute hostility to religion?
1988.87-2050,2,39772,roslyn_m_litman,,2346.335,2361.177,"Well, I have not actually thought about the concept of having government purge it, but I would think clearly it appears to me from your question that, yes, there would be a point at which it would be violating the free exercise rights we all have."
1988.87-2050,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2361.977,2376.021,"So, if... suppose that the government officials at the inauguration left during the invocation that preceded the Presidential Inaugural."

1988.87-2050,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2390.395,2392.863,Or perhaps sat down while everybody else was standing up?
1988.87-2050,2,39772,roslyn_m_litman,,2392.863,2393.613,I think not.
1988.87-2050,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2400.45,2406.504,"Isn't the reason for that that if you insisted on that action, it would show hostility to religion?"
1988.87-2050,2,39772,roslyn_m_litman,,2406.504,2419.328,"Perhaps it would show that, but I would premise my, my answer on the fact that government officials, like others, as this Court has said, have free exercise rights."

1988.87-2050,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2522.629,2533.437,"Well, certainly one thing... one way it could justify doing that is, we were told by opposing counsel that the Moslems simply do not want something like that."

1988.87-2050,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3462.377,3467.246,"Obviously, you're not going to say you've got to take ""In God We Trust"" off the coins and everything like that."
1988.87-2050,3,37735,peter_buscemi,,3472.166,3473.217,--That's exactly right.
1988.87-2050,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3475.334,3479.522,And if there is some... what seems to be an arbitrary line is because somewhere you've got to draw a line.
1988.87-2050,3,37735,peter_buscemi,,3479.522,3481.238,--It's precisely what the Court said--
1988.87-2050,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3481.238,3481.955,And it would not be ridiculous to say--

1988.87-2050,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3498.434,3502.586,"No, but there's all sorts of secular aspects of that display that are not repeated in this display."
1988.87-2050,3,37735,peter_buscemi,,3502.586,3504.038,"--Well, that's true."
