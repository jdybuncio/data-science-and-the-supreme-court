2004.04-480,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,37.392,39.781,"May I just interrupt for the one... you said ""the only significant use""."
2004.04-480,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,47.773,48.503,--Yeah.
2004.04-480,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,49.328,50.078,"Is that correct, or incorrect?"
2004.04-480,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,50.078,56.308,"--Well, I think it's an absolutely incorrect assertion of reality, and perhaps I could delve into it and explain why."
2004.04-480,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,67.37,68.657,"Now, was there a finding of 90 percent?"
2004.04-480,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,68.657,76.366,"Well, this was submitted on summary judgement, Your Honor, and we lost summary judgement, so the evidence has got to be construed in the light most favorable to us."
2004.04-480,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,116.027,116.452,It goes to the--
2004.04-480,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,116.452,117.367,--imagine how many infringing--
2004.04-480,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,117.367,120.674,--accuracy of your statement that there is no other significant legitimate use.
2004.04-480,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,120.674,133.081,"--I don't think there... I think it's quite accurate on the summary-judgement record, and certainly drawing the inferences in our favor, as we must here on summary... on this summary-judgement record, that there is no commercially significant noninfringing use."
2004.04-480,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,133.081,133.79,But there could be.
2004.04-480,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,142.575,152.255,"I don't think, in the context of this record in this case and the business model of these Defendants, Grokster and StreamCast, that that is true, Justice Ginsburg."
2004.04-480,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,223.451,227.105,"Your argument, I take it, would be the same if the proportions were reversed."
2004.04-480,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,241.287,245.069,"--The active-encouragement aspect of our argument would be the same, certainly."
2004.04-480,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,245.069,245.233,That's right.
2004.04-480,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,245.233,248.103,They don't get a... they don't get a free pass to encourage any infringement.
2004.04-480,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,248.103,251.146,Is that the same as active inducement--
2004.04-480,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,251.146,251.552,Yes.
2004.04-480,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,252.061,252.392,--as that term--
2004.04-480,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,252.392,253.004,--there's a lot of--
2004.04-480,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,253.004,253.573,--is used?
2004.04-480,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,253.573,258.673,"--Yes, Justice O'Connor, there's a lot of lingo floating around in this case... inducement, active encouragement and assistance."
2004.04-480,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,258.673,280.265,"If we should think that the Respondents are not liable for the type of contributory infringement dealt with in Sony, could this Court reach the question of active inducement on this record?"
2004.04-480,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,280.265,281.492,"Yes, very definitely."
2004.04-480,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,285.731,285.978,"I know you do, but--"
2004.04-480,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,285.978,286.569,--but with respect to--
2004.04-480,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,286.569,286.895,--I just said--
2004.04-480,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,286.895,287.377,--that theory--
2004.04-480,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,287.377,287.797,--could you--
2004.04-480,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,287.797,287.947,--Yes.
2004.04-480,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,287.947,294.213,"--assume, for a moment, that we didn't; could we, nonetheless, address the active inducement--"
2004.04-480,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,294.213,294.584,Yes--
2004.04-480,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,294.584,294.923,--question?
2004.04-480,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,294.923,296.264,"--Justice O'Connor, and let me explain why."
2004.04-480,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,381.573,394.377,"It's not clear... it's not clear to me from your brief, focusing on the contributory aspect of it, not... and not the inducement part of it... it's not clear to me from your brief what your test is."
2004.04-480,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,402.973,404.895,--Here's what I... here's where I think the test--
2004.04-480,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,404.895,406.01,Leaving aside the inducement.
2004.04-480,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,406.01,406.512,--Right.
2004.04-480,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,433.991,436.845,"Well, then we just throw this to the birds on the trier of fact in every case--"
2004.04-480,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,436.845,437.716,"No, I think--"
2004.04-480,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,437.716,438.583,"--Well, how do we know--"
2004.04-480,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,438.583,439.673,--And that's where you start.
2004.04-480,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,468.001,470.08,You're not saying... now you're using different tests.
2004.04-480,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,503.563,504.879,"--Yeah, I think my answer to--"
2004.04-480,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,504.879,505.189,What's the answer?
2004.04-480,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,505.189,506.657,"--those questions are: yes, yes, yes, and yes."
2004.04-480,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,507.482,511.905,"Because in each case... for all I know, the monks had a fit when Gutenberg made his press--"
2004.04-480,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,526.911,528.289,"I disagree with that, Your Honor."
2004.04-480,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,578.235,580.815,"How do you... how do you know, going in, Mr. Verrilli?"
2004.04-480,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,594.9,595.56,"--Well, I--"
2004.04-480,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,595.56,602.042,"And it's one thing to sit back and, you know, calculate with this ongoing business, it's 90 percent/10 percent."
2004.04-480,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,604.577,605.351,--I think the weight--
2004.04-480,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,605.351,606.616,--I'm going to get sued right away.
2004.04-480,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,609.711,612.028,"--I don't think that's right, Your Honor, and here's why."
2004.04-480,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,634.173,646.537,"--Well, I don't quite understand the... I take it, inventors are profit-motive-driven, and if they know that something they're working on is going to have copyright experience, you... copyright problems, you can't just say,"
2004.04-480,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,647.941,649.479,"Well, I... but the problem--"
2004.04-480,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,649.479,650.499,Or did I misunderstand your--
2004.04-480,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,650.499,656.446,"--No, I... I think that you have... to show contribution, you should have... you have to be making a material contribution, with knowledge that you're doing so."
2004.04-480,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,657.551,659.26,But the inventor of Xerox does that.
2004.04-480,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,664.471,666.114,"--I don't think that's right, Justice Scalia."
2004.04-480,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,677.014,677.906,"Well, let's go--"
2004.04-480,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,677.906,678.099,--realistic.
2004.04-480,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,678.099,681.026,--let's go from Xerox back to your iPod.
2004.04-480,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,708.851,713.252,"Well, because I don't actually think that there is evidence that you've got overwhelming infringing use."
2004.04-480,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,716.077,722.981,"Well, there's never evidence at the time the guy is sitting in the garage figuring out whether to invent the iPod or not."
2004.04-480,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,723.685,723.895,--I think when you get to the--
2004.04-480,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,723.895,724.464,--the concern.
2004.04-480,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,724.464,728.728,"--I think when you have vast-majority infringing use, they should be on the hook."
2004.04-480,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,729.373,730.036,"Okay, but you're--"
2004.04-480,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,730.036,730.347,--you have that problem--
2004.04-480,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,730.347,730.739,"--No, but you're--"
2004.04-480,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,730.739,731.269,"--with the iPod, and--"
2004.04-480,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,731.269,732.917,--you're not answering... you're not answering the question.
2004.04-480,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,765.675,777.277,"--Well, first of all, I don't... I think it's just counterfactual to think that there is going to be overwhelming infringing use of the iPod in the way that there indisputably is here."
2004.04-480,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,796.803,799.06,"That's your second argument, I think."
2004.04-480,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,805.614,806.217,"Yeah, that's inducement."
2004.04-480,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,806.217,812.554,"--No, I don't think it is an inducement argument, because it doesn't go all the way to requiring us to show, as we can show here, that they've got intent."
2004.04-480,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,826.816,830.179,--But it is the case under the test you're submitting to us.
2004.04-480,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,830.179,832.672,"--No, I don't think that's right, Justice Kennedy."
2004.04-480,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,846.369,856.141,"Well, are you dealing with active inducement as just a theoretical add-on, or is that a satisfactory way to resolve this case?"
2004.04-480,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,856.141,858.404,--I think that it is a... I think--
2004.04-480,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,858.404,859.991,I don't understand--
2004.04-480,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,859.991,860.291,"--Neither, is the answer."
2004.04-480,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,860.291,860.783,--your pitch.
2004.04-480,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,860.783,862.7,"Neither, is the answer."
2004.04-480,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,868.784,870.547,But you couldn't get summary judgement.
2004.04-480,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,880.688,881.784,Yes.
2004.04-480,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,881.784,882.27,--so you could not--
2004.04-480,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,882.27,882.698,We--
2004.04-480,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,882.698,883.412,--you'd have to go to trial.
2004.04-480,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,883.412,884.192,--We agree with that.
2004.04-480,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,895.007,895.608,Sony itself had a trial--
2004.04-480,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,895.608,896.588,--That's right.
2004.04-480,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,896.588,896.822,--a full trial.
2004.04-480,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,896.822,898.014,"It came after the trial, that's right."
2004.04-480,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,923.896,924.675,"Very well, Mr. Verrilli."
2004.04-480,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,927.332,943.147,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2004.04-480,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,975.417,976.884,"Well, what do you think Sony allowed?"
2004.04-480,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,984.164,986.205,"--That's right, Justice O'Connor."
2004.04-480,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1002.657,1008.222,And what... and your test is whether there's a substantial use that's lawful?
2004.04-480,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1008.222,1023.35,"Well, I think the way we would try to articulate it is that if the way that the business model of the particular Defendant is set up is that they are not involved in a business substantially unrelated from copyright infringement, that there should be liability in that situation."
2004.04-480,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1039.027,1041.926,Where did the 90 percent figure come from?
2004.04-480,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1047.662,1053.124,It came from a study by Petitioners' experts of the actual operation of the system.
2004.04-480,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1064.903,1066.263,I thought it was just limited to music.
2004.04-480,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1066.263,1070.907,"Well, I think the... it's not... the system is not limited to music."
2004.04-480,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1070.907,1073.138,"I know, but I thought the study was about music."
2004.04-480,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1073.138,1074.94,"I'm not sure about that, but--"
2004.04-480,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1074.94,1085.505,"Well, I thought... I mean, you know, we've had 90 briefs in this, and some briefs tear it apart, and others support it, but we also have briefs from the ACLU saying you could put whole libraries within this system."
2004.04-480,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1085.505,1086.336,--Well--
2004.04-480,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1086.336,1097.71,"The question I wanted to ask you is, given that concern, that there are, conceptually anyway, really excellent uses of this thing, does deliberate... what is the word?"
2004.04-480,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1097.71,1098.881,--Actual inducement?
2004.04-480,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1098.881,1099.576,Yes.
2004.04-480,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1118.865,1130.023,"Well, based on our review of the record... and we haven't been able to see the entire record... I agree with you, the Petitioners ought to be able to win this case on an active-inducement ground, and that's a narrow way to decide the case."
2004.04-480,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1153.948,1155.057,"Well, you got interrupted a bit."
2004.04-480,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1165.288,1171.751,"Justice O'Connor, it stands for... the test is whether or not there are commercially significant noninfringing uses."
2004.04-480,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1201.052,1217.357,"Suppose the owner of the instrumentality, the program, thinks that there's going to be a vast area of lawful use, and he knows that there's going to be some abuse at the... in the short term, but he does everything he can to discourage that."
2004.04-480,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1235.996,1238.886,If it's 50 percent infringement in the short run?
2004.04-480,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1240.185,1241.385,"Yes, that he can--"
2004.04-480,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1241.385,1242.347,He can--
2004.04-480,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1242.347,1242.675,--use the program.
2004.04-480,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1242.675,1243.056,--use the program.
2004.04-480,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1283.046,1286.072,"If there's more, they could bring it out at trial, could they not?"
2004.04-480,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1298.027,1300.524,"I think that's a fair point, Justice Ginsburg."
2004.04-480,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1330.349,1335.499,The inducement... the inducement point doesn't get you very far.
2004.04-480,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1354.047,1356.049,I think that's potentially right--
2004.04-480,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1356.049,1356.614,Which is why you need--
2004.04-480,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1356.614,1356.976,--Justice Scalia--
2004.04-480,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1356.976,1357.748,--the Sony--
2004.04-480,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1357.748,1361.14,--and that's why I think it's important to preserve a role for the Sony test.
2004.04-480,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1391.257,1393.322,--Will you give a company ten years to establish that?
2004.04-480,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1393.322,1395.204,"Well, I don't think--"
2004.04-480,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1395.204,1401.212,"I mean, what I worry about is the suit that just comes right out of the box, as soon as the company starts up."
2004.04-480,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1405.886,1408.351,"--Well, Justice Scalia, we have concerns about that, as well."
2004.04-480,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1477.558,1488.775,"Mr. Clement, in one way this presents an easy case for answering Justice Scalia's question, but what about a case in which there isn't the Napster example to start with?"
2004.04-480,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1502.269,1508.656,"Well, whether you call it a flexible rightness doctrine or you develop the doctrine in a way that is very forgiving--"
2004.04-480,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1508.656,1509.424,Congress of laches.
2004.04-480,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1509.424,1509.742,--a brand-new technology.
2004.04-480,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1509.742,1511.181,Congress of laches.
2004.04-480,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1511.181,1511.633,Right.
2004.04-480,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1524.131,1531.139,"How would you express the... how would you express that, that substantive standard that anticipates, just as you suggested we do?"
2004.04-480,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1531.139,1537.787,"--Well, I was just trying to articulate it, which is to say that this Court has talked about the capacity for noninfringing uses."
2004.04-480,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1542.754,1543.437,"Thank you, Mr. Clement."
2004.04-480,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1543.437,1544.053,Thank you.
2004.04-480,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1544.053,1546.535,"Mr. Taranto, we'll hear from you."
2004.04-480,2,40639,richard_g_taranto,,1546.535,1551.221,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2004.04-480,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1581.184,1591.025,"Yeah, but active inducement is a doctrine that's been employed to curb the intentional encouragement of noninfringing uses, isn't it?"
2004.04-480,2,40639,richard_g_taranto,,1591.025,1595.31,"--Not in copyright law, it hasn't, but that's not my primary point."
2004.04-480,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1628.74,1629.468,But they are inherent.
2004.04-480,2,40639,richard_g_taranto,,1637.298,1639.501,"--No, I don't think so, Justice Scalia."
2004.04-480,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1696.141,1697.033,But I don't--
2004.04-480,2,40639,richard_g_taranto,,1697.033,1697.502,--from the past.
2004.04-480,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1697.502,1703.174,--understand how you can separate the past from the present in that fashion.
2004.04-480,2,40639,richard_g_taranto,,1729.81,1730.7,"No, I'm not."
2004.04-480,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1785.131,1793.07,"Then why was current... why was inducement, as a current theory of recovery, even the subject of summary judgement?"
2004.04-480,2,40639,richard_g_taranto,,1800.647,1802.619,--I'm not entirely--
2004.04-480,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1802.619,1807.75,"I mean, I thought you were saying that, so far as the inducement theory of recovery is concerned--"
2004.04-480,2,40639,richard_g_taranto,,1807.75,1808.396,--Yes.
2004.04-480,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1808.396,1818.516,"--the only summary judgement that was granted was with respect to current acts of inducement, the way the company is acting now, not the way the company was acting last year."
2004.04-480,2,40639,richard_g_taranto,,1826.719,1862.774,"I think... because as the Petitioners insisted when they pressed for interlocutory appeal, they said these were distinct and severable, because, as Justice Scalia referred to before, the important question, on a going-forward basis, is whether the current set of activities... this software, given how it operates, being generally distributed... is a vendor's... the distributor of that software... secondarily liable because somebody else, tomorrow, can do exactly the same thing, without the baggage of any--"
2004.04-480,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1862.774,1874.315,"Well, I don't want to get us too far off the track on this question, but it just seems to me that what you've done before bears on what you know, or have reason to know, on an ongoing basis."
2004.04-480,2,40639,richard_g_taranto,,1874.315,1877.622,"I agree with that, Justice Kennedy, but there's no dispute about that."
2004.04-480,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1905.112,1911.794,"Well, then why don't you tell us what's wrong with the Government's test and with the Petitioner's test, the substantial-use part of it."
2004.04-480,2,40639,richard_g_taranto,,1911.794,1918.613,"Well, I'm not entirely... I think there are several tests, and I'm not sure I followed them all here."
2004.04-480,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1918.613,1928.376,"We think it is critical that the Court adhere, for innovation protection, to the very clear Sony rule."
2004.04-480,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1928.376,1932.251,"That, Mr. Taranto, is something I find very puzzling."
2004.04-480,2,40639,richard_g_taranto,,1992.981,1999.66,"--Well, that sentence, Justice Ginsburg, is expressly stated to be the rule of law that is being applied."
2004.04-480,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2038.735,2042.011,"Mr. Verrilli, I hope you won't waste a lot of your time on this point."
2004.04-480,2,40639,richard_g_taranto,,2051.545,2074.857,"--Well, I will... let me urge that there is, in fact, considerable weight to stare decisis, because there are major technological industries that have relied on the rule that derives from patent law that there is no, kind of, predominant-use kind of meaning to Sony rule."
2004.04-480,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2099.377,2101.876,What is... what is the answer to Justice Kennedy's question?
2004.04-480,2,40639,richard_g_taranto,,2120.048,2120.5,Yes.
2004.04-480,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2120.5,2123.359,I... and the country seems to have survived that standard.
2004.04-480,2,40639,richard_g_taranto,,2141.445,2143.065,I... because I--
2004.04-480,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2143.065,2145.308,"That, I think, was the question, and I'm very interested in your answer."
2004.04-480,2,40639,richard_g_taranto,,2145.308,2145.761,--Right.
2004.04-480,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2170.617,2170.838,But--
2004.04-480,2,40639,richard_g_taranto,,2170.838,2171.188,Every--
2004.04-480,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2171.188,2184.245,--but what you have... what you want to do is to say that unlawfully expropriated property can be used by the owner of the instrumentality as part of the startup capital for his product.
2004.04-480,2,40639,richard_g_taranto,,2184.245,2185.707,--I... well--
2004.04-480,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2185.707,2189.909,"And I... just from an economic standpoint and a legal standpoint, that sounds wrong to me."
2004.04-480,2,40639,richard_g_taranto,,2189.909,2193.629,"--Well, I'm not entirely sure about that formulation."
2004.04-480,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2219.854,2220.112,So you think that--
2004.04-480,2,40639,richard_g_taranto,,2220.112,2220.539,--a thousand CDs.
2004.04-480,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2220.539,2224.191,--unlawfully expropriated property can be a legitimate part of the startup capital.
2004.04-480,2,40639,richard_g_taranto,,2224.191,2241.577,"No, I... what I think is that, as a matter of general judicially formulated secondary copyright liability law, there is no better policy balance that the Court can strike, and that only Congress can make the judgements about what the industry-wide facts are."
2004.04-480,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2257.766,2261.736,Then perhaps there should be a trial so it would all come out.
2004.04-480,2,40639,richard_g_taranto,,2261.736,2281.987,"--Petitioners... it's not just that they didn't have it in their brief, they did not submit any evidence in response to the summary-judgement motion that said the rule of Sony should be applied here because the magnitude of the injury to the recording industry or in... someday in the future, to the movie industry, is at zero--"
2004.04-480,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2281.987,2291.179,"Well, they weren't concentrating on the damage to them, they were concentrating on the facilitation of copying that was provided."
2004.04-480,2,40639,richard_g_taranto,,2295.852,2303.358,--As does the personal computer and the modem and the Internet service provider and the Microsoft operating system.
2004.04-480,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2319.497,2326.144,"Well, you said... I think you were saying... this is something for Congress to solve; it's not for the Court."
2004.04-480,2,40639,richard_g_taranto,,2346.552,2352.098,"Let me suggest why that's not odd and why the cases are not just different, but critically different."
2004.04-480,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2396.803,2399.079,Why isn't this a classic willful-ignorance case?
2004.04-480,2,40639,richard_g_taranto,,2399.079,2404.859,--Because willful ignorance is about having possession of information and refusing to look at it.
2004.04-480,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2431.377,2442.653,"Sure, but I thought willful ignorance was basically a certainty of what was going on without empirically verifying it, so as to, sort of, maintain the guise of one's hands over one's eyes."
2004.04-480,2,40639,richard_g_taranto,,2445.061,2448.237,"--No, I don't think so, I think, on either account."
2004.04-480,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2475.702,2480.596,"Yeah, I think it would also include disabling yourself from looking at it."
2004.04-480,2,40639,richard_g_taranto,,2494.724,2495.127,Right.
2004.04-480,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2502.647,2502.987,"Well, wait."
2004.04-480,2,40639,richard_g_taranto,,2538.203,2540.15,--I think--
2004.04-480,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2540.15,2549.006,"Because... as I had gotten that from one of these amicus briefs, you know, that's their standard... they say a willful... of willful, deliberate inducement."
2004.04-480,2,40639,richard_g_taranto,,2557.424,2574.204,"--I think that they can certainly argue, with an affirmance by this Court, that all of the past acts, to use the District Court's term, constitute a basis for a... inducement liability."
2004.04-480,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2635.539,2635.735,Mr. Taranto--
2004.04-480,2,40639,richard_g_taranto,,2635.735,2636.041,--the money to do it.
2004.04-480,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2636.041,2639.003,--can I ask... I'm still a little puzzled about the posture of the case.
2004.04-480,2,40639,richard_g_taranto,,2639.003,2639.431,Yes.
2004.04-480,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2639.431,2641.013,Because I read the District Court opinion.
2004.04-480,2,40639,richard_g_taranto,,2668.946,2669.931,Yes.
2004.04-480,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2681.808,2682.109,"But it says,"
2004.04-480,2,40639,richard_g_taranto,,2686.669,2690.188,--I think that's just because each side filed summary judgement.
2004.04-480,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2692.6,2701.361,"So then your answer to my question is that, yes, if we affirm, as a possibility, they could continue to seek damages on an active-inducement theory."
2004.04-480,2,40639,richard_g_taranto,,2701.361,2702.672,"--Yes, absolutely."
2004.04-480,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2711.8,2712.873,And then one other--
2004.04-480,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2712.873,2713.132,I thought--
2004.04-480,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2713.132,2713.753,--question I had.
2004.04-480,2,40639,richard_g_taranto,,2718.246,2733.832,"I don't think it does, beyond the statement at the end of their summary-judgement pleading that asked for a very general injunction, ""Stop the Defendants from infringing""."
2004.04-480,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2747.448,2754.921,"--Mr. Taranto, before you go back to that, I wanted to be clear on what you were saying would be left over for trial."
2004.04-480,2,40639,richard_g_taranto,,2754.921,2755.412,--Yes.
2004.04-480,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2755.412,2757.404,"Because, as I read your briefing, it was,"
2004.04-480,2,40639,richard_g_taranto,,2790.72,2795.858,"I... my view that... I mean, this was not talked about in these terms."
2004.04-480,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2811.383,2814.221,Then what is the point of the current summary judgement?
2004.04-480,2,40639,richard_g_taranto,,2814.221,2836.781,"The point of the current summary judgement is that there is... the forward-looking character of the activities taking place, starting in September 2002 on forward, has been held, by itself, not to be a basis for--"
2004.04-480,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2836.781,2839.079,"So you're saying the summary judgement simply, in effect, says,"
2004.04-480,2,40639,richard_g_taranto,,2851.407,2856.294,"--As I say, it wasn't stated in those terms, but, yes, I think that--"
2004.04-480,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2856.294,2856.99,That's bizarre.
2004.04-480,2,40639,richard_g_taranto,,2856.99,2858.747,"--Well, I don't think so, because--"
2004.04-480,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2879.246,2881.376,"So you're saying... what it really says is,"
2004.04-480,2,40639,richard_g_taranto,,2885.576,2886.313,--Yes.
2004.04-480,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2886.313,2887.795,"--""even as to future activity""."
2004.04-480,2,40639,richard_g_taranto,,2887.795,2889.674,"Yes, exactly right."
2004.04-480,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2987.018,2995.834,"Because, I gather, that some artists don't make money from the records, but make money from the popularity that draws fans to their concerts."
2004.04-480,2,40639,richard_g_taranto,,2995.834,2997.048,--My understanding--
2004.04-480,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2997.048,2998.463,So they're willing to give away the records for free.
2004.04-480,2,40639,richard_g_taranto,,2998.463,3002.297,"--my understanding is ""some"" is a great understatement, yes."
2004.04-480,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3055.809,3056.662,Mr. Taranto?
2004.04-480,2,40639,richard_g_taranto,,3056.662,3056.876,--Yes.
2004.04-480,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3056.876,3064.814,"In your motion for summary judgement, did you ask that the Plaintiff's claim be dismissed?"
2004.04-480,2,40639,richard_g_taranto,,3064.814,3079.351,"Well, we asked for judgement, in our favor on their claim, that our current activities constituted a basis for secondary liability."
2004.04-480,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3080.956,3081.71,Were there other claims?
2004.04-480,2,40639,richard_g_taranto,,3086.653,3092.947,--They had a generic claim about secondary copyright liability.
2004.04-480,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3120.738,3121.968,Where does one find that?
2004.04-480,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3121.968,3125.303,xxx--
2004.04-480,2,40639,richard_g_taranto,,3125.303,3144.168,"Yes, the motion... well, it... the simplest place, I guess, is in the June 2003 District Court ruling, which is in the Joint Appendix and attached to the brief in opposition, ruled on the Petitioner's motion for an interlocutory appeal under 1292."
2004.04-480,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3144.168,3149.902,But the motion itself is not there to take it through the opinion of the Court?
