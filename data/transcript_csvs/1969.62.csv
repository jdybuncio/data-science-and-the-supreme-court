1969.62,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,11.881,And we will hear now Loflin against Albert.
1969.62,0,31427,john_j_loflin_jr,,55.939,61.416,May it please the Court.
1969.62,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,302.069,308.447,"Excuse me counsel, where -- could you -- could find in the -- briefs are -- the record will be (Voice Overlap) --"
1969.62,0,31427,john_j_loflin_jr,,308.447,316.172,"Well, in the record its set forth at 127 (a)."
1969.62,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,318.222,322.122,Is that the same as in your brief on pages 2 to 4?2 to 5?
1969.62,0,31427,john_j_loflin_jr,,322.122,322.659,Yes sir.
1969.62,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,323.281,326.263,2 to 5?
1969.62,0,31427,john_j_loflin_jr,,326.263,328.715,"They are quoted in several different places, that's one."
1969.62,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,328.715,335.786,"Does that fall in your brief, pages 2 to 5?"
1969.62,0,31427,john_j_loflin_jr,,335.786,336.301,"Yes sir, that's correct."
1969.62,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,336.301,338.793,"Was the date April 26, 1968?"
1969.62,0,31427,john_j_loflin_jr,,338.793,339.204,Correct.
1969.62,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,339.204,339.838,That's the one?
1969.62,0,31427,john_j_loflin_jr,,339.838,344.358,Yes sir.
1969.62,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,546.712,552.69,Is that what you consider due process notice as -- is what you're talking about now?
1969.62,0,31427,john_j_loflin_jr,,552.69,560.487,Your Honor I believe that the due process as I see it begins at the point where the client is called in for the conference with the caseworker.
1969.62,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,560.487,572.127,So your idea of due process is that the caseworker calls the person and just two of them in the room and he gives them notice and that's the type of notice that still process notice?
1969.62,0,31427,john_j_loflin_jr,,572.127,573.867,That's where the process begins Your Honor.
1969.62,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,574.194,576.71,But is that a due process notice or not?
1969.62,0,31427,john_j_loflin_jr,,576.71,580.993,"For the purposes of this case, under these facts, I believe that it is, yes."
1969.62,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,580.993,587.331,"Well, how does that fit with the constitution of your idea of what due process is?"
1969.62,0,31427,john_j_loflin_jr,,591.714,602.362,I have accepted the fact that a welfare recipient faced with termination is entitled to due process appropriate to the circumstances.
1969.62,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,613.66,617.509,"Well, what is it similar to?"
1969.62,0,31427,john_j_loflin_jr,,621.735,624.052,There are many facets which are peculiar to welfare.
1969.62,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,624.769,630.587,"Do you have any other cases that you could cite to, other than a welfare case?"
1969.62,0,31427,john_j_loflin_jr,,630.587,642.383,"As was adverted to earlier this morning, it bears some resemblance to the cases where public employees have been called up on charges and suspended but later given an opportunity to be heard."
1969.62,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,646.98,657.579,But do you see any difference between a government employee making 20 thousand a year and a welfare worker as to be -- in able to live doing this due process period?
1969.62,0,31427,john_j_loflin_jr,,657.579,665.792,"Well, obviously the impact on the individual is much worse if we make an error in the case of someone who is destitute than if we make an error in the case of someone who is well off."
1969.62,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,666.493,670.932,"Well, why wouldn't you then be inclined to give them some due process?"
1969.62,0,31427,john_j_loflin_jr,,670.932,673.837,I definitely would be inclined and my position is that this --
1969.62,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,673.837,692.618,"Your idea of due process is that the caseworker that's investigated it and has made up his or her mind that this recipient doesn't deserve it anymore calls him in and gives him a notice and hearing and the termination, that's your idea of due process?"
1969.62,0,31427,john_j_loflin_jr,,692.618,698.167,I don't accept the hypothesis sir that the caseworker has a closed mind at the time he advised the client to come in.
1969.62,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,698.167,700.644,"Well, who investigated it?"
1969.62,0,31427,john_j_loflin_jr,,700.644,704.196,"It may be the caseworker, information may come from other sources."
1969.62,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,708.262,720.745,"Well, wouldn't the caseworker asked him to come in if the caseworker hadn't thought that there was bare possibility that perhaps the recipient might be wrong?"
1969.62,0,31427,john_j_loflin_jr,,720.745,725.624,That's the reason he is called in. the caseworker has some information which he wants clarified.
1969.62,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,735.065,742.711,"Well, a personal conference is nothing close to a due process hearing, isn't it?"
1969.62,0,31427,john_j_loflin_jr,,742.711,752.765,Your Honor I contend that it is part of a procedure which when taken in its entirety constitutes such basic fairness that it is due process of law.
1969.62,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,752.765,754.941,That's your idea of fairness?
1969.62,0,31427,john_j_loflin_jr,,754.941,763.261,"Taken altogether, it is my idea of fairness but not truncating it and chopping it off at one little chapter and saying, “Well, this is all the due process the person is going to get.”"
1969.62,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,768.951,771.44,"When the supervisor says, “It's alright”?"
1969.62,0,31427,john_j_loflin_jr,,771.44,772.612,No sir.
1969.62,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,772.612,774.169,"Well, when?"
1969.62,0,31427,john_j_loflin_jr,,774.169,775.854,We've had the meeting with the caseworker.
1969.62,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,806.278,807.921,That's your idea of due process?
1969.62,0,31427,john_j_loflin_jr,,807.921,810.592,"I think that meets due process, yes sir."
1969.62,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,810.592,832.734,"Mr. Loflin, I suppose up in Mariposa County where they have a few recipients and few staff members, it would be possible that the man who made the decision to grant the benefit in the first place might be the same man who listened to the recipient in this process you're describing."
1969.62,0,31427,john_j_loflin_jr,,832.734,835.992,New York regulation prevents those decisions being all --
1969.62,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,835.992,840.242,I'm transporting Mariposa in New York and I suppose that's not right.
1969.62,0,31427,john_j_loflin_jr,,840.242,840.949,I have to admit I'm not as (Voice Overlap) --
1969.62,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,840.949,841.73,Suppose you (Voice Overlap) --
1969.62,0,31427,john_j_loflin_jr,,841.73,843.535,-- with Mariposa County as might be.
1969.62,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,843.535,852.361,"A small community in New York that would not have a large staff of workers or a large number of recipients, if you have any such a community."
1969.62,0,31427,john_j_loflin_jr,,859.364,863.425,I believe that would not comply with the state regulation in New York (Voice Overlap) --
1969.62,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,863.425,864.147,Under the new regulation?
1969.62,0,31427,john_j_loflin_jr,,864.147,867.379,"Under the new regulation, that's right, whether it could happen, I can't tell you."
1969.62,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,933.849,936.824,"After the fair hearing is an opportunity for judicial review, is there not (Voice Overlap)?"
1969.62,0,31427,john_j_loflin_jr,,936.824,961.177,"Yes sir, under Article 78 of the New York Civil Practice Law and Rules, any decision of a hearing officer that results in a denial of benefits, the person whose benefits denied is considered an aggrieved person and he may sue the state hearing officer and have it -- the entire package, the record of the case reviewed by a State Supreme Court justice."
1969.62,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,983.332,990.904,Is there any way of knowing how long that time is on the average or in the typical situation?
1969.62,0,31427,john_j_loflin_jr,,990.904,997.701,"Well, there is evidence in the case that it varies tremendously."
1969.62,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1050.976,1051.937,And that's 50 days?
1969.62,0,31427,john_j_loflin_jr,,1051.937,1053.351,Yes sir.
1969.62,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1073.02,1075.493,Which are you rest in?
1969.62,0,31427,john_j_loflin_jr,,1075.493,1077.078,I will rest on either Your Honor.
1969.62,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1131.714,1143.701,"Well, I gather Mr. Loflin that like California, the city also concedes that constitutionally there is some obligation of some form of due process before termination may be made."
1969.62,0,31427,john_j_loflin_jr,,1143.701,1143.978,Yes.
1969.62,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1169.764,1175.368,Do you think that New York's procedure satisfies the federal law?
1969.62,0,31427,john_j_loflin_jr,,1175.368,1176.741,I do sir.
1969.62,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1177.68,1190.755,"I take the New York statute goes as far as, according to the due process, before the termination as the Solicitor General's brief?"
1969.62,0,31427,john_j_loflin_jr,,1190.755,1195.225,I believe it goes as far as the Solicitor General's brief says is required.
1969.62,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1214.85,1219.404,What is there that New York statute requires (Inaudible)?
1969.62,0,31427,john_j_loflin_jr,,1219.404,1226.794,"That comes up under our procedure 68-18, the local procedure adopted to implement the state regulation."
1969.62,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1226.794,1228.303,Under what paragraph?
1969.62,0,31427,john_j_loflin_jr,,1228.303,1229.86,Under paragraph (b).
1969.62,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1233.492,1236.681,(Inaudible)
1969.62,0,31427,john_j_loflin_jr,,1236.681,1237.184,Yes sir.
1969.62,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1314.663,1320.358,Do you state actual city procedure?
1969.62,0,31427,john_j_loflin_jr,,1320.358,1320.675,Yes sir.
1969.62,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1434.75,1447.65,"I noticed in this notice of decision, it says, “If you were to satisfy this decision, you may request a fair hearing in capital in writing or orally.”"
1969.62,0,31427,john_j_loflin_jr,,1454.444,1457.604,There is state law provisions for fair hearings but it -- the reason that --
1969.62,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1457.604,1461.405,Because if you used that term and does it define what it mean?
1969.62,0,31427,john_j_loflin_jr,,1461.405,1463.222,Yes sir it does.
1969.62,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1463.222,1466.505,Where is that?
1969.62,0,31427,john_j_loflin_jr,,1471.668,1478.145,"Well, the fair hearing requirement originates in federal law and any state plans submitted to the --"
1969.62,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1478.145,1481.221,You mean there's no definition of it in the state law?
1969.62,0,31427,john_j_loflin_jr,,1481.221,1482.213,"Yes sir, there is."
1969.62,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1483.684,1485.328,"Well, what is it in the state law?"
1969.62,0,31427,john_j_loflin_jr,,1485.328,1489.386,"Alright, that's easier for me."
1969.62,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1493.58,1498.223,"You're not talking about judgment now, what does the statute make a fair hearing?"
1969.62,0,31427,john_j_loflin_jr,,1498.223,1503.279,"There is a state hearing officer first of all, not a city official."
1969.62,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1552.519,1553.976,Does the statute require that?
1969.62,0,31427,john_j_loflin_jr,,1553.976,1556.198,The regulations require that sir.
1969.62,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1556.198,1559.725,He defines that as a part of a fair hearing?
1969.62,0,31427,john_j_loflin_jr,,1559.725,1561.684,That is correct sir.
1969.62,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1561.684,1562.475,But Mr. Loflin --
1969.62,0,31427,john_j_loflin_jr,,1562.475,1564.363,And finally a written decision comes down.
1969.62,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1564.363,1573.286,Isn't there in New York statute that says that you shall have a fair hearing in certain cases?
1969.62,0,31427,john_j_loflin_jr,,1573.286,1573.575,Yes.
1969.62,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1573.575,1576.325,Certain -- isn't there a statute that says just that?
1969.62,0,31427,john_j_loflin_jr,,1576.325,1578.001,Yes sir.
1969.62,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1578.001,1580.156,That's what I think Mr. Justice Black had.
1969.62,0,31427,john_j_loflin_jr,,1581.676,1583.284,I will give it to you subsequently.
1969.62,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1583.961,1595.573,What I want to know is what New York have said as a fair hearing cause I'm not familiar with that term in the constitution and I want to see it in the statute.
1969.62,0,31427,john_j_loflin_jr,,1595.573,1603.744,"I have reserved one or two minutes for rebuttal and when I rebut, I will give you the precise citation to the statute and to the regulations that give you the details."
1969.62,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1625.79,1626.047,Mr. Albert.
1969.62,1,34069,lee_a_albert,,1626.047,1629.99,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1969.62,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1656.265,1659.778,Are those the ones that you are trying to contest upon?
1969.62,1,34069,lee_a_albert,,1659.778,1666.976,Those I think are the situations Mr. Justice White that present the typical issues of a contested termination.
1969.62,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1669.812,1673.999,"How about my question, are those the ones that we have to decide on this case?"
1969.62,1,34069,lee_a_albert,,1673.999,1684.307,Those are certainly the people who still -- who -- but for this lawsuit and the injunction below are faced with the same kinds of termination problems that they already experienced.
1969.62,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1686.925,1692.954,I mean the change in the New York situation doesn't change anything?
1969.62,1,34069,lee_a_albert,,1692.954,1703.144,"Mr. Justice White, some of the interveners in this suit were actually terminated under the New York change, that is the Option B procedure the city wishes to reinstate by virtue of this appeal."
1969.62,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1703.144,1704.05,Some of it?
1969.62,1,34069,lee_a_albert,,1704.05,1705.378,That's correct Mr. Justice White.
1969.62,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1706.407,1711.085,"So which ones are we going to be arguing about, all of them or just some of them?"
1969.62,1,34069,lee_a_albert,,1711.085,1736.745,"I think Mr. Justice White, all of them present the kinds of that the -- and because they continue to receive welfare benefits and therefore are confronted with the same kinds of issues of termination or unlikely to be confronted with such issues very similar to a kind of union employer continuing relationship, one strike being settled doesn't necessarily solve all the legal problems for the future."
1969.62,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1819.409,1825.705,Were this under the -- were this action taken out on the procedures that are now before us?
1969.62,1,34069,lee_a_albert,,1825.705,1831.9,"Mr. Justice Stewart all the procedures except for -- well, some of them have taken place under all the procedures Mr. Justice Stewart."
1969.62,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1831.9,1832.979,"Well, I'm talking about this (Voice Overlap) --"
1969.62,1,34069,lee_a_albert,,1832.979,1835.541,"These particular ones, there was no Option B."
1969.62,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1835.541,1836.815,Exactly and that's (Voice Overlap) --
1969.62,1,34069,lee_a_albert,,1836.815,1837.786,And that opportunity --
1969.62,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1837.786,1848.722,"(Voice Overlap) my Brother White's question and what's before us now is Option B as part and parcel of a whole procedural process that's been described by counsel for the city, isn't that correct?"
1969.62,1,34069,lee_a_albert,,1848.722,1858.67,But Mr. Justice Stewart all -- the process that has been described by the city -- the city does not rely on Option B as a particularly important element.
1969.62,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1877.595,1878.098,Yes.
1969.62,1,34069,lee_a_albert,,1878.098,1899.649,"That one -- that several of the appellees did invoke in this case, for example, one of the appellees Antonio Sotto was terminated for he received a notice informing him failure to attend rehabilitation COC, and I should say Your Honors that that notice meant as much to him at that point as it may mean to you now."
1969.62,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1915.26,1923.522,"Well, wouldn't you think there was a reasonable administrative basis for some ambiguity on that notice so as not to --?"
1969.62,1,34069,lee_a_albert,,1923.522,1936.789,"The basis I think for the ambiguity is the fact that we're dealing with formed notices issued by caseworkers with very, very heavy caseloads and this is to be sure an assembly line type of operation in that regard."
1969.62,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1936.789,1947.213,"Yes, but he knows that his benefits are being at least questioned and he has already waited to find out what they have in mind by these symbols?"
1969.62,1,34069,lee_a_albert,,1947.213,1957.6,"Well, in fact in his particular case, he unlike most welfare recipients did have an attorney to assist them Mr. Chief Justice and his attorney found out the case unit to find out some information."
1969.62,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2007.446,2011.3,"Well, was his restoration retroactive?"
1969.62,1,34069,lee_a_albert,,2011.3,2017.533,His restoration probably was retroactive Mr. Chief Justice but I'm not clear on that.
1969.62,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2028.386,2038.407,Then his complaints have been redressed in that respect?
1969.62,1,34069,lee_a_albert,,2038.407,2043.232,His benefits were not terminated for any length of time because he was -- he did intervene in this lawsuit soon afterwards.
1969.62,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2113.659,2118.634,"Well, is this still a relevant problem for us?"
1969.62,1,34069,lee_a_albert,,2118.634,2119.746,A -- it most certainly is.
1969.62,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2119.746,2122.957,"Under the new regulations, under the change?"
1969.62,1,34069,lee_a_albert,,2122.957,2126.171,It most certainly is Mr. Chief Justice.
1969.62,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2126.733,2129.945,For this particular person?
1969.62,1,34069,lee_a_albert,,2133.098,2137.639,He was vindicated after this procedure was passed in the fair hearing.
1969.62,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2190.738,2197.432,Now did you say that -- because the due process (Inaudible) those words?
1969.62,1,34069,lee_a_albert,,2197.432,2197.888,No.
1969.62,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2207.708,2209.159,"That proceeding, doesn't it?"
1969.62,1,34069,lee_a_albert,,2209.159,2209.79,I'm sorry Mr. Justice Black.
1969.62,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2209.79,2212.736,Were that the proceedings required by law?
1969.62,1,34069,lee_a_albert,,2212.736,2214.827,"Without due process of law, without the proceedings --"
1969.62,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2214.827,2221.654,"(Voice Overlap) proceedings required by law or the proceedings, a majority of this Court might think were arbitrary or unreasonable?"
1969.62,1,34069,lee_a_albert,,2221.654,2222.56,"No, Mr. Justice Black."
1969.62,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2225.21,2227.504,They are used a number of times?
1969.62,1,34069,lee_a_albert,,2227.504,2234.043,With -- we're relying on the well-established obligation in the decisions of this Court.
1969.62,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2234.043,2243.363,Are you relying on obligations imposed by the language of the constitution outside of due process for this latitude and area in definition?
1969.62,1,34069,lee_a_albert,,2243.363,2258.177,We think that the procedural aspect of due process is not -- does not permit the latitude or leave the justices at bay in the sense that substantive due process may be said to.
1969.62,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2264.169,2265.41,"You mean, notice?"
1969.62,1,34069,lee_a_albert,,2265.41,2266.728,We -- I mean notice and the elements --
1969.62,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2266.728,2271.657,"No doubt the constitution uses the word “notice”, doesn't it?"
1969.62,1,34069,lee_a_albert,,2271.657,2281.573,"I think due process, its well accepted Mr. Justice Black but due process refers to a adversary proceeding proceeded by notice."
1969.62,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2281.573,2290.442,"The well-established thing you're talking about certainly had considerable questioning, come year to year and decade to decade during this century."
1969.62,1,34069,lee_a_albert,,2290.442,2303.64,"There may be some question as to what context, what it requires in certain context but I think the point here is that it's conceded Mr. Justice Black that the due process guarantees against our government arbitrariness and capriciousness apply to public assistance programs."
1969.62,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2307.179,2309.452,Do you mean it's not an issue between the parties?
1969.62,1,34069,lee_a_albert,,2309.452,2316.169,Nor is it an issue -- certainly its not an issue in the Government's view also in its memorandum and nor I think properly viewed --
1969.62,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2316.169,2317.833,Which a part of preposition --
1969.62,1,34069,lee_a_albert,,2317.833,2323.08,Certainly not Mr. Justice White and that is one of the reasons why we established that preposition de novo --
1969.62,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2323.08,2326.08,(Inaudible)
1969.62,1,34069,lee_a_albert,,2326.08,2328.276,I think -- I'm sorry Mr. Justice White.
1969.62,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2328.276,2335.038,"What are you going to think in response to this, don't you think in responding to Mr. Justice Black's question, we have to really --"
1969.62,1,34069,lee_a_albert,,2335.038,2337.486,"Say why it does, no question, I do."
1969.62,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2343.101,2353.538,Are you arguing that it's arbitrary and capricious for the Government to cutoff a gift or gratuity?
1969.62,1,34069,lee_a_albert,,2353.538,2357.533,I think one has to make some certain distinctions Mr. Justice Black.
1969.62,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2413.265,2419.579,"Well, that's quite a difference between what you are saying there and this law?"
1969.62,1,34069,lee_a_albert,,2419.579,2428.878,Mr. Justice Black I think it's very important that -- we recognize we're not dealing with the kind of program that you've mentioned regarding the civil war.
1969.62,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2428.878,2436.746,I would gather from your -- I would rather -- your argument be hard to repeal of gratuity once you've given it on the ground be to arbitrary and capricious.
1969.62,1,34069,lee_a_albert,,2436.746,2437.066,Not at all.
1969.62,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2437.066,2437.527,Mr. Albert the --
1969.62,1,34069,lee_a_albert,,2437.527,2438.587,I think the question of --
1969.62,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2438.587,2443.113,"Mr. Albert if you will bear the pending question in mind, we will recess at this time."
1969.62,1,34069,lee_a_albert,,2443.113,2459.356,Certainly Mr. Chief Justice.
1969.62,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2459.356,2473.405,"Before we resume arguments, we will again entertain the motion of Mr. Hill."
1969.62,1,34069,lee_a_albert,,2479.073,2480.978,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1969.62,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2522.448,2525.749,What's the closest case in this Court for that preposition?
1969.62,1,34069,lee_a_albert,,2525.749,2542.32,I think that factor of gravity of harm Mr. Justice White is reflected in for example the deportation of alien cases in which the agency is held to the highest degree of procedural safeguards before an alien may be deported though he has no vested right to remain here.
1969.62,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2546.862,2548.669,"What about Fleming and Nestor, is it --"
1969.62,1,34069,lee_a_albert,,2548.669,2554.706,Fleming and Nestor refers to -- the question in Fleming -- Fleming and Nestor is support for our proposition.
1969.62,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2589.382,2590.016,Of course --
1969.62,1,34069,lee_a_albert,,2590.016,2591.431,Programs exist.
1969.62,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2591.431,2592.297,"Excuse me, you finish."
1969.62,1,34069,lee_a_albert,,2592.297,2593.777,I'm sorry Mr. Justice Stewart.
1969.62,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2593.777,2616.48,"It just occurred to me that the deportation process is final and they're irrevocable so far as the administrative process goes, whereas, this is not, this is subject to a so-called fair hearing review in which as I understand it, you concede all of the due process qualities that you're asserting are necessary are in fact accorded."
1969.62,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2675.871,2678.954,"Of course that could lead to quite a different inference also, couldn't it?"
1969.62,1,34069,lee_a_albert,,2691.956,2704.801,"It certainly could Mr. Justice Stewart except for the -- what we do, except for the fact that we have figures in this record and no one really argues about them at the rate of administrative error in denying or terminating aid is enormous."
1969.62,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2839.122,2843.803,What about the voluntary legal aid program in New York?
1969.62,1,34069,lee_a_albert,,2843.803,2851.576,"Mr. Justice Marshall, there's nothing one can do about the systematic sustained delay in the fair hearing process."
1969.62,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2856.647,2862.105,"(Voice Overlap) with your point that they didn't have money enough to process their appeal, that was all I was (Voice Overlap) --"
1969.62,1,34069,lee_a_albert,,2862.105,2863.049,I'm sorry Mr. Justice Marshall.
1969.62,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2908.992,2910.81,What are those one or two issues?
1969.62,1,34069,lee_a_albert,,2910.81,2912.169,How -- I'm sorry Mr. Justice Black.
1969.62,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2912.169,2913.635,"I said, what are those one and two issues?"
1969.62,1,34069,lee_a_albert,,2913.635,2917.193,Those one and two issues fall into several categories.
1969.62,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2963.555,2969.9,What must be the financial condition of the person in New York to be eligible for this list?
1969.62,1,34069,lee_a_albert,,2969.9,2970.24,One cannot --
1969.62,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2970.24,2974.808,And how much does he get?
1969.62,1,34069,lee_a_albert,,2974.808,2980.822,"He gets an average grant Mr. Justice Black for approximately $60 to 65$ a month, somewhat less for children."
1969.62,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3042.38,3048.495,Did you say Mr. Albert that there are some states that provide trial type hearings before termination?
1969.62,1,34069,lee_a_albert,,3048.495,3049.654,I certainly did Mr. Justice Brennan.
1969.62,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3049.654,3050.755,How many are there?
1969.62,1,34069,lee_a_albert,,3050.755,3055.902,"There are approximately four or five pursuant to court orders who are agreements, stipulations during the course of (Voice Overlap) --"
1969.62,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3055.902,3057.217,You mean all states?
1969.62,1,34069,lee_a_albert,,3057.217,3059.676,New York State is the best example of that.
1969.62,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3211.703,3220.666,"Well, I take it that the content of the hearing you urge goes beyond what the Federal Government thinks is warranted."
1969.62,1,34069,lee_a_albert,,3220.666,3225.651,The Federal Government isn't talking about a hearing Mr. Justice White when it talks about the advanced notice of questions.
1969.62,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3234.01,3235.502,I take it though that -- you would also --
1969.62,1,34069,lee_a_albert,,3235.502,3236.182,We're talk --
1969.62,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3236.182,3239.86,You would also go beyond what the District Court said was required (Voice Overlap)?
1969.62,1,34069,lee_a_albert,,3239.86,3241.239,Absolutely not Mr. Justice White.
1969.62,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3276.317,3279.027,"Well, then what if the -- what if there's a conflict on the evidence?"
1969.62,1,34069,lee_a_albert,,3279.027,3287.309,"Where there is -- where the termination, which is not all the cases Mr. Justice White rest entirely on third party information, the landlady said “blank.”"
1969.62,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3287.309,3288.409,"Or on part, yeah."
1969.62,1,34069,lee_a_albert,,3288.409,3297.439,"Or in part, well, alright, or in part and not substantiated by other documentary evidence that say to third parties."
1969.62,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3309.947,3313.188,I didn't think the District Court would go that far in all cases.
1969.62,1,34069,lee_a_albert,,3313.188,3320.012,"In cases it said, “Where the veracity -- where the evidence depends on the veracity or credibility of third parties.”"
1969.62,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3320.012,3321.548,Or it's critical to the case?
1969.62,1,34069,lee_a_albert,,3321.548,3323.514,"And critical to the case, yes."
1969.62,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3326.885,3333.822,"Well, what about the situation where there are no factual -- or just a questioning of the law or a question of the (Voice Overlap) or something like that?"
1969.62,1,34069,lee_a_albert,,3333.822,3341.337,"This -- well, this issue really is not involved in this case there's not one of the appellees who raisethe question of law."
1969.62,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3399.088,3410.853,"I take it that if a -- if you've got the kind of a hearing prior to termination, prior to the termination that you want, that would be the end of the matter as far as the -- that state's due process."
1969.62,1,34069,lee_a_albert,,3410.853,3420.865,"Certainly as far as the Due Process Clause in the constitution is concerned, we are not asking for two hearings, we are not asking for appeals, we don't care if the hearing examiner salary is paid by the city or the state."
1969.62,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3476.088,3482.298,"Well, would you say that if you prevail a fortiori, the same would apply to city employees?"
1969.62,1,34069,lee_a_albert,,3482.298,3483.366,"Absolutely not, first --"
1969.62,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3483.366,3484.129,Why not?
1969.62,1,34069,lee_a_albert,,3484.129,3508.211,"Well, for factors one observed in Cafeteria Workers against McElroy, the Government engaged in a managerial function as employer to the discretionary kinds of decisions which are slightly different and three, the question of a suspension of an employee may well fall into one of those extraordinary situations laid out by this Court where for example, the employee represents some immediate threat to the service or the department."
1969.62,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3509.5,3519.163,(Voice Overlap) -- I asked you about the ordinary case where the ordinary employee know unusual circumstances except someone just wants to fire you.
1969.62,1,34069,lee_a_albert,,3529.78,3535.046,"There might be at least the requirement of -- as indeed, there's the practice in the federal civil service --"
1969.62,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3535.046,3537.624,But if you prevail that would be more likely that the (Voice Overlap) --
1969.62,1,34069,lee_a_albert,,3537.624,3540.374,I don't -- but I think an important -- I agree with you Mr. Justice White.
1969.62,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3563.262,3565.025,"I think that is going beyond the response, unless there are other questions."
1969.62,1,34069,lee_a_albert,,3565.025,3567.075,I'm sorry.
1969.62,2,31427,john_j_loflin_jr,,3793.034,3794.487,If the Court please.
1969.62,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3829.585,3830.714,What page was that?
1969.62,2,31427,john_j_loflin_jr,,3830.714,3836.196,It follows page 160 of the record.
1969.62,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3903.892,3910.125,Is there anything in there that proscribes exactly when the hearings have taken place?
1969.62,2,31427,john_j_loflin_jr,,3910.125,3915.197,"Well, under federal regulations, they're supposed to take place and be completed within 60 days."
1969.62,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3919.755,3921.318,That is for termination?
1969.62,2,31427,john_j_loflin_jr,,3921.318,3922.498,Yes sir.
