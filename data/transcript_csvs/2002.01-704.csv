2002.01-704,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,7.335,12.097,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2002.01-704,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,48.44,48.958,Mr. Kneedler--
2002.01-704,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,48.958,49.341,--Yes.
2002.01-704,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,49.341,51.528,--you call it a statutory bar.
2002.01-704,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,85.643,86.056,Yes.
2002.01-704,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,92.598,94.66,"That's our holding in Roberts, isn't it?"
2002.01-704,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,94.66,95.446,Yes.

2002.01-704,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1268.295,1273.314,"Well, now, did your client seek to proceed before the Secretary?"
2002.01-704,1,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1273.314,1273.757,Yes.
2002.01-704,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1293.356,1297.18,"Well, this was not a personal conversation between the two, I take it."
2002.01-704,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3039.488,3048.971,"Mr. Chief Justice, the argument that the Secretary could have granted relief was never raised below in this case."
2002.01-704,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3064.403,3068.685,"No, but his point, and actually although he raised it late, is certainly a factor."
2002.01-704,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3123.795,3125.983,"--Well, I... first of all, I think it is wrong."
2002.01-704,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3130.191,3132.354,"Well, maybe we'd reach a different--"
2002.01-704,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3132.354,3132.553,--Right.
2002.01-704,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3132.553,3133.564,--The disposition would be one thing--
2002.01-704,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3133.564,3133.779,Right.
2002.01-704,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3133.779,3136.008,"--but he's saying, that's really what the heart of this is about."
2002.01-704,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3136.008,3142.091,"There's... first of all, let me make another point which I think goes very much to the Secretary's authority."
2002.01-704,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3197.214,3201.633,What is the authority for saying that's a general principle of appropriations law?
