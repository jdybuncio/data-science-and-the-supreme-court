1969.45,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,55.804,"Number 45, Anderson's-Blackrock against Pavement Salvage Company."
1969.45,0,15440,alan_w_borst,,58.458,60.354,Thank you sir.
1969.45,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,371.197,372.923,"There's is no process patent involved here though, is it, just two products?"
1969.45,0,15440,alan_w_borst,,372.923,378.235,"There is no process claims, just apparatus claims."
1969.45,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,518.072,525.219,"How much of the prior art upon which you now rely was available in the patent office, all of it?"
1969.45,0,15440,alan_w_borst,,525.219,535.006,All of it but the so-called Morcom patent which I am about to come to.
1969.45,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,748.905,755.552,It's your submission that this is not a combination but rather says simply an aggregation?
1969.45,0,15440,alan_w_borst,,755.552,755.783,Yes.
1969.45,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,763.581,766.161,Selection of (Voice Overlap) The collection of other -- the collection of known ingredients?
1969.45,0,15440,alan_w_borst,,766.161,768.162,"Right, yes sir."
1969.45,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,768.162,779.743,"But technically, it is your claim that this is an aggregation and I understand your submission is that the law is that a mere aggregation is never patentable."
1969.45,0,15440,alan_w_borst,,787.391,791.752,"That is our position, perfectly stated Your Honor."
1969.45,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1240.207,1246.532,"When you supply to us by memorandum that the close of your argument as well, you may discuss the cases now but I will supply the citation."
1969.45,0,15440,alan_w_borst,,1246.532,1251.589,"All right, I will do it."
1969.45,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1319.799,1333.209,"Mr. Borst, I have the knowdghe am not the lawyer to know how similar or how different it is the British Law patents from our law or the British Law of 1890 from our Law of 1969."
1969.45,0,15440,alan_w_borst,,1343.2,1352.203,It may be hard to generalize because much of our law has undergone transformation or modification of statute.
1969.45,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1386.583,1394.468,"I suppose in Great Britain, is Patent Law a Common Law so to speak or are there a series of statutes as we have?"
1969.45,0,15440,alan_w_borst,,1394.468,1412.004,There are patent statutes but which have been construed and so the law has evolved through construction as our law has evolved by amendment to statute.
1969.45,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1412.004,1415.799,"Of course, we, unlike them have a constitutional provision that we sometimes cross over."
1969.45,0,15440,alan_w_borst,,1415.799,1420.6,That is true.
1969.45,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1474.908,1475.816,By the what?
1969.45,0,15440,alan_w_borst,,1475.816,1478.627,Collocation of the integers.
1969.45,1,43990,walter_j_blenko_jr,,1740.874,1744.564,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the court."
1969.45,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1814.51,1815.816,What you say 22 A?
1969.45,1,43990,walter_j_blenko_jr,,1815.816,1829.954,"26 A, Mr. Justice, the last paragraph commencing about eight lines from the bottom of the page."
1969.45,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1840.563,1843.199,(Inaudible)
1969.45,1,43990,walter_j_blenko_jr,,1843.199,1859.25,I want to carry a little bit further if I may because the evidence which we pointed to in the Court of Appeals and which we point to here is in our submission undisputed and is the other way.
1969.45,2,15440,alan_w_borst,,3499.355,3507.272,Petitioner refers to Era Oil's ads as extolling some part of this invention.
1969.45,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3540.573,3549.769,I noticed that there are three expert witnesses here who testified rather explicitly that this was not obvious to them.
1969.45,2,15440,alan_w_borst,,3561.414,3567.251,They testified that there was no invention here because they --
1969.45,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3567.251,3568.433,That is a conclusion of law.
1969.45,2,15440,alan_w_borst,,3568.433,3570.094,"That, of course, the conclusion."
1969.45,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3580.16,3584.184,"Well, of course the use of radiant energy is used on football players and baseball players."
1969.45,2,15440,alan_w_borst,,3584.184,3586.657,I overstated.
1969.45,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3604.411,3607.556,"I think that is your time, Mr. Borst."
