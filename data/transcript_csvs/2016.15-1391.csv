2016.15-1391,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.445,"We will hear argument first this morning in Case 15-1391, Expressions Hair Design v. Schneiderman. Mr. Gupta."
2016.15-1391,0,20895,deepak_gupta,,7.445,26.4,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This case is about whether the State may criminalize truthful speech that merchants believe is their most effective way of communicating the hidden cost of credit cards to their customers. By design, New York's law suppresses the message that you pay more --"
2016.15-1391,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,26.4,27.19,I'm sorry.
2016.15-1391,0,20895,deepak_gupta,,45.41,48.15,"No -- well, they do, Your Honor. They all want to do the same thing."
2016.15-1391,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,87.44,91.5,"That's not what I understood, but your adversary can tell me."
2016.15-1391,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,91.5,96.6,"Mr. Gupta, what -- what speech precisely do you think is being restricted?"
2016.15-1391,0,20895,deepak_gupta,,96.6,112.73,"The -- the message that when you use a credit card, you're paying more, and to be more precise, I think if you look at Joint Appendix 103 through 104, you'll find there the supplemental declaration of Expressions Hair Design where they say exactly what they'd like to do."
2016.15-1391,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,130.18,137.97,"Well, I guess that's why I said like what speech precisely, and you said the message that you're going to pay more if you use a credit card."
2016.15-1391,0,20895,deepak_gupta,,137.97,138.69,Right.
2016.15-1391,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,138.69,146.42,"But, you know, as -- this -- this statute is not written in terms of speech, it's -- it's written in terms of imposing a surcharge."
2016.15-1391,0,20895,deepak_gupta,,161.49,161.905,Uh-huh.
2016.15-1391,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,161.905,166.05,"And -- and the cashier says, oh, no."
2016.15-1391,0,20895,deepak_gupta,,174.485,175.0,Uh-huh.
2016.15-1391,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,175.0,177.955,"Now, would that violate this law?"
2016.15-1391,0,20895,deepak_gupta,,177.955,182.39,"I -- you know, I don't know, and what -- part of the difficulty is -- and the reason, we have a vagueness challenge --"
2016.15-1391,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,182.39,184.08,You don't know? How would it violate the law?
2016.15-1391,0,20895,deepak_gupta,,184.08,185.36,I don't think -- I don't think it would.
2016.15-1391,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,187.75,188.67,You don't think it would.
2016.15-1391,0,20895,deepak_gupta,,188.67,189.32,I don't think it would.
2016.15-1391,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,189.32,192.975,Even though you're describing something as a surcharge.
2016.15-1391,0,20895,deepak_gupta,,215.92,221.25,"Well, I think the way this law works is that you can engage in precisely the same conduct."
2016.15-1391,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,233.23,235.46,"See, that's what you keep -- you -- you said that again --"
2016.15-1391,0,20895,deepak_gupta,,235.46,235.55,Right.
2016.15-1391,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,235.55,247.81,"-- and I think my hypothetical was designed to show that that's just not right. I mean, I can imagine ways in which you might say that this is restricting speech, but that's not it."
2016.15-1391,0,20895,deepak_gupta,,271.82,292.15,"I -- I don't think so, Justice Kagan, and I think in your hypothetical -- the -- it -- in your hypothetical, the merchant hasn't telegraphed to the consumer at the same time the two prices, right? That's not what our clients want to engage in. If -- if New York wants to continue to enforce this statute against deceptive practices or false advertising, we have no problem with that."
2016.15-1391,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,299.79,300.77,They want to do more.
2016.15-1391,0,20895,deepak_gupta,,303.04,303.55,No.
2016.15-1391,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,303.77,309.17,Then what's the problem with saying -- you -- you don't -- you're too young to know what the OPA was.
2016.15-1391,0,20895,deepak_gupta,,309.17,313.12,"I think -- I think so, Justice Breyer. (Laughter.)"
2016.15-1391,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,313.12,315.45,It's called the Office of Price Administration.
2016.15-1391,0,20895,deepak_gupta,,315.45,315.98,Right.
2016.15-1391,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,315.98,318.715,Ken Galbraith ran it for awhile.
2016.15-1391,0,20895,deepak_gupta,,323.94,324.29,Mm-hmm.
2016.15-1391,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,324.29,337.885,"And after they said that in World War II, you couldn't charge a higher price. Would you have come in and said, Ken Galbraith says you can only charge $13 for this item. It violates our free speech."
2016.15-1391,0,20895,deepak_gupta,,337.885,339.25,Absolutely --
2016.15-1391,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,339.25,340.895,Because we want to charge $15.
2016.15-1391,0,20895,deepak_gupta,,340.895,342.53,"Absolutely not, Justice Breyer."
2016.15-1391,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,342.53,346.715,"And very well what this statute says is, you can't impose a surcharge."
2016.15-1391,0,20895,deepak_gupta,,348.59,349.03,Right.
2016.15-1391,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,349.03,350.03,And you want to.
2016.15-1391,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,350.03,356.73,"What's that got to do with speech? I grant you, all business activity takes place through speech."
2016.15-1391,0,20895,deepak_gupta,,356.73,357.275,Right.
2016.15-1391,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,357.275,360.01,So explain to me what it's got to do with speech.
2016.15-1391,0,20895,deepak_gupta,,360.01,363.08,"And I agree, if you look at this statute, it doesn't scream First Amendment probably --"
2016.15-1391,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,363.08,365.21,"Not only doesn't it scream it, I want to know --"
2016.15-1391,0,20895,deepak_gupta,,365.21,365.56,Right.
2016.15-1391,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,365.56,372.96,"Unless you want to say whenever a businessman is regulated in what he can do, or she --"
2016.15-1391,0,20895,deepak_gupta,,372.96,373.745,Mm-hmm.
2016.15-1391,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,374.64,378.77,-- that violates the First Amendment or at least potentially because they do it through speech.
2016.15-1391,0,20895,deepak_gupta,,378.77,379.13,Right.
2016.15-1391,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,385.53,387.12,I don't see that in the statute.
2016.15-1391,0,20895,deepak_gupta,,390.68,390.87,Well --
2016.15-1391,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,390.87,398.815,"But you can charge a discount. Now, I know, Paul MacAvoy, I hate to bring up these long-gone names, but he was an economist with whom I wrote a book."
2016.15-1391,0,20895,deepak_gupta,,404.18,404.725,Right.
2016.15-1391,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,404.725,415.05,"But we live in a world that not everybody is an economist, and many people think it's quite a different thing, and there are a lot of studies in this thing that the -- you know, that said it was a different thing."
2016.15-1391,0,20895,deepak_gupta,,416.57,417.13,Certainly -- right.
2016.15-1391,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,421.47,423.395,Not in the way -- you have the regular price.
2016.15-1391,0,20895,deepak_gupta,,428.605,436.56,"But in this case, both sides agree the way the regular price is -- is defined is in relation to how you communicate that."
2016.15-1391,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,466.54,467.35,Can I go back to --
2016.15-1391,0,20895,deepak_gupta,,467.35,467.735,Plus --
2016.15-1391,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,467.735,470.76,-- Justice Kagan's hypothetical.
2016.15-1391,0,20895,deepak_gupta,,482.815,483.145,Right.
2016.15-1391,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,483.145,488.85,"And in her hypothetical, she says the sticker price is the higher price."
2016.15-1391,0,20895,deepak_gupta,,528.595,535.385,I think if New York -- it's not mandated speech in the sense they haven't told us precisely what to say.
2016.15-1391,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,535.385,547.945,"Well, under that interpretation, if it's okay to post the higher price and nothing more, and if the higher price is the credit card price, they are -- they are forcing the merchant to speak in a particular way."
2016.15-1391,0,20895,deepak_gupta,,547.945,558.12,I think what they are doing is -- they are -- they are forcing the merchant to speak in a particular way in the sense that you have to characterize the price difference a certain way in order to comply with the statute.
2016.15-1391,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,558.12,565.61,"Mr. Gupta, this exchange -- I mean, I think that these are two very different theories of what makes this a speech restriction."
2016.15-1391,0,20895,deepak_gupta,,623.21,626.55,I think our theory is what you just described.
2016.15-1391,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,626.55,626.84,The latter one.
2016.15-1391,0,20895,deepak_gupta,,626.84,640.0,"But I think Justice Alito is not wrong that if -- it would certainly implicate First Amendment concerns if the -- if the State were to say, here is how you have to display your prices."
2016.15-1391,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,647.74,657.035,"Counselor, can I -- I'm -- part of -- I'm a little bit like Justice Alito and less than Justice Kagan."
2016.15-1391,0,20895,deepak_gupta,,668.31,668.71,Well --
2016.15-1391,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,668.71,686.2,"The statute simply says, ""No seller in any sales transaction may impose a surcharge on a holder who elects to use a credit card in lieu of payment by cash, check, or similar means."" To me, it's very simple: One price for everything."
2016.15-1391,0,20895,deepak_gupta,,686.2,687.14,"Well, Justice Kagan --"
2016.15-1391,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,687.14,717.43,"You walk in and -- forget about -- I don't know where they get the discount from or that the statute permits that, because what it says on its -- to me, on its plain terms is one price. And you told Justice Breyer that that was okay. Certainly would be -- I'm hard-pressed to see if that's the interpretation given to what I view as the plain meaning of the statute, that that would be unconstitutional."
2016.15-1391,0,20895,deepak_gupta,,717.43,728.05,"But this is not a statute that functions in a vacuum; right? And in the other States that enacted statutes at the same time, some of them put in their text a surcharge is okay; a surcharge is not okay --"
2016.15-1391,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,728.05,728.48,New York didn't.
2016.15-1391,0,20895,deepak_gupta,,728.48,734.95,"-- a discount is not okay. New York didn't, but it -- but everyone has agreed that it has been interpreted in parallel with those statutes."
2016.15-1391,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,735.06,740.41,"Well, this is a really nice agreement, except the State below had two different interpretations."
2016.15-1391,0,20895,deepak_gupta,,740.41,751.89,But the -- but the State has never wavered from its interpretation that framing the price difference as a -- as a discount is perfectly permissible under this regime. And you don't have to take my word for it and look only at the text of the statute.
2016.15-1391,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,785.43,806.5,"And you tell me that that's what the State is going to tell me, that if they post credit card price 2.10, cash price $2, that if the cash -- if the person comes to the cashier and gives them a credit card, the cashier is going to say, you know you're paying a surcharge of 10 cents; you're going -- you're going to be prosecuted for that?"
2016.15-1391,0,20895,deepak_gupta,,806.5,813.16,"Well, the State can try to run away from the enforcement history, but I think it would be very difficult to run away from the most recent enforcement history."
2016.15-1391,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,871.2,871.55,"Now, does your --"
2016.15-1391,0,20895,deepak_gupta,,871.55,873.1,-- this statute is regulating nothing but speech.
2016.15-1391,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,873.1,899.91,"Does your argument depend upon the fact that there is no difference from the consumer's perspective if he sees this product is $100, come in and buy it, and then he gets to the cash register and there's a surcharge, no, it's $103, and it's $100, he goes to the cash register, pays cash, and they say, well, happy you, it's $97? And is your argument that a consumer sees no difference in those two situations?"
2016.15-1391,0,20895,deepak_gupta,,899.91,900.43,No.
2016.15-1391,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,900.96,908.585,Can you agree with the -- the State that that is -- could be to some extent misleading as far as the consumer --
2016.15-1391,0,20895,deepak_gupta,,908.585,909.2,I think --
2016.15-1391,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,909.2,909.7,-- is concerned?
2016.15-1391,0,20895,deepak_gupta,,909.7,912.93,I think it's really important to understand that this is an as-applied challenge.
2016.15-1391,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,929.88,930.59,"Well, under your --"
2016.15-1391,0,20895,deepak_gupta,,930.59,930.96,-- challenge.
2016.15-1391,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,930.96,933.08,Under your -- under your argument -- I just want to understand.
2016.15-1391,0,20895,deepak_gupta,,940.45,958.88,"I think if the State wants to have a regime where they think it's a deceptive practice because you aren't telling people the -- the higher price or the -- the price difference at the same time, and that people are hoodwinked or there's bait and switch, they are perfectly free to do that."
2016.15-1391,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,987.935,1003.79,"I'm going to say when I first read this statute without knowing anything about the background with the Federal statute or reading the briefs or the Second Circuit opinion, I interpreted it the way Justice Sotomayor did, that it mandates a single price."
2016.15-1391,0,20895,deepak_gupta,,1030.585,1034.395,"Well, the State of New York didn't ask for certification below."
2016.15-1391,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1106.9,1109.1,"Well, now, this is exactly what's worrying me."
2016.15-1391,0,20895,deepak_gupta,,1120.255,1120.89,You can --
2016.15-1391,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1120.89,1123.57,"But they did say, you can do exactly the same thing?"
2016.15-1391,0,20895,deepak_gupta,,1123.57,1124.11,Exactly.
2016.15-1391,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1125.52,1127.78,"Did they say, do exactly the same thing --"
2016.15-1391,0,20895,deepak_gupta,,1127.78,1128.11,Yes.
2016.15-1391,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1128.11,1130.405,-- or did they say you can have a discount?
2016.15-1391,0,20895,deepak_gupta,,1130.405,1132.77,They said you can charge more all you want.
2016.15-1391,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1132.77,1134.06,You can charge more all you want.
2016.15-1391,0,20895,deepak_gupta,,1134.06,1135.92,You just have to call it a discount.
2016.15-1391,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1135.92,1137.51,Did they say call it a discount?
2016.15-1391,0,20895,deepak_gupta,,1137.51,1137.95,Yes.
2016.15-1391,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1137.95,1152.98,"So what we are doing here is we are taking all the principles which are important of a First Amendment case and we are going to apply them speedy determination not as applied, you know, across the board."
2016.15-1391,0,20895,deepak_gupta,,1193.625,1196.11,"Justice Breyer, I understand the concern."
2016.15-1391,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1248.83,1258.175,"Mr. Gupta, you're putting really a lot of emphasis on a few cases in which prosecutors describe the law in a certain way."
2016.15-1391,0,20895,deepak_gupta,,1278.03,1278.39,Right.
2016.15-1391,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1278.39,1281.195,Let's take that out of the picture.
2016.15-1391,0,20895,deepak_gupta,,1318.855,1319.89,"Well, the law --"
2016.15-1391,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1319.89,1325.66,"The law says, you know, this is all about listing, you know, conduct; what you can charge."
2016.15-1391,0,20895,deepak_gupta,,1325.66,1327.91,But the law also means what it means on the ground.
2016.15-1391,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1348.15,1364.01,"Well, New York is saying in its brief that that's not the case; that you can say what you want to say; that you can call this a surcharge; that you can communicate in the way you want to communicate as long as your listed price is the -- is the credit card price."
2016.15-1391,0,20895,deepak_gupta,,1364.01,1365.33,But that makes it impossible.
2016.15-1391,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1378.19,1381.14,So you think the Federal law was unconstitutional as well.
2016.15-1391,0,20895,deepak_gupta,,1381.14,1383.83,"I think the Federal law was unconstitutional, too."
2016.15-1391,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1385.97,1388.08,Were there any prosecutions under the Federal?
2016.15-1391,0,20895,deepak_gupta,,1388.08,1388.7,There were not.
2016.15-1391,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1420.21,1427.925,"As far as discounts are concerned, is there some protection that the merchant can offer a discount?"
2016.15-1391,0,20895,deepak_gupta,,1427.925,1433.32,"That the merchant can offer a discount; in other words, can they do that under this statute? Is that --"
2016.15-1391,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1433.32,1436.665,No. I thought that there was some legislation that permitted --
2016.15-1391,0,20895,deepak_gupta,,1436.665,1452.51,"There's Federal legislation that says that it is a violation of the statute to have private ordering that forbids a discount and that's why what you had, Justice Ginsburg, were contract rules that made it illegal for merchants to frame the price difference as a surcharge."
2016.15-1391,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1459.985,1461.165,I'm sorry.
2016.15-1391,0,20895,deepak_gupta,,1463.16,1463.39,Yes.
2016.15-1391,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1463.39,1472.74,"You said if you take the statute, if you understand the statute to just mean that the listed price has to be the credit card price, that looks like a disclosure regime."
2016.15-1391,0,20895,deepak_gupta,,1473.975,1474.65,Sure.
2016.15-1391,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1525.17,1532.28,"Thank you, counsel. We'll afford you a minute for rebuttal."
2016.15-1391,0,20895,deepak_gupta,,1532.28,1542.57,Okay.
2016.15-1391,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1542.57,1549.15,Mr. Feigin?
2016.15-1391,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1549.15,1594.03,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I want to focus on what I take to be the core of the First Amendment dispute between the parties, which I think centers around a merchant who, for example, wants to label a soda as costing $1.95 with a 5 percent credit card surcharge, and the question is whether the State can require the merchant to specifically identify a price of $2.05 before charging a customer who wants to use a credit card that amount. A law like that is very similar to a law that simply regulates pricing or requires a merchant to honor their offers to make or enter into a contract of the sort that we normally wouldn't think is subject to any First Amendment scrutiny."
2016.15-1391,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1638.27,1658.62,"Mr. Feigin, could you get more concrete for me? Take the list of four ways that they would like to advertise in the reply brief. Which ways do you think -- or would the New York law potentially or actually make any of this conduct illegal?"
2016.15-1391,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1658.62,1662.41,"Your Honor, I don't think I can answer that question as to the New York law."
2016.15-1391,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1662.75,1663.37,Why?
2016.15-1391,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1663.37,1668.23,Because I think we lack a definitive interpretation from the New York court of appeals.
2016.15-1391,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1700.27,1700.44,Fine.
2016.15-1391,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1710.61,1716.1,"Option A, where it's a $10 cash price, $10.20 credit price, would be fine."
2016.15-1391,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1728.25,1729.44,10 -- you would have to say $10.20.
2016.15-1391,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1729.44,1729.98,Correct.
2016.15-1391,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1730.38,1738.08,"So that's regulating speech; it's not regulating price, because it's the same price whether -- I can do that math."
2016.15-1391,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1738.08,1745.72,The -- that is why we think that this is better viewed as a speech regulation under this Court's precedence. But let me explain why I think it's a reasonable disclosure.
2016.15-1391,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1745.72,1747.095,Finish this -- all right.
2016.15-1391,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1747.095,1756.94,"Option C, Your Honor, which is $10, 2 percent surcharge, would be the same as Option B, you'd actually have to say $10.20."
2016.15-1391,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1770.205,1777.015,"And -- and your understanding of why it is a speech regulation, it -- is because it affects the way you list prices; is that right?"
2016.15-1391,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1777.015,1801.52,"That's right, Your Honor. So a law, for example, that simply required a merchant who made a particular representation that the price of this item is $1.95 and required that merchant to honor -- and that was all the merchant said, didn't say anything about surcharges at all, and the law simply required the merchant to honor that price when the consumer gets to the cash register, that's an economic regulation."
2016.15-1391,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1827.74,1827.99,"Well, but --"
2016.15-1391,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1827.99,1830.76,"If I could, I'd like to address what's constitutionally permissible --"
2016.15-1391,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1830.76,1840.79,-- what is your position as to the constitutionality of prohibiting Options B and C in the pastrami sandwich example on --
2016.15-1391,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1840.79,1849.345,"Well, Your Honor, first of all, I wouldn't characterize it as prohibiting Options B and C, but simply requiring an additional disclosure."
2016.15-1391,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1872.54,1876.46,That's a very -- that's a very patronizing approach.
2016.15-1391,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1883.84,1886.64,"And let me explain why, Your Honor."
2016.15-1391,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1891.655,1896.275,"I thought it was $10 and 2 cents, but I'll think about that while -- (Laughter.)"
2016.15-1391,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1896.275,1902.2,I think there are two reasons why it's reasonable for a legislature to decide that if it's requiring --
2016.15-1391,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1902.2,1902.35,"Yeah, right."
2016.15-1391,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1902.35,1912.82,"-- a disclosure of the facts that the credit card price is going to be higher, it can require that disclosure to be made in dollars-and-cents form rather than a mathematical formula. First, the price --"
2016.15-1391,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1912.82,1922.125,"Oh, no, I thought you were telling me that they -- that it's not enough. Even if it's in cash, if they say that's a 20 -- 20-cent surcharge, that violates the statute."
2016.15-1391,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1922.125,1927.22,"Your Honor, if all they said was $10 price and 20-cent surcharge --"
2016.15-1391,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1927.22,1927.76,Right.
2016.15-1391,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1927.76,1937.67,"-- and they don't say $10.20 credit card price, that, as we understand it, would be a violation of the Federal statute. But let me please explain why."
2016.15-1391,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1937.67,1946.53,"Now, if -- if that -- if -- if B or C as stated are a violation of the New York statute, in your view, is that a violation of the First Amendment?"
2016.15-1391,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1946.53,1948.94,"It is not, and I think for two reasons."
2016.15-1391,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1948.94,1950.905,Even though this is truthful information.
2016.15-1391,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1950.905,1955.44,"All that's required -- Your Honor, it's not prohibiting them from saying what's in Options B and C."
2016.15-1391,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1978.56,1978.98,"Hold on -- now, hold on."
2016.15-1391,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1988.07,1991.87,"And the second reason, Your Honor, I think addresses that concern directly. (Laughter.)"
2016.15-1391,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1991.87,1999.32,Which is that there is -- which is that there is an administrability concern here.
2016.15-1391,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1999.32,2000.09,There's an --
2016.15-1391,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2000.09,2009.63,"An administrability concern. Once you start allowing mathematical formulas, you can get into a debate about when the formula becomes too complicated for your average consumer."
2016.15-1391,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2010.53,2017.57,"It's too much to say $10 plus 20 -- I -- I suppose it's a mathematical formula, but it's for second graders."
2016.15-1391,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2017.57,2019.69,"Well, Your Honor, let me see if I can -- first of all --"
2016.15-1391,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2019.69,2033.95,"Well, isn't the idea, Mr. Feigin, that if you said 32.46 plus 2 percent, then you really are requiring people to do some work and you'd rather just have them know that it's -- see, I can't do it that fast. (Laughter.)"
2016.15-1391,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2033.95,2037.44,"Well, Your Honor, you might also -- you can see that --"
2016.15-1391,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2037.44,2041.16,"I agree that percent -- that -- that's Point C, that's not B."
2016.15-1391,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2044.11,2044.835,"Well, you --"
2016.15-1391,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2044.835,2053.93,"But 20 cents and $10, that's not too complicated unless you're taking a very patronizing and condescending view of the capabilities of the American consumer."
2016.15-1391,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2053.93,2060.18,"I think, Your Honor, under Zauderer, Congress -- or the New York legislature is entitled to draw clear lines."
2016.15-1391,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2085.53,2085.72,"Yes, yes."
2016.15-1391,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2086.32,2087.85,There's a subset of the population --
2016.15-1391,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2087.85,2089.815,-- that takes a little longer to figure out.
2016.15-1391,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2094.345,2097.39,"I think, Your Honor, they're entitled to have a bright-line rule."
2016.15-1391,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2115.085,2116.22,Could I -- I feel it -- I'm sorry.
2016.15-1391,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2116.22,2118.69,-- and it makes for comparison pricing much easier.
2016.15-1391,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2118.69,2124.18,Can I ask you a different question? It -- it does -- this does not look like a disclosure requirement.
2016.15-1391,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2159.56,2161.16,You're -- may -- may I answer --
2016.15-1391,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2161.16,2161.285,Sure.
2016.15-1391,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2161.285,2168.79,"-- Mr. Chief Justice? Your Honor, I think the best thing for the Court to do here is, the Federal law was clear."
2016.15-1391,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2180.935,2189.11,"Thank you, Counsel. Mr. Wu?"
2016.15-1391,2,62793,steven_c_wu,,2189.11,2197.18,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The plain text of New York's statute refers only to a pricing practice and not to any speech."
2016.15-1391,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2217.935,2246.62,Could I just ask you a preliminary question about the division of litigation authority in New York State? Does the attorney general or the solicitor general have the authority under New York law to bind all of the district attorneys in the State to an interpretation of this statute? And has the attorney general issued a -- an official interpretation so that all of the district attorneys will be required to -- to enforce this in the same way?
2016.15-1391,2,62793,steven_c_wu,,2246.62,2251.575,So the attorney general and the district attorneys are separate authorities under New York law.
2016.15-1391,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2257.74,2257.82,Yeah.
2016.15-1391,2,62793,steven_c_wu,,2258.14,2259.01,-- and have expressed their endorsement.
2016.15-1391,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2259.01,2262.255,That's a problem for me. How many district attorneys are there in New York State?
2016.15-1391,2,62793,steven_c_wu,,2262.255,2263.69,There -- there are -- there are many.
2016.15-1391,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2263.69,2273.385,"There are many. So you tell us how you interpret this, but how do we know how all of these other district attorneys are going to interpret the statute? They may interpret it differently."
2016.15-1391,2,62793,steven_c_wu,,2273.385,2284.81,"Well, I don't think fundamentally there should be a debate about the -- the statute here. And -- and it's because a plain reading of the text here means reading what it means to impose a surcharge."
2016.15-1391,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2284.81,2288.59,"But, you know, there does seem to have been a debate about what this statute means."
2016.15-1391,2,62793,steven_c_wu,,2316.73,2331.99,"Justice Kagan, I disagree that we are walking away from the enforcement history here. See, I think if you actually look at what the enforcement history looks like, especially from the attorney general's office, that it confirms sort of the plain reading of this statute in a single-price scheme. And the heating oil company example, I think, is the clearest one."
2016.15-1391,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2371.925,2384.19,"But under your view, if the heating oil people had said, it's $103 if you pay by credit card; if you do not pay by credit card, pay by cash, it's $100, that is lawful?"
2016.15-1391,2,62793,steven_c_wu,,2384.19,2385.42,That's -- that's correct.
2016.15-1391,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2387.09,2390.44,Then it's a matter of how the pricing structure is communicated --
2016.15-1391,2,62793,steven_c_wu,,2390.44,2390.71,Well --
2016.15-1391,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2390.71,2391.405,-- in the speech.
2016.15-1391,2,62793,steven_c_wu,,2391.405,2413.25,"Well, I mean, let me respond in this way, which is, of course the definition or the determination of whether there's a surcharge will look back to the seller's original pricing practices, because that's the meaning of a surcharge, is a difference from some previously conveyed price. But the First Amendment doesn't prohibit the State from using a previously conveyed price as a baseline for a price regulation."
2016.15-1391,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2424.61,2433.69,"But suppose -- suppose in -- in the heating oil example they said, it's $103, but cash is $100, and that's because we impose a surcharge."
2016.15-1391,2,62793,steven_c_wu,,2434.8,2435.81,That -- that would be fine.
2016.15-1391,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2454.36,2468.8,Is your answer to the reply brief examples the same as the solicitor general's office? And do you have a concern the way it does that the statute could be read more broadly?
2016.15-1391,2,62793,steven_c_wu,,2468.8,2474.27,"So we -- our answers are the same as to the four examples there, and we do not think it is read more broadly."
2016.15-1391,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2488.17,2495.04,"Then why didn't New York -- I mean, New York adopted this against the backdrop of a lot of consideration at the Federal level."
2016.15-1391,2,62793,steven_c_wu,,2498.215,2503.16,I can't answer that question because nothing in the legislative history explains why they did not.
2016.15-1391,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2503.16,2504.09,What did the other --
2016.15-1391,2,62793,steven_c_wu,,2504.09,2504.21,But --
2016.15-1391,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2504.21,2511.975,"-- the other States that picked up after the Feds didn't renew the statute, what did the other States do?"
2016.15-1391,2,62793,steven_c_wu,,2511.975,2512.22,At --
2016.15-1391,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2512.22,2515.5,Did they do what New York did or did they copy the Federal statute?
2016.15-1391,2,62793,steven_c_wu,,2515.5,2518.71,"Well, the vast majority of them did not adopt the Federal definition."
2016.15-1391,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2539.505,2557.0,"Well, if I had the authority to interpret the New York statute, which I really don't, and I saw that they copied part of a prior statute, but they deliberately omitted other parts of the prior statute, I would be tempted to infer that they had a reason for omitting the definitions."
2016.15-1391,3,62793,steven_c_wu,,2561.23,2565.43,"I don't think there's anything in the history that would support that interpretation, Justice Alito."
2016.15-1391,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2583.695,2585.01,Go ahead.
2016.15-1391,4,62793,steven_c_wu,,2585.61,2586.095,"Yes, sir."
2016.15-1391,4,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2586.095,2586.67,All right.
2016.15-1391,4,62793,steven_c_wu,,2669.585,2669.92,Well --
2016.15-1391,4,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2669.92,2694.87,"That is, you tell me, given precedent, et cetera, what should we overrule? Or what should we narrow? If, as I believe is true, these regulatory areas are areas that not normal First Amendment, ""tough, you can't do it"" principles apply -- weakened forms might because it applies everywhere in a sense."
2016.15-1391,4,62793,steven_c_wu,,2714.665,2717.78,I'm going to give two responses to that.
2016.15-1391,4,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2735.2,2735.41,We're talking --
2016.15-1391,4,62793,steven_c_wu,,2735.41,2737.13,This talks about the imposition of a surcharge.
2016.15-1391,4,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2737.13,2748.445,I can't look at this statute and rely on its words or make a judgment on its words because nothing of what you're saying it applies to is said on the face of this statute.
2016.15-1391,4,62793,steven_c_wu,,2748.445,2748.96,Well --
2016.15-1391,4,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2748.96,2760.83,"You're asking me to take a lot of steps, which is start with the language of the statute, ignore it, and go to a Federal statute and apply its definitions."
2016.15-1391,4,62793,steven_c_wu,,2788.875,2804.72,"Well, if I could get to that in just one second and finish the answer to Justice Breyer's, because I think given the way the statute is phrased, the easiest way to dispose of this case is to recognize this as a direct price regulation that this Court in 44 Liquormart and other cases have held is not subject to First Amendment scrutiny."
2016.15-1391,4,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2804.72,2806.59,But it doesn't set a standing price.
2016.15-1391,4,62793,steven_c_wu,,2831.375,2846.4,"But the way to understand the statute -- and I think this answers Justice Sotomayor's question as well -- is that once the seller has chosen that price, which I agree they have a free choice about, then its ability to change that price for someone who uses a credit card is constrained."
2016.15-1391,4,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2870.68,2873.22,"No, I don't, because I know I have to pay sales tax."
2016.15-1391,4,62793,steven_c_wu,,2873.22,2874.35,"Well, you might have to pay sales tax."
2016.15-1391,4,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2874.35,2878.92,And every -- and every State I have to figure out what that sales tax is and I've got to do the math in my own head.
2016.15-1391,4,62793,steven_c_wu,,2878.92,2879.82,That's -- that's correct.
2016.15-1391,4,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2901.0,2908.44,"I mean, here's the narrow way in which this seems to affect communication, speech. I'm a seller."
2016.15-1391,4,62793,steven_c_wu,,2969.4,2980.115,"So even if it does affect what a seller does in that case, it's only because the list price is being used as evidence to support whether an imposition -- whether a surcharge has been imposed later."
2016.15-1391,4,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3067.33,3074.88,But suppose that a business makes a point of its reputation is -- is meeting all prices.
2016.15-1391,4,62793,steven_c_wu,,3124.015,3128.75,I think it probably would be deemed to be a credit card surcharge in that case.
2016.15-1391,4,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3147.54,3153.825,"The question of Justice Breyer says that -- that this is so complicated, doesn't that indicate the statute is vague?"
2016.15-1391,4,62793,steven_c_wu,,3153.825,3163.16,"It -- it does not, because under the vagueness doctrine under the Due Process Clause, as long as there are a core set of cases that people can understand, that's enough to sustain it."
2016.15-1391,4,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3207.27,3220.705,"So they hold this in an as-applied a challenge -- I hope your adversary will confirm this -- that they want to do these four things that's in the reply brief, one or the other."
2016.15-1391,4,62793,steven_c_wu,,3237.855,3239.77,Yes. I think that's --
2016.15-1391,4,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3239.77,3241.78,But you're saying more than this.
2016.15-1391,4,62793,steven_c_wu,,3260.245,3268.675,I don't think that's our argument. And I should clarify I do think some of these schemes are not okay in the sense that you couldn't impose a credit card surcharge under some of these boxes.
2016.15-1391,4,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3272.13,3274.455,I'm saying if we say it's okay.
2016.15-1391,4,62793,steven_c_wu,,3277.095,3284.95,But -- but one point I want to respond to is the idea that what somebody says over the phone here can affect the underlying price structure.
2016.15-1391,4,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3305.63,3306.7,Does this apply --
2016.15-1391,4,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3306.7,3307.445,I'm sorry.
2016.15-1391,4,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3307.445,3310.915,Does this apply to all merchants? Anybody who sells anything?
2016.15-1391,4,62793,steven_c_wu,,3310.915,3312.46,It -- it does.
2016.15-1391,4,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3316.58,3331.065,"I mean, suppose some kids have a lemonade stand or they're washing cars and they say a glass of lemonade, $1 and then somebody comes up to them and says I'd like to buy that with a credit card."
2016.15-1391,4,62793,steven_c_wu,,3350.785,3354.18,The statue has no exemption for kids selling lemonade. (Laughter.)
2016.15-1391,4,62793,steven_c_wu,,3354.18,3360.21,I think -- I think prosecutorial discretion would almost certainly be exercised in that -- in that situation.
2016.15-1391,4,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3360.21,3363.635,You can think of examples which I can't.
2016.15-1391,4,62793,steven_c_wu,,3423.32,3435.665,"Well, they affect only what you say about price as an incident to preventing you from engaging a certain pricing practice in the first instance, and I think this is the distinction this Court has drawn in cases like Virginia State Board of Pharmacy."
2016.15-1391,4,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3496.66,3516.275,"If we -- if we agree with the government that this is because it affects how the merchant characterizes his price, would you also take the position that the government takes that it's justified as a disclosure law?"
2016.15-1391,4,62793,steven_c_wu,,3516.275,3534.06,"We -- we think that it can be, and -- and -- and in part that's because we agree with the government, with the Federal Government, about the compliance options under this statute. It is true under both the New York law and the Federal law that the way a seller complies with the statute is to display a dollars-and-cents price that it later charges the credit card customers."
2016.15-1391,4,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3534.06,3544.305,Can you explain to me how it's a disclosure requirement to suppress the actual cost of the credit card purchase?
2016.15-1391,4,62793,steven_c_wu,,3544.305,3547.51,"Well, it's not suppressing the actual cost of the credit card purchase."
2016.15-1391,4,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3562.33,3567.79,"Mr. Wu, you think, is this not true, that the dual pricing scheme is legal; is that right?"
2016.15-1391,4,62793,steven_c_wu,,3567.79,3568.705,That's correct.
2016.15-1391,4,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3568.705,3573.52,"That was something that the Second Circuit did not decide, said it was abstaining on."
2016.15-1391,4,62793,steven_c_wu,,3585.9,3587.525,I think that it would be.
2016.15-1391,4,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3688.24,3691.23,There is nothing about the scheme that addresses that.
2016.15-1391,4,62793,steven_c_wu,,3702.735,3704.465,If I could answer just this question.
2016.15-1391,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3704.465,3704.63,Sure.
2016.15-1391,4,62793,steven_c_wu,,3704.63,3706.66,"That's correct, but I think this supports our point."
2016.15-1391,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3719.71,3723.095,"Thank you, Counsel. Mr. Gupta, a minute."
2016.15-1391,5,20895,deepak_gupta,,3723.095,3744.18,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. The solicitor general agrees with us that this is a restriction of speech, but posits that the only thing that's left on the table is a disclosure rationale that New York abandoned in the courts below and is barely pressing here, and the problem with that is that this is a criminal speech restriction."
2016.15-1391,5,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3792.825,0.0,"Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted."
