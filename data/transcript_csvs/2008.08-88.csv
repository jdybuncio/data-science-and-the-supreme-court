2008.08-88,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,6.138,"We will hear argument next in Case 08-88, Vermont v. Brillon."
2008.08-88,0,19877,christina_rainville,,7.292,13.586,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: There are many reasons to reverse the Vermont Supreme Court in this case."
2008.08-88,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,49.181,55.584,May I ask you a question that goes at least to one possible application of -- of your argument?
2008.08-88,0,19877,christina_rainville,,130.946,131.383,Yes.
2008.08-88,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,151.702,152.108,Yes.
2008.08-88,0,19877,christina_rainville,,152.108,155.84,"That was dicta in Barker, but controlling to the Vermont Supreme Court."
2008.08-88,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,159.229,162.196,"But it was conceded, wasn't it, in the -- in the Vermont Supreme Court?"
2008.08-88,0,19877,christina_rainville,,162.196,164.103,--It was conceded that it was a neutral time period.
2008.08-88,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,164.103,164.633,Yes.
2008.08-88,0,19877,christina_rainville,,164.633,165.308,And -- and--
2008.08-88,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,165.308,168.463,"Well, then, why isn't that concession binding here?"
2008.08-88,0,19877,christina_rainville,,168.463,172.99,--I think it -- it may be binding if the Court determines it's binding.
2008.08-88,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,190.233,198.387,"Well, it is, but that is not an issue that is necessarily implied by the -- by the concession that the Attorney General made in the Vermont Supreme Court."
2008.08-88,0,19877,christina_rainville,,198.387,199.12,Yes.
2008.08-88,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,221.598,223.563,It may have been a good concession below.
2008.08-88,0,19877,christina_rainville,,228.531,229.514,That's correct.
2008.08-88,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,229.514,232.138,"I mean, that may well have been attributable to the State."
2008.08-88,0,19877,christina_rainville,,232.138,235.214,It -- it may well have been attributable to the defender general.
2008.08-88,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,248.597,257.5,I suppose you are willing to concede that there are situations where the delay would be attributable to the State because of systemic problems?
2008.08-88,0,19877,christina_rainville,,257.5,258.872,--Yes.
2008.08-88,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,258.872,262.202,"The State has so many cases, and it's only willing to hire one lawyer."
2008.08-88,0,19877,christina_rainville,,265.794,267.151,Absolutely.
2008.08-88,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,363.271,376.576,"I guess when -- when the last two lawyers withdrew because their contracts had expired, I suppose the court could have refused to permit them to withdraw, couldn't it?"
2008.08-88,0,19877,christina_rainville,,376.576,378.154,--It could have.
2008.08-88,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,378.154,387.073,"Couldn't it say you -- you have an ethical duty; having undertaken representation, and it being very difficult to get anybody else, you -- you stay in the case?"
2008.08-88,0,19877,christina_rainville,,387.073,388.916,"The -- the court could have, and certainly--"
2008.08-88,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,388.916,393.491,Does it make it not the State's court -- not the State's fault no matter what?
2008.08-88,0,19877,christina_rainville,,400.02,406.426,"--The court's misfeasance would -- would certainly be attributable to the State, but we would argue that it would be a neutral factor."
2008.08-88,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,444.657,446.548,--with that particular period.
2008.08-88,0,19877,christina_rainville,,456.449,457.357,--That's Moore.
2008.08-88,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,457.357,457.935,All right.
2008.08-88,0,19877,christina_rainville,,459.654,461.916,Donaldson was actually Lawyer No. 4.
2008.08-88,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,461.916,463.432,Go ahead.
2008.08-88,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,464.103,471.13,"Before you start, let me just make a comment and a -- and a question based on it."
2008.08-88,0,19877,christina_rainville,,542.432,549.132,"You can certainly look at it in terms of details, and I think that the Vermont Supreme Court's findings are unsupported by the record."
2008.08-88,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,569.859,580.68,"Yeah, but if you take Sleigh, Donaldson, and the period in which there was no -- I guess, following Sleigh, in which there was no counsel appointed at all, you're already up to just about a year."
2008.08-88,0,19877,christina_rainville,,614.418,621.398,"Well, also in terms of just based on Brillon's admission, there's enough for this Court to decide the case."
2008.08-88,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,623.928,624.459,Right.
2008.08-88,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,624.459,633.346,Isn't there -- isn't there that very important principle involved here that doesn't simply involve calculating particular periods of delay?
2008.08-88,0,19877,christina_rainville,,666.223,669.377,"I believe you're absolutely right, Justice Alito."
2008.08-88,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,675.083,679.251,I really wanted to ask you pretty much exactly the same question.
2008.08-88,0,19877,christina_rainville,,693.106,696.729,"--I would -- I wouldn't go that far, Justice Stevens."
2008.08-88,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,696.729,697.213,Why not?
2008.08-88,0,19877,christina_rainville,,697.213,701.319,Because what if the State kept him for ten years without a trial?
2008.08-88,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,710.74,718.624,"Well, there -- as I understand it, that that first year the Vermont Supreme Court agrees with you."
2008.08-88,0,19877,christina_rainville,,718.624,719.938,--That's right.
2008.08-88,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,719.938,722.341,"They said, we're not counting any of that against you."
2008.08-88,0,19877,christina_rainville,,824.38,833.953,"I think you can decide it without reviewing the record, based on the fact that you have a defendant who fired his first lawyer six months into the case, one day before trial."
2008.08-88,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,833.953,835.328,And you won that.
2008.08-88,0,19877,christina_rainville,,835.328,843.888,"And then filed -- fired a second lawyer when the lawyer initially argued and said, no, no, it's not true, I've been working; he then threatened to kill the lawyer."
2008.08-88,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,856.695,875.154,"I suppose -- I'm not sure that we necessarily want to get into the particular details of a very complicated record, but there are several points in the Vermont Supreme Court opinion where it says that the failure of assigned lawyers to do anything to move the case forward is attributable to the State."
2008.08-88,0,19877,christina_rainville,,905.049,908.202,"And I think that's a very important point, Mr. Chief Justice."
2008.08-88,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,908.202,909.61,Is that point in the case?
2008.08-88,0,19877,christina_rainville,,963.775,968.259,"Well, first let me address this point of two lawyers who did little or nothing."
2008.08-88,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,995.185,1008.837,"Ms. Rainville, underneath or between the lines there seems to be great discontent on the part of the Vermont Supreme Court with the way the public defender system is operating."
2008.08-88,0,19877,christina_rainville,,1026.437,1054.754,"It could except for that we believe that this decision creates an unconstitutional situation in creating two different classes of defendant, indigent and non-indigent, in their speedy trial rights, such that henceforth the prosecution and the courts must treat every indigent defendant differently merely because they're indigent when they ask for a continuance or when they ask for change of counsel."
2008.08-88,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1082.101,1087.6,"Ms. Rainville, you -- you began your presentation with a statement that gave me so much hope."
2008.08-88,0,19877,christina_rainville,,1099.268,1100.675,The second is--
2008.08-88,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1100.675,1101.908,Remind us of the first.
2008.08-88,0,19877,christina_rainville,,1101.908,1109.328,--The first is that this creates an unconstitutional situation where there are two classes of defendants treated differently by the State and by the courts.
2008.08-88,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1118.698,1121.104,"Well, that sort of gets us into the facts at some point."
2008.08-88,0,19877,christina_rainville,,1123.694,1138.157,"The third is that, based on his concessions, his admissions in the brief, he's waived it; and that's under Barker v. Wingo where the Court talks about standard waiver doctrine applies in speedy trial."
2008.08-88,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1150.434,1151.512,"Thank you, counsel."
2008.08-88,1,45730,william_a_nelson,,1156.118,1156.948,"Oh, excuse me."
2008.08-88,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1156.948,1168.803,Ms. Kruger.
2008.08-88,2,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,1168.803,1195.635,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: If you look on pages 27 through 28 of the Vermont Supreme Court's opinion, it is clear that the Vermont Supreme Court decided this case on the basis of a single principle that it applied to the entirety of the final two years of the pretrial delay in this case, and that is, as the Chief Justice has noted, that the failure of defendant's series of assigned counsel to move his case to trial should be attributable to the State."
2008.08-88,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1284.723,1288.268,"With respect to that last point, let me ask you this question."
2008.08-88,2,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,1362.944,1373.562,I think that Barker makes clear that defendants can waive their right to a speedy trial and that indeed defendants will often desire to put off trial as long as possible.
2008.08-88,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1409.765,1412.609,"Well, what if the -- what if we change the facts slightly."
2008.08-88,2,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,1442.735,1443.987,It would still be the same.
2008.08-88,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1459.762,1467.494,"Lots -- lots of very effective criminal trial lawyers believe that the first tactic is delay, delay, delay, delay, delay."
2008.08-88,2,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,1467.494,1485.502,"--And I think it's precisely for that reason, because a delay may ultimately be in the client's interest, that this Court should decline to fashion a rule that makes the exercise of the remedy, which is again an extreme remedy that advantages the defendant alone, exercisable at the option solely of the defendant."
2008.08-88,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1513.208,1516.161,Let me ask you this question about your reliance on pages 27 and 28.
2008.08-88,2,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,1546.287,1548.023,"We would agree, Justice Stevens."
2008.08-88,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1587.973,1594.598,Isn't the prejudice factor pretty much established as long as the guy has to stay in jail during this entire period?
2008.08-88,2,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,1594.598,1609.514,"I think that that's certainly one form of prejudice, but in the Barker balancing -- in Barker itself, for example, the defendant was incarcerated for ten months during the pretrial proceedings, and the Court nevertheless found that there was no speedy trial violation."
2008.08-88,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1620.398,1625.803,Did he get to offset it against the time for the pretrial incarceration?
2008.08-88,2,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,1625.803,1645.437,"--I am not aware that he did, but this Court made clear in Strunk that getting credit for time served is not an appropriate remedy for a speedy trial violation, that the only possible remedy is again what the Vermont Supreme Court did, erroneously in our view, which is to dismiss the charges without possibility of reindictment."
2008.08-88,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1645.437,1652.759,"What would you think of a rule that said where most of the delay is attributable to the defendant, he doesn't -- he doesn't walk?"
2008.08-88,2,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,1663.007,1665.959,We think that a defendant -- we think that that rule would make a great deal of sense.
2008.08-88,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1666.771,1676.391,That would make it easy to decide this case because the -- the supreme court's opinion acknowledges that most of the -- most of the delay was caused by the defendant.
2008.08-88,2,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,1676.391,1686.058,"--Well, the Vermont Supreme Court thought that some of the delay was caused by the defendant and didn't charge most of that period to the State to support its finding of the speedy trial violation."
2008.08-88,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1686.058,1696.056,"Would you really get by that rule if there were, say, four years of delay and two years and one month was attributable to the defendant and two years to the State?"
2008.08-88,2,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,1696.056,1710.66,We would think that a court evaluating a speedy trial claim in that case would properly exclude any period that was attributable to the defendant and focus specifically on that period that was attributable to the State in determining whether or not the right was violated.
2008.08-88,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1710.66,1732.353,"Counsel, I'm sure you have gone through the record and, agreeing with Justice Stevens that the periods where there wasn't a contract, the State couldn't provide somebody, do count against the State, but disagreeing with the Vermont Supreme Court that when an assigned counsel fails to move the case forward that is attributable to the State and not the defendant, what's the difference in time?"
2008.08-88,2,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,1732.353,1741.161,"The difference in time is -- I think that the -- as the case comes to the court, the final 11 months of the pretrial delay is not seriously in dispute."
2008.08-88,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1778.335,1779.1,Yes?
2008.08-88,2,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,1779.1,1803.215,"--We think with respect to that period, we think that there is no basis for shifting the responsibility for that delay that Paul Donaldson sought before going to trial from defendant to the State because, as Justice Scalia has rightly pointed out, any contract expiration didn't in and of itself end the attorney-client relationship, and Paul Donaldson remained the agent and advocate of his client during that period."
2008.08-88,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1803.215,1804.669,"Thank you, counsel."
2008.08-88,3,45730,william_a_nelson,,1811.961,1815.49,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I apologize for jumping the gun."
2008.08-88,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1815.49,1818.442,Sorry to delay you.
2008.08-88,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1818.442,1822.708,But it's not going to get you off.
2008.08-88,3,45730,william_a_nelson,,1823.613,1837.202,I would like to respond to -- to Vermont's argument about there being no detailed record about why these attorneys left when they left.
2008.08-88,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1931.649,1943.799,What is the -- what is the distinction in your theory of the case between delay and failure -- failure to move a case -- what did -- what did the Vermont case say: Failure to do anything to move the case forward?
2008.08-88,3,45730,william_a_nelson,,1948.986,1958.669,"I think it -- I think it depends on the facts, and I think in each of the -- in the case of each of these two attorneys, the facts are different."
2008.08-88,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1981.425,1987.798,"Of course, if the lawyer is a do-nothing lawyer, then I suppose there's an ineffective-assistance claim?"
2008.08-88,3,45730,william_a_nelson,,1987.798,2003.805,"Well, it might mature into an ineffective-assistance claim, but there couldn't be an ineffective assistance claim on the record here because, well, ineffective assistance is -- is something that occurs at a trial."
2008.08-88,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2004.917,2011.865,"It's an anomaly, though, isn't it, that easily might have matured into ineffective assistance?"
2008.08-88,3,45730,william_a_nelson,,2030.544,2038.401,--That's -- that's a consequence of the speedy-trial clause in Barker and Strunk.
2008.08-88,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2063.783,2075.15,"In the abstract, you have a lawyer who is a public defender or hired as a public defender, and he keeps asking for continuances -- continuance, continuance."
2008.08-88,3,45730,william_a_nelson,,2082.728,2092.207,--I think at first you would have to assume that the continuances were sought in good faith and -- and for purposes of defense preparation.
2008.08-88,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2103.219,2105.309,"Well, what is the trial judge supposed to do?"
2008.08-88,3,45730,william_a_nelson,,2119.04,2133.784,"I think, Justice Alito, that a court -- when a defendant has demanded a speedy trial, that a court does have some obligation to -- to supervise, to monitor, to -- and -- and it happens all the time in criminal courts."
2008.08-88,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2169.425,2173.879,Aren't you giving the attorney a very perverse incentive there?
2008.08-88,3,45730,william_a_nelson,,2187.764,2201.07,"--Well, I -- yes, of course, that's a -- that's a problem, and it's a problem that was recognized by Barker, and -- and it's a problem that -- that courts are well equipped to handle."
2008.08-88,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2242.225,2247.583,"And by your client firing the first attorney, correct?"
2008.08-88,3,45730,william_a_nelson,,2247.583,2250.208,My client -- that's correct.
2008.08-88,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2301.122,2309.039,"But knowing that the new lawyer would have to start from scratch, from the beginning, so it was going to take more time."
2008.08-88,3,45730,william_a_nelson,,2319.349,2329.609,"Well, yes, but the lawyer who had been appointed wasn't going to get those few more weeks, and as Mr. Brillon said to the court, I would rather do it right the first time."
2008.08-88,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2346.82,2349.523,"Excuse me, is that the proper remedy?"
2008.08-88,3,45730,william_a_nelson,,2367.095,2368.093,--Counsel.
2008.08-88,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2373.373,2373.794,Right.
2008.08-88,3,45730,william_a_nelson,,2373.794,2375.405,And--
2008.08-88,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2375.405,2377.827,"And from what you told me it should have been given, right?"
2008.08-88,3,45730,william_a_nelson,,2377.827,2378.591,--Pardon me?
2008.08-88,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2378.591,2385.851,"From what you tell me, it should have been given if indeed he was unable to prepare adequately for the trial?"
2008.08-88,3,45730,william_a_nelson,,2385.851,2387.711,I believe so.
2008.08-88,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2398.396,2405.017,"Well, wasn't there a concern about this defendant trying avoid a particular judge?"
2008.08-88,3,45730,william_a_nelson,,2409.154,2414.856,"The -- the State made that allegation, and it made that claim here."
2008.08-88,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2441.563,2450.903,"Not only did the Vermont Supreme Court make that finding, it does not hear the witnesses, it -- it has a record before it."
2008.08-88,3,45730,william_a_nelson,,2462.649,2465.755,"That's -- that's true, Justice Ginsburg."
2008.08-88,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2528.608,2535.605,This is not an unusual reason for criminal defense lawyers in the private sector to ask for a continuance.
2008.08-88,3,45730,william_a_nelson,,2559.297,2581.209,"Mr. Chief Justice, I -- I'm only saying that this -- on this record, the conclusion that that was what was happening, which would be significant if the court were then to say, and therefore, it was done by the defendant who wanted delay despite what he said, and therefore, this is time considered waived under Barker."
2008.08-88,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2585.538,2586.833,"My point is, I guess, how do we tell?"
2008.08-88,3,45730,william_a_nelson,,2600.265,2606.996,"Well, actually, this wasn't the first -- the first request for a continuance, Chief."
2008.08-88,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2609.651,2615.852,"Yeah, but -- again, I assume that's -- there are probably cases in the private bar where that's true as well."
2008.08-88,3,45730,william_a_nelson,,2615.852,2616.71,How does one know?
2008.08-88,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2666.129,2669.801,"What about Donaldson and Moore, those two periods?"
2008.08-88,3,45730,william_a_nelson,,2711.955,2712.985,Let me start--
2008.08-88,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2712.985,2716.03,Is Donaldson a case where they -- is equivalent to having no lawyer?
2008.08-88,3,45730,william_a_nelson,,2717.796,2724.418,"--Let me start with Donaldson, and I think in answer to your question, I don't think Donaldson is substantially different from Sleigh."
2008.08-88,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2883.538,2895.767,What does your -- your argument do to the fundamental and I think quite vital principle in Polk County that public defenders work for their clients; they don't work for the State?
2008.08-88,3,45730,william_a_nelson,,2895.767,2922.256,"--It does nothing to Polk County, and we acknowledge that -- that Paul Donaldson's inaction by itself, if it had nothing to do with the State, if the State did not involve itself or condone -- if the State had no responsibility with regard to that time, the State would have no responsibility under Barker."
2008.08-88,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2930.363,2943.636,"Well, I guess fairly read, it does say the failure of several assigned counsel to do anything to move the case forward is attributable to the State, because they didn't do anything, I guess is the touchstone."
2008.08-88,3,45730,william_a_nelson,,2943.636,2946.869,"--Well, I think I have two responses to that."
2008.08-88,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2973.94,2992.322,"But it doesn't say that; it really does say most of the delay was caused by the inability or unwillingness of assigned counsel, not of the -- of the institution that appoints them, unwillingness or inability of assigned counsel to move the case forward."
2008.08-88,3,45730,william_a_nelson,,2993.492,3003.459,"I think -- elsewhere in the opinion, Justice Scalia, I think the court is clear that -- that they were faulting the defender general, and to a lesser extent the court."
2008.08-88,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3024.652,3026.134,Do you agree -- just following up--
2008.08-88,3,45730,william_a_nelson,,3026.134,3026.524,Okay.
2008.08-88,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3026.524,3027.558,--I'm sorry.
2008.08-88,3,45730,william_a_nelson,,3053.439,3054.001,Well--
2008.08-88,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3054.001,3056.185,Is it still attributable to the State?
2008.08-88,3,45730,william_a_nelson,,3056.185,3060.373,--I don't think -- I don't think the result depends on there being a systemic problem.
2008.08-88,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3073.662,3084.861,"But the Chief Justice's question, I'm interested in it as well, are there instances in which a State-appointed counsel can delay and have that not attributed to the State?"
2008.08-88,3,45730,william_a_nelson,,3087.174,3087.611,--No.
2008.08-88,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3087.611,3088.391,--Just because he's State--
2008.08-88,3,45730,william_a_nelson,,3088.391,3093.498,"Absolutely there can be situations like that, where there is no--"
2008.08-88,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3093.498,3097.075,"--There is a delay, but it's not attributable to the State."
2008.08-88,3,45730,william_a_nelson,,3097.075,3100.717,"--It's not attributable to the State, it's attributable to counsel."
2008.08-88,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3107.478,3108.414,"Well, when is that?"
2008.08-88,3,45730,william_a_nelson,,3122.628,3144.945,"--It would not be attributable to the State if the assigning agency was -- had no fault, had no supervising duty that it failed to perform, that the lawyer was essentially on his own or her own; and it would also assume, I think, if the delay went on long enough, that there was no fault in the court in failing to--"
2008.08-88,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3144.945,3145.713,"Well, I--"
2008.08-88,3,45730,william_a_nelson,,3145.713,3148.493,--to notice that nothing was happening.
2008.08-88,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3148.493,3166.173,"--It does sound to me, then, that you're saying there has to be some systemic problem, that the rule that I understand the Vermont Supreme Court to have adopted, that when assigned counsel does nothing to move the case forward, that that's attributable to the State, you would disagree with?"
2008.08-88,3,45730,william_a_nelson,,3178.496,3182.182,Maybe I'm not using the word systemic in the same sense you are.
2008.08-88,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3195.724,3204.564,"What if you have a situation in which the -- an attorney is appointed, the defendant threatens that attorney, the attorney withdraws."
2008.08-88,3,45730,william_a_nelson,,3231.162,3247.046,"I think you can't ignore what happened before, but you can -- but -- but if what you're saying or suggesting is that earlier bad actions result in a forfeiture of speedy trial rights, I would disagree."
2008.08-88,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3263.006,3266.804,What if a small -- I don't know how many lawyers are available for appointment in Bennington.
2008.08-88,3,45730,william_a_nelson,,3283.889,3298.807,"--But that's not the case here, and I think my answer to your question is that what makes this a State response -- failure of responsibility is that the State had the ability to do something about it."
2008.08-88,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3310.128,3313.426,What about the point that Ms. Rainville made?
2008.08-88,3,45730,william_a_nelson,,3358.454,3362.514,"--Justice Ginsburg, I don't think that Barker works that way."
2008.08-88,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3433.375,3463.551,"Well, the rest, I couldn't find in his final counsel's representation -- I didn't see anything in her representation that would suggest any lack of diligence on her part or any reason to count that in the speedy trial calculus."
2008.08-88,3,45730,william_a_nelson,,3470.05,3471.329,To June 2004.
2008.08-88,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3572.538,3573.383,Mr. Nelson--
2008.08-88,3,45730,william_a_nelson,,3573.383,3573.82,The court was also--
2008.08-88,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3573.82,3578.706,--what is your judgment on how much time all together was attributable to the State?
2008.08-88,3,45730,william_a_nelson,,3578.706,3588.565,"--I think 14 -- I think the Vermont court was clear about the 14 months from Donaldson through Moore, including the six months of no counsel."
2008.08-88,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3619.223,3627.985,"So your 14 months, just so I understand, that includes the August 2003 through June 2004, when Moore was representing him?"
2008.08-88,3,45730,william_a_nelson,,3627.985,3628.547,No.
2008.08-88,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3640.587,3641.34,"Thank you, Mr. Nelson."
2008.08-88,4,19877,christina_rainville,,3643.462,3650.695,"Very quickly then, Justice Ginsburg, the answer to your question, he did receive credit for his time served."
2008.08-88,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3689.725,3690.864,"Thank you, counsel."
