1974.9_orig,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,148.56,149.67,That they qualify as --
1974.9_orig,0,37588,oliver_p_stockwell,,149.67,155.431,"As territorial bays, historic or territorial bays and not inland bays."
1974.9_orig,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,852.405,853.191,Very well.
1974.9_orig,1,23871,frederick_w_ellis,,853.191,865.512,Alright.
1974.9_orig,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,865.512,866.752,Mr. Ellis.
1974.9_orig,1,23871,frederick_w_ellis,,866.752,873.689,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1974.9_orig,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,908.3,926.085,"Mr. Ellis, before you proceed, may I ask, am I correct with my understanding that the map that's been put before us this morning is identical to the map that was the appendix to the Court's opinion in the case to which you just referred in 1969?"
1974.9_orig,1,23871,frederick_w_ellis,,926.085,927.786,"I understand this is correct, Your Honor."
1974.9_orig,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,931.809,932.785,That it's the same?
1974.9_orig,1,23871,frederick_w_ellis,,932.785,933.136,"Yes, sir."
1974.9_orig,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,935.23,936.807,"They made some marks and red here, have they not?"
1974.9_orig,1,23871,frederick_w_ellis,,936.807,937.863,Yes.
1974.9_orig,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,945.785,946.454,Right.
1974.9_orig,1,23871,frederick_w_ellis,,946.454,951.387,Runs outward to see considerably that is no long and controversy.
1974.9_orig,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,957.741,959.456,I understand that.
1974.9_orig,1,23871,frederick_w_ellis,,959.456,977.11,"The areas in controversy are the Mississippi Delta areas numbered 1, 4, 5, and 6 and Caillou Bay numbered 7 which are affected by the historic claims and the remaining areas numbered on the map or affected by juridical claims."
1974.9_orig,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,989.952,993.008,Right.
1974.9_orig,1,23871,frederick_w_ellis,,993.008,994.691,Now turning to --
1974.9_orig,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,994.691,997.266,Does East stay back?
1974.9_orig,1,23871,frederick_w_ellis,,997.266,999.232,"Yes, sir, the East stays behind."
1974.9_orig,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1122.006,1123.108,What number is that?
1974.9_orig,1,23871,frederick_w_ellis,,1123.108,1124.641,"This is number 2, Your Honor."
1974.9_orig,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1124.641,1126.59,Thank you.
1974.9_orig,1,23871,frederick_w_ellis,,1126.59,1154.199,"Your Honors may find this bay also in a map which was prepared to implement your ruling that island should be counted as water area figure R.A. in Louisiana's Reply brief found at page 58, which map has superimposed upon it in black lines a sketch showing the outline of Monterey Bay."
1974.9_orig,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1294.35,1295.525,Which one has one?
1974.9_orig,1,23871,frederick_w_ellis,,1295.525,1300.579,"That is number 1, Your Honor on the government location map."
1974.9_orig,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1528.359,1532.493,"When you say pass that refers to the water rather than the land, does it?"
1974.9_orig,1,23871,frederick_w_ellis,,1532.493,1532.901,"Yes, sir."
1974.9_orig,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1744.568,1753.05,"What's the status of the government sketches so far as the record is concerned, were they admitted in evidence or are concededly just illustrative?"
1974.9_orig,1,23871,frederick_w_ellis,,1753.05,1759.84,They were not admitted in evidence as appreciate they're merely illustrative.
1974.9_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1808.365,1809.86,Is that the Joseph Bayou area?
1974.9_orig,1,23871,frederick_w_ellis,,1809.86,1810.715,"Yes, sir."
1974.9_orig,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2251.856,2255.443,Does Caillou Lake completely landlocked?
1974.9_orig,1,23871,frederick_w_ellis,,2255.443,2256.596,Caillou Bay?
1974.9_orig,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2256.596,2258.899,"Lake, there's a lake in there, isn't it?"
1974.9_orig,1,23871,frederick_w_ellis,,2258.899,2267.007,Caillou Lake is in the interior part and I believe it is landlocked completely except for an entrance to it sir.
1974.9_orig,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2270.805,2273.011,"No, I'm looking at the temporary map."
1974.9_orig,1,23871,frederick_w_ellis,,2273.915,2274.084,Yes.
1974.9_orig,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2274.084,2280.266,"--old map, 1853."
1974.9_orig,1,23871,frederick_w_ellis,,2280.266,2283.665,There are two distinct water bodies Caillou Lake and Caillou Bay.
1974.9_orig,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2283.665,2284.961,I understand that.
1974.9_orig,1,23871,frederick_w_ellis,,2284.961,2290.842,And Caillou Lake is virtually completely landlocked as you have observed Your Honor.
1974.9_orig,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2602.31,2604.165,Number 7 on the Government's?
1974.9_orig,1,23871,frederick_w_ellis,,2604.165,2615.996,"Yes, and this is number 7 on the Government map and it is the open marked A here."
1974.9_orig,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2743.693,2745.653,Thank you Mr. Ellis.
1974.9_orig,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,2747.367,2756.66,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court, I'll attempt to deal first with Louisiana's historic claim."
1974.9_orig,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2898.591,2901.235,That in itself is quite unusual?
1974.9_orig,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,2901.235,2904.124,"Indeed, Mr. Justice Rehnquist."
1974.9_orig,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2914.258,2931.226,"Does this say, your basic theme that you're at the outset that there is and should be a presumption against finding historic base, is that -- did you find any support for that and in any of the opinions of this Court?"
1974.9_orig,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,2948.338,2957.668,"Only to this extent Mr. Justice Stewart that in both of those cases, the Court took note of the federal disclaimer and gave it weight."
1974.9_orig,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3039.988,3047.611,"But that still, all of that still does not add up to their being a bias against them or presumption against them, does it?"
1974.9_orig,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,3047.611,3050.875,"I simply wouldn't say there will be a bias against Louisianans, Justice Stewart."
1974.9_orig,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3050.875,3052.319,"No, just historic bays?"
1974.9_orig,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,3053.592,3067.853,"Well, I suppose the normal rules of construction would say that when the claim is attaches itself to an exception to the rule the -- that exception ought to be construed narrowly."
1974.9_orig,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3073.036,3078.532,"There are good many recognize historic bays, aren't there in the -- along the coastlines of the United States?"
1974.9_orig,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,3078.532,3098.283,"No, Mr. Justice Stewart, the United States and I should say this consistently with its position of restricting the coastline as much as possible of limiting the encroachments on the open sea recognizes on the American Coast no historic bay whatever with the single exception of Long Islands."
1974.9_orig,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3120.058,3124.49,Was it tested by the rules of International Convention?
1974.9_orig,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,3124.49,3144.942,Tested by the rules of International Convention which merely recognized in Article VII that they all such things is as historic base without attempting to define them presumably because of lack agreement in the international community on the subject.
1974.9_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3397.741,3403.026,What authority do you have that acquiescence in some form is essential?
1974.9_orig,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,3403.026,3434.591,The authority cited by this Court in its last opinion indicate that either expressed acquiescence or absence of protest is important when absence of protest is discussed it is in the context of having noticed and we simply refer to that situation of not protesting when you had long notice as amounting to tacit acquiescence.
1974.9_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3440.999,3446.899,"You wouldn't if it's just a debate about words, you wouldn't insist in that acquiescence is necessary."
1974.9_orig,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,3446.899,3452.388,Except that I would insist Mr. Justice White that absence of protest alone is not sufficient.
1974.9_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3460.865,3466.029,"If foreign government hasn't invaded Louisiana, it would be enough to show acquiescence?"
1974.9_orig,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,3466.029,3483.373,It would be enough if a foreign government had been notified over a long period that Louisiana was claiming a space inland waters and had failed to protest that situation provided further that they had some interest in doing so.
1974.9_orig,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4013.329,4019.572,Are these soundings on this map in there at fathoms?
1974.9_orig,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,4019.572,4020.596,I think they're in --
1974.9_orig,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4020.596,4023.663,"At Maine low water, that's what they generally are?"
1974.9_orig,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,4023.663,4028.593,"I believe they're in feet, Mr. Justice Stewart, if that is a composite base now --"
1974.9_orig,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4028.593,4030.731,"Is there any usual, I'm sure."
1974.9_orig,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,4030.731,4038.194,"The series 1200 shots of which they are many of them in the record are in feet, not in fathoms."
1974.9_orig,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4052.614,4055.97,"Generally, in the chart, there are in fathoms in Maine land water."
1974.9_orig,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,4055.97,4057.147,Which is what this is?
1974.9_orig,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4057.147,4058.037,Is it?
1974.9_orig,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,4058.037,4063.037,It says so.
1974.9_orig,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4407.423,4413.751,The Master ruled against Louisiana on East Bay the juridical claim?
1974.9_orig,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,4413.751,4430.564,The Master ruled in part against Louisiana on the juridical claim but found for one period one line well within the Bay and for another period a second line further within the bay as qualifying as a juridical claim.
1974.9_orig,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4430.564,4433.943,So your argument is going to all of those findings now?
1974.9_orig,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,4433.943,4442.511,"Indeed, my argument goes to both what the Master found and what Louisiana suggest he should have found."
1974.9_orig,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4442.511,4442.804,"Well, a --"
1974.9_orig,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,4442.804,4451.552,We do attack the Master's finding of part of East Bay as qualifying as a juridical Bay Mr. Justice Rehnquist.
1974.9_orig,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4451.552,4458.942,And do you say that we can offset the Master's finding just by looking at that map and kind of getting the sense of whether it's a bay or not?
1974.9_orig,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,4458.942,4464.939,"Well, nobody quite simply but that is the beginning."
1974.9_orig,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4505.855,4512.814,But it is -- if not technical at least it's objective and measurable isn't it?
1974.9_orig,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,4517.6,4518.523,"Yes, Mr. Justice Stewart."
1974.9_orig,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4541.736,4543.391,(Voice Overlap)
1974.9_orig,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,4543.391,4545.116,-- and decide.
1974.9_orig,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4725.628,4736.329,"Mr. Claiborne, may I ask looking at that not, what's the significance of that line below numeral 73?"
1974.9_orig,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,4736.329,4742.877,"That does just meant to indicate that the 73 relates to the measurement of the angle, Mr. Justice."
1974.9_orig,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4742.877,4744.492,"That's the degrees of angle, wasn't it?"
1974.9_orig,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,4744.492,4746.038,That's the degrees of angle.
1974.9_orig,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4764.806,4776.038,Where would then what's marked to East Bay could we ask to say the existence of bay?
1974.9_orig,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,4776.038,4776.517,Oh!
1974.9_orig,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4777.251,4777.931,I know.
1974.9_orig,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,4777.931,4782.438,It would indicate it Mr. Justice Brennan.
1974.9_orig,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4818.516,4821.003,Which one didn't find?
1974.9_orig,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,4821.003,4823.868,For a period in tool 1969.
1974.9_orig,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4879.01,4882.712,"Now, your point is that those are not headlands or what?"
1974.9_orig,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,4882.712,4887.967,That those are not natural entrance points of the bay.
1974.9_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4911.097,4913.118,But those bays are within East Bay?
1974.9_orig,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,4913.118,4914.373,Those bays are within East Bay.
1974.9_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4914.373,4917.093,And so there may be a bay within a bay?
1974.9_orig,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,4917.093,4917.832,Indeed.
1974.9_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4918.712,4925.457,Even though the bay in which it's a bay and which the one bay occurs isn't a juridical bay?
1974.9_orig,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,4925.457,4926.792,Indeed Mr. Justice White.
1974.9_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4940.558,4948.199,Would you concede that somewhere up in the -- would you concede to be on that line of bay?
1974.9_orig,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,4948.199,4948.709,Indeed.
1974.9_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4956.16,4956.794,Yes.
1974.9_orig,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,4956.794,4959.233,And first we concede that this is a bay.
1974.9_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4960.61,4961.01,Yes.
1974.9_orig,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,4961.01,4962.01,We concede that this --
1974.9_orig,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4962.01,4965.75,But those concessions you suggest have nothing to do with the (Voice Overlap).
1974.9_orig,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,4965.75,4966.9,It so happens.
1974.9_orig,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4969.011,4973.525,What do you mean precisely when you say that natural entrance points to a bay?
1974.9_orig,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,4977.15,4987.279,"I think one must look at it from the point of view of a mariner, Mr. Justice Rehnquist who is entering and who says to himself, “I am now within inland waters."
1974.9_orig,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4988.945,4994.305,But you don't enter certainly at the point closes to shore if you're entering the bay.
1974.9_orig,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,4994.305,5000.912,"Well, then it's perfectly sure that one might more logically enter at the center."
1974.9_orig,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,5000.912,5001.558,"Well, you would hope so."
1974.9_orig,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,5001.558,5013.89,"But in this case, one could see both shores of the distance not being great in the case of line D."
1974.9_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5014.579,5017.776,(Voice Overlap) The water is something quite different?
1974.9_orig,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,5023.52,5026.157,"Well, internal waters -- inland waters --"
1974.9_orig,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5026.157,5032.597,"Are there navigator of a ship has no ways in inland waters, that's actually the coastguard line."
1974.9_orig,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,5032.597,5033.462,"Well, but you see --"
1974.9_orig,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5033.462,5035.737,Anyone has nothing to do whether not you're not in a bay?
1974.9_orig,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,5035.737,5046.156,"Using inland, Mr. Justice Stewart in the sense in which the Submerged Lands Act uses inland or internal waters in the sense in which the convention uses internal."
1974.9_orig,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5046.156,5055.839,"Inland waters has a term of our having to do with the rules of the road for mares, it has nothing to do with whether or not you are in a bay."
1974.9_orig,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,5058.136,5076.676,"But Mr. Justice Stewart, this Court has used the term inland waters as the grant states this court has said begins at the seaward limit of inland waters and it's that use of inland waters that I'm talking about."
1974.9_orig,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5092.602,5099.04,"But there are many inland waters -- there are inland waters many, many times when you are not in the bay."
1974.9_orig,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,5103.046,5137.65,"But in answer to Mr. Justice Rehnquist, I would say that one has to be able to determine whether it's from a plane or a ship or from the shore that one has seas to be in waters that appertained the open sea and has reached waters which are landlocked which are internal, which are defined by headlands preferably pinched headlands and which therefore --"
1974.9_orig,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,5137.65,5142.497,Wasn't that the purpose of the convention to enable you to make that sort of a definition?
1974.9_orig,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,5142.497,5143.42,Exactly.
1974.9_orig,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,5196.826,5203.211,Are we supposed to open protractors to conference on Friday and try to figure this thing out for ourselves?
1974.9_orig,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,5215.197,5224.595,What I did try to say Mr. Justice Rehnquist that I think he began from the wrong starting point followed the wrong path and therefore reached the wrong result.
1974.9_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5247.568,5247.772,"Well, then the --"
1974.9_orig,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,5247.772,5253.314,Whereas this Court had very clearly said you begin the other way and so does the convention.
1974.9_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5253.314,5256.485,"But he did hunt for headlands, apparently?"
1974.9_orig,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,5256.485,5260.223,He conceded headlands just the two of them is more fair Mr. Justice White.
1974.9_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5260.223,5273.236,"Well, it is so but he didn't just say well, at any point along the smooth coastline, I can mark the beginning of the day just because that's where the bay satisfies the semicircle test."
1974.9_orig,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,5273.236,5279.099,"Well, I certainly don't wish to overstate the Master's decision."
1974.9_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5287.475,5291.399,(Voice Overlap) of the convention aren't you that for this definition.
1974.9_orig,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,5291.399,5292.8,Indeed.
1974.9_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5349.878,5354.286,And the special Master rejected Louisiana's arbitrary right?
1974.9_orig,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,5354.286,5355.025,Indeed.
1974.9_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5356.984,5359.12,So it's purported to follow your rules.
1974.9_orig,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,5361.266,5369.66,"Well, I -- I don't know about, well if I suppose the Master purported to follow my rule."
1974.9_orig,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,5437.538,5443.981,"Mr. Claiborne, what's the nautical mile distance and the line he finally found?"
1974.9_orig,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,5445.615,5446.696,D.
1974.9_orig,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,5448.329,5458.157,"Looking from here, it seems it would be about five, is it?"
1974.9_orig,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,5458.157,5464.616,It would appear to be approximately 4-1/2 nautical miles.
1974.9_orig,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5589.178,5595.638,"Mr. Claiborne, has it much been royal explorations seaward lines C or D?"
1974.9_orig,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,5595.638,5597.484,There has indeed.
1974.9_orig,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,5617.932,5621.838,C would be the equivalent of the low water part base and venue where you work out.
1974.9_orig,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,5621.838,5622.225,Indeed.
1974.9_orig,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5624.877,5634.214,The bays whether is the -- we're now trying to determine the coastline and Louisiana owns three nautical miles out from the coastline.
1974.9_orig,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,5634.214,5644.307,That is right and the coastline is defined either as the low water line the long and open coast or as the seaward limit of inland waters in a bay.
1974.9_orig,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5644.307,5646.859,I thought only the latter that causes all these problems.
1974.9_orig,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,5646.859,5647.838,And it's only the latter.
1974.9_orig,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5647.838,5649.676,The latter part of the depth.
1974.9_orig,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,5649.676,5651.058,That they're all issues.
1974.9_orig,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,5732.237,5733.296,Which bay is this --
1974.9_orig,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,5733.296,5736.498,-- begins.
1974.9_orig,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,5736.498,5738.738,-- two?
1974.9_orig,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,5738.738,5742.047,"Indeed, number two."
1974.9_orig,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5917.247,5921.15,Which one who's the Master's line?
1974.9_orig,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,5921.15,5926.42,Mr. Chief Justice the Master suggested that one line was the red one.
1974.9_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5965.947,5974.9,"Let's assume the Master -- assuming the Master is correct in the point besides they then the parties are in the brief, worth 25 or 24 miles."
1974.9_orig,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,5974.9,5979.098,Entirely right Mr. Justice White.
1974.9_orig,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5979.098,5985.791,"Well, let's see if the Master sustained what remains to be done to locate them?"
1974.9_orig,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,5987.908,5990.685,Nothing remains to be done if the Master is sustained.
1974.9_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5990.685,5994.157,"If the line exists at all, you say there is no bay at all."
1974.9_orig,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,5994.157,6004.422,We say there is no bay and we say that because the point on the west which has been chosen if it's the Belle Pass jetties.
1974.9_orig,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6154.14,6164.508,You mean in order to meet the initial tests of a well-marked indentation it has to have that sort of configuration?
1974.9_orig,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,6164.508,6172.505,"Mr. Justice Stewart, I would say to meet the combined test of having a well-marked indentation that encloses landlocked waters."
1974.9_orig,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,6499.105,6513.679,"Mr. Claiborne, I understood in your comment, do I understand you to say that only Long Island Sound has been -- is an historic bay on the United States coast?"
1974.9_orig,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,6513.679,6518.317,That is the fact Mr. Justice Blackmun.
1974.9_orig,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,6556.809,6560.399,This is why then Connecticut there's not a party doing next case.
1974.9_orig,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,6560.399,6562.282,"I think that is the answer, Mr. Justice Blackmun."
1974.9_orig,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,6562.282,6568.266,"Of course you have a district court decision against you in Cook Inlet, don't you?"
1974.9_orig,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,6568.266,6582.418,We do but the best the Court has run its certiorari in that case and we do not acquiesce in the ruling of either the District Court or the Court of Appeal in the Alaska case.
1974.9_orig,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,6582.418,6584.816,Thank you Mr. Claiborne.
1974.9_orig,3,37588,oliver_p_stockwell,,6588.16,6598.886,"In connection with the question of Justice Blackmun, I think the United States recognize just East Bay and Delaware Bay as historical bays."
1974.9_orig,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,6601.593,6604.264,Didn't they meet the juridical bay requirements?
1974.9_orig,3,37588,oliver_p_stockwell,,6604.264,6605.355,I think they do now.
1974.9_orig,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,7050.501,7051.866,Thank you Mr. Stockwell.
