1997.96-910,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,4.748,"We'll hear argument now in Number 96-910, the City of Chicago v. The International College of Surgeons."
1997.96-910,0,18072,benna_ruth_solomon,,6.763,9.778,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1997.96-910,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,46.451,48.372,"That's a little odd, isn't it?"
1997.96-910,0,18072,benna_ruth_solomon,,52.09,66.707,"--Your Honor, we find that on Federal questions the Federal courts have more expertise with the questions, they tend to see them more often, and we find that that gives us greater predictability as we try to assess litigation risks."
1997.96-910,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,89.933,92.291,"Well, this was a mix of issues."
1997.96-910,0,18072,benna_ruth_solomon,,109.596,111.83,"Respondents sought a variety of things, Your Honor."
1997.96-910,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,144.941,171.665,"But to the extent this was brought as a review of a municipal agency decision, to the extent that this was a review of the decision of the Landmarks Commission, I was struck by the comment that the Ninth Circuit made in its recent decision that the prospect of a Federal court sitting as an appellate court over State administrative proceedings is rather jarring."
1997.96-910,0,18072,benna_ruth_solomon,,184.19,196.217,"Justice Ginsburg, the Ninth Circuit case, like the Armistead case and the Fairfax County case that were also recently decided in the courts of appeals, are diversity cases."
1997.96-910,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,205.199,255.553,"But my question was the function of lower appellate courts vis-a-vis State agencies, and even in the Federal question domain, I know of no precedent where a district court, or even a court of appeals, sits as an appellate reviewer as distinguished from... a case might come up, say on habeas, on collateral review, but to my knowledge only this Court, from the highest court of the State, acts in the direct review line, so I don't know any precedent for this Court, for a lower court, for a district court sitting in direct review of a decision of a State agency."
1997.96-910,0,18072,benna_ruth_solomon,,255.553,258.099,"Our argument on that, Your Honor, is in two parts."
1997.96-910,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,283.151,299.145,"But when one challenges an agency action, say, a liquor license or funeral home license, one challenges a State or local agency decision and normally brings up all possible arguments."
1997.96-910,0,18072,benna_ruth_solomon,,321.214,327.837,"Our argument, Your Honor, rests on the plain language of section 1441, which permits--"
1997.96-910,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,327.837,332.632,"Well, do I follow... I followed your argument and it seemed to me that was right."
1997.96-910,0,18072,benna_ruth_solomon,,363.618,364.633,--Your Honor is correct.
1997.96-910,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,446.507,448.757,At what point did it become a civil action?
1997.96-910,0,18072,benna_ruth_solomon,,453.863,455.722,"--We don't make that argument, Justice O'Connor."
1997.96-910,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,455.722,456.612,"Well, what is your answer?"
1997.96-910,0,18072,benna_ruth_solomon,,456.612,457.736,Our answer is--
1997.96-910,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,457.736,459.955,Was it a civil action at that stage?
1997.96-910,0,18072,benna_ruth_solomon,,459.955,460.548,--It was not.
1997.96-910,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,490.551,498.017,So it becomes a civil action at the first time that it goes to a State court of general jurisdiction?
1997.96-910,0,18072,benna_ruth_solomon,,499.235,501.032,"At a minimum, Your Honor, yes."
1997.96-910,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,501.032,505.733,"--Well, isn't the term civil action kind of a word of art?"
1997.96-910,0,18072,benna_ruth_solomon,,514.073,519.914,"Well, the term civil action, as we describe in our brief, is a historical term."
1997.96-910,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,552.276,580.843,"So that, to follow up on Justice Ginsburg's earlier questions, and she indicated that this was jarring, in California as in some other States there are certain agencies whose findings are conclusive, and review is then in the State court of appeals, so that's the point at which, when the aggrieved party goes to the State court of appeals, there could be an action in United States district... it could be removed to the United States district court?"
1997.96-910,0,18072,benna_ruth_solomon,,580.843,592.854,"Justice Kennedy, it might be different in some other situations, but what we have here in this case was a complaint filed in the Circuit Court of Cook County, and at that point we filed a notice of removal to--"
1997.96-910,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,592.854,601.538,"What about the instance I explained, where you go from the agency directly to the three-judge court of appeals in California."
1997.96-910,0,18072,benna_ruth_solomon,,601.538,602.194,--I--
1997.96-910,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,602.194,610.066,"It's State system, and as I understand your argument, at that point the defendant could remove to a United States district court."
1997.96-910,0,18072,benna_ruth_solomon,,610.066,615.297,--I would see no basis for saying that that was something other than a civil action.
1997.96-910,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,621.936,622.217,So you can remove.
1997.96-910,0,18072,benna_ruth_solomon,,622.217,628.09,"--I would see no reason why it could not be, but of course that is not this case."
1997.96-910,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,632.244,633.4,But it would be just as straightforward.
1997.96-910,0,18072,benna_ruth_solomon,,642.037,656.187,"--Our point, Your Honor, yes, is that any... by the plain terms of section 1441, a statute that Congress wrote providing for the removal jurisdiction, a civil action within the original jurisdiction of the--"
1997.96-910,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,656.187,670.026,"Stop right there, because there in your prior statement seems to put you out of the 1441 territory, a civil action that could originally be commenced in the Federal court."
1997.96-910,0,18072,benna_ruth_solomon,,690.722,693.002,"--We don't see that, Justice Ginsburg."
1997.96-910,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,739.45,743.043,But you just said it doesn't become a Federal case until it's first filed in a State court.
1997.96-910,0,18072,benna_ruth_solomon,,743.043,744.496,Right.
1997.96-910,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,744.496,753.884,"You now seem to be saying they could have gone from the Landmarks Commission directly into Federal court, passing any State court forum."
1997.96-910,0,18072,benna_ruth_solomon,,753.884,755.726,"I'm sorry if I was unclear, Justice Ginsburg."
1997.96-910,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,776.968,787.76,"But you're not saying that someone seeking review of the Landmarks Commission could file directly in Federal court before it had gone to the State court, have you... are you?"
1997.96-910,0,18072,benna_ruth_solomon,,790.088,797.053,"--Your Honor, we do take that position, and I don't think it's counter to the Stude case, if I could explain."
1997.96-910,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,797.053,797.803,Yes.
1997.96-910,0,18072,benna_ruth_solomon,,797.803,811.921,"The Stude case, as you are aware, had two portions, one seeking an original filing in the district court and the other seeking removal on the basis of diversity."
1997.96-910,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,888.125,890.827,"Horton was filed initially in the Federal court, right?"
1997.96-910,0,18072,benna_ruth_solomon,,892.139,893.421,"--Horton was filed... I misspoke, Your Honor."
1997.96-910,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,894.732,906.337,"--And the Court there said, under that Texas scheme, the administrative procedure, it's as though it didn't exist, because you start it all over in Federal court, so it wasn't a review of any administrative decision."
1997.96-910,0,18072,benna_ruth_solomon,,906.337,907.68,"That is correct, Your Honor, and that is--"
1997.96-910,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,907.68,908.462,That's how... go ahead.
1997.96-910,0,18072,benna_ruth_solomon,,908.462,910.617,--That is why the parties here agree--
1997.96-910,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,910.617,913.115,"And that's how it's distinguished from Stude, was it not?"
1997.96-910,0,18072,benna_ruth_solomon,,913.115,926.266,"--This case is the first case to come before the Court seeking either removal or an original filing of a case that includes, as one component... and I want to be very clear about that."
1997.96-910,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,934.482,934.935,It--
1997.96-910,0,18072,benna_ruth_solomon,,960.111,961.955,"That is, of course, correct, Your Honor."
1997.96-910,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,994.426,997.051,Do we have the abstention issue before us?
1997.96-910,0,18072,benna_ruth_solomon,,997.051,1004.625,"I don't believe you do, Your Honor, but the abstention in any event... abstention doctrine recognizes jurisdiction."
1997.96-910,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1011.513,1022.572,"Because it could not have originally... because a proceeding to review an agency decision, in the views of the Seventh Circuit, could not originally have been commenced in the Federal court."
1997.96-910,0,18072,benna_ruth_solomon,,1022.572,1031.255,"--I think more precisely, Your Honor, it is that because one portion of the complaint would not be reviewed de novo--"
1997.96-910,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1031.255,1039.688,"To the extent that it was a proceeding to review the Landmarks Commission decision, it could not have been brought in the Federal court."
1997.96-910,0,18072,benna_ruth_solomon,,1041.375,1043.313,"--And as a result, none of it could."
1997.96-910,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1059.869,1074.565,"If you were concerned about having access to the Federal forum on the Federal question, the due process question, could you not have done before the State court something comparable to what was done in the England case?"
1997.96-910,0,18072,benna_ruth_solomon,,1107.443,1122.827,"Your Honor, as I understand the England reservation, it is a basis to avoid decision of the Federal claims of... if the State claims are remanded, not as an original matter within the State court, but--"
1997.96-910,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1122.827,1126.138,"I don't mean that, precisely that pattern."
1997.96-910,0,18072,benna_ruth_solomon,,1134.604,1141.382,--There are a variety of techniques that are available to the district courts to avoid deciding the State law claims.
1997.96-910,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1145.88,1161.359,"Well, I understood Justice Ginsburg to be interested in what the State court could do to go ahead and resolve State issues and not decide the Federal law questions, but I suppose the State court wouldn't have to refrain."
1997.96-910,0,18072,benna_ruth_solomon,,1161.359,1163.216,"--I think that's right, Justice O'Connor."
1997.96-910,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1170.089,1175.978,"There's no Federal rule that says, State court you have to lay off because the City of Chicago doesn't want you to hear it."
1997.96-910,0,18072,benna_ruth_solomon,,1175.978,1185.974,--Nor even any requirement like the Pullman doctrine that the State courts should not decide constitutional questions first.
1997.96-910,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1185.974,1201.669,"Ms. Solomon, in the Stude opinion at page 581 the Court says, the United States District Court for the Southern District of Iowa does not sit to review on appeal action taken administratively or judicially in a State proceeding."
1997.96-910,0,18072,benna_ruth_solomon,,1270.83,1290.743,"I would until you get to Califano v. Sanders, Your Honor, and Califano v. Sanders clearly holds that Federal administrative review actions under the Administrative Procedure Act, which in the vast, vast majority of cases require deferential review, are civil actions within original jurisdiction under 1331."
1997.96-910,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1299.022,1322.95,"But it was really en passant in Sanders, wasn't it, because the main thing that was held there was that you didn't have 1331 review in these social security cases and, as I recall, didn't the Chief write separately to say there was no need to discuss 1331 at all, because the review route under the Social Security Act was 205?"
1997.96-910,0,18072,benna_ruth_solomon,,1322.95,1337.6,"--The question in Califano, Your Honor, as we understand it was, is there jurisdiction under the Administrative Procedure Act itself, and in that sense the Court did kind of back into the discussion on 1331."
1997.96-910,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1339.896,1340.709,"Well, but--"
1997.96-910,0,18072,benna_ruth_solomon,,1340.709,1341.131,The whole--
1997.96-910,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1341.131,1344.066,"--what I meant was that Sanders was a social security review case, right?"
1997.96-910,0,18072,benna_ruth_solomon,,1344.066,1346.3,"--That was the factual situation, Your Honor."
1997.96-910,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1346.3,1356.062,"And the Court said... the holding was you don't have 1331 available there, because you have only 205."
1997.96-910,0,18072,benna_ruth_solomon,,1356.062,1369.057,"The holding as we understand it, Your Honor, is that you don't have administrative jurisdiction directly under the Administrative Procedure Act, and that was the question the Court granted certiorari on because it was a conflict in the circuits on that question."
1997.96-910,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1391.798,1403.293,"Well, I don't want to quibble about what Sanders held versus what it says en passant, because you're unquestionably right that under the APA 1331 now, without the amount--"
1997.96-910,0,18072,benna_ruth_solomon,,1403.293,1403.714,"--Right, and--"
1997.96-910,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1403.714,1424.206,"--controversy, works, but do you think that the part when it was talking about review of Federal agency decisions had in mind at all that every municipal agency, every county agency, every State agency by virtue of that decision was going to come into Federal court initially as a civil action?"
1997.96-910,0,18072,benna_ruth_solomon,,1424.206,1429.314,"--Well, of course, the Court was construing the statute there, and we are attempting to do that here as well."
1997.96-910,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1436.639,1450.742,"But if it doesn't, if, as Strudesaid... and maybe Strude got this point wrong... if it doesn't become a civil action until it's lodged in a State court, then it could not have been commenced originally."
1997.96-910,0,18072,benna_ruth_solomon,,1453.694,1460.473,I hope I haven't confused the... our argument here.
1997.96-910,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1500.363,1502.097,"Well, but may I interrupt you there?"
1997.96-910,0,18072,benna_ruth_solomon,,1569.585,1573.832,"I think, Your Honor, the simple answer is because the language won't allow it."
1997.96-910,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1578.707,1578.941,Why?
1997.96-910,0,18072,benna_ruth_solomon,,1589.858,1605.851,"--But these are two jurisdictional statutes, 1341, and if ever there is a reason and a place to be clear about the meaning, it is in the jurisdictional statutes, otherwise you have people litigating to judgment only to find out they were in the wrong court."
1997.96-910,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1620.563,1630.013,"When you talk about abstention, are you talking about exercise... about declining to exercise supplemental jurisdiction--"
1997.96-910,0,18072,benna_ruth_solomon,,1630.013,1630.81,--I am.
1997.96-910,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1630.81,1632.637,--under section 1367?
1997.96-910,0,18072,benna_ruth_solomon,,1632.637,1635.105,As well as the... as other abstention doctrines.
1997.96-910,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1637.464,1640.103,"Very well, Ms. Solomon."
1997.96-910,1,38736,richard_j_brennan,,1641.228,1646.132,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1997.96-910,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1724.85,1743.217,"May I ask, is it your position that the complaint for administrative review that you just did... that you did file, if you just changed the caption of it as... called it civil action in Federal court under 1983, or something like that, that had exactly the same allegations in it, could you have filed it originally in the United States district court?"
1997.96-910,1,38736,richard_j_brennan,,1743.217,1744.452,"No, we could not have, Your Honor--"
1997.96-910,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1744.452,1745.17,Why not?
1997.96-910,1,38736,richard_j_brennan,,1745.17,1756.119,"--and the reason we could not have is because that cause of action arises out of a final decision of an administrative agency, and therefore that case, if we tried to file it--"
1997.96-910,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1756.119,1762.881,Even the aspects of it in which you allege the ordinances are unconstitutional under both the Federal and State constitution on their face?
1997.96-910,1,38736,richard_j_brennan,,1762.881,1774.267,"--If they were combined together, if that cause of action had sought review of both the adminis... the final decision and also had a count under 1983, that--"
1997.96-910,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1774.267,1779.766,"No, I'm assuming the complaint is word-for-word the same, except the jurisdictional allegation's a little different."
1997.96-910,1,38736,richard_j_brennan,,1782.296,1782.671,--Right.
1997.96-910,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1782.671,1783.171,--and so forth and so on.
1997.96-910,1,38736,richard_j_brennan,,1783.171,1811.956,"And we could not have filed that because this lawsuit, this dispute is not a civil action within the original jurisdiction of the district court because it comes out of, it arises out of a final decision of an administrative agency, and so the terms in the statutes, in the removal statute and the jurisdictional statute, which speak in terms of a civil action of which the court has original jurisdiction, this is not that kind of a case."
1997.96-910,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1813.704,1825.857,"Why should a precisely identical case involving the Federal agency be a civil action, whereas this is not a civil action?"
1997.96-910,1,38736,richard_j_brennan,,1830.277,1830.604,--Sure.
1997.96-910,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1830.604,1831.26,--in the two situations.
1997.96-910,1,38736,richard_j_brennan,,1840.803,1845.348,"Your Honor, I think the answer is very clear and is very simple, and it's found in Califano."
1997.96-910,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1879.756,1887.019,"I'm sorry, 1331 says that actions can be brought challenging decisions of Federal agencies?"
1997.96-910,1,38736,richard_j_brennan,,1887.019,1891.345,I think that's the import of the holding in Califano.
1997.96-910,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1891.345,1897.625,What it says in 1331 is that district courts shall have original jurisdiction of all civil actions--
1997.96-910,1,38736,richard_j_brennan,,1899.905,1900.374,Correct.
1997.96-910,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1900.374,1914.586,"And so I think the question was, or at least mine would be, which I think is the same, how can it be a civil action if what you're asking for is to review a Federal administrative agency, but suddenly it isn't a civil action when what you're asking for is to review a State agency?"
1997.96-910,1,38736,richard_j_brennan,,1914.586,1923.52,"And I believe the answer to that is that you have to look at the entire jurisdictional language, which is a civil action arising under the original--"
1997.96-910,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1923.52,1930.095,"Oh, absolutely you're quite correct that a State agency is a civil action not arising under the Constitution."
1997.96-910,1,38736,richard_j_brennan,,1932.282,1932.657,"--No, it says--"
1997.96-910,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1932.657,1947.511,"It would be in court because it is a civil action which is removable because it is, in fact, a claim so related to claims in the action that they're part of the same case or controversy."
1997.96-910,1,38736,richard_j_brennan,,1950.977,1973.265,"--Well, I think that's a 1441(c) analogy, but I think in either case the conclusion and the analysis, the correct analysis and the bar is that this civil action is not an action of which the district court has original jurisdiction because it comes out of a final decision of an administrative agency."
1997.96-910,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1973.265,1976.28,"And then now the question is, why does that make a difference?"
1997.96-910,1,38736,richard_j_brennan,,1976.28,1985.245,"Because all of the jurisdictional statutes use the phrase, a civil action of which the district court has original jurisdiction, and--"
1997.96-910,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1985.245,1992.961,"Are you relying on what the Strude case said about, it doesn't become a civil action until it's lodged in State court."
1997.96-910,1,38736,richard_j_brennan,,2010.094,2036.131,"--Justice Ginsburg, as I read Stude and Horton and the four circuit courts of appeals that have addressed this issue, it seems to me that the initial inquiry all four of those courts have made is, what is the nature of the action, and when the action arises to challenge a decision of a State administrative agency, it then becomes in nature an appellate case, and is not within the original jurisdiction of the--"
1997.96-910,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2036.131,2044.439,"But you just said you could have... you could have forgotten all about the State review proceeding, and you could have brought a 1983 action."
1997.96-910,1,38736,richard_j_brennan,,2044.439,2045.127,--That's correct.
1997.96-910,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2045.127,2047.594,And then you could have gone into Federal court.
1997.96-910,1,38736,richard_j_brennan,,2063.935,2067.84,"I don't believe I could have combined the two of them at all, Your Honor."
1997.96-910,2,18072,benna_ruth_solomon,,3321.725,3323.787,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1997.96-910,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3355.305,3366.285,"I believe their position was that it wouldn't satisfy... at least that was the implication, I think, of Justice Stevens' question, that it wouldn't satisfy a separate and independent claim."
1997.96-910,2,18072,benna_ruth_solomon,,3373.126,3373.923,We--
1997.96-910,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3373.923,3382.029,"--then the... there is no separate, separation between those two because they're so tied together by the facts."
1997.96-910,2,18072,benna_ruth_solomon,,3382.029,3390.979,"--1441(c) we think comes into play only if 1441(a) is not sufficient, and we think 1441(a) is sufficient."
1997.96-910,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3398.162,3399.037,What's your response to my argument?
1997.96-910,2,18072,benna_ruth_solomon,,3400.146,3401.178,--Arising under--
1997.96-910,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3401.178,3415.234,"My suggested reading, that although the claim is a Federal claim, that the viewing the action as a whole as distinguished from claims in the supplemental jurisdiction statute... you use the word claims, not actions... that the action itself didn't arise under the Federal law."
1997.96-910,2,18072,benna_ruth_solomon,,3415.234,3432.369,"--Our response to that quite simply is the Gully test, the Gully test of arising under any right or immunity as in the claims that <ICS> [= ICS] alleged in this case, the Federal constitutional claims would be decided solely by reference to the Federal Constitution."
1997.96-910,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3505.588,3507.619,"Thank you, Ms. Solomon."
