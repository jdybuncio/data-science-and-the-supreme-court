1999.98-1696,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,7.754,"We'll hear argument now in Number 98-1696, The United States v. Roy Lee Johnson."
1999.98-1696,0,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,10.122,12.724,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1999.98-1696,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,48.581,70.929,"Suppose that you don't have the situation which existed here, where he was wrongfully convicted and serving a term on a wrongful conviction, but suppose that just in violation of his rights the prison keeps him in for 3 years after the... his term of proper conviction had actually expired."
1999.98-1696,0,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,82.737,83.32,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1999.98-1696,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,87.639,87.922,Well--
1999.98-1696,0,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,87.922,93.86,"He could, however, move under section 3583 for reduction in his term of supervised release."
1999.98-1696,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,93.86,96.212,"--Which would be discretionary, with approval?"
1999.98-1696,0,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,96.212,97.128,"That would be discretionary, yes."
1999.98-1696,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,97.128,99.747,"Well, I... it doesn't seem to me this ought to be discretionary."
1999.98-1696,0,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,99.747,100.366,That would--
1999.98-1696,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,100.366,115.208,"Why can't we interpret the words, does not run during any period in which the person is imprisoned in connection with a conviction, why can't we interpret that to mean reasonably, properly imprisoned in connection with a conviction?"
1999.98-1696,0,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,115.208,124.231,"--Well, that would still be inconsistent with the earlier sentence in that same provision that says the term of supervised release commences on the day the person is released from imprisonment."
1999.98-1696,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,129.183,136.122,What is... is there a statute that governs the service of consecutive sentences?
1999.98-1696,0,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,136.122,138.289,"Yes, there is."
1999.98-1696,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,147.596,150.714,"And all sentences shall be aggregated, what does that mean?"
1999.98-1696,0,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,150.714,160.404,"That has the effect of, if one sentence happens to be vacated defendant will automatically receive credit against a subsequent consecutive sentence."
1999.98-1696,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,160.404,190.939,"Suppose the statute didn't read that, and suppose that a person is serving consecutive sentences under a provision either in the statute or in the judicial sentence which says his time for the second conviction shall not begin to run until the service of his time for the first conviction has expired, all right, and then it turns out that the first conviction was improper."
1999.98-1696,0,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,198.259,203.93,We would still require him to serve a term of supervised release if there was still a term of--
1999.98-1696,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,203.93,204.513,I'm not talking about supervised release.
1999.98-1696,0,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,208.632,209.332,--The courts--
1999.98-1696,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,209.332,210.817,The first term is invalidated.
1999.98-1696,0,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,211.901,212.603,--Uh-huh.
1999.98-1696,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,212.603,213.803,--5-year terms.
1999.98-1696,0,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,218.589,219.039,Uh-huh.
1999.98-1696,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,219.039,222.891,"And then you say, well, sorry for that mistake, but here's the second term of 5 years."
1999.98-1696,0,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,224.66,227.528,There could conceivably be a due process problem with that.
1999.98-1696,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,256.213,256.981,Right.
1999.98-1696,0,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,256.981,259.314,This could conceivably be a different situation.
1999.98-1696,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,259.314,263.285,But if it were the same sovereign there might be a due process problem?
1999.98-1696,0,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,263.285,264.635,There could conceivably be.
1999.98-1696,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,264.635,271.222,Why might there not be a due process problem where the second sentence is a sentence to supervised release?
1999.98-1696,0,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,271.222,275.676,Because supervised release serves different purposes than a term of imprisonment.
1999.98-1696,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,280.83,291.036,"But you're not... I mean, it may serve different purposes, but you're not entitled to force someone to undergo it except as punishment for a crime, right?"
1999.98-1696,0,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,291.036,301.16,"That's true, but in this case, in the case I conceive we're talking about, the defendant still has a valid term of supervised release attached to a valid conviction."
1999.98-1696,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,303.126,303.476,"Oh, but--"
1999.98-1696,0,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,303.476,305.128,--serve a term of supervised release otherwise.
1999.98-1696,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,305.128,309.932,--you say there may be a due process problem in forcing him to serve the second conviction.
1999.98-1696,0,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,322.924,323.39,It may be--
1999.98-1696,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,323.39,332.53,"And if there is a due process problem, why shouldn't we strain to interpret this statute in order to avoid the due process problem?"
1999.98-1696,0,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,332.53,337.834,"--Well, the only conceivable due process problem would be in the context of two terms of imprisonment."
1999.98-1696,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,355.478,356.245,At the discretion of the court.
1999.98-1696,0,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,356.245,357.163,At the discretion of the court.
1999.98-1696,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,357.163,357.73,That's very nice.
1999.98-1696,0,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,365.517,374.271,"That's correct, Your Honor, but in this case there are still valid convictions to which the term of supervised release was attached."
1999.98-1696,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,374.271,382.21,"Now, here, the supervised release was ordered in connection with the drug offenses which--"
1999.98-1696,0,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,382.21,382.843,That's correct.
1999.98-1696,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,382.843,391.632,"--were not the offenses, the gun-related offense that was wrongfully imposed?"
1999.98-1696,0,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,391.632,392.834,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1999.98-1696,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,399.588,408.527,And what has happened to this... to Mr. Johnson since the Sixth Circuit decision?
1999.98-1696,0,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,411.962,412.479,No.
1999.98-1696,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,415.7,416.016,Uh-huh.
1999.98-1696,0,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,416.016,419.318,--and served somewhat in excess of 2 years on supervised release.
1999.98-1696,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,421.687,422.154,And off--
1999.98-1696,0,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,422.154,423.254,--upon the court of appeals decision.
1999.98-1696,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,423.254,430.19,"--supervision, and the consequences of a reversal here would be that he would go back on for a period of--"
1999.98-1696,0,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,430.19,430.625,That's correct.
1999.98-1696,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,442.267,444.9,--Would you oppose that motion?
1999.98-1696,0,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,444.9,447.485,Not knowing the particular circumstances of this defendant--
1999.98-1696,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,447.485,448.254,"I mean, this is Christmas time, almost."
1999.98-1696,0,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,448.837,449.421,--it's difficult to say.
1999.98-1696,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,510.21,536.793,"What of the argument that you have to give credit for even periods of liberty erroneously granted, that that counts against the sentence if they let you out by mistake, and then you get it all back, the time that you were out counts as part of your sentence, and the anomaly that you don't get credit for time wrongfully served in prison?"
1999.98-1696,0,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,536.793,543.531,"It's questionable, Your Honor, whether the doctrine that you're referring to, the common law doctrine, has any continuing validity."
1999.98-1696,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,559.058,564.712,You could argue that that rule is thoroughly in accord with the rule that you're arguing for.
1999.98-1696,0,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,583.258,590.012,"--Well, the doctrine has been applied only in circumstances where the Government is negligent or at greater fault."
1999.98-1696,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,604.671,611.825,Do you agree with Justice Scalia's comment that this statute has a punitive... that supervisory release is a form of punishment?
1999.98-1696,0,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,611.825,614.443,"There may be punitive aspects to it, Your Honor."
1999.98-1696,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,614.443,616.479,It's not entirely punitive.
1999.98-1696,0,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,616.479,618.062,"It's principle purpose, as conceived by Congress, was not punitive."
1999.98-1696,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,618.062,619.931,At least there is an element of punishment here.
1999.98-1696,0,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,619.931,620.881,"There may well be, yes."
1999.98-1696,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,620.881,626.617,"And what is that element, simply the fact that he is required to report periodically, or what-not?"
1999.98-1696,0,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,626.617,628.702,"Your Honor, that's part of it."
1999.98-1696,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,631.504,635.106,"He's deprived of certain liberties that ordinary citizens don't have, isn't that right?"
1999.98-1696,0,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,635.106,639.492,"Well, he's required, for example, to maintain a job, to go to substance abuse counseling--"
1999.98-1696,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,639.492,640.094,Right.
1999.98-1696,0,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,640.094,644.296,--not to leave the district without seeking permission from his probation officer or the court--
1999.98-1696,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,644.296,645.646,Cannot carry firearms.
1999.98-1696,0,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,645.646,647.598,--That's correct.
1999.98-1696,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,647.598,652.335,What's the... what is the rehabilitative aspect of it?
1999.98-1696,0,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,667.993,669.243,Yes.
1999.98-1696,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,695.66,697.762,"It's a lot like parole, then?"
1999.98-1696,0,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,697.762,700.28,"--It's quite similar, in this aspect, to parole."
1999.98-1696,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,711.755,725.431,"If this defendant were to violate his terms of supervised release, what would be the maximum liability that he would have for that violation?"
1999.98-1696,0,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,725.431,730.383,"Conceivably, at least 4 years."
1999.98-1696,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,787.07,788.005,"Very well, Ms. McDowell."
1999.98-1696,1,33977,kevin_m_schad,,791.124,802.181,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1999.98-1696,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,902.961,904.495,What is the date May 1996?
1999.98-1696,1,33977,kevin_m_schad,,905.997,917.202,--In May of 1996 there was a bond hearing and Judge Gilmore of the United States District Court of the Eastern District of Michigan at that point overturned the 924(c) conviction.
1999.98-1696,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,919.802,920.404,I see.
1999.98-1696,1,33977,kevin_m_schad,,920.404,936.997,"And the Government's position, United States' position has been that supervised release began to run on that day, so if you take that starting date and play that out for the entire 3 years, then even now the United States is not entitled to any relief in this case."
1999.98-1696,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,936.997,941.233,"Well, why does the United States say that he is not on supervised release now?"
1999.98-1696,1,33977,kevin_m_schad,,943.567,961.093,"Well, in... Justice Scalia, in fact the Sixth Circuit did overturn the portion of his supervised release in its decision of August of 1998, and the decision of the Sixth Circuit was transmitted up to the probation officer and in fact he has not been--"
1999.98-1696,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,961.093,961.579,I see.
1999.98-1696,1,33977,kevin_m_schad,,961.579,965.913,--The probation officer has not been supervising him since August of 1998.
1999.98-1696,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,965.913,977.788,"And there's nothing in the statute that requires that suspension to be tolled, that requires the supervised release time to be tolled by reason of that suspension?"
1999.98-1696,1,33977,kevin_m_schad,,977.788,1003.189,"That's correct, Justice Scalia, and the Government, the United States did not seek to stay the Sixth Circuit's decision pending this Court's decision, so in fact, even if this Court were to decide that in cases under 3624(e) the term of supervised release only begins to run on the day they're actually released from prison, we would argue that it wouldn't make a difference in this particular defendant's case."
1999.98-1696,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1003.189,1007.573,But it would until... you said it ran out in May 1999?
1999.98-1696,1,33977,kevin_m_schad,,1007.573,1008.842,That's correct.
1999.98-1696,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1009.892,1013.477,"So that under... why do you... I mean, what are we arguing about?"
1999.98-1696,1,33977,kevin_m_schad,,1042.83,1043.414,Yes.
1999.98-1696,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1045.365,1048.734,"It's possible not all judges are thoroughly reasonable, I agree with that."
1999.98-1696,1,33977,kevin_m_schad,,1049.217,1051.452,"--To answer your question, Justice Breyer--"
1999.98-1696,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1051.452,1051.919,--Yes.
1999.98-1696,1,33977,kevin_m_schad,,1051.919,1078.004,"--even if there were no conditions of supervised release for that term of the year that this particular defendant would have to wait until supervised release was then terminated, he still has the problem of if he would commit another crime to the satisfaction of the probation officer he then can be brought up for supervised release revocation and be given the entire 3 years of supervised release at any time during that 1 year, so even--"
1999.98-1696,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1078.004,1082.391,"All right, so he has a special... that kind of special burden, and then let me ask you this question."
1999.98-1696,1,33977,kevin_m_schad,,1117.129,1123.116,"--Well, Justice Breyer, in that situation I don't know if crimes A and B are necessarily related to each other."
1999.98-1696,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1123.116,1124.151,"No, they're not related at all."
1999.98-1696,1,33977,kevin_m_schad,,1124.151,1126.084,Okay.
1999.98-1696,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1132.288,1144.296,"So if he's fined solely on crime A, which has nothing to do B, and it turns out that B was erroneous, not A, he has to give back the money on crime A?"
1999.98-1696,1,33977,kevin_m_schad,,1144.296,1146.414,--I do not believe--
1999.98-1696,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1146.414,1147.297,The Government has to give it back?
1999.98-1696,1,33977,kevin_m_schad,,1147.297,1147.664,--Yes.
1999.98-1696,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1150.347,1151.016,All right.
1999.98-1696,1,33977,kevin_m_schad,,1151.432,1151.982,--Certainly I would make that argument.
1999.98-1696,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1151.982,1154.318,"I agree with you, and I think it would be--"
1999.98-1696,1,33977,kevin_m_schad,,1164.307,1169.092,In supervised... in the time spent--
1999.98-1696,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1169.092,1171.608,"If you want to say, take the present case, I mean, that's what I'm--"
1999.98-1696,1,33977,kevin_m_schad,,1171.608,1171.942,--Okay.
1999.98-1696,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1192.873,1194.873,"--You know, I... you see, my question is--"
1999.98-1696,1,33977,kevin_m_schad,,1194.873,1195.357,I--
1999.98-1696,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1195.357,1211.252,"--if it doesn't affect part 2 of the punishment for the first crime, namely crime A, you know, why does it affect part 2, where the only difference is instead of a fine for crime A it's supervised release for crime A?"
1999.98-1696,1,33977,kevin_m_schad,,1211.252,1215.887,"--I do understand your question, Justice Breyer, and I don't know that I have an adequate answer for it."
1999.98-1696,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1215.887,1224.91,"Mr. Schad, if he's fined incorrectly for crime B, can he get the money back?"
1999.98-1696,1,33977,kevin_m_schad,,1224.91,1225.262,Yes.
1999.98-1696,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1226.245,1231.748,"If he's incarcerated incorrectly for crime B, can he get the time back?"
1999.98-1696,1,33977,kevin_m_schad,,1231.748,1233.582,"No, Justice Scalia."
1999.98-1696,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1233.582,1240.188,So it seems fair to give him the time back by not putting him in for the additional 5 years on crime A.
1999.98-1696,1,33977,kevin_m_schad,,1242.254,1243.056,"That's correct, Justice Scalia."
1999.98-1696,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1243.056,1251.227,The only way to give him the 5 years out of his life back is not to have the incarcerated release tolled against him.
1999.98-1696,1,33977,kevin_m_schad,,1251.227,1264.785,"Yes, Justice Scalia, and as a matter of fact there is no other way in this particular case, returning to the facts of this particular defendant, there is no other way to provide him with some relief for the time that he has spent in prison."
1999.98-1696,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1265.335,1292.102,"But what of the Government's argument that supervised release, although it may have a punitive aspect, is primarily designed to have the person monitored during his transition back into the community and, indeed, I think the Government says the serious business of the crime is not a factor in the term of supervised release, but rather the characteristics of the defendant."
1999.98-1696,1,33977,kevin_m_schad,,1292.102,1300.641,"--Well, Justice Ginsburg, in fact, when imposing a term of supervised release under the guidelines, the court is to look at the severity of the offense."
1999.98-1696,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1374.356,1382.212,"But there's certainly a difference in degree at least, isn't there, from the rehabilitative aspects of supervised release as opposed to a prison?"
1999.98-1696,1,33977,kevin_m_schad,,1382.212,1382.945,Yes.
1999.98-1696,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1396.537,1399.839,"Mr. Schad, the difficulty I have with your position is this."
1999.98-1696,1,33977,kevin_m_schad,,1473.555,1497.57,"Justice Souter, in this particular case, and with these particular facts, I would agree that Congress has spoken in those two particular areas, but in fact Congress presupposes... when it writes as to those issues it presupposes both a valid conviction and a valid term of supervised release."
1999.98-1696,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1513.763,1519.666,But isn't it true that we do have a valid conviction and a valid term of supervised release?
1999.98-1696,1,33977,kevin_m_schad,,1525.304,1537.212,"--As to the... yes, as to the drug offenses he does have a valid conviction, but as to the 924(c) counts, it was not a valid conviction when it was originally imposed by the sentencing court."
1999.98-1696,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1537.212,1542.449,"But the supervised release term is not dependant entirely on the 924(c) count, is it?"
1999.98-1696,1,33977,kevin_m_schad,,1542.449,1542.849,No.
1999.98-1696,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1543.968,1546.42,Suppose he's released improperly.
1999.98-1696,1,33977,kevin_m_schad,,1565.981,1566.947,Yes.
1999.98-1696,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1566.947,1567.449,They do?
1999.98-1696,1,33977,kevin_m_schad,,1567.449,1573.57,"Yes, they would, until the Government would bring him into court and request, I guess, anticredit--"
1999.98-1696,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1573.57,1573.987,That he be reincarcerated?
1999.98-1696,1,33977,kevin_m_schad,,1573.987,1574.387,--Yes.
1999.98-1696,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1574.387,1586.728,"So if he's walking around free for a year because there's been an administrative mistake, and then they yank him back in to serve the rest of his sentence, he would have had a year knocked off of his later supervised release time?"
1999.98-1696,1,33977,kevin_m_schad,,1586.728,1593.465,"That's correct, Your Honor, yes."
1999.98-1696,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1698.115,1703.353,"Whereas, what do you think the situation is, if he says, heck, no, I won't sign?"
1999.98-1696,1,33977,kevin_m_schad,,1705.971,1706.355,--Well--
1999.98-1696,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1706.355,1707.271,Turn him loose anyway?
1999.98-1696,1,33977,kevin_m_schad,,1707.271,1716.011,"--Under a literal reading of 3624(e) it would appear to me that he has to hold them until he agrees to sign, regardless of the prison term."
1999.98-1696,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1716.011,1718.963,Hold him until the supervised release period is over?
1999.98-1696,1,33977,kevin_m_schad,,1718.963,1719.479,That's correct.
1999.98-1696,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1719.848,1725.552,"In other words, if he refuses to sign, you convert his supervised release into an additional term of imprisonment."
1999.98-1696,1,33977,kevin_m_schad,,1725.552,1726.202,--And that's the--
1999.98-1696,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1726.202,1727.385,Which seems to me fair enough.
1999.98-1696,1,33977,kevin_m_schad,,1739.276,1739.776,--Yes.
1999.98-1696,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1746.946,1747.946,"Oh, but it says that."
1999.98-1696,1,33977,kevin_m_schad,,1748.346,1748.982,--Yes.
1999.98-1696,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1748.982,1760.94,"No prisoners shall be released... it seems to me what they're telling the prison official is, if he doesn't agree to pay, to pay the fine he owes, convert his supervised release time into additional imprisonment time."
1999.98-1696,1,33977,kevin_m_schad,,1760.94,1774.597,"And in effect what you would have under that circumstance is, you would have a Bureau of Prison official making the decision as to, incarcerate the defendant for a longer period of time without any hearing, without any due process."
1999.98-1696,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1778.715,1784.619,Perfectly consistent with the process set out in the sentence.
1999.98-1696,1,33977,kevin_m_schad,,1793.309,1821.309,"Mr. Chief Justice, when a defendant is accused of violating the terms of his supervised release, once he is out he then has a hearing before the United States district judge and he can defend himself, he has the right to counsel, and only after a finding that he has in fact violated the terms of his supervised release can he then be reincarcerated, and it's up to the judge, the sentencing judge to not only find the term of... or find the revocation but also find the new term."
1999.98-1696,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1821.309,1840.89,"Well, very likely, if he felt that he had agreed to the installment schedule and the prison official was just being arbitrary and not releasing him, he would have an action for habeas corpus, the district court to tell him that he's no longer being properly incarcerated, but that doesn't go to whether Congress can exact that sort of a condition."
1999.98-1696,1,33977,kevin_m_schad,,1855.982,1866.19,"Mr. Chief Justice, I'm submitting that in fact no... Congress did not intend for the result that the plain language of the statute intends."
1999.98-1696,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1868.89,1876.229,"What's the best talisman, or index for deciding what the intent of Congress was?"
1999.98-1696,1,33977,kevin_m_schad,,1879.498,1893.09,"--Yes, Your Honor, you have... but in order to look at the Congress' intent, you not only have to look at the exact... or the language that we're speaking of, but you have to look at the overall structure of the statute and the related statutes that are imposed at the same time."
1999.98-1696,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1893.09,1902.696,"Why is this inconsistent with the other provisions, the provision... the last sentence, that you say they couldn't possibly have meant literally?"
1999.98-1696,1,33977,kevin_m_schad,,1902.696,1915.086,"Well, because in any other circumstance the defendant in violation of a supervised release term is entitled to the full due process rights."
1999.98-1696,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1930.696,1935.064,I don't understand what the alternative that you think Congress had in mind is.
1999.98-1696,1,33977,kevin_m_schad,,1935.064,1935.648,Well--
1999.98-1696,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1935.648,1947.389,"If Congress didn't want them to keep the guy until he signs the agreement, which they say he must sign, what was... what is... what are you supposed to do, torture him until he coughs up the agreement?"
1999.98-1696,1,33977,kevin_m_schad,,1948.289,1949.641,"--No, Justice Scalia."
1999.98-1696,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1949.641,1951.208,--What is your alternative?
1999.98-1696,1,33977,kevin_m_schad,,1953.26,1953.81,I would submit that--
1999.98-1696,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1953.81,1956.161,"The guy says, heck no, I won't sign."
1999.98-1696,1,33977,kevin_m_schad,,1956.161,1963.25,"--I would submit that any Bureau of Prisons official is, even if they do not sign is going to release them and then probably--"
1999.98-1696,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1963.25,1968.369,"In violation of the law, which says no prisoner shall be released unless he agrees to adhere to, and he hasn't agreed to."
1999.98-1696,1,33977,kevin_m_schad,,1968.369,1969.487,--Yes.
1999.98-1696,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1971.054,1975.808,And that's your... that in your mind gives a more reasonable interpretation of this statute?
1999.98-1696,1,33977,kevin_m_schad,,1975.808,1976.975,--Yes.
1999.98-1696,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1978.477,1990.318,"Are you helped by the second-to-last sentence, in your view, which does conceive of the proposition that there can be concurrent running--"
1999.98-1696,1,33977,kevin_m_schad,,1990.318,1990.751,--Well--
1999.98-1696,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1990.751,1998.59,"--and you would say this is not in connection with a conviction, so that sentence is inapplicable?"
1999.98-1696,1,33977,kevin_m_schad,,1998.59,1999.64,"--Yes, Justice Kennedy."
1999.98-1696,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2010.564,2024.806,"And you say the statute itself acknowledges that possibility in the 30-day context when it is in connection with a conviction, and you would have to say this is not in connection with a conviction."
1999.98-1696,1,33977,kevin_m_schad,,2024.806,2025.924,--That's correct.
1999.98-1696,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2025.924,2026.824,The excess time.
1999.98-1696,1,33977,kevin_m_schad,,2026.824,2068.485,"That's correct, and with regards... one item that we haven't looked at is the... how 18 U.S.C. section 3742 plays out, and how in the case where a defendant is... where we're not looking at a retroactive application of Bailey, but we're looking at a guideline sentence that was imposed erroneously, if a defendant receives a term of, let's say, 3 years imprisonment and a 1-year term of supervised release, then if he... if that defendant does not get through the appellate process by the time the 3 years imprisonment have occurred, then the case is mooted and the defendant in that case is not entitled to any relief."
1999.98-1696,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2068.485,2069.437,Why is that so?
1999.98-1696,1,33977,kevin_m_schad,,2076.774,2082.327,"Well, the question would be whether or not in that case there is enough to obtain jurisdiction."
1999.98-1696,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2170.135,2180.591,"As far as the guidelines are concerned, wasn't there a change made in response to whatever was the court of appeals decision to say that you can't go back any further than time served?"
1999.98-1696,1,33977,kevin_m_schad,,2180.591,2182.357,"Yes, Justice Ginsburg."
1999.98-1696,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2200.903,2201.403,Why not?
1999.98-1696,1,33977,kevin_m_schad,,2210.592,2219.365,"That would be the case if, in fact, that particular guideline was made retroactive, which it was not under 1B1.10."
1999.98-1696,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2219.365,2241.861,"Mr. Schad, would the apparent unfairness of this thing... at least I consider it apparently unfair... be remedied if we held that it would be an abuse of discretion for a judge not to exercise his option to remit the supervised release time?"
1999.98-1696,1,33977,kevin_m_schad,,2241.861,2244.063,Justice Scalia--
1999.98-1696,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2244.063,2248.282,"I mean, it is within his discretion, but couldn't we say it would be an abuse in these circumstances not to--"
1999.98-1696,1,33977,kevin_m_schad,,2248.282,2256.371,"--Is Justice Scalia referring to the 3583, the credit after the 1-year term of... the early termination provision?"
1999.98-1696,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2256.371,2257.054,--Right.
1999.98-1696,1,33977,kevin_m_schad,,2257.054,2259.49,"Well, the problem with that, Justice Scalia, is that--"
1999.98-1696,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2259.49,2260.942,You still get 1 year.
1999.98-1696,1,33977,kevin_m_schad,,2260.942,2261.625,--first you have to serve a year.
1999.98-1696,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2261.625,2262.375,You still get 1 year.
1999.98-1696,1,33977,kevin_m_schad,,2262.375,2263.993,Before you can even ask.
1999.98-1696,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2275.201,2276.534,"Before he could even ask, right."
1999.98-1696,1,33977,kevin_m_schad,,2276.534,2291.227,"--And then we still have the problem with the judge's discretion, and even if it's under abuse of discretion standard, by the time a particular defendant could get it up to the court of appeals, then we... he would more than likely serve a lot of his term anyway."
1999.98-1696,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2291.227,2300.833,"Well, on the other hand, if the Government... if the judge wrongfully allows him, the Government would have a long time to get it up to the court of appeals, so that works both ways."
1999.98-1696,1,33977,kevin_m_schad,,2300.833,2303.119,"That's correct, Mr. Chief Justice."
1999.98-1696,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2305.986,2307.17,"Thank you, Mr. Schad."
1999.98-1696,2,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,2325.8,2328.084,"Yes, it was."
1999.98-1696,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2328.084,2335.156,"Ms. McDowell, how do you... how would the Government construe this situation, which came up in one of the hypotheticals:"
1999.98-1696,2,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,2372.929,2375.464,I don't believe that the situation has ever come up.
1999.98-1696,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2381.101,2381.501,Yes.
1999.98-1696,2,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,2394.278,2404.233,"--He might well, Your Honor, because under the wording of the statute his term of supervised release would have commenced upon his first release from prison."
1999.98-1696,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2412.572,2413.539,"Well, that serves the--"
1999.98-1696,2,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,2413.539,2416.041,--so I think it's possible it would be construed that way to give him credit.
1999.98-1696,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2416.041,2444.96,"--That serves the literal terms of the statute, which is your argument, but it does sort of undercut the theory that we need to be literal about the terms of the statute, because the prisoner in effect is in need of this supervision for whatever period of time is prescribed, and so it would seem that the literal interpretation and the rationale for being literal seem to be at odds with each other in that situation."
1999.98-1696,2,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,2444.96,2460.72,"Well, the district court would still have the opportunity, if it appeared necessary to extend the defendant's term of supervised release, if it appeared necessary to serve the deterrence and rehabilitation purposes beyond the term that was initially imposed, unless it was already--"
1999.98-1696,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2460.72,2461.553,And hence would--
1999.98-1696,2,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,2461.553,2462.255,--to a maximum.
1999.98-1696,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2462.255,2468.659,"--Would likewise, then, have discretion I presume, on your theory, not to give any credit at all."
1999.98-1696,2,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,2468.659,2472.445,Effectively not to do that by lengthening a term of supervised release.
1999.98-1696,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2488.137,2497.678,"Basically I guess your argument is, no system is perfect, but we're going to get closer to what Congress intended if we just be literal about this."
1999.98-1696,2,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,2499.595,2500.714,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1999.98-1696,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2500.714,2504.582,"Of course, your answer really doesn't make everything work out okay."
1999.98-1696,2,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,2519.859,2520.326,That's correct.
1999.98-1696,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2520.326,2527.464,"So suppose he has 2 years parole on a State conviction he has to serve after he's done his Federal sentence, okay."
1999.98-1696,2,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,2543.291,2543.924,Right.
1999.98-1696,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2543.924,2544.624,Okay.
1999.98-1696,2,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,2556.884,2558.117,That would be a matter of State law.
