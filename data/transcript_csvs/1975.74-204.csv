1975.74-204,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,66.958,"We will hear arguments next in 74-204, Mathews against Eldridge."
1975.74-204,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,69.921,72.812,Thank you Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1975.74-204,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,174.132,183.491,"I am asking you to make statements against interest, but will you sometime tell us why the basis for your original conclusion?"
1975.74-204,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,183.491,203.291,"Well, the basis for the original conclusion was not my own conclusion Mr. Justice Stewart, but I believe it was that the constitutional issue might be final here."
1975.74-204,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,204.696,208.561,You are attacking the validity of the very process under which it could proceed?
1975.74-204,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,208.561,212.151,I think that was the reasoning.
1975.74-204,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,212.151,219.686,"But that is the issue, it is whether or not the very process, the administrative process is a valid constitution matter --"
1975.74-204,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,219.686,220.947,That is correct.
1975.74-204,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,233.782,234.654,Now be given time?
1975.74-204,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,234.654,240.172,That is correct Mr. Justice Stewart to file a brief in response.
1975.74-204,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,511.755,515.029,You mean expensive not only in terms of money?
1975.74-204,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,515.029,522.354,I mean expensive in terms of money expended in terms of time and indeed I think in this case --
1975.74-204,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,522.354,524.279,And efficiency?
1975.74-204,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,524.279,550.897,"Yes, and I supposed it is socially expensive because I think in this case for example if one were required to continue payments until an oral evidentiary hearing could be had, one would pay a lot of money to beneficiaries who claim the hearing only for the purpose of keeping the payments going and I think that imposes a social cost independent of money upon the erosion of individual character."
1975.74-204,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,572.169,577.389,"I have a question Solicitor General, was this issue before us, we did not reach it or something in similar --?"
1975.74-204,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,577.389,586.334,"Yes, in Richards against Wright, I believe Mr. Justice Brennan, although these are the procedures that have just been instituted prior to oral argument in Richards against Wright."
1975.74-204,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,586.334,590.434,We sent the case back for reconsideration in light of new procedures?
1975.74-204,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,590.434,590.962,That is correct.
1975.74-204,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,600.983,602.763,And these are those new procedures?
1975.74-204,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,602.763,606.786,These are the new procedures Mr. Justice Stewart.
1975.74-204,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,917.443,925.58,"Mr. Solicitor General, you referred to the right of the worker to examine the file."
1975.74-204,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,934.255,935.499,That is correct Mr. Justice Powell.
1975.74-204,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,935.991,938.556,What is the reason for that distinction?
1975.74-204,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,938.556,944.673,"Well, it is a distinction in medical practice."
1975.74-204,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,980.45,983.721,Is this distinction in the regulation?
1975.74-204,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,983.721,989.979,"I believe it is Mr. Justice Powell, but I cannot look at -- I believe it is in the regulation."
1975.74-204,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,989.979,997.641,And this means that a claimant who does not have counsel does not have access to that medical information?
1975.74-204,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,997.641,1006.8,"Well, Mr. Justice Powell a claimant who cannot get anybody to represent him, that is it could be a relative, it could be a union representative, it could be any representative he chooses."
1975.74-204,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1006.8,1007.998,His wife?
1975.74-204,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1007.998,1008.754,Yes sir.
1975.74-204,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1012.983,1027.057,"Mr. Solicitor General, does this not cut across rather fundamental proposition that the lawyer may not perceive information on terms that it cannot be transmitted to its client?"
1975.74-204,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1027.057,1029.954,"Well, I have operated under protective orders."
1975.74-204,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1033.835,1038.78,"Protective orders, are you equating the regulation to a protective order?"
1975.74-204,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1038.78,1056.244,"It is in the sense Mr. Chief Justice that I think under current medical practice, the agency would have some difficulty perhaps getting medical reports if doctors prefer or insist upon limiting access to their medical files."
1975.74-204,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1078.004,1096.228,"(Inaudible) He can present whatever evidence he wants I suppose, but he apparently is not entitled to have any witnesses against him appear personally?"
1975.74-204,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1096.228,1102.183,Although regulation says I believe that he is entitled to subpoena and examination.
1975.74-204,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1102.183,1106.114,But the government need not put its case on --
1975.74-204,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1106.114,1108.026,The government puts on no case at the --
1975.74-204,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1108.026,1110.677,They just -- they got the file and that is it?
1975.74-204,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1110.677,1115.387,"The file goes in and the administrative law judge is there, but the government is not --"
1975.74-204,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1115.387,1119.608,May the claimants subpoena the doctors and cross-examine them?
1975.74-204,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1119.608,1121.691,"As I understand it, he may."
1975.74-204,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1133.345,1137.506,And he can call them for cross-examination or what --?
1975.74-204,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1137.506,1138.566,That is what I understood.
1975.74-204,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1146.03,1153.589,Do you think that the validity of the procedures at that hearing are at stake here?
1975.74-204,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1153.589,1156.803,"No, they are not Mr. Chief Justice -- Mr. Justice White because they are --"
1975.74-204,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1156.803,1161.272,I thought it was just where there needed to be a pre-hearing a prior --?
1975.74-204,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1161.272,1170.809,The only question here is whether there should be an oral evidentiary hearing prior to termination and the post-termination hearing that was given in this case is not challenged.
1975.74-204,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1170.809,1172.46,"Well, it is not an issue here?"
1975.74-204,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1172.46,1175.656,"No, it is not."
1975.74-204,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1175.656,1183.972,Except as it may bear on whether it is any kind of a reliable substitute for a pre-hearing or prior hearing?
1975.74-204,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1183.972,1193.507,"Well, it results as respondent’s counsel will tell you at a very high rate of reversal of those cases taken to it."
1975.74-204,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1205.472,1209.856,I thought this respondent did not have a post-termination hearing?
1975.74-204,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1209.856,1210.257,He did not.
1975.74-204,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1706.441,1714.556,"Does the secretary made any studies in terms of manpower? You have given us a dollar figure, but --"
1975.74-204,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1714.556,1723.327,Our brief contains an appendix which estimates what would have to be done in terms of manpower.
1975.74-204,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1756.475,1765.329,"Mr. Solicitor General, supposed the administrative remedies are completely exhausted then I suppose at some point there is judicial review?"
1975.74-204,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1765.329,1769.467,After that the judicial review which is the first review which is not de novo.
1975.74-204,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1769.467,1770.962,But now that is on the record?
1975.74-204,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1770.962,1771.891,That is on the record.
1975.74-204,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1771.891,1788.041,So that it is true that -- it is true that -- you think however that if he wants to he can have a -- he can test out the strength of the government’s case through live witnesses?
1975.74-204,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1788.041,1791.646,"Yes, I believe I do Mr. Justice White and if I am --"
1975.74-204,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1791.646,1794.087,"Well, let as assume he could not, assume he could not?"
1975.74-204,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1794.087,1795.435,You mean at the --
1975.74-204,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1795.435,1797.045,"Oral hearing, yes."
1975.74-204,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1797.045,1798.124,The administrative oral hearing?
1975.74-204,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1798.124,1820.978,"Yes, the administrative oral hearing and whatever record is to be made is made there and now let us just assume he cannot test up the government’s case by confrontation of the government’s witnesses or the sources of the government’s information, assume he cannot do that, neither can he do it in any later time."
1975.74-204,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1825.23,1827.508,The Court is limited by the substantial evidence rule.
1975.74-204,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1827.508,1829.807,I see.
1975.74-204,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1829.807,1840.068,"But I think in no previous due process case that I know of has there been this kind of a ratio of cost benefit, in fact this kind of a disaster’s ratio of cost benefit."
1975.74-204,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1840.068,1848.602,That argument -- that argument is (Inaudible)
1975.74-204,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1848.602,1855.903,"That is correct, but I am only asking that there not be a pre-termination here Mr. Justice White."
1975.74-204,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1873.155,1876.575,Thank you Mr. Solicitor General.
1975.74-204,1,20808,donald_e_earls,,1883.338,1888.478,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1975.74-204,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1904.377,1911.381,"May I ask that while you address the jurisdictional question that the Solicitor General raised in oral argument, are you –-"
1975.74-204,1,20808,donald_e_earls,,1911.381,1915.713,"Mr. Justice Brennan I can, I am familiar with the Salfi case, I have rated."
1975.74-204,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1919.517,1924.331,But there will be question to it if you want time to address them in the brief.
1975.74-204,1,20808,donald_e_earls,,1924.331,1925.931,We feel as far as jurisdiction --
1975.74-204,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1925.931,1927.068,(Inaudible) file independently.
1975.74-204,1,20808,donald_e_earls,,1927.068,1928.898,Yes sir.
1975.74-204,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1980.223,1995.46,Salfi as I recall said that actions brought for benefits under the Social Security Act arrive could only be brought under that particular jurisdictional section.
1975.74-204,1,20808,donald_e_earls,,1995.46,2003.575,"Mt. Justice Rehnquist, this is not, the District Judge in his first sentence points out that this is not a case for benefits."
1975.74-204,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2010.905,2017.522,"But this man would never be in Court if you were not asserting some claim to a benefit under the Social Security Act, would he?"
1975.74-204,1,20808,donald_e_earls,,2017.522,2022.714,"Your Honor, could you repeat the question please?"
1975.74-204,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2022.714,2030.212,This man would not be in Court if you were not asserting some claim to a benefit under Social Security Act?
1975.74-204,1,20808,donald_e_earls,,2030.212,2034.834,"Mr. Justice Rehnquist, we had -- Mr. George Eldridge had benefits under the Social Security."
1975.74-204,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2034.834,2038.139,"Okay, did you get my question?"
1975.74-204,1,20808,donald_e_earls,,2038.139,2041.234,"He is claiming benefits under the Social Security Act, yes sir."
1975.74-204,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2041.234,2052.063,"Yes and the statute that we construed in Salfi said that if you were claiming benefits under the Social Security Act, you bring your action under 205 (g) and not otherwise, does it not?"
1975.74-204,1,20808,donald_e_earls,,2052.063,2054.498,"Mr. Justice Rehnquist, that is what Salfi hailed."
