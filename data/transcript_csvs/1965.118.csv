1965.118,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,0.0,9.897,"Well, this seems to be a rather specific statement to do that which you say you wouldn't object to this."
1965.118,0,39900,robert_h_mcroberts,,35.601,36.238,We're not clear --
1965.118,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,36.238,37.486,Is that's what you're objecting?
1965.118,0,39900,robert_h_mcroberts,,37.486,57.589,"We're not clear Mr. Justice whether that will be construed as Mr. Justice White suggests only as prohibiting us from entering into an agreement not to carry conflicting line but permitting us to say to our dealers, “If you will carry an adequate and a representative stock of our shoes."
1965.118,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,60.796,65.825,"Probably the words or effect were not there, just the word of having a purpose."
1965.118,0,39900,robert_h_mcroberts,,65.825,68.645,That is a -- that is a troublesome thing.
1965.118,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,68.645,74.263,"Well, if the -- but [Inaudible] and effect both, you wouldn't have any trouble, is that it?"
1965.118,0,39900,robert_h_mcroberts,,74.263,80.594,"And understanding, is there an implied understanding there that we are not acquainted with."
1965.118,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,80.594,97.49,"Well, if -- if you're afraid that if the customer's agreement to carry a full line economically precludes this comparing his [Inaudible] inventory, he would violate the order?"
1965.118,0,39900,robert_h_mcroberts,,97.49,98.488,That is our concern.
1965.118,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,100.508,105.466,"But upheld really, if the fellow, an ordinary dealer if he really has a full line necessary in the other line?"
1965.118,0,39900,robert_h_mcroberts,,105.466,108.155,"It is a practical matter you cannot do it, a small store."
1965.118,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,115.1,120.951,But I don't find that this is or to really to focus on this issue at all.
1965.118,0,39900,robert_h_mcroberts,,132.107,134.048,Focuses on this question?
1965.118,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,134.048,145.161,Whether or not that absolute agreement not to carry somebody else's lines that the mere undertaking to carry a full line would nevertheless violate these all.
1965.118,0,39900,robert_h_mcroberts,,145.161,156.897,"That is not said Your Honor, but it does say that where the effect of it is to protrude in from independently determining whether they'll be shoes would be purchased from the competitor."
1965.118,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,185.15,196.435,"Oh, I hope that it will -- this just proves that -- this just proves that the -- what are you worried about that because carrying a whole line won't keep them from dealing with every other."
1965.118,0,39900,robert_h_mcroberts,,196.435,203.388,"It keeps them from carrying a conflicting line as a practical matter, practical economic matter."
1965.118,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,203.388,257.062,"Well, a real difference maybe I suggest to you whether you have a -- whether the Federal Trade Commission is going to acknowledge or admit that Brown Shoe Company can buy agreement or commission or otherwise imposed upon a retailer the decision as to who's shoes he is going to carry and as I read this Federal Trade Commission says the Brown Shoe Company, you cannot directly or indirectly impose upon -- you cannot directly or indirectly deprive a retailer of the right to exercise as independent judgment as to what shoes he's going to carry and you disagree with that?"
1965.118,0,39900,robert_h_mcroberts,,257.062,257.762,No.
1965.118,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,267.399,270.77,"Well, he thinks that's only the thing with their judgments."
1965.118,0,39900,robert_h_mcroberts,,275.224,293.765,"They -- they feel that if you offer services here which they're admittedly needed and they want them, they free to lay the plan in any way it's an inducement, but they're offering this extra aids and extra benefits and what --"
1965.118,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,293.765,306.662,"And what you're doing whether or not it's a violation of (2) (d) or (2) (e) of the Robinson Patman Act, it is in there for a valuable consideration namely the offer of these services."
1965.118,0,39900,robert_h_mcroberts,,347.436,348.544,I think that is correct.
1965.118,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,420.566,425.833,Are you telling us that the complainant one time decided the violation of Section 3?
1965.118,0,39900,robert_h_mcroberts,,425.833,427.852,"Section 3 was not used, Your Honor."
1965.118,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,427.852,429.849,Section 3 was never recited on this complaint (Voice Overlap) --
1965.118,0,39900,robert_h_mcroberts,,429.849,431.511,It was not mentioned by then.
1965.118,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,431.511,434.805,Is that you're saying the complain under Section 5 was (Voice Overlap) --
1965.118,0,39900,robert_h_mcroberts,,434.805,441.989,Complained under Section 5 charging exclusive dealing and substantial effect.
1965.118,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,764.175,770.506,"I have not understood exactly the services that you're talking about, what is that?"
1965.118,0,39900,robert_h_mcroberts,,770.506,779.762,"Mr. Justice, the record shows and the Court of Appeals found that most of these benefits and services which have been mentioned --"
1965.118,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,779.762,780.451,But what are they?
1965.118,0,39900,robert_h_mcroberts,,781.506,783.811,"Oh, architectural services and --"
1965.118,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,783.811,785.14,Architectural --
1965.118,0,39900,robert_h_mcroberts,,785.14,785.974,Architectural sir.
1965.118,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,792.656,793.713,Help them display.
1965.118,0,39900,robert_h_mcroberts,,793.713,797.242,Help them -- help them to display.
1965.118,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,807.656,814.449,"And if you argue it I gathered it was at the moment ago, I'm -- I haven't talk to you before, but is this your argument?"
1965.118,0,39900,robert_h_mcroberts,,825.102,826.015,As long as they keep them waiting --
1965.118,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,826.015,829.895,And that's -- not -- that does not value it.
1965.118,0,39900,robert_h_mcroberts,,829.895,837.291,"That is -- that is correct Your Honor, if you please, unless there are anti competitive effects of that Act."
1965.118,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,841.291,843.654,Unless they add a competitive effect?
1965.118,0,39900,robert_h_mcroberts,,843.654,843.912,Unless --
1965.118,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,843.912,847.171,Or that -- why wouldn't it be an added competitive effect --
1965.118,0,39900,robert_h_mcroberts,,847.171,847.446,Unless --
1965.118,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,847.446,852.648,-- if it was an agreement within that they wouldn't buy -- handle anybody else's shoes?
1965.118,0,39900,robert_h_mcroberts,,852.648,861.578,"Well, I think it is agreed that an exclusive dealing agreement or a requirements agreement is not illegal per se."
1965.118,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,861.578,865.347,I wasn't talking about illegal per se here (Voice Overlap) I was talking about anti competitive?
1965.118,0,39900,robert_h_mcroberts,,865.347,871.348,"Well, if it has the requisite effects to substantially lessen competition."
1965.118,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,871.348,888.075,"Well, that's a different thing as to how much -- how much you lessen but as I understand if you're saying -- if it's not anti competitive to make an agreement to the different stores and places, no by the deal handle -- nobody is good but yours."
1965.118,0,39900,robert_h_mcroberts,,888.075,889.524,Not per se.
1965.118,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,889.524,889.898,What?
1965.118,0,39900,robert_h_mcroberts,,889.898,891.319,Not illegal per se.
1965.118,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,891.319,897.42,"Illegal, I understand that but are you saying it's not anti competitive?"
1965.118,0,39900,robert_h_mcroberts,,897.42,898.975,"No, I don't think I am saying that."
1965.118,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,904.887,906.012,A substantial effects.
1965.118,0,39900,robert_h_mcroberts,,906.012,907.544,Substantial effects upon competition --
1965.118,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,907.544,908.736,I understand.
1965.118,0,39900,robert_h_mcroberts,,908.736,917.679,"And it was the Commission who sought to avoid the necessity of finding that said, they're akin to a Tie-In Clause where you don't have to find --"
1965.118,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,917.679,923.164,When they seem few related [Inaudible] if only by consanguinity?
1965.118,0,39900,robert_h_mcroberts,,923.164,927.668,I think the consanguinity is so remote that it is not.
1965.118,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,996.482,1002.059,Or that instead of giving you advise of the counsel which is worth the money.
1965.118,0,39900,robert_h_mcroberts,,1003.53,1004.902,"Yes, very valuable advice --"
1965.118,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1004.902,1009.735,"They had simply said, we'll give you so much money if you would simply agree to carry our goods."
1965.118,0,39900,robert_h_mcroberts,,1009.735,1022.44,And I think then we would have the effect of the quantity discount and if it could be justified that it's perfectly legal to give as long as it is not offered discriminatory and there's no evidence of that here.
1965.118,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1022.44,1024.827,What about (2) (d)?
1965.118,0,39900,robert_h_mcroberts,,1024.827,1029.228,"I don't think that one Your Honor, (2) (d) never came into this case."
1965.118,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1029.228,1031.659,"Well, suppose it comes in now?"
1965.118,0,39900,robert_h_mcroberts,,1031.659,1040.041,"Two, there is no evidence that these services were ever denied to a single dealer."
1965.118,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1040.041,1049.104,"Well, the word -- the word “deal” is that we would not -- Brown Shoe sold the shoes to dealers who are not in the franchise plan, is that right?"
1965.118,0,39900,robert_h_mcroberts,,1049.104,1049.998,That's correct.
1965.118,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1049.998,1056.041,And those -- some of those dealers were in competition with dealers who where in the franchise plan.
1965.118,0,39900,robert_h_mcroberts,,1066.551,1074.211,I think that (2) (d) has to make -- the service have to make whatever you're offering available to the -- you don't have to get them to accept.
1965.118,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1074.211,1074.513,That's right.
1965.118,0,39900,robert_h_mcroberts,,1074.513,1077.463,"Now, we're trying to get these people to go on the plan."
1965.118,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1077.463,1096.43,"The facts here indicate that these services were available only to persons who would enter into an agreement or understanding that they would not buy from other manufacturers' lines that conflicted with the lands of Brown Shoe Company, is that right?"
1965.118,0,39900,robert_h_mcroberts,,1096.43,1097.615,That's correct.
1965.118,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1097.615,1102.698,"And you say that so long as they offer that to anybody, to everybody --"
1965.118,0,39900,robert_h_mcroberts,,1102.698,1105.479,Everybody who could qualify on --
1965.118,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1105.479,1107.871,-- now how do you qualify?
1965.118,0,39900,robert_h_mcroberts,,1107.871,1121.104,They are required under these programs as you see it or operate -- to have adequate capital to operate a modern and up to date store to follow the accounting plans and make the reports.
1965.118,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1123.127,1123.538,And so much --
1965.118,0,39900,robert_h_mcroberts,,1123.538,1125.85,And we're trying to get them to go on the plan.
1965.118,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1125.85,1133.26,"Somebody said the Brown Shoe, “I want to buy this air steep line from them but I don't want your services."
1965.118,0,39900,robert_h_mcroberts,,1144.093,1148.434,"No evidence to that but I'm sure that if that had been asked, the answer would have been no."
1965.118,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1148.434,1149.359,It would have been no.
1965.118,0,39900,robert_h_mcroberts,,1149.359,1150.198,That's correct Your Honor.
1965.118,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1150.198,1175.429,"Now, as I understand the law if they -- to -- if an allowance of service is offered to some customers and there are other customers who are not equipped for one reason or another to receive that same service and the equivalence has to be offered to them, its your understanding?"
1965.118,0,39900,robert_h_mcroberts,,1175.429,1181.128,My understanding is that it has to be offered to everyone on the same classification or everyone on the same rule.
1965.118,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1184.574,1188.465,"Yes, but you have to classify them so that there is a practicality --"
1965.118,0,39900,robert_h_mcroberts,,1188.465,1194.093,"So there is some practicality there, you can't do it in a discriminatory way."
1965.118,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1194.093,1211.962,"How about the 50,000 outlets that Mr. Spritzer mentioned, the smaller ones and ones that perhaps don't carry a full line with due carrier shoes, is this -- is this available to them?"
1965.118,0,39900,robert_h_mcroberts,,1211.962,1223.654,"It is not available to anyone who -- basically this is offered to the family shoe stores, to the people who carry the three lines of shoes, men's, women and children."
1965.118,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1260.708,1266.718,"But then your figure at 1% is rather low, isn't it?"
1965.118,0,39900,robert_h_mcroberts,,1266.718,1275.476,"It is -- the figure of 1% is simply an entire shoe outlets and we're simply measuring, these are not open (Voice Overlap)"
1965.118,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1275.476,1277.562,But your -- your program isn't open to --
1965.118,0,39900,robert_h_mcroberts,,1277.562,1280.578,The program is not -- the program is not open.
1965.118,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1312.834,1313.571,But is it fair --
1965.118,0,39900,robert_h_mcroberts,,1313.571,1318.643,But you're simply using the number stores as a possible yardstick to measure that.
1965.118,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1318.643,1335.621,Is it fair to say that you just cut the white meat out of the shoe industry and deal with that so far as the -- these contracts are concerned?
1965.118,0,39900,robert_h_mcroberts,,1335.621,1356.677,"Well, I don't know that I would characterize it just that way, but we do only offer it and I think you find that statement made in our brochure that it's offered only to the aggressive modern up-to-date progressive dealer who wants to move ahead and something to that effect in finding."
1965.118,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1356.677,1363.001,Did you say you could offer a discount to those who agree to carry full line?
1965.118,0,39900,robert_h_mcroberts,,1363.001,1371.951,In lieu of the -- that I don't believe I hope to answer Your Honor --
1965.118,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1371.951,1375.334,Because these services can be bought I suppose so.
1965.118,0,39900,robert_h_mcroberts,,1375.334,1381.438,"Well, the Commission is suggesting, but why don't you just charge the people."
1965.118,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1399.804,1400.146,"Well, the Commission --"
1965.118,0,39900,robert_h_mcroberts,,1400.146,1403.387,And the dealers would not pay a dime for those services.
1965.118,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1403.387,1412.191,"Now, the Commission suggested if the dealers who enjoyed your plan at a higher profit margin than the others, there could be many reasons for that I suppose but --"
1965.118,0,39900,robert_h_mcroberts,,1412.191,1413.336,"We like to -- we like to, that --"
1965.118,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1413.336,1416.343,That the Commission seemed to indicate that this was one of them.
1965.118,0,39900,robert_h_mcroberts,,1431.552,1443.751,I think it was Mr. Justice Fortas who asked whether or not these dealers were able to sell their shoes at a cheaper price because of this and there's nothing of that sort of the record.
1965.118,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1443.751,1445.326,"Oh, but they're making -- but they're -- but the --"
1965.118,0,39900,robert_h_mcroberts,,1445.326,1445.878,What they're doing before --
1965.118,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1445.878,1450.329,They get the services that otherwise they might have to pay for it.
1965.118,0,39900,robert_h_mcroberts,,1450.329,1456.129,I don't know that those services were available or paid anytime of any place.
1965.118,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1462.273,1463.524,They are valuable services.
1965.118,0,39900,robert_h_mcroberts,,1463.524,1466.342,No question about it Your Honor.
1965.118,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1466.867,1471.696,"Now, I feel it has nothing to do with the case but I'm just asking out of curiosity."
1965.118,0,39900,robert_h_mcroberts,,1481.519,1482.158,No.
1965.118,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1491.806,1492.813,I am not talking about the program I am talking about the store.
1965.118,0,39900,robert_h_mcroberts,,1492.813,1492.884,No.
1965.118,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1492.884,1494.108,[Inaudible]
1965.118,0,39900,robert_h_mcroberts,,1494.108,1496.491,"No, that's a different (Voice Overlap) this is a different Brown."
