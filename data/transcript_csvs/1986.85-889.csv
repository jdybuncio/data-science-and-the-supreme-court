1986.85-889,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,71.596,"You may proceed now whenever you're ready, Mr. Haried."
1986.85-889,0,30836,john_m_haried,,71.596,76.314,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1986.85-889,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,113.856,117.725,"Mr. Haried, may I ask you a preliminary question."
1986.85-889,0,30836,john_m_haried,,127.349,130.967,We did not urge that on the interlocutory appeal to the Colorado Supreme Court.
1986.85-889,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,130.967,133.27,Why not?
1986.85-889,0,30836,john_m_haried,,134.97,140.324,"Yes, I do think it would have been, if it had been done at the time of Mr. Bertine's arrest."
1986.85-889,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,150.446,158.683,"Well, wasn't there a case from Arizona that dealt with a delay, that recognized the concept of Belton, from this Court?"
1986.85-889,0,30836,john_m_haried,,158.683,160.552,I do not know if there was.
1986.85-889,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,162.254,167.456,I was just very curious to know why the state didn't pursue that.
1986.85-889,0,30836,john_m_haried,,167.456,180.882,"It was basically a decision of the facts of this case, that the intent and the whole thrust of the search was an inventory, and that's the grounds on which we sought to justify it."
1986.85-889,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,282.581,291.453,Were there procedures in place for when containers would be opened or whether they would or anything of that sort?
1986.85-889,0,30836,john_m_haried,,291.453,301.893,"The Boulder police department regulations provide that if a vehicle is impounded it shall be inventoried, and the trial court made a finding that that meant opening closed containers."
1986.85-889,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,301.893,309.999,"Is there anything in the record that tells us what the policy is, other than that general conclusion?"
1986.85-889,0,30836,john_m_haried,,315.135,316.152,There is a written policy.
1986.85-889,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,340.35,351.824,Was there any testimony by the officers in question here to the effect that they had a slightly different policy about whether to open containers or not?
1986.85-889,0,30836,john_m_haried,,358.413,363.365,"I think that the Boulder police department regulations don't spell out in detail the word ""inventory""."
1986.85-889,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,374.59,377.959,"Mr. Haried, what is the policy with regard to locked containers?"
1986.85-889,0,30836,john_m_haried,,377.959,378.911,It's the same policy.
1986.85-889,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,378.911,382.529,You break the lock in all cases and open the briefcase or whatever it might be?
1986.85-889,0,30836,john_m_haried,,382.529,384.179,That's correct.
1986.85-889,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,384.179,385.565,Does the record show that?
1986.85-889,0,30836,john_m_haried,,385.565,387.348,I don't believe that it does.
1986.85-889,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,490.212,497.533,How would that justification apply to a locked briefcase?
1986.85-889,0,30836,john_m_haried,,497.533,504.353,I'm going to start from the premise that locked briefcases... not all locked briefcases are totally secure.
1986.85-889,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,511.893,521.232,"Yes, but if the police officer noted on it it was a locked briefcase, presumably if it was picked later, why, there wouldn't be any... I don't understand."
1986.85-889,0,30836,john_m_haried,,521.232,523.933,"--Well, he'd have no way of showing that it was picked later."
1986.85-889,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,525.386,528.588,"But at the time he made the inventory, he inventoried it as a locked briefcase."
1986.85-889,0,30836,john_m_haried,,532.039,537.693,"--But he could still be unjustly accused of being the person who picked it, and he'd have no way of protecting against that."
1986.85-889,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,580.936,592.594,"What happens to all these materials after they're inventoried, assuming that it's a case like this where there's a truck that's going to be towed somewhere?"
1986.85-889,0,30836,john_m_haried,,592.594,593.361,The truck--
1986.85-889,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,593.361,598.832,"Do they bring everything that's inventoried to the station, only the valuable things to the station?"
1986.85-889,0,30836,john_m_haried,,598.832,601.016,--Only the valuable things or particularly dangerous things.
1986.85-889,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,659.969,668.657,"We'll resume there at 1:00 o'clock, Mr. Haried."
1986.85-889,0,30836,john_m_haried,,675.545,676.08,Thank you.
1986.85-889,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,788.17,791.02,"Where was the car put, the van put, afterwards?"
1986.85-889,0,30836,john_m_haried,,792.638,797.109,It was taken to a private storage and impound lot.
1986.85-889,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,797.109,798.459,Owned by the government?
1986.85-889,0,30836,john_m_haried,,798.459,799.892,No.
1986.85-889,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,799.892,801.328,Does the government have a lot?
1986.85-889,0,30836,john_m_haried,,801.328,803.346,No.
1986.85-889,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,803.346,805.346,"Well, where do they keep their police cars?"
1986.85-889,0,30836,john_m_haried,,805.346,808.648,They keep them under the building that houses the police department.
1986.85-889,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,809.584,812.119,"Well, couldn't they have put it down there?"
1986.85-889,0,30836,john_m_haried,,812.119,814.086,"Physically, they could have done it."
1986.85-889,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,820.023,822.908,"Well, could they have locked it?"
1986.85-889,0,30836,john_m_haried,,822.908,824.177,"They could have locked it, yes."
1986.85-889,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,824.177,826.962,Couldn't they have secured the pack?
1986.85-889,0,30836,john_m_haried,,826.962,829.162,They could have secured the pack.
1986.85-889,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,835.665,838.017,"Well, why did they open it?"
1986.85-889,0,30836,john_m_haried,,838.017,848.373,"They opened it because the police officer didn't know if there was anything particularly valuable that needed safekeeping or anything particularly dangerous that also needed safekeeping, because from the outside of the pack there was no way of knowing."
1986.85-889,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,848.373,850.741,"Well, what was worrying them about something dangerous?"
1986.85-889,0,30836,john_m_haried,,850.741,851.641,What do I mean?
1986.85-889,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,851.641,852.041,Yes.
1986.85-889,0,30836,john_m_haried,,853.693,856.495,"Well, for example, if there were a loaded gun inside the pack--"
1986.85-889,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,856.495,858.681,"Well, the man couldn't get to it, could he?"
1986.85-889,0,30836,john_m_haried,,858.681,859.431,"--No, he could not."
1986.85-889,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,859.431,861.633,What danger would it be?
1986.85-889,0,30836,john_m_haried,,861.633,873.339,"The danger would have been, if by some accidental means, for example, a loaded gun were triggered to go off as the police officer is handling it or throwing it into his police car or giving it to the property custodian or something like that."
1986.85-889,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,873.339,875.356,This was the pack I'm talking about.
1986.85-889,0,30836,john_m_haried,,875.356,876.392,"That's correct, it was a backpack."
1986.85-889,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,876.392,880.927,"You could have put it in a garment bag and that would have been it, wouldn't it?"
1986.85-889,0,30836,john_m_haried,,880.927,885.046,It would have been it in terms of holding it for safekeeping.
1986.85-889,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,886.198,889.533,I don't see why you had to open it up.
1986.85-889,0,30836,john_m_haried,,889.533,890.45,--That's correct.
1986.85-889,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,890.45,893.068,I don't understand why you had to open it up.
1986.85-889,0,30836,john_m_haried,,893.068,894.62,The reason is because--
1986.85-889,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,894.62,899.156,"Couldn't you just inventory it, one pack?"
1986.85-889,0,30836,john_m_haried,,899.156,912.232,"--That is... it could be done that way, but it would not serve the governmental interest because the police would have no way of establishing what it is they had initially taken custody of, and they would have no way of knowing how to store that item or how to handle it."
1986.85-889,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,912.232,918.302,How do we know that the search was for the purpose of inventory or the purpose of obtaining evidence?
1986.85-889,0,30836,john_m_haried,,918.302,920.671,How do we know that it was not for those purposes?
1986.85-889,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,920.671,922.204,How do I know the difference?
1986.85-889,0,30836,john_m_haried,,922.204,936.678,"Well, the trial court in this case made a factual finding that the search was not a pretext for an investigative search, that it was done in furtherance of the governmental caretaking interest."
1986.85-889,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,936.678,941.082,It was a finding.
1986.85-889,0,30836,john_m_haried,,944.95,949.621,"I agree, it involves a finding of law."
1986.85-889,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,949.621,957.025,"Mr. Haried, as I understand it the officer would have left the backpack in the truck if it didn't contain any valuables, right?"
1986.85-889,0,30836,john_m_haried,,957.025,958.477,That's right.
1986.85-889,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,958.477,961.762,"But he wouldn't want to leave it in the truck if it contained a loaded pistol, would he?"
1986.85-889,0,30836,john_m_haried,,961.762,963.195,That's correct.
1986.85-889,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,963.195,968.666,"Because somebody might come along and get it and obtain a loaded pistol, someone who shouldn't have a loaded pistol."
1986.85-889,0,30836,john_m_haried,,968.666,969.516,Absolutely.
1986.85-889,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,969.516,973.487,"So that's the reason he had to look at it, to decide whether to take it to the station or not?"
1986.85-889,0,30836,john_m_haried,,973.487,978.522,That's correct.
1986.85-889,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,978.522,982.759,Was it in a place where anybody could get in it?
1986.85-889,0,30836,john_m_haried,,982.759,986.644,"It was... the car was moved to an impound lot, which in this case--"
1986.85-889,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,986.644,987.996,Was it secure?
1986.85-889,0,30836,john_m_haried,,987.996,996.935,"--It was secure to the extent that a fence makes any area secure, but it's not totally immune from trespassers or vandals."
1986.85-889,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,996.935,1000.804,Is the police department safe from trespassers and vandals?
1986.85-889,0,30836,john_m_haried,,1005.708,1010.76,I would say that the property room where things are kept is about as safe a place as you can get.
1986.85-889,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1010.76,1013.712,"Well, couldn't you have put the pack in the property room?"
1986.85-889,0,30836,john_m_haried,,1013.712,1017.064,"You could, and this pack was eventually put there after it was inventoried."
1986.85-889,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1017.064,1019.499,It was put in after in was searched.
1986.85-889,0,30836,john_m_haried,,1019.499,1020.468,That is correct.
1986.85-889,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1020.468,1023.836,Did you need to search it to put it in the property room?
1986.85-889,0,30836,john_m_haried,,1023.836,1026.371,"We did not need to search it to put it into the property room, no."
1986.85-889,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1036.393,1037.46,"Very well, Mr. Haried."
1986.85-889,1,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,1044.083,1061.343,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1986.85-889,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1171.516,1175.151,"Mr. Lazarus, do you think the rationales apply equally to locked containers?"
1986.85-889,1,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,1175.151,1176.718,"--Yes, we do, Your Honor."
1986.85-889,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1187.259,1188.608,"Unlock them, break into them?"
1986.85-889,1,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,1188.608,1190.427,"--To break in, doing minimum damage."
1986.85-889,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1196.131,1202.618,"Well, supposing they had the equipment they have at airports, where they just run it through to see if there's a gun in there or anything like that."
1986.85-889,1,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,1205.837,1211.657,"Well, we think it would be a mistake to require that kind of case by case inquiry."
1986.85-889,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1219.477,1219.844,I understand.
1986.85-889,1,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,1224.815,1227.833,"Right, administrative convenience and the advantage of having routine procedures--"
1986.85-889,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1227.833,1228.233,Right.
1986.85-889,1,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,1228.233,1229.017,--opposed to trying--
1986.85-889,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1229.017,1230.618,Break into everything is the routine.
1986.85-889,1,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,1230.618,1252.365,"--Right, but the basic point is that the category of locked containers itself would involve such a wide variety of containers, many of which, like suitcases and briefcases, are so easily susceptible to being opened that it's reasonable for the police to have a procedure which takes away that discretion to try to decide which ones are easily openable and which ones are not and just say all locked containers should be open."
1986.85-889,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1252.365,1255.936,"It's to avoid the problem of deciding whether a container is locked or not, in other words?"
1986.85-889,1,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,1255.936,1259.471,"Well, whether it really is susceptible to being opened."
1986.85-889,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1259.471,1262.84,"Well, you also want to know what's in the suitcase, don't you?"
1986.85-889,1,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,1265.958,1268.994,"No, and if you don't open it up you cannot be sure in terms of--"
1986.85-889,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1268.994,1274.563,"You might be able to use a scanner that would tell you the shape of something or whether it's metal or not, but--"
1986.85-889,1,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,1274.563,1276.23,"--That's right, Your Honor."
1986.85-889,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1276.23,1279.717,--you wouldn't know what's in some bag.
1986.85-889,1,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,1279.717,1280.201,That's right.
1986.85-889,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1285.103,1289.923,"Now, here I understood there were packages of $700 and $200 found."
1986.85-889,1,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,1296.477,1305.25,"The facts of this case illustrate that quite well, how a container that was giving no outward indication that it might contain a valuable in fact did."
1986.85-889,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1535.0,1536.619,"Thank you, Mr. Lazarus."
1986.85-889,2,19486,cary_c_lacklen,,1540.737,1547.908,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1986.85-889,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1655.696,1664.468,"Well, what use is there in opening the backpack if all he can do when he opens the backpack is to note, there's a nylon bag in the backpack?"
1986.85-889,2,19486,cary_c_lacklen,,1684.965,1700.741,The Colorado Supreme Court found that the scope of the intrusion in this case was more than what was required by the governmental interest of protecting Mr. Bertine's property or protecting their claims against--
1986.85-889,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1700.741,1703.257,"I understand, but I'm asking why that's so?"
1986.85-889,2,19486,cary_c_lacklen,,1722.987,1729.058,"--Clearly, from the prosecution's point of view the police have to know what's in every small container."
1986.85-889,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1735.795,1736.83,I'm saying from anybody's point of view.
1986.85-889,2,19486,cary_c_lacklen,,1767.099,1773.253,"Well, I would argue that the scope of the inventory search has to be reasonable in and of itself."
1986.85-889,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1774.872,1775.522,"Well, what's your principle?"
1986.85-889,2,19486,cary_c_lacklen,,1779.807,1787.347,"--Clearly, the backpack could have been intruded upon to see if there were any weapons or dangerous instrumentalities."
1986.85-889,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1787.347,1789.882,But you can't tell if all you see in it is a nylon bag.
1986.85-889,2,19486,cary_c_lacklen,,1789.882,1791.065,I understand.
1986.85-889,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1811.024,1812.274,"It did contain valuables, though, didn't it?"
1986.85-889,2,19486,cary_c_lacklen,,1814.476,1826.534,"It did contain money and contraband, and if you take the prosecution's argument to its logical extension there is no container of whatever size in an inventory that the police cannot search."
1986.85-889,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1826.534,1828.967,Like a cigarette pack?
1986.85-889,2,19486,cary_c_lacklen,,1828.967,1830.252,That's correct.
1986.85-889,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1830.252,1834.72,"But we've upheld that in one of our cases, at a station house to be sure."
1986.85-889,2,19486,cary_c_lacklen,,1840.273,1847.594,"Clearly, the exigencies of the search of the cigarette pack in Lafayette were greater than in this case."
1986.85-889,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1858.919,1868.71,"The balance should be struck at a point where the government may have opened one container, but learned absolutely nothing?"
1986.85-889,2,19486,cary_c_lacklen,,1875.531,1885.802,"Well, I think that a reasonableness test on the nature of the container is what this Court should judge the intrusion against."
1986.85-889,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1885.802,1890.42,"So it's reasonable to open the backpack, but not reasonable to open the nylon bag?"
1986.85-889,2,19486,cary_c_lacklen,,1890.42,1892.122,"I would submit yes, because--"
1986.85-889,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1892.122,1892.906,"Well, why?"
1986.85-889,2,19486,cary_c_lacklen,,1892.906,1901.812,--Because the nylon bag could not have contained... or the cannisters that were actually the last layer of container opened could not have contained anything dangerous.
1986.85-889,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1901.812,1903.597,"Well, but it isn't just dangerousness."
1986.85-889,2,19486,cary_c_lacklen,,1907.132,1911.168,"I understand, and we feel that there are less intrusive alternatives of storage."
1986.85-889,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1911.168,1916.738,"Well, but since when have we applied the less intrusive alternative to this particular kind of search?"
1986.85-889,2,19486,cary_c_lacklen,,1916.738,1925.343,Clearly there's language in Lafayette that says that the Court in the abstract is not going to be governed by a less intrusive alternative.
1986.85-889,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1938.835,1944.489,"Yes, but that's a correct inquiry only if the authorities support it."
1986.85-889,2,19486,cary_c_lacklen,,1944.489,1956.447,"I would agree, and on the facts of this case the Colorado Supreme Court found that there were less intrusive alternatives balanced against this governmental interest to find out what was in the cannister."
1986.85-889,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1956.447,1960.267,"Well, does that mean that every single inventory search then has this kind of ad hoc analysis?"
1986.85-889,2,19486,cary_c_lacklen,,1974.61,1989.87,"We would agree, and I think our argument is that the bright line rule here should be that closed containers should not be inventoried in a situation where the police have no reason to believe or no reasonable suspicion to believe that the container contains anything dangerous."
1986.85-889,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2000.076,2005.979,"Well, what do you do with these tin cans or these containers?"
1986.85-889,2,19486,cary_c_lacklen,,2007.664,2009.414,The Colorado... yes.
1986.85-889,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2011.199,2015.151,So you just ignore the fact that they might contain valuables?
1986.85-889,2,19486,cary_c_lacklen,,2015.151,2023.591,"--Well, clearly in an Opperman situation, where the storage lot where the car or truck was being taken, that would be unreasonable for the police to have to do that."
1986.85-889,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2028.161,2030.447,"So your answer to my question is yes, leave them there?"
1986.85-889,2,19486,cary_c_lacklen,,2030.447,2031.63,"--Well, there's an alternative."
1986.85-889,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2051.193,2056.312,What do you think the rule is in the police station when you arrest somebody?
1986.85-889,2,19486,cary_c_lacklen,,2056.312,2063.851,"Clearly, in the Lafayette situation, where the person is being booked into the jail, you can search anything that's on his person."
1986.85-889,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2063.851,2064.634,Why?
1986.85-889,2,19486,cary_c_lacklen,,2064.634,2066.62,We would submit that the--
1986.85-889,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2066.62,2074.456,Suppose you open a backpack in the police station after arrest and you see these very containers.
1986.85-889,2,19486,cary_c_lacklen,,2077.359,2078.011,--Clearly you can.
1986.85-889,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2078.011,2079.161,Why?
1986.85-889,2,19486,cary_c_lacklen,,2079.161,2081.13,"Clearly, the exigencies in the--"
1986.85-889,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2081.13,2082.913,Exigency about what?
1986.85-889,2,19486,cary_c_lacklen,,2082.913,2084.914,--Of danger in the jail--
1986.85-889,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2084.914,2095.02,"Well, I don't accept your statement that there's no reasonable suspicion or no reasonable possibility that these containers contained anything dangerous."
1986.85-889,2,19486,cary_c_lacklen,,2096.722,2102.59,"--Well, clearly in Lafayette, which we think is a correct decision, in the jail setting the exigencies of the possibility--"
1986.85-889,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2102.59,2103.709,What exigency?
1986.85-889,2,19486,cary_c_lacklen,,2103.709,2109.879,--The possibility of a prisoner getting a hold of a dangerous instrumentality that's in a container.
1986.85-889,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2109.879,2110.562,"Well, I know."
1986.85-889,2,19486,cary_c_lacklen,,2118.132,2118.616,Well--
1986.85-889,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2118.616,2119.199,Then what?
1986.85-889,2,19486,cary_c_lacklen,,2124.536,2130.44,--We would submit that the interest in taking care of property doesn't outweigh the Fourth Amendment interest in--
1986.85-889,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2130.44,2134.057,I think you really are suggesting that Lafayette ought to be kind of chewed up.
1986.85-889,2,19486,cary_c_lacklen,,2134.057,2137.359,"--No, we're in total agreement with Lafayette, because it's in a jail setting."
1986.85-889,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2138.859,2147.715,"Well, I know, but you take this briefcase into the... or you take this backpack or the cannisters into the police station."
1986.85-889,2,19486,cary_c_lacklen,,2151.75,2152.467,--Clearly the--
1986.85-889,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2152.467,2154.119,Along with him.
1986.85-889,2,19486,cary_c_lacklen,,2154.119,2160.606,"--Clearly, if Mr. Bertine had taken his backpack with him when he was arrested by Officer Toporek, it would be covered by Lafayette."
1986.85-889,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2170.478,2171.68,It seems to me it cuts just the other way.
1986.85-889,2,19486,cary_c_lacklen,,2206.985,2219.393,"Well, we would submit that in this case the Colorado Supreme Court found that the storage lot was fenced, lighted, patrolled, and there had never been a theft from any of the vehicles stored in this particular--"
1986.85-889,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2219.393,2221.745,"But it's not inside a police station, either."
1986.85-889,2,19486,cary_c_lacklen,,2221.745,2222.145,--No.
1986.85-889,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2226.148,2234.218,So it's clearly less secure than the place where the cigarette pack is going to go in Lafayette.
1986.85-889,2,19486,cary_c_lacklen,,2234.218,2242.841,"I think the problem in Lafayette, the way would analyze that case, is that the purse was in the police station and the police had an obligation to deal with it."
1986.85-889,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2262.572,2266.19,"They were arresting this person because he was intoxicated, correct?"
1986.85-889,2,19486,cary_c_lacklen,,2266.19,2267.107,"That's correct, he was arrested for driving while--"
1986.85-889,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2267.107,2273.761,And you want to ask him in his intoxicated state whether he minds whether they leave his valuables on the street?
1986.85-889,2,19486,cary_c_lacklen,,2273.761,2274.38,--Clearly--
1986.85-889,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2274.38,2276.913,And you're going to hold him to whatever he says?
1986.85-889,2,19486,cary_c_lacklen,,2276.913,2282.784,"--Clearly, the waiver of the liability, if he would be doing that, could be done even in an intoxicated state."
1986.85-889,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2380.732,2383.684,That's a good reason for not adopting an inventory rule.
1986.85-889,2,19486,cary_c_lacklen,,2405.597,2406.247,Yes.
1986.85-889,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2406.247,2409.732,Why is there any reason to believe that there are valuables in the glove compartment?
1986.85-889,2,19486,cary_c_lacklen,,2414.12,2419.44,We would submit that the glove compartment is part of an integral part of the vehicle and can't be separated from the vehicle itself.
1986.85-889,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2425.011,2429.963,So anything that can be taken and removed to the station must be taken to the station?
1986.85-889,2,19486,cary_c_lacklen,,2445.04,2448.959,"Well, I think that the police have an option, depending on what is reasonable under the circumstances."
1986.85-889,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2456.963,2458.899,I'm still not sure.
1986.85-889,2,19486,cary_c_lacklen,,2474.925,2480.329,"Our argument is that if it looks like it contains something valuable, it should be removed and stored at the police station."
1986.85-889,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2480.329,2480.696,Okay.
1986.85-889,2,19486,cary_c_lacklen,,2496.274,2518.771,"Clearly, the police can protect the defendant's Fourth Amendment privacy interests and protect their own interests against false claims or property by either storing the backpack or the container at the police station for the short period of time that someone arrested for a minor traffic offense, such as in this case, would be in custody."
1986.85-889,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2574.473,2576.842,May I just... what do you think is really at stake in this case?
1986.85-889,2,19486,cary_c_lacklen,,2585.364,2591.767,"--Well, there are many, many different types of circumstances where the police come into contact with someone's personal property."
1986.85-889,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2591.767,2596.136,"Yes, but are there many cases where they take a vehicle in without arresting its driver?"
1986.85-889,2,19486,cary_c_lacklen,,2596.136,2607.027,"I think there's a footnote in 100,000 cars were towed for parking Opperman violations, traffic violations, in New York City in one year."
1986.85-889,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2608.813,2614.181,"Really, we're talking about abandoned vehicles as the category of cases we're concerned with, I guess?"
1986.85-889,2,19486,cary_c_lacklen,,2614.181,2619.935,"--Well, the facts of this case clearly are limited to someone being arrested for a minor traffic offense."
1986.85-889,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2644.986,2650.89,The question is whether Joe and Mary Tourist would prefer to have their valuables taken out rather than left somewhere.
1986.85-889,2,19486,cary_c_lacklen,,2651.856,2659.579,"Well, clearly that's something that should be left to the individual's discretion and his consent."
1986.85-889,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2659.579,2664.781,How do you leave it to the individual's discretion if the individual isn't around the vehicle at the time they tow the vehicle in?
1986.85-889,2,19486,cary_c_lacklen,,2666.05,2671.387,"Well, clearly that rule doesn't apply in the facts of this case, and I think Opperman was a--"
1986.85-889,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2671.387,2676.79,"You see, the thing that puzzles me is the facts of this case, everybody seems to agree, would have been covered by Belton anyway."
1986.85-889,2,19486,cary_c_lacklen,,2689.998,2697.454,"--Clearly, the overtime parker or the comatose accident victim is an exception to our prerequisite--"
1986.85-889,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2697.454,2702.673,I guess the rule is that people who are concerned about their briefcases in the car better carry plenty of change.
1986.85-889,2,19486,cary_c_lacklen,,2702.673,2708.927,"--Well, not overpark."
1986.85-889,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2752.401,2755.137,"But that's not open to us here, is it?"
1986.85-889,2,19486,cary_c_lacklen,,2761.073,2767.346,"I agree, but this Court is operating in a vacuum because that finding has never been reviewed by the Colorado Supreme Court."
1986.85-889,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2770.548,2779.904,"Did you make this argument to the Colorado Supreme Court that you're making here, that they should disregard the trial court's finding that it was good faith?"
1986.85-889,2,19486,cary_c_lacklen,,2779.904,2787.141,--The interlocutory nature of that appeal prevented the defense from raising any findings that went against us.
1986.85-889,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2921.346,2935.07,"Mr. Lacklen, on this point of whether the Colorado Supreme Court got into the pretextuality issue, what does that suggest, that if we were to reverse the Colorado Supreme Court we would have to remand for them to consider that issue?"
1986.85-889,2,19486,cary_c_lacklen,,2936.439,2961.054,"Well, I would suggest that this Court could send this case back to the state court as certiorari improvidently granted, because this case can clearly be analyzed under Belton and, although that has not been briefed and we don't think that Belton applies, clearly the inventory nature of this case is somewhat muddled by the way that the case came to this Court."
1986.85-889,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2961.054,2973.112,"Well, the Colorado Supreme Court clearly held that this was not a proper inventory search, that even if the inventory aspect of it was not pretextual you couldn't have an inventory search."
1986.85-889,2,19486,cary_c_lacklen,,2973.112,2974.064,That's correct.
1986.85-889,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2974.064,2978.099,So I don't see why granting certiorari on that issue was improvident.
1986.85-889,2,19486,cary_c_lacklen,,2983.503,2992.959,"Well, the case clearly has to be remanded to the state court, because the state court didn't rule on the state constitutional grounds on which the evidence was originally suppressed."
1986.85-889,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3034.27,3041.689,Isn't it rather unusual that Justice Erickson didn't take up the state constitutional issue?
1986.85-889,2,19486,cary_c_lacklen,,3041.689,3043.758,"Well, we're still trying to figure that one out in Colorado."
1986.85-889,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3043.758,3048.029,He's a very states rights conscious judge.
1986.85-889,2,19486,cary_c_lacklen,,3048.029,3052.331,"Yes, and we would submit that the wording of his ruling is ambiguous."
1986.85-889,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3076.347,3082.5,"Well, you may win the case, whether we expressly remand or not."
1986.85-889,2,19486,cary_c_lacklen,,3093.558,3094.208,It would be.
1986.85-889,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3116.007,3117.84,"Thank you, Mr. Lacklen."
1986.85-889,3,30836,john_m_haried,,3121.359,3121.993,"No, Your Honor."
1986.85-889,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3121.993,3125.195,"Could I ask you one question, since you were kind enough to stand up."
1986.85-889,3,30836,john_m_haried,,3137.253,3138.353,Yes.
1986.85-889,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3138.353,3140.705,For what reason?
1986.85-889,3,30836,john_m_haried,,3140.705,3141.355,Several reasons.
1986.85-889,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3170.808,3171.791,"Thank you, Mr. Haried."
