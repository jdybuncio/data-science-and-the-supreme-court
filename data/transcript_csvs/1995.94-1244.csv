1995.94-1244,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.856,"We'll hear argument next in Number 94-1244, John W. Behrens v. Robert Pelletier."
1995.94-1244,0,35249,lenard_g_weiss,,14.408,16.843,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1995.94-1244,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,148.846,156.0,"Well, how many times is a district court expected to entertain a motion for summary judgment in the same case?"
1995.94-1244,0,35249,lenard_g_weiss,,156.0,170.76,"Normally, I... normally a summary judgment motion in the same case will only occur on one occasion, and normally the district courts that I practice in front of are very careful about scheduling when summary judgment will occur and will not occur."
1995.94-1244,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,170.76,180.568,"So your question arises when there's been an appeal from a motion... a denial of a motion to dismiss, then the second time around on summary judgment?"
1995.94-1244,0,35249,lenard_g_weiss,,180.568,190.006,"Precisely, and usually it comes up in the context of a motion to dismiss, because the question is whether the law is settled or not, and sometimes that is a relatively easy question to answer."
1995.94-1244,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,200.045,228.464,"In that kind of case, where there's an argument at the motion to dismiss stage, and yet there is some indication that further pleadings and discovery will elucidate the issues, does the district court have the authority to say, I want all summary judgment motions relating to sovereign immunity deferred until 6 months of discovery has gone by, I'm not even going to rule on the motion to dismiss, or must he rule on the motion to dismiss?"
1995.94-1244,0,35249,lenard_g_weiss,,228.464,235.968,"A question I'm not certain of the answer, Your Honor, but I believe the court must respond to the motion to dismiss."
1995.94-1244,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,237.32,238.037,Yes.
1995.94-1244,0,35249,lenard_g_weiss,,238.037,239.02,--prediscovery.
1995.94-1244,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,239.02,254.532,"Well, wouldn't you argue that, because I mean, one of the things that... or wouldn't the argument be that one of the protections is a protection against discovery, so if that's going to be the case, then necessarily the argument would be, rule on the motion to dismiss first?"
1995.94-1244,0,35249,lenard_g_weiss,,254.532,256.315,Certainly in the context of qualified immunity--
1995.94-1244,1,19848,cornelia_t_l_pillard,,1094.975,1107.033,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1995.94-1244,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1122.627,1136.136,"Under our rule-making authority, would we have the authority to make a rule that there could be no second appeal without the permission of the district court and a certification that there were, I don't know, extraordinary circumstances, or--"
1995.94-1244,1,19848,cornelia_t_l_pillard,,1136.136,1143.623,I think you would have that authority if you engaged in notice or comment rule-making under 28 U.S.C. 2072.
1995.94-1244,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1154.698,1159.668,"--And it would make... it would require a substantive revision of qualified immunity law, wouldn't it?"
1995.94-1244,1,19848,cornelia_t_l_pillard,,1159.668,1166.572,"It would require a revision of the Mitchell right, that component of the qualified immunity--"
1995.94-1244,2,41933,samuel_t_rees,,1687.637,1693.041,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1995.94-1244,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1723.726,1727.845,"Well, we don't balance interests until we have a basis for doing that."
1995.94-1244,2,41933,samuel_t_rees,,1762.185,1763.218,--Justice--
1995.94-1244,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1763.218,1764.551,--to reach that result.
1995.94-1244,2,41933,samuel_t_rees,,1764.551,1766.17,--Excuse me for interrupting.
1995.94-1244,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1798.605,1799.357,Right.
1995.94-1244,2,41933,samuel_t_rees,,1799.357,1824.923,"In this situation, in the present case before you, and I would submit in virtually every instance except the extreme instance, where there is a second interlocutory appeal, if you are not reexamining for a second time before a second panel an issue already decided by the first panel of the court of appeals, you are of necessity not going to do away with the trial."
1995.94-1244,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1838.016,1838.782,"Well now, wait."
1995.94-1244,2,41933,samuel_t_rees,,1839.232,1839.849,--Okay.
1995.94-1244,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1840.651,1845.036,The immunity right does not exist unless the whole trial is eliminated?
1995.94-1244,2,41933,samuel_t_rees,,1850.34,1851.423,If the--
1995.94-1244,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1851.423,1852.959,--even the first time?
1995.94-1244,2,41933,samuel_t_rees,,1852.959,1872.42,"--In Mitchell... well, the Court's... this Court has never specifically dealt with that issue, but with regard to the civil rights claim, let's assume that there are no claims other than Bivens-type civil rights claim, and we handle the problem, I think, with the district court putting all of the claims together so that they all come up on appeal at the same time."
1995.94-1244,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1889.232,1901.69,"Well, excuse me, I thought the first appeal determined only that there had been a claim which, if proven to be true, would lead to the conclusion that established rights had been violated."
1995.94-1244,2,41933,samuel_t_rees,,1901.69,1903.325,--The--
1995.94-1244,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1903.325,1904.608,They didn't hold that they had been.
1995.94-1244,2,41933,samuel_t_rees,,1904.608,1905.192,--No.
1995.94-1244,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1905.192,1906.277,They held that a claim had been stated.
1995.94-1244,2,41933,samuel_t_rees,,1906.277,1907.243,That's true.
1995.94-1244,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1907.243,1907.826,Okay.
1995.94-1244,2,41933,samuel_t_rees,,1907.826,1910.211,If those facts are proven at trial.
1995.94-1244,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1910.211,1910.745,Yes.
1995.94-1244,2,41933,samuel_t_rees,,1910.745,1915.365,"But it also examined a clearly established right as well, Justice Souter."
1995.94-1244,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1915.365,1916.315,"Well, that's true."
1995.94-1244,2,41933,samuel_t_rees,,1919.101,1926.071,"Certainly, and it examined both the substantive and the procedural due process claim, which are the two claims that were being brought."
1995.94-1244,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1926.071,1943.35,"But the defendant's argument at the 12(b)(6) stage was, even if we take everything you say as true, it... even if we take everything the plaintiff says is true, still the law was not clearly settled with respect to that, and that's the point that the first appeal turned on, at least with respect to the--"
1995.94-1244,2,41933,samuel_t_rees,,1943.35,1955.49,And that's supposed to be the point that every qualified immunity appeal is supposed to turn on if we are dealing with the purely legal issue as opposed to the fact-determinative issues that the court--
1995.94-1244,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1955.49,1956.876,--But what do you do with the second claim?
1995.94-1244,2,41933,samuel_t_rees,,1964.798,1968.417,"--Well, I handle that issue several different ways."
1995.94-1244,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2015.179,2017.445,"Mr. Rees, could I recall you to my question?"
1995.94-1244,2,41933,samuel_t_rees,,2038.442,2040.877,"In Mitchell, the court went that far."
1995.94-1244,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2046.864,2050.768,"But that's your theory, and that's why you think you're entitled to judgment here."
1995.94-1244,2,41933,samuel_t_rees,,2050.768,2052.985,--It clearly supports a one-appeal theory.
1995.94-1244,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2052.985,2057.272,"And when you say trial, you mean trial on any issue whatsoever, so that if any--"
1995.94-1244,2,41933,samuel_t_rees,,2057.272,2057.755,"No, Your Honor."
1995.94-1244,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2057.755,2058.856,"--I'm sorry, then I misunderstood you."
1995.94-1244,2,41933,samuel_t_rees,,2058.856,2059.458,I apologize.
1995.94-1244,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2067.612,2070.063,"Yes, but there's more than one civil rights claim."
1995.94-1244,2,41933,samuel_t_rees,,2070.063,2071.349,--Certainly.
1995.94-1244,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2071.349,2077.685,"And you're saying if there's going to be a trial on any civil rights claim, that in effect defeats the right to a further 1291 appeal."
1995.94-1244,2,41933,samuel_t_rees,,2077.685,2078.752,I'm saying--
1995.94-1244,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2078.752,2080.121,"Yes, or even the first, I guess."
1995.94-1244,2,41933,samuel_t_rees,,2081.621,2083.072,--I'm saying that the district court--
1995.94-1244,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2083.072,2088.608,"Well, excuse me, could you give me a yes or no, if it's... if that's possible, and then explain?"
1995.94-1244,2,41933,samuel_t_rees,,2088.608,2092.862,--I think the answer to your question is yes.
1995.94-1244,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2092.862,2093.612,"Yes, I see."
1995.94-1244,2,41933,samuel_t_rees,,2093.612,2095.777,I think the answer to your question is--
1995.94-1244,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2095.777,2121.595,"I suppose you've abandoned this because you'll lose the case, perhaps, but I thought the theory was that there is a rule under Cohen, which governed Mitchell, which says that you only get the appeal if the thing you're appealing on resolves an important issue completely separate from the merits, which is effectively unreviewable."
1995.94-1244,2,41933,samuel_t_rees,,2176.432,2176.982,--It--
1995.94-1244,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2176.982,2178.416,Are you seeing what I'm driving at?
1995.94-1244,2,41933,samuel_t_rees,,2178.416,2193.192,"--I understand what you're driving at, but it seems to me that at the point in time that there is a conclusive determination of the issue, then that is the time when the qualified immunity purely legal issue is ripe for appeal."
1995.94-1244,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2193.192,2195.728,In this case they--
1995.94-1244,2,41933,samuel_t_rees,,2195.728,2198.613,"It may be that it's ripe for appeal at the motion to dismiss stage, at the later stage."
1995.94-1244,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2198.613,2205.333,"--In the First Circuit, what people said was, look, you got... you want your appeal now, dismissal of complaint, you waive the later one."
1995.94-1244,2,41933,samuel_t_rees,,2211.403,2212.92,That did not happen here.
1995.94-1244,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2230.9,2253.897,"What's your response to the Solicitor General's example, where the appeal from the motion to dismiss, the pleadings say A plus B plus C facts occur, and the court of appeals says that's a violation of a clearly established rule, discovery, and after discovery, it's clear that C cannot be proven, so that only A plus B exists."
1995.94-1244,2,41933,samuel_t_rees,,2257.634,2266.49,"I would assert, Your Honor, that it should not be allowed to go to the court of appeals, because as soon as you do, A plus B plus C gets another appeal."
1995.94-1244,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2268.723,2277.196,"Well, I don't think so if the district court properly structures so that you only have one... you know, if you only allowed one motion for summary judgment."
1995.94-1244,2,41933,samuel_t_rees,,2277.196,2278.196,"--In this case, when the case--"
1995.94-1244,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2278.196,2279.862,"Well, I... speak generally, if you would."
1995.94-1244,2,41933,samuel_t_rees,,2280.981,2298.275,"--Okay, but I thought this case would be instructive on that issue, because when the case came back down from the court of appeal, after the first appeal, the defendant took some more discovery so that the defendant could raise a slightly different issue with regard to their claim for a second interlocutory--"
1995.94-1244,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2298.275,2302.494,Take my hypothesis that the district court does structure the thing.
1995.94-1244,2,41933,samuel_t_rees,,2329.461,2336.734,"--And then on the motions in limine you have A, the change in A, and A can't be proven."
1995.94-1244,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2336.734,2340.769,"Well, but I'm not at all sure the district court has to indulge all of that."
1995.94-1244,2,41933,samuel_t_rees,,2340.769,2352.51,"Clearly the district court will analyze the case under motions in limine, clearly at the time of the pretrial conference order if not on the eve of trial."
1995.94-1244,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2359.414,2366.253,"Well, but as the Chief Justice said, the district court does not have to allow an infinite number of summary judgment motions."
1995.94-1244,2,41933,samuel_t_rees,,2382.296,2384.631,"--And clearly a rule, Justice Souter--"
1995.94-1244,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2384.631,2385.798,"The answer is yes, it can."
1995.94-1244,2,41933,samuel_t_rees,,2385.798,2386.131,--Yes.
1995.94-1244,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2386.464,2386.964,All right.
1995.94-1244,2,41933,samuel_t_rees,,2455.525,2456.275,No.
1995.94-1244,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2456.275,2457.31,Why?
1995.94-1244,2,41933,samuel_t_rees,,2457.31,2472.92,"That is one of the benefits, Justice Souter, of the district court's ability to fashion the pretrial proceedings to structure the qualified immunity issues, even insofar as their appeal, so that that issue can be raised and conclusively determined so that a single appeal--"
1995.94-1244,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2472.92,2483.692,"No, but what if the... the district court says, I'm not going to let you go up on... following the denial of your motion to dismiss, because I want to make sure discovery is over before you appeal."
1995.94-1244,2,41933,samuel_t_rees,,2509.993,2511.445,--It's a practical--
1995.94-1244,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2511.445,2511.861,--wouldn't it?
1995.94-1244,2,41933,samuel_t_rees,,2511.861,2515.397,--It's clearly a practical way for the district court to attempt to destroy--
1995.94-1244,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2515.397,2517.432,"It's... yes, and it would destroy it."
1995.94-1244,2,41933,samuel_t_rees,,2517.432,2521.984,--Assuming there's no mandate issued from the circuit court when the defendant said--
1995.94-1244,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2521.984,2522.586,"Yes, but if the district court--"
1995.94-1244,2,41933,samuel_t_rees,,2522.586,2523.269,--I'm entitled to have a decision.
1995.94-1244,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2523.269,2529.74,"--If the district court did that, it would be in violation of the qualified immunity protection against discovery, wouldn't it?"
1995.94-1244,2,41933,samuel_t_rees,,2529.74,2530.54,It would--
1995.94-1244,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2530.54,2534.81,Let's assume the district court just takes this in hand and does what I have outlined.
1995.94-1244,2,41933,samuel_t_rees,,2538.678,2545.332,--The qualified immunity... it would destroy the ability of the defendant to completely avoid discovery.
1995.94-1244,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2545.332,2545.815,Right.
1995.94-1244,2,41933,samuel_t_rees,,2545.815,2546.865,On the basis of qualified immunity.
1995.94-1244,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2546.865,2552.152,"Now, same result on the one appeal rule that you want."
1995.94-1244,2,41933,samuel_t_rees,,2581.838,2582.421,You--
1995.94-1244,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2582.421,2587.409,"You either have one appeal, or you're going to destroy, in effect, the discovery protection."
1995.94-1244,2,41933,samuel_t_rees,,2587.409,2593.813,"--Yes, and you will destroy that discovery protection by the defendant's own choosing."
1995.94-1244,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2598.55,2601.168,"Well, that's like saying you can condition anything on the waiver of a constitutional right."
1995.94-1244,2,41933,samuel_t_rees,,2611.69,2613.559,It is clearly a requirement of Cohen.
1995.94-1244,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2613.559,2617.194,"And that requirement is not fulfilled if he fails on the first appeal, is it?"
1995.94-1244,2,41933,samuel_t_rees,,2617.194,2620.046,It is not... it is not satisfied.
1995.94-1244,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2620.046,2631.704,"Your position makes entire sense if you are correct in referring to ""the qualified immunity issue"" as though it is a single issue at all stages, but that's the vice of it."
1995.94-1244,2,41933,samuel_t_rees,,2653.969,2661.123,"There is also the price, Justice Scalia, on the other side, which is from the multiple interlocutory appeal and the delay--"
1995.94-1244,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2661.123,2675.966,"Well, when you say multiple, what is your response to the fact that if the... to the, I thought fairly plausible argument that if the district court does, indeed, manage its discovery and its summary judgment practice, the so-called multiple is really a practical maximum of two appeals."
1995.94-1244,2,41933,samuel_t_rees,,2690.242,2708.187,"--If you are going to fashion a rule that allows for two appeals of the issue, and you're going to attempt not to have the forum-shopping within the circuit of one panel says yes and another panel says no because you're having the same issue reviewed a second time."
1995.94-1244,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2708.187,2711.472,"Well, let's assume you don't have an intracircuit problem of chaos."
1995.94-1244,2,41933,samuel_t_rees,,2730.117,2734.254,"Well, not only does it lead to the potential, I think it leads to the absolute conclusion--"
1995.94-1244,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2734.254,2735.104,"Well, is it... is that an unsound argument?"
1995.94-1244,2,41933,samuel_t_rees,,2735.104,2740.241,"--It is clearly... from a balancing point of view, it is an unsatisfactory--"
1995.94-1244,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2740.241,2741.175,"Well, I'm not balancing."
1995.94-1244,2,41933,samuel_t_rees,,2747.229,2762.505,"--In the majority of cases it will result in only two appeals, but it will also result in almost every case in two appeals, because it is clearly in the defendant's claimed interest to delay the resolution of the case by taking the two appeals."
1995.94-1244,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2762.505,2769.594,"Well, we've said it's... the defendant has got a constitutional qualified immunity interest to avoid discovery."
1995.94-1244,2,41933,samuel_t_rees,,2773.629,2775.248,I believe that--
1995.94-1244,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2775.248,2786.972,"I mean, you're branding him as somebody, in fact, who's taking advantage of the system, and it seems to me that the so-called system is the qualified immunity system, which we have recognized."
1995.94-1244,2,41933,samuel_t_rees,,2817.889,2818.972,--It was a balancing issue--
1995.94-1244,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2818.972,2819.389,Where was that?
1995.94-1244,2,41933,samuel_t_rees,,2819.389,2819.755,--that was done--
1995.94-1244,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2819.755,2820.289,Where was that?
1995.94-1244,2,41933,samuel_t_rees,,2820.289,2821.091,--as well.
1995.94-1244,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2822.491,2825.793,"You mean a special, separate constitutional right not to undergo discovery?"
1995.94-1244,2,41933,samuel_t_rees,,2826.745,2827.561,--It is not.
1995.94-1244,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2829.178,2835.332,"--But in any case, we've recognized it, and we would have to go back on our prior rulings in order to accommodate your position."
1995.94-1244,2,41933,samuel_t_rees,,2835.332,2836.351,--I don't believe so.
