2000.99-1978,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.189,"We'll hear argument now in Number 99-1978, United States v. Terry J. Hatter."
2000.99-1978,0,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,9.371,12.26,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2000.99-1978,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,86.07,90.528,"Excuse me, how does that nondiscriminatory get into it?"
2000.99-1978,0,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,110.961,111.704,"That is correct, Justice Scalia."
2000.99-1978,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,111.704,118.475,Although you could say they're clearly not trying to impair the independence of judges.
2000.99-1978,0,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,118.475,153.564,"That's the holding, of course, of Will, which is that a nondiscriminatory reduction in Federal employees' salaries that includes judges does violate the Compensation Clause, but it's one thing to say that a direct reduction of judges' salaries violates the plain language of the clause, because it is, after all, a diminution of their compensation that is owed to them for their services, but it's another thing... and... but it's another thing to say that a tax, which is not a direct reduction of their compensation but is an obligation that they must share with all other citizens, implicates the Compensation Clause."
2000.99-1978,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,153.564,161.737,"Why is that, because a tax doesn't have anything to do with their compensation, and therefore it doesn't count?"
2000.99-1978,0,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,166.938,167.681,"First of all, I think--"
2000.99-1978,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,167.681,172.222,"If it doesn't have anything to do with compensation, you could do it discriminatorily, I assume."
2000.99-1978,0,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,172.222,175.111,--I'm not sure it would violate the Compensation Clause itself.
2000.99-1978,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,203.43,208.177,"Well, what cases support the... your second hypothesis?"
2000.99-1978,0,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,218.208,256.185,"--Mr. Chief Justice, I think the cases like Plaut v. Spendthrift Farm show that there are broader principles protecting the independence of the judiciary that go beyond some political interference, that go beyond just the Compensation Clause, but I want to add, even if I'm wrong, and even if one should analyze the discriminatory tax on judges' salaries under the Compensation Clause, that doesn't mean one would have to also conclude that a nondiscriminatory tax violates the Compensation Clause, because the clause would still be interpreted in light of its central purpose, which is to protect judges from interference with their function by the political branches."
2000.99-1978,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,256.185,275.133,"Well, but maybe... you call it a central purpose, but it's not the only purpose, and it's clear that another purpose is to enable those who come to the bench, setting aside a lucrative profession, to be able to be sure that they will get so much money over the term of their lifetime service."
2000.99-1978,0,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,277.529,283.761,"--I certainly acknowledge that that is a benefit that the Compensation Clause has, but I think it's... I think it's--"
2000.99-1978,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,283.761,284.504,A purpose.
2000.99-1978,0,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,284.504,287.559,"--Well, I'm not sure that I agree that that is a central purpose of the Compensation Clause."
2000.99-1978,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,287.559,289.788,"--You disagree with Alexander Hamilton, then?"
2000.99-1978,0,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,289.788,317.652,"But I... Hamilton said that that would certainly be a benefit of the clause, but I think that even if that's... even if that's so, and even if I agree with you, it doesn't necessarily follow... it doesn't follow, in fact, that every expectation that a judge had, that he brought with him, or her, when taking office, was protected from any disparagement or any adverse effect by later action in Congress."
2000.99-1978,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,339.489,346.176,"But there, it was because they had not yet become effective, and therefore they were not part of the compensation that the judges had--"
2000.99-1978,0,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,346.176,360.294,But the broader point is that it just is not the case that every single expectation that a judge has about his financial position when he takes office is something that the Compensation Clause freezes in place.
2000.99-1978,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,388.612,397.174,"--Perhaps, but is it fair to equate payments into a retirement system with general taxes?"
2000.99-1978,0,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,429.934,446.076,"Well, I think that they bear elements, Social Security bears some analogizing to a contribution to a retirement scheme, but it also is principally a tax that is laid on the wages and salaries of every earner."
2000.99-1978,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,446.076,452.392,"It's quite... it's actually quite different from other compensation schemes, where you get out what you--"
2000.99-1978,0,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,452.392,452.492,Right--
2000.99-1978,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,452.492,454.621,--a fraction of what you paid in.
2000.99-1978,0,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,461.037,466.964,"--The... not only that, but there's both a floor and a ceiling in Social Security benefits."
2000.99-1978,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,478.398,485.169,"And you could be... you can be a bachelor, or you could have nine children, and it would be the same."
2000.99-1978,0,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,494.54,494.861,--Right.
2000.99-1978,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,494.861,496.314,It's not a tax.
2000.99-1978,0,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,496.314,507.543,"It's a pay-as-you-go system, principally, and it operates on a principle that a large fund is being financed by all taxpayers, and that all taxpayers... and that all wage-earners also derive a benefit from it, but there's no direct connection."
2000.99-1978,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,507.543,516.005,"This was meant to replace for these judges the Civil Service retirement system, wasn't it, which they previously had been entitled to participate in?"
2000.99-1978,0,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,516.005,517.202,"Actually, no."
2000.99-1978,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,536.77,544.134,"Congress replaced that element of compensation with the Social Security system for other Federal employees, right?"
2000.99-1978,0,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,544.134,546.363,For Federal employees--
2000.99-1978,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,546.363,549.047,And yet you say that it really has nothing to do with--
2000.99-1978,0,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,549.047,550.244,"--Well, I--"
2000.99-1978,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,550.244,552.557,--retirement or compensation for retirement.
2000.99-1978,0,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,554.991,561.39,"--Well, I... no, I don't think that Congress thought that Social Security is a Civil Service retirement system."
2000.99-1978,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,579.017,591.749,"Why is the contributory versus noncontributory factor, whether you get out as much as you put in, why does that have anything to do with whether it is realistically regarded as part of your total compensation?"
2000.99-1978,0,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,607.874,614.561,"Well, first, the question here is not whether judges' Social Security benefits are part of their compensation."
2000.99-1978,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,672.024,684.944,"But you could say that Congress did have a focus on the judiciary here, since judges weren't included until 1983, and then it was decided to bring judges in, who had not been in before."
2000.99-1978,0,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,684.944,690.517,"--Mr. Chief Justice, Congress... it's true Congress brought judges... Congress eliminated the exemption."
2000.99-1978,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,725.111,745.917,"That may be, but when they do come to the step of extending it or not extending it to this very discrete group of individuals, judges, you're confronted with the problem that they may be induced to extend it or not to extend it on the basis of whether they like judges or not, on the basis of whether they think these judges have been coming out with decisions of the sort they like or not."
2000.99-1978,0,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,763.749,771.922,"Well, first of all, there is no claim in this case that Congress did this for that reason, that Congress extended the coverage of the programs to judges."
2000.99-1978,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,771.922,773.037,"I don't know how you'd find that out, to tell you the truth."
2000.99-1978,0,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,773.037,776.298,"Well, second, this isn't... excuse me."
2000.99-1978,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,786.123,796.814,"Well, but many judges, speaking generally, had already qualified for the Social Security system in private practice."
2000.99-1978,0,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,799.581,800.696,Some judges might have not.
2000.99-1978,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,828.148,845.155,"The figures that I have said that 95 percent of those who were judges in 198... '82, '92... '82... '82, 95 percent had already maxed out, so as to that 95 percent, this had the effect of nothing but a tax."
2000.99-1978,0,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,845.155,845.527,--I don't think it would matter.
2000.99-1978,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,845.527,848.21,That's at least the figures I saw.
2000.99-1978,0,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,850.522,854.526,"I think that there was a wide variety in judges' experience, and--"
2000.99-1978,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,854.526,855.723,You think these figures are not right?
2000.99-1978,0,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,855.723,860.925,"--I think it probably is the case that the majority of judges, majority of judges were already fully insured."
2000.99-1978,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,860.925,873.351,"Now, is it also right that... is it also the case that when this was extended to, let's say... how many million in Federal employees were there in... there were about, say, 5, 10 million Federal employees, extended--"
2000.99-1978,0,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,873.351,874.671,"A couple of million, I think."
2000.99-1978,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,874.671,875.869,"--A couple of million, all right."
2000.99-1978,0,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,909.843,911.329,"Well, that's not quite--"
2000.99-1978,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,911.329,918.016,--but in fact only a few had to opt out because it didn't cover any sitting employee but for those few.
2000.99-1978,0,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,918.016,949.967,"--Well, first of all it's not quite right, which is that in the first place one has to remember that close situation of employees of the legislative branch and Members of Congress, who before 1984 were not mandatorily covered by either CSRS or Social Security, and they were required, as of '84, basically to choose one, and so they were in roughly the same situation as Federal judges, which is that beforehand they were not subject to any mandatory contribution, and the other person who is similarly situated is the President of the United States."
2000.99-1978,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,949.967,957.769,The President of the United States and the 800 judges had to accept this Social Security.
2000.99-1978,0,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,958.883,960.369,Members of Congress and legislative employees--
2000.99-1978,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,960.369,960.535,They had to go into the Federal--
2000.99-1978,0,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,960.535,962.681,--They had to accept one or the other.
2000.99-1978,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,962.681,962.931,--So... all right.
2000.99-1978,0,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,970.954,971.78,"Well, they're the only ones who had to--"
2000.99-1978,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,971.78,972.523,Is that right?
2000.99-1978,0,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,973.349,978.839,"--They're the only ones who had to accept it then, yes, but of course 90 percent of the civilian labor force had to accept it."
2000.99-1978,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,978.839,979.21,"No, no--"
2000.99-1978,0,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,979.21,979.665,Right.
2000.99-1978,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,980.863,991.348,"--Isn't that, what you just said, totally irrelevant, in that isn't the issue whether or not a person who was already employed at that time had to accept it?"
2000.99-1978,0,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,993.206,993.206,I understand.
2000.99-1978,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,993.206,994.858,"I'm not making an argument, yet."
2000.99-1978,0,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,996.921,1002.577,"They were the only people who were newly required, as incumbent employees."
2000.99-1978,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1002.577,1005.549,"Now, this is my question, if those facts are right."
2000.99-1978,0,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,1027.346,1027.884,I'm thinking about the end of the question.
2000.99-1978,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1027.884,1042.743,"--No... everybody in the United States happens to get a rebate, exactly of 100,000 dollars, or to make it... and, by the way, our reason for this is not to discriminate against judges."
2000.99-1978,0,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,1057.605,1059.38,I doubt that would be okay.
2000.99-1978,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1059.851,1063.195,"If that's not okay, and I don't think it is either, what's the difference?"
2000.99-1978,0,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,1063.195,1072.466,"--Well, the question is... well, first of all, it seems to me that even though Congress is calling that a tax, it really is not a tax."
2000.99-1978,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1123.364,1123.869,"Well, there is."
2000.99-1978,0,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,1134.0,1139.101,"I don't think it would be in the situation that you present, because it doesn't... I mean--"
2000.99-1978,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1139.101,1139.556,"No, no, no."
2000.99-1978,0,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,1156.646,1168.617,"--Justice Breyer, I agree that when Congress treats judges for tax purposes differently than other people who are similarly situated, it has to have a significant reason for doing so, but I would say two things."
2000.99-1978,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1235.779,1256.379,"Mr. Wolfson, do I understand your argument to be essentially, this is no different than if Congress had initially given Federal judges an exemption from income tax, and they enjoy that exemption... say, a judge when he took office got that exemption."
2000.99-1978,0,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,1281.271,1281.931,Right.
2000.99-1978,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1282.097,1284.121,Is it your view that these two cases are the same?
2000.99-1978,0,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,1284.121,1307.915,"--Yes, they are, and that case that you mentioned is basically the case that was decided by the Fourth Circuit in Baker v. Commissioner, after this Court decided O'Malley, and in that case, a panel in which Chief Justice Stone sat, it raised the situation that after this Court's decision in Miles against Graham, Congress exempted judges from the income tax and then, after O'Malley, it brought them back within the income tax--"
2000.99-1978,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1307.915,1309.012,"And that's okay, you say."
2000.99-1978,0,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,1309.012,1310.044,"--Yes, I think that is okay."
2000.99-1978,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1310.044,1310.044,That's okay.
2000.99-1978,0,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,1310.044,1310.582,"Yes, and--"
2000.99-1978,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1310.582,1341.046,"You know, there's some science fiction book I read once that had a devilishly clever plot in which one of the protagonists is poisoned, but he has a poison scanner that detects all sorts of poison, so you couldn't get to him that way, and the way they get to him is that they give him something that isn't poison, but that is very addictive, and then withhold it from him, and if he doesn't get it, he will die."
2000.99-1978,1,41942,steven_s_rosenthal,,1528.663,1532.561,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2000.99-1978,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1573.7,1578.447,"What authority in our cases is there for either of those, Mr. Rosenthal?"
2000.99-1978,1,41942,steven_s_rosenthal,,1578.447,1588.272,"Well, with respect to the discrimination, the latter, virtually every one of these cases, especially the Woodrow case, refers to a nondiscriminatory tax."
2000.99-1978,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1651.347,1671.038,"So would you say on that reasoning that when the Social Security tax came in and everybody in the general population was exposed to it, and the judges were not, that the judges' compensation went up, they had an increase... they had an increase in compensation, therefore, that couldn't be decreased later on."
2000.99-1978,1,41942,steven_s_rosenthal,,1671.038,1671.781,Well--
2000.99-1978,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1671.781,1677.371,"You would have to say that, that exempting them from the tax increased their compensation."
2000.99-1978,1,41942,steven_s_rosenthal,,1677.371,1680.426,"--Well, I would prefer to say it the other way."
2000.99-1978,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1701.957,1707.818,"But if they couldn't diminish the compensation, and this is a diminution, you argue--"
2000.99-1978,1,41942,steven_s_rosenthal,,1707.818,1707.984,--Yes.
2000.99-1978,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1707.984,1717.478,"--then equally, it had to be an augmentation when the Social Security first came in and the judges were exempt from it."
2000.99-1978,1,41942,steven_s_rosenthal,,1721.73,1731.595,"Well, I... I'm not sure how I answer the question about whether it was... the exemption constituted an increase."
2000.99-1978,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1745.424,1754.358,"What about a judge who has served... this is perhaps a rather... a very old judge, who was serving in '37."
2000.99-1978,1,41942,steven_s_rosenthal,,1773.371,1778.572,"Your Honor, that is admittedly not this particular case."
2000.99-1978,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1820.76,1822.783,What about a change in the tax rate?
2000.99-1978,1,41942,steven_s_rosenthal,,1822.783,1824.103,No.
2000.99-1978,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1843.877,1846.494,It seems to me that's really stretching Article III.
2000.99-1978,1,41942,steven_s_rosenthal,,1855.022,1862.99,"Well, I think, with respect, I think that a fair reading of Hamilton... Hamilton's--"
2000.99-1978,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1862.99,1863.749,"Well, Hamilton's not a case."
2000.99-1978,1,41942,steven_s_rosenthal,,1863.749,1865.674,"--No, I understand, it's not a case."
2000.99-1978,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1880.823,1884.167,"Well, O'Malley casts some doubt on Evans against Gore, didn't it?"
2000.99-1978,1,41942,steven_s_rosenthal,,1884.167,1911.742,"On the broad reasoning of Evans v. Gore, but O'Malley does... because the Court overturned Miles but didn't overturn Evans, I think a fair reading of this Court's case law, reading the three cases together, is that the principle we're advocating, a change for a sitting judge in... that changes the economic tradeoff, is prohibited by the Compensation Clause."
2000.99-1978,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1916.943,1921.69,All that was involved in O'Malley is it was somebody who came on board--
2000.99-1978,1,41942,steven_s_rosenthal,,1921.69,1922.062,--After--
2000.99-1978,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1922.062,1931.35,"--after the tax, so the Court didn't have to deal with somebody who was already a judge when the tax came on, but is your--"
2000.99-1978,1,41942,steven_s_rosenthal,,1931.35,1931.433,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
2000.99-1978,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1931.433,1955.953,"--I think I grasp your argument correctly that you would say, if the... there is no income tax, and there are sitting judges, and then Congress puts an income tax on the general population, everybody, you can't put it on the judges who were appointed to the bench before the tax came in."
2000.99-1978,1,41942,steven_s_rosenthal,,1955.953,1960.866,"No, that isn't... our position is, this Court doesn't have to reach that question."
2000.99-1978,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1975.744,1977.973,But it changes the tradeoff.
2000.99-1978,1,41942,steven_s_rosenthal,,1989.407,1992.091,"Well, I may have misunderstood Justice Ginsburg's question."
2000.99-1978,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1992.091,1994.691,--I'm deciding whether to take a judgeship.
2000.99-1978,1,41942,steven_s_rosenthal,,1994.691,1995.113,Yes.
2000.99-1978,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1995.113,1998.861,And there's no tax on my income.
2000.99-1978,1,41942,steven_s_rosenthal,,1998.861,2001.667,In the private sector or on the bench.
2000.99-1978,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2001.667,2010.75,"Right, and then I take the bench, and they... but I know what my salary is."
2000.99-1978,1,41942,steven_s_rosenthal,,2010.75,2011.121,That's right.
2000.99-1978,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2011.121,2014.01,And then there is a tax.
2000.99-1978,1,41942,steven_s_rosenthal,,2014.01,2014.753,Imposed on--
2000.99-1978,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2014.753,2019.749,"Imposed on everybody, so my take-home pay is less, because of this tax."
2000.99-1978,1,41942,steven_s_rosenthal,,2019.749,2029.946,"--I would submit, Justice Ginsburg, that on that fact pattern there is no incentive to leave the bench because the tax is the same on both sides of the equals sign."
2000.99-1978,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2029.946,2031.638,"Sure, but the income isn't."
2000.99-1978,1,41942,steven_s_rosenthal,,2052.525,2062.185,"Our position is that, although that additional category might be covered, we don't need to reach that question in this case."
2000.99-1978,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2070.524,2073.784,But I think it does cut against your tradeoff argument.
2000.99-1978,1,41942,steven_s_rosenthal,,2094.219,2099.131,"--Well, Your Honor, I understand that position."
2000.99-1978,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2099.131,2102.847,I really don't think Hamilton would have bought your argument there.
2000.99-1978,1,41942,steven_s_rosenthal,,2105.736,2115.684,"Well, I think the imposition of... this Court held in Evans v. Gore and that the imposition of a new tax does violate the Compensation Clause."
2000.99-1978,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2134.797,2152.796,"--Well, under that same reasoning, if the judges take office and there's no tax for Social Security, and there's a Social Security tax on everybody else, under that reasoning, if Congress decides to repeal the Social Security tax on everybody else, the tradeoff has now been changed as well."
2000.99-1978,1,41942,steven_s_rosenthal,,2152.796,2157.792,And if it did... if it did repeal the tax on everybody else and left it in effect--
2000.99-1978,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2157.792,2168.028,"No, so... even if the judges still don't pay it, they're still in a less advantageous position vis-a-vis everybody else under your tradeoff argument."
2000.99-1978,1,41942,steven_s_rosenthal,,2171.538,2172.487,--Well--
2000.99-1978,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2172.487,2174.344,--without violating your tradeoff theory.
2000.99-1978,1,41942,steven_s_rosenthal,,2174.344,2180.454,"--Well, you would have to be adversely affected by the tradeoff, not advantageously."
2000.99-1978,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2180.454,2186.976,"Well, you're still disadvantaged vis-a-vis the public where you... compared to what it was when you took the bench."
2000.99-1978,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2186.976,2189.742,"This is my poison example, it's the same thing."
2000.99-1978,1,41942,steven_s_rosenthal,,2189.742,2190.774,Look--
2000.99-1978,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2190.774,2195.687,The poison example depends on the idea that judges are addicted to money.
2000.99-1978,2,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,3221.804,3225.148,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2000.99-1978,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3469.94,3475.884,"Well, yes, as long as you're at it, the part that was bothering me was not the part, treating judges the same."
2000.99-1978,2,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,3485.71,3486.081,--Well--
2000.99-1978,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3486.081,3488.765,"--the reason is clear, I guess."
2000.99-1978,2,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,3500.199,3503.088,--It's not just that judges had the pension plan.
2000.99-1978,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3514.317,3515.514,"Thank you, Mr. Wolfson."
