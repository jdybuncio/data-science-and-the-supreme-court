2000.99-929,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.919,"We'll hear argument next in number 99-929, Rebecca Cook v Don Gralike."
2000.99-929,0,31790,james_r_mcadams,,63.411,70.113,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, There are three Democratic principles at stake in this case."
2000.99-929,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,152.017,156.047,"Mr. McAdams, precisely what is the instruction provision?"
2000.99-929,0,31790,james_r_mcadams,,158.343,158.702,Yes.
2000.99-929,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,161.185,161.623,Okay.
2000.99-929,0,31790,james_r_mcadams,,161.623,185.034,"And the instruction is physically contained in Section 17, paragraph one of the proposed amendment, and it relates to Sections 15 and 16 of the amendment, Your Honor, Section 15 stating the intention of the Missouri voters, and Section 16 specifically stating the proposed constitutional amendment that the voters support."
2000.99-929,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,185.034,197.124,"Well, are you arguing to us now on the assumption that the instruction standing alone has no teeth, no enforcement part, and you are going to get to the enforcement part, the teeth part later?"
2000.99-929,0,31790,james_r_mcadams,,197.124,198.139,"That is correct, Your Honor."
2000.99-929,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,218.194,223.88,And this is the provision that Judge Hansen voted to uphold?
2000.99-929,0,31790,james_r_mcadams,,223.88,224.63,That is correct.
2000.99-929,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,224.63,225.442,In doing his dissent?
2000.99-929,0,31790,james_r_mcadams,,225.442,226.395,"That is correct, Your Honor."
2000.99-929,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,236.532,248.354,"But part 2 of the Missouri constitutional Article 8, Section 17, is severable, is it?"
2000.99-929,0,31790,james_r_mcadams,,248.354,249.339,"Yes, Your Honor."
2000.99-929,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,249.339,250.743,The ballot proposition?
2000.99-929,0,31790,james_r_mcadams,,250.743,252.025,"Yes, Your Honor."
2000.99-929,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,262.927,277.202,"And your point is just that disregarding for the moment the provision that has to appear on the ballot by a candidate's name, that the rest of it doesn't violate Article 5?"
2000.99-929,0,31790,james_r_mcadams,,277.202,278.218,"That would be correct, Your Honor."
2000.99-929,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,298.553,308.564,"I think their argument is that it goes beyond information to the point of putting the thumb on the scale, because essentially it uses pejorative language."
2000.99-929,0,31790,james_r_mcadams,,326.573,344.552,"Well, Your Honor, there is nothing that really goes to point three that I made in my opening, that it goes to the specific ballot information and I respond to that by saying, there is nothing that provides voters valuable information that couldn't be used by those voters as the basis for a decision to vote against a candidate."
2000.99-929,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,356.968,362.137,"Well, it's not... I don't know that they have to make the case that the voters are going to be overwhelmed."
2000.99-929,0,31790,james_r_mcadams,,381.473,384.847,"--I simply disagree with that, Your Honor."
2000.99-929,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,389.377,391.923,"Mr. McAdams, can you point to any other example?"
2000.99-929,0,31790,james_r_mcadams,,428.174,436.671,"--Well, I would say that party labels go on the ballot at a time when voters have, I mean candidates have no opportunity to respond back."
2000.99-929,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,444.62,448.556,"Well, I asked you, you gave the party labels example."
2000.99-929,0,31790,james_r_mcadams,,456.833,457.646,"Yes, Your Honor."
2000.99-929,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,457.646,459.552,I don't know of anything comparable to that.
2000.99-929,0,31790,james_r_mcadams,,459.552,461.052,"There is something comparable, Your Honor."
2000.99-929,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,478.56,481.606,"Oh, but that's state legislative candidates, and that's different."
2000.99-929,0,31790,james_r_mcadams,,505.44,515.294,"--Well, First Amendment is one of the claims that they make, Your Honor, and the First Amendment claim would equally be evadable to a situation like the State of Nebraska did."
2000.99-929,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,521.042,530.616,"Well, do you have any other example of someone running for federal office, the House or the Senate, where there is such a label?"
2000.99-929,0,31790,james_r_mcadams,,530.616,534.584,"I believe there... not exactly like this label, Your Honor."
2000.99-929,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,539.409,557.059,"I think in Arizona, at least at one time, candidates for the Senate and the House of Representatives had to say they were pledged to recall, which meant that if the state legislature recalled them, they would have to resign."
2000.99-929,0,31790,james_r_mcadams,,560.792,562.698,"I was not aware of that example, Your Honor."
2000.99-929,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,562.698,567.212,--Excuse me.
2000.99-929,0,31790,james_r_mcadams,,570.711,571.93,"I'm not aware of that, Your Honor."
2000.99-929,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,583.939,622.86,"Well, doesn't the information, given the courts' cases here anyway, have to be generally applicable and evenhanded, like all the regulation because if it's not, that's... I mean, that phrase comes from a case called Anderson, but there are many of like tenor, it seems to me, that if it's not generally applicable and evenhanded, the state, for no legitimate regulatory interest, is biasing the election, which, which hurts the First Amendment rights of all those who happen to think that term limits is not the most important issue in the election, that would prefer the election were decided on the basis of other issues."
2000.99-929,0,31790,james_r_mcadams,,622.86,624.688,Well--
2000.99-929,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,626.078,624.688,Whatever.
2000.99-929,0,31790,james_r_mcadams,,626.468,633.388,--There is nothing about providing information that dictates that it is the basis upon which voters will choose.
2000.99-929,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,633.388,643.993,"Well, of course, that's generally true, and it's for that reason that when we get down to the ballot itself, which normally, regulation of the ballot is not for information providing purposes."
2000.99-929,0,31790,james_r_mcadams,,659.425,663.048,"Well, I think Timmons used the phrase reasonable."
2000.99-929,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,665.735,666.28,Yes.
2000.99-929,0,31790,james_r_mcadams,,683.602,692.911,"Well, Your Honor, right now, we have a situation where the state only provides information about party affiliation."
2000.99-929,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,692.911,699.814,"Party affiliation is not... the candidate, I take it, voluntarily associates himself with that and wants that on the ballot."
2000.99-929,0,31790,james_r_mcadams,,699.814,703.0,Some do and some don't.
2000.99-929,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,704.062,709.638,"Well, are there instances where the affiliation was put on the ballot over the objection of the candidate?"
2000.99-929,0,31790,james_r_mcadams,,709.638,711.747,"--There are no cases in that regard, Your Honor."
2000.99-929,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,711.747,719.478,"I suppose in most of the south, until maybe 25 years ago, I'm sure the Republican would not have wanted his name on the ballot."
2000.99-929,0,31790,james_r_mcadams,,719.478,721.15,I'm quite certain in the south.
2000.99-929,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,721.15,722.072,For his party affiliation on it.
2000.99-929,0,31790,james_r_mcadams,,722.072,726.946,"I'm quite certain that is true, Your Honor, and I think that's true for third party candidates today as well."
2000.99-929,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,759.01,765.227,You can argue about whether a party label is generally applicable and evenhanded.
2000.99-929,0,31790,james_r_mcadams,,777.426,782.141,I'm not denying the principle that the state cannot mislead voters.
2000.99-929,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,782.141,782.922,That wasn't the principle.
2000.99-929,0,31790,james_r_mcadams,,790.513,793.06,And I believe this is generally applicable.
2000.99-929,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,793.06,795.885,You accept the principle and the issue of whether this is evenhanded?
2000.99-929,0,31790,james_r_mcadams,,795.885,801.244,"I am not aware of any basis for disputing that principle, Your Honor."
2000.99-929,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,801.244,803.446,Do you say that it's evenhanded?
2000.99-929,0,31790,james_r_mcadams,,803.446,804.492,"I do, Your Honor."
2000.99-929,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,804.492,805.804,Could you call it the Scarlet Letter?
2000.99-929,0,31790,james_r_mcadams,,805.804,808.491,"I don't call it the Scarlet Letter, Your Honor."
2000.99-929,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,814.754,818.347,Could a Republican state label a Democrat dirty Democrats?
2000.99-929,0,31790,james_r_mcadams,,818.347,819.097,"No, Your Honor."
2000.99-929,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,819.097,819.503,No?
2000.99-929,0,31790,james_r_mcadams,,839.51,846.287,"Well, in that situation the state is expressing a judgment on the candidate that actually invades the province of the voter."
2000.99-929,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,851.364,855.127,How does that invade the province of the voter in a way that is not true here?
2000.99-929,0,31790,james_r_mcadams,,856.096,862.298,"Well, the distinction is that that amounts to, in my mind, a recommendation to vote against the candidate."
2000.99-929,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,884.039,892.411,"Well, if you are trying to tell us that this does not disadvantage the candidate in any way, I just find that very difficult to accept."
2000.99-929,0,31790,james_r_mcadams,,892.411,893.596,"And that is not what I'm saying, Your Honor."
2000.99-929,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,897.096,899.158,"But on your theory, I suppose--"
2000.99-929,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,899.158,900.344,--But then it's not neutral.
2000.99-929,0,31790,james_r_mcadams,,900.344,909.621,"Well, it's just as neutral as party labels, because party labels disadvantage candidates."
2000.99-929,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,910.84,921.289,Do you know any state that requires you to put your party affiliation on the ballot when your party affiliation is not the reason you are on the ballot?
2000.99-929,0,31790,james_r_mcadams,,921.289,924.896,"--I do not know of any state that does that, Your Honor."
2000.99-929,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,924.896,932.815,"In other words, you can get on the ballot without a party affiliation, if you acquire enough signatures, right?"
2000.99-929,0,31790,james_r_mcadams,,932.815,933.315,Yes.
2000.99-929,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,933.956,959.086,"But the state ballots have lines for the major parties that in the last election got enough votes, so the reason they show that is they are showing you why you are on the ballot, and if you are on the ballot for some other reason, you think they could make somebody who got on the ballot by popular referendum or signatures, you think they could make him declare a party affiliation shown next to his name?"
2000.99-929,0,31790,james_r_mcadams,,959.086,959.711,"No, Your Honor."
2000.99-929,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,960.68,961.537,That's right.
2000.99-929,0,31790,james_r_mcadams,,1023.139,1023.497,That is--
2000.99-929,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1023.497,1024.715,--informs the voters; is that right?
2000.99-929,0,31790,james_r_mcadams,,1024.715,1025.356,"--I'm sorry, Your Honor."
2000.99-929,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1037.179,1042.786,"It certainly would change the election process as we have known it, wouldn't it?"
2000.99-929,0,31790,james_r_mcadams,,1042.786,1052.345,"--Well, in footnote four of Foster versus Love, this Court left open the question of whether or not states must use conventional means to hold elections."
2000.99-929,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1084.535,1088.736,"But Mr. McAdams, the point has been made very forcefully that this is a national legislature."
2000.99-929,0,31790,james_r_mcadams,,1107.135,1110.852,"Well, Your Honor, first of all, I don't think they are obligations."
2000.99-929,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1115.6,1123.66,"But the list of things that the person is supposed to do if you are going to be faithful to that pledge, you have to do all those things."
2000.99-929,0,31790,james_r_mcadams,,1131.75,1135.499,"Your Honor, you only have to propose if it's not otherwise been proposed."
2000.99-929,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1145.12,1157.755,"But that interferes with the basic point, that the relation between the congressmen and the people is one that's direct and does not involve intervention by the state."
2000.99-929,0,31790,james_r_mcadams,,1181.824,1185.416,"But this doesn't interfere with that relationship, Your Honor."
2000.99-929,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1188.866,1190.82,But it seeks to alter and to regulate it.
2000.99-929,0,31790,james_r_mcadams,,1190.82,1193.428,"--I disagree, Your Honor."
2000.99-929,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1209.953,1218.668,"But the purpose of doing this is to control the conduct of the Congressman in office, and I submit to you, there is simply no authority for the state to do that."
2000.99-929,0,31790,james_r_mcadams,,1220.278,1236.519,"The last sentence of Section 16, we, the people of the State of Missouri, have chosen to amend the state Constitution to inform the voters regarding incumbent and nonincumbent federal candidate support for the proposed amendment."
2000.99-929,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1263.4,1274.144,"What about, there are a number of districts within Missouri where the people were not in favor of this proposition."
2000.99-929,0,31790,james_r_mcadams,,1288.234,1292.498,This proposal passed in every congressional district in the State of Missouri.
2000.99-929,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1296.449,1296.903,All right.
2000.99-929,0,31790,james_r_mcadams,,1298.761,1305.446,"Well, the Federal Government through the elections clause tells the states that the state regulates the ballot."
2000.99-929,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1313.973,1320.814,But I... Justice Ginsburg posed a hypothetical that I'm interested in.
2000.99-929,0,31790,james_r_mcadams,,1340.26,1343.571,The same result would apply because the elections--
2000.99-929,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1343.571,1351.177,"So you are, you are allowing the state as an entity to interfere with the relations between the Congressman, the Congresswoman, and those people in the district."
2000.99-929,0,31790,james_r_mcadams,,1351.177,1352.692,"--That's not true, Your Honor."
2000.99-929,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1371.138,1386.039,"Certainly state legislatures before the 17th amendment, if that was the one that provided for direct election of senators, communicated a great deal with their senators."
2000.99-929,0,31790,james_r_mcadams,,1386.039,1387.756,"Absolutely, Your Honor."
2000.99-929,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1395.673,1398.47,"You mean federal senators, well, senators from the state."
2000.99-929,0,31790,james_r_mcadams,,1398.47,1398.923,--Yes.
2000.99-929,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1422.539,1425.224,"This just applies to Congress persons, though, doesn't it?"
2000.99-929,0,31790,james_r_mcadams,,1426.162,1426.709,No.
2000.99-929,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1427.614,1428.036,"Oh, it does."
2000.99-929,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1428.036,1439.407,"There is something about this, the perception, say, of a voter."
2000.99-929,0,31790,james_r_mcadams,,1470.8,1480.343,"Well, we have... we have... the Court has held that elections... pardon me... people cannot politic within so many feet of the polling place, Your Honor."
2000.99-929,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1487.793,1490.104,We haven't held that people can't politic.
2000.99-929,0,31790,james_r_mcadams,,1493.9,1496.024,"That is true, Your Honor."
2000.99-929,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1496.024,1505.302,"In your view, could they, in addition to what's in the capital letters, could they add in the following respects, and then quote the paragraphs that were the failures, the basis for it?"
2000.99-929,0,31790,james_r_mcadams,,1505.302,1505.88,Yes.
2000.99-929,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1507.332,1513.533,"Does, in Missouri, do congressmen take an oath to uphold the state Constitution?"
2000.99-929,0,31790,james_r_mcadams,,1513.533,1518.671,Do federal congressmen take such an oath?
2000.99-929,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1518.671,1519.093,No.
2000.99-929,0,31790,james_r_mcadams,,1525.762,1530.667,"I'm not aware that federal representatives and senators do that, Your Honor."
2000.99-929,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1530.667,1535.118,I would be very surprised if the state could impose that requirement.
2000.99-929,0,31790,james_r_mcadams,,1535.118,1536.415,I think that is true.
2000.99-929,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1536.415,1539.023,"Well, doesn't that prove the point here?"
2000.99-929,0,31790,james_r_mcadams,,1544.677,1545.941,"Absolutely not, Your Honor."
2000.99-929,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1558.764,1567.511,"You think that the, that the state can require congressmen and senators to support the state Constitution by an oath?"
2000.99-929,0,31790,james_r_mcadams,,1567.511,1570.212,--I think they can ask them if they will.
2000.99-929,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1572.337,1574.29,"Very well, Mr. McAdams."
2000.99-929,1,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,1576.398,1583.708,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
2000.99-929,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1597.671,1613.009,"I don't know that that's true about simply the 17-1 provision that Judge Hansen thought was permissible, where it's simply the legislature instructs members of Congress to try to push for a term limits amendment."
2000.99-929,1,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,1615.259,1617.023,"Two points, Your Honor."
2000.99-929,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1621.928,1623.084,"Oh, I thought he did."
2000.99-929,1,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,1623.084,1623.49,No.
2000.99-929,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1681.122,1682.919,"Well let me ask you this, then."
2000.99-929,1,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,1698.601,1703.176,We believe first that it stands together with this law.
2000.99-929,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1704.66,1706.317,I mean constitutionally.
2000.99-929,1,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,1706.317,1720.764,"--The answer is if there were a, just instruction, nothing else, which is not what this case is about, if there were, we would argue in such a case that it would be in that case an impermissible chilling effect on speech."
2000.99-929,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1720.764,1724.606,"Well, but why can't that provision be severed from the other two?"
2000.99-929,1,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,1724.606,1729.134,The principal reason is because the severance question is not before the Court.
2000.99-929,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1729.462,1737.179,"Well, but the Petitioner argues here that the Court of Appeals was wrong right across the board in throwing these out."
2000.99-929,1,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,1745.972,1752.782,"--I would say not, Your Honor, and for the reason that the severability issue is one of state law."
2000.99-929,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1754.282,1759.17,"Well, why couldn't we say the dissenter was right on that point."
2000.99-929,1,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,1769.65,1778.412,"--I think it would be open to the Court, had the issue been raised and briefed and we had briefed the question under Missouri state law as to what, what is or is not severable."
2000.99-929,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1801.872,1816.959,"But if we agree with some of the reasons they gave, that is, that some of the provisions are bad, but we think that some of the other ones are good, why... we don't necessarily have to reach the severability point ourselves."
2000.99-929,1,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,1827.033,1833.077,Because the Court would be reaching the severability issue in that case and remanding it to--
2000.99-929,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1833.077,1833.796,"No, we wouldn't."
2000.99-929,1,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,1845.072,1848.041,--But the Court of Appeals did address the severability question.
2000.99-929,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1850.556,1857.694,But I think several of us feel that it isn't really an issue of severability at all that we would decide here.
2000.99-929,1,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,1874.515,1898.989,"--Well, let me then get into why the Court, if the Court were just to consider the instruction provision standing alone, which I understand is the issue that was raised, we would argue, for the first time today, if the Court were to, just to consider that, it would have to hold that contrary to Judge Bartlett's decision in this case, the instructions provisions can be implemented or enforced, which is the injunction that this Court, we are asking the Court to affirm."
2000.99-929,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1898.989,1899.364,No.
2000.99-929,1,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,1902.223,1902.661,Yes.
2000.99-929,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1902.661,1904.425,--In a hypothetical case.
2000.99-929,1,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,1904.425,1904.831,Yes.
2000.99-929,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1904.831,1916.435,"A state can simply instruct its federal representatives, congressmen and senators, that it wants them to work for a particular objective."
2000.99-929,1,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,1920.887,1922.777,"No, it is not."
2000.99-929,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1938.365,1942.145,But certainly there was much instruction to the senators at one time.
2000.99-929,1,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,1942.145,1950.266,"--The difference here, and it's an important difference, is this instruction is codified as law, is given the force of legal command, it is in the Missouri Constitution."
2000.99-929,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1951.78,1953.53,Let's say they use the word advice.
2000.99-929,1,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,1963.478,1966.212,"--It would be different, Your Honor."
2000.99-929,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1969.602,1972.647,So the difference is between instruction and advice?
2000.99-929,1,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,1972.647,1973.585,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2000.99-929,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1989.876,1993.216,In what capacity was George Washington speaking?
2000.99-929,1,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,1993.216,2001.791,"He was in that case writing a letter to his nephew who was a future justice of this Supreme Court, Bushrod Washington."
2000.99-929,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2033.201,2034.168,But it's not a legal command.
2000.99-929,1,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,2058.034,2065.438,"And all we are asking this Court to do is to, as Judge Bartlett did, say that the state may not implement or enforce the provision."
2000.99-929,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2065.438,2075.043,May I get... the only implementation or enforcement that I'm aware of is the implementation or enforcement in the form of the ballot statements; is that correct?
2000.99-929,1,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,2075.043,2075.527,That is correct.
2000.99-929,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2075.996,2087.693,"So that our case boils down to whether in the whole context, all the provisions in the Constitution, may the state include these, as you put it, ballot disparagements."
2000.99-929,1,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,2089.303,2089.786,--Yes.
2000.99-929,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2099.127,2099.377,Right.
2000.99-929,1,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,2107.843,2108.139,That is correct.
2000.99-929,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2149.81,2156.557,"Let me get this straight because apparently, something may turn up that I don't fully understand."
2000.99-929,1,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,2169.521,2171.91,There was no declaratory judgment in this case.
2000.99-929,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2172.941,2182.906,"Well then, does the injunction have any consequence with respect to that provision of the Missouri Constitution?"
2000.99-929,1,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,2182.906,2185.045,"Which provision, Your Honor?"
2000.99-929,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2185.358,2188.966,The provision that simply says the legislature instructs.
2000.99-929,1,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,2188.966,2189.325,Yes.
2000.99-929,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2211.378,2222.281,And I suppose you would say that the injunction has importance and continuing significance in the event the legislature attempts some other means of enforcement?
2000.99-929,1,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,2222.281,2223.062,"Certainly, Your Honor."
2000.99-929,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2238.164,2247.348,But what if Missouri had done nothing but pass that part which said we instruct senators and... there is no known prospect of enforcement at all.
2000.99-929,1,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,2247.348,2261.046,"We would argue in such a case that it would contravene the First Amendment because it would be a chilling effect on speech for the reasons essentially that George Washington stated, which is that the sense, but not the law of the district, may be given."
2000.99-929,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2262.967,2263.826,But it wouldn't be the law.
2000.99-929,1,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,2266.06,2267.138,"--It would still be the law, Your Honor."
2000.99-929,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2267.138,2274.682,"It seems to me, though, we get a lot, we used to get a lot of things that we call upon our delegation in Congress to declare this National Pork Week."
2000.99-929,1,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,2281.662,2281.975,No.
2000.99-929,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2283.708,2292.674,"But if they said we insist that you call this National Pork Week, I don't know if it's National Pork Week or National Port Week, but regardless, a lot of them come in."
2000.99-929,1,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,2295.579,2299.406,--We are saying if they use the word instruct.
2000.99-929,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2302.607,2304.045,You don't have to reach that in this case?
2000.99-929,1,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,2304.045,2304.389,--No.
2000.99-929,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2328.035,2330.706,"Tell us about party labels, Democrat and Republican?"
2000.99-929,1,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,2330.706,2331.019,Yes.
2000.99-929,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2451.392,2458.889,I take it your First Amendment argument is an alternative argument to the first argument that the state simply lacks the power to do this?
2000.99-929,1,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,2458.889,2459.139,--Yes.
2000.99-929,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2475.725,2478.927,That particular argument wasn't put before Judge Bartlett.
2000.99-929,1,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,2481.645,2483.551,"No, Your Honor."
2000.99-929,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2484.424,2485.596,The election clause was put before--
2000.99-929,1,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,2485.596,2485.94,--Yes.
2000.99-929,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2486.253,2489.345,--He didn't rule... Bartlett didn't rule on that?
2000.99-929,1,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,2489.345,2490.501,"Yes, he did, Your Honor."
2000.99-929,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2499.153,2501.231,Was an issue ever... just a technical point.
2000.99-929,1,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,2512.462,2513.337,"No, Your Honor."
2000.99-929,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2521.41,2528.844,"May I ask before you are finished, is a threshold standing question with respect to the initial Plaintiff here."
2000.99-929,1,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,2541.043,2541.668,Gralike.
2000.99-929,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2555.411,2559.176,I noticed in his affidavit that he is running for the election in 2000.
2000.99-929,1,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,2570.093,2572.328,Two points.
2000.99-929,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2580.231,2581.824,But is that in the affidavit before the Court?
2000.99-929,1,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,2584.73,2598.442,"--It's my representation, but the Court's elections cases make clear that that is not a requirement in the Court's elections cases, and those are the cases that we have cited in our brief at footnote one, I believe in this context."
2000.99-929,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2668.055,2670.1,"Thank you, Mr. Franklin."
2000.99-929,2,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,2708.616,2714.114,"Mr. Chief Justice, that would depend on the meaning of instruct."
2000.99-929,3,31790,james_r_mcadams,,3217.114,3220.754,"Thank you, Your Honor."
2000.99-929,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3341.097,3343.002,"Thank you, Mr. McAdams."
