2011.10-875,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,6.404,"We will hear argument first this morning in Case 10-875, Hall v. United States."
2011.10-875,0,41291,susan_m_freeman,,7.437,14.141,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2011.10-875,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,62.906,66.108,Does it include debts incurred after the filing?
2011.10-875,0,41291,susan_m_freeman,,66.108,73.112,"--From the period -- from the petition filing date until the confirmation of the plan, yes, it does."
2011.10-875,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,76.897,79.016,Debts -- debts that were incurred after that date?
2011.10-875,0,41291,susan_m_freeman,,79.016,79.982,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2011.10-875,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,101.345,103.381,Is that true of State -- you said taxes.
2011.10-875,0,41291,susan_m_freeman,,104.964,108.535,"Yes, Your Honor, it is true of State taxes as well as Federal taxes."
2011.10-875,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,111.903,116.955,We're dealing -- in this -- we're dealing with a capital gains tax on the sale of the farm.
2011.10-875,0,41291,susan_m_freeman,,123.795,126.747,"--Correct, Your Honor, and it did in this particular case."
2011.10-875,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,156.599,159.218,Who would file the State tax return?
2011.10-875,0,41291,susan_m_freeman,,163.42,168.574,The debtor and the estate are one in a -- in a reorganization case.
2011.10-875,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,205.949,208.582,"Counsel, how do you deal with section 346?"
2011.10-875,0,41291,susan_m_freeman,,208.582,215.32,"Section 346, Your Honor, basically makes the State taxes consistent with the Federal taxes."
2011.10-875,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,216.704,234.099,"I read 346(b) to say that, unless the estate is a separate tax entity under the code, that the debtor, not the estate, pays State and local taxes."
2011.10-875,0,41291,susan_m_freeman,,246.99,251.06,"--Justice Sotomayor, I do not think it does, in the sense -- in this sense."
2011.10-875,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,313.05,316.252,"So the debtor is going to pay, and so when this--"
2011.10-875,0,41291,susan_m_freeman,,316.252,316.702,The debtor pays--
2011.10-875,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,316.702,327.358,--says -- whenever the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 provides that no separate taxable estate shall be created in a case concerning a debtor under this title--
2011.10-875,0,41291,susan_m_freeman,,327.358,327.893,--Right.
2011.10-875,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,327.893,330.762,--Chapter 12 doesn't create a separate taxable estate.
2011.10-875,0,41291,susan_m_freeman,,330.762,331.162,Correct.
2011.10-875,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,331.162,340.368,"And that the income, et cetera, shall be taxed to or claimed by the debtor under State or local law."
2011.10-875,0,41291,susan_m_freeman,,340.368,342.068,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2011.10-875,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,352.509,355.877,"This -- this is hard for me to understand, given the last line."
2011.10-875,0,41291,susan_m_freeman,,377.993,383.461,"The debtor pays the taxes, but with estate assets, because those are the only assets that exist."
2011.10-875,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,383.461,386.747,So why -- why would the last sentence be necessary?
2011.10-875,0,41291,susan_m_freeman,,386.747,397.954,"The last sentence, I believe, Your Honor, deals with the partnership, and in a partnership case, just as outside a bankruptcy the partnership files the tax return and the partners individually are the ones who pay the taxes."
2011.10-875,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,422.836,426.804,But it says the estate -- the estate's not liable for the tax imposed on the partners.
2011.10-875,0,41291,susan_m_freeman,,429.073,434.894,--The -- the debtor ultimately is the one who receives a discharge.
2011.10-875,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,484.659,503.121,"What happens in a 12 or 13 case, just your typical case -- and this must arise fairly often -- in year 1, on January 1 the farm or the ship or whatever is the subject goes into Chapter 12 or 13."
2011.10-875,0,41291,susan_m_freeman,,556.356,558.54,"He does get priority in that process, Your Honor."
2011.10-875,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,558.54,558.89,All right.
2011.10-875,0,41291,susan_m_freeman,,565.592,567.194,"Your Honor, it does have that priority."
2011.10-875,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,567.194,574.098,"And if it does, then, of course, the exception that Senator Grassley put in applies to that."
2011.10-875,0,41291,susan_m_freeman,,576.8,577.766,"Yes, Your Honor."
2011.10-875,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,593.142,600.165,"Well, but I mean, your -- it is a question for you, because these things don't go for 2 or 3 years, do they?"
2011.10-875,0,41291,susan_m_freeman,,614.925,632.302,"--Respectfully, Mr. Chief Justice, in Chapter 12 cases often the bankruptcy estate will drag on for 2 or 3 years, and certainly for longer than 1 year, and much longer than a Chapter 13 case, because you do have sales of assets."
2011.10-875,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,655.216,656.585,How long was this -- this one?
2011.10-875,0,41291,susan_m_freeman,,656.585,664.358,"--This case, Your Honor, because of this appeal has lasted from 2005 through today, so a considerable period of time."
2011.10-875,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,767.073,782.233,"The -- what you say to me makes a great deal of sense, but I think one of their stronger arguments is, it may make sense, but unfortunately, even if Senator Grassley and the others wanted it, they didn't do it right technically."
2011.10-875,0,41291,susan_m_freeman,,823.56,824.143,1226?
2011.10-875,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,824.143,824.593,1226.
2011.10-875,0,41291,susan_m_freeman,,824.593,825.21,Uh-huh.
2011.10-875,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,825.21,826.928,It's like an Abbott and Costello movie.
2011.10-875,0,41291,susan_m_freeman,,888.668,897.072,"Your Honor, respectfully, you would cause untold harm because this provision applies in corporate Chapter 11's and in all bankruptcy cases."
2011.10-875,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,906.63,910.082,"No, but I was thinking, so if I do it by reading the word ""claims""--"
2011.10-875,0,41291,susan_m_freeman,,910.082,910.532,--Right.
2011.10-875,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,910.532,916.903,"--in 5 -- in 1226, when it says ""any unpaid claim""--"
2011.10-875,0,41291,susan_m_freeman,,916.903,917.653,Right.
2011.10-875,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,917.653,919.788,--Which is what you want to have include taxes--
2011.10-875,0,41291,susan_m_freeman,,919.788,920.522,And claim--
2011.10-875,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,920.522,934.031,"--to read that word as including both the 507(a) claims, which are in (1)(a), (1)(b), and -- also administrative expenses in (2)."
2011.10-875,0,41291,susan_m_freeman,,935.231,940.785,"--You can, Your Honor, because 101 of the code as right to payment."
2011.10-875,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1006.078,1007.496,But that's -- that's my first question.
2011.10-875,0,41291,susan_m_freeman,,1013.066,1013.683,Right.
2011.10-875,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1013.683,1019.303,And there must be instances where the -- where the debts run up postpetition are pretty big--
2011.10-875,0,41291,susan_m_freeman,,1019.303,1020.203,And--
2011.10-875,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1020.203,1039.217,"--and there isn't enough money to go around and they are going to have to be paid out of future income along with the prepetition debts; and it can be done, but there is a question of priorities; and the government is saying there is no priority -- I think they are saying that -- for a postpetition debt, and -- and you're saying: Oh, but of course there is."
2011.10-875,0,41291,susan_m_freeman,,1044.269,1047.638,--And administrative expenses do get paid in the ordinary course.
2011.10-875,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1048.489,1053.124,"Get paid, if necessary, by assigning priorities?"
2011.10-875,0,41291,susan_m_freeman,,1053.124,1053.541,--Yes.
2011.10-875,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1056.762,1061.48,"And so to look to a Hornbook on -- on bankruptcy law which just tells me what you've just said, I would look where?"
2011.10-875,0,41291,susan_m_freeman,,1061.48,1065.701,We -- we've cited a number of hornbooks that have exactly that provision.
2011.10-875,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1114.849,1132.56,"I'm going to ask the government this, but are you aware of any circuit split or any cases below that have accepted the government's arguments that Chapter 12 involves prepetition debts only and that don't pay administrative expenses postbankruptcy?"
2011.10-875,0,41291,susan_m_freeman,,1132.56,1137.397,There are several cases that have interpreted section 1222(a)(2)(A).
2011.10-875,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1141.582,1142.718,That's a different question.
2011.10-875,0,41291,susan_m_freeman,,1142.718,1143.268,Okay.
2011.10-875,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1143.268,1148.438,The government's now saying that Chapter 12 involves only prepetition claims.
2011.10-875,0,41291,susan_m_freeman,,1148.438,1148.955,Right.
2011.10-875,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1148.955,1155.509,And it's basically by that argument saying it doesn't involve and can't involve administrative expenses.
2011.10-875,0,41291,susan_m_freeman,,1156.875,1158.225,I think that's--
2011.10-875,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1158.225,1168.483,And so I'm asking is -- That's how I read are there any courts that you are aware of below who have been presented with this argument outside of the tax situation who have accepted it?
2011.10-875,0,41291,susan_m_freeman,,1168.483,1169.217,--I--
2011.10-875,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1169.217,1172.602,Who have failed to give priority to administrative expenses?
2011.10-875,0,41291,susan_m_freeman,,1172.602,1174.637,--None outside of this tax situation.
2011.10-875,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1203.073,1204.973,I'm not asking you to defend their position.
2011.10-875,0,41291,susan_m_freeman,,1204.973,1205.49,Okay.
2011.10-875,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1205.49,1210.494,It's just such a broad position that I'm trying to understand if there is a split out there that we are unaware of.
2011.10-875,0,41291,susan_m_freeman,,1210.494,1218.647,"And the problem, Your Honor, is that it does have these broad impacts and none of the courts have really addressed it, and I don't believe that certainly the--"
2011.10-875,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1218.647,1221.865,So can we go back to the issue that gives me trouble?
2011.10-875,0,41291,susan_m_freeman,,1221.865,1222.384,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2011.10-875,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1222.384,1225.184,"How to read ""incurred by the estate""."
2011.10-875,0,41291,susan_m_freeman,,1228.019,1229.521,To incur--
2011.10-875,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1229.521,1237.561,"--how could it be incurred by the estate when Congress, if it intended what you're saying it intended, could have said ""incurred during bankruptcy""?"
2011.10-875,0,41291,susan_m_freeman,,1237.561,1241.196,--Incurred -- to incur is to take on liability.
2011.10-875,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1268.48,1289.309,"The -- the problem is that, with an exception that -- that is not applicable here, section 1399 of the Internal Revenue Code provides that no separate taxable entity shall result from the commencement of a case under Title XI of the United States Code."
2011.10-875,0,41291,susan_m_freeman,,1296.38,1301.367,"--Your Honor, because you are a single taxable entity instead of a separate taxable entity."
2011.10-875,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1336.957,1342.528,"But if that exception were intended, the provision I read contains an exception."
2011.10-875,0,41291,susan_m_freeman,,1354.936,1356.019,--That's--
2011.10-875,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1356.019,1363.442,"Now, if there is an additional exception for Chapter 12 of the sort that you allege, why wasn't that put in there?"
2011.10-875,0,41291,susan_m_freeman,,1363.442,1366.644,"--There is no exception and there shouldn't be an exception, Your Honor."
2011.10-875,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1384.355,1388.723,"What does it mean, then, to say that no taxable --"
2011.10-875,0,41291,susan_m_freeman,,1397.06,1401.381,"--Your Honor, respectfully, there is a difference between taxable entity and estate."
2011.10-875,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1411.92,1427.948,"Well, but they -- but they would not have needed the exceptions for Chapter 7 and Chapter 11 where the debtor is an individual if what you say is true, if indeed a bankrupt estate is, as you say, not an entity at all."
2011.10-875,0,41291,susan_m_freeman,,1427.948,1440.089,"You need that exception, Your Honor, in a Chapter 7 case for an individual because the individual earns income that is wholly independent from the estate, that is not part of the estate."
2011.10-875,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1510.816,1516.736,"But, Ms. Freeman, wouldn't it be fair to say then that the taxes are incurred by the debtor and payable out of the estate."
2011.10-875,0,41291,susan_m_freeman,,1520.021,1537.217,"It uses the term ""incurred by the estate"" I think based upon the same kind of language that this Court used in Nicholas, as incurred by, incurred during the administration period, incurred by the debtor-in-possession."
2011.10-875,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1587.649,1607.694,"The argument is made against your position that 1305 is one of the provisions that was featured I think both in the Ninth Circuit and the Tenth Circuit, and their position seems to be that 1305 gives the government an election."
2011.10-875,0,41291,susan_m_freeman,,1607.694,1611.181,"--It does, Your Honor, provide for an election for the government."
2011.10-875,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1673.855,1674.338,"Thank you, Ms. Freeman."
2011.10-875,0,41291,susan_m_freeman,,1674.338,1674.821,Thank you.
2011.10-875,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1674.821,1680.409,Mr. Shah.
2011.10-875,1,38316,pratik_shah,,1680.409,1683.777,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2011.10-875,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1731.192,1733.544,So what -- what farm sales would be included?
2011.10-875,1,38316,pratik_shah,,1739.53,1743.582,"Your Honor, it would be prepetition sales."
2011.10-875,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1759.361,1783.159,"Does that make sense, though, in terms of if you are talking about farmers and fishermen and you are talking about the treatment of their central asset, whether it's the farm or typically the boat, and they either want to try -- they want to try to save the farm or the boat, and they go into bankruptcy and the big issue is how that asset's going to be treated and your position is it's not in the bankruptcy at all, it's outside of it."
2011.10-875,1,38316,pratik_shah,,1786.361,1787.961,"Well, Your Honor, two points."
2011.10-875,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1834.156,1841.31,"Yes, but also I gather it's a fairly typical situation where you have farmers that might want to sell part of the farm."
2011.10-875,1,38316,pratik_shah,,1855.154,1864.343,"Well, Your Honor, it certainly happens within the bankruptcy, and I'm not disputing your point that that may -- that may arise in a bankruptcy case just like it arises in this case."
2011.10-875,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1873.782,1876.65,But that's a big deal if you're deciding how the plan's going to work.
2011.10-875,1,38316,pratik_shah,,1887.125,1890.077,"--Your Honor, we are not asking, to be clear, to pretend that that's not there."
2011.10-875,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1920.178,1940.407,"But there's every reason to think, Mr. Shah, that what Congress was worried about here was cases in which the bankruptcy plan would not be approved at all because there were very high capital gains taxes that would result from a sale; and that that was the problem that everybody was focused on, was making sure that farmers could take advantage of section 12."
2011.10-875,1,38316,pratik_shah,,1954.566,1955.0,Sure.
2011.10-875,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1991.256,1992.039,It's not just Senator Grassley.
2011.10-875,1,38316,pratik_shah,,2023.144,2025.177,"--A couple of responses, Your Honor."
2011.10-875,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2122.639,2124.425,How about employment tax?
2011.10-875,1,38316,pratik_shah,,2126.141,2131.026,"Your Honor, employment taxes Now, as a matter arguably could be treated differently."
2011.10-875,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2155.657,2157.324,Just following up on that--
2011.10-875,1,38316,pratik_shah,,2157.324,2157.926,Yes.
2011.10-875,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2157.926,2163.228,"--I'm looking for what I call past practice, where there must be a lot--"
2011.10-875,1,38316,pratik_shah,,2163.228,2163.747,Yes.
2011.10-875,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2163.747,2164.897,--that would shed some light on this.
2011.10-875,1,38316,pratik_shah,,2178.34,2178.923,Yes.
2011.10-875,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2178.923,2182.792,It talks about administrative expenses incurred by the estate.
2011.10-875,1,38316,pratik_shah,,2182.792,2183.559,"Yes, Your Honor."
2011.10-875,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2183.559,2187.196,So you are saying here are three people who incurred their own taxes.
2011.10-875,1,38316,pratik_shah,,2196.884,2197.518,Ah--
2011.10-875,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2197.518,2198.651,At least that's my--
2011.10-875,1,38316,pratik_shah,,2198.651,2199.086,--Yes.
2011.10-875,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2199.47,2205.907,"--So we have three categories of people that -- where the taxes literally taken, they incur postpetition taxes."
2011.10-875,1,38316,pratik_shah,,2264.696,2266.229,I think so.
2011.10-875,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2282.138,2282.54,No.
2011.10-875,1,38316,pratik_shah,,2294.965,2295.598,--Okay.
2011.10-875,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2333.704,2334.139,Okay.
2011.10-875,1,38316,pratik_shah,,2334.139,2335.706,So the plan won't be confirmed at all.
2011.10-875,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2343.245,2348.983,"Could you turn back to -- before you answer my other question, could you finish your thought about what you are doing with wages?"
2011.10-875,1,38316,pratik_shah,,2363.492,2363.992,Right.
2011.10-875,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2404.533,2408.604,"How does that work, Mr. Shah, because this is the part of your argument that I have to say sort of tripped me up."
2011.10-875,1,38316,pratik_shah,,2408.604,2409.004,Okay.
2011.10-875,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2409.004,2424.281,Because you define 2 years and 4 years after the phrase that you are trying to define.
2011.10-875,1,38316,pratik_shah,,2424.281,2424.731,Sure.
2011.10-875,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2424.731,2427.247,So it must have been a very pressured Congress.
2011.10-875,1,38316,pratik_shah,,2427.247,2439.055,"Well, Your Honor it was a pressured Congress, because in the legislative history that we site, they say -- and it's not true that all of the accurate -- separate tax entity, these rules weren't implemented until afterwards."
2011.10-875,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2476.994,2490.052,"But you are saying that as of 1978 there was kind of an idea in people's heads about this separate tax entity or at least in some people's heads, but that idea had never been converted into any statutory language."
2011.10-875,1,38316,pratik_shah,,2500.323,2508.346,"--It's not simply taking out of their head, Your Honor, its Section 346 rules which are parallel and apply to state and local taxes, those didn't come out of nowhere."
2011.10-875,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2575.222,2576.322,Can I ask another question--
2011.10-875,1,38316,pratik_shah,,2576.322,2576.758,--Sure.
2011.10-875,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2576.758,2583.327,"--while we are on this, because the 1398, 1399 would suggest that we are looking to this separate taxable entity."
2011.10-875,1,38316,pratik_shah,,2600.67,2601.789,"No, Your Honor."
2011.10-875,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2704.67,2705.487,How would it show up?
2011.10-875,1,38316,pratik_shah,,2721.68,2722.215,Sure.
2011.10-875,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2731.988,2732.355,No.
2011.10-875,1,38316,pratik_shah,,2734.273,2735.773,"--Oh, That they're treated differently?"
2011.10-875,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2735.773,2736.107,--Yes.
2011.10-875,1,38316,pratik_shah,,2736.107,2736.975,Through the code.
2011.10-875,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2748.866,2750.032,Let's imagine you are absolutely right.
2011.10-875,1,38316,pratik_shah,,2752.401,2752.918,--Yes.
2011.10-875,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2752.918,2759.972,They mean to treat the postpetition tax obligation to the Federal Government not as an administrative expense.
2011.10-875,1,38316,pratik_shah,,2773.148,2773.765,Yes.
2011.10-875,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2773.765,2780.986,"Therefore, what difference does it make whether you do or whether you don't treat them as administrative expenses?"
2011.10-875,1,38316,pratik_shah,,2782.554,2783.054,Sure.
2011.10-875,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2830.384,2833.62,"Well, it's certainly not a self-denying position now, right?"
2011.10-875,1,38316,pratik_shah,,2855.802,2857.236,"--Your Honor, that -- that's just not true."
2011.10-875,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2869.728,2870.911,"No, I'm talking about the position you are taking now."
2011.10-875,1,38316,pratik_shah,,2871.928,2872.68,--We have maintained our--
2011.10-875,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2872.68,2881.453,"--different treatment of these taxes as to whether or not they are administrative expenses -- not solely, but it leads to the result that you get the money first either way."
2011.10-875,1,38316,pratik_shah,,2881.453,2884.988,--Because Congress -- the government has stayed consistent in its position.
2011.10-875,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2888.857,2899.665,"Well, but then you're saying that Congress changed the rules in a way that, as Justice Alito's question suggested, really doesn't do much at all, when what they wanted to do was provide some real protection for farmers and fishermen."
2011.10-875,1,38316,pratik_shah,,2899.665,2901.731,--I can't speak to what Congress wanted to do.
2011.10-875,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2906.485,2907.852,What would be -- what would be the right way?
2011.10-875,1,38316,pratik_shah,,2907.852,2916.257,"--You could easily enact a separate provision within 1222 that said -- something like -- use the language something like section 1305, that said"
2011.10-875,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3010.219,3010.986,Why would that be a problem?
2011.10-875,1,38316,pratik_shah,,3024.996,3025.646,--It -- yes.
2011.10-875,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3025.646,3028.181,--by trying to show us that it would be a significant practical problem.
2011.10-875,1,38316,pratik_shah,,3028.181,3032.299,I said it would be a significant disruption to the intended operation of Chapter 13.
2011.10-875,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3042.405,3049.409,So it just does automatically for the government what is now done by -- by some kind of government filing?
2011.10-875,1,38316,pratik_shah,,3049.409,3060.032,"--Well -- well, not even that, Your Honor, because under 13 -- the reason why 1305(a)(1) would be dead letter -- you could just rip that page out of the code and throw it away if you accept Petitioner's reading."
2011.10-875,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3092.004,3096.722,"But those are -- those are small potatoes compared to the sale of a farm and a boat, right?"
2011.10-875,1,38316,pratik_shah,,3096.722,3097.324,--I would -- I would--
2011.10-875,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3097.324,3106.263,This particular issue of large capital gains from sale of significant assets doesn't typically arise in the Chapter 13 cases.
2011.10-875,1,38316,pratik_shah,,3106.263,3112.667,"--Sure, the capital gains tax wouldn't, but there's all sorts of postpetition income taxes that would arise in a Chapter 13 case."
2011.10-875,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3125.642,3130.713,"Well, in Chapter -- Chapter 13 cases are the ones that you -- that are typically resolved very quickly, right?"
2011.10-875,1,38316,pratik_shah,,3130.713,3138.366,"Your Honor, it is true that -- from the statistics that I have seen on average, we are talking about 4 months in a Chapter 13 case."
2011.10-875,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3206.093,3220.852,"Counsel, before you finish, could you answer my question of what impact your broader reading -- your Chapter 12 affects only prepetition debts -- what else is that kind of holding going to affect?"
2011.10-875,1,38316,pratik_shah,,3231.308,3235.076,I -- I don't think it would have any adverse effects.
2011.10-875,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3239.914,3240.68,Yes?
2011.10-875,1,38316,pratik_shah,,3240.68,3242.016,--are still going to be paid up front.
2011.10-875,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3395.147,3399.699,The problem with that argument is that the two are used interchangeably by everyone.
2011.10-875,1,38316,pratik_shah,,3401.734,3402.567,"Yes, Your Honor."
2011.10-875,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3402.567,3415.227,"--The government in many situations, given the broad definition of ""claims"", the only logical conclusion is that it includes a subset, a liability created by administrative expenses."
2011.10-875,1,38316,pratik_shah,,3415.227,3427.784,"Your Honor, and if you are only construing that language in isolation, if it only said claim in 507(a)(2) and 1226(b)(1) didn't exist, I would be in full agreement with you that you would read it to being claim and administrative expenses."
2011.10-875,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3476.132,3477.734,"Thank you, Mr. Shah."
2011.10-875,2,41291,susan_m_freeman,,3479.753,3491.125,"Your Honor, one of the first things that Mr. Shah said was that the debtor should have set aside $29,000 from the sale proceeds to pay the taxes."
2011.10-875,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3634.836,3635.836,"Thank you, counsel."
2011.10-875,2,41291,susan_m_freeman,,3636.705,3637.155,Thank you.
