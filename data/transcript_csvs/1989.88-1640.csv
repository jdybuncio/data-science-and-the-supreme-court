1989.88-1640,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,14.224,"We'll hear argument next in Number 88-1640, Michigan Citizens for an Independent Press v. Dick Thornburgh, Attorney General of the United States."
1989.88-1640,0,46316,william_b_schultz,,25.531,29.769,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.88-1640,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,147.846,155.016,"Mr. Schultz, we review this under an arbitrary and capricious standard?"
1989.88-1640,0,46316,william_b_schultz,,155.016,159.57,"Your Honor, the factual issues would be reviewed under an arbitrary and capricious standard."
1989.88-1640,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,160.604,168.843,"So when we're talking about facts are established by record, we're not quite in the same ball park as if you're appealing from a jury verdict or findings of a court."
1989.88-1640,0,46316,william_b_schultz,,168.843,172.378,"--Well, and these are facts about which I don't believe there is dispute."
1989.88-1640,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,173.612,182.168,"Well, but the overall standard of review is arbitrary and capricious, not supported by substantial record... evidence considered on the record as a whole."
1989.88-1640,0,46316,william_b_schultz,,182.168,182.684,--That's correct.
1989.88-1640,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,184.436,191.006,So you... you have a much greater burden to... to upset a determination here where you're just under the arbitrary and capricious standard.
1989.88-1640,0,46316,william_b_schultz,,191.006,193.089,--Or otherwise not in violation of law.
1989.88-1640,1,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,1666.71,1668.826,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.88-1640,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1723.129,1728.95,"Mr. Merrill, it is true, though, that the Attorney General did accept all the factual findings of the ALJ, did he not?"
1989.88-1640,1,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,1728.95,1733.068,"I... I think that that's not a fair inference, Justice Stevens."
1989.88-1640,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1733.068,1734.552,"He said so in so many words, didn't he?"
1989.88-1640,1,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,1734.552,1746.412,"He said that he... he said in the conclusion of his decision, there's one sentence that says that he accepts the fact findings as accurate, but that he has differed with the conclusions reached by the ALJ."
1989.88-1640,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1752.481,1752.881,I understand.
1989.88-1640,1,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,1760.135,1766.806,"--I would think that if the Attorney General had adopted the findings of the ALJ, that then perhaps you should stop with the ALJ's findings."
1989.88-1640,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1799.546,1805.014,"When you say a witness is not telling... I don't credit a witness, is that an inference or is that a fact?"
1989.88-1640,1,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,1805.014,1808.049,--This was... are you referring specifically now to the question about the Gannett--
1989.88-1640,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1808.049,1814.703,The testimony of the... the Gannett executive who says they will maintain the low prices until they drive the competitor out of business.
1989.88-1640,1,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,1814.703,1814.986,--Right.
1989.88-1640,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1825.843,1826.893,He just thought it was highly improbable?
1989.88-1640,1,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,1826.893,1835.466,--whether for some reason he... he disagreed with it basically because he thought as a matter of economic theory that what the CEO of Gannett was testifying to was improbable.
1989.88-1640,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1856.863,1859.065,Is it your view we should accept that testimony?
1989.88-1640,1,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,1859.065,1865.653,I think that that testimony is simply one of several factors that the Attorney General was relying upon--
1989.88-1640,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1865.653,1866.769,That's not my question.
1989.88-1640,1,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,1883.764,1887.482,--I don't... I do not think that the Court either needs to accept or not accept that testimony as true--
1989.88-1640,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1887.482,1892.536,What is the position of the government as to the truth or falsity of that testimony?
1989.88-1640,1,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,1892.536,1901.392,--Our position is that the... the testimony is entirely consistent with what this record in this case and what Congress found about the economics of the newspaper industry.
1989.88-1640,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1901.392,1913.366,"And if that testimony is the truth and if that program were carried out after a JOA were turned down, would that be lawful or unlawful conduct in the opinion of the United States?"
1989.88-1640,1,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,1913.366,1918.437,The claim has been made here that somehow it would constitute predatory pricing.
1989.88-1640,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1920.305,1921.805,I'd like an answer to the question.
1989.88-1640,1,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,1921.805,1922.272,Hm?
1989.88-1640,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1922.272,1923.257,I'd like an answer to the question.
1989.88-1640,1,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,1923.257,1924.424,I will try to answer the question.
1989.88-1640,2,46316,william_b_schultz,,3325.756,3326.339,Yes.
1989.88-1640,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3432.189,3433.289,"Thank you, Mr. Schultz."
