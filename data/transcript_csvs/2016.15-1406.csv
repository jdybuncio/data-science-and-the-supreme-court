2016.15-1406,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,6.56,We'll hear argument next in case 15-1406 Goodyear v. Haeger. Mr. Bergeron?
2016.15-1406,0,37712,pierre_h_bergeron,,6.56,21.71,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: A direct causation standard is necessary in light of the historic restrictions on a court's inherent authority, and it provides courts with a workable framework that they customarily apply in the sanctions context."
2016.15-1406,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,59.99,89.565,How do you -- am I to take that your -- I think what I read from your brief is that we should draw the line that we drew in Bagli between compensatory damages under the contempt inherent power and punishment damages that require criminal civil procedures. Is that the same thing you're asking us to --
2016.15-1406,0,37712,pierre_h_bergeron,,89.565,91.41,Yes. That's essentially the same thing.
2016.15-1406,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,91.41,93.365,So how do you deal with Chambers?
2016.15-1406,0,37712,pierre_h_bergeron,,93.365,95.49,So we deal with Chambers a couple of different ways.
2016.15-1406,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,114.19,122.485,"Wasn't, that wasn't that what was found here was that it was pervasive from the very first effort to get discovery continuing through the settlement?"
2016.15-1406,0,37712,pierre_h_bergeron,,122.485,124.66,"No, Justice Ginsburg."
2016.15-1406,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,152.245,181.805,"But weren't you given the opportunity -- maybe you can clarify this -- the -- the Court said, well, if we're wrong about giving all of the counsel fees, then we will deduct -- what? -- some $700,000 based on Goodyear's filing of the amount that should not be recovered because it was unrelated to Goodyear's bad conduct."
2016.15-1406,0,37712,pierre_h_bergeron,,181.805,182.63,Correct.
2016.15-1406,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,203.705,214.265,And you represented that that was the cost that was not attributable to Goodyear's misconduct.
2016.15-1406,0,37712,pierre_h_bergeron,,214.265,223.55,"What we represented was that it was related to the medical costs, the medical damages -- proven up the medical damages, as well as pursuit of the other defendants."
2016.15-1406,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,243.805,247.59,"Well, your test is the direct directness of the causation."
2016.15-1406,0,37712,pierre_h_bergeron,,260.72,260.83,Right.
2016.15-1406,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,260.83,262.055,-- dramatic or compelling.
2016.15-1406,0,37712,pierre_h_bergeron,,262.055,262.315,Right.
2016.15-1406,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,262.315,271.59,"And they have to go through all sorts of -- they're preparing somebody to testify about this other test, and they incur $100,000 in expenses to do that."
2016.15-1406,0,37712,pierre_h_bergeron,,277.05,279.22,I think there's a couple of different ways you can look at it.
2016.15-1406,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,289.795,290.76,"Well, let's say they're not."
2016.15-1406,0,37712,pierre_h_bergeron,,296.56,317.18,"I think there certainly could be situations where -- where the proponent of fees would say, we would not have taken this deposition if we had had this document, for instance, and then that would -- that could be something that they would then recover for. I think generally what you're looking at is -- is the incremental costs going above a baseline. And that's --"
2016.15-1406,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,317.18,321.635,That's always a guess-estimate to start with.
2016.15-1406,0,37712,pierre_h_bergeron,,356.85,360.32,"Well, we think that they could recover for that expert."
2016.15-1406,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,365.89,377.625,"No, but they -- they -- the district court asked you to tell them what you thought wasn't caused, assuming that you accepted the district court's findings."
2016.15-1406,0,37712,pierre_h_bergeron,,377.625,382.92,"Well, in fairness, the district court told us we -- we were not going to be able to do that."
2016.15-1406,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,395.35,400.535,"Well, to be precise about that, what were you asked by the district judge to submit?"
2016.15-1406,0,37712,pierre_h_bergeron,,400.535,414.14,"So what happened was before the district court issued its November 2012 order, we had raised -- they -- they had requested all sorts of remedies for sanctions, and we had raised the causation point, the causation limitation."
2016.15-1406,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,439.95,479.5,"So why isn't it appropriate, given that the plaintiff was put to a great expense and probably got less in the settlement than they would have gotten if Goodyear had lived up to its discovery responsibilities, why isn't it appropriate to say instead of making the plaintiff prove every single item that's attributable to the discovery fault, it should be the defendant's expert to point out what -- what items were not attributable?"
2016.15-1406,0,37712,pierre_h_bergeron,,479.5,482.86,I think there's both a practical and a legal answer to that.
2016.15-1406,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,534.945,544.96,"Mr. Bergeron, could I go back to the question that the Chief Justice asked you. You said that you favored the approach of Fox v. Vice, which is a but-for test."
2016.15-1406,0,37712,pierre_h_bergeron,,544.96,545.23,Right.
2016.15-1406,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,545.23,548.44,It's would you have incurred this cost anyway even --
2016.15-1406,0,37712,pierre_h_bergeron,,548.44,548.53,Right.
2016.15-1406,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,548.53,563.85,"-- without the misconduct. But Fox v. Vice never uses this language of directness, which seems to me actually much more in line with proximate cause inquiries. Now, Fox v. Vice, you know, never addressed proximate cause either way."
2016.15-1406,0,37712,pierre_h_bergeron,,585.46,593.645,"We borrowed ""direct"" from Cooter & Gell and from the other sanction regimes that all have various iterations of what I call direct causation."
2016.15-1406,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,637.495,644.745,"Well, suppose we say that the Fox v. Vice but-for test is something along the lines of what we should be applying here."
2016.15-1406,0,37712,pierre_h_bergeron,,678.71,691.31,"We think that that is just far too speculative to satisfy a direct causation test. And, obviously, in this case, it really illustrates the point, because the district court said, I'm pointing to Goodyear's experience in other cases."
2016.15-1406,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,697.58,699.89,"Well, I don't know what -- what -- too speculative."
2016.15-1406,0,37712,pierre_h_bergeron,,725.375,738.33,"But we think the problem with that is it ends up being a shortcut for causation. And -- and the Court, then, is excused from the performance of the task of actually looking at what the misconduct was and how that impacted the fees incurred."
2016.15-1406,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,738.33,766.83,"I think it's pretty easy to think of hypotheticals and how they might be unrealistic, in which the eventual disclosure of some piece of information that should have been disclosed a lot earlier is so fatal to the defense that the case would be settled as soon as that came to light. You think it's impossible to imagine something like that? Suppose there were some internal Goodyear document here that said, you know, we are going to sell this."
2016.15-1406,0,37712,pierre_h_bergeron,,787.715,790.12,And I can certainly imagine such a document.
2016.15-1406,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,827.57,841.57,"Yes, but if a lack of certainty like that is going to prevent a judge from actually making an award, then people on the other side, people who are victimized, are going to be undercompensated in case after case after case."
2016.15-1406,0,37712,pierre_h_bergeron,,841.57,860.8,"But I don't think that that's the case here because, obviously, if a direct causation test is applied and they get the incremental cost that they would have received in the absence of the misconduct, then they received the appropriate compensatory award and it satisfies the due process concerns."
2016.15-1406,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,860.8,865.335,Justice Sotomayor asked you at the outset about the Chambers cases.
2016.15-1406,0,37712,pierre_h_bergeron,,878.875,879.995,Right.
2016.15-1406,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,886.5,887.5,"No, it wasn't."
2016.15-1406,0,37712,pierre_h_bergeron,,890.255,905.95,"Well, because what Chambers was recognizing was it did acknowledge that all of the fees were caused by the misconduct, and it did point out that the entirety of the case was built on a fraud, and there was no good faith defense to the litigation."
2016.15-1406,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,940.71,954.47,Am I to understand the question presented -- as presented was whether there is a direct causation standard applicable to an award under a court's inherent powers.
2016.15-1406,0,37712,pierre_h_bergeron,,981.34,984.7,The district court would be reviewed under abuse of discretion.
2016.15-1406,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,999.4,1011.04,"When the district court gave these two awards, the 2.7 and the 2 million, do you understand that to have been 2.7 if I'm not bound by a cause requirement; 2 million if I am?"
2016.15-1406,0,37712,pierre_h_bergeron,,1011.04,1013.64,"I think that's how the court envisioned it, yes, Justice Kagan."
2016.15-1406,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1013.64,1025.135,"So then why hasn't that been done already in the district court? In other words, if you're right, that there is a causation requirement here, we send it back to the district court, hasn't the district court already performed that calculation?"
2016.15-1406,0,37712,pierre_h_bergeron,,1025.135,1027.65,I think that would be what the Respondents would say.
2016.15-1406,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1057.79,1064.46,"What's the difference between the 2 million and the 2.7? What is the $700,000 in there; costs for what?"
2016.15-1406,0,37712,pierre_h_bergeron,,1064.46,1073.28,"The $700,000 represented the fees incurred in pursuit of the other defendants, because there were two other defendants in the underlying litigation besides Goodyear."
2016.15-1406,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1085.065,1100.14,"When you gave this figure to the district court you said, in your submission, ""Goodyear reviewed plaintiffs' billing entries and created a category of cost."" I'm quoting you."
2016.15-1406,0,37712,pierre_h_bergeron,,1114.985,1117.08,And I understand that.
2016.15-1406,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1180.32,1183.51,What costs do you concede you're responsible for?
2016.15-1406,0,37712,pierre_h_bergeron,,1183.51,1189.105,We would concede we are responsible for the direct harm flowing from the misconduct that the district court found.
2016.15-1406,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1214.65,1215.795,So how much is that?
2016.15-1406,0,37712,pierre_h_bergeron,,1215.795,1218.18,"I don't have a number for you, Justice Kagan."
2016.15-1406,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1218.18,1220.39,But that's not anything like the full 2 million?
2016.15-1406,0,37712,pierre_h_bergeron,,1220.39,1221.065,It's not.
2016.15-1406,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1246.23,1251.25,"You said you wanted to use the Fox v. Vice standard, and part of that is the but-for causation inquiry."
2016.15-1406,0,37712,pierre_h_bergeron,,1260.06,1260.64,Right.
2016.15-1406,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1260.64,1264.85,"To go over each, you know, hour of an attorney's work."
2016.15-1406,0,37712,pierre_h_bergeron,,1273.86,1274.745,We do.
2016.15-1406,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1300.96,1311.645,"What do you -- what do you do then with the plaintiff's position that this case would have settled much earlier, which the district judge accepted?"
2016.15-1406,0,37712,pierre_h_bergeron,,1311.645,1327.08,"And we would say that that's an inappropriate basis for the reasons I said earlier, an inappropriate basis as a substitute for causation. Allowing the court to use a cutoff date and just sweep everything going forward would be inappropriate."
2016.15-1406,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1336.21,1341.56,Suppose there was a finding made in another case that the case would have settled much earlier.
2016.15-1406,0,37712,pierre_h_bergeron,,1342.365,1386.61,"Then I would go back to my first point which is that's an inappropriate basis upon which to obviate the need for causation, that the Court should not be getting into a temporal line drawing in terms of how we determine what fees may or may not have been caused by misconduct. Instead, it would be looking at, you know, what are the categories that were caused by the misconduct and making those calculations going forward. But -- but once you start -- once you sanction the ability to just draw a temporal line in the sand, then I think that makes it too easy for courts to avoid, actually, the -- the hard work sometimes -- some cases can be easy -- but the harder work of going through and looking at the -- the ultimate time entries."
2016.15-1406,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1386.61,1411.1,"Well, if you're not -- and I -- I thought you admitted earlier that it wouldn't be appropriate for us to say that could never happen, or maybe I misunderstood your answer. But suppose we think that there could be circumstances in which a court could say this would have settled based on the fatal nature of the disclosure. This would have settled sooner, had it been properly disclosed."
2016.15-1406,0,37712,pierre_h_bergeron,,1425.455,1435.15,"Well, and that's why I go kind of with my -- with my first point, which is we shouldn't be -- once you start going down -- once you open the door to that, I think there is a problem on the application."
2016.15-1406,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1440.2,1440.8,Is it odd that the --
2016.15-1406,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1440.8,1446.07,"In other words, the more egregious the -- the -- the violation the harder it is to show causation."
2016.15-1406,0,37712,pierre_h_bergeron,,1447.1,1449.09,"Well, no, Justice Kennedy, I disagree."
2016.15-1406,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1493.18,1512.055,"But -- but, Mr. Bergeron, you're saying well, you should use a causation test, but you can't ever consider the likelihood of settlement. But the likelihood of settlement might be -- might not be here, but might be in another case, quite relevant to the question of what fees have been caused by the misconduct."
2016.15-1406,0,37712,pierre_h_bergeron,,1512.055,1518.625,"It -- and I -- so what I would say to that is yes, you could envision a case where that might happen."
2016.15-1406,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1532.095,1539.55,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Egbert."
2016.15-1406,1,62792,john_j_egbert,,1539.55,1554.655,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The district court and the Ninth Circuit in this case both acknowledge that there needs to be a causal link between the sanction misconduct and the fees and costs awarded as sanctions."
2016.15-1406,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1563.595,1571.555,How does it -- what is the causation link between their misconduct and the fees incurred with respect to other defendants?
2016.15-1406,1,62792,john_j_egbert,,1571.555,1598.775,"Well, one thing is -- well, there's -- there is two answers to that, Your Honor. One is that, on a very simple level, if we had the very strong evidence of the -- that was concealed here that showed that the tire was defective, and -- because of the -- the Heat Rise test and that evidence, that it may have been that we would not have needed to go against any of the -- the other defendants at all."
2016.15-1406,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1598.775,1614.91,"Well, but I mean the -- as I understand it, the allegations with respect to the other defendants did not have relationship to the Heat Rise test, and if -- if -- or -- if that's the case, you're saying well, we would have gotten enough money from Goodyear; we wouldn't have cared about the money from the others?"
2016.15-1406,1,62792,john_j_egbert,,1614.91,1615.48,"No, Your Honor."
2016.15-1406,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1644.24,1646.63,"Well, is that the standard? It could be possible?"
2016.15-1406,1,62792,john_j_egbert,,1646.63,1654.755,"Well, Your Honor, it -- it's -- the -- the standard is that we are asking district court judges to make factual determinations."
2016.15-1406,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1675.98,1679.56,Did the other defendants contribute to the settlement that was ultimately reached?
2016.15-1406,1,62792,john_j_egbert,,1679.56,1682.84,"Your Honor, I do not believe that to be the case."
2016.15-1406,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1688.12,1694.585,"You -- you just said, I thought, that the Ninth Circuit accepted a causation requirement."
2016.15-1406,1,62792,john_j_egbert,,1695.535,1696.445,"Yes, Your Honor."
2016.15-1406,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1696.445,1699.64,I didn't read the -- the Ninth Circuit opinion that way.
2016.15-1406,1,62792,john_j_egbert,,1740.345,1741.46,"No, no, Your Honor."
2016.15-1406,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1816.01,1816.6,"Well, why did she say --"
2016.15-1406,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1816.6,1821.195,"Judge Watford -- Judge Watford disagrees with your reading of the majority, right?"
2016.15-1406,1,62792,john_j_egbert,,1821.195,1825.245,"I think he does, Your Honor. But here --"
2016.15-1406,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1825.245,1840.245,"Why -- why did the district court set two standards, the 2.7 and the 2.0, if she thought that she was bound by causation? I thought that the -- that the whole idea of those two was, one was, if I'm bound by a causation requirement and one was if I'm not."
2016.15-1406,1,62792,john_j_egbert,,1840.245,1840.89,"No, Your Honor."
2016.15-1406,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1912.72,1915.55,"The Ninth Circuit did not hold that there was a waiver, did it?"
2016.15-1406,1,62792,john_j_egbert,,1915.55,1916.35,It did not.
2016.15-1406,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1921.109,1927.99,You said you were going to respond to Justice Alito's statements from the Ninth Circuit.
2016.15-1406,1,62792,john_j_egbert,,1961.13,1964.35,"Well, I -- I disagree respectfully, Your Honor."
2016.15-1406,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2125.79,2135.625,What do you do with Judge Watford who said that that finding that it would have settled much earlier is not supported by the record?
2016.15-1406,1,62792,john_j_egbert,,2135.625,2170.84,"Well, the -- his main criticism, Your Honor, was that there were other cases in which the tests were disclosed and they didn't settle. But here's the important point, and this is undisputed: Judge Silver specifically found -- the district court judge specifically found that unlike in our case where we had an expert that said -- admitted -- Goodyear's own internal expert admitted that anything above 200 degrees would cause problems for the tire, cause separation, they didn't have that evidence in those other cases."
2016.15-1406,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2180.59,2187.37,Could you describe for me your definition of direct causation or causation?
2016.15-1406,1,62792,john_j_egbert,,2187.37,2188.19,"Causation, Your Honor."
2016.15-1406,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2189.09,2189.98,Give me a definition.
2016.15-1406,1,62792,john_j_egbert,,2189.98,2195.3,The causation is that it has to be the result of or caused by.
2016.15-1406,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2206.21,2213.29,"How is it different than Fox, than the definition and the words Fox used?"
2016.15-1406,1,62792,john_j_egbert,,2213.29,2216.335,"Well, I think it's -- I think it's a very similar concept."
2016.15-1406,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2216.335,2227.755,"But why? Why get into 19 different meanings of ""cause"" in the law? I mean, proximate cause is normally defined as a but-for condition and foreseeable."
2016.15-1406,1,62792,john_j_egbert,,2227.755,2229.01,"And -- and, Your Honor --"
2016.15-1406,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2229.01,2232.34,And if we start having -- why should we have some other definition here?
2016.15-1406,1,62792,john_j_egbert,,2232.34,2233.57,I -- I agree.
2016.15-1406,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2237.95,2243.055,"Why don't we just say, look, there's an argument here and you look at what the district court said."
2016.15-1406,1,62792,john_j_egbert,,2261.2,2283.33,"Your Honor, to begin with, whether or not we -- we need to make a clarification with respect to cause generally is a separate issue. But in this case, we submit there's no basis for remanding to the trial court for any further consideration because she already took their causation argument at full face value and adopted 100 percent of their argument and entered the contingent award."
2016.15-1406,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2283.33,2284.975,"Can we go back to the Ninth Circuit, too?"
2016.15-1406,1,62792,john_j_egbert,,2284.975,2287.55,"Well, there's no -- there's nothing to be left."
2016.15-1406,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2296.645,2304.675,"Well, but I'm not sure that she, in calculating the $700,000, applied an appropriate proximate cause analysis."
2016.15-1406,1,62792,john_j_egbert,,2326.805,2332.795,"Well, she -- she didn't have to make that determination, Your Honor, because they made the argument."
2016.15-1406,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2336.73,2336.84,Oh.
2016.15-1406,1,62792,john_j_egbert,,2338.15,2338.94,The waiver argument.
2016.15-1406,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2339.21,2343.09,Which was not -- not -- the Ninth Circuit did not rely on the waiver argument.
2016.15-1406,1,62792,john_j_egbert,,2343.09,2351.54,The -- the Ninth Circuit did not address the contingent award at all and so didn't need to get into whether or not there was a waiver.
2016.15-1406,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2387.26,2396.45,"Well, I -- I suppose the idea would be that in an opinion, we would provide greater guidance on exactly what type of analysis is to be applied."
2016.15-1406,1,62792,john_j_egbert,,2414.69,2419.705,"Well, I think it certainly was the application of whatever it was the party was arguing."
2016.15-1406,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2424.225,2425.55,Maybe we don't have to.
2016.15-1406,1,62792,john_j_egbert,,2448.365,2450.04,And then she said --
2016.15-1406,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2450.04,2450.54,What?
2016.15-1406,1,62792,john_j_egbert,,2450.54,2480.695,"-- ultimately, I conclude that the most appropriate award given these circumstances is to award all of the fees and costs incurred. And the reason for that, Your Honor, was because the entire litigation became a sham, because we were litigating a false set of facts and it -- and she said that it permeated every aspect of the litigation. Those facts aren't -- those findings are subject to great deference and we -- we ought to be deferring to that -- those findings."
2016.15-1406,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2488.61,2514.33,"Well, but you say it was a sham, but I -- and maybe you disagree, but Goodyear in its -- in its reply brief, details the good-faith defenses it had that were unrelated to the Heat Rise test; in other words, about the cause of the accident, whether other parties were involved, that the tire was already damaged, the -- you know, all sorts of other things, including ones that went to the question of damages, which surely would have been pertinent in whether the case would have settled."
2016.15-1406,1,62792,john_j_egbert,,2514.33,2516.62,And that's Goodyear's version of the facts.
2016.15-1406,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2537.73,2549.94,"Well, and -- and it's hard for me to see how the district court would be in a position, except perhaps in an extraordinary case to -- to make the calculation, oh, the parties would have settled this."
2016.15-1406,1,62792,john_j_egbert,,2582.925,2611.665,"Well, Your Honor, even if we accepted that -- that factual finding by the district court as merely an indication of how critical and crucial this evidence was to the case, then we can apply that to her other findings unrelated to, well, it would have settled immediately. She also found that this misconduct was so pervasive and -- that it permeated every aspect of the litigation."
2016.15-1406,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2618.73,2638.915,"What about -- what about Goodrich's argument that the defect in the tire, all of that was beside the point because the cause of the accident was road debris? Road debris forced this car to swerve off the road."
2016.15-1406,1,62792,john_j_egbert,,2638.915,2640.09,Yes.
2016.15-1406,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2640.09,2646.29,That would have happened even if you had a 100 percent fit tire.
2016.15-1406,1,62792,john_j_egbert,,2646.29,2657.23,"Your Honor, you're -- you're right that they're -- that they make arguments that the district court could have and indeed should have found otherwise."
2016.15-1406,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2716.485,2726.54,"Well, I'm not sure you would call it -- it's not a typical finding of fact to say that based on all of the, you know, issues in terms -- I think the parties would have settled."
2016.15-1406,1,62792,john_j_egbert,,2736.825,2749.035,"Your Honor, I -- I agree that it is an unusual finding, but I do think that it is nevertheless a factual finding."
2016.15-1406,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2771.08,2776.44,"And the one key thing, all of that, we know there has been sham litigation in the world."
2016.15-1406,1,62792,john_j_egbert,,2817.49,2841.33,"Well, Your Honor, that is certainly a possible procedure, but we see no need to even send it back to the Ninth Circuit to further embroil the plaintiffs in what has already been an extraordinary long process. Here, I think that the easiest part of this case is that the -- Goodyear had an opportunity to make its causation argument."
2016.15-1406,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2861.55,2871.155,"Assuming the bad faith that the district court found -- not making a judgment, because that hasn't been proffered before us."
2016.15-1406,1,62792,john_j_egbert,,2879.585,2884.315,"That's -- that's all that it accomplishes from my perspective, Your Honor."
2016.15-1406,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2892.965,2900.23,"But the money -- and this is an award of counsel fees, so the money would go to counsel, not the plaintiff?"
2016.15-1406,1,62792,john_j_egbert,,2900.23,2930.76,"Your Honor, that's -- that's outside the record, but I can tell you that it's -- that's not how it works under the agreement with -- with the client. We would ask the Court to make -- to take very careful look at not only the aspect of the settlement piece of it that Justice Breyer has -- has focused on, but it's also an alternative finding."
2016.15-1406,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2956.89,2966.825,"What does that mean? Is that different from saying that it caused everything? To say that it permeated everything, is that the same thing as saying that it -- it caused everything?"
2016.15-1406,1,62792,john_j_egbert,,2966.825,2969.0,"I -- Your Honor, I -- I think it is."
2016.15-1406,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2998.14,3000.23,"That's the question, then. That's the legal question."
2016.15-1406,1,62792,john_j_egbert,,3045.05,3046.98,"I agree 100 percent, Your Honor, that --"
2016.15-1406,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3046.98,3048.11,"No, but I've asked the question."
2016.15-1406,1,62792,john_j_egbert,,3050.355,3054.86,I stand on the -- the side that says that it does have to be compensatory.
2016.15-1406,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3057.93,3058.335,Okay.
2016.15-1406,1,62792,john_j_egbert,,3058.335,3059.83,There has to be causation.
2016.15-1406,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3140.975,3146.265,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Bergeron, you have four minutes remaining."
2016.15-1406,2,37712,pierre_h_bergeron,,3146.265,3173.45,"Thank you. The district court did not apply the result of or cause by test that Mr. Egbert just articulated. It never went down that path, and the -- what they seem to be arguing in their brief was that there is a distinction between, as Justice Breyer was noting, the truly egregious from the less egregious, which was how the district court tried to draw the line. As we pointed out, that's not an effective way of drawing the line."
2016.15-1406,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3197.94,3199.765,There is something -- I -- I do understand that.
2016.15-1406,2,37712,pierre_h_bergeron,,3253.95,3254.08,Well --
2016.15-1406,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3254.08,3260.67,He used the analogy of you derailed the train to take another route it didn't have to travel.
2016.15-1406,2,37712,pierre_h_bergeron,,3260.67,3261.205,Right.
2016.15-1406,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3261.67,3265.135,So why isn't the travel on that route compensable?
2016.15-1406,2,37712,pierre_h_bergeron,,3265.135,3270.5,"Well, the problem with that, Your Honor, is that was the Ninth Circuit's gloss on what the district court did."
2016.15-1406,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3319.8,3326.66,"She did say more than not. She did say more -- this case, more likely than not, would have settled much earlier."
2016.15-1406,2,37712,pierre_h_bergeron,,3348.485,3352.93,"But, Justice Breyer, we disagree that it is a causation standard."
2016.15-1406,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3369.77,3371.64,You make that an issue below?
2016.15-1406,2,37712,pierre_h_bergeron,,3371.64,3372.99,"Yes, we did."
2016.15-1406,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3430.465,0.0,"Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted."
