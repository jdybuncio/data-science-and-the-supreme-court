2011.10-1293,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,9.189,"We will hear argument next in Case 10-1293, Federal Communications Commission v. Fox Television Stations."
2011.10-1293,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,10.422,12.741,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2011.10-1293,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,64.138,68.69,"But, General Verrilli, it seems to me that this contract notion of yours can only go so far."
2011.10-1293,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,88.603,106.748,"This condition is appropriate, Justice Kagan, because it has been a defining feature of the broadcast medium from its inception in the 1920s in the Radio Act and has continued to be a defining feature of this medium throughout its history."
2011.10-1293,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,127.978,129.663,That's one of their arguments.
2011.10-1293,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,134.381,135.567,"--Yes, that's true."
2011.10-1293,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,135.567,137.4,"That's a separate, really a separate argument."
2011.10-1293,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,137.4,142.921,"That's certainly true, Justice Scalia, and I will certainly get to vagueness, if I -- if I may continue along this line."
2011.10-1293,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,190.752,192.403,I didn't quite understand that.
2011.10-1293,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,204.227,204.611,Yes.
2011.10-1293,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,207.513,208.129,"Yes, I understand that."
2011.10-1293,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,208.529,218.654,And the Respondents are arguing in this case that Pacifica ought to be overruled because the circumstances that justified its rule no longer obtain.
2011.10-1293,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,335.546,364.481,"General Verrilli, I took it from the briefs and what the FCC has been doing that the major objection is that one cannot tell what's indecent and what isn't; that it's FCC, the censor, that's saying NYPD Blue> [""] is not."
2011.10-1293,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,407.924,410.376,"Let me turn to that, Justice Ginsburg."
2011.10-1293,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,557.457,564.876,Could you -- could you digress for one minute to help me understand the procedural posture of this case.
2011.10-1293,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,660.506,671.812,"I do -- I agree with you, Justice Breyer, A, that this is a complex procedural posture; B, that the Court would have some discretion in how it approached and resolved the case."
2011.10-1293,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,703.366,709.603,"But they didn't -- they didn't in that case, and they sent the ABC case back -- I see your--"
2011.10-1293,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,709.603,716.426,"They did on -- when it came back, Your Honor, they then, they disposed of the Fox case with a lengthy opinion and then essentially applied that analysis to the ABC case."
2011.10-1293,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,717.209,717.576,--All right.
2011.10-1293,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,769.727,776.481,"--So, Justice Breyer, I'm not sure that I can vouch for the proposition that the arguments have all been made in front of the commission."
2011.10-1293,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,776.481,779.183,"I'm not saying every one, but has the essence of these arguments--"
2011.10-1293,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,779.183,795.559,"In fairness, I do think that if one reads the commission's disposition of the ABC case, it is applying the 2001 guidance reaching the conclusion that the broadcast was indecent under the 2001 guidance."
2011.10-1293,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,937.737,954.613,"Well, the broader point, General Verrilli, isn't it, is that no matter -- even if you are right that there are many non-vague applications of this commission policy, that there is some amount of uncertainty and ABC finds itself in that area of uncertainty--"
2011.10-1293,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,954.613,954.997,I don't--
2011.10-1293,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,954.997,983.016,"--because it turns out that nudity -- that there really -- sometimes it's allowed as to some body parts and sometimes it's not allowed, and the commission hadn't really said anything about it for 50 years, and the length of time doesn't seem to be what's indicative of anything, the kind of body part doesn't seem to be, with some limits, what is indicative of anything, so that ABC just didn't really know."
2011.10-1293,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,983.016,988.17,"--With respect, Justice Kagan, I really disagree with that characterization of the situation."
2011.10-1293,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1013.968,1025.293,"--Well, I'm not so sure, because the examples were given of I guess excerpts from ""Private Ryan"" and from ""Schindler's List"", have been on television."
2011.10-1293,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1025.293,1027.895,"--Yes, that's true, Justice Ginsburg."
2011.10-1293,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1044.006,1049.074,"They have their own guidelines that generally prohibit it, don't they?"
2011.10-1293,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1049.074,1050.676,"That is certainty true, Justice Scalia."
2011.10-1293,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1082.213,1086.516,"If they did an excerpt from ""Hair"", could they televise that?"
2011.10-1293,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1086.516,1090.151,I think it would raise serious questions.
2011.10-1293,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1094.372,1103.045,"In the opera in the ""Metropolis"" case there's a scene where a woman is seen nude entering a bathtub."
2011.10-1293,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1111.399,1117.553,"--Well, I don't -- I think, Justice Ginsburg, that in a context-based approach, there's not going to be perfect clarity."
2011.10-1293,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1132.062,1143.034,"What -- what you're saying is, is that there is a public value in having a particular segment of the media with different standards than other segments."
2011.10-1293,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1192.634,1195.653,"Two points in response to that, Justice Kennedy."
2011.10-1293,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1222.401,1223.001,"Well, but--"
2011.10-1293,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1223.001,1223.651,But this goes--
2011.10-1293,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1223.651,1226.786,--And then there's -- and then there's the chip that's available.
2011.10-1293,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1226.786,1231.073,"--And of course, you ask your 15-year-old, or your 10-year-old, how to turn off of the chip."
2011.10-1293,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1247.851,1257.29,But -- but is your point is that the chip technology works better if you have this differentiation between broadcast and cable media?
2011.10-1293,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1257.29,1258.357,"No, a different point."
2011.10-1293,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1291.278,1292.213,"Well, in a way, that's circular."
2011.10-1293,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1299.301,1303.353,"Is there -- well, I'm sorry, Justice Kennedy."
2011.10-1293,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1364.842,1375.884,What will happen when -- when we get to the point where -- when there are only a handful of people in the entire country who are still receiving television programs via the airwaves?
2011.10-1293,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1375.884,1380.802,"Well, I do think we're not there now, as we've said in our brief."
2011.10-1293,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1380.802,1382.038,"--We're almost there, right?"
2011.10-1293,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1383.088,1392.427,"But that -- but I think that really makes what I think is one of the most fundamental points here, is that the broadcasters want to have it both ways, right?"
2011.10-1293,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1421.279,1441.51,"Sign -- sign me up as supporting Justice Kennedy's notion that this has a symbolic value, just as we require a certain modicum of dress for the people that attend this Court and the people that attend other Federal courts."
2011.10-1293,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1459.335,1475.081,"--And we certainly agree, Justice Scalia, with the point that was made in the Court's previous decision in this case, that -- for example, the words that are in the Fox broadcast, teachers don't use those words with students."
2011.10-1293,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1478.683,1479.833,"Well, you do more and more."
2011.10-1293,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1484.72,1487.421,--If I think if I may--
2011.10-1293,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1487.421,1494.075,"You are saying that the standard can still be symbolic, as Justice Scalia said."
2011.10-1293,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1521.493,1531.267,"--Justice Ginsburg, something this Court said in its prior decision is right on the mark with respect to this issue, which is it's a question of whether it's portrayed as appropriate."
2011.10-1293,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1546.827,1548.077,"Thank you, General."
2011.10-1293,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1552.097,1554.383,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2011.10-1293,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1576.979,1584.235,"Well, that's because broadcasts didn't commonly have this sort of -- these sorts of words or these sorts of images."
2011.10-1293,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1584.235,1586.302,"Well, maybe, maybe not."
2011.10-1293,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1591.256,1591.956,We know.
2011.10-1293,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1610.0,1624.879,"--The only point I'm trying to make, Chief Justice, is that if you're talking about this as sort of the core understanding between the parties, it simply played a fairly minor role in the process through the bulk of the regulatory period we're talking about."
2011.10-1293,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1641.322,1648.911,"How about this, Mr. Phillips: Look, you've been given a privilege and that gives the government at least somewhat more leeway to impose obligation on you."
2011.10-1293,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1676.245,1686.284,"--Well, first of all, Justice Kagan, it was important to catch the answer to your question when you asked it of General Verrilli, which was, you're not saying that we lose all of our First Amendment rights."
2011.10-1293,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1733.931,1737.983,"Well, you want us to overrule a decision of this Court, Pacifica?"
2011.10-1293,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1737.983,1738.899,"Yes, Justice."
2011.10-1293,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1738.899,1742.618,"Now, as to radio, what has changed?"
2011.10-1293,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1742.618,1744.32,I'm not here--
2011.10-1293,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1744.32,1745.02,--to justify that?
2011.10-1293,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1752.743,1764.049,"--Absolutely, Your Honor, because there are fundamentally different media and there are different protections and the circumstances are different and the Court has recognized that media have to be evaluated individually."
2011.10-1293,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1779.476,1780.676,But that cuts both ways.
2011.10-1293,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1809.58,1811.396,"Well, it seems to me there are two answers to that."
2011.10-1293,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1835.563,1839.182,"Well, that's your argument there, is that it's not a legitimate objective to have a safe harbor."
2011.10-1293,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1839.182,1844.686,"Well, you can get a safe harbor, And indeed there are a number of safe harbors that are out there."
2011.10-1293,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1875.038,1884.144,"But if we rule in your favor on First Amendment grounds, what will -- people who watch Fox be seeing between 6:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m.?"
2011.10-1293,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1890.231,1900.253,Not under the guidelines that Fox has used consistently from 10:00 p.m. until 6:00 a.m. and candidly that all of the other networks follow.
2011.10-1293,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1912.411,1915.196,So what will you put on that you are not able to put on now?
2011.10-1293,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1915.196,1924.469,"--Well, some of the things that we could at least wonder about is Catch-22> [""], perhaps the beginning of the Olympics."
2011.10-1293,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1939.729,1943.098,"All right, so suppose we take that particular line."
2011.10-1293,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1998.7,1999.185,--Right.
2011.10-1293,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1999.185,2000.985,Are you abandoning that argument?
2011.10-1293,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2000.985,2001.919,"No, no, no, of course not."
2011.10-1293,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2015.212,2017.247,"It's an A, B, C argument primarily."
2011.10-1293,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2024.667,2025.184,--No--
2011.10-1293,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2025.184,2026.002,"--It's very, very broad."
2011.10-1293,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2026.002,2026.436,--No.
2011.10-1293,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2046.5,2047.766,"Well, that's not really clear."
2011.10-1293,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2070.031,2093.731,"--Well, our basic argument would then -- I mean, obviously what -- you would be taking away the vagueness argument, but that would just bring you back then, Justice Scalia, to the core Pacifica argument and the question of how far can the -- how is it permissible to allow the FCC to regulate the broadcast networks on standards that are fundamentally different than cable, the internet and every other medium that exists?"
2011.10-1293,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2109.34,2112.542,"Well, broadcast TV is living on borrowed time."
2011.10-1293,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2117.762,2120.898,I hope that -- I'm sure my client is not thrilled to have you say that.
2011.10-1293,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2120.898,2121.281,"Well, I'm sure--"
2011.10-1293,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2142.361,2147.798,"No, I -- it would be -- you know, obviously not, because that's why we are not uniquely accessible or uniquely pervasive."
2011.10-1293,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2147.798,2148.281,Yeah.
2011.10-1293,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2153.235,2157.921,"Well, because -- well, we didn't ask you to intervene, actually the FCC is going to ask you to intervene--"
2011.10-1293,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2157.921,2160.123,But you are asking us to intervene by overruling a prior precedent.
2011.10-1293,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2160.123,2166.693,"--Well, I believe -- well, I think once the issue is before the Court it ought to decide the 1st Amendment question that's presented here."
2011.10-1293,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2186.906,2205.901,"But isn't the inevitable consequence or this precise consequence that you're arguing for on this fleeting expletive portion of this case, that every celebrity or want to be celebrity that is interviewed can feel free to use one of these words."
2011.10-1293,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2213.155,2216.426,"Well, that they will use it, perhaps."
2011.10-1293,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2222.094,2231.033,"Well, I mean even you did in tis one, you said now remember you're on television, which was just -- giving an added incentive for these vulgar comments."
2011.10-1293,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2231.033,2235.903,"--Well, that was clearly not -- I mean from Fox's perspective it was not scripted to set it up that way."
2011.10-1293,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2238.105,2241.407,"But, I mean, isn't it inevitable that this will happen?"
2011.10-1293,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2241.407,2247.895,"--It is inevitable that -- well, I think it's inevitable regardless that people are going to continue to use language that they would naturally use."
2011.10-1293,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2297.576,2305.248,Do you think that there is a difference between what a person sees on broadcast channels and what a person sees on basic cable?
2011.10-1293,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2307.1,2309.4,--Can the average child understand of the difference between the two--
2011.10-1293,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2309.4,2309.885,"No, in content."
2011.10-1293,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2320.441,2327.597,"--Well, I mean, in some show -- I think it probably depends on which -- which channels you -- you look at, and even in the basic channels."
2011.10-1293,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2389.435,2396.438,"What you acknowledge to be the vulgarity of cable suggests otherwise, doesn't it?"
2011.10-1293,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2396.438,2403.594,"Well, I'm not suggesting that there is -- there is some kind of wildly different approach."
2011.10-1293,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2418.254,2419.804,"Well, that depends what your audience--"
2011.10-1293,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2419.804,2421.04,But at a minimum broadcasting will be--
2011.10-1293,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2421.04,2423.758,"--It depends on what audience you're -- you're trying to get, and the demographic."
2011.10-1293,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2445.855,2461.031,"--Well, no, I think it ought to go -- it ought to be analyzed the exact opposite, which is that -- that the -- the obligation, the burden rests on the Federal Communications Commission and Congress to show that there is a real problem that needs to be solved and that this is narrowly tailored to achieve that."
2011.10-1293,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2461.617,2462.383,"Thank you, Mr. Phillips."
2011.10-1293,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2477.976,2480.428,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2011.10-1293,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2542.852,2548.589,People understand -- what you have demonstrated I think is that the context matters.
2011.10-1293,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2582.477,2584.679,On -- quite the contrary.
2011.10-1293,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2619.752,2623.037,"But this wasn't -- I mean, I -- don't know about this instance."
2011.10-1293,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2640.515,2641.132,--I--
2011.10-1293,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2641.132,2651.388,"But my point is what the FCC terribly told you to do was run it 1 hour later in the Midwest, just as you did on the coast."
2011.10-1293,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2651.388,2651.99,--Yes.
2011.10-1293,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2651.99,2670.535,"And -- and why is that not -- I'm not saying, taking this point of view, but I'm saying why -- isn't that just time, manner and circumstance that puts you to very little trouble, and allows everybody to see it, and therefore is constitutional?"
2011.10-1293,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2670.535,2674.253,"The -- this is not some sort of obscure, unknown reason."
2011.10-1293,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2684.959,2687.578,"Because you wanted to make more money from it, I understand that."
2011.10-1293,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2721.598,2722.334,"Well, number -- yes."
2011.10-1293,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2757.505,2758.69,All right.
2011.10-1293,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2758.69,2763.911,--It is simply untrue -- it is simply untrue that this had never occurred before.
2011.10-1293,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2779.768,2781.12,You're going off the question.
2011.10-1293,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2781.12,2782.354,Okay.
2011.10-1293,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2782.354,2783.805,Which -- you haven't seen where I'm going.
2011.10-1293,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2844.094,2845.212,I think so.
2011.10-1293,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2845.212,2845.679,All right.
2011.10-1293,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2845.679,2848.431,"And if not, I -- I hope you will tell me."
2011.10-1293,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2928.116,2931.502,"By -- by sanctioned, you mean punished as rather -- as opposed to sanctions?"
2011.10-1293,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2931.502,2932.902,"Yes, yes, yes."
2011.10-1293,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2936.104,2939.841,How many displays -- how many displays of nudity were there that -- that went unsanctioned?
2011.10-1293,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2939.841,2942.976,"Well, for -- I can't tell you, but I can tell you--"
2011.10-1293,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2942.976,2947.094,"Well, I mean, if there are very few, it's -- it's not a very powerful argument."
2011.10-1293,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2947.094,2949.213,"--Well, I -- I think it's a powerful argument."
2011.10-1293,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3003.781,3004.616,But I--
2011.10-1293,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3004.616,3005.132,That's what you've got--
2011.10-1293,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3005.132,3005.749,--looked and found 17.
2011.10-1293,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3007.449,3010.52,--That's what you've got over 85 years.
2011.10-1293,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3010.52,3028.162,"--Well, first of all, we don't have television broadcasts over 85 years, and since there were no reported decisions of any indecency enforcement until Pacifica, I think it's only fair, as you pointed out yourself, to look at what the commission has been addressing."
2011.10-1293,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3105.245,3105.961,Me neither.
2011.10-1293,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3108.63,3114.032,"--Could -- could ABC or anybody else rebroadcast the ""Roots"" series?"
2011.10-1293,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3128.375,3131.411,But your only conclusion from that is that they can't have any rule.
2011.10-1293,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3131.411,3132.246,No.
2011.10-1293,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3132.246,3140.0,What is -- I looked through the briefs; I don't see what you're -- tell me where in these briefs do you suggest what the rule ought to be.
2011.10-1293,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3140.0,3149.272,"In our brief, we don't suggest what the rule ought to be, because A, it's not our burden; B, it's not yours; and C, there are any number of options."
2011.10-1293,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3149.272,3157.111,"Well, we -- well, we have to anticipate what the natural results or consequences of our decision will be."
2011.10-1293,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3157.111,3157.994,Sure.
2011.10-1293,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3157.994,3166.917,"As I understand it, the same rules that we apply to obscenity for printed material under your view would apply to television."
2011.10-1293,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3166.917,3170.354,"Well, those rules certainly would apply."
2011.10-1293,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3171.454,3175.256,"In other words, if it's -- if it's not obscene, you can publish it."
2011.10-1293,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3175.84,3176.842,"--No, no, no."
2011.10-1293,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3185.713,3187.597,"Well, I thought that was the whole gravamen of your argument."
2011.10-1293,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3187.597,3187.982,--No.
2011.10-1293,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3205.611,3207.427,But isn't that inherent in a context-based approach?
2011.10-1293,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3219.535,3221.886,It certainly is not.
2011.10-1293,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3231.176,3232.178,Are they in the briefs?
2011.10-1293,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3241.034,3242.234,--I don't know the pages.
2011.10-1293,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3276.155,3278.323,I -- I'm going to let you get all four out.
2011.10-1293,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3294.602,3308.176,"--I am not owning Nicole Richie, and I think the best answer to the Nicole Richie point is that there is a scienter requirement in the statute that, you know, would preclude the application to a good-faith effort."
2011.10-1293,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3308.928,3309.444,Okay.
2011.10-1293,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3309.928,3310.644,--I'll just go back.
2011.10-1293,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3316.632,3317.582,Your time's -- I think you are.
2011.10-1293,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3321.586,3322.036,Okay.
2011.10-1293,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3388.394,3389.046,"Thank you, counsel."
2011.10-1293,3,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3391.113,3395.984,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2011.10-1293,3,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3441.529,3465.744,"General, I think that the, the networks really are saying: Well, even if some regulation is permissible, the kind of regulation that the FCC has done here is regulation that gives it complete discretion as to what kind of speech to go after and what not to go after; that it has not tied itself in any way to any kinds of standards."
2011.10-1293,3,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3491.979,3494.498,"I -- Well, I disagree."
2011.10-1293,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3561.906,3570.045,"Even though the Justices involved said this is a narrow decision, both Justice Stevens and Justice Powell."
2011.10-1293,3,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3570.045,3576.633,"--Yes, and, Justice Ginsburg, that is true and the principles the commission continues to apply are narrow principles."
2011.10-1293,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3604.718,3612.922,"But on the other side, you'd better be careful about calling certain people, certain artists to be interviewed because we know it's unscripted."
2011.10-1293,3,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3616.276,3617.876,--But I -- A couple answers there.
2011.10-1293,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3633.752,3635.937,Maybe the third is you shouldn't interview these people.
2011.10-1293,3,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3635.937,3643.093,"Let me spend, if I could, a minute on the NYPD Blue> [""] broadcast."
2011.10-1293,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3658.903,3661.155,"Finish your sentence, please."
2011.10-1293,3,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3661.155,3661.605,--Thank you.
2011.10-1293,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3673.629,3674.379,"Thank you, General."
