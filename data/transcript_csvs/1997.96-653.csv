1997.96-653,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.367,"Well, we'll hear argument first this morning in Number 96-653, Kenneth Lee Baker and Steven Robert Baker v. General Motors Corporation."
1997.96-653,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,9.847,12.67,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1997.96-653,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,66.173,70.267,"Mr. Tribe, you refer to the Michigan proceeding as a consent decree."
1997.96-653,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,72.08,86.802,"What I mean, Mr. Chief Justice, is that there was no adversary hearing and though consent decree is sometimes used to refer to a class action, here it was a stipulated settlement entered on the record by the judge after--"
1997.96-653,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,86.802,90.954,"Well, that's true of all settlements, isn't it, that there's no adversary hearing?"
1997.96-653,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,90.954,91.194,--Sure.
1997.96-653,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,113.068,119.814,"Well, even if Baker had had notice in Missouri, I take it your position is he wouldn't have to go to Michigan."
1997.96-653,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,119.814,120.285,--That's certainly true--
1997.96-653,1,37789,paul_t_cappuccio,,1540.268,1548.656,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1997.96-653,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1582.616,1600.799,"The application of full faith and credit as far as I know, in all the history of that clause, this Court has never even said that full faith and credit is owed to a decree ordering a person to do an act."
1997.96-653,1,37789,paul_t_cappuccio,,1649.582,1652.764,"--Your Honor, I respectfully disagree."
1997.96-653,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1665.914,1679.444,Just give me one citation where this Court has said State 2 must compel X to do an act simply because State 1 compelled X to do an act.
1997.96-653,1,37789,paul_t_cappuccio,,1679.444,1685.295,"--Well, I can give you... a custody decree, for example, will require someone to have or not have the child."
1997.96-653,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1691.479,1696.774,All that Cole v. Cunningham said was that State 1 can issue an antisuit injunction.
1997.96-653,1,37789,paul_t_cappuccio,,1701.717,1713.936,"--But Your Honor, there is no basis in either the language of section 1738 or any policy of full faith and credit to treat an injunction or an affirmative injunction, as opposed to a prohibitory one, any different."
1997.96-653,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1715.336,1723.7,"I'm simply asking you, has there ever been such a case in the history of the United States... custody is a status, child custody."
1997.96-653,1,37789,paul_t_cappuccio,,1725.723,1728.104,--I am unaware--
1997.96-653,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1728.104,1747.239,"I am not aware... I am aware of some, as you no doubt know, the land cases, Fall v. Eastin, Klopp v. Klopp say even the very actor that was told to convey a piece of property in State 1 doesn't have to do it if he's in State 2 and that's where the property is."
1997.96-653,1,37789,paul_t_cappuccio,,1747.239,1748.942,"--Well, I'm not sure that's the holding of Fall v. Eastin."
1997.96-653,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1759.01,1759.277,"Well, it's a long extension."
1997.96-653,1,37789,paul_t_cappuccio,,1766.604,1768.964,--Your Honor--
1997.96-653,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1768.964,1776.401,"You may be right that the Restatement was wrong and that those cases were wrong, but it is something very novel you're asking us to do."
1997.96-653,1,37789,paul_t_cappuccio,,1776.401,1777.469,"--Your Honor, two answers to that."
1997.96-653,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1802.348,1808.041,"But in all events, the other problem is that you're trying to make this applicable to Baker, and Baker is simply not bound."
1997.96-653,1,37789,paul_t_cappuccio,,1840.032,1840.553,"No, sir."
1997.96-653,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1860.569,1866.381,"Well, I'm not sure that we have to address it in the due process context and, frankly, I hope we don't have to."
1997.96-653,1,37789,paul_t_cappuccio,,1876.566,1882.601,"Well, Your Honor, because the application of full faith and credit is fairly straightforward here, and this picks up on another question you had."
1997.96-653,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1920.485,1923.499,"--But those people were all within the jurisdiction of the Michigan courts, were they not?"
1997.96-653,1,37789,paul_t_cappuccio,,1923.499,1924.919,"They were, and I--"
1997.96-653,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1924.919,1928.513,"And that's different, because the Bakers are not."
1997.96-653,1,37789,paul_t_cappuccio,,1928.513,1933.628,"--Well, Your Honor, it is different from... on the due process question, I agree with you."
1997.96-653,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1934.35,1948.43,"But as Justice O'Connor was indicating, it seems to me it's also different because of the fundamental law of judgments, which is that you can't apply a judgment or enforce a judgment against a person... against... where there was no personal jurisdiction over that person originally."
1997.96-653,1,37789,paul_t_cappuccio,,1948.43,1948.861,"--Well, that--"
1997.96-653,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1948.861,1950.603,It's just a simple personal jurisdiction.
1997.96-653,1,37789,paul_t_cappuccio,,1950.603,1966.873,"--That sort of raises the question as to whether these people are being bound by the judgment rather than being affected by the judgment in some incidental way, but I think that bound debate, which the Court has had in Martin v. Wilks, is just a proxy for the due process analysis."
1997.96-653,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1967.674,1969.665,"Mr. Cappuccio, it isn't in this respect."
1997.96-653,1,37789,paul_t_cappuccio,,2015.648,2015.848,--Your--
1997.96-653,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2015.848,2018.991,--and I've never seen any decree quite like that.
1997.96-653,1,37789,paul_t_cappuccio,,2018.991,2027.087,"--Your Honor, this is just Michigan deciding something between Ron Elwell and General Motors and preventing Elwell from hurting General Motors."
1997.96-653,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2044.878,2045.289,May I--
1997.96-653,1,37789,paul_t_cappuccio,,2071.266,2072.456,"Because, Your Honor--"
1997.96-653,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2072.456,2076.36,--if he agrees to in fact testify?
1997.96-653,1,37789,paul_t_cappuccio,,2076.36,2085.476,"--Because, Your Honor, with the Full Faith and Credit Clause requires, again, is that the Michigan injunction be given the same force and effect, and at a minimum I would argue that requires--"
1997.96-653,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2085.476,2093.239,"Do you have any authority that the Michigan courts say that their judgments bind persons who were not before the court, and over whom the court had no personal jurisdiction?"
1997.96-653,1,37789,paul_t_cappuccio,,2093.239,2094.572,"--I'm sorry, Your Honor, they do not say that."
1997.96-653,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2095.414,2098.535,"Well then, it doesn't have the effect that you seek to give it here."
1997.96-653,1,37789,paul_t_cappuccio,,2098.535,2111.504,"--No, I'm sorry, Your Honor, the Michigan courts' cases simply say that someone who is affected by the judgment and seeks to reopen it, or seeks to modify it or challenge it, must go back to the court that rendered it."
1997.96-653,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2114.308,2115.83,If they're already in Michigan.
1997.96-653,1,37789,paul_t_cappuccio,,2115.83,2122.745,"Well, but by... that's right, Your Honor, because that rule is just for Michigan, but by operation... this is the most important point."
1997.96-653,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2128.9,2139.548,"Mr. Cappuccio, would you tell me how Michigan has the power to drag somebody in Alaska, in Hawaii, and say you can't... plaintiff, you can't choose your own forum."
1997.96-653,1,37789,paul_t_cappuccio,,2160.121,2165.865,"--I understand that, and I lay that at the feet of the U.S. Congress, and they were wise to have done that."
1997.96-653,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2167.758,2169.879,"No, but Mr. Cappuccio, may I ask this question?"
1997.96-653,1,37789,paul_t_cappuccio,,2169.879,2170.059,Sure.
1997.96-653,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2170.059,2172.79,It only does it if the Michigan court had the power to enter the order it did enter.
1997.96-653,1,37789,paul_t_cappuccio,,2174.692,2176.634,"Jurisdiction over the person or subject matter, yes, sir."
1997.96-653,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2176.634,2189.433,And would you think there is any question at all about the power of a Michigan court to order a litigant before it to refuse to comply with any normally lawful court order that might be entered anywhere else in the country?
1997.96-653,1,37789,paul_t_cappuccio,,2194.856,2195.027,I understand.
1997.96-653,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2195.027,2196.028,I'm just looking just at Elwell.
1997.96-653,1,37789,paul_t_cappuccio,,2207.444,2208.225,I agree.
1997.96-653,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2209.467,2217.953,And you think it's perfectly clear that there's no jurisdictional issue as to the power of a court to enter such an order as required full... must be given full faith and credit.
1997.96-653,1,37789,paul_t_cappuccio,,2217.953,2219.355,I can't imagine what the jurisdictional issue would be.
1997.96-653,2,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3224.434,3225.726,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1997.96-653,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3250.102,3253.244,"Mr. Tribe, I don't understand one thing about your position."
1997.96-653,2,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3270.828,3271.777,No.
1997.96-653,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3292.012,3293.371,"No, no, not by contract."
1997.96-653,2,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3300.945,3302.067,"I think not, Justice Scalia."
1997.96-653,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3302.067,3302.367,Okay.
1997.96-653,2,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3303.159,3303.349,Right.
1997.96-653,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3304.16,3308.313,"--not only that the State court is not bound, but also that Elwood is not bound?"
1997.96-653,2,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3308.313,3309.834,"In all likelihood, though--"
1997.96-653,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3309.834,3311.513,And what is the principle?
1997.96-653,2,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3314.006,3323.743,--The principle is that as a matter of due process one cannot be held in contempt for refusing to comply with the order of a court.
1997.96-653,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3324.183,3326.334,"But he could be held in contempt if he acquiesced, couldn't he?"
1997.96-653,2,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3326.334,3328.665,"--You can waive your right, certainly Justice Souter."
1997.96-653,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3328.665,3330.027,"No, but I mean, if he--"
1997.96-653,2,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3333.47,3334.118,"Oh, yes, that's... sure."
1997.96-653,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3334.118,3335.43,--Or if his objection is a sham--
1997.96-653,2,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3335.43,3335.71,Then there's no--
1997.96-653,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3335.71,3337.301,"--then, of course they can go after--"
1997.96-653,2,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3337.301,3337.522,--Then there's no problem.
1997.96-653,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3337.682,3341.104,"--Or if he goes to that State in order to be subpoenaed, which is what happened here, apparently."
1997.96-653,2,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3341.104,3344.247,--There's no evidence in the record of what... of that.
