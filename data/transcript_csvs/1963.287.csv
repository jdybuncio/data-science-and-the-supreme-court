1963.287,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,32.241,"Number 287, Victor Rabinowitz et al., Petitioners, versus Robert F. Kennedy, Attorney General of the United States."
1963.287,0,21463,david_rein,,36.495,45.15,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1963.287,1,41897,stephen_j_pollak,,3663.123,3667.548,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1963.287,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3741.202,3747.304,(Inaudible) settle the law and whatever the cases to be decided.
1963.287,1,41897,stephen_j_pollak,,3747.304,3747.886,Well --
1963.287,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3747.886,3753.573,But it may settle the law without restraining any government official from doing something.
1963.287,1,41897,stephen_j_pollak,,3753.573,3754.235,Well --
1963.287,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3754.235,3758.002,He can go ahead and try it and maybe the Court would change its mind.
1963.287,1,41897,stephen_j_pollak,,3758.002,3762.085,"Well, we don't think that the petitioners view the case in that posture Your Honor."
1963.287,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3762.457,3762.627,I --
1963.287,1,41897,stephen_j_pollak,,3762.627,3765.239,We believe that they're seeking a binding judgment to preclude that description.
1963.287,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3765.239,3768.308,But we're not bound -- we're not bound by their view of the law any more than you are.
1963.287,1,41897,stephen_j_pollak,,3768.308,3769.623,"No sir, no sir."
1963.287,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,3903.608,3917.743,(Inaudible)
1963.287,1,41897,stephen_j_pollak,,3917.743,3921.286,"Well, we think that -- I think several things."
1963.287,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4257.272,4260.996,(Inaudible)
1963.287,1,41897,stephen_j_pollak,,4260.996,4271.502,"Well, in the argument that the law is unconstitutional Mr. Justice Black, the petitioners cite Lanzetti and the void for vagueness doctrine."
1963.287,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4287.874,4305.162,"Well, do I -- I'd like -- clearly on -- it's your position that the Act does cover and require registration -- cover and require registration by a lawyer who does nothing but hire himself out to represent somebody in a court proceeding."
1963.287,1,41897,stephen_j_pollak,,4305.162,4307.338,"No, I -- I don't think that in that --"
1963.287,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4307.338,4309.001,"That's the issue they're tendering, isn't it?"
1963.287,1,41897,stephen_j_pollak,,4309.001,4333.607,"Well, our position is that a lawyer that represents a foreign government particularly in this case, it happens to be a socialist nation which has engaged itself in trade or commerce, is not in the words of the statute, engaged in non -- in private, non-political activities and that he's required to register."
1963.287,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4333.607,4338.265,"Well, does that mean and -- and maybe you're right and I'm -- I'm not -- I don't take much --"
1963.287,1,41897,stephen_j_pollak,,4338.265,4338.716,Yes.
1963.287,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4338.716,4341.226,"-- talking, they allege unconstitutionality of such law."
1963.287,1,41897,stephen_j_pollak,,4341.226,4342.012,Yes.
1963.287,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4342.012,4358.977,But did that say that the Congress has here declared that every lawyer who represents a foreign country for a fee in a court below has to register?
1963.287,1,41897,stephen_j_pollak,,4358.977,4367.763,"Well, there maybe a distinction that is made for a representation on a one -- one time basis."
1963.287,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4367.763,4375.208,"But suppose you read this like you represent a -- an insurance company, agree and follow their cases or -- or so much a day."
1963.287,1,41897,stephen_j_pollak,,4375.208,4375.995,Yes sir.
1963.287,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4377.922,4380.845,"Just a lawyer, I'm talking about a lawyer and not a public relations one."
1963.287,1,41897,stephen_j_pollak,,4380.845,4381.101,Yes.
1963.287,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4387.691,4389.951,There's none?
1963.287,1,41897,stephen_j_pollak,,4394.398,4394.514,That they are --
1963.287,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4394.514,4396.875,-- or I could represent any other client --
1963.287,1,41897,stephen_j_pollak,,4396.875,4397.486,Well --
1963.287,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4397.486,4399.079,-- that happened to be representing Cuba?
1963.287,1,41897,stephen_j_pollak,,4399.079,4406.482,Their -- their allegations are that they represent the Republic of Cuba in financial and mercantile matters.
1963.287,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4416.388,4417.209,Is that why?
1963.287,1,41897,stephen_j_pollak,,4417.209,4428.462,"That in representing a foreign government, a foreign government which is itself engaged in trade or commerce that the petitioners, the lawyers are required to register."
1963.287,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4428.724,4431.311,Your position then is on the merits that --
1963.287,1,41897,stephen_j_pollak,,4431.311,4432.186,That they are required to register.
1963.287,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4432.186,4435.774,"That they're required to register, even though everything they say is true."
1963.287,1,41897,stephen_j_pollak,,4435.774,4442.943,"Well, even though everything they say is true, I -- we're -- we believe they're required to register."
1963.287,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4456.558,4473.32,"Well, I wouldn't think about private, I just -- thinking about the difference having to have written or at one time, between a lawyer who acts as a lawyer and tries cases and represents people as a lawyer and a man who represents people as a kind of a lobbyist or propaganda idea."
1963.287,1,41897,stephen_j_pollak,,4473.32,4484.868,"Well, the petitioners -- and I -- I was discussing the law (Voice Overlap) --"
1963.287,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4484.868,4489.453,I -- I had assumed maybe that that was what this was after.
1963.287,1,41897,stephen_j_pollak,,4493.048,4493.504,"Well, the law --"
1963.287,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4493.504,4494.461,Just as a whole whenever they --
1963.287,1,41897,stephen_j_pollak,,4494.461,4495.229,Yes.
1963.287,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4495.229,4496.33,-- hire themselves out.
1963.287,1,41897,stephen_j_pollak,,4496.33,4496.59,Yes.
1963.287,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4511.335,4512.585,(Voice Overlap) in what?
1963.287,1,41897,stephen_j_pollak,,4512.585,4513.417,Pardon me?
1963.287,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4513.417,4515.179,Acting as an agent in what?
1963.287,1,41897,stephen_j_pollak,,4516.769,4534.538,"I believe it's on page 56 of the Government's brief, it says, ""An agent of a foreign principal includes any person who agrees to act or acts within the United States and then it lists number of things or attorney for a foreign principal."""
1963.287,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4534.538,4543.493,"Well then your -- you -- you're standing in on that as -- so far as the merit is concerned, it's meaning that if they represent Cuba, it doesn't make any difference."
1963.287,1,41897,stephen_j_pollak,,4546.772,4547.687,"I think that's right, yes."
1963.287,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4547.687,4548.503,(Voice Overlap) as an attorney?
1963.287,1,41897,stephen_j_pollak,,4548.503,4548.748,Yes.
1963.287,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4567.005,4567.141,And you --
1963.287,1,41897,stephen_j_pollak,,4567.141,4567.601,-- by what they've alleged.
1963.287,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4567.601,4574.408,"You think that issue is here, whether the issue as to whether they could have a test by this method."
1963.287,1,41897,stephen_j_pollak,,4574.408,4576.643,"No, we do not think that the merits are here."
1963.287,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4581.629,4582.216,No.
1963.287,1,41897,stephen_j_pollak,,4582.216,4584.368,I don't think I've suggested that.
1963.287,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4584.368,4592.563,"You think that even though they're required by the Act to register, under their allegations, we can't decide that in this case, is that it?"
1963.287,1,41897,stephen_j_pollak,,4592.563,4595.502,I don't think you're -- I don't think you're required to decide it.
1963.287,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4596.687,4605.11,"Well, in here we might reach it because some of us might think it -- they have a right to get a declaratory judgment as they did in Terrace versus Thompson."
1963.287,1,41897,stephen_j_pollak,,4605.11,4613.586,"Well, let -- let me turn then to our position on whether they have a right to get a declaratory judgment."
1963.287,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4735.401,4755.051,"(Inaudible) that draw a distinction between the merits of it.You know that Terrace versus Thompson, they said this, ""They are not obligated to take the risk of prosecution, fines and imprisonment, the loss of property in order to secure the adjudication of their right."""
1963.287,1,41897,stephen_j_pollak,,4755.051,4755.571,Yes.
1963.287,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4755.571,4760.278,And that was quoted in the report of the Senate Committee on declaratory judgment law.
1963.287,1,41897,stephen_j_pollak,,4760.278,4762.618,Yes.
1963.287,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4762.618,4764.649,Does this come in that -- within that or not?
1963.287,1,41897,stephen_j_pollak,,4764.649,4779.424,We -- we do not think that it -- that it does come within that because we think there were allegations in the cases in which this Court has recognized that a suit to enjoin a criminal prosecution could lie.
1963.287,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4784.153,4788.794,But this was the irreparable harm that they're about to be prosecuted.
1963.287,1,41897,stephen_j_pollak,,4788.794,4789.029,"Well, this --"
1963.287,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4789.029,4794.329,And it had to have to go though that before they could know whether they'll be convicted or not.
1963.287,1,41897,stephen_j_pollak,,4794.329,4804.395,"In -- as we read the cases, the -- a single prosecution is not a sufficient harm to give jurisdiction in equity."
1963.287,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4819.099,4821.533,So how much could they get on one prosecution?
1963.287,1,41897,stephen_j_pollak,,4821.533,4822.674,In this -- in the -- put this --
1963.287,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4822.674,4823.394,In this case?
1963.287,1,41897,stephen_j_pollak,,4823.394,4824.018,-- in this particular case.
1963.287,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4824.018,4825.226,"How about case, what --"
1963.287,1,41897,stephen_j_pollak,,4825.226,4829.329,"The maximum penalties are $10,000 and five years in prison."
1963.287,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4829.329,4831.364,And you say that -- that's not irreparable.
1963.287,1,41897,stephen_j_pollak,,4831.364,4861.928,"Well, we -- we say that the Court statement, we rely on the statement in Prince -- Douglas versus Jeannette or the Spielman Motor Sales case, that a single prosecution, a single defense is not irreparable harm and that these cases in which the Court has upheld an injunction, have entailed penalties which the Court has called ""immense or extreme,"" I may not have the right adjective but these are penalties which -- which have no measure."
1963.287,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4866.069,4869.283,But Ex parte Young is quite different to this one.
1963.287,1,41897,stephen_j_pollak,,4872.026,4872.873,"Well, as I --"
1963.287,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4872.873,4874.132,What was the punishment there?
1963.287,1,41897,stephen_j_pollak,,4874.132,4904.175,"Well, as I will recall Terrace v. Thompson, the provision and possibly, I'll have a chance to review it before tomorrow, but as I recall it, the provision there precluded the petitioners' use of their property during the period that they -- they had engaged or contracted for a sale and that -- and the law precluded the sale and precluded their use of the property and I think that the case rested on that denial."
1963.287,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4921.112,4925.218,"Mr. Pollak, I think I should study that -- we'll finish this case tonight."
1963.287,1,41897,stephen_j_pollak,,4925.218,4933.323,"Well, and I won't -- I won't have anything further to say on that case."
1963.287,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5345.377,5348.543,"So there has been 16,075 separate registrations --"
1963.287,1,41897,stephen_j_pollak,,5348.543,5349.054,Registrations.
1963.287,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5349.054,5349.292,-- under (Voice Overlap).
1963.287,1,41897,stephen_j_pollak,,5349.292,5349.92,That's right.
1963.287,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5349.92,5351.786,What's the 94 figure in your brief?
1963.287,1,41897,stephen_j_pollak,,5351.786,5352.139,The 94 --

1963.287,1,41897,stephen_j_pollak,,5352.662,5363.416,-- figure is the -- the most recent list of active attorneys or firms of attorneys that are registered or haven't registered.
1963.287,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5363.416,5364.631,"Attorneys, you mean lawyers?"
1963.287,1,41897,stephen_j_pollak,,5364.631,5365.893,Lawyers.
1963.287,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,5394.4,5402.41,(Inaudible)
1963.287,1,41897,stephen_j_pollak,,5402.41,5403.11,"No, sir."
1963.287,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5532.541,5536.785,Is there a specific authority in the statute for him to ask people to register?
1963.287,1,41897,stephen_j_pollak,,5536.785,5539.466,There is no specific authority in this statute --
1963.287,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5539.466,5539.503,It's --
1963.287,1,41897,stephen_j_pollak,,5539.503,5540.462,-- for him to ask.
1963.287,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5540.496,5545.1,"It's the duty of those covered to register and I suppose it's his duty to prosecute those who don't, isn't it?"
1963.287,1,41897,stephen_j_pollak,,5545.1,5557.95,"If indeed, the -- at the outset of the petitioners' argument, the question was asked whether if the Attorney General had not asked for registration but had just brought a prosecution."

1963.287,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5802.839,5804.468,And they would have to register?
1963.287,1,41897,stephen_j_pollak,,5804.468,5805.563,It would have to register.
1963.287,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5808.099,5810.674,And therefore its lawyer would.
