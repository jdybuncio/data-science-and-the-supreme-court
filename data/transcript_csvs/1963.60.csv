1963.60,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,151.282,190.799,(Inaudible) the fact the this Court has so heavily rejected (Inaudible).
1963.60,0,16181,alfred_i_hopkins,,190.799,193.65,I wish I had seen the point of the trial court.
1963.60,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,442.553,443.785,What page is that?
1963.60,0,16181,alfred_i_hopkins,,443.785,449.875,"On page 28, Your Honor, between pages 28 to 30."
1963.60,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,529.13,535.455,"What -- what is the precise point for which you present this argument, this -- emphasize this --"
1963.60,0,16181,alfred_i_hopkins,,535.455,558.655,"At a later point in my argument, I wanted to -- to make this position, Your Honor, that we have uncontradicted in the record a statement by the State's own witness that there is a custom prevalent was at that time on the White majority in Dade County, which compelled the manager of the restaurant to segregate and --"
1963.60,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,558.655,572.08,You -- you mean that if the sentiment of a community can only be met by taking that course that the Constitution would make that state action.
1963.60,0,16181,alfred_i_hopkins,,572.08,580.242,"I base my position, Your Honor, on the dictum of Justice Bradley in the majority opinion of the civil rights cases."
1963.60,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,611.823,615.826,"Well, you know -- have we had -- I'm not -- I'm asking you this for information."
1963.60,0,16181,alfred_i_hopkins,,624.468,625.121,"Your Honor, I have not found a case."
1963.60,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,625.121,638.596,-- and the long continued legal practice by having the effects such as we had in the Tennessee case or in the failing to summon jurors where the state officials just did not do it over the period?
1963.60,0,16181,alfred_i_hopkins,,638.596,648.531,"Your Honor, I haven't found such a case and this question in my mind as to what Justice Bradley meant -- what the majority of the Court meant."
1963.60,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,656.424,658.522,You're relying on that?
1963.60,0,16181,alfred_i_hopkins,,658.522,667.485,I am suggesting that that statute repeats the same language and that that may have been in the mind of the framers of the Fourteenth Amendment --
1963.60,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,667.485,684.866,But does that have any relevance to your argument here except insofar as you want to construe the Fourteenth Amendment as in saying that custom of the people -- prevailing sentiment of the people should be accepted as the law of the State?
1963.60,0,16181,alfred_i_hopkins,,684.866,690.457,I'm suggesting that it may well have been adapters of the framers of the Fourteenth Amendment.
1963.60,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,752.215,758.428,But what percentage of the people would the evidence require that you shall have that custom and that sentiment?
1963.60,0,16181,alfred_i_hopkins,,758.428,758.818,In this case --
1963.60,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,758.818,760.825,How would you try that out?
1963.60,0,16181,alfred_i_hopkins,,762.041,763.42,"In this case, we have the evidence."
1963.60,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,766.215,785.16,"But that -- that's rather slim to read, isn't it, to rest constitutional decision on as to whether the people have so engrafted it on a -- as a part of their legal system that it has to be used to set aside the state law as unconstitutional?"
1963.60,0,16181,alfred_i_hopkins,,785.16,793.821,"Mr. Justice Frankfurter indicated in Terry and Adams and one of his again in dictum that custom could have the force of law, in fact be stronger than the law."
1963.60,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,793.821,823.722,"But I think he wrote to that effect in the case from Tennessee with reference to the tax rather they have been taxing railroad, as I -- I hadn't got the name of it, but that was in line with our cases with reference to juries whether the Court's function so long in one way that you can say that that has become somewhat say the custom of the law enforcement officers and the state officials and others might say just the custom of the -- of the people."
1963.60,0,16181,alfred_i_hopkins,,823.722,843.84,"Your Honor, I don't bother my case entirely on that ground but I do suggest it to the Court as a possible way of resolving this case because I say the authority seems to be slim or negligible, so I did feel that I should bring that idea across to the Court in as much as it is in the record and no contradiction by any of the State's witnesses."
1963.60,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,843.84,849.064,"While I was asking you, because I'm familiar with those statements and I think you're perfectly right in presenting it."
1963.60,0,16181,alfred_i_hopkins,,855.927,865.377,A further statement of the facts insofar as they involved the Florida restaurant and hotel licensing statute.

1963.60,0,16181,alfred_i_hopkins,,922.835,924.0,"Yes, it is true."
1963.60,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,924.0,927.891,You can't build a house without a building permit.
1963.60,0,16181,alfred_i_hopkins,,927.891,950.127,"My argument will be or I'll make it now that the licensing requirements and this infusion of state activity and to private enterprise would, in my view, be limited to places of public accomodation, places where significant community interests are affected."
1963.60,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,995.408,1009.99,(Inaudible)
1963.60,0,16181,alfred_i_hopkins,,1009.99,1010.817,That's right but --

1963.60,0,16181,alfred_i_hopkins,,1011.381,1012.04,-- I think --
1963.60,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1012.04,1012.931,(Inaudible)
1963.60,0,16181,alfred_i_hopkins,,1012.931,1017.771,"Mr. Justice Stewart was suggesting, what about all the licensing laws, building permit laws, that sort of things."
1963.60,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1017.771,1018.574,The zoning law.
1963.60,0,16181,alfred_i_hopkins,,1018.574,1019.526,"Zoning laws, of course."
1963.60,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1019.526,1022.044,Inspection laws as to plumbing and electricity and else --
1963.60,0,16181,alfred_i_hopkins,,1022.044,1022.865,"Yes, sir."
1963.60,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1022.865,1024.405,I presume they have in Florida.
1963.60,0,16181,alfred_i_hopkins,,1025.364,1027.785,"Yes, sir."
1963.60,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1149.499,1154.227,(Inaudible)
1963.60,0,16181,alfred_i_hopkins,,1154.227,1163.933,It's a big card that has points given for their compliance with various health and safety provisions.
1963.60,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1167.497,1186.723,"Does your argument base still on diverging the regulation of a business, on activity by the State to be treated for constitutional purposes, so as the way it worked, actual state operation of that, doesn't it?"
1963.60,0,16181,alfred_i_hopkins,,1186.723,1190.284,"That would be my argument, Your Honor, and I would base it upon --"
1963.60,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1190.284,1195.417,"Well, there are certain regulations with reference to the home."
1963.60,0,16181,alfred_i_hopkins,,1215.97,1228.905,"Let me, if I may, go back to the case of Public Utilities Commission versus Pollak and that was the case of the radios playing in the buses and three cars here in District of Columbia."
1963.60,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1380.602,1385.736,"Both of those cases I suggest there maybe a difference, two differences."
1963.60,0,16181,alfred_i_hopkins,,1398.809,1409.537,"To beat the monopoly situation, the Court said in Pollak that the fact it had a franchise, presumably it was given monopolistic powers was unimportant."
1963.60,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1437.452,1453.403,"My guess is only this that if you have a -- only one mass transportation monopoly, then this is the only way people can ride, who -- who need to use a mass transportation."
1963.60,0,16181,alfred_i_hopkins,,1471.14,1486.108,"But where the need is there, the need can be as great and significant to the Negro who wants to eat at Shell's City or some other variety store or department store as the need for an equally important service or commodity as transportation."
1963.60,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1519.857,1552.04,"Your argument boils down, as I understand it, to this that since restaurants are licensed in the sense that people need to buy food and so forth, you leave them to private ownership, but the government has just as much tried to regulate them as it would have if the government were exercising governmental authority, as some nations do, to own all the property and decide how people should use it and presume they are the associates."
1963.60,0,16181,alfred_i_hopkins,,1552.04,1555.152,They are -- they are already regulated in a -- in a great sense.
1963.60,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1555.152,1555.835,That's right.
1963.60,0,16181,alfred_i_hopkins,,1564.095,1564.486,I'm not sure --
1963.60,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1564.486,1574.646,"You said the mere fact that they were regulated gives the government the right to do these other things, if you say, when it wouldn't have if they were not regulated."
1963.60,0,16181,alfred_i_hopkins,,1574.646,1582.754,"I think it's the scope of the regulation, which is vast here in this case, because they -- the addition to what I've mentioned, the government can come in."
1963.60,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1585.535,1588.618,"Well, they can do that in any hotel or motel, doesn't it?"
1963.60,0,16181,alfred_i_hopkins,,1588.618,1590.286,They can but I suggest that what's --
1963.60,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1590.286,1620.239,"Suppose a man was living in it -- many people live in hotels and motels but it's just as thoroughly regulated as the other, would they have to -- could they -- could it be held that the Constitution, I'm not talking about legislation, could it be held that the Constitution itself compels them to accept people into their hotel rooms they don't want or for whatever reason?"
1963.60,0,16181,alfred_i_hopkins,,1620.239,1641.138,"I think when the State has gone this far and indicated this much of a concern and this much of a need for the State in adopting this kind of a -- a comprehensive licensing statute that we have a situation which is analogues to the Burton problem, Burton versus the Wilmington Parking Authority."
1963.60,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1647.994,1649.102,Which one was that?
1963.60,0,16181,alfred_i_hopkins,,1649.102,1651.877,Burton versus the Wilmington Parking Authority.
1963.60,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1651.877,1653.4,Who owned that property?
1963.60,0,16181,alfred_i_hopkins,,1653.4,1656.004,The property was owned by the city.
1963.60,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1667.217,1669.415,Did the Court put it on that ground?
1963.60,0,16181,alfred_i_hopkins,,1669.415,1669.884,"No, sir."
1963.60,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1692.829,1698.492,But one of the differences seems to me to be greater than the one as we have adopted in this nation.
1963.60,0,16181,alfred_i_hopkins,,1713.082,1717.157,Only where there is a significant community interest at stake.
1963.60,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1727.294,1738.219,"If you refer to private, you always ignore the private, what we call, the private ownership is ownership by somebody other than the government."
1963.60,0,16181,alfred_i_hopkins,,1741.784,1742.182,Right.
1963.60,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1744.958,1756.404,Marsh versus Alabama has many other phase and connections and your situation does not.
1963.60,0,16181,alfred_i_hopkins,,1756.404,1756.751,Capital Transit Company was a --
1963.60,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1756.751,1760.294,I may refer to it if you still think so.
1963.60,0,16181,alfred_i_hopkins,,1760.294,1774.137,"The Capital Transit Company I -- was, I assume, a private enterprise, yet in its operation in this particular respect, it took on characteristics of a governmental activity."
1963.60,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1779.408,1796.251,"Of course, the government could go so far when it would be a governmental activity, where despite terms and contracts and paper writing, the government was actually doing it and purported to put it in somebody else's hand."
1963.60,0,16181,alfred_i_hopkins,,1801.31,1805.978,"My argument is that this -- this degree of -- of interdependence, you use the word as --"
1963.60,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1805.978,1807.054,That's been reached here.
1963.60,0,16181,alfred_i_hopkins,,1807.054,1808.322,That's been reached here.
1963.60,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1943.995,1945.705,Mr. Georgieff.
1963.60,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,1945.705,1949.614,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.

1963.60,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,1996.288,1998.861,"No, but we are not free to assume that it was, sir."

1963.60,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,2017.178,2018.274,I beg your pardon?
1963.60,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2018.274,2024.233,Does that admission (Inaudible) because of the licensing facts?

1963.60,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2025.862,2028.931,(Inaudible)
1963.60,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,2028.931,2035.727,It's a fact therein the case just as are the situations brought up by counsel here.

1963.60,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,2045.708,2047.025,I will say this.
1963.60,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2056.777,2058.907,"So, then that was (Inaudible)?"
