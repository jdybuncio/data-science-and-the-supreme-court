1991.90-848,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,11.439,"We'll hear argument now in No. 90-848, Kenneth Hilton v. South Carolina Public Railways Commission."
1991.90-848,0,38817,robert_j_beckham,,63.622,69.275,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1991.90-848,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,362.908,367.609,xxx suit would not lie in the Federal court.
1991.90-848,0,38817,robert_j_beckham,,367.609,369.394,"Your Honor, that's true."
1991.90-848,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,380.833,386.32,"So this statute wasn't specific enough to do away with the Eleventh Amendment, but--"
1991.90-848,0,38817,robert_j_beckham,,386.32,387.937,That was the holding in the Welch decision.
1991.90-848,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,387.937,399.794,"--But you think it's specific enough to overcome the usual rule that you... Federal statute that if it's going to bind, the State ought to be pretty specific."
1991.90-848,0,38817,robert_j_beckham,,399.794,402.113,I think it's specific enough.
1991.90-848,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,474.359,478.144,"You say it's not a waiver you're relying on, Mr. Beckham."
1991.90-848,0,38817,robert_j_beckham,,478.144,480.512,"--I have a hard time, Mr. Chief Justice--"
1991.90-848,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,480.512,481.08,I know--
1991.90-848,0,38817,robert_j_beckham,,481.08,482.964,--understanding whether its a waiver or a surrender.
1991.90-848,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,486.999,493.153,"--A waiver, we have talked about in other cases, being a conscious surrender of a knowing right or something."
1991.90-848,0,38817,robert_j_beckham,,495.153,496.521,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, I am."
1991.90-848,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,496.521,497.021,You are?
1991.90-848,0,38817,robert_j_beckham,,497.021,512.198,"In the statutory enactments that I referred to, the South Carolina court... excuse me... legislature... the South Carolina legislature, expressly acknowledges the existence of Federal regulatory bodies to which its railroad will be subservient."
1991.90-848,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,512.198,514.732,But not FELA.
1991.90-848,0,38817,robert_j_beckham,,514.732,516.933,They didn't specify FELA.
1991.90-848,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,517.683,523.837,"Well, does that show that they knew of the right, that is that they knew that they weren't subject to it unless they said they were?"
1991.90-848,0,38817,robert_j_beckham,,523.837,525.372,I don't think so at all.
1991.90-848,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,525.372,528.124,So that it's not a waiver in the classic sense you're talking about.
1991.90-848,0,38817,robert_j_beckham,,528.124,533.361,"Regrettably, in this case, we were pretermitted at the lower level before getting a lot of discovery."
1991.90-848,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,547.538,552.006,What theory did Parden proceed on?
1991.90-848,0,38817,robert_j_beckham,,560.344,564.831,"--Mr. Justice, first of all, the Court did say that when the Congress said every, it meant every."
1991.90-848,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,567.867,570.383,And there's no question that there was a common carrier involved.
1991.90-848,0,38817,robert_j_beckham,,570.383,570.966,No question.
1991.90-848,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,570.966,575.251,The only question was that the State owned it.
1991.90-848,0,38817,robert_j_beckham,,575.251,576.301,That is exactly--
1991.90-848,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,576.301,577.703,Is that the theory the Court proceeded on?
1991.90-848,0,38817,robert_j_beckham,,577.703,578.22,--That's one.
1991.90-848,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,636.288,646.061,So what happens to your argument as a result of the treatment of Parden in our Welch decision... or decisions?
1991.90-848,0,38817,robert_j_beckham,,646.061,652.965,"--In your Welch decision, Mr. Chief Justice, five members of the Court said FELA survives."
1991.90-848,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,677.532,686.055,"Well, just assume that the FELA applied... would apply to the States, I guess."
1991.90-848,0,38817,robert_j_beckham,,689.507,698.529,"Well, there's no Eleventh Amendment problem in State court until you get to the gloss on the Eleventh Amendment."
1991.90-848,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,709.469,723.811,"But there is a certain irony, and maybe it's self-engendered as a result of our opinions, that Congress would pass a statute regulating a liability of railroads to their employees."
1991.90-848,0,38817,robert_j_beckham,,731.5,736.238,This irony only arises because of the Welch decision.
1991.90-848,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,736.238,739.356,"Well, you have to deal with the Welch decision."
1991.90-848,0,38817,robert_j_beckham,,739.356,739.906,No question about it.
1991.90-848,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,740.506,741.373,Or because of Parden.
1991.90-848,0,38817,robert_j_beckham,,742.225,745.677,--The irony was not created by Parden.
1991.90-848,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,806.929,821.938,"--Well, how do you distinguish Will against Michigan, then, where the Court did say that to abrogate State sovereign immunity, at least a clear statement by Congress is required."
1991.90-848,0,38817,robert_j_beckham,,821.938,832.794,"I think that it is difficult... if you look to the history, it is difficult to say that this case, and this is what the South Carolina Supreme Court said, of course."
1991.90-848,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,855.541,860.611,At least Will just said a State wasn't a person at all.
1991.90-848,0,38817,robert_j_beckham,,860.611,862.646,"That was an easy distinction, right."
1991.90-848,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,864.262,870.466,But the question... there's no question here of what there is a common carrier by railroad involved.
1991.90-848,0,38817,robert_j_beckham,,870.466,871.166,--That's right.
1991.90-848,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,883.024,895.284,I suppose the statute at least means that every owner of a railroad engaged in interstate commerce is covered by the FELA.
1991.90-848,0,38817,robert_j_beckham,,895.284,896.851,--It certainly seems so to us.
1991.90-848,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1025.111,1027.73,"Very well, Mr. Beckham."
1991.90-848,1,33982,keating_l_simons_iii,,1029.93,1035.8,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1991.90-848,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1088.118,1102.211,Are you questioning the power of Congress to subject a State-owned railroad to the FELA if it said so expressly?
1991.90-848,1,33982,keating_l_simons_iii,,1102.211,1111.967,We have not found occasion in this case to directly challenge the power of Congress to create a personal injury liability.
1991.90-848,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1111.967,1113.919,So as the case comes to use we assume that that--
1991.90-848,1,33982,keating_l_simons_iii,,1113.919,1115.053,Absolutely.
1991.90-848,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1124.024,1127.393,"--Well, so far, Parden hasn't been overruled in that respect."
1991.90-848,1,33982,keating_l_simons_iii,,1127.393,1128.428,"That's correct, sir."
1991.90-848,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1132.297,1147.907,"Well, do you take the position that in the absence of a clear statement we have to assume that FELA does not apply at all to State-owned railroads?"
1991.90-848,1,33982,keating_l_simons_iii,,1147.907,1149.759,Absolutely.
1991.90-848,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1150.925,1155.311,How do you reconcile Feeney and the Port Authority case?
1991.90-848,1,33982,keating_l_simons_iii,,1155.311,1160.615,--The issues just simply weren't directly raised in the way that the issue has come before the Court today.
1991.90-848,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1195.871,1206.762,"Well, there was certainly an assumption in Feeney that the statute covered all railroads, and the States could waive any sovereign immunity."
1991.90-848,1,33982,keating_l_simons_iii,,1206.762,1226.592,"--The difficulty I have with the waiver analysis that counsel has argued is that... I believe it was in Howlett v. Rose, and perhaps other cases as well... in which the comment was made that one cannot consent to the applicability of a cause of action that doesn't apply to them."
1991.90-848,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1274.24,1277.025,May I ask about the statutory construction?
1991.90-848,1,33982,keating_l_simons_iii,,1284.779,1287.398,That certainly would have sufficed for our purposes.
1991.90-848,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1287.398,1293.452,"And so... without that language, you're saying it isn't clear Congress intended to subject States to this statute."
1991.90-848,1,33982,keating_l_simons_iii,,1305.509,1310.746,Those statutes are very different from the FELA in that they are regulatory statutes.
1991.90-848,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1311.629,1314.365,But don't you need a clear statement of relief there?
1991.90-848,1,33982,keating_l_simons_iii,,1314.365,1316.65,--Well--
1991.90-848,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1316.65,1318.9,The Federal Safety Appliance Act provides for a cause of action.
1991.90-848,1,33982,keating_l_simons_iii,,1321.483,1335.243,"--It's my understanding that the Safety Appliance Act does not directly create a cause of action and that the practice is that a violation of the Safety Appliance Act is used almost as negligence, per se, in FELA action."
1991.90-848,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1339.563,1342.681,Really I'm asking do you think those statutes apply to State-owned railroads?
1991.90-848,1,33982,keating_l_simons_iii,,1342.681,1349.752,I think that Congress has the power to--
1991.90-848,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1349.752,1350.002,I understand that.
1991.90-848,1,33982,keating_l_simons_iii,,1362.81,1364.476,--I do not believe they should.
1991.90-848,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1372.331,1378.168,"And you don't think the words ""every common carrier by railroad"" would let a State know that their railroads were also intended to be covered."
1991.90-848,1,33982,keating_l_simons_iii,,1378.168,1386.507,--The decisions of this Court have repeatedly said that States are different; they are entitled to be treated with greater deference and greater respect than any other employer.
1991.90-848,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1386.507,1389.709,Had any case said that at the time that you entered into the railroad business?
1991.90-848,1,33982,keating_l_simons_iii,,1389.709,1398.564,Even Parden referred to the special status of States.
1991.90-848,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1400.731,1402.016,You surely wouldn't win under Parden.
1991.90-848,1,33982,keating_l_simons_iii,,1402.016,1402.716,--Absolutely not.
1991.90-848,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1402.716,1408.953,Is there any case that supports your position that was decided before you went into the railroad business?
1991.90-848,1,33982,keating_l_simons_iii,,1408.953,1411.655,"Not directly, no, sir."
1991.90-848,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1411.655,1418.642,How do you suppose Congress was supposed to know they needed a clear statement of the kind you describe?
1991.90-848,1,33982,keating_l_simons_iii,,1418.642,1430.883,"The simple answer to that is that at the time the FELA was passed, I don't believe it ever occurred to Congress that they had the power to subject the State of South Carolina to a damages liability in its own courts."
1991.90-848,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1488.738,1491.138,"Parden held, isn't it?"
1991.90-848,1,33982,keating_l_simons_iii,,1491.138,1492.957,"--Yes, sir."
1991.90-848,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1494.174,1496.576,That hasn't been overruled that the--
1991.90-848,1,33982,keating_l_simons_iii,,1496.576,1496.992,"--No, sir."
1991.90-848,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1498.692,1501.294,"--Yeah, that's... you're certainly asking us at least that much."
1991.90-848,1,33982,keating_l_simons_iii,,1501.294,1501.694,Absolutely.
1991.90-848,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1547.759,1557.948,"If we rule in your favor, are there any actions under State law that the employee can bring their injuries in the course of employment?"
1991.90-848,1,33982,keating_l_simons_iii,,1561.601,1581.746,"The petitioner filed, after the trial judge's order dismissing the FELA claim, an amended complaint that asserted remedies in negligence, asserted remedies in under the Tort Claims Act, asserted remedies under the... what we call the little FELA, which is the South Carolina version of FELA."
1991.90-848,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1582.765,1587.3,Do you concede that all of those statutes are applicable and all of those theories are applicable to the railroad?
1991.90-848,1,33982,keating_l_simons_iii,,1587.3,1592.204,"--The fourth one, that I was about to mention, Your Honor, is where I believe petitioner has his avenue."
1991.90-848,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1603.428,1608.38,And your position is that only the workman's comp statute is applicable?
1991.90-848,1,33982,keating_l_simons_iii,,1608.38,1613.534,"I believe that at the end of the day, that is what the South Carolina Supreme Court will hold."
1991.90-848,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1616.503,1618.855,"Well, what is your... do you have a position that it's applicable or not?"
1991.90-848,1,33982,keating_l_simons_iii,,1618.855,1621.105,--I don't have a position today.
1991.90-848,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1630.311,1642.268,"So it is possible, at least, that you could take the position that the worker is not entitled to any recovery until the South Carolina legislature acts?"
1991.90-848,1,33982,keating_l_simons_iii,,1642.268,1645.772,That is conceivable that the commission could take that position.
1991.90-848,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1673.323,1678.56,Can you tell us or does the record show how many employees there are of the State-owned railroad?
1991.90-848,1,33982,keating_l_simons_iii,,1678.56,1680.594,Throughout the country or ours?
1991.90-848,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1680.594,1681.511,In yours.
1991.90-848,1,33982,keating_l_simons_iii,,1681.511,1683.094,In the order of a couple of dozen.
1991.90-848,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1697.354,1711.113,"Don't you think that the... whether or not the FELA covers the... includes a State, really doesn't have much to do with the State's sovereign immunity."
1991.90-848,1,33982,keating_l_simons_iii,,1732.192,1736.494,FELA wouldn't apply.
1991.90-848,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1736.494,1737.311,Of course.
1991.90-848,1,33982,keating_l_simons_iii,,1741.465,1741.982,"No, sir."
1991.90-848,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1748.702,1749.069,That's right.
1991.90-848,1,33982,keating_l_simons_iii,,1749.069,1752.321,So I don't see this as a consent case at all.
1991.90-848,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1786.994,1794.683,"Yeah, but what if we say that every railroad, every common carrier by railroad means what it says."
1991.90-848,1,33982,keating_l_simons_iii,,1805.575,1812.228,--I believe that that would be very difficult to do and reconcile with recent cases as to what it takes--
1991.90-848,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1812.228,1813.328,I didn't ask you that.
1991.90-848,1,33982,keating_l_simons_iii,,1818.215,1818.832,"--Yes, sir."
1991.90-848,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1829.438,1830.638,"To what, for example?"
1991.90-848,1,33982,keating_l_simons_iii,,1834.842,1851.367,--I think that I've not seen a case yet that found an abrogation of Eleventh Amendment immunity that did not expressly refer to States or governmental units or public funded or some words that showed Congress actually considered the point.
1991.90-848,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1851.367,1868.646,Can you say the same about... can you say the same in a non-Eleventh Amendment case as to... do you think that a State has never been held liable under a statute that doesn't expressly... a Federal statute that doesn't expressly refer to a State?
1991.90-848,1,33982,keating_l_simons_iii,,1874.067,1880.286,That was a regulatory statute to the best of my recollection.
1991.90-848,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1880.286,1880.82,"Well, what's that got to do with it?"
1991.90-848,1,33982,keating_l_simons_iii,,1880.82,1889.726,Because I think there's a very grave difference between regulating a State's conduct of its activities in the equivalent of a prospective fashion.
1991.90-848,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1889.726,1890.944,How about the Jones Act?
1991.90-848,1,33982,keating_l_simons_iii,,1890.944,1895.63,I think the Jones Act and FELA stand in the same... stand in the same shoes.
1991.90-848,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1895.63,1900.867,"Well, so we have to overrule the Jones Act cases, too."
1991.90-848,1,33982,keating_l_simons_iii,,1900.867,1901.367,"Yes, sir."
1991.90-848,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1915.06,1932.255,"Well, but if, I suppose the FELA argument for coverage would be stronger than the Jones Act because it says ""every common carrier""."
1991.90-848,1,33982,keating_l_simons_iii,,1932.255,1935.79,I think I'd probably agree with you.
1991.90-848,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1941.694,1951.3,"Well, what language does the Jones Act use, if you happen to know, about the defendant?"
1991.90-848,1,33982,keating_l_simons_iii,,1955.418,1958.287,I don't believe that potential defendants are described at all.
1991.90-848,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1963.108,1964.974,It doesn't say xxx may sue?
1991.90-848,1,33982,keating_l_simons_iii,,1964.974,1969.762,--I don't know.
1991.90-848,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1969.762,1970.628,It's not directly involved in it.
1991.90-848,1,33982,keating_l_simons_iii,,1970.628,1990.089,There are essentially four reasons why the South Carolina Public Railways Commission believes that the clear statement rule applies to the statutory interpretation issue at hand.
1991.90-848,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2118.64,2142.105,"At least there's this difference, and that is that sovereign immunity insofar as... granted that the background of it existed both with respect to suit in the State's own courts and with respect to suit in the Federal courts, the background existed for both, but that background was codified in the Eleventh Amendment as to one and was not codified in the Eleventh Amendment as to the other, I suppose."
1991.90-848,1,33982,keating_l_simons_iii,,2142.105,2143.438,--That's absolutely correct.
1991.90-848,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2143.438,2144.688,Isn't that a significant difference?
1991.90-848,1,33982,keating_l_simons_iii,,2144.688,2145.604,"No, sir."
1991.90-848,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2170.469,2173.504,"Well, there's a gloss and there is a total repainting."
1991.90-848,1,33982,keating_l_simons_iii,,2177.039,2179.325,I respectfully disagree.
1991.90-848,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2193.766,2200.989,"Well, there is an additional State interest in not having to subject itself to the jurisdiction of another sovereign and having to try cases in a Federal court."
1991.90-848,1,33982,keating_l_simons_iii,,2205.107,2209.309,"--Well, I don't know that that's necessarily... I'm sure you're right."
1991.90-848,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2321.697,2338.258,"Well, in the Welch case it said the act involve there didn't apply, that the State was immune from suit in Federal court under the Eleventh Amendment."
1991.90-848,1,33982,keating_l_simons_iii,,2347.447,2349.03,"No, sir."
1991.90-848,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2353.351,2356.201,"Well, they disposed of it on Eleventh Amendment grounds."
1991.90-848,1,33982,keating_l_simons_iii,,2356.201,2356.936,Correct.
1991.90-848,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2356.936,2365.742,There's no... hardly any reason to do that if the Jones Act didn't cover it at all.
1991.90-848,1,33982,keating_l_simons_iii,,2365.742,2369.943,In my limited experience in litigating--
1991.90-848,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2369.943,2372.062,You always talk about jurisdiction first?
1991.90-848,1,33982,keating_l_simons_iii,,2372.062,2372.528,"--Yes, sir."
1991.90-848,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2459.786,2476.796,"Well, when Congress determines whether or not it's going to exercise its authority to expressly apply the act to a State, is it making a jurisdictional decision when it talks about the Eleventh Amendment?"
1991.90-848,1,33982,keating_l_simons_iii,,2476.796,2477.748,Yes.
1991.90-848,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2477.748,2485.485,"Well, why is it jurisdictional when it weighs the Eleventh Amendment but substantive when it determines whether or not it's going to apply to the State?"
1991.90-848,1,33982,keating_l_simons_iii,,2489.556,2495.792,Because the decision to make the State suable in Federal court implicates jurisdictional concerns.
1991.90-848,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2543.856,2552.878,What's your best case that says that every common carrier by railroad doesn't include a State-owned railroad?
1991.90-848,1,33982,keating_l_simons_iii,,2553.544,2556.496,"I suppose it is, yes, sir."
1991.90-848,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2563.048,2568.583,So you're saying the same rule has to apply as to whether or not the statute even covers the State.
1991.90-848,1,33982,keating_l_simons_iii,,2568.583,2569.833,"I believe it should, yes, sir."
1991.90-848,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2577.689,2580.741,"You think Welch is better for you than Will, don't you?"
1991.90-848,1,33982,keating_l_simons_iii,,2580.741,2584.759,"Well, reading them together, I believe I win."
1991.90-848,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2605.672,2612.576,"I know, but not every reasonable person would think the word ""person"" includes a State, would you?"
1991.90-848,1,33982,keating_l_simons_iii,,2612.576,2620.032,"--I think it's just as reasonable to suppose that not every reasonable person would read the word ""common carrier""; which ordinarily applies--"
1991.90-848,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2620.032,2621.082,"No, but every common carrier."
1991.90-848,1,33982,keating_l_simons_iii,,2621.082,2623.468,"--Well, a State is not a common carrier."
1991.90-848,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2623.468,2627.622,"I know, but every common carrier... it's a railroad."
1991.90-848,1,33982,keating_l_simons_iii,,2627.622,2634.275,We have here State that is providing carriage of goods for a fee.
1991.90-848,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2657.141,2663.628,"Well, when was the... how long had railroads been regulated in 1908?"
1991.90-848,1,33982,keating_l_simons_iii,,2663.628,2665.861,"--I don't know, sir."
1991.90-848,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2665.861,2670.615,The Interstate Commerce Act of 1887 was the first Federal regulation.
1991.90-848,1,33982,keating_l_simons_iii,,2674.935,2675.968,"Yes, sir."
1991.90-848,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2740.942,2743.378,"Thank you, Mr. Simons."
1991.90-848,2,38817,robert_j_beckham,,2745.662,2753.316,"To answer one of the questions, the Jones Act borrows the language of the FELA."
1991.90-848,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2767.957,2772.211,"It doesn't describe the defendant any more that that, I take it."
1991.90-848,2,38817,robert_j_beckham,,2772.211,2775.162,It incorporates by reference the FELA.
1991.90-848,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2775.162,2776.429,"Well, I know, but in the course of--"
1991.90-848,2,38817,robert_j_beckham,,2776.429,2778.181,And that gets us back to any common carrier.
1991.90-848,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2778.181,2782.466,--It says in the course of his employment.
1991.90-848,2,38817,robert_j_beckham,,2783.482,2785.834,"The seaman's, the seaman's employment."
1991.90-848,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2785.834,2794.44,"I know, but I'm sure that both... a lot of the definitions of what a seaman is and what maritime employment is."
1991.90-848,2,38817,robert_j_beckham,,2794.44,2805.962,"And it says in such actions, all statutes of United States modifying or extending the common law right of remedy in case of personal injury to railway employees shall apply."
1991.90-848,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2807.498,2818.388,"Yeah, but is there any counterpart in the Jones Act to the language in the FELA that says ""every common carrier by railroad"", which names a class of potential defendant?"
1991.90-848,2,38817,robert_j_beckham,,2818.388,2820.471,"It is ""every employer of a seaman""."
1991.90-848,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2820.471,2822.34,Every employer of a seaman.
1991.90-848,2,38817,robert_j_beckham,,2822.34,2825.958,They just borrow the statute entirely.
1991.90-848,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3315.47,3317.404,"Thank you, Mr. Beckham."
