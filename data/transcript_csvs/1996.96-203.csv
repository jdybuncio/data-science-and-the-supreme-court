1996.96-203,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.856,"We'll hear argument now in Number 96-203, Joyce Johnson v. The United States."
1996.96-203,0,46262,william_j_sheppard,,12.459,15.701,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1996.96-203,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,89.601,95.475,"Mr. Sheppard, the element was still in the case."
1996.96-203,0,46262,william_j_sheppard,,122.792,147.188,"Justice Ginsburg, we agree that the element was there and the Government had the duty to prove it, albeit a footnote under Eleventh Circuit precedent was questionable as to what the standard of proof was, but I submit that when a lawyer gets a case, what he does, he looks to see what are the elements of the case, and I think that's the first thing that a lawyer does."
1996.96-203,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,179.679,191.76,"Well, for example, could you show us what trial counsel might have made of the materiality of these statements were the matter tried to a jury?"
1996.96-203,0,46262,william_j_sheppard,,191.76,193.259,"Yes, ma'am, I believe I can."
1996.96-203,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,257.981,266.817,"Well, the Eleventh Circuit certainly didn't... doesn't agree with your precedent... they said after reviewing the record in this case, we find overwhelming evidence of the materiality of Johnson's statement."
1996.96-203,0,46262,william_j_sheppard,,274.291,277.183,"I agree that that's what they said, Mr. Chief Justice."
1996.96-203,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,302.591,312.646,"They're not... they may have said that, they may not have, but I was simply reading what they said about the evidence of materiality, which was what you were talking about."
1996.96-203,0,46262,william_j_sheppard,,319.181,321.702,I'm not here to argue that this was a thin case.
1996.96-203,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,345.207,350.891,"No, every day of the week it's a common thing for a judge to misinstruct a jury on an element of a defense."
1996.96-203,0,46262,william_j_sheppard,,350.891,351.943,This is not a--
1996.96-203,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,351.943,358.798,In which case the jury has not considered whether or not the person did or did not commit that element.
1996.96-203,0,46262,william_j_sheppard,,371.614,373.858,"--In two respects, Justice Breyer."
1996.96-203,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,381.502,384.414,"Well, that's true, but so what is the difference?"
1996.96-203,0,46262,william_j_sheppard,,390.347,390.868,"Well, it's--"
1996.96-203,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,390.868,397.523,"In other cases misinstructions are disastrous, but... so how... is that... why should we draw that line?"
1996.96-203,0,46262,william_j_sheppard,,397.523,446.064,"--Well, if I could go back to your earlier question to answer it first, sir, the second thing that is different in this case than just a misinstruction on an element, in addition to totally omitting it, the Eleventh Circuit pattern jury instruction number 43, which was taken from cases, and that's found in the Joint Appendix, Your Honor, at page 67, that instruction, which was taken from precedent of the old... of the Fifth Circuit, prior to Congress creating the Eleventh Circuit and carrying over the precedent of the Fifth to the Eleventh provided, and this jury was indeed instructed, that the materiality of the matter involved in the alleged false testimony is not a matter with which you are concerned, but rather is a question for the court to decide."
1996.96-203,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,479.636,501.761,"Well, it's also true, is it not, counsel... isn't it true that in this trial, when the Government tried to put on evidence of materiality before the jury and the court, that the petitioner's own trial lawyer wouldn't allow it on the grounds that it was for the judge."
1996.96-203,0,46262,william_j_sheppard,,501.761,502.28,"--Well, absolutely."
1996.96-203,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,502.28,505.182,"Who said, absolutely keep that evidence out of here."
1996.96-203,0,46262,william_j_sheppard,,505.182,524.817,"And even before the trial, trial counsel was filing motions in limine because trial counsel and the lawyers who try these cases, we believe in precedent, and we believe that when you're in the face of longstanding precedent, that it is not principled lawyering to waste time making frivolous objections--"
1996.96-203,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,524.817,535.713,"Well, could invited error in some case defeat the petitioner's subsequent claim if the petitioner himself had said, you may not consider materiality?"
1996.96-203,0,46262,william_j_sheppard,,535.713,542.658,--I don't think in the face of 50 years of precedent in that circuit that that would be the appropriate way to handle it.
1996.96-203,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,543.968,548.891,I would have thought that invited error could defeat such a claim.
1996.96-203,0,46262,william_j_sheppard,,552.554,572.947,"--No, ma'am, and I believe that the Solicitor General has indicated that it doesn't urge that position, but I still... even if they did, I don't think invited error can be invited without waiver or stipulation, and there wasn't."
1996.96-203,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,596.952,601.437,"But the judge has to make a materiality determination, and it's relevant to the judge's determination."
1996.96-203,0,46262,william_j_sheppard,,607.999,611.172,"Well, you know, from reading the cases, Justice Kennedy, that's a good question."
1996.96-203,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,643.273,659.012,"Well, to be frank, I guess what's troubling us is that if you had a really strong materiality case the evidence would have come in and you would have argued it either before the judge with the jury absent or with the jury present, and an instruction to the jury that this is not really of their concern."
1996.96-203,0,46262,william_j_sheppard,,659.012,660.923,"--Well, respectfully--"
1996.96-203,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,660.923,674.153,"It's just a little hard for us to grasp the plain error aspect, reversible error aspect in this case when we didn't think the materiality was at question either before the judge or the jury, even under this wall of precedent."
1996.96-203,0,46262,william_j_sheppard,,674.153,681.597,"--Well, but respectfully, the wrong entity is judging the defendant guilty."
1996.96-203,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,713.67,718.783,Is it your position that there simply couldn't be any harmless error analysis in this situation?
1996.96-203,0,46262,william_j_sheppard,,718.783,722.616,--There is nothing for harmless error analysis to attach to.
1996.96-203,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,725.749,728.299,"Well, there is a jury verdict finding the person guilty."
1996.96-203,0,46262,william_j_sheppard,,728.299,736.365,"--Well, but it's not a valid jury verdict if it's only three-quarters of what the Constitution in the history of our country says to us we have."
1996.96-203,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,736.365,751.594,"Well, but there is a valid jury verdict on the other elements, and it could be possible, could it not, that as we've said in some of our earlier cases, the jury that found elements 1, 2, and 3, would necessarily have found element 4?"
1996.96-203,0,46262,william_j_sheppard,,757.838,758.778,Well--
1996.96-203,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,758.778,770.536,"I mean, when the jury has never been given a... an instruction as to what is, you know, beyond a reasonable doubt, which is what one of our earlier cases involved, then you have a jury that said nothing at all."
1996.96-203,0,46262,william_j_sheppard,,778.112,783.374,"--I don't think so in a directed verdict case, as we have here, or a partial directed verdict."
1996.96-203,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,793.382,794.652,Who asked for that instruction?
1996.96-203,0,46262,william_j_sheppard,,794.652,798.275,Both the defense and the Government.
1996.96-203,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,879.366,891.207,"Mr. Sheppard, sometimes evidence on a particular element is so strong that the defendant would rather not have the jury confront that element, and we had such a case this term."
1996.96-203,0,46262,william_j_sheppard,,891.207,892.125,I'm familiar with Old Chief.
1996.96-203,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,892.125,913.76,"So if we're told that the element, at least the Eleventh Circuit thought that the proof was overwhelming, and we have a trial record where the defense counsel is saying, please, judge, don't say the word materiality to the jury, how do we know that this case isn't--"
1996.96-203,0,46262,william_j_sheppard,,913.76,920.933,Because you're the wrong entity to be making that decision.
1996.96-203,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1004.651,1015.398,"--I don't think anyone disputes the importance of the jury trial, but where I'm... my difficulty is that there are only a handful of things that this Court has said is a structural right, just a handful."
1996.96-203,0,46262,william_j_sheppard,,1015.398,1015.718,"--Yes, sir."
1996.96-203,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1015.718,1035.71,"And I don't find anywhere in that handful in any of the case law, though I grant you it's somewhat open, though I think in the Roy... we removed it in the habeas context and made clear it wasn't structural in that context, so why should it be structural the fact that the judge decided a matter that the jury should have decided?"
1996.96-203,0,46262,william_j_sheppard,,1053.762,1065.008,"Well, in order to rule for the Government, you'd have to go along with the Eleventh Circuit, which is to say we're not going to grant relief here because counsel didn't object."
1996.96-203,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1068.441,1072.765,"--What I'm looking for, actually, is the miscarriage of justice kind of standard here."
1996.96-203,0,46262,william_j_sheppard,,1074.425,1081.161,"--Well, the constitutional right to a jury trial embodies a profound judgment about the way in which the law should be enforced and justice administered."
1996.96-203,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1083.462,1097.25,"Mr. Sheppard, but we know that all kinds of things go wrong in jury trials, and judges give the most opaque charges, that you could look at the jury and they don't know what the heck the judge is talking about, and we accept that."
1996.96-203,0,46262,william_j_sheppard,,1097.25,1101.634,"Well, certainly we do, because that's our system, and it is--"
1996.96-203,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1124.529,1131.334,"Mr. Sheppard, let me test whether you think this thing is structural in the narrow sense that our opinions have used it."
1996.96-203,0,46262,william_j_sheppard,,1198.116,1201.779,Probably not.
1996.96-203,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1201.779,1203.081,"Well, then, it's not structural."
1996.96-203,0,46262,william_j_sheppard,,1205.512,1208.755,"Well, but it is... knowing is different than materiality."
1996.96-203,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1244.358,1245.487,"Yes, but your client--"
1996.96-203,0,46262,william_j_sheppard,,1253.623,1256.307,I think it's a total denial of the right to a jury trial.
1996.96-203,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1256.307,1258.947,"Well, then you should answer no to Justice Scalia on that one, I think."
1996.96-203,0,46262,william_j_sheppard,,1258.947,1260.559,"And I appreciate your correction, Your Honor."
1996.96-203,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1260.769,1264.052,"No, but if you... the trouble with answering no--"
1996.96-203,0,46262,william_j_sheppard,,1295.702,1297.605,"Well, I agree with that."
1996.96-203,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1328.294,1336.828,"Well, yes, but so you're saying it's better to ignore an element completely than it is to have a finding on an element if the finding is a nonjury finding."
1996.96-203,0,46262,william_j_sheppard,,1336.828,1340.451,--I think all elements must be found by a jury.
1996.96-203,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1343.633,1352.379,"Then why shouldn't your answer have been different on the knowing example, because in the knowing example the jury never made a finding of knowingly, never thought about it."
1996.96-203,0,46262,william_j_sheppard,,1352.379,1363.446,"--I think our case is stronger simply because of the affirmative direction of the verdict, of the partial verdict."
1996.96-203,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1386.03,1390.975,"But you see the problem I'm actually having, suppose he told the jury, jury, you know what materiality means?"
1996.96-203,0,46262,william_j_sheppard,,1397.938,1404.002,"--If I'd have had the opportunity to argue it to a jury, no one can say that I could not have prevailed, or that Ms. Johnson could not--"
1996.96-203,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1404.002,1410.557,"He just... really, he says what materiality is, jury, is that materiality means, well, it has something to do with it, a little bit."
1996.96-203,0,46262,william_j_sheppard,,1429.68,1430.58,--I would--
1996.96-203,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1430.58,1433.54,"And if we accept your view, we're right in the middle of it."
1996.96-203,0,46262,william_j_sheppard,,1434.882,1440.286,"--Well, I think you have to draw the line, because I think that's the way these cases, these post Gaudin cases are going to come through the system."
1996.96-203,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1494.272,1495.902,"--Very well, Mr. Sheppard."
1996.96-203,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1496.754,1502.988,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1996.96-203,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1605.724,1620.364,"Mr. Dreeben, I take it that in the Ninth Circuit and maybe some other circuit also the court of appeals rule is that you don't have to make a Rule 30 instruction when it would be futile if you've got clear circuit precedent in point going the other way?"
1996.96-203,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1620.364,1644.62,"Justice Ginsburg, I think what the Ninth Circuit did in its Keys decision in stating the principle that you just articulated is actually to simply say, we allow people to raise claims as if they were preserved error, even if there were no objection, not actually that defense counsel are instructed, don't object."
1996.96-203,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1668.797,1677.853,What would your approach be to the case if this case were tried before the Ninth Circuit came out with its decision before cert was applied for here?
1996.96-203,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1683.746,1687.126,"--I think it makes no difference whatsoever, Justice Kennedy."
1996.96-203,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1687.126,1688.478,I thought that's what your answer would be.
1996.96-203,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1688.478,1689.709,The reason is this.
1996.96-203,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1744.285,1752.029,"Well, at least in the regime that we're hypothesizing, where there's no... I think the trial judge would have been quite amazed at the request."
1996.96-203,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1752.029,1759.865,"--Well, I don't think that the trial judge would have been amazed at the request at the time that this trial took place in 1995."
1996.96-203,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1759.865,1761.146,"Well, I'm talking about our hypothetical."
1996.96-203,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1761.146,1771.044,"Talking about the hypothetical, there are plenty of examples where petitioners have preserved claims in the trial court, brought them up to this Court, and won by overruling Supreme Court precedent."
1996.96-203,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1771.044,1775.055,Would that trial judge have been able to grant the request?
1996.96-203,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1775.055,1775.376,No.
1996.96-203,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1779.109,1782.911,So you're saying he must make a request which he knows cannot be granted.
1996.96-203,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1782.911,1784.02,--Correct.
1996.96-203,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1784.02,1785.452,A strange position.
1996.96-203,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1785.452,1791.527,"Well, I think that it's not strange at all because it shows, Justice Scalia, one that it's important to this petitioner, which is of value in itself."
1996.96-203,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1812.552,1815.894,"Well, that seems a bit odd, Mr. Dreeben."
1996.96-203,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1826.77,1843.129,"--You would not necessarily do it differently, Chief Justice Rehnquist, but it would show what, if any, theory the petitioner had that she wanted to present to the jury, and in this case there was no demonstration of what the petitioner would have done differently."
1996.96-203,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1846.592,1851.375,How does the doctrine of invited error fit into this whole picture?
1996.96-203,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1851.375,1866.825,"Well, I think, Justice O'Connor, that had the Government made and preserved a claim of invited error that might well be the correct way for this case to be resolved under cases such as Johnson v. The United States in 318 U.S.--"
1996.96-203,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1866.825,1870.578,Did the Government here at no point raise that question?
1996.96-203,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1870.578,1872.609,--We did not argue invited error in the court of appeals.
1996.96-203,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1886.51,1888.831,And that was before the case became final.
1996.96-203,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1888.831,1911.565,"--Correct, so petitioner is entitled to say that based on this Court's intervening precedent error occurred, and then the question becomes how do you analyze the consequences of that, and our submission is that the text of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure themselves require that it be analyzed as plain error unless we had had available to us an invited error argument and had made it, which we did not."
1996.96-203,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1964.069,1969.404,"But didn't those cases turn heavily on the fact there was collateral review, and here you're on direct review."
1996.96-203,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1969.404,1998.172,"Well, yes, Justice Stevens, those cases are on collateral review, but I think the point is that the Court thought that there are benefits to requiring a party to object before the relevant tribunal with power to decide even if on-point governing law at the time was adverse, and it did not carve out, even in an exercise of its discretionary authority, an exception from the procedural default rule for claims that would be perceived as futile."
1996.96-203,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2020.286,2027.161,"I have a hard time imagining, or understanding how your rule would play out."
1996.96-203,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2038.578,2053.257,"Well, Justice Kennedy, we too are concerned not with attorneys who would want to try to preserve every conceivable claim in the chance that some day the court might reverse it."
