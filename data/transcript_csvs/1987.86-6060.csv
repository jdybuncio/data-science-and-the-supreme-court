1987.86-6060,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,56.587,"Mr. Bruck, you may proceed whenever you're ready."
1987.86-6060,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,56.587,60.289,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1987.86-6060,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,283.033,284.901,It did not cite Francis?
1987.86-6060,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,284.901,285.851,It cited nothing.
1987.86-6060,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,400.443,421.023,"Well, Mr. Bruck, if the South Carolina Supreme Court does not discriminate against Federal claims, does this Court have authority to tell that Court what retroactivity law to apply in a State habeas proceeding to you suppose?"
1987.86-6060,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,421.023,424.558,The difficulty is that the claim is a Federal one.
1987.86-6060,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,563.882,568.619,What if this Court were to adopt the Harlan view?
1987.86-6060,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,570.82,575.522,Not in this case because there is no retroactivity issue in this case.
1987.86-6060,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,582.859,584.711,"Because there was not a new decision, is that it?"
1987.86-6060,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,584.711,589.163,--Because Francis simply applied by its very terms simply applied doctrine of--
1987.86-6060,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,589.163,592.465,"But if we disagree with you on that, do you lose?"
1987.86-6060,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,592.465,601.737,"--If you disagree with me on that and decide to jettison the last 24 years of retroactivity and to jettison the Stovall, no, I don't believe so."
1987.86-6060,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,601.737,607.124,As we have already jettisoned a considerable part of it on the other side on direct appeal.
1987.86-6060,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,607.124,607.993,Yes.
1987.86-6060,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,630.823,635.894,Francis certainly changed an awful lot of things that had been regularly going on.
1987.86-6060,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,635.894,640.179,"--Well, that's true, I realize that would be debatable."
1987.86-6060,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,640.179,646.266,An awful lot of people didn't understand what bedrock due process was before Francis.
1987.86-6060,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,646.266,649.785,"Well, apparently so."
1987.86-6060,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,670.131,679.804,"Well, what if the Supreme Court of South Carolina had said in connection with its own State habeas that we're not going to entertain any challenges that go to jury instructions."
1987.86-6060,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,700.317,700.717,No.
1987.86-6060,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,702.052,702.802,I realize that.
1987.86-6060,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,702.802,709.256,I don't quarrel at all with the proposition that a State can limit its Federal remedy.
1987.86-6060,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,718.112,723.35,"No, but it would mean in their own State collateral review, they would not have to decide any claim."
1987.86-6060,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,729.07,732.872,"I have not thought about that, but I'm inclined to think that they could have done it."
1987.86-6060,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,732.872,734.741,I realize that is not what they did.
1987.86-6060,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,752.749,756.867,"Yes Sir, certainly, in this... in this... in this +/-"
1987.86-6060,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,756.867,757.884,Isn't that what we did in this case?
1987.86-6060,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,757.884,758.653,"Yes, Sir."
1987.86-6060,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,952.544,954.96,How about the Patterson case?
1987.86-6060,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,967.804,968.687,"Well, yes, that's true."
1987.86-6060,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1061.079,1071.787,You would say that Francis... any Francis-type case would be foreshadowed by Sandstrom?
1987.86-6060,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,1071.787,1072.787,"Yes, sir."
1987.86-6060,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1084.262,1093.718,"Well, the Court said in Francis that such inferences, permissive inferences do not necessarily implicate the concerns of Sandstrom."
1987.86-6060,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,1093.718,1094.051,Yes.
1987.86-6060,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1107.377,1116.416,"Well, why has the case been discussed in the South Carolina Courts as if it's the retroactivity of Francis v. Franklin rather than the retroactivity of Sandstrom?"
1987.86-6060,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,1116.416,1123.22,"Well, there'd be no issue of retroactivity of Sandstrom because Sandstrom occurred two years before this man's trial."
1987.86-6060,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1297.749,1299.116,I think that's probably true.
1987.86-6060,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,1303.22,1304.47,"I'm sorry, why should you?"
1987.86-6060,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1304.47,1314.409,"Yes, why should we, you know, if we agree with you on the rest, why shouldn't we just remand and give them a chance to determine whether they think it was harmless or not?"
1987.86-6060,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,1314.409,1315.628,That would suit me fine.
1987.86-6060,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1351.366,1352.418,"Thank you, Mr. Bruck."
1987.86-6060,2,20632,david_i_bruck,,2912.597,2914.299,If I might just briefly answer--
1987.86-6060,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2914.299,2916.668,Let me ask you one question if I may.
1987.86-6060,2,20632,david_i_bruck,,2928.142,2929.842,"--That is correct, there was none."
1987.86-6060,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2939.498,2944.485,What business was there raising it in the proceeding in this case?
1987.86-6060,2,20632,david_i_bruck,,2946.937,2951.072,This claim was brought in original--
1987.86-6060,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2951.072,2951.422,In the Supreme Court of South Carolina?
1987.86-6060,2,20632,david_i_bruck,,2951.422,2959.412,--original habeas jurisdiction of the South Carolina Supreme Court at the same time as the post conviction appeal was being heard.
1987.86-6060,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2969.4,2975.373,What was raised in that State collateral proceeding?
1987.86-6060,2,20632,david_i_bruck,,2975.373,2983.86,--The primary issue was improper jury argument which was also a matter which could have been raised.
1987.86-6060,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2983.86,2994.251,When was the Sandstrom Francis instruction issue first raised anywhere in the South Carolina courts?
1987.86-6060,2,20632,david_i_bruck,,2994.251,2999.322,"It was first raised in the original jurisdiction of the State Supreme Court in January, 1985."
1987.86-6060,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2999.322,3009.927,And I take it that the suggestion is that that claim was procedurally barred?
1987.86-6060,2,20632,david_i_bruck,,3009.927,3016.014,That is not a suggestion that can fairly be made on any basis in South Carolina law.
1987.86-6060,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3026.639,3037.614,"And I suppose that if there had been a procedural bar, the opinion in this case, they wouldn't have needed to go to all the trouble of writing an opinion in this case."
1987.86-6060,2,20632,david_i_bruck,,3040.316,3041.066,--Absolutely.
1987.86-6060,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3113.845,3131.124,"Well, what about what it says up here that this kind of State habeas proceeding is limited to the two little circumstances that are mentioned by Mr. Zelenka?"
1987.86-6060,2,20632,david_i_bruck,,3131.124,3133.409,I think it is only the State's brief that says that.
1987.86-6060,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3144.633,3167.313,"On page 34 of the Joint Appendix if I'm reading where I think Justice O'Connor was referring to, it says, collateral attack of a criminal conviction on the basis of legal precedent that developed after the conviction became final must be reserved for those cases in which the trial court's action was without jurisdiction, or is void because the defendant's conduct is not subject to criminal sanction."
1987.86-6060,2,20632,david_i_bruck,,3170.432,3171.301,"Yes, it is."
1987.86-6060,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3194.464,3204.505,"Are you saying that the law in South Carolina has changed since March, March 29, September 29, 1986, when this opinion issued?"
1987.86-6060,2,20632,david_i_bruck,,3204.505,3206.457,"No, I'm not."
1987.86-6060,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3233.941,3239.011,Would it be cognizable in this form of State habeas proceeding do you think?
1987.86-6060,2,20632,david_i_bruck,,3239.011,3240.795,There is no reason to believe otherwise.
1987.86-6060,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3240.795,3248.034,Despite its language saying it wouldn't be?
1987.86-6060,2,20632,david_i_bruck,,3248.034,3258.723,"They are... when they are speaking of collateral attack, they are referring equally to habeas and to the proceedings brought under the statutory procedure, the Uniform Post-Conviction."
1987.86-6060,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3366.194,3367.094,"Thank you, Mr. Bruck."
