1962.631,0,36239,melvin_s_louison,,26.838,31.098,"Mr. Chief Justice, Honorable Justices."
1962.631,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,180.186,181.31,You mean the Interview Report.
1962.631,0,36239,melvin_s_louison,,181.31,182.601,"The Interview Report, yes, Your Honor."
1962.631,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,182.601,185.08,"That's what we call it, was it in --"
1962.631,0,36239,melvin_s_louison,,185.08,186.057,I think --
1962.631,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,186.057,187.982,"When Campbell was here, we called it the Interview Report."
1962.631,0,36239,melvin_s_louison,,187.982,188.9,"Yes, sir."
1962.631,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,189.879,191.475,It's the one that's in the footnote?
1962.631,0,36239,melvin_s_louison,,191.475,195.048,"Yes, it was -- it was footnoted in the official opinion."
1962.631,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,199.623,199.819,No.
1962.631,0,36239,melvin_s_louison,,202.238,202.364,"Yes, sir."
1962.631,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,202.364,207.627,-- are you talking about that report which we said out verbatim in the footnote in Campbell?
1962.631,0,36239,melvin_s_louison,,207.627,209.733,"Yes, Your Honor."
1962.631,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,505.957,516.663,"You don't get to this question Mr. Louison, if in fact Judge Wyzanski was right that the Interview Report was producible either as a statement under (e) (1) or (e) (2), do you?"
1962.631,0,36239,melvin_s_louison,,516.663,522.717,Except in one instance Mr. Justice Brennan where it was stated in the Campbell case.
1962.631,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,522.717,537.942,"No, I mean, do we get to the question of the destruction and consequences of the destruction of the FBI agent's original notes if in fact Judge Wyzanski was right but you were entitled to the Interview Report as a statement under (e) (1) or (e) (2)?"
1962.631,0,36239,melvin_s_louison,,537.942,554.316,"Only reading from the Campbell case, Your Honor and the opinion says, “Does -- even if the Interview Report itself were producible, a situation might have arisen calling for decision whether subsection (d) of the statute required the striking of the testimony of the witness.”"
1962.631,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,565.462,574.929,"Well, I -- are you then suggesting that even though you are entitled to the report and not having had it therefore that there must be a new trial?"
1962.631,0,36239,melvin_s_louison,,574.929,575.817,"Yes, of course."
1962.631,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,575.817,588.305,That this -- has -- now to be decided also whether Staula is not to testify because the agent's original notes were destroyed?
1962.631,0,36239,melvin_s_louison,,588.305,590.012,"No, I don't say that."
1962.631,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,733.58,740.371,"Well, now Judge Wyzanski didn't quite make that finding, did he?"
1962.631,0,36239,melvin_s_louison,,768.376,770.744,Just -- may I say this?
1962.631,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,880.806,893.814,"I was just wondering, Mr. Louison, we do have findings, six of them. Judge Wyzanski based on all of the evidence of the merits."
1962.631,0,36239,melvin_s_louison,,898.424,899.248,I would say --
1962.631,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,899.248,907.287,"Apparently, the Court of Appeals seems to think it might, but is there a question here in how far even the Court of Appeals or indeed we may go back to those findings?"
1962.631,0,36239,melvin_s_louison,,907.287,908.518,"I would say so, Your Honor."
1962.631,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,908.518,908.836,It is?
1962.631,0,36239,melvin_s_louison,,908.836,909.683,I would say that the --
1962.631,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,909.683,910.601,"Well, what's your position?"
1962.631,0,36239,melvin_s_louison,,911.486,913.193,Should not go behind the (Voice Overlap) --
1962.631,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,913.193,916.068,That neither the Court of Appeals should nor should we?
1962.631,0,36239,melvin_s_louison,,916.068,917.899,"I would say that that is correct, Your Honor."
1962.631,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,917.899,923.326,"Well, if that's so, then it doesn't really help to go back into the testimony, does it?"
1962.631,0,36239,melvin_s_louison,,923.326,930.002,"That is -- well, except as you pointed out that finding number three on page 131 of the record."
1962.631,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,931.165,942.243,"That's a -- after -- I take it in the sense, these are findings of what we come to call historical facts, what happened in exactly the way it was done?"
1962.631,0,36239,melvin_s_louison,,942.243,942.884,Yes.
1962.631,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,942.884,944.592,In the taking of the Interview Report?
1962.631,0,36239,melvin_s_louison,,944.592,945.866,Yes.
1962.631,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,945.866,954.737,"Now if they're supported by evidence, should we go behind it?"
1962.631,0,36239,melvin_s_louison,,954.737,956.003,"No, Your Honor."
1962.631,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,989.052,997.416,"Well, how much of the proceedings before Judge McCarthy are now relevant to any question we have here?"
1962.631,0,36239,melvin_s_louison,,997.416,1019.171,"The Court of -- I would say, Your Honor, strictly academically, probably none, but except that the Court of Appeals in its conclusion when it said the decision of the District Court is affirmed and the convictions will stand, we're affirming the decision of Judge McCarthy and his entry of the judgments of conviction, and the sentences that went with it."
1962.631,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1024.16,1024.58,"Well, that's --"
1962.631,0,36239,melvin_s_louison,,1024.58,1025.984,And re-sentence the --
1962.631,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1025.984,1028.521,That's the fact that on the question whether -- on the questions --
1962.631,0,36239,melvin_s_louison,,1028.521,1029.05,The Act --
1962.631,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1029.05,1040.921,"-- you have brought here namely whether -- this indeed was a statement producible under (e) (1) or (e) (2), and secondly, the consequences of the destruction of the original notes."
1962.631,0,36239,melvin_s_louison,,1046.583,1050.941,"I would say no, Your Honor, not as you've stated it, certainly not?"
1962.631,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1050.941,1052.095,"Well, is that --"
1962.631,0,36239,melvin_s_louison,,1052.095,1052.191,Well --
1962.631,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1052.191,1052.811,I take it as I have stated it.
1962.631,0,36239,melvin_s_louison,,1052.811,1053.642,"I think, yes."
1962.631,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1053.642,1054.751,I'm trying to find out what --
1962.631,0,36239,melvin_s_louison,,1054.751,1055.123,Yes.
1962.631,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1064.183,1073.354,Although the Court of Appeals apparently seemed to have sent this back to Judge Wyzanski almost just as a master to make these findings --
1962.631,0,36239,melvin_s_louison,,1073.354,1073.984,"Well, I'm glad you used --"
1962.631,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1073.984,1076.088,-- submit a master's report or something like that.
1962.631,0,36239,melvin_s_louison,,1076.088,1080.152,"I'm glad you used that phrase, Your Honor, because I think they treated it as an equity appeal."
1962.631,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1088.4,1098.753,I'm having -- but we have to go through all these in every Jencks case.
1962.631,0,36239,melvin_s_louison,,1098.753,1108.935,"Well, if I may go to the word copy, Your Honors, it's very obvious that the original notes have been destroyed."
1962.631,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1201.426,1204.849,You don't think that it was used in the sense of counterpart.
1962.631,0,36239,melvin_s_louison,,1204.849,1205.394,Sir?
1962.631,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1205.394,1210.146,You don't think that in the opinion copy was used in the sense of counterpart?
1962.631,0,36239,melvin_s_louison,,1210.146,1211.272,I would say yes.
1962.631,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1223.978,1255.5,[Inaudible]
1962.631,0,36239,melvin_s_louison,,1255.5,1258.95,"You have not stated that anything was reduced to writing, Your Honor."
1962.631,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1258.95,1300.568,[Inaudible]
1962.631,0,36239,melvin_s_louison,,1300.568,1304.953,"Apparently, it is not producible Your Honor."
1962.631,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1304.953,1306.892,"But depends on who the witness is, doesn't it?"
1962.631,0,36239,melvin_s_louison,,1309.662,1318.2,"Well of course -- yes, under the -- yes, of course, if that were the -- if the witness were the agent that is so because I think that was ruled in the Clancy case."
1962.631,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1318.2,1319.168,"Well, that was clearly within it."
1962.631,0,36239,melvin_s_louison,,1319.168,1320.015,"Yes, of course."
1962.631,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1320.015,1321.73,If the agent is the witness we're talking about --
1962.631,0,36239,melvin_s_louison,,1321.73,1321.757,I'm sorry.
1962.631,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1321.757,1323.272,-- and then his statement is verbatim.
1962.631,0,36239,melvin_s_louison,,1323.272,1323.808,Absolutely.
1962.631,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1323.808,1325.395,And it's not a matter of being producible to me.
1962.631,0,36239,melvin_s_louison,,1328.179,1328.829,"Yes, the producibility --"
1962.631,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1328.829,1329.307,(Voice Overlap)
1962.631,0,36239,melvin_s_louison,,1329.307,1331.233,-- (Voice Overlap) the problem.

1962.631,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1421.491,1426.399,I think it would be more on [Inaudible] --
1962.631,0,36239,melvin_s_louison,,1426.399,1428.637,I really can't differentiate Your Honor.

1962.631,0,36239,melvin_s_louison,,1470.682,1476.412,"Well, of course we don't know how much time of that 30 minutes was used by the agent himself."
1962.631,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1485.184,1501.542,[Inaudible]
1962.631,0,36239,melvin_s_louison,,1501.542,1503.247,I would say yes.

1962.631,0,36239,melvin_s_louison,,1510.643,1515.194,I don't interpret it along the lines you're asking at all respectfully Your Honor.
1962.631,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1608.287,1609.552,Mr. O'Donnell.

1962.631,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2550.011,2551.705,I would hope not.

1962.631,2,15704,archibald_cox,,2567.569,2572.649,The Court felt that he had properly done all but one part of it.
