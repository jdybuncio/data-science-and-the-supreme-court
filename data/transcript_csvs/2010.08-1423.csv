2010.08-1423,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,10.206,"We will hear argument first this morning in Case 08-1423, Costco Wholesale Corporation v. Omega."
2010.08-1423,0,39136,roy_t_englert_jr,,11.706,14.926,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2010.08-1423,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,170.157,175.895,Would you clarify for me what your exact meaning is?
2010.08-1423,0,39136,roy_t_englert_jr,,181.565,183.267,"--I hope not, Your Honor."
2010.08-1423,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,183.984,197.51,"Your reply brief suggests that if Omega grants foreign reproduction and distribution rights but retains U.S. rights, that the first sale doctrine would allow Omega to bar importation."
2010.08-1423,0,39136,roy_t_englert_jr,,197.51,200.895,--If it grants exclusive foreign distribution.
2010.08-1423,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,200.895,202.028,Why does it matter?
2010.08-1423,0,39136,roy_t_englert_jr,,213.634,222.406,"It matters, Your Honor, because of the underlying rationale of the first sale doctrine and the underlying rationale of the import ban in section 602."
2010.08-1423,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,233.713,242.503,"So if he sells his rights to a foreign manufacturer and distributor, he gets paid for those rights."
2010.08-1423,0,39136,roy_t_englert_jr,,253.044,254.427,"The reason, Your--"
2010.08-1423,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,254.427,256.246,--from being imported into the United States?
2010.08-1423,0,39136,roy_t_englert_jr,,256.246,257.046,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2010.08-1423,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,257.913,261.131,I -- I don't understand what--
2010.08-1423,0,39136,roy_t_englert_jr,,261.131,267.284,--The reason is to give effect to the examples given in the legislative history of section 602.
2010.08-1423,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,267.284,272.505,--Not -- you mean to the examples in the legislative history or in the examples in Quality King?
2010.08-1423,0,39136,roy_t_englert_jr,,272.505,272.938,Oh.
2010.08-1423,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,287.432,297.906,So do you think that there is a difference between assigning a copyright to a foreign entity or merely licensing a foreign entity?
2010.08-1423,0,39136,roy_t_englert_jr,,304.41,306.428,"We don't draw a line between those two, Your Honor."
2010.08-1423,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,355.675,357.741,You are talking about the first sale doctrine.
2010.08-1423,0,39136,roy_t_englert_jr,,392.013,395.734,"--Well, Your Honor, since that's a -- a broader position than ours, and we would--"
2010.08-1423,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,395.734,402.653,"I know it is, but it -- the trouble with your position is it gets everybody, I think, going to be -- I mean, I don't know what all these contracts say."
2010.08-1423,0,39136,roy_t_englert_jr,,443.409,461.303,"--Well, the issue, Your Honor -- and you're putting me in a position of arguing against myself a little bit, but the issue is a fair reading of the legislative history of section 602 -- not the text, but the legislative history -- is that Congress did intend to allow certain blocking of imported goods when there had been--"
2010.08-1423,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,461.303,465.024,"Of course, if you say there has to be a first sale, there is no problem."
2010.08-1423,0,39136,roy_t_englert_jr,,477.999,480.717,"--Okay, Your Honor."
2010.08-1423,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,480.717,489.822,"I mean, no, I'm putting that to you, because since you haven't advocated it, I must be missing something, and I'm not an expert in copyright law."
2010.08-1423,0,39136,roy_t_englert_jr,,492.024,514.355,"Well, there is a dictum in this Court's opinion in Quality King that suggests that if a publisher and a -- an American publisher gives exclusive rights to a British publisher, if an American author or a British author gives exclusive territorial rights to two different publishers, then 602 retains meaning in that--"
2010.08-1423,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,514.355,518.409,"Exactly, and that's what it does under my theory, because there has been no first sale."
2010.08-1423,0,39136,roy_t_englert_jr,,518.409,526.313,"--No, but -- with respect, Your Honor, it's my understanding of both the legislative history and this Court's dictum that they refer to second and subsequent sales."
2010.08-1423,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,526.313,528.697,"Oh, you mean you are talking about jobbers?"
2010.08-1423,0,39136,roy_t_englert_jr,,546.976,549.361,"No, that's not what the example means."
2010.08-1423,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,576.161,578.113,Where do you get that in the text?
2010.08-1423,0,39136,roy_t_englert_jr,,592.707,593.557,"Yes, absolutely, Your Honor."
2010.08-1423,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,593.557,594.007,Where?
2010.08-1423,0,39136,roy_t_englert_jr,,595.423,604.598,"The other side's effort to read 602 broadly has no support in the text after Quality King, but--"
2010.08-1423,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,604.598,605.764,I'm talking about your--
2010.08-1423,0,39136,roy_t_englert_jr,,605.764,606.398,--I understand.
2010.08-1423,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,606.398,610.4,--your limitation on exclusive rights abroad versus nonexclusive rights abroad.
2010.08-1423,0,39136,roy_t_englert_jr,,612.752,613.168,You cannot.
2010.08-1423,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,613.168,614.035,Oh.
2010.08-1423,0,39136,roy_t_englert_jr,,615.618,617.718,Let us--
2010.08-1423,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,617.718,620.753,"I have to say, I didn't even see it in the legislative history."
2010.08-1423,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,627.137,635.41,"Mr. Englert, also talk about what, if anything, 602(a)(1) does, then."
2010.08-1423,0,39136,roy_t_englert_jr,,654.538,661.394,--602(a)(1) is limited to imports and doesn't confer a private right of action.
2010.08-1423,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,791.41,801.532,"You don't really mean -- your position is that ""lawfully made under this title"" means that -- means"
2010.08-1423,0,39136,roy_t_englert_jr,,808.97,809.288,Yes.
2010.08-1423,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,809.288,809.772,Okay.
2010.08-1423,0,39136,roy_t_englert_jr,,817.208,817.874,"Not quite, Your Honor."
2010.08-1423,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,829.782,831.615,"""If this title had been applicable. """
2010.08-1423,0,39136,roy_t_englert_jr,,834.65,834.816,"--Okay, sir."
2010.08-1423,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,882.528,894.752,May I ask you -- I see that 602(a) is now broken into (1) and (2) and it's 602(b) that you put entirely in quotes.
2010.08-1423,0,39136,roy_t_englert_jr,,908.559,927.621,"Well, Your Honor, as you know, there is no reference in the legislative history to the interaction between 602(a) and 109, and therefore, this Court had to address that question for the first time in Quality King, and the Court rejected the argument that 109 is inapplicable to imported goods altogether."
2010.08-1423,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,947.933,957.306,There was a concurring opinion that says -- that said this case is about a round trip and doesn't talk to goods that--
2010.08-1423,0,39136,roy_t_englert_jr,,957.306,965.144,"Correct, and the concurring opinion cited two distinguished copyright treatises that suggested there was some concern about extraterritoriality in this case."
2010.08-1423,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1018.945,1023.331,And nothing in the text that supports your position.
2010.08-1423,0,39136,roy_t_englert_jr,,1023.331,1023.997,No.
2010.08-1423,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1033.102,1041.172,You pulled out of the sky this distinction between having created exclusive rights abroad and having created nonexclusive rights abroad.
2010.08-1423,0,39136,roy_t_englert_jr,,1042.041,1043.591,"That comes from the legislative history, Your Honor."
2010.08-1423,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1046.326,1046.576,You use--
2010.08-1423,0,39136,roy_t_englert_jr,,1046.576,1048.742,--that distinction may not hold up.
2010.08-1423,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1050.444,1050.911,--I don't know why using--
2010.08-1423,0,39136,roy_t_englert_jr,,1050.911,1051.578,--that strengthens my position.
2010.08-1423,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1051.578,1062.669,--Did the legislative history suggest what part of the text this -- this novel suggestion was based upon?
2010.08-1423,0,39136,roy_t_englert_jr,,1062.669,1063.286,It does not.
2010.08-1423,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1065.388,1076.595,"I do read legislative history, but I didn't really find anything that said that they were worried about an American and a British publisher dividing rights, and they want them to do that."
2010.08-1423,0,39136,roy_t_englert_jr,,1093.455,1094.138,"Well, if--"
2010.08-1423,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1094.138,1096.49,"And if it's reasonable, they don't even need copyright."
2010.08-1423,0,39136,roy_t_englert_jr,,1096.49,1098.425,--That was not true at the time.
2010.08-1423,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1098.425,1099.425,"If it isn't reasonable, why should they have it?"
2010.08-1423,0,39136,roy_t_englert_jr,,1099.425,1100.858,"Pardon me, Justice Breyer."
2010.08-1423,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1100.858,1103.56,"That's all you -- yes, I just want you to respond."
2010.08-1423,0,39136,roy_t_englert_jr,,1103.56,1105.929,It was not lawful at the time of the enactment of this statute.
2010.08-1423,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1114.182,1114.465,Here.
2010.08-1423,0,39136,roy_t_englert_jr,,1116.617,1118.752,I don't know the state of the law in Europe.
2010.08-1423,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1118.752,1120.688,I think -- I think it's always been true.
2010.08-1423,0,39136,roy_t_englert_jr,,1120.688,1132.579,"But, again, what the Court has asked me many questions about is whether I'm giving too broad a scope to section 602 and too narrow a scope to section 109."
2010.08-1423,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1152.123,1154.409,My question really wasn't to argue with you.
2010.08-1423,0,39136,roy_t_englert_jr,,1181.374,1187.295,"--And Justice Breyer, to be fair about what the legislative history says, it is statements by witnesses."
2010.08-1423,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1191.413,1191.63,Oh.
2010.08-1423,0,39136,roy_t_englert_jr,,1206.652,1208.438,Yes.
2010.08-1423,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1208.438,1212.473,Let me write that down.
2010.08-1423,0,39136,roy_t_englert_jr,,1216.091,1221.059,"Justice Breyer, we do know that section 602(a) has some role to play."
2010.08-1423,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1257.815,1259.282,"Thank you, Mr. Englert."
2010.08-1423,1,16746,aaron_m_panner,,1273.992,1276.944,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2010.08-1423,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1322.655,1324.255,"What do you say ""made"" means?"
2010.08-1423,1,16746,aaron_m_panner,,1324.255,1330.742,"Well, ""made"" certainly includes the creation of the physical copy."
2010.08-1423,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1350.636,1356.274,"See, I'm with you, and I think you -- the text supports you up to the point where you add the qualification."
2010.08-1423,1,16746,aaron_m_panner,,1365.063,1368.098,"I don't think so, Your Honor, and let me try to explain why."
2010.08-1423,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1412.543,1453.101,"Well, in their brief, the brief for the National Library Association indicates at the bottom -- the American Library Association indicates at the bottom of page 38 that U.S. copyright law lawfully could apply; so that if you lawfully import it into the United States, it would then apply at that time."
2010.08-1423,1,16746,aaron_m_panner,,1453.101,1458.155,"Well, I think that that probably gets us to pretty much the same place, Justice Kennedy."
2010.08-1423,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1459.071,1461.107,"And it makes the exemption work, then, too."
2010.08-1423,1,16746,aaron_m_panner,,1461.107,1462.44,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
2010.08-1423,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1498.963,1499.629,And it can.
2010.08-1423,1,16746,aaron_m_panner,,1502.229,1502.914,But the--
2010.08-1423,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1502.914,1515.055,"And the -- the -- question is -- I mean, the text seems to say 602 expands or falls within 106."
2010.08-1423,1,16746,aaron_m_panner,,1525.41,1526.21,--That's correct.
2010.08-1423,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1526.21,1531.078,And then 109 is an exception from 106.
2010.08-1423,1,16746,aaron_m_panner,,1535.982,1536.432,And I think--
2010.08-1423,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1536.432,1537.598,"Now, that's the text."
2010.08-1423,1,16746,aaron_m_panner,,1575.305,1576.221,"--Well, Your Honor--"
2010.08-1423,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1576.221,1577.221,What's a third choice?
2010.08-1423,1,16746,aaron_m_panner,,1578.423,1580.857,"--Well, a small qualification, Your Honor."
2010.08-1423,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1637.795,1653.138,"That's why I started with the first sale doctrine, because if you apply the first sale doctrine as it traditionally has been applied and if you believe that 109 incorporates that, there is loads of room for 602(a)(1) to act."
2010.08-1423,1,16746,aaron_m_panner,,1682.24,1690.144,"Well, Your Honor, section 602(a)(1) refers specifically to copies that have been acquired outside of the United States."
2010.08-1423,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1696.446,1696.996,That's all right.
2010.08-1423,1,16746,aaron_m_panner,,1696.996,1744.51,"So I think that the difficulty with Costco's reading, by contrast -- and I think that some of the Court's questions brought that out this morning -- is that either they -- Costco's reading tends to eliminate any practical effect for section 602(a)(1) by making it not apply to legitimate copies or it makes substantive rights turn on formalities of title, which is quite inconsistent with the structure of the Copyright Act, which actually goes out of its way to make clear that the nature of the rights that are held by the copyright owner, which is defined to mean the owner of any of the many rights that comprise the copyright, are the same regardless of whether there's been a transfer."
2010.08-1423,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1787.206,1802.215,"It seems to me -- why didn't they say -- instead of ""lawfully made under this title"", why didn't they just say ""made in the United States""?"
2010.08-1423,1,16746,aaron_m_panner,,1802.215,1803.348,"Well, Your Honor--"
2010.08-1423,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1803.348,1805.417,"I mean, that's what you say it means."
2010.08-1423,1,16746,aaron_m_panner,,1808.619,1810.821,"--That is not our position, Your Honor."
2010.08-1423,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1861.604,1864.039,That's just not in the text.
2010.08-1423,1,16746,aaron_m_panner,,1878.798,1879.748,"I don't think so, Your Honor."
2010.08-1423,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1902.645,1904.03,Then you are trying to rewrite Quality King.
2010.08-1423,1,16746,aaron_m_panner,,1909.248,1918.02,"Not at all, Your Honor, because in Quality King, what the Court held was that a copy that is made in the United States is lawfully made under this title."
2010.08-1423,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1918.02,1925.193,Where in Quality King do you see anything Quality King turning on where the goods were made?
2010.08-1423,1,16746,aaron_m_panner,,1925.193,1927.609,"Well, Your Honor, the reason--"
2010.08-1423,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1927.609,1931.097,"I read the decision and it barely mentions that, if at all."
2010.08-1423,1,16746,aaron_m_panner,,1937.417,1938.451,"--I don't think so, Your Honor."
2010.08-1423,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1966.151,1967.603,But you don't say that.
2010.08-1423,1,16746,aaron_m_panner,,1970.138,1977.725,"But Your Honor, again, the distinction is between the question whether -- what the conduct that is being addressed is simply the manufacture."
2010.08-1423,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2011.113,2012.379,How often does this situation--
2010.08-1423,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2012.379,2019.683,"But it would be lawfully made under this title, even though it was made -- you know, made abroad, if what?"
2010.08-1423,1,16746,aaron_m_panner,,2019.683,2034.812,"If it were made, for example, pursuant to a license that allowed for distribution in the United States, there would be an affirmative exercise of the exclusive right that the copyright holder has under section 106(3) with respect to that particular copy."
2010.08-1423,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2054.023,2056.908,Is isn't the making that is rendered lawful.
2010.08-1423,1,16746,aaron_m_panner,,2065.248,2073.002,"--Well, Your Honor, the -- the making -- the question is whether it was lawfully made under this title."
2010.08-1423,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2088.279,2095.117,So you are saying -- you are saying that whether or not it's lawfully made depends on something that happens after it's made?
2010.08-1423,1,16746,aaron_m_panner,,2095.117,2112.062,"--In a particular case, it might be, Your Honor, but in the typical case -- let's say the Heartland case -- if a manufacturer has a license under U.S. copyright to distribute in the United States, it could be lawfully made at that time."
2010.08-1423,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2139.462,2142.664,"Well, they still have that right."
2010.08-1423,1,16746,aaron_m_panner,,2146.246,2154.5,"--Because if the sale is authorized in the United States, then that copy would be considered lawfully made because it includes the license."
2010.08-1423,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2196.595,2211.086,"Mr. Panner, can you answer Mr. Englert's point what earthly sense would it make to prefer goods that are manufactured abroad over those manufactured in the United States?"
2010.08-1423,1,16746,aaron_m_panner,,2211.086,2223.829,"Your Honor, it doesn't create any sort of a preference, as Mr. Englert -- Mr. Englert suggests that this is somehow -- prefers the -- the -- the copies that are made abroad."
2010.08-1423,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2273.31,2281.166,"There's a whole brief filed that traces the history of that language, and I think comes to a somewhat different conclusion."
2010.08-1423,1,16746,aaron_m_panner,,2283.701,2313.887,"Well, I think that the -- the -- the tracing of the language is -- is helpful, actually, to understand how section -- the current section 60 -- excuse me current section 109(a) differs from section 27, which is, in section 27, what happened was is that Congress codified in 1909 the idea that the material object is different from the copyright."
2010.08-1423,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2375.477,2410.884,"--How often do issues involving 602(a)(1) come up with respect to things like books, musical recordings, movies, as opposed to the copyrighted -- the -- the -- the material that is copyrighted here, a little -- a little insignia, a place to a label -- put on a label or put on a -- on goods?"
2010.08-1423,1,16746,aaron_m_panner,,2410.884,2412.551,"Thank you, Your Honor, that's a very good question."
2010.08-1423,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2456.679,2472.124,"The other side, if you go to -- you go to -- go to Home Depot and buy a desk, and how do you know -- are you worried that maybe on this desk it says there was a restriction somewhere, you could only use it for homes and not for offices?"
2010.08-1423,1,16746,aaron_m_panner,,2473.374,2475.16,"--No, Your Honor, it doesn't."
2010.08-1423,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2475.16,2479.278,And the reason it doesn't is because there is a first sale doctrine.
2010.08-1423,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2491.836,2493.121,"You may answer, counsel."
2010.08-1423,1,16746,aaron_m_panner,,2493.121,2493.987,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2010.08-1423,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2519.939,2521.272,That was first.
2010.08-1423,1,16746,aaron_m_panner,,2522.891,2524.807,"--Thank you, Your Honor."
2010.08-1423,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2529.978,2531.18,"Thank you, Mr. Panner."
2010.08-1423,1,16746,aaron_m_panner,,2531.18,2531.68,Thank you.
2010.08-1423,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2531.68,2541.352,Mr. Stewart?
2010.08-1423,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2541.352,2543.554,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2010.08-1423,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2703.308,2716.282,"Well, what is your answer to the argument that if ""lawfully made under this title"" means basically made in the United States, that provides a great incentive to manufacture goods abroad and that can't possibly be what Congress intended?"
2010.08-1423,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2716.282,2718.884,"--Well, I think there are -- I think we would say a couple of things."
2010.08-1423,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2878.954,2894.464,"Well, in your example, if there is a lawful importation of the foreign-made good, then if you interpret ""made"" as causing to exist of appear or under these laws, as the library brief suggests, the first sale doctrine would operate."
2010.08-1423,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2894.464,2901.951,"I think we would say the first sale doctrine as articulated in Bobbs-Merrill would operate, but we wouldn't place this within section 109(a)."
2010.08-1423,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2901.951,2904.335,"Well, that's the problem I have with your position."
2010.08-1423,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2915.627,2919.829,I think we would still be looking to other provisions of the Copyright Act rather than to common law.
2010.08-1423,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3022.396,3028.566,I found the brief I was looking for which is the American Intellectual Property Law Association.
2010.08-1423,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3065.841,3085.57,"I -- I think with -- with respect to the pre-emption question, what they had in mind was a situation in which Omega sells the watch to a reseller -- to a retailer on condition, for instance, that the retailer only sell them in a particular way, or do particular types of advertising, and the reseller sells them in violation."
2010.08-1423,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3085.57,3100.33,"What Nimmer said is, he said we want to be sure in his -- in bill back in '64, '65 -- not to invalidate any State law contractual restriction on the right of the owner of the particular copy to dispose, exhibit, et cetera the same."
2010.08-1423,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3100.33,3100.846,Exactly.
2010.08-1423,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3128.165,3128.699,So why don't we let--
2010.08-1423,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3128.699,3130.115,I'm sorry?
2010.08-1423,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3130.115,3138.705,--Why don't we let contract law control the violations of any agreements with foreigners?
2010.08-1423,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3138.705,3139.723,"Well, I think--"
2010.08-1423,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3139.723,3141.99,With respect to manufacturing and distribution?
2010.08-1423,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3141.99,3143.842,--I think in 1960 -- may I?
2010.08-1423,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3143.842,3144.675,Very briefly.
2010.08-1423,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3144.675,3151.364,Because many of the people with which Congress were concerned would not be in privity of contract with the U.S. copyright owner.
2010.08-1423,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3151.364,3152.464,"Thank you, counsel."
2010.08-1423,3,39136,roy_t_englert_jr,,3154.732,3158.284,"Thank you, Your Honor."
2010.08-1423,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3487.561,3488.779,"Thank you, counsel."
