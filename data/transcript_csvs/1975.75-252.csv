1975.75-252,0,35684,michael_c_donahue,,42.522,44.408,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1975.75-252,1,28752,jones,,1551.814,1555.621,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1975.75-252,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1638.578,1643.537,"Well, settled it and Paul against Davis resettled it, did it not?"
1975.75-252,1,28752,jones,,1643.537,1644.39,"Yes, that is right."
1975.75-252,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1655.298,1661.888,I agree with the damage that as you say to be liberty or property or life.
1975.75-252,1,28752,jones,,1661.888,1663.507,That is correct Mr. Justice Stewart.
1975.75-252,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1708.314,1711.071,What about transfer to solitary confinement?
1975.75-252,1,28752,jones,,1711.071,1715.781,Transfer to a solitary confinement raises a slightly different question.
1975.75-252,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1751.463,1758.613,": That is a factual -- really it is largely or prettily factual, is it not, Whether or not that something is liberty or property."
1975.75-252,1,28752,jones,,1782.491,1796.298,Well our answer to that would be that if there were no articulated standards in the rules governing his confinement there would be no non-constitutional origin for a liberty interest.
1975.75-252,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1806.173,1810.429,"Well, the constitution has a different meaning does it not, at least generally?"
1975.75-252,1,28752,jones,,1834.595,1834.938,I do not know.
1975.75-252,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1834.938,1846.117,"Not constitutionally protected, but whether in fact that the person was deprived of his freedom of movement, and not his constitutional freedom."
1975.75-252,1,28752,jones,,1846.117,1852.032,"If it is not of constitutional basis, I am not sure of what basis it is."
1975.75-252,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1856.015,1865.866,As a constitutional right to be out of jail and as a constitutionally right to be put in to jail only after has been accorded due process of law.
1975.75-252,1,28752,jones,,1865.866,1869.176,Well that is a different way phrasing it but I do not see the difference in substance.
1975.75-252,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1869.176,1869.98,"Well, it is quite different."
1975.75-252,1,28752,jones,,1889.916,1894.06,"Well, they are different in this sense."
1975.75-252,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1908.273,1912.441,"But the factual matter whether a person is free to walk the streets or in prison, is it not?"
1975.75-252,1,28752,jones,,1912.441,1913.798,MThere is no doubt about.
1975.75-252,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1913.798,1915.056,And that is a matter of fact.
1975.75-252,1,28752,jones,,1915.056,1916.828,That is true.
1975.75-252,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1934.077,1936.835,"Well, but you do not (Inaudible) that were permitted to (Voice Overlap)."
1975.75-252,1,28752,jones,,1936.835,1940.215,"That is correct, Mr. Chief Justice."
1975.75-252,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1943.399,1946.53,"The point is that you lost part of it, not all of it, is that not it?"
1975.75-252,1,28752,jones,,1950.33,1963.021,"Once a prisoner or once a man has been convicted and sentenced, he is lawfully subject to whatever conditions of confinement that may be fairly said to be inherent within that sentence."

1975.75-252,3,35684,michael_c_donahue,,4161.166,4163.133,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1975.75-252,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4253.707,4263.254,"Did you mention or did someone mentioned earlier in the argument the figure, the total number of transfer in one year in Massachusetts or was that in the other case?"
1975.75-252,3,35684,michael_c_donahue,,4263.254,4267.608,I believe that might have been the other case Your Honor.
1975.75-252,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4286.458,4288.992,What is the total prison population of Massachusetts?
1975.75-252,3,35684,michael_c_donahue,,4288.992,4290.663,"Approximately 2,700 Your Honor."

1975.75-252,3,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,4294.446,4299.0,"Mr. Donahue, you had comment on the adequacy of the notice here."
1975.75-252,3,35684,michael_c_donahue,,4307.896,4315.267,Your Honor the District Court and the Court of Appeals said that the notice was inadequate because it did not state the time and place of the hearings.
