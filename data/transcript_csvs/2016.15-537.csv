2016.15-537,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,12.285,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case No. 15-537, Bravo-Fernandez and Martinez-Maldonado v. the United States. Ms. Blatt."
2016.15-537,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,12.285,40.8,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: For three reasons, acquittals should have full effect under the Double Jeopardy Clause without regard to invalid vacated convictions. First, vacated convictions are legal nullities, including under the Double Jeopardy Clause. Second, vacated convictions are not relevant to what a jury necessarily decided."
2016.15-537,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,50.295,71.985,"I take it from that you would agree that there might be cases where, under Ashe v. Swenson, there's an acquittal on one count, conviction on the other count, conviction set aside, government can retry the count that had been set aside, on the ground that under Ashe v. Swenson the verdict on the other count was just irrelevant."
2016.15-537,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,71.985,73.0,That's right.
2016.15-537,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,83.32,100.96,"In this case, could it be argued -- was the argument before the jury on the conspiracy in the travel counts closely intertwined with 666 so that it -- you can't say the jury decided most likely on some issue that's irrelevant to 666?"
2016.15-537,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,100.96,101.21,Right.
2016.15-537,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,142.06,148.15,"Ms. Blatt -- but if we're trying to figure out what this jury found, you know, we're not what talking about claim preclusion."
2016.15-537,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,189.38,222.015,"Well, we know, just looking at the acquittals alone, that we know what they decided. So the question is -- and it's, I think, under Yeager and under the Double Jeopardy Clause -- is this Court, for the first time in the history of its jurisprudence, going to give any meaning to or relevance to an invalid conviction? You have never held an invalid conviction was relevant to or evidence of anything, Justice Ginsburg, and let me just suggest the last place you should start is the Double Jeopardy Clause, where illegal, invalid, vacated convictions always been legal nullities."
2016.15-537,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,222.015,234.025,"Ms. Blatt, it does seem to me that's what your argument rests on in the end: The idea that we shouldn't give any weight or any influence to an invalid conviction."
2016.15-537,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,239.88,240.57,Both.
2016.15-537,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,250.19,250.38,Yes.
2016.15-537,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,281.17,281.66,Right.
2016.15-537,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,321.3,323.91,"You know, I think you're contesting the premise of my question."
2016.15-537,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,357.75,358.075,Right.
2016.15-537,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,358.075,374.065,"And now you're saying, notwithstanding that the vacated conviction tells you something about what the jury did or didn't do about how the jury reasoned, we shouldn't look at it. And there's something very powerful, rhetorically, in your statement."
2016.15-537,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,378.17,378.55,"Yeah, let me --"
2016.15-537,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,378.55,389.37,"-- there, like, a legal principle here about why we shouldn't look to vacated convictions to tell us something about the facts, when they can tell us something about the facts?"
2016.15-537,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,389.37,389.53,Sure.
2016.15-537,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,418.13,419.88,I'm not sure that really answers the question.
2016.15-537,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,442.67,448.39,"So the reason why Yeager -- I mean, Yeager said -- I don't think any dispute, and this is the government's whole argument."
2016.15-537,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,454.65,459.1,But the Yeager case was -- the jury didn't reach any decision.
2016.15-537,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,477.79,483.35,"It's clear as it comes to this Court, but I think, you know, I'd have to go back and read Sun Diamond, which is --"
2016.15-537,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,483.35,483.94,The question is --
2016.15-537,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,483.94,485.14,Is whether to quid pro quo.
2016.15-537,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,485.14,489.6,"Is it quid pro quo, or is it gratuity as well? As I understand it, there's a circuit split."
2016.15-537,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,489.6,490.025,Right.
2016.15-537,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,509.73,527.455,"But why is that true when you can have a set-aside of the verdict that's independent of the jury charge? You can have a situation, like in the State of Michigan, where the conviction was set aside because the defendant was deprived of his right to proceed pro se."
2016.15-537,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,543.6,555.44,"So I think for errors like Feretta and Gonzalez-Lopez, right to counsel and a few other kind of nutty structural errors, where the Court has never said it's prejudicial, but we're going to treat it as such, because you can't unwind the apple cart."
2016.15-537,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,566.27,571.46,But what do they have to do to impeach the inconsistent act of the jury?
2016.15-537,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,571.46,571.64,Okay.
2016.15-537,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,644.06,644.63,I'm sorry.
2016.15-537,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,644.69,645.51,"Yeah, but we don't know."
2016.15-537,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,645.51,645.81,Exactly.
2016.15-537,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,645.81,647.11,"I mean, that's the whole point."
2016.15-537,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,660.31,663.21,"So unlike an acquittal, this is just Yeager all over again."
2016.15-537,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,684.51,688.61,I don't understand why you're saying we don't know why the jury convicted on 666.
2016.15-537,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,692.075,693.85,"Well, it convicted on 666 --"
2016.15-537,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,693.85,694.73,That's why it convicted.
2016.15-537,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,694.73,698.42,-- on a charge that allowed it to convict based on completely lawful conduct.
2016.15-537,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,700.955,703.05,I understand there was an instructional error.
2016.15-537,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,705.365,705.98,No.
2016.15-537,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,706.89,712.35,"Because under the -- because under the erroneous instruction, they clearly found the facts of a violation."
2016.15-537,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,716.515,718.95,Under the wrong -- under something that's not a crime.
2016.15-537,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,728.46,734.465,"Well, the jury was operating under the same charge with respect to the compound crimes."
2016.15-537,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,748.91,751.31,So it's actually inverse.
2016.15-537,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,776.18,801.43,"What about the question I asked you before? If we're trying to find out what this jury did, isn't it a reasonable assumption that they convicted on the bribery for which there was much evidence? They thought that having the compound crimes, the conspiracy and the travel, was just laying it on too thick, so they weren't going to convict on those."
2016.15-537,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,802.795,802.965,Yeah.
2016.15-537,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,813.8,821.85,"I thought that in Yeager, the Court said there was no -- there was no conflict because there was no decision."
2016.15-537,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,824.32,824.61,Right.
2016.15-537,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,824.61,826.89,"This jury, we know, did decide something."
2016.15-537,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,826.89,830.03,We know the jury decided something that is completely irrelevant.
2016.15-537,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,853.65,867.625,"Under your argument, the trial court could instruct the jury: If you find guilt on 666 and if you find that there was travel, you must find that there was guilt under the travel section as well."
2016.15-537,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,869.595,872.98,"I'm actually -- that one, I'm lost on what you're asking."
2016.15-537,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,873.46,880.895,"Well, you're saying in answer to Justice Ginsburg's question that the jury can't make different decisions with multiple counts."
2016.15-537,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,891.775,892.28,Right.
2016.15-537,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,896.74,899.045,But I think that's an improper instruction.
2016.15-537,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,899.045,917.18,"It is an improper instruction. And the question is, is if the instruction is prejudicial in a way that renders the decision not final, invalid, it can't be any more relevant evidence than the jury's just refusal to find anything. And it's kind of like -- I'll give you an example."
2016.15-537,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,948.84,969.07,"Maybe one way I can figure out the scope of your argument is just to ask, do you think that the government is always unable to use a vacated conviction, that is for any purpose, or do you think that the government is unable to use a vacated conviction only for double jeopardy purposes?"
2016.15-537,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,969.07,974.135,"This Court has never used a vacated conviction for any purpose, period."
2016.15-537,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,975.24,978.305,"So you have the history on your side, most of it."
2016.15-537,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,984.855,985.27,Yes.
2016.15-537,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,990.7,992.3,This isn't a double jeopardy argument.
2016.15-537,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,994.18,994.27,True.
2016.15-537,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,994.27,1000.1,But what is it? What is the something else? Why can't the government use a vacated conviction for any purpose?
2016.15-537,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,1000.1,1006.005,"Well, I mean, we have -- we have it's void ab initio and then it's void ab initio under the Double Jeopardy Clause."
2016.15-537,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1006.55,1007.5,Look at the label.
2016.15-537,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,1024.42,1025.36,But -- but that's --
2016.15-537,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1025.36,1029.13,"But -- but, you know, what's -- what part of the Constitution are we looking to to tell us this?"
2016.15-537,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,1029.13,1038.52,"Just because I'm not going to let Yeager go like this, I mean, there's historical fact of the hung jury, and the entire government brief and the entire dissent is they're not reconcilable."
2016.15-537,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1040.94,1042.35,That's not the question I'm asking.
2016.15-537,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,1042.35,1045.31,"Well, except that I a.m. saying Yeager does defeat what you're saying."
2016.15-537,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1062.71,1064.98,But they are not complete nullities.
2016.15-537,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1066.575,1067.55,Justice Alito.
2016.15-537,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1067.55,1072.64,"They lack legal effect, but it is a historical fact that it occurs."
2016.15-537,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,1093.08,1097.39,"I guarantee you if that testimony was struck from the record, it's gone."
2016.15-537,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1100.33,1100.9,I'm sorry.
2016.15-537,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,1112.45,1115.02,"That was bribed, and the court struck from the record."
2016.15-537,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1119.55,1120.845,That -- that wasn't Justice --
2016.15-537,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,1120.845,1122.33,"Well, maybe I misunderstood the question."
2016.15-537,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1122.33,1123.45,"-- Alito's hypothetical, as I understand it."
2016.15-537,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,1130.005,1130.67,All right.
2016.15-537,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1130.67,1134.47,Can that witness be prosecuted for perjury?
2016.15-537,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,1134.47,1134.85,"Oh, yeah."
2016.15-537,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1137.04,1141.979,So then -- and then his point could follow this; the conviction can be used for some things.
2016.15-537,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,1141.979,1145.69,You're not using the conviction. You're using the witness's testimony.
2016.15-537,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1193.1,1199.75,"Well, but the basic point that was made in Yeager made over and over again is that when the jury is hung, the jury hasn't done anything."
2016.15-537,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,1244.11,1253.51,"I think -- I mean, what our argument does depend on is that the reason why the Court cares about jury verdicts is they come with a stamp of finality and validity."
2016.15-537,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1284.49,1292.23,"When the acquittal isn't undermined in that it has claim preclusive effect, those acquittals are final."
2016.15-537,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,1309.2,1315.355,"And that was the very argument made by, you know, the government in Yeager, is who cares about the acquittals, because they are going to count."
2016.15-537,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1318.82,1321.02,Because there was nothing on the other side in Yeager.
2016.15-537,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,1325.995,1326.6,Right.
2016.15-537,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1341.92,1344.31,The error had nothing to do with the inconsistency.
2016.15-537,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,1344.31,1346.59,"Yes, it -- well, it could have. It definitely could have."
2016.15-537,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1379.24,1380.58,It didn't say we're not really sure.
2016.15-537,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,1385.205,1391.15,And I think an invalid verdict on a legally relevant question is worse than no decision at all.
2016.15-537,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1428.955,1439.6,"You're -- you're saying it is highly doubtful if the government had charged just counts 2 and 3 and got an acquittal, and that they could then have had a second trial under 666."
2016.15-537,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,1442.88,1443.955,That's exactly right.
2016.15-537,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1520.59,1527.02,"Thank you, counsel. Ms. Prelogar."
2016.15-537,1,62747,elizabeth_b_prelogar,,1527.02,1552.59,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The most essential prerequisite for applying collateral estoppel is that the jury must have actually decided an issue in the defendant's favor, and that prerequisite isn't satisfied here. Petitioner's jury returned inconsistent verdicts, convicting them of the standalone bribery offense that they're seeking to preclude relitigation of now, but also acquitting them of offenses involving bribery as a predicate."
2016.15-537,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1577.67,1584.575,"But suppose the hypothetical were -- just conspiracy and travel are charged, and there's an acquittal."
2016.15-537,1,62747,elizabeth_b_prelogar,,1586.2,1597.57,"No, because in that situation, there would be nothing in the record to indicate that the jury had done anything other than follow their instructions, apply a lot of facts, and make factual findings in the defendant's favor."
2016.15-537,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1617.95,1627.245,Do you agree with Ms. Blatt's statement that the government has never before sought to gain a benefit from a vacated conviction?
2016.15-537,1,62747,elizabeth_b_prelogar,,1627.245,1631.49,"Well, I think that it's important to separate out the use of the vacated conviction."
2016.15-537,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1653.57,1661.31,"What other purpose could you use a vacated conviction for? Is there anything else that the government can use a vacated conviction for, or is this the only thing?"
2016.15-537,1,62747,elizabeth_b_prelogar,,1661.31,1687.145,"I think it can use it to establish any kind of historical fact when -- when that's the purpose to which the conviction is being put. And we cite a number of lower court cases that look at vacated convictions to establish things like motive for a -- for a subsequent crime, which would establish the defendant's plan or intent. So there are situations where it's really the existence of the conviction that tells us something about what actually happened with facts on the ground, that I think the conviction is relevant for."
2016.15-537,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1687.145,1687.88,Who -- who's not --
2016.15-537,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1687.88,1711.72,"Could you use it in a civil case? Could a -- could a -- a party use it in a civil case to impose civil liability? Say, well, you know, the jury obviously found that you did this; there was an instruction on the criminal aspect but didn't -- but you did this act, and that's collateral estoppel, or it's issue preclusion, in a civil case for damages."
2016.15-537,1,62747,elizabeth_b_prelogar,,1711.72,1712.25,No.
2016.15-537,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1715.15,1715.45,Why not?
2016.15-537,1,62747,elizabeth_b_prelogar,,1715.45,1721.925,"-- civil collateral estoppel principle, the verdict has to be final, and it would lack finality if the conviction had been reversed."
2016.15-537,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1751.895,1755.87,But you don't know based on the conviction.
2016.15-537,1,62747,elizabeth_b_prelogar,,1787.395,1790.68,"We do know, though, that these verdicts definitely were inconsistent."
2016.15-537,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1799.83,1814.59,"Well, but if the jury -- if the jury relied on the part of the instruction that was legally invalid, then you don't know that they reached a -- a verdict inconsistent with what was the acquittal in the prior case."
2016.15-537,1,62747,elizabeth_b_prelogar,,1814.59,1815.66,We can't rely --
2016.15-537,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1815.66,1816.58,A valid conviction.
2016.15-537,1,62747,elizabeth_b_prelogar,,1816.58,1842.7,"That's true we can't rule out that possibility, but it's equally possible that the jury validly convicted on a quid pro quo bribery theory and decided to acquit on the other offenses out of lenity or mistake or confusion. And when we're in this world where we just don't know, and Petitioners concede that we can't be certain what other verdict rested on, then in that situation the -- the general collateral estoppel principle is that they cannot preclude that issue from further litigation."
2016.15-537,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1859.91,1894.955,"Ms. Blatt suggested that there's something -- I think she used the word ""unseemly"" -- about using a vacated conviction for this, or indeed for any other purpose, given the traditions of our legal system where it's just very hard to find instances in which we have done so. So, you know, I'm not sure I understand where the unseemliness prohibition comes from, but it does seem, you now, quite out of kilter with the traditions of our legal system to use vacated convictions in a manner that affects individuals' constitutional rights."
2016.15-537,1,62747,elizabeth_b_prelogar,,1898.715,1906.0,You shouldn't be concerned about it because the tradition is limited to looking at convictions to stand in for the defendant's guilt.
2016.15-537,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1910.17,1911.79,I think the tradition goes further.
2016.15-537,1,62747,elizabeth_b_prelogar,,1929.77,1947.235,"Those lower court examples, though, I think are particularly relevant, because what a number of them are doing are using the vacated conviction to answer precisely the question that we have at issue here, which is to try to ascertain the basis for a jury's other verdict. And when the whole question is what did the jury actually necessarily decide."
2016.15-537,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2196.315,2213.755,"Do you agree with Petitioner that if you have a jury finding, jury makes a finding, but that finding is infected by race discrimination, you can't use that for anything even though it's a jury finding?"
2016.15-537,1,62747,elizabeth_b_prelogar,,2213.755,2227.33,"Certainly you can't use it to establish that the jury found the defendant guilty, because in that situation, that kind of error would establish that the jury wasn't basing that conviction on any relevant circumstance."
2016.15-537,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2261.03,2276.475,"Well, does that position extend to anything that affects the evidence in the case, so that if any prosecution evidence is improperly admitted or any defense evidence is improperly excluded, the same would follow?"
2016.15-537,1,62747,elizabeth_b_prelogar,,2276.475,2283.105,"So long as it creates reversible error, then, of course, the conviction would have to be set aside based on that evidence."
2016.15-537,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2285.36,2300.17,"I thought your answer to Justice Ginsburg was that if there was a particular kind of error that resulted in the reversal, then the conviction could not be used to show inconsistency in the verdicts. Did I misunderstand your answer?"
2016.15-537,1,62747,elizabeth_b_prelogar,,2300.17,2300.98,"No, I apologize."
2016.15-537,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2401.375,2416.86,"But that is the greater remedy that Yeager gave, and I understand your distinction between Yeager and this case, but it does leave you with a fundamental anomaly, which is, in a case in which there's an acquittal and a hung count, the acquittal is the only thing that matters."
2016.15-537,1,62747,elizabeth_b_prelogar,,2438.86,2449.545,"But that result makes sense in light of the way Yeager reasoned through the issue in the case, because in Yeager you could look to the acquittal and identify that it must have made factual finding --"
2016.15-537,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2449.545,2462.15,"It makes sense in terms of parts of Yeager's reasoning, but not in terms of other parts of Yeager's reasoning. Another part of Yeager's reasoning just said hung counts have never been accorded respect as a matter of law or history."
2016.15-537,1,62747,elizabeth_b_prelogar,,2471.45,2481.955,"I understand that portion of Yeager, though to just simply confirm what the Court had already said, which is that hung counts are evidence of nothing because they don't represent jury decisions at all."
2016.15-537,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2490.41,2496.365,"Well, I guess I see -- when I read Yeager, I see two different rationales, and on one you're exactly right."
2016.15-537,1,62747,elizabeth_b_prelogar,,2507.45,2557.27,"But I think that Yeager itself signaled that the issue on which the case turned is that we didn't have the kind of true inconsistency that existed in a case like Powell, and the finality of the conviction, its validity doesn't erase the inconsistency that existed in Powell or provide any greater clue about what that jury was actually thinking and what it actually decided through its verdicts. And so I think Yeager itself emphasized that although we do have these finality concerns, a verdict of acquittal is final only with those issues that it actually decided, and Yeager was able to conclude that the jury in that case, through the acquittal, did decide issues in the defendant's favor as opposed to, for example, deciding to acquit out of compassion, exercise lenity, or neglect to follow instructions through the count of acquittal. That's not the case here where we have conclusive evidence."
2016.15-537,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2598.0,2610.275,The question on which we granted review refers to a vacated unconstitutional conviction. But is that what we have here? Is this an unconstitutional conviction?
2016.15-537,1,62747,elizabeth_b_prelogar,,2610.275,2625.33,"I think that we -- that the conviction, if it were based on proper theory, would not be unconstitutional, and so we don't necessarily know. That was the reason why the conviction had to be vacated, was because it wasn't clear what basis the jury had resolved the verdict on."
2016.15-537,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2625.33,2629.675,"Well, it was an erroneous instruction, so it was instructional error."
2016.15-537,1,62747,elizabeth_b_prelogar,,2631.465,2648.42,"It's a -- I think it rises to the level of a constitutional error insofar as the First Circuit held that the defendants -- that the instructional error would have permitted criminal conviction based on conduct that doesn't constitute a crime, putting, of course, to one side, as Justice Ginsburg noted, the circuit split on that issue."
2016.15-537,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2659.055,2659.585,Sorry.
2016.15-537,1,62747,elizabeth_b_prelogar,,2663.285,2668.01,I don't think that all of them would necessarily rise to the level of a constitutional error.
2016.15-537,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2682.835,2687.045,"So if there were a harmless error issue in this case, what would the standard be?"
2016.15-537,1,62747,elizabeth_b_prelogar,,2687.045,2688.56,If there were a harmless error --
2016.15-537,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2688.56,2692.895,It would have to be harmless beyond a reasonable doubt because it's a constitutional error?
2016.15-537,1,62747,elizabeth_b_prelogar,,2692.895,2723.27,"I'm not sure whether the lower court applied a Chapman standard here, and I think ultimately the potential difference in standards wouldn't have affected the analysis, because the court concluded that there was -- that there was sufficient evidence on the proper quid pro quo theory, also evidence that would have supported a bribery theory. And so the court just couldn't tell either way on what ground the jury would have possibly grounded this verdict. Ultimately, though, I think in light of that error, the appropriate result is the ordinary remedy here, a retrial."
2016.15-537,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2754.58,2759.669,"Thank you, counsel. Ms. Blatt, you have five minutes remaining."
2016.15-537,2,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,2759.669,2761.47,Thanks.
2016.15-537,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2927.16,2930.685,The jury might have taken care of that in this case.
2016.15-537,2,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,2943.275,2943.85,Right.
2016.15-537,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3053.165,3060.2,"Are you really arguing that it can't be used to prove a historical fact, that it's not a -- it cannot be a relevant historical fact?"
2016.15-537,2,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,3060.2,3081.55,"In the same way that Yeager -- the relevant historical fact is a finding of guilt. That's why they couldn't get through their brief without finishing up with historical fact on what the jury thought about the defendant's guilt. And I noticed she didn't once say ""legal conviction."" If she had to give her argument saying the jury legally convicted, it was an invalid verdict, it was an unconstitutional verdict, her argument doesn't sound so attractive."
2016.15-537,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3081.55,0.0,"Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted."
