1985.85-54,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,62.537,"Mr. Rothfeld, I think you may proceed when you're ready."
1985.85-54,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,62.537,65.536,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1985.85-54,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,211.853,244.652,"Mr. Rothfeld, if there were private litigants involved in a case like this, so we didn't have the Federal Government issue, if some form of pre-judgment interest were sought as against a private defendant employer, would it be payable as part of attorneys' fee, or as a part of damages in general, or how?"
1985.85-54,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,248.683,264.677,"Pre-judgment interest on the attorneys' fee award would be characterized, I think, either as a component of that award... pre-judgment interest I think is generally viewed as a part of the damages and is generally termed pre-judgment interest on the damages."
1985.85-54,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,264.677,272.189,"So if it were a private defendant, in your view then it would be a part of attorneys' fee or costs in any event?"
1985.85-54,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,272.189,273.298,"Well, it would--"
1985.85-54,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,273.298,274.203,Is that right?
1985.85-54,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,274.203,276.625,--It would be a part of the attorneys' fee.
1985.85-54,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,296.663,304.066,Is it conceded all around that in the case of a private defendant pre-judgment interest can be recovered on attorneys' fees?
1985.85-54,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,304.066,312.422,We acknowledge that a district court can exercise its discretion to award pre-judgment interest on attorneys' fee in private sector litigation.
1985.85-54,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,312.422,314.187,As part of the attorneys' fee?
1985.85-54,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,314.187,315.734,"As a part of the attorneys' fee, that's correct."
1985.85-54,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,315.734,317.187,Not as a part of damages?
1985.85-54,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,317.187,323.122,"That's correct, not as a part of the substantive back pay award, for example, that a plaintiff might be entitled to get."
1985.85-54,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,545.64,552.044,"Mr. Rothfeld, would you comment to Attorney General Bell's memorandum that you opponent quotes toward the end of his brief?"
1985.85-54,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,557.119,561.806,"Well, I think he would, Justice Stevens, and I think actually in a sense that supports our position here."
1985.85-54,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,593.902,600.338,"And at that time, the Department took the position that no interest would be awarded on attorneys' fees awards?"
1985.85-54,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,600.338,604.462,It's my understanding that no court had ever suggested that--
1985.85-54,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,604.462,612.003,"I mean, I was just curious to know what the position of the Government was when Attorney General... when Griffin Bell was the attorney General."
1985.85-54,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,617.189,628.465,"--Well, to my knowledge the first suggestion that attorneys' fees would be available, interest would be available on attorneys' fees against the Government, did not occur until 1980 in this Copeland versus Marshall decision."
1985.85-54,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,657.455,664.748,"May I also just clarify, because I'm a little hazy on it, what is your position with respect to post-judgment interest on an attorneys' fee award?"
1985.85-54,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,664.748,671.012,"So far as post-judgment interest is concerned, there must, again, be a separate statutory authorization."
1985.85-54,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,677.103,678.26,I know it's not at issue.
1985.85-54,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,681.085,683.803,"On Title VII awards, it is not available."
1985.85-54,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,683.803,685.115,--I'm talking about attorneys' fee awards.
1985.85-54,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,685.115,687.13,"That's correct, in Title VII attorneys' fees awards."
1985.85-54,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,687.13,687.645,It's not available.
1985.85-54,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,715.431,720.882,"Well, I must acknowledge that that's not an area of the law that I am completely familiar with."
1985.85-54,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,732.346,735.376,"And so that if he pays his own attorney, he's not entitled to recover the fee?"
1985.85-54,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,736.563,739.671,"Well, again, that is an issue, Your Honor--"
1985.85-54,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,739.671,744.435,"And perhaps I shouldn't, but I just thought that perhaps you would have thought about it and have some comment that would help me understand it."
1985.85-54,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,744.435,747.574,"--Well, again--"
1985.85-54,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,747.574,751.26,"It seems to me the Government got a $3100 windfall at that point, let me just put it that way."
1985.85-54,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,751.26,754.963,--I hope that does not reflect on the remainder of our case.
1985.85-54,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,754.963,756.493,"No, it doesn't."
1985.85-54,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,771.877,777.499,The Respondent does not explicitly address that question in his brief and I shouldn't speak for him.
1985.85-54,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1121.628,1127.891,Mr. Ralston.
1985.85-54,1,19940,charles_stephen_ralston,,1127.891,1131.092,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1985.85-54,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1471.82,1477.832,Does the legislative history speak expressly anywhere to pre-judgment interest on attorneys' fees?
1985.85-54,1,19940,charles_stephen_ralston,,1477.832,1478.472,"No, Your Honor."
1985.85-54,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1508.32,1508.835,Mr. Ralston--
1985.85-54,1,19940,charles_stephen_ralston,,1508.835,1509.648,--discussion of interest.
1985.85-54,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1509.648,1509.929,--Excuse me.
1985.85-54,1,19940,charles_stephen_ralston,,1509.929,1510.96,"I'm sorry, Your Honor."
1985.85-54,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1510.96,1513.335,I didn't mean to cut off your response.
1985.85-54,1,19940,charles_stephen_ralston,,1513.335,1514.303,"No, I've completed it."
1985.85-54,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1514.303,1530.077,Do you agree with the Solicitor General that Congress has usually used much more express language when it's provided for the payment of interest than it did in this case?
1985.85-54,1,19940,charles_stephen_ralston,,1530.077,1540.963,"Certainly where it's provided for post-judgment interest, and the EAJA, the Equal Access to Justice Act, is an example where they put in post-judgment interest in the statute."
1985.85-54,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1679.796,1685.701,Do you think this statute allows the recovery of post-judgment interest--
1985.85-54,1,19940,charles_stephen_ralston,,1685.701,1687.465,"Your Honor, on--"
1985.85-54,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1687.465,1690.965,"--against the Government, or a private litigant?"
1985.85-54,1,19940,charles_stephen_ralston,,1690.965,1711.752,"--With regard... we take the position... I suppose the best way to state it is, we take the position that, because our position is it's intended to be a total waiver of all sovereign immunity with regard to employment discrimination claims, that if post-judgment interest is available against private parties it would be available against the Federal Government."
1985.85-54,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1714.72,1716.298,Is it available against private parties?
1985.85-54,1,19940,charles_stephen_ralston,,1716.298,1721.311,"Under the general statute that provides for interest on a judgment, it would be."
1985.85-54,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1725.668,1731.027,"So the short answer is you think it's recoverable against the Government, post-judgment interest?"
1985.85-54,1,19940,charles_stephen_ralston,,1731.027,1734.351,"Yes, although again I must emphasize this case does not involve that."
1985.85-54,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1814.68,1821.504,Do you agree that the enhancement factor here is the equivalent of the award of interest?
1985.85-54,1,19940,charles_stephen_ralston,,1821.504,1825.175,"Your Honor, the judge calls it interest, and again--"
1985.85-54,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1825.175,1827.174,"Well, I'm asking what your position is."
1985.85-54,1,19940,charles_stephen_ralston,,1827.174,1835.467,"--Our position in this particular case, although the judge called it interest, it in fact did not fully compensate for the effect of inflation."
1985.85-54,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1852.789,1860.927,"In answering the question in this case, should we address the question of pre-judgment interest or should we address some other question?"
1985.85-54,1,19940,charles_stephen_ralston,,1860.927,1868.55,"--Well, Your Honor, I think the Court can address the issue of pre-judgment interest, but I think it's helpful in addressing that as to what that involves."
1985.85-54,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1923.948,1928.993,"But in which of the two senses that you just spoke of do they use that term, ""delay in payment""?"
1985.85-54,1,19940,charles_stephen_ralston,,1936.646,1940.723,"In most instances, the courts don't analyze it particularly."
1985.85-54,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1975.569,1981.239,"So that's something different in your view, then, than simply loss of the use of the money for that period of time?"
1985.85-54,1,19940,charles_stephen_ralston,,1981.239,1988.625,"Yes, that's loss of value of the money, and that is an essential component of the calculation that was made here."
1985.85-54,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2042.245,2049.445,If we were to agree with you on the point that a district court may properly allow for lessening value of the money--
1985.85-54,1,19940,charles_stephen_ralston,,2049.445,2050.256,Yes.
1985.85-54,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2050.256,2059.956,"--but would agree with the Government on the proposition that there is no interest or damages for delay on attorneys' fees, we would have to reverse the Court of Appeals, would we not?"
1985.85-54,1,19940,charles_stephen_ralston,,2059.956,2072.249,"The Court of... yes, I think the Court of Appeals' decision, if that was the Court's decision, would allow both aspects of pre-judgment interest."
1985.85-54,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2093.771,2101.676,"Well, I thought you said if the district judge had done that he would have given you more than interest."
1985.85-54,1,19940,charles_stephen_ralston,,2101.676,2104.128,"Yes, but the district court judge--"
1985.85-54,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2104.128,2112.233,"As the Respondent, are you entitled to try to present a theory here that would give you more than you got?"
1985.85-54,1,19940,charles_stephen_ralston,,2112.233,2120.714,"--No, we do not contend that if the Court reached that conclusion that we would now be able to go down and get more money."
1985.85-54,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2240.619,2245.258,Let me go back for a moment to your distinction between loss of use and loss of value.
1985.85-54,1,19940,charles_stephen_ralston,,2254.02,2255.784,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1985.85-54,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2557.43,2559.881,"Do you have anything further, Mr. Rothfeld?"
1985.85-54,2,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2559.881,2562.115,"Just a few quick points, Your Honor."
1985.85-54,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2581.998,2584.731,Does that mean... may I just interrupt.
1985.85-54,2,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2603.473,2604.817,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1985.85-54,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2622.029,2630.714,"Do any of the no interest rule cases on which you rely actually discuss the problem of inflation, as opposed to the problem of loss of use of the money?"
1985.85-54,2,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2630.714,2651.048,"A number of the Court of Appeals decision which address interest on back pay awards under Title VII do discuss that, and Saunders versus Claytor, a Ninth Circuit decision, and one from the District of Columbia Circuit, Blake versus Califano, and both conclude that, relying on this Court's no interest decisions, that there should be no difference between the two, that both are prevented by the no interest rule."
1985.85-54,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2674.226,2682.175,I'm not sure that the change in the value of the money is necessarily covered by the notion compensation for delay.
1985.85-54,2,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2686.189,2696.592,"Well, as the rule has been treated by the Court, again, it hasn't inquired as to whether or not there should be some difference in treatment."
