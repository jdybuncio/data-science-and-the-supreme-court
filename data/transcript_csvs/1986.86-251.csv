1986.86-251,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.356,"We will hear arguments next in No. 86-251, Rockford Life Insurance Company against Illinois Department of Revenue, et al.--"
1986.86-251,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,55.468,77.083,"May it please the Court, this case is here on appeal from the Supreme Court of Illinois."
1986.86-251,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,585.998,590.6,"Mr. Griswold, who is the obligor on these bonds?"
1986.86-251,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,590.6,595.003,The only obligor on these bonds is the United States.
1986.86-251,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,595.003,601.424,There isn't any intermediary between the holder or the payee of the bond and the United States?
1986.86-251,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,601.424,608.43,There is an understructure but the only obligation is the United States.
1986.86-251,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,661.648,665.617,"Well, there it says at the beginning on Page 56, ""The Issuer, Named Below""."
1986.86-251,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,667.469,668.785,No.
1986.86-251,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,679.276,679.776,"Well, here it says,"
1986.86-251,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,686.43,692.084,"But, Mr. Chief Justice, let me just point a little further in it."
1986.86-251,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,734.744,737.344,"Mr. Griswold, may I interrupt Mr. Griswold."
1986.86-251,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,752.22,758.307,"That's what it says, Mr. Justice, but also it says on Page 58:"
1986.86-251,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,774.285,778.337,--And nobody contends in this case that is the case; do they?
1986.86-251,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,778.337,780.856,Nobody contends that that is the case.
1986.86-251,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,780.856,784.474,Including the Government?
1986.86-251,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,784.474,794.996,"Yes, I think the Government agrees in its amicus brief."
1986.86-251,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,819.795,823.015,"Mr. Griswold, who does make the payments?"
1986.86-251,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,826.717,830.503,That all depends upon what actually happens along the way.
1986.86-251,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,854.801,862.574,"--Well, wouldn't the issuer's stockholders object to that and sue the issuer, if the issuer doesn't have any obligation to make those payments?"
1986.86-251,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,865.526,866.776,"No, on the contrary."
1986.86-251,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,887.589,890.324,But he's paying the money to the holder of the certificate.
1986.86-251,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,890.324,893.778,That's because that's the nature of the arrangement.
1986.86-251,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,893.778,900.032,"It's because somewhere there must be a promise to do it, because otherwise he would be sued to death by his stockholders."
1986.86-251,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,900.032,922.679,His promise is effectively to Ginnie Mae as the underlying guarantee to help Ginnie Mae to be in the position to carry out its unqualified guarantee of the payment of interest and principal.
1986.86-251,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,944.878,959.304,Is there another... you're saying that the holder of the bond is a third-party beneficiary of an agreement between the issuer and Ginnie Mae?
1986.86-251,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,959.304,984.519,"Of that he is, but he is the direct promisee of the unqualified pledge of the full faith and credit of the United States made pursuant to an Act of Congress by the Government National Mortgage Association and that is the heart of the case and it is because of that unqualified guarantee that these things have worked."
1986.86-251,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1005.8,1007.569,"Mr. Griswold, can I interrupt you again?"
1986.86-251,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1028.698,1056.717,"That language says that and that calls upon the issuer to perform under an obligation to Ginnie Mae but the only obligation on this certificate, as clearly stated at the top of Page 58, is by Ginnie Mae and it does not constitute a liability of nor evidence any recourse against the issuer."
1986.86-251,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1056.717,1066.907,"Is it your view that it the Kissell Company just kept the monthly payments and took them to South America with them and just turn them over, they would not be liable to Rockford Life Insurance Company?"
1986.86-251,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1066.907,1084.969,"It is my view that there is nothing that the holder could do except to sue Ginnie Mae and, incidentally, it would clearly have a good case in the now United States Claims Court because of a contractual obligation of the United States to the holder of the certificate."
1986.86-251,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1084.969,1087.737,But Ginnie Mae can do some things to it; can't it?
1986.86-251,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1087.737,1090.188,Ginnie Mae could do things; yes.
1986.86-251,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1163.321,1188.286,"Mr. Griswold, one thing strikes me rather peculiarly on the instrument you've given us, and that's in the Joint Appendix, the Kissell Company is named but there isn't anyone who purports to sign on behalf of the Kissell Company, in contrast to immediately below, Ginnie Mae's Secretary and President both attest."
1986.86-251,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1189.804,1195.292,"Well, that is a point made in our brief, that the only signer of this is Ginnie Mae."
1986.86-251,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1210.801,1217.121,You wouldn't need a signature to have liability on it.
1986.86-251,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1229.263,1235.933,"But I think it is irrelevant in view of that language, ""Except as hereinafter undertaken""."
1986.86-251,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1392.901,1394.435,"Mr. Griswold, can I ask you another question?"
1986.86-251,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1401.741,1410.097,"All of these mortgages have to be guaranteed by the Veterans Administration, the Federal Housing Authority and one or two other--"
1986.86-251,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1410.097,1413.465,Do those guarantees precede the liability of Ginnie Mae?
1986.86-251,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1413.465,1427.356,"--They precede it and that is the explanation of why, as appears in the briefs, for the two State briefs, that Ginnie Mae has only paid a nominal sum under its guarantee."
1986.86-251,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1432.926,1442.382,"If they were already guaranteed by one or two other Government agencies, would there have been obligations by the United States within the meaning of the statute, even if they didn't have the Ginnie Mae guarantee?"
1986.86-251,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1442.382,1444.001,--Very likely not.
1986.86-251,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1503.522,1506.474,"Mr. Griswold, this has troubled me from the outset in this case."
1986.86-251,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1514.93,1516.047,"Yes, I think I do."
1986.86-251,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1516.047,1524.217,I keep reading it and reading it and I can't find anything that's hereinafter undertaken.
1986.86-251,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1525.736,1533.057,It is certified that this certificate is legal and regular in all respects.
1986.86-251,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1566.778,1570.063,That much is a commitment of the Kissell Company and nothing else.
1986.86-251,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1570.996,1588.791,"Now, there is a good deal of talk in the other side's briefs about the case of Smith and Davis."
1986.86-251,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1705.519,1707.352,"Thank you, Mr. Griswold."
1986.86-251,1,38259,patricia_rosen,,1713.355,1722.794,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1986.86-251,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1794.557,1802.144,"Ms. Rosen, do you agree, however, that the liability of the issuer is without recourse?"
1986.86-251,1,38259,patricia_rosen,,1802.144,1810.4,"Yes, Your Honor, I agree that the holder of the certificate has no recourse against the issuer."
1986.86-251,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1857.212,1861.032,But not liable to the holder?
1986.86-251,1,38259,patricia_rosen,,1861.032,1862.066,That's correct.
1986.86-251,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1862.066,1863.749,But liable to Ginnie Mae?
1986.86-251,1,38259,patricia_rosen,,1863.749,1869.536,That's correct.
1986.86-251,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1877.126,1903.776,"Well, I thought the reason it might be important that there was an obligor to respond to any complaints on the part of the holder, other than a Government corporation, was part of the language in Smith against Davis, where it says that one of the characteristics of the obligation of the United States is a binding promise by the United States to pay specified sums and specified dates."
1986.86-251,1,38259,patricia_rosen,,1903.776,1918.969,"--But I believe what the Court was referring to in Smith versus Davis is that the promise should not be, as it is in this case, only activated in the event of the default on the basis of the primary obligor, but it should be a binding promise from the beginning."
1986.86-251,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1923.273,1924.457,The primary obligor is the--
1986.86-251,1,38259,patricia_rosen,,1924.457,1925.19,--Yes.
1986.86-251,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1927.909,1929.36,--Who is?
1986.86-251,1,38259,patricia_rosen,,1929.36,1932.712,"The Kissell Company, in this instance that we are discussing."
1986.86-251,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1934.162,1936.914,What obligations does it have?
1986.86-251,1,38259,patricia_rosen,,1936.914,1942.401,"--It's obligated to make payments of principal and interest, in this case, whether or not it receives those payments."
1986.86-251,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1942.401,1945.37,So you just disagree with Mr. Griswold about its obligations?
1986.86-251,1,38259,patricia_rosen,,1945.37,1956.928,"Yes, we do as the Appellate and the Supreme Court disagree with Mr. Griswold that the Kissell Company is not the primary obligor in the certificates."
1986.86-251,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1956.928,1963.665,"If I understand it, you say it is the obligor but can't be sued to enforce its obligations?"
1986.86-251,1,38259,patricia_rosen,,1963.665,1967.219,It can only be sued by Ginnie Mae to enforce its obligations.
1986.86-251,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1982.229,1988.132,If it doesn't collect from the people who signed the mortgages.
1986.86-251,1,38259,patricia_rosen,,1988.132,1990.299,Ginnie Mae does sue.
1986.86-251,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1990.299,1994.452,"I know, but Ginnie Mae can't sue this company."
1986.86-251,1,38259,patricia_rosen,,1994.452,1995.169,Kissell Company.
1986.86-251,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1995.902,2003.058,Suppose all the mortgagees default... all the mortgagors default?
1986.86-251,1,38259,patricia_rosen,,2004.925,2005.76,"Yes, Your Honor."
1986.86-251,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2005.76,2008.546,"Now, is the Kissell Company independently liable to Ginnie Mae--"
1986.86-251,1,38259,patricia_rosen,,2008.546,2009.546,"Yes, Your Honor, under the language--"
1986.86-251,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2009.546,2014.348,--for the amount that is not paid to it?
1986.86-251,1,38259,patricia_rosen,,2014.348,2015.216,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1986.86-251,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2032.927,2040.165,"If we disagree with you on that, what if we agree with Mr. Griswold, then do you lose the case?"
1986.86-251,1,38259,patricia_rosen,,2040.165,2043.35,--Let me understand what you're disagreeing with me on.
1986.86-251,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2043.35,2048.587,The extent of the obligation of the Kissell Company.
1986.86-251,1,38259,patricia_rosen,,2048.587,2056.627,If you agree that Ginnie Mae is the one who has the primary obligation here... is that what you are--
1986.86-251,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2056.627,2067.399,"If we agree with Mr. Griswold that this company, the issuer, has no obligation except to Ginnie Mae."
1986.86-251,1,38259,patricia_rosen,,2071.636,2075.588,--It is obligated under the terms of the certificate to pay the amounts to the holder.
1986.86-251,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2079.891,2081.242,So it has no obligation to the holder?
1986.86-251,1,38259,patricia_rosen,,2081.242,2082.242,Yes.
1986.86-251,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2082.242,2088.831,"That's almost... it sounds like a little bit of gobbledy-gook because on Page 57 it says,--"
1986.86-251,1,38259,patricia_rosen,,2102.572,2109.328,I'm saying it does mean what it... I don't understand why... it means what it says but that obligation cannot be enforced by the person holding the certificate.
1986.86-251,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2109.328,2117.767,But it says you shall pay to the holder but it can't be enforced by the holder.
1986.86-251,1,38259,patricia_rosen,,2117.767,2118.233,Yes.
1986.86-251,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2121.569,2124.504,"It's an obligation to the holder, without recourse?"
1986.86-251,1,38259,patricia_rosen,,2124.504,2125.254,Yes.
1986.86-251,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2125.254,2126.706,That's what it is.
1986.86-251,1,38259,patricia_rosen,,2126.706,2127.373,That's correct.
1986.86-251,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2127.373,2129.173,It's an obligation without recourse.
1986.86-251,1,38259,patricia_rosen,,2137.395,2146.751,"Because that's the nature of the modified pass-through program, is that the issuer must pay whether or not he collects from the mortgagor."
1986.86-251,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2146.751,2150.137,But he must pay to the holder; is that what you're saying?
1986.86-251,1,38259,patricia_rosen,,2150.137,2150.504,Yes.
1986.86-251,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2150.504,2153.523,But the holder can't enforce it?
1986.86-251,1,38259,patricia_rosen,,2153.523,2160.694,"But it's enforceable by Ginnie Mae, not the holder."
1986.86-251,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2195.7,2200.754,May I ask you another question about the intervening layers here?
1986.86-251,1,38259,patricia_rosen,,2200.754,2201.371,"Yes, Your Honor."
1986.86-251,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2201.371,2204.789,Supposing somebody defaults on a mortgage.
1986.86-251,1,38259,patricia_rosen,,2207.825,2209.277,"Yes, Your Honor."
1986.86-251,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2209.277,2215.062,"And eventually the Veterans Administration makes good on the mortgage and so forth, what happens in the interim?"
1986.86-251,1,38259,patricia_rosen,,2225.72,2226.42,Yes.
1986.86-251,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2226.42,2231.107,"So that in a normal default situation, Ginnie Mae doesn't have to become involved at all?"
1986.86-251,1,38259,patricia_rosen,,2231.107,2237.094,That's correct.
1986.86-251,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2310.993,2314.427,"Of course, Illinois has not always taxed these; have they?"
1986.86-251,1,38259,patricia_rosen,,2314.427,2314.778,No.
1986.86-251,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2315.912,2317.196,All right.
1986.86-251,1,38259,patricia_rosen,,2317.196,2326.985,"I believe because, under an earlier interpretation by the Department of Local Government Affairs, they didn't think they were able to impose the tax."
1986.86-251,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2436.658,2441.11,How many states impose a tax like Illinois?
1986.86-251,1,38259,patricia_rosen,,2441.11,2444.479,Very few impose a property tax.
1986.86-251,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2463.457,2466.326,Was there a replacement tax of some kind?
1986.86-251,1,38259,patricia_rosen,,2468.476,2471.293,"Yes, there were a number of replacement taxes issued."
1986.86-251,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2488.239,2490.107,What kind of taxes?
1986.86-251,1,38259,patricia_rosen,,2490.107,2504.367,"I believe it was a wide variety and I can't specifically name a particular... they were state-wide taxes, called replacement taxes but the tax itself was not abolished having anything to do with the issues which are presented by this Court."
1986.86-251,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2700.194,2703.73,What will be the economic result of permitting taxation?
1986.86-251,1,38259,patricia_rosen,,2709.734,2717.239,"--Well, these instruments, as I pointed out, at least the income on the instruments is already taxed and, so, I don't--"
1986.86-251,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2717.239,2719.572,So this would be an additional tax?
1986.86-251,1,38259,patricia_rosen,,2719.572,2720.424,--No.
1986.86-251,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2740.169,2744.14,"What will be the economic effect of the tax, if any?"
1986.86-251,1,38259,patricia_rosen,,2744.14,2748.509,I don't know that there would be a direct economic impact.
1986.86-251,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2748.509,2750.461,Who pays this tax?
1986.86-251,1,38259,patricia_rosen,,2750.461,2753.162,"Well, in this case, Rockford Life."
1986.86-251,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2754.362,2763.301,"Do you think if it knows it is going to have to pay the tax, that it would be as eager to buy these certificates in the future or not?"
1986.86-251,1,38259,patricia_rosen,,2765.903,2774.409,That is the argument which is advanced by the taxpayer in attempting to argue that there is an interference with the Federal program.
1986.86-251,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2774.409,2784.8,"If it would force the interest rate to rise, it will certainly increase the potential liability of Ginnie Mae."
1986.86-251,1,38259,patricia_rosen,,2784.8,2800.359,"Well, Your Honor, I would point out first of all, that there has... since tax is imposed, at least on the income on these certificates in most States, there hasn't been shown to be any serious adverse impact on the operation of the program."
1986.86-251,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2812.034,2814.836,And you say that Ginnie Mae isn't complaining?
1986.86-251,1,38259,patricia_rosen,,2814.836,2819.021,"Ginnie Mae has not complained and certainly under those statistics, should not complain."
1986.86-251,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2825.192,2837.934,"Well Ms. Rosen, I understood the Solicitor General's position to be that they are subject to tax and that the interest rates and costs of these certificates have already taken that into effect."
1986.86-251,1,38259,patricia_rosen,,2839.634,2853.361,"No, Your Honor, that is correct and that is the point I'm attempting to make, is that these are taxed and there has been no adverse impact on the program to date and, therefore, I don't see that there would be any additional impact if you sustain this tax, Your Honor."
1986.86-251,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2853.361,2856.163,May I ask this question?
1986.86-251,1,38259,patricia_rosen,,2862.384,2862.884,That's correct.
1986.86-251,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2862.884,2866.086,Has the United States Government ever had to pay anything on any of them?
1986.86-251,1,38259,patricia_rosen,,2866.086,2867.621,"Yes, Your Honor, they have."
1986.86-251,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2889.034,2900.842,"The issuers are required to furnish bonds to guarantee, fidelity bonds and bonds to guarantee the payments that they undertake to make?"
1986.86-251,1,38259,patricia_rosen,,2900.842,2902.475,"Yes, Your Honor, that is correct."
1986.86-251,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3024.756,3025.99,"Thank you, Ms. Rosen."
1986.86-251,2,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,3033.012,3043.034,"Ms. Rosen's final argument simply ignores Section 742, which is the whole basis of our claim for exemption."
1986.86-251,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3043.034,3047.855,"If you win, would State income taxes on the interest earned be immune?"
1986.86-251,2,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,3047.855,3049.955,That question isn't here.
1986.86-251,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3049.955,3051.573,"Well, I'm asking."
1986.86-251,2,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,3051.573,3056.877,I have thought about it and I can see arguments on both sides of it.
1986.86-251,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3056.877,3060.163,"Under the section you rely on, doesn't it say interest?"
1986.86-251,2,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,3060.163,3076.356,"It says ""income"" but the question is whether the income is actually paid by the United States or is paid by the mortgagees through the issuer to the holder."
1986.86-251,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3082.342,3084.778,"In any event, States have been taxing the income?"
1986.86-251,2,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,3084.778,3088.813,"--In any event, States have been taxing the income."
1986.86-251,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3175.702,3177.202,"Thank you, Mr. Griswold."
