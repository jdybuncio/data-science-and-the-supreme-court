1973.73-846,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,33.673,We’ll hear our arguments next in 73-846 Wingo against Wedding.
1973.73-846,0,32696,james_m_ringo,,38.297,41.68,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1973.73-846,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,254.58,268.396,"Does the rule of the District Court not also provide that either party, upon request, may require the district judge to hear and listen to the transcript of the testimony?"
1973.73-846,0,32696,james_m_ringo,,268.396,268.837,"Yes, that’s true Your Honor."
1973.73-846,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,268.837,271.393,You may have said but if you did I missed it.
1973.73-846,0,32696,james_m_ringo,,271.393,275.174,"I didn’t say that, but it’s true."
1973.73-846,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,315.776,320.269,"Mr. Ringo, do you know that the US Magistrate have to be a lawyer?"
1973.73-846,0,32696,james_m_ringo,,320.269,329.676,The act requires Your Honor that the full-time US Magistrate should be a lawyer except in situations where they are not available in the districts.
1973.73-846,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,329.676,331.715,"So, he might not be?"
1973.73-846,0,32696,james_m_ringo,,331.715,333.031,"That’s right, Your Honor."
1973.73-846,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,333.031,347.944,"So you might have a situation where US Magistrate is proposing the findings and conclusions when he is not a lawyer, even though a conviction for instance has been affirmed up through the Kentucky Court System."
1973.73-846,0,32696,james_m_ringo,,351.122,360.92,"In the instant case, it does not, because our Magistrate was a lawyer."
1973.73-846,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,376.406,382.933,Do you know whether there are any full-time Magistrates in the United States who have been appointed now serving who are not lawyers?
1973.73-846,0,32696,james_m_ringo,,382.933,385.149,I have no statistics on that.
1973.73-846,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,503.969,528.164,"Mr. Ringo, what comment do you have about the provision in 636 (b) (3) zeroing in on preliminary review of applications for posttrial relief, and enough with -- to facilitate the decision of a district judge having jurisdiction over the case has whether there should be a hearing?"
1973.73-846,0,32696,james_m_ringo,,528.164,542.826,The intention of Congress on that 636 (b) subsection (3) was clear that this was merely a suggested rather than a required duty.
1973.73-846,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,567.224,583.134,"Well, I suppose a district judge might after listening to the reading of the proposed finding, the report and recommendations and listening to the electronic recording might then decide to conduct a full-scale hearing himself."
1973.73-846,0,32696,james_m_ringo,,583.134,601.521,"Well, that’s where within his providence the district judge can accept, reject, demand, or do what he wants to with the Magistrates report, findings of facts, conclusion of low and so forth."
1973.73-846,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,623.35,642.655,"Did the Sixth Circuit touch upon the constitution issue at all, or did they decide as a matter of statutory construction?"
1973.73-846,0,32696,james_m_ringo,,642.655,646.28,"Primarily, statutory construction -- I mean if they are ever used in generous --"
1973.73-846,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,646.28,670.11,"And if we should disagree with them, do you think then that the case should be remanded to have them considered constitutional issue in the first place?"
1973.73-846,0,32696,james_m_ringo,,670.11,674.913,The constitutional issue should be considered.
1973.73-846,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,696.196,704.452,What sort of a proceeding do you have before Judge Gordon in the District Court after the Magistrate has made findings like these?
1973.73-846,0,32696,james_m_ringo,,706.85,709.956,In this case there were no oral arguments.
1973.73-846,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,709.956,721.827,"How did the matter go up to them, the report of the Magistrate and briefs of the parties?"
1973.73-846,0,32696,james_m_ringo,,721.827,733.203,The matter was before the Court on a petition in response to the petition that came back on a Sixth Circuit on the first reverse and remand.
1973.73-846,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,764.907,776.097,Did the parties have an opportunity to brief or object to the findings of the Magistrate before Judge Gordon?
1973.73-846,0,32696,james_m_ringo,,776.097,782.851,"I don’t believe that there was any objection, any objection made by the party."
1973.73-846,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,802.844,809.897,"And judge can never (Inaudible), never saw them and never had them testified?"
1973.73-846,0,32696,james_m_ringo,,809.897,811.098,That’s true.
1973.73-846,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,811.098,815.166,How could he weight the evidence?
1973.73-846,0,32696,james_m_ringo,,815.166,823.689,"He can consider the evidence in light of the state records, he gave a de novo consideration --"
1973.73-846,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,823.689,827.368,What was the sense of having an evidentiary hearing?
1973.73-846,0,32696,james_m_ringo,,827.368,837.61,To get before the Court all the facts and -- this is why the Congress set up the judicial tier of Magistrates.
1973.73-846,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,837.61,841.576,I thought the Constitution set up Article III Judges.
1973.73-846,0,32696,james_m_ringo,,841.576,850.723,We submitted that Article III Judges are vested with the judicial power of the United States or the power to decide.
1973.73-846,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,854.762,856.949,Did they upgrade them to Article III Judges?
1973.73-846,0,32696,james_m_ringo,,856.949,857.597,"No, Your Honor."
1973.73-846,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,857.597,858.699,"Well, how far?"
1973.73-846,0,32696,james_m_ringo,,858.699,862.964,They went far enough to give in the qualifications which would enable them --
1973.73-846,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,862.964,876.403,"So that what he could do is take the transcript of the testimony, the tapes of the hearing, the recommendations of the Magistrate and just sign the recommendations and not change a word of them."
1973.73-846,0,32696,james_m_ringo,,876.403,877.897,If he thinks that they are adequately prepared.
1973.73-846,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,877.897,880.03,And that’s your argument in Article III judge?
1973.73-846,0,32696,james_m_ringo,,880.03,881.14,"No, Your Honor."
1973.73-846,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,881.14,882.797,Not mine neither.
1973.73-846,0,32696,james_m_ringo,,882.797,884.248,They have upgraded the --
1973.73-846,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,884.248,886.614,"Of the judge, I am not going to the Magistrates."
1973.73-846,0,32696,james_m_ringo,,900.66,901.255,It was the intention of --
1973.73-846,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,901.255,903.748,Am I wrong?
1973.73-846,0,32696,james_m_ringo,,908.124,913.15,It’s his job to determine the ultimate fact.
1973.73-846,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,947.602,949.495,"Very well, Mr. Ringo."
1973.73-846,1,30537,joseph_g_glass,,951.554,957.516,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1973.73-846,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1006.473,1016.033,"Well, what do you think Section (2) of the statute means, “Assistance to a trial judge in the conduct of pretrial or discovery proceedings in civil or criminal?”"
1973.73-846,1,30537,joseph_g_glass,,1022.126,1022.476,No sir.
1973.73-846,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1024.571,1030.652,"Well, what criminal matters, what pretrial criminal matters do you think Section (2), subsection (2) covers?"
1973.73-846,1,30537,joseph_g_glass,,1030.652,1044.986,"I would think that -- It’s my impression Mr. Chief Justice that that would encompass something like a pretrial conference, whereby the party litigants through counsel --"
1973.73-846,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1044.986,1047.93,Do you have many pretrial conferences in civil cases?
1973.73-846,1,30537,joseph_g_glass,,1047.93,1048.764,"Yes, sir in our --"
1973.73-846,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1048.764,1051.24,"In criminal cases, I mean to say?"
1973.73-846,1,30537,joseph_g_glass,,1051.24,1053.063,There are few.
1973.73-846,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1053.8,1057.661,"Well, are they directors of the suppression type motion?"
1973.73-846,1,30537,joseph_g_glass,,1057.661,1063.655,Many of them are the suppression type of motions or motions on the constitutionality of statutes and things of that matter.
1973.73-846,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1072.116,1080.814,Why is it that you say that a Magistrate couldn’t hear a suppression matter under the paragraph (2).
1973.73-846,1,30537,joseph_g_glass,,1083.775,1099.382,"As I interpret Criminal Rule 41 and as I have read the cases, that’s within the providence of a District Court Judge and that is a fact-finding process, and I think that’s what we’re talking about here in these proceedings, fact-finding processes."
1973.73-846,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1099.382,1107.789,"Well, but paragraph (1) of the rule talks about services of Special Master in an appropriate civil action. Certainly that is a fact-finding."
1973.73-846,1,30537,joseph_g_glass,,1107.789,1108.16,"Yes, sir."
1973.73-846,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1111.159,1120.552,"Well, is this not advisory when the report is subject to requiring the judge to listen to the tape recording?"
1973.73-846,1,30537,joseph_g_glass,,1120.552,1134.282,"Not as this Court, in 1941, interpreted Holiday versus Johnson and later, in 1963, interpreted Townsend versus Sain when it talked about the demeanor of witnesses and the credibility of witnesses."
1973.73-846,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1137.672,1155.301,"Well, if a challenge has made there, is there anything in the statute that prevents the judge from saying, if the -- after he has listened to the tape recording that I think there are serious and possibly difficult questions of credibility here and so will set this down for a hearing."
1973.73-846,1,30537,joseph_g_glass,,1158.43,1160.706,The rule 636 -- of our local rule?
1973.73-846,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1160.706,1163.065,"No, Section (3) of the statute."
1973.73-846,1,30537,joseph_g_glass,,1163.065,1163.999,Yes sir.
1973.73-846,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1165.293,1177.176,And the submission of the language which I am referring to and the submission of a report and recommendations to facilitate the decision of the district judge having jurisdiction over the case as to whether or not there should be a hearing.
1973.73-846,1,30537,joseph_g_glass,,1181.725,1192.334,"Well, I think that’s the purpose of the Act was intended for the Magistrate to be recommending agency and not an evidentiary hearing judge."
1973.73-846,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1192.334,1198.612,"Well, but do you mean the judge must have a hearing in every case after the Magistrate has had a hearing?"
1973.73-846,1,30537,joseph_g_glass,,1198.612,1198.969,"No, sir."
1973.73-846,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1232.136,1245.1,"Well that go at least as far as having the Magistrate sufficiently examine the matter that to be able to say to the district judge, “It’s my recommendation to you don’t have a hearing.”"
1973.73-846,1,30537,joseph_g_glass,,1245.1,1250.568,I think that’s permissible because lower courts have been functioning in that capacity for years.
1973.73-846,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1253.478,1257.679,But he can’t -- in your submission that he can’t and so the Sixth Circuit held.
1973.73-846,1,30537,joseph_g_glass,,1264.499,1286.145,"That is our contention Your Honor based on Holiday versus Johnson and actually Townsend versus Sain when it talks about the providence of the district judge’s weigh the credibility and demeanor of the witnesses which is unquestionably very important, and perhaps, in many instances, the most important step in the habeas corpus matter as such."
1973.73-846,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1286.145,1295.084,What about the special masters that district court judges appoint in particular cases to take evidence?
1973.73-846,1,30537,joseph_g_glass,,1295.084,1318.914,"To take evidence in civil cases Your Honor, that’s -- I am not that familiar with, in criminal cases they are not allowed, and then going back to Holiday versus Johnson 1971, Payne versus Wingo when our Sixth Circuit held at the special master, and in this case, it was the duly appointed United States Commissioner."
1973.73-846,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1320.83,1325.354,"Well, I understand that, but how about a civil case special master?"
1973.73-846,1,30537,joseph_g_glass,,1325.354,1338.475,"In a civil case, he is allowed under the laws as I have read them Mr. Justice White to take depositions and things of that nature, but within an evidentiary --"
1973.73-846,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1338.475,1341.962,But he is entitled to take evidence and prepare report.
1973.73-846,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1341.962,1344.337,-- and submit findings.
1973.73-846,1,30537,joseph_g_glass,,1344.337,1346.516,As an adviser.
1973.73-846,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1346.516,1349.02,To which there are exceptions then by a counsel?
1973.73-846,1,30537,joseph_g_glass,,1353.372,1363.318,"Mr. Justice Brennan, both the petitioner and the respondent have cited cases for example TPO, Inc."
1973.73-846,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1373.661,1375.804,"The masters, the masters, I am been talking about the masters."
1973.73-846,1,30537,joseph_g_glass,,1375.804,1381.146,"Well, here again, I think, it can’t be part of the decision-making process."
1973.73-846,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1381.146,1392.776,"But nevertheless, there will be special masters appointed and the evidence will be taken by the special master and the judge will ultimately determine the facts without ever having seen the witnesses."
1973.73-846,1,30537,joseph_g_glass,,1392.776,1396.17,"Well, in civil proceedings, I have less concerned about that than I do --"
1973.73-846,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1396.17,1396.594,"Well, this is a civil proceeding."
1973.73-846,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1396.594,1403.502,"But isn’t the case, isn’t that true, isn’t it true that that’s what happens on the civil side with special master?"
1973.73-846,1,30537,joseph_g_glass,,1403.502,1409.877,I am not that knowledgeable Mr. Justice White to really give you a good answer on that.
1973.73-846,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1409.877,1418.898,"Are not all the cases in the United States Court of Claims cases that involve many millions of dollars, tried just that way?"
1973.73-846,1,30537,joseph_g_glass,,1418.898,1419.578,"Yes, sir."
1973.73-846,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1420.106,1426.795,"The Commissioner who makes a report and recommendations, and the Court then reviews it and decides to accept or reject."
1973.73-846,1,30537,joseph_g_glass,,1426.795,1449.745,"I am reading some of the background on habeas corpus as this is my understanding, but here again, some of the authors and I believe that’s been covered in (Inaudible) Jury Trials and article by Mr. Skoku (ph) and also an 83 Harvard Law Review that has defined this type of proceedings as advisory proceedings."
1973.73-846,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1451.319,1454.405,"This is a civil proceeding that we are reviewing hear, isn’t it?"
1973.73-846,1,30537,joseph_g_glass,,1455.575,1466.92,It’s denominated as such Mr. Justice Rehnquist but I don’t think it’s fully -- I would go back to legislative history on that where Mr. Fred Vinson had some colloquy --
1973.73-846,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1466.92,1469.041,Mr. Carl Vinson supposedly.
1973.73-846,1,30537,joseph_g_glass,,1469.041,1469.844,Mr. Fred Vinson.
1973.73-846,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1469.844,1470.41,Judge Fred Vinson?
1973.73-846,1,30537,joseph_g_glass,,1470.41,1471.235,Yes sir.
1973.73-846,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1471.235,1475.426,"Well, but he -- do you think he prevailed or -- [Laughter]"
1973.73-846,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1475.426,1480.847,"As I gather, Senator Tydings gave him rather a difficult time, well, didn’t he?"
1973.73-846,1,30537,joseph_g_glass,,1480.847,1482.967,"Yes sir, he sure did but --"
1973.73-846,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1482.967,1490.52,"Didn’t he say in response to one question when Mr. Vinson said, he assumed that he did not intend to cover some of these things."
1973.73-846,1,30537,joseph_g_glass,,1518.787,1519.007,"Yes, sir."
1973.73-846,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1522.967,1531.327,"I suppose really your emphasis on Holiday, you get back to the fact that the words used to be Court Justice or Judge."
1973.73-846,1,30537,joseph_g_glass,,1531.327,1532.094,"Yes, sir."
1973.73-846,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1532.094,1534.955,And then the Congress amended it just to make it court.
1973.73-846,1,30537,joseph_g_glass,,1534.955,1535.524,"Yes, sir."
1973.73-846,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1535.524,1548.29,"And yet your circuit at least said that, that made no change and obviously, whatever else might be to the Magistrates Act -- I mean Habeas Corpus Act always said court, meant court."
1973.73-846,1,30537,joseph_g_glass,,1549.798,1553.595,28 U.S.C. 2243 speaks in specific.
1973.73-846,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1553.595,1561.488,"That’s really the gist of it, and I guess that -- I gather that’s actually the basis for Sixth Circuit both in this case and in Wingo?"
1973.73-846,1,30537,joseph_g_glass,,1561.488,1581.334,"Yes sir, and here again going back to the legislative history, initially, when the statute was drafted, it provided for preliminary consideration rather than preliminary review and because of all of the evidence that came out as a result of the hearings, they have redrafted the legislation to a preliminary review for of posttrial."
1973.73-846,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1581.334,1584.453,But the statute certainly (Inaudible)?
1973.73-846,1,30537,joseph_g_glass,,1584.453,1585.334,Unquestionably.
1973.73-846,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1585.334,1606.235,"So, Mr. Glass, what is your comment about the provision and the statute that giving the Magistrate the power to conduct certain trials under Section 3401 of the Code, if he has that power, what is so wrong with giving him the power to conduct a preliminary hearing?"
1973.73-846,1,30537,joseph_g_glass,,1606.235,1615.7,"Mr. Justice Blackmun, there are some provisions in that statute which I think are important for this Court to consider."
1973.73-846,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1681.017,1686.363,"Mr. Glass, how far do you think the Magistrates can go on a habeas?"
1973.73-846,1,30537,joseph_g_glass,,1686.363,1688.177,On a habeas?
1973.73-846,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1718.382,1721.093,Can he recommend that no hearing is necessary?
1973.73-846,1,30537,joseph_g_glass,,1721.093,1722.278,"Certainly, I think that is within the district judge --"
1973.73-846,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1722.278,1727.324,"And if the judge doesn’t -- if the judge accepts that, then you see no problem with it?"
1973.73-846,1,30537,joseph_g_glass,,1727.324,1736.283,"If he is recommending as a matter of law, I don’t think there’s anything that -- I think he is authorized to do that under the Act."
1973.73-846,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1736.283,1748.453,"Mr. Glass, did you object during the proceedings before the Magistrate that he was not empowered or ought not to be conducting to serve the hearing."
1973.73-846,1,30537,joseph_g_glass,,1748.453,1758.249,"In the point of fact Mr. Justice Rehnquist, I filed a motion, a lengthy motion with the memorandum brief to disqualify the Magistrate from holding the evidentiary hearing prior to it and I --"
1973.73-846,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1758.249,1759.504,Is this that in the records somewhere?
1973.73-846,1,30537,joseph_g_glass,,1759.504,1776.962,"Yes, sir and it’s contained in the Appendix on Pages 15, 16 and the memorandum, the 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26 and 27."
