2004.03-1388,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,0.0,7.225,We'll now hear argument in Spector against the Norwegian Cruise Line.
2004.03-1388,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,8.545,11.107,"Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court:"
2004.03-1388,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,43.179,58.662,"Mr. Goldstein, may I inquire of you whether other countries, for instance, in the EU area, have applied their own disability laws to some of the cruise ships that touch base in their courts?"
2004.03-1388,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,58.662,64.066,"Justice O'Connor, our research does not reveal that the question has arisen in the EU."
2004.03-1388,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,129.062,129.228,Thank you.
2004.03-1388,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,169.186,173.523,"No, and you have put your finger on the point, and that is that there are no conflicts."
2004.03-1388,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,190.241,191.356,Are they in effect yet?
2004.03-1388,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,191.356,202.063,"--They are not, but in terms of whether or not the statute, when it's applied, would conflict, you would look to this document and they took as their regulatory mission to make sure there were no such conflicts."
2004.03-1388,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,271.315,274.205,"Can you tell me just a little bit about that, how it works?"
2004.03-1388,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,304.919,323.7,"I would think on the question of the charging double, the answer to that question would be no because it would present a traditional, not unique to the ADA, choice of law question, and that is, if you're in England and you buy a ticket in England, your ticket is going to be subject to English common... in that case, the English disability law."
2004.03-1388,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,368.942,402.173,"Mr. Goldstein, may... may I take it from your answer that it doesn't make any difference in your view, your answer to the question about the... the ship leaving from a port in England and going many places and touching base in New York, that kind of a voyage, or what this case seems to be where the vast majority of the passengers are from the United States, the port of departure is in the United States, the port of return is in the United States."
2004.03-1388,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,416.375,418.604,"--I think your formulation is exactly right, Justice Ginsburg."
2004.03-1388,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,447.582,451.464,But if we go back to what is the more usual situation--
2004.03-1388,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,451.464,451.935,--Yes.
2004.03-1388,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,451.935,457.136,"--Then you are, in effect, saying that the U.S. rules the world."
2004.03-1388,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,491.316,496.517,"Justice Ginsburg, we disagree with the characterization that the U.S. rules the world, of course."
2004.03-1388,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,516.745,529.749,We... we could... we could require ships that are docked in the United States to pay their crews according to United States Jones Act requirements or United States minimum wage laws and so forth.
2004.03-1388,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,545.724,550.554,"--Well, Justice Scalia, I actually disagree with your characterization and would like to point you to a couple of precedents."
2004.03-1388,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,581.019,583.126,Was... was that the ship or was it longshoremen?
2004.03-1388,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,583.126,586.758,--It was longshoremen working on the ship complaining about safety conditions on the ship.
2004.03-1388,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,586.758,586.924,Longshoremen.
2004.03-1388,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,589.32,591.299,"Based on shore, but so are the passengers."
2004.03-1388,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,591.299,591.838,That's a different--
2004.03-1388,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,591.838,595.303,"But it is a different situation, but I think it's more analogous."
2004.03-1388,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,605.045,607.896,What's... what's the scope of what you're talking about here?
2004.03-1388,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,629.583,632.992,"--The... well, that... the definition... we would have to return to the ADA."
2004.03-1388,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,640.794,641.166,Because?
2004.03-1388,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,654.375,654.996,--It's cheaper.
2004.03-1388,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,655.922,657.475,I'm not aware of... of--
2004.03-1388,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,657.475,657.968,"No, no."
2004.03-1388,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,660.197,660.363,--Yes.
2004.03-1388,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,660.363,665.853,But I am aware of... of people who have certainly gone on cruises on what is a primarily merchant ship.
2004.03-1388,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,668.742,670.04,If... let me--
2004.03-1388,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,670.04,689.054,"Are you talking... because I think that makes a difference for the reason that once you talk about those, you're talking about primarily foreign flagged vessels that are rarely but sometimes in the United States where the costs would be very high probably to change the ship and the benefit to Americans would be tiny."
2004.03-1388,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,691.283,691.488,--Okay.
2004.03-1388,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,799.562,803.361,"Yes, but I... if I understand you correctly, your case really isn't limited to cruise ships."
2004.03-1388,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,809.427,812.499,"--Yes, but I... I take it that the... you know--"
2004.03-1388,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,812.499,818.676,And the fact that it's based in Miami or it had mostly American customers really is not relevant to the legal issue.
2004.03-1388,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,819.252,825.031,--It... it is in the sense that it makes this the recurring scenario that Congress would have been aware of when it enacted the ADA in--
2004.03-1388,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,825.031,830.415,"But, of course, they would have been aware of those that are also less American in their patronage and so forth."
2004.03-1388,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,830.415,830.975,--That's true.
2004.03-1388,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,840.513,846.662,"No, but we're not necessarily thinking of a cruise ship, just the transatlantic liner that goes from Liverpool to Miami or something."
2004.03-1388,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,847.572,849.262,It would in... in U.S. territory.
2004.03-1388,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,849.801,857.603,But there's no way they can change the ship structurally when it's in New York and not have it changed structurally when it's in Europe.
2004.03-1388,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,900.078,907.319,"Let me tell you what I know, and that is that the other side has not identified any problems of this... this type."
2004.03-1388,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,923.483,952.273,"But you told me... and I want to make sure this is your answer... that it doesn't matter, that as long as the ship comes to a U.S. port as part of this overall journey, you... you answered that question and I thought that was your candid answer, that it doesn't matter that these... these particular cruise ships ply mostly U.S. waters and U.S. trade and are centered, even have their principal place of business in the United States."
2004.03-1388,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,980.574,992.751,"Justice Ginsburg, here I think is the difference, and that is, that while U.S. law may have an extraterritorial consequence, just like our maritime tort law and the like, you cannot in Europe enforce the ADA."
2004.03-1388,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,994.238,1000.515,"Well, you can enforce the... the discrimination provisions, but the structural provisions don't have to be enforced."
2004.03-1388,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1004.352,1005.095,--That's right.
2004.03-1388,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1014.55,1021.237,"Well, it rules the world unless the world does not want to use the United States ports as ports of call."
2004.03-1388,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1021.237,1032.959,"Justice... Justice Souter, I... I simply disagree, and that is, when you talk about the U.S. ruling the world, in a... in the context, say, of ARAMCO, we talked about the enforceability of U.S. law abroad."
2004.03-1388,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1052.733,1054.136,We're not questioning the authority.
2004.03-1388,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1063.507,1066.684,"Justice Scalia, we disagree, and let me just take you to your cases."
2004.03-1388,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1087.589,1089.884,"But, Mr. Goldstein, there's another aspect that troubles me."
2004.03-1388,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1104.102,1106.437,--That is... that is a difficult question.
2004.03-1388,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1109.575,1110.69,"In other words, I'm trying to understand."
2004.03-1388,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1112.093,1112.381,No.
2004.03-1388,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1112.381,1116.718,--with respect to what would otherwise be violations of the statute that occur on the high seas.
2004.03-1388,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1116.718,1122.867,"We do believe it would be covered because the accommodation was purchased here, although we haven't raised the claim in this Court."
2004.03-1388,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1124.37,1132.072,"Yes, but I think we should... the cruise ships are entitled to know whether they may freely discriminate against people in the casinos and so forth when they're on the high seas."
2004.03-1388,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1132.072,1132.443,--We--
2004.03-1388,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1132.443,1133.269,You don't know the answer to that.
2004.03-1388,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1133.269,1145.696,"--Justice Stevens, our position is that because of the definition of commerce in the ADA, when you purchase a public accommodation in the United States, that is an agreement to provide a public accommodation and it doesn't--"
2004.03-1388,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1145.696,1148.956,So your view is not limited to what happens in the territorial waters.
2004.03-1388,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1148.956,1157.146,"--That is right, although we have... we would win the case on the internal waters and the territorial waters, and we haven't asserted in this Court a claim relating to the high seas."
2004.03-1388,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1159.192,1179.997,"Mr. Salmons, may I ask before you begin whether the United States agrees that the statute would apply to the activities of these ships when they're on the high seas?"
2004.03-1388,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,1179.997,1183.236,"Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court:"
2004.03-1388,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1206.913,1210.934,When... when the ship is out on the high seas?
2004.03-1388,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,1210.934,1212.403,"That's correct, Justice Scalia."
2004.03-1388,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1212.403,1213.229,You think that's a hard question--
2004.03-1388,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,1213.229,1213.617,No.
2004.03-1388,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1214.815,1217.399,--whether that's an extraterritorial application of U.S. law?
2004.03-1388,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,1217.399,1217.649,--No.
2004.03-1388,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1224.912,1225.284,Do you--
2004.03-1388,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1225.284,1233.707,"I don't know what extraterritorial application means if it doesn't mean that, that a ship that is not in the United States is bound by United States law."
2004.03-1388,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,1236.346,1244.686,"The reason, Justice Scalia, would be because the accommodation that was offered, that was entered into, and that began in the United States... and... and I would point out... I think this is important to keep in mind--"
2004.03-1388,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1244.686,1252.859,What you're saying is it would... I thought you were saying that it would be the enforcement of the domestic contract of which the... the statutory provisions would be an implied term.
2004.03-1388,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,1253.415,1253.953,--Yes.
2004.03-1388,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1254.984,1256.925,It does not apply of its own force.
2004.03-1388,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,1262.953,1263.901,That's correct.
2004.03-1388,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1277.564,1278.307,"Well, then if you--"
2004.03-1388,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,1278.307,1284.806,"--if you have an ADA claim that governs that even if the discrimination occurred abroad, that would only relate to those things tied into the accommodation."
2004.03-1388,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1284.806,1288.893,"--But if you're on a round trip ticket from Liverpool to Miami and back, it would depend on where you bought the ticket."
2004.03-1388,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,1288.893,1296.778,"Well, again, we... we think that if accommodation begins here in the United States, that... that a necessary term of that is nondiscrimination."
2004.03-1388,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1303.176,1304.847,"Yes, but Justice Stevens' question is you buy the ticket in Liverpool."
2004.03-1388,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,1310.335,1310.812,To come to the United States.
2004.03-1388,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1310.812,1313.207,Is the ADA an applied term of that contract?
2004.03-1388,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,1313.207,1319.728,"I would... I would assume not, although the question then would be whether or not it's a public accommodation that's been offered in the United States."
2004.03-1388,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1319.728,1320.283,Don't... don't all--
2004.03-1388,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1320.283,1321.093,Even in U.S. waters?
2004.03-1388,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,1336.613,1338.183,"No, no, Justice Kennedy, that's not our position."
2004.03-1388,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1349.822,1350.122,--Do you--
2004.03-1388,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1350.122,1350.815,"Well, that means--"
2004.03-1388,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,1350.815,1351.741,If... if you had a situation... I'm sorry.
2004.03-1388,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1351.741,1352.384,"--No, go ahead."
2004.03-1388,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,1352.384,1373.189,"If you had a situation where you had a ship that... let's say, that began in... in Great Britain and came here, it didn't pick up passengers here in the United States, I think that the better view would be, sure, United States law could apply to it because it's in our internal waters, but that as a substantive matter, with regard to the ADA, I don't know why that would be a public accommodation within the meaning of the ADA because it's not an accommodation that's offered--"
2004.03-1388,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1373.189,1373.849,--But do you--
2004.03-1388,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,1373.849,1375.79,--or available to United States residents.
2004.03-1388,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1375.79,1404.851,"--Do you agree with Mr. Goldstein that nothing turns on... one might characterize this kind of cruise as U.S. centered, but his answer was as long as they put in, a regular cruise stop, they pick up, unload passengers, they take them back again on the ship, so long as they touch base at a U.S. port, letting off and picking up passengers, the ADA applies?"
2004.03-1388,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,1406.997,1409.476,"As I understand what Your Honor just said, I think that I would."
2004.03-1388,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1417.111,1417.854,This is my--
2004.03-1388,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,1417.854,1419.257,"--in the United States, and if the answer is yes--"
2004.03-1388,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1419.257,1423.594,--Let... let me ask you the same question that I asked Mr. Goldstein.
2004.03-1388,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,1456.37,1466.234,"--Well, again, I... not as a matter of... not as a matter of extraterritorial application of U.S. law, but that is our position with regard to a public accommodation that begins in the United States."
2004.03-1388,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1467.887,1478.14,"Suppose it doesn't begin in the United States in that it... it starts in, say, The Bahamas, and stops at--"
2004.03-1388,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,1478.14,1480.269,"--I should probably should not have said begin, Your Honor."
2004.03-1388,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1488.814,1490.179,Then you're saying exactly what everybody is worried about.
2004.03-1388,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,1558.25,1558.456,Sure.
2004.03-1388,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1578.518,1582.399,"Well, you're saying that this is your position, but don't worry about it because we'll reject your position?"
2004.03-1388,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,1582.399,1582.687,"--No, no."
2004.03-1388,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1586.902,1600.277,"One thing might be true, what you're not saying, is there really aren't very many of those ships, or another thing you might say, which you're not saying because maybe isn't true, is almost all of those ships that there are are already subject to tougher... tougher rules, say, in Europe."
2004.03-1388,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,1602.173,1602.628,--No.
2004.03-1388,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1603.166,1605.024,"Since you don't you say either of those, I think neither may be true."
2004.03-1388,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,1605.024,1605.933,"--Well, I don't know the specific number."
2004.03-1388,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1632.023,1634.002,--It depends on what... what kind of laws you're talking about.
2004.03-1388,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,1645.852,1648.12,"Justice Scalia, you're correct, and that's precisely why they have--"
2004.03-1388,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1648.12,1657.408,"And laws... laws that require structural alteration of a ship are quite different from laws that say while you're in United States waters, you won't discriminate on the basis of race."
2004.03-1388,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,1657.408,1660.008,"--If... two... two responses, if I may, Your Honor."
2004.03-1388,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1684.861,1686.552,"If we haven't expressed it yet, we ought to express it then."
2004.03-1388,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,1686.552,1687.295,"--Well, I disagree, Your Honor."
2004.03-1388,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1728.846,1744.199,"Mr. Salmons, one of the alternatives you threw out, not as a response to clear statement, but as a... a response to the issue that was being raised by it, was the provision of the statute that it was intended to exercise the... the fullest extent of the... of the commerce power."
2004.03-1388,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,1754.23,1757.946,"--Well, I... I would disagree with that on... on a couple of respects."
2004.03-1388,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1770.743,1772.685,"Well, may I just ask you a... a factual question?"
2004.03-1388,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,1784.945,1785.482,"--Absolutely, Justice Souter."
2004.03-1388,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1787.053,1787.508,And it's not in McCulloch.
2004.03-1388,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,1787.508,1788.251,--That's correct.
2004.03-1388,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1805.136,1806.538,"Thank you, Mr. Salmons."
2004.03-1388,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,1812.028,1821.399,"Thank you, Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court:"
2004.03-1388,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1828.913,1830.111,Could you address the last point?
2004.03-1388,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,1830.111,1830.521,--Yes.
2004.03-1388,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1869.53,1871.842,So it... it doesn't have the fullest extent language then.
2004.03-1388,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,1871.842,1872.396,--That's correct.
2004.03-1388,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1873.245,1877.126,How does it compare to title II of the Civil Rights Act of 1964?
2004.03-1388,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,1877.126,1894.05,"Well, there are slight differences in the language, but I don't think that's dispositive because title VII of the Civil Rights Act, which this Court addressed in the ARAMCO case, the Court... the Chief Justice's opinion there said that that language was not enough to express the intent."
2004.03-1388,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1894.05,1900.077,"So that would be the same for title II, which is the public accommodations part of the Civil Rights Act of 1964."
2004.03-1388,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,1918.16,1929.593,"It's all a question of congressional intent, Justice Ginsburg, and there's no indication of an intent that Congress needed to address any problem that arose with respect to that form of discrimination."
2004.03-1388,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1929.593,1945.485,"So your... but your answer is, there being no such indication, that a ship putting in at a U.S. port was free to discriminate among its passengers on the basis of race."
2004.03-1388,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,1945.485,1950.111,"Well, there would be no U.S. congressional statute that would address that, Justice Ginsburg."
2004.03-1388,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1954.569,1964.311,"I'm asking about the U.S. law and policy which says no segregation, no discrimination in places of public accommodation."
2004.03-1388,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,1964.311,1968.937,"--As I said, I'm not aware that there has ever been an instance of that in the cruise industry."
2004.03-1388,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1978.058,1981.484,"Well, but this is a good question, and what is your position?"
2004.03-1388,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,1995.89,2004.618,"--Justice O'Connor, our position is that Congress has not spoken to the question, and so there is no congressional statute that is on point."
2004.03-1388,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2004.618,2011.783,"Then your answer, I take it, is yes, it can discriminate and it can discriminate because Congress has not told it not to."
2004.03-1388,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2012.526,2012.709,No.
2004.03-1388,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2017.606,2020.411,"So far as United States law is concerned, it could."
2004.03-1388,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2020.411,2021.321,--Yes.
2004.03-1388,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2021.321,2025.036,And the same answer for 1981?
2004.03-1388,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2025.036,2041.754,"Justice Ginsburg, as I said, Congress has not extended its laws to the full reach of U.S. territorial power, and this Court has maintained that position ever since the Charming Betsy case 200 years ago, The Schooner Exchange case, and Brown v. Duchesne."
2004.03-1388,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2041.754,2042.663,"Well, let's put it this way."
2004.03-1388,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2054.386,2063.84,"What you say, Justice Kennedy, is that the clear statement canon requires Congress to say when it intends to apply a law to a foreign vessel."
2004.03-1388,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2065.243,2074.159,"But if I'm writing the opinion and I put that down and rule for you, it seems to me that I then answered necessarily Justice Ginsburg's question in the negative."
2004.03-1388,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2074.159,2075.646,"You do, Justice Kennedy."
2004.03-1388,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2084.645,2085.217,But these--
2004.03-1388,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2085.217,2093.562,"--Justice Kennedy, Congress hasn't extended criminal laws of the United States to the full reach of U.S. power."
2004.03-1388,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2100.249,2102.19,"Mr. Frederick, this is... this is what concerns me about your answer."
2004.03-1388,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2120.411,2124.192,Approximately two thirds to three quarters in any given year.
2004.03-1388,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2124.192,2131.457,And does it normally start the voyage and end it in U.S. ports?
2004.03-1388,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2131.457,2133.936,The majority of them do.
2004.03-1388,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2133.936,2138.887,And how much of its advertising budget is pitched at U.S. customers?
2004.03-1388,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2138.887,2148.425,"Justice Ginsburg, there... all of those questions are going to be answered as a predominant marketing effort, et cetera is directed to the U.S. market."
2004.03-1388,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2148.425,2149.373,"Well, this is the anomaly."
2004.03-1388,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2173.15,2181.035,"And the reason, Justice Ginsburg, is that that law imposes structural changes on vessels that go to other ports."
2004.03-1388,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2181.035,2183.447,Why don't you... why don't you try to draw that line?
2004.03-1388,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2216.224,2217.588,We are talking--
2004.03-1388,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2217.588,2219.65,You're not willing to take such a limited position.
2004.03-1388,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2219.65,2229.681,"--Well, Justice Scalia, I think the Court could certainly carve out in its clear... articulation of the clear statement principle some of these lines."
2004.03-1388,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2230.796,2236.163,"--Well, the ADA itself makes an exception for things that aren't readily achievable."
2004.03-1388,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2243.239,2248.879,"--Justice O'Connor, Congress, when it talked about readily achievable, did so in terms of cost."
2004.03-1388,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2253.17,2257.628,"Well, is there... is there... I mean, you're giving me the answer I thought the other side would give me."
2004.03-1388,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2305.228,2305.649,--That's--
2004.03-1388,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2305.649,2306.797,"Now, what's the response to that?"
2004.03-1388,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2306.797,2307.89,"--Well, that's completely false."
2004.03-1388,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2345.89,2350.448,--Why... why can't you just fight that battle by battle on what's reasonably achievable?
2004.03-1388,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2360.296,2361.205,As a matter of fact--
2004.03-1388,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2361.205,2362.032,--because they're a nuisance.
2004.03-1388,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2363.639,2369.666,"--Justice Kennedy, as a matter of fact, we categorically deny the claims of discrimination here."
2004.03-1388,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2376.354,2380.236,But it doesn't matter what you want to do as a matter of good will.
2004.03-1388,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2390.1,2406.342,"--Justice Ginsburg, what the other side wants is a case by case method of decision making in which a district judge becomes the special master of the cruise industry so that each claim of discrimination that would require some modification to the ship--"
2004.03-1388,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2406.342,2410.45,That happens to every employer under... in the United States under the reasonably achievable standard.
2004.03-1388,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2410.45,2413.877,"--And that's why, Justice Kennedy, it's a question of congressional intent."
2004.03-1388,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2433.901,2434.81,"Mr. Frederick, that brings up a question I've been meaning to ask you."
2004.03-1388,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2444.265,2444.841,Zero.
2004.03-1388,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2447.07,2447.253,All right.
2004.03-1388,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2466.844,2470.27,--Because it was encroaching on an area of foreign sovereignty.
2004.03-1388,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2473.326,2478.072,"Does... does Britain... or does Britain or does the European Union, for example, forbid you to charge this double price?"
2004.03-1388,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2478.072,2479.558,I don't--
2004.03-1388,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2479.558,2483.523,"Does European law... I'd be surprised if it doesn't forbid it, but do you know?"
2004.03-1388,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2483.523,2494.092,"--I... I don't know the answer to European law on charging of an additional price, but I would point out that pricing, like evacuation procedures, do go to the structure of the vessel."
2004.03-1388,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2506.519,2507.3,Mr.... may I ask this question to you?
2004.03-1388,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2511.015,2514.238,"Well, the Fifth Circuit reserved that question."
2004.03-1388,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2514.238,2514.897,What is your view?
2004.03-1388,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2514.897,2519.622,Our view is that there are arguments that can be made that it does not because Congress didn't--
2004.03-1388,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2520.925,2519.622,What is your view?
2004.03-1388,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2521.751,2522.494,"--Well, I think--"
2004.03-1388,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2524.063,2524.806,It does not apply.
2004.03-1388,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2524.806,2526.952,It does not apply because Congress didn't express the intent.
2004.03-1388,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2526.952,2529.431,"So really, we're not concerned with the fact this is a foreign flagged ship."
2004.03-1388,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2531.494,2549.864,"The... there's a difference and... and there are about 1,000 U.S. flagged ships that carry passengers, so that if Congress had given any thought to the question, it is reasonable to suppose it might have distinguished between U.S. ships for which U.S. law directly governs and foreign ships that are governed by a different law."
2004.03-1388,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2550.336,2553.125,Do we need... do we need a clear statement for United States ships?
2004.03-1388,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2558.865,2560.101,"--No, no, Justice Scalia."
2004.03-1388,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2560.101,2563.156,So why... why isn't there a clear difference between the two?
2004.03-1388,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2563.156,2567.054,Because there aren't any words in the statute that go to ships.
2004.03-1388,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2575.333,2576.698,"Well, that's pretty good."
2004.03-1388,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2576.698,2577.562,"Well, it's not--"
2004.03-1388,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2578.305,2586.44,"If you don't require a clear statement, that's... that's good enough, it seems to me."
2004.03-1388,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2586.44,2586.679,Well--
2004.03-1388,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2586.679,2598.279,"Your... your case hangs on the fact that, you know, when Congress wants to... to rule the world and say all ships in the... in the world that touch at our ports have to have this kind of a thing, it says so clearly."
2004.03-1388,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2602.904,2613.966,"--With respect to foreign ships, there is a clear statement rule and that clear statement rule is embodied in the fact that a foreign ship is governed by the law of the flag state where it is registered."
2004.03-1388,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2617.515,2622.966,"Well, is that limited, though, just to things that affect the internal order of the ship?"
2004.03-1388,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2626.226,2629.775,"--Well, it's been articulated in several different contexts."
2004.03-1388,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2672.294,2687.898,"But... but in that case, there was... as I understand it, there was no legal relationship of any sort between the supplier of the patent infringing object and the ship in the United States."
2004.03-1388,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2712.668,2720.22,"Well, Justice Souter, you have a foreign ship owned by a foreign corporation built in a foreign country under foreign engineering standards--"
2004.03-1388,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2720.22,2721.889,With its principal place of business in the United States.
2004.03-1388,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2721.889,2724.761,--For a time before that ship moves into another market.
2004.03-1388,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2724.761,2736.073,Its significant external... its significant commercial relationships are in the United States with people in the United States performed partially in the United States.
2004.03-1388,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2736.073,2747.014,In just the same way that McCulloch the Court said that labor standards for a course of business that is regular between Honduras and the United States is not going to be sufficient to apply--
2004.03-1388,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2747.014,2748.993,The crew members were Honduran in that case.
2004.03-1388,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2748.993,2749.281,--They were.
2004.03-1388,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2749.281,2754.937,"This... if you just look at it, suppose you were not a lawyer and you look at this operation."
2004.03-1388,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2790.231,2798.654,"But a choice of law clause, Justice Ginsburg, has never been held to incorporate law in the sense that laws that don't apply are going to be incorporated."
2004.03-1388,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2804.31,2811.247,Just... it's just one other indicia that one looks at this operation and says this belongs to the U.S.A..
2004.03-1388,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2818.1,2833.35,"And... and you would have... under their theory, you would have the Consumer Products Safety Act, the Food and Drug Act, OSHA, all sorts of other statutes of general application that are now going to be imposed on foreign vessels simply because they do a lot of business in the United States."
2004.03-1388,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2840.597,2851.993,"Well, we... we do... we do have the rule if it... if it applies to the internal operations of the ship, and so far as the crew is concerned, the Jones Act and OSHA, it seems to me, may well be governed by the law of the flag."
2004.03-1388,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2851.993,2865.943,"--And the internal operations of the ship, Justice Kennedy, is part and parcel of how it is designed, what are the evacuation points, how are the cabins laid out, what ramps are placed where, how... everything about the ship's design--"

2004.03-1388,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2871.905,2878.742,"--It doesn't... Justice Kennedy, the problem with that theory is it just doesn't comport with the language of... of the statute."
2004.03-1388,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2939.012,2943.653,Could you go back to Justice Breyer's question about the number of foreign ships?
2004.03-1388,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2955.237,2955.558,Yes.
2004.03-1388,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2986.733,2991.896,"But doesn't it... on the other... on the other side of the coin, apart from the structural problem... and I understand the arguments on both sides there."
2004.03-1388,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,3004.732,3009.562,"--As a matter of fact, Justice Stevens, we give evacuation drills to the disabled in a different way."
2004.03-1388,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3024.711,3026.28,"Thank you, Mr. Frederick."
2004.03-1388,3,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3031.581,3035.402,"Thank you, Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court:"
2004.03-1388,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3049.853,3055.547,Do you agree with Mr. Frederick's answer about title II of the Civil Rights Act of 1964?
2004.03-1388,3,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3059.179,3068.55,"Justice Ginsburg, first let me make clear that the Bahamian Government does and all of its cruise vessels are governed by that prohibition."
2004.03-1388,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3068.55,3069.21,I'm asking about the application of U.S. law.
2004.03-1388,3,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3069.21,3084.609,"We think that that question can be resolved along the lines that Justice Scalia suggested, which is that when you're dealing with a matter that goes to the internal affairs of the ship... and there... we would suggest that there is more central to the internal affairs of the ship than its construction and design."
2004.03-1388,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3111.791,3118.395,"So before you go on to that, I want to be clear on your answer to title II of the Civil Rights Act of '64."
2004.03-1388,3,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3126.651,3126.817,No.
2004.03-1388,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3153.955,3155.88,What about the... what about the full sweep argument?
2004.03-1388,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3165.455,3167.107,What's... what's the full sweep argument?
2004.03-1388,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3167.478,3168.593,--Full sweep of the commerce power.
2004.03-1388,3,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3168.593,3172.021,"--Justice Souter, first of all, it's... it... the statute doesn't say full sweep."
2004.03-1388,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3254.431,3256.932,"--When you say different, you mean you cannot comply with both."
2004.03-1388,3,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3256.932,3257.47,Well--
2004.03-1388,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3257.47,3258.046,Is that what you mean?
2004.03-1388,3,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3263.247,3266.303,"--Justice Scalia, I think in some you could and in others you couldn't."
2004.03-1388,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3268.699,3274.271,And incidentally just for the... are... this ship has... these are regulations that help the disabled?
2004.03-1388,3,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3274.271,3276.129,"Yes, Your... yes, Your Honor."
2004.03-1388,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3284.468,3284.718,Could they work that out?
2004.03-1388,3,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3317.04,3318.898,"We don't think so, Justice Breyer."
2004.03-1388,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3318.898,3319.302,Because?
2004.03-1388,3,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3319.302,3333.387,"We would take the same approach that this Court emphasized in... in the McCulloch case, which is that kind of ad hoc balancing analysis would wreak havoc for the question whether a significant regulation like the ADA would apply to a vessel."
2004.03-1388,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3339.247,3340.074,"The answer would be yes, you do."
2004.03-1388,3,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3348.619,3356.792,"--Justice Breyer, the way that those issues are worked out in the international shipping context is through the International Maritime Organization."
2004.03-1388,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3382.51,3392.624,"That's perfect because then the Government says that once it becomes a matter of binding international rule, anything that conflicts with that will be viewed as not reasonably achievable."
2004.03-1388,3,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3398.197,3406.453,"--Well, we don't think the readily achievable language in the first case in any way contemplates conflicts with international law."
2004.03-1388,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3590.151,3591.387,"Thank you, Mr. Garre."
2004.03-1388,4,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3594.442,3602.532,"Justice Breyer and Justice Ginsburg, our position is the one that can accommodate your concerns."
2004.03-1388,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3637.249,3639.478,"Thank you, Mr. Goldstein."
