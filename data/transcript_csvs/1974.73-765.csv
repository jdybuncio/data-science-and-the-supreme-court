1974.73-765,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,34.595,"We'll hear arguments next in 73-765, International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union against the Quality Manufacturing Company."
1974.73-765,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,36.001,39.207,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1974.73-765,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,101.989,108.322,"And all of these Mr. Dunau against the background of the collective bargaining agreement to the silent of the subject, right?"
1974.73-765,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,108.322,109.57,That is correct sir.
1974.73-765,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,140.127,142.601,Their claim is that the law -- the statute requires --
1974.73-765,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,142.601,145.998,Our claim is that the statute confers the right.
1974.73-765,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,147.064,150.318,When there is a collective bargaining agreement?
1974.73-765,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,150.318,150.635,"No, our position is --"
1974.73-765,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,150.635,153.163,"Now, when there is a bargaining representative?"
1974.73-765,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,153.163,164.863,"Well, no it wouldn't even go beyond that because our view would be that concerted activity for a mutual aid or protection would exist even they -- though there were no union in the picture."
1974.73-765,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,199.806,208.522,"But how can you do what in the absence of a collective bargaining agreement in the absence of bargaining representative the employment would be an employment at will, wouldn't it?"
1974.73-765,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,208.522,223.945,But it is not an employment at will in the sense that when an employee is exercising a statutory right that that employee may be fired for exercising that right and that statutory right concerted activity for mutual aid or protection.
1974.73-765,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,232.681,234.364,You litigate that where.
1974.73-765,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,234.364,235.443,I beg your pardon sir?
1974.73-765,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,235.443,236.608,Where would you litigate that?
1974.73-765,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,236.608,237.921,Before the Board.
1974.73-765,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,237.921,238.814,Before the Board?
1974.73-765,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,238.814,242.42,"Yes, sir."
1974.73-765,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,248.828,254.947,Does that fellow employee had -- does the employer have to pay the fellow employee for the afternoon he takes off?
1974.73-765,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,254.947,256.338,No sir.
1974.73-765,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,267.404,274.611,But it's at the option of the fellow employee to decide whether or not he takes off or not?
1974.73-765,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,279.805,281.497,"No, that may not be at his option."
1974.73-765,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,709.473,710.663,That issue is not here?
1974.73-765,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,710.663,712.022,That issue is not here Your Honor.
1974.73-765,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,808.548,809.828,May you just to help me a little bit.
1974.73-765,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,809.828,811.648,"Yes, sir."
1974.73-765,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,811.648,820.329,"It all sounds to me like where there's reasonable belief as in this brings as right back under subjective criteria measurement, doesn't it."
1974.73-765,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,820.329,834.808,"No sir, I don't believe it does unless we are to say every time we have a standard which says, “We will determine what has done by reference to what a reasonable man in the circumstances would do if that is subjective then it is subjective."
1974.73-765,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,914.883,928.611,"In this case Mr. Dunau, there have been reasonable belief as a matter of discharge when she didn't done anything that under the collective bargaining agreement permitted discharge, isn't that she?"
1974.73-765,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,928.611,930.142,Had she done anything?
1974.73-765,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,930.629,947.694,That under the collective bargaining agreement would warrant discharge all that she have done is along with her four other people in the morning and protested that the existing piecework wage rate hardly allows him to make a living.
1974.73-765,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,947.694,957.388,"The basis for a reasonable belief sir, I think that the illustrated like what Mrs. Gerlach testified too at the hearing at page 79."
1974.73-765,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,957.388,958.314,Of what?
1974.73-765,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,958.314,962.071,"Of the single appendix, Your Honor."
1974.73-765,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,968.0,968.534,79?
1974.73-765,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,968.534,972.68,Page 79 sir.
1974.73-765,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1011.536,1017.744,"Well, could that -- under the collective bargaining agreement could he has been discharged or suspended for being sassy?"
1974.73-765,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,1017.744,1022.554,That would depend upon what an arbitrator would be determined when the case was presented to --
1974.73-765,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1022.554,1026.676,What did the agreement provide the suspension or discharge?
1974.73-765,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,1026.676,1031.638,That there shall be no suspension or discharge without just cause.
1974.73-765,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1046.253,1048.398,"Well, what Junior's answer might have been there?"
1974.73-765,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,1048.398,1050.927,"Or what Junior's answer might have been, yes."
1974.73-765,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1064.951,1073.742,"Mr. Dunau, would you go so far as to impose on the employer duty to inform the employee of her right to representation?"
1974.73-765,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,1073.742,1076.638,"No sir, we do not take that position."
1974.73-765,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1086.822,1092.198,Is this a matter often covered in collective bargaining agreements supposed to be?
1974.73-765,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,1092.198,1094.482,It is covered in collective bargaining agreements.
1974.73-765,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1109.701,1117.803,Is this -- do you agree that the origin is not in the duty to bargain or is it in the right to collective action?
1974.73-765,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,1117.803,1124.117,The origin of the duty as it exist and found in this case is Section 7 and not Section 8 (a) (5).
1974.73-765,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1124.117,1127.396,Do you agree with that?
1974.73-765,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,1127.396,1129.995,"If I had my druthers it would be both, Your Honor."
1974.73-765,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1137.315,1137.943,"Well, yes."
1974.73-765,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,1143.959,1160.824,"If it were an 8(a)(5) then there would be no right in the employee because there'd be no bargaining representative since I placed it or the Board places it in Section 7, the bargaining representative's presence is a matter of indifference because an employee when she seeks the help of her fellow employees to engage in concerted activity."
1974.73-765,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1160.824,1170.295,I understand that she could request somebody else besides if there is a bargaining agent could request somebody else beside the bargaining agent to go with her.
1974.73-765,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,1170.295,1172.628,That depends on the reading of proviso.
1974.73-765,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1177.439,1180.521,"Well, what is the --"
1974.73-765,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,1180.521,1181.176,The proviso of Section 9 (a) --
1974.73-765,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1181.176,1196.104,"Maybe if we can wait some, we might wait some -- if we happen to agree with you in this case we might get another one then as to what's the employer suppose to do when the union wants to be there but the employee wants somebody else?"
1974.73-765,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1196.104,1199.308,Or a private lawyer?
1974.73-765,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,1199.308,1207.115,If there is a bargaining representative and that happens we're going to have I'm afraid one grand hassle as to what the proviso to Section 9 (a) means.
1974.73-765,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1207.115,1215.122,"Well, I take it I think that also means maybe something that isn't in the bargaining agreement?"
1974.73-765,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,1215.122,1217.713,"Well, if it's settled in the bargaining -- well, that's --"
1974.73-765,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1217.713,1218.921,We might try this on other case.
1974.73-765,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,1218.921,1226.241,We may try to settle in the bargaining agreement but if there's a statutory right in the employee under the proviso it doesn't matter what we put in the agreement.
1974.73-765,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1229.315,1232.659,In Section 7 and gives the right that you were asserting?
1974.73-765,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,1232.659,1234.987,"Section 7 gives the right we are asserting, yes Your Honor."
1974.73-765,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1234.987,1239.509,"And nothing in the collective bargaining agreement could supersede it, could it?"
1974.73-765,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,1257.98,1270.74,"That's the language we're relying on but I would have to say in candor, if there were a bargaining representative and a collective bargaining agreement I think we would be required to mesh that general language of what the meaning of the proviso is and I'm not sure that that is very easy question."
1974.73-765,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1270.74,1277.182,Right after the grievance is filed?
1974.73-765,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,1277.182,1289.39,"After a grievance is filed as I recall the law generally in this area, the Board says and the courts have agreed, “You cannot have a rival union present the grievance.”"
1974.73-765,1,31204,john_e_jenkins_jr,,1902.034,1906.531,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1974.73-765,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2016.579,2022.667,What about the language through representatives?
1974.73-765,1,31204,john_e_jenkins_jr,,2022.667,2030.279,To engage in concerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid or protection through representatives.
1974.73-765,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2094.71,2101.445,I take it if you're going to look at the statutory language it's maybe rather important to look at it a little more carefully.
1974.73-765,1,31204,john_e_jenkins_jr,,2107.053,2107.358,That's right.
1974.73-765,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2107.358,2115.905,"The right to bargain collectively through representatives of their own choosing, as I understand it, that's not involved here."
1974.73-765,1,31204,john_e_jenkins_jr,,2115.905,2116.689,"That's correct Your Honor, it does not."
1974.73-765,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2116.689,2129.267,What is involved here is the phrase or the clause and to engage in other concerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid or protection.
1974.73-765,1,31204,john_e_jenkins_jr,,2129.267,2130.231,"Yes, Your Honor."
1974.73-765,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2130.231,2130.984,That's the clause?
1974.73-765,1,31204,john_e_jenkins_jr,,2130.984,2144.74,"Yes sir, that is the clause which we all agree that if there is a statutory right to the employee to have a representative it flows from that specific language and the specific phrase."
1974.73-765,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2146.179,2153.514,"Which is engaged in others concerted activities for other mutual aid or protection, is that it?"
1974.73-765,1,31204,john_e_jenkins_jr,,2153.514,2155.23,"Yes Your Honor, that's right."
1974.73-765,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2310.458,2316.338,As long as you concede entitle to have somebody with his own choosing in under what condition?
1974.73-765,1,31204,john_e_jenkins_jr,,2316.338,2332.433,Under when the investigation or the purpose of the conference was to pass judgment on him when it was disciplinary in nature what he was being brought in to say you are suspended for two days.
1974.73-765,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2337.897,2339.754,As contrasted with an investigative (Voice Overlap)?
1974.73-765,1,31204,john_e_jenkins_jr,,2339.754,2340.86,"Yes, Your Honor."
1974.73-765,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2345.937,2349.204,"Well, what was this interview for?"
1974.73-765,1,31204,john_e_jenkins_jr,,2349.204,2351.236,We don't know Your Honor.
1974.73-765,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2353.092,2360.356,What is this interview to find out why you say it's not -- wasn't that raise before?
1974.73-765,1,31204,john_e_jenkins_jr,,2360.356,2366.239,"This is what Mrs. -- let me say this Your Honor first and the reason I say, we don't know for sure."
