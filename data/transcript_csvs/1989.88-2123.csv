1989.88-2123,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,11.808,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Number 88-2123, the Department of the Treasury, Internal Revenue Service v. Federal Labor Relations Authority."
1989.88-2123,0,21559,david_l_shapiro,,13.441,17.103,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.88-2123,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,142.379,142.867,Excuse me.
1989.88-2123,0,21559,david_l_shapiro,,161.451,172.118,"--Well, the core of our argument, Your Honor, is that Circular A-76 is not an applicable law within the meaning of the management rights provision."
1989.88-2123,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,196.844,200.117,xxx to be the principal part of your argument.
1989.88-2123,0,21559,david_l_shapiro,,200.117,203.527,"--No, it's really... I believe it's a subsidiary part."
1989.88-2123,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,213.096,229.556,"Well, Mr. Shapiro, I guess you come close to conceding that the Circular is a governmentwide rule or regulation for purpose of Section 7117."
1989.88-2123,0,21559,david_l_shapiro,,229.556,239.844,"Yes, we do, Your Honor, although we think that question need be reached only if the Court determines that it is an applicable law under 7106."
1989.88-2123,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,255.315,265.633,"Well, it strikes one as a little odd that Congress intended a different meaning for purposes of 7103 than it did in 7117."
1989.88-2123,0,21559,david_l_shapiro,,265.633,272.187,"There are three relevant provisions of this statute, Your Honor."
1989.88-2123,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,376.754,383.529,"Well, Mr. Shapiro, where does the Treasury authority... get the authority to contract out to begin with?"
1989.88-2123,0,21559,david_l_shapiro,,386.091,399.23,"No, I think it is... I think it is inherent in the agency's appropriations that certain kinds of functions may be performed either in-house or by contracting out."
1989.88-2123,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,433.287,442.973,"Well then, how can negotiating over what is in the Circular affect the authority of the agency, if the authority doesn't get... if the authority doesn't derive from the Circular?"
1989.88-2123,0,21559,david_l_shapiro,,442.973,448.559,I think the authority of the agency exists even if there were no Circular.
1989.88-2123,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,553.591,586.863,"Mr. Shapiro, while you are pausing for liquid refreshment, why... why doesn't the government rely on Section (a)(1) of 7117, which simply says that the duty to bargain in good faith doesn't extend to matters which are the subject of a rule or regulation, if the rule or regulation is a governmentwide rule or regulation, which this is?"
1989.88-2123,0,21559,david_l_shapiro,,586.863,591.635,"Your Honor, we do rely on that provision, but--"
1989.88-2123,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,591.635,593.077,Very subtly.
1989.88-2123,0,21559,david_l_shapiro,,593.077,597.239,"--Well no, quite explicitly in our brief on page 38."
1989.88-2123,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,643.174,650.019,"Well, that argument would mean it's in the arbitration provision automatically, but you don't have to bargain to put it in here [inaudible]."
1989.88-2123,0,21559,david_l_shapiro,,650.019,652.841,"That's right, and indeed that is their argument."
1989.88-2123,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,880.104,885.89,xxx subsection (b) of the management rights provision being--
1989.88-2123,0,21559,david_l_shapiro,,885.89,891.654,"--Subsection (b), 7106 (b)."
1989.88-2123,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,900.797,901.808,--Okay.
1989.88-2123,0,21559,david_l_shapiro,,901.808,902.569,--is not applicable here.
1989.88-2123,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,902.569,903.09,"Right, right, right."
1989.88-2123,0,21559,david_l_shapiro,,903.09,909.174,"Subsection (2) deals with procedures, and it has never been contended that that is what's involved here."
1989.88-2123,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1076.131,1082.426,"Mr. Shapiro, does the government concede that applicable laws can include regulations?"
1989.88-2123,0,21559,david_l_shapiro,,1088.921,1095.095,"No, we do... we do concede that, Your Honor, that regulations having the force of law would be applicable laws."
1989.88-2123,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1135.154,1138.767,"May I ask a question before you sit down, Mr. Shapiro?"
1989.88-2123,0,21559,david_l_shapiro,,1154.999,1158.242,"Specifically, Your Honor--"
1989.88-2123,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1158.242,1162.004,Does the legislative history give us any indications about that?
1989.88-2123,0,21559,david_l_shapiro,,1162.004,1174.522,"--Specifically, Your Honor, I am not aware that a particular statement that says that the management rights provision itself limits the scope of what is grievable or subject to arbitration."
1989.88-2123,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1234.648,1237.379,"Thank you, Mr. Shapiro."
1989.88-2123,1,39177,robert_j_englehart,,1238.29,1246.496,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.88-2123,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1279.269,1280.12,Under what provision?
1989.88-2123,1,39177,robert_j_englehart,,1280.12,1293.288,"Under the provision of 7103(a)(9)(C)(ii), the definition of grievance, any claimed violation, misinterpretation or misapplication of law, rule or regulation."
1989.88-2123,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1316.575,1325.11,"Well, what would be your... what would be your position if there weren't any Circular, and the agency went ahead and contracted out?"
1989.88-2123,1,39177,robert_j_englehart,,1325.11,1332.304,"--Then there would be no binding limits on management's discretion, and that's an important feature of the Authority's position in this case."
1989.88-2123,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1332.304,1341.821,And then any proposals to bargain over any aspect of contracting out wouldn't be negotiable?
1989.88-2123,1,39177,robert_j_englehart,,1341.821,1348.976,"Proposals that could quality for the special bargaining status under 7106(b)(2) and (b)(3), yes."
1989.88-2123,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1359.475,1369.412,And so the... so you... the issuance of the regulation really then makes bargainable something that wouldn't have been bargainable before?
1989.88-2123,1,39177,robert_j_englehart,,1369.412,1371.553,--It makes grievable something that wouldn't other--
1989.88-2123,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1371.553,1372.812,"I mean grievable, yes."
1989.88-2123,1,39177,robert_j_englehart,,1372.812,1374.284,--Grievable; And this provision--
1989.88-2123,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1374.284,1376.977,"Well, and then hence bargainable."
1989.88-2123,1,39177,robert_j_englehart,,1376.977,1381.01,"--To the extent of stipulating the scope of the grievance procedure, yes."
1989.88-2123,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1387.624,1405.907,"Mr. Englehart, what's your answer to the Solicitor General's argument that when the Section 7106(a) defines management rights it says nothing in this chapter shall detract from it, and that the definition of grievance is in this chapter?"
1989.88-2123,1,39177,robert_j_englehart,,1405.907,1412.762,"Yes, the Authority does not see a conflict between the command of Section 7106 and the grievance procedure."
1989.88-2123,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1441.173,1443.475,"But it doesn't say law, rule or regulation."
1989.88-2123,1,39177,robert_j_englehart,,1462.087,1469.911,"Justice Scalia, we read applicable laws in 7106 as we would Section... Subsection (b)(2) and (b)(3)."
1989.88-2123,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1483.82,1507.505,"But surely... you keep saying law, rule or regulation, but surely the statute means something, when in some sections it very explicitly says laws, rules and regulations, as it does in... in 7103(a)(9)(C)(ii), for example, another one of the important provisions here, and a second one of the important provisions here, 7117, does."
1989.88-2123,1,39177,robert_j_englehart,,1515.702,1524.73,"Well, we note that IRS does not contend that laws is limited to congressional enactments, that it includes laws, rules and regulations."
1989.88-2123,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1569.352,1574.016,"In the absence of legislative history laws means the same thing as laws, rules or regulations."
1989.88-2123,1,39177,robert_j_englehart,,1575.538,1580.312,"IRS does not dispute the fact that applicable laws includes laws, rules and regulations."
1989.88-2123,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1580.312,1581.304,Includes some regulations.
1989.88-2123,1,39177,robert_j_englehart,,1582.834,1585.358,"I understand, Your Honor."
1989.88-2123,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1663.271,1674.308,"Yes, but the... it is contended by the government that this Circular just isn't a law, rule or regulation, never was intended to be."
1989.88-2123,1,39177,robert_j_englehart,,1674.308,1686.926,"The government, as I understand their position in the reply, is that there is an interest in having it not be an applicable law, even if it is a law, rule or regulation affecting conditions of employment."
1989.88-2123,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1686.926,1691.959,"Well, however you put it, that's its characterization of its own Circular."
1989.88-2123,1,39177,robert_j_englehart,,1691.959,1706.869,"The OMB is the issuing agency, and the OMB, we submitted in our brief on pages 34 to 45, an examination will reveal that OMB does consider the Circular a regulation--"
1989.88-2123,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1706.869,1712.165,You concede that OMB had the authority to issue this Circular?
1989.88-2123,1,39177,robert_j_englehart,,1712.165,1712.636,"--Yes, we do."
1989.88-2123,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1715.407,1723.654,"And is the... and you understand the government to concede that the agencies must, must follow the Circular?"
1989.88-2123,1,39177,robert_j_englehart,,1723.654,1726.976,--I don't know that there is a dispute over that.
1989.88-2123,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1742.618,1753.985,"You must... you must be arguing that there is something inconsistent between the Circular and the law, and the statutes on which you rely."
1989.88-2123,1,39177,robert_j_englehart,,1753.985,1758.069,--I am not sure I understand Your Honor's question.
1989.88-2123,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1758.069,1765.755,"Well, the Circular says there is only one way to review these actions of the agency under the Circular."
1989.88-2123,1,39177,robert_j_englehart,,1765.755,1766.154,Right.
1989.88-2123,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1766.154,1769.385,And you say that that Circular cannot be--
1989.88-2123,1,39177,robert_j_englehart,,1769.385,1770.627,It is our position--
1989.88-2123,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1770.627,1771.017,--to that extent.
1989.88-2123,1,39177,robert_j_englehart,,1771.017,1776.693,--It is our position that that aspect of the Circular can't override Congress' command in the statute.
1989.88-2123,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1776.693,1785.218,"But that... that Circular, with that provision in it, amounts to an OMB construction of its own authority and of the statute's, I guess."
1989.88-2123,1,39177,robert_j_englehart,,1785.218,1793.764,"We would argue that, for purposes of whether it is a law, rule or regulation under our statute, one looks at the overall effect of the regulation."
1989.88-2123,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1797.467,1801.19,"You are really just picking and choosing what you want out of the Circular, aren't you?"
1989.88-2123,1,39177,robert_j_englehart,,1801.19,1808.275,"--Well, the grievance procedure is not an aspect that management uses in exercising its determination to contract out."
1989.88-2123,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1946.728,1969.002,"Mr. Englehart, could... I assume that the position the Authority takes with regard to (2)(B) it also has to take with respect... with respect to (2)(D) of Section 7106(a)."
1989.88-2123,1,39177,robert_j_englehart,,2002.474,2003.985,Your Honor--
1989.88-2123,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2003.985,2005.587,Would be grievable.
1989.88-2123,1,39177,robert_j_englehart,,2005.587,2012.861,--Each case would turn upon analysis of whether the regulation involved was one that affected conditions of employment.
1989.88-2123,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2026.951,2035.389,"But if it involved conditions of employment, even emergency actions taken by agencies would be subject to the grievance procedure."
1989.88-2123,1,39177,robert_j_englehart,,2035.389,2038.962,"Involved, Your Honor, I submit based upon Authority analysis, wouldn't be enough."
1989.88-2123,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2044.245,2044.826,Direct effect--
1989.88-2123,1,39177,robert_j_englehart,,2044.826,2046.027,--and intended--
1989.88-2123,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2046.027,2046.348,--Whatever you want.
1989.88-2123,1,39177,robert_j_englehart,,2048.741,2057.257,"--And an intent to affect conditions of employment, that is an aspect of why the regulation was initiated."
1989.88-2123,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2096.371,2102.437,What is at issue here is whether or not the agency must bargain over the proposal you submitted.
1989.88-2123,1,39177,robert_j_englehart,,2102.437,2103.549,That is correct.
1989.88-2123,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2103.549,2105.011,It isn't a question of a grievance.
1989.88-2123,1,39177,robert_j_englehart,,2105.011,2106.183,"Well, the proposal--"
1989.88-2123,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2106.183,2119.202,"Well, it isn't... there is nothing... you, you want to bargain so that you will have included in the collective bargaining agreement the procedure for contracting out."
1989.88-2123,1,39177,robert_j_englehart,,2121.773,2130.248,"--Your Honor, the proposal merely specifies the scope of the grievance procedure with respect to the contracting-out determination."
1989.88-2123,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2136.205,2150.063,"What is the provision you rely on, then, to say that this issue is bargainable, is negotiable, that this proposal must be, must be acceded to by the agency?"
1989.88-2123,1,39177,robert_j_englehart,,2150.814,2153.147,--Not must be acceded but must be on the bargaining table.
1989.88-2123,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2166.194,2172.068,--So you don't rely on... you don't rely at all on 7106(2)... (b)(2)?
1989.88-2123,1,39177,robert_j_englehart,,2172.068,2179.113,"--Your Honor, we believe that Congress intended the grievance procedure to exist even if there weren't a (b)(2)."
1989.88-2123,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2193.294,2196.807,"Well, you don't really need the contracted, the contractual provision at all."
1989.88-2123,1,39177,robert_j_englehart,,2206.273,2211.037,"That shouldn't be the hardest part of this case, though, I submit, in that it--"
1989.88-2123,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2211.037,2213.289,"Well, it's the easiest part of the case to see that it is hard."
1989.88-2123,1,39177,robert_j_englehart,,2219.473,2232.012,"--If the grievance procedure were undefined except to entertain the statutory command of law, rule and regulation violations affecting conditions of employment, the Authority's position is that would bring this within the scope."
1989.88-2123,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2240.078,2252.126,It seems to me if you are right that all you have to... the management is subject to bargaining to establish a grievance procedure about any exercise of its management rights.
1989.88-2123,1,39177,robert_j_englehart,,2252.126,2254.69,--Not about any exercise of its management rights.
1989.88-2123,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2268.394,2274.999,"So you have to rely... to win, you have to rely on the Circular?"
1989.88-2123,1,39177,robert_j_englehart,,2274.999,2279.032,--To win we rely on two points.
1989.88-2123,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2291.64,2304.049,"But don't you have to persuade us too that 7106(a)(2), in accordance with applicable laws, means laws, rules and regulations?"
1989.88-2123,1,39177,robert_j_englehart,,2304.049,2310.664,"I don't believe we do, Your Honor, because we don't attach the significance to that phrase as defining the scope of the grievance procedure."
1989.88-2123,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2356.678,2358.859,Yet this case isn't about grieving.
1989.88-2123,1,39177,robert_j_englehart,,2360.761,2363.364,Only... it is directly about grievance.
1989.88-2123,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2363.364,2373.09,But I thought the issue... the issue raised... I thought the issue decided by the court of appeals was whether the Treasury can be required to bargain about this.
1989.88-2123,1,39177,robert_j_englehart,,2373.09,2376.873,Bargain about a provision that stipulates the scope of the grievance procedure.
1989.88-2123,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2378.405,2382.847,"You weren't going through some useless procedure, were you, in submitting this proposal?"
1989.88-2123,1,39177,robert_j_englehart,,2394.096,2397.229,--The Federal Labor Relations Authority didn't submit a proposal.
1989.88-2123,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2410.809,2418.384,"Well, I know, but why do you... you don't, I don't suppose the Authority goes around deciding issues that are wholly unnecessary to decide."
1989.88-2123,1,39177,robert_j_englehart,,2418.384,2423.367,The Authority is required to decide any negotiability dispute that is properly presented to it.
1989.88-2123,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2426.99,2430.252,"Well, why would you... why do you think the union presented this proposal?"
1989.88-2123,1,39177,robert_j_englehart,,2430.252,2431.114,My understanding--
1989.88-2123,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2431.114,2437.919,Just for fun or do you think they thought that they had to have it or they couldn't grieve?
1989.88-2123,1,39177,robert_j_englehart,,2437.919,2440.981,"--Your Honor, I don't think that the union thought they had to have it."
1989.88-2123,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2447.098,2447.726,Make sort of make-work--
1989.88-2123,1,39177,robert_j_englehart,,2447.726,2449.168,--they would be ready.
1989.88-2123,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2457.263,2461.175,"--Your time has expired, Mr. Englehart."
1989.88-2123,1,39177,robert_j_englehart,,2461.175,2461.506,--Thank you.
1989.88-2123,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2461.506,2463.597,Mr. O'Duden.
1989.88-2123,2,25857,gregory_oduden,,2463.597,2474.624,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.88-2123,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2474.624,2476.096,What's your answer to my question?
1989.88-2123,2,25857,gregory_oduden,,2476.096,2479.476,--The question why we want the proposal in the contract?
1989.88-2123,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2484.301,2484.922,"Oh, you need it?"
1989.88-2123,2,25857,gregory_oduden,,2491.019,2492.468,"No, we certainly could."
1989.88-2123,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2710.523,2714.667,"--Mr. O'Duden, do we... do we owe any deference to anybody here?"
1989.88-2123,2,25857,gregory_oduden,,2714.667,2716.507,"I would say you do, Your Honor."
1989.88-2123,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2717.388,2717.658,To who?
1989.88-2123,2,25857,gregory_oduden,,2717.658,2718.169,--that the FLRA--
1989.88-2123,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2718.169,2718.81,The FLRA--
1989.88-2123,2,25857,gregory_oduden,,2718.81,2721.1,"--is entitled to great deference here, as Your Honor well knows."
1989.88-2123,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2721.1,2721.741,--Have we said that in any of our cases?
1989.88-2123,2,25857,gregory_oduden,,2721.741,2722.622,"Excuse me, Your Honor?"
1989.88-2123,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2722.622,2724.234,Have we said that in any of our cases?
1989.88-2123,2,25857,gregory_oduden,,2724.234,2727.948,"You have said that in the BATF case, Your Honor."
1989.88-2123,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2789.031,2789.512,So the--
1989.88-2123,2,25857,gregory_oduden,,2789.512,2790.753,--management steps out of line.
1989.88-2123,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2790.753,2800.5,"--So the Circular, in effect, does make grievable, you say, things that might not be grievable in the absence of the Circular?"
1989.88-2123,2,25857,gregory_oduden,,2800.5,2806.424,"It is not the... it is not the Circular that makes anything grievable, Your Honor."
1989.88-2123,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2807.796,2811.429,"Well, I know, but without the Circular, then what would be grievable?"
1989.88-2123,2,25857,gregory_oduden,,2811.429,2822.705,"Oh, I agree that it is necessary for us to have the Circular here in order to pursue a successful grievance, because without the Circular there would be no binding requirements on the agencies."
1989.88-2123,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2824.215,2835.424,It's kind of odd that it's just a mistake by OMB then to think that it had the authority to exclude the grievance procedure under its regulation.
1989.88-2123,2,25857,gregory_oduden,,2838.427,2843.849,--The Circular itself says that it does not apply if it is inconsistent with law.
1989.88-2123,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2846.392,2858.279,So... so its provision that... its provision purporting to establish an exclusive appeals procedure is inconsistent with the statute.
1989.88-2123,2,25857,gregory_oduden,,2858.279,2859.49,--It is inconsistent with the statute.
1989.88-2123,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2861.962,2862.122,"Well, wait."
1989.88-2123,2,25857,gregory_oduden,,2869.235,2869.716,--Well--
1989.88-2123,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2869.716,2870.647,--of these determinations.
1989.88-2123,2,25857,gregory_oduden,,2870.647,2872.638,"--It might, I suppose--"
1989.88-2123,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2872.638,2873.319,"You don't want to give that away, either?"
1989.88-2123,2,25857,gregory_oduden,,2873.319,2874.38,"--No, I don't want to give it away."
1989.88-2123,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2881.356,2888.202,"It's at least conceivable that it would have that effect, even though it doesn't have... it is conceivable that it could have that effect without having the effect of preventing grieving."
1989.88-2123,2,25857,gregory_oduden,,2888.202,2889.664,"It is conceivable, of course."
1989.88-2123,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2905.945,2907.417,"Thank you, Mr. O'Duden."
1989.88-2123,3,21559,david_l_shapiro,,2910.441,2912.112,Yes.
1989.88-2123,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2983.392,2983.973,Precisely how?
1989.88-2123,3,21559,david_l_shapiro,,2993.769,3011.301,"--Your Honor, if we start with the use of the phrase laws, rules or regulations in 7117, Congress indicated there that they regarded the phrase to be broad enough to include governmentwide policy directives."
1989.88-2123,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3148.261,3152.224,"xxx if you just repeal the Circular, just withdrew the Circular."
1989.88-2123,3,21559,david_l_shapiro,,3152.224,3162.82,"Well, but that would be a painful act, Your Honor, because this is a very important directive by the President to the heads of agencies about how procurement policy is to be conducted."
1989.88-2123,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3167.645,3178.562,"Well, is there some... as long as it... it's a directive they have to follow, but you say it's... really shouldn't be considered a rule or regulation."
1989.88-2123,3,21559,david_l_shapiro,,3178.562,3180.682,"--Not an applicable law, Your Honor."
1989.88-2123,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3192.181,3202.969,"What happens if the agency says well, I heard this argument up in court and I know this isn't a... law or regulation, so I just won't obey it."
1989.88-2123,3,21559,david_l_shapiro,,3202.969,3204.041,As I understand--
1989.88-2123,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3204.041,3205.702,What does that President have to do?
1989.88-2123,3,21559,david_l_shapiro,,3207.212,3220.543,"--As I understand it, the only thing the President can do is to exercise the authority that any superior can exercise over subordinate, which is to see to it that the insubordinate person is somehow disciplined for insubordination."
1989.88-2123,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3220.543,3223.645,You mean like the member of an agent... independent agency?
1989.88-2123,3,21559,david_l_shapiro,,3223.645,3228.076,"This applies to executive agencies, as I understand it."
1989.88-2123,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3228.076,3232.059,It doesn't... it doesn't apply to independent agencies?
1989.88-2123,3,21559,david_l_shapiro,,3232.059,3236.553,It applies to agencies that are within the jurisdiction of the executive branch.
1989.88-2123,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3236.553,3240.546,I take it it follows the President could excuse compliance anytime he wishes?
1989.88-2123,3,21559,david_l_shapiro,,3240.546,3247.633,"In the sense, I suppose, that a superior can overlook insubordination by a subordinate, if it chooses."
1989.88-2123,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3247.633,3249.663,"Well, he could give advance approval, I take it--"
1989.88-2123,3,21559,david_l_shapiro,,3249.663,3250.063,Yes.
1989.88-2123,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3250.063,3251.383,--to depart from the Circular?
1989.88-2123,3,21559,david_l_shapiro,,3251.383,3251.803,Yes.
1989.88-2123,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3251.803,3261.56,"Well, the agency itself, as I understand under 75... 7106, could elect to bargain over some of its management rights."
1989.88-2123,3,21559,david_l_shapiro,,3261.56,3267.915,"I don't it could allow... I think bargaining over this is fairly precluded, in our view."
1989.88-2123,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3269.627,3275.969,"Well, Section (b), 7106(b) says at the election of the agency some of the management rights could be--"
1989.88-2123,3,21559,david_l_shapiro,,3275.969,3278.142,"--Yes, but I don't think contracting out is included."
1989.88-2123,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3278.142,3279.011,"--Well,--"
1989.88-2123,3,21559,david_l_shapiro,,3279.011,3287.168,"And in any event, I don't think an agency... that is, if an agency were to choose to bargain over some--"
1989.88-2123,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3287.168,3299.256,"--Well, it says nothing in this section shall preclude any agency and any labor organization from negotiating about procedures which management officials will observe in exercising any authority under this section."
1989.88-2123,3,21559,david_l_shapiro,,3303.918,3312.043,--I don't think that the decision to turn over management authority to a third-party arbitrator would be bargaining over procedure.
1989.88-2123,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3333.761,3336.041,"May I ask... yes, may I just ask one question, Mr. Shapiro?"
1989.88-2123,3,21559,david_l_shapiro,,3361.338,3366.554,--I think it would depend on a close analysis of the circular to determine whether it was an applicable law.
1989.88-2123,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3366.554,3368.604,"And the circular that is in effect, what about the one--"
1989.88-2123,3,21559,david_l_shapiro,,3368.604,3376.011,"Well, what is in effect is the... Federal Personnel Manual, which covers a whole wall on people's bookshelves."
1989.88-2123,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3376.011,3376.308,--Is that an applicable law?
1989.88-2123,3,21559,david_l_shapiro,,3377.28,3381.733,"As a whole, Your Honor, I don't think I could answer that question."
1989.88-2123,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3412.151,3420.188,"Is that the same question, Mr. Shapiro, as whether you, a private party, could bring an APA suit with regard to them?"
1989.88-2123,3,21559,david_l_shapiro,,3420.188,3420.847,--I think--
1989.88-2123,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3420.847,3424.779,"I mean, I would like to have some body of law that, you know, that the lower courts are looking at."
1989.88-2123,3,21559,david_l_shapiro,,3428.452,3428.602,--I think if--
1989.88-2123,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3428.602,3430.364,--of law we can refer to on these questions?
1989.88-2123,3,21559,david_l_shapiro,,3430.364,3440.41,"--I think if a private party could bring an APA action, that that would be very strong, if not conclusive, evidence that the... you are dealing with an applicable law."
1989.88-2123,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3457.745,3459.648,"Thank you, Mr. Shapiro."
