2016.16-405,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,13.19,"We'll hear argument next this morning in Case 16-405, BNSF Railway v. Tyrrell. Mr. Tulumello."
2016.16-405,0,17114,andrew_s_tulumello,,13.19,58.415,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Montana Supreme Court concluded that BNSF is subject to general personal jurisdiction in Montana for two reasons: First, it held that Montana State courts exercise general all-purpose jurisdiction over BNSF because BNSF does systematic and continuous business activity in the State. Second, it held that Section 56 of the Federal Employers' Liability Act confers personal jurisdiction on State courts. Both conclusions were wrong. First, under this Court's decision in Daimler, BNSF is not subject to general personal jurisdiction in Montana because it is not at home in Montana."
2016.16-405,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,66.95,67.995,I'm sorry.
2016.16-405,0,17114,andrew_s_tulumello,,70.98,71.78,It did --
2016.16-405,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,71.78,75.42,"To do business, doesn't it -- isn't it required to register?"
2016.16-405,0,17114,andrew_s_tulumello,,75.42,78.23,It -- it is required and it has registered to --
2016.16-405,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,78.23,78.81,"Now, I thought the --"
2016.16-405,0,17114,andrew_s_tulumello,,78.81,79.6,-- to do business.
2016.16-405,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,79.6,85.55,"-- Court below didn't reach that question, but does the registration in Montana change this discussion?"
2016.16-405,0,17114,andrew_s_tulumello,,85.55,86.975,"It -- it doesn't, Your Honor."
2016.16-405,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,88.04,103.8,"Then if I, as an individual, establish residency in multiple places, I can be sued for all of my activities there, correct? So why can't a corporation?"
2016.16-405,0,17114,andrew_s_tulumello,,103.8,115.3,"Your Honor, so the -- the holding in Daimler was that even doing systematic, continuous, sizable business would not be sufficient to confer general personal jurisdiction."
2016.16-405,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,115.82,129.72,"So if you treat a corporation like a person, which we seem to be doing, why isn't their registration of an agent for purposes of accepting service enough?"
2016.16-405,0,17114,andrew_s_tulumello,,129.72,141.15,"Well, if you treat the corporation as a person, I think what this Court's due process cases say is that you look for where the corporation could be fairly regarded as at home."
2016.16-405,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,165.04,176.72,"Well, there's an argument -- there was an argument in the case we just heard that -- that by registering, you effectively consent to jurisdiction and consent is always a good basis for."
2016.16-405,0,17114,andrew_s_tulumello,,176.72,204.36,"It is -- it -- Your Honor, I -- I think as -- I think with respect to consent, the argument especially in this case that by registering to business -- to do business in Montana law, BNSF consented to any kind of jurisdiction is expressly negated by the text of the Montana statute, which says registering to do business in and of itself does not confer personal jurisdiction in this State."
2016.16-405,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,204.36,210.78,"Of course, the -- the issue, I guess, was not addressed below and is not before us."
2016.16-405,0,17114,andrew_s_tulumello,,210.78,211.22,Correct.
2016.16-405,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,211.22,214.17,I'm looking at footnote 1 in the government's brief.
2016.16-405,0,17114,andrew_s_tulumello,,214.17,222.025,"Your Honor, so I -- I would draw -- I would draw a distinction about how the registration issue can play in this case."
2016.16-405,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,322.4,324.495,It was related somewhat in the last case.
2016.16-405,0,17114,andrew_s_tulumello,,332.92,338.41,"Well, we don't -- we -- well, let me -- I'll take that in parts because the -- one -- one part of it raises a significant --"
2016.16-405,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,338.41,341.06,The thing is I don't know it was that essential for your argument.
2016.16-405,0,17114,andrew_s_tulumello,,342.455,352.9,"I would -- I would -- Justice Kennedy, I would take it in two parts. Congress, we believe, could constitutionally provide for nationwide service-of-process provisions in Federal courts."
2016.16-405,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,474.34,478.43,Are -- are you saying that service-of-process language is an absolute necessity?
2016.16-405,0,17114,andrew_s_tulumello,,478.43,480.21,I don't think it's an absolutely necessity.
2016.16-405,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,492.45,500.39,Aren't there some statutes that look like the first sentence of this statute that have been read as personal jurisdiction requirements?
2016.16-405,0,17114,andrew_s_tulumello,,500.39,537.26,"It -- I -- I -- Respondents cite a couple post-Omni cases that infer service of process provisions from statutes that set up -- you know, agencies, and where the courts have held in those circumstances that unless we infer some kind of subpoena authority, the agency just, you know, won't be able to get out -- get out the door or do its job. But, by and large, as this Court said in Omni -- I mean, this Court has never inferred a service-of-process provision, and the Court in Omni gave, you know, three very good reasons for why that would be a bad idea."
2016.16-405,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,564.69,572.67,One of the amici supporting Respondents says that adopting your position would create chaos in the industry.
2016.16-405,0,17114,andrew_s_tulumello,,574.03,576.84,"I -- I think just the opposite is true, Justice Alito."
2016.16-405,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,611.31,620.445,"Well, what about someone who's working very far -- routinely they work very far from their home, they're injured very far from home, what would your rule do to them?"
2016.16-405,0,17114,andrew_s_tulumello,,620.445,627.465,The -- that -- that individual would have specific jurisdiction in the place where they were injured.
2016.16-405,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,657.04,670.01,"Thank you, counsel. Ms. Saharsky."
2016.16-405,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,670.01,685.36,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: So there are two questions before the Court. The Court said in Omni that in order to assert personal jurisdiction, you have to have a statute or a rule making the defendant amenable to service of process. There's a question of, here, is it Section 56 or Montana law."
2016.16-405,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,805.58,824.455,"The Respondents note what we said in Daimler that, in addition to the State of incorporation and the principal place of business, there may be particular circumstances where another State could be considered their home as well."
2016.16-405,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,837.79,859.465,"Well, the Court described that category very narrowly as a place where the contacts are not just that they are continuous and systematic business contacts, but where they are so significant that you consider the company at home there, that it's like the company's domicile. And the only court -- example that the Court's given of that to this point is the Perkins case where you have the company that actually relocated during the war from the Philippines to Ohio."
2016.16-405,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,861.08,866.94,What does that do in the hypothetical 50/50? Let's say a State has a headquarters in Delaware.
2016.16-405,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,898.97,904.12,"Well, because that would make the railroad at home in so many places for purposes of general jurisdiction."
2016.16-405,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,931.02,931.6,What's the logic of --
2016.16-405,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,931.6,932.45,-- just any type of claim.
2016.16-405,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,932.45,936.16,What's the logic of -- what's the logic of that?
2016.16-405,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,936.16,936.325,It's --
2016.16-405,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,936.325,939.01,What's -- what's -- other than we said it.
2016.16-405,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,939.01,939.59,Sure.
2016.16-405,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,939.59,952.19,It certainly was very different than what International Shoe ever considered. What's -- what's the unfairness? We go back a little bit to the question that -- to the predecessor case.
2016.16-405,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,967.95,976.63,"Well, the difference between being hauled into court for claims that arise out of or are related to the context with the State, as opposed to claims that are just any kind of possible claims."
2016.16-405,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1067.285,1076.185,"Thank you, counsel. Ms. Murray."
2016.16-405,2,62834,julie_a_murray,,1076.185,1088.56,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: For more than a century, injured rail workers have been able to sue their negligent employers in a court of -- in any State where the railroads are doing business."
2016.16-405,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1103.055,1131.625,"Why isn't it that we were told -- and I think it's correct -- that the language that's used in Section 56, the wording, ""Civil action may be brought in,"" is found in some 200-odd venue statutes? So the -- the way this statute is written, it sounds like a venue description, not a personal jurisdiction description."
2016.16-405,2,62834,julie_a_murray,,1131.625,1140.37,"Certainly, Justice Ginsburg, we recognize that the -- the language, you know, ""where suit may be brought"" appears in other statutes and has been interpreted in that way."
2016.16-405,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1162.48,1174.165,"""Concurrent"" usually means that it's not -- it's a Federal claim, but it could be adjudicated in State as well as Federal court. That's what concurrent jurisdiction means."
2016.16-405,2,62834,julie_a_murray,,1174.165,1193.14,"Well, I -- we think, Your Honor, in this context it is ambiguous, given -- if you look at the statute as a package where it has the ""may"" -- ""may be brought"" language, the ""concurrent jurisdiction"" language, and then the very unusual provision that actually prohibits removal of these State -- of these Federal causes of action into Federal court."
2016.16-405,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1241.97,1243.335,Why is -- why is that?
2016.16-405,2,62834,julie_a_murray,,1243.335,1247.825,"Well, I think Congress recognized in 1910 the railroad industry is unique."
2016.16-405,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1285.635,1290.205,Then why didn't it say the action could be brought at plaintiff's residence?
2016.16-405,2,62834,julie_a_murray,,1290.205,1291.9,"Well, it considered that, Your Honor."
2016.16-405,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1350.58,1356.98,"Well, I -- I haven't looked at a route map, but BNSF, I assume, is doing business in a lot of States."
2016.16-405,2,62834,julie_a_murray,,1365.22,1371.37,"That's correct, Your Honor. And we think that that is what Congress intended, and it's -- Congress knew that that was, in fact, happening in 1947 --"
2016.16-405,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1371.37,1374.5,Even though the injury -- even though the injury occurred somewhere else.
2016.16-405,2,62834,julie_a_murray,,1374.5,1375.14,That's correct.
2016.16-405,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1379.06,1394.84,"It's not the unique nature of particular forums? I mean, the -- the discussion in the briefs is that there is a reason that someone, not a resident of Montana, injured in Washington, would want to sue in Montana."
2016.16-405,2,62834,julie_a_murray,,1397.71,1402.68,"Well, I -- I think you can take it into consideration, but I actually think it, in many ways, favors us."
2016.16-405,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1412.77,1415.47,What's -- what's the good reason they would want to sue in Montana?
2016.16-405,2,62834,julie_a_murray,,1415.47,1425.05,"Well, from a litigant's perspective, if you want predictability, you want to know that the court that you're going to knows the specialized area of law like the back of their hand, that is Montana."
2016.16-405,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1430.89,1433.115,That seems -- that seems a little circular.
2016.16-405,2,62834,julie_a_murray,,1433.115,1437.91,"Well, but it is the practical reality, in terms of -- of where people are bringing suits."
2016.16-405,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1528.89,1555.36,"And I could understand why Congress -- I could understand why they might have wanted to allow the injured worker to sue where the -- where the injury occurred, or where the worker resides, or where the company is headquartered, but why they would want to allow a -- a suit in -- in a State that satisfies none of those, really, is hard to understand."
2016.16-405,2,62834,julie_a_murray,,1555.36,1573.21,"Well, Your Honor, I -- I think it is actually easier to understand if you sort of set it in the context of what was going on at that time. The railroads -- there were thousands of these injuries. And I think Congress recognized, you know, these are highly sophisticated interstate transportation companies."
2016.16-405,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1581.68,1582.24,"No, I know."
2016.16-405,2,62834,julie_a_murray,,1606.395,1609.64,"Well, I -- I do think it is the language that Congress chose."
2016.16-405,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1612.3,1627.92,"With respect to that, I mean, we did have -- we say different things in different cases, but I think Kepner -- Kepner typed Section 56, a venue provision, didn't it?"
2016.16-405,2,62834,julie_a_murray,,1627.92,1631.61,Certainly this -- this Court has referred to the provision as a venue provision.
2016.16-405,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1678.775,1681.43,What -- what year is that case?
2016.16-405,2,62834,julie_a_murray,,1681.43,1682.105,I'm sorry?
2016.16-405,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1682.105,1684.33,What year is the Pope case?
2016.16-405,2,62834,julie_a_murray,,1684.33,1685.09,It was 1953.
2016.16-405,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1711.8,1743.135,"Do you have any -- any example of any other statute that does what you claim this one does, that is, that -- that determines State court jurisdiction, that has a provision, which you say is conferred, that alters the personal jurisdiction of the State court from what it would be without the Federal statute?"
2016.16-405,2,62834,julie_a_murray,,1743.135,1748.42,"So the -- as I said, we don't have a statute that we think mirrors FELA."
2016.16-405,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1784.4,1788.08,The -- the Court in Pope didn't mention personal jurisdiction at all.
2016.16-405,2,62834,julie_a_murray,,1788.08,1788.85,"That's right, Your Honor."
2016.16-405,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1790.175,1792.045,And that's your strongest authority?
2016.16-405,2,62834,julie_a_murray,,1792.045,1793.42,"Well, I think it is one."
2016.16-405,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1823.365,1828.1,"The right that -- the right, I think, they're referring to, is the right to proceed in State court, right?"
2016.16-405,2,62834,julie_a_murray,,1828.1,1829.35,"That's correct, yes."
2016.16-405,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1829.35,1829.47,Which --
2016.16-405,2,62834,julie_a_murray,,1829.47,1829.68,That's --
2016.16-405,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1829.68,1842.42,"-- which, of course, you'd expect that to deal with the second sentence, because it talks about the concurrent jurisdiction. There's a difference between, you can proceed in State court and the question of whether there's personal jurisdiction in a particular State court."
2016.16-405,2,62834,julie_a_murray,,1842.42,1854.91,"Well, I -- I take your point, Your Honor, but, I think, we don't typically think of a provision that just says there's concurrent jurisdiction between State and Federal courts and is referring only to subject-matter jurisdiction."
2016.16-405,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1864.0,1864.31,I'm sorry.
2016.16-405,2,62834,julie_a_murray,,1869.625,1870.32,No.
2016.16-405,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1899.62,1908.845,Wasn't there -- wasn't there a decision that suggested that State courts didn't have concurrent -- concurrent jurisdiction and that's why Congress made the change?
2016.16-405,2,62834,julie_a_murray,,1908.845,1910.57,"There was, Your Honor."
2016.16-405,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1933.46,1936.18,"Well, Pope didn't mention personal jurisdiction."
2016.16-405,2,62834,julie_a_murray,,1937.1,1937.73,No.
2016.16-405,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2026.215,2031.98,"Well, is your argument that railroad companies are so unique that they should be subject to general jurisdiction everywhere?"
2016.16-405,2,62834,julie_a_murray,,2031.98,2040.11,"I don't think that that would necessarily have to follow, but I think it is a key ingredient as to why BNSF is at home in the State of Montana."
2016.16-405,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2040.11,2045.32,"But, I mean, at home in the State of Montana and at home in everyplace else that it operates?"
2016.16-405,2,62834,julie_a_murray,,2045.32,2052.93,"I -- Your Honor, I think it would depend on the other States in which it operates and its history in -- in those States, the level of contacts."
2016.16-405,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2075.135,2076.36,And there is something --
2016.16-405,2,62834,julie_a_murray,,2076.36,2077.08,-- and has for decades.
2016.16-405,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2077.08,2085.5,"I understand the notion that railroads -- for those reasons, they obviously have to have a lot of physical plant, they have to have a lot of workers, they, you know, traverse the State."
2016.16-405,2,62834,julie_a_murray,,2114.025,2149.04,"Well, sir, we are not arguing for a standard that would sweep beyond railroads here. I think there could be aspects of other industries that would lend themselves to the same types of analysis. But I -- I think that railroads actually are in a pretty unique segment of interest -- industry in the sense of unlike interstate or international banks, you know, you depend on railroads to have a permanent physical presence in the State, because, otherwise, you cannot actually, you know, guarantee that you can carry goods from one point of the country to another."
2016.16-405,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2149.04,2154.285,"So trucking companies? Trucking companies, they carry a lot of goods, too."
2016.16-405,2,62834,julie_a_murray,,2154.285,2156.69,"And they can go in many different routes, Your Honor."
2016.16-405,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2158.28,2158.9,"No, no."
2016.16-405,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2165.54,2167.83,I-80 across Montana. (Laughter.)
2016.16-405,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2167.83,2168.32,There you go.
2016.16-405,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2173.49,2179.94,"So -- so I-80 across Montana, that's the route they're going to take. They're going to, just like the railroad, is going to follow the railroad tracks."
2016.16-405,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2179.94,2180.305,Maybe it's 90.
2016.16-405,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2180.305,2181.66,The truckers are going to follow I-80.
2016.16-405,2,62834,julie_a_murray,,2181.66,2236.49,"Well, they're -- they're still not going to have that same sort of permanent physical presence in the State of laying down 2100 miles of track. The other thing that I would point out with respect to BNSF's role in the State of Montana, I think to Justice Sotomayor's question about the registration, we do have an alternative argument with respect to consent, but we have all along also argued that the -- the registration, the longtime doing of business in Montana should -- should play a role and is distinct from some of the -- the cases that this Court -- Court has had before it in the past. And, you know, one other thing to note, which, I think, is, again, distinct from -- including Daimler, what we know here about BNSF is that it is so integrated into Montana's economic and political life, it set up its own government relations shop in the State of Montana."
2016.16-405,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2238.59,2243.165,"Oh, I'm sure a lot of other companies have government relations offices in the State."
2016.16-405,2,62834,julie_a_murray,,2243.165,2245.1,"Well, that may be true, Your Honor."
2016.16-405,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2283.0,2302.39,"You would still have a right to bring a Federal action in Montana -- no? -- under the Section 56, which permits an action to be brought in a district in which the defendant shall be doing business?"
2016.16-405,2,62834,julie_a_murray,,2302.39,2303.49,"No, Your Honor."
2016.16-405,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2323.46,2325.58,That's assuming we reach that issue.
2016.16-405,2,62834,julie_a_murray,,2325.58,2326.47,Right.
2016.16-405,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2327.3,2332.62,"We could just say it's -- we could just say it doesn't apply to State courts, it only applies to Federal courts."
2016.16-405,2,62834,julie_a_murray,,2332.62,2332.99,You could.
2016.16-405,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2332.99,2334.04,Whatever it does.
2016.16-405,2,62834,julie_a_murray,,2334.04,2334.93,"You could, Your Honor."
2016.16-405,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2351.31,2354.395,But it would take care of the question of the -- of where a plaintiff lives.
2016.16-405,2,62834,julie_a_murray,,2354.395,2357.335,It would take care of the question of where a plaintiff lives.
2016.16-405,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2357.335,2362.53,"And, counsel, I -- I must apologize. It's 90 across Montana. (Laughter.)"
2016.16-405,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2362.53,2364.14,80 across Wyoming.
2016.16-405,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2366.82,2368.325,Didn't I say 90? (Laughter.)
2016.16-405,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2368.325,2383.33,"Anyway, your problem, I guess, that you're trying to get around is that Daimler had about 2.4 percent of its world sales in California and was the largest seller of luxury goods in California, luxury cars."
2016.16-405,2,62834,julie_a_murray,,2388.98,2390.51,"Well, certainly --"
2016.16-405,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2390.51,2404.52,"They had a very big market. And the problem is how do you get around that? And -- and I know you're trying, and it's a -- making a valiant effort and so forth, but -- but I don't really see the difference."
2016.16-405,2,62834,julie_a_murray,,2404.52,2415.75,"Well, Your Honor, we hope it's more than a valiant effort in the sense that we do think that there are key distinctions not just in the numbers here in terms of the track and employees and business, but in terms of the nature of the industry --"
2016.16-405,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2415.75,2418.59,What percent -- what percent of their total operation is in Montana?
2016.16-405,2,62834,julie_a_murray,,2418.59,2434.985,"We know that they get up to 10 percent of their revenue in the State of Montana, which, given that they operate in 28 States and a couple Canadian provinces, it has to be the case that that is disproportionately large compared to the other States in which they operate."
2016.16-405,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2434.985,2437.06,Good point.
2016.16-405,2,62834,julie_a_murray,,2437.06,2447.94,"And -- and if -- if I could come back to -- to your question, Justice Sotomayor, about if -- if plaintiffs were able to bring these claims in Federal court versus State, that would certainly be preferable."
2016.16-405,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2448.87,2454.46,"But that would -- that would depend on it being it's a personal jurisdiction provision, not just a venue provision."
2016.16-405,2,62834,julie_a_murray,,2454.46,2455.39,That's -- that's correct.
2016.16-405,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2455.39,2463.48,"If it's a venue provision, which this Court said it was, then you -- you satisfy the venue requirement, but not personal jurisdiction."
2016.16-405,2,62834,julie_a_murray,,2463.48,2473.935,"That's right, your -- Your Honor, and I -- what would happen in that case is that Mr. Nelson, for example, living in North Dakota, would be headed to Washington, Texas, or Delaware to bring his claim."
2016.16-405,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2480.76,2483.575,But what is -- what is his state of residence?
2016.16-405,2,62834,julie_a_murray,,2483.575,2490.22,"He is a North Dakota resident. And -- and was injured, you know, in -- in the State of Washington."
2016.16-405,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2581.715,2594.18,"Ms. Murray, one of the rationales that Montana relied on was that Daimler applied only to foreign corporations, and I didn't see the briefs really grapple or attempt to defend that. Do you -- do you concede that that's erroneous?"
2016.16-405,2,62834,julie_a_murray,,2594.18,2616.985,"We don't -- we think the way that the Montana Court framed it, I think, is not a helpful one to think about it. What -- what I would say is this: I don't think that you can simply say Daimler doesn't apply because it was a foreign corporation. But I do think Daimler, as earlier general jurisdiction cases had recognized, continued to recognize the nature of context matters."
2016.16-405,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2640.415,2640.95,Thank you.
2016.16-405,2,62834,julie_a_murray,,2640.95,2644.865,If the Court has no further questions.
2016.16-405,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2644.865,2649.01,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Tulumello, nine minutes."
2016.16-405,3,17114,andrew_s_tulumello,,2649.01,2652.51,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Just a couple points."
