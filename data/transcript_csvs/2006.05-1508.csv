2006.05-1508,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,8.67,"We'll hear argument first today in case 05-1508, Zuni Public School District, et al. vs. Department of Education."
2006.05-1508,0,40662,ronald_j_vanamberg,,10.906,14.158,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
2006.05-1508,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,120.493,126.481,"Mr. Van Amberg, they were essentially the same as the prior regulations, were they not?"
2006.05-1508,0,40662,ronald_j_vanamberg,,131.401,132.484,Yes.
2006.05-1508,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,164.205,181.298,"I thought that the formula was proposed to Congress by the Department of Education, which is not something that Congress did in other words, to stop the Secretary from whatever he was doing."
2006.05-1508,0,40662,ronald_j_vanamberg,,188.488,195.057,The contention is made that this 545-page omnibus education bill--
2006.05-1508,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,195.057,204.263,"Well, just as to that, the provision that we're talking about, do you say, you say it wasn't drafted by the Department of Education?"
2006.05-1508,0,40662,ronald_j_vanamberg,,204.263,208.151,--I don't think we know exactly who it was drafted by.
2006.05-1508,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,245.157,254.346,"Before you get into the substance let's... let's finish with this, this problem, whether it was indeed the other Secretary's own bill."
2006.05-1508,0,40662,ronald_j_vanamberg,,266.821,267.273,--No.
2006.05-1508,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,267.773,270.475,The prior regulations were promulgated when?
2006.05-1508,0,40662,ronald_j_vanamberg,,270.475,273.943,--The former regulations were promulgated in 1976.
2006.05-1508,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,273.943,276.211,"My goodness, that's a long time before."
2006.05-1508,0,40662,ronald_j_vanamberg,,276.211,276.811,That's a long time.
2006.05-1508,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,276.811,279.33,With a different Secretary now.
2006.05-1508,0,40662,ronald_j_vanamberg,,279.33,280.597,And a different agency.
2006.05-1508,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,281.13,288.019,"So there's no reason to believe that the same Secretary... that the Secretary continued to have the same view of what was proper, is there?"
2006.05-1508,0,40662,ronald_j_vanamberg,,288.019,308.517,"--We view that it did not and, and also, Justice Scalia and Justice Ginsburg, we also view that if this was the chief educational officer of the Federal Government, he was more than capable of developing a statute which reflected his methodology of--"
2006.05-1508,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,308.517,313.052,"Indeed he could have copied the regulations that were on the book and just put them in the statute, couldn't he?"
2006.05-1508,0,40662,ronald_j_vanamberg,,313.052,325.709,"--Well, even in the same act, Your Honor, under when they had the EFIG statute, there Congress was able to reference the regulations of the Secretary."
2006.05-1508,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,331.18,347.392,"Well, as... as far as the difference in time, it was the Secretary's decision, the later Secretary's decision to retain, as you acknowledged, the, almost the identical regulation."
2006.05-1508,0,40662,ronald_j_vanamberg,,354.879,361.283,"--He didn't... if I could, Your Honor, he did not retain the second regulation."
2006.05-1508,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,368.388,368.805,--Yes--
2006.05-1508,0,40662,ronald_j_vanamberg,,368.805,369.655,--and re-enacted.
2006.05-1508,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,369.655,370.105,--and I appreciate that.
2006.05-1508,0,40662,ronald_j_vanamberg,,377.577,378.744,No.
2006.05-1508,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,379.377,391.921,"Was this the same Secretary, by the way, as the Secretary who issued the new regulation, the same Secretary that was in office when the new legislation had been proposed?"
2006.05-1508,0,40662,ronald_j_vanamberg,,391.921,397.908,--The new legislation was '94.
2006.05-1508,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,408.863,409.196,"Why, why would the--"
2006.05-1508,0,40662,ronald_j_vanamberg,,431.276,442.834,"Well, that, and I would agree, Justice Scalia, that that is not a, a usual event where an administration intentionally disgorges from itself its own authority."
2006.05-1508,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,505.508,511.061,"Well, Mr. Van Amberg, is the statutory language really as unambiguous as you suggest?"
2006.05-1508,0,40662,ronald_j_vanamberg,,525.071,531.492,"Well, Justice Alito, I, I think what you, I think it is clear and unambiguous."
2006.05-1508,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,595.75,597.8,"Yes, but what do you distribute?"
2006.05-1508,0,40662,ronald_j_vanamberg,,597.8,598.286,--Pardon?
2006.05-1508,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,598.286,599.919,What do you distribute?
2006.05-1508,0,40662,ronald_j_vanamberg,,620.033,626.27,"It's the distribution of the percent of the, what is--"
2006.05-1508,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,626.27,627.237,Is it a thing?
2006.05-1508,0,40662,ronald_j_vanamberg,,627.237,627.937,--Like a thing.
2006.05-1508,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,627.937,631.072,"Like a... like a set of things that you're distributing, what are they?"
2006.05-1508,0,40662,ronald_j_vanamberg,,631.072,641.112,"The thing that you're running the percentile against is the total number of, of expenditures and revenues in the State."
2006.05-1508,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,641.112,656.039,"In other words, you take all the... there is a set of numbers, each number is a different number and the characteristic of each number is there some school district that spends per, or takes in per pupil, revenue equal to that number."
2006.05-1508,0,40662,ronald_j_vanamberg,,666.762,669.078,"Well, you know, in New Mexico's case you have--"
2006.05-1508,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,669.078,669.412,No.
2006.05-1508,0,40662,ronald_j_vanamberg,,685.323,689.591,"--Well, the, the... the value against which--"
2006.05-1508,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,689.591,690.377,Not a value.
2006.05-1508,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,703.851,706.72,"Counsel, I thought you said that you did know what it was."
2006.05-1508,0,40662,ronald_j_vanamberg,,717.36,718.11,"--Yes, but--"
2006.05-1508,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,718.11,719.194,"I'm sorry, I don't know how--"
2006.05-1508,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,719.194,740.893,"Such revenues or expenditures in the State consist of, the word ""such"" obviously refers you back to some prior reference to revenues in the State, and that prior reference in subsection A is a reference to district by district, not pupil by pupil."
2006.05-1508,0,40662,ronald_j_vanamberg,,740.893,741.726,"--That, that's correct."
2006.05-1508,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,741.726,746.464,"--So, so in other words we are distributing those cards, it's a set of numbers?"
2006.05-1508,0,40662,ronald_j_vanamberg,,754.784,759.687,"Well, I'm sorry, Justice... I'm... Breyer; I'm having a little trouble understanding--"
2006.05-1508,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,759.687,760.621,"Well, I... I thought not."
2006.05-1508,0,40662,ronald_j_vanamberg,,761.054,762.023,--the question.
2006.05-1508,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,762.023,765.341,"You're not certain about the hypothetical but you're certain about the statute, aren't you?"
2006.05-1508,0,40662,ronald_j_vanamberg,,765.341,767.377,I'm certain about the statute.
2006.05-1508,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,784.153,785.005,--Yeah... that... right.
2006.05-1508,0,40662,ronald_j_vanamberg,,804.233,804.683,Correct.
2006.05-1508,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,804.683,811.988,"And if that's what percentile refers to, I just want to know what those things are that are being distributed."
2006.05-1508,0,40662,ronald_j_vanamberg,,825.396,825.88,All right.
2006.05-1508,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,851.463,856.117,And does the statute say you have to do it that way?
2006.05-1508,0,40662,ronald_j_vanamberg,,858.001,863.521,"It's my understanding under... under Brown and Williamson is if Congress speaks to an issue, Congress is to be obeyed."
2006.05-1508,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,863.521,863.921,Clearly.
2006.05-1508,0,40662,ronald_j_vanamberg,,863.921,867.659,There is nothing mysterious about this type of a methodology.
2006.05-1508,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,870.159,876.479,"No, you could do it that way and the reason the Government, I think, says that you shouldn't do it that way is that it would produce an absurd result."
2006.05-1508,0,40662,ronald_j_vanamberg,,876.479,876.979,All right.
2006.05-1508,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,876.979,880.865,That the object of the statute is to catch the outliers.
2006.05-1508,0,40662,ronald_j_vanamberg,,899.761,906.265,And you have a similar infirmity associated with the other methodology.
2006.05-1508,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,928.829,935.267,"Doesn't, doesn't subsection b(ii) address outliers?"
2006.05-1508,0,40662,ronald_j_vanamberg,,968.423,969.106,--Yes.
2006.05-1508,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1034.015,1041.954,"It, it eliminates 26 school districts but those 26 school districts account for 5 percent or 10 percent of the pupils."
2006.05-1508,0,40662,ronald_j_vanamberg,,1068.271,1084.198,"And Justice Breyer, I think Congress and in its methodology has disagreed with that view, because it does not rely strictly upon pupils, and pupils are not necessarily the driving force in how we work this formula."
2006.05-1508,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1084.198,1088.768,I thought the problem was disparity in school districts.
2006.05-1508,0,40662,ronald_j_vanamberg,,1111.848,1113.15,And that is correct.
2006.05-1508,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1167.602,1214.683,"Mr. Van Amberg, if there is any ambiguity in the statute, one relevant consideration might be how would this work across States, and I think it's true, is it not, that your reading would lead to wildly different, wildly different results from State to State depending on whether they have large districts or small districts at the top and the bottom, whereas the other way, counting pupils rather than school districts regardless of size, you would get uniformity going from State to State."
2006.05-1508,0,40662,ronald_j_vanamberg,,1214.683,1230.877,"Justice Ginsburg, the Secretary recognized in 1976 that both methodologies have their problems, depending on how your districts, the number of districts that you have in a State, their relative populations, how they line up."
2006.05-1508,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1233.329,1246.57,"Am I correct in understanding that at the end of the line here, if you win the Federal money will go to your two districts, whereas if the other side wins the Federal money will go to the State?"
2006.05-1508,0,40662,ronald_j_vanamberg,,1248.756,1249.739,--That's the bottom line.
2006.05-1508,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1249.739,1250.389,Yes.
2006.05-1508,0,40662,ronald_j_vanamberg,,1250.389,1259.896,"And I would point out, Justice Stevens, that Congress has made it clear that the impact aid is supposed to go to the impacted districts."
2006.05-1508,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1293.099,1294.385,Let me ask another general question.
2006.05-1508,0,40662,ronald_j_vanamberg,,1310.244,1333.176,"Well, it actually depends... you get into statistical approaches, but if, let's say, there were less than 20 districts, you just had let's say 18 districts or 19 districts, then if you do the percentile against, if you work the percentile in that particular setting, nobody gets eliminated."
2006.05-1508,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1333.176,1336.795,"But you have the same problem if it's students, I take it?"
2006.05-1508,0,40662,ronald_j_vanamberg,,1344.15,1353.339,"Correct, because you would run... because if you had districts, big districts at both ends, you run your 5 percent on both ends with the students, you end up not eliminating anybody."
2006.05-1508,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1353.339,1354.056,That's all right.
2006.05-1508,0,40662,ronald_j_vanamberg,,1407.808,1422.067,"Well, Justice Breyer, I, I would respectfully like to go back, not to what we are trying to accomplish through judicial decision, but what Congress accomplished through its decision."
2006.05-1508,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1422.067,1422.483,I understand that.
2006.05-1508,0,40662,ronald_j_vanamberg,,1461.609,1462.144,Right.
2006.05-1508,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1583.673,1584.906,I see your white light is on.
2006.05-1508,0,40662,ronald_j_vanamberg,,1590.91,1596.981,"Kansas equalizes under any formula, as New Mexico did, could do."
2006.05-1508,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1629.135,1634.022,"Thank you, counsel."
2006.05-1508,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1638.474,1641.426,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2006.05-1508,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1641.426,1646.08,"Mr. Srinivasan, you don't want us to stretch the language, do you?"
2006.05-1508,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1646.08,1648.116,"--Well, I don't think you need to stretch the language, Justice Scalia."
2006.05-1508,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1648.116,1650.532,"And you wouldn't urge us to do either, would you?"
2006.05-1508,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1650.532,1651.568,"Well, it depends on what--"
2006.05-1508,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1673.414,1676.349,"What's the case that says ""unambiguously foreclosed""?"
2006.05-1508,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1676.349,1681.753,"--Well, Brand X says that, but it's a characterization of the step one inquiry under Chevron."
2006.05-1508,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1703.017,1706.286,You begin with an argument that directly cuts against your position.
2006.05-1508,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1711.856,1712.639,--I am.
2006.05-1508,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1712.639,1714.474,"Well, they did it there, they didn't do it here."
2006.05-1508,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1718.26,1720.343,"I don't think so, Mr. Chief Justice, with respect."
2006.05-1508,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1741.774,1743.909,Which they did not say in this act.
2006.05-1508,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1743.909,1755.016,"--They didn't, but I think it would be very odd to attribute to Congress the intention on one hand to say, we like your regulation, so much so that we want to use it and we want you to continue to use it for purposes of the EFIG program--"
2006.05-1508,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1755.016,1755.449,Different purposes.
2006.05-1508,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1755.449,1755.783,--They're not--
2006.05-1508,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1755.783,1756.885,They're for different purposes.
2006.05-1508,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1756.885,1759.235,"--They're not different purposes at all, Justice Scalia, with respect."
2006.05-1508,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1769.276,1770.509,But for different purposes.
2006.05-1508,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1783.536,1791.207,"Well, at that level of generality you might be right, but with respect to the purpose of the equalization provisions of both of those acts the purpose is exactly the same."
2006.05-1508,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1799.028,1800.412,"Well, maybe let me ask it directly."
2006.05-1508,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1806.984,1807.384,"Well, because--"
2006.05-1508,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1807.384,1816.84,"They instead went to the trouble of mimicking part of the regulation, but not mimicking the appendix, which is where your calculation methodology is."
2006.05-1508,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1816.84,1818.224,"--Well, they didn't mimic it."
2006.05-1508,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1829.398,1834.885,"Can I ask, is there a difference legally between a regulation and an appendix to the regulation?"
2006.05-1508,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1834.885,1840.555,"I don't think so, at least not in the circumstance of this case, where the regulation by its own terms incorporates the appendix."
2006.05-1508,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1845.007,1846.109,"But you say ""incorporated"", though."
2006.05-1508,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1848.978,1849.445,No.
2006.05-1508,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1849.445,1850.428,--No?
2006.05-1508,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1850.428,1851.347,"No, I don't think so, Your Honor."
2006.05-1508,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1865.738,1866.257,In the EFIG statute?
2006.05-1508,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1866.257,1867.473,--In the EFIG statute.
2006.05-1508,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1867.473,1872.594,"But in this statute the regulation says look to the, look at the appendix."
2006.05-1508,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1880.414,1886.734,"Well, it didn't take the part that said look to the appendix because I don't know that that would have been a sensible thing to do when you're enacting a statute."
2006.05-1508,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1897.357,1898.959,And it didn't do that here?
2006.05-1508,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1898.959,1900.559,"It didn't do that here, but it didn't have to."
2006.05-1508,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1901.078,1907.148,"I still think it cuts against you rather than for you, the fact that they could have done the same thing here and we wouldn't have this case."
2006.05-1508,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1907.148,1913.135,"--Well, let me just make one more point on this, Your Honor, and then I'll move to the text of Section 7709, because I do think that this point has a great deal of force."
2006.05-1508,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1942.318,1946.956,"Mr. Srinivasan, if we could come to the, to the text that you're talking about."
2006.05-1508,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1946.956,1948.022,--Sure.
2006.05-1508,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1948.022,1965.25,"What I don't understand about the Government's position is why you use this, this per pupil theory for purposes of (B), but don't use it for purposes of (A)."
2006.05-1508,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1994.935,2009.695,"Well, if you look at 2(a), Your Honor what that says is that the disparity, the disparity standard at its broadest level deals with whether the per-pupil revenues for the highest ranked local educational agency exceeds the per pupil revenues for the lowest one by 25 percent."
2006.05-1508,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2009.695,2010.112,Right.
2006.05-1508,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,2010.112,2015.147,"It would make no difference if you take into account pupils for that part of the analysis, and here's the reason why."
2006.05-1508,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2047.201,2056.806,"You're saying it comes to the same, but the fact remains you don't use that methodology in A, because you don't think the language requires that methodology."
2006.05-1508,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,2059.009,2061.525,"No, there would be... I don't know that we use one or the other."
2006.05-1508,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2064.996,2076.434,"Well, the purpose would be to follow the language of the statute, and if you think that the language in B requires this kind of an approach you should take the same approach in A, especially if it makes no difference."
2006.05-1508,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,2076.434,2085.992,"--Well, no; especially because it makes no difference, because with respect to the B part of it, the 95th and 5th percentile exclusions, it makes all the difference in the world whether you take into account--"
2006.05-1508,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2085.992,2093.33,"I have a conceptual difficulty, and it may be my limitations with the way you do it."
2006.05-1508,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,2100.15,2100.702,--Effectively.
2006.05-1508,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2100.702,2108.073,But I would have thought the per-pupil concept only makes sense if you're dealing with LEAs.
2006.05-1508,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,2155.72,2164.426,"Well, it's an approximation to be sure, and per-pupil revenues by definition deal with approximations across the swath of students that are covered by local educational agencies."
2006.05-1508,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2164.426,2172.765,"And it's only... the reason is to rank them if you have an entity that has a swath of students, the district, that's the way it should be ranked."
2006.05-1508,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,2181.038,2195.297,"Well, I think what we're really doing, Your Honor, is weighting each figure by the amount of pupils in the school district, and the reason we're doing that is to get a more accurate picture of the extent to which any one school district's per-pupil revenue figure contributes to the overall revenue pictures in the State."
2006.05-1508,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2261.823,2262.24,No--
2006.05-1508,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,2262.24,2262.64,Because--
2006.05-1508,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2262.64,2264.642,"--Well, because it's an absurd hypothetical."
2006.05-1508,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,2265.192,2266.477,--I don't... I... it is not--
2006.05-1508,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2266.477,2272.297,"--What is the smallest number of districts, what is the smallest number of school districts in a State?"
2006.05-1508,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,2272.297,2273.297,--One.
2006.05-1508,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2273.297,2274.915,Which State has one school district?
2006.05-1508,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,2274.915,2275.515,Hawaii.
2006.05-1508,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2279.867,2287.64,"In the, in the hypothetical you posed why couldn't the Secretary address that disparity under (b)(ii)?"
2006.05-1508,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,2305.435,2308.471,"Two points on (b)(ii), Mr. Chief Justice."
2006.05-1508,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2318.76,2319.61,Why do you have to do that?
2006.05-1508,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,2326.433,2333.502,"--No, my point is simply that under (b)(i) the statute says the Secretary shall disregard local education agencies that are above the 95th and below the 5th percentile."
2006.05-1508,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2365.491,2367.51,"Mr. Srinivasan, you... you may have convinced me."
2006.05-1508,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,2395.693,2395.977,No.
2006.05-1508,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2396.81,2398.412,Then... then would you address the text?
2006.05-1508,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,2398.412,2399.412,"Sure, I will."
2006.05-1508,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2413.721,2414.121,Okay.
2006.05-1508,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,2414.121,2414.906,Now one point I make--
2006.05-1508,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2414.906,2417.858,So what is supposed to be disregarded are educational agencies?
2006.05-1508,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,2417.858,2418.225,--Yes.
2006.05-1508,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2418.225,2418.825,Right.
2006.05-1508,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,2425.946,2432.868,You identify the agencies to be disregarded by first identifying the 59th and 5th percentiles of per-pupil revenues in the State.
2006.05-1508,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2433.918,2437.57,"And we identify their per-pupil revenues, too, don't we?"
2006.05-1508,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,2443.974,2450.163,"--Yes, but... and... but the critical test is the 95th percentile and 5th percentile of such expenditures or revenues in the State."
2006.05-1508,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2450.163,2458.817,"But that critical test is being applied to an agency which is being identified by reference to per-pupil expenditures or revenues, correct?"
2006.05-1508,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,2458.817,2459.285,It is.
2006.05-1508,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2467.173,2469.791,"Well, it's not merely that they are associated with."
2006.05-1508,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,2486.253,2487.27,--I don't think so.
2006.05-1508,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2488.353,2496.942,"Then, then what does the phrase with per-pupil expenditures or revenues above 95 or below 5 mean?"
2006.05-1508,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,2496.942,2501.946,"--Well, that's true that each local education agency has a per-pupil expenditure or revenue."
2006.05-1508,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2512.052,2512.987,"Well, why doesn't it?"
2006.05-1508,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,2534.583,2537.852,"--Well, we... two parts to the answer, Justice Souter."
2006.05-1508,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2547.041,2547.391,Right.
2006.05-1508,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,2547.993,2549.826,Where we disagree is in identifying the 95th exactly.
2006.05-1508,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2549.826,2553.028,--After identifying them in terms of the expenditures or revenues.
2006.05-1508,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,2554.147,2554.747,Exactly.
2006.05-1508,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2563.086,2578.262,"There are lots of things that Congress could have done differently from what it did do, but it, that doesn't seem to me to inject an ambiguity in the identification in, in this subsection of the LEA that we are talking about."
2006.05-1508,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,2586.868,2590.986,"--Well, I think it does, Your Honor, because there are two different ways of ranking the LEAs."
2006.05-1508,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2601.378,2602.544,"Sure, that's another way to--"
2006.05-1508,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,2602.544,2603.294,Nothing in the statute forecloses that approach.
2006.05-1508,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2603.294,2605.663,"--do it, but tell me why that is consistent with the text."
2006.05-1508,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,2605.663,2616.138,"Because the text refers to the 95th and 5th percentiles of such expenditures or revenues in the State, and the list that includes the weighting does represent a list of expenditures or revenues in the State."
2006.05-1508,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2616.138,2619.173,Would such be... of such expenditures or revenues.
2006.05-1508,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,2637.801,2638.167,Sure.
2006.05-1508,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2651.977,2656.846,"Wouldn't the statute have told you, though, to, to disregard pupils according to the ranking?"
2006.05-1508,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,2666.486,2674.99,"--Well, it is, it is a ranking of LEAs in the first instance and then it's, each of those LEA figures is weighted by the number of pupils the way we do it, and we do end up disregarding LEAs."
2006.05-1508,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2684.615,2685.065,May I ask--
2006.05-1508,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,2685.065,2686.682,And nothing in the statute forecloses that.
2006.05-1508,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2687.2,2688.65,--a rather basic question?
2006.05-1508,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,2699.608,2703.16,"Well, one way or another I think your should rule in our favor."
2006.05-1508,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2703.91,2705.295,Well no.
2006.05-1508,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,2709.147,2713.801,"Well, I think in that situation you sort of have the sliding scale that we often confront with textual analysis."
2006.05-1508,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2719.955,2725.073,"I don't think it has to be absurd, it's just, I would measure it by what Congress actually intended."
2006.05-1508,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,2743.154,2748.455,"--Well, if the language absolutely unambiguously compels that reading, then I think it would be a difficult position."
2006.05-1508,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2750.84,2761.032,I would have thought your office had answered that question in countless briefs where it tells us to be guided by the language of the statute and not some unexpressed intent.
2006.05-1508,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,2761.032,2767.436,"Well, that's why I said, if you think that the statute unambiguously actually compels that reading, then I don't know that we would have a position."
2006.05-1508,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2767.436,2771.471,"Well, you still have a Church of the Holy Trinity team over there somewhere, don't you?"
2006.05-1508,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2773.256,2777.208,Why doesn't it... why doesn't absolutely compel it?
2006.05-1508,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,2779.077,2779.56,It says--
2006.05-1508,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2779.56,2784.73,--the 5th percentile of such per-pupil expenditure.
2006.05-1508,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,2785.747,2786.263,--That's right.
2006.05-1508,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2786.263,2794.25,"--Now how are you going to get that so it doesn't just say just list cards with per-pupil expenditure on it, different ones and take the top five?"
2006.05-1508,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,2794.25,2797.719,"Well, well it's just the number of cards, ultimately, under your hypothetical, Justice Breyer."
2006.05-1508,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2797.719,2799.719,Do you have a lot of cards that have the same cards that have the same number?
2006.05-1508,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,2800.169,2801.421,"They have the same cards, we just have... they have the numbers, exactly."
2006.05-1508,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2801.421,2801.871,--Yeah.
2006.05-1508,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,2801.871,2803.087,It's the same cards with the same numbers.
2006.05-1508,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2808.241,2819.132,"And why, why don't you take the top five where we have 10 percent of the students, let's take the second five and they happens to have the same number on the card as the first five, and why don't they fall in the first 5 percent?"
2006.05-1508,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,2819.132,2820.165,I'm not sure I understand.
2006.05-1508,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2820.165,2820.632,All right.
2006.05-1508,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,2821.8,2822.25,Sorry.
2006.05-1508,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2822.25,2828.588,Can you enlighten us a little bit about how this statute developed?
2006.05-1508,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,2828.588,2828.904,Sure.
2006.05-1508,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2828.904,2839.546,"As far as I know it was the same Secretary of Education when the statute came on the books and when the regulation was kind of readopted, I think it was--"
2006.05-1508,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,2839.546,2842.414,"I think that's right, Justice Ginsburg."
2006.05-1508,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2842.414,2849.485,"--But there was a peculiar proposal to drop, it was the Secretary's proposal to drop the bottom five."
2006.05-1508,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,2858.358,2871.331,"Well, as we point out in a footnote in our brief there was some education finance experts that suggested there would be no reason to retain the exclusion at the bottom of the range, and I think that's because when you have low per-pupil revenues there is a reason not to exclude those figures."
2006.05-1508,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2886.493,2888.71,"Thank you, Counsel."

2006.05-1508,3,42056,sri_srinivasan,,3246.341,3250.726,"In 2.A, 2.A calls for a different type of comparison."
2006.05-1508,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3283.181,3288.101,"To include the words per-pupil revenue for each pupil, is that what you're saying?"
2006.05-1508,4,34853,leigh_marc_manasevit,,3288.101,3288.884,"Well, to--"
2006.05-1508,4,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3288.884,3294.655,"How do you want to say it, per-pupil revenue attached to each pupil?"
2006.05-1508,4,34853,leigh_marc_manasevit,,3294.655,3295.774,"--Well, I believe--"
2006.05-1508,4,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3295.774,3297.09,Or how do you want to say it then?
2006.05-1508,4,34853,leigh_marc_manasevit,,3297.09,3310.534,"--I believe simply that the word per-pupil revenue can mean the dollar amount per each agency 89 times, or it can mean repeated each time a student generates--"
2006.05-1508,4,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3310.534,3312.7,What is attached to each pupil?
2006.05-1508,4,34853,leigh_marc_manasevit,,3320.49,3320.973,--Yes.
2006.05-1508,4,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3322.425,3325.46,And I don't know where to look to discover if you're right or wrong.
2006.05-1508,4,34853,leigh_marc_manasevit,,3325.46,3330.161,"--Well, bear in mind... bear in mind the nature of many education--"
2006.05-1508,4,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3330.161,3334.731,Is there any statistical text that you could look at to see it that's the way people use the words?
2006.05-1508,4,34853,leigh_marc_manasevit,,3334.731,3348.706,"--That answer I couldn't answer, but I can tell you that typically in an education statute, funding is distributed on the basis of numbers of pupils."
2006.05-1508,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3358.014,3364.751,"Well, that must not be right, because otherwise we wouldn't have any disparity to worry about equalization in the first place."
2006.05-1508,4,34853,leigh_marc_manasevit,,3365.251,3371.754,"--Well, we always... we always will have disparity in the real world and that... and that's because lots of things cause disparity."
2006.05-1508,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3451.54,3470.687,"Don't you think Congress, if Congress is concerned about the, in this provision, about the impact of the Federal presence, and your reading prevents the money that Congress meant to go to those particular districts from actually reaching the districts, I mean, wouldn't we be inclined to read it the way that, let the money get where Congress meant it to go?"
2006.05-1508,4,34853,leigh_marc_manasevit,,3470.687,3479.043,"--Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, because that was on the list of things that I wanted to cover, and I'm sure that petitioners 'counsel inadvertently misspoke."
2006.05-1508,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3488.416,3493.017,"Well, sure, but then the question is whether the State can consider it when they're figuring out how much money to give it."
2006.05-1508,4,34853,leigh_marc_manasevit,,3494.385,3511.312,"--Well, remember, the State figures a total cost of program for every district starting from zero, number of students and dollars needed to manage those number of students, and the State supplies that amount of money."
2006.05-1508,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3528.024,3528.974,"Thank you, counsel."
2006.05-1508,4,34853,leigh_marc_manasevit,,3528.974,3530.159,Thank you very much.
2006.05-1508,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3530.159,3535.212,"Mr. Van Amberg, you have three minutes remaining."
2006.05-1508,5,40662,ronald_j_vanamberg,,3535.212,3553.091,"Mr. Chief Justice had a question as to whether or not the, an appendix is something different from a regulation or carries a different weight, and I haven't found anything determinative."
2006.05-1508,5,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3644.851,3649.219,"Mr. Van Amberg, could a State get to the same result?"
2006.05-1508,5,40662,ronald_j_vanamberg,,3673.582,3695.614,"There is a provision, Justice Ginsburg, in the Impact Aid Act, and I think it's 7113, in which it basically says that if the Secretary of the Education perceives that a State is manipulating its LEAs in a way in which to take advantage of the, of this limited exception, it can disregard that action."
2006.05-1508,5,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3703.168,3703.636,Thank you.
2006.05-1508,5,40662,ronald_j_vanamberg,,3703.636,3704.186,Thank you.
2006.05-1508,5,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3705.17,3705.836,"Thank you, counsel."
