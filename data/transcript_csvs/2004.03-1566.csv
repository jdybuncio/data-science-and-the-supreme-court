2004.03-1566,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,0.0,4.93,We will now hear argument in Orff against the United States.
2004.03-1566,0,46199,william_m_smiland,,6.194,9.743,"Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court:"
2004.03-1566,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,54.829,61.672,"Mr. Smiland, do you mind telling us why the petitioners never filed suit in the Court of Federal Claims?"
2004.03-1566,0,46199,william_m_smiland,,61.672,63.613,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2004.03-1566,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,105.306,106.588,Is it concurrent?
2004.03-1566,0,46199,william_m_smiland,,121.736,123.76,"Well, we think so, Your Honor."
2004.03-1566,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,123.76,124.315,They were?
2004.03-1566,0,46199,william_m_smiland,,131.373,132.488,Rule 19(s)?
2004.03-1566,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,132.488,132.943,--Yes.
2004.03-1566,0,46199,william_m_smiland,,134.058,139.092,That... that procedure was not invoked here.
2004.03-1566,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,139.092,139.63,No.
2004.03-1566,0,46199,william_m_smiland,,154.12,154.963,No.
2004.03-1566,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,156.632,156.765,"No, okay."
2004.03-1566,0,46199,william_m_smiland,,170.75,175.851,--Because the waiver of sovereign immunity statute says in any suit.
2004.03-1566,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,175.851,182.705,It doesn't mean in any suit in sentence 2 of the kind referred to in sentence 1?
2004.03-1566,0,46199,william_m_smiland,,191.538,201.281,"Well, it... it does and that case was litigated against the United States by my clients and... and we won in the Peck case."
2004.03-1566,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,206.483,223.323,"But don't... how can we, if we have... if... if I read this... this as meaning technically what it says and it's a jurisdictional matter, how could I do anything other than say, go to the Court of Claims, you're in the wrong court?"
2004.03-1566,0,46199,william_m_smiland,,223.323,227.409,"Any suit is also in the first sentence, Your Honor."
2004.03-1566,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,227.409,227.864,Yes.
2004.03-1566,0,46199,william_m_smiland,,228.485,229.35,And... and--
2004.03-1566,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,229.35,234.097,--in any suit you can join the United States as a necessary party.
2004.03-1566,0,46199,william_m_smiland,,234.097,244.128,"--The... the... in the sue and be sued cases, this Court construes that very broadly, and this is the same root word and--"
2004.03-1566,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,244.128,249.345,"Well, but we don't give broad construction to waivers of sovereign immunity."
2004.03-1566,0,46199,william_m_smiland,,249.345,249.529,--I--
2004.03-1566,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,249.529,250.777,Quite the reverse.
2004.03-1566,0,46199,william_m_smiland,,276.079,277.193,--They were not the signing--
2004.03-1566,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,277.193,277.648,No.
2004.03-1566,0,46199,william_m_smiland,,277.648,278.574,--party.
2004.03-1566,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,278.574,280.582,So you've got more problems.
2004.03-1566,0,46199,william_m_smiland,,280.582,285.987,"Our... our argument... and again, this has been resolved in the lower courts against the Government."
2004.03-1566,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,300.022,318.392,"If you... if the lower courts were of this view, why did the district court in this case give you three opportunities to have your contract claim transferred to the Claims Court?"
2004.03-1566,0,46199,william_m_smiland,,318.392,335.195,"Once the determination was made that we were not intended third party beneficiaries, that was the law of the case, and had it been transferred to the Claims Court, we... we would have been bound by that determination."
2004.03-1566,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,346.545,357.607,But it does suggest that the district court had at least some concern whether the case... your claim had been lodged in the right court.
2004.03-1566,0,46199,william_m_smiland,,357.607,369.208,"Yes, although again that... that court had been hearing these matters for many years in... in numerous cases without this issue ever having come up."
2004.03-1566,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,369.208,372.634,"Well, but it's a... see, I want to know what I'm supposed to do."
2004.03-1566,0,46199,william_m_smiland,,392.242,398.929,Just the... the language of in any suit definitely is--
2004.03-1566,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,398.929,399.012,"No, no."
2004.03-1566,0,46199,william_m_smiland,,403.759,404.38,--Yes.
2004.03-1566,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,404.38,408.589,What they give consent to is joinder as a necessary party.
2004.03-1566,0,46199,william_m_smiland,,410.901,417.876,Only the... the general principle that language should be read in its ordinary meaning--
2004.03-1566,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,417.876,422.956,"It's ordinary meaning, you're out because the ordinary meaning of joinder as a necessary party is you weren't joined as a necessary--"
2004.03-1566,0,46199,william_m_smiland,,422.956,433.83,--There... there at least is no evidence that Congress had rule 19 in mind when it enacted either the '52 statute or the '82 statute that we... we stand on.
2004.03-1566,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,433.83,462.992,"Well, it's something that I hadn't concentrated on before now, but your position that, well, if you're transferred to the Court... to the Court of Claims, that you bring with you all of the previous rulings of the United States district court in California and that those are somehow binding because of the law of the case... what is the authority for that?"
2004.03-1566,0,46199,william_m_smiland,,470.117,472.262,"I... our understanding is if, obviously--"
2004.03-1566,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,472.262,473.583,"I mean, what's the authority for that?"
2004.03-1566,0,46199,william_m_smiland,,473.583,478.002,"--I can't cite you authority, Your Honor, but I... we were very concerned about that."
2004.03-1566,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,489.186,493.235,Could I... I... I guess I'm not following this.
2004.03-1566,0,46199,william_m_smiland,,515.897,521.059,It is and... and when I was talking about in any suit--
2004.03-1566,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,521.059,521.682,--How does that help you?
2004.03-1566,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,532.949,534.518,I... I--
2004.03-1566,0,46199,william_m_smiland,,534.518,552.146,"--Well, it... it... if the words, join necessary, limit any suit and the language that Justice Scalia referred to, then... then maybe we're in trouble."
2004.03-1566,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,552.639,568.614,"--I... I take that to mean that when you sue one defendant and you also sue the United States as a necessary party defendant, that suit... any... that would be a suit pursuant to this section."
2004.03-1566,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,595.918,597.776,You... you agree with that.
2004.03-1566,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,605.495,608.195,Perhaps you can explain.
2004.03-1566,0,46199,william_m_smiland,,615.526,617.012,--The district sued the United States.
2004.03-1566,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,618.021,623.511,"And then after some, I think, 2 years--"
2004.03-1566,0,46199,william_m_smiland,,623.511,624.071,Yes.
2004.03-1566,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,624.071,626.937,--the water district bows out.
2004.03-1566,0,46199,william_m_smiland,,642.897,646.816,"The record is very sparse, Your Honor."
2004.03-1566,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,684.711,687.395,"Mr. Smiland, can I ask this question?"
2004.03-1566,0,46199,william_m_smiland,,702.916,704.735,"Not to my knowledge, Your Honor."
2004.03-1566,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,704.735,712.537,Could... could we hear your argument on... on the sovereign immunity point as opposed to the venue point?
2004.03-1566,0,46199,william_m_smiland,,720.377,722.318,There are two statutes.
2004.03-1566,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,722.318,726.738,May... may we just back up to the question... your answer to Justice Stevens?
2004.03-1566,0,46199,william_m_smiland,,740.484,741.803,"They pled both, Your Honor."
2004.03-1566,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,757.241,775.817,"Because one could... one could read the words, suit to adjudicate, confirm, validate, or decree the contractual rights, as a suit for declaratory relief but not encompassing damages."
2004.03-1566,0,46199,william_m_smiland,,775.817,790.639,"--Both statutes we cite say that judgments can be entered in the same manner, to the same extent as a private individual under like circumstances, language I believe from the Federal Tort Claims Act."
2004.03-1566,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,842.485,844.509,Can you turn to sovereign immunity now?
2004.03-1566,0,46199,william_m_smiland,,844.509,844.964,Yes.
2004.03-1566,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,844.964,847.126,And... and let me make... make it easy for you.
2004.03-1566,0,46199,william_m_smiland,,874.147,874.686,No.
2004.03-1566,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,874.686,887.196,"And... and you think it's clear that... as our sovereign immunity law requires, that such a third party beneficiary can sue the United States?"
2004.03-1566,0,46199,william_m_smiland,,887.196,904.408,"For example, in the U.S. v. District Court case decided by this Court in 1971, under the McCarran Act, that fact situation was not before you, but the Court did say that the rights to which the statute referred were all inclusive."
2004.03-1566,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,906.448,908.844,I... I don't understand that.
2004.03-1566,0,46199,william_m_smiland,,939.868,956.792,"Well, we have explicit rights here and... and it would seem to me that if... if... and this was certainly the legislative history behind section 221, not... not behind McCarran."
2004.03-1566,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,983.336,989.818,"Because... because we have a rule that says when Congress wants the United States to be sued, it... it must say so clearly."
2004.03-1566,0,46199,william_m_smiland,,989.818,996.051,You also have the rule that the word contract means the law of contract and not parts of it.
2004.03-1566,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,996.051,1013.679,"But yes, isn't it arguable, though, that in this case the Government probably thought that it would be efficient to have the district represent all the farmers for whatever their... to the extent their interests were shared with one another, rather than having every individual have the same right to bring... bring a lawsuit?"
2004.03-1566,0,46199,william_m_smiland,,1013.679,1025.689,"Efficient in... in collecting land assessments and water charges, but there's no evidence in the... either the language of the statute, I submit, or the--"
2004.03-1566,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1025.689,1027.917,"Except for the fact that the district is the party to the contract, though."
2004.03-1566,0,46199,william_m_smiland,,1027.917,1034.317,"--Nothing was said about litigation, let alone intended third party beneficiary--"
2004.03-1566,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1034.317,1037.166,"Well, but the... the whole point of the district... correct if I'm wrong."
2004.03-1566,0,46199,william_m_smiland,,1052.854,1065.009,"--There's a lot of legislative history there, and it talks a great deal, as you say, Your Honor, about efficiency and... and the convenience."
2004.03-1566,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1072.544,1090.916,But you haven't really achieved very much efficiency if you simply get the United States out of the business of collecting the payments and of keeping track of the payments but leave the United States subject to suit when the person who has authority to do... do these things goofs.
2004.03-1566,0,46199,william_m_smiland,,1100.325,1108.477,"Well, it... this is a transaction between a water seller and many water buyers."
2004.03-1566,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1209.43,1216.611,But the... the Justice Department has no authority to... to consent to suit which... which Congress has not consented to.
2004.03-1566,0,46199,william_m_smiland,,1218.718,1230.607,"Again, if... if this Court should hold that neither of the two statutes on... on which we stand waive sovereign immunity, and--"
2004.03-1566,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1230.607,1235.641,And this alone wouldn't... wouldn't remedy the--
2004.03-1566,0,46199,william_m_smiland,,1235.641,1236.384,--Then... then--
2004.03-1566,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1236.384,1237.044,--the absence--
2004.03-1566,0,46199,william_m_smiland,,1237.044,1244.353,--the decision that we're not intended beneficiaries should be vacated and we should have a chance to go to the court... Claims Court.
2004.03-1566,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1254.939,1256.425,"You may, indeed, Mr. Smiland."
2004.03-1566,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1260.657,1264.953,"Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court:"
2004.03-1566,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1290.671,1295.046,"Mr. Minear, do you think it does waive sovereign immunity for suits brought by the district?"
2004.03-1566,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1295.046,1296.82,"--In one circumstance, Your Honor."
2004.03-1566,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1312.052,1315.85,Did this suit begin as a suit by a water user against the district and then you were joined later?
2004.03-1566,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1316.305,1322.621,"--No, it did not, but that did occur in the Barcellos & Wolfsen litigation that ran between 1978 and 1980."
2004.03-1566,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1322.621,1325.593,"--Well, in this suit, did not the district bring it against the United States?"
2004.03-1566,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1325.593,1326.336,That's correct.
2004.03-1566,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1326.336,1329.68,And was that a... was that jurisdiction proper at that time?
2004.03-1566,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1329.68,1335.874,"That suit was brought under the APA, and the district brought the suit on that basis."
2004.03-1566,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1335.874,1337.482,But was it properly brought is what I'm asking you.
2004.03-1566,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1337.482,1339.051,That suit was properly brought.
2004.03-1566,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1339.051,1339.877,Okay.
2004.03-1566,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1339.877,1341.651,But it was not brought under 390uu.
2004.03-1566,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1349.043,1349.99,And no money damages.
2004.03-1566,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1349.99,1353.418,"And no money damages as well, and that's what distinguishes this case."
2004.03-1566,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1353.418,1363.078,"So that... so your view... I mean, what... what makes sense to me is that the section means what it says, that consent is given to join the United States."
2004.03-1566,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1402.17,1405.802,"Yes, that is our view, and let me supplement your comments in this regard."
2004.03-1566,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1406.424,1409.396,May I... may I... has that always been your view throughout?
2004.03-1566,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1409.633,1414.347,--It has been our view under 390uu when section 390uu has been... has been raised.
2004.03-1566,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1414.347,1415.833,But throughout the litigation?
2004.03-1566,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1415.833,1418.312,Throughout this litigation?
2004.03-1566,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1426.319,1428.176,There has to be an ongoing suit.
2004.03-1566,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1439.693,1443.12,"Your Honor, let me explain why that's the case, and there was an answer--"
2004.03-1566,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1443.12,1443.658,Why what is the case?
2004.03-1566,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1443.658,1446.63,--Why there's a necessity for an ongoing suit.
2004.03-1566,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1446.63,1452.119,"You... that is to say, there's a suit between only two individuals and then the United States is brought in."
2004.03-1566,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1452.119,1459.838,"Your Honor, this... this provision was enacted in response to a specific problem that's illustrated by the Barcellos & Wolfsen litigation."
2004.03-1566,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1477.011,1477.588,I understand that.
2004.03-1566,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1504.709,1516.12,"--The language could be construed to allow that, but... but waivers of sovereign immunity are construed narrowly, and the language I think is more properly construed, as Justice Breyer has suggested, to allow joinder as a necessary party."
2004.03-1566,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1539.51,1545.455,"Then... then how do you explain the last... the last sentence of that provision, which is any suit pursuant to this section?"
2004.03-1566,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1553.832,1554.742,"--Yes, and--"
2004.03-1566,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1554.742,1561.884,"And... and the last sentence says, any suit pursuant to this section may be brought in any United States district court."
2004.03-1566,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1571.05,1576.556,"--Your Honor, we read that as allowing removal in those circumstances when the United States is joined later."
2004.03-1566,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1602.934,1625.597,"Mr. Minear, when you say... when you say not money damages, do you read the words that I read to Mr. Smiland restrictively or do you think they accommodate money damages, that is, suit to adjudicate, confirm, validate, or decree the contractual rights of a contracting entity?"
2004.03-1566,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1625.597,1631.791,"We think that under your cases, such as Pena v. Lane, there needs to be a specific reference to money damages."
2004.03-1566,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1650.488,1654.537,So money damages... waiver always used the word money damages.
2004.03-1566,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1659.199,1661.817,"--No, I do not think in this context it would."
2004.03-1566,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1673.856,1675.009,What about the second sentence?
2004.03-1566,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1703.616,1709.932,"Your Honor, I think that simply refers back to the previous sentence, which refers to adjudicate, confirm, validate, or decree."
2004.03-1566,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1728.014,1732.594,"Yes, but if contractual rights include a right to be paid for something, why wouldn't you get a money judgment in a case like that?"
2004.03-1566,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1738.045,1742.419,"Your Honor, again, waivers of sovereign immunity are construed narrowly."
2004.03-1566,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1742.669,1743.905,That's pretty clear language.
2004.03-1566,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1743.905,1749.478,"--I have to say that the language... you're saying that the language... yes, could it conceivably be... be interpreted in... on... that broadly."
2004.03-1566,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1750.471,1755.051,"Certainly if it were not a... a United States and were a private individual, it would include money damages."
2004.03-1566,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1755.051,1756.62,"--That might well be, but this is--"
2004.03-1566,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1756.62,1761.244,"And... and the next sentence, as Justice Scalia points out, says the United States shall be treated just like a private party."
2004.03-1566,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1761.244,1761.783,--Yes.
2004.03-1566,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1771.481,1782.521,"Well, I think you've got a very strong argument when you talk about an incidental third party beneficiary not being a contracting party, but now you're asking for a much broader holding than really necessary to dispose of this case, it seems to me."
2004.03-1566,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1782.521,1790.8,"--Your Honor, I think I started with that point, that an incidental beneficiary cannot invoke this... this provision."
2004.03-1566,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1835.011,1838.726,Separate from... where does that... that obligation come from?
2004.03-1566,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1838.726,1848.097,That arises from the regulations that the Westlands Water District has enacted that provides for the delivery of water from Westlands to the individual farmers.
2004.03-1566,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1849.666,1851.812,That's a State... a State-created obligation?
2004.03-1566,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1851.812,1852.267,--That's right.
2004.03-1566,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1933.608,1944.261,"Well, you don't take the position, do you, that Westlands could have agreed with the United States that it wouldn't enforce its new laws that deprived the farmers of water?"
2004.03-1566,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1947.066,1949.666,"--But let's look at what would happen, Your Honor, if that did happen."
2004.03-1566,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1969.661,1977.613,"Yes, but you can't... the... presumably the Federal Government can't negotiate away the Endangered Species Act or something."
2004.03-1566,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1984.673,1985.416,That's correct.
2004.03-1566,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2019.595,2022.113,Can the district get damages from the Government?
2004.03-1566,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2022.113,2028.595,"--Technically yes, but their damages are limited by the terms of the contract."
2004.03-1566,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2175.14,2177.202,"Thank you, Mr. Minear."
2004.03-1566,2,41993,stuart_l_somach,,2184.633,2186.407,"Yes, Your Honor."
2004.03-1566,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2246.965,2247.996,Excuse me.
2004.03-1566,2,41993,stuart_l_somach,,2256.048,2256.436,--No.
2004.03-1566,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2351.279,2353.302,Can't... can't such a suit be brought in State court?
2004.03-1566,2,41993,stuart_l_somach,,2356.292,2356.663,"Oh, absolutely not."
2004.03-1566,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2358.049,2359.164,Really?
2004.03-1566,2,41993,stuart_l_somach,,2359.164,2359.618,No.
2004.03-1566,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2361.476,2362.136,Okay.
2004.03-1566,2,41993,stuart_l_somach,,2362.136,2363.705,And absolutely not.
2004.03-1566,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2574.029,2579.147,I don't really understand why that's any greater burden than the fact they can sue you in State court anyway.
2004.03-1566,2,41993,stuart_l_somach,,2580.922,2598.549,"--Well, it... it really requires the district to, in a sense, race to the courthouse with the... with the petitioners in order to be there first in order to have its views of the contract--"
2004.03-1566,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2598.549,2610.316,"Well, the suit in State court, I assume, would... would only be... the claim would be that you were acting arbitrarily, and so long as your interpretation of the contract was a reasonable one, the suit would fail."
2004.03-1566,2,41993,stuart_l_somach,,2610.316,2611.059,--Yes.
2004.03-1566,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2611.059,2613.864,"Whereas, this suit here... it doesn't matter how reasonable it is."
2004.03-1566,2,41993,stuart_l_somach,,2616.648,2618.034,No.
2004.03-1566,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2750.174,2761.895,"What about the provision in the judgment at page 110 that was... that was cited to us, that... that the parties may obtain other appropriate relief by the filing of a new action?"
2004.03-1566,2,41993,stuart_l_somach,,2761.895,2762.638,Yes.
2004.03-1566,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2803.051,2803.672,"Thank you, Mr. Somach."
2004.03-1566,3,46199,william_m_smiland,,2809.467,2810.582,"Thank you, Your Honor."
2004.03-1566,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2831.099,2831.266,"Well, you say under the contract."
2004.03-1566,3,46199,william_m_smiland,,2846.126,2849.098,"Well, that's what we were about to go to trial on, Your Honor."
2004.03-1566,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2866.393,2872.876,But you were saying there's... there's a right under this contract to recover from the United States for an under delivery.
2004.03-1566,3,46199,william_m_smiland,,2872.876,2885.507,We have massive cross summary judgment motions on that issue and we were entitled to go to trial on that... on our claim of liability.
2004.03-1566,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2885.507,2886.083,What--
2004.03-1566,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2886.083,2886.455,If--
2004.03-1566,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2886.455,2887.448,"--No, please."
2004.03-1566,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2887.448,2887.531,--No.
2004.03-1566,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2888.812,2890.836,What do you make... excuse me.
2004.03-1566,3,46199,william_m_smiland,,2899.297,2901.626,I... I don't make much of it.
2004.03-1566,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2925.525,2936.366,"Is... is it correct, as Justice Scalia suggested earlier, that so far as State litigation is concerned, it would be limited simply to arbitrary, unreasonable behavior?"
2004.03-1566,3,46199,william_m_smiland,,2936.366,2936.82,That's true.
2004.03-1566,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2948.255,2963.941,"Well, I think it's arbitrary not to... not to... for an agency, of which you're... you're in some sense at least the beneficiary, not to insist upon its contract rights, just as a shareholder can insist that the... that a corporation enforce its contracts."
2004.03-1566,3,46199,william_m_smiland,,2963.941,2972.115,"We had a little mini trial on that in front of the... in front of the district court, and... and I made that argument, Your Honor, and the district court rejected it."
2004.03-1566,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2972.115,2972.858,"No, he was wrong."
2004.03-1566,3,46199,william_m_smiland,,2974.139,2974.799,I agree.
2004.03-1566,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2974.799,2983.837,I guess the reason that you would sue the district would be if you didn't have any enforceable promise from the United States that they didn't... wouldn't do it.
2004.03-1566,3,46199,william_m_smiland,,2983.837,2984.459,"Well, we... we--"
2004.03-1566,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2984.459,2986.028,"Now, you think you do."
2004.03-1566,3,46199,william_m_smiland,,2987.226,2988.796,--We had a stipulated judgment.
2004.03-1566,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2988.796,2991.851,"And so therefore... therefore, I'm looking for where that promise is."

2004.03-1566,3,46199,william_m_smiland,,3024.955,3026.152,If the contract--
2004.03-1566,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3026.152,3027.267,And then she can enforce the contract?
2004.03-1566,3,46199,william_m_smiland,,3027.267,3028.548,--If the contract says--
2004.03-1566,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3028.548,3029.041,Yes.

2004.03-1566,3,46199,william_m_smiland,,3040.065,3040.641,That's true.
2004.03-1566,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3040.641,3041.18,--which doesn't.
