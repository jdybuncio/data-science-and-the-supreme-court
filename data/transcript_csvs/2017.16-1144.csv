2017.16-1144,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.64,"We'll hear argument next in Case 16-1144, Marinello versus United States. Mr. Hellman."
2017.16-1144,0,62300,matthew_s_hellman,,7.64,48.4,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: When Congress made it a felony to obstruct the due administration of the tax code, it was not creating an all-purpose tax crime; it was borrowing from a statute that prohibited the obstruction of a pending proceeding. This Court normally presumes that borrowed language carries its meaning with it. And that has to be the case here, for without that limitation, obstruction would swallow up the other crimes that Congress simultaneously enacted and, in particular, it would obliterate the careful line that Congress drew between misdemeanors and felonies. Indeed, the government's interpretation is so broad that it would chill entirely legitimate conduct that Congress never intended to penalize."
2017.16-1144,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,48.4,55.24,What -- what -- what lawful conduct would the government's reading put at risk?
2017.16-1144,0,62300,matthew_s_hellman,,55.24,55.96,Certainly.
2017.16-1144,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,148.64,151.76,My problem is that I have -- a second question.
2017.16-1144,0,62300,matthew_s_hellman,,151.76,152.56,Sure.
2017.16-1144,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,152.56,183.68,"I have a lot of hypotheticals under your definition of what this section means that wouldn't be covered. So how about if an individual knows that the IRS is in the presence of -- press -- in the process of assessing his taxes and he in some way obstructs that process, or an agent -- the agent in 2004 called the defendant and said: You know, I'm deciding whether to open an investigation."
2017.16-1144,0,62300,matthew_s_hellman,,212.32,214.16,It would be several other crimes.
2017.16-1144,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,244.8,247.6,"Well, wait a minute, yes, it can do that sometimes."
2017.16-1144,0,62300,matthew_s_hellman,,247.6,248.64,It can do that.
2017.16-1144,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,248.64,249.92,It doesn't other times.
2017.16-1144,0,62300,matthew_s_hellman,,249.92,251.44,It doesn't other times. And --
2017.16-1144,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,251.44,253.24,So is this one of those other times?
2017.16-1144,0,62300,matthew_s_hellman,,253.24,264.88,"Well, I think the -- the right way to understand it is Congress is -- the ""need not be pending"" language was a product of a 1980s revision to the statute and really started to apply to documents in Sarbanes-Oxley."
2017.16-1144,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,264.88,284.64,"Do you think the word ""administration"" -- ""due administration of this title,"" does any work in the interpretation? It seems to me that one could say that the example I gave is an actual affirmative act by the agency."
2017.16-1144,0,62300,matthew_s_hellman,,312.88,317.32,"I don't -- that's certainly not the line the government is offering, but -- but --"
2017.16-1144,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,317.32,319.2,It's not the line the government's offering --
2017.16-1144,0,62300,matthew_s_hellman,,319.2,319.44,Is offering.
2017.16-1144,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,319.44,333.72,-- but yours is -- your broadness is sweeping up a lot of conduct that I think could be perceived as active obstruction of the work of -- the direct work of the agency.
2017.16-1144,0,62300,matthew_s_hellman,,336.28,338.2,"Well, a couple responses."
2017.16-1144,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,434.36,434.92,"Mr. Hellman, I --"
2017.16-1144,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,434.92,435.32,Do you suggest --
2017.16-1144,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,435.32,436.16,I'm sorry.
2017.16-1144,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,436.16,440.88,You -- you raised that specter in -- in your brief.
2017.16-1144,0,62300,matthew_s_hellman,,452.6,453.28,"Yes, Your Honor."
2017.16-1144,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,489.28,491.2,"Well, suppose -- to go to your first example."
2017.16-1144,0,62300,matthew_s_hellman,,491.2,491.72,Please.
2017.16-1144,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,491.72,493.72,I just often wondered this.
2017.16-1144,0,62300,matthew_s_hellman,,495.64,496.28,Yes.
2017.16-1144,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,496.28,500.76,"Well, suppose you hire somebody to shovel your snow off your steps --"
2017.16-1144,0,62300,matthew_s_hellman,,500.76,501.24,Sure.
2017.16-1144,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,501.24,508.16,"-- every three weeks or so or every week or -- and the gardener does some gardening, burns some leaves, and you pay him more than $600 over the year."
2017.16-1144,0,62300,matthew_s_hellman,,508.16,508.72,Right.
2017.16-1144,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,508.72,512.24,Then I guess you're required to file a 1099 for them.
2017.16-1144,0,62300,matthew_s_hellman,,512.24,513.32,"That's right, which is they --"
2017.16-1144,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,513.32,514.64,I know -- I don't know people who do.
2017.16-1144,0,62300,matthew_s_hellman,,533.12,534.04,"Yes, that -- that is correct."
2017.16-1144,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,534.04,538.24,If they know of this requirement and if they want to help the gardener or whatever.
2017.16-1144,0,62300,matthew_s_hellman,,538.24,538.72,That's correct.
2017.16-1144,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,539.4,540.64,"And that is right, you're sure that's right?"
2017.16-1144,0,62300,matthew_s_hellman,,540.64,542.0,"I -- I -- yes, that is correct --"
2017.16-1144,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,542.0,542.24,All right.
2017.16-1144,0,62300,matthew_s_hellman,,542.24,545.96,-- because it comes down to -- to the mens rea of the -- of the person who's filling out that form.
2017.16-1144,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,545.96,549.28,"Well, they want to help the gardener and they know about it."
2017.16-1144,0,62300,matthew_s_hellman,,549.28,550.24,That's right.
2017.16-1144,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,551.12,595.76,"Well, Mr. Hellman, I -- I mean, I share the -- your -- your concern that if this statute is read in its broadest possible literal sense, it has a really staggering sweep, but I wonder if your interpretation really solves the problem because can't the same sorts of things happen after a proceeding has commenced? Let's say somebody is being audited and eventually the person comes up with the records that the auditor needs, but they're all scrambled up, and it looks like -- and -- and the person is -- is late in providing them and misses meetings and just is very difficult. You could get the same situation there, couldn't you?"
2017.16-1144,0,62300,matthew_s_hellman,,595.76,618.8,"I suppose you could, but there's a difference as to why I think the statute ought to tolerate prosecution in that scenario, which is where there's been a formal notice of audit and someone has been given questions by the government and needs to respond in a reasonable manner to them. You can understand why Congress wanted to make that a crime distinct from, maybe on top of, other crimes that a person has committed."
2017.16-1144,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,649.4,649.72,Mr. --
2017.16-1144,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,649.72,654.84,"Mr. Hellman, there are obvious reasons to search for a limiting interpretation here."
2017.16-1144,0,62300,matthew_s_hellman,,654.84,655.68,Yes.
2017.16-1144,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,655.68,668.6,"I guess the question is why your limiting interpretation? And obviously you talked about this in your brief. But I just want to give you an opportunity now to try to convince me, because right now I feel as though it comes out of thin air."
2017.16-1144,0,62300,matthew_s_hellman,,678.08,679.84,Absolutely.
2017.16-1144,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,750.64,757.4,But wasn't there the predecessor of 1503? It was oriented toward courts.
2017.16-1144,0,62300,matthew_s_hellman,,757.4,764.44,"It -- it was expressly -- said, obstruction in a court, in effect, that's correct."
2017.16-1144,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,848.76,855.72,"You think a lot of people do that? I mean, you've got three children and they say they've got five?"
2017.16-1144,0,62300,matthew_s_hellman,,855.72,857.96,"In my experience -- well, in any case --"
2017.16-1144,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,857.96,859.48,"Well, your experience because -- (Laughter.)"
2017.16-1144,0,62300,matthew_s_hellman,,859.48,862.04,-- experience -- I -- I was responding to Justice --
2017.16-1144,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,862.04,864.0,"I mean, people who get caught come to you."
2017.16-1144,0,62300,matthew_s_hellman,,865.88,866.16,Right.
2017.16-1144,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,868.72,873.88,"Yeah, there are people who list their dogs as dependents."
2017.16-1144,0,62300,matthew_s_hellman,,873.88,878.24,"Well, I'll defer to Justice Ginsburg on that. (Laughter.)"
2017.16-1144,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,878.24,881.76,I wasn't thinking of those people.
2017.16-1144,0,62300,matthew_s_hellman,,906.76,908.64,And I do believe that it is one.
2017.16-1144,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,908.64,911.84,"Well, Mr. Hellman, what role should lenity play here, if any?"
2017.16-1144,0,62300,matthew_s_hellman,,911.84,929.24,"Well, I think this Court's decisions in Aguilar and Arthur Andersen sort of point the way in that direction. We haven't made a constitutional argument in this case that it would be unlawful, unconstitutional for Congress to write a statute, the statute that the government says they wrote here."
2017.16-1144,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,929.68,931.08,Saving that for the next case.
2017.16-1144,0,62300,matthew_s_hellman,,931.08,932.88,We'll save that for the next case.
2017.16-1144,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,952.68,958.68,"But how did they in Aguilar? I mean, I took -- I read the language in Aguilar and I thought it was very helpful to your case."
2017.16-1144,0,62300,matthew_s_hellman,,960.2,960.92,Yes.
2017.16-1144,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,960.92,964.4,"-- virtually, except administration of justice instead of administration of this title."
2017.16-1144,0,62300,matthew_s_hellman,,964.4,964.72,Correct.
2017.16-1144,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,964.72,968.28,And then it's quite limited how they interpreted it.
2017.16-1144,0,62300,matthew_s_hellman,,973.6,973.88,Yes.
2017.16-1144,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,973.88,976.16,"-- but a nexus to what? I mean, and -- and --"
2017.16-1144,0,62300,matthew_s_hellman,,976.16,976.56,Sure.
2017.16-1144,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,976.56,977.96,-- what's your understanding of that?
2017.16-1144,0,62300,matthew_s_hellman,,977.96,982.68,"So, as I read Aguilar, it's a nexus to a pending proceeding."
2017.16-1144,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,996.8,1012.24,"So your argument is nexus to a pending proceeding, interpreted with the same language except it says administration of justice should lead us to say nexus to a pending proceeding in a statute that's identical, but the words are administration of this title."
2017.16-1144,0,62300,matthew_s_hellman,,1012.24,1012.4,Yes.
2017.16-1144,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1012.4,1013.32,Is that the argument?
2017.16-1144,0,62300,matthew_s_hellman,,1013.32,1014.16,That is.
2017.16-1144,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1014.16,1014.68,All right.
2017.16-1144,0,62300,matthew_s_hellman,,1014.68,1042.4,"And, again, to respond to Justice Gorsuch's question, the Court has proceeded carefully with lenity in mind when it -- when it's looked at a statute that the government has said covers everything that one might want to punish, but doesn't clearly say that that is what we intend to punish, and both considerations of fair notice and, as the Court put it, deference to the prerogatives of Congress suggests that a more narrow interpretation is called for."
2017.16-1144,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1042.4,1047.68,"Well, is that what lenity means? This -- for sure this is a broad statute."
2017.16-1144,0,62300,matthew_s_hellman,,1047.68,1047.96,Yes.
2017.16-1144,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1047.96,1051.52,It doesn't seem very ambiguous.
2017.16-1144,0,62300,matthew_s_hellman,,1067.84,1085.2,"I understand the Court's lenity doctrine to say that once you apply the normal tools of statutory interpretation, if you're really left with good arguments on both sides, there's real ambiguity, important ambiguity. In a criminal case, you go with the less harsh interpretation."
2017.16-1144,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1085.48,1094.36,"So -- so, for example, if we are left with some ambiguity as to your Aguilar analogy, that's when you would suggest perhaps lenity might be a tiebreaker?"
2017.16-1144,0,62300,matthew_s_hellman,,1094.36,1097.4,"Yes -- yes, I do."
2017.16-1144,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1159.56,1168.08,There -- there is something to be done about the context that this was drafted in.
2017.16-1144,0,62300,matthew_s_hellman,,1170.64,1171.36,Yes.
2017.16-1144,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1171.36,1187.2,"-- ""Whoever corruptly or by force or threats of force (including any threatening letter or communication) endeavors to intimidate or impede any officer or employee of the U.S. acting in an official capacity"" --"
2017.16-1144,0,62300,matthew_s_hellman,,1187.2,1188.84,Yes.
2017.16-1144,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1188.84,1221.44,"-- ""... or in any way corruptly or by force or threat of force, (including any threatening letter or communication) obstructs or impedes, or endeavors to obstruct or impede, the due administration of this title."" All of that seems to be geared towards some affirmative act aimed at an agent or the agency. That's where I got my earlier --"
2017.16-1144,0,62300,matthew_s_hellman,,1221.44,1221.96,Yes.
2017.16-1144,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1221.96,1224.72,-- differentiation between --
2017.16-1144,0,62300,matthew_s_hellman,,1224.72,1225.04,Yes.
2017.16-1144,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1225.04,1242.52,"-- a affirmative act and an omission act because that doesn't have the flavor of force or threat of force or threatening, all of the sort of active, violent or active, obstructive --"
2017.16-1144,0,62300,matthew_s_hellman,,1242.52,1242.76,Right.
2017.16-1144,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1242.76,1246.56,-- behavior that the examples set forth.
2017.16-1144,0,62300,matthew_s_hellman,,1246.56,1248.84,I think I understand your question better now.
2017.16-1144,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1312.2,1322.68,"Well, does it get us part of the way there, though? Because the officer clause, as Justice Sotomayor suggests, you have to actually hinder something the officer is doing."
2017.16-1144,0,62300,matthew_s_hellman,,1347.8,1348.04,Yes.
2017.16-1144,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1348.36,1356.72,"-- of tax liabilities, that there's an implication from the officers clause that there's something more going on."
2017.16-1144,0,62300,matthew_s_hellman,,1358.4,1369.52,"Well, what I would say is if -- if the thought is by limiting obstruction to any affirmative act that hinders the IRS in any way, you have not brought the statute --"
2017.16-1144,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1369.52,1370.72,"No, no, no."
2017.16-1144,0,62300,matthew_s_hellman,,1383.96,1388.48,"Well, and, of course, all of the conduct or omissions in this case are not in that context."
2017.16-1144,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1388.48,1389.4,Correct.
2017.16-1144,0,62300,matthew_s_hellman,,1389.4,1389.84,So --
2017.16-1144,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1389.84,1391.8,It's -- it's a friendly amendment. (Laughter.)
2017.16-1144,0,62300,matthew_s_hellman,,1391.8,1401.32,"Then that's not the rule we have adopted or endorsed to the Court, but -- and, again, you would have some other --"
2017.16-1144,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1401.32,1403.68,I have difficulty getting to what you have --
2017.16-1144,0,62300,matthew_s_hellman,,1403.68,1404.0,Right.
2017.16-1144,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1404.0,1413.2,"-- because you haven't, as Justice Kagan pointed out, given us anything in the language to anchor this in."
2017.16-1144,0,62300,matthew_s_hellman,,1414.16,1414.84,Right.
2017.16-1144,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1414.84,1421.08,-- Justice -- it appears Justice Gorsuch and I are trying to look at the language.
2017.16-1144,0,62300,matthew_s_hellman,,1421.08,1431.2,So what I would say in response to that is we would accept -- because there is no act in question here that falls within that rule.
2017.16-1144,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1440.0,1442.12,A win is a win is a win.
2017.16-1144,0,62300,matthew_s_hellman,,1442.12,1457.48,"A win is a win, for certain, but I just want to be -- be certain that the Court fully appreciates that the line between when the IRS is doing something and not doing something at times can be a little bit blurry."
2017.16-1144,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1466.96,1471.68,You just helped the government a lot with that statement.
2017.16-1144,0,62300,matthew_s_hellman,,1471.68,1476.0,I hope I did not. (Laughter.)
2017.16-1144,0,62300,matthew_s_hellman,,1476.0,1492.4,"The -- our submission to this Court is that the government's interpretation in this case cannot be correct. We have offered language that comes directly from a predecessor statute dealing with proceedings, but I understand the Court's point that you might define proceedings a little more broadly than we do --"
2017.16-1144,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1492.4,1493.44,I'm not even arguing with you.
2017.16-1144,0,62300,matthew_s_hellman,,1493.44,1493.6,Yeah.
2017.16-1144,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1493.6,1498.0,I'm just suggesting that the officers clause might be a source of some aid to you.
2017.16-1144,0,62300,matthew_s_hellman,,1498.0,1498.72,Agreed.
2017.16-1144,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1498.72,1499.76,That's all I'm doing.
2017.16-1144,0,62300,matthew_s_hellman,,1499.76,1539.24,"Absolutely agreed. Absolutely agreed. Now, the other part I wanted to make sure I -- I said before I sat down was the government's interpretation in this case, although they push it now, is not one that they had invoked for nearly 30 years after the statute was enacted. Although they claim it's -- there is no ambiguity, there is no need for lenity, this is a -- an interpretation that really came into fruition in the '90s, and with increasing frequency in -- in many, many cases, this is now being charged. And if the Court has no further questions, I will reserve the rest of my time for rebuttal."
2017.16-1144,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1540.2,1548.08,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Parker."
2017.16-1144,1,62835,robert_a_parker,,1548.08,1559.56,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I'd like at the very outset to address several of the things that my friend just said. He -- he suggested that entirely lawful conduct would come within this statute."
2017.16-1144,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1570.68,1579.04,"So how about the one example he does give? People go into shelters thinking they might be legal, might not."
2017.16-1144,1,62835,robert_a_parker,,1584.64,1587.32,I -- I don't believe so --
2017.16-1144,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1587.32,1587.48,Why?
2017.16-1144,1,62835,robert_a_parker,,1587.48,1591.84,-- because there is not the specific intent to obtain an unlawful advantage.
2017.16-1144,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1601.04,1617.04,"Well, Justice -- Justice Breyer's snow shoveler, all right, I -- I think you -- he's a felon under your interpretation because the -- the person who's paying him knows that, above $600 or whatever it is, I have to file a 1099."
2017.16-1144,1,62835,robert_a_parker,,1624.72,1625.6,Well --
2017.16-1144,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1625.6,1629.0,For my -- for my friend's son's snow shoveling business.
2017.16-1144,1,62835,robert_a_parker,,1629.0,1629.68,"Well, I --"
2017.16-1144,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1629.68,1630.04,Right?
2017.16-1144,1,62835,robert_a_parker,,1630.04,1631.52,I think that that --
2017.16-1144,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1631.52,1633.24,"I mean, the answer is yes, I think, isn't it? (Laughter.)"
2017.16-1144,1,62835,robert_a_parker,,1633.24,1636.4,That -- that circumstance may come within the scope of the statute.
2017.16-1144,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1636.4,1637.44,I'm waiting for a yes or a no.
2017.16-1144,1,62835,robert_a_parker,,1639.12,1639.8,Yes.
2017.16-1144,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1640.88,1641.48,Okay.
2017.16-1144,1,62835,robert_a_parker,,1641.56,1644.28,I think it -- it bears explanation as to why.
2017.16-1144,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1647.04,1649.68,"Well, the reg I saw said 600."
2017.16-1144,1,62835,robert_a_parker,,1649.68,1655.16,"But -- well, but that's if you're a business employing an independent contractor, so an -- an individual."
2017.16-1144,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1659.72,1665.8,How -- how is somebody supposed to know when they're going to be in trouble here? Because it seems like paying cash --
2017.16-1144,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1665.8,1666.32,Uh-huh.
2017.16-1144,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1666.32,1669.24,-- can sometimes be a problem.
2017.16-1144,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1675.32,1675.6,Right.
2017.16-1144,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1675.6,1678.96,-- that you didn't -- that aren't lawfully obliged to be kept.
2017.16-1144,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1678.96,1685.0,"You realize everybody in this audience now knows about the 1099 form, right? (Laughter.)"
2017.16-1144,1,62835,robert_a_parker,,1685.0,1687.48,"Well, they -- they may be kept out of trouble as a result."
2017.16-1144,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1700.44,1705.96,"The government made some similar arguments in the honest services case, that everything can be cured by a mens rea requirement."
2017.16-1144,1,62835,robert_a_parker,,1736.24,1748.76,"I -- I disagree with that, Justice Gorsuch, and I'd like to just take a moment to explain why. So there are a number of limiting features of this statute that provide protection against precisely what you are explaining."
2017.16-1144,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1759.28,1761.76,"And paying cash is enough, though, under the government --"
2017.16-1144,1,62835,robert_a_parker,,1761.76,1762.56,"No, not necessarily."
2017.16-1144,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1762.56,1763.88,"Well, it is in this case."
2017.16-1144,1,62835,robert_a_parker,,1763.88,1764.52,"Actually, no."
2017.16-1144,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1765.68,1766.96,That's -- that's in the jury instructions.
2017.16-1144,1,62835,robert_a_parker,,1766.96,1771.68,The -- the -- paying cash was one of the means of the obstructive endeavor.
2017.16-1144,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1771.68,1772.28,Right.
2017.16-1144,1,62835,robert_a_parker,,1772.28,1776.96,It was a -- a factual way that the individual was engaging in obstructive conduct.
2017.16-1144,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1792.8,1795.96,"But before you go on, what do you do with the term ""impede""?"
2017.16-1144,1,62835,robert_a_parker,,1795.96,1801.72,"Well, I -- I think that the term ""impede"" is largely coextensive with the term ""obstruct."" In fact --"
2017.16-1144,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1801.72,1803.72,"Well, I don't know whether it is."
2017.16-1144,1,62835,robert_a_parker,,1817.6,1823.36,"I -- I -- well, I would disagree with the statement that anything that makes the work of the IRS more difficult."
2017.16-1144,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1825.68,1827.84,Why? Why? Why do you disagree with that? On what basis?
2017.16-1144,1,62835,robert_a_parker,,1827.84,1831.52,So -- so you have -- you have to have the natural tendency to obstruct. You then have to have proof.
2017.16-1144,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1831.52,1833.52,You have the mens rea. What do you have besides the mens rea?
2017.16-1144,1,62835,robert_a_parker,,1833.52,1840.12,"Well, you -- you then have to be acting corruptly, which means that you have to have the specific intent to obtain an unlawful advantage."
2017.16-1144,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1840.12,1842.72,That's the mens rea. What do you have besides the mens rea?
2017.16-1144,1,62835,robert_a_parker,,1842.72,1881.8,"Let's -- so let's say that you are engaged in lawful conduct, you're paying people in cash, or you have structured your corporate form in a way that may make it more complicated for the IRS to figure out what your income and expenses are. Those things do not have a natural tendency to obstruct in and of themselves because there is nothing that says that the administration of the code has to be made maximally easy. The only reason that those would end up having a -- an obstructive effect is if you pair them with efforts to mislead or deceive the IRS into believing that the situation is not as it appears for an unlawful advantage. So in the --"
2017.16-1144,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1881.8,1888.76,"Well, where does this come from in the language of the statute? I mean, this -- that's what troubles me about this."
2017.16-1144,1,62835,robert_a_parker,,1916.64,1920.32,I'm not sure actually that it is all that thin.
2017.16-1144,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1938.48,1953.88,"Well, let me just give you a variation of the hypothetical that's already been given. So somebody -- somebody offers to clean my gutters, and he says $100 cash, $125 if you pay me by check."
2017.16-1144,1,62835,robert_a_parker,,1958.8,1959.88,"No, not at all."
2017.16-1144,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1959.88,1960.8,Why -- why not?
2017.16-1144,1,62835,robert_a_parker,,1960.8,1962.64,"Well, because there -- there is no --"
2017.16-1144,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1962.64,1971.84,"What if I -- what if I -- you know, I understand why he's going to give me the discount by paying by cash, because he doesn't want to report it."
2017.16-1144,1,62835,robert_a_parker,,1971.84,1978.52,"Well, again, I think that you would then have to pair that with other efforts to deceive the IRS, as you did here."
2017.16-1144,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1979.28,1982.08,Why? Why isn't that sufficient in itself?
2017.16-1144,1,62835,robert_a_parker,,1982.08,1987.6,Because there's no natural tendency of the mere fact that you give him $100 in cash to obstruct anything.
2017.16-1144,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1995.24,1998.48,"I know he's not going to report, and he doesn't report."
2017.16-1144,1,62835,robert_a_parker,,1998.48,2017.16,"Well, I think that if -- if you actually have the -- the subjective specific intent that you are giving him this money with the intent that he is not going to report it to the IRS, and you are engaged in a common endeavor to -- to obstruct the IRS's ability to duly administer the code, I think --"
2017.16-1144,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2017.16,2026.96,"But doesn't everybody know -- doesn't everybody know when they're given an offer like this, you know, I'd rather have cash than a check, doesn't everybody know why people would rather have cash than a check?"
2017.16-1144,1,62835,robert_a_parker,,2026.96,2038.0,"Well, that may be true, but, again, I -- this is I think precisely why these sorts of things, A, are -- are not charged under this statute but, B, I think would be incredibly difficult to charge under this statute."
2017.16-1144,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2038.0,2052.44,"Why? Why? I mean, that's -- you have used several times the words ""specific intent."" So is it the -- specific intent to me in the law means knowledge that the particular action is unlawful."
2017.16-1144,1,62835,robert_a_parker,,2052.44,2053.2,Uh-huh.
2017.16-1144,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2053.2,2091.36,"So are you saying the government's position is we cannot under this statute prosecute any person for anything he does unless that person knows that what he is doing, such as giving money to a person in cash, will be used to provide a benefit to that person that is unlawful, he knows that doing this, what he is doing, is unlawful, and unless he knows that, the statute does not permit prosecution?"
2017.16-1144,1,62835,robert_a_parker,,2091.36,2093.48,I -- I think that that is accurate.
2017.16-1144,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2094.16,2095.6,"No, don't think it's accurate."
2017.16-1144,1,62835,robert_a_parker,,2124.12,2124.72,"Well, he has --"
2017.16-1144,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2124.72,2129.56,"If he does not know both of those things, he cannot be prosecuted under this statute."
2017.16-1144,1,62835,robert_a_parker,,2138.32,2138.96,Yes.
2017.16-1144,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2140.08,2145.2,"Yes, the answer is the position of the United States is what I just said is correct."
2017.16-1144,1,62835,robert_a_parker,,2148.36,2152.48,"Both of those things, I think, are -- are entirely subsumed by the definition of corruptly."
2017.16-1144,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2153.84,2154.04,All right.
2017.16-1144,1,62835,robert_a_parker,,2155.72,2156.08,Yes.
2017.16-1144,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2156.88,2157.96,The answer is yes. Okay.
2017.16-1144,1,62835,robert_a_parker,,2159.16,2159.52,Certainly.
2017.16-1144,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2159.72,2194.28,"Well, may I ask you another question about this statute? The charge is that it would make any tax crime a misdemeanor, felony, you could tack this obstruction charge onto any tax crime in the code and then you just get an additional penalty. Is that so? Let's say -- well, let's take tax evasion, tax fraud."
2017.16-1144,1,62835,robert_a_parker,,2199.08,2216.84,"Tax evasion may because there you are willfully attempting to obtain -- to evade a tax deficiency, although the -- the -- if you can prove tax evasion, there's little reason to prove obstruction. However, all of the other ones, the answer is no."
2017.16-1144,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2236.2,2239.76,Is that the only difference; it's just the mens rea difference?
2017.16-1144,1,62835,robert_a_parker,,2239.76,2244.84,"Well, I think that's -- yes, I mean, you also must have a natural tendency to obstruct."
2017.16-1144,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2271.88,2272.92,Like what? Like what?
2017.16-1144,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2272.92,2273.12,Well --
2017.16-1144,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2273.12,2273.16,Really?
2017.16-1144,1,62835,robert_a_parker,,2273.16,2275.88,They may say sometimes I owe a small amount of tax.
2017.16-1144,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2279.12,2279.32,Why is --
2017.16-1144,1,62835,robert_a_parker,,2279.32,2291.48,"In that circumstance, there's no intent to obtain that unlawful advantage because you don't know whether you're going to be advantaged or not. I think the same thing could be said of, you know, failure to keep records."
2017.16-1144,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2306.2,2306.72,It is a -- it is a remarkable --
2017.16-1144,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2306.72,2316.2,"But you -- you understand the concern on the other side, I guess, which is, I think you used the word ""cantankerous"" in your brief, is that right, that some people are just cantankerous, and they're just not going to file."
2017.16-1144,1,62835,robert_a_parker,,2316.2,2316.4,Yes.
2017.16-1144,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2316.4,2331.44,Perhaps that's a fairly small number of people compared to the situation where it is not terribly difficult for an assistant U.S. attorney to prove that something was done corruptly as opposed to willfully.
2017.16-1144,1,62835,robert_a_parker,,2331.44,2332.44,"Well, I --"
2017.16-1144,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2332.44,2345.4,"It's kind of like the discussion we were having, that it is not hard to prove that paying in cash rather than a check when you get a discount was for a purpose to give a -- a lawful advantage."
2017.16-1144,1,62835,robert_a_parker,,2345.4,2345.84,"Well, I don't --"
2017.16-1144,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2345.84,2346.92,An unlawful advantage.
2017.16-1144,1,62835,robert_a_parker,,2346.92,2350.72,I would -- I'm not sure that it's correct to say that these are rare cases.
2017.16-1144,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2378.52,2379.96,Is it -- is it still -- 4 percent.
2017.16-1144,1,62835,robert_a_parker,,2387.04,2393.6,"I -- I believe that we, as a general matter, do seek out the most serious charge."
2017.16-1144,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2396.12,2400.16,I thought that there was new guidance saying exactly that in the last year.
2017.16-1144,1,62835,robert_a_parker,,2400.16,2401.44,Yes.
2017.16-1144,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2412.04,2412.12,Suppose we were --
2017.16-1144,1,62835,robert_a_parker,,2412.12,2413.48,-- because of all the limitations.
2017.16-1144,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2413.48,2430.04,Suppose we were to conclude that 80 percent of criminal tax misdemeanor violations could be accompanied by the felony charges contained within this statute. Would that be cause for our Court to be concerned?
2017.16-1144,1,62835,robert_a_parker,,2430.04,2433.88,"Well, I'm not sure that it would necessarily be cause for concern."
2017.16-1144,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2447.2,2447.6,You do not --
2017.16-1144,1,62835,robert_a_parker,,2447.6,2448.52,-- repeatedly said --
2017.16-1144,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2448.52,2460.36,You -- you do not think we should be concerned if 80 percent of tax misdemeanor violations can be increased to a felony under this statute? That's not a cause for concern?
2017.16-1144,1,62835,robert_a_parker,,2460.36,2462.28,"Well, again, I'm -- I'm not --"
2017.16-1144,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2462.28,2464.44,Yes -- yes or no.
2017.16-1144,1,62835,robert_a_parker,,2464.44,2473.8,"I don't think it is, only because Congress has specifically provided an interlocking web of criminal penalties in this area."
2017.16-1144,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2478.16,2478.96,The self --
2017.16-1144,1,62835,robert_a_parker,,2478.96,2481.56,-- that depends upon --
2017.16-1144,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2481.56,2496.76,"Just to be clear, it's not -- my line of questioning is not to suggest bad faith on the part of the -- of the Department, but instead to suggest that that concern may have motivated Congress -- should motivate a narrower understanding of what Congress intended in -- in this particular provision."
2017.16-1144,1,62835,robert_a_parker,,2496.76,2507.4,"Well, I -- I think that that's a fair point, Mr. Chief Justice, but I think that it does not motivate the adoption of the limiting construction that Petitioner is proposing. Remember, Petitioner's --"
2017.16-1144,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2507.4,2527.76,"On -- on that -- on that score, the verbs ""obstruct"" and ""impede,"" along with ""corruptly,"" the adverb, you normally expect there to be an object to them. I have to -- have to -- because it is specific intent, as Justice Breyer pointed out, and you've conceded. I have to know about some thing and I have to intend to obstruct or impede that thing."
2017.16-1144,1,62835,robert_a_parker,,2552.28,2557.0,"Well, respectfully, Justice Gorsuch, I don't think that that is what we were saying."
2017.16-1144,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2557.32,2558.16,I think that's out of --
2017.16-1144,1,62835,robert_a_parker,,2558.16,2558.6,We're not saying --
2017.16-1144,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2558.6,2559.76,"-- your brief in opposition, right?"
2017.16-1144,1,62835,robert_a_parker,,2559.76,2566.96,Those -- but those words refer to the understanding of individuals about the fact that tax administration occurs on a routine and predictable schedule.
2017.16-1144,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2566.96,2576.68,"But -- but don't those -- don't those verbs imply that there's something more direct as the object of my actions than -- than something that's continuous, ubiquitous, and universal?"
2017.16-1144,1,62835,robert_a_parker,,2576.68,2578.32,"Well, certainly I think that's true."
2017.16-1144,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2579.92,2580.16,Okay.
2017.16-1144,1,62835,robert_a_parker,,2581.24,2604.88,"-- specifically intending to obstruct the administration of the code. And the only point that we're making is that administration, unlike in the case of the due administration of justice, which involves discrete proceedings that many Americans will go their entire lives without having a connection to, the due administration of the Internal Revenue Code occurs on a routine and predictable schedule that people know is coming and can reasonably foresee."
2017.16-1144,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2604.88,2605.12,But you are --
2017.16-1144,1,62835,robert_a_parker,,2605.12,2605.92,I think there are --
2017.16-1144,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2605.92,2608.92,"-- if you want, I want this answer."
2017.16-1144,1,62835,robert_a_parker,,2713.96,2716.4,I think there are a number of reasons not to do that.
2017.16-1144,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2755.8,2758.84,But Congress legislates against the backdrop of what's out there.
2017.16-1144,1,62835,robert_a_parker,,2771.08,2771.72,Well --
2017.16-1144,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2771.72,2780.8,And -- and the Congress that passed this statute had that interpretation in its back pocket at the time; right?
2017.16-1144,1,62835,robert_a_parker,,2780.8,2812.04,"Well, I -- but I would disagree with that because in none of this Court's cases, in Pettibone, in Aguilar, Arthur Andersen, any of them did this Court ever suggest that it is the phrase ""due administration,"" not the phrase ""due administration of justice,"" that carries that connotation. And I would also note that if that is, in fact, what Congress intended, it is very strange because Congress had just a few years earlier enacted the statute that is now Section 1505, cited in our brief. And that statute was specifically enacted to do exactly what -- what you're suggesting, Justice Gorsuch."
2017.16-1144,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2846.84,2847.56,Mr. -- Mr. Parker --
2017.16-1144,1,62835,robert_a_parker,,2847.56,2848.92,-- does not solve these problems.
2017.16-1144,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2848.92,2891.36,"Can -- can I go back to the question of -- of -- of the Department's prosecution policy? And, you know I -- could you tell me, number 1, what the current state of the Department's guidance is as to whether prosecutors are -- are told to prosecute to the maximum extent allowed by law; and, number 2, whether that would mean in this case that here I am a prosecutor and I think that some action falls within 7212, that I would be precluded from proceeding instead under 7203 or 7205 or 7207."
2017.16-1144,1,62835,robert_a_parker,,2891.36,2928.12,"My understanding is it is certainly the Department's position as a general matter that prosecutors should be charging the most serious offense that is readily provable on those facts. I -- I -- I couldn't say whether in any given case that would mean that Section 7212 would have to be charged because, as I said before, the facts of each case are going to be different and they're going to make the ability to prove Section 7212 more or less possible. And there are going to be a number of cases where I think 7212 isn't even possible to -- even to allege."
2017.16-1144,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2931.36,2943.4,"Yes, but I guess what I was saying is that if a prosecutor could proceed under 7212, that the prosecutor is being instructed that she must proceed under that section."
2017.16-1144,1,62835,robert_a_parker,,2943.4,2973.44,"If -- if -- if the facts of that case render a 7212 charge readily provable, then, yes, I think that prosecutors would do that, but I -- I also think that that is not borne out by -- a concern that that is going to lead to just these sorts of charges becoming common and ubiquitous doesn't necessarily translate because, as I said, our understanding is that it's only about 4 percent of cases. And that includes the most recent data from this -- from this year."
2017.16-1144,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2974.12,2984.36,"Counsel, you used the phrase ""readily provable."" I just want to as a question of fact, is that -- is that the term that's used or is that your summary of what you understand?"
2017.16-1144,1,62835,robert_a_parker,,2984.36,2997.84,"I -- I don't exactly remember the term that is used, but certainly the government has to satisfy itself that it can prove beyond a reasonable doubt in that case that that crime has occurred. I -- I also, though, want to get back --"
2017.16-1144,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2997.84,3024.96,"Well, before you move off that point, why should we be comforted by the fact that prosecutorial discretion can be used in applying a statute, if this is a statute, with a really broad reach so that it reaches a lot of rather trivial conduct? Doesn't that make the situation worse rather than better? So then the prosecutors can decide where they want to use this."
2017.16-1144,1,62835,robert_a_parker,,3024.96,3026.72,I -- I don't think that it does.
2017.16-1144,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3050.0,3071.56,"May I ask you, this was, I think, brought up by the opposing side. It is about 7212(b). So the crime is rescuing seized property."
2017.16-1144,1,62835,robert_a_parker,,3095.88,3116.76,"I -- I suppose that if the government could prove that the person did so with corrupt intent, and I think that that's the main difference, obviously, between those two provisions, in addition to the different statutory penalties, if we could prove that, then I think that would be available. I'm not sure why the government would want to tack one on to the other."
2017.16-1144,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3125.72,3139.32,"Well, it would -- if -- if it is the highest penalty, it's three years under 7212(a) and only two years under 7212(b)."
2017.16-1144,1,62835,robert_a_parker,,3139.32,3139.8,Uh-huh.
2017.16-1144,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3139.8,3144.92,"So, with a maximum charging, why wouldn't the --"
2017.16-1144,1,62835,robert_a_parker,,3144.92,3190.0,"Well, because I think we would simply proceed under Section 7212(a), because that is the -- carries the higher potential penalty. I -- I would like to, in -- in the time I have remaining, just be sure to make two points. The first is the Petitioner's proposed limiting construction, as we've said, it doesn't come -- it doesn't have a basis in the text, but that doesn't mean that there aren't other potential limiting constructions that this Court could adopt, either in this case or in another appropriate case. I think, Justice Sotomayor, you alluded to the possibility of excluding pure omissions from -- from the scope of the statute to try to differentiate between the misdemeanor provisions and this one. The Court actually engaged in a very similar analysis in Spies."
2017.16-1144,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3323.12,3328.32,You gave the example of the omission that Justice Sotomayor brought up.
2017.16-1144,1,62835,robert_a_parker,,3336.2,3369.16,"Well, I think that -- I mean, I -- I don't mean to repeat myself, but I do think, Justice Ginsburg, that a rigorous enforcement of the mens rea requirement does that. And this Court has repeatedly said that in the obstruction context, rigorous enforcement of mens rea requirements is what separates individuals who do not have or have not committed culpable conduct from those who do. And I don't think that this obstruction provision -- may I conclude? I don't think this obstruction provision should be treated any differently. Thank you."
2017.16-1144,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3369.16,3372.76,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Hellman, four minutes remaining."

2017.16-1144,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3542.4,3546.4,"So, what is it? What do you derive from the officer clause?"
2017.16-1144,2,62300,matthew_s_hellman,,3546.4,3548.2,I -- I'm sorry?
2017.16-1144,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3548.2,3554.4,What -- what is the limit that you are now proposing?
2017.16-1144,2,62300,matthew_s_hellman,,3554.4,3581.04,"The limit that I am understanding Justice Sotomayor and Justice Gorsuch to be suggesting is, if you are -- if your obstructive act or omission is in the context with some interaction with the IRS, not, say, failing to talk to an accountant on your own time, not paying someone in cash in your own home, but in some interaction with the IRS, that could be a limitation; that would limit it. I think --"
2017.16-1144,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3581.04,3588.56,"An -- an interaction, although no audit, no proceeding is yet under way?"

2017.16-1144,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3603.0,3603.84,And you're suggest --
2017.16-1144,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3603.84,3608.32,And you think it's preferable given its heritage and for other reasons?
2017.16-1144,2,62300,matthew_s_hellman,,3608.32,3608.56,Yes.
2017.16-1144,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3609.0,3612.88,"If -- if so, I think you're suggesting work with the word in the statute, ""administration."" That's the word?"

2017.16-1144,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3614.04,3615.32,All right.
2017.16-1144,2,62300,matthew_s_hellman,,3624.72,3625.84,"Well, I think if you look at --"
