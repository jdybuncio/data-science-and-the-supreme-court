2009.08-1196,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,6.154,"We'll hear argument next in Case 08-1196, Weyhrauch v. United States."
2009.08-1196,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,7.004,33.304,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: When counsel for the United States defended the McNally prosecution before this Court in 1987, the first thing he did was to acknowledge that many of the existing intangible rights cases contained what he called ""extravagant"" language that, on its face, extended the doctrine far beyond the principle that one can be guilty of fraudulently denying others the performance of a clear legal duty that he owes."
2009.08-1196,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,89.224,99.93,"So if the -- there were a State law that said you must disclose anything that could reasonably be viewed as a conflict of interest, then -- then you would lose?"
2009.08-1196,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,99.93,104.65,"Your Honor, you are now asking me the question about the outer perimeter of the statute."
2009.08-1196,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,149.493,175.578,"I mean, the mail fraud statute carries a very heavy penalty, and are you -- you are arguing that Congress intended to impose this penalty on individuals who breach some Federal or State disclosure requirement, even if that is viewed by the body that is responsible for the disclosure requirement as a very minor thing."
2009.08-1196,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,175.578,179.713,"--Oh, I'm -- I'm -- Your Honor, if I left that impression, let me completely reject it."
2009.08-1196,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,206.18,207.363,But that's what you're asking us to do.
2009.08-1196,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,234.18,234.616,--Right.
2009.08-1196,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,234.616,235.199,--for legislators?
2009.08-1196,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,235.199,247.174,"Well, Your Honor, I -- let me -- I want to repeat again that -- that in -- in my view, our case doesn't turn on my ability to satisfactorily draw this line which no court has driven -- drawn effectively in 50 years."
2009.08-1196,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,288.434,303.761,"The real problem with your approach, which I take it is you have to find these duties in State law, is that some States will classify the same conduct as a felony that another will classify as a misdemeanor."
2009.08-1196,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,324.904,325.856,"I agree, Your Honor."
2009.08-1196,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,334.612,338.564,But you are asking us to say State law is the reference.
2009.08-1196,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,338.564,340.1,"No, Your Honor, I'm not."
2009.08-1196,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,544.341,565.021,"But you have no objection to what they call the quid pro quo theory; that is, I -- I want you to hire me after I leave the legislature, and in return, I'm going to see what I can do to keep the tax level low on the--"
2009.08-1196,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,565.021,566.557,"Absolutely right, Your Honor."
2009.08-1196,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,621.007,622.542,That's what the statute says.
2009.08-1196,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,622.542,623.842,--I'm sorry.
2009.08-1196,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,623.842,625.578,That's what the statute says.
2009.08-1196,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,625.578,626.344,"Well, it--"
2009.08-1196,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,626.344,627.428,"It says ""honest services""."
2009.08-1196,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,627.428,637.302,"--Well, what happened here is that the Ninth Circuit reversed the court of -- the court of appeals excluded the evidence, which was offered only in pursuit of that theory."
2009.08-1196,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,693.27,698.856,"I understand them to be saying nondisclosure of a conflict of interest, so they are a little bit more--"
2009.08-1196,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,698.856,699.99,"Well, I think that's right."
2009.08-1196,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,707.446,715.552,"--So why don't you take them at their face, which is, they are saying it has to be a nondisclosure of a conflict of interest that's material?"
2009.08-1196,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,715.552,715.918,--Right.
2009.08-1196,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,715.918,716.668,I think that's what--
2009.08-1196,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,716.668,717.351,"Well, that's right."
2009.08-1196,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,719.936,721.67,--So let's take it from there.
2009.08-1196,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,721.67,722.072,Okay.
2009.08-1196,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,722.072,722.772,Why is that--
2009.08-1196,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,722.772,723.755,"Well, I think--"
2009.08-1196,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,723.755,725.274,--not a limiting principle?
2009.08-1196,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,725.274,747.953,"--I think the -- the problem is that if you -- if you ask the question in the context of this pure nondisclosure theory, the materiality, as the -- as the government articulated it here today and as I think they have articulated it in their brief, was whether it's reasonably likely to affect the decision of the relevant whoever, the relevant person."
2009.08-1196,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,761.713,765.665,"It's -- it's much easier in the public sector, I agree with you, to--"
2009.08-1196,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,765.665,766.365,--But I'm -- but--
2009.08-1196,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,766.365,769.033,--to talk about it in the -- I'm sorry.
2009.08-1196,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,771.485,785.126,"--But I'm talking -- I mean, I -- I can -- I can well understand the concept of bribery, say, where a public official has a duty to award contracts to the lowest competent bidder, and instead, he takes a bribe, and he awards the contract to someone else."
2009.08-1196,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,808.056,816.562,"I'm not sure that -- that whether he did it with disclosure or nondisclosure, what would make the nondisclosure more meaningful?"
2009.08-1196,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,820.18,820.93,"--Well, but there are also--"
2009.08-1196,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,820.93,828.75,"--and if he gets up on the floor of -- of the legislature and says: You know, I am going to vote for this bill because somebody paid me money, he disclosed it."
2009.08-1196,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,829.869,830.569,"--Well, I don't know if it does or not."
2009.08-1196,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,854.601,857.353,"No, I think they're saying -- which I am getting gradually--"
2009.08-1196,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,857.353,858.786,--I'm sorry.
2009.08-1196,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,858.786,863.857,"--I think what he's saying is: First, we know what bribery is; we can deal with that one."
2009.08-1196,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,912.94,913.673,Right.
2009.08-1196,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,913.673,916.392,"Now, I think what he is saying is that's rather precise."
2009.08-1196,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,956.267,967.925,"Well, I think -- I mean, I could argue with that, but I don't need to, because our principal submission, Your Honor, is that -- that we win this case because there is no clear duty to disclose."
2009.08-1196,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,969.443,975.513,"You are saying, I take it, that there was no duty in Alaska criminal law, disclosure law, to disclose."
2009.08-1196,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,980.834,984.636,"--Well, there is no Alaska law -- it's absolutely clear and it is not disputed here."
2009.08-1196,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,988.421,990.273,Not even in the Uniform Commercial Code or the--
2009.08-1196,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,990.273,1002.264,"--Well, one of the things -- well, the government certainly didn't offer anything other than what it offered, and the court looked at it and the court said there's no duty -- he went through several pages of saying there is no duty to disclose here, and the government did not appeal."
2009.08-1196,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1003.848,1004.681,Let me just ask you--
2009.08-1196,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,1004.681,1005.414,"The government said: Well, it doesn't matter."
2009.08-1196,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1005.414,1008.65,--I'm learning something about the case that I didn't understand before.
2009.08-1196,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,1016.572,1019.941,"I'm not -- I'm not, Your Honor."
2009.08-1196,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1034.098,1036.216,I thought you were arguing that a duty to disclose could never qualify.
2009.08-1196,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,1036.216,1039.252,"--I -- well, I -- you could argue that."
2009.08-1196,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1041.368,1043.554,"I'm trying to figure out what your position is, not what you could argue."
2009.08-1196,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,1043.554,1048.274,"Well, my position is that you must have some duty, and there's no duty here other than 1346."
2009.08-1196,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1048.274,1053.845,"But if you then -- but if you do have some duty, would the statute have been violated on these -- on these facts?"
2009.08-1196,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,1053.845,1054.562,You--
2009.08-1196,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1054.562,1060.082,If there were a duty to disclose the negotiations of this prospective employer or--
2009.08-1196,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,1060.082,1064.2,"--Well, would you have -- you would have to ask -- you would have to ask a couple of questions, I think, further."
2009.08-1196,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1065.9,1069.621,"--Well, it's a duty to disclose those facts to the legislature."
2009.08-1196,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,1069.621,1071.438,With a criminal penalty attached?
2009.08-1196,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1071.438,1073.74,"Well, I--"
2009.08-1196,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,1073.74,1080.644,"Well, I think it matters, Your Honor, because I think what you get into, when you are evaluating whether a duty is sufficient, is you get into a clear statement--"
2009.08-1196,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1080.644,1085.047,--But your position is not that there's no duty; it's that there is not a duty with sufficiently severe penalties?
2009.08-1196,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,1087.149,1091.284,"--No, the point I'm making is all about -- it's all about this Court's clear statement rule."
2009.08-1196,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1137.162,1147.286,But that is not a -- your position is not that there be no duty to disclose; you are saying there is not a duty to disclose of sufficient moment to justify criminal penalties.
2009.08-1196,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,1147.286,1152.321,"--I -- I don't -- that's one way to say it, sufficient moment, or of a character that makes it appropriate."
2009.08-1196,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1192.065,1199.969,"One of your arguments -- an important argument in your brief is the -- the Federal balance, apart from vagueness for a moment--"
2009.08-1196,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,1199.969,1200.252,Right.
2009.08-1196,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1200.252,1202.437,--which was the lurking problem here.
2009.08-1196,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,1223.784,1224.884,"Well, I'm not sure I understand--"
2009.08-1196,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1224.884,1225.217,--in those -- those two alternatives.
2009.08-1196,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,1225.217,1225.967,"--your question, Your Honor."
2009.08-1196,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1231.454,1235.406,You say if there's a State law prohibition--
2009.08-1196,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,1235.406,1235.889,--Uh-huh.
2009.08-1196,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1235.889,1237.025,--then this statute applies.
2009.08-1196,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,1242.41,1242.576,Well--
2009.08-1196,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1242.576,1245.795,So it seems to me there's not much to choose between -- between the two arguments.
2009.08-1196,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,1245.795,1268.191,"--Well, I guess the one thing I want to make real clear is that -- that we are in no way arguing that, for example, someone who violates the Hobbs Act and -- and does it by using the mail and otherwise satisfies the fraud provision, the fraud requirement of the mail fraud statute and the mailing requirement, we are certainly not here contending that you couldn't prosecute him if you wanted to under this statute."
2009.08-1196,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1274.312,1276.131,--But then I don't understand your question presented.
2009.08-1196,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,1299.68,1309.268,"--Your Honor, there's a story there which I won't bore you with much of, but that's a question that the government rewrote and the Court adopted and I actually filed a motion."
2009.08-1196,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1332.884,1339.638,"But you are asking for a State law reference, and that brings up the problem of the variety of State law."
2009.08-1196,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,1348.476,1348.843,--Right.
2009.08-1196,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1348.843,1354.88,--that says: Don't look to how the States define property.
2009.08-1196,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,1354.88,1356.796,Right.
2009.08-1196,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1356.796,1360.015,There should be a uniform Federal definition.
2009.08-1196,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,1369.806,1382.613,"Well, Your Honor, I think -- I think this is the situation -- it's certainly true -- the government cites the Jerome case as well for the general proposition that you don't take a Federal statute and just leap off and start applying State law norms."
2009.08-1196,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1484.909,1496.35,"What if there's a statute that prohibits a legislator from engaging in certain conduct and attaches a significant penalty to it, but there is no statute that requires the disclosure of the conduct?"
2009.08-1196,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,1496.35,1509.323,"Well, there's -- there's an argument to be made that the -- that the government could pursue, and I don't want to say they could, but if it's a criminal statute, there's an argument the government could pursue their case on that theory."
2009.08-1196,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1518.863,1523.167,Let me give you this example: Take the Judge Holzer case we all know about.
2009.08-1196,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,1538.26,1544.246,"--Well, I think -- the first thing I want to say is that I think that is counterfactual, and they were talking about bribery."
2009.08-1196,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1546.698,1548.048,But if it's not illegal--
2009.08-1196,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,1548.048,1548.665,If it's not illegal--
2009.08-1196,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1548.665,1549.734,--in the State I'm asking you about?
2009.08-1196,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,1549.734,1558.154,"--If it's not illegal, then I would say that there has to be -- the conduct he engaged in must be illegal under some law or it -- he didn't breach a duty."
2009.08-1196,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1558.154,1559.59,"It does not have to be Alaska law, then?"
2009.08-1196,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,1559.59,1560.573,I'm sorry?
2009.08-1196,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1560.573,1563.542,"In this case, it does not have to be Alaska law, then?"
2009.08-1196,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,1563.542,1564.844,It wouldn't have to be Alaska law.
2009.08-1196,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1579.068,1588.959,"But I'm just trying -- if it's -- it's illegal in 47 States, but not in the State in which the prosecution is brought, you say the Federal rule could not apply?"
2009.08-1196,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,1588.959,1592.344,"I would say that -- that -- yes, that is my answer."
2009.08-1196,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1625.916,1626.917,"Thank you, counsel."
2009.08-1196,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1629.517,1631.119,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2009.08-1196,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1666.625,1668.242,"Before we do that, Mr. Dreeben--"
2009.08-1196,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1668.242,1669.075,And that case -- that theory--
2009.08-1196,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1669.075,1678.164,"--Mr. Dreeben, I would like to ask you about this case particularly: One thing that the prosecutor did, one thing that the Ninth Circuit did."
2009.08-1196,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1720.177,1724.795,"--That's what the document that you are reading from said, Justice Ginsburg."
2009.08-1196,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1780.149,1788.404,"Then you must agree that the Ninth Circuit was wrong, at least in this particular -- this -- I'm now reading from 19a."
2009.08-1196,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1808.949,1814.37,"--Well, Justice Ginsburg, I think that's -- that's a shorthand summary of the nondisclosure theory."
2009.08-1196,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1844.571,1845.738,Excuse me.

2009.08-1196,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1931.244,1934.363,"No, it's not enough, Justice Ginsburg, not standing alone."
2009.08-1196,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1969.869,1972.169,What if he had voted against the legislation?

2009.08-1196,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1979.825,1985.546,So it's not merely the taking official action; it's taking official action that benefits him?
2009.08-1196,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1985.546,1985.979,--Correct.
2009.08-1196,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1986.879,1988.498,I imagine -- I'm sorry.

2009.08-1196,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2055.606,2060.01,And this is supposed to be something that the average citizen who works there just knows all about?
2009.08-1196,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2060.01,2068.533,"I think that when we are talking about State legislative officers, when we are talking about public officials, they know that they are fiduciaries."
2009.08-1196,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2097.033,2097.885,"He intended not to disclose something, right."

2009.08-1196,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2113.393,2113.81,"Okay, okay."
2009.08-1196,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2114.329,2115.362,--but the government needs to show that.
2009.08-1196,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2125.185,2132.04,But what if -- what if that external standard imposed penalties vastly different from the mail fraud statute?

2009.08-1196,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2142.146,2151.835,"It's a light sentence because the disclosure obligations are confusing, but -- and then the Federal prosecutor comes along and says, well, you -- you are going away for 20 years because this violates 1346."
2009.08-1196,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2151.835,2156.47,"--Well, we would have to show, first of all, that he knew that he was breaching a legal duty."

2009.08-1196,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2158.839,2159.172,Okay.
2009.08-1196,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2159.172,2159.691,--Yes.
2009.08-1196,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2159.691,2171.313,Then my answer is we live in a dual system in which citizens are governed by and accountable both by their States and by the Federal government.
2009.08-1196,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2171.313,2184.739,"So, you have no problem with the idea that the State law, the source of the duty to disclose, imposes a penalty of 6 months, and the Federal law you say you can still go after him not only 20 years but an additional 20 years?"
2009.08-1196,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2184.739,2187.608,"But this is fundamental to the government's position here, Mr. Chief Justice."
2009.08-1196,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2196.53,2197.78,Please articulate it again for me.
2009.08-1196,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2219.276,2248.479,"--Well, Justice Sotomayor, what I am trying to say to this Court this morning is that what 1346 reinstated was the notion that if fiduciaries have a duty not to further their own personal conflicting financial interests by taking official action, it becomes a Federal crime only when there is both materiality and intent to defraud."
2009.08-1196,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2278.629,2290.171,"Let me ask you right at that point: Does the prohibited action, namely, voting -- does that vote have to be contrary to -- serve the interest of the other party?"

2009.08-1196,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2296.105,2299.257,"So, now -- now think of that answer -- complete that answer, if you can."
2009.08-1196,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2299.257,2305.995,"--He did it in violation of a State substantive duty, and the government's burden will be to show he knew he was acting wrongfully."
2009.08-1196,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2327.61,2333.53,"Now, go back to -- I'm trying to get you back to your general answer that you wanted to give."
2009.08-1196,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2337.566,2337.966,Yes.
2009.08-1196,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2337.966,2340.184,"--which I made up, and these are all the things that--"
2009.08-1196,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2340.184,2340.401,Yes.
2009.08-1196,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2340.401,2342.703,--an employee owes an employer.
2009.08-1196,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2342.703,2343.286,Right.
2009.08-1196,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2343.286,2355.761,"Now, some of them -- you have taken out three -- no bribes, no kickbacks and no conflicts of interest where that's defined in the narrow way you've defined it."
2009.08-1196,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2365.749,2366.734,Something like that.
2009.08-1196,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2366.734,2367.268,Something like that.
2009.08-1196,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2381.442,2382.442,"Well, Justice Breyer, I--"
2009.08-1196,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2382.442,2382.808,But I don't mean them to be comical.
2009.08-1196,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2393.75,2394.45,--Justice Breyer--
2009.08-1196,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2394.45,2395.283,"I mean, why not that one?"
2009.08-1196,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2395.283,2403.188,"--I really don't think that this Court needs to worry about that as a type of honest services prosecution, because this was a defined universe of cases--"
2009.08-1196,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2403.188,2403.455,"No, no."
2009.08-1196,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2413.644,2413.913,--Right.

2009.08-1196,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2434.475,2434.725,"Well, I -- I think--"
2009.08-1196,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2434.725,2435.425,--you say it covers.
2009.08-1196,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2435.425,2437.525,--To say that we picked them randomly--
2009.08-1196,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2437.525,2438.877,"No, no, you picked them -- all right."

2009.08-1196,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2607.301,2614.071,I thought there was a principle that a citizen is supposed to be able to understand the criminal law that was around even before Justice Scalia.
2009.08-1196,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2614.071,2615.737,"--I understand that, Justice Breyer--"
2009.08-1196,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2625.51,2632.116,"I thought the principle was that a citizen has to be able to understand the law, and if he can't, then the law is invalid."
2009.08-1196,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2632.116,2650.51,"Well, I think the principle is that the Court has recognized -- and it has done so most prominently in the Sherman Act and in the civil rights statutes, 18 U.S.C., Section 241 and 242, that these are broad statutes with general language, and in order to be made susceptible of criminal punishment, you need two things."
2009.08-1196,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2663.568,2667.27,"Number one, I am -- I am not going to draw any generalities from the civil rights statutes."
2009.08-1196,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2685.064,2703.876,"--Well, I wasn't citing the Sherman Act as an example of formulating a common law of crimes, but there is only one Due Process Clause, Justice Scalia, so if it is constitutional to prosecute under the civil rights statutes and under the Sherman Act, then it is constitutional for this Court to divine from the pre-McNally case law principles and to articulate them."
2009.08-1196,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2703.876,2706.478,"Well, the Sherman Act criminalizes price fixing."
2009.08-1196,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2714.834,2716.534,I think I've got it down to around eight.

2009.08-1196,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2770.967,2772.017,--Justice Scalia--

2009.08-1196,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2777.621,2780.723,"And it comes to this Court, and this Court says, bad things means bribery."
2009.08-1196,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2782.659,2788.646,"--That's not what this law says, and that's not what this Court has done in response to other criminal law."

2009.08-1196,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2799.085,2800.12,But that's common.
2009.08-1196,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2818.248,2821.284,"Well, that's a familiar common law term."
2009.08-1196,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2823.284,2841.245,"But it is a term of art that had reference to a specific body of case law that could not have been given a higher degree of prominence than it was by this Court's decision in McNally, which acknowledged that body of law, rejected it because it said the mail fraud statute did not protect intangible rights."
2009.08-1196,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2841.245,2842.196,I'm not remembering.

2009.08-1196,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2849.665,2849.665,Okay.
2009.08-1196,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2849.665,2850.031,--whether the phrase--
2009.08-1196,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2850.031,2851.598,"Well, you say it was a body of law."

2009.08-1196,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2869.226,2873.578,"And that's quite different from -- from harking back to a common law term, such as fraud."
2009.08-1196,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2873.578,2908.668,"--In McNally, this Court said that body of law was not a valid implementation of the mail fraud statute, and it invited Congress to come back and legislate if it wanted to protect intangible rights, and Congress did that in a way that doesn't have the commendable clarity of the statute that you just drafted for us, Justice Scalia, but it does refer -- and I think, for those members of the Court who read legislative history, legislative history was replete with references to the key cases on which we rely here, such as United States v. Mandel and United States v. Margiotta."

2009.08-1196,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3216.861,3217.161,All right.
2009.08-1196,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3223.365,3223.801,--Certainly.
2009.08-1196,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3251.618,3251.918,I have one--
2009.08-1196,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3251.918,3252.851,May I ask you this question?

2009.08-1196,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3280.903,3289.24,"Yes, but you say that in order for the violation to be complete, he must follow up by voting in the interest of the company rather than the polls?"

2009.08-1196,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3292.794,3294.711,And it has to be a specific kind of official action.
2009.08-1196,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3294.711,3298.096,--Official action that furthers his undisclosed interest.

2009.08-1196,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3349.993,3357.114,"--Even after he discloses he still couldn't vote that way, so he's supposed to vote against it even though he thinks it's a good thing for the State to do?"
2009.08-1196,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3357.114,3358.299,--He's supposed to abstain.
2009.08-1196,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3363.62,3372.023,"Well, what if a public official -- you said in response to Justice Stevens that this actionable conduct has to benefit the defendant's interest."
2009.08-1196,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3391.001,3395.203,"--That's not the sort of theory of honest services that we're arguing for, Mr. Chief Justice."
2009.08-1196,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3395.203,3395.455,Why?
2009.08-1196,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3397.221,3398.856,"A personal, conflicting financial interest."
2009.08-1196,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3399.439,3399.689,--Financial.
2009.08-1196,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3399.689,3400.289,--That's right.
2009.08-1196,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3400.289,3401.055,It has to involve financial--
2009.08-1196,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3401.055,3401.555,That's right.
2009.08-1196,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3411.663,3415.382,"--Well, where does the right to honest services say ""financial""?"
2009.08-1196,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3415.382,3429.374,"I think it says it, Mr. Chief Justice, by looking at the body of case law that involved violations of the right of honest services and seeing that that's what the government was after, personal conflicting financial interests."
2009.08-1196,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3434.862,3435.295,Yes.
2009.08-1196,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3435.295,3453.674,"This is a bedrock principle of the common law that exists in all 50 States, and the mistake that the lower courts made in the pre-McNally era was in thinking that the mail fraud statute protected it, but there was no obscurity whatsoever that the fiduciaries owe an obligation of undivided loyalty to their principal."
2009.08-1196,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3455.124,3456.126,"Thank you, counsel."

2009.08-1196,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3534.187,3536.622,"You're saying that you'll win on the facts, not the theory."
2009.08-1196,2,20486,donald_b_ayer,,3536.622,3537.022,Yes.
2009.08-1196,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3537.956,3538.206,But that's not what we have to decide.
2009.08-1196,2,20486,donald_b_ayer,,3538.206,3538.456,--to pursue it.
2009.08-1196,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3647.308,3648.51,May I ask this question?
2009.08-1196,2,20486,donald_b_ayer,,3659.466,3661.518,"--No, I think they made their argument."
