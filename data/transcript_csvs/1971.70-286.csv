1971.70-286,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,35.293,"We will hear arguments next in Number 70-286, Iowa Beef Packers against Edward Thompson."
1971.70-286,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,37.224,39.318,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1971.70-286,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,56.902,59.601,"Your motion is granted, Mr. Solicitor General."
1971.70-286,1,34512,louis_s_goldberg,,67.55,71.981,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1971.70-286,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,93.819,101.95,The grant was limited.
1971.70-286,1,34512,louis_s_goldberg,,101.95,119.306,"On the merits, if I may at the outset, I would like to present very briefly the three central points that petitioner believes are critical in this case."
1971.70-286,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,365.688,380.871,Now let us assume in the ordinary situation under this contract that grievance and trial or that an employee has a grievance?
1971.70-286,1,34512,louis_s_goldberg,,388.353,388.895,The --
1971.70-286,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,388.895,392.815,Or did the Union have to energize the process?
1971.70-286,1,34512,louis_s_goldberg,,392.815,395.436,"No, Your Honor."
1971.70-286,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,402.294,413.079,Could an individual employee if he was turned down the -- turned down by the employer in the initial steps request arbitration?
1971.70-286,1,34512,louis_s_goldberg,,413.079,414.365,"Not directly, no."
1971.70-286,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,418.237,423.278,"So the employee could initiate a grievance procedure, but he could not take it to arbitration?"
1971.70-286,1,34512,louis_s_goldberg,,423.278,424.919,"Not entirely on his own, Your Honor."
1971.70-286,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,424.919,426.613,Well not entirely.
1971.70-286,1,34512,louis_s_goldberg,,431.594,438.242,"No, I would say -- well, it might but it would not terminate the employees’ rights."
1971.70-286,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,438.242,444.387,"Well, I would not terminate his rights, but it would terminate his rights to arbitrate?"
1971.70-286,1,34512,louis_s_goldberg,,444.387,449.924,"Well, Vaca against Sipes of course requires the union to exercise proper diligence and so forth."
1971.70-286,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,449.924,459.515,"Well I know, but Vaca against Sipes also said that every time a union refuses, it does not mean that it is wrong?"
1971.70-286,1,34512,louis_s_goldberg,,459.515,460.841,"Well, that is true, Your Honor."
1971.70-286,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,460.841,468.404,"Now, let us assume that a union at the end of the grievance procedure refuses to take the case to arbitration?"
1971.70-286,1,34512,louis_s_goldberg,,475.623,475.909,That is right.
1971.70-286,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,475.909,477.924,And he could go to Court under 301?
1971.70-286,1,34512,louis_s_goldberg,,477.924,478.9,But --
1971.70-286,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,478.9,478.966,Right?
1971.70-286,1,34512,louis_s_goldberg,,478.966,482.352,"But in this case, they did not even to attempt the first step, Your Honor."
1971.70-286,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,482.352,484.248,They did not even attempt to take it to grievance?
1971.70-286,1,34512,louis_s_goldberg,,484.248,489.185,"That is right, Your Honor."
1971.70-286,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,489.185,503.911,Now let us assume that he had and is he entitled to represent himself or is the union entitled to be there at the grievance procedure?
1971.70-286,1,34512,louis_s_goldberg,,503.911,513.686,"The first step sir, plaintiff recites I believe in the collective bargaining agreement that the individual employee may initiate that first step."
1971.70-286,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,513.686,522.131,Does employees involve with a union representative if he chose his right at the first step?
1971.70-286,1,34512,louis_s_goldberg,,522.131,522.986,"Yes, Your Honor."
1971.70-286,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,522.986,535.394,"Every step after that apparently has to be handled by the steps two and three and up to arbitration at any event, it has to be handled by union representatives, is it under grievance and arbitration?"
1971.70-286,1,34512,louis_s_goldberg,,535.394,536.867,That is right.
1971.70-286,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,544.414,560.518,"Apart from that, I gather you rely in any event on the 14 individual employees, and not even discuss the process of grievance with the immediate supervisor, is that right?"
1971.70-286,1,34512,louis_s_goldberg,,560.518,560.886,That is right.
1971.70-286,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,561.985,566.62,"Isn't it all very theoretical, there is no more union?"
1971.70-286,1,34512,louis_s_goldberg,,566.62,567.47,I am sorry.
1971.70-286,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,569.718,571.838,Is this not all very theoretical?
1971.70-286,1,34512,louis_s_goldberg,,575.68,583.383,The same point Mr. Justice was made in the Maddox case and that this Court summarily overruled that --
1971.70-286,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,583.383,587.538,"Well, the Union does not represent these employees anymore, does it?"
1971.70-286,1,34512,louis_s_goldberg,,587.538,588.152,"Well, that is right."
1971.70-286,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,613.708,618.851,"But the present posture of the case is quite different, is it not?"
1971.70-286,1,34512,louis_s_goldberg,,618.851,629.763,"Well, I think the individual still has the right to initiate grievance procedure and I would think Your Honor that in the absence of a union there would be no rule of law."
1971.70-286,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,639.205,646.445,But the only provision that was required was the provision in the union contract that no longer exists?
1971.70-286,1,34512,louis_s_goldberg,,646.445,653.303,"Well, that was so argued in the Maddox case and Maddox overruled that to point Your Honor whereas the Marilyn (ph) said --"
1971.70-286,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,653.303,658.671,"Well, I am rephrasing it again, I just wondered?"
1971.70-286,1,34512,louis_s_goldberg,,660.862,668.113,"No problem, Your Honor."
1971.70-286,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,756.327,759.019,Maddox was not -- what was the claiming Maddox?
1971.70-286,1,34512,louis_s_goldberg,,761.883,766.146,"Sovereign’s pay, Your Honor under the contract."
1971.70-286,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,766.146,767.185,Sovereign’s pay under the contract?
1971.70-286,1,34512,louis_s_goldberg,,767.185,767.272,Yes (Voice Overlap)
1971.70-286,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,767.272,770.307,"It was not damage for wrongful discharge, was it?"
1971.70-286,1,34512,louis_s_goldberg,,770.307,783.617,"The mine has been closed there and there was no foreman and Maddox said that therefore there was no way to attempt the grievance procedure, but this Court in Maddox summarily overruled that contention."
1971.70-286,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,783.617,792.132,And of course in Maddox the only substantive right he had to sovereign’s pay was by the reason of the collective bargaining agreement?
1971.70-286,1,34512,louis_s_goldberg,,792.132,801.908,"That is right and we say here that also, the only substantive right involved here is lunch period and the violation of that agreement by the employer."
1971.70-286,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,801.908,818.22,"Well, the court may look at it, but here at least you do have in the background Fair Labor Standards Act which give overtime for pay and a half where in they work eight hours a day for 40 hours a week?"
1971.70-286,1,34512,louis_s_goldberg,,818.22,819.486,That is over 40 hours a week.
1971.70-286,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,847.005,850.074,"Well, except the Fair Labor Standards Act is more than remedial rights, does it not?"
1971.70-286,1,34512,louis_s_goldberg,,855.78,858.633,That is right Your Honor and the --
1971.70-286,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,858.633,871.538,"So if there were no collective bargaining agreement here, you would concede that on the allegations of the plaintiff’s complaint, they have a course of action in the Fair Labor Standards Act, would that not be true?"
1971.70-286,1,34512,louis_s_goldberg,,871.538,872.681,That is --
1971.70-286,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,872.681,884.94,"And by contract in the Maddox case, if there had been no collective bargaining agreement, there could have been no course of action, is that not also true?"
1971.70-286,1,34512,louis_s_goldberg,,884.94,898.579,"No, the -- this difference show Mr. Justice that the Fair Labor Standards Act does not require the granting of lunch time."
1971.70-286,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,969.053,983.659,"In this case, in this case Mr. Goldberg, suppose you were to prevail than the employees would have to go back under a grievance procedure under the contract, is that right or could they go directly into arbitration?"
1971.70-286,1,34512,louis_s_goldberg,,983.659,991.352,"Well, possibly Your Honor under the Maddox decision, there was just a reversal of the case below."
1971.70-286,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1003.703,1011.533,"Well, the first step of the grievance procedure (Inaudible)?"
1971.70-286,1,34512,louis_s_goldberg,,1011.533,1011.639,Pardon?
1971.70-286,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1013.714,1025.704,"The first step of the grievance procedure provided for in the contract, sets a time limit on discussing the matter with foreman (Inaudible)?"
1971.70-286,1,34512,louis_s_goldberg,,1025.704,1027.417,"No, I think not."
1971.70-286,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1028.79,1030.175,After that?
1971.70-286,1,34512,louis_s_goldberg,,1031.532,1031.915,Yes.
1971.70-286,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1031.915,1033.744,Only in future step?
1971.70-286,1,34512,louis_s_goldberg,,1033.744,1042.827,That is right and the arbitrator; he will be required to apply all the remedial provisions of the Standards Act.
1971.70-286,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1413.065,1420.162,Is there any issue in this case involving the construction of the collective agreements?
1971.70-286,1,34512,louis_s_goldberg,,1420.162,1420.624,I think none.
1971.70-286,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1441.192,1450.065,So that there is problems relating to in fact the custom or usage of tradition practices?
1971.70-286,1,34512,louis_s_goldberg,,1450.065,1458.228,"No, Your Honor, there is nothing here to rebut the requirement for using the grievance procedures."
1971.70-286,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1460.644,1468.423,What then -- what then have the grievance procedure been involved by the 14 employees?
1971.70-286,1,34512,louis_s_goldberg,,1473.949,1478.486,"Precisely, the thing that that Court just -- that the Court was called upon."
1971.70-286,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1489.073,1497.517,"Well, if that's so, then there is a matter of construction and application of the contract."
1971.70-286,1,34512,louis_s_goldberg,,1502.047,1502.228,Oh!
1971.70-286,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1505.248,1509.742,You said to Mr. Justice Douglas that there wasn't any?
1971.70-286,1,34512,louis_s_goldberg,,1509.742,1517.138,"Well, I guess I did not understand the full part of the question then."
1971.70-286,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1527.397,1533.351,Well does it come down to what is overtime under the statute?
1971.70-286,1,34512,louis_s_goldberg,,1533.351,1536.268,"The overtime under the contract too, Your Honor."
1971.70-286,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1542.46,1544.835,"Both use the word overtime, is that right?"
1971.70-286,1,34512,louis_s_goldberg,,1544.835,1544.984,Oh!
1971.70-286,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1557.851,1569.994,Do you claim any practice or custom in this industry that employees should be on call during their lunch hour?
1971.70-286,1,34512,louis_s_goldberg,,1569.994,1574.309,"No, I think not."
1971.70-286,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1619.336,1627.163,"Well if you admitted the right and the violation of the right, why did you not just pay them?"
1971.70-286,1,34512,louis_s_goldberg,,1627.163,1627.335,Oh!
1971.70-286,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1644.7,1651.65,But do you would have –- you would have wanted to present the arbitrator your opposition to the claim?
1971.70-286,1,34512,louis_s_goldberg,,1657.232,1659.024,"Precisely, that is what the same is --"
1971.70-286,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1659.024,1661.424,You want the arbitrator rather than the Court to determine it?
1971.70-286,1,34512,louis_s_goldberg,,1661.424,1662.695,That is right Your Honor.
1971.70-286,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1662.695,1663.939,I see.
1971.70-286,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1663.939,1674.417,"But Mr. Goldberg, might there had been evidence that you could have introduced before the arbitrator that you could not introduce in the Fair Labor Standards Act case?"
1971.70-286,1,34512,louis_s_goldberg,,1674.417,1676.844,I think not Your Honor.
1971.70-286,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1676.844,1677.8,Would it have been practical?
1971.70-286,1,34512,louis_s_goldberg,,1677.8,1684.416,We presented the same evidence I think in both situations.
1971.70-286,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1684.416,1688.406,You do not get a jury trial before the arbitrator?
1971.70-286,1,34512,louis_s_goldberg,,1688.406,1689.05,"No, Your Honor."
1971.70-286,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1704.546,1706.814,Mr. Randolph.
1971.70-286,2,16855,a_raymond_randolph_jr,,1706.814,1708.878,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1971.70-286,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1747.704,1753.771,"But it is a straight -- from your point of view, it is a straight excess of eight hours and 40 hours, isn't it?"
1971.70-286,2,16855,a_raymond_randolph_jr,,1753.771,1756.96,The Fair Labor Standards Act only provides a (Voice Overlap) compensation.
1971.70-286,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1756.96,1757.164,Forty hours?
1971.70-286,2,16855,a_raymond_randolph_jr,,1757.164,1759.159,Over 40 hours in the workplace.
1971.70-286,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1802.954,1808.968,Do you -- does the government challenge the aribitrability of the matter into the contract?
1971.70-286,2,16855,a_raymond_randolph_jr,,1808.968,1812.854,"The government does not challenge that, although the co-counsel --"
1971.70-286,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1812.854,1820.662,The Arbitration Clause is brought not to include the claim on the under the Fair Labor Standards Act (Voice Overlap)?
1971.70-286,2,16855,a_raymond_randolph_jr,,1820.662,1824.278,Co-counsel has raised that issue and he will argue that point.
1971.70-286,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1828.192,1834.231,And then what is the reason for not limiting the matter to arbitration in the government case?
1971.70-286,2,16855,a_raymond_randolph_jr,,1834.231,1836.567,"Well, I think there are many, many reasons."
1971.70-286,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2070.286,2075.36,"Well, that would not necessarily prevent remission to arbitration?"
1971.70-286,2,16855,a_raymond_randolph_jr,,2079.719,2081.831,Supposing -- My point is Mr. Justice White --
1971.70-286,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2081.831,2086.802,You just might avoid the lawsuit at all if it went to arbitration and get everything they wanted?
1971.70-286,2,16855,a_raymond_randolph_jr,,2086.802,2090.766,My point is that before you -- arbitration may or may not happen.
1971.70-286,3,39297,raymond_edward_franck,,2906.575,2910.247,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1971.70-286,4,34512,louis_s_goldberg,,3529.967,3537.393,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1971.70-286,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3576.793,3592.881,So what you are after is the assertion that collective bargaining contract itself did not specifically give the arbitrator the power to hear a statutory as compared with a contractual claim?
1971.70-286,4,34512,louis_s_goldberg,,3592.881,3622.877,"Mr. Justice White, our understanding is that the operation of the law is just the other way that under the opinion in Maddox and in the opinions in the Steelworkers cases, the rule seems to be as we understand it, laid down that arbitration does apply unless there is an express exclusion of some subject matter in the contract."
