1996.95-1455,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,20.546,"We'll hear argument now in Number 94-1455, Janet Reno v. Bossier Parish School Board, and George Price v. Bossier Parish School Board."
1996.95-1455,0,21392,deval_l_patrick,,35.305,42.782,"It... we... it is usually referred to and has been in the litigation as Bossier Parish, but in Louisiana it's Bossier."
1996.95-1455,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,42.782,44.442,"Bossier, okay."
1996.95-1455,0,21392,deval_l_patrick,,44.442,50.636,"And if you say Bossier... if you say Bossier in the course of this I'll probably be confused, so if you say Bossier it would be helpful."
1996.95-1455,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,50.636,53.358,You would think in French it would be Bossier rather than Bossier.
1996.95-1455,0,21392,deval_l_patrick,,53.358,55.11,"Bossier, oui."
1996.95-1455,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,55.11,60.954,"Very well, Mr. Patrick--"
1996.95-1455,1,29235,john_w_borkowski,,937.739,945.833,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1996.95-1455,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,982.368,1004.393,"Well, if we're... if you're going to get into the sort of detail that you say Arlington Heights requires us to get into, I would think that it would be important to know whether the school board's failure to maintain a biracial committee was the result of hostility to the idea, neglect, maybe unable to have the funds, maybe just got lost in the shuffle."
1996.95-1455,1,29235,john_w_borkowski,,1014.719,1031.06,"That's absolutely right, and the facts on this record are that the board admitted in the direct testimonies of Mr. Musgrove and Mr. Myrick, the two board members who testified, that when this committee started getting into educational policy issues, they disbanded, because they did not want this committee having a role in it."
1996.95-1455,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1031.06,1035.152,"Well, was the committee set up to deal with educational policy issues?"
1996.95-1455,1,29235,john_w_borkowski,,1035.152,1035.863,"Yes, it was."
1996.95-1455,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1047.931,1062.36,And your position is that all these matters and many others like them must become a part of a section 5 case and must be resolved under section 2 standards before there can be... the preclearance decision can be made?
1996.95-1455,1,29235,john_w_borkowski,,1062.36,1068.695,--These facts only become relevant in a purpose determination.
1996.95-1455,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1084.366,1085.928,"Well, but I thought there were two points."
1996.95-1455,1,29235,john_w_borkowski,,1098.434,1129.145,"--I'm focusing here on the purpose argument only, and Justice O'Connor asked whether the Arlington Heights standard was the standard for section 5, and in Pleasant Grove even the dissenters, who did not find discriminatory purpose, cited Arlington Heights as the proper standard to apply, and decisions that this Court has affirmed... Busbee v. Smith and Port Arthur... also apply to Arlington Heights, and it's the constitutional standard, and... so I'm just talking at this point about the purpose argument."
1996.95-1455,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1144.516,1145.445,"Where are you reading from, Mr. Borkowski?"
1996.95-1455,1,29235,john_w_borkowski,,1145.445,1150.419,"--Twenty-four a, in the appendix to the jurisdictional statement."
1996.95-1455,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1155.493,1159.256,"Whereabouts on 23a, so we can follow you when you read."
1996.95-1455,1,29235,john_w_borkowski,,1159.256,1167.062,"--On 23a and 24a, the court at three different times says that it's not going to consider this evidence."
1996.95-1455,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1167.062,1168.713,"Well, point out at least one of them, will you?"
1996.95-1455,1,29235,john_w_borkowski,,1168.713,1176.927,"Twenty-three a, at the beginning of the first paragraph, we... it's argued that we must still consider evidence of a section 2 violation as evidence of a discriminatory purpose under section 5."
1996.95-1455,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1197.912,1199.754,"Well, excuse me."
1996.95-1455,1,29235,john_w_borkowski,,1232.665,1233.657,--Yes.
1996.95-1455,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1233.657,1241.341,"What we're discussing here is whether evidence that would go to show a violation may be brought in, and I don't see this as contradicting that."
1996.95-1455,1,29235,john_w_borkowski,,1241.341,1258.793,"Well, there are three different statements, and one of the statements that... the statement you referred to could be interpreted that way, but Judge Kessler in dissent says to the... says in footnote 4 on page 42a that the majority is not considering this evidence, and the majority never says it is."
1996.95-1455,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1320.933,1324.286,"Well, when you say excluded, you mean the court may not fail to consider it."
1996.95-1455,1,29235,john_w_borkowski,,1324.286,1324.726,--Yes.
1996.95-1455,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1334.506,1336.287,Did... isn't mentioned in the majority opinion.
1996.95-1455,1,29235,john_w_borkowski,,1348.155,1350.606,No.
1996.95-1455,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1350.606,1352.108,"I mean, there are two different points."
1996.95-1455,1,29235,john_w_borkowski,,1370.359,1376.544,I don't believe it would be a violation per se simply not to mention evidence that is considered.
1996.95-1455,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1433.98,1442.966,"So what would you say is the instruction, on your view of this case, that the district court should be given were we to remand?"
1996.95-1455,1,29235,john_w_borkowski,,1447.21,1459.519,"I believe that on this record the Court should not... should simply remand with instructions that preclearance be denied, because the record here overwhelmingly establishes discriminatory purpose."
1996.95-1455,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1461.169,1470.585,"But if we don't agree with you on that and we think that the first shot, anyway, should be... or the second... done by the district court, what then?"
1996.95-1455,1,29235,john_w_borkowski,,1470.585,1493.599,"--Then I would say that you would have to remand with instructions to apply Arlington Heights and to look at all of the evidence that this Court in the voting context, in section 5 cases, in school cases, in all cases where intent is an issue, to look at that evidence in all of those categories, keeping in mind that the burden of proof is on the school board here."
1996.95-1455,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1523.489,1525.231,"Thank you, Mr. Borkowski."
1996.95-1455,2,35611,michael_a_carvin,,1527.091,1532.617,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1996.95-1455,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1559.833,1560.914,"Well, my difficulty--"
1996.95-1455,2,35611,michael_a_carvin,,1560.914,1561.705,What... excuse me.
1996.95-1455,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1561.705,1562.925,--My... I'm sorry.
1996.95-1455,2,35611,michael_a_carvin,,1576.485,1577.354,"Yes, I do."
1996.95-1455,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1577.354,1577.855,Okay.
1996.95-1455,2,35611,michael_a_carvin,,1638.265,1639.654,"No, it's not, Your Honor."
1996.95-1455,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1639.654,1640.455,Then explain that.
1996.95-1455,2,35611,michael_a_carvin,,1640.455,1661.1,"First of all, the case he is citing from did not... was making the point that in analyzing purpose you must look at the limited purpose of section 5 and not get into these additional section 2 issues that the Justice Department had urged upon the court in Texas and was also urging upon the court here."
1996.95-1455,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1721.7,1723.881,Then why did it quote what I just read?
1996.95-1455,2,35611,michael_a_carvin,,1723.881,1724.492,Again--
1996.95-1455,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1724.492,1730.266,"I mean, it doesn't... the quotation doesn't seem to make any sense on your theory of the court's view of purpose."
1996.95-1455,2,35611,michael_a_carvin,,1730.266,1733.856,"--No, but in isolation it may not, but the context is this, Your Honor."
1996.95-1455,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1774.685,1776.555,"Well, what is your position here?"
1996.95-1455,2,35611,michael_a_carvin,,1789.234,1790.183,"Oh, no."
1996.95-1455,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1806.374,1807.776,But there could have been a purpose to dilute.
1996.95-1455,2,35611,michael_a_carvin,,1807.776,1808.726,Yes.
1996.95-1455,3,21392,deval_l_patrick,,3270.065,3279.572,"Thank you, and if the... Mr. Chief Justice, if the Court please, I'd just like to return to a question I didn't answer very well from Justice O'Connor."
1996.95-1455,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3316.568,3322.051,Did they do that within the window that the legislature gave them?
1996.95-1455,3,21392,deval_l_patrick,,3322.051,3332.369,"--I believe they did, yes, and the only argument, Justice Kennedy, is that the school board could not split precincts without the police jury's permission."
1996.95-1455,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3339.141,3342.173,"No, the argument's a little further than that, as I understood the last argument."
1996.95-1455,3,21392,deval_l_patrick,,3346.607,3352.831,"--Well, but the window of opportunity opens again on... after the 1st of January, 1993, and that's important."
1996.95-1455,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3354.802,3360.606,"But they had... but again, the argument made was that they had an obligation to come up with districts before then."
1996.95-1455,3,21392,deval_l_patrick,,3360.606,3361.757,"--Well, that's right."
1996.95-1455,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3366.17,3366.861,Is it wrong?
1996.95-1455,3,21392,deval_l_patrick,,3368.2,3378.889,"--I'm not convinced it's right, Justice Scalia, but what is clear is that consolidation after the window opened again has happened in Bossier Parish."
1996.95-1455,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3448.944,3450.847,"Thank you, Mr. Patrick."
1996.95-1455,3,21392,deval_l_patrick,,3450.847,3451.227,--Thank you.
1996.95-1455,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3451.227,3452.477,The case is submitted.
