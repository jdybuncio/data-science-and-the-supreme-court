1987.86-1824,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.778,"We will hear argument now in Number 86-1824, Michigan against Michael Chesternut."
1987.86-1824,0,17084,andrea_l_solak,,12.088,30.661,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, on December 19th, 1984, at approximately 12:30 p.m., four plainclothes officers were on a routine patrol in the City of Detroit in a standard police car, black in color with markings at the side door."
1987.86-1824,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,53.067,54.278,This was in the city of Detroit?
1987.86-1824,0,17084,andrea_l_solak,,54.278,55.941,"It was, Your Honor."
1987.86-1824,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,88.534,90.665,"Where were they, on the ground?"
1987.86-1824,0,17084,andrea_l_solak,,90.665,92.325,They had been tossed to the sidewalk.
1987.86-1824,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,92.846,97.841,"The respondent was seen to toss them, did you say?"
1987.86-1824,0,17084,andrea_l_solak,,97.841,101.293,"Yes, he was observed to have tossed them from his righthand pocket."
1987.86-1824,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,165.176,178.554,"Ms. Solak, is it your position then that a police chase never implicates the Fourth Amendment until the person being chased is actually stopped or seized?"
1987.86-1824,0,17084,andrea_l_solak,,178.554,186.541,"That is my position, and that seizure, of course, could take place by actual physical restraint by the officer."
1987.86-1824,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,186.541,192.886,You mean even if the red lights were flashing and the siren was blazing and the guns were drawn?
1987.86-1824,0,17084,andrea_l_solak,,192.886,201.594,"That is correct, even if there were perhaps that show of authority, unless and until the capture, if you will, takes place, there is no seizure."
1987.86-1824,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,201.594,212.37,"You wouldn't say the same thing if you were riding in a car, would you, and a policeman came up behind you and turned on his red lights and his siren?"
1987.86-1824,0,17084,andrea_l_solak,,214.71,224.107,"Most citizens do usually acquiesce, and under my standard if the citizen did pull over and it was in response to an official show of authority, that would be a seizure."
1987.86-1824,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,224.107,227.149,"Well, how about an official show of authority like red lights and a siren?"
1987.86-1824,0,17084,andrea_l_solak,,227.149,236.075,"And if the citizen were to have acquiesced to those red lights and a siren, I believe a seizure would have taken place."
1987.86-1824,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,244.212,252.737,"Well, this citizen in this case, he understood that the police were chasing... she understood the police were chasing here, I guess."
1987.86-1824,0,17084,andrea_l_solak,,252.737,253.638,Yes--
1987.86-1824,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,253.638,255.479,"She stopped, anyway, didn't she?"
1987.86-1824,0,17084,andrea_l_solak,,255.479,257.289,--He did ultimately stop.
1987.86-1824,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,257.289,258.42,Is that a he or a she?
1987.86-1824,0,17084,andrea_l_solak,,258.42,259.392,"It was a he, Michael."
1987.86-1824,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,259.392,259.752,All right.
1987.86-1824,0,17084,andrea_l_solak,,259.752,261.382,"Yes, he did ultimately stop."
1987.86-1824,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,261.382,264.715,"He knew he was about to be seized, didn't he?"
1987.86-1824,0,17084,andrea_l_solak,,264.715,271.698,"He knew... the court believed that he had reason to anticipate a capture, but he did not in fact stop."
1987.86-1824,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,271.698,272.409,He knew he was about to be seized.
1987.86-1824,0,17084,andrea_l_solak,,276.633,278.753,This was seconds before the seizure.
1987.86-1824,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,283.579,286.16,"Counsel, do you take the position that he knew he was about to be seized?"
1987.86-1824,0,17084,andrea_l_solak,,286.99,288.19,"--No, I do not."
1987.86-1824,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,290.753,294.227,"If you don't, why did he throw the stuff away?"
1987.86-1824,0,17084,andrea_l_solak,,294.227,301.49,"The defendant's conduct in abandoning may not have been an intelligent decision, but I would argue that--"
1987.86-1824,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,301.49,303.782,Did he have any other reason to throw it away?
1987.86-1824,0,17084,andrea_l_solak,,303.782,306.363,--Other than the presence of the police?
1987.86-1824,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,306.363,306.603,Yes.
1987.86-1824,0,17084,andrea_l_solak,,306.603,307.685,"No, he did not."
1987.86-1824,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,342.71,355.219,"Well, Ms. Solak, what if the police had a chance to speak to the person and say stop, we want to talk to you, and he then takes off and they pursue?"
1987.86-1824,0,17084,andrea_l_solak,,355.219,364.716,This Court has recognized that police-citizen encounters of the sort that you might have described are appropriate on some occasion.
1987.86-1824,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,367.45,370.091,Can that be a seizure under the Fourth Amenmdent?
1987.86-1824,0,17084,andrea_l_solak,,370.091,378.976,"I don't believe in Mendenhall versus Royer that merely the entre by an officer, I would like to speak to you, would constitute a seizure."
1987.86-1824,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,378.976,379.887,He says stop.
1987.86-1824,0,17084,andrea_l_solak,,379.887,387.674,Saying stop and asserting perhaps police presence would certainly add a factor into an assessment of a show of authority.
1987.86-1824,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,387.674,393.658,"Well, is a show of authority enough to implicate the Fourth Amendment then?"
1987.86-1824,0,17084,andrea_l_solak,,393.658,399.121,"No, I do not believe that it is enough to implicate the Fourth Amendment."
1987.86-1824,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,498.94,503.182,"There was a seizure here, wasn't there?"
1987.86-1824,0,17084,andrea_l_solak,,503.182,504.404,In this case?
1987.86-1824,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,504.404,505.125,Yes.
1987.86-1824,0,17084,andrea_l_solak,,505.125,508.427,In this case there was ultimately a probable cause seizure.
1987.86-1824,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,508.427,510.641,"No, no, no, there was a seizure of the effects."
1987.86-1824,0,17084,andrea_l_solak,,510.641,521.73,"The people would not... the petitioner would not concede that in fact there was a seizure, just as we suggested--"
1987.86-1824,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,521.73,524.432,"Well, the officer picked up the packets."
1987.86-1824,0,17084,andrea_l_solak,,527.965,529.434,--The officer did pick up the--
1987.86-1824,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,529.434,530.285,What justified that?
1987.86-1824,0,17084,andrea_l_solak,,530.285,531.307,--Pardon me?
1987.86-1824,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,531.307,532.809,What justified that?
1987.86-1824,0,17084,andrea_l_solak,,532.809,535.851,There was an abandonment of the packet.
1987.86-1824,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,556.624,562.779,"What was held was that the abandonment was the fruit of an unlawful seizure, I guess."
1987.86-1824,0,17084,andrea_l_solak,,562.779,573.087,"I believe the Court of Appeals held, the Michigan Court of Appeals held that the abandonment was the fruit of an unlawful seizure of the person by virtue of the pursuit."
1987.86-1824,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,601.464,608.52,"The decision was based on the Shabaz case, wasn't it?"
1987.86-1824,0,17084,andrea_l_solak,,608.52,609.391,"Yes, it was."
1987.86-1824,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,609.391,611.724,Which is not a federal case.
1987.86-1824,0,17084,andrea_l_solak,,611.724,613.785,"No, it is indeed a Michigan case."
1987.86-1824,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,804.832,817.36,But in any event you say that there was reason enough to... seizure of the packets was legal wholly aside from any seizure of the person?
1987.86-1824,0,17084,andrea_l_solak,,817.36,820.342,"I do indeed say that, Your Honor, that the seizure was legal."
1987.86-1824,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,820.342,825.625,"Because they were abandoned, or because he had given up any privacy?"
1987.86-1824,0,17084,andrea_l_solak,,825.625,828.437,"He had given up any privacy rights as well, yes."
1987.86-1824,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,828.437,830.578,And the officers could not only seize them but open them?
1987.86-1824,0,17084,andrea_l_solak,,830.578,836.141,"He inspected the pills, yes, and found them to be suspected narcotics."
1987.86-1824,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,836.141,838.775,But he had to open the packets to see the pills?
1987.86-1824,0,17084,andrea_l_solak,,838.775,840.355,"He did open the packets, yes."
1987.86-1824,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,840.355,844.128,I don't understand what happened here.
1987.86-1824,0,17084,andrea_l_solak,,848.431,852.485,"Yes, he ran approximately five feet further and simply stopped."
1987.86-1824,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,852.485,855.026,That is very strange.
1987.86-1824,0,17084,andrea_l_solak,,856.576,858.659,There is no explanation.
1987.86-1824,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,863.622,869.606,Does the record show that one police officer was detaining him while the other was inspecting the packets?
1987.86-1824,0,17084,andrea_l_solak,,869.606,881.593,"No, in fact, I believe the record indicates that the officer who testified was the only one to have gotten out of the car, inspected the packets, and then arrested the defendant."
1987.86-1824,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,881.593,885.156,And the defendant just stands there while all this is happening?
1987.86-1824,0,17084,andrea_l_solak,,885.156,886.398,That's correct.
1987.86-1824,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,887.958,895.985,"--supposed to stay there, or he wouldn't have, but he just was mistaken, I guess."
1987.86-1824,0,17084,andrea_l_solak,,895.985,900.69,He was mistaken and perhaps his conduct in retrospect was not wise.
1987.86-1824,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,989.348,995.853,But if he had not dropped the packets on the sidewalk would the police have detained him at all?
1987.86-1824,0,17084,andrea_l_solak,,995.853,1001.497,"In this case, of course, the act of dropping the packets--"
1987.86-1824,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1001.497,1003.05,"But I say, if that had not happened."
1987.86-1824,0,17084,andrea_l_solak,,1003.05,1008.742,"--Under our position, the police could have engaged in some kind of consensual encounter."
1987.86-1824,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1018.519,1024.473,"You think just running away justified a Terry stop, a forceful Terry stop?"
1987.86-1824,0,17084,andrea_l_solak,,1024.473,1028.497,I do believe that running from the site of a police officer--
1987.86-1824,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1028.497,1029.516,"That issue isn't here, right?"
1987.86-1824,0,17084,andrea_l_solak,,1029.516,1045.517,"--No, actually, that issue is not factually presented, because in fact the respondent ran from an encounter on the corner with another individual, and that flight was precipitated then by the observation of the police."
1987.86-1824,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1045.517,1049.45,"You make that argument, don't you?"
1987.86-1824,0,17084,andrea_l_solak,,1054.996,1056.506,"That is our second argument, yes."
1987.86-1824,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1056.506,1059.661,So you would also argue they could have pulled him over and stopped him and frisked him--
1987.86-1824,0,17084,andrea_l_solak,,1059.661,1061.03,"Yes, that is my argument."
1987.86-1824,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1077.991,1081.774,--I thought a Terry stop gave you authority to make a frisk for weapons.
1987.86-1824,0,17084,andrea_l_solak,,1084.215,1088.987,I do not take the position that in and of itself he would have been subject to a frisk.
1987.86-1824,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1089.397,1092.349,But he would have been just subject to questioning.
1987.86-1824,0,17084,andrea_l_solak,,1092.349,1094.722,"At best, brief questioning."
1987.86-1824,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1094.722,1097.795,"What if he had said, I am sorry, I'd rather not talk to you?"
1987.86-1824,0,17084,andrea_l_solak,,1097.795,1101.248,At that point in time it is fish or cut bait.
1987.86-1824,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1122.182,1123.965,The flight itself would not justify it?
1987.86-1824,0,17084,andrea_l_solak,,1123.965,1130.476,"No, what would have then found is that there was no further reason for the definition."
1987.86-1824,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1168.316,1170.757,"Thank you, Ms. Solak."
1987.86-1824,1,20027,carole_m_stanyar,,1173.879,1206.779,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this case concerns the parameters of Fourth Amendment protection where an individual's invocation of the right to go on his way is met by a police chase by four officers in a marked police cruiser."
1987.86-1824,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1268.09,1269.773,"Ms. Stanyar, you use the word ""pursue""."
1987.86-1824,1,20027,carole_m_stanyar,,1272.033,1275.937,"--Well, Your Honor, is perused any different than following?"
1987.86-1824,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1275.937,1278.01,"--Yes, are you using it in any different sense than followed?"
1987.86-1824,1,20027,carole_m_stanyar,,1288.529,1295.114,"Your Honor, I am using the term ""pursue"" as being synonymous with following and as distinct from chasing."
1987.86-1824,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1370.988,1372.609,At what point did it become a seizure?
1987.86-1824,1,20027,carole_m_stanyar,,1372.609,1398.116,"At the very latest, Your Honor, respondent contends that this became a seizure after these officers had chased him and overtaken him and were running the cruiser parallel with him, because at that point you have conveyance, or the officers convey a message to Mr. Chesternut that, Number One, they are going to stop him immediately, that he has done something wrong to warrant being stopped."
1987.86-1824,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1415.189,1417.951,"Ms. Stanyar, can I ask some more about the circumstances before you get any further?"
1987.86-1824,1,20027,carole_m_stanyar,,1424.415,1424.775,--No.
1987.86-1824,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1424.775,1431.72,"We have to take this case on the assumption that there were no sirens going, no lights flashing, because there is no indication that there were."
1987.86-1824,1,20027,carole_m_stanyar,,1431.72,1433.022,There is no record reference to it either way.
1987.86-1824,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1433.022,1436.465,You say the car had to slow down.
1987.86-1824,1,20027,carole_m_stanyar,,1445.62,1449.143,"Your Honor, once they caught him, they slowed down."
1987.86-1824,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1458.67,1460.994,And they were cruising next to him for some--
1987.86-1824,1,20027,carole_m_stanyar,,1460.994,1470.279,"The record doesn't indicate how long they would have been cruising next to him, but the officer indicated... the term he used was, they were ""running parallel with him""."
1987.86-1824,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1471.749,1476.313,"--And again, we don't know that they said anything to him, that they said stop or--"
1987.86-1824,1,20027,carole_m_stanyar,,1476.313,1478.114,The record doesn't indicate either way.
1987.86-1824,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1478.114,1481.486,--So we assume for purposes of the case that they didn't.
1987.86-1824,1,20027,carole_m_stanyar,,1481.486,1482.278,Correct.
1987.86-1824,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1482.278,1505.847,"Ms. Stanyar, what if I am driving my automobile on the public highway and a police car marked as such and containing four officers gets behind me and follows me on the highway, or perhaps catches up with me and drives alongside me along the highway, and I don't like it."

1987.86-1824,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1521.015,1523.328,How would it differ from your case do you think?
1987.86-1824,1,20027,carole_m_stanyar,,1523.328,1528.161,--It strikes me as being less intimidating because you have two vehicles that are already traveling along the highway.
1987.86-1824,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1537.808,1543.972,It intimidates me to have a police car following me and going alongside me on the highway.
1987.86-1824,1,20027,carole_m_stanyar,,1543.972,1552.957,"--In order for your example to be a seizure under the Fourth Amendment, your feelings of being intimated must be reasonable, objectively."
1987.86-1824,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1552.957,1555.669,And you think that is not objectively reasonable?
1987.86-1824,1,20027,carole_m_stanyar,,1555.669,1562.975,I don't think it is as intimidating as a chase by a police cruiser after a pedestrian.
1987.86-1824,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1562.975,1572.221,"But if I were jogging along the parkway and the police cruiser comes up along side and keeps up with me, that would be different?"
1987.86-1824,1,20027,carole_m_stanyar,,1572.221,1583.511,"In terms of your use of the phrase keeps up with you, I think that is different than what we have here, because we have an individual who is unequivocally running away from a police officer."

1987.86-1824,1,20027,carole_m_stanyar,,1610.979,1612.809,How did he know he was being chased?
1987.86-1824,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1612.809,1613.27,Yes.
1987.86-1824,1,20027,carole_m_stanyar,,1613.27,1622.296,"According to the record, Mr. Chesternut had looked in the direction of the police cruiser before beginning to run."

1987.86-1824,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1641.26,1644.322,How did he know it was chasing him and not me?
1987.86-1824,1,20027,carole_m_stanyar,,1644.322,1648.764,"--Well, Your Honor, he was the only one on the side street that day."
1987.86-1824,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1650.356,1653.207,The car might have just been going down the same way.
1987.86-1824,1,20027,carole_m_stanyar,,1653.207,1656.46,"--Well, the record reflects--"
1987.86-1824,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1656.46,1658.09,Suppose it was going to get a pizza.
1987.86-1824,1,20027,carole_m_stanyar,,1659.802,1662.454,--The officer or Mr. Chsternut--
1987.86-1824,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1662.454,1663.115,The officer.
1987.86-1824,1,20027,carole_m_stanyar,,1663.453,1663.724,--Okay.
1987.86-1824,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1665.847,1666.545,They do at times.
1987.86-1824,1,20027,carole_m_stanyar,,1666.545,1667.686,"--They do, Your Honor."
1987.86-1824,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1672.22,1673.95,Could it be he had a guilty conscience?
1987.86-1824,1,20027,carole_m_stanyar,,1673.95,1674.761,--My client?
1987.86-1824,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1674.761,1676.043,Yes.
1987.86-1824,1,20027,carole_m_stanyar,,1676.043,1704.022,"Whether or not he believes... whether or not his subjective feelings make him believe he is nervous or whatever, Your Honor, I think that the critical factor here is the objective circumstances as viewed by the individual, and the objective circumstances here are that Mr. Chesternut ran and these officers chased after him, overtook him, and then proceeded to run parallel with him, and I think that conveys to him that, Number One, that this is the man that we are after."
1987.86-1824,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1704.022,1710.139,Would you be worried if a cruiser went beside you walking down the street?
1987.86-1824,1,20027,carole_m_stanyar,,1710.139,1713.279,If I had run from them.
1987.86-1824,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1713.279,1715.512,I didn't add anything to it.
1987.86-1824,1,20027,carole_m_stanyar,,1715.512,1717.663,"Okay, if I were walking down the street and a cruiser came--"
1987.86-1824,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1717.663,1719.142,On your way to church.
1987.86-1824,1,20027,carole_m_stanyar,,1719.142,1721.786,"--No, I don't think I would be--"
1987.86-1824,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1721.786,1723.897,"You wouldn't be worried at all, would you?"
1987.86-1824,1,20027,carole_m_stanyar,,1723.897,1724.037,"--No, I wouldn't."
1987.86-1824,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1724.037,1729.891,Aren't there some situations in which you might be mighty glad to see the cruiser come up alongside you?
1987.86-1824,1,20027,carole_m_stanyar,,1729.891,1730.151,"Yes, Your Honor."
1987.86-1824,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1730.151,1732.584,"And you might be running at the time, too."
1987.86-1824,1,20027,carole_m_stanyar,,1732.584,1733.995,"Yes, Your Honor."
1987.86-1824,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1733.995,1734.445,Yes.
1987.86-1824,1,20027,carole_m_stanyar,,1734.445,1736.968,I think those would present a different fact situation.
1987.86-1824,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1738.239,1738.628,May I ask a question?
1987.86-1824,1,20027,carole_m_stanyar,,1779.518,1779.668,"--No, Your Honor."
1987.86-1824,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1780.86,1781.548,"Well, why is this any different?"
1987.86-1824,1,20027,carole_m_stanyar,,1781.548,1781.798,--All right.
1987.86-1824,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1793.846,1797.119,"No, the purpose I want them to chase them is to ask them, what are you running from us for?"
1987.86-1824,1,20027,carole_m_stanyar,,1814.411,1825.438,"--I think that if all the officers were going to do in your example was to cruise along and see what is up by seeing where he was going, they could have done that in a number of less intrusive ways."
1987.86-1824,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1886.827,1899.596,"Well, suppose in the hypothetical I gave you this police car in my neighborhood just cruises alongside the person running and rolls down the window and says, is something the matter, I saw you, you know, lighting out, what is going on?"
1987.86-1824,1,20027,carole_m_stanyar,,1900.557,1918.168,"That strikes me as somewhat less intimidating than the case that we have here because you have some sort of reassurance to the individual, but I still believe that you have the same problem in terms of the individual is exercising his right to go on his way, and these officers are not allowing him to do that."
1987.86-1824,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1918.168,1919.33,"Well, we don't know what would have happened here."
1987.86-1824,1,20027,carole_m_stanyar,,1938.493,1941.466,"I don't believe that it would be, and secondly, Your Honor--"
1987.86-1824,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1941.466,1943.959,"Just in my neighborhood it is okay, but not in this neighborhood?"
1987.86-1824,1,20027,carole_m_stanyar,,1943.959,1958.437,"--Well, Your Honor, I think that the chase which occurred in this case, the way the aggressive and confrontational action the police officers took in this case belie any reasonable inference that their only purpose was to question Mr. Chesternut."
1987.86-1824,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1958.437,1959.038,Why?
1987.86-1824,1,20027,carole_m_stanyar,,1966.724,1967.985,"Correct, and I think that--"
1987.86-1824,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1967.985,1971.848,"We should assume that he is on the way to church, as Justice Marshall said."
1987.86-1824,1,20027,carole_m_stanyar,,1971.848,1981.996,"--Your Honor, I believe that the correct standard is to take the objective circumstances as they appear to a reasonable individual, and I think that the way this occurred, we have a four on one situation."
1987.86-1824,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2000.428,2005.423,"Let me ask you a question, Ms. Stanyar, about one of your responses to Justice Scalia's question."
1987.86-1824,1,20027,carole_m_stanyar,,2020.467,2025.381,--Our position is that what occurred here was more than their mere presence on the street.
1987.86-1824,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2027.895,2039.663,"Okay, whatever the police did, that that not only ultimately resulted in a seizure of the defendant, but that just before that it forced him to get rid of those packets."
1987.86-1824,1,20027,carole_m_stanyar,,2039.663,2040.183,--Right.
1987.86-1824,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2040.183,2041.876,Why do you say it forced him to?
1987.86-1824,1,20027,carole_m_stanyar,,2041.876,2057.897,"As a factual matter, Your Honor, I think those two questions merge for the individual, the question of whether or not these officers are going to stop him and whether or not they are going to search him, because a detention is really a euphemism for what the individual really thinks is going to happen to him out there."
1987.86-1824,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2058.357,2061.92,"Well, it isn't a totally subjective thing at all."
1987.86-1824,1,20027,carole_m_stanyar,,2068.806,2077.902,"--What this Court, I believe, has said is that the objective standard of what a reasonable person would believe that is going to happen."
1987.86-1824,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2109.704,2111.394,And find the dope.
1987.86-1824,1,20027,carole_m_stanyar,,2121.362,2121.512,--All right.
1987.86-1824,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2154.414,2159.178,Have we ever applied the Brown versus Illinois or Wong Sun standards to abandonments?
1987.86-1824,1,20027,carole_m_stanyar,,2159.178,2162.822,"I don't know... that you have, Your Honor."
1987.86-1824,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2278.547,2290.525,"What would the normal police officer in your mind do if he drove up beside a man and the man all of a sudden looked and saw the police car, and took off?"
1987.86-1824,1,20027,carole_m_stanyar,,2290.525,2293.527,What could he do under those circumstances?
1987.86-1824,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2293.527,2294.488,What do you think he should do?
1987.86-1824,1,20027,carole_m_stanyar,,2294.488,2298.071,"I think he could continue to investigate, Your Honor."
1987.86-1824,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2298.071,2298.762,Should what?
1987.86-1824,1,20027,carole_m_stanyar,,2298.762,2301.145,He could continue to investigate in a variety of--
1987.86-1824,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2301.145,2302.074,By doing what?
1987.86-1824,1,20027,carole_m_stanyar,,2302.074,2303.957,--He could follow the man.
1987.86-1824,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2306.201,2308.121,That is what they did here.
1987.86-1824,1,20027,carole_m_stanyar,,2308.121,2318.359,"The officer admitted in this case, and I think it is critical that the officer describes this as a chase, and I think... I am asking the Court to credit that characterization because it probably--"
1987.86-1824,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2318.359,2323.251,Does it become a chase because of what the officers did or what he did?
1987.86-1824,1,20027,carole_m_stanyar,,2323.251,2324.683,"--Well, I think that--"
1987.86-1824,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2324.683,2326.363,Who started the movement?
1987.86-1824,1,20027,carole_m_stanyar,,2326.363,2335.7,"--That's correct, we don't claim that Mr. Chesternut's running in the first instance was preceded by any police illegality."
1987.86-1824,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2340.344,2346.257,"Well, when somebody in the street starts running, shouldn't an officer be interested in why he is running?"
1987.86-1824,1,20027,carole_m_stanyar,,2346.257,2346.408,--Yes.
1987.86-1824,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2348.691,2350.011,That's what happened here.
1987.86-1824,1,20027,carole_m_stanyar,,2350.011,2358.907,"--What happened in this case was, I think that they may have had a legitimate purpose in terms of to see where he was going, but when they chose to chase him, aggressively confronting him to find out--"
1987.86-1824,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2358.907,2362.359,What is the difference between seeing where he is going and chasing him?
1987.86-1824,1,20027,carole_m_stanyar,,2362.359,2369.355,--I think the act of following... the act of seeing where he is going is inherently different than the act of chasing.
1987.86-1824,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2374.328,2375.991,"Ms. Solak, I really don't care where he is going."
1987.86-1824,1,20027,carole_m_stanyar,,2381.624,2383.703,"No, I don't believe that was their purpose."

1987.86-1824,1,20027,carole_m_stanyar,,2409.392,2412.315,--constitutes a reasonable suspicion of criminal activity.
1987.86-1824,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2470.76,2480.476,"--Flight alone is not enough for what, for probable cause to arrest, or for a reasonable articulable suspicion to make a Terry stop?"
1987.86-1824,1,20027,carole_m_stanyar,,2480.476,2481.505,"--The latter, Your Honor."
1987.86-1824,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2506.273,2506.673,Excuse me.
1987.86-1824,1,20027,carole_m_stanyar,,2528.8,2529.701,"I agree, Your Honor."
1987.86-1824,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2646.433,2659.283,"Ms. Stanyar, are you going to abandon the point or do you just don't recognize the point that the court decided this on state grounds and not federal grounds?"
1987.86-1824,1,20027,carole_m_stanyar,,2659.283,2662.685,"Your Honor, in my reading... no, I haven't abandoned it."
1987.86-1824,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2675.135,2675.436,Are you abandoning it?
1987.86-1824,1,20027,carole_m_stanyar,,2675.436,2677.138,"--No, I don't abandon it."
1987.86-1824,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2678.858,2680.01,Have you abandoned it or not?
1987.86-1824,1,20027,carole_m_stanyar,,2680.01,2681.488,"--I don't abandon it, Your Honor."
1987.86-1824,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2681.488,2682.7,You just leave it.
1987.86-1824,1,20027,carole_m_stanyar,,2682.7,2684.29,Your Honor--
1987.86-1824,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2684.29,2685.802,Unsupported.
1987.86-1824,1,20027,carole_m_stanyar,,2685.802,2686.463,--Well--
1987.86-1824,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2686.463,2687.243,It is all right with me.
1987.86-1824,1,20027,carole_m_stanyar,,2688.875,2698.262,--I understood the lower court's decision as resting totally on an interpretation of the federal Constitution.
1987.86-1824,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2707.629,2708.448,I regret I brought it up.
1987.86-1824,1,20027,carole_m_stanyar,,2708.448,2722.98,"By defining a seizure exclusively as a detention, petitioner is offering the Court another litmus paper test that bears no reasonable relation to the issue to be decided or to the realities of the situation."

1987.86-1824,1,20027,carole_m_stanyar,,2856.249,2857.2,--I think it would have been.

1987.86-1824,1,20027,carole_m_stanyar,,2879.096,2882.198,--I believe that it would be.
1987.86-1824,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2896.589,2898.422,How much of a chase was it?
