2012.12-133,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,6.57,"This is Case Number 12-133, American Express v. Italian Colors Restaurant."
2012.12-133,0,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,7.57,10.456,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2012.12-133,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,42.677,74.398,"Mr. Kellogg, suppose it goes to arbitration as you think it should, and the arbitrator says to the merchant, to prove your case, you have to show the relevant market, you have to show that American Express has market power, that it used that power to the detriment of its competitors, and the way these sections -- the way these kinds of cases have gone is to get an expert."
2012.12-133,0,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,99.347,103.166,"Well, three responses to that, Your Honor."
2012.12-133,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,145.909,147.945,What was the -- what was the -- I missed that.
2012.12-133,0,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,159.252,167.489,--We acknowledge below that they could share costs among multiple plaintiffs--
2012.12-133,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,167.489,167.772,Oh.
2012.12-133,0,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,167.772,168.358,--before that.
2012.12-133,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,173.843,184.483,"And then what you would you have, five, six different arbitrations going, and in each of those five or six cases, you would have -- they could share?"
2012.12-133,0,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,189.385,190.235,--They can share the cost of the expert.
2012.12-133,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,224.806,227.758,"I -- I'm sorry, but I don't think I got the answer to my question."
2012.12-133,0,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,253.391,265.383,"As we said, they would be able to share an expert between multiple plaintiffs, but there is no guarantee in the law that every claim has a procedural path to its effective vindication."
2012.12-133,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,295.318,309.16,"Mr. Kellogg, do you think that if in your arbitration agreement you had a clause which just said, I hereby agree not to bring any Sherman Act claim against American Express, could -- could your arbitration agreement do that?"
2012.12-133,0,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,309.16,312.179,"Under this Court's decision in Mitsubishi, I believe not."
2012.12-133,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,312.179,321.468,"It -- it couldn't, right, because we would say no, there has to be an -- an opportunity for a vindication of statutory rights; is that right?"
2012.12-133,0,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,321.468,322.168,Correct.
2012.12-133,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,322.168,325.087,And -- and suppose that the arbitration clause said something different.
2012.12-133,0,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,337.695,349.417,"I think that would be subject to review under State unconscionability principles, and would probably be struck down, Your Honor, just like any other provision that essentially prevents--"
2012.12-133,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,349.417,365.028,"Well, even putting aside State unconscionability principles, wouldn't you think that our Mitsubishi case and our Randolph case would again come in and say, my gosh, this arbitration clause prevents any effective vindication of the rights to bring an antitrust suit."
2012.12-133,0,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,365.612,369.247,"--I -- I don't think Mitsubishi can be read that broadly, Your Honor."
2012.12-133,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,380.305,380.771,So you think -- I'm sorry.
2012.12-133,0,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,381.071,381.521,--I'm sorry.
2012.12-133,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,400.118,421.548,"So I just want to make sure I understand your answer, which is that you read Mitsubishi and Randolph as so narrow that you would say that the principle that they embody does not prevent American Express from saying, you cannot produce -- you cannot use any economic expert or any economic testimony in an antitrust suit."
2012.12-133,0,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,421.548,426.686,"You know, I think the better place to handle that would be State unconscionability law."
2012.12-133,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,448.198,453.502,"Well, my -- my question is not about class procedures, it's about allowing economic evidence to help prove your claim."
2012.12-133,0,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,463.291,464.108,--Correct.
2012.12-133,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,464.108,479.15,"And you said that's fine, because you're going to read Mitsubishi and Randolph in such a way that it allows an arbitration clause to 100 percent effectively absolutely frustrate your ability to bring a Sherman Act suit."
2012.12-133,0,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,479.15,483.187,I have no doubt that such a provision would be struck down.
2012.12-133,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,513.387,537.42,"Well, I think -- I think what they are saying is something a little bit different, which is that if you go -- if you accept my premise that the arbitration clause could not say no economic evidence, what the Respondents here are saying is, well, now you have to give us the ability to produce economic evidence and maybe that involves class procedures, maybe it involves something else."
2012.12-133,0,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,554.964,556.814,"Well, I think -- I think not true."
2012.12-133,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,630.695,639.301,"--I thought the only thing that the court of appeals said is, you have to pay 300,000 minimum for the expert, the most you can get in treble damages is 5,000."
2012.12-133,0,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,651.109,660.132,--And nobody in their right mind in Eisen would pay a million dollars in notice costs to get $70 on--
2012.12-133,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,660.132,666.786,"I guess you could have said the same thing under the Sherman Act before Rule 23 existed, right?"
2012.12-133,0,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,666.786,667.652,--You could have.
2012.12-133,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,667.652,668.668,Before there was such as thing as class actions.
2012.12-133,0,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,668.668,669.302,Under that position--
2012.12-133,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,669.302,670.604,The same thing would have been true.
2012.12-133,0,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,681.393,682.826,--That was true.
2012.12-133,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,715.397,719.851,Do you think the nature of their underlying -- their antitrust claim is relevant to this?
2012.12-133,0,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,732.342,734.778,"Well, a couple of points on that."
2012.12-133,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,763.795,785.391,"In the AT&T Mobility case, the Court remarked that this was a -- that the arbitration agreement had certain provisions that made it easier for the consumer to use the arbitral forum."
2012.12-133,0,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,789.093,792.812,"I'm sorry, I didn't -- I didn't quite follow that, Your Honor."
2012.12-133,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,796.347,812.124,"Yes, where not some other consumer in another arbitration, not that sharing of the costs, but wasn't AT&T Mobility going to pick up a good part of the tab of the cost of the arbitration?"
2012.12-133,0,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,812.124,820.379,"--That's correct, there were provisions in AT&T that the Court said would make small value claims easier to process."
2012.12-133,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,837.607,855.968,"One of the ways I have been thinking about this case is to think about arbitration and the whole point of arbitration is to have a procedure where you don't have costs, you have as an arbitrator an antitrust expert or the best in the class in the third year antitrust course in law school."
2012.12-133,0,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,890.659,893.51,"I did not mean to imply that, Your Honor."
2012.12-133,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,934.086,946.16,"Mr. Kellogg, are you suggesting that you can win an antitrust suit in arbitration without presenting economic evidence of such things as monopoly power, antitrust injury, damages?"
2012.12-133,0,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,947.928,953.08,"No, I acknowledge that they would probably need a report in this case."
2012.12-133,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,953.08,954.265,Why?
2012.12-133,0,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,969.106,970.372,"Well, I -- perhaps I--"
2012.12-133,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,970.372,970.955,Do you want to concede--
2012.12-133,0,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,970.955,972.472,--conceded too much to Justice Kagan.
2012.12-133,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,972.472,973.388,"--Yes, maybe."
2012.12-133,0,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,973.872,981.844,"But in this case, if you look at the complaint, the market definition that they're seeking to establish is, if I might put it, somewhat gerrymandered."
2012.12-133,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,982.744,987.146,"If you want to argue that stuff, which I -- then I guess maybe they're right."
2012.12-133,0,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,998.187,1000.472,"--I did not mean to concede that at all, Your Honor."
2012.12-133,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1037.412,1043.735,"Well, Mr. Kellogg, could I go back to Justice Alito's point, because I'm not sure I quite understood your -- your answer to it."
2012.12-133,0,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,1101.422,1111.21,"Well, there is a separate issue below which the court did not reach about whether the arbitration clause itself had been improperly imposed."
2012.12-133,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1158.607,1169.997,"Did -- did American Express say, as Justice Breyer suggested, that, well, we will concede A, B, and C, so the only issue on which you need proof is D?"
2012.12-133,0,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,1183.739,1190.726,"Well, Your Honor, we took the position even in district court that they could pool their resources--"
2012.12-133,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1190.726,1192.509,"No, I'm not talking about--"
2012.12-133,0,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,1192.509,1193.278,--and share the cost of the claim.
2012.12-133,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1193.278,1199.499,--I'm not talking about pooling with other single merchants bringing single arbitrations.
2012.12-133,0,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,1234.005,1236.874,"Well, that's -- that's not actually correct."
2012.12-133,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1252.383,1257.703,"I suppose that American Express wouldn't have had to agree to arbitration at all, right?"
2012.12-133,0,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,1265.39,1265.674,We could.
2012.12-133,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1266.14,1274.996,"And until Rule 23 was adopted, that would mean, you know, if you had a small claim, tough luck, right?"
2012.12-133,0,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,1286.22,1286.887,--Correct.
2012.12-133,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1289.572,1296.059,I'm a little confused about this business about pooling resources and whether it's prohibited or permitted.
2012.12-133,0,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,1298.511,1309.3,Our position is that multiple claimants in arbitration could share the costs of an expert for preparation of a report.
2012.12-133,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1309.3,1315.12,"Well, it seems to me -- I don't see how that concession is at all needed by the other side."
2012.12-133,0,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,1329.93,1332.832,"That -- no problem with that, and that's absolutely right."
2012.12-133,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1346.242,1350.043,"But they could borrow the money from a lawyer instead of from the trade association, right?"
2012.12-133,0,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,1350.043,1355.947,"--Well, or from a hedge fund, which increasingly finances litigation."
2012.12-133,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1355.947,1356.53,"Well, again, that doesn't seem too difficult."
2012.12-133,0,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,1377.193,1377.859,Absolutely right.
2012.12-133,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1377.859,1378.625,Okay.
2012.12-133,0,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,1379.725,1380.894,I have no problem with that.
2012.12-133,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1384.429,1385.195,"And, Mr. Kellogg--"
2012.12-133,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1385.195,1385.795,"I'm sorry, I'm sorry."
2012.12-133,0,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,1394.635,1395.335,That is unclear.
2012.12-133,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1404.073,1404.657,--Okay.
2012.12-133,0,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,1404.657,1407.525,I couldn't find anything in the arbitration contract.
2012.12-133,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1407.525,1417.832,"--Just to be sure I understand it, that you're saying that it does not violate the confidentiality agreement of this clause to -- to all get together and produce one report?"
2012.12-133,0,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,1417.832,1418.699,Correct.
2012.12-133,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1418.699,1419.266,Okay.
2012.12-133,0,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,1419.266,1429.038,"And if you look at actually the affidavit put in by the plaintiff's expert and you look at all the things he says I need to study in my report, they're all issues in common."
2012.12-133,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1431.224,1437.978,"And did -- did you say that below as well, that -- that the confidentiality clause does not sweep so widely as to prevent this?"
2012.12-133,0,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,1445.3,1451.221,--The Second Circuit did say that after we suggested that they could pool resources.
2012.12-133,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1463.295,1468.415,So but you're saying the confidentiality position would not apply in that circumstance.
2012.12-133,0,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,1468.415,1469.331,It would not apply.
2012.12-133,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1473.467,1474.402,"Thank you, counsel."
2012.12-133,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1477.437,1479.937,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2012.12-133,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1528.886,1540.177,I don't see -- I don't see how a Federal statute is frustrated or is unable to be vindicated if it's too expensive to bring a Federal suit.
2012.12-133,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1549.217,1551.319,"Well, Justice Scalia, let me take--"
2012.12-133,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1551.319,1559.773,And I don't see why it's any different when you transpose the situation to the -- to the arbitration situation.
2012.12-133,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1559.773,1566.579,"--Justice Scalia, let me take on the premise and then we get -- then also say where really the concern comes in for the differential treatment."
2012.12-133,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1615.075,1618.127,"Before you get to that, I have two questions."
2012.12-133,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1678.002,1690.326,"Well, you could do it by category, and I suppose you could treat antitrust claims differently, but I think there's an answer that's already built into the Court's cases, which is Randolph, and it's putting the burden on the plaintiff to make a nonspeculative showing."
2012.12-133,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1695.713,1703.717,"No, what I'll do, because I work with my own hypothetical, I'll have a far-out case, but yet not quite speculative."
2012.12-133,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1730.451,1732.284,"--Well -- well, don't be too concerned, Justice Breyer."
2012.12-133,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1746.911,1748.427,"Well, that sounds expert to me."
2012.12-133,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1820.289,1825.092,"--Well, I mean, Justice Breyer, none of us can know for sure what Professor Arita would say."
2012.12-133,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1830.611,1831.846,In arbitration or in court?
2012.12-133,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1831.846,1833.663,--He says in arbitration or anywhere.
2012.12-133,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1837.0,1841.869,Does he take into account the fact that the arbitrator can be him?
2012.12-133,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1850.058,1856.479,"And what I would say, Justice Breyer, is the place for that debate, if it were going to take place, was in the district court."
2012.12-133,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1872.573,1873.623,"No, that isn't the point."
2012.12-133,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1911.298,1915.95,"I think what you do is you, with all due respect, fault Petitioners for that."
2012.12-133,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1940.731,1943.517,"One other thing which I didn't understand, and that's why I am asking."
2012.12-133,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1994.032,1998.5,"--Well, our -- our view on that is -- you know, the Court is balancing two things here."
2012.12-133,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2029.37,2032.638,You -- you -- I don't understand.
2012.12-133,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2035.257,2036.092,--Sure.
2012.12-133,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2053.737,2054.353,Let me ask you.
2012.12-133,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2062.659,2063.759,"It doesn't, Justice Scalia."
2012.12-133,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2063.759,2064.192,It doesn't?
2012.12-133,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2064.192,2064.609,It doesn't.
2012.12-133,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2072.948,2082.321,"Yes, but if you couldn't do it -- if you couldn't do it either -- even if there had been no arbitration agreement, how could the arbitration agreement be -- be harming you?"
2012.12-133,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2083.488,2089.725,"If you have -- if you have a claim, Justice Scalia, that can't be vindicated in arbitration or in court, that claim's not going--"
2012.12-133,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2089.725,2090.991,Or in court.
2012.12-133,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2090.991,2091.541,--Right.
2012.12-133,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2091.891,2093.177,You have to compare it to court.
2012.12-133,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2097.912,2106.601,"--With respect, Justice Scalia, you don't have to make that comparison part of the test, because the cases that can't be vindicated in either place won't show up at the courthouse door."
2012.12-133,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2136.32,2136.57,No.
2012.12-133,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2152.498,2163.021,"--And -- and God bless it, Justice Kennedy -- when it does that, and it can effectively address claims that can't be addressed in the litigation system, that's exactly what we want arbitration to do."
2012.12-133,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2195.408,2199.629,"Well, I mean maybe it is litigation if you need a $300,000 report."
2012.12-133,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2218.441,2222.493,"--Well -- and, Justice Kennedy, I would say that -- I mean, shame on them, with all due respect."
2012.12-133,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2239.704,2244.322,"It's a little much to expect them to come back and say: Oh no, no, no, you don't have to prove all this."
2012.12-133,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2249.476,2251.928,"Well, I don't think it is, Mr. Chief Justice."
2012.12-133,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2262.134,2272.426,"There is no authority that I could find for the prop -- I mean, if in fact it costs you $10,000 to buy the arbitrator -- system, you know, you buy the system--"
2012.12-133,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2371.44,2372.875,"--Well, what I'm going to say, Justice--"
2012.12-133,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2372.875,2374.224,"They could write a treatise on it, maybe."
2012.12-133,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2374.224,2378.443,"--But -- but what I was going to say is look, I mean, take a step back."
2012.12-133,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2401.392,2406.946,Suppose this class could not -- could not qualify for certification in Federal court.
2012.12-133,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2417.986,2419.669,"--No, Justice Scalia."
2012.12-133,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2419.669,2424.473,"So you have to make -- you have to make a comparison to what can be done in Federal court, don't you?"
2012.12-133,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2424.473,2426.706,"No, it's not part of the inquiry because--"
2012.12-133,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2426.706,2427.275,It isn't.
2012.12-133,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2432.077,2442.284,"--No, it's just that by virtue of showing up in court and saying, I want to litigate my claim, the lawyer has already made a judgment that I can vindicate it in Federal court."
2012.12-133,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2457.894,2458.727,But he wants a class.
2012.12-133,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2463.781,2466.567,"That might be what they most want, but they don't get that."
2012.12-133,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2483.344,2488.163,"Is -- is that what you asked for below, anything, class action or compensation or whatever?"
2012.12-133,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2488.163,2491.715,"We -- in fairness, we focused below on the class action because that's--"
2012.12-133,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2491.715,2492.25,That's what I thought.
2012.12-133,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2495.816,2498.935,"--Well, don't just look at the question presented, look at the opinion below."
2012.12-133,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2503.222,2516.712,Whether -- whether the Federal Arbitration Act permits courts invoking the Federal substantive law of arbitrability to invalidate arbitration agreements on the ground that they do not permit class arbitration of a Federal law claim.
2012.12-133,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2541.345,2541.678,"--No, it would not--"
2012.12-133,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2541.678,2542.295,--this is a very complicated procedure.
2012.12-133,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2542.295,2542.978,--Your Honor.
2012.12-133,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2569.346,2576.016,"What is -- tell me how the no -- no sharing of information and confidentiality, how does that work again?"
2012.12-133,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2591.876,2594.311,"They -- they could do that much, Mr. Chief Justice."
2012.12-133,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2632.017,2639.106,"Well, what if you do -- I mean, what if you do it, is that just part of your trade associations, they think this is -- you know, they're not talking about particular arbitration or anything."
2012.12-133,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2647.628,2649.178,"--With all due respect, Mr.--"
2012.12-133,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2649.178,2657.084,"It seems to me my point is simply that there's no sharing, confidence, it seems like an awfully amorphous provision that would be very difficult to enforce."
2012.12-133,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2657.084,2660.02,"--Well, I mean, I don't think it's that difficult, Mr. Chief Justice."
2012.12-133,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2675.863,2677.696,We'll afford you some rebuttal time.
2012.12-133,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2686.235,2693.325,"You should have said, “ I accept ”, very quickly."
2012.12-133,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2694.908,2697.043,Just being generous this morning.
2012.12-133,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2698.443,2700.495,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2012.12-133,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2783.399,2787.869,Would that be the case even before Rule 23 was -- was adopted?
2012.12-133,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2787.869,2788.402,--Yes.
2012.12-133,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2788.735,2795.389,"Even though you couldn't vindicate it in the Federal courts, you must be able to vindicate it in arbitration?"
2012.12-133,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2795.389,2799.774,--The question would be whether the arbitration agreement could be enforced.
2012.12-133,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2806.197,2809.648,I'm not even talking about a pure exculpatory clause.
2012.12-133,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2828.643,2838.166,"--In the same way that we would say a pure exculpatory clause would be invalid and unenforceable, even if it were clear from the plaintiff's complaint that he was not entitled to relief on the merits."
2012.12-133,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2838.166,2844.087,"And, Mr. -- Mr. Stewart, isn't that also consistent with the way the Court addressed the issue in Randolph?"
2012.12-133,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2872.756,2873.539,That's correct.
2012.12-133,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2875.374,2877.126,What -- what are the arbitration fees?
2012.12-133,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2880.328,2883.797,"--No, the attorneys' fees would be recoupable under the substantive law."
2012.12-133,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2883.797,2884.297,Okay.
2012.12-133,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2886.332,2887.049,Expert costs.
2012.12-133,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2887.049,2891.819,--So what are you comparing it to in court litigation?
2012.12-133,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2891.819,2892.769,We are not really--
2012.12-133,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2892.769,2893.385,A filing fee?
2012.12-133,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2893.385,2898.206,"--No, I think we are not comparing it to anything."
2012.12-133,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2954.726,2968.134,"This is exactly -- I found no authority for the proposition that what hinders -- plenty of authority, you can't make the person go to arbitration if the fees involved are too high, because he's blocked."
2012.12-133,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3048.338,3049.655,"Well, let me start--"
2012.12-133,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3049.655,3051.374,"That's a long question, but do you see what I'm driving at?"
2012.12-133,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3051.374,3054.826,--Let me start with your last question and work backwards.
2012.12-133,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3245.265,3245.598,Excuse me.
2012.12-133,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3260.275,3261.275,--But they did get cert--
2012.12-133,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3261.275,3262.726,That's what I thought the question before us.
2012.12-133,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3262.726,3279.436,"--They got cert granted on that question, but neither the question as so framed or the body of the cert petition suggests any challenge to the Second Circuit's factual determination that these claims could not feasibly have been brought in individualized arbitration."
2012.12-133,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3279.436,3284.39,"Mr. Stewart, is it -- the arbitration agreement is a one-on-one, right?"
2012.12-133,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3293.429,3294.046,That's correct.
2012.12-133,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3294.046,3295.562,Which is correct?
2012.12-133,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3295.562,3299.714,"It is correct that it has to be one on one, that the agreement requires only--"
2012.12-133,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3299.714,3307.62,"And even in the days before we had Rule 23, when you were bringing a suit in Federal court you could have multiple plaintiffs joining together."
2012.12-133,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3307.62,3308.67,--That's correct.
2012.12-133,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3314.541,3315.642,"Thank you, counsel."
2012.12-133,3,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,3318.927,3320.779,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2012.12-133,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3359.238,3362.023,"Well, do we have a factual record?"
2012.12-133,3,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,3385.137,3397.613,"--I don't think you need a factual record, because Respondents acknowledge the burden is on them to show that the arbitration-specific costs would preclude them from pursuing their claim."
2012.12-133,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3412.121,3413.056,But suppose we answer--
2012.12-133,3,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,3413.056,3413.289,That is not--
2012.12-133,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3413.289,3417.091,"--the question -- the answer is yes, a class action waiver can be enforced."
2012.12-133,3,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,3417.091,3417.825,--Correct.
2012.12-133,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3417.825,3419.976,"Now, what are the circumstances here?"
2012.12-133,3,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,3425.196,3426.28,"Well, the court could certainly--"
2012.12-133,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3426.28,3428.48,"Because that isn't the issue they decided, whether it could be enforced."
2012.12-133,3,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,3432.7,3439.104,--The holding of the court of appeals is the arbitration agreement cannot be enforced because it has a class action waiver.
2012.12-133,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3442.736,3444.522,It was because -- it was because Judge Pooler said:
2012.12-133,3,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,3464.416,3475.957,"--But the Court also in Concepcion said you can condition the enforceability of an arbitration agreement on the availability of class procedures, and that is what the Court below violated."
2012.12-133,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3536.015,3536.882,Or you have to do without.
2012.12-133,3,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,3544.72,3548.922,--That is how I read -- that is how I read the report.
2012.12-133,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3551.291,3553.559,"You said you waived that point, whatever -- however it is."
2012.12-133,3,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,3559.145,3562.249,"--No, we raised -- we've argued that all along."
2012.12-133,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3566.967,3572.538,"The Second Circuit never said anything about, this is what it would cost in court."
2012.12-133,3,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,3588.297,3589.332,"--We did, in fact."
2012.12-133,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3593.701,3594.217,I believe you.
2012.12-133,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3594.217,3597.169,"I'd like to hear the answer, if nobody--"
2012.12-133,3,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,3597.969,3598.985,"--We specifically said,"
2012.12-133,3,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3645.464,3650.684,"Well, Mr. Kellogg, it does seem like both of the parties have changed what they're saying a bit."
2012.12-133,3,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,3677.918,3679.687,"Well, I -- I don't believe that's the case."
2012.12-133,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3695.046,3695.729,"Thank you, counsel."
