1988.87-329,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.866,"We'll hear argument now in No. 87-329, The Florida Star v. B.J.F.--"
1988.87-329,0,25963,george_k_rahdert,,11.44,14.632,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the court."
1988.87-329,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,191.537,196.451,But there were some facts in the record before he did that?
1988.87-329,0,25963,george_k_rahdert,,196.451,200.182,"Your Honor, those facts were not part of his consideration."
1988.87-329,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,201.044,203.086,"Well, I just asked you, were there some facts in the record, or not?"
1988.87-329,0,25963,george_k_rahdert,,203.086,203.665,--I'm sorry.
1988.87-329,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,205.397,206.297,Such as:
1988.87-329,0,25963,george_k_rahdert,,206.297,207.979,There were facts concerning--
1988.87-329,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,207.979,210.801,--How the reporter got the information?
1988.87-329,0,25963,george_k_rahdert,,210.801,221.257,"--The reporter... there were facts that the reporter got the information in the routine manner, a clerk-trainee-type reporter was sent down to the sheriff's press room."
1988.87-329,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,233.417,240.169,"But was it also that she knew it was a policy of the newspaper not to publish it, and that this was not public information?"
1988.87-329,0,25963,george_k_rahdert,,240.169,250.668,"--Your Honor, there was indication that the press, that this newspaper, indeed, has a self-imposed policy of retraining from publishing the name of rape victims in those cases."
1988.87-329,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,250.668,254.468,And didn't she know that it was contrary to law to publish it?
1988.87-329,0,25963,george_k_rahdert,,254.468,257.041,That was very unclear from the record.
1988.87-329,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,270.53,271.241,Was that in the record?
1988.87-329,0,25963,george_k_rahdert,,271.241,272.18,"That is in the record, Your Honor."
1988.87-329,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,288.953,289.414,Yes.
1988.87-329,0,25963,george_k_rahdert,,292.965,294.095,--The suit is against tie paper.
1988.87-329,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,294.095,294.636,Not against her?
1988.87-329,0,25963,george_k_rahdert,,294.636,295.985,It's not against her.
1988.87-329,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,295.985,297.718,"So, what happened then?"
1988.87-329,0,25963,george_k_rahdert,,300.029,321.885,"The facts in the record are that she put the information, copied verbatim, from the press released incident report in a bin at the newspaper, and the newspaper reporter, who typically writes up several pages, two or three pages of police report stories, transposed the information into a story."
1988.87-329,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,321.885,328.938,"But, there could hardly, can hardly be claimed that the newspaper didn't know that it was against the law to publish the name?"
1988.87-329,0,25963,george_k_rahdert,,328.938,334.66,I think you could probably imply knowledge of the law.
1988.87-329,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,354.276,367.963,"If the information had been illegally obtained, as if the reporter had gone in to a private place, and obtained it, would you be still making the same as applied argument?"
1988.87-329,0,25963,george_k_rahdert,,369.916,376.549,"If it had been illegally obtained, there would be remedies for theft, and for intrusion."
1988.87-329,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,381.474,388.257,"But would you, would you still have said that you couldn't be held liable for publishing the name?"
1988.87-329,0,25963,george_k_rahdert,,388.257,396.992,--We would say that the appropriate sanctions would be to address the manner in which it was illegally obtained.
1988.87-329,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,396.992,410.081,"Well, I know, but would, would you say the paper could not be held liable for publishing the name of the rape victim, contrary to the law, if the information had been illegally obtained?"
1988.87-329,0,25963,george_k_rahdert,,410.081,422.38,"If the information, if the information had been illegally obtained in the sense that it violated some statutes, statutory scheme, that would follow the precedent, that would fit, essentially, the circumstances--"
1988.87-329,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,422.38,424.38,"Well, can't my question be answered yes or no?"
1988.87-329,0,25963,george_k_rahdert,,424.38,432.255,"--Your Honor, we would, we would contend that there would be a first amendment right to print information in the hands of the press, and that the--"
1988.87-329,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,432.255,433.627,Even though it's stolen?
1988.87-329,0,25963,george_k_rahdert,,433.627,439.852,"--If it was stolen information, the act of theft would be a, would be inappropriate and unusual."
1988.87-329,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,439.852,441.922,"Well, but nevertheless, you say you couldn't be held liable for publishing it."
1988.87-329,0,25963,george_k_rahdert,,441.922,443.675,"Your Honor, we--"
1988.87-329,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,443.675,445.816,Even though it hadn't been... ever been in the public domain?
1988.87-329,0,25963,george_k_rahdert,,445.816,446.875,--I'm sorry?
1988.87-329,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,446.875,450.377,Even though the information had never been in the public domain?
1988.87-329,0,25963,george_k_rahdert,,453.169,455.84,The prohibition against publishing that information would be--
1988.87-329,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,455.84,457.182,"Well, a penalty for publishing."
1988.87-329,0,25963,george_k_rahdert,,463.948,479.118,"--Under the law of Cox Broadcasting v. Cohn and its progeny, this court has suggested that before publication of truthful information can be punished, there has to be a state interest of the highest order."
1988.87-329,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,488.681,489.442,"Well,--"
1988.87-329,0,25963,george_k_rahdert,,489.442,497.127,We contend the truthful publication enjoys a higher level of protection.
1988.87-329,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,497.127,504.403,"--Counsel, I don't think this court has ever adopted the rule you propose, of absolute freedom to publish true information."
1988.87-329,0,25963,george_k_rahdert,,512.378,513.98,"Your Honor, of course, this is not--"
1988.87-329,1,30150,joel_d_eaton,,1527.821,1533.705,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the court."
1988.87-329,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1736.7,1739.151,It doesn't take it out of the public domain.
1988.87-329,1,30150,joel_d_eaton,,1768.279,1782.379,"Well, I'm not inclined to argue with you, Your Honor, except for the fact that the lower courts have declared as a matter of state law, that this exception from the Public Records Act, attach to the material, and not merely to the custodian."
1988.87-329,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1858.099,1865.503,"Mr., Mr. Eaton, exactly what law was violated, prior to publication of the name?"
1988.87-329,1,30150,joel_d_eaton,,1865.503,1874.209,The Public Records Act exemption prevents the public disclosure of a rape victim's name contained on a police report.
1988.87-329,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1874.209,1886.136,"Well, could the Florida Star have been prosecuted under Florida law, if it had not published the name, but had taken... The trainee had taken the name down."
1988.87-329,1,30150,joel_d_eaton,,1886.136,1887.408,"Not criminally, your honor."
1988.87-329,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1887.408,1895.533,"Well then, I have a hard time understanding your argument that somehow the information was illegally obtained."
1988.87-329,1,30150,joel_d_eaton,,1895.533,1917.558,"The argument is this, that there is a greater protection for the information on this piece of paper, in the form of a state statute than there is in the judgment or the competence of a clerk at the desk in the police station."
1988.87-329,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1917.558,1921.009,But the statute makes it a crime to publish?
1988.87-329,1,30150,joel_d_eaton,,1921.009,1922.101,I'm sorry.
1988.87-329,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1947.476,1947.827,All right.
1988.87-329,1,30150,joel_d_eaton,,1952.972,1964.259,"--No, your honor, and curiously, the criminal penalty that used to attach to the custodian of that information was recently removed by the Florida legislature."
1988.87-329,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1968.971,1974.744,"So, in essence, you have to concede that the information was lawfully obtained by the Star?"
1988.87-329,1,30150,joel_d_eaton,,1974.744,1976.737,"--I am unwilling to concede that, your honor."
1988.87-329,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1976.737,1980.24,"Well then, can you cite the statute that was violated?"
1988.87-329,1,30150,joel_d_eaton,,1980.24,1989.313,"I refer your honor to the lower court's decision which held that this was, because of this statute, non-public information."
1988.87-329,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2060.923,2072.87,"To begin with, even if it were the law that the sheriff could not release her name, I don't know that if the sheriff did release it, the person to whom he released it, would be violating the law."
1988.87-329,1,30150,joel_d_eaton,,2084.517,2088.891,"I'm not suggesting, your honor, that the newspaper violated the Florida Public Records Act."
1988.87-329,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2088.891,2093.333,"So then, it received, it acquired the information legally as far as it was concerned."
1988.87-329,1,30150,joel_d_eaton,,2093.333,2103.912,"I am suggesting to your honor, as the lower court's found, as a matter of state law, that the information was non-public as a matter of law."
1988.87-329,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2103.912,2104.681,"Well, let's talk about that."
1988.87-329,1,30150,joel_d_eaton,,2138.413,2147.46,"I don't think Mr. Rahdert would agree with your honor that that's a correct way to read it, because it is thoroughly settled in Florida law that that is a prohibition."
1988.87-329,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2151.854,2157.898,"Have you got cases on that, because it really doesn't read that way, unless you're relying on some Florida cases that I don't know about it."
1988.87-329,1,30150,joel_d_eaton,,2186.33,2192.904,"--And they go on in the last sentence to say, ""Because this is non-public information""."
1988.87-329,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2212.166,2220.083,"--Of course, counsel, the statute that we're faced with, 794.03, goes much further."
1988.87-329,1,30150,joel_d_eaton,,2229.13,2237.478,"There is a justification for that, as your honor observed initially."
1988.87-329,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2247.233,2253.767,"That would be quite a break with our precedence if we were to hold that, would it not?"
1988.87-329,1,30150,joel_d_eaton,,2270.058,2285.039,"--The problem is that this is not a suit brought on 794.03, and you're talking about an overbreadth challenge, which was really never raised below, and which I need to come back to to answer."
1988.87-329,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2285.039,2285.617,No.
1988.87-329,1,30150,joel_d_eaton,,2287.37,2288.369,I'm sorry.
1988.87-329,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2297.034,2303.459,"Well, would you be willing to stipulate that we could affirm your judgment and still hold this statute unconstitutional?"
1988.87-329,1,30150,joel_d_eaton,,2303.459,2318.011,"--I have argued that you must do that, because even if the statute is unconstitutional, we had a common law action for invasion of privacy, and the only way... a negligence action, in effect."
1988.87-329,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2318.35,2325.965,"Oh, but this case was submitted to the jury on a negligence per se theory, based on the statute."
1988.87-329,1,30150,joel_d_eaton,,2325.965,2344.928,"--In Florida, when you bring a negligence action, and the legislature has enacted a statute which defines the minimum standard of care under a given circumstances... then if the evidence is uncontradicted as it was in this case, that the defendant violated the statute, the law is that you have been negligent as a matter of law."
1988.87-329,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2404.326,2408.148,I suggest the trial judge would be very surprised by that result.
1988.87-329,1,30150,joel_d_eaton,,2408.148,2415.104,"I borrowed that from the chief justice's opinion in Time, Inc. v. Firestone, your honor."
1988.87-329,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2427.88,2429.783,"Gee, there's really less to this case than meets the eye."
1988.87-329,1,30150,joel_d_eaton,,2442.22,2460.632,"--Well, I think, the major constitutional issue would exist in any of the 50 states which recognize a common law action for invasion of privacy, in which the suit was brought against the newspaper, or any instrument of the mass media, for the publication of the name of a rape victim, with or without the benefit of a statute, providing it is--"
1988.87-329,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2460.632,2464.255,"Would those suits, like this statute, extend only to the press?"
1988.87-329,1,30150,joel_d_eaton,,2478.995,2498.579,"--The reason why this statute makes perfect sense to me, at least, the way it's drawn, is that the tort of invasion of privacy, according to the restatement and the general formulation of it throughout the country is that an invasion of privacy is actionable only if there has been widespread general publicity about an embarrassing, private fact."
1988.87-329,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2552.716,2555.959,May I ask you a question on the common law tort of invasion of privacy in Florida.
1988.87-329,1,30150,joel_d_eaton,,2561.491,2562.413,"--Yes, your honor."
1988.87-329,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2571.92,2574.053,"Well, you cite the Florida case as you define the tort in your brief."
1988.87-329,1,30150,joel_d_eaton,,2574.053,2577.654,"--I cited Cason v. Baskin, which is the leading Florida decision."
1988.87-329,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2577.654,2579.486,And there's no statute involved in that case?
1988.87-329,1,30150,joel_d_eaton,,2579.486,2581.066,There's no statute involved.
1988.87-329,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2744.978,2745.419,Yes.
1988.87-329,1,30150,joel_d_eaton,,2759.068,2760.189,I agree with your honor.
1988.87-329,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2766.52,2781.392,"Well, you could have... the same argument could have been made in Cox, that the law just, wherever you find this information, even in an open court room, is just plain not public property."
1988.87-329,1,30150,joel_d_eaton,,2781.392,2793.188,"--I'm not the least bit ashamed to stand here and suggest to this court, notwithstanding, that you were unanimous in Cox Broadcasting, that the name of a rape victim never ought to be in a newspaper and I don't care where they get it."
1988.87-329,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2795.87,2802.304,"But you do have to distinguish Cox, and you have done your best."
1988.87-329,1,30150,joel_d_eaton,,2802.304,2803.385,I have done my best.
1988.87-329,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2804.965,2807.008,"Counsel, one question."
1988.87-329,1,30150,joel_d_eaton,,2820.527,2823.999,--Not under this Florida statutory scheme.
1988.87-329,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2973.205,2983.213,"Haven't we also said though, Mr. Eaton, that, generally, it's up to the publishers and editors of newspapers to decide whether something meets that standards rather than the government saying it?"
1988.87-329,1,30150,joel_d_eaton,,2983.213,2984.475,No.
1988.87-329,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3052.298,3073.172,"Mr. Eaton, It's always a hard call as to how important the public interest is versus the interest of the press, and frankly, I have always thought that, that one of the, one of the disciplines that we impose upon, upon the majority before they silence the press, is that they have to be willing to silence themselves as well."
1988.87-329,1,30150,joel_d_eaton,,3109.865,3121.804,"There are difficulties with that, your honor, which is what caused the common law of invasion of privacy to draw the line at massive, general publicity, rather than, and exclude these other things."
1988.87-329,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3136.683,3137.053,That's fine.
1988.87-329,1,30150,joel_d_eaton,,3140.856,3142.316,"But, your honor, you're suggesting--"
1988.87-329,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3142.316,3148.14,"But the backyard gossip who tells 50 people that don't have to know, why isn't she as, just as much guilty of harming this woman as the press is?"
1988.87-329,1,30150,joel_d_eaton,,3148.14,3154.704,"--Fifty people under Florida law, she probably is guilty of an invasion of privacy, without the benefit of the statute, under Florida law."
1988.87-329,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3154.704,3155.045,"Well, no."
1988.87-329,1,30150,joel_d_eaton,,3158.017,3161.059,"The statute just addresses ""instruments of mass communication""."
1988.87-329,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3306.054,3307.985,Is that cited somewhere in your briefs?
1988.87-329,1,30150,joel_d_eaton,,3307.985,3309.126,"Yes, your honor, it is."
1988.87-329,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3309.126,3312.859,"Probably have an Official Secrets Act up there too, I don't know."
1988.87-329,1,30150,joel_d_eaton,,3313.758,3319.842,"They have, they have a first amendment, which is very similar to ours, and they have it written in their Bill of Rights, a provision that says,"
