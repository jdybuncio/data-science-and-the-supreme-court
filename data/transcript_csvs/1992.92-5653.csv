1992.92-5653,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,5.666,"We'll hear argument now in No. 92-5653, Dorsie Lee Johnson v. Texas."
1992.92-5653,0,36803,michael_e_tigar,,6.875,13.45,"Mr. Chief Justice of the United States, and may it please the Court:"
1992.92-5653,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,116.907,124.912,"Mr. Tigar, you say that the petitioner was 19 when the offense was committed."
1992.92-5653,0,36803,michael_e_tigar,,124.912,126.605,"Yes, Justice O'Connor."
1992.92-5653,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,126.605,130.406,"Now, I guess under Texas law, he became an adult at 18?"
1992.92-5653,0,36803,michael_e_tigar,,130.406,132.779,"That's correct, Justice O'Connor."
1992.92-5653,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,132.779,143.845,"So, how long in your view is youth a factor then in a case such as this?"
1992.92-5653,0,36803,michael_e_tigar,,151.469,160.876,Surely the entitlement to an instruction on youthful age in our view lasts until a defendant is 21 or 22.
1992.92-5653,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,164.068,167.211,"Well, why do you say that, and what do we look to?"
1992.92-5653,0,36803,michael_e_tigar,,171.963,180.779,--I submit that one could look first to respondent's concession here that Jurek was youthful although he was 22.
1992.92-5653,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,231.001,231.682,"Excuse me, Mr.--"
1992.92-5653,0,36803,michael_e_tigar,,231.682,232.433,--that as to the outer--
1992.92-5653,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,232.433,238.467,"--The legal tradition you were referring to that extended to 25, that's a legal tradition of what?"
1992.92-5653,0,36803,michael_e_tigar,,238.467,252.085,"--The Lex Plaetoria of the 4th century B.C. as interpreted by Justinian and the institutes would have extended mercy up to the age of 25 despite the coming to majority at 14, which was the general rule under Roman law, Justice Scalia."
1992.92-5653,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,254.138,258.309,Did that relate to the time the crime was committed or to the age of the defendant?
1992.92-5653,0,36803,michael_e_tigar,,258.309,263.823,"To the time of the transaction under review, Justice Scalia, as I understand the institutes."
1992.92-5653,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,290.411,299.116,"This young man, Mr. Tigar, had tragedies in his early adolescence."
1992.92-5653,0,36803,michael_e_tigar,,342.246,345.568,"No, Justice Scalia, we do not submit--"
1992.92-5653,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,345.568,346.279,I'm Justice Kennedy.
1992.92-5653,0,36803,michael_e_tigar,,346.279,346.888,--I'm sorry.
1992.92-5653,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,368.992,372.326,But I'm trying to see if our decision can be so limited.
1992.92-5653,0,36803,michael_e_tigar,,372.326,379.66,"--Yes, Justice Kennedy, I submit that it can, and let me suggest the way in which that might be so."
1992.92-5653,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,429.292,436.277,"Well, but the evidence was introduced in this case and counsel is not confined at all in their closing arguments."
1992.92-5653,0,36803,michael_e_tigar,,451.096,458.022,"Justice Kennedy, first with respect to the factual premise, of course the jury heard evidence of youth in this case."
1992.92-5653,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,530.538,535.042,But why is this youth in this regard different from a tragic occurrence during adolescence?
1992.92-5653,0,36803,michael_e_tigar,,536.372,548.761,"--The difference is that this Court's decisions, particularly Lockett and Eddings, say that, recognize that youth has this uniquely powerful mitigating force."
1992.92-5653,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,595.842,621.537,"Your description of what the Texas courts hold these factors to be, namely, narrow, factual inquiries, suggests to me that... although you purport to be making only an as-applied challenge, it seems to me that if we accept that description, this scheme is invalid."
1992.92-5653,0,36803,michael_e_tigar,,631.485,635.298,The State and the amici have made that argument.
1992.92-5653,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,670.15,684.719,"Yes, but Proffitt didn't... I mean, we had never accepted the proposition that the State inquiry was a narrow, factual inquiry of whether there was, as you say there is in this case, premeditation or deliberateness."
1992.92-5653,0,36803,michael_e_tigar,,690.452,692.193,"Well, that was the prosecutor's words, Justice Scalia."
1992.92-5653,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,692.193,699.759,"--But, I mean, if that's what this means in the Texas statute, surely it does not allow a reasoned moral response."
1992.92-5653,0,36803,michael_e_tigar,,699.759,711.026,"The two special issues that were before the Court in Jurek, Justice Scalia, had at 1976 been considered only in two cases by the Court of Criminal Appeals, Jurek and a case called Smith."
1992.92-5653,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,790.207,805.008,"In this connection, I was interested in reading Ex parte Mathis where the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals does say that future dangerousness is a fact."
1992.92-5653,0,36803,michael_e_tigar,,817.926,826.271,"--No, I don't believe that it is a new limitation."
1992.92-5653,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,844.063,845.763,"Well, of course, this is not a Teague case anyway."
1992.92-5653,0,36803,michael_e_tigar,,864.696,869.729,The Court of Criminal Appeals has hued to the view that this is a narrow inquiry.
1992.92-5653,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,944.299,955.165,"You think, Mr. Tigar, that the Court's jurisprudence in capital cases, since 1987 has become, at least in this... more favorable to the defendant?"
1992.92-5653,0,36803,michael_e_tigar,,955.165,960.559,"No, Justice... Chief Justice Rehnquist, I do not think it has become more favorable to the defendant."
1992.92-5653,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,960.559,969.274,"Well, then... I thought from your statement that what the Court has done since 1987 we have to... suggested that."
1992.92-5653,0,36803,michael_e_tigar,,969.274,970.226,Chief--
1992.92-5653,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,970.226,971.067,"I'm wrong, I take it."
1992.92-5653,0,36803,michael_e_tigar,,971.067,976.098,"--Chief Justice Rehnquist, in some ways that jurisprudence has become more favorable to the State."
1992.92-5653,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1017.115,1027.153,Have any of these cases since 1987 on the mitigating side that you're relying expressly noted that a change is contemplated?
1992.92-5653,0,36803,michael_e_tigar,,1027.153,1052.808,"In Sumner, the Court closed the door for good and all, according to the opinion, on... excuse me... the categorical imperative of death, and the Court has argued about whether principles are new or not new under the rubric of Teague."
1992.92-5653,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1088.352,1091.375,I'm not sure that the cases must be read that way.
1992.92-5653,0,36803,michael_e_tigar,,1091.375,1098.499,It would be presumptuous of me to tell the Court how to read its own cases.
1992.92-5653,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1304.663,1306.534,"Very well, Mr. Tigar."
1992.92-5653,1,21374,dana_e_parker,,1309.046,1311.657,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1992.92-5653,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1341.646,1344.759,"Mrs. Parker, may I ask you this question?"
1992.92-5653,1,21374,dana_e_parker,,1470.353,1476.877,"I do understand that to be his argument, Your Honor, and it is incorrect for three reasons."
1992.92-5653,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1483.89,1486.012,"Well, I think you know I may have misspoken there."
1992.92-5653,1,21374,dana_e_parker,,1494.188,1494.958,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1992.92-5653,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1512.99,1552.105,"Well, isn't it... isn't the proper way to apply it that if the jury was reasonably likely to view the evidence in the way that I think Mr. Tigar is suggesting, i.e., as certainly in no way contrary to the deliberateness of the act, and as also indicating under the second issue a continuing youthfulness for some period of time, which imports danger with it, if those two conclusions were reasonably likely, then there's no way they could consider it for a mitigating purpose."
1992.92-5653,1,21374,dana_e_parker,,1556.168,1557.27,"No, Your Honor, it is not."
1992.92-5653,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1572.317,1583.907,"Well, how... in other words, why is he wrong when he assumes that a reasonable juror would view it as aggravating rather than mitigating?"
1992.92-5653,1,21374,dana_e_parker,,1583.907,1595.485,"--I think there are... that premise is legally incorrect for two reasons, the first being that it is not consistent with what the Court of Criminal Appeals said in Zimmerman."
1992.92-5653,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1622.582,1626.183,"Well, I think there's no question we would all agree that it can be seen in that way."
1992.92-5653,1,21374,dana_e_parker,,1645.137,1646.647,"--No, Your Honor."
1992.92-5653,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1662.878,1666.789,What does future dangerousness mean?
1992.92-5653,1,21374,dana_e_parker,,1677.938,1689.306,The Court of Criminal Appeals has stated that it's whether the defendant would continue to commit criminal acts of violence so as to constitute a continuing threat whether in or out of prison.
1992.92-5653,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1689.306,1691.417,"Well, how was the jury instructed on that in this case?"
1992.92-5653,1,21374,dana_e_parker,,1695.239,1696.449,"No, Your Honor, it was not."
1992.92-5653,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1696.449,1699.25,"So, the jury didn't know how to interpret it."
1992.92-5653,1,21374,dana_e_parker,,1739.498,1745.953,"A hypothetical juror certainly could view it that way, but that is not--"
1992.92-5653,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1745.953,1748.424,"Well, as long... I didn't mean... I'm sorry."
1992.92-5653,1,21374,dana_e_parker,,1774.972,1780.153,"--Again, Your Honor, that is not consistent with the reasonable likelihood standard."
1992.92-5653,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1781.575,1787.4,You're saying that you think a reasonable juror would not have interpreted it the way Justice Souter says.
1992.92-5653,1,21374,dana_e_parker,,1787.4,1802.788,"--That is precisely correct, Mr. Chief Justice, and that is particularly true in a case where the jury believes that the crime is attributable to a mitigating aspect of youth and that that defendant, precisely to that extent, is likely not to pose a future danger."
1992.92-5653,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1834.791,1856.874,"But... when you speak of giving effect to both edges, don't we usually premise everything we say about jury instructions on the assumption that if a juror could reasonably view the evidence in one of two... in either of two ways, that the juror has got to be given instructions as to the legal significance of viewing it one way and the legal significance of viewing it the other?"
1992.92-5653,1,21374,dana_e_parker,,1889.105,1898.761,"Your Honor, they were instructed not in that regard, but they were instructed that they could consider all of the evidence whether aggravating or mitigating."
1992.92-5653,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1902.605,1906.055,But they could only consider it... maybe I'm missing something.
1992.92-5653,1,21374,dana_e_parker,,1910.549,1921.356,"--That is correct, and as the evidence in this case reflects, the jury could give mitigating effect to Johnson's youth precisely as the evidence was presented and--"
1992.92-5653,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1921.356,1947.953,"But if the reasonable juror said I regard this as an aggravating factor in the sense that the... under the second question, in the sense that I think this person is going to remain impetuous for a few years and he's likely to do it again, then the juror could not, under... or I was going to say under the instruction... under the lack of instruction, have said but I still think I ought to give a mitigating significance to the youth."
1992.92-5653,1,21374,dana_e_parker,,1968.948,1973.272,"--No, Your Honor."
1992.92-5653,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2001.098,2008.123,Would it have been proper for counsel to argue in the terms of this statement?
1992.92-5653,1,21374,dana_e_parker,,2036.361,2040.685,--For defense counsel to make?
1992.92-5653,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2040.685,2041.256,Yes.
1992.92-5653,1,21374,dana_e_parker,,2041.256,2045.417,"Yes, Your Honor, I believe it would be because--"
1992.92-5653,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2045.417,2054.382,"And if a juror had... and I suppose this isn't possible, but if a juror had said please tell me how, what would the answer have been?"
1992.92-5653,1,21374,dana_e_parker,,2070.975,2082.512,"--Your Honor, because the question not only asks about continuing criminal acts of violence, but whether that would render this defendant a continuing threat to society, and nothing--"
1992.92-5653,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2082.512,2083.083,"Well, let's assume it will be."
1992.92-5653,1,21374,dana_e_parker,,2113.612,2122.037,--I think that the answer to that again is that nothing requires the jurors to take that narrow a view of the special issues and that--
1992.92-5653,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2122.037,2128.061,"No, but the jurors... I mean, that is a reasonable way for the jurors to interpret the question, isn't it?"
1992.92-5653,1,21374,dana_e_parker,,2149.015,2167.507,"--Again, Boyde makes it clear that the reasonable likelihood standard does not assume that jurors will pick from among various interpretations of their instructions the one that will render the presentation of mitigating evidence and the punishment phase a nullity."
1992.92-5653,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2171.739,2184.457,"Mrs. Parker, I certainly as a reasonable juror, given this instruction, would not think that what you were asking me was whether he's going to be future... whether he's going to be dangerous tomorrow, but rather whether he's going to be dangerous after he's released from prison--"
1992.92-5653,1,21374,dana_e_parker,,2184.457,2185.669,And that is--
1992.92-5653,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2185.669,2188.622,--for whatever term you might give him for the murder.
1992.92-5653,1,21374,dana_e_parker,,2211.647,2214.739,"--I would agree with you there, Your Honor."
1992.92-5653,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2217.751,2220.633,Does the supreme... does the court of Texas criminal appeals agree with you?
1992.92-5653,1,21374,dana_e_parker,,2220.633,2226.225,--The Court of Criminal Appeals has stated that society does encompass prison.
1992.92-5653,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2226.225,2226.826,No.
1992.92-5653,1,21374,dana_e_parker,,2241.276,2242.605,"No, Your Honor."
1992.92-5653,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2242.605,2247.761,"Isn't that what it said in Zimmerman, that that's one way to consider this evidence under the question?"
1992.92-5653,1,21374,dana_e_parker,,2247.761,2251.832,"No, Your Honor, that is not what the Court of Criminal Appeals said in Zimmerman."
1992.92-5653,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2289.708,2307.757,"In your answers to Justice Souter, were you making the assumption that in its deliberations and in giving its answer with reference to special issue 2, the jury was making a reasoned moral judgment?"
1992.92-5653,1,21374,dana_e_parker,,2307.757,2313.461,I think that that underlies the jury's answer to that special issue.
1992.92-5653,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2317.204,2321.599,"Well, if it underlies it, the jury was then exercising in your view a reasoned moral judgment?"
1992.92-5653,1,21374,dana_e_parker,,2321.599,2323.481,"That is correct, Your Honor, and--"
1992.92-5653,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2323.481,2335.6,How is that consistent with the statement by the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals that the jury in answering question number 2 is making a finding of fact?
1992.92-5653,1,21374,dana_e_parker,,2335.6,2351.17,"--I think it has always been recognized that the special issues are factual issues, that they are factual in nature, and that a jury or jurors must be able to answer those issues without conscious distortion or bias."
1992.92-5653,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2363.757,2385.031,"Well, I suppose that factual assessments, factual assumptions underlie many reasoned moral judgments, but isn't there an element of judgment... I think you used the word merciful earlier... an element of judgment that is different than simply a factual determination?"
1992.92-5653,1,21374,dana_e_parker,,2385.031,2389.874,"No, Your Honor, that is not correct."
1992.92-5653,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2391.016,2393.286,Factual determinations are reasoned moral judgments?
1992.92-5653,1,21374,dana_e_parker,,2395.397,2396.839,--They are in this case.
1992.92-5653,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2419.123,2423.487,"Yes, but in Blystone the jury weighed the aggravating and the mitigating factors."
1992.92-5653,1,21374,dana_e_parker,,2423.487,2436.155,"Yes, Your Honor, but a finding that aggravation outweighs mitigation is no more or no less utilitarian than an answer to these special issues."
1992.92-5653,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2520.56,2523.272,May I ask you?
1992.92-5653,1,21374,dana_e_parker,,2545.998,2549.969,"Yes, Your Honor, the Court of Criminal Appeals has held that it would."
1992.92-5653,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2549.969,2557.314,"So, it doesn't refer as I thought... I thought you suggested to Justice Scalia it referred to conduct after being released from prison only."
1992.92-5653,1,21374,dana_e_parker,,2561.276,2578.128,"There is nothing about the issue that requires the jury to view it that way, and as defense counsel argued in this case, society should be viewed to exclude prison and that the jury should consider only what Johnson might do 20 or 40 years down the road."
1992.92-5653,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2578.778,2579.168,No.
1992.92-5653,1,21374,dana_e_parker,,2590.324,2595.769,--That is certainly a factor that is relevant to the jury's assessment of that issue.
1992.92-5653,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2602.933,2612.7,"Well, what if the jury came back to the judge and said we think if he's kept in jail for the rest of his life, he would not be a continuing threat, but if he were released tomorrow, he would be a continuing threat?"
1992.92-5653,1,21374,dana_e_parker,,2623.087,2629.721,--I believe that in all likelihood he probably would tell the jury that they--
1992.92-5653,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2629.721,2630.562,Figure it out either way you want to.
1992.92-5653,1,21374,dana_e_parker,,2630.562,2633.815,"--Yes, that... yes, Your Honor, that the term was not defined."
1992.92-5653,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2633.815,2636.616,And this gives meaningful guidance as to whether the man should be put to death or not.
1992.92-5653,1,21374,dana_e_parker,,2636.616,2646.932,That is merely within the jury's range of discretion and judgment about the issues.
1992.92-5653,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2661.113,2662.583,What about a slight variation on it?
1992.92-5653,1,21374,dana_e_parker,,2700.277,2711.523,I do not believe that the judge would instruct the jury that they could not accept that assessment.
1992.92-5653,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2711.523,2715.156,"He would... so, they would have the option to return a yes answer."
1992.92-5653,1,21374,dana_e_parker,,2715.156,2723.872,"Yes, Your Honor, precisely depending upon their view of the evidence and whether it is, in fact, mitigating or aggravating."
1992.92-5653,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2723.872,2732.047,"Ms. Parker, under Texas law, is a trial judge authorized to give an answer to a question like that?"
1992.92-5653,1,21374,dana_e_parker,,2734.991,2736.862,"Yes, Your Honor."
1992.92-5653,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2759.816,2763.018,Was any instruction like that asked for here?
1992.92-5653,1,21374,dana_e_parker,,2763.018,2764.849,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1992.92-5653,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2831.695,2841.679,"In your view under Texas law, would the defendant be entitled to an instruction that in answering issue 2, the jury is to exercise its reasoned moral judgment?"
1992.92-5653,1,21374,dana_e_parker,,2841.679,2846.744,I think that is inherent in answering the special issues.
1992.92-5653,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2846.744,2849.266,"Well, if it's inherent, would he be entitled to that instruction?"
1992.92-5653,1,21374,dana_e_parker,,2849.266,2850.345,"No, Your Honor."
1992.92-5653,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2861.093,2867.508,"Would it be error for the judge not to give that instruction and to tell the jury that when it answers question 2, it's making a finding of fact?"
1992.92-5653,1,21374,dana_e_parker,,2867.508,2872.77,"No, Your Honor, it would not be."
1992.92-5653,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2882.575,2886.589,"But isn't it a utilitarian, moral response?"
1992.92-5653,1,21374,dana_e_parker,,2899.709,2901.308,"No, Your Honor."
1992.92-5653,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2907.633,2909.904,Then I have to admit I don't understand the second question.
1992.92-5653,1,21374,dana_e_parker,,2909.904,2939.593,"Again, consistent... so long as jurors do not consciously distort the inquiries to the issues, they are free, depending on their view of the evidence, to give that evidence mitigating effect under the issue so long as the evidence possesses mitigating relevance to the special issues, which was true of Johnson's youth as proffered in this case, for it was proffered for no purpose other than the special issues."
1992.92-5653,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2972.946,2980.23,"Does the statute that Texas has amended, the present Texas death penalty statute, give an independent life option in your view?"
1992.92-5653,1,21374,dana_e_parker,,2980.23,2983.612,"Yes, Your Honor, I believe it does."
1992.92-5653,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2983.612,2984.513,That's how you would interpret that.
1992.92-5653,1,21374,dana_e_parker,,2984.513,2986.804,"Yes, Your Honor, I believe that it does."
1992.92-5653,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2990.908,2999.393,"If you were in the legislature, is there any way you could accommodate Mr. Tigar's objection in this case without giving an independent life option?"
1992.92-5653,1,21374,dana_e_parker,,2999.393,3003.664,With Mr. Tigar's view of culpability?
1992.92-5653,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3003.664,3010.079,Objection in this case that youth should be considered more extensively than it was as a mitigating factor.
1992.92-5653,1,21374,dana_e_parker,,3017.285,3018.264,"No, Your Honor."
1992.92-5653,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3059.621,3060.923,"Thank you, Mrs. Parker."
1992.92-5653,2,36803,michael_e_tigar,,3063.184,3067.919,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1992.92-5653,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3187.756,3189.619,You'll understand that when you get a little older.
1992.92-5653,2,36803,michael_e_tigar,,3231.213,3234.777,"--Justice White, no, I will not be here making that--"
1992.92-5653,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3234.777,3235.228,You will not.
1992.92-5653,2,36803,michael_e_tigar,,3237.338,3240.779,"--I will never make that argument, Justice White, because I don't regard it as--"
1992.92-5653,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3240.779,3241.921,"Well, somebody may not hire you."
1992.92-5653,2,36803,michael_e_tigar,,3243.211,3254.478,"--Well, I have no control over that, but that does not accord with this Court's precedents in any sense of the word; that is to say, this Court has shorn off the mandatory parts."
1992.92-5653,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3272.341,3276.965,Would you have made the arguments that were made in Furman in favor of the defendant?
1992.92-5653,2,36803,michael_e_tigar,,3276.965,3288.721,"--Justice White, had I at that time been asked to argue broadly about the constitutional defects of the death penalty system, I might very well have made such arguments, but I am here--"
1992.92-5653,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3288.721,3292.174,But what if you had been writing a law journal article as a professor?
1992.92-5653,2,36803,michael_e_tigar,,3296.696,3303.151,"--I might very well at that time have said that that is the result that should have obtained in Furman, Justice White."
1992.92-5653,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3329.087,3330.519,"I agree with you, and you should."
1992.92-5653,2,36803,michael_e_tigar,,3331.94,3343.056,"--But... and I think that finally where this comes out is this, that the factual inquiry posed by these two special issues is appropriate perhaps to the guilt phase."
1992.92-5653,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3378.89,3377.059,Flattery is a great thing.
1992.92-5653,2,36803,michael_e_tigar,,3380.593,3386.035,--I feel disabled from responding to it.
1992.92-5653,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3388.357,3389.088,That was my intent.
1992.92-5653,2,36803,michael_e_tigar,,3391.441,3394.444,"--Well, that being the case--"
1992.92-5653,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3394.444,3395.132,I would still like to know--
1992.92-5653,2,36803,michael_e_tigar,,3395.132,3399.075,"--if there are no further questions, I respectfully request leave to yield the remainder of my time."
1992.92-5653,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3399.075,3399.436,--No.
1992.92-5653,2,36803,michael_e_tigar,,3405.601,3415.755,"Because, Justice Stevens, in Morgan the Court dealt with a juror who said I don't care what the instructions are, I won't follow them."
1992.92-5653,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3478.758,3481.189,"One other question, Mr. Tigar."
1992.92-5653,2,36803,michael_e_tigar,,3492.267,3498.89,It would permit it in the sense that--
1992.92-5653,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3498.89,3501.261,"For example, for rape, for--"
1992.92-5653,2,36803,michael_e_tigar,,3501.261,3503.734,--You mean with respect to categories of offenses?
1992.92-5653,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3526.41,3527.401,"Thank you, Mr. Tigar."
