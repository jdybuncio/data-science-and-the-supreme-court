1967.149,0,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,207.431,208.107,I'm sorry.
1967.149,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,209.869,213.999,"That the officer who radioed the head, tell what kind of a car it was?"
1967.149,0,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,213.999,220.695,"Well, all the record shows Sheriff Powers says he radio the head and said I'm chasing an old car and I can't catch it please stop it."
1967.149,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,333.627,337.838,What the petitioners say about his car?
1967.149,0,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,337.838,341.209,"At that point, he said nothing about his car."
1967.149,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,342.415,344.09,But he said he's going to leave it.
1967.149,0,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,344.09,349.376,The record isn't clear when he said that because it was a different witness who testified I got there and I heard that --
1967.149,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,349.376,351.521,(Voice Overlap) clear that he didn't say it now.
1967.149,0,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,351.521,356.944,"It isn't clear whether he said, -- well, he said it before the search was conducted or after the search was conducted."
1967.149,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,356.944,359.894,"But whatever he said, he said he was going to leave his car."
1967.149,0,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,359.894,360.695,"Yes, he said that."
1967.149,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,380.958,382.701,Where was the gun found?

1967.149,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,383.422,383.688,Where was --
1967.149,0,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,383.688,388.375,The gun was found as I understand it under the front right seat.
1967.149,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,398.886,402.27,Could it be seen without taking a seat out of anything?
1967.149,0,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,402.27,405.011,I don't think the record shows whether it could or not.
1967.149,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,406.503,407.635,I didn't understand your answer.
1967.149,0,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,407.635,413.73,"I say, I don't think the record makes that clear, all Sheriff Powers says is, I went out to search the car."
1967.149,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,437.586,440.106,When did he first see the hole in the car?
1967.149,0,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,440.106,442.568,He saw the hole in the car in the highway.
1967.149,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,461.925,466.52,(Inaudible)
1967.149,0,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,466.52,467.7,"Well, he said that."
1967.149,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,467.7,468.391,Yes.
1967.149,0,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,468.391,468.966,But he also said --

1967.149,0,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,471.103,479.208,But he also said that the only information he had is that the car involved in the shooting was an old make model car and that it was coming in his direction.
1967.149,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,479.208,481.88,"Well, when he saw the hole in front this car --"
1967.149,0,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,481.88,484.592,"Well, he made it -- (Voice Overlap) okay."
1967.149,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,495.077,499.248,"Well, didn't he make a search of the car before he saw that hole in it?"
1967.149,0,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,499.248,505.66,"No, the search that he made, he made at the jail at that time he had seen the hole in the car."
1967.149,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,521.009,535.038,Would you mind stating with reference to the time the sequence what happen when he chased the car came on from then on until the -- he went back to search it?
1967.149,0,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,535.038,535.202,From the time?
1967.149,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,535.202,536.875,How long was it?
1967.149,0,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,536.875,538.724,We don't know in minutes how long it was.
1967.149,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,552.306,553.3,To the jail?
1967.149,0,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,553.3,555.402,To the jail as soon as Sheriff --
1967.149,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,555.402,557.122,(Voice Overlap) took the man directly to the jail?
1967.149,0,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,557.122,561.25,"He took the man directly to the jail, sat them down inside the jail."
1967.149,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,570.055,571.53,You mean immediately?
1967.149,0,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,571.53,575.079,Immediately or he said he then went outside and searched the car.
1967.149,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,575.079,577.132,What kind of a (Inaudible)?
1967.149,0,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,577.132,578.808,It was an air rifle.
1967.149,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,578.808,579.692,A rifle?
1967.149,0,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,579.692,580.362,Right.
1967.149,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,580.362,583.888,That's pretty hard to see what (Inaudible).
1967.149,0,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,583.888,587.171,I think that an air rifle can be slipped under the front of most cars.
1967.149,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,589.619,592.689,Is it a (Inaudible)?
1967.149,0,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,592.689,600.681,"I think it was, I think there some reference to his being a Sedan but I'm not sure."
1967.149,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,611.066,616.342,(Voice Overlap) one of those air rifles are just minor does it shoot to kill or hurt?
1967.149,0,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,616.342,618.427,I assume it shoots at least to hurt.
1967.149,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,623.989,624.571,Of what?
1967.149,0,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,624.571,636.443,It shoots a less powerful and a less damaging bullet but I -- there is no suggestion by the petitioners that assuming they were the ones who did it that this was not a serious offense that they would have committed.
1967.149,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,636.443,639.387,(Inaudible)
1967.149,0,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,639.387,642.883,Right.
1967.149,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,678.679,680.336,"It wasn't the point that, was it?"
1967.149,0,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,683.14,689.653,"Well, they disobeyed the court order which said don't hurt people or threaten to harm people by shooting into a house."
1967.149,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,746.747,748.693,That's absolute level of penalty.
1967.149,0,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,748.693,753.142,"The absolute -- that's correct, for a single act of contempt which this clearly was."
1967.149,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,753.142,764.814,So this is a (Inaudible).
1967.149,0,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,764.814,770.128,"Well, I don't know, what you can conclude from the fact that they make that the maximum penalty."
1967.149,1,15701,allen_h_carter,,2100.393,2107.304,Mr. Chief Justice and members of the Court and may it please the Court.
1967.149,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2172.375,2177.677,"Yes, but the only description was that this was an old model car."
1967.149,1,15701,allen_h_carter,,2177.677,2185.213,This is the only description which our Sheriff Powers says that he received at the -- or at the time that --
1967.149,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2185.213,2189.445,(Inaudible)
1967.149,1,15701,allen_h_carter,,2189.445,2192.607,"Well, that's what Sheriff Powers --"
1967.149,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2192.607,2196.125,(Inaudible)
1967.149,1,15701,allen_h_carter,,2196.125,2204.342,"Certainly, the record is not clear as to what Sheriff Kirkpatrick said that he put out."
1967.149,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2310.608,2315.503,Any evidence in the record that the officers knew that when he searched the car?
1967.149,1,15701,allen_h_carter,,2315.503,2320.417,"That the shooting episode had occurred in this joining county, yes sir."
1967.149,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2323.054,2328.008,"But they didn't arrest them for that, they arrested them for reckless driving?"
1967.149,1,15701,allen_h_carter,,2328.008,2329.25,"Yes, that's right."
1967.149,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2329.25,2330.654,Do you think it has any effect?
1967.149,1,15701,allen_h_carter,,2338.367,2360.641,"Well, Your Honor, in answer to that question if I might answer it in this way at the time they were stopped on the highway for reckless driving there was a conversation which took place at that time in involving the defendants and our Sheriff Powers."
1967.149,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2360.641,2362.69,Regarding what?
1967.149,1,15701,allen_h_carter,,2362.69,2367.89,Regarding to bullet hole which was found in the rear of this automobile.
1967.149,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2389.406,2392.535,"When was this conversation, when he first stopped them?"
1967.149,1,15701,allen_h_carter,,2392.535,2393.638,Yes sir.
1967.149,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2401.13,2403.357,Could you point that out Is it -- where is it?
1967.149,1,15701,allen_h_carter,,2404.323,2407.398,It's in the brief yes Your Honor and it's also in the record.
1967.149,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2408.024,2417.263,"Number two, how do you arrest three people for reckless driving on one car?"
1967.149,1,15701,allen_h_carter,,2417.263,2423.912,"Your Honor, I'm not so sure that you can arrest three people for reckless driving but what I'm saying is in this case that --"
1967.149,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2423.912,2427.207,"Well, they were arrested for reckless driving, weren't they?"
1967.149,1,15701,allen_h_carter,,2427.207,2427.529,No sir.
1967.149,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2430.531,2433.838,"Well, another two just going along as aids or --"
1967.149,1,15701,allen_h_carter,,2433.838,2435.728,"No sir, they were being in held --"
1967.149,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2435.728,2437.551,For what?
1967.149,1,15701,allen_h_carter,,2437.551,2442.043,"Actually, they were being detained on no charge immediately after this arrest for --"
1967.149,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2442.043,2444.047,Or just being detained?
1967.149,1,15701,allen_h_carter,,2444.047,2445.196,Yes sir.
1967.149,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2454.179,2460.383,But the only charge to that stage is reckless driving on one and no charge on the other two.
1967.149,1,15701,allen_h_carter,,2460.383,2460.917,That's right.
1967.149,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2460.917,2464.6,And there's a probable cause to search the car?
1967.149,1,15701,allen_h_carter,,2464.6,2471.951,"Well, the person who was charged with reckless driving once the owner of the automobile whose car was searched."
1967.149,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2471.951,2472.606,Mr. Carter.
1967.149,1,15701,allen_h_carter,,2472.606,2473.046,Yes sir.
1967.149,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2473.046,2507.281,"Mr. Gottesman seems to indicate that that the issue of probable cause to search this car in connection with the shooting is not an issue here that apparently maybe he didn't mean to say this but apparently we are to decide this case on the assumption that there is probable cause to search the car next to the shooting and if that so, would you argue that the -- therefore, necessarily probable cause to arrest this man."
1967.149,1,15701,allen_h_carter,,2515.003,2519.699,That was necessary to arrest these men for the shooting before the search.
1967.149,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2582.271,2595.409,"Well, do you claim that this -- wouldn't you say that the validity of this search necessarily address on at least thought they're being probable cause to make that actual shooting?"
1967.149,1,15701,allen_h_carter,,2595.409,2596.848,Yes sir.
1967.149,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2596.848,2603.97,"And without probable cause, you can make the search in connection to shooting that search was invalid?"
1967.149,1,15701,allen_h_carter,,2603.97,2604.636,Yes sir.
1967.149,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2604.636,2614.112,"You're not resting on the any sort of approach that the state can in Harris, just before this Court."
1967.149,1,15701,allen_h_carter,,2614.112,2618.686,"Well, Your Honor we are to say that the Harris case of --"
1967.149,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2618.686,2631.679,(Voice Overlap) have the right to custody of this car to impound it and -- and whether it was the sheriff or may it be somebody else who want to search this car is to inventory.
1967.149,1,15701,allen_h_carter,,2631.679,2655.908,"Well, Your Honor, in the Harris case and also in the Cooper case, I have difficulty in saying where those statutes authorizing these searches merely -- I mean, merely because the statutes provides it, they can be impounded has anything to do with the Fourth Amendment guarantees of the search."
1967.149,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2673.653,2678.349,"Mr. Carter, why don't you get a search warrant?"
1967.149,1,15701,allen_h_carter,,2678.349,2679.174,We are --
1967.149,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2679.174,2683.039,Is there any explanation at the record that why they didn't?
1967.149,1,15701,allen_h_carter,,2683.039,2684.504,No sir.
1967.149,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2685.414,2687.183,Do you have any?
1967.149,1,15701,allen_h_carter,,2687.183,2688.404,No sir.
1967.149,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2710.978,2714.645,How far was the magistrate away in this town?
1967.149,1,15701,allen_h_carter,,2714.645,2715.417,He was --
1967.149,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2715.417,2717.042,How large is the town?
1967.149,1,15701,allen_h_carter,,2717.042,2719.348,"It's very small, 14,000 people."
1967.149,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2719.348,2721.028,"Well, he wasn't too far away from --"
1967.149,1,15701,allen_h_carter,,2721.028,2724.316,"No sir, he wouldn't be too far away of it."
1967.149,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2726.799,2727.977,(Inaudible)
1967.149,1,15701,allen_h_carter,,2727.977,2731.651,And some 12 o'clock at night.
1967.149,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2731.651,2733.195,What time of night was it?
1967.149,1,15701,allen_h_carter,,2733.195,2736.176,It was midnight or rather around that time.
1967.149,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2757.187,2759.794,"Now, they saw a bullet hole in this -- in the back of this car?"
1967.149,1,15701,allen_h_carter,,2759.794,2762.178,Yes sir.
1967.149,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2762.178,2764.917,In the earlier shooting had there been exchange of shots?

1967.149,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2787.128,2791.679,"But not -- where those his words, this shooting episode took place?"
1967.149,1,15701,allen_h_carter,,2795.944,2797.781,"Well, I don't know how you would --"
1967.149,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2797.781,2801.245,"Does the record show what he did say, in other words, I'm interested in the bullet hole?"
1967.149,1,15701,allen_h_carter,,2801.245,2801.71,Yes sir.
1967.149,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2808.828,2810.428,That was a kind of old car.

1967.149,1,15701,allen_h_carter,,2810.561,2810.61,Yes.
1967.149,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2810.61,2818.608,--see that in the record but there was there anything about this shooting episode as you call it would being described as an exchange of shots --
1967.149,1,15701,allen_h_carter,,2818.608,2818.91,There's nothing in there to show --
1967.149,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2818.91,2823.985,(Voice Overlap) along with a simple a stray shot from somebody in an automobile into a house?
1967.149,1,15701,allen_h_carter,,2823.985,2850.77,"There is nothing in the record to show that Sheriff Powers knew that there had been an exchange of gun fire but to point that question out, if it please the Court, I think that any officer would be correct in assuming that where there was a shooting episode that there was an exchange of gun fire and as --"
1967.149,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2850.77,2855.595,"First of all, as I understand it, the word episode doesn't appear in the record."
1967.149,1,15701,allen_h_carter,,2881.295,2882.408,I certainly think it does.
1967.149,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2882.408,2883.368,"Well now, why?"
1967.149,1,15701,allen_h_carter,,2883.368,2906.912,I think the frank that these people when stopped said that it was an old bullet hole which was obviously contrary to the side of it as testified not only by Sheriff Powers but Sheriff Canon to the effect that it was fresh because it had absolutely no rust around it.
1967.149,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2957.288,2958.066,Had been what?
1967.149,1,15701,allen_h_carter,,2958.066,2959.662,Committed.
1967.149,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2959.662,2989.457,"Well, your problem is that seems to me that Supreme Court of Tennessee based its decision on the proposition that the search was made for evidence of the crime for which these people were arrested that's on page 45 of the joint appendix and that would be the crime of reckless driving."
1967.149,1,15701,allen_h_carter,,2989.457,3001.278,"Well, Your Honor I think that the opinion further went on to say that under all the fashion and circumstances in the case that it had met the test of whether or not the search was reasonable."
1967.149,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3001.47,3004.299,Where is that?
1967.149,1,15701,allen_h_carter,,3004.299,3005.347,It's --
1967.149,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3005.347,3011.36,Because on page 45 the -- I'm looking onto this I am.
1967.149,1,15701,allen_h_carter,,3060.242,3075.857,"Well, further I mean, this went on that the search conducted with then, the reasonable limits and I can't speak for a Court to certain what they say and I can't --"
1967.149,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3075.857,3091.381,Within those reasonable limits but the Court says that (a) it's got to be reasonable and (b) that it's got to be for evidence of the crime for which he is arrested and for weapons which might be utilized for assistance or escape.
1967.149,1,15701,allen_h_carter,,3091.381,3117.762,"Your Honor, when they point out this also that immediately after the Sheriff of the adjoining county arrived in which the shooting took place, these men were taken back to Monroe County where the shooting occurred and at that time they were charge for shooting in to this house and certainly --"
1967.149,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3117.762,3120.832,That is by criminal information or criminal charge?
1967.149,1,15701,allen_h_carter,,3120.832,3122.595,Yes sir.
1967.149,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3122.595,3125.438,And that's the one that subsequently been nolle?
1967.149,1,15701,allen_h_carter,,3125.438,3130.83,"Yes sir, that was nolle on prosequi."
1967.149,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3218.395,3224.195,"Well, the Tennessee Supreme Court passed on it in terms of Article VII."
1967.149,1,15701,allen_h_carter,,3224.195,3230.09,"Yes sir, that was the -- I mean, this was in the assignment of error which was right, I mean raised by the petitioners."
1967.149,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3243.115,3247.911,Will you forgive me for reverting to our earlier colloquy?
1967.149,1,15701,allen_h_carter,,3255.041,3255.924,Not.
1967.149,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3263.027,3263.528,Thank you.
1967.149,1,15701,allen_h_carter,,3263.528,3263.967,(Voice Overlap)
1967.149,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3263.967,3273.799,"Would you be prosecuted for anything, any crime in this contempt where this episode that we're talking about it?"
1967.149,1,15701,allen_h_carter,,3273.799,3278.102,"Well, I'll answer this way, if it please the Court."
1967.149,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3287.096,3288.357,Any other copy?
1967.149,1,15701,allen_h_carter,,3288.357,3289.054,That's right.
1967.149,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3289.054,3292.957,Not where the -- not where the shooting took place?
1967.149,1,15701,allen_h_carter,,3292.957,3293.214,No.
1967.149,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3295.958,3296.687,I see.
1967.149,1,15701,allen_h_carter,,3296.687,3319.691,"And immediately after the indictment was presented and so forth they then paid because and the fine -- I mean, in the charge was reduced and under Tennessee law when you nolle on the payment of the cost you cannot thereafter have another indictment return it against you and over if you did if we double jeopardy."
1967.149,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3319.691,3322.601,What was the crime reduced to?
1967.149,1,15701,allen_h_carter,,3322.601,3327.19,It wasn't reduced as such which is dismissed on the payment of the cost.
1967.149,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3330.735,3333.131,Some kind of a compromise reason.
1967.149,1,15701,allen_h_carter,,3333.131,3346.39,"Well, I mean there I can't speak for the Attorney General even there because I wouldn't do him nothing that I was at the trial at that time but it was dismissed."
1967.149,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3346.39,3362.915,"I see your court said that in connection with this arrest that you may issue a search warrant search pursuant to a lawful arrest yet was for reckless driving, was it?"
1967.149,1,15701,allen_h_carter,,3362.915,3364.742,Yes sir.
1967.149,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3364.742,3380.228,The person and property of the person arrested evidence of the crime for which he arrested and for weapon which might be utilized for resistance or escape --
1967.149,1,15701,allen_h_carter,,3380.228,3380.798,Yes sir.
1967.149,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3380.798,3389.143,"-- I presume your argument is that the pistol that have been used for resistance of this case, is that right?"
1967.149,1,15701,allen_h_carter,,3389.143,3406.631,I think that the -- I think that anytime when people have weapon so called in their control I mean that's certainly that they have a right to search for it and ask what the Court held.
1967.149,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3406.631,3425.291,Are you arguing that the fact that there have been this previous shooting whether it was made the basis of an arrest or not would have something to do with the reasonable circumstances in connection with the entire case in determining whether or not there was probable cause?
1967.149,1,15701,allen_h_carter,,3425.291,3427.563,Yes sir.
1967.149,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3427.563,3428.434,"Mr. Carter, --"
1967.149,1,15701,allen_h_carter,,3428.434,3429.454,Yes sir.
1967.149,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3429.454,3442.366,-- at the time the car was searched there was no charge then and against two and reckless driving against third man.
1967.149,1,15701,allen_h_carter,,3442.366,3443.354,That's true.
1967.149,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3443.354,3450.792,"And the all three were in custody in the jail, is that correct?"
1967.149,1,15701,allen_h_carter,,3450.792,3463.573,"Well, Your Honor, they -- as such substantially that is correct but I might say that they were not in a cell as such, they were sitting on the bench as you walk through the front door of the jail but they were not --"
1967.149,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3463.573,3466.994,Could they walk out?
1967.149,1,15701,allen_h_carter,,3466.994,3474.835,"As to the facts as to whether or not they could've walked out, I can only assume that two of them could've walked out."
1967.149,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3478.383,3482.868,"Well, I thought you admitted they were under restraint."
1967.149,1,15701,allen_h_carter,,3482.868,3488.878,I say substantially that they were under restraint to the effect pending further in --
1967.149,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3488.878,3491.551,"Well, restraint means restraints."
1967.149,1,15701,allen_h_carter,,3494.703,3495.835,Yes sir.
1967.149,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3495.835,3504.619,"Well, what danger was a loaded weapon in the car if they could get out to the jail?"
1967.149,1,15701,allen_h_carter,,3504.619,3513.413,"Well, Your Honor I think that would get back to the questions to whether or not the car be held as evidence in the -- if in fact the car could --"
1967.149,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3513.413,3522.372,"Well, do you agree that he didn't search the car for their own protection?"
1967.149,1,15701,allen_h_carter,,3522.372,3528.435,"Well, I -- the record doesn't say while he searched the car but I would only be (Voice Overlap) --"
1967.149,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3528.435,3535.466,"Well, is there any claim made that the Sheriff's searching was own protection?"
1967.149,1,15701,allen_h_carter,,3535.466,3536.306,I don't think so.
1967.149,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3537.106,3537.666,Thank you.
1967.149,1,15701,allen_h_carter,,3537.666,3564.796,I'm saying this that the car was in a public place and that under this -- under the circumstances any one of these men's confederates are associates could've gone to the car and remove evidence which was contained in the car concerning the shooting which occurred in Monroe County.
1967.149,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3564.796,3567.943,"Yes, the policeman was stationed there to watch?"
1967.149,1,15701,allen_h_carter,,3567.943,3568.747,Pardon me?
1967.149,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3568.747,3574.564,"If a sheriff's deputy or policeman was stationed there to watch the car, could they have done it?"
1967.149,1,15701,allen_h_carter,,3574.564,3602.644,Then it would be -- I mean it would go back as to a question of control if the car was in fact being held as evidence then I think that the officers had the right to search the car if in fact it was still under the control of the defendant McKinney then I think that any of his associates are --
1967.149,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3602.644,3604.188,"Well, let's talk on control."
1967.149,1,15701,allen_h_carter,,3606.775,3610.658,As far as the keys -- I don't know who had the keys to the car.
1967.149,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3610.658,3616.559,"Well, you know the defendants didn't have it because they came in the Sheriff's car and somebody else brought their car."
1967.149,1,15701,allen_h_carter,,3616.559,3618.015,That's right.
1967.149,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3622.451,3624.097,He was still under restraint.
1967.149,1,15701,allen_h_carter,,3624.097,3627.875,Yes sir.
1967.149,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3862.652,3863.647,May I ask you?
1967.149,1,15701,allen_h_carter,,3887.75,3898.832,"Well, I would say that under the Sheriff case where the -- it was permitted the six month since it was permitted they tried summarily without a jury."
1967.149,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3972.945,3982.857,"How relevant do you think this pistol was, what's the point that he declared, I think convicted the man on contempt such what you have it?"
1967.149,1,15701,allen_h_carter,,3982.857,3984.146,Yes sir.
1967.149,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3985.265,3988.924,It was all put in the contempt proceeding whether they?
1967.149,1,15701,allen_h_carter,,3988.924,3993.494,It was not presented to the Court in the contempt case.
1967.149,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3993.494,3995.338,"Well, then why is it (Voice Overlap)."
1967.149,1,15701,allen_h_carter,,3995.338,4012.73,"I'll put it this way, it was not ever seen -- I mean, the weapon was never seen by the chancellor of the -- I mean the bullets were never seen by the chancellor."
1967.149,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4023.694,4026.167,Was it introduced.
1967.149,1,15701,allen_h_carter,,4026.167,4033.586,"Well, like I say he said that to treat as filed and withdrawn but it was never seen by the chancellor."
1967.149,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4036.216,4036.543,(Voice Overlap) --
1967.149,1,15701,allen_h_carter,,4036.543,4037.319,-- the adjoining county.
1967.149,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4037.319,4042.348,"It was not introduced in evidence, what does it have to do with this case?"
1967.149,1,15701,allen_h_carter,,4042.348,4054.621,"Well, Your Honor this is -- we go back to the question of the Chapman case concerning the harmless error as I understand things of this nature that you have to show that --"

1967.149,1,15701,allen_h_carter,,4063.573,4070.024,"I can't answer as to the fact that it did without being -- I mean, without speaking for the chancellor."
1967.149,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4082.209,4084.693,Was there any effort motion to suppress it?

1967.149,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4094.282,4099.38,"Suppress the weapon as evidence, was there a motion made to suppress it?"
1967.149,1,15701,allen_h_carter,,4099.38,4099.734,Yes sir.
1967.149,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4099.734,4100.979,If used as evidence?
1967.149,1,15701,allen_h_carter,,4100.979,4101.475,Yes sir.
1967.149,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4101.475,4103.363,And the Court rule on that.
1967.149,1,15701,allen_h_carter,,4103.363,4103.933,Yes sir.
1967.149,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4158.453,4161.219,"But it was there relevant, wasn't it?"
1967.149,1,15701,allen_h_carter,,4161.219,4165.761,"I think for that question that it was relevant, yes sir."
