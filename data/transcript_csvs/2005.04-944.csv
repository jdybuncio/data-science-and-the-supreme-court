2005.04-944,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,5.907,We'll hear argument first today in Arbaugh v. Y & H Corporation.
2005.04-944,0,32829,jeffrey_a_schwartz,,8.064,10.47,Mr. Schwartz.
2005.04-944,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,11.205,10.47,Mr. Schwartz.
2005.04-944,0,32829,jeffrey_a_schwartz,,11.596,14.94,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
2005.04-944,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,94.582,97.63,So you say... so now it's essentially redundant.
2005.04-944,0,32829,jeffrey_a_schwartz,,112.196,113.305,I would agree with that.
2005.04-944,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,116.649,118.884,"In the first sentence, but not in the venue part."
2005.04-944,0,32829,jeffrey_a_schwartz,,118.884,124.979,--Not in the venue part and... and certainly... because it does apply to which district court a case should be brought.
2005.04-944,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,130.841,135.701,"Which is not subject matter jurisdiction, which is what we're concerned with here."
2005.04-944,0,32829,jeffrey_a_schwartz,,135.701,136.013,--Right.
2005.04-944,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,137.31,150.86,"What about the argument, though, that when you're talking about a threshold question like coverage, who the statute covers, that it's quite different from the cause of action cases, many of which you rely on in your brief?"
2005.04-944,0,32829,jeffrey_a_schwartz,,150.86,171.084,"Well, we're talking here about a question of whether or not coverage is subject matter jurisdiction, and it's our position that once you go beyond the text and you start evaluating the various aspects of title VII, Mr. Chief Justice, you are going down a... a slippery slope."
2005.04-944,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,192.431,199.339,It's more a question of... of whether or not the... there's been a violation of title VII.
2005.04-944,0,32829,jeffrey_a_schwartz,,214.873,226.924,"--That's correct, Mr. Chief Justice, but I believe that the analogy applies because it still goes to whether or not you start reading the act beyond the jurisdictional grant."
2005.04-944,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,230.081,242.848,"But in City of... in City of Kenosha, of course, the Court went beyond the jurisdictional grant and it said that the definition of the term person in 1983 raised a jurisdictional question."
2005.04-944,0,32829,jeffrey_a_schwartz,,242.848,260.555,"--Well, I... I would not necessarily agree that that goes beyond the jurisdictional grant because the jurisdictional grant of... contained in 1334... 1343 requires that... that jurisdiction apply against a person acting under color of State law."
2005.04-944,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,298.001,301.455,What's the practical consequence of the one or the other?
2005.04-944,0,32829,jeffrey_a_schwartz,,306.785,307.269,--That's correct.
2005.04-944,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,307.269,315.598,"And number two, the... if it's a jurisdictional question, it would be decided by the... by the judge rather than by the jury?"
2005.04-944,0,32829,jeffrey_a_schwartz,,315.598,316.599,That's correct as well.
2005.04-944,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,341.698,342.745,But that's always the case.
2005.04-944,0,32829,jeffrey_a_schwartz,,360.687,361.265,"Well, I... I think the--"
2005.04-944,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,361.265,363.625,"And yet, you... you felt that some things are jurisdictional."
2005.04-944,0,32829,jeffrey_a_schwartz,,363.625,377.081,"--Well, I... I think if I'm... if I'm an attorney representing a plaintiff and I want to make an evaluation of whether or not I have a claim, I want to first evaluate do I pass a jurisdictional threshold."
2005.04-944,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,388.725,397.038,"Well, but what's the rule that you suggest we look to in deciding whether a provision is jurisdictional?"
2005.04-944,0,32829,jeffrey_a_schwartz,,412.979,420.575,"Well, the rule that has existed for some time now, going back to Bell v. Hood, is a... a fair way to look at this."
2005.04-944,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,441.016,442.392,What would you call this?
2005.04-944,0,32829,jeffrey_a_schwartz,,450.691,451.081,Yes.
2005.04-944,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,451.081,455.848,Or there could be an affirmative defense and you're not claiming the latter.
2005.04-944,0,32829,jeffrey_a_schwartz,,455.848,458.583,It could be an affirmative defense.
2005.04-944,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,458.583,469.82,But you're... you're accepting that it is your burden rather than the employer's to show that the employer had fewer than 15 employees.
2005.04-944,0,32829,jeffrey_a_schwartz,,469.82,471.382,"More than 15, yes, Your Honor."
2005.04-944,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,471.382,472.024,More than.
2005.04-944,0,32829,jeffrey_a_schwartz,,472.024,472.852,Yes.
2005.04-944,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,476.899,480.493,Did you establish that in the course of the proceedings?
2005.04-944,0,32829,jeffrey_a_schwartz,,480.493,482.9,--We did not plead it with particularity.
2005.04-944,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,500.67,502.827,I was going to ask what... how does the waiver work?
2005.04-944,0,32829,jeffrey_a_schwartz,,517.799,520.863,--If it's... if it doesn't go to the subject matter jurisdiction--
2005.04-944,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,520.863,522.456,Under your theory of the case?
2005.04-944,0,32829,jeffrey_a_schwartz,,522.456,526.473,"--then I would say that it is waived, if it's been answered--"
2005.04-944,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,526.473,531.895,"Well, but if it's your burden to prove it, how can it be waived by the defendant?"
2005.04-944,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,533.568,536.146,You mean the judge just has to watch the case sail over the waterfall and--
2005.04-944,0,32829,jeffrey_a_schwartz,,536.146,538.146,"--Well, let's talk about two different examples."
2005.04-944,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,554.103,556.307,"--Well, in my case nobody mentions it but the judge."
2005.04-944,0,32829,jeffrey_a_schwartz,,556.307,557.354,--All right.
2005.04-944,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,568.419,572.639,"Yes, and the... and the judge calls it sua sponte to the attention of the parties."
2005.04-944,0,32829,jeffrey_a_schwartz,,572.639,592.471,"I would think that if the judge in a... in a Federal cause of action was troubled by any element of the claim, based upon his or her own review of the factual setting, it's conceivable that... that the court then could entertain motions on that particular issue."
2005.04-944,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,592.471,593.346,"Well, wait."
2005.04-944,0,32829,jeffrey_a_schwartz,,600.832,601.238,Yes.
2005.04-944,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,601.238,607.521,And it's the definition of employer that says he has to have more than... more than 15 employees.
2005.04-944,0,32829,jeffrey_a_schwartz,,633.433,634.714,"I agree with you, Justice Scalia."
2005.04-944,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,634.714,635.652,I knew you would.
2005.04-944,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,636.105,643.764,But... but maybe... but that doesn't sound like a reasonable agreement.
2005.04-944,0,32829,jeffrey_a_schwartz,,659.392,659.657,No.
2005.04-944,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,671.895,674.442,"In your pleadings, did you say he's an employer?"
2005.04-944,0,32829,jeffrey_a_schwartz,,674.442,674.88,Yes.
2005.04-944,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,674.88,676.224,Did you use the term employer?
2005.04-944,0,32829,jeffrey_a_schwartz,,676.224,677.052,"Yes, Justice Souter."
2005.04-944,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,677.052,677.553,Okay.
2005.04-944,0,32829,jeffrey_a_schwartz,,677.553,683.022,And... and it was admitted and then it was never challenged thereafter until after the verdict.
2005.04-944,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,683.022,687.382,How does it... you... you told us of your extensive experience.
2005.04-944,0,32829,jeffrey_a_schwartz,,709.341,712.356,"I can give you one real world example, Justice Ginsburg."
2005.04-944,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,828.164,829.398,That's true in a lot of areas.
2005.04-944,0,32829,jeffrey_a_schwartz,,840.15,846.057,"--And... and in those cases, the jurisdictional grant in the Jones Act does include elements of jurisdiction."
2005.04-944,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,856.684,862.218,Does it... does it have to be resolved preliminarily?
2005.04-944,0,32829,jeffrey_a_schwartz,,911.79,914.072,--There... there's a few problems with that.
2005.04-944,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,945.359,945.688,Okay.
2005.04-944,0,32829,jeffrey_a_schwartz,,948.407,949.314,Yes.
2005.04-944,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,949.314,959.754,"If the issue is jurisdictional, all the pendant State claims don't belong there and they've got to be chucked out; whereas, if it just goes to the merits, the pendant claims are properly before the court."
2005.04-944,0,32829,jeffrey_a_schwartz,,959.754,960.661,"That's right, Your Honor."
2005.04-944,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,960.661,962.02,That's an important consequence.
2005.04-944,0,32829,jeffrey_a_schwartz,,962.02,974.585,"In addition, the Court's recent opinions addressing subject matter jurisdiction have all gone back, it seems to me, to this question of what does the text say."
2005.04-944,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1002.388,1004.076,"Thank you, Mr. Schwartz."
2005.04-944,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,1006.889,1014.14,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
2005.04-944,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1034.551,1039.663,"Mr. Joseffer, maybe you can raise the podium a bit so the microphone works better."
2005.04-944,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,1040.944,1042.319,Sorry.
2005.04-944,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1081.844,1089.063,What... what about the EEOC having typed the question jurisdictional for administrative processing purposes?
2005.04-944,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,1089.063,1089.798,Right.
2005.04-944,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1173.067,1177.833,Interpreted section... the use of the word person in section 1983.
2005.04-944,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,1177.833,1190.241,"--Interpreted the word person in section 1983 not to apply to municipal corporations, but with respect to the jurisdictional inquiry, it said that the... that 1343 did not confer jurisdiction."
2005.04-944,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1209.606,1212.606,So City of Kenosha was just kind of a silly waste of time.
2005.04-944,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,1212.606,1213.246,Well--
2005.04-944,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1213.246,1215.497,1331 was applicable there as well.
2005.04-944,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,1215.731,1229.687,"--At the time section 1331 had the amount in controversy requirement, and I think that's why now that section 1331 no longer has the amount in controversy requirement, this Court's section 1343 cases have more or less petered out because plaintiffs can now just go under section 1331."
2005.04-944,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1287.966,1288.435,I'm sorry.
2005.04-944,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,1289.873,1292.717,"--Well, the question as to whether there are 15 employees here--"
2005.04-944,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1292.717,1293.03,Right.
2005.04-944,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,1293.03,1295.843,--turns on whether some workers are independent contractors or employees.
2005.04-944,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1307.251,1314.957,"The... the question was whether the truck drivers counted as employees because if they did, they'd have enough?"
2005.04-944,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,1314.957,1315.285,Right.
2005.04-944,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1350.839,1357.778,But that's the... that's the consequence of a determination that it's jurisdictional in any case.
2005.04-944,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,1357.997,1360.669,"That's correct, and there... there are circumstances--"
2005.04-944,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1360.669,1367.921,"I mean, if you had a case where you didn't dispute that the issue was jurisdictional and there had been a jury trial on the pendant State law claims, we'd still have to throw that out."
2005.04-944,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,1368.14,1373.718,"--Yes, but I think that's one reason that Congress does not ordinarily make jurisdiction turn on those types of facts."
2005.04-944,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1501.263,1502.935,"Thank you, Mr. Joseffer."
2005.04-944,2,17955,brett_john_prendergast,,1505.279,1513.141,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court--"
2005.04-944,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1561.275,1565.745,There was no... there was no allegation that the plaintiff was employed by your client?
2005.04-944,2,17955,brett_john_prendergast,,1565.745,1575.997,"There was an allegation, Your Honor, that the plaintiff was employed by the company, but there was no allegation that Y & H was an employer as the term is defined in title VII."
2005.04-944,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1575.997,1576.701,Was the--
2005.04-944,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1576.701,1578.67,Was the word employer used in the pleadings?
2005.04-944,2,17955,brett_john_prendergast,,1578.67,1584.171,"I don't recall, Your Honor, whether or not the word employer was used."
2005.04-944,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1591.094,1591.313,No.
2005.04-944,2,17955,brett_john_prendergast,,1598.831,1602.003,"I'm... I'm not sure, Your Honor."
2005.04-944,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1602.003,1603.941,Do we have the complaint in--
2005.04-944,2,17955,brett_john_prendergast,,1603.941,1605.238,"In the record, yes, Your Honor."
2005.04-944,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1605.238,1612.521,"Was there an allegation that the company, petitioner, or whatever it was... that they violated the act?"
2005.04-944,2,17955,brett_john_prendergast,,1612.521,1614.037,"There was an allegation, Your Honor, that--"
2005.04-944,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1614.037,1619.334,I... I guess that... they must have thought that there were 15 or more employees because otherwise you wouldn't have.
2005.04-944,2,17955,brett_john_prendergast,,1619.334,1619.788,--Right.
2005.04-944,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1636.855,1637.136,Was that denied?
2005.04-944,2,17955,brett_john_prendergast,,1637.136,1638.73,That was admitted.
2005.04-944,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1651.967,1652.326,You denied it.
2005.04-944,2,17955,brett_john_prendergast,,1668.236,1669.674,"--Well, there was... but--"
2005.04-944,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1669.674,1673.316,"And if the odds are he was, they win in the absence of any evidence."
2005.04-944,2,17955,brett_john_prendergast,,1673.316,1682.771,"--Justice Breyer, if an employer... and... and I disagree with the position that it's... I... I think it is an element of the merits in addition to being an element of jurisdiction."
2005.04-944,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1691.147,1692.85,Then I guess maybe you could have appealed on that point.
2005.04-944,2,17955,brett_john_prendergast,,1693.617,1695.336,"--No, Your Honor, because--"
2005.04-944,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1695.336,1697.868,Then I guess it's waived unless it's jurisdictional.
2005.04-944,2,17955,brett_john_prendergast,,1700.041,1702.682,--And which we maintain that it is jurisdictional.
2005.04-944,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1706.65,1710.949,I never heard of a point on the merits that if you... you think you're right.
2005.04-944,2,17955,brett_john_prendergast,,1717.106,1734.157,"--No, Your Honor, we didn't raise it in the appeal, the reason being that while the matter was still pending in the trial court, in addition to the motion to dismiss for jurisdiction, which was granted, there was a motion of renewed judgment as a matter of law, which included the plaintiff's failure to maintain their burden of proof."
2005.04-944,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1734.157,1734.923,And did you win or lose on that?
2005.04-944,2,17955,brett_john_prendergast,,1734.923,1738.299,"That was dismissed as moot because of the jurisdictional issue, Your Honor."
2005.04-944,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1753.708,1760.459,What other aspects of title VII do you think are jurisdictional?
2005.04-944,2,17955,brett_john_prendergast,,1760.459,1776.291,"I think the other aspects... and clearly, this has not been the subject of great research... would be the other ones that designate the scope or the coverage of the act, for example, especially as it relates to employer."
2005.04-944,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1815.127,1819.269,Do they hold that the plaintiff must allege the employer is not an Indian tribe?
2005.04-944,2,17955,brett_john_prendergast,,1819.956,1820.926,--I'm sorry.
2005.04-944,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1820.926,1821.457,Over here.
2005.04-944,2,17955,brett_john_prendergast,,1831.959,1836.07,"I don't think they got into that matter, Justice Stevens."
2005.04-944,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1849.088,1861.575,"Do you interpret those cases as, in fact, holding that if there was a trial and a judgment in favor of the plaintiff against what turns out later to be an Indian tribe, that after the case is taken up on appeal, the Indian tribe can have the judgment set aside?"
2005.04-944,2,17955,brett_john_prendergast,,1861.575,1870.718,"--Yes, Your Honor, because the... the cases did clearly hold that the matter of... as an Indian tribe was a matter of subject matter jurisdiction."
2005.04-944,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1881.126,1883.861,"--Did it, in fact, come up in that posture in the case?"
2005.04-944,2,17955,brett_john_prendergast,,1905.695,1907.07,"--No, Your Honor."
2005.04-944,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1914.43,1925.714,"When... if... if it's brought up promptly, it really doesn't matter, does it, whether you label it 12(b)(1) jurisdiction or 12(b)(6), failure to state a claim?"
2005.04-944,2,17955,brett_john_prendergast,,1936.623,1943.686,I... I think the effect could be different when you raise it.
2005.04-944,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1975.896,1977.101,Mr. Prendergast--
2005.04-944,2,17955,brett_john_prendergast,,1977.101,1977.46,Yes.
2005.04-944,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1977.46,1991.243,--my problem with... with your... your contention is that I don't know how it is that you... that you intuit that this one definition is jurisdictional.
2005.04-944,2,17955,brett_john_prendergast,,1999.105,1999.981,"Yes, Your Honor."
2005.04-944,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1999.981,2004.153,There are 13 other definitions in section 1701.
2005.04-944,2,17955,brett_john_prendergast,,2028.251,2030.627,"No, Your Honor."
2005.04-944,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2030.627,2046.537,"Will you challenge... well, why are you challenging jurisdiction when you're... when you're saying the... the definition of... of employer has not been met, but you are not challenging jurisdiction when you say the definition of on the basis of sex has not been met."
2005.04-944,2,17955,brett_john_prendergast,,2048.568,2058.445,I think the distinction is similar to an Aldinger/Kenosha type distinction.
2005.04-944,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2070.464,2071.697,"Yes, I... I understand that."
2005.04-944,2,17955,brett_john_prendergast,,2071.697,2072.449,And... and--
2005.04-944,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2072.449,2073.402,That... that's what it comes down to.
2005.04-944,2,17955,brett_john_prendergast,,2073.402,2073.996,--And... and--
2005.04-944,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2073.996,2075.339,But how do you know--
2005.04-944,2,17955,brett_john_prendergast,,2075.339,2076.652,"--Well, how--"
2005.04-944,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2076.652,2079.793,--If both definitions in section 701--
2005.04-944,2,17955,brett_john_prendergast,,2079.793,2081.466,--How... how do you know--
2005.04-944,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2081.466,2084.029,--why does one of them express one thing and another not express--
2005.04-944,2,17955,brett_john_prendergast,,2084.029,2094.188,"--Justice Scalia, the way you know is because you look at the logical deductions that can be drawn from the congressional statutes, as this Court suggested in Aldinger."
2005.04-944,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2114.41,2123.21,--But the practical consequences of affirming here are severe in terms of handling these cases.
2005.04-944,2,17955,brett_john_prendergast,,2144.761,2150.996,"Justice O'Connor, I would say the... the consequences of not affirming are even more severe."
2005.04-944,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2159.968,2166.703,"Yes, but it's entirely in the hands of the defendant to raise some objection."
2005.04-944,2,17955,brett_john_prendergast,,2175.534,2176.049,--But one--
2005.04-944,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2176.049,2176.893,--we didn't have 15.
2005.04-944,2,17955,brett_john_prendergast,,2176.893,2194.632,"--one... one of the... one of the concerns, I believe, that Congress did have with respect to small employers was the fact that in terms of small employers, you are dealing with less sophisticated litigants, less sophisticated litigants with less access to legal resources that bigger companies have."
2005.04-944,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2194.632,2197.804,Were you representing this employer at the time?
2005.04-944,2,17955,brett_john_prendergast,,2197.804,2198.898,"No, Your Honor."
2005.04-944,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2200.726,2204.758,What's... what's wrong with the rule?
2005.04-944,2,17955,brett_john_prendergast,,2213.026,2214.135,I think--
2005.04-944,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2214.135,2217.026,It would make the future cases a lot easier to decide.
2005.04-944,2,17955,brett_john_prendergast,,2217.026,2228.764,"--I think that would be contrary, however, Mr. Chief Justice, to the previous holdings of this Court where they say you do look to the logical deductions--"
2005.04-944,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2228.764,2229.154,"Well, it's--"
2005.04-944,2,17955,brett_john_prendergast,,2229.154,2230.718,--that you look to all the statutes.
2005.04-944,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2278.352,2279.977,May I go back to Zipes?
2005.04-944,2,17955,brett_john_prendergast,,2327.441,2329.504,"--Yes, Justice Ginsburg."
2005.04-944,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2385.97,2389.205,"Yes, but now we know it's... EEOC has changed."
2005.04-944,2,17955,brett_john_prendergast,,2389.205,2391.283,"Seeing the errors of their ways, I guess."
2005.04-944,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2391.283,2404.067,"But why... now that we do have Zipes, why should the number of employees be treated any differently than that rigid time line in... in Zipes?"
2005.04-944,2,17955,brett_john_prendergast,,2404.067,2424.493,"Your Honor, I think the reason that the number of employees should be different... treated differently is because we go back to the Aldinger question, and the Aldinger question is this Court has to decide did Congress want to give this type of jurisdiction to the lower Federal courts."
2005.04-944,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2424.493,2426.932,But that was a pendant jurisdiction case.
2005.04-944,2,17955,brett_john_prendergast,,2427.869,2430.557,"Aldinger dealt with a pendant party issue, yes, Your Honor."
2005.04-944,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2484.742,2502.573,"--Well, you just used an interesting word because there are litigants who can claim complete immunity from liability, but that immunity, whether it's absolute or qualified, doesn't go to the court's subject matter jurisdiction."
2005.04-944,2,17955,brett_john_prendergast,,2505.682,2507.043,"True, Justice Ginsburg."
2005.04-944,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2565.055,2570.134,Or leave it to the States that often do cover smaller shops.
2005.04-944,2,17955,brett_john_prendergast,,2570.134,2573.432,"Yes, Your Honor, or leave it to the States and let the States do it."
2005.04-944,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2596.296,2603.282,"Well, that... that argument doesn't apply to absolute immunity cases, and yet in absolute immunity cases, once again, it's clear there's jurisdiction."
2005.04-944,2,17955,brett_john_prendergast,,2607.127,2615.941,"--The absolute immunity, Justice Souter, that I'm most familiar with would be prosecutorial immunity."
2005.04-944,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2626.365,2629.366,But we have to determine whether he's acting as a prosecutor.
2005.04-944,2,17955,brett_john_prendergast,,2638.4,2642.197,"It certainly... yes, Your Honor, I will concede it's a different kind of inquiry."
2005.04-944,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2655.825,2660.217,But I... I don't see why the same argument can't be made with respect to prosecutors.
2005.04-944,2,17955,brett_john_prendergast,,2696.224,2699.35,"Another... well, Your Honor, I'll offer another distinction then."
2005.04-944,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2705.336,2706.633,That's right.
2005.04-944,2,17955,brett_john_prendergast,,2706.633,2707.43,--court created defenses.
2005.04-944,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2799.731,2802.372,"Well, why can't get they get the protections through summary judgment?"
2005.04-944,2,17955,brett_john_prendergast,,2802.372,2807.982,"I think they would be offered some level of protection, Justice Souter, through summary judgment."
2005.04-944,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2814.499,2815.969,"Among other things, you... you've got to do it up front."
2005.04-944,2,17955,brett_john_prendergast,,2815.969,2836.255,"--It's... it's a different standard as well, Your Honor, because under summary judgment, a plaintiff has it within their capability... have to view all the inferences in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, and... and the small business could end up being dragged into the litigation further and further than I think Congress intended."
2005.04-944,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2836.255,2847.163,"Well, if... if we're worried about dragging people into litigation, I presume Congress didn't intend, as a... as a general matter, to allow the... the situation that we've got here."
2005.04-944,2,17955,brett_john_prendergast,,2860.056,2871.513,"Your Honor, actually I... I would not have viewed it as outside of Congress' contemplation or intent because Congress... and I think this is an important part of legislative history."
2005.04-944,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2933.776,2934.871,My... my point--
2005.04-944,2,17955,brett_john_prendergast,,2934.871,2935.402,And Congress did not--
2005.04-944,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2935.402,2935.871,--my point is not--
2005.04-944,2,17955,brett_john_prendergast,,2935.871,2936.433,--seek a change.
2005.04-944,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2936.433,2953.28,"--my point is not that Congress in some specific sense, when it establishes a jurisdictional requirement, does not intend the occasional costs that the system has to bear by virtue of treating that requirement as jurisdictional."
2005.04-944,2,17955,brett_john_prendergast,,3000.697,3003.823,"And... and, Justice Souter, I understand that point."
2005.04-944,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3076.62,3078.652,"--In other words, it doesn't make a whole lot of difference."
2005.04-944,2,17955,brett_john_prendergast,,3078.652,3081.136,I think--
2005.04-944,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3081.136,3082.606,I'm not sure that helps your case.
2005.04-944,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3083.466,3093.17,--Does it make a difference on the... the... does the categorization make a difference on the relative time of the inquiry for the 15 employees?
2005.04-944,2,17955,brett_john_prendergast,,3105.876,3115.315,--I... I believe that the... the case law has uniformly held that you look at the time of the discrimination to determine the number of employees.
2005.04-944,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3115.315,3117.175,Even... even if it's a question of jurisdiction.
2005.04-944,2,17955,brett_john_prendergast,,3117.175,3119.208,"Even if it's a question of jurisdiction, yes, Your Honor."
2005.04-944,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3138.29,3142.228,It certainly matters for plaintiffs in this situation.
2005.04-944,2,17955,brett_john_prendergast,,3142.228,3142.822,In this particular--
2005.04-944,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3142.822,3147.526,It certainly matters from the defendant's point of view too.
2005.04-944,2,17955,brett_john_prendergast,,3162.092,3169.734,"--And, Your Honor, and I would urge that those kind of matters that need to be addressed are best addressed by the court as opposed to by a jury."
2005.04-944,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3175.595,3188.957,"From the... from the point of view of a defendant who thinks I'm going to fight this case on the merits, but if I lose, I still have this ace up my sleeve."
2005.04-944,2,17955,brett_john_prendergast,,3188.957,3209.915,"--I just... Your Honor, I simply do not believe a defendant would generally do that because, as I pointed out in my brief, the problem with that is if I'm representing the defendant, all right, and I'm going to defend my case on the merits and I know I got this 15 employee question here, I go to trial, let's suppose I win."
2005.04-944,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3227.669,3236.936,That sounds like a good reason why a court should think long and hard about categorizing this as a question of subject matter jurisdiction.
2005.04-944,2,17955,brett_john_prendergast,,3236.936,3241.859,"Your Honor, but again, I... I simply don't believe that that's going to be a problem that's going to come up."
2005.04-944,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3275.694,3277.757,"Well, it would be simultaneous."
2005.04-944,2,17955,brett_john_prendergast,,3291.714,3295.277,"Your Honor, I... I heard that argument as well."
2005.04-944,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3313.219,3314.86,"Thank you, Mr. Prendergast."
2005.04-944,2,17955,brett_john_prendergast,,3314.86,3315.547,Thank you.
2005.04-944,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3315.547,3318.048,"Mr. Schwartz, you have 3 minutes remaining."
2005.04-944,3,32829,jeffrey_a_schwartz,,3318.048,3322.017,"If there are no additional questions, I... I have nothing further."
2005.04-944,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3322.017,3331.675,Do you think... do you think it's possible that... that Indian tribes could be jurisdictional but an employer couldn't?
2005.04-944,3,32829,jeffrey_a_schwartz,,3361.041,3362.62,"Yes, I agree with that."
2005.04-944,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3362.62,3365.495,So you're... you're not arguing for the Indian tribes here.
2005.04-944,3,32829,jeffrey_a_schwartz,,3365.495,3369.293,"As... well, my... I leave that to other people."
2005.04-944,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3386.735,3391.985,May I ask you if the practice of law has returned to normal in New Orleans?
2005.04-944,3,32829,jeffrey_a_schwartz,,3391.985,3393.329,No.
2005.04-944,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3413.255,3417.74,"Thank you, counsel."
