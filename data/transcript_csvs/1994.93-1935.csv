1994.93-1935,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,11.9,"We'll hear argument next in Number 93-1935, Curtiss-Wright Corporation v. Frank C. Schoonejongen."
1994.93-1935,0,35025,laurence_reich,,66.073,68.956,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1994.93-1935,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,287.585,291.404,"Well, Mr. Reich... you say Reich, not Reich?"
1994.93-1935,0,35025,laurence_reich,,291.404,292.646,"--Yes, Justice."
1994.93-1935,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,292.646,313.66,"Okay, Mr. Reich, what do you make of the requirement in section 402(b)(3) that says, not only must there be a procedure for amending the plan, but also a procedure for identifying persons with amendment authority?"
1994.93-1935,0,35025,laurence_reich,,318.144,324.489,"In many cases, there might, indeed, be a need for a procedure for identifying."
1994.93-1935,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,369.429,373.52,"So as applied here, you think its surplusage?"
1994.93-1935,0,35025,laurence_reich,,373.52,375.063,"--I'm sorry, I didn't hear the word."
1994.93-1935,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,375.063,391.492,"As applied in this case with a single employer voluntary welfare benefit plan, is the identification of the person who has the authority to amend just surplusage?"
1994.93-1935,0,35025,laurence_reich,,392.854,394.453,I would think it would be.
1994.93-1935,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,420.74,422.092,A multiemployer plan--
1994.93-1935,0,35025,laurence_reich,,422.092,423.004,Particularly a multi--
1994.93-1935,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,423.004,426.904,"--you wouldn't know who would have the authority, unless it was stated."
1994.93-1935,0,35025,laurence_reich,,426.904,429.086,--It would be questionable.
1994.93-1935,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,455.493,472.064,"Well, Mr. Reich, would you accept the proposition that the... or the position that in fact there is a procedure in your plan for identifying the persons with authority, and that procedure is implicit in your designation as... of the company as, in fact, the entity that can amend?"
1994.93-1935,0,35025,laurence_reich,,472.064,473.185,"I would, sir."
1994.93-1935,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,473.185,484.434,"And that that carries the implication that the company could amend through the action or authority of its board of directors, so that you in fact satisfy the procedure-identification criterion here?"
1994.93-1935,0,35025,laurence_reich,,484.434,498.602,"I would, Justice Souter, and I would say further that it would not merely be the board of directors, since a corporation may act by whomever the... has authority within the corporation for so acting."
1994.93-1935,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,498.602,505.057,"In fact, that's why Judge Roth thought you were... that you struck out, because it wasn't done by the board of directors, isn't that right?"
1994.93-1935,0,35025,laurence_reich,,505.057,517.054,"Well, Judge Roth, there's a distinction... if you read the footnote, there is a distinction between what Judge Roth said in the footnote and what was derived from that."
1994.93-1935,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,528.622,532.055,"Well, why did she come out in the end ruling against you?"
1994.93-1935,0,35025,laurence_reich,,532.055,536.056,--It's somewhat inscrutable.
1994.93-1935,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,537.538,539.899,May I suggest this as a hypothesis?
1994.93-1935,0,35025,laurence_reich,,564.025,569.399,"--Possibly, but the footnote says that... refers because it wasn't done by the board of directors."
1994.93-1935,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,585.878,634.541,"Well, it does as a matter of general corporation law, but isn't there a problem in this statute in relying upon that kind of identification, because at least it seems to me a likely reading of subsection (3) that by requiring a procedure for identifying the persons with authority, what Congress is trying to get at is, is to provide a means by which somebody who wants to know what the current status of the plan is can determine who to ask and, therefore, unless there is in effect something of record somewhere showing who might be amending this, that it would not satisfy the provisions of subsection (3), even though, under general corporation law, an undesignated individual might have authority to do something."
1994.93-1935,0,35025,laurence_reich,,634.541,641.725,"Well, there is one... there is one flaw, and perhaps a second flaw, but one immediate flaw, Justice Souter, in that--"
1994.93-1935,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,641.725,644.386,"May I compliment you on the way you pronounce ""flaw""?"
1994.93-1935,0,35025,laurence_reich,,648.89,650.25,"--We have that way in New Jersey, sir."
1994.93-1935,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,650.25,653.923,It rhymes with law... law.
1994.93-1935,0,35025,laurence_reich,,655.275,670.054,The term that the Congress used was (3)(9) of ERISA as including a corporation.
1994.93-1935,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,684.804,700.993,"Well, I'll grant you that, but isn't it also the case that if Congress did not want some means of identifying institutionally who could take the action, then Congress wouldn't have bothered to be talking generally about identifying individuals."
1994.93-1935,0,35025,laurence_reich,,718.765,757.16,"Well, that... there is a gloss of legislative history on this that may suggest, Justice Souter, to the contrary, because when you witness the fact that the predecessor provision of this in H.R. 2 gave the plan administrator the authority in certain limited situations to amend the plan, and this took that and simply allowed the plan to provide for who might amend the plan."
1994.93-1935,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,782.018,793.194,"But under the earlier scheme, anybody who wanted to know if there had been an unpublished amendment would know enough to ask... what was it, the administrator, I guess you said?"
1994.93-1935,0,35025,laurence_reich,,793.194,794.055,--Yes.
1994.93-1935,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,794.055,799.818,Yes... would know enough to ask the administrator in order to make sure there wasn't something not on the record.
1994.93-1935,0,35025,laurence_reich,,799.818,819.081,"Yes, but the administrator could have been the company, as it can be and frequently is, under ERISA as enacted, so you get back to the... it's somewhat circular, because you get back to the fact that you ask the company, as the plan administrator, or you ask the company as the plan sponsor."
1994.93-1935,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,820.653,821.873,"Well, let's take your theory."
1994.93-1935,0,35025,laurence_reich,,848.139,853.585,"Well, there probably could be a variety... well, the bylaws wouldn't... probably not be there anyway."
1994.93-1935,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,854.714,855.195,Yes.
1994.93-1935,0,35025,laurence_reich,,856.156,869.774,"--The person who acts for the administrator is designated in the summary plan description, and that person... that person could be inquired of to... as to whether or not there has been an amendment."
1994.93-1935,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,920.156,921.508,"Well, let me step back, if I may."
1994.93-1935,0,35025,laurence_reich,,956.443,957.812,Congress did say that.
1994.93-1935,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,957.812,959.324,"Then why did it say this, too?"
1994.93-1935,0,35025,laurence_reich,,959.324,966.3,I think it's basically the outgrowth... and this is primarily for--
1994.93-1935,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,966.3,967.942,May I... I'm sorry.
1994.93-1935,0,35025,laurence_reich,,969.061,969.692,"--Yes, of course."
1994.93-1935,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,969.692,970.693,--ask one question before I lose it?
1994.93-1935,0,35025,laurence_reich,,978.81,980.61,That is correct.
1994.93-1935,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,980.61,986.845,"So that if you went to the administrator and said, let me see what you've got, technically the administrator might not have every amendment?"
1994.93-1935,0,35025,laurence_reich,,986.845,989.716,"No, I should retract my agreement."
1994.93-1935,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1018.114,1019.005,But the administrator would.
1994.93-1935,0,35025,laurence_reich,,1019.005,1025.771,"And the administrator would, particularly where, as here, the administrator and the plan sponsor are one and the same."
1994.93-1935,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1025.771,1028.712,And that... isn't that critical to your case?
1994.93-1935,0,35025,laurence_reich,,1043.622,1045.385,"That is correct, Justice Ginsburg."
1994.93-1935,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1064.896,1071.731,Did this company do any more thinking about it than simply copy the prototype plan that IRS put out in that respect?
1994.93-1935,0,35025,laurence_reich,,1071.731,1077.395,"--Well, this wasn't... this did not adopt the prototype plan, but if it had--"
1994.93-1935,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1077.395,1078.427,This clause.
1994.93-1935,0,35025,laurence_reich,,1078.427,1082.077,"--Well, it happens to virtually coincide with the prototype plan."
1994.93-1935,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1083.289,1099.859,"Mr. Reich, if we think that the Third Circuit erred in saying that there was no procedure for amending the plan here, what do we do about the identification issue?"
1994.93-1935,0,35025,laurence_reich,,1108.006,1127.889,"That might... that might be a possibility, but I would suggest that in any event that does not reach basically the second... the critical issue of remedy, whether or not, assuming arguendo that there was not an adequate procedure, whether or not the Third Circuit... whether or not there is a remedy of invalidation."
1994.93-1935,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1175.4,1181.143,"Well, what if it turned out that in fact no amendment had been adopted?"
1994.93-1935,0,35025,laurence_reich,,1183.365,1188.616,--It was not... it was not... it was in... there was a provision in the plan description.
1994.93-1935,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1209.972,1219.318,"I'm just asking, if I may, what if the facts in a given case showed there had been no plan amendment."
1994.93-1935,0,35025,laurence_reich,,1223.422,1226.044,"Well, it's not that there had been no plan amendment."
1994.93-1935,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1228.994,1233.226,"I know that's your position in this case, but what if there had not been, could a court not say so?"
1994.93-1935,0,35025,laurence_reich,,1233.226,1237.189,"--Well, it's not that the court said that there was no plan amendment."
1994.93-1935,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1247.939,1249.198,"Yes, you're... that's okay."
1994.93-1935,1,38746,richard_p_bress,,1293.968,1311.769,"If you agree with the Government's position that the Third Circuit got it wrong and there was, in fact, a procedure in this case, we believe that the correct result would be to remand back to the Third Circuit to determine whether the company acted to promulgate the amendment in this case."
1994.93-1935,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1323.177,1328.322,Does that authority have to be formalized in some way in the Government's view?
1994.93-1935,1,38746,richard_p_bress,,1328.322,1330.062,"No, it does not."
1994.93-1935,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1337.936,1343.799,So you disagree with Judge Roth and her view in this case on that point?
1994.93-1935,1,38746,richard_p_bress,,1343.799,1345.131,I think it's un--
1994.93-1935,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1345.131,1348.934,She seemed to think it had to be by some action of the board of directors.
1994.93-1935,1,38746,richard_p_bress,,1348.934,1353.887,--I think it's unclear from footnote 3 what Judge Roth's view was.
1994.93-1935,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1361.431,1362.783,I'm not sure--
1994.93-1935,1,38746,richard_p_bress,,1367.816,1381.737,"She may have concluded that in this case it was neither expressly delegated... the authority was neither expressly delegated to those individuals, or that it was neither expressly delegated nor impliedly delegated."
1994.93-1935,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1382.705,1384.607,How could she have made that conclusion on this record?
1994.93-1935,1,38746,richard_p_bress,,1384.607,1393.692,--There was a significant record before the district court regarding the manner in which the amendment was promulgated.
1994.93-1935,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1398.046,1405.641,"Well, the district court hadn't made any finding on it, and it would be extraordinary for a court of appeals judge to do that in the first instance."
1994.93-1935,1,38746,richard_p_bress,,1405.641,1408.953,"I agree with you, Judge Ginsburg, that it would be extraordinary."
1994.93-1935,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1414.208,1425.234,"Mr. Bress, on your view, why did the statute refer to procedures for identifying those with authority, as opposed simply to requiring procedures for amendment?"
1994.93-1935,1,38746,richard_p_bress,,1425.234,1436.011,"There will be some circumstances in which it will not be clear who the persons are who have the authority to amend, and let me give an example, because I think that's the best--"
1994.93-1935,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1436.011,1438.141,"You mean, it will not be clear as a matter of corporation law."
1994.93-1935,1,38746,richard_p_bress,,1438.141,1440.815,"--It will not be clear as a matter of... well, let me step back from that."
1994.93-1935,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1503.194,1512.17,"And you would then know enough to go to someone who speaks for the sponsoring organization and say, did you make any changes?"
1994.93-1935,1,38746,richard_p_bress,,1512.17,1515.732,"Yes, you would, but--"
1994.93-1935,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1515.732,1524.789,"In other words, if you know who the sponsoring organization is, I suppose you can go to its president or its secretary, or somebody who keeps its records, and say, did you make any changes with respect to this plan."
1994.93-1935,1,38746,richard_p_bress,,1524.789,1528.001,"--You could do that, but if I might take a step backwards, we do not--"
1994.93-1935,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1528.001,1531.124,But isn't that the reason for referring to identification?
1994.93-1935,1,38746,richard_p_bress,,1540.991,1541.399,--No.
1994.93-1935,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1542.361,1542.841,Why not?
1994.93-1935,1,38746,richard_p_bress,,1542.841,1556.81,"--We believe that the purposes of 402(b)(3) is primarily functional, and that purpose is to make a plan amendable by providing a mechanism or a way that it can be amended, and to delegate the power to amend to an individual."
1994.93-1935,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1559.07,1567.017,"Are you saying that it was to provide clarity for the plan administrator in these multiemployer situations, rather than to protect beneficiaries?"
1994.93-1935,1,38746,richard_p_bress,,1567.806,1572.2,"--Yes, although I wouldn't restrict it to simply multiemployer circumstances."
1994.93-1935,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1572.2,1578.064,"--Any circumstance about where there might be ambiguity for the plan administrator, but the--"
1994.93-1935,1,38746,richard_p_bress,,1578.064,1585.659,"That is our view, Justice Ginsburg, and we don't believe that that leaves the beneficiaries and participants out in the cold."
1994.93-1935,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1613.236,1624.005,--Has the IRS modified its prototype plan in response to the Third Circuit's decision?
1994.93-1935,1,38746,richard_p_bress,,1624.005,1624.914,"No, it has not."
1994.93-1935,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1821.213,1823.186,"Thank you, Mr. Bress."
1994.93-1935,1,38746,richard_p_bress,,1823.186,1823.827,--Thank you.
1994.93-1935,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1823.827,1826.067,"Mr. Kennedy, we'll hear from you."
1994.93-1935,2,42910,thomas_m_kennedy,,1826.067,1835.384,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1994.93-1935,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1934.548,1937.76,"You use the phrase, casual redrafting, Mr. Kennedy."
1994.93-1935,2,42910,thomas_m_kennedy,,1944.525,1947.237,"The term ""casual"" is taken from the findings of the district court, Your Honor."
1994.93-1935,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1947.237,1949.789,"Well, what was the district court thinking about, do you think--"
1994.93-1935,2,42910,thomas_m_kennedy,,1949.789,1950.56,The district court--
1994.93-1935,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1950.56,1951.288,--since I wasn't there?
1994.93-1935,2,42910,thomas_m_kennedy,,1951.288,1974.954,"--The district court, Your Honor, was referring to the fact that at trial the company representatives testified to a 3-year process in which drafts of a proposed summary plan description were reviewed at various points by various officials and there was not even... they were not even able to establish at the trial who had been responsible for initiating the particular language which resulted in the deprivation of these benefits."
1994.93-1935,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1999.01,2001.32,I'm not sure you have any grievance for all of that.
1994.93-1935,2,42910,thomas_m_kennedy,,2020.063,2032.352,"--The grievance, Your Honor, is that the lack of a procedure meant that the individuals who inserted this language into this plan never recognized or were aware that an effective amendment was being made."
1994.93-1935,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2032.352,2037.766,"Well, maybe there's no effective amendment, but that's a question of corporate law."
1994.93-1935,2,42910,thomas_m_kennedy,,2047.632,2049.822,"We have several problems with that approach, Your Honor."

1994.93-1935,2,42910,thomas_m_kennedy,,2077.512,2079.233,"Yes, it would, and--"
1994.93-1935,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2079.233,2090.059,"So how, then... why, then, do you argue that somehow as a matter of law, of Federal law, we should read a corporate governance requirement into the statute?"
1994.93-1935,2,42910,thomas_m_kennedy,,2090.059,2097.554,"--Because if we are reading a corporate governance requirement, it's stemming from a legal default by Curtiss-White Corporation as plan sponsor."
1994.93-1935,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2103.098,2127.745,"But they did put in a provision that coincides with the prototype plan put out by the IRS as a model, and it's a little hard then to come down on a company for following a form or coming up with a form that coincides with a form that a Government agency puts out as meeting the requirements of the statute."
1994.93-1935,2,42910,thomas_m_kennedy,,2127.745,2144.054,"Well, even Hall of Famers strike out occasionally, Your Honor, and in this case, the Internal Revenue Service does not appear to have followed either the language or what we regard as the expressed intent of Congress, and we think it's significant that the Internal Revenue Service has no special regulatory authority for issues arising under title I of ERISA."
1994.93-1935,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2145.817,2154.523,"Well, Mr. Kennedy, what if the effect of... on your clients of this casually drafted... had been exactly the opposite."
1994.93-1935,2,42910,thomas_m_kennedy,,2170.151,2175.344,The amendment would be invalid as an effective reordering of plan terms.

1994.93-1935,2,42910,thomas_m_kennedy,,2283.326,2293.543,"It would for this reason, Your Honor, and we recognize it sounds anomalous to suggest that a plan cannot be amended, but yet that could be accomplished, and I'll explain to you our reasoning, and what we believe was probably the Third Circuit reasoning."
1994.93-1935,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2339.042,2347.077,"Does that mean that any... say there are other provisions of the plan that did not satisfy ERISA completely, and no amending procedure, they could make amendments to cure other defects in the plan, I take it, then?"
1994.93-1935,2,42910,thomas_m_kennedy,,2347.077,2355.474,"Well, I think in our view the sensible procedure would be to first enact the amendment procedure and then accomplish the other goals through it."
1994.93-1935,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2355.474,2370.324,"But what if they didn't realize they... say this case hadn't been decided, but they realized they didn't have the proper funding provisions, or something like that, or their benefits didn't comply with certain things, could they make amendments to just bring the plan in conformity with the statute, even though there's no amendment procedure in the plan?"
1994.93-1935,2,42910,thomas_m_kennedy,,2370.324,2382.091,"Well, as the Solicitor General pointed out, Your Honor, other courts have enforced ERISA plans, though they be unwritten, and though they be without a funding procedure, the theory being, I think, twofold."
1994.93-1935,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2419.815,2420.677,May I just back up for one moment?
1994.93-1935,2,42910,thomas_m_kennedy,,2429.172,2430.442,"--Your Honor, I apologize."
1994.93-1935,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2430.983,2441.452,"--and I suppose that's the argument that a corporate acts... if this action was done in the routine way that corporate actions are taken, it should be okay."
1994.93-1935,2,42910,thomas_m_kennedy,,2462.212,2470.44,"--Your Honor, the... we understood it to be negative, and I apologize to the Court if I substituted a word which you regard as having other and pejorative consequences."
1994.93-1935,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2500.677,2518.95,"The district said it was invalid because there was no clause that provided for... you prevailed on your statutory argument, but as far as what the corporation did, I don't get anything from this page saying it was casual."
1994.93-1935,2,42910,thomas_m_kennedy,,2543.696,2544.618,"Yes, Your Honor."
1994.93-1935,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2544.618,2545.409,It was not done that way.
1994.93-1935,2,42910,thomas_m_kennedy,,2549.441,2555.554,"Your Honor, we were... my argument was based on the following sentence in the district court opinion, which is on page 38-A:"
1994.93-1935,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2588.857,2597.633,"Well, isn't... didn't the evidence show that the amendment was drafted by the corporate director of benefits and labor counsel and then approved by the executive vice president?"
1994.93-1935,2,42910,thomas_m_kennedy,,2597.633,2607.878,The record certainly shows that the amendment was drafted by the corporate labor counsel and the manager of benefits.
1994.93-1935,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2614.424,2615.966,"Well, did the district court make any finding?"
1994.93-1935,2,42910,thomas_m_kennedy,,2615.966,2617.716,"--No, he did not, Your Honor."
1994.93-1935,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2617.716,2618.237,He did not?
1994.93-1935,2,42910,thomas_m_kennedy,,2620.197,2620.707,No.
1994.93-1935,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2639.58,2648.006,"What harm has this caused you, unless it be the harm that the amendment was not effectively adopted by the corporation?"
1994.93-1935,2,42910,thomas_m_kennedy,,2666.577,2674.123,"--It was placed into the summary plan description, and I'd like to just draw a distinction between the plan and the summary plan description."
1994.93-1935,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2674.123,2674.644,Right.
1994.93-1935,2,42910,thomas_m_kennedy,,2674.644,2700.831,"The summary plan description in this case, at Joint Appendix 53 and Joint Appendix 55, provides that in the event of conflict between the plan and this document called the summary plan description, the plan itself will control, so that there is a question about whether inserting the language within the summary plan description actually was effective to accomplish anything, though in our view, our participants were harmed by the insertion of this language in the following manner."
1994.93-1935,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2700.831,2716.622,"You don't think that you would be up here arguing for your clients that if something had been inserted into that summary of the plan and in fact had not been adopted by the corporation, the corporation would nonetheless be bound to pony up that particular benefit?"
1994.93-1935,2,42910,thomas_m_kennedy,,2717.942,2723.355,"But Your Honor, on theories of detrimental reliance, and not on a theory that had accomplished an effective plan amendment--"
1994.93-1935,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2723.355,2723.886,"Well, but--"
1994.93-1935,2,42910,thomas_m_kennedy,,2723.886,2724.647,--which is a very important difference.
1994.93-1935,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2724.647,2729.758,"--Whatever the difference is, if that detrimental reliance works in one direction, why doesn't it work in the other?"
1994.93-1935,2,42910,thomas_m_kennedy,,2733.281,2734.981,"In our view, Your Honor--"
1994.93-1935,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2734.981,2737.415,"--Assuming it's been properly adopted, which is another question."
1994.93-1935,2,42910,thomas_m_kennedy,,2744.528,2753.013,"--If the plan were properly amended to set forth this term, then we would not be here, so it's difficult to speculate as to what harm there would be."
1994.93-1935,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2776.86,2778.84,What is the source of that right?
1994.93-1935,2,42910,thomas_m_kennedy,,2778.84,2784.195,"--In our view, the source of that right is the requirement that a specific procedure be inserted in the plan."
1994.93-1935,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2784.195,2795.732,"But a moment ago you agreed that, in fact, if the procedure had specified that the junior counsel in the corporation could amend the plan, that would be valid."
1994.93-1935,2,42910,thomas_m_kennedy,,2795.732,2804.158,"Even were that true, Justice Souter, the junior counsel would be, then, a fiduciary."
1994.93-1935,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2829.747,2831.029,"Mr. Kennedy, are you saying--"
1994.93-1935,2,42910,thomas_m_kennedy,,2831.029,2831.64,"A procedural one, yes--"
1994.93-1935,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2831.64,2859.486,"--Are you saying that every change, at least every change that doesn't favor the plan beneficiaries, that would ever be made in any plan that followed the IRS prototype on the amendment clause, that all of those changes would be no good, and so to know what the plan contained, you'd have to go back to the very first plan document, which would not be what the beneficiaries get routinely?"
1994.93-1935,2,42910,thomas_m_kennedy,,2867.511,2881.021,"--Your Honor, though I think we could accept a de minimis rule as a matter of judicial common sense, any substantive plan change made, to be effective has to comply with the stated procedure under section 402(b)(3)."
1994.93-1935,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2881.021,2886.964,Every change that is made that isn't favorable to the beneficiary is no good?
1994.93-1935,2,42910,thomas_m_kennedy,,2886.964,2889.796,"Under our interpretation of 402(b)(3), that is correct."
1994.93-1935,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2891.667,2901.804,"So how many... thinking of this plan, how many changes have been made since it was installed that didn't favor beneficiaries--"
1994.93-1935,2,42910,thomas_m_kennedy,,2901.804,2903.164,"--This plan, very few, Your Honor."
1994.93-1935,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2903.164,2903.966,--that would be no good?
1994.93-1935,2,42910,thomas_m_kennedy,,2903.966,2904.406,"This plan, very few."
1994.93-1935,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2910.169,2911.221,But this would not be the only one.
1994.93-1935,2,42910,thomas_m_kennedy,,2920.665,2927.841,"--There may be a burden on a plan sponsor from the ruling we advocate, but it is a burden placed on them by Congress."
1994.93-1935,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2927.841,2930.252,How about the beneficiary to know what the plan contains?
1994.93-1935,2,42910,thomas_m_kennedy,,2940.07,2942.871,"Your Honor, let me remind you of this."
1994.93-1935,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2973.051,2996.657,"But isn't the risk much larger that when you have an interpretation, even if not a Government agency that we would defer to has put out a plan to the public, that the likelihood is that many people have adopted plans with that provision in it, so we would have a whole... not only this company's plan, but a whole set of plans where the beneficiaries would have no idea at the moment of what their plan contained?"
1994.93-1935,2,42910,thomas_m_kennedy,,2996.657,3007.763,"--Your Honor, obviously there's a risk involved, but let me suggest to you that that risk, which was certainly remarked upon by the petitioner in their threat-of-litigation argument, is ameliorated by a number of factors."
1994.93-1935,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3053.823,3064.541,"At the moment, I'm thinking that your... they're arguing that, look, this just means you have to have a procedure and you have to know who's going to do it, and so the company says, yes, we have a procedure."
1994.93-1935,2,42910,thomas_m_kennedy,,3099.803,3100.763,"Yes, in our view--"
1994.93-1935,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3100.763,3101.324,What is it?
1994.93-1935,2,42910,thomas_m_kennedy,,3101.324,3101.895,"--there is, Your Honor."
1994.93-1935,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3142.05,3146.705,"Well, maybe they perhaps meant that it needn't necessarily be the administrator who can amend it."
1994.93-1935,2,42910,thomas_m_kennedy,,3157.942,3166.386,"Well, we coupled that, Your Honor, with the requirement set forth in ERISA that all plan documents be disclosed upon request to participants."
1994.93-1935,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3306.489,3310.31,Why is it you say that only the corporate board could adopt this?
1994.93-1935,2,42910,thomas_m_kennedy,,3310.31,3329.363,"--In our view, State... the purpose of State law should be only to identify the highest decisionmaking authority within the sponsoring entity, and that Federal law should determine as to whether that entity has appropriately made an effective amendment."
1994.93-1935,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3329.363,3330.535,Why should that be?
1994.93-1935,2,42910,thomas_m_kennedy,,3330.535,3338.76,"Because otherwise, Your Honor, you get into the realm of postamendment conduct as constituting the validation process, as Curtiss-Wright in fact has argued here."
1994.93-1935,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3351.149,3357.601,"But you're building a great deal on the requirement of a procedure, that State corporation law be totally superseded."
1994.93-1935,2,42910,thomas_m_kennedy,,3357.601,3366.907,"--Well, Your Honor, the definition of procedure, after all, in Black's Law Dictionary, is the mode of effectuating a legal right, as opposed to the legal right itself."
1994.93-1935,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3376.805,3382.928,"What if this plan had said, the company pursuant to New Jersey corporate law?"
1994.93-1935,2,42910,thomas_m_kennedy,,3382.928,3407.723,"Then, Your Honor, in our view, the question would be whether the amendment had been valid under New Jersey corporate law, but the fact that a plan sponsor can self-describe that form of legal test, which is what Congress intended, doesn't mean that in the case of a default under the statute, leaving out any type of procedure, this Court should extend to them the full range of corporate law in making that determination."
1994.93-1935,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3407.723,3425.716,"What if the board of directors of the corporation had adopted a resolution which says, amendments of all plans, contracts, and other documents to which this corporation is a party may be made by the least experienced, youngest lawyer in the general counsel's office?"

1994.93-1935,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3456.165,3456.485,Right.
1994.93-1935,2,42910,thomas_m_kennedy,,3456.485,3457.898,--in our view it would be within Judge Roth's--
1994.93-1935,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3457.898,3458.426,That's okay.
1994.93-1935,2,42910,thomas_m_kennedy,,3458.426,3458.977,--concurrence.
1994.93-1935,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3458.977,3459.458,Okay.
1994.93-1935,2,42910,thomas_m_kennedy,,3472.137,3474.058,In our view that--
1994.93-1935,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3474.058,3474.909,That would not suffice.
1994.93-1935,2,42910,thomas_m_kennedy,,3474.909,3484.724,"--In our view, that stretches the term ""procedure"" which Congress required be... to its breaking point, and reads it out of the statute to the point where all a plan sponsor need do is to state whether--"

1994.93-1935,2,42910,thomas_m_kennedy,,3485.095,3485.816,--failure--
1994.93-1935,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3485.816,3500.575,"--a lot of these amendments are a product of negotiation between the union and the company, and I presume a collective bargaining agreement doesn't have to be approved by the board of directors to be valid, but you'd say one incidental feature, we're going to raise the pensions from $90 a month to $92.50, that would have to be approved by the board of directors?"

1994.93-1935,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3514.834,3515.185,Right.
1994.93-1935,2,42910,thomas_m_kennedy,,3515.185,3519.308,Unions and companies don't negotiate the terms of single employer plans.
1994.93-1935,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3520.918,3521.929,"Well, they sometimes do."
