1997.96-1462,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,13.17,"We'll hear argument next in Number 96-1462, Christopher H. Lunding v. the New York Tax Appeals Tribunal."
1997.96-1462,0,19389,christopher_h_lunding,,13.17,70.856,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1997.96-1462,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,99.157,102.799,"What, 9,000 feet would be roughly, what, 2--"
1997.96-1462,0,19389,christopher_h_lunding,,102.799,106.231,"A little less than 2 miles over the State line, Your Honor, into Connecticut."
1997.96-1462,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,106.231,108.492,"--Well, but... okay."
1997.96-1462,0,19389,christopher_h_lunding,,108.893,109.372,Right.
1997.96-1462,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,113.294,114.997,"That doesn't make a difference, though."
1997.96-1462,0,19389,christopher_h_lunding,,114.997,115.726,"--No, it does not, Your Honor."
1997.96-1462,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,132.108,151.459,"Well, you don't argue, do you, or maybe you do, that in apportioning this income for people who work full or part-time in New York, that New York has to allow personal deductions of various kinds to out-of-State residents, do you?"
1997.96-1462,0,19389,christopher_h_lunding,,155.753,157.894,--Well--
1997.96-1462,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,157.894,160.125,Let's talk about that kind of deduction.
1997.96-1462,0,19389,christopher_h_lunding,,169.842,187.843,"--Well, the money is fungible, Justice O'Connor, and a substantial portion of my income and a much more substantial person... portion of other taxpayers' nonresident-in-New York income is earned in the State of New York."
1997.96-1462,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,258.57,274.13,"Couldn't you say, too, that you couldn't afford a very nice house in Connecticut which perhaps you have if you didn't make a good deal of money in New York, and therefore that New York ought to allow your property tax in Connecticut to be deducted?"
1997.96-1462,0,19389,christopher_h_lunding,,274.13,281.345,"--That may be true, but it wouldn't... but the property tax would not be determined based upon my New York income in part."
1997.96-1462,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,294.505,304.24,"Yes, but that would be true even... supposing your divorce took place while you were getting all your income in Connecticut, and then you later started to practice in New York and had the same alimony, would that make it a different case?"
1997.96-1462,0,19389,christopher_h_lunding,,304.24,306.682,"--Well, we--"
1997.96-1462,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,306.682,313.976,"You're relying on the fact that your alimony is partially determined by your New York income, but we'd have the same case before us if that were not the fact."
1997.96-1462,0,19389,christopher_h_lunding,,313.976,314.386,--Right.
1997.96-1462,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,331.156,336.041,"Well, I'm not sure that that's the way the State of New York would see it."
1997.96-1462,0,19389,christopher_h_lunding,,349.939,351.141,"Well, that--"
1997.96-1462,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,351.141,351.86,And--
1997.96-1462,0,19389,christopher_h_lunding,,351.86,352.461,--Right.
1997.96-1462,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,352.461,355.302,"--that seems to me very, very... a very different case."
1997.96-1462,0,19389,christopher_h_lunding,,355.302,357.814,"Well, they are discriminating--"
1997.96-1462,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,357.814,362.058,"Now, am I characterizing their position correctly, to begin with?"
1997.96-1462,0,19389,christopher_h_lunding,,362.058,362.809,"--Well, let me--"
1997.96-1462,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,362.809,363.818,Perhaps not.
1997.96-1462,0,19389,christopher_h_lunding,,363.818,369.461,--Let me go back and state the analysis here under the Privileges and Immunities Clause.
1997.96-1462,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,400.693,402.743,"Mr. Lunding, let me ask you about that."
1997.96-1462,0,19389,christopher_h_lunding,,402.743,403.024,Yes.
1997.96-1462,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,403.024,411.129,Because I had always thought of alimony as an income-splitting between the payor and the ex-spouse.
1997.96-1462,0,19389,christopher_h_lunding,,411.129,412.011,Correct.
1997.96-1462,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,412.011,446.693,"Now, I could see, if you were presenting us with a situation where what... New York lets you deduct the tax to your ex-spouse so that New York gets the tax on that amount of money that you earned in New York, but you would like to take the deduction while on the income side, if there is any income, it is to the exspouse, who is a Connecticut residence, so it seems to me you say, let me take the sweet and New York will be stuck with the bitter."
1997.96-1462,0,19389,christopher_h_lunding,,446.693,455.038,"Well, I would not agree with that conclusion, Your Honor, but I would point out this about the nature of alimony."
1997.96-1462,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,489.411,489.952,Yes.
1997.96-1462,0,19389,christopher_h_lunding,,489.952,490.551,Right.
1997.96-1462,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,490.551,494.815,"And in the Federal union that's fine, because the IRS is going to get it either way."
1997.96-1462,0,19389,christopher_h_lunding,,494.815,495.065,Right.
1997.96-1462,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,495.065,501.429,"The husband or the wife, it could be, deducts it, and the one who receives it pays income on it."
1997.96-1462,0,19389,christopher_h_lunding,,501.429,501.978,Right.
1997.96-1462,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,501.978,511.644,"But when you're in one State and you're dealing with nonresidents, in the generality of cases if you have a marital situation it's in the State of their residence."
1997.96-1462,0,19389,christopher_h_lunding,,511.644,512.105,Yes.
1997.96-1462,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,512.105,541.945,"So one State is going to get the income to tax, the other State is not going to get that tax, so there seems an imbalance there, and my only question is, why is it a violation of Privileges and Immunities to say that when New York doesn't get the chance to tax the one who's getting the money, getting the alimony, it shouldn't have to give a deduction to the one who's paying it?"
1997.96-1462,0,19389,christopher_h_lunding,,541.945,554.884,"Well, my point there was, if I had been a resident of New York there would have been an adjustment in which I would have been absolved entirely for the tax on the alimony amount, and it would have been transferred to my spouse."
1997.96-1462,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,612.571,615.674,"Now, I don't think we completed our--"
1997.96-1462,0,19389,christopher_h_lunding,,615.674,616.194,--Yes.
1997.96-1462,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,616.953,618.636,--brief colloquy on what you think the standard is.
1997.96-1462,0,19389,christopher_h_lunding,,618.636,619.447,Well--
1997.96-1462,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,619.447,625.841,Does New York have to treat residents precisely the same as nonresidents in every category of taxation?
1997.96-1462,0,19389,christopher_h_lunding,,625.841,638.838,"--Well, Austin v. New Hampshire teaches us that New York has to treat nonresidents under a rule of substantial equality of treatment, and--"
1997.96-1462,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,638.838,654.119,"Can that substantial equality of treatment be based on a theory that the income... pardon me, that the deduction or the adjustment must be related to the income that's earned in New York, and income-producing activities in New York?"
1997.96-1462,0,19389,christopher_h_lunding,,654.119,676.412,"--As regards personal expenses, the answer is no, because money being fungible, as a practical matter, looking at the actual, practical impact of the tax, which is the method of analysis, not labels, not anything else, but the actual practical impact, there is a discrimination here."
1997.96-1462,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,695.195,699.579,"Now, you don't earn all your income in New York, is that correct?"
1997.96-1462,0,19389,christopher_h_lunding,,699.579,701.76,"About half of it in my case, year-in, year-out."
1997.96-1462,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,702.531,711.415,"But a person who earns all income in New York but lives in Connecticut, strictly the bedroom community situation--"
1997.96-1462,0,19389,christopher_h_lunding,,711.415,712.886,"There are many such people, yes."
1997.96-1462,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,712.886,719.28,"--As to that person, there would be a very substantial difference, I suppose."
1997.96-1462,0,19389,christopher_h_lunding,,719.28,721.782,"Well, the State has--"
1997.96-1462,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,721.782,723.653,If alimony is not deductible.
1997.96-1462,0,19389,christopher_h_lunding,,723.653,741.444,"--Or... well, it would be... yes, that is correct, and the amount of course, would vary according to how much alimony, and in proportion to the total income, but in that scenario the amount which would be paid by the nonresident in New York tax would be greater than the amount that would be paid by a resident of New York."
1997.96-1462,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,748.48,752.093,May I ask you a question just for my own clarification?
1997.96-1462,0,19389,christopher_h_lunding,,752.093,752.663,Yes.
1997.96-1462,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,752.663,760.547,Is it correct that the rate that New York imposes on the nonresident is based in part on the nonresident's non-New York income?
1997.96-1462,0,19389,christopher_h_lunding,,760.547,761.659,That's correct.
1997.96-1462,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,768.194,773.937,"Do you... did you... you didn't challenge that feature of the tax in this case, did you?"
1997.96-1462,0,19389,christopher_h_lunding,,773.937,780.312,"No, I did not, and I... therefore I don't have the standing to... I have a view on it, but I don't think it's appropriate necessarily to state it at this time."
1997.96-1462,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,781.592,782.253,What is--
1997.96-1462,0,19389,christopher_h_lunding,,782.253,782.743,--Yes.
1997.96-1462,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,782.743,783.765,--What is the top rate?
1997.96-1462,0,19389,christopher_h_lunding,,783.765,788.157,"I don't really... 9 percent, I believe, currently."
1997.96-1462,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,826.192,828.933,But an income transfer that can be very beneficial.
1997.96-1462,0,19389,christopher_h_lunding,,828.933,856.862,"Well, the actual effect in any particular case will, of course, vary according to the personal circumstances, where the receiving ex-spouse lives and many other factors, but the effect of this statute in all cases compared to the situation if the statute were not there will be to discriminate against nonresident taxpayers who pay alimony, because this reduction in their income, taxable income, will obviously discriminate."
1997.96-1462,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,856.862,859.524,"Well, when you say discriminate, you mean treat differently, I take it."
1997.96-1462,0,19389,christopher_h_lunding,,859.524,874.534,"Treat differently than residents who pay alimony, yes, that's what I mean, and the amount in this case is [dollars] 3,724 for the year 1990 in my particular case, or a 15-percent increase in the tax in my case."
1997.96-1462,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,874.534,877.805,But you deduct if Connecticut has an income tax?
1997.96-1462,0,19389,christopher_h_lunding,,877.805,882.017,It did not have a tax on earned income in 1990 at all.
1997.96-1462,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,882.017,883.76,Which is the year in question.
1997.96-1462,0,19389,christopher_h_lunding,,883.76,884.11,Issue.
1997.96-1462,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,884.719,894.646,"But ordinarily, if a State has an income tax, the resident State, you could then deduct the New York tax from the Connecticut tax."
1997.96-1462,0,19389,christopher_h_lunding,,903.412,910.959,"Well, looking at the matter currently, the tax rate in Connecticut is 4-1/2 percent."
1997.96-1462,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,928.009,939.636,"And in figuring the level of discrimination, do we take account at all of the tax that's being paid on these funds by the Connecticut resident who's receiving them?"
1997.96-1462,0,19389,christopher_h_lunding,,939.636,958.937,"--No, and that is because in Austin v. New Hampshire this Court held that the constitutionality of one State statute that discriminates against nonresidents may not be... depend upon the present configuration of the statutes of another State, which is what we're talking about here as to the State of Connecticut."
1997.96-1462,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,967.162,977.35,Are there some deductions or credits that really are closely tied to the taxpayer's domestic life as opposed to his or her business life?
1997.96-1462,0,19389,christopher_h_lunding,,977.35,996.622,"Well, there are commentators... Professor Hellerstein in a 1974 article in the Michigan Law Review seems to suggest a possible test in the abstract that there would be some particular deductions which are particularly tied to the particular circumstances of the State of residence, without identifying what they are."
1997.96-1462,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,996.622,1007.75,"Isn't it true, Mr. Lunding, that the standards by which tax law classifications are judged are about the most generous known to the law?"
1997.96-1462,0,19389,christopher_h_lunding,,1007.75,1015.667,"No, I don't think that... well, the petitioners would not agree with that statement."
1997.96-1462,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1016.709,1019.658,"Well, several of our cases say that."
1997.96-1462,0,19389,christopher_h_lunding,,1026.031,1038.04,"--Well, the standard there... I'm thinking of Allied Stores v. Bowers, which is one of the places where the test you're describing I believe is set forth."
1997.96-1462,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1049.379,1050.068,Well--
1997.96-1462,0,19389,christopher_h_lunding,,1050.068,1051.77,--that assumes the conclusion which is--
1997.96-1462,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1051.77,1055.212,--There's a total latitude if it doesn't violate the Federal Constitution.
1997.96-1462,0,19389,christopher_h_lunding,,1055.212,1078.258,"--Well, that... and in any event, that is not the... yes, that's correct, but the issue in the privileges & immunities context, in light of Austin v. New Hampshire, the first thing is that there is a standard of review substantially more rigorous under the Privileges and Immunities Clause for State taxing decisions affecting individuals than affecting business organizations, trades, or professions."
1997.96-1462,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1100.373,1101.134,Mr. Lunding--
1997.96-1462,0,19389,christopher_h_lunding,,1101.134,1101.685,Yes.
1997.96-1462,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1101.685,1115.073,--I hate to think we're going to have to go through State deductions one by one in order... in case after case in order to decide which must be allowed to out-of-Staters and which need not be.
1997.96-1462,0,19389,christopher_h_lunding,,1119.327,1125.13,"Well, the only criterion that needs to be addressed... well, I guess I under... I'll answer the question in two parts."
1997.96-1462,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1133.475,1138.428,"If that's all we do, then we're going to have another case on the next item, and another case on the next item."
1997.96-1462,0,19389,christopher_h_lunding,,1139.509,1152.859,"--Well, the simple principle view... the simple principle view is that when you're talking about taxes which fall by their terms upon personal service income... and this is a personal income tax in New York."
1997.96-1462,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1177.544,1179.196,What are nonpersonal deductions?
1997.96-1462,0,19389,christopher_h_lunding,,1179.196,1192.925,"Business expenses, or running a donut shop in Connecticut, or something along those lines might be treated differently, and I'm thinking of Shaffer v. Carter, which appeared to do that."
1997.96-1462,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1203.231,1203.641,All right.
1997.96-1462,0,19389,christopher_h_lunding,,1203.641,1204.443,--question on that subject.
1997.96-1462,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1204.443,1205.594,What about life insurance--
1997.96-1462,0,19389,christopher_h_lunding,,1209.724,1211.126,Life insurance or home mortgage interest?
1997.96-1462,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1211.126,1211.527,--No.
1997.96-1462,0,19389,christopher_h_lunding,,1217.869,1237.063,"Well, responding to Justice Scalia, the bright line rule which will avoid what... the problem he foresees is to just say, if you tax personal income, you must give all personal deductions that the State gives to its own residents in the proportion that the income in that State bears to total income."
1997.96-1462,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1237.063,1237.744,So this--
1997.96-1462,0,19389,christopher_h_lunding,,1237.744,1247.939,"Therefore the answer would be, for solar panels or for anything else, if New York gives that personal deduction from personal income of its residents, it must do so in proportion for nonresidents which it taxes."
1997.96-1462,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1247.939,1253.192,"--Of course, when I asked you that question at the start, you said, oh, no, no, no, we're just talking about alimony here--"
1997.96-1462,0,19389,christopher_h_lunding,,1253.192,1253.753,Right.
1997.96-1462,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1253.753,1257.816,"--and there's a big difference, and that's all we're talking about, and we're not going to talk about personal deductions."
1997.96-1462,0,19389,christopher_h_lunding,,1257.816,1258.217,Well--
1997.96-1462,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1258.217,1259.357,Now we've got a whole different approach.
1997.96-1462,0,19389,christopher_h_lunding,,1259.357,1259.757,"--Well, no."
1997.96-1462,1,15577,andrew_d_bing,,1796.413,1802.006,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1997.96-1462,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1839.682,1862.548,"Would you address at the outset the one little flaw in that presentation, namely the rate is in part determined by non-New York income and therefore, whether directly or indirectly, you are to a certain extent taxing this gentleman at a higher rate than you would someone who had just the same amount of New York income, who lived in New York, that he has."
1997.96-1462,1,15577,andrew_d_bing,,1862.548,1874.665,"--Justice Stevens, it is correct that we tax... that the rate is set based upon the nonresident's worldwide income, but as Justice Scalia pointed out a moment ago we are not taxing the--"
1997.96-1462,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1874.665,1880.067,"But you really are in a way, if the bottom line, you get more money than you would if that weren't the fact."
1997.96-1462,1,15577,andrew_d_bing,,1884.072,1886.292,"--It affects the rate, Justice Stevens."
1997.96-1462,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1886.923,1890.886,"Well, it affects the rate, the... more money on the check he has to write to you."
1997.96-1462,1,15577,andrew_d_bing,,1890.886,1891.728,--The--
1997.96-1462,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1891.728,1893.468,Does it not?
1997.96-1462,1,15577,andrew_d_bing,,1893.468,1894.078,--It does.
1997.96-1462,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1894.078,1894.559,Yes.
1997.96-1462,1,15577,andrew_d_bing,,1904.977,1922.599,"During the... during 1990, the lowest marginal rate for married filing jointly and surviving spouse was 4 percent, and the highest rate at which I believe... the top marginal rate was 7.875 percent, which was the rate at which the additional deficiency was calculated in this case."
1997.96-1462,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1922.599,1934.947,"Now, let's consider the situation, which must occur with some frequency, of people who earn all their earned income in New York and live outside the city, outside the State."
1997.96-1462,1,15577,andrew_d_bing,,1934.947,1936.687,Those--
1997.96-1462,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1936.687,1949.446,And the end result is going to be the payment of a substantially higher tax than would be the case for a similarly situated New York resident who nevertheless lived in New York.
1997.96-1462,1,15577,andrew_d_bing,,1949.446,1965.845,"--It is true that in the case of the nonresident who derived all, or substantially all his or her income in New York, that the tax that the nonresident pays would be higher than the resident who derives all of his income in New York."
1997.96-1462,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1965.845,1970.781,What is the substantial reason that New York offers for the validity of such an arrangement?
1997.96-1462,1,15577,andrew_d_bing,,1970.781,2003.92,"This is the inevitable result of the fact that New York, with respect to nonresidents, is only looking at, and believes it is entitled to only look at their net income from the economic activity that they conduct within New York State, and that deductions, however large they may be in relationship to the total income, which have no relat... which are not incurred to produce or to generate that in-State income, are simply not something that New York is required to take into account."
1997.96-1462,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2003.92,2004.29,Why?
1997.96-1462,1,15577,andrew_d_bing,,2014.859,2015.74,But again--
1997.96-1462,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2015.74,2019.431,What justification is there for not allowing the same treatment to the out-of-Staters?
1997.96-1462,1,15577,andrew_d_bing,,2019.431,2044.127,"--In the context of the New York resident, again we are looking not only at the New York resident's New York income but the New York resident's worldwide income, and so the New York resident as a general matter is someone who will generally be subject to a burden of taxation which is greater than that of an individual in petitioner's situation."
1997.96-1462,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2047.661,2062.751,"You're saying if you're looking at all his income for purposes of taxes, you're entitled to give him all deductions of any sort, but these people, since they're out-of-Staters and you're not looking at all of their income, except as to the rate, and therefore you don't have to give them all of the deductions."
1997.96-1462,1,15577,andrew_d_bing,,2064.511,2066.583,"--That is correct, Justice Scalia."
1997.96-1462,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2088.536,2094.239,"But absolute equality of treatment, I found it awfully easy to construct bizarre examples."
1997.96-1462,1,15577,andrew_d_bing,,2223.507,2228.712,"Your mathematics are entirely correct, and your application of the formula are correct."
1997.96-1462,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2251.206,2253.089,"What was that portion, because that's been a little fuzzy to me."
1997.96-1462,1,15577,andrew_d_bing,,2260.493,2293.444,"--The taxpayer in Travis also specifically challenged a provision of the New York... then New York tax laws, section 360, subdivision 11, which permitted nonresidents the deductions available to residents only if and to the extent connected with New York income, and the taxpayer specifically challenged that provision in its brief in this Court arguing that it would, for example, disallow the Connecticut resident who worked in New York the deduction for his real property taxes while at the same time allowing the New York resident a deduction for the real property taxes on the New York residence."
1997.96-1462,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2293.444,2304.02,"Was it hypothetical, or was there something in the case, that this taxpayer said, I want a deduction for my real property tax or my life insurance premium and they're not giving it to me?"
1997.96-1462,1,15577,andrew_d_bing,,2304.02,2311.096,I believe that because of the posture of that case and because of who the taxpayer was that issue was hypothetical.
1997.96-1462,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2386.937,2406.459,"You say personal deductions, so I gather that you are making the distinction between expenses for the production of income and personal expenses, and you are not relying to any extent on the peculiarity of alimony, that it is a two-way thing, one gets a deduction, the other gets income."
1997.96-1462,1,15577,andrew_d_bing,,2406.459,2417.996,"We treat alimony... in our view alimony is properly treated as a personal expense deduction because it is not incurred to produce income within New York State, that New York State--"
1997.96-1462,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2417.996,2437.637,"Just like the sole, or whatever, so... but you're not... I would just like to be clear on getting a factor out of my head if it shouldn't be there, that is that the spouse who receives the alimony would be paying the State in which he resides income on it."
1997.96-1462,1,15577,andrew_d_bing,,2437.637,2442.693,--The residence of the recipient is not a factor in our analysis.
1997.96-1462,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2442.693,2452.498,"Well, if the former wife receiving the alimony lived in New York, would that spouse be taxed on the alimony income by New York?"
1997.96-1462,1,15577,andrew_d_bing,,2452.498,2455.099,"Yes, New York would tax the recipient."
