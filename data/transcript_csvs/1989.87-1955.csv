1989.87-1955,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.67,"We will hear argument next in Number 87-1955, Gerald Lewis versus Continental Bank Corporation."
1989.87-1955,0,17197,arthur_e_wilmarth_jr,,26.733,30.102,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.87-1955,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,163.17,189.053,"Mr. Wilmarth, suppose instead of filing an application for a particular bank, as they had done, the plaintiffs here had brought a, simply brought a declaratory judgment action prior to filing that application, it being clear that the application would be denied under the law in question, and asserted that the law in question was unconstitutional?"
1989.87-1955,0,17197,arthur_e_wilmarth_jr,,192.855,198.925,"I do not believe so, Justice Scalia, because there would have been both a standing problem, in my view, and perhaps a rightness problem."
1989.87-1955,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,221.338,225.492,"Under the amended federal act, what is left of this case?"
1989.87-1955,0,17197,arthur_e_wilmarth_jr,,225.492,234.182,"--The only thing that is left, Justice White, is whether or not Continental now actually intends to go forward and open an uninsured industrial savings bank."
1989.87-1955,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,248.322,254.893,Do you know if there are a lot of institutions that accept deposits that aren't insured?
1989.87-1955,0,17197,arthur_e_wilmarth_jr,,254.893,263.581,"--I think we have said in our opening brief that in our banking institutions today, less than one half of one percent of deposits are uninsured."
1989.87-1955,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,267.717,271.085,That may be one reason there hasn't been some unequivocal announcement.
1989.87-1955,0,17197,arthur_e_wilmarth_jr,,271.085,272.018,"--I think that is right, Your Honor."
1989.87-1955,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,291.163,292.498,But does that make the case moot really?
1989.87-1955,0,17197,arthur_e_wilmarth_jr,,292.498,300.152,"--I... Yes, it is our position that that makes the case moot, and that the decision of the court of appeals should be vacated and remanded on the grounds of mootness."
1989.87-1955,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,300.152,310.293,"Well, of course, in cases like that Granite Rock case from California, there was no absolute assurance that the mining interests were going to continue."
1989.87-1955,0,17197,arthur_e_wilmarth_jr,,320.332,325.2,"I would like to distinguish that, if I could, Justice O'Connor, because I thought your opinion in that case was very helpful."
1989.87-1955,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,355.503,371.181,"Well, I thought their statement was pretty much to the effect that they do intend to file for this uninsured permit or license, provided the economic circumstances justify it."
1989.87-1955,0,17197,arthur_e_wilmarth_jr,,371.181,372.915,"Yes, that is in fact the statement."
1989.87-1955,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,383.072,387.524,Is there anything that has prevented Continental from applying in the past?
1989.87-1955,0,17197,arthur_e_wilmarth_jr,,387.524,389.457,"Not to my knowledge, Your Honor."
1989.87-1955,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,486.77,496.543,"Well, do we, in determining whether there is a discriminatory effect, do we look at the statute independently of the Douglas Amendment, or in tandem with it?"
1989.87-1955,0,17197,arthur_e_wilmarth_jr,,496.543,505.915,"--What I would say the test might be, Justice O'Connor, is does this statute add any discrimination that does not already exist by virtue of the Douglas Amendment."
1989.87-1955,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,513.937,517.973,"Well, how do you get around that Lewis case against--"
1989.87-1955,0,17197,arthur_e_wilmarth_jr,,517.973,518.473,I think--
1989.87-1955,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,518.473,518.923,--BT--
1989.87-1955,0,17197,arthur_e_wilmarth_jr,,518.923,520.023,--BT Investment.
1989.87-1955,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,520.023,526.227,--Investment which held that plugging a loophole in the Douglas Amendment violated the Commerce Clause.
1989.87-1955,0,17197,arthur_e_wilmarth_jr,,526.227,528.179,I think that was a different case in this respect.
1989.87-1955,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,582.629,586.867,What did you do about your ISBs that were already in existence?
1989.87-1955,0,17197,arthur_e_wilmarth_jr,,586.867,589.569,"Uh, we grandfathered the three existing ISBs--"
1989.87-1955,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,589.569,592.771,"Doesn't, isn't that a, sort of a substantial consideration?"
1989.87-1955,0,17197,arthur_e_wilmarth_jr,,598.008,600.191,"--Not any longer, I would point out, Justice White."
1989.87-1955,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,610.916,614.685,What would you say if they hadn't been converted to some other type of institution?
1989.87-1955,0,17197,arthur_e_wilmarth_jr,,614.685,620.839,"Well, I would still take the same position that Clover Leaf Creamery said that a state legislature does not have to strike at all evils at once."
1989.87-1955,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,623.54,625.492,"Well, it wouldn't be striking at an evil, it would be--"
1989.87-1955,0,17197,arthur_e_wilmarth_jr,,625.492,628.21,"--Well, with respect--"
1989.87-1955,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,628.21,631.662,"--preserving a, preserving a local preference."
1989.87-1955,0,17197,arthur_e_wilmarth_jr,,631.662,647.588,"--With respect, I think, as far as Lewis was concerned, this was a very dangerous development, because this meant that Florida could no longer preserve a competitive and unconcentrated banking environment that would be responsive to the needs of its local consumers and businesses."
1989.87-1955,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,662.114,682.345,"But suppose the statute said in its preamble, in order to prevent states from outside the, banks from outside the southeast region, from establishing ISBs in the State of Florida, and to protect the existing competitive environment within the State of Florida, we hereby enact the following."
1989.87-1955,0,17197,arthur_e_wilmarth_jr,,685.13,696.187,"I think that is essentially, as I understand the policies that are clearly either stated or implicit on joint appendix 31, that Florida is saying we just passed a regional banking program last month."
1989.87-1955,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,717.601,719.568,"Well, answer my question."
1989.87-1955,0,17197,arthur_e_wilmarth_jr,,722.203,724.005,"--I, I believe so."
1989.87-1955,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,777.222,783.96,"But at the time they did not have the right to protect their regional banking scheme from, from ISBs."
1989.87-1955,0,17197,arthur_e_wilmarth_jr,,783.96,797.053,"Well, that, that of course was in 1984, and it is our view that the Commerce Clause did not prevent them from taking a non-discriminatory step toward withdrawing the option from everyone."
1989.87-1955,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,807.409,815.181,"Well, that, that may be a valid argument, but it seems to me it doesn't respond to Justice Kennedy's point, that the motivation was perfectly okay."
1989.87-1955,0,17197,arthur_e_wilmarth_jr,,815.181,816.764,--Well--
1989.87-1955,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,816.764,825.62,"You're, you're... because the motivation wasn't perfectly okay if they did not have a right to preserve their regional, their regional system, against a particular type of bank."
1989.87-1955,0,17197,arthur_e_wilmarth_jr,,825.62,833.059,"--Well, I think that the way I would respond to that, Justice Scalia, is that the Douglas Amendment did allow them to choose a regional approach."
1989.87-1955,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,833.059,840.313,"Yes, but didn't, but didn't allow them to insulate it against one type of bank, which may have been a mistake, but that was the federal law."
1989.87-1955,0,17197,arthur_e_wilmarth_jr,,840.313,841.082,"Well, our--"
1989.87-1955,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,841.082,845.384,And you are saying that their motivation was we want to insulate it even against this kind of bank.
1989.87-1955,0,17197,arthur_e_wilmarth_jr,,857.006,857.189,--I see.
1989.87-1955,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,900.785,906.253,"But the question is whether you are doing it even-handedly, when you grandfather in the existing local institutions."
1989.87-1955,0,17197,arthur_e_wilmarth_jr,,906.253,934.256,"Well, again I would say there that it seems to me in two cases, the Clover Leaf Creamery and the Dukes case, that you allowed very limited grandfathering, where you found that the limited, the grandfathering of the paperboard, the pulp, the pulp type of paperboard milk cartons in Minnesota, did not strike you as inherently discriminatory, or the preservation of the three push cart vendors in New Orleans did not strike you as, inherently as discriminatory."
1989.87-1955,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,934.256,935.739,"Well, that wasn't a Commerce Clause case."
1989.87-1955,0,17197,arthur_e_wilmarth_jr,,936.791,937.941,"Yes, Dukes was."
1989.87-1955,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1086.071,1091.307,"That is a good argument against the dormant Commerce Clause, but that argument has been made and lost."
1989.87-1955,0,17197,arthur_e_wilmarth_jr,,1112.155,1122.946,"--Justice Scalia, the way we approach the dormant Commerce Clause is that it does prohibit state discrimination against interstate commerce, but it does so as an allocation of power between the federal and state governments."
1989.87-1955,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1131.35,1134.754,But then I guess only the federal government can sue when a state violates it.
1989.87-1955,0,17197,arthur_e_wilmarth_jr,,1134.754,1136.604,"Well, no, we take the position--"
1989.87-1955,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1136.604,1137.337,But that's not the case.
1989.87-1955,0,17197,arthur_e_wilmarth_jr,,1141.324,1154.398,"--Yes, we acknowledge that Continental certainly has standing to complain of a violation of the Commerce Clause, so that this is a case arising under the federal Constitution within 1331, and they have standing as a party aggrieved."
1989.87-1955,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1155.281,1156.933,How can you have standing to assert a right that is not yours?
1989.87-1955,0,17197,arthur_e_wilmarth_jr,,1159.366,1171.924,"--Well, I think in, for example cases such as Clarke versus Securities Industry Association, you have said that an indirect beneficiary of a statute, for example, can assert a claim, even though they are not the direct beneficiary."
1989.87-1955,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1171.924,1172.157,"Well, that's right."
1989.87-1955,0,17197,arthur_e_wilmarth_jr,,1175.042,1183.814,"Well, again, we think that the notion of right as used in 1983 is a very, is a particular meaning of right."
1989.87-1955,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1273.705,1287.565,"Why would you say that 1983 doesn't authorize a suit for, by a private party, based on the Commerce Clause?"
1989.87-1955,0,17197,arthur_e_wilmarth_jr,,1287.565,1296.255,It is our view that first of all Continental would have to show that they have a constitutionally guaranteed right to engage in interstate commerce.
1989.87-1955,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1300.373,1302.224,"Well, why should it be able to bring any suit at all?"
1989.87-1955,0,17197,arthur_e_wilmarth_jr,,1304.657,1309.942,"They could bring a suit, they have standing to bring a suit under the federal question statute--"
1989.87-1955,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1309.942,1310.561,"Well, why?"
1989.87-1955,0,17197,arthur_e_wilmarth_jr,,1312.644,1313.894,"--Well, again, this would be--"
1989.87-1955,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1313.894,1314.827,Based on the Commerce Clause?
1989.87-1955,0,17197,arthur_e_wilmarth_jr,,1314.827,1315.144,--Right.
1989.87-1955,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1318.346,1325.618,"You mean they could, it wouldn't be subject automatically to dismissal for failure to state the cause of action?"
1989.87-1955,0,17197,arthur_e_wilmarth_jr,,1325.618,1326.418,--No.
1989.87-1955,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1340.977,1346.865,"You mean you can bring, you can bring a federal, you can say the federal cause of action directly under the Commerce Clause?"
1989.87-1955,0,17197,arthur_e_wilmarth_jr,,1346.865,1347.681,--Yes.
1989.87-1955,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1347.681,1350.333,But you cannot state one under a 1983.
1989.87-1955,0,17197,arthur_e_wilmarth_jr,,1350.333,1351.102,That is our position.
1989.87-1955,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1351.102,1355.554,That is... and why not under a 1983?
1989.87-1955,0,17197,arthur_e_wilmarth_jr,,1355.554,1360.791,"Because, to find the 1983 you must find that this is, they are vindicating their rights secured by the Constitution--"
1989.87-1955,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1360.791,1372.849,"Oh I know, but you say that, if you just allege, if you just proceed under 1331, you can sustain, you can not be subject to automatic dismissal."
1989.87-1955,0,17197,arthur_e_wilmarth_jr,,1372.849,1373.649,--Yes.
1989.87-1955,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1374.884,1375.634,Because you have got a right.
1989.87-1955,0,17197,arthur_e_wilmarth_jr,,1375.634,1377.05,"--Well, that you--"
1989.87-1955,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1377.05,1378.586,A guaranteed constitutional right.
1989.87-1955,0,17197,arthur_e_wilmarth_jr,,1378.586,1380.871,"--No, I don't believe that is the case."
1989.87-1955,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1392.929,1394.379,And that the plaintiff has been hurt.
1989.87-1955,0,17197,arthur_e_wilmarth_jr,,1394.379,1395.129,--Yes.
1989.87-1955,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1397.331,1399.781,"The plaintiff has been hurt, and he has a right not to be hurt."
1989.87-1955,0,17197,arthur_e_wilmarth_jr,,1399.781,1403.235,"Well, that he has a right... I am sorry."
1989.87-1955,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1404.585,1409.222,"And an entitlement to, in that suit, to damages, I suppose."
1989.87-1955,0,17197,arthur_e_wilmarth_jr,,1411.505,1415.375,--Under Ex parte Young he only has prospective injunctive relief against the state.
1989.87-1955,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1449.78,1451.613,It doesn't refer to statutes specifically either.
1989.87-1955,0,17197,arthur_e_wilmarth_jr,,1451.613,1455.065,"--That was added later, you are right, Justice White."
1989.87-1955,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1455.065,1457.017,"It was not added in the statute, it was--"
1989.87-1955,0,17197,arthur_e_wilmarth_jr,,1461.588,1466.39,"But, Representative Shellabarger said there are two types of constitutional provisions."
1989.87-1955,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1513.27,1515.138,"Thank you, Mr. Wilmarth."
1989.87-1955,1,16110,andrew_l_gordon,,1528.196,1530.398,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.87-1955,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1558.298,1568.154,"Well, you agree that the application that you now have on file is not very consistent with the federal law?"
1989.87-1955,1,16110,andrew_l_gordon,,1568.154,1571.689,What we agree is that--
1989.87-1955,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1571.689,1572.122,That particular application--
1989.87-1955,1,16110,andrew_l_gordon,,1572.122,1573.272,--The application speaks for itself.
1989.87-1955,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1573.272,1577.26,--Florida does not have to grant that application under the present federal law.
1989.87-1955,1,16110,andrew_l_gordon,,1577.26,1579.61,"Well, if we are going to be--"
1989.87-1955,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1579.61,1579.876,Is that right or not?
1989.87-1955,1,16110,andrew_l_gordon,,1579.876,1580.545,--If we are going to be technical--
1989.87-1955,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1580.545,1581.012,Is that right or not?
1989.87-1955,1,16110,andrew_l_gordon,,1581.012,1582.112,--I would disagree with that.
1989.87-1955,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1608.029,1620.353,"So you say, you say that your application really amounts to an application to, for an uninsured, to establish a bank that would receive uninsured deposits."
1989.87-1955,1,16110,andrew_l_gordon,,1620.353,1627.943,"--What I think is really going on here is that this is an application that was filed nine years ago, and circumstances have changed."
1989.87-1955,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1691.766,1693.968,"Mr. Gordon, the issue isn't whether you can."
1989.87-1955,1,16110,andrew_l_gordon,,1704.693,1705.143,That's--
1989.87-1955,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1705.143,1714.132,And all you have brought before us is an application that on its face indicates an intent to establish a bank with the insurance.
1989.87-1955,1,16110,andrew_l_gordon,,1723.987,1731.093,"--Justice, that is the second part of what I am wanting to address in terms of the fact that we have not filed another application."
1989.87-1955,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1783.376,1788.43,"You mean the case in the sense of strictly economic considerations, that a business would take into consideration."
1989.87-1955,1,16110,andrew_l_gordon,,1788.43,1789.28,--That is correct.
1989.87-1955,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1796.369,1799.655,Why haven't you filed an amendment to your application?
1989.87-1955,1,16110,andrew_l_gordon,,1799.655,1805.824,"Under Florida law, what is required in an application is a whole series of different items."
1989.87-1955,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1844.266,1845.233,I don't understand.
1989.87-1955,1,16110,andrew_l_gordon,,1848.401,1850.337,That was all done in the current application.
1989.87-1955,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1850.337,1853.872,So why can't you just amend that provision and use the same locations and the same facilities?
1989.87-1955,1,16110,andrew_l_gordon,,1854.322,1857.074,"Well, it's just nine years later, and there are changes."
1989.87-1955,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1900.686,1903.972,"--Yes, but... but, Mr. Gordon, there is another thing that normally is done in litigation."
1989.87-1955,1,16110,andrew_l_gordon,,1911.809,1914.575,--We would be happy to submit an affidavit.
1989.87-1955,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1914.575,1915.694,"Well, I am not asking you what you are be happy to do."
1989.87-1955,1,16110,andrew_l_gordon,,1917.677,1917.846,"No, no, Sir."
1989.87-1955,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1917.846,1922.064,"--in any way, saying that you intend to go forward with the modified application."
1989.87-1955,1,16110,andrew_l_gordon,,1927.368,1934.272,"Justice, the litigation here was not directed at the contents of the application."
1989.87-1955,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1964.191,1976.449,"Well, I suppose that if the state had just, when the federal law was amended, if the state had just dismissed your application, the case would be moot unless you filed an amendment."
1989.87-1955,1,16110,andrew_l_gordon,,1976.449,1981.002,--Or we in some other way demonstrated our intention to go forward.
1989.87-1955,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2020.212,2022.846,There have been questions on this for a long time.
1989.87-1955,1,16110,andrew_l_gordon,,2053.533,2055.133,"Justice Scalia, this issue--"
1989.87-1955,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2055.133,2055.999,And that is no longer possible.
1989.87-1955,1,16110,andrew_l_gordon,,2055.999,2065.341,"--This issue arose in the court of appeals after complete briefing and argument, I guess about a week before the court of appeals decision."
1989.87-1955,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2065.341,2069.459,And you won on that issue.
1989.87-1955,1,16110,andrew_l_gordon,,2069.459,2072.078,"And we prevailed both, we prevailed both--"
1989.87-1955,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2072.078,2073.328,Initially it was not moot.
1989.87-1955,1,16110,andrew_l_gordon,,2073.328,2074.594,--Correct.
1989.87-1955,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2074.594,2075.344,The court of appeals said it was not moot.
1989.87-1955,1,16110,andrew_l_gordon,,2075.344,2075.81,Correct.
1989.87-1955,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2075.81,2077.16,Because they accepted your--
1989.87-1955,1,16110,andrew_l_gordon,,2077.16,2079.462,"Essentially, yes, Sir."
1989.87-1955,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2131.597,2139.952,"--Mr. Wilmarth, just so I am clear about it, is your representation to this Court that Continental currently proposes to open a bank?"
1989.87-1955,1,16110,andrew_l_gordon,,2139.952,2140.719,"Yes, Sir."
1989.87-1955,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2140.719,2142.654,That that is its current intention.
1989.87-1955,1,16110,andrew_l_gordon,,2142.654,2143.121,"Yes, Sir."
1989.87-1955,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2143.121,2148.575,But simply that that intention may change in the future because of economic--
1989.87-1955,1,16110,andrew_l_gordon,,2148.575,2149.458,For reasons that are unknown at this time.
1989.87-1955,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2149.458,2150.192,--Okay.
1989.87-1955,1,16110,andrew_l_gordon,,2153.594,2154.296,"Yes, Sir."
1989.87-1955,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2154.296,2157.212,With an uninsured ISB.
1989.87-1955,1,16110,andrew_l_gordon,,2157.212,2157.481,"Yes, Sir."
1989.87-1955,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2187.081,2203.591,"Well, if we were satisfied that without such insurance that it would be absurd, as a practical matter, to even consider opening it, do we take that into account in determining whether this case is moot?"
1989.87-1955,1,16110,andrew_l_gordon,,2203.591,2210.946,"Justice, the additional point I think that I would like to note here is that there is an application procedure."
1989.87-1955,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2265.298,2270.152,"Discriminatory intent, which has no adverse impact?"
1989.87-1955,1,16110,andrew_l_gordon,,2270.152,2274.104,--The Court's decisions can be read to say that.
1989.87-1955,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2466.662,2473.216,"Mr. Gordon, you say that the statute, the Florida statute in 1984 grandfathered existing Florida ISBs."
1989.87-1955,1,16110,andrew_l_gordon,,2477.536,2478.636,No.
1989.87-1955,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2480.155,2482.172,So they grandfathered all the ISBs that were.
1989.87-1955,1,16110,andrew_l_gordon,,2482.172,2488.326,"There were a number of applications pending, and those applications by out-of-state bank holding companies effectively were cut off."
1989.87-1955,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2488.326,2499.217,"Yes, but when you are talking about grandfathering, your argument could be read to suggest that they grandfathered the Florida ISBs, but that there were others similarly situated that weren't."
1989.87-1955,1,16110,andrew_l_gordon,,2499.217,2499.65,No--
1989.87-1955,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2499.65,2502.986,"But, there were only Florida ISBs, and they were grandfathered."
1989.87-1955,1,16110,andrew_l_gordon,,2504.27,2504.603,"--Yes, Sir."
1989.87-1955,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2506.186,2507.305,And they're no longer in existence either.
1989.87-1955,1,16110,andrew_l_gordon,,2507.305,2511.507,The department has offered them bank charters and they apparently have all accepted.
1989.87-1955,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2548.28,2563.309,"Well, in that respect, do you challenge the constitutional validity of 658.74 and 664.07, which say that only a bank or an ISB may provide these banking services?"
1989.87-1955,1,16110,andrew_l_gordon,,2569.026,2570.645,"No, Sir."
1989.87-1955,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2602.684,2619.126,"Well, but... but given the Florida scheme, wouldn't it make just as much sense for you to be attacking as unconstitutional because of a violation of the Commerce Clause, the Florida provisions which say that only a bank can engage in certain kinds of services?"
1989.87-1955,1,16110,andrew_l_gordon,,2623.68,2632.369,"It... there is probably no shortage of Florida statutes that are unconstitutional, or that could be attacked from the constitutional basis."
1989.87-1955,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2651.866,2661.638,"Well, I take it that Florida could permit these banking services to be rendered by non-bank institutions if it chose, quite without regard to the federal legislation."
1989.87-1955,1,16110,andrew_l_gordon,,2663.272,2668.726,Florida certainly would have freedom to have financial services delivered in any number of ways.
1989.87-1955,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2668.726,2677.982,"Well, why isn't that the unconstitutional statute here, rather than the statute which concerns chartering of ISBs?"
1989.87-1955,1,16110,andrew_l_gordon,,2677.982,2683.052,"Well, I am not sure I understand your question, Justice."
1989.87-1955,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2683.052,2685.671,"Well, you want to engage in banking services."
1989.87-1955,1,16110,andrew_l_gordon,,2691.657,2699.68,"Well, but Congress has drawn a line, and we... you know, Congress's power over interstate commerce is plenary, and it has drawn the line as to Section 3(d) banks."
1989.87-1955,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2702.463,2703.582,But it isn't Congress.
1989.87-1955,1,16110,andrew_l_gordon,,2720.426,2743.355,"--Justice, I suppose that we could have a argument in a particular factual context, which I don't know that we have here, where a statute of that sort might be unconstitutional, if it had the purpose and effect of discriminating against interstate commerce."
1989.87-1955,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2808.782,2816.904,"Well, Mr. Gordon, could Florida just say, have said, as an initial proposition, we are not going to have ISBs in Florida."
1989.87-1955,1,16110,andrew_l_gordon,,2817.471,2818.923,Before all this came up?
1989.87-1955,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2818.923,2819.74,Sure.
1989.87-1955,1,16110,andrew_l_gordon,,2819.74,2820.456,Certainly.
1989.87-1955,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2820.456,2823.375,"Well, in effect that is what they are saying now."
1989.87-1955,1,16110,andrew_l_gordon,,2823.375,2824.993,"Well, the distinction--"
1989.87-1955,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2824.993,2830.147,"How can, how do you have a right to compel them to charter a certain kind of corporation?"
1989.87-1955,1,16110,andrew_l_gordon,,2830.147,2834.199,--There are a number of responses.
1989.87-1955,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2872.557,2884.365,"You are saying, in effect, that a discriminatory motive will invalidate an enactment which, so far as impact is concerned, is perfectly permissible under the Commerce Clause?"
1989.87-1955,1,16110,andrew_l_gordon,,2884.365,2885.065,"Well, this Court--"
1989.87-1955,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2885.065,2887.484,"I know, I mean what is your position?"
1989.87-1955,1,16110,andrew_l_gordon,,2890.186,2898.207,--The normal presumption is that statutes will have the effects intended by the legislature.
1989.87-1955,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2918.419,2928.311,"What is... what do you think is your best case from this Court that says discriminatory intent alone, without any consideration of impact, violates the Commerce Clause?"
1989.87-1955,1,16110,andrew_l_gordon,,2928.311,2934.814,"--Well, Bacchus and Minnesota versus Clover Leaf Creamery."
1989.87-1955,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2940.032,2940.332,Not quite.
1989.87-1955,1,16110,andrew_l_gordon,,2940.332,2940.866,What?
1989.87-1955,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2940.866,2941.699,Not quite.
1989.87-1955,1,16110,andrew_l_gordon,,2941.699,2947.02,There is at least language in both decisions that lend themselves to that.
1989.87-1955,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2961.279,2964.147,"We probe the heart of the states, that is what this is really about."
1989.87-1955,1,16110,andrew_l_gordon,,2964.147,2967.783,"Well, the state has announced--"
1989.87-1955,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2967.783,2971.051,"Evil states, we punish them, whether they do harm or not."
1989.87-1955,1,16110,andrew_l_gordon,,2973.587,2974.539,--Well--
1989.87-1955,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2974.539,2976.722,That doesn't seem... I never knew we did that.
1989.87-1955,1,16110,andrew_l_gordon,,2976.722,2984.728,"--It turns on whether, you know, we assume that legislatures are competent, and that legislation will have the effects that they desire."
1989.87-1955,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3031.809,3037.03,Did you cite alternate bases for the award of attorneys fees on your request to the court of appeals?
1989.87-1955,1,16110,andrew_l_gordon,,3037.03,3037.562,"Yes, Sir."
1989.87-1955,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3122.801,3124.935,I have just one for you.
1989.87-1955,1,16110,andrew_l_gordon,,3139.061,3139.811,"No, Sir."
1989.87-1955,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3142.613,3153.135,"The bank has considered its inability to get insurance by reason of the new legislation, and nonetheless has made the determination to proceed with this application."
1989.87-1955,1,16110,andrew_l_gordon,,3153.135,3153.285,Right.
1989.87-1955,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3169.08,3171.532,"Thank you, Mr. Gordon."
1989.87-1955,2,17197,arthur_e_wilmarth_jr,,3173.915,3176.0,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1989.87-1955,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3362.454,3364.072,"Thank you, Mr. Wilmarth."
