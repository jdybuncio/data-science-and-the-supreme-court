1975.74-848,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,2.385,Take a brief recess.
1975.74-848,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,66.517,68.393,Mr. Chief Justice may it please the Court.
1975.74-848,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,258.773,261.533,"Well, it is true in Flower too, was it not?"
1975.74-848,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,261.533,263.384,It is true in Flower also.
1975.74-848,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,294.989,304.144,"But if I recall correctly Flowers put emphasis on the fact that this was a public street, in fact going through that Base rather than the part of the Base."
1975.74-848,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,304.144,304.407,That is true.
1975.74-848,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,309.633,318.259,It barely meant that the Base there was divided into two parts by a public highway that went through some major portion.
1975.74-848,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,318.259,326.867,"That is true and I think the Court said that their the Military had abandoned control of that street, I think definitely in Fort Dix that is not true."
1975.74-848,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,326.867,333.19,But civilians can certainly come on the Fort Dix without being stopped at a guard gate or anything like that.
1975.74-848,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,333.19,333.659,They can.
1975.74-848,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,337.954,343.425,"Well, but did not he retained that power and in Fort Sam, Houston in Flower too?"
1975.74-848,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,343.425,361.523,"Mr. Justice Rehnquist, if I thought that Flower had announced that they -- if they -- principle so broad as to say that if the Commander let civilians on the Base then he must let them on Base for all purposes."
1975.74-848,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,415.097,430.319,"Well, can you not argue just the opposite though that since the shopping center is in many respects private, it may be able to limit an invitation in a way that the government which is not private in any respect can?"
1975.74-848,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,430.319,436.888,"If Your Honor, you are referring to the state action difference, I think there may be that difference."
1975.74-848,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,550.961,565.735,"What about a – say a charter against a city or some initiative or referendum matter, a speech in support or an opposition to --"
1975.74-848,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,565.735,568.726,"You mean as opposed to a candidate, an issue speech?"
1975.74-848,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,586.927,595.785,But I think you are positing -- but you are justifying the Regulation on the grounds that particular kinds of speech just do not fit in the Military?
1975.74-848,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,595.785,617.134,"Yes, yes I am and I would have thought that that was clear from the tradition of this country in that the law was clear to that effect and indeed it seems to me there are only really two arguments advanced by the Court of Appeals and by the respondents against it."
1975.74-848,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,617.134,623.416,"But you would I suppose, that you -- but you are saying the Regulation forbids all political speech, which is not sovereign?"
1975.74-848,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,623.416,624.437,That is true.
1975.74-848,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,624.437,629.958,And you would not be here I suppose if it just to prohibit at some kinds of political speech?
1975.74-848,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,629.958,643.596,"If it were discriminatory you mean Mr. Justice White I should have, no I would not be here. This is a non-discriminatory Regulation designed for very good purposes."
1975.74-848,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,643.596,647.498,You would love that case be argued by the General Counsel of the Army?
1975.74-848,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,647.498,661.637,"I would author -- I might at the outside authorize the filing of a brief Mr. Justice Rehnquist, but the Court of Appeals' argument rest upon two prepositions both of which I think that it demonstrably falls."
1975.74-848,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,690.844,703.976,"Well, would not you concede that if he does in certain areas of the Base allow access to the public, he has to allow access to every member, the public who is not misbehaving or showing something?"
1975.74-848,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,703.976,705.699,I think he has to allow access to every --
1975.74-848,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,705.699,708.325,He has to allow access to Doctor Spock?
1975.74-848,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,708.325,712.654,Allow access to Doctor -- Doctor Spock has complete access to the Base at any Base Mr. Justice Stewart.
1975.74-848,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,714.945,718.192,"Yes, that is the way he is put it was not I believe (Voice Overlap)"
1975.74-848,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,718.192,720.554,Access for all purposes perhaps should be there.
1975.74-848,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,724.596,726.812,That is a different purpose?
1975.74-848,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,726.812,751.99,"Now, that proposition I think if it were true it would force every Commander to choose between sealing his Base tight or allowing it to become Hyde park, a forum for political discussion and indeed if that proposition were true, I take at this Court would face much the same choice because this Court has limited access, political banners and campaign speeches may not be made in this building or on this premises, although access is allowed to the public."
1975.74-848,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,910.698,914.423,"Lest to have a problem, a little problem which is one point."
1975.74-848,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,917.895,918.721,That is true.
1975.74-848,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,920.358,926.068,"If they were mailed there is no restriction against that, if they were mailed it each soldier on the Base?"
1975.74-848,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,926.068,928.587,There is no restriction on the sense that the mail is not covered.
1975.74-848,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,928.587,929.484,Right?
1975.74-848,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,929.484,930.13,But I think Mr. Justice Marshall --
1975.74-848,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,930.13,932.981,But he cannot -- but you can hand them out.
1975.74-848,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,933.216,937.849,"Well, you can hand them out if you get prior approval and prior approval the Regulation says will be granted."
1975.74-848,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,937.849,940.658,But you do not get prior approval of the mailing?
1975.74-848,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,940.658,951.31,"Well no, but it seems to me not a good objection to this policy to say that the Military has not expanded the policy to cover censorship of the mails."
1975.74-848,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,961.617,963.897,"If they do, I imagine that would be litigated in it too?"
1975.74-848,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,963.897,966.144,I imagine it might be Mr. Justice Marshall.
1975.74-848,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,978.827,986.946,Do you think that the Base forbids soldier stationed there from attending political meetings off the Base?
1975.74-848,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,986.946,988.441,"No, they do not Mr. Justice White."
1975.74-848,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,988.441,989.836,And well could they?
1975.74-848,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,989.836,990.16,Could they?
1975.74-848,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1005.804,1014.642,"So, is not the – is not the – it is the way -- their worry is how the Military would look to the public rather than any danger to the soldier?"
1975.74-848,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1014.642,1019.61,"No, I think it is -- I think not -- I think the American soldier."
1975.74-848,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1019.61,1023.986,"Well, they do not let him go off to the Base and attend any political meeting he wants to attend?"
1975.74-848,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1023.986,1029.565,That is quite true Mr. Justice White and this is not an attempt to prevent him from hearing any ideas.
1975.74-848,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1029.565,1033.718,And they listen the the radio all he wants to and read all the magazines and --
1975.74-848,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1033.718,1042.584,"I might say that the fact that the Military allows all of these things and it is so wide open, it seems to me not an argument against that narrow --"
1975.74-848,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1042.584,1045.307,What is then -- what is the reason then for the Regulation.
1975.74-848,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1045.307,1053.944,"Well, I think it is simply this; it is always been understood that there is this separation between the Military and the political process."
1975.74-848,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1092.696,1109.033,"But they said while they are sitting there on the Base and they are free to listen to political speeches on the radio or on television and sit around in their uniforms and read the magazines, read speeches?"
1975.74-848,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1109.033,1110.028,That is true.
1975.74-848,1,21095,david_kairys,,1627.1,1630.649,Mr. Chief Justice Burger may it please the Court.
1975.74-848,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1701.776,1709.217,"You mean, it is because it looks like a company town of an older case, it is a company town?"
1975.74-848,1,21095,david_kairys,,1709.217,1720.117,"No, I am saying that the Base is -- the road goes right through the city and right through the Base exactly as in Flower and it seems to me that it is indistinguishable from a city street."
1975.74-848,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1720.117,1730.4,"Well, it would not satisfy you though if your client were permitted to make a speech out in the streets subject to all traffic hazards of the whole town?"
1975.74-848,1,21095,david_kairys,,1730.4,1730.49,No.
1975.74-848,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1733.547,1742.494,"On E2 Mr. Kairys, which side is the Base well in -- which side is this Wrightstown?"
1975.74-848,1,21095,david_kairys,,1742.494,1767.894,"The photographer is on the Base and the Wrightstown is in beyond -- do you see the railroad crossing, the crossed white fence at the top of a post where the railroad comes, right next to that there is two small mounds, this is in the testimony regarding this picture, there is two small mounds on either side of the street that indicate that you are entering the Base."
1975.74-848,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1767.894,1772.691,So the near left side is the Base?
1975.74-848,1,21095,david_kairys,,1772.691,1786.959,"The home, the street where that railroad crossing is, beyond that railroad crossing is Wrightstown, New Jersey in the background of the picture towards the photographer closer to the picture is the Base from then and then --"
1975.74-848,2,38778,robert_h_bork,,3545.492,3547.087,Mr. Chief Justice Burger may I please the Court.
1975.74-848,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3704.732,3722.934,"Mr. Solicitor General, what difference would it make if the topography and the color of the highway pavement and the quality of the sidewalks and the kinds of houses were exactly the same before you got on the Base and after you have got there?"
1975.74-848,2,38778,robert_h_bork,,3727.745,3740.317,I do not think it will make any difference Mr. Chief Justice because all of the policy reasons would apply and that is why I do not believe in this expanded reading regarding of the Flower case because if that is what Flower really meant then it really is a trivial point.
1975.74-848,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3765.752,3781.451,"Indeed some Bases do have a sentry box there and they have a fence around them, but I take it from the arguments made that the same arguments would be advanced if there was a ten foot wall and two sentries at the gate?"
1975.74-848,2,38778,robert_h_bork,,3781.451,3812.229,"I take it so, because if the point is that the Base Commander much used his troops to compensate Doctor Spock or other minor party candidates whose inability to get a good a news rating then I think it would not matter whether there is a wall or whether the Base is open and I would point once more to Lloyd Corporation against Tanner and indeed the Grayned against the City of Rockford which said that even a public sidewalk could be denied for use for some purposes because of the interest in running schools."
1975.74-848,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3826.785,3827.472,Thank you gentlemen.
