1958.583,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,20.188,"Number 583, Henry Napue, Petitioner, versus People of the State of Illinois."
1958.583,0,25682,george_n_leighton,,23.067,27.913,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1958.583,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,332.162,334.749,"I don't quite follow on you there, Mr. Leighton."
1958.583,0,25682,george_n_leighton,,340.57,352.783,"Well, if I understand the Supreme Court of Illinois correctly, Your Honor, in the opinion, the Supreme Court said that the perjury was revealed to the jury."
1958.583,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,358.989,365.714,"Well, the -- when the -- when the witness -- when Hamer first testified, he said nobody promised him anything."
1958.583,0,25682,george_n_leighton,,366.987,367.342,That's right.
1958.583,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,367.342,368.481,-- paraphrasing it from my memory.
1958.583,0,25682,george_n_leighton,,368.481,368.513,That's right.
1958.583,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,368.513,377.432,"And then -- and then on cross-examination, he said, “Well, as a matter of fact, somebody from the public defender's office did say he'd use his best efforts on my behalf.”"
1958.583,0,25682,george_n_leighton,,377.432,378.573,"That's right, Your Honor."
1958.583,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,378.573,390.367,"And then on redirect examination, he told the -- Mr. Myers, the prosecuting attorney, that Mr. Myers hadn't promised him anything at all and that was --"
1958.583,0,25682,george_n_leighton,,390.367,390.469,That's right.
1958.583,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,390.469,393.0,-- that -- that's about the way the record shows.
1958.583,0,25682,george_n_leighton,,393.0,394.55,That's what the record shows.
1958.583,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,394.55,404.92,"And so, the fact is that in -- that in answer to the last question on redirect examination, that was perjury and the -- and the perjury was not revealed to the jury, wasn't it?"
1958.583,0,25682,george_n_leighton,,404.92,406.085,That's right.
1958.583,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,406.665,407.558,That's the reason I didn't quite understand --
1958.583,0,25682,george_n_leighton,,407.558,409.234,Yes.
1958.583,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,409.234,411.8,-- I didn't follow your statement about revealed perjury.
1958.583,0,25682,george_n_leighton,,411.8,426.826,"Well, the Supreme Court's opinion, which appears on page 72 of the record, which, I think, is an erroneous construct of the record, if I may say so, Your Honor, those on the theory that the perjury which had been committed was revealed to the jury."
1958.583,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,543.666,547.198,Was any action they have taken against the District Attorney?
1958.583,0,25682,george_n_leighton,,547.198,548.268,"No, Your Honor."
1958.583,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,548.268,548.777,None with it?
1958.583,0,25682,george_n_leighton,,548.777,549.039,No.
1958.583,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,582.939,591.736,"Well, if he was -- if -- if he was stating the fact in his affidavit, wasn't he guilty of subornation of perjury?"
1958.583,0,25682,george_n_leighton,,591.736,592.652,It would appear so.
1958.583,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,599.313,600.298,Yes.
1958.583,0,25682,george_n_leighton,,600.298,613.526,"-- because Mr. Myers' testimony creates the impression that when Hamer was arrested, Hamer said that he didn't know anything about this robbery that allegedly occurred in 1938."
1958.583,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,634.518,636.575,"Well, just a matter of interest."
1958.583,0,25682,george_n_leighton,,646.647,647.477,"Yes, it was."
1958.583,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,654.368,654.643,Yes.
1958.583,0,25682,george_n_leighton,,654.643,658.947,"Well, may I -- may I answer Your Honor's question this way?"
1958.583,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,674.539,694.28,"No, what I was -- what I was saying, I don't want to prolong, but what I was saying is if he by asking these questions and inducing the -- the witness to deny that he had such an agreement with him if it was perjury for the -- for the witness to answer as he did is certainly was subornation of perjury --"
1958.583,0,25682,george_n_leighton,,694.28,694.542,"Oh, certainly."
1958.583,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,694.542,695.335,-- on the part of the --
1958.583,0,25682,george_n_leighton,,695.335,695.443,"Oh, certainly."
1958.583,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,695.443,696.107,-- District Attorney --
1958.583,0,25682,george_n_leighton,,696.107,696.316,Yes.
1958.583,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,696.316,696.523,-- wasn't it?
1958.583,0,25682,george_n_leighton,,696.523,697.852,It will be three years after that date.
1958.583,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,697.852,698.874,I supposed it will be three years after (Voice Overlap) --
1958.583,0,25682,george_n_leighton,,698.874,699.441,After that date.
1958.583,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,700.094,702.235,I don't want to take any more of your time.
1958.583,0,25682,george_n_leighton,,702.235,703.55,On Illinois practice.
1958.583,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,867.055,877.501,"Now, on those -- among the allegations in that earlier writ however, wasn't there a claim of the use -- unconstitutional use of a coerced confession?"
1958.583,0,25682,george_n_leighton,,877.501,878.468,"That's right, Your Honor."
1958.583,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,878.468,888.513,And doesn't it appear now in the record of this case as a record on page 45 and 57 and maybe elsewhere that no -- no confession was used in the trial?
1958.583,0,25682,george_n_leighton,,888.513,890.17,There's no -- no confession was used.
1958.583,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,950.749,958.281,"As I read the record at page 45, the petitioner himself says, and I'm quoting now, “They did not use any confession in my trial.”"
1958.583,0,25682,george_n_leighton,,958.281,959.407,"That's right, Your Honor."
1958.583,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,962.389,979.86,"Now, while we're on the facts, Mr. Leighton, you've confront yourself, as I gather, the -- perhaps the Supreme Court of Illinois did to the version of the facts contained in the application for a writ of error coram nobis on behalf of Hamer which was filed by Myers."
1958.583,0,25682,george_n_leighton,,979.86,982.642,"That's right, Your Honor."
1958.583,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,982.642,990.242,"Myers also testified in this very case, didn't he, and his testimony appearing on pages 50 to 60 in the record?"
1958.583,0,25682,george_n_leighton,,990.242,991.469,"That's right, Your Honor."
1958.583,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,991.469,1004.937,And wouldn't it be fair to say that his testimony particularly that on page 58 and 59 very substantially from what's contained in his application for the writ of error coram nobis?
1958.583,0,25682,george_n_leighton,,1004.937,1005.681,"Yes, Your Honor."
1958.583,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1009.895,1010.738,On behalf of the State actually.
1958.583,0,25682,george_n_leighton,,1010.738,1014.33,On behalf of the State in defense of the petition of habeas corpus.
1958.583,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1046.221,1049.601,Was that actually an affidavit or was it an unsworn pleading?
1958.583,0,25682,george_n_leighton,,1049.601,1051.895,"No, Your Honor, it was an affidavit."
1958.583,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1056.362,1057.438,4.
1958.583,0,25682,george_n_leighton,,1057.438,1061.592,"-- 24, his affidavit, you see, in support of the -- of his petition --"
1958.583,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1061.592,1061.926,I see.
1958.583,0,25682,george_n_leighton,,1061.926,1070.618,-- appears on page 24 of the record and sworn to him -- by him.
1958.583,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1070.618,1084.605,"And insofar as there is a factual conflict, I -- it's your position, as I understand it, that the Illinois Supreme Court, the -- the majority of the Court, the Court itself found the facts as they appear, substantially as they appear in the affidavit."
1958.583,0,25682,george_n_leighton,,1084.605,1085.661,That's right Your Honor.
1958.583,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1085.661,1089.402,And that the way therefore foreclosed by that finding?
1958.583,0,25682,george_n_leighton,,1089.402,1089.764,That's right.
1958.583,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1091.453,1092.25,Is that your position?
1958.583,0,25682,george_n_leighton,,1092.25,1093.743,"That's right, Your Honor."
1958.583,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1095.824,1097.51,"You may, Mr. Leighton."
1958.583,0,25682,george_n_leighton,,1097.51,1105.778,Thank you.
1958.583,1,46556,william_c_wines,,1105.778,1105.879,May it please --
1958.583,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1105.879,1106.334,Mr. Wines.
1958.583,1,46556,william_c_wines,,1106.334,1107.878,-- the Court.
1958.583,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1374.082,1376.327,"Mr. Wines, (Inaudible)"
1958.583,1,46556,william_c_wines,,1376.327,1377.126,"Yes, Your Honor."
1958.583,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1378.53,1384.539,We may -- we may determine this case on the admission then that there was perjury on --
1958.583,1,46556,william_c_wines,,1384.539,1389.387,"I don't see anyway to avoid it and then meted, Your Honor, after -- after studying this record."
1958.583,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1416.199,1417.82,"Oh, I -- I thought your going to leave --"
1958.583,1,46556,william_c_wines,,1417.82,1418.228,Yes.
1958.583,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1418.228,1425.946,-- in some place and I was just going far away where you were reading from.
1958.583,1,46556,william_c_wines,,1425.946,1445.529,"Well, I -- I -- at several places in the record, I will read from the dissenting opinion which begins at page 73 in the brown-covered transcript of the record."
1958.583,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1619.453,1621.402,Incidentally and before you leave (Voice Overlap) --
1958.583,1,46556,william_c_wines,,1621.402,1621.984,"Yes, Your Honor."
1958.583,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1621.984,1623.852,This probably is entirely irrelevant.
1958.583,1,46556,william_c_wines,,1628.242,1630.315,I don't know.
1958.583,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1632.702,1632.785,That's --
1958.583,1,46556,william_c_wines,,1632.785,1636.942,But I -- I don't know on the record or off the record.
1958.583,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,1636.942,1639.108,What is his sentence?
1958.583,1,46556,william_c_wines,,1639.108,1645.52,"Hamer's sentence was 199 years, as I recall."
1958.583,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2051.502,2059.775,Isn't that a -- isn't that a contradiction in terms and it was known that some perjury was committed but the jury was never told how much perjury was committed.
1958.583,1,46556,william_c_wines,,2061.237,2063.987,"That is the fact of the case, Your Honor."
1958.583,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2064.864,2065.091,Yes.
1958.583,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,2065.091,2066.085,-- the facts at all.
1958.583,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2109.031,2110.986,Are you sitting down?
1958.583,1,46556,william_c_wines,,2115.672,2143.356,"Only this, Your Honor, that in the Hysler case, coram nobis was brought and there, the Court -- a majority of this Court read the record as finding that no perjury had in fact been committed or if committed, it was not known to public officials."
1958.583,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2151.292,2166.321,Is passing upon the adequacy of the affidavits submitted to the Florida Supreme Court under its procedure that the Florida Supreme Court to decide whether there's enough to raise the question of fact before the trial court.
1958.583,1,46556,william_c_wines,,2167.348,2168.695,That's right.
1958.583,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2168.825,2174.785,"Now, here's an -- here, the point is, there's no question about conceded use of --"
1958.583,1,46556,william_c_wines,,2174.785,2174.97,That's true.
1958.583,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2174.97,2177.058,-- conceded use of perjury --
1958.583,1,46556,william_c_wines,,2177.058,2177.169,That's true.
1958.583,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2177.169,2178.549,-- concededly used --
1958.583,1,46556,william_c_wines,,2178.549,2178.956,That's true.
1958.583,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2178.956,2180.547,-- as the knowledge of the District Attorney.
1958.583,1,46556,william_c_wines,,2180.547,2181.243,That's true.
1958.583,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2181.243,2183.907,"Well, now, what is the -- how can you say -- what's the bearing of the Hysler case."
1958.583,1,46556,william_c_wines,,2183.907,2189.071,The Hysler case has this bearing and this bearing only and no other.
1958.583,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2233.541,2235.186,That is not a question.
1958.583,1,46556,william_c_wines,,2238.43,2239.029,Yes.
1958.583,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2239.029,2244.419,-- but it's an ultimate determination of whether or not there's a violation of the Due Process Clause.
1958.583,1,46556,william_c_wines,,2246.042,2247.058,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1958.583,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2247.058,2250.769,"Now, that wasn't Hysler at all."
1958.583,1,46556,william_c_wines,,2296.104,2297.66,That's right.
1958.583,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2297.66,2306.215,"-- can the State said, “Well, we look at the record and we say that it wouldn't have made any difference if this fellow had never put on the stand or had never lied?"
1958.583,1,46556,william_c_wines,,2306.94,2309.601,Not -- not precisely right.
1958.583,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2309.601,2309.677,Well --
1958.583,1,46556,william_c_wines,,2309.677,2311.051,There's a -- there's a little more --
1958.583,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2311.051,2312.266,You add a touch of precision to it.
1958.583,1,46556,william_c_wines,,2312.266,2315.275,"But there's a little more than that, Your Honor."
1958.583,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2317.455,2318.337,Knowingly used?
1958.583,1,46556,william_c_wines,,2318.337,2320.126,Knowingly used.
1958.583,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2324.814,2324.954,Well --
1958.583,1,46556,william_c_wines,,2324.954,2327.545,That was revealed to the jury.
1958.583,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2327.545,2332.059,That the jury knew that -- but the jury didn't know that it was the District Attorney that --
1958.583,1,46556,william_c_wines,,2332.059,2332.302,That's right.
1958.583,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2332.302,2332.885,-- was stating --
1958.583,1,46556,william_c_wines,,2332.885,2333.874,That is right.
1958.583,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2334.608,2334.982,"Well, that may make all --"
1958.583,1,46556,william_c_wines,,2334.982,2335.538,-- the nub of the matter.
1958.583,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2335.538,2337.345,-- the difference in the world.
1958.583,1,46556,william_c_wines,,2337.345,2337.997,I beg your pardon?
1958.583,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2337.997,2341.084,That may make all the difference in the world.
1958.583,1,46556,william_c_wines,,2359.514,2362.407,If that is --
1958.583,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2362.407,2363.546,Isn't that true?
