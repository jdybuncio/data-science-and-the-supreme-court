2018.17-1091,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,6.28,"We'll hear argument this morning in Case 17-1091, Timbs versus Indiana. Mr. Hottot."
2018.17-1091,0,63061,wesley_p_hottot,,6.28,24.56,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The freedom from excessive fines applies to the states because it is deeply rooted in our nation's history and traditions and fundamental to our scheme of ordered liberty. The State of Indiana appears not to dispute that straightforward answer to the actual question presented."
2018.17-1091,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,66.6,73.0,Is that so of all incorporations? What about the non-unanimous jury in -- in criminal cases?
2018.17-1091,0,63061,wesley_p_hottot,,73.0,109.52,"Justice Ginsburg, as the Court recognized in McDonald, the non-unanimous jury in criminal cases is an anomalous decision that results from a one-justice concurrence in the Apodaca case, and there's no reason, as the Court recognized in McDonald, for that to control when there's over 50 years of precedent, beginning in Malloy versus Hogan, Mapp, Aguilar, again in McDonald, rejecting that two-track approach. Adopting the two-track approach at this late stage would only invite further litigation about rights that are already incorporated."
2018.17-1091,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,136.28,139.64,"There are a few others that have not been incorporated, isn't that right?"
2018.17-1091,0,63061,wesley_p_hottot,,139.64,141.92,"Oh, that's true, absolutely."
2018.17-1091,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,171.2,176.88,"Well, what is the provision in the Constitution that you rely on?"
2018.17-1091,0,63061,wesley_p_hottot,,176.88,179.6,"The Section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment, Your Honor."
2018.17-1091,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,179.6,187.92,It's a component of -- of the liberty that's substantively -- substantively protected by the Fourth Amendment's Due Process Clause?
2018.17-1091,0,63061,wesley_p_hottot,,187.92,188.48,"Yes, Your Honor."
2018.17-1091,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,194.44,197.48,That would leave out non-citizens?
2018.17-1091,0,63061,wesley_p_hottot,,197.48,204.16,"Yes, textually, Justice Ginsburg, that would leave out non-citizens, but, of course, Petitioner is a citizen, and that could be a decision for another day."
2018.17-1091,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,216.28,240.96,"Well, but you can see there's different arguments about whether -- and this, I gather, is the State's primary submission -- whether excessive fines are prohibited and whether civil in rem forfeitures are. And I certainly understand the argument that the disproportion and excessiveness arguments would be quite different with respect to forfeiting the instrumentalities of the crime."
2018.17-1091,0,63061,wesley_p_hottot,,246.36,275.52,"I don't agree, Your Honor, because whatever might be said of historic in rem forfeiture practices, forfeitures today, like this one, are fines within the meaning of the clause. The Court was unanimous on that point in Austin, and since then, it has reaffirmed that point in the Bajakajian case, in the Hudson case, and most recently in Kokesh, all of which rely on Austin. As a result, state and federal courts today are --"
2018.17-1091,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,275.52,283.32,"Well, of course, the -- the argument there was not for the purposes we're talking about today in terms of incorporation."
2018.17-1091,0,63061,wesley_p_hottot,,304.2,304.56,"Well, that --"
2018.17-1091,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,304.56,306.52,"The first one sounds, yeah, that's pretty excessive."
2018.17-1091,0,63061,wesley_p_hottot,,309.96,353.52,"Doubtless, Your Honor, but these questions go to the excessiveness analysis, not to the incorporation analysis that is currently before the Court. When -- when the Court incorporated the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms in the McDonald case, it had rejected that right for 140 years, until the Heller decision, and then, just two years later, incorporated it against the states. So there's no reason to require, as my friend suggests should be required, that -- that litigants show a historic pattern of the right being enforced. And, in any event, as the Court recognized in Austin and Bajakajian and most recently in -- in Kokesh, we're dealing with a different animal."
2018.17-1091,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,369.24,377.2,"Well, your client was convicted of an offense that was punishable by a maximum of 10 years' imprisonment; am I correct?"
2018.17-1091,0,63061,wesley_p_hottot,,377.2,378.4,Twenty years' imprisonment.
2018.17-1091,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,378.4,379.56,Twenty years' imprisonment.
2018.17-1091,0,63061,wesley_p_hottot,,384.32,385.6,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2018.17-1091,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,390.72,399.76,"So, if he had been sentenced to six years of actual imprisonment, would that have been a violation of the Eighth Amendment?"
2018.17-1091,0,63061,wesley_p_hottot,,399.76,400.56,"Possibly, Your Honor."
2018.17-1091,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,432.64,437.8,"Well, what have we said about the application of the grossly disproportionate standard?"
2018.17-1091,0,63061,wesley_p_hottot,,437.8,446.16,"Well, Your Honor, as you know, the -- the Court in Bajakajian articulated that standard for the first time, and it hasn't had an opportunity to address it again since."
2018.17-1091,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,446.16,450.48,"Well, I mean in the context of -- of imprisonment, not fines."
2018.17-1091,0,63061,wesley_p_hottot,,450.48,451.44,"Oh, absolutely, Your Honor."
2018.17-1091,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,479.28,483.24,But -- but your assumption is that you assess the particular circumstances of the case.
2018.17-1091,0,63061,wesley_p_hottot,,524.4,530.48,"Your Honor, excessiveness is ""necessarily fact-intensive."" That's from the Bajakajian case."
2018.17-1091,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,599.44,620.92,"If we were to assume for the sake of argument that imprisonment for six years would not be an Eighth Amendment violation for this offense, what would that say about a fine of $42,000? Is it possible that six years' imprisonment is not an Eighth Amendment violation, but a fine of $42,000 is an Eighth Amendment violation?"
2018.17-1091,0,63061,wesley_p_hottot,,620.92,625.64,"Well, Your Honor, we'd have to know all of the circumstances of the case."
2018.17-1091,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,643.2,646.4,"But we're talking about a federal constitutional standard, not --"
2018.17-1091,0,63061,wesley_p_hottot,,646.4,647.32,Of course.
2018.17-1091,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,647.32,659.28,-- whatever sentencing philosophy any one of the thousands of judges in the United States who impose sentences might think is the right sentence for a particular crime and a particular offender.
2018.17-1091,0,63061,wesley_p_hottot,,659.28,712.0,"Absolutely, Your Honor. But the question presented here is merely whether a defendant in any case has the right to interpose a defense under the Excessive Fines Clause. We're not asking the Court to articulate a new standard of excessiveness. We're not asking the Court to determine that this forfeiture was or was not excessive. We're merely emphasizing that part of the purpose of the Fourteenth Amendment was to guarantee to all 330 million Americans a right to a defense under the Excessive Fines lause. Indiana denied Petitioner that defense, and the Court should reverse and remand. Two state courts here struck down this forfeiture, held that it was punitive under Austin, believing that the clause already applies to the states, and believing that this forfeiture would be excessive. The Indiana Supreme Court did not address the excessiveness question."
2018.17-1091,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,721.6,756.68,"Is there any in rem forfeiture, not this one, which relied on the criminal activity of this defendant, but let's say that Austin -- that the state did away with innocent owner defense so that the forfeiture was against the innocent owner. Would that be punishment? I think under our -- my reading of Austin, it was that only those forfeitures that are punitive count under the clause."
2018.17-1091,0,63061,wesley_p_hottot,,762.56,772.0,"Well, it's important to recognize that Austin says that, if the forfeiture is at least partly punitive, it comes within the confines of the clause."
2018.17-1091,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,772.72,780.92,"So they do away with the innocent owner defense, and the innocent owner comes in and says, this is my property, I didn't commit a crime."
2018.17-1091,0,63061,wesley_p_hottot,,782.44,783.48,"Well, I --"
2018.17-1091,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,783.48,784.96,The property did.
2018.17-1091,0,63061,wesley_p_hottot,,784.96,788.72,"I think, Your Honor, it's -- it's safe to say that that could be deemed excessive."
2018.17-1091,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,811.48,811.68,Why?
2018.17-1091,0,63061,wesley_p_hottot,,811.68,812.44,"Well, three --"
2018.17-1091,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,812.44,817.8,"If it's not punitive against him, it's the property that is being charged --"
2018.17-1091,0,63061,wesley_p_hottot,,817.8,817.92,I see.
2018.17-1091,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,817.92,820.2,-- with having been involved in a crime.
2018.17-1091,0,63061,wesley_p_hottot,,820.2,884.0,"I see your question, Your Honor. I think that if someone had done nothing wrong -- let us say that someone steals my car as I'm walking into a Target, commits a bank robbery, and the police seize that vehicle quite righteously, I mean, as a practical matter, of course, the police are going to return the vehicle to me. But, if the state were to go so far as to institute forfeiture proceedings against that person, as Justice Kennedy recognized in his Austin concurrence, there would be several serious constitutional problems with that. And it -- it may be that in those circumstances, where I'm entirely blameless, that the Court would hold that there is a substantive due process right to reject that forfeiture, or the Court would find it to be grossly disproportionate to the gravity of the nonexistent defense. So I think Bennis can be easily reconciled with this case, particularly when -- when the Court looks at Justice Stevens' dissent in Bennis, which with two other Justices points out that Mrs. Bennis didn't bring an excessive fines defense."
2018.17-1091,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,889.08,898.12,"So you're saying even if it's a classic in rem forfeiture of a kind that's been known for centuries, that would potentially violate the Excessive Fines Clause?"
2018.17-1091,0,63061,wesley_p_hottot,,898.12,899.32,"Yes, Your Honor."
2018.17-1091,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,931.76,941.28,"What is the situation with jail, prison? I have a vague recollection -- often such recollections are incorrect -- (Laughter.)"
2018.17-1091,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,941.28,953.52,-- but I have a vague recollection that there was a case in which California's three-strike law was applied to sentence to life a person whose final offense was stealing an $80 golf club.
2018.17-1091,0,63061,wesley_p_hottot,,988.36,1022.2,"Well, Your Honor, I think the most relevant authority here is the Harmelin decision in which this Court, similar to the situation you're describing, allowed a person to be sentenced from -- a person from Michigan to be sentenced to life without the possibility of parole for having 650 grams of, I believe it was cocaine. And the Court reasoned that, look, that amount of cocaine could be broken up and easily used for distribution, so it's appropriate in these circumstances to punish that harshly. Here, we're dealing with two grams --"
2018.17-1091,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1022.2,1057.56,"My question really is, are there cases where we have said that the punishment is disproportionate, where it's simply a question of the degree of punishment, i.e., life imprisonment, and the nature of the offense, e.g., stealing a golf club? And do you see what I -- I'm not sure there are, and, if there are not, it seems odd, and I think I'd have to think about it, or maybe we should address in some way your argument, as to why there is that difference."
2018.17-1091,0,63061,wesley_p_hottot,,1057.56,1061.72,"Your Honor, I -- I -- I think if we posit that difference, yes, it's --"
2018.17-1091,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1061.72,1063.96,"Am I right, you're saying there is a difference?"
2018.17-1091,0,63061,wesley_p_hottot,,1063.96,1068.84,Between sentencing a person for stealing a golf club to a life --
2018.17-1091,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1068.84,1069.08,Yeah.
2018.17-1091,0,63061,wesley_p_hottot,,1069.08,1069.72,-- a life sentence?
2018.17-1091,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1069.72,1070.48,Uh-huh.
2018.17-1091,0,63061,wesley_p_hottot,,1070.48,1081.76,"I -- I think that, no, there is no difference, and that if -- if there is that tension between the Excessive Fines Clause and the Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause, that in an appropriate case this Court should resolve it."
2018.17-1091,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1082.68,1085.36,"I thought the -- the three strikes, it wasn't simply --"
2018.17-1091,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1085.36,1085.6,Yeah.
2018.17-1091,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1085.6,1089.68,"-- stealing a golf club, it was the third -- the third offense, so it was --"
2018.17-1091,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1089.68,1090.64,"Yeah, he had a history."
2018.17-1091,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1090.64,1092.52,-- it was a punishment for recidivist.
2018.17-1091,0,63061,wesley_p_hottot,,1092.52,1096.76,"Absolutely, Your Honor, and thank you for that."
2018.17-1091,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1096.76,1097.2,Yeah.
2018.17-1091,0,63061,wesley_p_hottot,,1099.16,1099.4,Well --
2018.17-1091,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1099.4,1102.32,This gets me back to the question I was asking before.
2018.17-1091,0,63061,wesley_p_hottot,,1143.36,1188.16,"Your -- Your Honor, although it might be unsatisfying, the Court has said repeatedly that there is no equation and that there can be no equation because these situations are inherently real-world in nature and that courts have been directed, specifically with respect to in rem forfeitures in the Bajakajian case, to assess all of the circumstances. And -- and as Justice Ginsburg was assisting me, it -- it's absolutely the case that the court has to look at not just the value of the property, not just the gravity of the offense, but also the offender himself and his effect, potentially, on the community if he remains at large. There -- there's nothing new about that."
2018.17-1091,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1203.24,1216.6,"So we are several steps removed, but I think that the import of some of these questions is, look, we've made it awfully, awfully hard to assert a disproportionality claim with respect even to imprisonment."
2018.17-1091,0,63061,wesley_p_hottot,,1228.08,1248.88,"That's potentially true, Your Honor, but the standard of assessing this type of economic sanction, it's important to recognize, is being developed as we speak in the lower courts. This Court's decision in Bajakajian has prompted the lower courts to try to articulate factors."
2018.17-1091,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1272.04,1303.32,"Well, but you're asking us to, you know, buy a pig in a poke; in other words, you're saying incorporate this, but, you know, we're -- we don't even know whether it means we're going to decide whether $10,000 is enough or $20,000, or if we're simply going to say something along the lines of Harmelin, which it's not just that it's whatever so many grams; it's that it's the third offense, and so that's -- that's what's the -- protection against that is fundamental to -- to a civilized society or whatever the standard is that we've been applying."
2018.17-1091,0,63061,wesley_p_hottot,,1303.32,1303.44,Well --
2018.17-1091,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1303.44,1307.92,And you say don't worry about what it means; just incorporate it and then figure it out later on.
2018.17-1091,0,63061,wesley_p_hottot,,1307.92,1309.4,"Your Honor, I'm not saying don't worry about it."
2018.17-1091,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1349.84,1351.4,"Well, let me give you two examples."
2018.17-1091,0,63061,wesley_p_hottot,,1358.28,1358.52,Yes.
2018.17-1091,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1358.52,1376.8,"Yes, a Land Rover, had been using a 15-year-old Kia or, at the other extreme, suppose that he used a Bugatti, which costs like a quarter of a million dollars. Would the Excessive Fine Clause apply differently in those three cases?"
2018.17-1091,0,63061,wesley_p_hottot,,1376.8,1377.52,"No, Your Honor."
2018.17-1091,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1379.44,1388.48,"Well, would the result be different? If he had been driving a -- a car with a -- a book value of $1500, would the result be different?"
2018.17-1091,0,63061,wesley_p_hottot,,1388.48,1390.64,"Well, Your Honor, we would have to know more."
2018.17-1091,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1393.04,1393.48,We know.
2018.17-1091,0,63061,wesley_p_hottot,,1395.08,1395.32,Okay.
2018.17-1091,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1395.32,1396.88,We know what the offense is.
2018.17-1091,0,63061,wesley_p_hottot,,1396.88,1403.68,"I -- I think in this instance, any forfeiture of the vehicle would be excessive because this vehicle was not instrumental to this crime."
2018.17-1091,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1419.48,1423.12,"Well, that's contrary to a lot of civil forfeiture law."
2018.17-1091,0,63061,wesley_p_hottot,,1436.12,1441.28,"Potentially, Your Honor. It's -- it's well established that the car is subject to forfeiture."
2018.17-1091,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1446.96,1450.28,"Well, does it make a difference -- we've been talking about the value of the -- the item."
2018.17-1091,0,63061,wesley_p_hottot,,1457.0,1457.08,Well --
2018.17-1091,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1457.08,1462.28,"And -- and yet, if someone is impoverished, it is excessive? Does that matter?"
2018.17-1091,0,63061,wesley_p_hottot,,1462.28,1469.96,"Well, Your Honor, if the Court looks to the brief of the Eighth Amendment scholars, filed in support of neither party, they discuss this."
2018.17-1091,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1505.0,1514.08,"What is the -- on the federal side, how does this work? What kind of forfeitures have been held unconstitutional? Have any?"
2018.17-1091,0,63061,wesley_p_hottot,,1514.08,1515.48,"Yes, Your Honor."
2018.17-1091,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1565.36,1572.0,"Thank you, counsel. General Fisher."
2018.17-1091,1,42698,thomas_m_fisher,,1572.0,1586.24,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In rem forfeitures have been a feature of the Anglo-American judicial system for hundreds of years, but until about 25 years ago, no court had held that they were subject to a proportionality limitation."
2018.17-1091,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1588.36,1627.44,"General, before we get to the in rem argument and its application to this case, can we just get one thing off the table? We all agree that the Excessive Fines Clause is incorporated against the states. Whether this particular fine qualifies because it's an in rem forfeiture, another question. But can we at least get the -- the theoretical question off the table, whether you want to do it through the Due Process Clause and look at history and tradition, you know, gosh, excessive fines, guarantees against them go back to Magna Carta and 1225, the English Bill of Rights, the Virginia Declaration of Rights, pretty deep history, or whether one wants to look at privileges and immunities, you might come to the same conclusion."
2018.17-1091,1,42698,thomas_m_fisher,,1629.52,1631.08,I have two responses to that.
2018.17-1091,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1631.4,1635.96,"Well, I -- I think -- I think a ""yes"" or ""no"" would probably be a good starting place. (Laughter.)"
2018.17-1091,1,42698,thomas_m_fisher,,1635.96,1642.12,"Well, I think, with respect to in personam, the answer is yes, but you -- you have to take into account -- and this is the methodology of McDonald."
2018.17-1091,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1656.12,1666.68,"Well, whatever the Excessive Fine Clause guarantees, we can argue, again, about its scope and in rem and in personam, but whatever it, in fact, is, it applies against the states, right?"
2018.17-1091,1,42698,thomas_m_fisher,,1666.68,1669.2,"Well, again, that depends."
2018.17-1091,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1669.2,1673.12,"I mean, most -- most of these incorporation cases took place in like the 1940s."
2018.17-1091,1,42698,thomas_m_fisher,,1673.12,1673.6,Right.
2018.17-1091,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1673.6,1675.16,And here we are in 2018 --
2018.17-1091,1,42698,thomas_m_fisher,,1675.16,1675.24,Right.
2018.17-1091,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1675.24,1678.32,-- still litigating incorporation of the Bill of Rights.
2018.17-1091,1,42698,thomas_m_fisher,,1680.32,1689.52,"My -- well, I think what you have to take into account, though, is the history, and you have to take into account all the history, not just the in personam history, the in rem history."
2018.17-1091,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1689.52,1701.08,"Well, for the clause, why do you have to take into account all of the history, to pick up on Justice Gorsuch's question? Isn't it just too late in the day to argue that any of the Bill of Rights is not incorporated?"
2018.17-1091,1,42698,thomas_m_fisher,,1701.08,1709.96,The Court has never incorporated a right against the states where it could not conclude that there was a relationship that was fundamental or -- and deeply rooted in our history and tradition.
2018.17-1091,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1709.96,1717.84,"But aren't -- but aren't all -- all the Bill of Rights at this point in our conception of what they stand for, the history of each of them, incorporated?"
2018.17-1091,1,42698,thomas_m_fisher,,1717.84,1724.4,"Well, with fairness, not with your -- respect to your concession -- conception on excessive fines, and Austin's what stands in the way of that."
2018.17-1091,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1732.04,1736.68,Bajakajian cited it in a footnote with seeming approval.
2018.17-1091,1,42698,thomas_m_fisher,,1736.68,1741.72,"Well, that would -- that's -- one thing that's interesting about that footnote is that it's as weak an endorsement as I think we can imagine."
2018.17-1091,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1765.92,1794.2,"If I -- if I understood your response to Justice Gorsuch, it was essentially that we can't answer the question wholesale, that we have to look at the particular right being invoked. So I guess the question is, do you have a theory about how we go about dividing up rights? You know, how do we decide that we're looking at a particular right against in rem forfeitures as opposed to a general right against excessive fines?"
2018.17-1091,1,42698,thomas_m_fisher,,1794.2,1796.96,"Well, I think McDonald gives us some instruction on that."
2018.17-1091,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1820.4,1826.44,"I mean, that seems to make the incorporation question sort of indistinguishable from the substantive question."
2018.17-1091,1,42698,thomas_m_fisher,,1826.44,1835.4,"I think you have to come to grips with the history, whether you just -- whether you call it incorporation or you call it the substantive merits question."
2018.17-1091,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1841.88,1853.4,"Wait a minute, counsel, you know, if -- if -- just -- just to pause on that for a second, you know, the Indiana Supreme Court didn't address the merits questions, didn't address any of this forfeiture, in rem, in personam."
2018.17-1091,1,42698,thomas_m_fisher,,1867.92,1880.08,"Well, the problem with relying on lower court percolation on the merits question, in terms of whether Austin is correct, is that Austin binds the lower courts. They don't have an opportunity to revisit that. This Court does."
2018.17-1091,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1882.0,1882.44,Okay.
2018.17-1091,1,42698,thomas_m_fisher,,1890.12,1894.48,"Well, I'm not sure what you mean by the -- the merits question in that regard."
2018.17-1091,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1936.92,1956.96,"But we do have relatively recent history calling into question the division between in rem and in personam. Certainly, in the area of personal jurisdiction, it was once quasi in rem jurisdiction and personal jurisdiction, and yet, in Shaffer against Heitner, the Court said we're not going to do that anymore."
2018.17-1091,1,42698,thomas_m_fisher,,1975.92,1987.16,"Well, with respect to Shaffer, I think what's critical there is the word ""quasi"" because, of course, it was not a straight-up in rem proceeding. We're talking about the ability to seize assets for a case where there had been an in personam judgment."
2018.17-1091,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2014.0,2044.56,"What is the difference between the approach that you're advocating here and the way the Court used to address the question whether rights protected by the Bill of Rights apply to the states, before it began the process of incorporating provisions of the Bill of Rights one by one, and it said that what applied to the states were those rights that were implicit in the concept of ordered liberty. So there was a two-tiered system."
2018.17-1091,1,42698,thomas_m_fisher,,2050.2,2050.64,We don't --
2018.17-1091,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2050.64,2055.8,Is there a difference? I -- I don't -- could you explain what is the difference between those two approaches?
2018.17-1091,1,42698,thomas_m_fisher,,2055.8,2056.52,"Yes, indeed."
2018.17-1091,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2093.08,2099.52,"But, if Austin were overruled, then the rule as applicable to the federal government would change as well?"
2018.17-1091,1,42698,thomas_m_fisher,,2099.52,2100.24,That's right.
2018.17-1091,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2101.52,2103.24,So I'm still not seeing the difference between them.
2018.17-1091,1,42698,thomas_m_fisher,,2103.24,2131.4,"Well, the difference would be, if -- if you look at Austin -- if you were to look at Austin and say, you know what, Austin was dead right, historically -- this is historically rooted and it is fundamental, then I don't think there's any grounds for us to say that there should be -- that the outcome should be any different between the states and the federal government. If you look at Austin and you say, you know what, that's questionable, but we don't want to overturn it because stare decisis principles counsel against that, that's a -- that's a different analysis, and that's more like Hurtado, more like Bombolis."
2018.17-1091,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2131.4,2149.24,"Well, isn't that pretty much what the dissent in McDonald said? We don't like Heller, but at least let's just keep it applicable to the District of Columbia and the federal government and not apply it to the states."
2018.17-1091,1,42698,thomas_m_fisher,,2149.24,2159.16,"Well, I think that was a -- a different -- for a different reason in that the plurality acknowledged the distinction with Bombolis and Hurtado being purely a matter of stare decisis."
2018.17-1091,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2232.24,2244.28,"Well, in your view, an in rem civil forfeiture is not an excessive fine, is that right?"
2018.17-1091,1,42698,thomas_m_fisher,,2244.28,2245.6,"Yes, that is -- that is true."
2018.17-1091,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2245.6,2267.6,"So what is to happen if a state needing revenue says anyone who speeds has to forfeit the Bugatti, Mercedes, or a special Ferrari or even jalopy? (Laughter.)"
2018.17-1091,1,42698,thomas_m_fisher,,2267.6,2272.4,"There -- no, there is no -- there is no excessive fines issue there."
2018.17-1091,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2283.8,2289.8,That isn't a problem because it was the Bugatti in which he was speeding. (Laughter.)
2018.17-1091,1,42698,thomas_m_fisher,,2289.8,2290.32,Right.
2018.17-1091,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2290.32,2293.16,So -- so there is all the nexus.
2018.17-1091,1,42698,thomas_m_fisher,,2293.16,2293.76,Historically --
2018.17-1091,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2293.76,2299.92,"Now I just wonder, what -- what is it? What is it? That -- is that just permissible under the Constitution?"
2018.17-1091,1,42698,thomas_m_fisher,,2299.92,2301.16,To forfeit the Bugatti for speeding?
2018.17-1091,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2301.16,2305.32,"Yeah, and, by the way, it was only five miles an hour --"
2018.17-1091,1,42698,thomas_m_fisher,,2305.32,2305.88,Yeah.
2018.17-1091,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2305.88,2306.64,-- above the speed limit.
2018.17-1091,1,42698,thomas_m_fisher,,2306.64,2309.12,"Well, you know, the answer is yes."
2018.17-1091,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2310.48,2311.08,Is it yes?
2018.17-1091,1,42698,thomas_m_fisher,,2311.08,2312.52,"Yes, it's forfeitable."
2018.17-1091,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2312.52,2313.88,It is forfeitable?
2018.17-1091,1,42698,thomas_m_fisher,,2313.88,2314.64,Yeah.
2018.17-1091,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2323.32,2328.32,So if the airplane is speeding -- (Laughter.)
2018.17-1091,1,42698,thomas_m_fisher,,2328.32,2332.36,"Well, in rem forfeitures have -- have -- have always been with us and they have always been harsh."
2018.17-1091,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2332.36,2357.64,"General, yeah, that -- that is true, but that's because at a certain -- up to a certain point in our history, we didn't apply the Bill of Rights to the states. So, in all of the situations before we apply the Bill of Rights to this -- before we apply the Bill of Rights to states, they did things that, under incorporation, were unconstitutional."
2018.17-1091,1,42698,thomas_m_fisher,,2452.36,2456.64,"Well, the history that's relevant is not simply the history of what states were doing."
2018.17-1091,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2497.76,2511.28,"Well, the -- the part that's different about modern forfeitures -- and I think this is what Justice Sotomayor's getting at -- is that many of them are punitive to the person and that that was not part of in rem forfeitures at common law."
2018.17-1091,1,42698,thomas_m_fisher,,2511.28,2511.88,Well --
2018.17-1091,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2511.88,2517.08,"We're dealing with a world in which it's different in kind, not just degree, not just a number but in kind."
2018.17-1091,1,42698,thomas_m_fisher,,2523.24,2523.64,Well --
2018.17-1091,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2523.64,2545.28,"And I guess I'm asking you, given the concession by the State before the Indiana Supreme Court that the forfeiture here was punitive, if we do -- don't overrule Austin, and you want us to apply not just the question of incorporation but go to the merits, don't you lose?"
2018.17-1091,1,42698,thomas_m_fisher,,2545.28,2553.56,"No, I don't think we lose because I don't think -- the -- the question of punitive and remedial is -- is something that Austin borrowed from Halper."
2018.17-1091,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2568.04,2568.2,Sure.
2018.17-1091,1,42698,thomas_m_fisher,,2571.72,2574.04,But -- but I don't think you can take these on a case-by-case basis.
2018.17-1091,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2587.12,2591.76,The statute here says it's punitive and you've conceded the statute's punitive.
2018.17-1091,1,42698,thomas_m_fisher,,2596.04,2613.36,"Well, I -- I suppose -- I mean, if -- if that's -- if it's the magic word ""punitive,"" we can just change the statute, but I don't think that would be a very satisfactory result. I think what the Court is probably looking for is some better way to -- to describe what is included within the Excessive Fines Clause, something more substantive than that."
2018.17-1091,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2698.68,2722.92,"Well, are we going to be wiping all that away or just leaving that for another day? I mean, it -- it -- what -- I guess this gets back to Justice Gorsuch's first question. I mean, the question presented is does the Excessive Fines Clause -- you know, is it incorporated in the Eighth Amendment? And I guess your argument is -- seems to be this isn't an excessive fine, and, in fact, it isn't a fine at all. Well, we can deal with that later, right?"
2018.17-1091,1,42698,thomas_m_fisher,,2722.92,2731.48,"Well, first of all, of course, it's in front of you now, so why not. It's been -- you know, it's been briefed and the lower courts can't come to any opposite conclusion."
2018.17-1091,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2752.08,2769.64,"Well, you just -- you just want us to make sure that in our opinion that we say, if we're ruling against you, that the excessive fines are incorporate -- incorporated under -- under our incorporation doctrine and not say civil in rem forfeitures are incorporated?"
2018.17-1091,1,42698,thomas_m_fisher,,2769.64,2777.44,"Well, but if that's all the Court says, unfortunately, the lower courts are going to then read Austin and say, well, you're at civil in rem and so that's part of excessive fines."
2018.17-1091,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2784.04,2787.48,"So, just so I'm clear, you're asking us to overrule Austin?"
2018.17-1091,1,42698,thomas_m_fisher,,2787.48,2788.76,I think that's the most historically --
2018.17-1091,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2788.76,2791.28,Because that's the only way that you can win with a straight face?
2018.17-1091,1,42698,thomas_m_fisher,,2791.28,2792.04,"No, I don't -- (Laughter.)"
2018.17-1091,1,42698,thomas_m_fisher,,2792.04,2793.24,Not with a straight face. No.
2018.17-1091,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2810.84,2826.32,"But, again, it -- it just seems as though there are two questions, and one question is incorporating the right, and the other question is the scope of the right to be incorporated. And, really, what you're arguing is about the scope of the right."
2018.17-1091,1,42698,thomas_m_fisher,,2826.32,2827.84,"Well, but I'm --"
2018.17-1091,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2827.84,2829.16,And we can incorporate the right --
2018.17-1091,1,42698,thomas_m_fisher,,2829.16,2829.56,Yeah.
2018.17-1091,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2829.56,2837.96,"-- without saying a word about the scope of the right. Now, as you say, Austin says something about the scope of the right, and that's a problem for you."
2018.17-1091,1,42698,thomas_m_fisher,,2842.8,2864.16,"Well, certainly, that would -- that's our -- what we think is the most historically sound thing to do, but even if you, you know, assume that away and were just looking at what this -- whether we're going to incorporate the right, the test for incorporation is historically rooted or -- or fundamental to ordered liberty. And to answer that question, you have to look at the history of the right."
2018.17-1091,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2865.64,2871.6,"Well, that's why -- why I asked at the beginning what's your theory for how you define the right and which history you look to --"
2018.17-1091,1,42698,thomas_m_fisher,,2871.6,2871.92,Yeah.
2018.17-1091,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2871.92,2876.68,-- because you're really suggesting that we don't take the right wholesale; we try to chop it up.
2018.17-1091,1,42698,thomas_m_fisher,,2908.44,2909.8,We think that's one way to do it.
2018.17-1091,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2947.36,2955.04,"You cited McDonald as an example earlier of a case where the Court had, in your view, chopped up the right as incorporated."
2018.17-1091,1,42698,thomas_m_fisher,,2958.52,2959.04,"Oh, no, no, no."
2018.17-1091,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2973.0,2981.6,"But you agree post-McDonald -- and this is similar, I think, to what Justice Kagan's asking -- that the -- the right is the same as against the states and the federal government?"
2018.17-1091,1,42698,thomas_m_fisher,,2981.6,2982.2,"Oh, yes."
2018.17-1091,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3005.36,3018.16,"Well, at the time of McDonald and at the present time, all the -- the Court has held that the Second Amendment right protects the right to have certain firearms in the home for self-defense."
2018.17-1091,1,42698,thomas_m_fisher,,3042.52,3048.2,"Well, I think particularly given the methodology the Court would use in coming to grips with what that new right is, it would likely just follow."
2018.17-1091,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3249.68,3252.12,"Thank you, General. Mr. Hottot, four minutes."
2018.17-1091,2,63061,wesley_p_hottot,,3252.12,3257.76,"Your Honors, this case is about constitutional housekeeping."
2018.17-1091,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3403.2,3404.08,"Thank you, counsel."
