1971.70-5038,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1994.666,1999.348,"I thought the issue in this case was just, whether Coleman was to be retroactive?"
1971.70-5038,1,30606,james_e_gildea,,1999.348,2002.655,That is correct Your Honor.
1971.70-5038,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2051.36,2059.11,"The sentence you are saying that nothing can be accomplished, why do lawyers retain counsel, a waste of time at preliminary hearings?"

1971.70-5038,1,30606,james_e_gildea,,2068.233,2075.924,"Well, something can be accomplished but something could also have been accomplished in Miranda, something could also have been accomplished in Wade and Gilbert and --"
1971.70-5038,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2075.924,2077.924,You have only got Coleman there.
1971.70-5038,1,30606,james_e_gildea,,2077.924,2089.011,That is correct but in the resolution of -- whether or not this substantially affects a subsequent trial.
1971.70-5038,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2101.684,2106.699,"Well, would not the presence of counsel increase the truth finding process?"
1971.70-5038,1,30606,james_e_gildea,,2106.699,2112.045,That would be I think a -- the very least it could do is just speculation.
1971.70-5038,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2113.529,2123.696,You do not think that defense counsel do its cross-examination that aid the truth finding factor.

1971.70-5038,1,30606,james_e_gildea,,2171.426,2172.933,"He will cross-examine, yes Your Honor."
1971.70-5038,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2173.467,2175.589,Because he has not got a thing in the world to loose.
1971.70-5038,1,30606,james_e_gildea,,2175.589,2176.527,That is correct.
1971.70-5038,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2176.527,2177.929,So he will cross-examine.
