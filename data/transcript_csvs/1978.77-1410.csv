1978.77-1410,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,46.534,"We'll hear arguments, next, in Butner against the United States."
1978.77-1410,0,29197,j_steven_brackett,,51.296,54.134,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1978.77-1410,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,583.999,586.821,"Mr. Brackett, let me interrupt you at this point."
1978.77-1410,0,29197,j_steven_brackett,,586.821,587.664,Yes sir.
1978.77-1410,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,587.664,594.128,Do you have any comment with respect to the passage of the new Bankruptcy Act and its bearing on this case?
1978.77-1410,0,29197,j_steven_brackett,,594.128,601.051,"Your Honor, we felt like that was probably that one of the reasons that why we are here on this case."
1978.77-1410,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,631.493,636.548,"Well, if it does have a bearing it may make this case a lot less important than it might otherwise be."
1978.77-1410,0,29197,j_steven_brackett,,651.717,654.312,Yes sir.
1978.77-1410,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,681.447,700.505,Do the Courts of Appeals in their split treat it as a question of federal law on which that they disagree or do they treat it as questions of state law arising within their various circuits?
1978.77-1410,0,29197,j_steven_brackett,,700.505,703.125,"Your Honor, I think that is the split of the cases."
1978.77-1410,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,744.063,762.658,Do any of the Courts that Appeals take the position that if the creditor had provided for in the mortgage agreement that the rent should secure the security that would not be followed by the bankruptcy court?
1978.77-1410,0,29197,j_steven_brackett,,762.658,764.286,"No sir, I don't believe so."
1978.77-1410,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,774.409,779.559,"So, the mortgagee can protect himself within any other circuits by putting a provision in the mortgage agreement?"
1978.77-1410,0,29197,j_steven_brackett,,779.559,787.284,"Skillful drafting of the mortgage agreement would be the first step that mortgagor would have him protect himself, yes."
1978.77-1410,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1029.137,1030.65,Can I just interrupt?
1978.77-1410,0,29197,j_steven_brackett,,1030.65,1031.048,Yes sir.
1978.77-1410,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1031.048,1033.002,You are relying on the Parker case is it?
1978.77-1410,0,29197,j_steven_brackett,,1033.002,1033.742,Yes sir.
1978.77-1410,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1033.742,1035.026,Did you cite that in your brief?
1978.77-1410,0,29197,j_steven_brackett,,1035.026,1035.912,"No sir, we did not."
1978.77-1410,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1039.621,1040.835,Oh I see.
1978.77-1410,0,29197,j_steven_brackett,,1042.483,1043.06,Yes sir.
1978.77-1410,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1148.651,1150.037,"Brackett, just a second to follow it?"
1978.77-1410,0,29197,j_steven_brackett,,1150.037,1150.332,Yes sir.
1978.77-1410,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1150.332,1150.934,It's rather complicated case.
1978.77-1410,0,29197,j_steven_brackett,,1150.934,1153.0,It's a complicated set of facts.
1978.77-1410,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1153.0,1154.223,Two questions on that.
1978.77-1410,0,29197,j_steven_brackett,,1161.876,1162.807,No Sir.
1978.77-1410,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1187.811,1195.162,I thought you said North Carolina required you to get the rents to request?
1978.77-1410,0,29197,j_steven_brackett,,1195.162,1205.693,"North Carolina requires that you take possession, that the mortgagee take possession or otherwise seek to protect himself by having a receiver appointed."
1978.77-1410,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1205.693,1209.867,"But you didn't request the rents, you could have?"
1978.77-1410,0,29197,j_steven_brackett,,1209.867,1227.937,"No sir, we contend what we did here was address the attorney for the debtor, ask him to have a receiver appointed and that the receiver's instructions from the Bankruptcy Court were to collect the rents and then they established a priority as to how those rents would be disposed off."
1978.77-1410,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1227.937,1242.798,What you call our attention to in the record is the order appointing the trustee or whatever he is to act for Court and that order recites that the motion was made by the attorney for the debtor and you are telling us that motion was made by attorney for the debtor because you requested him to do so.
1978.77-1410,0,29197,j_steven_brackett,,1245.208,1258.04,"Your Honor, if you look two pages before that in record, I believe at 202."
1978.77-1410,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1258.04,1261.889,"Several parties shall be savings, they all the same second mortgagees at the --"
1978.77-1410,0,29197,j_steven_brackett,,1261.889,1262.638,"No, sir."
1978.77-1410,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1267.838,1269.294,But this is Acadia (ph) case as I understand.
1978.77-1410,0,29197,j_steven_brackett,,1269.294,1278.943,"Yes sir, there are four, there were four tracts of line, four different institutions held first deeds of trust on those properties."
1978.77-1410,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1290.735,1300.767,And the point is that the second mortgagee or second deed of trust holders requested this procedure and that the first land holders would be taking care of and first (Inaudible) would be paid to your people.
1978.77-1410,0,29197,j_steven_brackett,,1300.767,1301.279,Yes sir.
1978.77-1410,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1301.279,1301.748,I see.
1978.77-1410,0,29197,j_steven_brackett,,1301.748,1302.771,Yes sir.
1978.77-1410,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1305.967,1309.063,"You really just ask that the mortgage payments be made, do you?"
1978.77-1410,0,29197,j_steven_brackett,,1309.063,1309.694,"Yes, sir."
1978.77-1410,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1309.694,1312.287,And any balance to unsecured creditors?
1978.77-1410,0,29197,j_steven_brackett,,1312.287,1312.937,No sir.
1978.77-1410,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1312.937,1316.062,"Well, that's what your request was?"
1978.77-1410,0,29197,j_steven_brackett,,1316.062,1320.712,I think the request is to be taken in context with order and request was --
1978.77-1410,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1320.712,1324.063,For the benefit of secondary lien holders and the unsecured creditors.
1978.77-1410,0,29197,j_steven_brackett,,1324.063,1341.168,"Yes sir, to the extent that's the as a Court, as a Court can see from the order, they were four priorities set up and the unsecured creditors were not part of the priorities ordered by the bankruptcy Court at all."
1978.77-1410,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1341.168,1349.383,But the trustee didn't have to pay or they didn't have to do anything more than pay the payments as they can do?
1978.77-1410,0,29197,j_steven_brackett,,1349.383,1360.344,"Yes sir, he was required under the order to collect the rents, to sequester those to keep proper ledger cards and then to apply them in accordance with order of the bankruptcy judge."
1978.77-1410,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1367.43,1375.176,Well suppose there was more current income than necessary to pay the mortgage payments.
1978.77-1410,0,29197,j_steven_brackett,,1375.176,1375.94,Yes sir.
1978.77-1410,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1375.94,1377.153,What happens to the balance?
1978.77-1410,0,29197,j_steven_brackett,,1377.153,1383.917,Then that it would my contention that would accumulate until the conclusion in the bankruptcy and that may be dispersed.
1978.77-1410,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1383.917,1388.53,That doesn't sound like but you ask for here.
1978.77-1410,0,29197,j_steven_brackett,,1396.843,1415.138,"No sir, as I stated to the Court in trying to recite to facts in this case what brought about this request for receiver was the fact that the bankrupt debtor in possession was not able from the cash flow to keep the mortgage payments current."
1978.77-1410,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1415.138,1417.736,I understand that.
1978.77-1410,0,29197,j_steven_brackett,,1425.596,1428.119,"No sir, that's another significant fact."
1978.77-1410,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1438.424,1444.977,"But after straight bankruptcy occurred, you could have asked that their property be abandoned to you and I guess you did?"
1978.77-1410,0,29197,j_steven_brackett,,1444.977,1446.892,Yes sir we did.
1978.77-1410,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1448.124,1453.758,But until you did that you did nothing else in order to try to get the rents?
1978.77-1410,0,29197,j_steven_brackett,,1453.758,1454.849,"Yeah, sir we did."
1978.77-1410,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1485.203,1491.386,I know but and the Judge said well and what happened was it was put into straight bankruptcy?
1978.77-1410,0,29197,j_steven_brackett,,1491.386,1492.526,"Yes, sir."
1978.77-1410,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1492.526,1499.315,"And what does a secured creditor if he doesn't want to file a security claim and proceed, what do they usually do?"
1978.77-1410,0,29197,j_steven_brackett,,1499.315,1499.909,In this case --
1978.77-1410,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1499.909,1501.892,In straight bankruptcy?
1978.77-1410,0,29197,j_steven_brackett,,1501.892,1509.104,"In this case if there is no equity in the property for the general creditors or beyond his own, he ask that the property be abandoned."
1978.77-1410,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1509.104,1510.365,And did you?
1978.77-1410,0,29197,j_steven_brackett,,1510.365,1510.704,Yes sir.
1978.77-1410,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1540.212,1551.926,What are the priority -- what are comparable priorities between cost of administration and rents in a situation like that?
1978.77-1410,0,29197,j_steven_brackett,,1551.926,1567.224,We contend that where you have a -- where there is a secured creditor who didn't realize the full extent of his debt that the priorities for the rents generated by the real estate lies with the secured creditor on the deficiency of his debt.
1978.77-1410,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1567.224,1575.642,"So the bankruptcy judge is not entitled to say there is not enough to pay the cost of administration, so I won't abandon the property for that reason?"
1978.77-1410,0,29197,j_steven_brackett,,1575.642,1580.222,In my opinion that was a gross abuse of discretion on the part of bankruptcy judge.
1978.77-1410,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1596.559,1598.788,"Well, it wouldn't be the first time a bankruptcy judge had done that?"
1978.77-1410,0,29197,j_steven_brackett,,1598.788,1621.328,"No, sir he would not, he would not and it is particularly significant that the fact of the bankruptcy court had approved and confirmed the sale of a tremendous amount of retail sales inventory without taxing that property and the funds derived from that property with any cost of the administration."
1978.77-1410,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1625.672,1635.398,"Well, that the Court of Appeals, I gather that Court of Appeals thought that you had not then whatever is that North Carolina law should do?"
1978.77-1410,0,29197,j_steven_brackett,,1635.398,1637.31,Yes sir.
1978.77-1410,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1637.31,1641.009,And are you asking us to disagree with the Court of Appeals as to what North Carolina law is?
1978.77-1410,0,29197,j_steven_brackett,,1641.009,1642.165,Yes sir.
1978.77-1410,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1659.505,1663.008,"Well, then you are saying that the Court of Appeals made a mistake as to North Carolina law?"
1978.77-1410,0,29197,j_steven_brackett,,1663.008,1665.256,I think there was a misapprehension of law in North Carolina.
1978.77-1410,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1665.256,1672.818,"Are you – three North Carolina judges on the Court of Appeals panel you have the opinion, District Courts of North Carolina the back yet."
1978.77-1410,0,29197,j_steven_brackett,,1672.818,1674.42,Yes sir.
1978.77-1410,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1723.566,1727.258,Very well.
1978.77-1410,1,16796,allan_a_ryan,,1732.047,1736.391,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1978.77-1410,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2069.587,2073.762,"Mr. Ryan, why isn't that happened here?"
1978.77-1410,1,16796,allan_a_ryan,,2089.105,2099.224,In this case no Mr. Justice Steven it does not and the reason it does not is because that request was made during the arrangement proceedings of the case.
1978.77-1410,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2202.955,2222.601,"Supposing instead of there being a Chapter XI arrangement before the bankruptcy there had been a state code receivership and pursuant to a petition by the second mortgagee a state court had entered an order verbatim the same as the one 204 A, would that not have entitled to second mortgagee to the rents for --"
1978.77-1410,1,16796,allan_a_ryan,,2222.601,2238.579,"I would answer that question by saying that it would depend on what the effect of a adjudication of bankruptcy is on a state court receivership, if as I think it would terminate that receivership then the result would be exactly the same and my argument would be exactly the same."
1978.77-1410,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2239.271,2249.322,"Even if as a matter of State Law up to the time of adjudication of bankruptcy the ownership of the rents had been in the second mortgagee, it would retroactively extinguish it?"
1978.77-1410,1,16796,allan_a_ryan,,2249.322,2251.212,"No, it would not retroactively extinguish it."
1978.77-1410,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2262.48,2262.721,Oh!
1978.77-1410,1,16796,allan_a_ryan,,2263.835,2267.459,"The second mortgagee, the petitioner received all these rents during that period of time."
1978.77-1410,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2287.546,2287.677,Oh!
1978.77-1410,1,16796,allan_a_ryan,,2293.65,2294.756,Yes sir.
1978.77-1410,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2294.756,2298.717,And that order was complied with and you have a new ball game at the time of the adjudication.
1978.77-1410,1,16796,allan_a_ryan,,2298.717,2299.293,Absolutely.
1978.77-1410,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2299.293,2305.494,"And I am sorry, you can go ahead."
1978.77-1410,1,16796,allan_a_ryan,,2305.494,2313.082,There are two things I think that the petitioner could have done in the bankruptcy court which we think that he should have done.
1978.77-1410,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2406.855,2414.819,Mr. Ryan what about the provision in the mortgage that the mortgagee will have benefit of the rents?
1978.77-1410,1,16796,allan_a_ryan,,2414.819,2415.781,There was no such provision.
1978.77-1410,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2415.781,2417.133,"I know, what if there is?"
1978.77-1410,1,16796,allan_a_ryan,,2417.133,2422.958,If there is that question as to whether he is in fact entitled to them would be decided under state law.
1978.77-1410,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2423.077,2431.029,"Well, suppose it's valid under the state law then automatically in bankruptcy the secured creditors gets the benefits of the rents?"
1978.77-1410,1,16796,allan_a_ryan,,2431.029,2440.073,If it is a clause that is valid under State Law then I would think that absence some supervening reason for order whatever that it would be enforced in the bankruptcy court.
1978.77-1410,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2440.073,2444.247,So that this whole argument is settled by careful drafting?
1978.77-1410,1,16796,allan_a_ryan,,2444.247,2445.795,Well it may be and that certainly is the --
1978.77-1410,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2445.795,2448.307,"Well, may be, I wonder what's your government position is?"
1978.77-1410,1,16796,allan_a_ryan,,2448.307,2451.268,"Well, the government's position is that it would have to be determined under state law."
1978.77-1410,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2464.171,2469.748,Does it make some difference whether that effort is made before or after bankruptcy proceedings are commenced?
1978.77-1410,1,16796,allan_a_ryan,,2469.748,2473.171,I think it has be made in the -- when the mortgage is drafted.
1978.77-1410,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2474.522,2477.442,You are exercising from that power.
1978.77-1410,1,16796,allan_a_ryan,,2494.214,2506.49,"I would think that, that if the claim is made after bankruptcy begins that the Bankruptcy Court would have to give effect to that insofar as the state law would."
1978.77-1410,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2506.49,2513.972,"You wouldn't say that in a Chapter XI proceeding, not in straight bankruptcy?"
1978.77-1410,1,16796,allan_a_ryan,,2513.972,2517.727,I would not say it in the Chapter XI.
1978.77-1410,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2641.337,2643.285,Mr. Cagle?
1978.77-1410,2,29422,joe_n_cagle,,2643.285,2646.279,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1978.77-1410,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2922.589,2925.877,"But he cannot move directly in the North Carolina courts, can he?"
1978.77-1410,2,29422,joe_n_cagle,,2925.877,2926.655,No sir.
1978.77-1410,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2926.655,2934.142,He must go to -- in addition to North Carolina law then he must get permission of the bankruptcy court?
1978.77-1410,2,29422,joe_n_cagle,,2934.142,2934.778,"Yes sir, but --"
1978.77-1410,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2934.778,2939.135,And it may be quite a while until he can get it?
1978.77-1410,2,29422,joe_n_cagle,,2939.135,2939.533,Not necessarily sir.
1978.77-1410,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2939.533,2941.045,"Well, it's an adversary proceeding."
1978.77-1410,2,29422,joe_n_cagle,,2941.045,2943.059,It's an adversary proceeding which --
1978.77-1410,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2943.059,2945.024,And meanwhile what happens to the rents?
1978.77-1410,2,29422,joe_n_cagle,,2945.024,2947.443,"Well, they should not take over 30 days."
1978.77-1410,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2947.443,2950.563,"Well, but what happens to the rents meanwhile?"
1978.77-1410,2,29422,joe_n_cagle,,2950.563,2952.702,It's being held in abeyance.
1978.77-1410,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2952.702,2954.303,"Well, can it be spent --"
1978.77-1410,2,29422,joe_n_cagle,,2954.303,2955.864,No sir.
1978.77-1410,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2955.864,2959.501,-- for administration expenses?
1978.77-1410,2,29422,joe_n_cagle,,2959.501,2962.581,Only upon order of the bankruptcy court.
1978.77-1410,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2963.694,2966.079,"You argue a [Voice Overlap], is it?"
1978.77-1410,2,29422,joe_n_cagle,,2966.079,2968.895,No sir.
1978.77-1410,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2970.424,2980.374,"So, what if there is an adversary proceeding and one side or the other wins and the other looses, then there is an appeal."
1978.77-1410,2,29422,joe_n_cagle,,2996.565,2997.344,If understand your question --
1978.77-1410,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2997.344,2999.292,And because I need protection meanwhile?
1978.77-1410,2,29422,joe_n_cagle,,2999.292,3011.178,As a practical matter I have not seen any case where about the bankruptcy judge did not allow a mortgagee to recover the property from the bankruptcy jurisdiction.
1978.77-1410,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3011.178,3014.286,But here there was a petition for abandonment that was denied?
1978.77-1410,2,29422,joe_n_cagle,,3014.286,3019.268,"I disagree that there was a petition for abandonment, Your Honor."
1978.77-1410,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3032.091,3039.231,No my only question to you was with response to your statement that you had never seen a bankruptcy court turn down a petition for abandonment?
1978.77-1410,2,29422,joe_n_cagle,,3039.231,3041.816,"No, no, no we are talking about scheme, Your Honor."
1978.77-1410,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3053.618,3061.407,"Well, if there is a big equity in the property wouldn't you suppose the bankruptcy court would deny the right to foreclose."
1978.77-1410,2,29422,joe_n_cagle,,3061.407,3078.995,"Which is possible, which is interesting because the facts and figures of this case before the bankruptcy judge indicated that there was a huge equity above and beyond the debt of the second mortgage."
1978.77-1410,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3087.205,3096.609,"Abandonment would have meant there wasn't sufficient to equity over and above the security to make it worthwhile for the bankruptcy court to hang on to it, wouldn't it?"
1978.77-1410,2,29422,joe_n_cagle,,3096.609,3107.983,The abandonment would have required notice to all creditors just like an adversary proceeding before the court would have done that and there was no petition for abandonment filed and then --
1978.77-1410,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3107.983,3113.744,"Mr. Cagle, how could you say that the record show there was a huge equity in the property at the time of the sale."
1978.77-1410,2,29422,joe_n_cagle,,3120.57,3121.566,At the time of the sale.
1978.77-1410,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3121.566,3126.211,There was then nothing in the record to indicate that there was a substantial equity in the property over and above.
1978.77-1410,2,29422,joe_n_cagle,,3126.211,3128.26,No that was sub --
1978.77-1410,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3128.26,3131.594,But then we have to look at it at the time of the sale?
1978.77-1410,2,29422,joe_n_cagle,,3131.594,3136.713,"Well, I don't think so because you are looking at it in hindsight there."
1978.77-1410,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3139.251,3146.613,"So you are looking at it as the benefit of hindsight when you say that later on, it turned out that the property increased in value and the petitioner made a profit out of it."
1978.77-1410,2,29422,joe_n_cagle,,3146.613,3161.504,"I was saying that the equity was there but reason the appraisals in December of 1974, just a few weeks before it adjudicated in February 75."
1978.77-1410,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3161.504,3169.287,"He had a lien, a second mortgage lien for about three hundred and some thousand dollars and he bought the property for 170 or something like that, didn't he?"
1978.77-1410,2,29422,joe_n_cagle,,3169.287,3181.959,At the second sale it was -- obviously district court had an order allowing the second mortgagees to use their -- the amount of their second mortgage to bid at the sale.
1978.77-1410,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3181.959,3183.507,And they didn't have to use it all?
1978.77-1410,2,29422,joe_n_cagle,,3183.507,3202.33,"That's correct, that's or put it down for the sale, may it please the Court, but the time that the petitioner already requested the court at the first meeting of creditors in April 1975 to abandon the property to him."
1978.77-1410,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3226.529,3229.546,Tell me one of the thing about the abandonment because I just really didn't understand.
1978.77-1410,2,29422,joe_n_cagle,,3236.678,3240.362,They would have to still had to go ahead and just --
1978.77-1410,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3240.362,3242.101,I don't understand that what would have happened if there has been an abandonment?
1978.77-1410,2,29422,joe_n_cagle,,3242.101,3265.132,"Okay, the first mortgagees and/or the second mortgagees, one or the other of the several would have had to file an adversary proceeding to get permission from the bankruptcy court, an order removing the jurisdiction of bankruptcy court from the property, that is to get relief from the stay in bankruptcy so that they could foreclose under state law."
1978.77-1410,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3265.132,3274.433,"What I am trying to find out is had been there abandonment at that time, what would be the effect of the abandonment have been on the second mortgage indebtedness?"
1978.77-1410,2,29422,joe_n_cagle,,3274.433,3278.485,I don't see that there will be any effect.
1978.77-1410,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3278.485,3285.465,"You mean he would have taken over the property, he would become the owner of the property and still retained this entire $360,000 claim?"
1978.77-1410,2,29422,joe_n_cagle,,3285.465,3295.19,If the court -- if they had abandoned the property the first mortgagees would have foreclosed under state law of --
1978.77-1410,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3295.19,3298.535,Was there any provision in the mortgage at all with respect to rents?
1978.77-1410,2,29422,joe_n_cagle,,3298.535,3300.213,"No sir, none."
1978.77-1410,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3300.213,3301.46,Had there been an assignment?
1978.77-1410,2,29422,joe_n_cagle,,3301.46,3302.185,No sir.
1978.77-1410,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3302.185,3305.846,"Had there been an assignment, what would their situation have been?"
1978.77-1410,2,29422,joe_n_cagle,,3305.846,3307.615,No sir.
1978.77-1410,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3307.615,3312.331,Assuming that the mortgage contained an assignment of rents --
1978.77-1410,2,29422,joe_n_cagle,,3312.331,3318.1,He would still would have had to foreclose to perfect that lien.
1978.77-1410,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3339.734,3342.546,And that he cannot do because of the bankruptcy?
1978.77-1410,2,29422,joe_n_cagle,,3342.546,3349.311,But our possession Your Honor please is that he can under the adversary proceedings which he did not utilize.
1978.77-1410,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3349.311,3364.684,"Are you sure -- in Chapter XI though the notion is to pay the debts you go along and but at the same time, Chapter XI isn't supposed to be able to hold off secured creditors unless you pay them, is it?"
1978.77-1410,2,29422,joe_n_cagle,,3381.758,3387.519,Simply an order not to foreclose that was superfluous because the Bankruptcy Act says that he can't foreclose.
1978.77-1410,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3388.724,3392.572,"Exactly, I know there is an automatic stay in Chapter XI case?"
1978.77-1410,2,29422,joe_n_cagle,,3392.572,3399.397,"Alright, even during the arrangement people go in, creditors go in and file an action under --"
1978.77-1410,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3399.397,3401.916,But the plan is scuttled completely if the --
1978.77-1410,2,29422,joe_n_cagle,,3401.916,3402.309,That's correct.
1978.77-1410,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3402.309,3405.845,-- if the property is abandoned.
1978.77-1410,2,29422,joe_n_cagle,,3408.204,3413.247,Well there is no abandonment during the arrangement period.
1978.77-1410,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3525.893,3526.764,Do you have anything further?
1978.77-1410,3,29197,j_steven_brackett,,3526.764,3530.143,"Your Honor, if I could have just few more moments I want to address my self to --"
1978.77-1410,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3530.143,3531.584,You have 2 minutes.
1978.77-1410,3,29197,j_steven_brackett,,3531.584,3533.442,"Two more minutes, yes sir."
1978.77-1410,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3633.79,3635.253,Do that very briefly your time is expiring.
1978.77-1410,3,29197,j_steven_brackett,,3635.253,3637.49,"Yes sir, pardon me Your Honor."
1978.77-1410,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3644.978,3646.892,Can I take five seconds to ask you one question?
1978.77-1410,3,29197,j_steven_brackett,,3646.892,3647.289,Yes sir.
1978.77-1410,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3647.289,3652.681,If there has been abandonment what would that have done to the second mortgage indebtedness when you requested it?
1978.77-1410,3,29197,j_steven_brackett,,3652.681,3654.806,I think that it would have extinguished the second mortgage.
1978.77-1410,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3654.806,3655.552,Entirely?
1978.77-1410,3,29197,j_steven_brackett,,3655.552,3656.022,Yes sir.
1978.77-1410,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3656.022,3657.412,Thank you.
1978.77-1410,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3657.412,3658.07,Thank you gentleman.
