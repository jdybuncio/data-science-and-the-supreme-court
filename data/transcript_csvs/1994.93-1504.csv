1994.93-1504,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.856,"We'll hear argument this morning in Number 93-1504, the Celotex Corporation v. Bennie Edwards."
1994.93-1504,0,33528,jeffrey_w_warren,,10.372,12.891,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1994.93-1504,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,162.337,172.276,"Mr. Warren, would you explain how the proceeding on the bond will affect the bankruptcy estate?"
1994.93-1504,0,33528,jeffrey_w_warren,,183.501,193.356,"Justice O'Connor, the way it affects the estate is that Celotex has a contractual relationship with Northbrook that was entered into as part of the posting of the supersedeas bond."
1994.93-1504,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,213.853,219.757,So what was pledged are funds that otherwise would be in the general bankruptcy estate.
1994.93-1504,0,33528,jeffrey_w_warren,,219.757,220.459,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1994.93-1504,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,236.452,244.939,"Mr. Warren, the estate would get back that property pledged, I assume, only if there's some invalidity in the pledge, is that--"
1994.93-1504,0,33528,jeffrey_w_warren,,244.939,246.658,"--That is absolutely correct, Justice Scalia."
1994.93-1504,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,246.658,250.093,--Is there thought to be some invalidity in it?
1994.93-1504,0,33528,jeffrey_w_warren,,250.093,250.76,"Yes, Your Honor."
1994.93-1504,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,293.972,303.061,Those claims seeking to bring back those... the judgment has already been rendered with regard to those claims.
1994.93-1504,0,33528,jeffrey_w_warren,,303.061,317.82,"--That's correct, but it is a judgment for punitive awards which under normal bankruptcy practice would not be recoverable in lieu of the ability to compensate regular compensatory awards."
1994.93-1504,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,349.84,355.826,"Mr. Warren, didn't you say what was infected was the collateral, not the judgment itself?"
1994.93-1504,0,33528,jeffrey_w_warren,,355.826,356.611,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1994.93-1504,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,356.611,366.883,So what would be the basis for setting aside the transfer from Celotex to Northbrook to secure the appeal bonds?
1994.93-1504,0,33528,jeffrey_w_warren,,366.883,373.454,"Under the bankruptcy code, the transfer by Celotex to Northbrook was for the indirect benefit of the Edwardses."
1994.93-1504,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,385.845,393.266,"Are you attacking those as preferences, or fraudulent, or... what's the basis for attacking that transfer?"
1994.93-1504,0,33528,jeffrey_w_warren,,393.266,399.919,"--Within the group of bonds there are preferences, there are fraudulent transfers."
1994.93-1504,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,418.316,420.0,Why is it for the indirect benefit of the Edwardses?
1994.93-1504,0,33528,jeffrey_w_warren,,424.202,425.335,"That's correct, Your Honor, but--"
1994.93-1504,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,425.335,426.57,--and the money would have been gone.
1994.93-1504,0,33528,jeffrey_w_warren,,432.474,445.281,"--That is the issue, because the... in order to avoid the transfer, Celotex must establish insolvency at the time of the transfer, or insolvency as a result of the transfer, and a lack of reasonably equivalent value in exchange for the transfer."
1994.93-1504,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,474.151,490.846,"I'm not concerned with the insolvent status, I give you that, but what conceivable basis is there for arguing that it was not for the benefit of Celotex, which is a necessary condition to say that, you know, that somehow this thing could be called back?"
1994.93-1504,0,33528,jeffrey_w_warren,,490.846,497.0,"--Well, that would be the defense that is being raised to the fraudulent conveyance claim."
1994.93-1504,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,524.28,524.613,"Well, please help me."
1994.93-1504,0,33528,jeffrey_w_warren,,533.884,537.688,"Yes, during... absent the posting of the supersedeas bond."
1994.93-1504,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,537.688,538.204,Absent the posting of the bond.
1994.93-1504,0,33528,jeffrey_w_warren,,538.204,556.565,"And Your Honor, the issue that is being litigated now is whether the forbearance that is affected by the supersedeas bond is sufficient consideration to meet the reasonably equivalent consideration test in order to... in order to avoid a constructively fraudulent transfer."
1994.93-1504,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,556.565,560.867,"Mr. Warren, could you help me just with this one very preliminary question?"
1994.93-1504,0,33528,jeffrey_w_warren,,569.957,571.109,"Your Honor, that's absolutely correct."
1994.93-1504,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,582.517,584.919,"It seems to me the thrust of your argument is we shouldn't be deciding that, either."
1994.93-1504,0,33528,jeffrey_w_warren,,584.919,585.935,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1994.93-1504,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,604.963,613.669,"Your position is that if the Edwardses thought the bankruptcy court was wrong, they should appeal to the eleventh... the district court in the Eleventh Circuit, not take it up in the Fifth Circuit."
1994.93-1504,0,33528,jeffrey_w_warren,,613.669,614.286,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1994.93-1504,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,623.358,629.427,"On that point, I want to ask, was Northbrook subject to the stay order?"
1994.93-1504,0,33528,jeffrey_w_warren,,631.027,631.861,"Yes, Your Honor."
1994.93-1504,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,631.861,633.527,--Specifically?
1994.93-1504,0,33528,jeffrey_w_warren,,633.527,641.3,"Well, in the mass tort context with 100,000 the stay order doesn't name anybody specifically."
1994.93-1504,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,701.005,714.229,"So it comes down to which is the proper circuit, ultimately, to resolve this legal question of whether the appeal bond can be thrown back for the benefit of all the creditors."
1994.93-1504,0,33528,jeffrey_w_warren,,721.3,722.001,"Yes, Your Honor."
1994.93-1504,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,741.813,756.973,And would that bar another circuit from reexamining this order if there were... because there's colorable jurisdiction to issue it?
1994.93-1504,0,33528,jeffrey_w_warren,,771.065,771.934,"No, Your Honor."
1994.93-1504,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,784.742,792.681,"So is your position here that there is no patent defect, that there is at least colorable jurisdiction, and that that's the end of the matter?"
1994.93-1504,0,33528,jeffrey_w_warren,,792.681,811.393,"That's correct, Your Honor, although I think that it has... I think it's appropriate that the court that issued... I think it's good public policy that the court that issues an injunction, that has colorable jurisdiction to enter that injunction, should... you know, a party should respect and obey that injunction."
1994.93-1504,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,811.393,824.216,"Mr. Warren, at this point, mustn't we decide more than colorable, because at least in the forum where the appeal bond was lodged, that's a mechanical procedure, ordinarily."
1994.93-1504,0,33528,jeffrey_w_warren,,856.77,864.007,"I agree with that, Your Honor, that either the bankruptcy court had subject matter jurisdiction, or the bankruptcy court did not have subject matter jurisdiction."
1994.93-1504,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,864.007,866.293,And you're relying on 105 for that?
1994.93-1504,0,33528,jeffrey_w_warren,,866.293,871.697,"No, Your Honor, we rely on 1334(b) for the subject matter jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court."
1994.93-1504,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,871.697,881.386,"So we have to make a detailed inquiry, or the Fifth Circuit is entitled to make a detailed inquiry, into the jurisdiction under 1334?"
1994.93-1504,0,33528,jeffrey_w_warren,,881.386,896.745,"Your Honor, I think that they were entitled to look at the jurisdiction that was asserted by the bankruptcy court, and finding that jurisdiction exists in the bankruptcy court, then they should have deferred to the stay that was entered by that court unless and until it was modified on direct appeal."
1994.93-1504,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,896.745,906.767,"So you're saying that jurisdiction existed if there was a colorable claim that the property could come into the estate, and this is where I find I have difficulty."
1994.93-1504,0,33528,jeffrey_w_warren,,914.171,915.623,"Your Honor, it's more than just property--"
1994.93-1504,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,915.623,932.668,"You're saying that even without... without any assertion of facts that would somehow demonstrate that there's a real possibility that the property could be included within the bankruptcy estate, even without that, it is still related to--"
1994.93-1504,0,33528,jeffrey_w_warren,,932.668,933.251,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1994.93-1504,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,954.165,955.784,"--It doesn't say, might be related to."
1994.93-1504,0,33528,jeffrey_w_warren,,957.167,957.5,That's--
1994.93-1504,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,957.5,966.072,Isn't it reasonable to interpret that to mean that there must be some facts that would give rise to a colorable claim that the money can be recovered by the bankrupt estate?
1994.93-1504,0,33528,jeffrey_w_warren,,966.072,967.674,"--Absolutely, Your Honor, but--"
1994.93-1504,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,967.674,969.041,And what are they here?
1994.93-1504,0,33528,jeffrey_w_warren,,969.041,975.845,"--Well, the facts are that the transfers made by the Celotex Corporation were made at a time when it was insolvent."
1994.93-1504,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,986.903,993.223,"Mr. Warren, I don't understand why that claim would be affected one way or another by whether the bonding company pays out on the bond."
1994.93-1504,0,33528,jeffrey_w_warren,,993.223,995.159,Once... well--
1994.93-1504,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,995.159,996.542,Isn't... I guess I have the same question.
1994.93-1504,0,33528,jeffrey_w_warren,,1010.184,1019.623,"--Absolutely, Your Honor, because it protects the reorganization process, and that is precisely why the collateral attack by the Fifth Circuit should not be condoned."
1994.93-1504,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1019.623,1019.873,So that the only--
1994.93-1504,0,33528,jeffrey_w_warren,,1045.771,1048.021,That's correct.
1994.93-1504,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1048.021,1064.916,"Now, if the respondents had just executed on their judgment, that would not have been anything that would be covered by the stay, I take it, of the bankruptcy court?"
1994.93-1504,0,33528,jeffrey_w_warren,,1064.916,1092.983,"Well, Your Honor, in order for the... in order for the respondents after the bankruptcy was in place to have executed against Northbrook, they would have had to have asserted some procedure to comply with due process, and Rule 65.1 provides that expedited summary-type procedure, and what the Edwardses sought here was permission from the district court to pursue their remedies against Northbrook, and of course that--"
1994.93-1504,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1092.983,1098.018,"Well, what would have been the situation had there been no supersedeas bond?"
1994.93-1504,0,33528,jeffrey_w_warren,,1098.018,1107.291,"--Had there been no supersedeas bond, then the bankruptcy would have implemented a stay that would have precluded the Edwardses as all other creditors--"
1994.93-1504,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1107.291,1110.176,Would have precluded any execution of the judgment.
1994.93-1504,0,33528,jeffrey_w_warren,,1110.176,1110.778,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1994.93-1504,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1110.778,1112.061,But the bond was put up--
1994.93-1504,0,33528,jeffrey_w_warren,,1113.646,1114.162,That's correct.
1994.93-1504,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1114.162,1130.989,"The bond was then obtained prior to the filing of bankruptcy, to enable the respondents to go ahead and... and obtain their money on the basis of the supersedeas bond."
1994.93-1504,0,33528,jeffrey_w_warren,,1130.989,1132.358,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1994.93-1504,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1147.284,1159.841,"Now, do you say the test for whether it is related to the bankruptcy proceeding is the test employed by the Third Circuit in Pacor v. Higgins?"
1994.93-1504,0,33528,jeffrey_w_warren,,1159.841,1161.641,"Yes, Your Honor, whether it could have any conceivable--"
1994.93-1504,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1161.641,1167.781,"Do all the courts of appeal apply that same test, or is there some diversity--"
1994.93-1504,0,33528,jeffrey_w_warren,,1167.781,1168.297,--Your Honor--
1994.93-1504,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1168.297,1169.014,--among the circuits?
1994.93-1504,0,33528,jeffrey_w_warren,,1169.014,1192.33,"--to the best of my knowledge, there's almost uniform following of that particular test, and you know, some circuits have adopted slightly different language, but all of them have recognized that if there could be any conceivable effect on the property of the debtor's estate or on the allocation of property among creditors, then there is related-to jurisdiction."
1994.93-1504,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1192.33,1203.97,And the only conceivable effect here is if Celotex can establish that its transfer of the collateral to Northbrook was a fraudulent transfer?
1994.93-1504,0,33528,jeffrey_w_warren,,1203.97,1204.904,That would be one.
1994.93-1504,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1228.07,1231.938,"How did the Edwardses get away from this, then?"
1994.93-1504,0,33528,jeffrey_w_warren,,1242.245,1247.983,"--Well, there is a limit to the avoiding powers that a debtor in possession will be able to exercise."
1994.93-1504,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1255.303,1277.502,"Mr. Warren, if the automatic stay in bankruptcy didn't occur until after that judgment was rendered, and is there any precedent for saying when somebody has a good judgment, and the judgment is paid before the bankruptcy petition is filed, but yet the bankruptcy estate can go back and get that court judgment, can set aside that court judgment?"
1994.93-1504,0,33528,jeffrey_w_warren,,1277.835,1286.255,"From a fraudulent transfer standpoint, no, Your Honor, because there would be a satisfaction of the judgment that would have occurred prior to the filing of the bankruptcy petition."
1994.93-1504,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1295.178,1298.096,--Preferential transfer that consists of a payment of a judgment?
1994.93-1504,0,33528,jeffrey_w_warren,,1303.048,1326.846,"As a preference, yes, Your Honor, because within the 90-day period, if the debtor is insolvent, if the payment effects a benefit to the judgment creditor on behalf of an antecedent debt, meaning that it has to be not a contemporaneous exchange of value, but for an antecedent debt, then the Bankruptcy Code does provide the remedy for purposes of bringing and recovering--"
1994.93-1504,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1326.846,1327.615,"Mr. Warren, let me ask you this hypothetical."
1994.93-1504,0,33528,jeffrey_w_warren,,1371.894,1374.846,"--I believe so, Your Honor, because if there is a reversionary interest--"
1994.93-1504,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1374.846,1379.898,"So related to just means, what, it means somehow the bankrupt's property is involved?"
1994.93-1504,0,33528,jeffrey_w_warren,,1379.898,1382.0,--Could have a conceivable effect.
1994.93-1504,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1382.0,1384.535,Conceivable regardless of reality?
1994.93-1504,0,33528,jeffrey_w_warren,,1386.754,1387.22,"No, Your Honor."
1994.93-1504,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1403.995,1405.947,"--Well, that's one reason it couldn't have any conceivable effect."
1994.93-1504,0,33528,jeffrey_w_warren,,1430.63,1439.819,"Even if you disagree with the merits of the remedies, or the available remedies, you know, courts should respect stays and injunctions entered by other courts."
1994.93-1504,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1439.819,1441.336,Unless it is patently frivolous.
1994.93-1504,0,33528,jeffrey_w_warren,,1441.336,1447.655,"Unless it's patently frivolous, unless there's no subject matter jurisdiction, or unless there's no personal jurisdiction, which are not issues in this case."
1994.93-1504,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1447.655,1454.411,"Well, why isn't it patently frivolous here if there is... was, indeed, equivalent value given for the posting of the security?"
1994.93-1504,0,33528,jeffrey_w_warren,,1454.411,1472.623,"That is the issue, because forbearance is not quantifiable, and the evidence in the bankruptcy court, again not in the record before the Fifth Circuit, is that the financial condition of Celotex was the same on the petition date as it was at the time of the transfer for the indirect benefit of the Edwardses."
1994.93-1504,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1472.623,1483.764,"And you're saying that that determination, or the determination of your position, simply cannot be made without a full trial on the merits, and therefore there's no opportunity to come under the frivolousness rule in this case."
1994.93-1504,0,33528,jeffrey_w_warren,,1483.764,1496.822,"That is correct, and the Fourth Circuit recognized this, so it would be hard to say that it was completely frivolous when the Fourth Circuit in Willis recognized the exact same Celotex, the exact same factual circumstance--"
1994.93-1504,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1496.822,1507.963,Does that position of yours turn in any respect on the fact that Northbrook was itself bound by the order of the bankruptcy court?
1994.93-1504,0,33528,jeffrey_w_warren,,1507.963,1508.38,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1994.93-1504,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1511.246,1517.819,"If Northbrook had not been caught in the middle, would your position be different?"
1994.93-1504,0,33528,jeffrey_w_warren,,1517.819,1519.402,"--Your Honor, I don't... I have a hard time--"
1994.93-1504,1,17985,brent_m_rosenthal,,1609.329,1611.779,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1994.93-1504,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1640.198,1650.304,"Mr. Rosenthal, did you ever file a motion in the Florida Bankruptcy Court seeking relief from the injunction?"
1994.93-1504,1,17985,brent_m_rosenthal,,1650.304,1655.958,"I personally did on behalf of other clients, not on behalf of the Edwards."
1994.93-1504,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1663.813,1668.198,"Well, why didn't you follow that procedure on behalf of these respondents?"
1994.93-1504,1,17985,brent_m_rosenthal,,1668.198,1680.906,"--Because it was our opinion, Your Honor, that the bankruptcy court had patently no jurisdiction to enjoin proceedings that did not involve the debtor at all, and that were not directed against the debtor, or against the debtor's property."
1994.93-1504,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1680.906,1686.608,Did it have no jurisdiction to do that as to Northbrook?
1994.93-1504,1,17985,brent_m_rosenthal,,1686.608,1690.012,"It had no jurisdiction to do that as to Northbrook, yes, Your Honor."
1994.93-1504,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1690.012,1706.437,"Do you deny, Mr. Rosenthal, that the claim that your opponent has made that if, in fact, the Edwardses realize on the bond, the bonding company is going to go against the collateral, the collateral is going to affect the value of the bankruptcy estate."
1994.93-1504,1,17985,brent_m_rosenthal,,1711.258,1725.185,"I... I can't dispute the fact that the bond has been collateralized, but I do believe that at the time of the affirmance of the judgment Celotex lost whatever interest it had in the bond itself."
1994.93-1504,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1725.185,1728.403,"Well, but that's not the argument."
1994.93-1504,1,17985,brent_m_rosenthal,,1744.312,1746.348,"I do disagree with that assertion, Your Honor."
1994.93-1504,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1746.348,1749.716,"Well, why do you... what's the misstep?"
1994.93-1504,1,17985,brent_m_rosenthal,,1753.852,1754.302,Yes.
1994.93-1504,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1754.302,1756.104,--and the collateral is in the bankruptcy estate.
1994.93-1504,1,17985,brent_m_rosenthal,,1756.104,1756.57,Right.
1994.93-1504,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1756.57,1756.92,Okay.
1994.93-1504,1,17985,brent_m_rosenthal,,1758.156,1759.689,We're not seeking the collateral.
1994.93-1504,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1764.476,1766.512,"Well, he isn't claiming that you are seeking the collateral."
1994.93-1504,1,17985,brent_m_rosenthal,,1791.127,1801.935,"Well, that's all that's necessary for jurisdiction under the Pacor test, which says any proceeding whose outcome could conceivably affect the bankruptcy estate is--"
1994.93-1504,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1801.935,1808.939,"Well, this is more than... you're quite right about your statement of the test, but isn't this a little bit stronger than merely conceivable?"
1994.93-1504,1,17985,brent_m_rosenthal,,1808.939,1809.439,"--Well, I think the--"
1994.93-1504,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1809.439,1813.724,"If you go against the collateral, the collateral isn't going to be there, and they have priority."
1994.93-1504,1,17985,brent_m_rosenthal,,1816.693,1818.545,"--Well, that's up to Northbrook, Your Honor."
1994.93-1504,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1822.247,1825.531,"Well, presumably Northbrook is not going to open its veins and bleed to death."
1994.93-1504,1,17985,brent_m_rosenthal,,1830.435,1831.785,--As between us--
1994.93-1504,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1831.785,1833.387,"There's nothing frivolous about that assumption, is there?"
1994.93-1504,1,17985,brent_m_rosenthal,,1833.387,1843.743,"--No, there's no, but as between us bleeding to death and Northbrook bleeding to death, I think the bond, the obligation that Northbrook entered into to us, puts Northbrook in the shoes of bleeding--"
1994.93-1504,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1843.743,1851.349,"Well, that may be a good argument in front of the court that decides what should be done, as to whether there should be an injunction or not, but I don't see that that goes to jurisdiction."
1994.93-1504,1,17985,brent_m_rosenthal,,1858.385,1873.262,"--Well, my argument is that there is a limit on that... on the relationship, on the degree to which a bankruptcy court can exercise jurisdiction over proceedings which are tangentially related to a bankruptcy."
1994.93-1504,2,33528,jeffrey_w_warren,,3276.652,3280.27,"As this Court has recognized, bankruptcies do strange things."
1994.93-1504,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3301.483,3303.067,It hasn't preserved the status quo.
1994.93-1504,2,33528,jeffrey_w_warren,,3321.362,3351.214,"--Well, Your Honor, it maintains the status quo in the sense that the funds are still available, the obligation of Northbrook as a surety is still available, the right and entitlements and the avoidance powers as they exist are still available with respect to the estate, and the passage of time that has occurred, the bankruptcy court has provided adequate protection to ensure that segregated funds exist for the benefit of any impairment that occurs as a result of the delays."
1994.93-1504,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3351.214,3353.25,And the collateral has not gone.
1994.93-1504,2,33528,jeffrey_w_warren,,3353.25,3360.154,"And the collateral has not gone, because the bankruptcy court has ordered the sureties to deposit those funds, so consequently, we have issues--"
1994.93-1504,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3360.154,3362.939,It is gone unless there's some colorable basis for getting it back.
1994.93-1504,2,33528,jeffrey_w_warren,,3362.939,3397.529,"--That is correct, Your Honor, and there's two colorable bases that are being litigated now that exist, the constructively fraudulent transfer, which is a 4-year statute of limitations under Florida law, which has been established as being the law controlling this transfer, so it's within the statute of limitations, no question that Celotex was insolvent at the time it transferred the assets to Northbrook, there's no question that the transfer was for the indirect benefit of the Edwardses, no question about that, the only issue is whether or not there was a reasonably equivalent exchange of value, meaning that the forbearance--"
1994.93-1504,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3397.529,3398.729,"Thank you, Mr. Warren--"
1994.93-1504,2,33528,jeffrey_w_warren,,3398.729,3399.329,"--Thank you, Your Honor."
1994.93-1504,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3399.329,3399.879,--your time has expired.
