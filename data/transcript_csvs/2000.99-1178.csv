2000.99-1178,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.33,"We'll hear argument now on number 99-1178, Solid Waste Agency of Northern Cook County versus United States Army Corps of Engineers."
2000.99-1178,0,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,11.685,56.484,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, by 1972 the terms navigable waters and waters of the United States had a settled meaning after a century during which congresses and this Court's conception of what those terms meant had expanded significantly from an initial strict view that the navigable waters were those navigable, in fact, to a recognition that they included in addition waters navigable with improvements and tributaries of those waters, to this Court's statement in the Union Electric case in 1965 that the only things excluded were intrastate nonnavigable waters that did not flow into the navigable waters."
2000.99-1178,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,78.755,101.732,"Mr. Bishop, the government says that the... while you may be correct about the perception of what the navigable waters of the United States consist of, that there was no practice of referring to that conception as waters of the United States."
2000.99-1178,0,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,103.305,104.956,"We do, Your Honor."
2000.99-1178,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,104.956,104.956,"--in the statutory text or in our opinions where that precise phrase that's used in the definition here, waters of the United States, is used?"
2000.99-1178,0,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,104.956,130.214,"Well, the traditional phrase that appears over and over again in the statutes and in the Court's opinions is navigable waters of the United States, but there are instances where those are broken up, and in effect the terms are used interchangeably."
2000.99-1178,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,185.266,191.515,Have we ever used the term waters of the states or has Congress ever used the term waters of the states?
2000.99-1178,0,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,196.394,205.017,"Yes, I think in that same footnote we cite a number of cases where the waters of the United States is used in contradistinction to the waters of the states."
2000.99-1178,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,212.386,222.568,"I can understand. I don't think... I can understand the position that says waters of the United States means the navigable waters, but that's not your position."
2000.99-1178,0,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,296.9,298.406,Just one question.
2000.99-1178,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,303.26,311.418,"Maybe you're even saying that some of the ones that go under the ground are within the statute, but others aren't."
2000.99-1178,0,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,311.418,318.338,"Some courts have held that groundwaters that are connected to the... that is, flow into the navigable waters of the United States, serve as a source."
2000.99-1178,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,318.338,324.474,"Or into the Fox River, isn't that right?"
2000.99-1178,0,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,324.474,326.597,There is no evidence of that.
2000.99-1178,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,326.597,347.538,"My question you see, is I can understand their interpretation, I can understand a narrow interpretation, but I don't understand what any human being would want to accomplish by writing your interpretation that would in fact exclude somewhere between 5 and 20 percent of the bodies of water in people's backyards."
2000.99-1178,0,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,347.538,371.795,"I think what the Congress had in mind in borrowing the common law and prior statutory meanings of these terms was that it did want to protect water, but it was also very cognizant of states' rights and retained rights under the 10th Amendment to regulate, and wanted to maintain limits on the scope of the jurisdiction."
2000.99-1178,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,371.795,378.953,"Mr. Bishop, is your position on this issue influenced in any respect by our decision in Riverside versus Bayview Homes?"
2000.99-1178,0,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,378.953,387.538,"Clearly I have to accommodate that position, and that is one that Congress addressed specifically as the Court noted in Riverside Bayview."
2000.99-1178,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,420.162,446.834,"Mr. Bishop, if that's so, then how do you explain Section 404(g) of the statute, which allows the states' governments to submit to the EPA a description of a program involving discharging into waters that are other than navigable or adjacent to navigable waters?"
2000.99-1178,0,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,446.834,458.43,It's clear that what that refers to are tributaries.
2000.99-1178,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,497.232,497.232,404(g) would not cover such--
2000.99-1178,0,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,498.822,497.232,It would not cover isolated waters.
2000.99-1178,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,513.188,521.782,"--And presumably, states can regulate, under your theory, these isolated waters that don't flow into navigable waters."
2000.99-1178,0,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,521.782,532.097,"That's right, Justice O'Connor, and the State of Alabama in its amicus brief set out a long appendix with state statutes."
2000.99-1178,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,554.974,565.51,"What about lakes or ponds, intrastate, that don't flow into navigable waters but which can support rowboats or small sailboats or something like that?"
2000.99-1178,0,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,565.51,590.868,"This Court's definition in Appalachian Electric of a navigable water included one that could be used by small noncommercial vessels on the theory that that indicated the potential of the water body to be used for commerce, and we are not objecting here to the Court's claim of jurisdiction over waters that are navigable in fact, even by small vessels."
2000.99-1178,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,608.343,617.9,I don't quite understand your position as to why if it's a small lake entirely within the boundaries of the state that you don't object to Federal jurisdiction there.
2000.99-1178,0,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,622.448,631.64,"Right, but we're not objecting... I mean, that is not our case, Justice Stevens, so I can't claim to... you know, I don't want to state a definitive position on this."
2000.99-1178,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,645.272,653.564,Would this case be different if the United States could prove that people used rowboats to go fishing in the pond that we're talking about here?
2000.99-1178,0,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,655.799,657.694,These ponds are very tiny and shallow.
2000.99-1178,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,660.473,661.826,How big is the pond we're talking about?
2000.99-1178,0,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,661.826,663.348,"Well, there are a number of ponds."
2000.99-1178,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,665.767,667.433,How big is the biggest one?
2000.99-1178,0,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,667.433,670.329,I think in the record they say several acres.
2000.99-1178,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,670.329,671.174,Several acres.
2000.99-1178,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1580.044,1589.667,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
2000.99-1178,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1662.906,1667.168,"I don't understand exactly what that means, Mr. Wallace."
2000.99-1178,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1667.168,1695.092,"Well, for example, in the act commonly known as RCRA, another environmental statute, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, a permit situation, a permit system is set up for the treatment, storage or disposal of hazardous waste, which occurs in privately owned land ordinarily, without any reference to waters whatsoever."
2000.99-1178,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1702.675,1702.675,You're saying there are a lot of laws like this one?
2000.99-1178,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1702.675,1734.842,"Well, I am saying there are many prohibitions on conduct that pollutes or endangers the natural resources of this country or the wildlife of this country that are enacted under the commerce power and that are not commonly thought of or thought of in the law as asserting a special Federal domain over the place where the conduct occurs."
2000.99-1178,2,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,3400.884,3408.043,"Justice O'Connor, the State of Illinois rejected our first permit application, made us reapply."
2000.99-1178,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3634.523,3636.714,"Thank you, Mr. Bishop."
2000.99-1178,2,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,3636.714,3637.545,"--Thank you, Chief Justice."
2000.99-1178,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3637.545,3638.956,The case is submitted.
