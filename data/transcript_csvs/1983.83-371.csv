1983.83-371,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,8.856,"We will hear arguments next in Federal Communications Commission against ITT World Communications, Incorporated."
1983.83-371,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,59.273,63.519,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1983.83-371,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,218.127,232.933,"May I raise a preliminary inquiry, I understand now from the reply brief that your office filed that the Telecommunications Committee has now been eliminated?"
1983.83-371,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,232.933,234.321,"It's been disbanded, that's correct."
1983.83-371,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,234.321,240.787,"And also, the number of Commissioners has been reduced from seven to five?"
1983.83-371,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,240.787,242.179,"From seven to five, right."
1983.83-371,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,242.179,248.27,Is there any question of movement now on the Sunshine Act issue?
1983.83-371,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,248.27,254.47,"I don't think there is, Justice O'Connor, because the FCC has scheduled additional conferences."
1983.83-371,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,259.672,263.716,At least three of the Commissioners plan to attend?
1983.83-371,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,263.716,266.512,"Well, that may depend on what the Court decides, who goes."
1983.83-371,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,316.991,325.27,"Do you say the district court would have had no jurisdiction, Mr. Lauber, even had the ITT not submitted the matter to the Commission?"
1983.83-371,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,325.27,328.565,"Well, I guess I have two answers to that."
1983.83-371,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,359.659,362.849,That's not quite the same thing as saying they have no jurisdiction.
1983.83-371,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,362.849,364.627,"--That's correct, that's absolutely correct."
1983.83-371,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,425.51,430.962,"Incidentally, Mr. Lauber, at whose instigation was the Dublin meeting closed?"
1983.83-371,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,432.615,451.844,"--I am informed that the way... these date back to 1974, and I understand at the close of every multinational session, as the last item on the agenda, the various foreign participants and the Americans would decide when to have the next meeting and what might usefully be discussed there."
1983.83-371,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,603.234,607.153,"So as to bind all seven, or a majority of seven, is that what you mean?"
1983.83-371,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,607.153,612.418,"Well, whatever the term ""authorization"" means, and I will now explain what we think it means."
1983.83-371,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,865.36,871.859,Is there any authority to hold meetings outside of the continental limits of the United States?
1983.83-371,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,875.903,879.198,"I'm not sure, Mr. Chief Justice."
1983.83-371,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,888.023,899.8,"It would be somewhat unusual, would it not, for a regulatory agency to hold meetings to take action in Dublin or Paris or Rome?"
1983.83-371,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,899.8,909.907,"I think it would be unusual, but I am not sure whether there is any express provision mandating that they hold meetings in the continental U.S. But we will try and find out before the reply."
1983.83-371,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,956.557,960.261,"Mr. Lauber, what does it mean when you use the term"
1983.83-371,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,966.29,980.894,"Well, I think that's what the Court of Appeals must have meant, that they were going on Government time; they were being invited because of who they were, i.e., Commissioners, not tourists or the like; and that they were there because they were Commissioners."
1983.83-371,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,989.699,992.042,"Well, what does it mean to be somewhere as a Commissioner?"
1983.83-371,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,992.042,1005.024,"--I guess it means to be somewhere and be able to speak with some authority about the Commission's interests and objectives, what it hopes to accomplish."
1983.83-371,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1014.099,1016.095,"Well then, why did you agree to it?"
1983.83-371,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,1016.095,1017.441,"Well, because we agreed--"
1983.83-371,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1017.441,1018.314,If you didn't know what it meant?
1983.83-371,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,1018.314,1021.219,"--that the whole... it wasn't down there, but--"
1983.83-371,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1056.112,1057.519,"And cut a deal with them, too."
1983.83-371,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,1058.673,1070.981,A fourth problem with the Court of Appeals' theory we think is that it will make it impossible to administer the Sunshine Act as Congress intended.
1983.83-371,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1095.079,1098.811,"Mr. Lauber, that's the question I really wanted to get at."
1983.83-371,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,1105.218,1125.597,"--Well, under the Sunshine Act it requires the agency to vote by a majority vote whether or not to close the meeting under one of the ten exceptions under the Sunshine Act, and they must record those votes, publish who voted how on the record within a week, I think, after the votes are taken."
1983.83-371,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1125.597,1129.301,"But in these European meetings, who makes the determination?"
1983.83-371,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,1129.301,1135.891,"Well, they've never really been forced to face the issue until this lawsuit began."
1983.83-371,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1145.98,1153.26,"At least the record, then, does not show that the American representatives requested and obtained the closed--"
1983.83-371,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,1153.26,1153.79,"--Oh, no, I'm sorry."
1983.83-371,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1319.8,1325.469,"--May I interrupt just to ask, what statutory language do you rely on for this fourth requirement?"
1983.83-371,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,1329.471,1336.31,"Well, it's the prepositional phrase (b) of ""agency meeting""."
1983.83-371,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1336.31,1340.151,But it's
1983.83-371,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,1343.385,1346.053,"Right, but I think there's a section--"
1983.83-371,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1346.053,1346.914,I thought you relied on the joint conduct.
1983.83-371,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,1348.848,1351.676,"--Well, we do rely upon that, but only on the briefs."
1983.83-371,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1358.644,1367.328,"But I'm still... I must confess, I have the statute in front of me: I don't know what language you say requires that it be a meeting of the agency."
1983.83-371,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,1384.1,1390.223,I think what I'm talking about is subsection 552(b)(B).
1983.83-371,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1405.231,1405.652,Thank you.
1983.83-371,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,1407.886,1418.49,"So that's our fourth test, that the meeting must be a meeting of the agency, and we think that Congress meant that that implied the meeting be run by, under the control of, the agency."
1983.83-371,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1462.691,1483.37,"Would you say there was no meeting that took place if there had been an explicit delegation to the people who attended this international meeting with authority to vote in favor of a certain resolution in a way that would bind, would purport to bind the agency?"
1983.83-371,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,1483.37,1485.62,"We would contend that, because even then--"
1983.83-371,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1485.62,1486.51,It still wouldn't be a meeting?
1983.83-371,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,1486.51,1487.885,--It would not be a meeting of the agency.
1983.83-371,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1487.885,1494.195,Even if that action was within the scope of the authority and would bind the agency?
1983.83-371,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,1494.195,1503.518,"That's our position, because even if they had authority to take action, they could not control the meeting so as to ensure the Act was complied with."
1983.83-371,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1503.518,1504.563,"Well, there were just two meetings going on at the same time."
1983.83-371,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,1512.905,1513.389,But all they could do would be to leave.
1983.83-371,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1513.389,1516.466,They voted in accordance with their instructions.
1983.83-371,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,1516.466,1516.856,And our position--
1983.83-371,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1516.856,1519.967,They were in complete charge of their part of the meeting.
1983.83-371,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,1519.967,1526.276,"--They were, but they could not force the other attendees to let the public come in and see them vote."
1983.83-371,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1530.413,1534.098,"Well, couldn't it be kind of like a caucus within the meeting?"
1983.83-371,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,1544.425,1551.951,"--Well, I don't know how that would... how you could administer that in the real world."
1983.83-371,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1556.108,1558.888,"Well, in the real world that happens all the time in big meetings."
1983.83-371,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,1572.364,1573.756,--Right.
1983.83-371,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1577.785,1578.221,I understand.
1983.83-371,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,1578.221,1588.017,"We're now saying that, even if you say it's a meeting, they have authority to do something, still it would not be a meeting of the FCC that they could control and open up to the public if they didn't run it."
1983.83-371,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1588.017,1592.732,"Well, the statute doesn't require that it be open to the public unless it's a meeting of the agency."
1983.83-371,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,1592.732,1593.637,"Right, that's correct."
1983.83-371,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1593.637,1594.292,Even though it is a meeting.
1983.83-371,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,1594.292,1613.19,"Now, here the meetings, if such they were, were held on foreign soil, they were hosted by foreign governments, they were chaired by foreign officials, they were attended by foreign representatives of foreign governments who outnumbered the attending Commissioners and equaled them in rank."
1983.83-371,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1641.585,1645.209,What are the sanctions for a violation of the Sunshine Act?
1983.83-371,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,1645.209,1649.974,"I believe, Justice Rehnquist, they're all prospective."
1983.83-371,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1655.517,1657.655,But you have to appear before the Supreme Court.
1983.83-371,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,1658.828,1676.244,"What the remedies are, in district court you can get an injunction enjoining compliance with the Act in the future, and you can get release of a transcript which would be required to be made of a closed meeting if the Act were applicable."
1983.83-371,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1717.181,1725.772,Mr. Lewis.
1983.83-371,1,25639,grant_s_lewis,,1725.772,1728.533,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1983.83-371,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2114.558,2117.136,"Mr. Lewis, let me go back just a minute with you if I may."
1983.83-371,1,25639,grant_s_lewis,,2117.136,2117.901,"Certainly, sir."
1983.83-371,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2117.901,2126.832,"The general provision for review of actions of the Federal Communications Commission provides that review lies with the Court of Appeals, doesn't it?"
1983.83-371,1,25639,grant_s_lewis,,2126.832,2131.16,"Justice Rehnquist, review of FCC orders lies with the Court of Appeals."
1983.83-371,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2154.743,2158.429,"Well, did you get into the district court under the Administrative Procedure Act?"
1983.83-371,1,25639,grant_s_lewis,,2158.429,2180.016,"We get into the district court... the Administrative Procedure Act provides for review of agency action that's not otherwise subject to review, which would be the basis for going to the district court rather than the Court of Appeals where we're challenging an action rather than an agency order."
1983.83-371,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2180.016,2184.044,And is that distinction well established in the cases?
1983.83-371,1,25639,grant_s_lewis,,2184.044,2185.323,"We believe it is, sir, yes."
1983.83-371,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2475.61,2477.42,Do you say that's decisionmaking?
1983.83-371,1,25639,grant_s_lewis,,2477.42,2483.012,That speech obviously is not decisionmaking.
1983.83-371,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2483.012,2488.074,"My question is, do you say that is decisionmaking or not?"
1983.83-371,1,25639,grant_s_lewis,,2488.074,2491.775,We are saying that he is participating in a meeting.
1983.83-371,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2522.031,2526.184,But are you going to at some point tell us what decisions were made in Dublin?
1983.83-371,1,25639,grant_s_lewis,,2526.184,2530.715,We don't know what decisions were made in Dublin.
1983.83-371,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2552.874,2574.695,"Mr. Lewis, do you think that simply implementing a decision previously reached by an agency would constitute... would fall under the Sunshine Act, and that the deliberations or the actions resulting in joint conduct?"
1983.83-371,1,25639,grant_s_lewis,,2591.424,2594.655,"Justice O'Connor, when the agency sends someone out the answer is no."
1983.83-371,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2606.37,2608.897,But perhaps not deliberations.
1983.83-371,1,25639,grant_s_lewis,,2616.786,2621.754,This is basically... where the Court of Appeals went is exactly where I believe Your Honor is going.
1983.83-371,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2653.051,2661.44,"Explain to me just simply, what authority does Congress have over Dublin?"
1983.83-371,1,25639,grant_s_lewis,,2661.44,2672.53,"Your Honor, Congress is not seeking to subject Dublin or any foreign administration to the scope of the Sunshine Act."
1983.83-371,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2695.443,2704.299,"But I mean, how can the Commission or anybody else in the United States make Dublin do anything?"
1983.83-371,1,25639,grant_s_lewis,,2704.299,2708.827,Nobody... the only thing Congress is doing is telling the Commission what to do.
1983.83-371,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2711.045,2716.215,"Well, what could the Commission do to make the meeting in Dublin public?"
1983.83-371,1,25639,grant_s_lewis,,2716.215,2719.355,"--Your Honor, the Commission closed the meeting."
1983.83-371,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2756.45,2760.759,I agree fully with what you say.
1983.83-371,1,25639,grant_s_lewis,,2772.895,2777.235,"Your Honor, I'm equally sure that Congress didn't intend for representatives--"
1983.83-371,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2777.235,2778.658,"Yes, but I mean, you agree with that, don't you?"
1983.83-371,1,25639,grant_s_lewis,,2778.658,2788.06,"--Congress certainly did not intend... the legislative history is clear that the question is what is the agency doing, not where is it being done?"
1983.83-371,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2788.06,2792.81,"I mean, when we're negotiating the arms agreement, has he got to be public?"
1983.83-371,1,25639,grant_s_lewis,,2792.81,2793.668,"No, Your Honor."
1983.83-371,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2829.247,2836.356,"But the use of the word ""business"" troubles me a little bit, in view of the precise requirements of the statute."
1983.83-371,1,25639,grant_s_lewis,,2845.913,2858.61,"Justice O'Connor, the word ""deliberation""... I think the legislative history on this is clear that deliberations simply meant, that phrase was used simply to exclude totally informal contacts."
1983.83-371,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2889.657,2896.625,"Well, if the decision has already been made and they are just implementing it, then does that fall within the Sunshine Act?"
1983.83-371,1,25639,grant_s_lewis,,2896.625,2902.436,--The FCC... agencies normally don't implement decisions.
1983.83-371,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2911.101,2917.195,"Well, but you are saying that in this instance the agency was trying to implement its decision--"
1983.83-371,1,25639,grant_s_lewis,,2917.195,2917.99,"--Yes, it was trying--"
1983.83-371,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2917.99,2919.835,--as I understand your claim.
1983.83-371,1,25639,grant_s_lewis,,2919.835,2926.785,--The only thing the agency authorized was Grafnet and Telenet to engage in international operations.
1983.83-371,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3160.062,3163.607,Read the full sentence: conducted a meeting with representatives of these European--
1983.83-371,1,25639,grant_s_lewis,,3163.607,3167.292,"--Yes, that they conducted the meeting--"
1983.83-371,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3167.292,3173.008,--Does the FCC normally conduct meetings within the meaning of this provision with representatives of other--
1983.83-371,1,25639,grant_s_lewis,,3173.008,3181.958,--The Sunshine Act is clear that the fact that representatives even of the public are there does not affect the question of whether these are in fact meetings of the Commission.
1983.83-371,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3190.205,3196.737,"--It still makes it subject to the coverage, but his point is that the requirement that it be open doesn't apply unless it's a meeting of a agency."
1983.83-371,1,25639,grant_s_lewis,,3196.737,3204.731,"What he is citing from, sir, is not the definition either of meeting or the definition of agency--"
1983.83-371,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3204.731,3205.136,"No, it's not the definition."
1983.83-371,1,25639,grant_s_lewis,,3206.856,3218.023,"--And we think it's clear that if there is a meeting as defined of the agency as defined, that the use of the preposition ""of"" and argument about that does not excuse compliance."
1983.83-371,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3222.551,3224.816,So you say there are really only three requirements?
1983.83-371,1,25639,grant_s_lewis,,3224.816,3227.456,--We would actually say that there are two.
1983.83-371,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3309.393,3321.685,"And it's also generally recognized, isn't it, Mr. Lewis, under cases like Myers against Bethlehem Shipbuilding, that the appellate court or any sort of reviewing court just doesn't step right into the middle of an agency proceeding?"
1983.83-371,1,25639,grant_s_lewis,,3323.682,3342.91,"That's precisely correct, sir, and therefore there are many doctrines... exhaustion as articulated in Myers, finality, ripeness... which all stand for the proposition that premature interruption of an ongoing agency proceeding is inappropriate, assuming the plaintiff is not prejudiced by the delay."
1983.83-371,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3387.767,3391.64,"Well, why isn't that damnum absque inuria so far as you're concerned?"
1983.83-371,1,25639,grant_s_lewis,,3391.64,3400.183,--We believe we have a right to challenge ultra... the standing issue is... they argued that--
1983.83-371,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3400.183,3407.728,"Well, what right do you have to challenge ultra vires, if it isn't going to result in any Commission order that would affect you?"
1983.83-371,1,25639,grant_s_lewis,,3407.728,3409.584,--It's the Commission action.
1983.83-371,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3413.163,3414.271,Why do you say that?
1983.83-371,1,25639,grant_s_lewis,,3414.271,3418.533,That's I believe set forth in the Administrative Procedure Act.
1983.83-371,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3424.672,3431.824,"Yes, but you can't just walk in off the street and say that the Commission is about to do something in the future that might affect my client."
1983.83-371,1,25639,grant_s_lewis,,3433.996,3436.371,"No, the Commission is taking action."
1983.83-371,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3437.557,3439.105,Not official action.
1983.83-371,1,25639,grant_s_lewis,,3439.105,3461.764,"--When it goes overseas and urges the French Government to grant an operating agreement to our competitors, and when the French Government only wishes to deal with a limited number of American carriers... I think all that is undisputed... we are threatened with immediate danger if the Commission enters... if the French Government acts."
1983.83-371,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3472.075,3474.496,"Well, unless it's wrong."
1983.83-371,1,25639,grant_s_lewis,,3474.496,3483.96,"As a competitor of the company that they've authorized, we believe we've got standing."
1983.83-371,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3523.833,3525.427,Are you in court for that?
1983.83-371,1,25639,grant_s_lewis,,3528.957,3532.813,"--Your Honor, we've got two complaints."
1983.83-371,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3536.58,3540.0,"As you answered the Chief Justice's question, you don't know what was decided."
1983.83-371,1,25639,grant_s_lewis,,3540.0,3541.45,Pardon me?
1983.83-371,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3541.45,3544.059,You don't know what the decision was.
1983.83-371,1,25639,grant_s_lewis,,3545.9,3549.792,"We know what the Government set out to do, because they've stated that."
1983.83-371,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3549.792,3553.446,"Well, didn't you tell the Chief Justice you didn't know what the decisions were?"
1983.83-371,1,25639,grant_s_lewis,,3553.446,3554.085,That's correct.
1983.83-371,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3554.76,3556.523,"Well, why don't you find out?"
1983.83-371,1,25639,grant_s_lewis,,3556.523,3560.053,That's why we're... the Government in the Sunshine Act--
1983.83-371,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3560.053,3566.676,"If we say the Sunshine Act should have been, that won't tell you what the decisions are."
1983.83-371,1,25639,grant_s_lewis,,3566.676,3568.283,"--Well, that will give us perspective of--"
1983.83-371,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3568.283,3572.565,Is there some form of action where you can get the decisions?
1983.83-371,1,25639,grant_s_lewis,,3572.565,3576.281,--The only way to find out what happened is in discovery in the district court.
1983.83-371,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3578.718,3581.997,"Well, you have to have a case before you can get discovery, don't you?"
1983.83-371,1,25639,grant_s_lewis,,3581.997,3583.277,"--We filed one, sir."
1983.83-371,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3583.277,3588.369,"Yes, but you want a case to have an open hearing."
1983.83-371,1,25639,grant_s_lewis,,3588.369,3592.164,"No, we have two claims for relief."
1983.83-371,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3595.272,3600.879,"I guess I know, nowadays you can file conflicting causes of action."
1983.83-371,1,25639,grant_s_lewis,,3604.392,3613.795,"Justice Marshall, that's not... I'd like to change your mind about that, because the Sunshine Act claim looks to the future and wants to get these meetings open for the future."
1983.83-371,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3629.665,3632.789,"Do you have anything further, Mr. Lauber?"
1983.83-371,2,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,3632.789,3635.507,I have two brief points.
1983.83-371,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3688.673,3698.184,But the fact that you won't tell them what the decisions were does lend credit to his position that you shouldn't have had a closed meeting.
1983.83-371,2,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,3698.184,3699.56,Justice Marshall--
1983.83-371,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3699.56,3700.636,Am I right on that?
1983.83-371,2,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,3700.636,3712.335,--I think the way that ITT should have dealt with that is... they presented their argument to the FCC in a rulemaking petition that the Commissioners were doing bad stuff over in Dublin.
1983.83-371,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3746.755,3748.381,"It's sort of one-sided, though, isn't it?"
1983.83-371,2,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,3748.381,3754.02,"Well, no more one-sided than a contested radio broadcast--"
1983.83-371,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3754.02,3755.549,It's more one-sided than a courtroom.
1983.83-371,2,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,3755.549,3758.423,"--Well, I wouldn't agree with that, Justice Marshall."
1983.83-371,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3758.938,3761.219,"Well, which one-sided court are you talking about?"
1983.83-371,2,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,3763.016,3765.968,"--What I'm saying is, in any kind of contested--"
1983.83-371,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3765.968,3767.294,I don't think you realize what you said.
1983.83-371,2,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,3767.294,3774.341,"--True, the opponent in the proceeding would be the FCC, not a competitor."
1983.83-371,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3781.337,3783.022,"Thank you, gentlemen."
