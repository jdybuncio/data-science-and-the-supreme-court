1978.77-1337,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,49.395,We will hear arguments next in University of Nevada against Hall.
1978.77-1337,0,35695,michael_dyer,,52.451,56.688,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the court.
1978.77-1337,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,239.436,249.243,"As I was reading the briefs in this case, the question that kept recurring to me is; what is the federal issue here?"
1978.77-1337,0,35695,michael_dyer,,271.239,276.247,I would initially respond by first pointing out that this is not a conflicts case.
1978.77-1337,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,279.937,282.816,Now why is it just a matter of State Law?
1978.77-1337,0,35695,michael_dyer,,282.816,294.363,"The basic constitutional issue that this court must reach is, does one State have the right to determine that it may ignore the sovereign status of its sister States?"
1978.77-1337,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,294.363,296.7,Now how the constitution would prevent it from doing that?
1978.77-1337,0,35695,michael_dyer,,297.881,301.975,"The question may it please the court is, what in the constitution would enable it?"
1978.77-1337,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,301.975,303.948,"Well, that's never question."
1978.77-1337,0,35695,michael_dyer,,323.155,331.53,The states of the union would be free to do so; they will be free to make that determination if they are free to treat each other as independent nations.
1978.77-1337,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,375.986,397.877,"Well, ordinarily the Full Faith and Credit relates to acts and events, which have occurred within the state which is asking Full Faith and Credit be given to its law, not -- this is an extra territorial effect that you are asking for, it would appear of the Nevada Law."
1978.77-1337,0,35695,michael_dyer,,397.877,403.363,We are not asking for an extra territorial effect in Nevada law.
1978.77-1337,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,410.877,416.604,"What particular provision of the constitution, I think Mr. Justice Stewart was probing for that."
1978.77-1337,0,35695,michael_dyer,,422.094,429.515,"The constitution, and I'm trying to ask the question Mr. Chief Justice and I'm not trying to side step, but I want to address this question, because I think it is perhaps the most important --"
1978.77-1337,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,429.515,433.402,"Well, there is some other than the Full Faith and Credit Clause that you are relying on."
1978.77-1337,0,35695,michael_dyer,,433.402,445.922,I think that what the court must keep in mind is that the constitution is a document by which the states granted limited powers to the federal government and agreed upon their relationship with their sister states.
1978.77-1337,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,456.476,461.613,But one of them wasn't immunity from federal suit was it.
1978.77-1337,0,35695,michael_dyer,,461.613,464.06,The founding fathers thought that it was.
1978.77-1337,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,467.107,473.232,"Well, no I mean immunity from the suit by the United States."
1978.77-1337,0,35695,michael_dyer,,473.232,487.749,One of the specific powers granted in the constitution was the -- or one of the attributes of sovereignty surrendered was the ability of a state to be sued in the original jurisdiction of this court.
1978.77-1337,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,539.288,546.515,"Well, putting to one side the possible arguments you may make by implication from cases like that."
1978.77-1337,0,35695,michael_dyer,,567.44,575.658,"It did not give up the authority to adjudicate claims over other states, if in fact it has a right to treat other states as independent nations."
1978.77-1337,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,598.168,600.669,This is not treated by removal basically.
1978.77-1337,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,610.325,613.504,Against the background of the Supremacy Clause.
1978.77-1337,0,35695,michael_dyer,,613.504,632.585,"Well, that would be correct, but the point I am trying to make is that there is nothing in the constitution that says that a state has authority to call her sister states to bar, in the very words of this Court and I am quoting from Cunningham versus Macon & Brunswick Railroad, it is 109 U. S. 446."
1978.77-1337,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,678.914,681.864,"General Dyer, may I ask you another question about your theory."
1978.77-1337,0,35695,michael_dyer,,700.175,703.347,If the contract initially of course --
1978.77-1337,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,703.347,711.174,"This was negotiated in California, they had sent people out with authority, issued by the Governor and the State Legislature to go to California and buy a lot of television sets."
1978.77-1337,0,35695,michael_dyer,,714.217,717.099,"Yes, I think they could be sued in that context."
1978.77-1337,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,737.124,737.83,It is the â€“-
1978.77-1337,0,35695,michael_dyer,,737.83,753.173,"A contractual relationship and I think it's important to emphasize that perhaps there may be a distinction as the Court has noted between tort actions of the negligence character, non-intentional torts and other forms of actions."
1978.77-1337,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,797.153,806.025,But you don't argue the case and then say you don't infer the casting aside the sovereign immunity.
1978.77-1337,0,35695,michael_dyer,,806.025,806.951,Perhaps the most leading --
1978.77-1337,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,806.951,808.897,You have to be rather specific on it.
1978.77-1337,0,35695,michael_dyer,,808.897,827.005,Perhaps the most leading case and that is Kennecott Copper and it held in language that very analogist to Nevada statutory waiver that when a State had stated that we waive our immunity and we will be sued in any Court; that any Court did not mean any Court.
1978.77-1337,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,847.257,854.687,"But in the contrary case, you said just by sending the man over there would be enough."
1978.77-1337,0,35695,michael_dyer,,857.823,860.331,I believe the Court has misinterpreted my statement.
1978.77-1337,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,860.542,863.962,"Not the Court, me at the behest of my intelligence."
1978.77-1337,0,35695,michael_dyer,,863.962,891.571,"Well, Mr. Justice, I believe that you may have misinterpreted my statement, because what I meant to reply for you talking about my response to Mr. Justice Steven's question, when the state enters into an area that is when the state engages in inter-state commerce as a common carrier where authority to regulate has been specifically delegated in entering into a proprietary function, then perhaps you'll say that knowingly, knowingly --"
1978.77-1337,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,891.571,898.832,"But the state didn't have anything to do with this car going out except the owner, is that your position?"
1978.77-1337,0,35695,michael_dyer,,898.832,921.118,"No, our position is that Mr. Bam who was the driver of the car was routinely engaged in the performance of his duties with the University of Nevada; that in the course of those duties, he was requested to go into the State of California to pick up some parts, some television parts for the University of Nevada and that he was involved in an automobile accident."
1978.77-1337,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,945.864,957.546,Are you saying Mr. Dyer that the only -- after all what the Full Faith and Credit Clause says shall be given as to the public acts records and judicial proceedings.
1978.77-1337,0,35695,michael_dyer,,968.018,969.73,I think that would be a fair statement --
1978.77-1337,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,969.73,971.079,That's the only one --
1978.77-1337,0,35695,michael_dyer,,971.079,973.536,I believe that is the only Nevada statute drawn and issued.
1978.77-1337,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,973.536,976.903,And that's the only extent to which you rely on the Full Faith and Credit Clause?
1978.77-1337,0,35695,michael_dyer,,976.903,990.333,"No, that's not correct; we also relied on the Full Faith and Credit Clause, as I stated earlier, because it's our understanding that Full Faith and Credit Clause that, that clause in addition to requiring, the judgments acquired in one state be given effect to another."
1978.77-1337,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1001.448,1004.668,"Well, except Mr. Dyer at least in words."
1978.77-1337,0,35695,michael_dyer,,1015.008,1017.15,That is the entire language of the clause.
1978.77-1337,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1017.15,1021.952,"Well, then how do we read into what you have just said?"
1978.77-1337,0,35695,michael_dyer,,1021.952,1036.652,"This case, this Court has repeatedly held that the very purpose of the Full Faith and Credit Clause was to alter the status of the individual States' as independent foreign sovereignties."
1978.77-1337,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1047.519,1055.34,"Yes, but always in the context of whether or not, what we are dealing with the public acts, records and judicial proceedings have you ever stated in that?"
1978.77-1337,0,35695,michael_dyer,,1055.34,1061.361,"I think that in addition, an important concept that we are dealing with is Union, sisterhood."
1978.77-1337,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1070.037,1077.018,"So, even if you didn't have your Sovereign Immunity Limitation Act, you will be making the argument with Full Faith and Credit Clause?"
1978.77-1337,0,35695,michael_dyer,,1077.018,1087.604,"If we didn't have our immunity limitation, we would most likely be asserting that we could not be sued under the Doctrine of Sovereign Immunity in and of itself because of the Full Faith and Credit Clause."
1978.77-1337,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1087.604,1089.033,And that the Full Faith and Credit Clause --
1978.77-1337,0,35695,michael_dyer,,1089.033,1090.256,Because the Full Faith.
1978.77-1337,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1091.8,1097.646,That is simply because the Nevada Courts have held their sovereign immunity isn't it?
1978.77-1337,0,35695,michael_dyer,,1097.646,1106.931,"Immunity, sovereign immunity as we know it in the English System of jurisprudence does not require a holding by the Courts that exist."
1978.77-1337,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1112.374,1118.497,Supposing that the Supreme Court of Nevada had said there is no longer any sovereign immunity in Nevada.
1978.77-1337,0,35695,michael_dyer,,1129.82,1130.454,That's correct.
1978.77-1337,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1133.64,1140.739,"And it does, but so the facts you can make, it doesn't make any difference whether it's a statute or a decisional law in Nevada, does it."
1978.77-1337,0,35695,michael_dyer,,1140.739,1148.56,"Does it make any difference whether it was declared to be invalid by judicial interpretation or whether legislature waived it, except for one."
1978.77-1337,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1192.158,1215.514,"And it could have been that simply this -- I take it if there had been no waiver of sovereign immunity even pro tanto as there has been by the Nevada statute, but the Nevada Supreme Court had held that Nevada continued to adhere the rule of sovereign immunity, you would urge that as a Full Faith and Credit principle that had to apply in California too."
1978.77-1337,0,35695,michael_dyer,,1215.514,1224.403,"If I understand your question Mr. Justice, it's assuming that the Nevada Supreme Court had upheld the principle of sovereign immunity in total?"
1978.77-1337,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1224.403,1225.185,Right.
1978.77-1337,0,35695,michael_dyer,,1225.185,1226.587,And there had been no waiver by the legislature.
1978.77-1337,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1226.587,1227.46,Right.
1978.77-1337,0,35695,michael_dyer,,1227.46,1254.105,"We would at that time urge that the State of California must acknowledge our status as a sovereign and our determination that as a sovereign, we still retain sovereign immunity, it's the status question that's I think is very important in this case and I think the court should be aware that there at least in our mind is a great distinction between the status of a state as a sovereign and the ability to exercise sovereign power."
1978.77-1337,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1301.149,1303.96,So what if there is judgment entered against the state.
1978.77-1337,0,35695,michael_dyer,,1305.782,1312.29,"In this particular case, California would collect it by executing on our tax accounts, which we maintain in the State of California."
1978.77-1337,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1312.29,1317.91,"So you've got money in California, property in California otherwise you could just protect yourself in our own courts."
1978.77-1337,0,35695,michael_dyer,,1317.91,1323.013,"That's exactly right, the only reason that we have property in State of California, I think this is important."
1978.77-1337,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1405.304,1411.29,Not if you decided that by your own law they had no jurisdiction.
1978.77-1337,0,35695,michael_dyer,,1411.29,1416.003,"Your Honor, I would agree with that statement, but I'm saying that I think respondents urged the opposite."
1978.77-1337,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1433.475,1437.43,"General Dyer, I asked you before about a contract action, you said that would be different."
1978.77-1337,0,35695,michael_dyer,,1442.826,1451.279,"Initially, I would say Mr. Justice that if this were a willful, wonton and malicious tort, it would not be in the course of the employee's employment."
1978.77-1337,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1472.402,1481.523,"The State of Nevada sense that is a state militia and take over a part of somebody's private property in the other state, so that would be immune under your theory."
1978.77-1337,0,35695,michael_dyer,,1481.523,1482.222,That would be incorrect.
1978.77-1337,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1482.222,1485.441,You rely on the dignity of the sovereign not to do anything like that of course.
1978.77-1337,0,35695,michael_dyer,,1485.441,1497.555,"Well, that would be correct, but I might also point out that speaking of the state militia, each year when the State of Nevada National Guard goes to summer camp, we don't have any army basis in our State."
1978.77-1337,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1504.281,1507.725,They can chop down all the trees and dig up the roads and that will be immune from liability.--
1978.77-1337,0,35695,michael_dyer,,1507.725,1510.458,"Well, what happens if one of those tanks runs into an automobile?"
1978.77-1337,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1510.458,1513.23,"Was that your view that they could, that the state --"
1978.77-1337,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1513.23,1516.281,You are upset that you are not in the State's army --
1978.77-1337,0,35695,michael_dyer,,1516.281,1516.459,I think that --
1978.77-1337,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1516.459,1517.756,We are simply right --
1978.77-1337,0,35695,michael_dyer,,1517.756,1530.083,"I think the answer to your question Mr. Justice is that if we sent our militia, the State of Nevada sent our militia or our national guard, in the State of California to seize property that would be an act against a state of the union."
1978.77-1337,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1543.17,1553.843,"I'm just assuming individual not to the other state, just you go and chop down a lot of trees and hollow away the wood or something like that."
1978.77-1337,0,35695,michael_dyer,,1553.843,1565.244,"If in fact we direct our employees to go in and commit an intentional tort and we have not waived sovereign immunity, it would be our position that --"
1978.77-1337,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1565.244,1566.662,Excuse me.
1978.77-1337,0,35695,michael_dyer,,1566.662,1580.764,It would be our position that California would be required to recognize our sovereignty that any rights that they might have would be -- had to be taken by the State of the California under the Parens Patriae Doctrine on behalf of their citizens against us in this Court.
1978.77-1337,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1582.287,1586.466,"I'd just like to ask you a question for my own, so I can understand it before you sit down Mr. Dyer."
1978.77-1337,0,35695,michael_dyer,,1605.479,1619.928,"The essence of our position today is that at the time of this action, our waiver was intended to be limited to Courts of the State of Nevada, but if the Court should construe otherwise as the result of the language --"
1978.77-1337,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1619.928,1624.841,"No, I'm not asking you to talk about what the court might hold, what the court's position might be."
1978.77-1337,0,35695,michael_dyer,,1626.07,1637.133,Our initial position is that statutory waiver under the Kennecott decision did not constitute jurisdiction or excuse me waiver of immunity in other states but simply in our own courts.
1978.77-1337,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1637.133,1641.05,"In RSB County Nevada for a limit of $25,000 period."
1978.77-1337,0,35695,michael_dyer,,1641.05,1641.731,That would be correct.
1978.77-1337,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1641.731,1643.501,"Is that it, that's your position."
1978.77-1337,0,35695,michael_dyer,,1643.501,1644.039,"Yes, sir."
1978.77-1337,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1644.039,1647.209,You got quite a part from the alleged waiver in the California Court.
1978.77-1337,0,35695,michael_dyer,,1647.209,1649.064,"Quite a part from that, that's our initial position."
1978.77-1337,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1649.064,1649.985,All right.
1978.77-1337,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1654.881,1656.593,Mr. Rowe.
1978.77-1337,1,23023,everett_rowe,,1656.593,1656.978,Thank you.
1978.77-1337,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1681.111,1686.193,"Let me ask you this before you get launched into it, because it may be relevant."
1978.77-1337,1,23023,everett_rowe,,1694.208,1726.882,"I think in this particular case, we could have by a reason of this fact and this is one of the theories that we have set forth in the brief that we feel that a sovereignty of the state, its sovereign powers are co-extensive with the geographical limitations of that state and then when that state goes outside of its state and entertains and engages in activities in another sovereign state."
1978.77-1337,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1755.425,1771.868,"Reference tells us that when Nevada consented when waived, you took the bitter with the sweet that is you took the jurisdiction with the limitation, which Nevada has prescribed."
1978.77-1337,1,23023,everett_rowe,,1771.868,1826.274,"That's his argument, we don't accept that argument, but we feel that if the argument has any basis at all that our state courts would still have their constitutional power of choice of law and similar to the Pearson case, which he cited as authority, which is really directly opposite to his view in the Pearson case, the New York case, they discussed that state has a choice of constitutional right of choice of law and that they may choose certain portions of a statute and reject others in that case, they rejected the Massachusetts limitation of $15,000 on recovery for debt action, and they took other portions of this statute."
1978.77-1337,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1844.077,1851.974,"Your client couldn't have sued the State of Nevada in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of California, could it?"
1978.77-1337,1,23023,everett_rowe,,1851.974,1877.135,"No, I think that under the present law, as I have been reading these law reviews on both sides and I have been following the arguments, which is a very important constitutional debate that is going on before this Court now with reference to the Eleventh Amendment and Article IV of the Constitution."
1978.77-1337,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1883.126,1897.596,"Do you see anomaly there in a Federal union that the Courts of the Union are not allowed to assert jurisdiction over the State of Nevada in the situation, but the Courts of a sisters State like California are?"
1978.77-1337,1,23023,everett_rowe,,1897.596,1929.333,"Well, I think it's a problem that has arisen by reason of the passage of the Eleventh Amendment and the problems that the Courts have had in dealing with the Eleventh Amendment, but here we are not seeking to federal jurisdiction here this -- I think it is a different case, because this state of Nevada is coming into California outside of its own sovereign jurisdiction and is operating an automobile picking up television parts."
1978.77-1337,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1929.333,1935.37,But presumably it is in the federal jurisdiction whether it's in Nevada or in California.
1978.77-1337,1,23023,everett_rowe,,1935.37,1946.243,It could be absent -- any restrictions in the constitution to entertain jurisdiction.
1978.77-1337,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1946.243,1955.628,Are you content at all that they were not performing a sovereign function when they came into the state of California.
1978.77-1337,1,23023,everett_rowe,,1955.628,1958.343,Of course picking up television parts as -â€“
1978.77-1337,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1958.343,1959.256,For what purpose -â€“
1978.77-1337,1,23023,everett_rowe,,1959.256,1969.228,"For a purpose of university or school, I think most cases have held that I won't call it a sovereign activity, I will call it; it could be a governmental function."
1978.77-1337,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1978.184,1980.896,How do you distinguish governmental from sovereign functions?
1978.77-1337,1,23023,everett_rowe,,1980.896,1998.76,"Well, I would make the distinction because I don't think that when Nevada is in California, when it is outside of that area where there is a relationship between governed and governor, that they actually are in the nature of a sovereign."
1978.77-1337,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1998.76,2001.253,"In other words, they drop their cloak when they crossed the border."
1978.77-1337,1,23023,everett_rowe,,2001.253,2014.114,"Correct and are of course precedent for that in other aspects of case mainly not dealing with motor vehicle accident cases, but dealing with property exemption from taxation."
1978.77-1337,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2065.21,2071.364,"Mr. Rowe there aren't very many cases involving the fact situations of this type, are they?"
1978.77-1337,1,23023,everett_rowe,,2071.364,2072.38,I could find none.
1978.77-1337,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2072.38,2079.306,"Are you relying on the policy case in anyway, the North Dakota case of some years ago."
1978.77-1337,1,23023,everett_rowe,,2082.889,2101.681,"They cited that -- the District Court of Appeals cited against me, but I always thought that the case actually was in my favor, because it actually gave the right of choice of law in that particular case that dealt with an anchor workman's compensation claim."
1978.77-1337,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2128.941,2135.584,"It seems to me to come as post -- factually as any case there is, but you can't really on it very much, you don't cite it."
1978.77-1337,1,23023,everett_rowe,,2135.584,2149.453,"Well, I didn't think it was entirely on point, because it was one of those cases involving workman's compensation laws and you have the Alaska Packers case and the others."
1978.77-1337,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2149.453,2151.062,I guess your opponent doesn't cite it either.
1978.77-1337,1,23023,everett_rowe,,2151.062,2154.228,"No, he doesn't though I won't think he would."
1978.77-1337,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2164.839,2179.466,"Your theory is that this respondent who was playing it below can get more money in a California Court from Nevada, then Nevada would give him in Nevada."
1978.77-1337,1,23023,everett_rowe,,2179.466,2181.28,Correct.
1978.77-1337,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2181.28,2183.24,Doesn't that strike you as funny?
1978.77-1337,1,23023,everett_rowe,,2183.24,2185.909,"No, I don't think it really does, because I can see if the x --"
1978.77-1337,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2185.909,2187.952,Can you imagine anything like it?
1978.77-1337,1,23023,everett_rowe,,2187.952,2188.769,Pardon me.
1978.77-1337,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2188.769,2192.545,Can you imagine anything like it?
1978.77-1337,1,23023,everett_rowe,,2192.545,2198.132,If the accident had happened in Nevada and we had California residence.
1978.77-1337,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2198.132,2204.56,"No, no I said if the accident happened in California and you sued Nevada in Nevada."
1978.77-1337,1,23023,everett_rowe,,2204.56,2205.56,Right.
1978.77-1337,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2205.56,2208.075,"You would get $25,000."
1978.77-1337,1,23023,everett_rowe,,2208.075,2209.024,I think --
1978.77-1337,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2209.024,2214.09,"And if you sued in California, you would get the moon."
1978.77-1337,1,23023,everett_rowe,,2214.09,2220.64,"Well, I don't think -- I wouldn't characterize it as the moon, because this young boy suffered severe brain damage and is retarded for the rest of his life."
1978.77-1337,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2220.64,2227.295,"To me it is the moon, I don't know, well you are wealthy."
1978.77-1337,1,23023,everett_rowe,,2227.295,2235.537,"Well, I would like -- I'm not even sure that today what Nevada's position is and I duly -â€“"
1978.77-1337,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2235.537,2238.212,"Well, as I understand their position."
1978.77-1337,1,23023,everett_rowe,,2238.212,2238.594,They have done away with --
1978.77-1337,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2238.594,2245.6,"They said if you want them to give up their sovereignty, they would give it up on their terms."
1978.77-1337,1,23023,everett_rowe,,2248.123,2256.002,But I would like to refer to the case that I mailed the letter to the Court about the Turner versus Stags case.
1978.77-1337,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2392.97,2399.448,"Of course, that isn't the reason relied on by the Supreme Court of California, is it that Nevada itself had abandoned sovereignty."
1978.77-1337,1,23023,everett_rowe,,2399.448,2406.235,"No, I think the basis of their opinion is the basis that I'm arguing here."
1978.77-1337,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2406.235,2410.87,"Mr. Rowe, I understand you to say you had written a letter to the Court about some case?"
1978.77-1337,1,23023,everett_rowe,,2410.87,2414.544,"I was going to use that particular case in oral argument, yes."
1978.77-1337,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2416.731,2417.863,Wasn't delivered?
1978.77-1337,1,23023,everett_rowe,,2417.863,2421.966,"Yeah, I had it delivered to the Court through Federal Express from Santa Fe."
1978.77-1337,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2421.966,2422.884,I don't seem to have a copy of it.

1978.77-1337,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2446.244,2447.268,What is the citation?
1978.77-1337,1,23023,everett_rowe,,2447.268,2453.93,I'll get it for you here.

1978.77-1337,1,23023,everett_rowe,,2475.064,2475.545,Right.
1978.77-1337,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2516.265,2517.939,Mr. Rowe could I ask you a question.
1978.77-1337,1,23023,everett_rowe,,2524.298,2533.016,"Well, actually it started in San Francisco with the administrator being appointed in San Francisco of the deceased employee."
1978.77-1337,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2548.947,2550.184,Under the Nevada venues?
1978.77-1337,1,23023,everett_rowe,,2550.184,2552.537,"Yes, yes it does and then on the appendix."
1978.77-1337,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2552.537,2554.133,Only in Ormsby County if it's --

1978.77-1337,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2565.764,2567.043,Even though it is against the state?
1978.77-1337,1,23023,everett_rowe,,2567.043,2569.845,"Even though it is against the state, it is their own provision."
1978.77-1337,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2569.845,2579.61,You felt bound suing in California and going against their principle of sovereign immunity to nonetheless follow the Nevada venue provision.
1978.77-1337,1,23023,everett_rowe,,2579.61,2594.21,"I wasn't -- we were not bound by it, but the case was in the county in which the accident happened until we got a change of venue based upon the convenience of witnesses to Alameda County."
1978.77-1337,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2594.21,2595.79,Which is Oakland?
1978.77-1337,1,23023,everett_rowe,,2595.79,2596.314,Pardon.
1978.77-1337,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2596.314,2597.423,Which is Oakland?
1978.77-1337,1,23023,everett_rowe,,2597.423,2598.001,Oakland.
1978.77-1337,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2598.001,2602.012,And I suppose verdicts tend to be higher in Oakland than they do in Placer.
1978.77-1337,1,23023,everett_rowe,,2602.012,2605.6,"Well, I don't know if there is been any statistical study of that but --"
1978.77-1337,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2605.6,2608.206,Would you need one?
1978.77-1337,1,23023,everett_rowe,,2608.206,2643.004,"I would think, now the basis for the move and it was very well documented was by reason of convenience of witness, because all of the doctors and witnesses treating this brain damaged child were in the Bay Area and for that reason rather than having them all come from Oakland, San Francisco and that area to Placer County and Auburn, the Court thought that the venue change should be granted."
1978.77-1337,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2890.575,2901.887,"Well, we could decide the case in your favor by saying that there is no constitutional limitation on the right of California to assert jurisdiction in situations like this."
1978.77-1337,1,23023,everett_rowe,,2922.29,2930.656,"Well, I don't know what the basis of affirming, I think that the Supreme Court of California did not discuss Nevada policy."
1978.77-1337,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3001.17,3012.023,"Mr. Rowe suppose Nevada just stayed patent and not waived any of its immunity, you couldn't have sued at all, could you?"
1978.77-1337,1,23023,everett_rowe,,3012.023,3036.132,"I think we could have because of my theory that when -- and the theory of the Supreme Court of the State of California that when Nevada came into California and conducted operations in the State of California, they no longer had the protection or the status of a sovereign."
1978.77-1337,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3044.48,3049.301,"How would they come in as a sovereign, with a crown on as sovereign meeting?"
1978.77-1337,1,23023,everett_rowe,,3049.301,3050.039,Well â€“-
1978.77-1337,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3050.039,3051.573,We are talking about today.
1978.77-1337,1,23023,everett_rowe,,3051.573,3058.978,We are talking about today and I think that the cases that I've cited in the brief which discussed that.
1978.77-1337,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3058.978,3064.843,We are talking about where they had no -- they haven't waived their sovereignty by statute of anything.
1978.77-1337,1,23023,everett_rowe,,3064.843,3067.019,Right and they drive into California.
1978.77-1337,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3067.019,3068.361,Yeah.
1978.77-1337,1,23023,everett_rowe,,3068.361,3069.75,My theory â€“
1978.77-1337,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3069.75,3080.141,"Your theory is that California drove in -- I mean that the Nevada drove in, but that's not a bad theory but we will go your theory that Nevada drove the car."
1978.77-1337,1,23023,everett_rowe,,3080.141,3083.729,They came into California once they came into California.
1978.77-1337,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3083.729,3086.267,They waived their sovereign immunity.
1978.77-1337,1,23023,everett_rowe,,3086.267,3092.729,They didn't even have a status as a sovereign and therefore they didn't have any immunity which they could waive.
1978.77-1337,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3092.729,3094.259,How do you sue them?
1978.77-1337,1,23023,everett_rowe,,3101.996,3103.306,Well of course they have that --
1978.77-1337,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3103.306,3104.125,Don't you?
1978.77-1337,1,23023,everett_rowe,,3104.125,3105.384,They have a description.
1978.77-1337,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3105.384,3105.49,Don't you?
1978.77-1337,1,23023,everett_rowe,,3105.49,3106.956,They have to sue somebody.
1978.77-1337,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3106.956,3108.612,In the state of sovereignty?
1978.77-1337,1,23023,everett_rowe,,3108.612,3110.257,State is sovereign in Nevada.
1978.77-1337,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3110.257,3113.081,"So you sue the sovereignty, don't you?"
1978.77-1337,1,23023,everett_rowe,,3113.081,3115.952,"Well, we sue a political entity called --"
1978.77-1337,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3115.952,3120.192,You sued Nevada (Inaudible).
1978.77-1337,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3120.192,3123.69,"I think your point is that Nevada is a sovereign within its own and over its own territory, right period."
1978.77-1337,1,23023,everett_rowe,,3123.69,3125.876,Certainly.
1978.77-1337,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3139.887,3144.231,And it is still in high school and yet today.
1978.77-1337,1,23023,everett_rowe,,3152.994,3155.537,That would be -- I would accept that within the State of Nevada.
1978.77-1337,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3155.537,3156.649,As a general statement.
1978.77-1337,1,23023,everett_rowe,,3156.649,3158.651,Within the State of Nevada only.
1978.77-1337,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3171.503,3175.629,"I understand, your point is they could sue without this statute."
1978.77-1337,1,23023,everett_rowe,,3176.938,3178.805,"Certainly could, right."
1978.77-1337,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3178.805,3195.126,"And I take it, who you would limit in the California's right or your client's right to sue Nevada â€“- what would have been the case if you had sued California?"
1978.77-1337,1,23023,everett_rowe,,3195.126,3196.459,Could you repeat that question again Your Honor?
1978.77-1337,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3196.459,3201.953,"Well, does Nevada have less sovereign immunity than the State of California?"
1978.77-1337,1,23023,everett_rowe,,3201.953,3203.437,No.
1978.77-1337,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3214.374,3220.661,"Could California say Nevada has no sovereign immunity in the State, although the State of California does."
1978.77-1337,1,23023,everett_rowe,,3223.651,3233.527,There is a concept in the law that California has the supreme sovereignty when Nevada is engaging in activities within its state.
1978.77-1337,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3236.979,3247.507,"So, what if in the California courts you could sue California only for an amount up to $10,000, let's assume that?"
1978.77-1337,1,23023,everett_rowe,,3247.507,3248.942,For an accident happening in California.
1978.77-1337,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3248.942,3260.012,"In California, now could Nevada be sued in the California Courts for more than that or could California decide that yes it could have an unlimited liability."
1978.77-1337,1,23023,everett_rowe,,3260.012,3261.919,"Well, it's an interesting question, we don't have before us."

1978.77-1337,1,23023,everett_rowe,,3271.58,3275.292,"Well, California of course has no limitation."
1978.77-1337,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3284.119,3288.037,And do you entertain suits by Nevada in the California Courts?
1978.77-1337,1,23023,everett_rowe,,3288.037,3296.435,"I don't know whether we do or not, I would certainly think with the attitude of the Supreme Court of California that they would have to â€“-"
1978.77-1337,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3296.435,3300.691,You entertain suits to collect taxes by the State of Nevada in the California Court?

1978.77-1337,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3302.469,3309.469,Has this kind of a case ever risen in Nevada. Has California ever been sued in Nevada?
1978.77-1337,1,23023,everett_rowe,,3309.469,3321.859,We have searched all of the cases and it seems to be and it's a very strange thing that this is a cause of first impressionist's type of an automobile accident case.

1978.77-1337,1,23023,everett_rowe,,3334.563,3336.766,That's correct.
1978.77-1337,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3336.766,3341.305,And you sue the University of Nevada I take it.
1978.77-1337,1,23023,everett_rowe,,3341.305,3341.985,Yes.
1978.77-1337,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3341.985,3352.784,And is there some policy in Nevada that by which state agencies pay the judgments for their negligent employees or do you not?
1978.77-1337,1,23023,everett_rowe,,3352.784,3361.861,There is a section that they have cited in their -- that requires indemnification by the state of negligent acts of employees.
1978.77-1337,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3361.861,3368.003,So what was your problem then -- there wasn't any problem in collectability there?
1978.77-1337,1,23023,everett_rowe,,3368.003,3369.79,"Well, I don't think there will be a question of collectability."
1978.77-1337,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3369.79,3374.57,"No, but I mean if you had just sued the employee?"
