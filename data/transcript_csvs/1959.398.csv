1959.398,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,34.198,"Number 398 on the docket, United States, Petitioner, versus the State of Alabama et al."
1959.398,0,32701,j_lee_rankin,,36.139,40.626,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1959.398,1,25697,gordon_madison,,867.156,874.001,Mr. Chief Justice Warren and Honorable Members of this Court.
1959.398,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1120.446,1129.323,I think that that on what the Solicitor General said that the Government of United States is willing to go ahead with the litigation without these two respondents.
1959.398,1,25697,gordon_madison,,1129.323,1133.379,"Well, that brings a lot of questions, Mr. Justice Douglas."
1959.398,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1214.328,1214.376,Well that is --
1959.398,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1214.376,1214.728,(Voice Overlap) --
1959.398,1,25697,gordon_madison,,1214.728,1219.013,"(Voice Overlap) and either way it goes, we won't have to respond (Inaudible)"
1959.398,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1219.013,1231.069,"Well, that case having been merely dismissed if the Government does not proceed -- try to proceed further against your clients that, only against the State."
1959.398,1,25697,gordon_madison,,1238.104,1243.514,"If Your Honor will say that this Nineteenth Amendment to 1957, Civil Rights Act --"
1959.398,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1243.514,1244.075,Yes.
1959.398,1,25697,gordon_madison,,1244.075,1249.526,"-- give them a right to proceed against the State, can we raise any constitutional questions in that Court."
1959.398,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1253.235,1253.256,"Well, --"
1959.398,1,25697,gordon_madison,,1253.256,1256.894,-- Mr. Justice Frankfurter pointed out but regarding all those (Voice Overlap) --
1959.398,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1256.894,1269.105,I don't think -- I don't think that the Solicitor General has asked us to hold it in this case that -- that in -- in his present posture that the 1957 Act so provided.
1959.398,1,25697,gordon_madison,,1275.966,1278.336,"Well, suppose the 1960 Act is unconstitutional as a whole."
1959.398,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1278.336,1282.835,"Well, that's -- that's what -- that's what you can raise down below, cant you?"
1959.398,1,25697,gordon_madison,,1283.486,1289.945,"Will there be any question if you do such a thing as that in this Court even if you should hold that, that's proper way to get rid of it."
1959.398,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1299.251,1306.022,"Well, I -- I took it from the Solicitor General that he made no such contention that he felt he would open to that."
1959.398,2,32701,j_lee_rankin,,1307.639,1322.67,"Mr. Chief Justice and the Court, the position of the Government that the Court should not go into the constitutional questions here and if those would be handled in the lower court and that when they are raised as though it was ab initio."
1959.398,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1322.67,1322.879,Yes.
1959.398,2,32701,j_lee_rankin,,1322.879,1323.698,(Voice Overlap) --
1959.398,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1323.698,1325.434,That's the way I understood your position.
1959.398,3,25697,gordon_madison,,1330.807,1337.04,"If Your Honor, please, I don't speak for the -- I'm one of the assistants in the Attorney General's office and Attorney General will know that."
1959.398,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1337.04,1337.209,Yes.
1959.398,3,25697,gordon_madison,,1337.209,1351.122,"And when it comes to the matter of telling this Court what we're willing to do or not do to, you'll have to do like you do in so many Senate hearings you have to adjourn for while for conference [Laughter]."
1959.398,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1351.122,1351.227,And --
1959.398,3,25697,gordon_madison,,1351.227,1359.58,"I will say through this though, there is something about this 1960 Act that somebody needs to go into whether it's ever held constitutional or unconstitutional or whatnot."
1959.398,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1405.834,1418.4,"Well, the point -- point is that -- that those should be raised down below and they should have the scrutiny of the District Court and then have the scrutiny of the Court of Appeals before they come to us."
1959.398,3,25697,gordon_madison,,1429.245,1431.387,"I would urge you not to do so, Your Honor."
1959.398,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1431.387,1432.276,I beg your pardon?
1959.398,3,25697,gordon_madison,,1432.276,1433.525,That I would urge you to do so.
1959.398,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1433.525,1433.979,Yes.
1959.398,3,25697,gordon_madison,,1444.87,1452.925,"Now, his -- his proposal is made in the light and he must take that in consideration in here in what we should do."
1959.398,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1457.227,1457.564,Yes.
1959.398,3,25697,gordon_madison,,1457.564,1459.878,"Now, we'd like courts and stay in one."
1959.398,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1467.509,1469.895,Mr. Hare.
1959.398,4,37140,nicholas_s_hare,,1469.895,1474.914,"Sir, I have only one thing to argue or rather to add."
1959.398,4,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1525.867,1528.457,How much of a speculation do you think it is?
1959.398,4,37140,nicholas_s_hare,,1528.457,1541.733,Well I noticed that the N.A.A.C.P. is greatly distressed about it being only half a loaf and would apparently prefer that the half loaf be rejected in the hope of getting a full loaf.
1959.398,4,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1541.733,1544.84,But that's not within their power even to sign it to veto.
1959.398,4,37140,nicholas_s_hare,,1544.84,1549.976,"No, but they seem to have considerable voice."
1959.398,4,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1549.976,1552.451,"At least you are not joining their field, are you?"
1959.398,4,37140,nicholas_s_hare,,1552.451,1553.72,"No, sir."
1959.398,4,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1713.041,1717.488,But surely there's a decisive difference between Rice and this case.
1959.398,4,37140,nicholas_s_hare,,1736.569,1737.486,A confirming statute.
1959.398,4,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1737.486,1738.703,-- a view of the Government --
1959.398,4,37140,nicholas_s_hare,,1738.703,1738.933,From the view --
1959.398,4,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1738.933,1750.441,"-- that confirming the statute, the Government have argued a basic complaint as far as the State is concerned on an argumentative -- on an a elaborate argumentative."
1959.398,4,37140,nicholas_s_hare,,1789.599,1799.224,"Your Honor, with reference to the Sioux City Cemetery case that Your Honor is more familiar with than any other living human beings since its -- to you maybe --"
1959.398,4,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1799.224,1802.063,Just a little of accounts of the loss of memory by an old man.
1959.398,4,37140,nicholas_s_hare,,1802.063,1803.677,[Laughs]
1959.398,4,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1810.062,1811.205,Yes.
1959.398,4,37140,nicholas_s_hare,,1811.205,1817.385,"And to that extent, it's just about as close as you'll find one, but --"
1959.398,4,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1817.385,1825.496,What the statute did is against -- one of the statutes did in the relation of the second related statute to the prior situation makes all the difference.
1959.398,4,37140,nicholas_s_hare,,1825.496,1846.782,"Now, but we take the position that the -- this could not be a confirmatory -- could not be a confirmatory action because the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, the last word on the subject had sustained the lower court."
1959.398,4,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1887.513,1911.592,"I wonder if you adhere to a State whether you would deny that on its face, 42 U.S.C. 1971 (c) on its face, I'm not -- not requiring to questions of constitutionality but on its face that is a congressional authorization for making the State a party."
1959.398,4,37140,nicholas_s_hare,,1911.592,1915.339,"You mean form the old Act of the 1957 Act, sir?"
1959.398,4,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1915.339,1915.711,"No, no, no."
1959.398,4,37140,nicholas_s_hare,,1922.089,1922.95,It -- it's this specifically.
1959.398,4,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1922.95,1925.838,The 1957 Act is a debatable act.
1959.398,4,37140,nicholas_s_hare,,1925.838,1926.126,"Yes, sir."
1959.398,4,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1926.126,1932.065,And my question is whether you're here to state whether the 1971 (c) --
1959.398,4,37140,nicholas_s_hare,,1932.065,1932.439,That's what is --
1959.398,4,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1932.439,1936.15,"And move, takes that out of debate and is explicit."
1959.398,4,37140,nicholas_s_hare,,1936.15,1939.852,"We say, sir that that does -- that is explicit, now."
1959.398,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1951.609,1952.856,"The Act says so, doesn't it?"
1959.398,4,37140,nicholas_s_hare,,1952.856,1953.275,That's right.
1959.398,4,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1958.564,1958.645,Well I mean does that --
1959.398,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1958.645,1960.406,That's a constitutional question.
1959.398,4,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1960.406,1961.82,"That's right, a constitutional question."
1959.398,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2044.567,2045.871,Mr. Solicitor General.
1959.398,5,32701,j_lee_rankin,,2045.871,2048.558,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1959.398,5,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2215.969,2219.832,Is there anything further gentlemen?
