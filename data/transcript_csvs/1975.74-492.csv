1975.74-492,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,33.914,We will hear arguments next in Ohio against Gallagher.
1975.74-492,0,27362,herbert_m_jacobson,,38.934,44.492,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please this Court.
1975.74-492,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,340.343,341.205,Mr. Jacobsen?
1975.74-492,0,27362,herbert_m_jacobson,,341.205,342.16,Yes.
1975.74-492,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,342.16,365.956,I am looking at the opinion of Supreme Court at 817 of the petition for certiorari and the opening sentence is the question presented is whether testimony concerning statements made by appellant to his parole officer was received at trial in violation of appellant's privileges against self-incrimination.
1975.74-492,0,27362,herbert_m_jacobson,,396.252,399.654,The Supreme Court in our State indicated that it was both.
1975.74-492,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,412.283,415.031,So we are viewing as a violation of both?
1975.74-492,0,27362,herbert_m_jacobson,,415.031,417.846,It is a violation in my opinion of both not one without the other.
1975.74-492,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,421.447,428.075,My question is the Jurors Ohio Supreme Court hold that it was a violation of both constitutions?
1975.74-492,0,27362,herbert_m_jacobson,,428.075,428.864,"Yes, both."
1975.74-492,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,428.864,430.46,Then now you are out of court.
1975.74-492,0,27362,herbert_m_jacobson,,430.46,434.762,"No sir, because Oregon versus House indicated that holding --"
1975.74-492,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,434.762,436.727,What jurisdiction do we have?
1975.74-492,0,27362,herbert_m_jacobson,,436.727,441.333,"Under the Fifth Amendment and under the Due Process clause and the Fourteenth, two."
1975.74-492,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,441.333,442.894,"No, no, no."
1975.74-492,0,27362,herbert_m_jacobson,,454.014,460.846,"No the Supreme Court of Ohio did not use the word 'or', it said 'and' it was in violation of the Fifth Amendment to the United States."
1975.74-492,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,460.846,464.182,"Well, that is exactly my point, then you are out of Court."
1975.74-492,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,466.015,474.371,"In other words, is there an adequate state ground for the decision of the Supreme Court of Ohio which you challenge?"
1975.74-492,0,27362,herbert_m_jacobson,,474.371,479.164,"No, we are challenging the application of the Fifth Amendment to the United States."
1975.74-492,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,479.164,485.636,Is there also not a state ground which reached the same result put in another way?
1975.74-492,0,27362,herbert_m_jacobson,,485.636,488.06,Well it reached under Section 10 Article 1 of Ohio --
1975.74-492,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,488.06,488.456,"Well, is that not a --"
1975.74-492,0,27362,herbert_m_jacobson,,488.456,489.335,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice?"
1975.74-492,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,489.335,491.722,-- is that not an adequate state ground?
1975.74-492,0,27362,herbert_m_jacobson,,491.722,497.513,"No, in my opinion it is not because it makes the state and agreed party for purposes of --"
1975.74-492,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,497.513,506.198,For purposes of duty or the Supreme Court of Ohio to enforce and apply the Ohio Constitution?
1975.74-492,0,27362,herbert_m_jacobson,,506.198,508.806,Of course it is their duty to apply that.
1975.74-492,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,508.806,510.457,"They applied it here, did they not?"
1975.74-492,0,27362,herbert_m_jacobson,,510.457,514.602,They applied it and also under the grounds of the Fifth.
1975.74-492,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,514.602,517.398,They did apply it?
1975.74-492,0,27362,herbert_m_jacobson,,517.398,518.591,Yes.
1975.74-492,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,518.591,529.534,"And concluded that under the Ohio Constitution, this was the proper result as well as under the Federal Constitution?"
1975.74-492,0,27362,herbert_m_jacobson,,529.534,539.803,"Yes, but we are also going under the jurisdictional question as issued in Oregon versus Hass which indicates that the State is an agreed party for the purposes of review to this Court."
1975.74-492,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,539.803,568.583,"But only if a Federal question, if it we were to decide in your favor on the Federal question and say, no Miranda does not require this and send this case back to the Supreme Court of Ohio, your response to Mr. Justice Brennan’s question suggest to me that the Supreme Court of Ohio would say, well, we were wrong on that one but we are the final judges of the Supreme Court of Ohio Constitution and the conviction is nonetheless reverse."
1975.74-492,0,27362,herbert_m_jacobson,,568.583,572.172,I hold that we are here rightfully under the Oregon case.
1975.74-492,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,584.297,600.91,(Inaudible) Did the Court of Ohio felt compelled to construe its own constitution the same as the Federal and that the Federal cases forced them to construe their constitution this way?
1975.74-492,0,27362,herbert_m_jacobson,,630.327,686.621,"Well, U.S. versus Deaton also indicated that they indicated in their opinion and “United States versus Deaton certiorari was denied but it said that squarely confronts the precise question” and there there held that the Miranda warnings having not been given they predetermined in deciding the Deaton application they decided that--"
1975.74-492,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,686.621,690.877,Do not feel too badly we are the ones who granted the petition for certiorari.
1975.74-492,0,27362,herbert_m_jacobson,,690.877,693.08,Yes.
1975.74-492,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,693.08,702.252,And maybe may I suggest that perhaps this is not as simple as some of us might have initially thought.
1975.74-492,0,27362,herbert_m_jacobson,,728.92,729.813,They could not Your Honor.
1975.74-492,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,742.952,747.617,(Inaudible) Supreme Court to tell us whether they rested that on the state constitution?
1975.74-492,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,747.617,767.395,"Well, you presumably have a number of points to make and whatever disposition the Court makes of the matter ultimately, If I were in your position, I do not believe I want to be in the position of voluntarily surrendering it."
1975.74-492,0,27362,herbert_m_jacobson,,767.395,768.175,"Well, I am not Your Honor."
1975.74-492,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,770.983,772.061,To be granted certiorari?
1975.74-492,0,27362,herbert_m_jacobson,,772.061,772.991,That is right.
1975.74-492,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,772.991,774.437,We said over here?
1975.74-492,0,27362,herbert_m_jacobson,,774.437,775.023,Yes.
1975.74-492,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,775.023,777.761,Unanimously.
1975.74-492,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,777.761,788.346,The only problem I want from you is one case that you have to support a case of this Court.
1975.74-492,0,27362,herbert_m_jacobson,,788.346,791.849,"Well, US versus Deaton indicated that what was a Federal question."
1975.74-492,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,791.849,795.73,"Federal question as to whether it is on a state end, Federal ground?"
1975.74-492,0,27362,herbert_m_jacobson,,795.73,804.328,"No, that it was only federal because backs that up by holding that the state is a proper agreed party."
1975.74-492,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,804.328,806.041,"Well, I want the case."
1975.74-492,0,27362,herbert_m_jacobson,,806.041,807.108,It is Oregon versus Hass.
1975.74-492,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,811.575,829.18,"But that was in the context of contention that if a State Court ruled against the state, the state had no right to come to this Court even to assert that the State Court had been wrong on a Federal ground."
1975.74-492,0,27362,herbert_m_jacobson,,846.866,872.26,"Well, all this Supreme Court of Ohio did was to cite Federal law and based on Federal law is why they came to that conclusion, and that is so indicated in Deaton. Deaton is a Federal case and that is the very case upon which they rested the basis and foundation of their reversal."
1975.74-492,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,872.26,874.989,Let me ask you this Mr. Jacobson.
1975.74-492,0,27362,herbert_m_jacobson,,938.579,952.515,My only answer is that the state then so ordered by the accused to his parole officer became the vital issue in the case under the Fifth Amendment upon which Miranda is wholly based.
1975.74-492,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,952.515,961.332,And it would appear that the man who wrote the syllabus and the judge who wrote the opinion did not talk to each other very much about this case.
1975.74-492,0,27362,herbert_m_jacobson,,977.886,996.515,"Well, the Supreme Court of Ohio in making its ruling in which they did reverse, indicated in their finding that there was an inherent compulsion in the parole officer-parolee relationship."
1975.74-492,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1231.373,1234.346,"The interrogation here was in the jail house, was it not?"
1975.74-492,0,27362,herbert_m_jacobson,,1234.346,1236.111,The interrogation was in the jail house.
1975.74-492,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1236.111,1238.539,And it was about a crime.
1975.74-492,0,27362,herbert_m_jacobson,,1239.541,1240.443,That is right.
1975.74-492,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1240.443,1264.615,"And suppose that immediately after the parole officer left, a tax investigator showed up and wanted to talk to him about some tax crime of his and he interrogated him without any Miranda Warnings and then what he said was offered against him in a tax prosecution."
1975.74-492,0,27362,herbert_m_jacobson,,1269.711,1271.195,Pardon me.
1975.74-492,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1271.195,1277.379,"I suppose you would argue well, he had been given Miranda Warnings once and that is enough."
1975.74-492,0,27362,herbert_m_jacobson,,1282.028,1287.642,"I believe in that case, the Internal Revenue agent went to the penitentiary and talked to the individual then."
1975.74-492,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1287.642,1289.584,He went to where he was in custody.
1975.74-492,0,27362,herbert_m_jacobson,,1290.942,1291.976,Yes.
1975.74-492,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1308.191,1315.356,Well yes but this parole officer is the one who asked this man about the robbery.
1975.74-492,0,27362,herbert_m_jacobson,,1317.841,1319.852,He asked him his question about the robbery.
1975.74-492,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1321.99,1324.536,Well but he asked him about the robbery did he not?
1975.74-492,0,27362,herbert_m_jacobson,,1324.536,1326.436,"Yes, that is right and we say that he was not --"
1975.74-492,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1326.436,1335.308,And he told somebody else what the answers were and namely the prosecution and they put him on a stand.
1975.74-492,0,27362,herbert_m_jacobson,,1335.308,1338.195,That is right.
1975.74-492,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1338.195,1348.619,"As the record show, whether Sykes knew at the time of this interview with the parolees that he was likely to be a witness in the case?"
1975.74-492,0,27362,herbert_m_jacobson,,1348.619,1350.4,"Not at that particular time, no."
1975.74-492,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1350.4,1359.828,Does the record show whether Sykes had customarily testified in cases involving his interviews with his particular parolees?
1975.74-492,0,27362,herbert_m_jacobson,,1359.828,1360.706,"No, he did not."
1975.74-492,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1375.652,1379.33,"Is that in the record, that this is the first time he ever testified?"
1975.74-492,0,27362,herbert_m_jacobson,,1379.33,1382.276,"Yes, you will find that in our appendix."
1975.74-492,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1391.851,1402.954,"(Inaudible) What the respondent said to Sykes, how did the prosecution ever know?"
1975.74-492,0,27362,herbert_m_jacobson,,1402.954,1409.477,The statement originally given by the respondent to the police officials.
1975.74-492,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1409.477,1410.485,What did parole do?
1975.74-492,0,27362,herbert_m_jacobson,,1410.485,1411.889,It was later suppressed.
1975.74-492,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1411.889,1415.498,"well, I understand that, but how did they know when he said there was a parole officer?"
1975.74-492,0,27362,herbert_m_jacobson,,1419.411,1421.6,The parole officer had indicated that later.
1975.74-492,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1424.189,1425.884,What for?
1975.74-492,0,27362,herbert_m_jacobson,,1425.884,1432.734,He just said he had a talk with him and he indicated the he had admitted the offense and later when the suppression statement was --
1975.74-492,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1432.734,1440.133,"Well, then what is the doubt about what would happen then, when he said that about being a witness?"
1975.74-492,0,27362,herbert_m_jacobson,,1440.133,1448.662,"Well they did not indicate at that time that we are going to call him as a witness, at least the prosecution did not until the statement was suppressed."
1975.74-492,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1448.662,1454.141,"I supposed if the statement of the police had been admissible evidence, there would have been no need to call a parole --"
1975.74-492,0,27362,herbert_m_jacobson,,1454.141,1455.54,That is exactly right Your Honor.
1975.74-492,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1584.021,1595.097,"(Inaudible) a great deal of difference whether you call this officer a law enforcement officer or not, we know he was a parole officer; he had certain law enforcement authority."
1975.74-492,0,27362,herbert_m_jacobson,,1598.243,1598.457,Yes.
1975.74-492,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1598.457,1602.029,He has the right to arrest the parolee under Ohio Law.
1975.74-492,0,27362,herbert_m_jacobson,,1604.233,1604.922,That is right.
1975.74-492,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1604.922,1606.711,But does it make any difference in your case?
1975.74-492,0,27362,herbert_m_jacobson,,1606.711,1622.402,"Yes, we feel that a parole officer is separate completely from the type of work, from the background training he gets from his position, as day as to night."
1975.74-492,1,33060,jack_t_schwarz,,1868.935,1870.395,I do not believe I did your Honor.
1975.74-492,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1871.156,1889.04,"And in your brief you do not raise the question that Ohio has decided this case on the basis of the Ohio Constitution and I suppose that is because you are following the Ohio rule, perhaps that the syllabus is the controlling law?"
1975.74-492,1,33060,jack_t_schwarz,,1889.04,1893.177,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1975.74-492,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1893.177,1894.333,May I get an answer?
1975.74-492,1,33060,jack_t_schwarz,,1894.333,1895.648,"Yes sir, I am going to answer that right now."
1975.74-492,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1895.648,1896.886,All right.
1975.74-492,1,33060,jack_t_schwarz,,1896.886,1898.486,I believe I was appointed --
1975.74-492,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1898.486,1903.733,I have here a copy of the brief of respondent posing writ of certiorari.
1975.74-492,1,33060,jack_t_schwarz,,1903.733,1917.869,"I was about to say, I believe, I was appointed and then I filed a typed and Xeroxed brief but I did not file any printed type of response to that."
1975.74-492,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1926.289,1934.743,"Well, if it is on a state basis, I guess you would say that this Court has no jurisdiction, is that not so?"
1975.74-492,1,33060,jack_t_schwarz,,1934.743,1936.204,Yes sir.
1975.74-492,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1936.204,1937.787,We have no power I should say?
1975.74-492,1,33060,jack_t_schwarz,,1937.787,1938.238,Yes sir.
1975.74-492,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1938.238,1944.473,"We have no jurisdiction because we granted the writ but we do not have power to construe the Ohio Constitution, you would agree?"
1975.74-492,1,33060,jack_t_schwarz,,1944.473,1945.807,That is correct sir.
1975.74-492,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1945.807,1968.332,"If the Court should so decide and I emphasize the 'if', that this case should be remanded to the Ohio Supreme Court under the (Inaudible) holding of this Court requiring them, requesting them to state whether they decided this on Federal or State grounds that would suit your purposes, I take it?"
1975.74-492,1,33060,jack_t_schwarz,,1968.332,1973.053,Yes sir.
1975.74-492,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1973.053,1976.719,You may proceed if you have anything further.
1975.74-492,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1976.719,1985.57,"Or if we should just dismiss the writ because we determined that it was decided on both State/Federal grounds that would suit your purposes even better, would it not?"
1975.74-492,1,33060,jack_t_schwarz,,1985.57,1988.416,Yes sir.[Laughter]
1975.74-492,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1988.416,1997.953,"I suppose, we have the power to read the opinion and not be bound by the Ohio rule of the law of the case is the syllabus."
1975.74-492,1,33060,jack_t_schwarz,,2000.621,2004.133,I think this Court in determining that question has to consider the Ohio.
1975.74-492,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2006.761,2016.503,"We held that -- that we most recognized that the Ohio Law, that the law of the case is the syllabus, we held so, in Beck against Ohio."
1975.74-492,1,33060,jack_t_schwarz,,2016.503,2016.631,I might say –-
1975.74-492,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2016.631,2019.131,"Still it does not tell us anything on this question, does it?"
1975.74-492,1,33060,jack_t_schwarz,,2021.651,2022.933,That is correct.
1975.74-492,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2022.933,2031.61,"It indicates that this is a question so far as the Ohio Supreme Court goes, the law of evidence and the law of criminal law of Ohio."
1975.74-492,1,33060,jack_t_schwarz,,2031.61,2033.004,Right.
1975.74-492,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2033.004,2038.638,Is there an Ohio syllabus heading called constitutional law?
1975.74-492,1,33060,jack_t_schwarz,,2038.638,2042.009,Yes there is.[Laughter]
1975.74-492,1,33060,jack_t_schwarz,,2042.009,2044.72,"You mean State or Federal, Your Honor?"
1975.74-492,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2044.72,2045.851,May I ask you this?
1975.74-492,1,33060,jack_t_schwarz,,2045.851,2046.298,Yes.
1975.74-492,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2046.298,2053.708,I know that the Supreme Court of Ohio itself prepares the so-called syllabus.
1975.74-492,1,33060,jack_t_schwarz,,2075.324,2079.295,I assume that the person who prints that in the Ohio Bar does that.
1975.74-492,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2079.295,2080.237,The reporter?
1975.74-492,1,33060,jack_t_schwarz,,2080.237,2080.59,Yes sir.
1975.74-492,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2080.59,2081.818,Or the editor?
1975.74-492,1,33060,jack_t_schwarz,,2082.447,2084.239,The editor and not the Court.
1975.74-492,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2088.274,2094.467,"Well, the syllabus that Court writes and then an individual Justice writes an opinion, is that right?"
1975.74-492,1,33060,jack_t_schwarz,,2094.467,2095.071,Yes sir.
1975.74-492,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2095.071,2096.26,"I guess, that is the way it is."
1975.74-492,1,33060,jack_t_schwarz,,2096.26,2099.043,I think in this case that they were both written by the same person.
1975.74-492,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2099.043,2104.362,They generally have --
1975.74-492,1,33060,jack_t_schwarz,,2104.362,2106.258,Thank you sir.
1975.74-492,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2256.691,2276.264,"Well, did the Supreme Court of Ohio hold that the rights waiver was ineffective for purposes of even the police interrogation or did they hold that these man statements were induced by a promise of leniency, those would be two quite different things, I would think."
1975.74-492,1,33060,jack_t_schwarz,,2276.264,2286.517,The Ohio Supreme Court held that the defendant operated under a promise of leniency in accordance with the Trial Court.
1975.74-492,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2296.82,2304.612,But they were inadmissible then not for failure to give Miranda warnings but for the misplaced promise of leniency?
1975.74-492,1,33060,jack_t_schwarz,,2304.612,2317.951,"That is correct after the waiver was in fact signed then the promises of leniency were made and it was subsequent to that, that the parole officer made his first visit to the man who was then incarcerated in the date in jail."
1975.74-492,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2317.951,2324.048,But why were not the original Miranda Warnings given by the police good enough for the parole officer’s visit?
1975.74-492,1,33060,jack_t_schwarz,,2324.048,2333.94,"Because subsequent to that time, promises of leniency had been made to him by the police in order to obtain admissions against interest."
1975.74-492,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2344.939,2352.303,What about the facts whether he knew all of what a Miranda warning would tell him?
1975.74-492,1,33060,jack_t_schwarz,,2355.849,2356.34,I think the --
1975.74-492,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2356.34,2362.354,"Having had the warning, why did he need another one if he knew what it would say?"
1975.74-492,1,33060,jack_t_schwarz,,2362.354,2369.988,Because that warning had an effect then vitiated and had been made null and void by the subsequent promises of leniency.
1975.74-492,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2369.988,2372.187,You mean that washed it out of his mind?
1975.74-492,1,33060,jack_t_schwarz,,2372.187,2387.447,"No sir but I think the decision in Miranda versus Arizona states that even if a lawyer were in fact arrested, he would be entitled to have these warnings read and I assume the lawyer would know his rights to have counsel and remain silent."
1975.74-492,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2387.447,2398.918,"But I do not see how a promise of leniency could somehow erase the effect of previous warning that you have a right to remain silent, the right to have a lawyer, I do not see how that has any connection."
1975.74-492,1,33060,jack_t_schwarz,,2398.918,2411.87,"It is my position that the connection is in the mind of the person who has been given the promises, having already made statements against interest that he has no way of knowing what would be kept our the trial."
1975.74-492,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2416.806,2422.402,Assume that he may have got anther set of Miranda warning under your hypothesis?
1975.74-492,1,33060,jack_t_schwarz,,2422.402,2423.463,Under that hypothesis.
1975.74-492,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2445.339,2466.279,"Mr. Schwartz, returning to the Miranda issue, is it your position that whenever a parole officer interviews his parolee and he moves into questioning that relates to another crime that the per se Miranda rule applies?"
1975.74-492,1,33060,jack_t_schwarz,,2466.279,2467.218,Yes sir.
1975.74-492,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2467.218,2480.771,"In other words, no question whatever as to whether or not the state may have been entirely voluntary, and not freewill under the circumstances?"
1975.74-492,1,33060,jack_t_schwarz,,2480.771,2497.662,"Yes sir, excuse me, I think in the situation it is even more important that the parole officer gave the warnings because that parolee may rely upon some confidential relationship which we all know does not exist in the law."
1975.74-492,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2497.662,2509.922,"It can also be your view, I take it that the parole officer was visiting the parolee in the parolee’s residence in an environment that was not normally regarded as cohesive?"
1975.74-492,1,33060,jack_t_schwarz,,2509.922,2510.334,No sir.
1975.74-492,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2515.087,2526.15,Are you aware that in Ohio could parole be revoked for the failure of the parolee to cooperate with his parole officer?
1975.74-492,1,33060,jack_t_schwarz,,2526.15,2526.822,No sir.
1975.74-492,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2526.822,2527.52,It could not?
1975.74-492,1,33060,jack_t_schwarz,,2527.52,2532.629,I do not think it could without a formal hearing and some other justification other than refusing to talk.
1975.74-492,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2532.629,2534.567,Let us assume a formal hearing?
1975.74-492,1,33060,jack_t_schwarz,,2534.567,2535.428,Assuming formal hearing --
1975.74-492,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2535.428,2552.824,"Assuming formal hearing it developed that he refused to answer questions of the parole officer about the commission of criminal act while on parole and certainly in Ohio, I would assume that after a hearing, parole would be revoked on that ground, would it not?"
1975.74-492,1,33060,jack_t_schwarz,,2552.824,2557.205,I do not think so if that case were pending and ready to go to trial.
1975.74-492,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2559.668,2569.81,"Oh! Yes, but it may be that you would say the whatever the parolee says, this parole officer may not be admissible in a separate criminal prosecution?"
1975.74-492,1,33060,jack_t_schwarz,,2569.81,2570.356,That is correct sir.
1975.74-492,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2570.356,2583.37,"Let us suppose that the only thing that Sykes' testimony was used for in this case was for revocation of parole, you would not suggest, it was not admissible for that purpose would you?"
1975.74-492,1,33060,jack_t_schwarz,,2583.37,2584.0,No sir.
1975.74-492,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2584.0,2586.163,I think that is an entirely different situation.
1975.74-492,1,33060,jack_t_schwarz,,2601.967,2608.192,Crimes other than the one for which he is on parole and at which the officer may testify.
1975.74-492,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2608.192,2627.66,"Well, is it your view that in the formal hearing on parole revocation, forget about another trial but in a formal hearing on parole revocation that the statements made by the subject to parole officer are not admissible even in the parole hearing, unless he had a Miranda warning?"
1975.74-492,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2627.66,2629.168,"No, he said they were admissible."
1975.74-492,1,33060,jack_t_schwarz,,2629.168,2631.63,"No, I said they would be admissible in that case."
1975.74-492,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2631.63,2633.682,And I misunderstood your response.
1975.74-492,1,33060,jack_t_schwarz,,2633.682,2636.852,But not after subsequent trial for the subsequent trial.
1975.74-492,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2636.852,2646.993,In other words the bar that you want to put up is that the man simply cannot testify in a court with reference to that trial for that particular crime?
1975.74-492,1,33060,jack_t_schwarz,,2646.993,2649.923,That is correct sir.
1975.74-492,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2651.394,2652.162,Thank you gentlemen.
