2007.06-10119,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.998,"We'll hear argument next in case 06-10119, Synder v. Louisiana."
2007.06-10119,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,8.56,23.602,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The decision here of the majority of the Louisiana Supreme Court on remand from this Court is an extraordinary departure from the lessons that this Court taught in its Miller-El decisions."
2007.06-10119,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,136.214,137.714,Can I ask you about one of the factors?
2007.06-10119,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,137.714,138.151,--Sure.
2007.06-10119,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,138.151,140.447,It's hard to discuss them all at the same time.
2007.06-10119,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,175.244,177.118,"Well, I see."
2007.06-10119,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,179.853,180.337,That's right.
2007.06-10119,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,180.337,181.227,There's a common reason.
2007.06-10119,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,193.66,202.968,You are making the argument there were five African-American jurors who were the subject of prosecutorial peremptory challenges.
2007.06-10119,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,202.968,203.453,--Yes.
2007.06-10119,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,203.453,209.716,And... but you don't claim that three of those strikes were based on race?
2007.06-10119,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,210.216,212.23,"Well, no different than Miller-El."
2007.06-10119,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,217.838,220.743,There were a large number of strikes in Miller-El.
2007.06-10119,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,229.52,235.847,"Well, the difference is that as in Miller-El it is unlikely to happen by happenstance."
2007.06-10119,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,263.648,268.24,I think that's right that you zero in on the ones as to which you objected.
2007.06-10119,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,289.028,294.543,"--Well, part of the reason they weren't struck, Mr. Chief Justice, was one of the elements of race here."
2007.06-10119,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,318.691,334.355,"Couldn't counsel at that point have gone back and said, ah, now I see what's going on, so I'm going to challenge... I'm going to interpose a Batson challenge with respect to the second and third African-American?"
2007.06-10119,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,334.355,336.293,Or actually the first and second.
2007.06-10119,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,358.955,362.454,Presumably because no objection was raised as to Mr. Hawkins.
2007.06-10119,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,367.764,382.055,"--Well, but the only thing we're putting the pattern forward for is step three of Batson, where both Miller-El decisions make it quite clear that if the numbers are such that it is unlikely to happen by happenstance, that's one element."
2007.06-10119,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,415.135,417.197,Out of... out of how many who were struck.
2007.06-10119,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,417.197,417.791,Ten.
2007.06-10119,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,447.233,461.101,"The district judge is in a much better position to decide those matters, such as you know, he... his... his response was... was slow on... one the question of, you know, whether he could consider the death penalty."
2007.06-10119,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,466.803,469.224,"--Well, that was with regard to Ms. Scott."
2007.06-10119,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,469.224,469.614,Right.
2007.06-10119,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,469.614,475.565,"Justice Scalia, there... only one juror here was ambivalent about the death penalty, said she wasn't sure."
2007.06-10119,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,518.611,521.437,"Well, I'm looking at... at the joint appendix on page 360."
2007.06-10119,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,525.733,527.186,Right.
2007.06-10119,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,527.716,528.45,"Ms. Dupont says,"
2007.06-10119,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,543.617,547.866,"Well, then, just a couple of pages later, Mr. Chief Justice, she says I could."
2007.06-10119,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,549.802,551.629,That's on joint appendix 401?
2007.06-10119,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,551.629,552.332,--Yes.
2007.06-10119,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,552.332,555.096,"And... and the problem with that, of course, is it's--"
2007.06-10119,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,555.096,557.689,I'm sorry.
2007.06-10119,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,558.689,559.97,--367.
2007.06-10119,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,559.97,562.157,She says 361.
2007.06-10119,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,566.857,570.637,"Well, but... the question is not could you consider the death penalty."
2007.06-10119,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,576.494,578.04,Well--
2007.06-10119,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,578.04,585.178,"And I thought that was... the point was made by your friend on the other side, was that it was ambiguous as to what option she was saying she could consider."
2007.06-10119,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,585.178,587.881,"--Well, I'd invite the Court to look at that."
2007.06-10119,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,627.224,630.676,"Well, these are peremptory challenges."
2007.06-10119,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,640.593,644.732,"--But Justice Scalia, there's no reason you wouldn't ask them what they meant."
2007.06-10119,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,666.176,669.176,Did all 21 say I think I could?
2007.06-10119,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,669.176,670.347,--No.
2007.06-10119,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,695.227,700.367,"Mr. Bright, you make good arguments about comparisons between white jurors and black jurors."
2007.06-10119,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,700.367,701.428,Yes.
2007.06-10119,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,701.428,710.19,What do we do with the comparisons that you are making now to white jurors who were never brought to the attention of the Louisiana Supreme Court?
2007.06-10119,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,710.19,717.469,"Well, I think Miller-El, again, answers that, because the entire voir dire was before the Louisiana Supreme Court."
2007.06-10119,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,744.911,750.721,"I think you have a good argument in comparing him to some of the white jurors, in particular Mr. Laws."
2007.06-10119,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,750.721,751.22,Right.
2007.06-10119,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,751.22,756.437,But my understanding is you never relied on Mr. Laws before the Louisiana Supreme Court.
2007.06-10119,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,756.999,762.686,"Not Mr. Laws specifically, but you can look at the other people that are mentioned in Justice Kimball's dissent."
2007.06-10119,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,768.48,772.118,But the arguments as to each of them are different.
2007.06-10119,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,778.225,779.397,--Well--
2007.06-10119,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,779.397,786.658,So that's quite different from somebody... it could be quite different from someone like Mr. Brooks or Mr. Laws.
2007.06-10119,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,787.049,799.56,"--Actually the reason they say they're concerned about Mr. Brooks is because he was told, your dean says it won't be a problem."
2007.06-10119,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,827.814,830.236,I don't understand how the dean could resolve his problem.
2007.06-10119,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,830.236,831.344,"--Well, he's the dean."
2007.06-10119,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,834.061,842.34,"The man's problem, what he's worried about is that he has to put in a certain number of hours of teaching."
2007.06-10119,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,846.292,847.089,"No, this was in August."
2007.06-10119,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,860.255,861.02,--Whatever.
2007.06-10119,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,868.345,870.329,Well--
2007.06-10119,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,870.329,872.797,The hours requirement is a requirement for the degree.
2007.06-10119,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,878.482,881.419,"--Well, with all due respect, Your Honor--"
2007.06-10119,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,881.419,884.183,"Maybe the dean was just saying oh, he'll be able to do it, and--"
2007.06-10119,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,884.183,884.542,--Well--
2007.06-10119,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,884.542,888.994,"--that wouldn't inspire a great deal of confidence in me, even if I said okay."
2007.06-10119,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,888.994,891.524,"--Well, again, it would have only taken one question."
2007.06-10119,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,900.958,904.33,My reaction would be... would depend on how he said okay.
2007.06-10119,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,922.573,923.011,--If--
2007.06-10119,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,923.011,923.214,If--
2007.06-10119,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,923.214,924.089,"--If I could answer that question, Mr. Chief Justice."
2007.06-10119,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,944.799,954.732,"--With Brooks, what he said when he said I'm missing right now something that will better me towards my teaching career, and they say... and the judge says, is there anybody who could speak to it?"
2007.06-10119,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,961.948,962.448,--Well--
2007.06-10119,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,962.448,964.838,"Then the judge calls the dean, and of course the dean's going to--"
2007.06-10119,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,964.838,965.166,--No problem.
2007.06-10119,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,965.166,967.914,"--Well, that's what he's going to say to the judge."
2007.06-10119,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,973.678,975.802,Brooks doesn't say there's a problem.
2007.06-10119,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,978.255,978.863,He says I'm missing right now--
2007.06-10119,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,978.863,979.597,--Something that--
2007.06-10119,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,979.597,981.909,--Something that could help me out towards my teaching career.
2007.06-10119,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,981.909,982.425,--Sure.
2007.06-10119,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1020.174,1024.564,I don't understand your answer that Mr. Brooks did not say there was a problem.
2007.06-10119,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,1036.605,1046.069,"Well, he... he's saying, again, not knowing how long this is going to last, or what's going to be expected of him... right now I'm missing something to help my education."
2007.06-10119,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1073.137,1075.652,"Even if the assurance is only secondhand, right?"
2007.06-10119,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,1075.652,1077.261,"Well, I think when the judge--"
2007.06-10119,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1077.261,1079.134,"When the dean says it's okay, that's all right."
2007.06-10119,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,1079.134,1087.35,"--The judge of the court, the presiding judicial officer there, says we've talked to your dean, and it's not going to be a problem for you to be here this week."
2007.06-10119,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1164.32,1165.225,"Well, suppose you are trying this case."
2007.06-10119,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,1206.927,1215.112,"--Well, I think you have to look not only at those answers but... but what the court in Miller-El II said were the side-by-side comparisons."
2007.06-10119,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1253.143,1262.576,"Mr. Bright, the Judge was quite passive, and was... was the judge, in fact, present throughout the entire voir dire?"
2007.06-10119,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,1262.576,1268.731,"I... I think the judge was present, but he was quite passive."
2007.06-10119,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1285.457,1287.457,It sounds like the right answer to me.
2007.06-10119,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,1289.3,1291.861,It wasn't the right question.
2007.06-10119,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1384.982,1391.433,"Mr. Bright, may I ask, in your judgment, was all the reference to O. J. Simpson relevant at all to what is before us?"
2007.06-10119,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,1391.433,1402.725,"I think it is, Justice Stevens, and I think, even if you don't look at the closing argument, which tells you two important things... first of all, the prosecutor broke his promise to the judge that he wouldn't mention it."
2007.06-10119,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1407.349,1408.394,What does that have to do with anything?
2007.06-10119,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,1408.394,1408.925,It has to do with--
2007.06-10119,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1408.925,1409.566,So he broke his promise.
2007.06-10119,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,1415.751,1421.671,"--It has to do with his credibility, which is very much what Batson is about."
2007.06-10119,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1455.142,1464.95,What about the explanation that was given that this was referring to the defendant's feigning emotional distress rather than anything to do with race?
2007.06-10119,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,1464.95,1469.37,"Well, I think, Chief Justice Roberts, it doesn't have anything to do with that."
2007.06-10119,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1469.37,1471.166,What doesn't have anything to do with it?
2007.06-10119,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,1471.166,1486.676,"The fact of whether or not Mr. Snyder was, in fact, suicidal is not rebutted in any way by bringing in the most racially polarizing case in the country and saying that Simpson was trying to get away with it."
2007.06-10119,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1486.676,1488.707,"--Well, that's not just racially polarizing."
2007.06-10119,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,1495.594,1496.141,Yes.
2007.06-10119,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1496.141,1496.875,The same as here.
2007.06-10119,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,1496.875,1500.78,"Well, there are a lot of similarities."
2007.06-10119,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1500.78,1511.978,"And then feigned a mental illness by his... his great-escape escapade, and that is... that is what the prosecutor said he was trying to bring before the jury."
2007.06-10119,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,1511.978,1514.087,Well... and he said Simpson got away with it.
2007.06-10119,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1557.695,1561.77,So the relief you are requesting goes only to the penalty and not to the conviction?
2007.06-10119,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,1561.77,1563.864,"No, Chief Justice Roberts."
2007.06-10119,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1573.907,1578.046,Even though... even though your theory is that it was only with respect to the penalty that the bias... you have no allegation--
2007.06-10119,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,1578.046,1578.468,"--Oh, no."
2007.06-10119,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1578.468,1584.137,--that this jury did not return a valid conviction.
2007.06-10119,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,1589.682,1590.275,No.
2007.06-10119,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1628.713,1629.244,"Thank you, Mr. Bright."
2007.06-10119,1,42429,terry_m_boudreaux,,1641.285,1653.203,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I had some prepared remarks to begin with, but I think I'd like to go straight into responding to some of the concerns that have just been raised."
2007.06-10119,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1686.972,1688.018,As to life imprisonment or as to the death penalty?
2007.06-10119,1,42429,terry_m_boudreaux,,1688.018,1689.08,"--As to life imprisonment, Your Honor."
2007.06-10119,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1699.45,1700.95,Where is this?
2007.06-10119,1,42429,terry_m_boudreaux,,1702.807,1704.979,"--Beginning at 364 of the joint appendix, Your Honor."
2007.06-10119,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1711.306,1711.82,--Right.
2007.06-10119,1,42429,terry_m_boudreaux,,1711.82,1717.411,"She was originally asked the question about the death penalty, and her response was the ""I think I could""."
2007.06-10119,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1717.411,1726.877,"Mr. Bright contrasts that with the more probing inquiry with respect to white jurors who said ""I think I could"", and here there was no follow-up."
2007.06-10119,1,42429,terry_m_boudreaux,,1726.877,1732.172,"That's true, Your Honor."
2007.06-10119,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1748.336,1752.351,The explanation for Mr. Brooks is not terribly convincing on its face.
2007.06-10119,1,42429,terry_m_boudreaux,,1758.941,1759.441,"Yes, sir."
2007.06-10119,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1759.441,1765.986,"And the concern... the major concern about him is that he's going to worry about missing Wednesday, Thursday, Friday student teaching?"
2007.06-10119,1,42429,terry_m_boudreaux,,1765.986,1766.674,"Yes, sir."
2007.06-10119,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1767.58,1772.312,"But you compare him to some of the white jurors, particularly, I think, Mr. Laws."
2007.06-10119,1,42429,terry_m_boudreaux,,1789.289,1793.568,"--Yes, sir."
2007.06-10119,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1819.933,1824.852,Mr. Laws was an identical... he came up too.
2007.06-10119,1,42429,terry_m_boudreaux,,1825.305,1834.505,"--He did come up, and I think the distinction there, Your Honor, is that like several of others, unlike Mr. Brooks, in the end he said"
2007.06-10119,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1835.753,1837.097,Can I go back to Ms. Scott?
2007.06-10119,1,42429,terry_m_boudreaux,,1837.097,1837.581,I'm sorry.
2007.06-10119,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1837.581,1838.768,Could I go back to Ms. Scott?
2007.06-10119,1,42429,terry_m_boudreaux,,1838.768,1839.331,Ms. Scott?
2007.06-10119,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1839.331,1840.018,Yes.
2007.06-10119,1,42429,terry_m_boudreaux,,1907.227,1907.884,I don't--
2007.06-10119,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1907.884,1911.975,"But I haven't noticed in anybody's opinion, so far, making that point that you just made."
2007.06-10119,1,42429,terry_m_boudreaux,,1911.975,1915.536,"--I would submit that... that would indicate ambiguity, Your Honor, that the prosecutor starts off with the life imprisonment question, and then it sort of morphed into a death penalty."
2007.06-10119,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1922.783,1929.405,"No... well, there's... I just read you what it was, so I guess people make up their own mind about that."
2007.06-10119,1,42429,terry_m_boudreaux,,1985.102,1985.805,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2007.06-10119,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1986.258,1986.789,And a slight hesitation.
2007.06-10119,1,42429,terry_m_boudreaux,,1987.633,1994.581,--One of the weaknesses in some these jurors is a lack of follow-up questions.
2007.06-10119,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2000.517,2002.423,"And that, of course, is a problem I have generally in this area."
2007.06-10119,1,42429,terry_m_boudreaux,,2023.179,2032.614,"--In the totality of her responses, the ones that were heard which are on the record and the ones which were not heard which are not on the record, the prosecutor felt that she was weak on the death penalty."
2007.06-10119,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2035.55,2040.393,"Well, of course... sorry."
2007.06-10119,1,42429,terry_m_boudreaux,,2040.393,2051.029,"Well, I would just say that the... we're talking here with the prosecutor's perception of the juror based on her answers and the the trial court's perception in evaluating the prosecutor's proper race-neutral reasons."
2007.06-10119,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2073.538,2082.096,"There... there isn't much reason, is there, to think that the trial court was being very critical of the prosecutor's answers?"
2007.06-10119,1,42429,terry_m_boudreaux,,2111.944,2121.768,"--I would... I would suppose not, Your Honor."
2007.06-10119,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2122.299,2123.485,And because--
2007.06-10119,1,42429,terry_m_boudreaux,,2123.485,2124.126,The objection was--
2007.06-10119,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2124.126,2146.65,"--And because you suppose not and I certainly suppose not, the... the fact is that we have to... we have to consider the O. J. Simpson remark in trying to evaluate what went on, in trying to evaluate, for example, the lack of critical follow-up in... in a disparate way by the prosecutor."
2007.06-10119,1,42429,terry_m_boudreaux,,2152.132,2152.585,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2007.06-10119,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2162.891,2168.045,"Do you believe that, if there had been a white defendant here, the O. J. Simpson case would have been mentioned?"
2007.06-10119,1,42429,terry_m_boudreaux,,2168.045,2170.608,"Yes, Your Honor, and I believe if the O.J. Simpson case--"
2007.06-10119,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2170.608,2178.135,"See, I'd be candid... I will be candid to say to you, under the... under the circumstances of the record in front of us, I find that highly unlikely."
2007.06-10119,1,42429,terry_m_boudreaux,,2188.272,2188.569,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2007.06-10119,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2252.762,2268.99,"Mr. Boudreaux, even if... even if you're correct that a neutral explanation was given focusing on the emotional distress, are you... do you think the prosecutor would have made the analogy if there had been a black juror on the jury?"
2007.06-10119,1,42429,terry_m_boudreaux,,2268.99,2274.8,"I think he would have, Your Honor."
2007.06-10119,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2331.511,2345.505,"--Before... before the rebuttal, this prosecutor was going around advertising this as his O. J. Simpson case, and the defense attorney said please, Judge, get him to stop saying that."
2007.06-10119,1,42429,terry_m_boudreaux,,2364.702,2366.606,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2007.06-10119,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2366.606,2370.698,"Then he says I'm an officer of the court, and I'm giving you my word."
2007.06-10119,1,42429,terry_m_boudreaux,,2370.698,2383.007,"That's correct; and then he believes... despite his assurances, when the defense attorneys made the argument they made, they were inviting that... that response."
2007.06-10119,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2383.007,2405.373,"Well, do you... do you believe that it would have been appropriate at that point for the prosecutor to invoke in his argument any case from any state in which a criminal defendant had unsuccessfully feigned insanity as a reason to decide... for the jurors to decide that this defendant is... is feigning insanity?"
2007.06-10119,1,42429,terry_m_boudreaux,,2405.373,2412.496,I think any historical fact well known to people would have been fair game.
2007.06-10119,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2459.478,2461.43,Exactly.
2007.06-10119,1,42429,terry_m_boudreaux,,2464.631,2465.115,--Right.
2007.06-10119,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2465.115,2469.817,So I think you have two instances here.
2007.06-10119,2,40972,stephen_b_bright,,2484.233,2484.686,"Yes, sir."
2007.06-10119,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2484.686,2492.136,"What it says is the clerk called the dean and the dean said it he won't, don't worry about it, which Mr. Brook is then told."
2007.06-10119,3,42429,terry_m_boudreaux,,2536.883,2537.523,"Yes, Your Honor."
2007.06-10119,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2537.523,2555.424,"If you add them up, we have Ms. Scott we have Mr. Brooks, we have the mention of... and three others... three others, the only other three black people are challenged off, and we have the... no black juror us on and we have the references to O. J. Simpson beside."
2007.06-10119,3,42429,terry_m_boudreaux,,2559.359,2561.468,"Your characterizations are... are correct, Your Honor."
2007.06-10119,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2572.634,2573.29,"What's the difference between that and ""okay""?"
2007.06-10119,3,42429,terry_m_boudreaux,,2573.29,2574.461,I'm sorry?
2007.06-10119,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2575.649,2581.256,"One says I can make arrangements, and the other is more economical and he says ""okay""."
2007.06-10119,3,42429,terry_m_boudreaux,,2581.256,2585.957,"But that... he said... I think that's the landscape man, he said, as long as it wasn't a prolonged... as."
2007.06-10119,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2585.957,2586.754,"No, she means the dean."
2007.06-10119,3,42429,terry_m_boudreaux,,2587.457,2587.957,"Oh, the dean--"
2007.06-10119,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2587.957,2589.518,--said no problem at all.
2007.06-10119,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2590.893,2591.393,--meaning Brooks.
2007.06-10119,3,42429,terry_m_boudreaux,,2591.393,2592.143,--Brooks says--
2007.06-10119,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2592.143,2593.111,Brooks says okay.
2007.06-10119,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2593.111,2596.985,"The difference is between ""I can make arrangements"" and ""okay""."
2007.06-10119,3,42429,terry_m_boudreaux,,2596.985,2606.714,"--The difference... difference there, Your Honor, is that Mr. Brooks needs to make these classroom... undergraduate requirements to graduate."
2007.06-10119,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2634.188,2642.825,"Well, I wouldn't take it at face value if there had been a further question asked of Mr. Brooks saying, are you really satisfied you have nothing to worry about?"
2007.06-10119,3,42429,terry_m_boudreaux,,2649.665,2652.383,Nobody asked that question.
2007.06-10119,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2652.383,2654.038,"All we have is got is ""okay"" on the one hand and ""I can make arrangements"" on other."
2007.06-10119,3,42429,terry_m_boudreaux,,2654.038,2660.974,"We also have, Your Honor, as far as the question of Mr. Brooks is concerned, a fact that is not articulated by the prosecutor but which would be supported by the record."
2007.06-10119,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2682.215,2701.381,"Well, we... we have to go... your... this is enough of a fact-specific inquiry for any appellate court, even when we go into the allegations that the prosecution did make."
2007.06-10119,3,42429,terry_m_boudreaux,,2709.892,2710.58,--That's the problem with this record.
2007.06-10119,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2712.11,2713.391,--It is not the problem with it.
2007.06-10119,3,42429,terry_m_boudreaux,,2715.344,2719.046,--The plausibility of the prosecutor's reasons stand or fall on what he says.
2007.06-10119,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2744.91,2748.627,May I ask you about Juror Hawkins.
2007.06-10119,3,42429,terry_m_boudreaux,,2749.829,2750.344,--Hawkins?
2007.06-10119,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2750.344,2750.954,Why did they strike him?
2007.06-10119,3,42429,terry_m_boudreaux,,2753.734,2762.089,"Your Honor, that's a question I've asked myself; and I can't... I'm not... you would think on the surface of it he would have been a good juror for the State."
2007.06-10119,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2776.52,2782.175,Wasn't he struck before they back-struck the first black on the jury?
2007.06-10119,3,42429,terry_m_boudreaux,,2782.175,2783.956,"--I believe so, Your Honor."
2007.06-10119,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2783.956,2787.626,So that probably explains why they didn't make a Batson objection.
2007.06-10119,3,42429,terry_m_boudreaux,,2787.626,2788.75,"Yes, you're correct about that."
2007.06-10119,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2797.404,2798.529,I understand why the defense would have struck him.
2007.06-10119,3,42429,terry_m_boudreaux,,2800.59,2807.869,"Well, we don't know that, Your Honor, because there was no Batson objection raised, and the prosecutor was not called upon to articulate any reasons."
2007.06-10119,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2818.568,2823.347,He knew nothing about that juror except what Justice Stevens and you have just been reciting.
2007.06-10119,3,42429,terry_m_boudreaux,,2837.028,2844.245,"--Well, I can say, Your Honor, that's not the first time that's happened over years in different... different trials that I've reviewed."
2007.06-10119,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2844.245,2845.072,How about you?
2007.06-10119,3,42429,terry_m_boudreaux,,2845.072,2845.572,I'm sorry?
2007.06-10119,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2845.572,2846.697,Would you... would you have gotten rid of him?
2007.06-10119,3,42429,terry_m_boudreaux,,2850.087,2851.835,"No, Your Honor."
2007.06-10119,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2852.71,2853.803,"No, you wouldn't have, and neither would I."
2007.06-10119,3,42429,terry_m_boudreaux,,2853.803,2854.772,"--No, sir."
2007.06-10119,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2856.709,2859.349,We have no idea... we have no idea what this man looked like.
2007.06-10119,3,42429,terry_m_boudreaux,,2867.078,2867.375,--Right.
2007.06-10119,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2867.375,2869.953,But nobody asked what reason for doing it was.
2007.06-10119,3,42429,terry_m_boudreaux,,2869.953,2871.889,And no reasons were offered.
2007.06-10119,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2871.889,2875.778,I don't know the answer to this at all but how this is supposed to work?
2007.06-10119,3,42429,terry_m_boudreaux,,2918.84,2925.649,I would disagree they would not have a Batson claim to make when the first black is struck if they felt there was evidence of that one--
2007.06-10119,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2925.649,2926.79,They don't know.
2007.06-10119,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2926.79,2933.6,"The rule is not that you can't... so long as you have some black on the jury, you can strike the rest."
2007.06-10119,3,42429,terry_m_boudreaux,,2933.6,2933.865,"--No, sir."
2007.06-10119,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2933.865,2935.63,Any single person.
2007.06-10119,3,42429,terry_m_boudreaux,,2935.63,2936.021,That's correct.
2007.06-10119,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2936.021,2938.113,I'm speaking reality.
2007.06-10119,3,42429,terry_m_boudreaux,,2938.113,2940.191,That's why you don't have to wait for a pattern.
2007.06-10119,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2942.72,2947.672,I still have... I am curious to the answer to Justice Breyer's question.
2007.06-10119,3,42429,terry_m_boudreaux,,2958.573,2961.588,"They can go back and back strike, but the defendant could say--"
2007.06-10119,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2961.588,2964.883,They can go back and back strike.
2007.06-10119,3,42429,terry_m_boudreaux,,2964.883,2965.571,"--Yes, sir."
2007.06-10119,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2965.571,2971.101,They can go back and object to the back striking?
2007.06-10119,3,42429,terry_m_boudreaux,,2976.255,2980.894,The back strike is when is the challenge exercised.
2007.06-10119,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2984.813,2986.953,That was my question.
2007.06-10119,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2986.953,3000.182,"--My problem... after the back strike of the first black juror who had been accepted, can they thereafter renew an objection if the jurors two and three, who are accepted on the assumption that there would no--"
2007.06-10119,3,42429,terry_m_boudreaux,,3000.182,3006.96,I think under Miller-El and related decisions that would be part of the totality of the circumstances.
2007.06-10119,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3007.96,3009.366,That wasn't done here.
2007.06-10119,3,42429,terry_m_boudreaux,,3011.413,3011.99,--Yes.
2007.06-10119,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3011.99,3019.565,"When the third... the back strike of Brooks was made, they could have gone back for Hawkins and the others, but they didn't."
2007.06-10119,3,42429,terry_m_boudreaux,,3019.565,3024.641,That could have been argued evidence for them to make their prima facie case.
2007.06-10119,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3024.641,3025.422,I'm sorry.
2007.06-10119,3,42429,terry_m_boudreaux,,3047.523,3049.694,"To give you a yes or no answer, yes."
2007.06-10119,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3056.612,3060.158,"Still, the prosecutor is still there."
2007.06-10119,3,42429,terry_m_boudreaux,,3064.406,3065.655,"Yes, you could."
2007.06-10119,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3071.356,3072.419,Can I ask you one other question.
2007.06-10119,3,42429,terry_m_boudreaux,,3120.008,3122.773,"I wrote the brief, Your Honor, but I don't think... I don't remember."
2007.06-10119,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3122.773,3123.789,I thought that's why you might know.
2007.06-10119,3,42429,terry_m_boudreaux,,3125.147,3125.616,I don't remember.
2007.06-10119,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3125.616,3131.66,"I thought that, in reading it, it seems as if they are not, and I was thinking about how a judge can't think of everything."
2007.06-10119,3,42429,terry_m_boudreaux,,3136.674,3146.17,"You know to be honest, Justice Scalia's comment about looking at the record and saying oh, here is another reason that the prosecutor didn't articulate."
2007.06-10119,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3188.731,3193.151,"Mr. Boudreaux, I'd like to ask you a question before you finish."
2007.06-10119,3,42429,terry_m_boudreaux,,3213.049,3216.797,"Certainly pre-Katrina, Your Honor."
2007.06-10119,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3226.013,3233.227,That's... and because it's almost half of what you would expect.
2007.06-10119,3,42429,terry_m_boudreaux,,3233.227,3238.039,"Yes, and that's going to vary, you know, from venire to venire on any given day."
2007.06-10119,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3238.039,3242.241,Thank you.
2007.06-10119,3,42429,terry_m_boudreaux,,3242.241,3269.494,"In the minute or two I have left, Your Honors, I would just remind the Court, urge the Court to consider its recent opinion last June in Uttecht dealing with the deference due the trial court in these types of proceedings... that was a habeas case... what the opinion says to require on direct review, and according to the trial court, the deference having been present and not just relying on a cold record, that the Louisiana Supreme Court's ruling should be farmered."
2007.06-10119,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3269.494,3274.68,"Do you think the deference in Uttecht, which was the death qualified juror--"
2007.06-10119,3,42429,terry_m_boudreaux,,3274.68,3275.336,"Yes, sir."
2007.06-10119,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3275.336,3282.568,--should be any greater than in a Batson case where we have the sensitive issue of racial discrimination?
2007.06-10119,3,42429,terry_m_boudreaux,,3282.568,3287.159,"I'm not sure I understood the question, Your Honor."
2007.06-10119,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3287.159,3288.191,"Well, Uttecht--"
2007.06-10119,3,42429,terry_m_boudreaux,,3288.191,3288.987,Whether it's going to the issue--
2007.06-10119,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3288.987,3290.784,--Uttecht was a death qualified juror--
2007.06-10119,3,42429,terry_m_boudreaux,,3290.784,3291.487,--Yes.
2007.06-10119,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3291.487,3292.923,--and this is a Batson case.
2007.06-10119,3,42429,terry_m_boudreaux,,3292.923,3293.611,"Right, and it--"
2007.06-10119,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3293.611,3302.138,"Because of our concerns in the Batson area, do you think we're entitled to have a different standard of deference for the trial court?"
2007.06-10119,3,42429,terry_m_boudreaux,,3302.997,3303.341,--No.
2007.06-10119,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3304.154,3304.996,--We haven't discussed this--
2007.06-10119,3,42429,terry_m_boudreaux,,3304.996,3305.621,--of a factfinder.
2007.06-10119,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3325.8,3326.409,"Thank you, Mr. Boudreaux."
2007.06-10119,4,40972,stephen_b_bright,,3328.549,3330.393,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2007.06-10119,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3423.448,3440.144,"Do you agree with your friend on the other side, that you could have objected both to the backstruck juror and to the jurors to whom you... with respect to whom you did not object because there was... the juror that was later backstruck on the jury?"
2007.06-10119,4,40972,stephen_b_bright,,3440.144,3441.222,--I... I think yes.
2007.06-10119,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3462.026,3463.869,Although you could have made an objection.
2007.06-10119,4,40972,stephen_b_bright,,3469.929,3470.522,They would.
2007.06-10119,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3470.522,3471.882,--So what could you--
2007.06-10119,4,40972,stephen_b_bright,,3471.882,3472.99,So they're gone.
2007.06-10119,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3476.067,3486.485,The objection would have afforded the state an opportunity to present the... if there was one... the non-racial reason THAT they struck the juror.
2007.06-10119,4,40972,stephen_b_bright,,3486.485,3493.513,--But the reason for doing that would be to have the judge not allow the strike and to put that juror in the box and the juror' gone now.
2007.06-10119,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3498.012,3503.354,"Another reason to do it would be to preserve your right on appeal, to object to those jurors."
2007.06-10119,4,40972,stephen_b_bright,,3503.354,3508.461,--But there's no procedural rule in Louisiana that says you have to do that.
2007.06-10119,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3511.834,3526.782,Maybe your rule here that... that we're not going to postulate the worst reason for a prosecutorial strike rather than a good reason when you haven't given the prosecution an opportunity to set forth a good reason.
2007.06-10119,4,40972,stephen_b_bright,,3526.782,3528.172,If I may answer.
2007.06-10119,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3553.006,3553.849,"Thank you, Mr. Bright."
