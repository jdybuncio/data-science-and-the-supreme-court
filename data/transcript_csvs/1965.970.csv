1965.970,1,26738,hammond_e_chaffetz,,1866.374,1870.781,"Mr. Chief Justice, if it please the Court."
1965.970,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1944.318,1950.049,"Well, all the way it looks that read out to me, but you thought so -- ."

1965.970,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1955.926,1959.297,"Well, do you agree with the Senate report or not?"
1965.970,1,26738,hammond_e_chaffetz,,1959.297,1966.201,I think what it means is that the Federal Trade Commission asked that probably suggest that probably does bring its own into Senate proceeding.
1965.970,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1967.09,1974.567,"I suppose it could do that then the suit could just sit there, couldn't it if they got a new temporary injunction?"

1965.970,1,26738,hammond_e_chaffetz,,2205.305,2218.701,"I thought it was, I thought that was really two years, the closing date was really January 3, we postponed the closing date by agreement by January 10, and to close the opportunity to file proceeding in the Court and give the Court the chance to consider."
1965.970,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2218.701,2228.792,"You didn't really, what shall I say hope that the Trade Commission would relinquish jurisdiction to the Department of Justice."

1965.970,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2422.163,2424.842,(Inaudible)
1965.970,1,26738,hammond_e_chaffetz,,2424.842,2425.586,"Yes, there were."

1965.970,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2583.26,2586.563,(Inaudible)
1965.970,1,26738,hammond_e_chaffetz,,2586.563,2598.051,"When you have 37, if you realize Your Honor, the aggressive program, the aggressive program of the Federal Trade Commission over these 12 years, every single year they were present and they were these hearings."
1965.970,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2695.605,2699.558,You don't -- you disagree with Transamerica case?
1965.970,1,26738,hammond_e_chaffetz,,2699.558,2703.333,I disagree with Transamerica case is also -- I also think it's highly distinguishable.
1965.970,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2753.147,2755.976,So that was the perfectly sound decision?
1965.970,1,26738,hammond_e_chaffetz,,2755.976,2760.842,"No, I think the Second Circuit said it was an erroneous decision."
1965.970,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2900.301,2901.914,May I get back to one moment Mr. Chaffetz.

1965.970,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2911.029,2913.356,"-- and you used the standing argument, is that it?"
1965.970,1,26738,hammond_e_chaffetz,,2913.356,2922.506,"Well, I say that there's no question here of protecting the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals because no problem of ouster of jurisdiction."
1965.970,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2932.71,2936.997,"I'm sorry, I'm not quite sure, I follow a chat."
1965.970,1,26738,hammond_e_chaffetz,,2941.516,2950.531,"No, I say this does turn on whether Congress consciously withheld from the Commission, the right to bring this very proceeding."
1965.970,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2958.259,2959.726,I won't say withheld --

1965.970,1,26738,hammond_e_chaffetz,,2964.536,2965.261,I think it does.
1965.970,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2982.841,2990.995,"So, the federal -- so the Court does not have jurisdiction to grant an injunction that the suit for the Federal Trade Commission?"
1965.970,1,26738,hammond_e_chaffetz,,2990.995,2991.409,That's right.

1965.970,1,26738,hammond_e_chaffetz,,2995.178,2996.405,No question about it.
1965.970,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2997.568,2999.28,I see.
1965.970,1,26738,hammond_e_chaffetz,,3001.617,3003.652,If the District Court does not have jurisdiction --
1965.970,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3003.652,3004.657,(Voice Overlap)
1965.970,1,26738,hammond_e_chaffetz,,3004.657,3006.973,"-- the Court of Appeals does not have jurisdiction, no, that's right."

1965.970,1,26738,hammond_e_chaffetz,,3041.03,3063.829,We initially put the closing the date far enough ahead so the agencies of the Government would have ample opportunity to decide what action they want to take if any and so that if they decided to proceed in the Court which would mean the Department of Justice proceeding filing its own action in the District Court and if the case was pending at the time of the closing we would have it out.
1965.970,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,3088.818,3093.699,Was that after the complaint was filed under the commission or before?

1965.970,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3302.849,3305.261,(Inaudible)
1965.970,1,26738,hammond_e_chaffetz,,3305.261,3308.985,(Inaudible) like all of the others is going into the business themselves.

1965.970,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3392.809,3408.514,"Mr. Chaffetz, did the Trade Commission ask the parties to enter into an economist stipulation which would provide a means for divestiture in the even that this -- that they showed its order?"
1965.970,1,26738,hammond_e_chaffetz,,3408.514,3409.651,Not in those terms.
1965.970,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3410.667,3411.523,"Well, what -- what --"

1965.970,1,26738,hammond_e_chaffetz,,3446.447,3447.539,"No, they wouldn't (Voice Overlap) --"
1965.970,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3447.539,3448.993,(Voice Overlap)

1965.970,1,26738,hammond_e_chaffetz,,3464.007,3475.127,And we couldn't do that because that was breaking the back of Bowman and would've broken our back and Mr. Justice Clark recognized that promptly and we got the relief on that from this Court not from the Federal Trade Commission.
1965.970,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3476.464,3484.063,"Well, regardless of whose back was broken or not broken, did they propose to you such stipulation?"
