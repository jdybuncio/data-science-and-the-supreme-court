1985.84-6646,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,8.488,We will hear arguments next in Turner against the Director of the Virginia Department of Corrections.
1985.84-6646,0,33126,j_lloyd_snook_iii,,36.274,58.651,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this case presents the question of whether Willie Turner was denied his right to be tried by an impartial jury in his capital murder case where the trial judge refused to allow voir dire about whether the fact that Turner is black and his victim was white would cause prospective jurors to be prejudiced against him."
1985.84-6646,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,308.448,310.176,"Suppose the defendant, Mr. Snook, is Puerto Rican."
1985.84-6646,0,33126,j_lloyd_snook_iii,,310.176,311.168,"Well, Your Honor, I--"
1985.84-6646,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,311.168,312.648,You would ask the same question then?
1985.84-6646,0,33126,j_lloyd_snook_iii,,312.648,321.234,"--Your Honor, I would argue in this particular case all that we are presenting you with is the black on white situation, and we have--"
1985.84-6646,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,321.234,322.616,I am asking you a hypothetical question.
1985.84-6646,0,33126,j_lloyd_snook_iii,,322.616,323.017,--I understanding.
1985.84-6646,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,323.017,325.808,Because the question you are putting may answer the other question.
1985.84-6646,0,33126,j_lloyd_snook_iii,,325.808,326.867,I understand.
1985.84-6646,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,335.453,336.835,How about Hispanics then?
1985.84-6646,0,33126,j_lloyd_snook_iii,,344.579,364.363,"Well, I think that there you could again fall back on the case by case sort of analysis, and I don't think it is necessarily wrong to say that in a case where... for example, let us suppose that we are in a place in Texas in which there is a greater history of discrimination against people with Spanish surnames."
1985.84-6646,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,389.489,406.99,"Mr. Snook, in your submission a moment ago you said that in your view the Court could retain, I thought you said, the basic outline of Ristaino against Ross, which leaves it largely to the discretion of the trial court informed by the facts of the particular case."
1985.84-6646,0,33126,j_lloyd_snook_iii,,417.348,459.484,"Your Honor, if you choose to apply that, the narrowest possible ground on which we have urged relief in this particular case with simply the decision that the trial judge must consider, at the very least, must consider the unique characteristics of the death penalty statute and the unique characteristics of the death penalty decision, and you add in this particular case the fact that not just the trial and the jury was being move to a different location, but the judge who was conducting the voir dire and counsel also were going to a jurisdiction with which they were not familiar in this instance."
1985.84-6646,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,474.173,477.326,"Where was this case tried, what county?"
1985.84-6646,0,33126,j_lloyd_snook_iii,,477.326,488.943,"This case was tried in Northhampton County, which is on the eastern shore of Virginia, and Southampton County was where the crime occurred, and is the area from which the judge comes and where the judge sits."
1985.84-6646,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,495.678,499.892,Southampton County is a good ways from Northhampton County?
1985.84-6646,0,33126,j_lloyd_snook_iii,,499.892,500.974,"Yes, they are not contiguous."
1985.84-6646,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,522.195,524.088,And what was the reason for the change?
1985.84-6646,0,33126,j_lloyd_snook_iii,,524.088,526.98,The change of venue was basically because of pretrial publicity.
1985.84-6646,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,529.992,530.72,On the motion of the defense?
1985.84-6646,0,33126,j_lloyd_snook_iii,,530.72,531.171,--Yes.
1985.84-6646,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,548.753,559.651,"So your submission is on your narrowest ground that although the judge had resided in Northhampton County, he could have declined to voir dire; since he came from another county, he couldn't have."
1985.84-6646,0,33126,j_lloyd_snook_iii,,559.651,567.085,At least in a case in which the judge sits there and actively thinks about the unique aspects of the capital statute.
1985.84-6646,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,595.733,597.475,"Yes, but you wouldn't be satisfied if we just said that."
1985.84-6646,0,33126,j_lloyd_snook_iii,,604.859,606.421,"In this particular case, Your Honor--"
1985.84-6646,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,606.421,606.652,Yes.
1985.84-6646,0,33126,j_lloyd_snook_iii,,606.652,610.143,--I am obviously here asking you to hold that in this case the judge abused his discretion.
1985.84-6646,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,610.143,611.264,What would you do?
1985.84-6646,0,33126,j_lloyd_snook_iii,,619.309,628.105,"Your Honor, I don't suggest that the Constitution requires in this case or as a general matter individual voir dire, or that any particular form of voir dire--"
1985.84-6646,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,628.105,629.277,So what would you expect?
1985.84-6646,0,33126,j_lloyd_snook_iii,,633.918,635.52,"--At the very least, yes."
1985.84-6646,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,635.52,637.631,"Well, at the very least."
1985.84-6646,0,33126,j_lloyd_snook_iii,,638.823,643.194,"I think that that is the minimum that the Constitution requires, yes."
1985.84-6646,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,643.194,643.985,So the answer is yes?
1985.84-6646,0,33126,j_lloyd_snook_iii,,643.985,644.566,Yes.
1985.84-6646,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,647.028,653.081,"And you would expect that that really would do some good, that some people would raise their hand and say, yes, I am racially prejudiced?"
1985.84-6646,0,33126,j_lloyd_snook_iii,,653.081,658.335,"Well, I am prepared to assume, as this Court has in the past, that jurors will answer truthfully."
1985.84-6646,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,658.335,668.753,And you thank that the... you must think that the chance of there being racial prejudice among the jurors is sufficient to try to weed these people out.
1985.84-6646,0,33126,j_lloyd_snook_iii,,668.753,669.522,That's right.
1985.84-6646,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,669.522,673.054,Let me get back to the geography.
1985.84-6646,0,33126,j_lloyd_snook_iii,,678.026,678.337,Yes sir.
1985.84-6646,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,678.337,679.759,How many counties are in between?
1985.84-6646,0,33126,j_lloyd_snook_iii,,679.759,689.196,"It is complicated a little bit by the fact that there are cities in between, and in Virginia cities and counties are separate jurisdictions, but I think--"
1985.84-6646,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,689.196,691.436,How many counties in between?
1985.84-6646,0,33126,j_lloyd_snook_iii,,693.968,714.742,"--That's right, the Chesapeake Bay is the bigger problem, because we are... you have to go across the Chesapeake Bay, I think it is really safe to say that the eastern shore is considerably isolated from the rest of the state, and Justice Powell, I am sure, is familiar with the geographical problems that we have in this state in integrating the eastern shore into the rest of the state."
1985.84-6646,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,716.551,716.902,Or vice versa.
1985.84-6646,0,33126,j_lloyd_snook_iii,,716.902,717.783,--Or vice versa.
1985.84-6646,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,718.424,720.676,Then your 80 miles is as the crow flies.
1985.84-6646,0,33126,j_lloyd_snook_iii,,720.676,723.026,That may well be.
1985.84-6646,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,723.026,724.248,Don't you know?
1985.84-6646,0,33126,j_lloyd_snook_iii,,724.248,728.33,"I don't know offhand how the crow flies, because you are going at sort of an angle."
1985.84-6646,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,728.33,730.293,"Well, you are from Virginia."
1985.84-6646,0,33126,j_lloyd_snook_iii,,732.233,742.251,"Your Honor, I know that it is about 20 miles or 30 miles from the county seat of Northhampton County down to Norfolk, at which point one heads west about 50 miles."
1985.84-6646,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,751.855,753.648,The crow likes to follow the shoreline.
1985.84-6646,0,33126,j_lloyd_snook_iii,,753.648,756.349,"If you follow the shoreline, you are in real trouble."
1985.84-6646,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,891.087,893.249,What are the guidelines for the exercise of that discretion?
1985.84-6646,0,33126,j_lloyd_snook_iii,,893.249,898.231,"The exercise of the judge's discretion is what... well, Your Honor--"
1985.84-6646,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,898.231,913.703,"Must he take a look at the ethnic and racial composition of the particular jurisdiction, that is to say that it is one-third Hispanic or one-third something else or--"
1985.84-6646,0,33126,j_lloyd_snook_iii,,913.703,915.395,"--I would think so, yes."
1985.84-6646,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,915.395,915.906,--one-third Austrians?
1985.84-6646,0,33126,j_lloyd_snook_iii,,915.906,925.719,"I would think so, and in fact that would be part of the local knowledge that a local judge would have that would make that decision and that exercise of discretion better informed."
1985.84-6646,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,965.995,971.251,"Well, would you require him to put something on the record reciting that he had considered them?"
1985.84-6646,0,33126,j_lloyd_snook_iii,,971.251,974.931,I think that would certainly be helpful in this particular case--
1985.84-6646,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,974.931,977.753,Would you require it as a matter of federal constitutional law?
1985.84-6646,0,33126,j_lloyd_snook_iii,,977.753,995.017,"--I think that if it is to be considered as an exercise of discretion, that yes, it would have to be... either he would have to say, yes, I have considered these factors, or would have to give some other indication some place that he is not simply ruling out of his hip pocket."
1985.84-6646,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,995.017,998.55,What part of the constitution would he be relying on?
1985.84-6646,0,33126,j_lloyd_snook_iii,,998.55,1025.144,"Only the part of the constitution... Your Honor, this is still a Sixth Amendment claim, and while the Sixth Amendment may not spell out specifically that he has to put in writing every reason for what he is doing, and I understand of course in Witt versus Wainwright that this Court held that a judge does not have to give written findings of fact every time he decides that somebody should not sit as a juror, but that is not what we are talking about."
1985.84-6646,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1045.927,1061.97,"Mr. Snook, your argument strikes me, frankly, as asking for almost a cosmetic change which would have the effect of overturning a conviction for failure to meet it."
1985.84-6646,0,33126,j_lloyd_snook_iii,,1089.608,1091.909,"As a bare minimum, yes."
1985.84-6646,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1091.909,1102.956,"Well, I mean, when you look at it from that standpoint, how much do we gain by that kind of a limited inquiry?"
1985.84-6646,0,33126,j_lloyd_snook_iii,,1105.517,1105.837,Okay.
1985.84-6646,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1117.416,1125.68,"If there are honest jurors on the panel who felt they were racially biased, they should have said yes in response to the more general question, shouldn't they?"
1985.84-6646,0,33126,j_lloyd_snook_iii,,1125.68,1133.707,"I don't think so, Your Honor, because the more general question does not call their attention to the fact that the victim was white."
1985.84-6646,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1252.292,1258.767,What about a white capital defendant in a community that may be predominantly Negro?
1985.84-6646,0,33126,j_lloyd_snook_iii,,1258.767,1264.902,"If you had the same history of racial discrimination in that community, I think that would be a valid concern."
1985.84-6646,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1267.145,1274.218,How does the history... how do you measure that history?
1985.84-6646,0,33126,j_lloyd_snook_iii,,1275.911,1277.66,Obviously.
1985.84-6646,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1311.912,1333.777,"What if the judge then says, well, I have been sitting in this jurisdiction for 20 years, and I reject the idea, the notion that there has been any discriminatory administration of justice, and I would regard the question that you propose as an offensive question to be put to an American citizen?"
1985.84-6646,0,33126,j_lloyd_snook_iii,,1342.282,1346.025,At least in that instance the judge would have considered those things.
1985.84-6646,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1373.732,1374.383,"Very well, Mr. Snook."
1985.84-6646,1,31319,james_e_kulp,,1380.988,1414.829,"Mr. Chief Justice, members of the Supreme Court, may it please the Court, one of the questions that was asked earlier about the difference between Southampton County, the place in which this crime occurred, and Northampton County, the place in which the trial occurred, in his opening statement to the jury counsel for petitioner, in speaking to the jurors in Northampton County, indicated that the area and the people were basically the same."
1985.84-6646,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1624.776,1641.549,"Mr. Kulp, the Supreme Court of Virginia's opinion when it is dealing with the question of whether or not the trial judge should have asked this question does have a footnote, as I recall, saying that the defendant had introduced into evidence this study."
1985.84-6646,1,31319,james_e_kulp,,1643.389,1652.175,"Yes, sir, Justice Rehnquist, they do, and it seems that the Supreme Court of Virginia has given credit that the study was introduced on this particular point."
1985.84-6646,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1893.362,1900.537,"Let me ask you for a minute, Mr. Kulp, is the first study you referred to the Northeastern study?"
1985.84-6646,1,31319,james_e_kulp,,1900.537,1902.026,"Yes, sir, that is Bowers and Pierce."
1985.84-6646,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1902.026,1902.938,Bowers and Pierce.
1985.84-6646,1,31319,james_e_kulp,,1904.788,1905.539,"Yes, sir."
1985.84-6646,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1905.539,1907.771,"Were Bowers and Pierce, either of them present?"
1985.84-6646,1,31319,james_e_kulp,,1907.771,1908.812,"No, sir."
1985.84-6646,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1908.812,1911.323,Did the state object to the admission?
1985.84-6646,1,31319,james_e_kulp,,1911.323,1914.135,"No, sir, the commonwealth's attorney did not object."
1985.84-6646,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1914.135,1916.737,And the trial judge received it?
1985.84-6646,1,31319,james_e_kulp,,1916.737,1917.708,"Yes, sir."
1985.84-6646,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1931.977,1933.119,Post-sentencing proceeding?
1985.84-6646,1,31319,james_e_kulp,,1933.119,1933.449,Proceeding.
1985.84-6646,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1933.449,1936.652,And then how about the Morrow study?
1985.84-6646,1,31319,james_e_kulp,,1940.461,1941.172,"Yes, sir."
1985.84-6646,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1941.172,1944.875,And what was the state's position when that was offered?
1985.84-6646,1,31319,james_e_kulp,,1944.875,1969.713,"I think the position, and I didn't try the case, but I believe the position was that it does not accurately reflect how capital punishment is raised or is being imposed in the Commonwealth of Virginia, and the District Court found that as a matter of law, the statistics were not acceptable."
1985.84-6646,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2058.149,2060.593,"General Kulp... oh, excuse me."
1985.84-6646,1,31319,james_e_kulp,,2097.966,2133.409,"Justice O'Connor, it is true that in this case the jury when they were asked these questions did not know the race of the defendant... or the victim, and as a matter of fact, all during the case neither the prosecutor nor the defendant ever made anything of race either of the defendant or the victim, and it wasn't until about the second or third day of trial when the prosecutor introduced a photograph of the body that the jurors virtually became aware that he was white."
1985.84-6646,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2308.494,2319.21,Do you concede that on the record of this case it is apparent that the judge did not exercise discretion in making this determination--
1985.84-6646,1,31319,james_e_kulp,,2319.21,2320.88,"No, Your Honor."
1985.84-6646,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2320.88,2322.062,--whether to ask the question?
1985.84-6646,1,31319,james_e_kulp,,2322.062,2323.023,"No, Your Honor."
1985.84-6646,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2369.333,2377.408,What if the defendants had offered all the things that they have offered here in this court to the trial judge.
1985.84-6646,1,31319,james_e_kulp,,2386.182,2387.695,"Yes, Your Honor, I think he could have."
1985.84-6646,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2423.63,2442.88,"Well, they have produced a number of studies now that presumably could support their position, and you think if all of those things had been available to the trial judge, it would have been appropriate for the judge to refuse to ask a single question about racial bias?"
1985.84-6646,1,31319,james_e_kulp,,2442.88,2446.683,"Yes, Your Honor, because even though they have introduced--"
1985.84-6646,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2446.683,2450.036,"If it had been in a federal court, he would have had... the judge would have to ask."
1985.84-6646,1,31319,james_e_kulp,,2450.036,2451.326,"--Yes, ma'am."
1985.84-6646,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2463.124,2481.015,"Yes, but in Rosales, although it was a supervisory case, the reason the rule was imposed was because when there is a... where the victim and the defendant are of different races, there is a reasonable possibility of prejudice."
1985.84-6646,1,31319,james_e_kulp,,2513.186,2520.982,"Well, Justice White, I think to answer your question if you have a special circumstance, as was--"
1985.84-6646,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2520.982,2525.204,"Well, the special circumstance in Rosales was identified specifically."
1985.84-6646,1,31319,james_e_kulp,,2538.384,2563.669,"--I think, Justice White, that the Court did not find that that was a reasonable possibility apparently in all circumstances, because in Ristaino you had a violent crime, blacks on white, and the Court said that does not call for a per se rule, and so it seems to me that what the Court has done in Rosales is applied its supervisory authority, but they said--"
1985.84-6646,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2563.669,2577.059,"Well, there is no doubt about that, but the predicate for its rule was that... at least the rule that it applied and found to have been satisfied here in Rosales was this rule I just stated to you."
1985.84-6646,1,31319,james_e_kulp,,2577.059,2577.369,"--Yes, sir."
1985.84-6646,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2577.369,2581.331,That must be inconsistent with Ristaino.
1985.84-6646,1,31319,james_e_kulp,,2581.331,2581.892,It is.
1985.84-6646,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2587.065,2588.898,Which came first?
1985.84-6646,1,31319,james_e_kulp,,2588.898,2590.807,--Ristaino came first.
1985.84-6646,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2671.02,2675.912,Did you understand that the attack in this case is on the conviction or the death sentence or both?
1985.84-6646,1,31319,james_e_kulp,,2675.912,2693.834,"Well, I think the petitioner's relief asked for in both his petition or in his initial brief and the reply brief talks in terms of both, either send it back for a retrial entirely or send it back for sentencing."
1985.84-6646,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2754.895,2761.127,"Counsel, wouldn't you be in a better position, you, if the judge had at least looked at the report?"
1985.84-6646,1,31319,james_e_kulp,,2761.127,2765.171,Justice Marshall--
1985.84-6646,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2765.171,2773.776,"Wouldn't the judge close his mind and say the Supreme Court has said that is unimportant, so I am not interested in it?"
1985.84-6646,1,31319,james_e_kulp,,2773.776,2775.788,"--Justice Marshall, I don't think he closed his mind."
1985.84-6646,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2777.74,2779.911,Didn't he say that?
1985.84-6646,1,31319,james_e_kulp,,2783.334,2788.176,"--He said that, yes, sir, but the attorneys did not--"
1985.84-6646,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2788.176,2791.069,"Well, wouldn't you have been better off if he had looked at it?"
1985.84-6646,1,31319,james_e_kulp,,2791.479,2792.09,--It was not there.
1985.84-6646,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2792.09,2794.821,Wouldn't you have been better off if he had asked for it?
1985.84-6646,1,31319,james_e_kulp,,2794.821,2801.355,"Well, I assume, but I think that the judge is like anyone else."
1985.84-6646,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2880.468,2888.353,Is there any discretion in the prosecutor as to... for a particular crime whether to charge capital murder or something else?
1985.84-6646,1,31319,james_e_kulp,,2888.353,2895.128,"--Yes, Justice White, there is, but these were 212 people actually indicated for capital murder."
1985.84-6646,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2895.128,2900.822,And the prosecutor then was urging the death penalty?
1985.84-6646,1,31319,james_e_kulp,,2900.822,2909.017,"Well, I think at least certainly initially, Justice White, but we obviously know some people were convicted of lesser offenses."
1985.84-6646,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2909.017,2909.668,"Well, I know."
1985.84-6646,1,31319,james_e_kulp,,2910.139,2912.75,So he at least charged him.
1985.84-6646,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2931.793,2939.788,"Am I correct, we don't know how many of these 180 people actually were eligible for the death penalty in the sense that the jury had an opportunity to impose it?"
1985.84-6646,1,31319,james_e_kulp,,2939.788,2954.878,"--Justice Stevens, we know by a survey that we did that more blacks who killed whites who were convicted of capital murder received life imprisonment than they did the death sentence."
1985.84-6646,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2956.62,2961.292,"Yes, but that is a comparison within the universe of blacks who killed whites."
1985.84-6646,1,31319,james_e_kulp,,2965.456,2981.646,"--Well, we know, again, by just a survey that we did that more people who were actually convicted of capital murder, whether they be black on white, white on white, whatever it is, more people received life sentences than they did the death sentence."
1985.84-6646,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2981.646,2984.119,Is that in the record?
1985.84-6646,1,31319,james_e_kulp,,2984.119,2984.668,"No, sir."
1985.84-6646,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3029.899,3033.672,Has Virginia ever imposed a death penalty on a black who killed a black?
1985.84-6646,1,31319,james_e_kulp,,3033.672,3036.673,"Yes, sir, Your Honor, and one has been executed within the last year."
1985.84-6646,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3036.673,3052.113,"May I ask in your study of the Ristaino case which involves a black defendant and a white prison guard as I remember it, does the record tell us whether the jurors knew that the victim was white at the time of the voir dire?"
1985.84-6646,1,31319,james_e_kulp,,3053.495,3055.185,"No, sir, I don't think it does."
1985.84-6646,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3072.437,3076.259,And that one excused himself without really knowing the race of the victim.
1985.84-6646,1,31319,james_e_kulp,,3076.259,3077.06,"Yes, sir."
1985.84-6646,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3078.191,3080.574,Don't you have the defendant in court during the voir dire?
1985.84-6646,1,31319,james_e_kulp,,3080.574,3089.179,"I say, in our case, all of the jurors were aware of the defendant's race when they were asked, but in Ristaino the record is not clear."
1985.84-6646,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3089.179,3092.851,Were there blacks on the jury that convicted this man?
1985.84-6646,1,31319,james_e_kulp,,3092.851,3097.576,"In this case the jury, the makeup of the jury was four blacks and eight whites."
1985.84-6646,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3097.576,3098.905,Who was the foreman?
1985.84-6646,1,31319,james_e_kulp,,3098.905,3100.888,"The foreman was black, Mr. Warsling."
1985.84-6646,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3141.214,3144.937,"Do you have anything further, Mr. Snook?"
1985.84-6646,2,33126,j_lloyd_snook_iii,,3144.937,3146.169,"Yes, Your Honor, I do."
1985.84-6646,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3146.169,3152.313,"What do you ask, Mr. Snook?"
1985.84-6646,2,33126,j_lloyd_snook_iii,,3155.496,3158.167,"Your Honor, what we have--"
1985.84-6646,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3158.167,3158.956,Just yes or no.
1985.84-6646,2,33126,j_lloyd_snook_iii,,3158.956,3167.613,"--The problem is that, if I may, Your Honor, the issue is a bit more complicated than that, and I don't want to concede something--"
1985.84-6646,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3167.613,3169.694,"Well, you are bound to come out with a conclusion."
1985.84-6646,2,33126,j_lloyd_snook_iii,,3172.185,3180.82,"--Ultimately, I would suspect that if he were retried on guilt, he would be convicted anyway, and what we really most want is to keep him out of the electric chair."
1985.84-6646,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3180.82,3190.838,"Well, normally when only a sentence is under attack, we just vacate the sentence and leave the conviction intact."
1985.84-6646,2,33126,j_lloyd_snook_iii,,3190.838,3192.018,That's right.
1985.84-6646,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3192.018,3198.172,"If this hadn't been... if the same crime had been charged except it wasn't charged as a capital crime, would you be here?"
1985.84-6646,2,33126,j_lloyd_snook_iii,,3198.172,3206.297,"Well, obviously, we are predicating our whole approach on the fact that it is capital--"
1985.84-6646,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3206.297,3207.508,"Well, so you can just answer no, you wouldn't be here, would you?"
1985.84-6646,2,33126,j_lloyd_snook_iii,,3207.508,3208.55,"--No, we would not be."
1985.84-6646,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3210.751,3211.432,Not in that sense?
1985.84-6646,2,33126,j_lloyd_snook_iii,,3212.731,3234.957,"--Justice White, if I might, let me say that the problem that I have is that under this Court's decisions such as Toomey versus Ohio and cases of that nature that have dealt with the abridgement of the right to an impartial finder of fact, an impartial trier, this Court has never attempted to get into harmless error analyses."
1985.84-6646,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3247.553,3251.657,Then why do you hinge your whole case on it being a death case?
1985.84-6646,2,33126,j_lloyd_snook_iii,,3261.154,3270.052,"I may be being excessively cautious, Your Honor, in not trying to concede something that may have ramifications or implications that I don't want."
1985.84-6646,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3278.758,3284.192,"Let me just ask you then, do you ask us to set aside the conviction as well as the death sentence?"
1985.84-6646,2,33126,j_lloyd_snook_iii,,3284.843,3285.381,Yes.
1985.84-6646,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3291.675,3297.058,You qualified your answer to Justice White by saying there isn't much doubt of his guilt.
1985.84-6646,2,33126,j_lloyd_snook_iii,,3298.65,3300.34,I don't think there really is.
1985.84-6646,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3309.747,3313.771,"The fact of guilt doesn't necessarily answer your constitutional question, but--"
1985.84-6646,2,33126,j_lloyd_snook_iii,,3313.771,3316.733,"--No, but--"
1985.84-6646,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3316.733,3318.826,--And you client also tried to kill another person at the same time.
1985.84-6646,2,33126,j_lloyd_snook_iii,,3318.826,3321.187,"--I don't believe he did, Your Honor."
1985.84-6646,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3321.187,3323.298,He shot one person who didn't die.
1985.84-6646,2,33126,j_lloyd_snook_iii,,3323.298,3324.4,"No, he did not."
1985.84-6646,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3324.4,3325.121,Are you sure of that?
1985.84-6646,2,33126,j_lloyd_snook_iii,,3327.141,3330.423,"I am pretty sure, Your Honor, there was only one person shot at, and that was Jack Smith."
1985.84-6646,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3388.92,3389.932,Who did Mr. Woodard represent?
1985.84-6646,2,33126,j_lloyd_snook_iii,,3389.932,3393.374,"Woodard is the counsel for petitioner, counsel for defendant."
1985.84-6646,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3393.374,3395.796,And when was this?
1985.84-6646,2,33126,j_lloyd_snook_iii,,3395.796,3404.242,"This was... in the preliminary goings on before the calling of the jury, before the voir dire, when he was making his objection to the constitutionality of the statute."
1985.84-6646,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3433.342,3436.774,"What does that mean, to say they would have gone forward?"
1985.84-6646,2,33126,j_lloyd_snook_iii,,3438.295,3467.423,"--In addressing the concern that this Court may be having as to whether the judge had the issue and the facts in front of him on which to base the motion or the argument we are now making, he would have had them there, would have had the facts in front of him in the form of that study sufficient to allow an open-minded judge to look at them, read them, and understand them, but he obviously had closed his mind before he got to that point."
1985.84-6646,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3467.423,3474.018,"He closed his mind, as you put it, on the basis of the decision of the Supreme Court of the United States."
1985.84-6646,2,33126,j_lloyd_snook_iii,,3478.633,3495.597,"Well, yes, he is, except that this Court had not in 1979 and still has not to this day ruled in anything that is precedential, that has any precedential value as opposed to denials of cert that the Virginia death penalty statute is being fairly applied."
1985.84-6646,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3504.832,3507.083,I wasn't addressing the correctness of his statement.
1985.84-6646,2,33126,j_lloyd_snook_iii,,3509.454,3515.198,"He may well have perceived it wrong, but that was his perception, and yes, he should follow the dictates of this Court."
1985.84-6646,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3515.198,3517.518,Or else perhaps he was referring to the Supreme Court of Virginia.
1985.84-6646,2,33126,j_lloyd_snook_iii,,3517.518,3518.68,That is also possible.
1985.84-6646,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3520.15,3528.498,"If it is important, if it turns out to have any relevance to this case, is there any question about what the composition of the jury was?"
1985.84-6646,2,33126,j_lloyd_snook_iii,,3535.81,3537.182,It isn't any secret now.
1985.84-6646,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3557.145,3558.367,That is all I need to know.
1985.84-6646,2,33126,j_lloyd_snook_iii,,3558.367,3567.613,"--It also confirms that the commonwealth struck virtually all blacks, and the defendant struck all whites, and that they perceived that there was a real racial problem there."
1985.84-6646,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3574.396,3575.438,"Your time has expired, Mr. Snook."
1985.84-6646,2,33126,j_lloyd_snook_iii,,3575.438,3575.949,--but I see I don't have any more time.
1985.84-6646,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3577.257,3579.54,"Thank you, gentlemen."
