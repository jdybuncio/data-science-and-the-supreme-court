2009.08-1198,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,8.337,"We'll hear argument first today in Case 08-1198, Stolt-Nielsen S.A. v. AnimalFeeds International."
2009.08-1198,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,9.356,20.663,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Unlike courts, arbitrators derive their authority solely from the consent of the parties to a particular agreement."
2009.08-1198,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,71.429,92.509,"Mr. Waxman, there's a preliminary question in this case, and that is: There was one agreement, undoubtedly signed by both sides, and that was the one to submit to the arbitrator the question whether the arbitration clause permitted class treatment."
2009.08-1198,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,111.904,115.022,"I respectfully disagree, Justice Ginsburg."
2009.08-1198,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,177.91,178.427,But there is no such answer.
2009.08-1198,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,178.427,179.177,--Excuse me.
2009.08-1198,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,179.177,181.527,"I thought, in contracts, there is no such answer."
2009.08-1198,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,191.835,193.768,Justice Breyer--
2009.08-1198,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,193.768,195.62,"And I thought that's what Bazzle said, that--"
2009.08-1198,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,195.62,198.405,--I very -- I very much doubt that you are way out-of-date.
2009.08-1198,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,202.073,203.042,--Not as out-of-date.
2009.08-1198,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,203.642,209.796,"--I hope I am as up-to-date as I need to be to provide a coherent, correct answer."
2009.08-1198,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,227.055,227.221,Yes.
2009.08-1198,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,227.221,246.033,"And the arbitrators then went on to say: Even though there is no meeting of the minds objectively revealed, nonetheless we are going to apply a background rule that puts the burden on the party opposing arbitration to prove that there is an intent to preclude."
2009.08-1198,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,247.417,249.484,"I see that now, but then -- but there are two separate questions."
2009.08-1198,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,249.484,249.934,--Exactly.
2009.08-1198,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,249.934,252.77,"My question was, first, the same as Justice Ginsburg."
2009.08-1198,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,252.77,253.872,And I have an answer--
2009.08-1198,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,253.872,271.148,"And I have a question for you on that, because in reading these briefs, I thought your description of who is to decide this matter of whether there is to be a class action was just what you said: The question of who should decide it is a matter for the parties."
2009.08-1198,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,271.148,272.564,--The question--
2009.08-1198,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,272.564,278.818,"So when I looked at -- I just have been reading Bazzle three, five times, and there seemed--"
2009.08-1198,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,278.818,0.0,"--Well, you are nowhere near up to me, then."
2009.08-1198,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,279.385,0.0,--All right.
2009.08-1198,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,313.82,314.404,Yes.
2009.08-1198,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,314.57,322.491,"So why are all these briefs saying that what Bazzle said was: Whenever this is silent, it goes to the arbitrator; the who question is answered at arbitration."
2009.08-1198,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,323.843,324.009,"--No, no, no."
2009.08-1198,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,330.497,330.58,"Yes, I know."
2009.08-1198,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,333.532,333.865,--Okay.
2009.08-1198,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,419.721,430.594,"Now, you're -- so the answer to Justice Ginsburg's question is, as to the who question, who shall decide whether or not in your case class actions are permissible?"
2009.08-1198,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,430.594,431.113,And the--
2009.08-1198,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,431.113,435.147,"The who question in Bazzle, because of the contract and background, was the arbitrator."
2009.08-1198,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,435.147,435.73,--If -- yes.
2009.08-1198,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,435.73,441.884,"The who question here, irrespective of the contract is the arbitrator for the reason that Justice Ginsburg said."
2009.08-1198,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,445.769,446.419,Yes.
2009.08-1198,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,446.419,447.538,So now we look to the what.
2009.08-1198,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,448.371,448.988,Exactly.
2009.08-1198,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,451.088,451.354,What -- what did they decide?
2009.08-1198,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,462.11,462.36,--Right.
2009.08-1198,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,519.196,520.815,"Mr. Waxman, can I ask this preliminary question?"
2009.08-1198,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,527.552,530.671,--If it expressly authorized it?
2009.08-1198,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,530.671,530.971,Yes.
2009.08-1198,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,530.971,539.793,"If it expressly authorized class participation, obviously, we would have no argument that the parties had not agreed to it."
2009.08-1198,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,539.793,545.013,"I understand, but would you agree that would be consistent with the law, to enforce such a provision?"
2009.08-1198,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,545.013,547.465,My -- I have a--
2009.08-1198,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,547.465,551.101,"That is, does the Federal statute prohibit that kind of provision?"
2009.08-1198,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,551.101,552.001,"--No, certainly not."
2009.08-1198,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,552.001,552.567,Oh.
2009.08-1198,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,552.567,579.669,"I mean, the only reason -- the only reason I'm hedging -- and I don't mean to hedge, but trying to be thoughtful -- is that this Court explained in Mitsubishi, in the context of the arbitration of a Sherman Act agreement, and subsequently in Gilmer and other statutory cases, that in determining whether class participation or some other form of remedy is or isn't available, there is a two-part inquiry."
2009.08-1198,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,587.674,599.248,"And you would agree that if they phrased their order a little differently and said we think that the best reading of this agreement is that the parties intended to authorize class arbitration, then you would have no case?"
2009.08-1198,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,599.248,611.723,"--Then we would have review only under the -- I don't know that I would characterize it this way, but what Justice Breyer characterized, the Marrs standard of review; that is, you would have to show--"
2009.08-1198,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,611.723,615.092,That there was manifest disregard--
2009.08-1198,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,615.092,615.36,"--manifest disregard, and a manifest--"
2009.08-1198,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,615.36,618.562,--And you would not contend -- you are not arguing that that would be manifest--
2009.08-1198,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,618.562,643.011,"--No, our -- and the petition in this case presented the question as given, presented the issue of contract construction as given, that the contract itself was silent, not only in the sense that it didn't include an express provision or prohibition, but also that it reflected no meeting of the minds."
2009.08-1198,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,659.473,663.84,"--What, in your view -- what, in your view, were the arbitrators asked to decide by the submission by the parties?"
2009.08-1198,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,663.84,684.771,"--The arbitrators were asked to decide whether the arbitration agreement objectively reveals consent to prohibit, permit -- whether it reveals a meeting of the minds to prohibit class treatment, permit class treatment, or whether it was truly silent."
2009.08-1198,1,19817,cornelia_tl_pillard,,1791.401,1800.257,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: What the arbitrators did here was interpret the contract as the parties asked them to."
2009.08-1198,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1814.017,1814.017,"Where -- where -- where do they say that they were interpreting the intent of the parties, that it was the intent of the parties to permit class arbitration?"
2009.08-1198,1,19817,cornelia_tl_pillard,,1814.017,1824.824,Okay.
2009.08-1198,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1848.338,1849.254,"--Excuse me, what part -- 50?"
2009.08-1198,1,19817,cornelia_tl_pillard,,1849.254,1852.123,"--50a, the next page of the petition appendix."
2009.08-1198,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1852.123,1853.456,I thought you said 59a to start.
2009.08-1198,1,19817,cornelia_tl_pillard,,1853.456,1853.74,No.
2009.08-1198,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1853.74,1854.675,You said 49a.
2009.08-1198,1,19817,cornelia_tl_pillard,,1854.675,1856.425,49a was where--
2009.08-1198,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1856.425,1856.808,Right.
2009.08-1198,1,19817,cornelia_tl_pillard,,1856.808,1868.3,"--the arbitrators described their methodology, which is standard contract methodology: To look to the parties' agreement, to ascertain the parties' intention, whether they intended to permit--"
2009.08-1198,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1868.3,1869.501,Or to preclude.
2009.08-1198,1,19817,cornelia_tl_pillard,,1869.501,1869.784,--or preclude--
2009.08-1198,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1869.784,1870.418,Right.
2009.08-1198,1,19817,cornelia_tl_pillard,,1870.418,1870.934,--class action.
2009.08-1198,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1872.119,1873.503,"Isn't that a critical difference, though?"
2009.08-1198,1,19817,cornelia_tl_pillard,,1891.515,1892.481,--That's right.
2009.08-1198,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1892.481,1906.091,"And if it didn't preclude, the contract may not preclude -- if I agree -- I guess it's the -- well, if I agree to arbitrate with A, it doesn't preclude me from arbitrating with B, but nothing in the agreement compels me to do that."
2009.08-1198,1,19817,cornelia_tl_pillard,,1922.802,1925.421,"Mr. Chief Justice, they did the former."
2009.08-1198,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1944.666,1946.834,Would you show me this -- I see they have quoted from--
2009.08-1198,1,19817,cornelia_tl_pillard,,1946.834,1947.651,--Yes.
2009.08-1198,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1947.651,1948.218,--from the agreement.
2009.08-1198,1,19817,cornelia_tl_pillard,,1950.12,1951.686,"The ""any disputes""--"
2009.08-1198,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1951.686,1952.172,Yes.
2009.08-1198,1,19817,cornelia_tl_pillard,,1952.172,1952.822,--language?
2009.08-1198,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1954.438,1957.725,If you know offhand.
2009.08-1198,1,19817,cornelia_tl_pillard,,1957.725,1970.366,"Is -- the agreement is reproduced in Appendix F of the petition appendix, which starts on page 67a, and the arbitration clause is on page 69a."
2009.08-1198,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1976.353,1977.787,"Well, this is -- I'm sorry."
2009.08-1198,1,19817,cornelia_tl_pillard,,2008.72,2011.94,"--I'd like to address that directly, Mr. Chief Justice."
2009.08-1198,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2040.106,2041.625,"Well, now -- now -- I'm sorry."
2009.08-1198,1,19817,cornelia_tl_pillard,,2055.95,2056.5,Right.
2009.08-1198,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2056.5,2061.938,So it's enough for them if the parties did not intend to preclude class action.
2009.08-1198,1,19817,cornelia_tl_pillard,,2061.938,2063.971,I -- I respectfully disagree.
2009.08-1198,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2088.254,2094.974,"In -- in any -- in any case -- when you say ""arbitrators' toolbox"", I'm trying to figure out if that is something different than what the parties agreed to."
2009.08-1198,1,19817,cornelia_tl_pillard,,2094.974,2110.15,"--No, by agreeing to arbitrate any disputes, the arbitrators found that they were given the authority to use class arbitration, among other procedures, if they were appropriate in the particular case."
2009.08-1198,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2110.15,2116.47,It -- it seems to me that the arbitrators are putting the choice in a false manner.
2009.08-1198,1,19817,cornelia_tl_pillard,,2144.371,2145.237,That's right.
2009.08-1198,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2183.01,2186.647,"Well, no, I mean, they -- they put it just -- just the way that -- that is not good for you."
2009.08-1198,1,19817,cornelia_tl_pillard,,2202.055,2206.608,--And it's our contention -- and I think it's clear -- that they found that it was permitted.
2009.08-1198,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2208.524,2209.976,Just give me some language that says that.
2009.08-1198,1,19817,cornelia_tl_pillard,,2212.595,2220.332,"--The -- the broad wording, the ""any dispute"" -- now, they reject the notion -- they expressly have rejected the notion that they are supposed to do it as a matter of default."
2009.08-1198,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2267.397,2272.099,So the only language you can point to is that -- is that 50a?
2009.08-1198,1,19817,cornelia_tl_pillard,,2272.099,2273.551,"That's right, and I think that's very important."
2009.08-1198,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2273.551,2290.144,"You are hanging your whole -- your whole assertion that -- that these arbitrators not only found that the contract did not prohibit it, but found that the contract positively authorized class action, upon that language on 50a?"
2009.08-1198,1,19817,cornelia_tl_pillard,,2290.144,2300.416,Together with the language on 49a where the panel expressly rejects the idea that all you need is the absence of language forbidding it.
2009.08-1198,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2308.653,2309.355,Where -- where--
2009.08-1198,1,19817,cornelia_tl_pillard,,2309.355,2316.359,"--It's on 49a, the second sentence under the heading of ""Discussion of Parties' Contentions""."
2009.08-1198,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2323.08,2325.381,"--""Clear language"" is the point of that sentence."
2009.08-1198,1,19817,cornelia_tl_pillard,,2344.326,2344.945,I would--
2009.08-1198,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2344.945,2353.884,"The point of those two sentences is simply that in order for us to find that you didn't preclude it -- and if you didn't preclude it, it's okay -- you don't need clear language."
2009.08-1198,1,19817,cornelia_tl_pillard,,2355.317,2357.753,"--I -- I respectfully disagree, Justice Scalia--"
2009.08-1198,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2357.753,2358.336,"Well, that's how I read the two sentences."
2009.08-1198,1,19817,cornelia_tl_pillard,,2358.336,2364.822,"--But I think that what's very important here is that judicial review is under a very deferential standard, which is confined to correcting--"
2009.08-1198,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2364.822,2367.357,"Well, that's just saying that they're -- they're giving up a lot."
2009.08-1198,1,19817,cornelia_tl_pillard,,2403.715,2409.851,"--No, but this charter party is the same agreement that the Petitioners have with every absent class member."
2009.08-1198,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2411.867,2412.534,"Oh, but they can agree to arbitrate."
2009.08-1198,1,19817,cornelia_tl_pillard,,2434.382,2435.616,--But they've--
2009.08-1198,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2435.616,2436.232,--and different results.
2009.08-1198,1,19817,cornelia_tl_pillard,,2436.232,2437.418,"--Excuse me, Mr. Chief Justice."
2009.08-1198,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2437.418,2437.418,Go ahead.
2009.08-1198,1,19817,cornelia_tl_pillard,,2437.418,2439.384,They've already entered into agreement.
2009.08-1198,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2467.134,2468.184,That's where I started this.
2009.08-1198,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2476.657,2478.273,I used to teach contracts.
2009.08-1198,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2479.109,2479.592,--What?
2009.08-1198,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2479.592,2480.959,I used to teach contracts.
2009.08-1198,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2480.959,2482.227,"I didn't have that pleasure, but the--"
2009.08-1198,1,19817,cornelia_tl_pillard,,2560.859,2563.077,I think that's pretty good contract law.
2009.08-1198,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2563.077,2565.013,If that's contract law--
2009.08-1198,1,19817,cornelia_tl_pillard,,2565.013,2565.013,And that's the way I understand it.
2009.08-1198,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2565.013,2573.6,"--then I take it what they're saying is: It may be true that the arbitrators, when they looked at some of those elements, really got it wrong."
2009.08-1198,1,19817,cornelia_tl_pillard,,2624.033,2629.586,"I think that if they wanted to write around it, they could do that, as this Court--"
2009.08-1198,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2629.586,2631.702,Not -- we know they're going to -- they have something already in place.
2009.08-1198,1,19817,cornelia_tl_pillard,,2631.702,2633.888,--Could it be interpreted to say--
2009.08-1198,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2633.888,2634.221,Yes.
2009.08-1198,1,19817,cornelia_tl_pillard,,2634.221,2635.656,--this is a question for the court?
2009.08-1198,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2635.656,2636.123,Uh-huh.
2009.08-1198,1,19817,cornelia_tl_pillard,,2636.123,2642.577,"I think -- I don't see the language here in this contract, but they could try to do that."
2009.08-1198,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2679.75,2680.75,Allowing.
2009.08-1198,1,19817,cornelia_tl_pillard,,2680.75,2680.75,--like this one.
2009.08-1198,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2680.75,2681.716,Allowing.
2009.08-1198,1,19817,cornelia_tl_pillard,,2724.543,2742.472,"Well, I think, Mr. Chief Justice, that that goes back to whether any disputes can plausibly be read to encompass the class mechanism, because if it can, well, then, by agreeing to that contract, you have, in effect, agreed to something that delegates to the arbitrator the ability to use that."
2009.08-1198,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2742.472,2742.823,So--
2009.08-1198,1,19817,cornelia_tl_pillard,,2742.823,2743.59,So when you picked--
2009.08-1198,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2743.59,2744.073,--I -- I--
2009.08-1198,1,19817,cornelia_tl_pillard,,2744.073,2746.775,--your arbitrator you picked your arbitrator knowing that.
2009.08-1198,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2781.346,2782.612,"--Well, that's -- that's what it comes down--"
2009.08-1198,1,19817,cornelia_tl_pillard,,2782.612,2782.912,"--Mr. Chief Justice, disappears."
2009.08-1198,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2782.912,2783.612,--That's what it comes down to--
2009.08-1198,1,19817,cornelia_tl_pillard,,2783.612,2784.298,Right.
2009.08-1198,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2784.298,2789.85,--whether it's an interpretation of the contract to give the arbitrators the authority to proceed on a class basis.
2009.08-1198,1,19817,cornelia_tl_pillard,,2795.42,2798.122,I think that's a question of State law.
2009.08-1198,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2840.365,2840.615,So what -- what happens--
2009.08-1198,1,19817,cornelia_tl_pillard,,2840.615,2841.998,"--and the arbitrators say procedure, too."
2009.08-1198,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2841.998,2860.593,"--What happens if you get the arbitrator on the stand, and he says: As we read the contract, it doesn't say -- and nothing about the intent of the parties leads me to believe they meant -- you may arbitrate this on a class basis, but at the same time there is nothing in there that says you may not."
2009.08-1198,1,19817,cornelia_tl_pillard,,2870.817,2875.436,I understand that to be something that's answered by State contract law--
2009.08-1198,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2875.436,2875.871,Yes.
2009.08-1198,1,19817,cornelia_tl_pillard,,2875.871,2877.588,--and it might differ from State to State.
2009.08-1198,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2877.588,2877.988,Right.
2009.08-1198,1,19817,cornelia_tl_pillard,,2879.073,2879.523,Right.
2009.08-1198,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2879.523,2881.539,--under which you should interpret this.
2009.08-1198,1,19817,cornelia_tl_pillard,,2881.539,2881.856,Right.
2009.08-1198,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2881.856,2892.331,"So we have to decide, when we -- when the contract says nothing about class actions, whether the background rule should be you can go ahead -- or the background rule should be you can't go ahead."
2009.08-1198,1,19817,cornelia_tl_pillard,,2892.331,2894.283,"We, the arbitrators, decide that--"
2009.08-1198,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2894.283,2895.633,Well--
2009.08-1198,1,19817,cornelia_tl_pillard,,2895.633,2896.549,"--not we, the United States Supreme Court."
2009.08-1198,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2898.668,2902.803,--What the arbitrators have already told us -- I think you disagree with it--
2009.08-1198,1,19817,cornelia_tl_pillard,,2902.803,2903.103,Yes.
2009.08-1198,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2903.103,2904.22,--but take it for purposes of argument.
2009.08-1198,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2912.841,2913.257,"You don't agree with that, do you?"
2009.08-1198,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2913.257,2914.94,"No, I know I said she doesn't agree with it."
2009.08-1198,1,19817,cornelia_tl_pillard,,2921.444,2926.396,"They -- in my view, haven't answered that -- well, maybe they answered that question under New York law."
2009.08-1198,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2942.188,2943.138,Would you help me with one--
2009.08-1198,1,19817,cornelia_tl_pillard,,2943.138,2966.037,"And if they have applied that and they have found yes, I think we have to -- under the deferential standard of review that applies under FAA section 10, which looks only at gross defects in the process, we have to say they have done their job, they have found this contract authorizes the arbitrators, if they find that it's necessary, and -- you know, we do have a right -- this argument here, which is that they haven't done anything."
2009.08-1198,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2967.304,2969.489,"--May I ask a question, a very basic, elementary questions?"
2009.08-1198,1,19817,cornelia_tl_pillard,,2977.945,2980.13,"--Well, that's a good question."
2009.08-1198,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2982.582,2990.652,"I understand what the arbitrators said, but is there anything in the record that says we want you to answer this narrow question, and if so, what is it?"
2009.08-1198,1,19817,cornelia_tl_pillard,,2990.652,3001.794,"The -- what I'm looking to, and I'm not sure this is going to be the best cite for you, but in the Petitioners' reply brief, they say, the -- on page 6,"
2009.08-1198,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3013.685,3015.47,But the record does not contain--
2009.08-1198,1,19817,cornelia_tl_pillard,,3015.47,3015.92,--Got it.
2009.08-1198,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3015.92,3018.772,--the specific question that arbitrators were asked to answer.
2009.08-1198,1,19817,cornelia_tl_pillard,,3019.339,3020.79,I--
2009.08-1198,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3020.79,3022.557,Because I haven't been able to find it.
2009.08-1198,1,19817,cornelia_tl_pillard,,3035.448,3036.365,--Right.
2009.08-1198,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3039.65,3052.077,"Because I don't think, that -- from what I've been able to read, I don't think they were ever asked the question whether the agreement authorizes class action or class procedures."
2009.08-1198,1,19817,cornelia_tl_pillard,,3058.397,3071.371,"--Now, ""permitted"" I think they take to understand as ""authorize"", and the reason -- and this is something that the court, in the context of Sixth Circuit Dub Herring case, says -- they explain why do we use the language ""permit""?"
2009.08-1198,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3085.862,3091.95,"See, as I understand it, in the supplemental agreement, they were asked a question about the meaning of the underlying arbitration agreement."
2009.08-1198,1,19817,cornelia_tl_pillard,,3091.95,3092.283,Yes.
2009.08-1198,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3092.283,3098.02,"But I can't find what that specific question was, which seems, to me, answers the whole case, if we could find out what it is."
2009.08-1198,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3098.02,3100.639,There's a supplemental agreement here because I thought--
2009.08-1198,1,19817,cornelia_tl_pillard,,3100.639,3101.039,Yes.
2009.08-1198,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3101.039,3105.859,"--in reading this, the supplemental agreement submitted the case under Rule 3--"
2009.08-1198,1,19817,cornelia_tl_pillard,,3105.859,3106.275,Yes.

2009.08-1198,1,19817,cornelia_tl_pillard,,3108.144,3108.461,Yes.
2009.08-1198,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3108.461,3114.298,"--rule 3 of the AAA supplementary rules says, an arbitrator shall, quote,"
2009.08-1198,1,19817,cornelia_tl_pillard,,3128.558,3129.058,Thank you.
2009.08-1198,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3129.058,3131.01,So I thought the supplemental agreement said--
2009.08-1198,1,19817,cornelia_tl_pillard,,3131.01,3131.293,Thank you.
2009.08-1198,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3131.293,3137.831,"--apply Rule 3, and therefore, it was asking the arbitrators to decide the question put in Rule 3."
2009.08-1198,1,19817,cornelia_tl_pillard,,3138.631,3140.116,"I think that's correct, yes."
2009.08-1198,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3140.116,3143.918,So then we could get the question by reading page 7 of the blue brief.
