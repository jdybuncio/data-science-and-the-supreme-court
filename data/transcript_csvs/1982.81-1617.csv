1982.81-1617,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,7.76,We will hear arguments next in United States against Place.
1982.81-1617,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,79.012,95.898,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the issue presented here concerns the constitutionality of police conduct undertaken to investigate suspicion of illegal activity as it arises in a public place."
1982.81-1617,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,126.009,138.741,"Mr. Horowitz, are you contesting basically the issue relating to the seizure and detention of the luggage as opposed to the subsequent exposure to the dog sniff?"
1982.81-1617,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,138.741,145.907,"--Yes, there is no contention here that the dog sniff itself was unconstitutional, given--"
1982.81-1617,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,145.907,148.407,So all we are dealing with is the seizure and detention.
1982.81-1617,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,148.407,153.372,"--Yes, the 90-minute period of time during which the Respondent was dispossessed of his luggage."
1982.81-1617,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,387.28,389.997,I didn't get the point.
1982.81-1617,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,392.715,395.554,It was 90 minutes from the time they took the bag--
1982.81-1617,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,395.554,397.632,"No, I mean afterwards, after they took it."
1982.81-1617,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,397.632,401.506,"--Well, afterwards, I imagine they got a warrant--"
1982.81-1617,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,401.506,404.457,Don't you know that it was over the weekend?
1982.81-1617,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,404.457,407.663,--I imagine they held the bag until the suppression hearing.
1982.81-1617,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,412.814,414.845,"Didn't they hold it over the weekend, before they got a warrant?"
1982.81-1617,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,414.845,416.331,"Over the weekend, then... and beyond that, I would think."
1982.81-1617,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,416.331,417.548,Before they got the warrant.
1982.81-1617,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,417.548,419.939,"Before they got the warrant, yes, they held it over the weekend."
1982.81-1617,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,419.939,420.656,They held it over the weekend.
1982.81-1617,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,420.656,421.171,Right.
1982.81-1617,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,421.171,422.185,That is in the record.
1982.81-1617,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,422.185,423.03,That is in the record.
1982.81-1617,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,431.196,442.489,"Mr. Horowitz, are you in a position to say, what if the sniffing dogs at Kennedy had come up negative, or whatever the expression is?"
1982.81-1617,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,450.16,459.281,"Well, we can't know in this case, because Respondent never... in the course of his conversation with them at the airport, he didn't seem very concerned about getting his bag back."
1982.81-1617,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,473.432,482.365,"Well, but is there some ordinary practice after you take a person's bags to get it back to them?"
1982.81-1617,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,482.365,485.52,The practice is to give it back to them as expeditiously as possible.
1982.81-1617,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,493.627,495.187,"Well, did they know where he was?"
1982.81-1617,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,495.187,496.548,"--No, they didn't know where he was."
1982.81-1617,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,501.2,502.327,They didn't know.
1982.81-1617,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,504.355,505.638,"Eventually they arrested him, yes."
1982.81-1617,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,505.638,506.512,That's what I thought.
1982.81-1617,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,515.335,518.209,There is not a published policy on this.
1982.81-1617,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,527.393,529.253,But that is not in the record in any event.
1982.81-1617,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,529.253,533.141,"Well, the record says they told him that they would return it to him."
1982.81-1617,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,535.797,537.937,"Well, of course, time means something."
1982.81-1617,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,553.539,565.627,"Well, first of all, if the person is concerned about getting his baggage back immediately, an innocent person, for example, might well have gone with them and would have gotten it back immediately after the 90 minutes, even--"
1982.81-1617,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,565.627,566.801,"Yes, but then your distinction about--"
1982.81-1617,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,568.159,569.722,--Wasn't he innocent?
1982.81-1617,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,569.722,570.299,Yes.
1982.81-1617,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,571.844,574.422,"No, he hadn't been convicted yet but he did have cocaine in his suitcase."
1982.81-1617,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,574.422,585.308,"Your distinction then about the difference between inconvenience in seizing luggage and seizing the person kind of falls apart, if the only way the person can get his luggage back is to go with his luggage."
1982.81-1617,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,585.308,587.461,"No, that is not the only way he can do it."
1982.81-1617,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,614.142,625.181,Is there any way of saying from the record how long the detention of a bag that turned up negative on the sniffing would have taken if the government had had dogs at LaGuardia?
1982.81-1617,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,625.181,629.37,If they had dogs stationed on a permanent basis at LaGuardia?
1982.81-1617,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,629.37,630.493,Yes.
1982.81-1617,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,630.493,632.227,It is hard to know.
1982.81-1617,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,675.581,676.693,"Well, there is certainly going to be some delay."
1982.81-1617,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,677.863,678.737,Yes.
1982.81-1617,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,680.768,685.471,"Mr. Horowitz, could I follow up on Justice Rehnquist's question?"
1982.81-1617,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,703.027,713.614,"--I think in theory if the Court approves of detention on a reasonable suspicion, that there would be cases where--"
1982.81-1617,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,713.614,723.39,"Probably over half the cases, because if you have more than 50 percent probability, you would have probable cause, and you want to have a lesser degree of probability to justify the seizures--"
1982.81-1617,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,723.39,734.59,"--That's true, but I think you also have to keep in mind that this is an inconvenience for the agents themselves, and that they are not going to want to go through this--"
1982.81-1617,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,734.59,740.119,"--No, but they do want to do it in a significant number of cases in which they really are not that sure they will find anything."
1982.81-1617,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,740.119,743.181,"--Well, I think they will want to do it only in cases where they have a really strong suspicion."
1982.81-1617,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,743.181,744.65,"Well, then probable cause should be enough."
1982.81-1617,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,744.65,747.821,"Well, what is a strong suspicion to--"
1982.81-1617,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,747.821,750.429,"I mean, they want to do it on less than probable cause."
1982.81-1617,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,750.429,764.908,"--I think there are cases where the agents in their own mind, based on their experience, may have a 75 to 80 percent probability, but they know that they have not met the objective standard of probable cause for going to a magistrate."
1982.81-1617,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,774.123,778.244,"Yes, but you want the rule to cover the agent who has only a 30 percent likelihood of success."
1982.81-1617,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,778.244,779.371,--That's true.
1982.81-1617,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,788.43,789.35,"But, as I say, we are dealing with probability."
1982.81-1617,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,794.599,802.842,"Exactly, but the intrusion that is involved in those cases is much greater, and therefore here the probability should be lowered."
1982.81-1617,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,804.172,813.465,"Is there any explanation in the record, or do you have one, for the delay from Friday to Monday?"
1982.81-1617,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,813.465,817.743,"As I understand it, the agents--"
1982.81-1617,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,817.743,822.976,"Aren't there magistrates on duty over the weekend in the Southern District, if that is where this was?"
1982.81-1617,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,824.383,833.036,--The agents were informed by the U.S. Attorney's Office in the Eastern District of New York that no magistrate was available at that time until Monday.
1982.81-1617,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,833.036,834.206,In some districts--
1982.81-1617,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,834.206,847.921,"Now, what they would have done if Place had called and sought to get his luggage back at that point, I'm not sure, but at least in this case, since there wasn't anything else they could do with the luggage anyway, it didn't seem unreasonable to wait until Monday."
1982.81-1617,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,847.921,856.652,"--Is it not true that in some districts there is 24-magistrate service, seven days a week, if you know?"
1982.81-1617,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,856.652,858.072,I don't know for sure.
1982.81-1617,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,869.458,871.552,"There is nothing in the record to show why, though."
1982.81-1617,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,876.688,877.315,That's right.
1982.81-1617,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,877.315,878.469,That's all the record shows.
1982.81-1617,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,878.469,879.561,That's correct.
1982.81-1617,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,955.235,972.337,"Mr. Horowitz, presumably the justification for the Terry type search and detention of the person was the protection of the officers from the use of weapons by the person detained."
1982.81-1617,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,978.912,987.78,"I don't think that's really the justification for the investigative stop in cases like Terry, Brignoni-Ponce, and Michigan against Summers."
1982.81-1617,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1300.075,1315.635,"Mr. Horowitz, would you think that you would apply the same theory you are arguing should be applied here to the seizure and detention of a handbag or briefcase from a person?"
1982.81-1617,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1315.635,1320.662,I would say yes.
1982.81-1617,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1327.52,1333.798,Do you think that it might be a sufficient intrusion that it obviously involves detaining the person?
1982.81-1617,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1347.354,1356.101,"I don't think so, Justice O'Connor, because as we said in our brief, we think it would be unreasonable for the police to keep all of that material."
1982.81-1617,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1366.082,1381.919,"But your opponent contests the government's assertion there, and says that the government, if it is sequestering an effect for purposes of later search, isn't going to allow unilateral access to a bag to get something out of it."
1982.81-1617,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1381.919,1399.444,"Well, they may not allow private access in the sense of a person going behind a locked door and taking whatever he wants out and disappearing, but certainly a person could open the suitcase, say, somewhere within the view of the officers, but in a way that doesn't expose the other contents of the suitcase."
1982.81-1617,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1399.444,1405.051,"Well, perhaps it is too short a time for argument to explain how that might be done."
1982.81-1617,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1407.549,1423.604,"Well, let me just say, if you had a briefcase sitting on the desk, and you opened it with the top towards me so that I couldn't see what was in there, and took a couple things out and then closed it again, I think the officers would be entitled to see what you had taken out of the briefcase, but I don't see why they would see what is in there."
1982.81-1617,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1423.604,1428.276,Isn't your distinction between a search and a seizure getting a little fuzzy right now?
1982.81-1617,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1428.276,1431.681,"I don't think so, Justice Stevens."
1982.81-1617,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1433.553,1434.991,"Well, you do want to watch what is taken out, though."
1982.81-1617,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1434.991,1436.801,"--Yes, we do want to watch what is taken out."
1982.81-1617,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1436.801,1442.284,"You wouldn't let him go into the men's room, say, all by himself with the suitcase and perhaps dispose of its contents, or something like that."
1982.81-1617,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1442.284,1444.877,"I agree, but I don't consider that a search of the suitcase."
1982.81-1617,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1489.233,1493.342,"Let me ask you another question, following up on Justice O'Connor's."
1982.81-1617,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1519.708,1527.421,--I think you would have to have some reason to suspect that there were... in the wallet.
1982.81-1617,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1527.421,1528.844,You have reasonable suspicion.
1982.81-1617,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1530.529,1535.418,"Yes, I understand you have reasonable suspicion that they are contained somewhere in the briefcase, but I think it would be an impossible--"
1982.81-1617,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1535.418,1536.791,--Including possibly in the wallet.
1982.81-1617,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1536.791,1543.307,"--Including possibly in the wallet, but I think you might need somewhat more focused suspicion if he was going to ask for a search of the wallet."
1982.81-1617,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1558.473,1569.045,"Well, supposing the suitcase has in it a big paper bag, and the man says, I have some private papers in this paper bag that I want to take out of the suitcase, and you think, well, maybe that is really the marijuana."
1982.81-1617,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1575.247,1584.007,"Well, I think the officer would be entitled to say that I am not going to let you leave with the paper bag unless you let me see to some extent what is in it."
1982.81-1617,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1584.007,1586.366,Then you have not solved Justice O'Connor's predicament.
1982.81-1617,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1586.366,1589.864,"Well, first of all, I mean, we are talking aut the general rule here."
1982.81-1617,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1599.893,1609.639,"Well, can you really say that, because most people put private personal possessions in their luggage and handbags and briefcases."
1982.81-1617,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1616.808,1624.226,"Well, I certainly don't think that people put the things that they can't do without for an hour and a half in the luggage that they check with the airlines."
1982.81-1617,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1657.211,1663.962,Mr. Clark.
1982.81-1617,1,29481,james_dexter_clark,,1663.962,1674.066,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, I had not planned to address myself to specific factual issues or discussions."
1982.81-1617,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1747.801,1752.598,"Well, Mr. Clark, you say the suspicions in the case of your client were quelled at Miami."
1982.81-1617,1,29481,james_dexter_clark,,1756.283,1768.2,"The reason they called ahead to LaGuardia was, in the words of Judge Platt, the presiding District Court judge, in his opinion, was why Mr. Place made a mistake."
1982.81-1617,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1793.956,1797.938,"It isn't really accurate, then, to say their suspicions were quelled, because they did call ahead."
1982.81-1617,1,29481,james_dexter_clark,,1797.938,1799.123,That's correct.
1982.81-1617,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1809.933,1815.509,"Well, I thought they discovered that he had a false address on his luggage tags."
1982.81-1617,1,29481,james_dexter_clark,,1815.509,1817.369,"That is not correct, Your Honor."
1982.81-1617,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1837.155,1840.185,But the disparity existed in fact.
1982.81-1617,1,29481,james_dexter_clark,,1840.185,1848.323,--The disparity existed in the fact that there was a strikeover in the numerical sequence of the numbers.
1982.81-1617,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1868.097,1872.251,"But in any event, it didn't satisfy the police in Miami."
1982.81-1617,1,29481,james_dexter_clark,,1872.251,1873.549,That's correct.
1982.81-1617,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1917.325,1922.044,But I thought he hadn't given them an address or a means whereby they could contact him.
1982.81-1617,1,29481,james_dexter_clark,,1922.044,1923.56,They had his address.
1982.81-1617,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1969.29,1975.365,"But the return of one bag and the search of the other really wouldn't help your client much in this case, would it?"
1982.81-1617,1,29481,james_dexter_clark,,1975.365,1976.286,Certainly not.
1982.81-1617,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2035.012,2040.09,"By stereotypes, you mean applying the profile?"
1982.81-1617,1,29481,james_dexter_clark,,2040.09,2042.901,--I am sorry?
1982.81-1617,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2042.901,2045.041,You used the term stereotypes.
1982.81-1617,1,29481,james_dexter_clark,,2046.211,2047.885,The so-called Terry exception.
1982.81-1617,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2047.885,2048.977,"--Oh, I thought you said stereotypes."
1982.81-1617,1,29481,james_dexter_clark,,2048.977,2050.037,"I am sorry, Your Honor."
1982.81-1617,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2080.542,2083.697,Those are your two major arguments?
1982.81-1617,1,29481,james_dexter_clark,,2083.697,2085.725,--Those are my two major arguments.
1982.81-1617,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2085.725,2092.101,I take it that the Court of Appeals just assumed that there was reasonable suspicion to make any stop at all.
1982.81-1617,1,29481,james_dexter_clark,,2092.101,2093.053,That is correct.
1982.81-1617,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2093.053,2093.864,They did not decide that.
1982.81-1617,1,29481,james_dexter_clark,,2093.864,2094.865,That is correct.
1982.81-1617,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2094.865,2103.015,"Now, do you submit here any argument for affirmance based on the fact that there wasn't even reasonable suspicion?"
1982.81-1617,1,29481,james_dexter_clark,,2103.015,2110.483,"Your Honor, we concede that there was reasonable suspicion to approach Mr. Place."
1982.81-1617,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2111.887,2116.433,"Well, was there reasonable suspicion to justify whatever a Terry stop is?"
1982.81-1617,1,29481,james_dexter_clark,,2116.433,2131.021,"--Well, quite frankly, we argued this at the Second Circuit, and cross-petitioned to this Court, and we did take the position that the suspicions that were raised by the Drug Courier Profile were not sufficient to warrant the initial approach."
1982.81-1617,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2131.021,2133.381,You have filed a cross-petition here?
1982.81-1617,1,29481,james_dexter_clark,,2133.381,2134.551,"It was denied, Your Honor."
1982.81-1617,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2134.551,2135.299,Yes.
1982.81-1617,1,29481,james_dexter_clark,,2137.455,2139.312,That reasonable suspicion existed.
1982.81-1617,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2139.312,2140.517,"--Well, the--"
1982.81-1617,1,29481,james_dexter_clark,,2140.517,2141.391,Perhaps.
1982.81-1617,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2141.391,2145.126,"--the District Court... I mean, the Court of Appeals didn't decide that issue one way or another."
1982.81-1617,1,29481,james_dexter_clark,,2146.125,2147.342,That is correct.
1982.81-1617,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2288.082,2291.424,You are speaking of the person or of the bag?
1982.81-1617,1,29481,james_dexter_clark,,2291.424,2292.376,Of the bag.
1982.81-1617,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2328.238,2329.408,And to pat him down.
1982.81-1617,1,29481,james_dexter_clark,,2329.408,2330.173,Pardon me?
1982.81-1617,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2330.173,2334.439,"And to pat him down, if there was some--"
1982.81-1617,1,29481,james_dexter_clark,,2337.126,2338.405,That is correct.
1982.81-1617,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2338.405,2347.495,"In this very case, your client's baggage was seized, and he went his way."
1982.81-1617,1,29481,james_dexter_clark,,2347.495,2367.284,"He certainly went his way, but the point is that the detention of the bag is even more intrusive because his bag did not go its way, and it is only through the questioning of Mr. Place or someone in his position that suspicions can be quelled as to a bag."
1982.81-1617,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2369.441,2379.435,"You say that the government would be in a better position here if it had not only detained the bag and taken it to Kennedy, but insisted that your client go with it."
1982.81-1617,1,29481,james_dexter_clark,,2380.73,2400.645,"My position would be that, first of all, if they had insisted on that, they would have arrested Mr. Place as well as the bag, and they admitted... the officers even admitted to Mr. Place that they did not have even a reasonable enough suspicion to hold him."
1982.81-1617,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2438.818,2446.94,"Certainly some minimal detention is justified under Terry, is it not, if there was in fact reasonable suspicion?"
1982.81-1617,1,29481,james_dexter_clark,,2446.94,2450.141,Some reasonable detention of the bag?
1982.81-1617,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2450.141,2451.155,Of the bag.
1982.81-1617,1,29481,james_dexter_clark,,2451.155,2453.951,Your Honor--
1982.81-1617,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2453.951,2457.983,I don't see how you can read Van Leeuwen and conclude otherwise.
1982.81-1617,1,29481,james_dexter_clark,,2457.983,2464.215,--I can read Van Leeuwen and conclude otherwise on several significant points.
1982.81-1617,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2464.215,2465.198,What are they?
1982.81-1617,1,29481,james_dexter_clark,,2465.198,2476.756,"The significant points are that first, in Van Leeuwen, the owner of the two parcels, the defendant, voluntarily relinquished those bags into the U.S. mail."
1982.81-1617,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2481.957,2485.002,But the Van Leeuwen court didn't rely on that at all.
1982.81-1617,1,29481,james_dexter_clark,,2492.95,2537.354,"The way I understand Van Leeuwen, they said that at some point in time, even a seizure such as the one in this case will become unreasonable, but the reason that such a seizure in the Van Leeuwen case was not considered unreasonable was because the defendant had voluntarily relinquished the bags, and for the period of time that they were detained, the defendant in that case was probably not even aware that a seizure was occurring, because until the addressee in Van Leeuwen became aware that the parcels had not arrived, and contacted Mr. Van Leeuwen, he probably was going about his merry way, and his mobility was not restrained, as it certainly was in this instance."
1982.81-1617,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2550.32,2565.641,"Well, but that may factually distinguish Van Leeuwen, but the case does hold that a parcel as opposed to a person may be subjected to some sort of reasonable detention on a Terry type analysis, and not requiring probable cause."
1982.81-1617,1,29481,james_dexter_clark,,2565.641,2577.308,"The case seems to suggest that, but I would also point out that the case, by language utilized in the case itself, limited the holding of that case to the facts as presented by that case."
1982.81-1617,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2747.706,2762.622,"You know, as we hear these cases, Mr. Clark, we are all aware that we don't judge the validity of a search by the fruits of a search."
1982.81-1617,1,29481,james_dexter_clark,,2798.013,2823.24,"Your Honor, I believe... I was going to reserve for my closing statement a request that prior to reaching a decision in this case, that the members of this Court review the opinion that was written in Coolidge versus New Hampshire."
1982.81-1617,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2849.074,2852.338,Is that the Court's opinion or the opinion of the plurality?
1982.81-1617,1,29481,james_dexter_clark,,2853.851,2858.07,"--Section 2, and as I recall--"
1982.81-1617,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2858.07,2863.253,Part of Section 2 is only a plurality.
1982.81-1617,1,29481,james_dexter_clark,,2863.253,2887.102,"--Yes, but anyway, at Section 2, Page 454, Mr. Justice Bradley is quoted, and then Mr. Justice Stewart, who wrote the opinion, adds some language of his own, and in reading that particular section, I handed it to my companion and I said, read this."
1982.81-1617,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2948.922,2962.056,"Well, in murder cases and kidnapping cases we don't have uniformly a search and seizure problem, and almost uniformly and invariably we have that problem in drug prosecutions."
1982.81-1617,1,29481,james_dexter_clark,,2962.056,3007.975,"I think that is probably all the more reason that this Court should be very aware and cognizant of the preservation of Fourth Amendment rights which have been jealously guarded by this Court throughout its history, most significantly in the twentieth century, but certainly from the beginning of the twentieth century, when the cases that are cited in our brief as being the historical precedents for Fourth Amendment rights... I hate to see an erosion of those rights merely directed at the prevention of narcotics trafficking."
1982.81-1617,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3162.721,3164.456,"We will resume there at 1:00 o'clock, counsel."
1982.81-1617,1,29481,james_dexter_clark,,3164.456,3165.704,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1982.81-1617,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3165.704,3184.886,Does Mr. Clark have any time remaining?
1982.81-1617,2,42580,the_clerk,,3184.886,3186.258,Five minutes and 30 seconds.
1982.81-1617,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3186.258,3187.634,Very well.
1982.81-1617,3,29481,james_dexter_clark,,3187.634,3216.324,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and members of the Court, without being redundant, I do want to just basically pick up where I began by stating that I was pointing out to the Court what I feel to be significant in that it is implicitly present in Arkansas versus Sanders and the Chadwick cases, and that is, I have divided the right to privacy into three elements as opposed to the one which is proposed by the government."
1982.81-1617,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3457.165,3457.727,Very well.
1982.81-1617,4,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,3459.992,3462.523,"A view brief points, Mr. Chief Justice."
1982.81-1617,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3666.752,3671.828,Do you think the issue of reasonable suspicion is foreclosed?
1982.81-1617,4,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,3671.828,3679.463,"Well, ordinarily the Court is entitled to affirm the judgment below on other grounds."
1982.81-1617,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3694.82,3701.973,"I suppose if there was not reasonable suspicion, the search of the luggage might be a fruit."
1982.81-1617,4,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,3701.973,3707.143,"Well, if there was not reasonable suspicion, then they would not have been entitled to detain the luggage."
1982.81-1617,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3707.143,3707.783,Yes.
1982.81-1617,4,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,3707.783,3708.922,"I mean, we concede that they had to have--"
1982.81-1617,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3708.922,3710.25,But they did.
1982.81-1617,4,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,3712.344,3712.78,--That's right.
1982.81-1617,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3715.842,3717.074,"Thank you, gentlemen."
