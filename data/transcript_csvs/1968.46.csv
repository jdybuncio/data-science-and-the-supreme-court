1968.46,0,36947,melvin_l_wulf,,31.162,34.539,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1968.46,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,517.299,523.563,"What was the law prior to 10 (b) (3), what was the statute prior to 10 (b) (3) or wasn't there any?"
1968.46,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1678.138,1683.102,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1968.46,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2738.324,2744.012,Well is it a crime under the Act not to be in possession of the registration certificate?
1968.46,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2744.012,2750.12,It is -- Mr. Justice it is not a crime under the Act not to be in possession of the registration certificate.
1968.46,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2763.521,2781.069,"Alright, well then do you mean what your argument leads you to say that this petitioner could not be prosecuted for the crime of violating the regulation which requires him to know the --"
1968.46,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2781.069,2782.62,"No. No, Mr. Justice --"
1968.46,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2782.62,2784.5,He could be prosecuted for that.
1968.46,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2784.5,2785.818,He could be prosecuted for that kind.
1968.46,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2785.818,2791.231,Because the statutory exemption extends only to service and training.
1968.46,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2791.231,2791.98,"Yes, Mr. Justice."
1968.46,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2791.98,2824.127,"So, that is failure to be in possession of his certificate is a crime for which he could be punished but then you get into the rather well anyway, first glance or rather start a situation where the petitioner here, a ministerial student is not in possession of his certificate, that's a violation of law."
1968.46,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2835.199,2836.321,"Yes, Mr. Justice."
1968.46,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2842.169,2843.546,"Sure, I understand that."
1968.46,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2861.268,2869.172,Because one comes within the terms of a statute which says that he shall be exempt from training and service under this act and the other does not.
1968.46,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2869.172,2889.781,"Yes, but that the next question is does that affect the jurisdictional or procedural provision and in the statute it says that the person concerned the registrant has to exhaust his administrator remedies or whatever?"
1968.46,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2889.781,2895.38,"Well, Mr. Justice in this case, the allegation is that he did exhaust his administrative remedies."
1968.46,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2929.356,2937.889,"Well, but in effect this petitioner would -- because he is a ministerial student in your submission."
1968.46,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2949.566,2962.075,"No, Mr. Justice and perhaps its equivalent, what I suggest he can do is to challenge the order to report for induction, which is what he has done by this suit."
1968.46,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2962.075,2971.141,But he couldn't challenge -- he could not challenge the regulation requiring him to be in possession of his registration stipulation.
1968.46,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2974.249,2975.141,"Yes, I do."
1968.46,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3223.581,3237.138,"Well, I suppose that if you're referring to the 1967 congressional reference to delinquency as to ratification of the delinquency procedure."
1968.46,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,3254.348,3256.857,"Now, that is a possible construction."
1968.46,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3273.168,3275.114,I'm not talking about that.
1968.46,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,3312.176,3315.41,That Mr. Justice is certainly a possible argument.
1968.46,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3385.312,3386.54,Mr. Wulf?
1968.46,2,36947,melvin_l_wulf,,3386.54,3388.336,"Mr. Chief Justice, may I please the Court."
