1967.67,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,21.483,"Number 67, John W. Terry, et al., petitioners versus Ohio."
1967.67,0,35138,louis_stokes,,23.161,27.163,Mr. Chief Justice and May it please the court.
1967.67,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,164.665,166.627,"What kind of neighborhood is that, generally, in Cleveland?"
1967.67,0,35138,louis_stokes,,167.399,171.819,"That is our downtown section, a business section of the City, Your Honor."
1967.67,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,171.819,175.288,"Downtown retail stores, and offices, and so on?"
1967.67,0,35138,louis_stokes,,175.288,176.441,"Yes, Your Honor."
1967.67,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,185.998,186.98,What time of day was it?
1967.67,0,35138,louis_stokes,,186.98,188.555,2:30 in the afternoon.
1967.67,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,188.555,189.544,On a weekday?
1967.67,0,35138,louis_stokes,,189.544,193.083,On a weekday.
1967.67,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,277.728,279.545,What kind of a store is Zucker's Store?
1967.67,0,35138,louis_stokes,,279.545,283.688,"Zucker's is a haberdashery, Your Honor."
1967.67,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,460.036,461.354,He said what?
1967.67,0,35138,louis_stokes,,463.567,464.095,In the record --
1967.67,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,464.095,465.825,What was his answer?
1967.67,0,35138,louis_stokes,,465.825,468.818,"He said, Well, to tell you the truth, I didn't like them."
1967.67,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,468.818,469.742,He didn't like them?
1967.67,0,35138,louis_stokes,,469.742,470.773,Yes.
1967.67,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,505.628,506.681,Was he in plain clothes?
1967.67,0,35138,louis_stokes,,506.681,509.454,"He was in plain clothes, Your Honor."
1967.67,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,750.0,766.815,I suppose the -- your contention here is that the policemen had --there is nothing in the record to indicate that the policeman had any reason to fear bodily harm to himself?
1967.67,0,35138,louis_stokes,,766.815,771.356,"Well, we're saying that and we're saying in addition to that, this Your Honor."
1967.67,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,802.282,803.227,I understand that.
1967.67,0,35138,louis_stokes,,828.214,833.055,"There is nothing in the record whatsoever, and we might add--"
1967.67,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,833.055,849.772,"What happened here, and perhaps it would be your contention that the policeman was engaged in a search for evidence when he spun Terry around and put his hand inside of his coat."
1967.67,0,35138,louis_stokes,,851.585,855.116,"This is our position, Mr. Justice Fortas."
1967.67,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,855.116,872.439,"I don't understand your answer to Mr. Justice Fortas when you said there is nothing in the record to indicate, that the policeman didn't have the concern for his own personal safety, because I thought he said that, based on his intuition, he thought these people were casing the place in order to rob it."
1967.67,0,35138,louis_stokes,,873.65,874.737,This is what he said.
1967.67,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,874.737,884.153,"Well presumably, then, he would be armed; and the minute he walked up to talk to them, he would quite reasonably be concerned for his own personal safety, I should think."
1967.67,0,35138,louis_stokes,,884.153,898.231,"Well, if I understood Mr. Justice Fortas' question correctly, I understood him to say, was there anything in the record which indicated he had any reason to be concerned with his own personal safety?"
1967.67,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,898.231,911.042,"Well this much was in the record, that he thought, whether with, or without, reasonable cause, he thought or suspected that these were armed robbers about ready to hold up a place."
1967.67,0,35138,louis_stokes,,926.784,927.926,"Yes, Your Honor."
1967.67,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,927.926,928.607,Is that so?
1967.67,0,35138,louis_stokes,,939.868,940.195,Yes.
1967.67,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,947.78,949.682,He testified to that effect?
1967.67,0,35138,louis_stokes,,949.682,953.272,"Yes, he did."
1967.67,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1001.996,1030.684,"But, Mr. Stokes, do you really think that if there is enough to suggest that he had reason to believe they had weapons, if that's so then it is justified for that reason in asking them what they were doing, don't you think he would be justified in the first instance in confirming whether or not they did have weapons before he went on further to interrogate them, or even to interrogate him at all?"
1967.67,0,35138,louis_stokes,,1030.684,1036.968,"Well, if I understand your question properly, Mr. Justice, you do preface it by saying if there is enough?"
1967.67,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1036.968,1049.709,"That is right, yes, in this colloquy you and Mr. Justice Fortas and Mr. Justice Stewart were having, on the premise that it was reasonable for him to think that they had weapons."
1967.67,0,35138,louis_stokes,,1049.709,1061.256,"Well, if there was enough, if the constitutional criteria had been met, I would say, yes, I have no quarrel with the fact that where one makes a valid arrest--"
1967.67,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1061.256,1074.297,"Well, did you quarrel with the fact that--or do you suggest there had to be more than appeared, before he could ask him a question?"
1967.67,0,35138,louis_stokes,,1074.297,1078.125,"No, I say if he wanted to, he had the right to ask them a question."
1967.67,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1078.125,1090.794,"Well, now, if he had the right to ask them a question, lay that aside for a moment, and he also had reason to think they might have weapons on them, would he have to question before he frisked him for weapons?"
1967.67,0,35138,louis_stokes,,1090.794,1099.598,"Well, if we are to say, first, that he has a right to question, I am saying that he can exercise a discretion if he chooses."
1967.67,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1103.268,1104.291,No.
1967.67,0,35138,louis_stokes,,1114.121,1132.16,"Yes, I am saying that, Mr. Justice. I am saying that where a citizen is on the streets, and where all of the criteria that we know of by way of the development of probable cause is absent, in that situation--"
1967.67,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1132.16,1136.992,"That, then, the officer has no right to stop and ask, what's your name?"
1967.67,0,35138,louis_stokes,,1139.881,1148.223,"Well, if we are going to use the absolute term no right, and we're to be held to that, then I would just have to say he has no right."
1967.67,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1169.695,1182.816,"Well, may we try to get at it, in this way, Mr. Stokes, up to the point where he spun Terry around, had he done anything outside what a policeman might properly do?"
1967.67,0,35138,louis_stokes,,1182.816,1183.073,No.
1967.67,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1186.468,1194.676,"Now, if then at that juncture he had reason to believe they might be armed, did he have to complete his questioning first?"
1967.67,0,35138,louis_stokes,,1200.266,1210.23,"I would say that under the circumstances presented to me, that he did not under those circumstances have the right to lay hands on this citizen and spin him around."
1967.67,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1210.23,1218.388,This would be because you do not think the record shows that he had any reason to believe they had weapons?
1967.67,0,35138,louis_stokes,,1218.388,1242.198,"No that he didn't have -- I am saying that at the point that you lay the hand on the citizen, and you begin to exercise dominion over that citizen on the street by spinning him around, I am saying, in order for you to do this you must have the probable cause that is required to place a person under arrest, because if the person is substantially under your custody, your dominion--"
1967.67,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1242.198,1247.829,"Then you mean he can't frisk for weapons, without probable cause to arrest?"
1967.67,0,35138,louis_stokes,,1249.33,1252.83,Yes.
1967.67,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1252.83,1255.035,How long had he been observing?
1967.67,0,35138,louis_stokes,,1255.035,1261.541,"A period of ten to twelve minutes, Your Honor."
1967.67,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1383.019,1389.339,"Mr. Stokes, I wonder if that could be broken down a little?"
1967.67,0,35138,louis_stokes,,1500.597,1509.817,"Only if we're going to relax the standard of probable cause, as we know it, under the Fourth Amendment."
1967.67,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1542.585,1553.506,"Police officers are very often in a position where they might not be able to make an actual arrest, but they are in a position of great danger."
1967.67,0,35138,louis_stokes,,1569.703,1570.723,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice."
1967.67,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1603.318,1611.565,"Take a situation of this kind, where a police officer sees someone acting very peculiarly."
1967.67,0,35138,louis_stokes,,1659.224,1664.997,"I think we are faced with this, Mr. Chief Justice."
1967.67,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1699.853,1701.588,I'm not arguing with you.
1967.67,0,35138,louis_stokes,,1709.685,1720.087,"Certainly, Your Honor."
1967.67,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1853.011,1871.053,Mr. Payne?
1967.67,1,40192,reuben_m_payne,,1871.053,1886.625,"Mr. Chief Justice, it please the members of the court, at the outset, may I direct my attention to page 19 of my brief."
1967.67,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1965.275,1976.672,"The question I had in my mind was this, I can understand why you have a difference of words, this scale a little below."
1967.67,1,40192,reuben_m_payne,,1994.361,2005.67,"I cannot see any basic difference in having a reasonable suspicion and equating it with the term probable cause, in of itself."
1967.67,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2053.471,2058.348,What do you understand probable cause to mean?
1967.67,1,40192,reuben_m_payne,,2058.348,2066.275,"I understand probable cause to mean, for an arrest, that --"
1967.67,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2066.275,2066.994,Wait a second.
1967.67,1,40192,reuben_m_payne,,2070.985,2089.931,"When a person is observed in circumstances which suggest that he has committed, or is about to commit a felony or a misdemeanor, and such action is reasonably necessary to enable the officer to determine the lawfulness of the person's conduct; and the key word here is the circumstances at that particular time."
1967.67,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2089.931,2103.668,"Would you mind telling me, in your language -- plain ordinary language -- what you understand to be meant when somebody says, for that reason, says that a thing is probable cause to believe that something will happen?"
1967.67,1,40192,reuben_m_payne,,2103.668,2116.778,"I understand that to mean the taking into consideration of the totality of the circumstances, as a responsible person views it, at that particular time in relation to his work."
1967.67,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2141.61,2145.023,Do you understand it to mean reasonable grounds to believe something is going to happen?
1967.67,1,40192,reuben_m_payne,,2145.023,2149.191,I understand -- I believe that it does mean reasonable grounds that something is going to happen.
1967.67,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2149.191,2151.853,"It does not mean, does it, that it's bound to happen?"
1967.67,1,40192,reuben_m_payne,,2151.853,2154.994,It does not mean that it is bound to happen.
1967.67,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2154.994,2160.12,"Therefore, you've got to have something that is ‘‘reasonable grounds'' for saying you believe it will happen."
1967.67,1,40192,reuben_m_payne,,2160.12,2162.226,"I agree with you, sir."
1967.67,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2162.226,2173.227,"Mr. Payne, in this case this arresting officer testified, did he not, that he had never seen anybody for a case a joint?"
1967.67,1,40192,reuben_m_payne,,2173.227,2174.638,That is correct; he did so testify.
1967.67,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2174.638,2187.649,"He also testified that he had been on that same area for some thirty years, doing the following things: Checking for pick-pockets, and shoplifters?"
1967.67,1,40192,reuben_m_payne,,2187.649,2189.466,That's correct.
1967.67,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2189.466,2194.823,"So, where did he get his expertise about somebody about to commit a robbery?"
1967.67,1,40192,reuben_m_payne,,2194.823,2217.273,"I think that he would get his expertise by virtue of the fact that he had been a member of the police department for forty years, and by being a member of the police department for forty years I am quite sure that, even if by osmosis, some knowledge would have to come to him of the various degrees of crimes --"
1967.67,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2217.273,2220.913,Now we're getting intuition by osmosis?[Laughter]
1967.67,1,40192,reuben_m_payne,,2220.913,2222.666,"Not at all, sir."
1967.67,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2250.489,2256.49,There are exceptions to this. [Laughter]
1967.67,1,40192,reuben_m_payne,,2256.49,2261.067,I would agree with the Court in these circumstances also.
1967.67,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2261.067,2277.764,"Seriously, Mr. Payne, the point is that the only thing he noticed was: A man leaves from a position of talking to another man and goes across the street, looks in a window, and goes back."
1967.67,1,40192,reuben_m_payne,,2285.879,2287.235,I agree.
1967.67,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2287.235,2289.905,"What they did it twice, or three times."
1967.67,1,40192,reuben_m_payne,,2292.582,2292.743,It was --
1967.67,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2292.743,2296.189,It was not too clear to me from the record.
1967.67,1,40192,reuben_m_payne,,2296.189,2309.514,"May I then, in response to the Justice's question, indicate first of all, and clarify this, his testimony was not that he didn't like him."
1967.67,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2334.943,2337.988,"That they beared watching, you would say?"
1967.67,1,40192,reuben_m_payne,,2337.988,2338.399,I'm sorry.
1967.67,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2338.661,2340.747,They beared watching?
1967.67,1,40192,reuben_m_payne,,2340.747,2342.936,They beared watching.
1967.67,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2481.311,2489.032,"But didn't your own court say they did not have probable cause to arrest, as of this point we are now talking about?"
1967.67,1,40192,reuben_m_payne,,2489.032,2505.9,"The trial court indicated that, at this point, that there was not probable cause for arrest. The appellate court did indicate that there was probable cause for arrest, after the frisk took place."
1967.67,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2505.9,2508.349,"No, I mean -- well, we haven't frisked him yet."
1967.67,1,40192,reuben_m_payne,,2508.349,2509.54,That is correct.
1967.67,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2509.54,2513.579,"So he didn't have probable cause to arrest, when he approached."
1967.67,1,40192,reuben_m_payne,,2513.579,2516.383,I would agree with this.
1967.67,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2516.383,2521.351,And he didn't get probable cause until he put his hands on the butt of the gun.
1967.67,1,40192,reuben_m_payne,,2521.351,2523.998,He didn't get probable cause to arrest--
1967.67,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2523.998,2530.033,"-- him until he put his hands on the butt of the gun, in his inside coat pocket."
1967.67,1,40192,reuben_m_payne,,2530.033,2531.455,"No, sir."
1967.67,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2531.455,2532.297,Is that right?
1967.67,1,40192,reuben_m_payne,,2532.297,2532.875,"No, sir."
1967.67,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2532.875,2534.201,When did he get probable cause to arrest?
1967.67,1,40192,reuben_m_payne,,2534.201,2556.694,"He received probable cause for arrest when he turned Terry around and ran his hands over the outside of his clothing and, feeling a gun in the upper left-breast pocket, and indicating emphatically at that time that, What I felt was a gun, a weapon."
1967.67,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2556.694,2564.929,"Well, he didn't have it, as counsel for petitioner says, he didn't have it when he laid hands on him and turned him around?"
1967.67,1,40192,reuben_m_payne,,2564.929,2566.732,I would agree.
1967.67,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2569.312,2569.933,Right.
1967.67,1,40192,reuben_m_payne,,2569.933,2577.902,"I would agree that he would have probable cause to frisk, or to lay hands on him, at this point."
1967.67,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2577.902,2578.702,Why?
1967.67,1,40192,reuben_m_payne,,2578.702,2584.503,Because of the nature of the circumstances and protection of his own life.
1967.67,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2584.503,2589.866,"He didn't say he saw the gun bulging, or anything like that?"
1967.67,1,40192,reuben_m_payne,,2589.866,2593.099,"No, he did not say that he saw a gun bulging."
1967.67,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2627.036,2630.879,What was the colloquy at that point?
1967.67,1,40192,reuben_m_payne,,2630.879,2639.969,The question which was put to them by the officers: What are your names?
1967.67,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2674.724,2705.609,"Mr. Payne, regarding the use of -- you have said repeatedly now, if I understand you, that probable cause -- are you saying something like this: that while there may not have been probable cause to arrest, in the sense of taking him to the police station and booking him for some crime, that at least in these circumstances there was probable cause to arrest, in the sense of asking them questions such as: Who are you, and what are you doing here?"
1967.67,1,40192,reuben_m_payne,,2708.883,2712.418,I hesitate in the use of the term arrest.
1967.67,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2712.418,2733.426,"You are saying probable cause, in these circumstances -- and I gather what you must mean -- is that if the detainment is an arrest, it was to be a detention only long enough to find out what they were doing."
1967.67,1,40192,reuben_m_payne,,2734.947,2735.767,That is correct.
1967.67,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2735.767,2746.95,"And that then, if the officer had probable cause to think they had weapons on them, that in those circumstances he was justified in frisking them for weapons."
1967.67,1,40192,reuben_m_payne,,2747.706,2749.149,That is correct.
1967.67,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2769.973,2774.453,Well that's what I understood to be your argument in the use of probable cause.
1967.67,1,40192,reuben_m_payne,,2792.863,2805.011,"Under Ohio law, I could not agree with this concept because under Ohio law the definition of arrest, is by statute."
1967.67,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2805.011,2812.758,"Well, forgetting Ohio law for a moment, how about for the purposes of the Fourth Amendment?"
1967.67,1,40192,reuben_m_payne,,2812.758,2821.607,"For the purposes of the Fourth Amendment, it would be reasonable action on the part of this officer --"
1967.67,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2821.607,2828.711,"But I thought you agreed with Justice Black before, that really, reasonable action and probable cause are pretty much synonymous terms?"
1967.67,1,40192,reuben_m_payne,,2828.711,2831.161,"I do, Your Honor."
1967.67,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2831.161,2835.617,So we can stick to the jargon of probable cause and make the distinction that way?
1967.67,1,40192,reuben_m_payne,,2835.617,2836.002,I agree.
1967.67,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2844.072,2865.856,"As I see it, what you and your case are really substantially arguing is that to stop a man, or to ask him a question by an officer, is not an arrest under the Fourth Amendment description of an arrest?"
1967.67,1,40192,reuben_m_payne,,2865.856,2868.142,It is not an arrest.
1967.67,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2868.142,2871.626,It seems to me that that's the real basis of your argument.
1967.67,1,40192,reuben_m_payne,,2878.647,2880.779,It does not arrest him to ask him a question.
1967.67,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2880.779,2885.423,"And I imagine you're saying, also, it doesn't necessarily arrest him to touch him?"
1967.67,1,40192,reuben_m_payne,,2885.423,2887.201,It does not arrest him to touch him.
1967.67,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2887.201,2891.517,"It might be an assault, but not an arrest, under the constitutional meaning?"
1967.67,1,40192,reuben_m_payne,,2891.517,2895.683,It does not interfere with his freedom in a significant way.
1967.67,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2895.683,2898.206,"He hasn't taken him into custody, you say?"
1967.67,1,40192,reuben_m_payne,,2898.206,2898.601,That is correct.
1967.67,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2898.601,2900.837,"That is, under an arrest?"
1967.67,1,40192,reuben_m_payne,,2900.837,2901.613,That is absolutely correct.
1967.67,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2901.613,2912.587,"Well, Mr. Payne, that's not quite the same thing you said to me."
1967.67,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2912.587,2914.6,I don't understand.
1967.67,1,40192,reuben_m_payne,,2947.169,2957.745,"I did not mean to imply -- because I had indicated to the Court that certainly arrest, in Ohio, is defined by statute."
1967.67,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2972.784,2981.871,"It's certainly not an arrest in the sense of taking him to the station house and booking him for a crime; but, if he's detained, isn't it in the nature of an arrest?"
1967.67,1,40192,reuben_m_payne,,2981.871,2982.684,No.
1967.67,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2982.684,2995.277,"Well, Mr. Payne, couldn't you say that when he laid hands on him and swung him around that petitioner's freedom of movement was arrested?"
1967.67,1,40192,reuben_m_payne,,2995.277,3000.569,I would agree that his freedom of movement was arrested.
1967.67,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3000.569,3003.256,But that's not arrest.
1967.67,1,40192,reuben_m_payne,,3003.256,3011.702,I do not agree that his freedom of movement was arrested in a significant way.
1967.67,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3011.702,3013.333,You mean because he only turned him around?
1967.67,1,40192,reuben_m_payne,,3015.299,3017.131,No.
1967.67,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3020.384,3028.216,"Well, in this particular case he laid hands on him, and swung him around."
1967.67,1,40192,reuben_m_payne,,3041.382,3043.48,If there had been no more --
1967.67,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3043.48,3043.88,No.
1967.67,1,40192,reuben_m_payne,,3055.523,3059.768,Some time after he was convicted of the crime of carrying a concealed weapon.
1967.67,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3059.768,3064.193,"So his freedom was arrested, for quite a while."
1967.67,1,40192,reuben_m_payne,,3064.193,3078.105,"Not on the basis of his swinging him around; but on the basis of the concealed weapon which he was carrying, and the crime that he was committing in the presence of the officer at that time."
1967.67,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3078.105,3085.972,You don't deny he was arrested; you're arguing about what time before he was arrested.
1967.67,1,40192,reuben_m_payne,,3085.972,3088.965,That is correct.
1967.67,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3088.965,3091.706,When did the arrest take place?
1967.67,1,40192,reuben_m_payne,,3100.987,3113.98,"Speaking in ordinary terms, he was arrested after the officer dropped that weapon and ordered them into the interior of the store."
1967.67,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3167.788,3171.098,"Let's use the Fourth Amendment language, then."
1967.67,1,40192,reuben_m_payne,,3182.424,3187.485,The first seizure of the person was at the time that he ordered them into the store.
1967.67,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3187.485,3192.813,You mean when he took Terry and swung him around there was no seizure of the person?
1967.67,1,40192,reuben_m_payne,,3192.813,3197.708,"I think there was a temporary detaining, or interference with his person."
1967.67,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3197.708,3200.134,"Well, he had his hands on him and he switched him around."
1967.67,1,40192,reuben_m_payne,,3202.91,3207.701,But here again we're dealing in simply semantic words.
1967.67,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3207.701,3209.269,"That word is in the Fourth Amendment, isn't it?"
1967.67,1,40192,reuben_m_payne,,3209.269,3214.084,"I agree that it is, sir."
1967.67,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3214.084,3218.803,What is the difference between seizure and arrest?
1967.67,1,40192,reuben_m_payne,,3238.86,3245.759,It is an arrest that I understand we are discussing in this matter.
1967.67,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3245.759,3250.488,"An officer could very easily turn a man around, without arresting him, couldn't you?"
1967.67,1,40192,reuben_m_payne,,3250.488,3251.255,I agree with this --
1967.67,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3251.255,3254.93,"It might not be easy, depending on his size --"
1967.67,1,40192,reuben_m_payne,,3254.93,3275.773,"-- that he could very easily turn the man around, and some may term that as a seizure of the person himself; but I would not term that it as a seizure of the person himself unless he has the intention of taking that person into custody, even though he may lay hands on him at that particular time."
1967.67,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3275.773,3284.796,"Well, he undoubtedly did this when he ordered them to get into the store and turn their palms towards the wall and stand there."
1967.67,1,40192,reuben_m_payne,,3287.579,3289.408,I would agree.
1967.67,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3678.585,3681.212,You may have three more minutes to finish.
1967.67,2,35138,louis_stokes,,3681.212,3682.252,"Thank You, Your Honor."
1967.67,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3682.252,3685.518,Your time had expired.
1967.67,2,35138,louis_stokes,,3685.518,3687.883,Thank you very much.
1967.67,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3687.883,3712.669,"We would just ask the Court to consider that, on the state of the record, this police officer is acting upon the suspicion he has that these two men are casing a place; that the stores where they are supposedly casing, are located on Huron Avenue at Fourteenth Street at the apex."
1967.67,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3786.96,3792.529,Let me ask you if this is not what you're really asking us to hold -- I'm not saying we shouldn't.
1967.67,2,35138,louis_stokes,,3822.114,3824.452,I can't take it that far.
1967.67,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3824.452,3826.559,"Well, how far would you take it?"
1967.67,2,35138,louis_stokes,,3826.559,3860.499,"I'm saying that where the police officer chooses, with reference to whatever his determination has been, to interrogate or to investigate further with respect to citizens lawfully on the street, that in order to exercise dominion or custody or control over that citizen, and thereby deprive him of his rights under the Fourth Amendment, that he must have before approaching him that probable cause which this Court has made reference to in its decisions."
1967.67,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3860.499,3866.002,"Well, what about asking him questions and expecting him to answer?"
1967.67,2,35138,louis_stokes,,3866.002,3869.057,He has the right to approach him and ask his questions.
1967.67,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3869.057,3875.21,"Does he has a right to expect an answer, and to do anything whatever if he doesn't get it?"
1967.67,2,35138,louis_stokes,,3875.21,3892.159,"I think that in the absence of this person having committed any crime of any sort, and where the approach is based on suspicion alone, the person being subjected to the interrogation has the right to refuse to answer, or to turn away."
1967.67,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3892.159,3920.772,"What you're saying is that a policeman does not have the right to ask a person a question on the street and get an answer, or to keep him, or do anything else except just ask him a question, unless he's in possession of sufficient facts to know that he has probable cause to believe that that man has committed a crime or is about to commit a crime?"
1967.67,2,35138,louis_stokes,,3920.772,3925.866,"Mr. Justice, I'm sorry if I'm giving you the impression that a police officer cannot ask him a question."
1967.67,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3925.866,3934.835,"I said, can ask him a question, but cannot get an answer, and do nothing about it."
1967.67,2,35138,louis_stokes,,3934.835,3936.413,"He can arrest him, if he chooses."
1967.67,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3936.413,3938.155,He can arrest him.
1967.67,2,35138,louis_stokes,,3943.949,3947.063,Then I don't think he has that right.
1967.67,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3947.063,3962.938,"Then the man can go on and off, not answer the question because the officer doesn't have at that time a sufficient amount of evidence to make a case of probable cause that he has committed a crime?"
1967.67,2,35138,louis_stokes,,3962.938,3970.32,"That is precisely what I'm saying, because otherwise the Fourth's -- inviolate right of privacy is being invaded."
1967.67,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3970.32,3971.606,I thought that was it.
1967.67,2,35138,louis_stokes,,3971.606,3973.046,"Yes, sir."
1967.67,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3973.046,3974.297,"Very well, Mr. Stokes."
1967.67,2,35138,louis_stokes,,3974.297,3975.673,Thank you.
