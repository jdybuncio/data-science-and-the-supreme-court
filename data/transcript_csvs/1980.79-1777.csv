1980.79-1777,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,11.991,We will hear arguments now in Complete Auto Transit v. Reis.
1980.79-1777,0,39465,r_ian_hunter,,74.798,78.933,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1980.79-1777,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,121.193,125.328,Is this exclusively a question under Section 301?
1980.79-1777,0,39465,r_ian_hunter,,125.328,126.411,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1980.79-1777,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,126.411,127.78,Of the 1947 Act?
1980.79-1777,0,39465,r_ian_hunter,,127.78,130.982,"Yes, it is, Your Honor."
1980.79-1777,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,165.403,174.175,You're equating that to ordinary breach of contract between private parties?
1980.79-1777,0,39465,r_ian_hunter,,174.175,179.579,I'm equating it to the violation of the agreement that contained a no strike clause.
1980.79-1777,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,179.579,183.95,Just as though there was no union entity involved?
1980.79-1777,0,39465,r_ian_hunter,,183.95,197.207,"Well, I can't involve a collective bargaining agreement without acknowledging the role of the union, but I do know that the no strike clause should be equally enforceable against the employees as well as the union."
1980.79-1777,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,197.207,203.778,Just as though 124 individuals had signed a contract with the employer without any union?
1980.79-1777,0,39465,r_ian_hunter,,203.778,206.896,"To the degree that they signed a no strike clause, yes."
1980.79-1777,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,207.596,207.996,Yes.
1980.79-1777,0,39465,r_ian_hunter,,210.448,232.861,Petitioner employers now attempt to hold these employees responsible for the damages directly resulting from their individualized breaches of the collective bargaining agreement pursuant to this lawsuit brought in accordance with Section 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act.
1980.79-1777,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,276.04,284.913,"Well, I gather though the statutes, the genesis, initially, was that there wasn't any way previously of suing unions."
1980.79-1777,0,39465,r_ian_hunter,,284.913,286.932,"Yes, that was one of the principal concerns."
1980.79-1777,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,286.932,291.65,And 301 was enacted so that unions might be made subject to suits.
1980.79-1777,0,39465,r_ian_hunter,,291.65,292.05,That's right.
1980.79-1777,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,295.704,303.042,"Well, I know, but... it may not have been the only one, but was there one that individual employees should be subject to suits?"
1980.79-1777,0,39465,r_ian_hunter,,303.042,304.31,Was there?
1980.79-1777,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,304.31,312.247,Was one of the reasons to make individual employees alleged to have violated collective bargaining agreements subject to suits?
1980.79-1777,0,39465,r_ian_hunter,,312.247,318.901,"No, I don't believe that there was any specific discussion covering that subject matter in the Taft-Hartley."
1980.79-1777,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,357.559,363.127,"Now, as I recall it, there was a lot of discussion in the legislative history of the Danbury Hatters case, wasn't there?"
1980.79-1777,0,39465,r_ian_hunter,,363.127,371.732,"There was, particularly in the Case bill and to some degree as it related to Section 301(b)."
1980.79-1777,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,415.275,419.26,"But that the union, as union, could not be held responsible?"
1980.79-1777,0,39465,r_ian_hunter,,419.26,423.781,"--No, the union could have been held responsible but in that time they couldn't have because it was under court abridged association; right."
1980.79-1777,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,423.781,424.614,That's right.
1980.79-1777,0,39465,r_ian_hunter,,424.614,429.935,And therefore they had to go to the employees to seek the assets to fulfill for damage remedies.
1980.79-1777,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,667.303,674.526,"Well, does petitioner, your client, concede... or does it?"
1980.79-1777,0,39465,r_ian_hunter,,677.978,679.095,Absolutely.
1980.79-1777,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,679.095,681.279,Governed by the federal labor law?
1980.79-1777,0,39465,r_ian_hunter,,681.279,682.864,Absolutely.
1980.79-1777,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,682.864,690.784,"And I suppose it is true that if the union had been liable in the case, the individuals would not have been?"
1980.79-1777,0,39465,r_ian_hunter,,690.784,691.651,Would not have; exactly.
1980.79-1777,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,691.651,697.036,"Now, is that... do you really mean that, or is it that you mean just that a judgment against the union can't be collected from the?"
1980.79-1777,0,39465,r_ian_hunter,,697.036,707.577,"No, I would mean that the facts of this case are such that given your Carbon Fuel decision, there would be no way that petitioners could seek to hold the labor organization involved here liable."
1980.79-1777,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,707.577,709.294,"No, I didn't, that isn't my question."
1980.79-1777,0,39465,r_ian_hunter,,719.652,720.285,Fine.
1980.79-1777,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,720.285,726.02,Could the employer also sue with the union the employees?
1980.79-1777,0,39465,r_ian_hunter,,726.02,736.911,I would suggest that 301(b) establishes a firmer foundation for precluding that remedy than it does in this case.
1980.79-1777,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,741.548,753.522,"But would you just say, would you say that the... you say that if the union were liable, the employees, the action against the employees should be dismissed for failure to state a cause of action?"
1980.79-1777,0,39465,r_ian_hunter,,753.522,753.972,Yes.
1980.79-1777,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,784.558,786.743,"Well, Mr. Hunter, what if you had an insolvent union?"
1980.79-1777,0,39465,r_ian_hunter,,790.212,805.489,"Again, I suppose you could and maybe that's the next step in this development of the law, but, seeing as the union's responsible for the fact that it's insolvent is merely a question of collection, not a question of principle, because the--"
1980.79-1777,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,805.489,808.674,But the individuals also have violated the contract under your theory?
1980.79-1777,0,39465,r_ian_hunter,,808.674,813.395,"--All under the auspices of their local union, their exclusive representative for that purpose."
1980.79-1777,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,821.151,823.217,"Well, don't you have a remedy in the state court?"
1980.79-1777,0,39465,r_ian_hunter,,823.217,825.052,That's my understanding; we do not.
1980.79-1777,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,825.052,825.685,Why not?
1980.79-1777,0,39465,r_ian_hunter,,825.685,828.803,The federal law is exclusive under 301.
1980.79-1777,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,828.803,845.413,"Well, if you say it, if the federal law covers it and there's no cause of action against the employees that's the answer, and if that's your relief, that would be true whether there was jurisdiction under 301 or not."
1980.79-1777,0,39465,r_ian_hunter,,845.413,855.288,"The state court maybe at that point, but then, say, in light of a determination that there is no cause of action against employees in the federal law, therefore we have jurisdiction and we could--"
1980.79-1777,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,855.288,862.625,"Well, the question would be, whether a federal law affirmatively says there is no cause of action against individual employees--"
1980.79-1777,0,39465,r_ian_hunter,,862.625,863.275,--Then I would--
1980.79-1777,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,863.275,870.63,--Or whether the holding is that federal law just is nonexistent in that area.
1980.79-1777,0,39465,r_ian_hunter,,870.63,875.868,"--Well, could there be a remedy available in the state court under either of those circumstances?"
1980.79-1777,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,875.868,877.018,"No, and the first one there, it clearly would not be."
1980.79-1777,0,39465,r_ian_hunter,,877.018,879.253,"Not be, and the other one there might be."
1980.79-1777,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,879.253,880.07,Yes.
1980.79-1777,0,39465,r_ian_hunter,,887.926,888.292,Exactly.
1980.79-1777,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,888.292,894.962,"But if federal law affirmatively says there cannot be a right of action against individual employees, then there can't be in the a state court either."
1980.79-1777,0,39465,r_ian_hunter,,894.962,895.596,That's right.
1980.79-1777,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,895.596,919.161,"But in our Boeing decision of some years ago, didn't we say that it wasn't up of the NLRB to decide whether the fines levied by a union on members who crossed a picket line were unreasonable or not, that that was an action that would have to be brought in a state court?"
1980.79-1777,0,39465,r_ian_hunter,,919.161,922.029,"It did, but I don't know how that points on to the issue."
1980.79-1777,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,937.123,943.027,But I don't think that's universally true of every conceivable dispute.
1980.79-1777,0,39465,r_ian_hunter,,943.027,950.28,"Oh, not every conceivable item, but certainly a violation of a no strike clause would be one of those I would assume would fall within that area."
1980.79-1777,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,950.28,951.597,You don't have to assume it.
1980.79-1777,0,39465,r_ian_hunter,,952.632,953.648,That's right.
1980.79-1777,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,953.648,972.543,"And if you suggest that if you brought a cause of action against the union and the employees together, claiming the union is responsible and that the employees are responsible too, you told me a minute ago that the employees should be dismissed from the suit if the union is liable."
1980.79-1777,0,39465,r_ian_hunter,,972.543,976.595,"They were, for example, in Atkinson v. Sinclair Refining on the plea that they were agents of the union."
1980.79-1777,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,976.595,979.547,And you wouldn't suggest then that you could turn around and sue them in state court?
1980.79-1777,0,39465,r_ian_hunter,,979.547,983.249,"No, I certainly would not at this point."
1980.79-1777,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1019.672,1039.652,"Well, could I ask you, is it clear under the lower court cases... I'm not sure that we have a case... that the employer, if the strike is still going on, a wildcat strike is still going on, may the employer enjoin the wildcatters themselves?"
1980.79-1777,0,39465,r_ian_hunter,,1039.652,1043.37,"As I understand it, there is no decision of this Court which has resolved that issue."
1980.79-1777,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1043.37,1044.387,How about the lower courts?
1980.79-1777,0,39465,r_ian_hunter,,1044.387,1049.508,I know that I have succeeded in enjoining wildcatters by a federal district court injunction but--
1980.79-1777,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1049.508,1050.541,Under 301?
1980.79-1777,0,39465,r_ian_hunter,,1050.541,1051.174,--And--
1980.79-1777,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1051.174,1057.494,Under 301 and saying that the contract is enforceable against the individuals?
1980.79-1777,0,39465,r_ian_hunter,,1057.494,1059.844,"--For example, the 6th Circuit in this case."
1980.79-1777,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1071.586,1073.353,It was moot.
1980.79-1777,0,39465,r_ian_hunter,,1073.353,1073.87,--it was moot.
1980.79-1777,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1073.87,1078.757,But did you get those injunctions in the context of collective bargaining agreements with arbitration clauses?
1980.79-1777,0,39465,r_ian_hunter,,1078.757,1079.424,Yes.
1980.79-1777,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1079.424,1080.69,Not otherwise?
1980.79-1777,0,39465,r_ian_hunter,,1080.69,1082.157,Not otherwise.
1980.79-1777,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1082.157,1083.092,And in a federal district court?
1980.79-1777,0,39465,r_ian_hunter,,1083.092,1084.659,In a federal district court; yes.
1980.79-1777,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1084.659,1085.328,Under 301?
1980.79-1777,0,39465,r_ian_hunter,,1085.328,1086.044,Under 301.
1980.79-1777,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1102.287,1103.539,Buffalo Forge's case?
1980.79-1777,0,39465,r_ian_hunter,,1103.539,1106.157,"--Well, it was in the sense it was not arbitrable."
1980.79-1777,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1106.157,1106.691,Yes.
1980.79-1777,0,39465,r_ian_hunter,,1106.691,1115.013,"Ultimately, during the duration of the strike, the issue changed and was enjoined because it became a dispute that was arbitrable."
1980.79-1777,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1115.013,1115.597,Yes.
1980.79-1777,0,39465,r_ian_hunter,,1116.113,1116.663,Only.
1980.79-1777,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1116.663,1120.065,Otherwise Section 4 of Norris-La Guardia would bar you just as much--
1980.79-1777,0,39465,r_ian_hunter,,1120.065,1120.465,That's right.
1980.79-1777,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1270.211,1275.281,--Could I just ask you a question that's running through my mind?
1980.79-1777,0,39465,r_ian_hunter,,1275.281,1275.898,Justice Stevens.
1980.79-1777,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1275.898,1279.4,There are two remedies available when the employee breaches a contract.
1980.79-1777,0,39465,r_ian_hunter,,1285.387,1291.791,They are available within the limits imposed by this Court and the lower courts comply with its decisions.
1980.79-1777,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1302.68,1306.568,"Well, perhaps sometimes the injunctive remedy is not available."
1980.79-1777,0,39465,r_ian_hunter,,1307.984,1309.6,Discharge; it should be always available.
1980.79-1777,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1309.6,1316.687,"Now, on the damage remedy that you asked the judiciary to invent, what is the measure of damages?"
1980.79-1777,0,39465,r_ian_hunter,,1316.687,1320.807,The measure of damages would be the proven damages as sustained by the employers as the result of work stoppage.
1980.79-1777,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1320.807,1321.974,Loss of profits to the company?
1980.79-1777,0,39465,r_ian_hunter,,1321.974,1326.545,"Loss of profits based upon the circumstances, whatever they could prove were damages."
1980.79-1777,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1326.545,1329.83,Is there a body of law that tells us that that would be the measure of damages?
1980.79-1777,0,39465,r_ian_hunter,,1329.83,1335.984,I suspect that the courts would have to revert to the contract... for a violation--
1980.79-1777,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1335.984,1337.934,"I'm going to ask a question, that's the next question down the road, I guess."
1980.79-1777,0,39465,r_ian_hunter,,1337.934,1348.975,"--That's really something that at this point... there's no specific difference between damages for a breach of a collective bargaining agreement and otherwise, to the best of my knowledge."
1980.79-1777,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1348.975,1351.007,"Well, there are not many suits by employers against employees generally, is there?"
1980.79-1777,0,39465,r_ian_hunter,,1351.007,1352.526,"No, there are not."
1980.79-1777,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1352.526,1353.742,I'm just wondering what your--
1980.79-1777,0,39465,r_ian_hunter,,1353.742,1355.294,But there are against local unions.
1980.79-1777,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1355.294,1355.811,--I understand.
1980.79-1777,0,39465,r_ian_hunter,,1355.811,1364.667,"And I believe they've measured those in loss of profits, whatever you can relate as to proven damages as a result of proven violations that occurred."
1980.79-1777,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1366.317,1375.539,"Sometimes, you know, there are different contract damage rules, whether it was in the contemplation of the parties, and loss of profits, a lot of different... I know you don't have a theory yet as what damage recovery would be?"
1980.79-1777,0,39465,r_ian_hunter,,1375.539,1376.073,I do not.
1980.79-1777,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1383.145,1388.014,"Getting into ancient history, the Danbury Hatters was a very big one, wasn't it?"
1980.79-1777,0,39465,r_ian_hunter,,1388.014,1388.449,In the damages?
1980.79-1777,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1394.186,1395.036,But it was a big one?
1980.79-1777,0,39465,r_ian_hunter,,1395.036,1409.362,"Most of whom, as I understand it, knew nothing about what was being boycotted, unlike here where we only would be able to sustain damages against those individuals who knowingly had violated the collective bargaining agreement."
1980.79-1777,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1518.997,1533.088,"What if you had sued in the federal district court under diversity of citizenship and alleged more than $10,000 in damages and said this was a breach of contract on the part of these particular individuals?"
1980.79-1777,0,39465,r_ian_hunter,,1534.257,1549.1,"I think we would have been confronted with the same argument I am now confronted with, that this is a violation of a collective bargaining agreement and it constitutes part of the Lincoln Mills substantive federal labor law, and I think they would have been somewhat justified... I think."
1980.79-1777,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1549.1,1553.502,Why couldn't they have applied that in the diversity case?
1980.79-1777,0,39465,r_ian_hunter,,1553.502,1559.305,"Well, diversity, I'd have trouble getting diversity in light of it's a Michigan corporation suing Michigan employees."
1980.79-1777,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1559.305,1561.34,But it would be the same question of federal law.
1980.79-1777,0,39465,r_ian_hunter,,1561.34,1562.707,I think so.
1980.79-1777,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1564.376,1583.521,"Well, except that, as suggested earlier, just because you don't have a lawsuit under Section 301 in a federal district court doesn't necessarily mean that you don't have an action for a breach of contract in a state court."
1980.79-1777,0,39465,r_ian_hunter,,1583.521,1583.988,It does not--
1980.79-1777,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1583.988,1597.046,"If the result of this case is there just isn't any federal law, that this isn't under 301, but it's not prohibited by federal law, then you do have, presumably, subject to the state law--"
1980.79-1777,0,39465,r_ian_hunter,,1597.046,1601.564,"--If this Court's decisions were like that very dogma, I think maybe an argument could be based on that--"
1980.79-1777,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1601.564,1603.864,"--Then it would be a matter of state law, whether or not you have one."
1980.79-1777,0,39465,r_ian_hunter,,1603.864,1610.752,"--It would be a matter of state law, and the absence of uniformity in an area very closely related to federal labor law might be--"
1980.79-1777,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1610.752,1612.119,Might be very undesirable.
1980.79-1777,0,39465,r_ian_hunter,,1612.119,1615.754,--undesirable.
1980.79-1777,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1646.139,1662.499,"If you have... if a producer has a contract with Ingrid Bergman and she walks off honoring a no strike clause, to discharge her is exactly what she wants."
1980.79-1777,0,39465,r_ian_hunter,,1667.386,1678.041,"I believe it was Senator Taft that even suggested that in some of his dialogue that after all, if an employee quits, he's quitting when he violates the no strike clause and he ought to assuming that's what he wanted."
1980.79-1777,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1679.46,1692.201,"May I ask, isn't there some legislative history to indicate that Congress intended that the sanction should be limited to discharge or other discipline than damages?"
1980.79-1777,0,39465,r_ian_hunter,,1692.201,1699.522,I respectfully suggest that that was in the Case bill dealing with Section 10(d) and 10(d) did not survive the Taft-Hartley.
1980.79-1777,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1699.522,1702.657,"And you think that's... it's limited to that, or something?"
1980.79-1777,0,39465,r_ian_hunter,,1702.657,1705.376,"I do, and that's where the dialogue took place."
1980.79-1777,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1705.376,1710.063,"Well, the legislative history reflects that discharge was a remedy--"
1980.79-1777,0,39465,r_ian_hunter,,1710.063,1711.48,A remedy suggested--
1980.79-1777,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1711.48,1713.865,--but it could not negate a private suit.
1980.79-1777,0,39465,r_ian_hunter,,1713.865,1719.335,--That is my opinion of the Congressional history about this.
1980.79-1777,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1719.335,1727.005,Mr. Grossman.
1980.79-1777,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1727.005,1732.326,"You might at some point, if you would, touch on that legislative history, but at your own time and convenience."
1980.79-1777,1,27046,hiram_s_grossman,,1732.326,1735.595,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1980.79-1777,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1782.426,1806.807,"Well, Mr. Grossman, what if a producer had a contract with Ingrid Bergman and she walked off the lot honoring a no strike clause, or a sympathy strike, or something like that, and do you say that there would be no action even in diversity in a federal court against her for damages?"
1980.79-1777,1,27046,hiram_s_grossman,,1806.807,1814.495,Are we somehow saying that Ingrid Bergman is also covered under this collective bargaining agreement?
1980.79-1777,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1814.495,1816.797,"Yes, that she's a member of the Screen Actors' Guild."
1980.79-1777,1,27046,hiram_s_grossman,,1816.797,1818.115,She's a member of the Screen Actors' Guild.
1980.79-1777,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1839.879,1847.451,"In other words, the Congress affirmatively prohibited damages by simply conferring jurisdiction on federal courts under 301?"
1980.79-1777,1,27046,hiram_s_grossman,,1847.451,1880.856,"Well, I think the purposes of the enactment of Section 301 are... when I say limited, are... It was to make unions responsible, allow a forum in which they could be sued to enforce collective bargaining agreements, it was to also assure the union... let me back up."
1980.79-1777,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1894.263,1897.382,Where do you find that in the language of 301?
1980.79-1777,1,27046,hiram_s_grossman,,1897.382,1897.801,--Okay.
1980.79-1777,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1898.284,1904.805,That a party whose agent negotiates an agreement for them is not subject to damages?
1980.79-1777,1,27046,hiram_s_grossman,,1904.805,1916.377,"--The language does not expressly state that, Your Honor, but what I am saying the purpose of the statute, the enactment of the statute, it was to accomplish certain limited ends."
1980.79-1777,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1924.467,1927.334,It didn't want to make employees irresponsible.
1980.79-1777,1,27046,hiram_s_grossman,,1927.334,1929.953,"No, it didn't want to make employees irresponsible."
1980.79-1777,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1945.93,1952.802,But why aren't they subject to damages the way any other person signing an employment contract is?
1980.79-1777,1,27046,hiram_s_grossman,,1952.802,1973.715,"Under Section 301, I am maintaining, they would not be, because Congress in enacting the legislation created these rights that can be used to enforce the terms of the contract to a specific group."
1980.79-1777,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2025.834,2039.158,"Does an employee have a right to sue in a federal district court, not under 301, but under diversity jurisdiction, an employer for breach of his contract and and allege damages?"
1980.79-1777,1,27046,hiram_s_grossman,,2039.158,2042.36,I'm unaware of any actions that have happened.
1980.79-1777,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2048.513,2065.906,Justice Rehnquist's question takes me back to the one I put to your friend at the outset: are you saying that you have the same kind of claim as though you have individual contracts with these employees with no union involved at all?
1980.79-1777,1,27046,hiram_s_grossman,,2093.042,2096.927,"Well, if there would, it wouldn't be under 301."
1980.79-1777,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2096.927,2100.829,"No, no, but, there's no question about if there would be, would there not?"
1980.79-1777,1,27046,hiram_s_grossman,,2101.498,2104.95,"There conceivably could be, if their rights were violated."
1980.79-1777,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2118.541,2137.618,"Then the question arises, whether 301 precludes... now, you, you, I take it, concede that there being no union contract, there being no 301 problem, the producer could have an action for breach of contract against the actor or actress."
1980.79-1777,1,27046,hiram_s_grossman,,2137.618,2142.739,"--Okay, I can't see any reason why they could not."
1980.79-1777,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2142.739,2151.428,There's no equitable remedy available because they can't compel the painting of a picture or the performance of a work of art.
1980.79-1777,1,27046,hiram_s_grossman,,2173.541,2174.71,Okay.
1980.79-1777,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2180.029,2183.897,"Well, the question here is, isn't it... or am I mistaken?"
1980.79-1777,1,27046,hiram_s_grossman,,2190.085,2198.924,"--But that is... okay, that is a matter that, how this matter originally arose, and it arose in 1976."
1980.79-1777,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2200.074,2201.793,"Well, is that the question or not?"
1980.79-1777,1,27046,hiram_s_grossman,,2201.793,2205.411,--It is that whether it's under Section 301--
1980.79-1777,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2205.411,2214.551,Whether or not Section 301 confers the jurisdiction of a federal district court over an action such as this?
1980.79-1777,1,27046,hiram_s_grossman,,2214.551,2215.702,--Over a damage action against individual employees.
1980.79-1777,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2215.702,2236.466,"Mr. Grossman, if you look at the statute, what the statute says is, jurisdiction is conferred on district courts of suits for violation of contracts concluded as the result of collective bargaining between an employer and a labor organization representing employees in an industry affecting commerce."
1980.79-1777,1,27046,hiram_s_grossman,,2243.37,2250.876,It's a suit that is maintainable under 301--
1980.79-1777,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2250.876,2255.611,"That's what I say, is it... it's a question of construction of that language, isn't it?"
1980.79-1777,1,27046,hiram_s_grossman,,2255.611,2276.524,"--In construing Section 301(a), the type of suit, to seek the remedy of damage, I would say that Section 301(a) does not intend that type of--"
1980.79-1777,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2276.524,2282.276,Cannot be construed to authorize a suit of this kind or confer jurisdiction over--
1980.79-1777,1,27046,hiram_s_grossman,,2282.276,2287.413,"--No, it would not confer jurisdiction on a federal district court to entertain a suit of this type."
1980.79-1777,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2287.413,2290.881,"--Now, that's what you have to persuade us, isn't it?"
1980.79-1777,1,27046,hiram_s_grossman,,2305.725,2307.291,True.
1980.79-1777,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2307.291,2310.609,So we don't have to reach the question whether it's 01 prohibits the suit.
1980.79-1777,1,27046,hiram_s_grossman,,2312.811,2313.544,That's right.
1980.79-1777,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2316.53,2317.432,That's the end of this case.
1980.79-1777,1,27046,hiram_s_grossman,,2317.432,2317.998,--That's the end--
1980.79-1777,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2317.998,2324.702,"And whether they could sue in a state court or sue Ingrid Bergman would be in another lawsuit, not this one."
1980.79-1777,1,27046,hiram_s_grossman,,2331.206,2338.696,"--Well, the employer has the option of disciplining or discharging the employees."
1980.79-1777,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2338.696,2348.901,"Let me ask you, if 90 percent of the employees go out on an illegal strike, is firing them an adequate remedy?"
1980.79-1777,1,27046,hiram_s_grossman,,2348.901,2350.984,If the employer so--
1980.79-1777,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2350.984,2353.286,"Because he couldn't run on ten, with that, can he?"
1980.79-1777,1,27046,hiram_s_grossman,,2353.286,2353.936,--I'm sorry.
1980.79-1777,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2353.936,2360.959,"I said, if 90 percent are out, is his only remedy to fire 90 percent of his labor force?"
1980.79-1777,1,27046,hiram_s_grossman,,2360.959,2368.279,"No, he can do what this employer did, is go into federal district court and seek an injunction which it obtained."
1980.79-1777,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2368.279,2372.599,How... why can he do that under 301?
1980.79-1777,1,27046,hiram_s_grossman,,2375.132,2393.263,Because in this particular action the employer in his filing of the lawsuit filed it against both the union and the employees and we did not raise the particular question at the time.
1980.79-1777,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2393.263,2399.084,"It would seem to me if he can, and if you concede that he can, then you're conceding away your lawsuit."
1980.79-1777,1,27046,hiram_s_grossman,,2399.084,2400.217,"Okay, I--"
1980.79-1777,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2400.217,2403.536,"Well, you're conceding away the jurisdictional point that the federal courts set--"
1980.79-1777,1,27046,hiram_s_grossman,,2408.023,2410.673,"--No, I'm not conceding the cause of action, Your Honor."
1980.79-1777,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2410.673,2413.257,Otherwise you would be out of our--
1980.79-1777,1,27046,hiram_s_grossman,,2421.68,2441.827,"With Boys Market this Court concluded that if the matter is subject to the parties' collective bargaining agreement, and the walkout involves a dispute that is covered by the collective bargaining agreement, then an injunction can be obtained."
1980.79-1777,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2451.617,2455.001,Did the injunction in Boys Market run against the employees as well as the union?
1980.79-1777,1,27046,hiram_s_grossman,,2455.903,2456.27,--Yes.
1980.79-1777,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2456.27,2456.836,Against both?
1980.79-1777,1,27046,hiram_s_grossman,,2456.836,2460.155,"It ran against the employees, it ran against the local, it ran against the international."
1980.79-1777,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2463.79,2469.594,So to that extent we have recognized that there is a 301 action against the employees.
1980.79-1777,1,27046,hiram_s_grossman,,2469.594,2486.89,"See, the 301 action would refer to the ability under 301 to obtain a damage... the remedy of damages against employees participating in an unauthorized work stoppage, it seems to me."
1980.79-1777,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2545.328,2566.442,"Well, Mr. Grossman, is your basic argument that there is no 301 jurisdiction in federal courts for this kind of an action, or that this kind of an action simply cannot be brought because Congress has prohibited imposing liability on individual members?"
1980.79-1777,1,27046,hiram_s_grossman,,2566.442,2606.135,"Okay, I would say that the language of the statute doesn't permit it, the legislative history doesn't say that Congress intended to allow it, and what petitioners are attempting to have this Court do is by the inventive... because this is an area that's in the penumbra, is to use the judicial inventiveness to allow them to sue and obtain a money damage action, remedy, against employees where the language doesn't say they can."
1980.79-1777,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2606.135,2618.209,"Well, but... so your argument is basically, no 301 jurisdiction, not that if there were diversity jurisdiction in a federal court?"
1980.79-1777,1,27046,hiram_s_grossman,,2625.396,2635.654,"Yes, I would say, even if there were diversity, if it was under a collective bargaining contract, that there would be a prohibition."
1980.79-1777,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2635.654,2638.44,"How do you explain Smith v. Evening News, then?"
1980.79-1777,1,27046,hiram_s_grossman,,2638.44,2640.19,Smith v. Evening News?
1980.79-1777,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2699.261,2710.483,"Well, wouldn't you... in the Smith and Lucas, those kinds of suits in a state court, under 301, they are governed by federal law."
1980.79-1777,1,27046,hiram_s_grossman,,2710.483,2712.235,"--Yes, they are, Your Honor."
1980.79-1777,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2712.235,2719.924,"And I don't suppose you could get a remedy in a state court that, for example, against a union that Carbon Fuel said you couldn't get?"
1980.79-1777,1,27046,hiram_s_grossman,,2719.924,2725.828,"No, it would be inconsistent, it would not... it would be inconsistent with the federal decisions that--"
1980.79-1777,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2725.828,2726.244,Yes.
1980.79-1777,1,27046,hiram_s_grossman,,2740.119,2741.704,"--Yes, sir, that is true."
1980.79-1777,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2741.704,2745.573,"Whether under 301, or whether in state court, or whether in federal court, or?"
1980.79-1777,1,27046,hiram_s_grossman,,2745.573,2756.297,"Yes, I would say if you're going to be going under, if the theory of the lawsuit involves collective bargaining and a breach of the collective bargaining agreement."
1980.79-1777,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2756.297,2765.736,"Then that's as true of Ingrid Bergman who may have damaged the employer by $2 million or $3 million, as by someone who quits voluntarily and can easily be replaced?"
1980.79-1777,1,27046,hiram_s_grossman,,2765.736,2769.021,"Well, I don't know... okay, if she's covered under this contract."
1980.79-1777,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2769.021,2771.554,"Well, this is a hypothetical."
1980.79-1777,1,27046,hiram_s_grossman,,2775.258,2778.044,"Right, my answer would be the same again."
1980.79-1777,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2857.246,2870.753,"As I recall the Taft-Hartley provision, one of them was to say that no worker should be penalized for engaging or for not engaging in collective activity."
1980.79-1777,1,27046,hiram_s_grossman,,2891.067,2915.032,"If the single worker was covered under the collective bargaining agreement, I don't... okay, what I'm... I guess, if you could imagine a situation where there were 100 employees and only one walked out, yet caused the employer damages, and what I would maintain is, that employee could only be discharged."
1980.79-1777,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2926.238,2937.545,Do you concede or do you not that this lawsuit comes within the literal language of 301(a)?
1980.79-1777,1,27046,hiram_s_grossman,,2937.545,2939.228,"It was brought under 301(a), yes."
1980.79-1777,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2939.228,2941.763,"Well, do you... perhaps you didn't understand my question."
1980.79-1777,1,27046,hiram_s_grossman,,2945.815,2950.203,"Okay, it involves--"
1980.79-1777,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2950.203,2956.107,This was a contract between an employer and the laborers' organization--
1980.79-1777,1,27046,hiram_s_grossman,,2956.107,2956.607,--Right.
1980.79-1777,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2956.607,2960.325,"--Representing employees in an industry affecting commerce, wasn't it?"
1980.79-1777,1,27046,hiram_s_grossman,,2960.325,2961.325,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1980.79-1777,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2961.325,2965.313,And this is a suit for violation of that contract.
1980.79-1777,1,27046,hiram_s_grossman,,2965.313,2966.429,That is true.
1980.79-1777,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2966.429,2972.649,"And therefore, do you concede that it comes within the literal language of 301(a)?"
1980.79-1777,1,27046,hiram_s_grossman,,2979.722,2987.892,"Well, I think that it can be brought against... okay, it has been brought against both."
1980.79-1777,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3024.851,3028.386,How did the international and the local drop out of the case?
1980.79-1777,1,27046,hiram_s_grossman,,3028.386,3036.056,The petitioners elected not to pursue the cause of action against them.
1980.79-1777,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3037.492,3039.108,Proceed only against the employees?
1980.79-1777,1,27046,hiram_s_grossman,,3039.108,3051.815,"--Once the work stoppage ended, everybody went back to work and the petitioners pursued the damage remedy against the employees."
1980.79-1777,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3063.39,3071.563,"Well, was there ever any decision or any claim that the union couldn't have been liable even if the employees were?"
1980.79-1777,1,27046,hiram_s_grossman,,3071.563,3073.598,"I'm sorry, I didn't hear you."
1980.79-1777,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3073.598,3080.502,Was there ever a decision by a court that the union couldn't have been liable in all cases?
1980.79-1777,1,27046,hiram_s_grossman,,3080.502,3085.973,"No, it was, the only decision that the court made was to order everybody back to work."
1980.79-1777,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3085.973,3095.261,"Because certainly Atkinson v. Sinclair said you can't avoid 301(b) by just suing the employees, if the union is liable."
1980.79-1777,1,27046,hiram_s_grossman,,3095.261,3096.028,"No, that's correct."
1980.79-1777,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3110.521,3122.931,"Well, why don't you... why isn't, why aren't you arguing... maybe you are... that you really can't tell, at least you can't hold the employees liable, until it's been legally determined that the union is not liable?"
1980.79-1777,1,27046,hiram_s_grossman,,3122.931,3123.881,--Well--
1980.79-1777,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3123.881,3129.001,"Because if it is, Atkinson v. Sinclair says 301(b) bars it."
1980.79-1777,1,27046,hiram_s_grossman,,3129.001,3129.552,--Okay.
1980.79-1777,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3139.873,3144.844,"Well, they can't elect... Atkinson says you just can't elect to sue employees."
1980.79-1777,1,27046,hiram_s_grossman,,3144.844,3151.698,"--No, what I'm saying to you is that had petitioner elected to continue keeping all the parties in the lawsuit--"
1980.79-1777,2,39465,r_ian_hunter,,3608.694,3613.565,"Mr. Chief Justice, I believe I have a minute, and I want to address, very quickly, two issues."
1980.79-1777,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3628.741,3634.061,"Well, is that... do you think that's tantamount to admitting the union was not liable?"
1980.79-1777,2,39465,r_ian_hunter,,3634.061,3636.747,"It certainly is, it admitted that they did not condone it."
1980.79-1777,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3655.125,3662.445,I think the... I see a recitation in the Court of Appeals opinion that the district court actually found that the union had not authorized the strike.
1980.79-1777,2,39465,r_ian_hunter,,3662.445,3663.112,--That's right.
1980.79-1777,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3678.221,3678.906,"Thank you, gentlemen."
