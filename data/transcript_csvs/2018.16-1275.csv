2018.16-1275,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.075,7.0,"We'll hear argument next in Case 16-1275, Virginia Uranium versus Warren. Mr. Cooper."
2018.16-1275,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,7.0,42.025,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In the PG&E case, this Court held that, although the State of California had the undisputed regulatory power to place a moratorium on the construction of new nuclear plants, it was preempted under the Atomic Energy Act from using that undisputed de jure authority as a means for indirectly and de facto regulating the nuclear safety of nuclear plants."
2018.16-1275,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,42.025,57.105,"Mr. Cooper, there's something odd with using PG&E for your side, because the bottom line in that case was no preemption."
2018.16-1275,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,57.105,59.075,"That's true, Your Honor."
2018.16-1275,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,59.075,70.38,"So to say, well, they had -- they said all this stuff along the way, but the bottom line judgment in -- and that was true in English as well -- no preemption?"
2018.16-1275,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,70.38,128.35,"Your Honor, and -- and the reason that the Court in PG&A came -- PG&E came to that conclusion was it accepted the court of appeals' interpretation of state law that the purpose -- the purpose of that regulatory -- that -- that -- the court's or the -- California's exercise of regulatory authority was not for the purpose of protecting against radiation hazards, which is the -- which is the line drawn in the statute between what is federal and what is state. So PG&E, Your Honor, as I say, in -- clearly held that the state could not indirectly -- use its acknowledged authority to indirectly and de facto regulate a activity that was in the exclusive authority of the NRC."
2018.16-1275,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,128.35,128.84,What -- what if it's --
2018.16-1275,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,128.84,130.01,And in this case --
2018.16-1275,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,130.01,132.01000005,What if it's dual purpose?
2018.16-1275,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,132.01000005,134.15,"Well, Your Honor --"
2018.16-1275,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,134.15,136.66,Which a lot of things are going to be in this context.
2018.16-1275,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,136.66,137.905,"That's true, Your Honor, and --"
2018.16-1275,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,137.905,139.805,So how -- how does that work?
2018.16-1275,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,139.805,160.07,"Justice Kavanaugh, in a case where it's a dual purpose, this Court in PG&E said, is it grounded in the impermissible purpose? Is it grounded in -- the courts of appeals have had no problem examining situations where -- and that's going to be true in most --"
2018.16-1275,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,160.07,160.64,"Well, but, Mr. Cooper --"
2018.16-1275,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,160.64,161.28,-- legislation.
2018.16-1275,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,161.28,174.17,"-- Mr. Cooper, then -- then we -- don't we get into trouble under Shady Grove of guessing what the motivations of a state legislature are and all the methodological, epistemological, and federalism questions that that raises? What do we do about that?"
2018.16-1275,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,174.17,182.66,"Your Honor, this Court in a variety of contexts is called upon to examine the legislative purpose of a particular enactment --"
2018.16-1275,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,182.66,186.345,"I know we do it in the Fourteenth -- Fourteenth Amendment context, for example, but I'm --"
2018.16-1275,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,186.345,186.45,Yes.
2018.16-1275,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,186.45,198.71,-- I'm hard pressed to come up with many other examples where we -- where we look at a state legislative purpose and -- and -- and decide its permissibility based on our assessment of -- of legislative motive.
2018.16-1275,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,198.71,230.035,"Well, Your Honor, and we have not been able to find another statute where Congress has prescribed a purpose-based preemption standard. But Congress has nonetheless, in terms that are quite clear and in terms that this Court in PG&E accepted and implemented, made purpose the line between what is state -- what is state and what is federal with respect to the regulation of nuclear power development."
2018.16-1275,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,230.035,233.3,So we're just stuck with purpose whether we like it or not.
2018.16-1275,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,234.73,237.15,"That's -- that's the bottom line, yes, Your Honor."
2018.16-1275,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,237.15,266.735,"But is PG&E perhaps distinguishable on this basis: That at least there California was directly regulating the construction of nuclear power plants, prohibiting them, and that is an area under, what is it, 2021(c) that's expressly preempted. Here, you have efforts to regulate mining, an upstream activity, that are not expressly dealt with in the statute."
2018.16-1275,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,268.46,281.93,"Your Honor, I don't think that distinguishes PG&E at all because, in PG&E, the state was using its acknowledged power to decide whether nuclear power plants would be constructed."
2018.16-1275,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,281.93,282.5,"Well, but that -- that --"
2018.16-1275,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,282.5,283.67,That's a (c) activity.
2018.16-1275,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,283.67,293.61,"I'm sorry to interrupt, but I just want to narrow the question so that we might be more productive, for -- for me, helpfully for me. There, California was regulating construction."
2018.16-1275,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,301.755,302.57,Yes.
2018.16-1275,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,302.57,304.07,"You got me there, okay? (Laughter.)"
2018.16-1275,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,304.07,304.68,Yes.
2018.16-1275,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,304.68,337.02,"But I think Justice White was saying, well, within the construction world, all right, we have this carveout under (k) that we have to deal with, and California might regulate construction for purposes other than safety considerations, for economic or other considerations. What do we do about it when -- when a state comes along and says, I'm not even going to regulate construction, I'm not even going to get into that game, I'm not in the (c) game at all? Why would we look at (k)? Why would we look at anything? Why wouldn't we just say this is just not an area that Congress regulated? Congress just couldn't come to agreement on how to regulate mining?"
2018.16-1275,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,337.02,344.73,"Well, to come back to PG&E, what the -- what California regulated was not construction."
2018.16-1275,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,386.7,417.56,"Suppose -- suppose Virginia had said we think that the extraction is a dangerous activity, so we are justifying this ban on mining to protect the workers from the hazards associated with mining, not with milling or tailing, just mining. Then I take it you would lose, right?"
2018.16-1275,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,417.56,419.585,"I would lose, Your Honor, yes."
2018.16-1275,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,487.28,495.485,"I might just be repeating Justice Gorsuch's question, but you've conceded, if they talk about mining hazards, that that's -- you lose."
2018.16-1275,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,524.78,548.65,"Your Honor, the -- the courts can't accept simply as written what the state may say in terms of what the purpose is. That's -- that's exactly what happened in the Entergy case from the Second Circuit. The -- the legislature in Vermont was acutely aware of PG&E and acutely aware of trying to avoid preemption."
2018.16-1275,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,579.57,586.06000005,Is this going to require deposing every single legislative member?
2018.16-1275,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,586.06000005,587.49,"No, Your Honor."
2018.16-1275,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,587.49,593.61,"Because what do you look at? In a lot of these things, people just vote."
2018.16-1275,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,606.17,620.325,"Your Honor, I know of no case, that I'm aware of anyway, when this Court and the federal courts go about the what is ordinary business of trying to determine legislative purpose, where legislators have been deposed."
2018.16-1275,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,644.88,655.535,"But you would concede, Mr. Cooper, that two states with exactly the same statutes, it could come out different ways because the legislative history was different in the two states?"
2018.16-1275,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,655.535,678.27,"It -- it -- it could, Your Honor, if -- if the purpose animating the legislature through the best good-faith examination of the court's looking at that issue came to the conclusion that, yes, this genuine and non-prohibited purpose was the but-for purpose, if you will, of the legislation. Yes, that -- that is --"
2018.16-1275,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,678.27,683.435,"It seems to present real opportunities for gamesmanship as well, sort of bad incentives for a state."
2018.16-1275,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,685.595,694.025,"Your Honor, and we've seen that -- we've seen that in -- in cases that have been decided in -- in this line."
2018.16-1275,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,765.32,782.23,"But how are we going to tell that in most cases? Justice Kagan's question about two state laws are going to be treated differently based on our inquiry or the federal court's inquiry into the subjective motive seems very odd. The thing that concerns me about this is, how is this going to work?"
2018.16-1275,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,782.23,783.13,Your Honor --
2018.16-1275,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,783.13,788.85,"And -- and one way would be, as Justice Sotomayor said, subjective motivations depositions."
2018.16-1275,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,801.67,802.585,That's -- that's --
2018.16-1275,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,802.585,804.81,"But that's too low, I think you're going to say."
2018.16-1275,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,804.81,806.38,"You're right, I am going to say that, Your Honor."
2018.16-1275,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,806.38,812.56,"But then what do -- what -- what is the answer, for something workable that makes sense here? That's what -- that's what's bothering me."
2018.16-1275,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,812.56,877.75,"Your Honor, I think if -- if you're -- if you're groping, if you were, for a framework for courts to analyze this, it seems to me the Court in Arlington Heights produced a perfectly apt way for courts to approach this. If the -- the person, the plaintiff challenging the preemption of the statute can demonstrate that the prohibited purpose was a motivating factor, then the state has to come in and show that it would have been enacted even in the absence of the motivating factor. And, again, the -- the -- the Congress drew the line here because it wanted to ensure -- and this was -- purpose is actually in this a narrowing preemption because, typically, if -- if the state enacts a measure, regardless of what its purpose is, that is an indirect regulation of that which is exclusively federal."
2018.16-1275,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,934.81,948.995,"Thank you, counsel. General Francisco."
2018.16-1275,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,948.995,959.395,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Under the Atomic Energy Act, Virginia can ban uranium mining because it thinks that mining isn't safe."
2018.16-1275,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,960.62,961.655,Because it thinks mining is what?
2018.16-1275,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,961.655,963.78,Because mining isn't safe.
2018.16-1275,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,969.74,976.67,"Can you, the federal government, order the state to permit and regulate mining?"
2018.16-1275,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,976.67,978.42,"No, Your Honor, I don't think so."
2018.16-1275,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,978.42,990.775,"So, if you can't do that, then how can you force them or judge any reason they give for saying I don't want to do it?"
2018.16-1275,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,990.775,993.98,"Well, Your Honor, this is simply a straightforward preemption analysis."
2018.16-1275,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,994.85,998.03,But you just told me you can't order them to mine.
2018.16-1275,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,998.03,998.54,Right.
2018.16-1275,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,999.1,1001.02,Or to apply safety reasons.
2018.16-1275,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1014.395,1020.085,"Not in the slightest, Your Honor, because, if Virginia's mining ban were preempted, Virginia wouldn't have to do anything."
2018.16-1275,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1038.76,1038.82,May --
2018.16-1275,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1038.82,1039.79,-- to the federal government.
2018.16-1275,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1039.79,1041.625,-- may -- may I go back to Justice Gorsuch's question --
2018.16-1275,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1041.625,1042.12,"Yes, Your Honor."
2018.16-1275,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1042.12,1092.46,"-- about PG&E and whether it's the same as or different from this case? And it seems -- this might be just a different way of saying what he said, but it does seem to me that when you're talking about construction of a nuclear plant, there's obvious dual authority between the federal government and the states. 2018 gives a lot of authority to the states, and then 2021(c) clearly makes this a part of what the Commission looks at. And, you know, Mr. Cooper said there's the whether question and the how question. But, honestly, if you think about the thing, there -- there's dual authority in one area, and it seems to me that that's not true here, where the Act specifically says that the Commission's authority starts when the --"
2018.16-1275,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1092.46,1092.55,Sure.
2018.16-1275,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1092.55,1096.78,-- materials are extracted from the earth and has nothing to do --
2018.16-1275,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1096.78,1097.11,Right.
2018.16-1275,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1097.11,1099.025,-- with what happens prior to that.
2018.16-1275,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1107.34,1110.265,So my -- my answer to your question is no.
2018.16-1275,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1129.98,1136.275,"General, I -- I -- I understand that's a nice Tenth Circuit case, so well done. (Laughter.)"
2018.16-1275,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1136.275,1138.24,But it doesn't bind this Court.
2018.16-1275,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1147.21,1154.525,But I -- I want to know from first principles why PG&E isn't simply explained as a construction case.
2018.16-1275,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1154.525,1154.89,Sure.
2018.16-1275,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1154.89,1159.14,"And construction, I don't see whether and how in the statute in (c)."
2018.16-1275,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1161.69,1162.14,Right.
2018.16-1275,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1162.14,1165.79,And California was regulating construction in some fashion.
2018.16-1275,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1165.79,1166.225,Right.
2018.16-1275,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1166.45,1167.58,"Here -- here, it's mining."
2018.16-1275,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1173.41,1173.59,Yeah.
2018.16-1275,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1173.59,1175.805,So why isn't that the end of the case?
2018.16-1275,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1175.805,1194.37,"Because I think the answer to your question is that neither PG&E nor anything that we're arguing here is really a nuclear-specific rule. Take the National Meat Association case, for example, a decision of this Court. The federal government had exclusive regulatory authority over slaughterhouse operations."
2018.16-1275,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1252.37,1252.75,But a problem --
2018.16-1275,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1252.75,1290.835,"Well, purpose is usually a subjective concept, but -- and that's what Congress -- that's the term Congress chose to use in 2021(k), but is there a way of understanding that as applying an objective standard that doesn't boil down to rational basis review? So the inquiry wouldn't be what was in the minds of these particular legislators, but would a reasonable legislator -- is -- do -- enact this particular prohibition if its objective was not disagreement with the federal regulations?"
2018.16-1275,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1290.835,1292.42,"Yes, Your Honor, I think there is."
2018.16-1275,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1335.79,1344.81,"But, General, even under your standard, we have a problem of mixed motives, because every piece of legislation has a variety of motives behind it."
2018.16-1275,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1355.01,1355.1,Right.
2018.16-1275,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1355.1,1364.55,"-- environmental and economic impacts from mining itself, as well as with other things. So what do we do with those cases where, at the end of the day, it's indeterminate?"
2018.16-1275,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1364.55,1366.56,"So two responses, Your Honor."
2018.16-1275,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1400.255,1403.735,"Any plausible non-safety rationale, that's your test?"
2018.16-1275,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1403.735,1413.37,"I think, if it's not foreclosed by the text, legislative history, and historical context and they can establish a plausible rationale at the time that this was adopted, then, yes, I think that --"
2018.16-1275,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1413.37,1421.27,"So that answers Justice Gorsuch's question because, if there's at least one plausible non-safety rationale, that's good enough or --"
2018.16-1275,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1421.27,1426.195,I think that plausible non-safety rationale has to be sufficient to sustain the law.
2018.16-1275,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1426.195,1426.64,What does that --
2018.16-1275,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1426.64,1426.77,"So, for --"
2018.16-1275,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1426.77,1427.475,-- what does that mean?
2018.16-1275,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1427.475,1438.14,"So, for example, suppose that Virginia put forward a rationale of we don't like big, huge, ugly holes dug into the Virginia countryside, which is a very plausible rationale."
2018.16-1275,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1447.11,1450.32,I thought they just said we don't want -- we've got too many but don't want any more.
2018.16-1275,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1450.32,1450.805,Yeah.
2018.16-1275,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1450.805,1466.95,"Well, Your Honor -- and I think that that's exactly the type of analysis that the statute itself requires when it required that type of purpose inquiry, because I do think otherwise -- otherwise, you really are giving state and local governments a road map for undermining a multibillion-dollar industry."
2018.16-1275,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1468.07,1518.69,"Well, General, you -- you've been talking about the undermining of this industry, but I guess a couple of things is, one is that as long as there is this other purpose or as long as the state can say that there's this other purpose, it will just as successfully be able to undermine the industry. And then on the -- on the -- as well, this statute does give the federal government the ability to make sure that states can't really undermine it if the federal government wants a nuclear industry badly enough, because, in addition to the fact that somebody can import this material from another state or from another country, the federal government itself can mine for this material on its own lands, or it can condemn lands and -- and do it with newly acquired lands."
2018.16-1275,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1518.69,1518.86,Sure.
2018.16-1275,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1518.86,1526.11,So there's a limit to how far any state is able to undermine the federal goal here if the federal goal is real enough.
2018.16-1275,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1526.11,1559.235,"I agree, Your Honor, but two responses to the first part of your question, and then I'd like to address the second part of your question as well. On the first part of your question, we assume that the states engage in good faith, and we assume that the states aren't going to misstate their reasons for doing something. But I will tell you that it is a lot more difficult for a state to, for example, rezone all land that nuclear activity is taking place on as residential, even if it's totally unsuitable for residential dwelling, if they know they're going to have to come forward and justify that. And may I finish the second point, Your Honor?"
2018.16-1275,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1559.235,1559.95,Briefly.
2018.16-1275,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1559.95,1560.28,Yes.
2018.16-1275,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1587.3,1593.775,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Heytens."
2018.16-1275,2,42810,toby_j_heytens,,1593.775,1602.405,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This is an obstacle preemption case masquerading as a field preemption case."
2018.16-1275,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1631.06,1633.23,"They -- they can regulate milling, correct?"
2018.16-1275,2,42810,toby_j_heytens,,1633.23,1636.67,"Excuse me, I want to make -- the federal government regulates milling --"
2018.16-1275,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1636.67,1636.76,Right.
2018.16-1275,2,42810,toby_j_heytens,,1636.76,1637.45,"-- Justice Kavanaugh, yes."
2018.16-1275,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1637.45,1637.51,Yeah.
2018.16-1275,2,42810,toby_j_heytens,,1646.055,1650.8,"Justice Kavanaugh, there's a way -- the in situ leaching process, they literally occur at the same time."
2018.16-1275,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1650.8,1652.22,If you have conventional mining.
2018.16-1275,2,42810,toby_j_heytens,,1652.22,1654.24,"I'm sorry, yes, you have to mill before you can mine."
2018.16-1275,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1654.86,1655.3,Right.
2018.16-1275,2,42810,toby_j_heytens,,1655.3,1691.01,"But -- but I think in many ways what this case boils down to is two questions about Pacific Gas, either one of which is sufficient to resolve this case in our favor. The first question is why the Court conducted a purpose analysis in Pacific Gas, and the second question is what is the nature of the purpose analysis that Pacific Gas did. So let me take the first question: why did the Court do it. The reason the Court did it is because, as several members of this Court have already flagged, Pacific Gas was dealing with an area of overlapping shared authority between the federal and state government."
2018.16-1275,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1714.66,1739.295,"Before you get too deeply into that decision, which you have addressed very extensively and well in your brief, could I just ask you this: Suppose the Virginia General Assembly enacted a law that reads as follows: The General Assembly disagrees with the federal government that uranium tailings can be safely stored in Virginia and, for that reason and only that reason, we are banning the practice of uranium mining. Would that be preempted?"
2018.16-1275,2,42810,toby_j_heytens,,1739.295,1743.68,"Justice Alito, we do not think even that mythical statute would be preempted."
2018.16-1275,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1748.57,1751.41,"Yeah, how would that be -- I mean, doesn't that make nonsense of 2120 -- 2021(k)?"
2018.16-1275,2,42810,toby_j_heytens,,1751.41,1767.61,"Justice Alito, I don't think it does and here's why: I think the predicate for 2021(k) is the existence of an NRC-regulated activity. 2021(k) has to be read in pari materia with 2021(b)."
2018.16-1275,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1790.44,1798.095,"So why -- why can't the -- you know, the imagination allows you to think of all kinds of things where they stop the tailing."
2018.16-1275,2,42810,toby_j_heytens,,1820.375,1824.5,"Well -- well, Justice Breyer, I think there are two different reasons why that's distinct from this situation."
2018.16-1275,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1824.66,1838.41,"I know the eating is distinct, but what I'm driving at is the general matter of -- of I were in a state legislature, and you could think of a thousand ways, my guess, is we stop tailings in our state how."
2018.16-1275,2,42810,toby_j_heytens,,1846.8,1847.45,Yes.
2018.16-1275,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1847.45,1850.095,Now I don't think that's a far-fetched question.
2018.16-1275,2,42810,toby_j_heytens,,1850.095,1851.12,I -- I think the --
2018.16-1275,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1851.12,1852.37,And that's what they say happened here.
2018.16-1275,2,42810,toby_j_heytens,,1852.37,1856.755,"Yes, and I think the answer to your question, Justice Breyer, goes back to a point that Justice Gorsuch made earlier."
2018.16-1275,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1863.79,1865.745,But that's not my question.
2018.16-1275,2,42810,toby_j_heytens,,1869.58,1870.4,"Yes, Justice Breyer."
2018.16-1275,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1870.4,1882.565,"A good lawyer, like you, and he finds a different area, and it just turns out that the regulation in this different area will stop them from ever having tailings. And that's why they did it."
2018.16-1275,2,42810,toby_j_heytens,,1884.63,1893.145,"Just -- let me try this again, Justice Breyer. When we're talking about a tailings facility, we're in an area of overlapping authority because NRC regulates tailings management."
2018.16-1275,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1905.52,1917.74,"But, when you're regulating mining, you're always regulating milling because you have the two together, but you can't regulate milling, as you acknowledge, but the two are interlinked in a way that I'm not sure you can disaggregate in the way you're doing."
2018.16-1275,2,42810,toby_j_heytens,,1917.74,1923.16,"Justice Kavanaugh, I understand that conceptually we -- we could have a metaphysical debate about whether you can separate mining and milling and whether --"
2018.16-1275,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1923.16,1925.4,"It's -- in the real world, it's not separated."
2018.16-1275,2,42810,toby_j_heytens,,1925.4,1928.17,"Well, Justice Kavanaugh, in the statute, it's separated."
2018.16-1275,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2038.48,2040.85,And that's also why Skull Valley is right?
2018.16-1275,2,42810,toby_j_heytens,,2040.85,2082.87,"Yes, Justice Kagan, because the vast majority of the activities in Skull Valley were NRC-regulated activities. And we have no quarrel with that decision whatsoever. But the other reason is even if -- so, to go back to Justice Alito's hypothetical, excuse me -- even if it appeared on the face of the statute, the first reason we think that that law is not preempted, and if that law's not preempted, this law is obviously not preempted, but even if the Court were inclined to reserve judgment or to carve out an exception for a law where that sort of purpose is stated on the text or the face of the statute, there would be no justification for unleashing the, all things considered, subjective motivations of the state legislature that we see in the blue brief and the yellow brief. And, here, I think what --"
2018.16-1275,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2082.87,2089.35,Now the motives in my opinion is a bad word because you don't know people's motives.
2018.16-1275,2,42810,toby_j_heytens,,2178.905,2187.55,"I think I have two answers, Justice Breyer. The first one is that when we're dealing with a state legislature, which is fundamentally, as you say, unlike Congress, and it's unlike Congress in a different way."
2018.16-1275,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2239.88,2241.12,And what does that mean?
2018.16-1275,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2241.12,2243.38,Now what do you mean by that? You had it in your brief.
2018.16-1275,2,42810,toby_j_heytens,,2278.0,2279.5,"Fair enough, Justice Ginsburg."
2018.16-1275,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2318.36,2326.06,"Well, how much is -- I'm trying to envision -- you know, one ton sounds like a lot, but a ton of dirt, how -- how much is that? That's not -- it's probably not that much."
2018.16-1275,2,42810,toby_j_heytens,,2327.915,2332.31,"Perhaps, Mr. Chief Justice, but our friends on the other side -- it's also not one pound of uranium."
2018.16-1275,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2349.89,2355.305,"Well, Virginia allows coal mining and has a fair amount of coal mining in the western part of the state."
2018.16-1275,2,42810,toby_j_heytens,,2381.805,2393.25,"And, Justice Alito, I think there is an apparent and obvious explanation that is all -- that the Court doesn't need to do anything beyond -- it's something the Chief Justice flagged. There is -- Virginia could easily decide that there is a world of difference."
2018.16-1275,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2420.41,2426.64,"Well, that may be. You could have a moratorium on mining, period. You could have a mora -- no more mining of anything in Virginia."
2018.16-1275,2,42810,toby_j_heytens,,2427.74,2428.83,We -- we certainly --
2018.16-1275,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2428.83,2430.44,That's not what the legislature did here.
2018.16-1275,2,42810,toby_j_heytens,,2430.44,2446.73,"It's not what they did, and it's also what the court in Pacific Gas said, it's not what California was required to do, because there was an argument that was made in Pacific Gas that, if California really meant their proffered rationale, there are other steps that California could have and perhaps would have taken if they wanted to pursue that goal at all costs."
2018.16-1275,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2446.73,2447.3,Once you start --
2018.16-1275,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2447.3,2448.255,If we don't accept --
2018.16-1275,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2448.255,2450.61,"I'm sorry, please. No, go ahead."
2018.16-1275,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2450.61,2461.93,"If we don't accept your broader position, what do you think of the Solicitor General's suggestion that we look at whether the state has a plausible non-safety rationale?"
2018.16-1275,2,42810,toby_j_heytens,,2461.93,2466.87,"We think that that's the language the Court -- once you decide to do purpose, that's the second point I was making earlier."
2018.16-1275,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2479.15,2490.05,"But you -- you -- you, at the pleadings stage, you made a concession that the purpose of the ban was to address radiological safety concerns. Why did you make that concession?"
2018.16-1275,2,42810,toby_j_heytens,,2490.05,2495.76,"Well, Justice Ginsburg, I want to -- I'm glad to have the opportunity to address that. We didn't concede anything."
2018.16-1275,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2511.94,2515.17,"Well, why did you even do that? Why is this a factual allegation?"
2018.16-1275,2,42810,toby_j_heytens,,2515.17,2523.23,"Well, to the extent that what was in someone's mind when they did something, I think that is a factual allegation, but our submission is that's not relevant and that's not how you determine --"
2018.16-1275,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2523.23,2525.57,But it's not about what's in their mind.
2018.16-1275,2,42810,toby_j_heytens,,2550.42,2550.725,Right.
2018.16-1275,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2550.725,2557.305,"Now that too has been used for hundreds of -- I don't know if hundreds, but many, many, many years."
2018.16-1275,2,42810,toby_j_heytens,,2557.305,2557.83,Absolutely.
2018.16-1275,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2557.83,2560.12,"So we don't have to look in their minds, do we?"
2018.16-1275,2,42810,toby_j_heytens,,2560.12,2563.99,"Well -- well, Justice Breyer, that is exactly what the Petitioners are asking you to do."
2018.16-1275,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2564.8,2593.62,"It may be, but regardless, my question is, why do you have to look in their minds? What you do is the same thing you do with a federal statute, what you do with statutes every day: You get provisions and you say reading the words, reading the applications, dah-dah, dah-dah, dah-dah, you know, fill in the blanks, what would a reasonable legislator have wanted this purpose -- what purpose would it have served? I think I've done that, perhaps wrongly -- I don't think so -- hundreds of times."
2018.16-1275,2,42810,toby_j_heytens,,2593.62,2594.82,"Yes, Justice Breyer, we agree with --"
2018.16-1275,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2594.82,2602.215,"Okay? So all they want is a chance to show that, but, here, you say you don't even get a chance to show it."
2018.16-1275,2,42810,toby_j_heytens,,2602.215,2608.04,"Justice Breyer, we agree with everything you just said about purpose. And it brings me back to my answer to Justice Kagan and Justice Ginsburg."
2018.16-1275,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2624.82,2626.98,"But, counsel, what I'm hearing is rationale basis review."
2018.16-1275,2,42810,toby_j_heytens,,2676.79,2693.61,"Well, Justice Gorsuch, we absolutely agree with you, which is why our primary submission is that, because this is not an area that's regulated by the federal government at all, you don't do any sort of purpose analysis. That -- our primary submission is that exactly what you just said, Justice Gorsuch, that there's no warrant to do that, there's no need to do that, and the Court shouldn't do it."
2018.16-1275,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2693.61,2724.275,"Well, except where do we draw the line or how do we draw it between the Skull decision and the Second Circuit Vermont decision? There, activities that the state were -- were alleged to be doing were intended and did, in fact, affect regulated conduct by the federal government. But one could say here, if you prohibit mining, you're affecting milling or disposal."
2018.16-1275,2,42810,toby_j_heytens,,2724.275,2724.68,Right.
2018.16-1275,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2724.68,2734.205,So how -- where and how do we draw the line between that regulation that we're permitted to look to purpose for and that which we're not?
2018.16-1275,2,42810,toby_j_heytens,,2734.205,2734.71,Right.
2018.16-1275,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2857.47,2859.0,Suppose --
2018.16-1275,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2859.0,2868.585,"2021, Section (c), 2021(c)(4) says that the Commission shall retain the authority to regulate the disposal of byproduct."
2018.16-1275,2,42810,toby_j_heytens,,2885.635,2885.79,Sure.
2018.16-1275,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2885.79,2889.62,Why is it tied -- why do you -- why do you say (k) is tied solely to --
2018.16-1275,2,42810,toby_j_heytens,,2889.62,2890.08,Sure.
2018.16-1275,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2890.08,2890.81,-- licensing?
2018.16-1275,2,42810,toby_j_heytens,,2890.81,2893.77,"Well, Justice Alito, first, in this case, we're not talking about byproduct."
2018.16-1275,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2901.965,2907.88,"Well, it goes on to say the disposal of such other byproducts source or special nuclear material."
2018.16-1275,2,42810,toby_j_heytens,,2907.88,2908.415,Correct.
2018.16-1275,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2952.84,2960.675,But do you dispute the fact that the NRC has -- occupies the field of regulation of source material?
2018.16-1275,2,42810,toby_j_heytens,,2960.675,2962.0,After it leaves the ground.
2018.16-1275,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2962.0,2963.15,After it leaves the ground.
2018.16-1275,2,42810,toby_j_heytens,,2963.15,2967.63,"Well, but -- but that's the critical distinction in this case because our whole point that -- the predicate of our argument --"
2018.16-1275,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2967.63,2982.345,"Yeah, but if the -- if -- if a state law indirectly, surreptitiously regulates the same thing, it would fall within the prohibited field."
2018.16-1275,2,42810,toby_j_heytens,,2982.345,3019.48,"Justice Alito, I guess I'd have to know -- I'd have to have a little more information about what we mean by ""indirectly or surreptitiously regulates the same thing,"" because it's certainly -- if -- if we're talking about Petitioners' strong version of that argument, that is completely inconsistent with this Court's rejection of a field preemption argument in Pacific Gas, because think about the argument that California -- excuse me, not California -- that Pacific Gas and the federal government made for preemption in that case. Of course, allowing the nation's largest state to prevent nuclear power construction -- nuclear power plant construction, of course, that is going to have a profound impact on the civilian nuclear power industry in the United States."
2018.16-1275,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3046.3,3051.43,"But, of course, Mr. Heytens, not for reasons having to do with radiological safety."
2018.16-1275,2,42810,toby_j_heytens,,3051.43,3051.69,Yes.
2018.16-1275,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3051.69,3088.75,"And I suppose one way to understand this -- the preemptive field here is that it surely extends to various kinds of activities, and this is not one of those activities, the mining. But, in addition, it extends to judgments about radiological safety, even outside those activities, on the theory that the NRC is the proper body to make judgments about radiological safety and we don't want 50 states to be making their own. So I suppose that's a -- a way to explain the opposite position."
2018.16-1275,2,42810,toby_j_heytens,,3088.75,3119.04,"I agree with that, Justice Kagan, but I think the very last thing you said shows why that argument can't possibly be right. NRC lacks the authority to regulate even the radiological safety aspects of mining. So the logical -- if you define the field that way, the logical implication of that argument is that there is literally no one who has the authority to regulate radiological safety aspects of uranium mining, because the NRC can't do it, because the NRC has repeatedly reaffirmed that they have no power to do anything."
2018.16-1275,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3119.04,3127.735,Aren't the radiological safety issues posed by the milling far more than the mining? I thought that was why you're concerned about the milling.
2018.16-1275,2,42810,toby_j_heytens,,3137.265,3137.805,Sure.
2018.16-1275,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3137.805,3138.75,-- that's the point.
2018.16-1275,2,42810,toby_j_heytens,,3138.75,3146.615,"Justice Kavanaugh, I think -- I think that's right, and I think part of the reason that Congress has given NRC jurisdiction over the milling is because of those various concerns."
2018.16-1275,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3146.93,3147.83,Just one technical point --
2018.16-1275,2,42810,toby_j_heytens,,3147.83,3148.1,I'm sorry.
2018.16-1275,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3148.1,3153.3,-- on phrasing. The Solicitor General said plausible non-safety rationale.
2018.16-1275,2,42810,toby_j_heytens,,3158.75,3162.19,"Yes, I would, Justice Kavanaugh, and I think that's consistent with what they've said in their briefing."
2018.16-1275,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3175.73,3176.12,Right.
2018.16-1275,2,42810,toby_j_heytens,,3176.12,3179.04,There's the radiological safety aspects of the mining process.
2018.16-1275,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3187.72,3191.61,"It's all of the concerns, isn't it, on radiological safety? Almost all?"
2018.16-1275,2,42810,toby_j_heytens,,3191.61,3194.02,"I -- I want to amend it to almost all, Justice Kavanaugh."
2018.16-1275,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3278.915,3281.75,"Thank you, counsel. Four minutes, Mr. Cooper."
2018.16-1275,3,18687,charles_j_cooper,,3281.75,3298.73,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. And, Justice Kavanaugh, I want to come straight to your point that you cannot mill mining unless you have -- mill uranium unless you have mined it in the first place. There were two ways for Virginia to prohibit milling and tailings management, both of which they were concerned about."
2018.16-1275,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3321.26,3332.91,"Suppose -- suppose -- suppose they say our rationale does have to do with the mining, not the milling; we think there are radiological hazards from -- from the unearthing the -- the uranium."
2018.16-1275,3,18687,charles_j_cooper,,3334.23,3356.72,"Your Honor, they could say that, but a court would have to look behind it, would have to look behind at using all the techniques that my friend, the Solicitor General, has mentioned, including plausibility. But, to come back, Justice Kavanaugh, I want to make clear that the Court understand, as Justice Gorsuch has referenced, that the statute that banned mining had sister provisions."
2018.16-1275,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3561.03,3561.93,"Thank you, counsel."
