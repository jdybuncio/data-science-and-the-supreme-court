1956.38,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,28.018,"Pollard, Petitioner, versus United States of America."
1956.38,0,17475,bennett_boskey,,29.012,32.862,May it please the Court.
1956.38,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,126.904,128.667,Sorry to interrupt you so early.
1956.38,0,17475,bennett_boskey,,141.687,146.537,"Mr. Justice Frankfurter, I said that I think it's relevant to some of the points I come to."
1956.38,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,146.537,149.905,You're not making a point of that in substantive issues.
1956.38,0,17475,bennett_boskey,,149.905,152.697,"In my brief, I have referred to it but one of the times --"
1956.38,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,152.697,154.898,But I want to know now in the arguments.
1956.38,0,17475,bennett_boskey,,154.898,156.025,"Yes, sir, I am."
1956.38,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,156.025,161.582,"Well, I understand that being the case."
1956.38,0,17475,bennett_boskey,,169.304,169.611,This is not --
1956.38,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,169.611,177.876,"I'm just going to say there was no counsel at any stage in this case until you were assigned happily by the Court, is that right?"
1956.38,0,17475,bennett_boskey,,177.876,183.649,"Whether happy or not, Your Honor, there were no counsel in this case until I was assigned by the Court."
1956.38,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,190.083,194.327,"My next question is, are you raising explicitly Johnson and Zerbst?"
1956.38,0,17475,bennett_boskey,,194.327,195.819,This case is not Johnson and Zerbst as such because --
1956.38,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,195.819,196.97,"All right, I thought (Voice Overlap) --"
1956.38,0,17475,bennett_boskey,,196.97,203.833,-- because petitioner knowingly pleaded guilty as I was just about to say.
1956.38,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,209.647,216.606,None is raised as to the non-assignment of counsel into this position at any time up to this -- up to the time you get here.
1956.38,0,17475,bennett_boskey,,217.414,218.499,"No, sir, I have not --"
1956.38,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,218.499,224.085,"-- derivative arguments but you and I ought to understand each other, is this a Johnson and Zerbst situation?"
1956.38,0,17475,bennett_boskey,,225.198,225.779,"No, I didn't."
1956.38,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,239.573,241.674,"Well, Johnson and Zerbst are being decided by you?"
1956.38,0,17475,bennett_boskey,,241.674,246.057,"No, because Johnson and Zerbst was a case in which counsel was absent at the time."
1956.38,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,249.298,250.202,All right.
1956.38,0,17475,bennett_boskey,,256.071,264.789,"Well, the -- the case arose in the District of Minnesota, in the United States District Court for the District of Minnesota."
1956.38,1,37869,philip_elman,,2331.422,2335.077,May it please the Court.
1956.38,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2381.697,2383.009,Does the Government --
1956.38,1,37869,philip_elman,,2383.009,2383.504,I --
1956.38,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2383.504,2393.397,What's the Government's view on whether this was a fair proceeding or not so far as this defendant is concerned?
1956.38,1,37869,philip_elman,,2393.397,2426.83,"So far as -- so far as -- let me make it perfectly clear, Mr. Chief Justice, that if the Government believe that they sentence is as Mr. Boskey has charged in his brief that here, the victim of a deliberate, disgraceful, oppressive, arbitrary, unfair combination of actions, I would be here to confess adversary."
1956.38,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2426.83,2451.76,"Well, let's do that on those adjectives and just say do you -- do you think so far as this proceeding is concerned or does the Government feel so far as this proceeding is concerned that it was a -- a fair proceeding insofar as this defendant was concerned and so far as any future defendants are -- are concerned in the event we sustain the action of the Government here."
1956.38,1,37869,philip_elman,,2451.76,2462.567,"The Government's position here is that the events that took place in the District Court on October 3rd, 1952 were invalid."
1956.38,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2473.387,2478.498,"(Voice Overlap) that reaches the question of fairness, I mean."
1956.38,1,37869,philip_elman,,2502.913,2518.724,"Well, I don't wish -- I don't wish to -- to quibble about the word fairness because I think fairness involves the making of a moral judgement as to all the parties concerned including the judge, the Government officials, the clerk as well as the defendant."
1956.38,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2545.77,2552.648,"No, I think -- I think the key problem here is whether there's been fairness to the defendant not to the judge."
1956.38,1,37869,philip_elman,,2553.599,2579.11,"Well, I -- I would -- I would be willing to assume that what happened on the initial hearing was unfair to the defendant in a sense that the sentence that was imposed upon him was illegal and that the procedures that attended that imposition of sentence were not in compliance with the requirements of law."
1956.38,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2671.04,2671.133,(Voice Overlap) --
1956.38,1,37869,philip_elman,,2671.133,2672.267,-- that he imposed the sentence in that time.
1956.38,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2672.267,2680.853,What is there -- what is there in that -- in the language that -- of the judge at that time to disprove that contention of Mr. Boskey's?
1956.38,1,37869,philip_elman,,2688.607,2696.548,"May I -- may I put the matter in some perspective, sir?"
1956.38,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2696.548,2698.399,All right.
1956.38,1,37869,philip_elman,,2698.399,2707.259,"Mr. Pollard had pleaded guilty on September 8th, 1952, three weeks earlier."
1956.38,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2831.238,2833.407,Well let's -- let's stay with that for just a moment.
1956.38,1,37869,philip_elman,,2845.131,2845.15,"Well, certainly, --"
1956.38,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2845.15,2852.809,What -- what can you point to -- what can you point to in the record to show that that wasn't the intention of the judge?
1956.38,1,37869,philip_elman,,2852.809,2856.539,Our position is that the intention of the judge was not clear.
1956.38,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2872.632,2872.68,"Well, --"
1956.38,1,37869,philip_elman,,2872.68,2886.038,"And our suggestion is, sir, that the -- that the judge in saying to the defendant, don't get in trouble anymore, don't come back here again, that is all."
1956.38,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2953.216,2958.599,But the fact that it wasn't done in any -- in other instances --
1956.38,1,37869,philip_elman,,2958.599,2960.981,"It's not conclusive here at all, no."
1956.38,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2978.379,2985.245,"Now, why don't you read -- why don't you read what he said to us and that's very -- it's very short and --"
1956.38,1,37869,philip_elman,,2985.245,2985.291,All right.
1956.38,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2985.291,2988.334,-- it's very simple and very plain to me.
1956.38,1,37869,philip_elman,,2995.428,2995.736,"Well, it's two pages."
1956.38,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2995.736,2996.567,(Voice Overlap) --
1956.38,1,37869,philip_elman,,2996.567,3004.907,"It start -- it starts on page 4, middle of the page and it goes on at the top of page 6."
1956.38,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3004.907,3011.889,"Well, I don't care for all of it, but if there's anything there -- in there that would indicate that he wasn't finished with the case at that time."
1956.38,1,37869,philip_elman,,3015.168,3018.198,I -- I don't think there's anything that I can point to that says --
1956.38,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3018.198,3018.495,All right.
1956.38,1,37869,philip_elman,,3018.495,3019.411,-- he is not finished with the case.
1956.38,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3019.411,3019.911,All right.
1956.38,1,37869,philip_elman,,3019.911,3020.038,I think the judge thought --
1956.38,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3020.038,3021.351,"Now, (Voice Overlap) --"
1956.38,1,37869,philip_elman,,3021.351,3028.024,-- the case was finished as far as he was concerned if Mr. Pollard behaved himself and didn't come back to -- to his courtroom.
1956.38,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3091.269,3093.084,I don't know whether it's reasonable or not.
1956.38,1,37869,philip_elman,,3114.006,3117.19,"Oh, sir, this -- this case comes out --"
1956.38,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3117.19,3122.591,"That's the question in the case, whether he did or didn't on the circumstance of the situation."
1956.38,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3122.591,3123.966,"No, I don't think it is."
1956.38,1,37869,philip_elman,,3123.966,3130.226,"No, since -- since the Government conceded that the probation order was illegal since the defendant was in the courtroom --"
1956.38,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3130.226,3131.558,Sure.
1956.38,1,37869,philip_elman,,3131.558,3140.628,"-- we, this case, it has -- it has comes here -- comes here on -- on the record which particularly meager since there was no hearing."
1956.38,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3140.628,3141.605,But isn't (Inaudible) --
1956.38,1,37869,philip_elman,,3141.605,3141.936,The --
1956.38,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3141.936,3149.405,"-- question in this case whether what Judge Joyce did was final, definitive so that he was functus officio."
1956.38,1,37869,philip_elman,,3150.088,3151.647,That's precisely the question.
1956.38,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3172.543,3172.676,"Now, can I --"
1956.38,1,37869,philip_elman,,3172.676,3179.43,So that's the issue to which the petition for certiorari and the brief of -- of Mr. Boskey were addressed.
1956.38,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3186.258,3186.52,"Well, now let me --"
1956.38,1,37869,philip_elman,,3186.52,3186.893,It is --
1956.38,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3186.893,3187.661,-- ask you this.
1956.38,1,37869,philip_elman,,3193.946,3196.299,There's no -- there's no question -- it was a definitive action.
1956.38,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3198.026,3199.288,"Well, if that's your position --"
1956.38,1,37869,philip_elman,,3199.288,3199.513,Yes.
1956.38,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3199.513,3202.547,-- and it was definitive and that it was legal.
1956.38,1,37869,philip_elman,,3206.674,3207.421,It would have been clear.
1956.38,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3209.91,3213.038,Suppose it was 10?
1956.38,1,37869,philip_elman,,3213.038,3228.784,"Well, I -- I think that if there were any -- at any period after the expiration of three-year probationary period, there would be -- there would be a very serious question as to whether the defendant hadn't already served the sentence even though it was an illegal sentence --"
1956.38,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3228.784,3231.735,Why do you say three years?
1956.38,1,37869,philip_elman,,3231.735,3235.749,"Well, because the judge had purported to put him on probation for three years.Now --"
1956.38,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3235.749,3238.678,"Well, I know, but he only did that after the two-year lapse."
1956.38,1,37869,philip_elman,,3240.324,3241.449,"No, no, this is -- no, sir."
1956.38,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3247.558,3252.533,"You admit that that's -- that's totally ineffective, that it's totally illegal and you --"
1956.38,1,37869,philip_elman,,3252.533,3252.752,"Yes, but --"
1956.38,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3252.752,3262.732,-- can't refer -- you can't refer back to that as I see it to support your -- your -- any conclusion so far as the -- the order two years later is concerned.
1956.38,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3262.732,3266.255,But you can infer (Inaudible) in order to show the judges' mind.
1956.38,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3266.255,3274.208,His mind didn't amount anything after he'd -- after he'd excuse the defendant and had purported to -- to dispose of the case because (Voice Overlap) --
1956.38,1,37869,philip_elman,,3274.208,3274.925,"Well, Mr. Chief Justice, you -- you were focused --"
1956.38,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3274.925,3277.504,"Well, that's the question when they did dispose of the case."
1956.38,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3277.504,3285.457,The law says that the -- the defendant is entitled to be present whenever he is sentenced and whenever the judge takes--
1956.38,1,37869,philip_elman,,3285.457,3285.49,He was.
1956.38,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3285.49,3287.968,-- any action against him.
1956.38,1,37869,philip_elman,,3299.163,3302.098,We don't disagree with the word you said Mr. Chief Justice.
1956.38,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3399.288,3409.293,"Now, where were the terms -- what terms of probation did the -- did the judge laid down even in -- in October of 1954?"
1956.38,1,37869,philip_elman,,3409.293,3409.578,That's something --
1956.38,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3409.578,3411.354,What -- what terms?
1956.38,1,37869,philip_elman,,3411.354,3413.396,"October 1952, sir."
1956.38,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3413.396,3413.644,Yes.
1956.38,1,37869,philip_elman,,3413.644,3415.444,That's page 7 of the record.
1956.38,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3415.444,3415.602,Yes.
1956.38,1,37869,philip_elman,,3419.149,3431.7,"The -- the terms of -- it is further ordered that during the period of probation, the defendant shall conduct himself as a law abiding industrious citizen and observe such conditions of probation as the Court may prescribe."
1956.38,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3436.925,3439.376,That was the illegal act of the judge.
1956.38,1,37869,philip_elman,,3439.376,3441.297,That was the illegal act of the judge.
1956.38,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3491.418,3496.469,He didn't know about that probation order the day it was rendered.
1956.38,1,37869,philip_elman,,3498.858,3500.794,On --
1956.38,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3500.794,3501.905,Is there?
1956.38,1,37869,philip_elman,,3501.905,3502.309,"Yes, sir."
1956.38,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3502.673,3503.022,Where?
1956.38,1,37869,philip_elman,,3503.022,3505.513,Not on the day that he was -- it was surrounded by (Inaudible) in prison.
1956.38,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3505.513,3508.489,That's what you were -- that's the burden you were putting on him.
1956.38,1,37869,philip_elman,,3512.052,3516.957,"No, on the day he was released from prison which was November 26, 1952, less than two months later."
1956.38,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3516.957,3517.971,"Oh, that day."
1956.38,1,37869,philip_elman,,3517.971,3527.429,"If he had come back in November 1952, the District Judge, no one would be arguing seriously that that -- it was such a lapse of time."
1956.38,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3527.429,3531.572,"Well, in response to what should he have gone back to the District Judge?1"
1956.38,1,37869,philip_elman,,3531.572,3531.613,We don't --
1956.38,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3531.613,3533.658,"Was there any order of the Court, or any notice to him?"
1956.38,1,37869,philip_elman,,3533.658,3535.726,We don't think he should have gone back.
1956.38,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3561.571,3565.525,What is the present statute over a period of probation?
1956.38,1,37869,philip_elman,,3565.525,3566.958,The maximum is five years.
1956.38,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3566.958,3567.757,Five years.
1956.38,1,37869,philip_elman,,3571.747,3573.903,"October 3rd, 1952."
1956.38,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3573.903,3574.706,"October, what?"
1956.38,1,37869,philip_elman,,3574.706,3576.573,"October 3rd, 1952."
1956.38,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3576.573,3587.991,"October 3rd, is -- Judge Joyce had on that day said, I put you on probation."
1956.38,1,37869,philip_elman,,3603.282,3606.947,He could have been brought in at any time prior to the expiration of five-year period.
