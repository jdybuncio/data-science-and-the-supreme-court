1990.90-26,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.186,"We'll hear argument next in No. 90-26, Michael Barnes v. Glen Theatre, Inc.--"
1990.90-26,0,46440,wayne_e_uhl,,9.808,13.821,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.90-26,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,26.74,29.0,Without being in trouble.
1990.90-26,0,46440,wayne_e_uhl,,29.0,29.992,--That's correct.
1990.90-26,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,55.44,59.003,He can evidently sing in an opera without his clothes one.
1990.90-26,0,46440,wayne_e_uhl,,59.003,74.601,"Well, our point, Your Honor, is that the plaintiffs say that if he starts dancing when he gets up on that stage or up on that bar, then he can do anything... or anything that can be defined as dancing... then he's privileged under the First Amendment to appear naked, notwithstanding Indiana's public indecency statute."
1990.90-26,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,74.601,75.883,What about seeing an opera?
1990.90-26,0,46440,wayne_e_uhl,,85.69,94.894,"The Indiana Supreme Court, in order to avoid an overbreadth challenge, has held that the statute does not affect activity which cannot be restricted by the First Amendment."
1990.90-26,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,100.879,102.982,Which includes opera but not go-go dancing?
1990.90-26,0,46440,wayne_e_uhl,,102.982,104.51,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1990.90-26,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,104.51,106.461,Is there... where does that come from?
1990.90-26,0,46440,wayne_e_uhl,,106.461,115.828,"Your Honor, the court looked at cases such as Southeastern Promotions where this Court in implied that the production of Hair, for example, needed to include nudity."
1990.90-26,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,119.922,121.942,It is the good-taste clause of the Constitution?
1990.90-26,0,46440,wayne_e_uhl,,130.187,137.353,"--The line is drawn the same way the line is drawn anytime conduct is involved, and that is whether or not the conduct communicates."
1990.90-26,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,144.449,144.946,--Communicates what?
1990.90-26,0,46440,wayne_e_uhl,,145.497,149.2,Communicates a particularized message or an idea.
1990.90-26,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,149.2,153.404,What about a particularized message and an idea of sensuality?
1990.90-26,0,46440,wayne_e_uhl,,153.404,155.755,That could be communicated.
1990.90-26,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,162.911,164.333,Because they were not good enough dancers?
1990.90-26,0,46440,wayne_e_uhl,,164.333,168.415,"No, it didn't have anything to do with the quality of the dance, Your Honor."
1990.90-26,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,169.096,170.535,"Well, could a dance communicate that?"
1990.90-26,0,46440,wayne_e_uhl,,170.535,172.368,"--Yes, a dance could communicate that."
1990.90-26,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,172.368,173.958,But this one didn't?
1990.90-26,0,46440,wayne_e_uhl,,173.958,175.48,These dances did not.
1990.90-26,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,175.48,176.819,Because they were not good enough dancers?
1990.90-26,0,46440,wayne_e_uhl,,176.819,179.681,"No, Your Honor, it wasn't the quality of the dancing."
1990.90-26,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,182.592,191.899,"Well, Mr. Uhl, are you conceding that if conduct does communicate, then it can't be regulated at all under the First Amendment?"
1990.90-26,0,46440,wayne_e_uhl,,191.899,198.975,"No, Your Honor, our second issue in the case is that even if this dance is speech, then it can be restricted under the First Amendment."
1990.90-26,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,233.216,251.409,But in light of the Baysinger and other decisions of your State's courts it does seem that what's left is not content neutral in all respects.
1990.90-26,0,46440,wayne_e_uhl,,251.409,259.402,"Your Honor, I think the respondents have over construed Baysinger when they say that Baysinger created some kind of a speech exception."
1990.90-26,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,259.402,265.527,"Well, but you said today that Indiana has held that the statute doesn't apply to certain performances."
1990.90-26,0,46440,wayne_e_uhl,,265.527,269.82,Indiana's held that only if that is required by the First Amendment.
1990.90-26,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,269.82,280.898,"Well, that seems to be the position that the court has taken, and in light of that, how can you take the position here that the statute is content neutral?"
1990.90-26,0,46440,wayne_e_uhl,,280.898,287.673,The Indiana Supreme Court did not consider the possibility that this statute might be a reasonable restriction on speech.
1990.90-26,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,321.734,334.253,"Suppose the dancers complied with the statute, and... would you say that then the dancing is protected by the First Amendment?"
1990.90-26,0,46440,wayne_e_uhl,,334.253,337.606,"Well, our second argument assumes that the dancing is speech."
1990.90-26,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,337.606,338.147,"No, no."
1990.90-26,0,46440,wayne_e_uhl,,352.615,358.229,The protection of the dance doesn't depend on whether or not the clothing is worn for the purposes of our second argument.
1990.90-26,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,358.229,360.389,How about the first argument?
1990.90-26,0,46440,wayne_e_uhl,,360.389,364.292,"Well, the clothing doesn't change the nature of the dance either."
1990.90-26,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,371.556,374.409,"Well, Justice White's question puts this point."
1990.90-26,0,46440,wayne_e_uhl,,381.062,385.036,Not on the basis of--
1990.90-26,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,385.036,392.031,Of the first... I thought... the dancing wouldn't... clothed or unclothed--
1990.90-26,0,46440,wayne_e_uhl,,392.031,392.24,--Oh.
1990.90-26,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,392.24,396.153,--it wouldn't... the message would not change or the lack of it wouldn't change.
1990.90-26,0,46440,wayne_e_uhl,,396.153,401.556,"No, our position is that the dancers would still have to show that if they took off their clothes that there's an extra message."
1990.90-26,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,401.556,414.025,"No, that's no... suppose the dancers were clothed and suppose the State of Indiana or a police official attempted to prohibit that performance, a clothed performance, would the First Amendment protect the performer?"
1990.90-26,0,46440,wayne_e_uhl,,414.025,417.868,"No, not these performances in this case."
1990.90-26,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,417.868,422.232,Then you're saying it would be permissible to pass a statute prohibiting tap dancing?
1990.90-26,0,46440,wayne_e_uhl,,422.232,427.064,"Unless tap dancing were shown to be speech under the First Amendment, that's correct."
1990.90-26,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,427.064,430.838,"Well, but under your view it doesn't convey any particular message so you could prohibit it."
1990.90-26,0,46440,wayne_e_uhl,,430.838,432.16,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1990.90-26,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,432.16,436.701,"Well, you might not be able to prohibit under some other provision in the Constitution."
1990.90-26,0,46440,wayne_e_uhl,,438.972,439.783,That's correct.
1990.90-26,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,442.314,445.837,Could the State prohibit rock music?
1990.90-26,0,46440,wayne_e_uhl,,445.837,453.153,"--Your Honor, this Court found in the Ward case that rock music is speech under the First Amendment, so no, it could not."
1990.90-26,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,453.671,457.305,"Well, how is it that music is protected but dance is not?"
1990.90-26,0,46440,wayne_e_uhl,,457.305,458.236,--Music is different--
1990.90-26,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,458.236,459.616,Could you explain that?
1990.90-26,0,46440,wayne_e_uhl,,459.616,463.328,--Music is different from dance in that the very nature of the medium is communicative.
1990.90-26,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,468.772,475.467,Do you think some of the rock music played in the Ward case conveyed a message?
1990.90-26,0,46440,wayne_e_uhl,,476.298,477.328,--An artistic message.
1990.90-26,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,477.328,478.75,An artistic message?
1990.90-26,0,46440,wayne_e_uhl,,478.75,480.058,An artistic message.
1990.90-26,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,486.113,489.054,"Well, I suggest not all music does either."
1990.90-26,0,46440,wayne_e_uhl,,489.054,498.982,That may be a case-by-case determination and this Court hasn't addressed that except in Ward to say that music in general is communicative and therefore is speech under the First Amendment.
1990.90-26,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,498.982,503.606,"Well, dance in general might be communicative under that test, might it not?"
1990.90-26,0,46440,wayne_e_uhl,,503.606,510.419,"We would resist that, Your Honor, because dance can be so broadly defined as to include perhaps what I'm doing here today."
1990.90-26,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,512.541,513.172,Song and dance.
1990.90-26,0,46440,wayne_e_uhl,,513.712,514.964,"--Well, not that kind of song and dance."
1990.90-26,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,548.614,552.007,Why... what are you arguing about dance for?
1990.90-26,0,46440,wayne_e_uhl,,553.927,554.969,That's correct.
1990.90-26,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,554.969,558.962,These people could have danced to their heart's content so long as they had clothes on or--
1990.90-26,0,46440,wayne_e_uhl,,558.962,559.961,That's correct.
1990.90-26,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,596.376,601.187,"--Mr. Uhl, I'm interested in one of your answers to Justice Kennedy."
1990.90-26,0,46440,wayne_e_uhl,,604.19,605.512,"No, Your Honor."
1990.90-26,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,609.205,613.396,So the State stands by its concession that we are not dealing with obscenity?
1990.90-26,0,46440,wayne_e_uhl,,613.396,614.497,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1990.90-26,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,614.497,635.282,"If we were to find that an emotional communication as opposed to a particularized message were protectable, what would you then say to the argument on the other side that they simply cannot communicate the message in any other way except by nude dancing?"
1990.90-26,0,46440,wayne_e_uhl,,640.615,647.54,"If the medium is the message, Your Honor, then it's our contention that the nudity is not an essential part of that particular medium."
1990.90-26,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,668.684,680.061,So you're saying they cannot define their activity by saying the medium and the message are identical and thereby evade the possibility of otherwise permissible First Amendment regulation?
1990.90-26,0,46440,wayne_e_uhl,,680.061,681.391,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1990.90-26,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,706.368,723.159,"I suppose... you say that even if dancing nude might communicate a different message than complying with the statute, these particular dancers have never claimed or indicated that they were... had any such message to deliver I gather."
1990.90-26,0,46440,wayne_e_uhl,,723.159,724.069,That's correct.
1990.90-26,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,752.247,766.676,"What... would the case really be different if the dancer had a sign up at... on the stage that said she was a member of a nudist colony and she believed it healthy for people to attend nudist colonies and some message with it and then said, I'll illustrate to you how nice it is to be nude or something like that?"
1990.90-26,0,46440,wayne_e_uhl,,767.437,775.003,"No, Your Honor, that would be no different than the case in Florida of the sunbathers who claimed that they wanted to bathe out on the beach, and show--"
1990.90-26,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,775.003,782.206,"But it's different in the sense that you have a particularized message, and the dance is suppose to dramatize this message that she's also got a sign stating it."
1990.90-26,0,46440,wayne_e_uhl,,782.206,784.979,"--In terms of the particularized message, then it would be a different case."
1990.90-26,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,785.68,790.111,"Then you'd say that one would be protected, but as long as they don't put such signs up, it's unprotected."
1990.90-26,0,46440,wayne_e_uhl,,790.111,791.112,--It would be speech.
1990.90-26,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,803.462,804.71,And why is that?
1990.90-26,0,46440,wayne_e_uhl,,804.71,816.969,"Well, it's either because of the application of Employment Division v. Smith, because this is a general criminal statute, or it's by application of the reasonable time, place, and manner test that this Court has applied in other contexts."
1990.90-26,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,816.969,820.551,"Reasonable time, place, and manner being there's no reasonable time, place, or manner--"
1990.90-26,0,46440,wayne_e_uhl,,822.933,827.026,"Your Honor, reasonable place in that the statute is limited to a public place."
1990.90-26,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,827.026,827.417,Okay.
1990.90-26,0,46440,wayne_e_uhl,,827.417,831.659,And the Indiana courts have very carefully defined public place.
1990.90-26,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,849.57,852.262,How about the O'Brien test?
1990.90-26,0,46440,wayne_e_uhl,,852.262,858.877,"Well, this Court has found... in the Clark case the Court indicated that the O'Brien test is really no different than the reasonable time, place, and manner test."
1990.90-26,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,876.509,884.305,"Mr. Uhl, if there were a videotape of these performances, could the State ban outright the sale of the tape?"
1990.90-26,0,46440,wayne_e_uhl,,884.305,894.259,"No, Your Honor, because the videotape would not be live conduct, and the statute only goes to... and our First Amendment argument only applies to live conduct as opposed to depictions."
1990.90-26,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,894.259,903.987,"Yes, I'm asking you whether a statute could withstand a First Amendment test if it tried to ban sale of the videotape of the performance."
1990.90-26,0,46440,wayne_e_uhl,,903.987,905.958,"No, Your Honor, not unless the videotape were obscene."
1990.90-26,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,905.958,909.01,And why is that?
1990.90-26,0,46440,wayne_e_uhl,,914.804,919.756,This Court has always made a distinction between depictions of conduct and live conduct itself.
1990.90-26,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,937.069,947.074,Are you saying that this is sexually explicit conduct and that that's a category that we can use to sustain the law?
1990.90-26,0,46440,wayne_e_uhl,,947.074,954.03,We're not arguing that it's a special category that therefore is excluded from the First Amendment.
1990.90-26,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,962.505,964.476,And you have the LaRue case?
1990.90-26,0,46440,wayne_e_uhl,,965.077,968.178,"Not off the top of my head, Your Honor."
1990.90-26,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1001.021,1002.6,"That's why Dickens wrote his books, too."
1990.90-26,0,46440,wayne_e_uhl,,1002.6,1004.693,"Well, Your Honor, it's different."
1990.90-26,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1015.909,1017.209,You're sure about that?
1990.90-26,0,46440,wayne_e_uhl,,1019.222,1024.704,"I'm sure what Darlene Miller's intent was, Your Honor, and that was to make money."
1990.90-26,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1024.704,1031.888,"Yes, but your supreme court distinguishes between the opera singer and this dancer and I suppose the opera singer wants to make money, too."
1990.90-26,0,46440,wayne_e_uhl,,1031.888,1038.144,"That's true, although again the opera singer is in the position where that's not the only thing that she wants to do, but that the money is an important part of it."
1990.90-26,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1041.425,1044.689,And are all the... how many performers are involved in this litigation?
1990.90-26,0,46440,wayne_e_uhl,,1044.689,1048.973,In this litigation I think there are three dancers who are actually a part--
1990.90-26,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1048.973,1050.361,And did all three of them say that was their only motive?
1990.90-26,0,46440,wayne_e_uhl,,1050.361,1053.173,"--No, Your Honor, only Darlene Miller did."
1990.90-26,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1065.221,1069.756,"Yeah, but she may not have made the movie only to make money."
1990.90-26,0,46440,wayne_e_uhl,,1069.756,1071.796,"That's true, Your Honor, and we didn't ban the movie."
1990.90-26,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1075.279,1090.099,Are you really confident that we could make the distinction between dancing which is part of a greater form of artistic expression as opposed to dancing that is not artistic expression?
1990.90-26,0,46440,wayne_e_uhl,,1094.38,1106.989,"Your Honor, as in the case of obscenity where one of the issues is the artistic value of the work, trial judges and trial juries make the distinction under... in criminal prosecutions under this statute, just as in an obscenity case--"
1990.90-26,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1106.989,1109.32,But we have no settled jurisprudence.
1990.90-26,0,46440,wayne_e_uhl,,1112.643,1121.249,"--Well, Your Honor, there's... ever since Miller v. California, juries have been determining whether works that are charged to be obscene have artistic value."
1990.90-26,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1219.853,1223.265,"Excuse me, I should have jumped in earlier I guess."
1990.90-26,0,46440,wayne_e_uhl,,1246.172,1267.697,As of now... all the supreme court has done in Indiana is said that the statute isn't overbroad and the reason the statute is not overbroad is because we assume... and I'm reading this in... we assume that the First Amendment puts limits on our ability to ban nudity.
1990.90-26,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1278.223,1279.422,Larger?
1990.90-26,0,46440,wayne_e_uhl,,1279.422,1281.515,Larger forms of expression.
1990.90-26,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1281.515,1284.067,Some larger forms of expression meriting protection.
1990.90-26,0,46440,wayne_e_uhl,,1284.067,1285.256,Meriting protection.
1990.90-26,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1285.256,1289.89,Would you defining the larger form of expression by particularized message?
1990.90-26,0,46440,wayne_e_uhl,,1289.89,1291.39,"Yes, Your Honor."
1990.90-26,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1291.39,1299.747,"So if the particularized message distinction is not upheld, then you have no way of drawing the line between the higher and lower form."
1990.90-26,0,46440,wayne_e_uhl,,1299.747,1302.559,That very well may be true.
1990.90-26,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1313.416,1316.818,I gather you're saying that they don't really mean it.
1990.90-26,0,46440,wayne_e_uhl,,1329.116,1330.396,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1990.90-26,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1368.852,1370.992,What's the State interest in that distinction?
1990.90-26,0,46440,wayne_e_uhl,,1374.014,1385.882,"Well, the State interest, Your Honor, is that the more this becomes an audience participation kind of a situation that the State's interest in regulating that kind of conduct increases."
1990.90-26,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1385.882,1388.656,Why do they call this place a bookstore?
1990.90-26,0,46440,wayne_e_uhl,,1391.297,1400.912,"As I understand it, Your Honor, it is also an adult bookstore, that is, it sells pornographic materials in addition to offering this kind of booth entertainment."
1990.90-26,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1400.912,1407.848,"Mr. Uhl, I'm sorry to get out of sequence here, but I'd like to go back to a Baysinger point, lest I forget it."
1990.90-26,0,46440,wayne_e_uhl,,1433.894,1449.454,"No, Your Honor, I think Baysinger would then very much be cut back, because if this Court were also to hold, as we've urged in our second argument, that we can still restrict this activity consistent with the First Amendment, then we can still do that."
1990.90-26,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1450.176,1452.436,So Baysinger would still be a tautology as you put it.
1990.90-26,0,46440,wayne_e_uhl,,1452.436,1452.757,--That's correct.
1990.90-26,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1453.578,1453.746,Okay.
1990.90-26,0,46440,wayne_e_uhl,,1453.746,1458.72,The plaintiffs... back to narrowly tailored.
1990.90-26,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1512.584,1513.806,"Very well, Mr. Uhl."
1990.90-26,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,1515.458,1527.324,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.90-26,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1625.731,1634.627,"Mr. Ennis, would you concede that a State ban on nudity on public thoroughfares and sidewalks is constitutional?"
1990.90-26,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,1634.627,1642.222,"--Your Honor, I think it would trigger First Amendment analysis if it's intended to be expressive, but the State probably could regulate it because of the captive audience--"
1990.90-26,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1642.222,1644.843,"Well, supposing they regulate it by prohibiting it?"
1990.90-26,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,1644.843,1656.48,"--They could probably prohibit it because of the captive audience problem or exposure to children, just as in Sable the Court said that although indecent speech is constitutionally protected, it can nevertheless be... regulated."
1990.90-26,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1656.48,1665.165,So the vice in this statute as applied is that it takes it off the sidewalks and thoroughfares and regulates activity in a private--
1990.90-26,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,1665.165,1667.758,"Well, it is effectively a private place."
1990.90-26,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1671.62,1678.926,--What if your client had decided to perform a dance... this same dance... in a public park in Indiana?
1990.90-26,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,1678.926,1691.183,"I think the State could prohibit that, because of the concerns as in Sable of a captive audience being forced to see a message they do not want to see or the possibility of children being present."
1990.90-26,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1702.581,1706.953,"Well, were children barred from all these places?"
1990.90-26,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,1706.953,1707.413,Absolutely.
1990.90-26,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1712.687,1716.029,You began by using a term... was it dance performance?
1990.90-26,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,1716.029,1717.151,Performance dance.
1990.90-26,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1726.618,1737.613,"Suppose someone wanted to increase business at the car wash or in a bar and they hired a woman and said, now, you sit in this glass case... and this is an adults only carwash--"
1990.90-26,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,1745.708,1751.753,"Your Honor, I think it would... if it was intended as expressive activity, if it was performance dance."
1990.90-26,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1751.753,1752.984,"No, it's just what I said."
1990.90-26,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,1755.195,1757.626,I think that that would trigger First Amendment analysis.
1990.90-26,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1762.121,1765.503,"Well, suppose he said, I've heard the arguments in the Supreme Court and you have to dance."
1990.90-26,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,1769.814,1771.206,"Well, Your Honor--"
1990.90-26,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1771.206,1772.446,"I mean, that's the point, isn't it?"
1990.90-26,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,1775.507,1777.899,--What is performance dance is a question in this case.
1990.90-26,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1800.205,1808.1,"Well, even objectively I suppose you would say that any fool would say that there was a performance dance here, because there was dancing in front of people."
1990.90-26,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,1808.1,1809.561,"Yes, that's correct, Your Honor."
1990.90-26,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1809.561,1810.84,Whether they intended to or not.
1990.90-26,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,1810.84,1814.453,"Well, I think that's probably correct, Your Honor, but they did intend to."
1990.90-26,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1825.951,1828.713,"Mr. Ennis, nobody is stopping her from dancing."
1990.90-26,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,1863.405,1865.608,"Well, let me turn directly to that, Justice Scalia."
1990.90-26,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1872.301,1876.024,"So your answer to my last question is yes, it does turn on the State's justifications."
1990.90-26,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,1876.024,1876.515,--It does--
1990.90-26,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1876.515,1878.505,"That's a First Amendment case, if you kill somebody in the course of dancing."
1990.90-26,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,1878.505,1889.772,"--If someone uses peyote or commits a murder for the purpose of committing... communicating or expressive activity, that would trigger First Amendment analysis."
1990.90-26,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1922.273,1925.315,"The statute here, Mr. Ennis, isn't addressed to dancing at all."
1990.90-26,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,1927.907,1938.094,"The statute in O'Brien was not... the statute in many of the cases, like the flag-burning cases, was not addressed to expressive activity on its face."
1990.90-26,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1942.288,1944.558,But the equivalent here would be addressing it to dancing.
1990.90-26,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,1968.886,1969.634,Justice Scalia--
1990.90-26,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1969.634,1970.255,It's not nude dancing.
1990.90-26,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,1972.338,1978.152,"--Justice Scalia, the Court's opinion in O'Brien and all the flag-burning cases uses the same analysis."
1990.90-26,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2043.092,2051.947,"Well, what if the dancer wanted to do kind of an Annie Oakley dance in the course of which she fired off a revolver at various targets around the room--"
1990.90-26,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2051.947,2052.487,--Yes.
1990.90-26,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2052.487,2056.221,--and the State says that's a violation of our law.
1990.90-26,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2066.208,2066.927,"But, Your Honor--"
1990.90-26,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2066.927,2072.96,"But the State then says, well, we have real fears that if you do it in a crowded adult bookstore you might hurt somebody."
1990.90-26,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2077.005,2080.128,--But it does not depend upon the listeners' reactions to the speech.
1990.90-26,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2100.991,2108.034,"Well, why isn't the State's interest in banning public nudity unrelated to expressive activity?"
1990.90-26,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2111.306,2114.159,The State has told us that it does care.
1990.90-26,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2114.159,2114.469,Well--
1990.90-26,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2114.469,2116.022,The State has told what its reasons--
1990.90-26,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2116.022,2121.965,"--Well, let's assume that the State has said hypothetically, we don't care what are the audiences' reactions."
1990.90-26,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2125.649,2128.778,"--Well, Your Honor, that would be a different case."
1990.90-26,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2129.339,2132.461,So the State didn't advance quite the right justification here?
1990.90-26,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2132.461,2132.872,--No.
1990.90-26,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2132.872,2133.422,Is that your position?
1990.90-26,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2133.422,2135.793,"No, that's not my position, Justice Rehnquist."
1990.90-26,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2168.134,2174.468,"But before you get there, and this is an important point, but just on the last part about being related to expression, what about a noise statute?"
1990.90-26,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2174.468,2177.21,"I think, Your Honor--"
1990.90-26,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2177.21,2178.482,Is that related to expression?
1990.90-26,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2178.482,2198.414,"--I think the noise point, for example, in your opinion for the Court in Ward, the Court found that controlling volume there was unrelated to the expression because it applied... no matter who was expressing the message and regardless of the State's agreement or disagreement with the views or the listeners' reaction to that."
1990.90-26,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2198.414,2199.684,"Well, why couldn't you say the same thing about nudity?"
1990.90-26,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2199.684,2214.473,"You can't say that here certainly after the Baysinger construction, because the court in Baysinger makes clear that some nude dancing is permitted and others is prohibited based on the State's evaluation of its expressive value or artistic merit."
1990.90-26,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2219.559,2226.131,"But there's no difference between that kind of dancing and the dancing in this case based on the effect on the audience, is there?"
1990.90-26,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2226.131,2228.395,"I'm sorry, Justice White, I did not understand that question."
1990.90-26,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2228.395,2231.306,"Well, awhile ago you were talking about the effect on the audience."
1990.90-26,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2231.306,2232.218,Yes.
1990.90-26,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2232.218,2239.612,"Do you think there's any difference between, say, opera and the dancing in this case, in terms of the effect on the audience?"
1990.90-26,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2239.612,2240.881,The State seems to feel there is.
1990.90-26,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2242.153,2246.266,I thought you were just talking about its idea of the artistic value rather than the effect on the audience.
1990.90-26,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2246.266,2259.854,"--The State seems to feel that if nude dancing is artistic, it has one effect on the audience and does not incite the audience to prostitution, rape, or adultery, but that if nude dancing is not artistic, it does have that effect on the audience."
1990.90-26,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2259.854,2267.609,I suppose there are some things the State can prohibit even if... just because it has an effect on the audience.
1990.90-26,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2270.71,2279.316,"Your Honor, I think that there are certainly some categorical exceptions to otherwise First Amendment protections that the State could argue here."
1990.90-26,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2287.213,2300.28,"Well, you just recited that the State thought that nude dancing would have some unsatisfactory on the audience and you say that's not permissible because that means it's really expressive."
1990.90-26,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2300.28,2303.302,--It means that it is a content-based statute.
1990.90-26,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2303.302,2303.763,"Well, what about fire?"
1990.90-26,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2305.285,2311.97,Fire in a theater has an effect regardless of whether the listeners agree or disagree with the message.
1990.90-26,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2311.97,2312.949,"Well, it depends exactly on what you say."
1990.90-26,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2312.949,2313.96,"Pardon me, Your Honor."
1990.90-26,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2313.96,2315.931,It depends exactly on what you said.
1990.90-26,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2318.022,2338.647,"Your Honor, I think that there are... the distinction is that there what the State is concerned about is that the consenting adults in the audience will agree with this message, will follow what they take the message to be and will go out and have bad attitudes about women or commit prostitution, rape, or adultery."
1990.90-26,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2377.611,2388.968,"Mr. Ennis, what language... I've been looking at Baysinger... and I... it really does seem to me that all the Indiana court is saying is responding to an overbreadth argument."
1990.90-26,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2420.64,2424.902,"Your Honor, the opinion has the language you discussed and no more."
1990.90-26,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2437.191,2437.641,"Oh, well."
1990.90-26,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2437.641,2440.973,--not within the statute and nude dancing without artistic content is.
1990.90-26,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2440.973,2443.115,"Well, they shouldn't have described it that way."
1990.90-26,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2443.115,2444.787,Are we to accept--
1990.90-26,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2444.787,2447.738,"No, they should not, but that is the State's justification for the statute."
1990.90-26,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2447.738,2455.442,"--But we are dealing with an Indiana Supreme Court opinion, and I suppose the Indiana Supreme Court can speak for itself and it's not governed by what the attorney general recharacterizes it as."
1990.90-26,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2455.442,2464.559,"Well, certainly for purposes of this case the attorney general has represented what the State's interests are, whether accurately or inaccurately."
1990.90-26,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2550.145,2555.999,"So we could leave... if we agreed with you on your first argument, I suppose, we'd just leave those other issues open?"
1990.90-26,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2555.999,2557.879,"I think that's correct, Your Honor."
1990.90-26,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2577.821,2588.75,"Mr. Ennis, the second question presented in the petition for certiorari is if nude dancing is speech whether Indiana's general public indecent laws are unconstitutional as applied to such dancing."
1990.90-26,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2592.313,2593.102,Well--
1990.90-26,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2593.102,2595.155,Does it or does it not do you think?
1990.90-26,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2595.155,2597.396,"--I think it's a close question, Your Honor, to be quite candid."
1990.90-26,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2597.396,2597.876,Do you think--
1990.90-26,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2597.876,2598.885,If you look at their brief--
1990.90-26,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2598.885,2601.169,"--Well, I'm going to look at the question."
1990.90-26,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2601.169,2605.0,--The question seems... it's ambiguous in my mind.
1990.90-26,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2613.474,2617.628,Did you raise that point in your brief in opposition to certiorari?
1990.90-26,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2617.628,2626.183,"No, the reason it was not raised in opposition is that it was not our understanding that the State had raised that point, since the text of their brief does not argue... Renton does not argue."
1990.90-26,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2626.814,2630.988,"Well, you didn't have the text of the brief before you at the time you filed the brief--"
1990.90-26,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2630.988,2632.46,"--Excuse me, I mean the text of the cert. petition."
1990.90-26,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2652.192,2667.452,"--That might have been a consideration to be brought before us in considering the petition for certiorari, but you know our rule and in our Oklahoma City against Tuttle, anything that's nonjurisdictional that isn't brought up in the brief in opposition is waived by you."
1990.90-26,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2667.452,2677.57,"I know the rule, Your Honor, Rule 15 of this Court says that the Court has discretion to deem it waived if it is not raised in the brief in opposition to the petition."
1990.90-26,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2688.537,2693.038,"Well, you don't think the opinions of the court of appeals are sketchy, do you?"
1990.90-26,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2693.038,2705.787,"No, I don't think the opinions of the court of appeals are sketchy, but we didn't know until the State's main brief in this case what the State interests are to justify regulation of respondents' nude dancing."
1990.90-26,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2910.011,2921.679,"But subject to that time, place, and manner regulation, every community in Indiana would have to have some nude dancing, if an entrepreneur wanted to provide it."
1990.90-26,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2924.862,2926.532,"Yes, Your Honor, I think that's--"
1990.90-26,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2926.532,2927.763,The Constitution requires this.
1990.90-26,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2927.763,2932.136,--I think that's what this... that's what is implicit in the Court's decisions in Miller and Sable.
1990.90-26,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2974.614,2975.535,Miller was not action.
1990.90-26,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2977.985,2986.37,"--Right, but the Court's opinion in Miller I think has been understood to apply to live conduct and performance as well as to literature."
1990.90-26,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3062.419,3064.182,"Thank you, Mr. Ennis."
1990.90-26,2,46440,wayne_e_uhl,,3066.954,3069.866,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.90-26,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3123.632,3134.749,"May I ask you on that, Judge Posner said that both the State's highest court and the law enforcement officials concurred in interpreting the statute, not as a blanket prohibition of public nudity."
1990.90-26,2,46440,wayne_e_uhl,,3142.462,3144.365,For the purposes of our first argument--
1990.90-26,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3144.365,3147.905,"No, you... are going to have to give me alternative argument answers?"
1990.90-26,2,46440,wayne_e_uhl,,3147.905,3149.868,"--Yes, Your Honor, we've made alternative arguments here."
1990.90-26,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3150.629,3154.841,"Have you ever before argued that it's a blanket prohibition of public nudity, including operas and the like?"
1990.90-26,2,46440,wayne_e_uhl,,3154.841,3155.862,"--No, Your Honor."
1990.90-26,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3155.862,3158.114,"So, but you are making that argument now?"
1990.90-26,2,46440,wayne_e_uhl,,3158.114,3158.835,"Yes, Your Honor."
1990.90-26,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3161.416,3166.999,And you believe that your opponent reasonably should have anticipated that argument when he filed his brief in opposition to your cert. petition?
1990.90-26,2,46440,wayne_e_uhl,,3166.999,3178.818,"Yes, Your Honor, because the Seventh Circuit clearly went ahead and addressed that issue and then in our second issue in the cert. petition we clearly raised that issue: whether or not this statute is a valid... the public nudity statute... is a valid--"
1990.90-26,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3178.818,3182.489,"You don't... in your second question, you don't say a word about it being a blanket prohibition of public nudity."
1990.90-26,2,46440,wayne_e_uhl,,3182.489,3184.209,--I don't remember the exact frame--
1990.90-26,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3184.209,3185.702,It certainly doesn't suggest it to me.
1990.90-26,2,46440,wayne_e_uhl,,3185.702,3190.915,"--but I believe it says that whether the statute is a valid regulation, and I believe the text of our cert petition clearly--"
1990.90-26,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3190.915,3193.366,How should I interpret the statute as I face this case?
1990.90-26,2,46440,wayne_e_uhl,,3195.887,3197.269,"--As a blanket prohibition, Your Honor."
1990.90-26,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3300.787,3301.87,"Thank you, Mr. Uhl."
