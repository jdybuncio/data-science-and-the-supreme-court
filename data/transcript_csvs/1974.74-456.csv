1974.74-456,0,32282,john_w_odam,,47.892,50.309,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1974.74-456,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,103.935,107.345,When was that law enacted in its present form?
1974.74-456,0,32282,john_w_odam,,107.345,115.821,"The law was enacted Your Honor in its present form on -- the amendment became effective on June 14, 1973."
1974.74-456,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,115.821,117.588,When was this lawsuit brought?
1974.74-456,0,32282,john_w_odam,,117.588,126.304,"The suit was filed on September 11th 1973 of which time local political races were being conducted in Houston, Texas."
1974.74-456,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,126.304,134.623,Had the secretary of state made any determination or have made any public announcement is to how he construed it or how he proposed to enforce it?
1974.74-456,0,32282,john_w_odam,,134.623,149.563,"No Your Honor, the Texas Secretary of State had not done so, nor had there been any prosecutions initiated or even attempted or even considered to that time as evidence and the record will demonstrate."
1974.74-456,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,149.563,154.237,Haven't statutes of this kind been in effect in other states for many years?
1974.74-456,0,32282,john_w_odam,,154.237,162.441,"Yes Your Honor, there are approximately 33 to 36 states that have similar statutes to the one under consideration by the Court today."
1974.74-456,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,183.872,186.745,As requiring a sponsor to be identified?
1974.74-456,0,32282,john_w_odam,,186.745,188.241,That's correct Your Honor.
1974.74-456,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,188.241,190.959,But only three require the identification of the printer?
1974.74-456,0,32282,john_w_odam,,190.959,194.134,"Yes, Your Honor."
1974.74-456,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,195.589,217.266,This side I suppose among other things enables the reader trace back the material to its source even if the names of the sponsors are either fictitious or meaningless for the readers that part of it?
1974.74-456,0,32282,john_w_odam,,217.266,217.761,Yes Your Honor.
1974.74-456,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,245.655,251.08,"Some of the statutes require the costs also to be indicated, do they not?"
1974.74-456,0,32282,john_w_odam,,251.08,252.124,"Yes sir, yes."
1974.74-456,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,257.656,261.063,Some other -- I don't know what these statutes include them.
1974.74-456,0,32282,john_w_odam,,272.577,273.188,Yes Your Honor.
1974.74-456,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,273.188,275.526,Does Texas have such a statute?
1974.74-456,0,32282,john_w_odam,,275.526,276.974,I don't believe so Your Honor.
1974.74-456,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,276.974,280.879,"But then in any event, if there are, they're independent or separately from the --"
1974.74-456,0,32282,john_w_odam,,280.879,284.387,"That's correct, that's correct."
1974.74-456,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,949.461,952.791,Why does the state need the name of the printer?
1974.74-456,0,32282,john_w_odam,,952.791,956.037,Why does the state need to know the name of the printer?
1974.74-456,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,982.223,995.969,"The man says “my name Joe Doe,” I put Joe Doe on the bottom, that doesn't mean I got a print of what you bring, what somebody else bring, does it?"
1974.74-456,0,32282,john_w_odam,,995.969,996.104,You mean when you --
1974.74-456,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,996.104,1001.163,"You put the name of the printer that's all I'm talking about, why do you need the name of the printer?"
1974.74-456,0,32282,john_w_odam,,1001.163,1011.738,"Your Honor, if the candidate or any person has the name of the printer on the piece of political advertising, he can look to see who made such statement."
1974.74-456,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1017.329,1019.141,You mean it's primitive make the statement?
1974.74-456,0,32282,john_w_odam,,1019.141,1028.144,"No, Your Honor, but the requirements of the statute are that the printer keep at his shop the name of a bent individual that came to him and submitted it for publication."
1974.74-456,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1028.144,1030.077,Which his name is printed too?
1974.74-456,0,32282,john_w_odam,,1030.077,1031.758,That's correct Your Honor but the name that is printed --
1974.74-456,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1031.758,1035.846,"So you get both, you come to them and say is this the name?"
1974.74-456,0,32282,john_w_odam,,1035.846,1042.608,"No, Your Honor, the printer would publish; number one, the name of the person that's paying."
1974.74-456,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1072.426,1075.198,Be there as the name of the man who's name is on that.
1974.74-456,0,32282,john_w_odam,,1076.772,1084.996,"No, Your Honor, under the statute, he's required to have the name of the individual which might not necessarily be the name of the person paying."
1974.74-456,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1084.996,1086.667,Where is that in the statute?
1974.74-456,0,32282,john_w_odam,,1086.667,1091.216,It's in the portion in Article 1410 (b) --
1974.74-456,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1091.216,1092.683,What page?
1974.74-456,0,32282,john_w_odam,,1092.683,1098.032,-- which is at page 66 of the appendix.
1974.74-456,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1098.032,1099.532,Of the jurisdiction?
1974.74-456,0,32282,john_w_odam,,1099.532,1104.728,Appendix to the jurisdictional statement at page 66.
1974.74-456,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1104.728,1112.302,Is this it?
1974.74-456,0,32282,john_w_odam,,1119.919,1132.948,"Page 66, Your Honor."
1974.74-456,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1132.948,1134.656,First sentence of the --
1974.74-456,0,32282,john_w_odam,,1134.656,1136.112,Yes Your Honor.
1974.74-456,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1137.789,1139.318,And then the sign --
1974.74-456,0,32282,john_w_odam,,1139.318,1148.343,Signed by the individual contract and therefore in showing his full address and if his agent name of the candidate political committee within this enterprise.
1974.74-456,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1159.215,1167.225,But it then to prove to have objection of doing the Government's business for them.
1974.74-456,0,32282,john_w_odam,,1178.675,1189.728,"Well, Your Honor, by having the printer do it, it allows the entire public during a political campaign to know who distributed it by knowing who submitted it to the printer."
1974.74-456,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1189.728,1192.384,Did the printer require to show that anybody wants to see it?
1974.74-456,0,32282,john_w_odam,,1192.384,1194.566,"Yes, Your Honor."
1974.74-456,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1194.566,1196.179,[Inaudible]
1974.74-456,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1196.179,1200.374,"You said there were five reasons and that's the first one, what are others?"
1974.74-456,0,32282,john_w_odam,,1200.374,1206.748,The second reason Your Honor is that it allows the voter to be better informed in casting his ballot.
1974.74-456,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1206.748,1213.572,Now how in the world would the name of the printer do that anymore than the name of the secretary who typed the manuscript?
1974.74-456,0,32282,john_w_odam,,1213.572,1222.931,"Your Honor, if you know who the printer is, it allows by knowing who the printer is which ties very closely into the other point to know who submitted the material to be printed."
1974.74-456,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1222.931,1225.978,Well that's the point.
1974.74-456,0,32282,john_w_odam,,1225.978,1229.643,"Well, the first point allows a candidate to reply to whatever it is."
1974.74-456,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1268.128,1272.062,"Not just by looking at, he has to go to the printer's office and get that?"
1974.74-456,0,32282,john_w_odam,,1272.062,1275.523,"That's correct Your Honor, but absent that, he is not able to totally evaluate."
1974.74-456,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1275.523,1280.742,"Alright, so you say those are two points, but a little difficulty, what are the other three then?"
1974.74-456,0,32282,john_w_odam,,1280.742,1291.864,The third point Your Honor is that this disclosure will greatly deter one from attempting a falsely attributed smear as in the Dallas Grady case or in the Insco cases that are discussed in our brief.
1974.74-456,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1317.016,1321.63,It would be track down if they don't put anything they want.
1974.74-456,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1321.63,1323.385,"Well it can't be, that's the point."
1974.74-456,0,32282,john_w_odam,,1323.385,1325.747,That's correct and I'm saying that both names.
1974.74-456,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1325.747,1328.239,"This is automatic, you know."
1974.74-456,0,32282,john_w_odam,,1328.239,1333.216,"No, Your Honor but it allows at least to know who the printer is to go with to find in the first place, not necessarily where the --"
1974.74-456,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1333.216,1338.677,To know these printers and that will print anything for money.
1974.74-456,0,32282,john_w_odam,,1338.677,1339.843,"Well, the point Your Honor --"
1974.74-456,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1339.843,1345.617,"Well the answer is you're not going after them, you'll go after them criminally, and that's your answer, isn't it?"
1974.74-456,0,32282,john_w_odam,,1345.617,1348.542,"Well, other methods would be available."
1974.74-456,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1350.94,1352.039,[Inaudible]
1974.74-456,0,32282,john_w_odam,,1352.039,1358.36,We're talking about going after the candidate or the political committee who intended to have it distributed in the first place.
1974.74-456,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1358.36,1359.741,Alright.
1974.74-456,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1359.741,1360.001,Alright.
1974.74-456,0,32282,john_w_odam,,1377.426,1378.283,That's correct Your Honor.
1974.74-456,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1378.283,1388.909,"And whether it be a member of the public or a candidate or somebody who suspects dirty tricks, that’s really all are the same need in which I fully understand your point and then now what are your --"
1974.74-456,0,32282,john_w_odam,,1388.909,1399.834,The fourth point Your Honor is that it'll greatly assist the officials in checking the accuracy of expenditure required to be reported under other provisions of the Texas Campaign and Disclosure Act.
1974.74-456,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1461.54,1479.509,"So, that the name of the printer is important only because it is tied with the requirements of subsection (b) here on page 26 in that through the printer you can get the sponsors?"
1974.74-456,0,32282,john_w_odam,,1479.509,1480.51,That's correct Your Honor.
1974.74-456,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1480.51,1483.165,And that if it's only important?
1974.74-456,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1483.165,1496.239,"I suppose to the -- under Texas libel and slander law, the printer might be liable in some circumstances for printing something that was grossly and maliciously false, might they not?"
1974.74-456,0,32282,john_w_odam,,1496.239,1504.646,That's correct Your Honor but our purpose in passing the statute is not to enhance necessarily our libel or slander laws.
1974.74-456,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1509.59,1515.987,Nobody but others could turn to the publication of libel or slander --
1974.74-456,0,32282,john_w_odam,,1515.987,1520.937,"Well, I believed Mr. Justice that simply because that there is --"
1974.74-456,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1520.937,1528.065,"Well, no but the idea would be would the printer want to be cautious about whether he agrees to print with his name on it."
1974.74-456,0,32282,john_w_odam,,1528.065,1537.191,I don't believe that is correct Your Honor because we're not only concerned about items would fall as far as being libelous or slanderous but we're talking about in a campaign where a slight difference.
1974.74-456,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1537.191,1549.183,"And I think you don't argue that to deter the publication of libelous and slanderous, the requirement of printing the printer's name on the publication that may assist them, you don't argue with that?"
1974.74-456,0,32282,john_w_odam,,1549.183,1550.189,No Your Honor.
1974.74-456,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1550.189,1562.781,Very wisely.
1974.74-456,0,32282,john_w_odam,,1562.781,1571.134,Your Honor these we submit are the five reasons which all go to the compelling state interest which we feel is indicated here.
1974.74-456,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1634.615,1646.009,"Incidentally, the Texas have on the statutes required comfortable identification of television or commercials, political commercials or radio --"
1974.74-456,0,32282,john_w_odam,,1646.009,1660.963,"Yes, Your Honor but I think that the point on that is that the -- by identifying on a piece of political advertising exactly who the printer is, they are put in actual practical parity with the television station."
1974.74-456,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1662.825,1664.824,How about newspapers advertisements?
1974.74-456,0,32282,john_w_odam,,1667.411,1682.439,"Your Honor, as I recall there is an exemption as put out and this one exception to what Mr. Justice Rehnquist asked me earlier about newspapers that they would not be required since it obviously speaks from slays who is putting it out."
1974.74-456,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1687.138,1696.455,"Well, whether it simply says committee for John Jones, that's all what the newspapers varies and carries, that doesn't tell who paid for the advertisement, does it?"
1974.74-456,0,32282,john_w_odam,,1696.455,1697.813,No Your Honor but the newspaper.
1974.74-456,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1697.813,1699.759,The newspaper have to keep comparable information?
1974.74-456,0,32282,john_w_odam,,1699.759,1700.933,Yes Your Honor.
1974.74-456,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1704.805,1708.591,"No, but they have to keep the same kinds of records the printer has."
1974.74-456,0,32282,john_w_odam,,1708.591,1709.352,That's correct Your Honor.
1974.74-456,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1709.352,1723.836,And I gather that's supposed to monitor as you suggested earlier with compliance with whatever the expenditure laws of the state maybe and also it's possible to find out who in fact is behind the advertising.
1974.74-456,0,32282,john_w_odam,,1723.836,1731.459,That's correct Your Honor and they're covered in Article 1410 (b) under publishers or printers referred to there.
1974.74-456,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1746.028,1747.664,Mr. Birnberg?
1974.74-456,1,25044,gerald_m_birnberg,,1747.664,1752.137,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1974.74-456,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1875.526,1878.544,Why does the printer object to free advertising?
1974.74-456,1,25044,gerald_m_birnberg,,1878.544,1920.572,"The printers object because as you'll note on the record in this case, Mr. Justice Marshall, their experience has been that when individuals see their name and address associated with particular political positions, particular political advertising that that has dire reprisal affects to them, that they have been exposed to various forms of -- as we've got in the record, physical reprisal, property, damage, economic reprisals, and various forms of harassment and so forth, when people identify the printers with supporting by at a very lease not refusing to undertake political advertising."
1974.74-456,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1920.572,1925.999,"9 out of 10 of these briefs here, the printer always puts his name down and he loves to advertise?"
1974.74-456,1,25044,gerald_m_birnberg,,1925.999,1928.727,"Absolutely, Mr. Justice Marshall."
1974.74-456,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1959.327,1962.312,Did that happen to any newspapers in Texas?
1974.74-456,1,25044,gerald_m_birnberg,,1962.312,1964.045,I assume that yes Your Honor.
1974.74-456,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2018.938,2022.234,"Now, we've got to cutout special rules affecting?"
1974.74-456,1,25044,gerald_m_birnberg,,2022.234,2024.497,"I'm sorry, I don't understand your point Mr. Justice."
1974.74-456,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2024.497,2028.377,[Inaudible]
1974.74-456,1,25044,gerald_m_birnberg,,2028.377,2032.64,"Well, in addition of course to republicans Mr. Justice Marshall."
1974.74-456,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2087.82,2089.466,Meaning some code [Inaudible]

1974.74-456,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2093.351,2098.372,"But what they have to do then, they'd be required to register or take it with some --"
1974.74-456,1,25044,gerald_m_birnberg,,2098.372,2101.856,"They could be required, they could choose to register and receive --"
1974.74-456,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2101.856,2103.958,Get number or a button or something?
1974.74-456,1,25044,gerald_m_birnberg,,2103.958,2111.977,"Right and if they chose not to register, not to get that number, they could in that circumstance print the name and address."
1974.74-456,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2135.945,2140.438,Does Texas have a Freedom of Information Act?
1974.74-456,1,25044,gerald_m_birnberg,,2140.438,2143.934,Texas does have a public record statute and --
1974.74-456,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2143.934,2150.836,"One might went off the street and say to the Secretary of the State, we want to know what printer has code number 2341?"
1974.74-456,1,25044,gerald_m_birnberg,,2150.836,2153.84,"Certainly, and there are two alternatives that I think --"
1974.74-456,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2153.84,2155.877,Why is that any less intrusive?
1974.74-456,1,25044,gerald_m_birnberg,,2155.877,2159.113,It's less intrusive for two reasons Mr. Chief Justice.
1974.74-456,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2199.165,2205.94,Do you concede that it's a proper state interest to track down as you put it a piece of scurrilous campaign literature?
1974.74-456,1,25044,gerald_m_birnberg,,2205.94,2208.363,"Oh, I certainly think that that's legitimate state interest."
1974.74-456,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2219.415,2221.879,Your argument is fully on behalf of the printer --
1974.74-456,1,25044,gerald_m_birnberg,,2221.879,2222.006,Yes.
1974.74-456,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2222.006,2231.778,"Do you suggest if there's anything wrong about the Texas requirement that there appear on the advertisement on itself, the name of the person who paid for it?"
1974.74-456,1,25044,gerald_m_birnberg,,2231.778,2237.998,"Except for the vagueness argument Mr. Justice Brennan, we're only assorting the rights of the printers in this particular case."
1974.74-456,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2244.261,2249.631,Does anyone here representing originally party to this?
1974.74-456,1,25044,gerald_m_birnberg,,2249.631,2252.662,There is no such party in this particular lawsuit Mr. Justice Brennan.
1974.74-456,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2277.347,2278.301,Are there such laws?
1974.74-456,1,25044,gerald_m_birnberg,,2278.301,2298.886,"No Mr. Justice Marshall, Texas does not, Texas did have a criminal libel law until January 1, 1974 at which time it was effectively repealed and at this time Texas has no law making it a crime to put out a piece of so called campaign dirty tricks in any form or fashion."
1974.74-456,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2298.886,2306.322,"How would one know where it came from, if you simply got it and it was falsely attributed unless there was some requirement like this?"
1974.74-456,1,25044,gerald_m_birnberg,,2306.322,2310.226,"Well, there are at least two things that I can think of Mr. Justice Rehnquist."
1974.74-456,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2334.689,2336.893,Whether if it showing who the printer was?
1974.74-456,1,25044,gerald_m_birnberg,,2336.893,2339.03,Certainly what the record showing who the printer was and --
1974.74-456,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2339.03,2342.493,Without coded bug or anything else on the material itself?
1974.74-456,1,25044,gerald_m_birnberg,,2342.493,2346.269,Without any coded bug or anything else on the material itself.
1974.74-456,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2376.326,2380.977,[Voice Overlap] subject to the same reprisals that you say your client would be?
1974.74-456,1,25044,gerald_m_birnberg,,2380.977,2381.884,I'm sorry I didn't understand.
1974.74-456,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2381.884,2392.21,If he comes forward voluntarily under the pressure of this alternative system that you urge won't it be subject to the same sort of reprisals that you say your client is under the existing law?
1974.74-456,1,25044,gerald_m_birnberg,,2392.21,2409.347,"Probably that one printer and that one case would be but all of the other printers who had undertaken to do political advertising for various individuals would not be exposed to the great extent, to the devastating extent that we have under the present law."
1974.74-456,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2422.36,2427.875,"Well, I'm a little disturbed by your approach on less restrictiveness."
1974.74-456,1,25044,gerald_m_birnberg,,2433.996,2458.007,"Mr. Justice Blackmun, whenever the legislature has sought to achieve a legitimate state interest in a manner which infringes upon the exercise of First Amendment Rights then the legislature may do that only in the way which is the least restrictive on those rights only in a way which is absolutely necessary in the furtherance of the achievement of that legitimate state interest."
1974.74-456,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2458.007,2465.391,"Of course any imaginative lawyer can always come up with something that's a little less restrictive, would he not?"
1974.74-456,1,25044,gerald_m_birnberg,,2465.391,2473.811,I'm not sure that's necessarily the case because obviously Texas had a lot of imaginative lawyers working on this particular case and I do not suggest --
1974.74-456,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2473.811,2480.093,Isn't that the impossible to achieve standard when you take this position?
1974.74-456,1,25044,gerald_m_birnberg,,2480.093,2481.267,Is it possible to achieve what?
1974.74-456,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2481.267,2483.687,Impossible to achieve.
1974.74-456,1,25044,gerald_m_birnberg,,2483.687,2486.502,Oh I certainly don't think so Mr. Justice Blackmun.
1974.74-456,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2488.756,2492.564,There's never a better way to do it?
1974.74-456,1,25044,gerald_m_birnberg,,2492.564,2494.532,There may always be a better way to do it.
1974.74-456,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2514.234,2526.619,The only thing I guess is that if there were no other possible way of furthering this state end you would have a much weaker case than you now have because there are many other possible ways?
1974.74-456,1,25044,gerald_m_birnberg,,2526.619,2538.238,"Certainly, I would go further than that Mr. Justice Stewart and say if there were no other reasonable way to do it then certainly our position would not be as strong as it is."
1974.74-456,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2545.764,2549.251,Would you argue with the much less intrusive upon your --
1974.74-456,1,25044,gerald_m_birnberg,,2549.251,2550.377,Absolutely Mr. Justice Stewart.
1974.74-456,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2550.377,2566.007,"How would you like to address your friend's argument that the act of printing is if I understood it correctly, the act of printing these documents is conduct since it doesn’t express any ideas of any kind of printer?"
1974.74-456,1,25044,gerald_m_birnberg,,2566.007,2569.487,"Yes, well yes Mr. Chief Justice, there are two ways."
1974.74-456,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2587.711,2597.66,I gather a judge view didn't think with First Amendment Rights in printers as much as First Amendment Rights of those who were responsible for having the --
1974.74-456,1,25044,gerald_m_birnberg,,2597.66,2606.394,"That's certainly true and the result of course Mr. Justice Brennan is still the same that in Mr. Justice Bue's opinion, this law is an unconstitutional infringement on --"
1974.74-456,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2606.394,2609.849,"Yes, but he didn't think the one with First Amendment Rights of the printer?"
1974.74-456,1,25044,gerald_m_birnberg,,2609.849,2612.307,"Of the printers, he certainly did not."
1974.74-456,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2649.364,2656.46,It really is nonetheless the right to print someone else's views anonymously that you're claiming?
1974.74-456,1,25044,gerald_m_birnberg,,2656.46,2666.984,"We are claiming the -- yes Mr. Justice Rehnquist, the right to undertake to print what we choose to print and not to choose what we don’t want to print."
1974.74-456,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2683.389,2692.924,"Well what about the newspaper, what about the federal statute that requires a newspaper, every newspaper, they print the name of the publisher and so forth."
1974.74-456,1,25044,gerald_m_birnberg,,2692.924,2700.377,"Mr. Justice Rehnquist, that's only to the extent that the newspaper desires and chooses to avail itself of second class mailing rights and --"
1974.74-456,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2700.377,2708.596,"No, but Justice Holmes long ago said the government has the right to run a mail service but it doesn't have a right to run in violation of the First Amendment."
1974.74-456,1,25044,gerald_m_birnberg,,2710.219,2724.107,I believe the case that upheld that law is Lewis Publishing Company versus Morgan 1913 case and that's precisely the problem is that Mr. Justice Holme's position was not accepted in that case.
1974.74-456,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2744.862,2749.682,Doesn't that been as followed up by the obscenity cases on the mailing problem?
1974.74-456,1,25044,gerald_m_birnberg,,2749.682,2752.83,I certainly think it has Mr. Chief Justice --
1974.74-456,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2752.83,2754.634,Then your point vanishes?
1974.74-456,1,25044,gerald_m_birnberg,,2754.634,2767.704,"Well, whether the point vanishes, the point is that there's no constitutional, there is no judicial pronouncement of the efficacy of that law that exists and is viable today."
1974.74-456,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2860.361,2862.678,Thank you Mr. Birnberg.
1974.74-456,2,32282,john_w_odam,,2869.304,2871.233,Thank you Your Honor.
1974.74-456,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2873.454,2877.148,What about the alternative methods.
1974.74-456,2,32282,john_w_odam,,2877.148,2882.188,"Your Honor as far as alternative methods are concerned, I believe that --"
1974.74-456,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2882.188,2888.865,Would the state's interest all piled over and be as well served by coded --
1974.74-456,2,32282,john_w_odam,,2888.865,2900.142,Your Honor I would appear to hear what Mr. Birnberg's suggestion would be if the State of Texas will require printers to come and identify themselves before they undertake any type of registration.
1974.74-456,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2942.939,2954.142,I suspect that they have this coding system that we'd be confronted with an argument that this was in affect a disguised licensing of printers?
1974.74-456,2,32282,john_w_odam,,2954.142,2956.052,I'm sure that that would be the case Your Honor.
1974.74-456,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3015.818,3016.522,Thank you gentlemen.
