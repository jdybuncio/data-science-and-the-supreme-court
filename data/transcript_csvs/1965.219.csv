1965.219,0,34922,leon_b_polsky,,12.128,16.024,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1965.219,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,303.466,306.19,"Did it say, “Like all epileptics?”"
1965.219,0,34922,leon_b_polsky,,306.19,306.597,I beg your pardon?
1965.219,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,306.597,310.281,"Does the doctor's script could say, “Like all epileptics?”"
1965.219,0,34922,leon_b_polsky,,310.281,310.9,"Yes, Your Honor."
1965.219,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,347.155,349.553,"Mr. Polsky, may I ask."
1965.219,0,34922,leon_b_polsky,,364.931,365.611,"Right, the --"
1965.219,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,365.611,372.099,"Would this -- would this petitioner -- my question was, could he have the advantage of that new procedure?"
1965.219,0,34922,leon_b_polsky,,372.099,388.291,"First, there is some doubt as to whether or not the new procedure applies to the “criminally insane” because this is a hospital, maintained by the Department of Correction as distinguished from the Department of Mental Hygiene."
1965.219,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,412.857,414.426,Not until then?
1965.219,0,34922,leon_b_polsky,,414.891,421.109,I'm just judging by the usual speed with which administrative agencies in the State of New York operate.
1965.219,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,421.109,425.663,"Well, this -- but isn't this under the supervision of the presiding justice from the appellate --"
1965.219,0,34922,leon_b_polsky,,425.663,426.584,"Yes, Your Honor."
1965.219,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,426.584,438.842,"Or could he not -- it's a question, just reading the statute on the face of it, might appear that presiding justice of the appellate division could require it in the case of this --"
1965.219,0,34922,leon_b_polsky,,438.842,439.288,Oh!
1965.219,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,439.472,440.467,(Inaudible)
1965.219,0,34922,leon_b_polsky,,440.467,446.694,-- he can require but the point is that this new service really provides nothing more.
1965.219,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,480.231,482.565,This isn't going to get him a jury trial or --
1965.219,0,34922,leon_b_polsky,,482.565,483.807,"Oh, that's past."
1965.219,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,483.807,488.998,-- but whether he's insane or this is going to get him a decision on whether he should be in Dannemora --
1965.219,0,34922,leon_b_polsky,,488.998,489.272,That's --
1965.219,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,489.272,490.202,-- compared to some other though.
1965.219,0,34922,leon_b_polsky,,490.202,490.646,No.
1965.219,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,490.646,495.233,Nor even the aid of counsel or of his own experts on whether he should be retained?
1965.219,0,34922,leon_b_polsky,,495.233,495.847,No sir.
1965.219,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,495.847,496.784,"I see, alright."
1965.219,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,497.058,498.213,He will get none of that.
1965.219,0,34922,leon_b_polsky,,498.213,512.115,There is a statement in the State's brief that the service can represent the patient that is just not so -- that is not their function.
1965.219,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,670.858,684.648,"Yes, does the -- I suppose this record does not show what happened with respect to the -- his prior offenses on whether they followed epileptic seizures?"
1965.219,0,34922,leon_b_polsky,,684.648,685.349,"No, Your Honor."
1965.219,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,706.451,707.958,I remember that but I don't know --
1965.219,0,34922,leon_b_polsky,,707.958,710.211,"So, it would be not to be before 1946."
1965.219,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,715.787,716.408,Right.
1965.219,0,34922,leon_b_polsky,,716.408,719.233,The basic -- (Voice Overlap) excuse me sir.
1965.219,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,719.233,728.281,"Second question I want to ask you is, I notice the way you phrase the first question you presented."
1965.219,0,34922,leon_b_polsky,,756.094,759.026,"Well, if I may explain sir."
1965.219,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,811.815,812.528,I thank you.
1965.219,0,34922,leon_b_polsky,,812.528,819.083,I couched it specifically to meet that situation in the record sir.
1965.219,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,893.563,897.22,Does he have a right to counsel at that stage?
1965.219,0,34922,leon_b_polsky,,897.22,906.543,New York has an absolute right to counsel in all proceedings which means the absolute right to retain counsel.
1965.219,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,906.543,916.987,"So that it's conceivable, isn't it, that the question that we have before us is a statutory question not constitutional question?"
1965.219,0,34922,leon_b_polsky,,916.987,919.474,In terms of interpreting New York statute sir?
1965.219,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,919.474,922.87,Yes.
1965.219,0,34922,leon_b_polsky,,922.87,923.972,"Well, New York has interpreted --"
1965.219,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,923.972,927.674,"As I understand it, I'm trying to shorten the time."
1965.219,0,34922,leon_b_polsky,,932.651,933.58,Yes sir.
1965.219,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,933.58,935.689,And then he was committed?
1965.219,0,34922,leon_b_polsky,,935.689,936.416,Yes sir.
1965.219,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,936.416,964.628,"And the -- I'm asking if it isn't possible that what we have here or what New York Court may have had before it was a question as to whether the statute did not guarantee this petitioner the rights that any other person would've had, had he been subject to civil commitment proceedings."
1965.219,0,34922,leon_b_polsky,,983.183,1004.942,"Well, there is only one exposition on this by a higher New York Court in People against Kamisaroff, in 13 New York 2d where the Court does interpret the statute, that is the -- Section 384 of the Correction Law."
1965.219,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1031.474,1032.756,Can I ask you a different question?
1965.219,0,34922,leon_b_polsky,,1032.756,1033.852,Yes sir.
1965.219,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1033.852,1036.906,Is your point too under the Equal Protection Clause?
1965.219,0,34922,leon_b_polsky,,1036.906,1039.48,Yes sir.
1965.219,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1039.48,1044.327,Mr. Lokot.
1965.219,1,16455,anthony_j_lokot,,1044.327,1050.288,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1965.219,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1126.043,1135.785,How about counsel in the civilly committed was -- is there appointment of counsel where the patient is indigent?
1965.219,1,16455,anthony_j_lokot,,1135.785,1137.573,"Is there an appointment of counsel, Your Honor?"
1965.219,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1138.005,1139.918,Where the patient is indigent?
1965.219,1,16455,anthony_j_lokot,,1139.918,1141.041,"No, there is not."
1965.219,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1141.041,1143.583,Although there's a jury trial if he wants it.
1965.219,1,16455,anthony_j_lokot,,1143.583,1147.708,If he -- he can waive a jury trial but he can have one.
1965.219,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1147.708,1148.044,But if he have --
1965.219,1,16455,anthony_j_lokot,,1148.044,1148.674,It's up to the Court --
1965.219,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1148.674,1150.728,"If he can't hire a counsel, he doesn't get one?"
1965.219,1,16455,anthony_j_lokot,,1150.728,1160.17,"He can hire one and it's up the Court's discretion in some cases possibly I suppose when the issues are many and complex, the Court may well assign counsel."
1965.219,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1160.17,1161.264,But it isn't required?
1965.219,1,16455,anthony_j_lokot,,1161.264,1164.716,"It is not required, Your Honor."
1965.219,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1186.019,1189.492,"But then that that's -- excuse me, go ahead."
1965.219,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1189.492,1193.147,I have a little trouble with your defining in this criminally insane.
1965.219,1,16455,anthony_j_lokot,,1213.876,1214.383,Your Honor --
1965.219,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1214.383,1235.242,"And he -- then he served his sentence and it was thereafter that he was committed and the question certainly is as you suggest at the outset does not whether or not the -- not whether he can be held at a hospital if he's insane but how he got there, how he got there, how he was put there as compared to other people who were committed in your state."
1965.219,1,16455,anthony_j_lokot,,1235.242,1243.855,"Well, may I -- that phrase criminally insane is used more among psychiatrists and I checked that very carefully."
1965.219,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1262.303,1263.772,He had just about to serve his sentence.
1965.219,1,16455,anthony_j_lokot,,1263.772,1267.764,"But he -- then when he served, completed the sentence he was no longer an insane criminal."
1965.219,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1278.925,1282.954,Is that it -- is that it for his -- he's categorized as if --
1965.219,1,16455,anthony_j_lokot,,1282.954,1283.636,Criminally insane --
1965.219,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1283.636,1289.112,-- criminally insane because of his past behavior rather than his -- his present potentiality?
1965.219,1,16455,anthony_j_lokot,,1289.112,1297.358,"Well, it's the present, what he has done presently in -- while he's been retained and the potential if they let him out."
1965.219,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1303.696,1323.483,"Well, that's different that to give us such -- is it because he is dangerous or are you suggesting that because he's dangerous or potentially dangerous because of his insanity rather than a conclusion which follows from the fact he has committed 10 crimes before?"
1965.219,1,16455,anthony_j_lokot,,1323.483,1326.327,"Well, the two combined as I pointed out in our brief --"
1965.219,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1326.327,1331.602,"But their -- but the former is essential, is that he has -- that he has to be dangerous currently."
1965.219,1,16455,anthony_j_lokot,,1331.602,1332.603,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1965.219,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1335.556,1344.451,And based on -- based on testimony that he must be dangerous -- testimony of doctors that in their opinion he's dangerous currently.
1965.219,1,16455,anthony_j_lokot,,1344.451,1352.421,"That is correct, Your Honor, that he is dangerous currently and that he is not suitable for transfer to a civilly insane hospital."
1965.219,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1352.421,1358.048,Do you think the record here substance -- substantiates that finding?
1965.219,1,16455,anthony_j_lokot,,1358.048,1359.202,"I believe so, Your Honor."
1965.219,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1359.202,1385.006,"Suppose -- suppose somebody would pick up on the street and the civil commitment proceedings in the State of New York and this type is uniformly without exception testified that he is -- the person was insane and mad, they were confident that unless confined, he would commit violence."
1965.219,1,16455,anthony_j_lokot,,1397.063,1400.434,He was would not then be sent to Dannemora by no means.
1965.219,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1400.434,1412.791,"Well then, you are making your distinction here because as I understand it, one of the problems in this case it's been raised by the petitioner, is that he was held in Dannemora --"
1965.219,1,16455,anthony_j_lokot,,1412.791,1413.628,-- which is a hospital --
1965.219,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1413.628,1428.034,"-- which is for the “criminally insane”, that is to say those people have been convicted by a crime or a charge with the crime and put away before the tracks of record."
1965.219,1,16455,anthony_j_lokot,,1428.034,1433.686,"Your Honor, about half of the patients, almost half of the patients are insane criminals."
1965.219,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1467.504,1496.137,"Well, my point is -- my question to you is that, you get two types of persons who are within that same psychiatric category and they are treated differently in one group that's -- here is someone who's criminally insane and just picked up in the streets, this type is criminally insane in the sense that you described and he gets a jury trial, he may have a right to counsel, right?"
1965.219,1,16455,anthony_j_lokot,,1496.137,1496.203,You mean --
1965.219,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1496.203,1510.599,You picked up the street and committed a crime but this guy said that he is “criminally insane” in the sense that he is a person who in their opinion will bring violence.
1965.219,1,16455,anthony_j_lokot,,1510.599,1515.546,"Under the Mental Hygiene, well yes, he would -- he wouldn't be -- demanded a trial (Voice Overlap) by jury --"
1965.219,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1515.546,1517.226,Then he gets a jury trial?
1965.219,1,16455,anthony_j_lokot,,1517.226,1517.946,He would get a jury trial --
1965.219,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1517.946,1518.841,"Now, you take another fellow --"
1965.219,1,16455,anthony_j_lokot,,1518.841,1520.722,-- because of those specific statutes.
1965.219,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1520.722,1537.078,"Take another fellow who had been in prison and then presumably became insane where certainly have his term as -- it's alleged happened in this case, he's transferred Dannemora, his term expires."
1965.219,1,16455,anthony_j_lokot,,1542.378,1542.555,Well --
1965.219,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1542.555,1547.036,"-- but he asked for a jury trial and he didn't get it, is that right?"
1965.219,1,16455,anthony_j_lokot,,1547.036,1552.438,"No, that -- I'm sorry Your Honor, but perhaps I'm confusing the Court in this respect."
1965.219,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1609.608,1612.34,Do you have an epilepsy hospital in New York?
1965.219,1,16455,anthony_j_lokot,,1612.34,1613.218,I beg your pardon.
1965.219,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1613.218,1618.534,Do you have a hospital for epileptics in New York?
1965.219,1,16455,anthony_j_lokot,,1618.534,1629.253,"There is -- I believe there is one institution devoted to cases of that kind but they are epileptics that, again, are not criminally insane."
1965.219,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1629.253,1642.756,"Well, not criminally insane as a point that you have used, but are not the great many of them dangerous at times after they have passed their seizures as -- it is charged this man was?"
1965.219,1,16455,anthony_j_lokot,,1642.756,1647.58,"The psychiatrist of the State have assured me, no they're not in that great number."
1965.219,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1647.58,1649.049,The epileptics?
1965.219,1,16455,anthony_j_lokot,,1649.049,1651.557,"Dangerous to themselves, primarily."
1965.219,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1651.557,1661.008,"Well, aren't they aggressive and liable to be violent after they come out of these seizures?"
1965.219,1,16455,anthony_j_lokot,,1661.008,1663.11,"I would say yes, many of them would be, yes Your Honor."
1965.219,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1663.11,1679.319,"Many of them would be yes, but why wouldn't this man -- this man who is only said to be slightly aggressive after these seizures of him, why wouldn't he be subject for the same kind of treatment as these other epileptics?"
1965.219,1,16455,anthony_j_lokot,,1679.319,1695.225,"Well, the distinction that the doctors makes us that this record, felonious record, his entire life history of violence is such that you cannot say that he is the average epileptic."
1965.219,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1702.199,1714.967,I suppose all your people whether civilly insane or criminally insane are only placed in restraint because a lot would be dangerous either to themselves or others.
1965.219,1,16455,anthony_j_lokot,,1714.967,1716.552,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1965.219,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1716.552,1731.59,"Well, I don't see how this man differs from those people to the extent that he isn't given the same kind of procedure that they're given before commitment."
1965.219,1,16455,anthony_j_lokot,,1731.59,1743.398,"Well, the right to a jury trial of course is one that can be taken away or granted by statute in the absence of any constitutional guarantee of common law."
1965.219,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1743.398,1748.622,Can you give it to one man and not give it to another man similarly situated?
1965.219,1,16455,anthony_j_lokot,,1748.622,1759.422,"Well, that is my position that he is not similarly situated, not this petitioner in his class that the criminally insane are not similarly situated to the civilly insane."
1965.219,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1760.422,1765.969,That may be true but why is this similarly situated with regard to the jury trial issue?
1965.219,1,16455,anthony_j_lokot,,1771.458,1771.809,"Well, the --"
1965.219,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1771.809,1776.318,-- he'd never had -- never had jury passed upon his insanity?
1965.219,1,16455,anthony_j_lokot,,1776.318,1784.105,"Well, Your Honor, from time in memorial, I suppose that no insane person had a right to a jury trial as a matter of right."
1965.219,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1784.105,1786.794,"That isn't what we're talking about, we're talking about giving it to one -- to another."
1965.219,1,16455,anthony_j_lokot,,1786.794,1787.888,Discriminatory.
1965.219,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1817.909,1843.383,"Well, Mr. Lokot, suppose this very individual had served out his prison term before any symptoms of the mental illness and then he have been released and a year later, the very symptom that developed here showed up but on the street and he was picked up on the street, would he have a jury trial?"
1965.219,1,16455,anthony_j_lokot,,1843.383,1845.204,Yes.
1965.219,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1851.127,1863.585,"So, it's just the accident -- just the accident that this developed while he was serving the prison term, which denies him a jury trial and the right to assistance of counsel?"
1965.219,1,16455,anthony_j_lokot,,1863.585,1870.432,"Well, Your Honor, I -- accident of time possibly that's all."
1965.219,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1870.432,1889.381,So didn't the Court and the doctors and everybody else in this very summary proceeding that they had for this man indicate that he was -- he should be in the civil hospital instead of a criminal hospital?
1965.219,1,16455,anthony_j_lokot,,1889.381,1891.547,I don't believe that that is quite correct.
1965.219,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1938.251,1949.791,"But I thought -- I thought the Court said this, addressing the patient, “You were examined by Doctor Foster on November 27."
1965.219,1,16455,anthony_j_lokot,,2001.328,2006.456,Does Your Honor interpret that as a straight instruction to have him transferred with --
1965.219,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2006.456,2008.256,I like your interpretation of what this is.
1965.219,1,16455,anthony_j_lokot,,2009.961,2037.347,"Well, Your Honor, I interpret that in light of this colloquy about Baltimore and then returning to Baltimore, the entire responsibility of releasing him as the Court pointed out was not the Court's, that was the responsibility of the Department of Mental Hygiene depending upon their findings or whether or not this man was still dangerous and should not be let out."
1965.219,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2037.347,2039.655,Then why was he found to be dangerous?
1965.219,1,16455,anthony_j_lokot,,2044.456,2045.424,Extremely violent.
1965.219,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2082.114,2083.092,It caused what?
1965.219,1,16455,anthony_j_lokot,,2083.092,2087.364,Near riots among the patients themselves.
1965.219,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2108.387,2115.615,You say the nature of his violence is not in our records?
1965.219,1,16455,anthony_j_lokot,,2115.615,2116.411,In the record?
1965.219,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2137.155,2140.767,Did he say that he had been assaulting people?
1965.219,1,16455,anthony_j_lokot,,2140.767,2141.877,"Yes, Your Honor."
1965.219,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2141.877,2147.219,Is that in the record?
1965.219,1,16455,anthony_j_lokot,,2147.219,2155.963,"Only in these hearings where Doctor Kerr said, his record indicates that he becomes confused and he's liable to have assaultive tendencies."
1965.219,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2155.963,2156.96,He's liable to --
1965.219,1,16455,anthony_j_lokot,,2156.96,2159.706,"Yes, Your Honor."
1965.219,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2159.706,2163.992,Does it show any actual assaults or attempt to assault people?
1965.219,1,16455,anthony_j_lokot,,2163.992,2165.348,"Well, his record does, yes."
1965.219,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2165.348,2170.471,"No, I said this record, the record we deal with."
1965.219,1,16455,anthony_j_lokot,,2170.471,2177.279,I can't say that there is that actually in plain black and white but --
1965.219,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2177.279,2183.618,"Evidently, what this record shows is what the doctors thought about him and the diagnoses they had."
1965.219,1,16455,anthony_j_lokot,,2183.618,2185.785,"They read from the records themselves, that is the daily records (Voice Overlap) --"
1965.219,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2185.785,2189.419,"But after reading the record, but we do not have available to us?"
1965.219,1,16455,anthony_j_lokot,,2189.419,2189.887,That is correct sir.
1965.219,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2189.887,2196.174,"The record showing, actual occurrences on which the doctor based that conclusion?"
1965.219,1,16455,anthony_j_lokot,,2196.174,2199.506,"Your Honor, that is not included in the record -- made up by the other --"
1965.219,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2199.506,2218.391,"Mr. Lokot, can you tell me why it was -- Judge Sweeney as I understand it in the first habeas hearing ordered petitioner's transfer to a civil institution and that was not done and then on the second Judge Sutton was it, said, “Well, that was an administrative matter and this Court could do nothing about it.”"
1965.219,1,16455,anthony_j_lokot,,2224.297,2226.334,Judge Sweeney never issued an order for his transfer.
1965.219,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2226.334,2227.283,Not an order?
1965.219,1,16455,anthony_j_lokot,,2227.283,2227.571,"No, no."
1965.219,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2227.571,2228.994,What was it?
1965.219,1,16455,anthony_j_lokot,,2228.994,2237.315,"His order actually -- excuse me Your Honor, but his order actually ordered his retention in Dannemora State Hospital."
1965.219,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2238.332,2244.931,Wasn't his order to commit him to the Mental Health Commissioner?
1965.219,1,16455,anthony_j_lokot,,2244.931,2255.799,"By statute when the sentence expires, the patient is automatically transferred to the custody of the Mental Hygiene Commissioner."
1965.219,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2258.793,2262.509,"Oh no, I gather it was only a claim on petitioner's part."
1965.219,1,16455,anthony_j_lokot,,2262.509,2262.864,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1965.219,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2262.864,2264.388,That Judge Sweeney had an order (Voice Overlap).
1965.219,1,16455,anthony_j_lokot,,2264.388,2266.04,"Yes, but that is -- that is --"
1965.219,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2266.04,2267.333,No actual order?
1965.219,1,16455,anthony_j_lokot,,2267.333,2268.535,That's not entirely true.
1965.219,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2268.535,2269.596,I'm sorry.
1965.219,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2269.596,2300.417,"Are we justified in concluding from this record that under the law which is under psychiatric, what State of New York does is to create one classification for a man or woman who has been in jail and convicted and another classification for those who have not been in jail and convicted so that the one who has been in jail is out is denied the right to a lawyer and denied the right to trial by a jury while the others are?"
1965.219,1,16455,anthony_j_lokot,,2300.417,2302.979,"Your Honor, will you say he's out, you mean out in the streets?"
1965.219,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2302.979,2306.81,Yes.
1965.219,1,16455,anthony_j_lokot,,2306.81,2312.235,"That man out on the streets when he's picked up, he certainly may have a jury trial."
1965.219,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2312.235,2313.175,A jury?
1965.219,1,16455,anthony_j_lokot,,2313.175,2314.004,Yes I have to concede that.
1965.219,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2314.004,2315.628,Even though he's been in jail?
1965.219,1,16455,anthony_j_lokot,,2315.628,2316.421,That is correct.
1965.219,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2316.421,2318.75,Even though he's been convicted?
1965.219,1,16455,anthony_j_lokot,,2318.75,2320.028,"A former convict, in other words."
1965.219,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2320.028,2320.993,A former convict?
1965.219,1,16455,anthony_j_lokot,,2320.993,2321.306,Yes.
1965.219,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2321.306,2323.674,You do not classify on that word?
1965.219,1,16455,anthony_j_lokot,,2323.674,2325.921,You may -- he may have a jury trial.
1965.219,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2325.921,2340.718,"Well then, it's not correct that New York has a classification, which treats them wholly differently, to treat those wholly differently who have ex-convicts from those who were not."
1965.219,1,16455,anthony_j_lokot,,2340.718,2373.147,"Well, that New York recently repeal the statute which came up through the federal courts in McNeill case in which that precise point was raised that the statute provided for incarceration of a former convict being picked up as you have described and being placed in Matteawan State Hospital for the insane on the basis of fact that he had a previous criminal record and was dangerous."
1965.219,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2380.099,2383.199,Because he was an ex-convict?

1965.219,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2387.688,2400.412,But you don't suggest that the fellows currently in prison and whom the administrator of the prison finds to be insane?

1965.219,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2419.091,2421.066,As to the kind of hearing they get?
1965.219,1,16455,anthony_j_lokot,,2421.066,2422.453,Yes.
1965.219,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2423.001,2429.404,What kind of a hearing do they get when they're in jail like this man was?
1965.219,1,16455,anthony_j_lokot,,2429.404,2430.272,We give --
1965.219,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2430.272,2430.34,Under some (Voice Overlap) hearing --
1965.219,1,16455,anthony_j_lokot,,2430.34,2432.979,We give them a hearing before court of record.
1965.219,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2432.979,2433.392,Yes.
1965.219,1,16455,anthony_j_lokot,,2433.392,2463.749,"And as a matter of fact, what happens is that usually it's the Supreme Court judge or the county judge or surrogate filling in for especial term and he has a judicial hearing wherein the -- he has to be there personally and the Court assigns two psychiatrists on examining physicians to examine him before the hearing and to file a report with the Court at the hearing --"
1965.219,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2463.749,2468.742,"Well, this takes place where a fellow is still in prison or this only takes place when he's --"

1965.219,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2481.606,2484.139,Whether those terms expired or not?
1965.219,1,16455,anthony_j_lokot,,2484.139,2486.322,"That's before his term expires, yes."
1965.219,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2487.479,2489.821,Immediately after his transfer?
1965.219,1,16455,anthony_j_lokot,,2489.821,2493.425,Before he is transferred -- he's not transferred without this judicial hearing.
1965.219,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2493.425,2494.672,"Well, excuse me, Mr. Lokot."
1965.219,1,16455,anthony_j_lokot,,2523.706,2542.259,"Well, in this specific instance, as I remember, he was transferred from prison to the hospital about four months or five months -- as a matter of fact, almost six months before the expiration of his term and he was certified as insane --"
1965.219,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2542.259,2550.47,"Yes, but did he have any kind of proceeding -- preceding that transfer except some administrative of proceeding in the prison?"
1965.219,1,16455,anthony_j_lokot,,2550.47,2564.461,I believe he had a proceeding judicial hearing under the old Section 383 which was subsequently amended or repealed and substituted by --

1965.219,1,16455,anthony_j_lokot,,2670.66,2677.396,"Well, we're talking now about 383, the old 383."

1965.219,1,16455,anthony_j_lokot,,2684.234,2690.737,"Well, that proceeding was at just before -- it was initiated just before his sentence expired."
1965.219,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2706.742,2713.919,But your allegation -- I mean your suggesting is that he was also given an earlier hearing five or six months before that?
1965.219,1,16455,anthony_j_lokot,,2713.919,2718.833,"My recollection is although this was not placed an issue, his initial transfer from prison."
1965.219,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2718.833,2727.037,"But you say the normal practice is you have a hearing when someone is misheard, like this fellow was, while he was in prison."

1965.219,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2728.234,2732.637,And not to throw away the hearing until his term expires.

1965.219,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2852.65,2856.994,"But he get this trial before the Court, is that right?"
1965.219,1,16455,anthony_j_lokot,,2856.994,2858.001,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1965.219,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2858.001,2897.015,"But here's what the Court said, at that particular time, right before the -- right before the end, “The question before me today Baxstrom is only what the doctors who are at the hospital and the doctors I set have to examine you, believe your mental condition to be whether you stay at the Dannemora State Hospital or whether you are transferred to some other civil hospital at or near your home is entirely up to the Department of Mental Hygiene and that has nothing to do with Doctor Herold or myself”."
1965.219,1,16455,anthony_j_lokot,,2907.814,2912.161,"Well, I can only go reading between the lines of that statement there by the Court."
1965.219,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,2943.977,2946.182,"He asked for transfer, hadn't he?"
1965.219,1,16455,anthony_j_lokot,,2946.182,2947.199,"He asked, yes."
1965.219,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,2947.199,2951.03,"That's why he went in there, I suppose."
1965.219,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2951.03,2953.383,Mr. Polsky.
1965.219,2,34922,leon_b_polsky,,2953.383,2959.178,"Mr. Chief Justice, I would like to clarify this question of the procedure in New York."
1965.219,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2991.212,2992.25,"Now, 383 --"
1965.219,2,34922,leon_b_polsky,,2992.25,2994.042,That's 383 that I'm talking about.
1965.219,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2994.042,2994.693,You mean at that time?
1965.219,2,34922,leon_b_polsky,,2994.693,2996.209,In 1961.
1965.219,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2996.209,3000.517,"Well, the 383 that's in the record, isn't it?"
1965.219,2,34922,leon_b_polsky,,3013.383,3016.553,"That is not the present 383, and that is not the 383 --"
1965.219,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3016.553,3017.799,-- that was in effect at that time?
1965.219,2,34922,leon_b_polsky,,3017.799,3018.895,At that time.
1965.219,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3018.895,3019.516,I see.
1965.219,2,34922,leon_b_polsky,,3019.516,3023.888,There was no court order in (Voice Overlap) --
1965.219,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3023.888,3025.621,Well that (Voice Overlap)
1965.219,2,34922,leon_b_polsky,,3025.621,3028.352,Excuse me.
1965.219,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3028.352,3046.994,"The -- when 384 was invoked, I'm looking at page 2 of the record, the doctor -- director of Dannemora in the petition said that petition -- that the patient was admitted there on June 1, 1961 from Attica Prison."
1965.219,2,34922,leon_b_polsky,,3047.934,3048.131,Right.
1965.219,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3048.131,3050.058,It says how or why or otherwise.
1965.219,2,34922,leon_b_polsky,,3050.058,3050.646,Right.
1965.219,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3050.646,3059.58,"But later on, there's another record which says he was transferred to Dannemora pursuant to procedures required by law, that's all."
1965.219,2,34922,leon_b_polsky,,3059.58,3063.836,"Which was the -- at that time, was the certificate of the warden."
1965.219,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3081.886,3083.031,I see.
1965.219,2,34922,leon_b_polsky,,3083.031,3092.794,Then he is in the status of a prisoner patient at Dannemora being held under 383.
1965.219,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3195.194,3196.796,"Now, is that a judicial proceeding?"
1965.219,2,34922,leon_b_polsky,,3196.796,3197.592,"Yes, Your Honor, it is."
1965.219,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3197.592,3202.123,Does he have a right to counsel at that one?
1965.219,2,34922,leon_b_polsky,,3202.123,3202.174,I would say --
1965.219,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3202.174,3204.968,"Well, let me ask does the statute say that he does or doesn't."
1965.219,2,34922,leon_b_polsky,,3204.968,3216.244,"The statute says he may have counsel, the Second Circuit in the Carroll case where they held a portion of a related statute unconstitutional assumed that he would have counsel."
1965.219,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3216.244,3216.556,How about jury trial?
1965.219,2,34922,leon_b_polsky,,3216.556,3218.088,The answer is he doesn't.
1965.219,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3218.088,3220.206,How about jury trial?
1965.219,2,34922,leon_b_polsky,,3220.206,3226.386,"On the issue of the whether he is uniquely dangerous, no he's not entitled to a jury trial."
1965.219,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3229.315,3230.077,At that stage?
1965.219,2,34922,leon_b_polsky,,3230.077,3232.039,-- on the question of unique danger.
1965.219,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3232.039,3232.249,Yes.
1965.219,2,34922,leon_b_polsky,,3232.249,3241.724,We claim the right to a jury trial on a general question of insanity to which all other persons in the State of New York are entitled.
1965.219,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3260.599,3281.142,"Well, Mr. Lokot, I can see that I understood that had this petitioner not developed this ailment until after he'd served his prison terms, and then going to pick up on the street, everything you'd said about civil commitment would have follow then clearly, confinement initially in the civil rather than in institutional like Dannemora, is that right?"
1965.219,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3281.142,3292.164,And does the New York right to jury trial apply when you -- once before been committed that you can release as cured and then --
1965.219,2,34922,leon_b_polsky,,3292.164,3293.324,Yes it does.
1965.219,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3306.437,3314.711,You don't -- you don't suggest that a jury should second guess the Mental Health Commissioner on type of the institution on which you --
1965.219,2,34922,leon_b_polsky,,3314.711,3315.269,No.
1965.219,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3315.269,3316.412,-- unless it should be --
1965.219,2,34922,leon_b_polsky,,3316.412,3319.267,"No, I do not."
1965.219,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3324.146,3325.052,Yes.
1965.219,2,34922,leon_b_polsky,,3325.052,3325.884,"Thank you, sir."
1965.219,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3325.884,3349.102,"Mr. Polsky, on behalf of the Court, I would like to express our appreciation to you for responding to our urging that you represent this man who was unrepresented into this -- this dilemma, we feel that that's a great public service and it's greatly appreciated sir."
1965.219,2,34922,leon_b_polsky,,3349.102,3349.734,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1965.219,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3349.734,3356.651,"And Mr. Lokot, we appreciate of course your representation of the interest of people of New York."
1965.219,3,16455,anthony_j_lokot,,3356.651,3366.471,"Thank you, Your Honor."
