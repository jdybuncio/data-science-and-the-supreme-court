1974.73-5768,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,12.285,"We’ll hear arguments first in number 73-5768, Francisco against Gathright."
1974.73-5768,0,21087,daniel_c_kaufman,,14.885,17.541,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1974.73-5768,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,69.812,82.531,"Do I read the record correctly that the district -- the state court by whatever names it’s known here, the state court had indicated readiness to grant a new trial?"
1974.73-5768,0,21087,daniel_c_kaufman,,82.531,84.141,"No Your Honor, not at all."
1974.73-5768,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,206.185,210.048,"Mr. Kaufman, is Mr. Francisco -- where is he now?"
1974.73-5768,0,21087,daniel_c_kaufman,,210.048,213.271,"He is still at Bland Correctional Farm, Southwestern Virginia."
1974.73-5768,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,213.271,220.186,"If he had gone here, might not the whole thing have been resolved by this time, he won’t have to be in jail?"
1974.73-5768,0,21087,daniel_c_kaufman,,220.186,222.093,"I don’t believe so, Your Honor."
1974.73-5768,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,232.18,242.128,"Yes, but if a man’s liberty is at stake in (Inaudible) and after all you can judge a no (Inaudible) if you like to take it from that?"
1974.73-5768,0,21087,daniel_c_kaufman,,242.128,253.747,"He indicated that that we could return if the state did refuse to consider it, but I think we have to look at the totality of the case and there was a search and seizure issue also presented."
1974.73-5768,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,254.504,259.909,I was just wondering if you aren't misdemeaning a man’s freedom is just for very nice people period?
1974.73-5768,0,21087,daniel_c_kaufman,,259.909,261.664,"No, I don’t think so at all."
1974.73-5768,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,299.244,305.154,"If you win here, wouldn’t the state have a right to retry?"
1974.73-5768,0,21087,daniel_c_kaufman,,305.154,312.147,"Your Honor, Mr. Justice Marshall, I think what we’re asking for is a decision on search and seizure, and the instruction issue."
1974.73-5768,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,327.322,338.358,Assuming that it went through the state court could not the District Court still have held it?
1974.73-5768,0,21087,daniel_c_kaufman,,338.358,340.957,I'm sorry Mr. Justice Marshall I don’t quite understand your question.
1974.73-5768,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,340.957,346.074,"If you're going back in the state court, how would that a prejudice to federal court proceeding?"
1974.73-5768,0,21087,daniel_c_kaufman,,346.074,364.299,"Well, as the Court of Appeals below did they vacated that part of the decision of District Court which ruled on a search and seizure issue and said that the federal courts should stay their hands entirely on that issue until the full gambit of the state court proceeding is on its course."
1974.73-5768,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,364.299,371.743,"I'm not talking about that, I'm saying when the state court matter was attempted to be opened up?"
1974.73-5768,0,21087,daniel_c_kaufman,,371.743,372.804,Yes.
1974.73-5768,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,372.804,382.277,"And you were going to the state court and had lost, would you been any worse off than you are now?"
1974.73-5768,0,21087,daniel_c_kaufman,,382.277,383.856,"We would not be any worse off, we would --"
1974.73-5768,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,383.856,391.28,"And on the other hand if you've gone to state court and won, you would’ve been better off than you are now?"
1974.73-5768,0,21087,daniel_c_kaufman,,391.28,393.207,I beg to disagree for the --
1974.73-5768,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,393.207,393.642,Alright.
1974.73-5768,0,21087,daniel_c_kaufman,,396.603,397.842,I understand that.
1974.73-5768,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,397.842,403.935,"And the man was turned loose, wouldn’t you be better off than you are now?"
1974.73-5768,0,21087,daniel_c_kaufman,,403.935,408.874,Not to the extent that he faced retrial and the risk of an increase sentence upon that retrial since --
1974.73-5768,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,408.874,411.275,I said he was turned loose.
1974.73-5768,0,21087,daniel_c_kaufman,,411.275,412.676,"Unequivocally, and was not retried?"
1974.73-5768,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,412.676,415.117,Yes.
1974.73-5768,0,21087,daniel_c_kaufman,,415.117,416.182,Then you're plainly correct.
1974.73-5768,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,416.182,418.565,It might be better off.
1974.73-5768,0,21087,daniel_c_kaufman,,420.754,421.72,Because I think it’s --
1974.73-5768,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,421.72,424.717,Because you didn’t think he could win?
1974.73-5768,0,21087,daniel_c_kaufman,,424.717,434.255,"No, I did not think that I could prevail on the instruction issue and for that reason alone have the state declined to prosecute him further."
1974.73-5768,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,446.721,450.082,And the state court had already rejected your search and seizure issue?
1974.73-5768,0,21087,daniel_c_kaufman,,450.082,451.86,Exactly.
1974.73-5768,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,517.613,524.387,"Mr. Kaufman, do you read the Sharp case from the Supreme Court of Virginia as turning on state or federal constitutional consideration?"
1974.73-5768,0,21087,daniel_c_kaufman,,524.387,526.027,Both Mr. Justice Rehnquist.
1974.73-5768,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,590.776,597.374,Was Roberts cited to the District Court and the Fourth Circuit?
1974.73-5768,0,21087,daniel_c_kaufman,,597.374,614.688,"Your Honor, it was cited to the District Court in my motion to stay proceedings which appears in the appendix at 43."
1974.73-5768,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,646.38,652.373,"Incidentally, was the federal habeas petition filed after Sharp was decided or before?"
1974.73-5768,0,21087,daniel_c_kaufman,,652.373,660.034,The federal habeas petition was formally filed after the Sharp case was decided.
1974.73-5768,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,706.799,712.402,"But nevertheless, the decision was made to go into federal court rather than a state form?"
1974.73-5768,0,21087,daniel_c_kaufman,,712.402,730.633,"Frankly, Your Honor I was not aware of the existence of the Sharp decision until some two weeks later when it finally made its way into the informal legal press and then it was not formally reported in the Southeast Reporter until some months later."
1974.73-5768,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,802.573,807.781,What if the Court of Appeals had ruled exactly the same way that District Court had?
1974.73-5768,0,21087,daniel_c_kaufman,,820.544,834.202,"No, I don’t think that that’s the proper course to take for the basic reason that the search and seizure issue is as a matter of practicality dispositive of a retrial."
1974.73-5768,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,875.927,887.366,"What if you make both a Miranda claim in the search and seizure claim and your federal habeas petition, is it your position that the District Court must pass on the merits of both them if exhaustion is present?"
1974.73-5768,0,21087,daniel_c_kaufman,,887.366,906.654,"Well, I would first say that I believe as a matter of judicial economy and the fundamental nature of the habeas corpus writ that a court should always pass on all issues presented to it and right for adjudication because they will in many instances control a retrial."
1974.73-5768,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,974.456,985.729,"But conceivably on a retrial the state court might hold the factual hearing again on the search and seizure thing that might be adequate under the 1966 revisions to Habeas Corpus Act, might that?"
1974.73-5768,0,21087,daniel_c_kaufman,,985.729,997.247,It might well be but it might also be that the state court would say that the prior decision on a prior motion to suppress is the law of the case.
1974.73-5768,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1214.14,1219.786,"Very well, Mr. Kaufman."
1974.73-5768,1,40447,robert_e_shepherd_jr,,1221.223,1225.714,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1974.73-5768,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1382.901,1385.02,Was this a writ of error denied case in (Voice Overlap)?
1974.73-5768,1,40447,robert_e_shepherd_jr,,1385.02,1388.871,"Yes, it was."
1974.73-5768,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1424.468,1427.93,A state law and that is state constitutional?
1974.73-5768,1,40447,robert_e_shepherd_jr,,1427.93,1443.906,"State constitutional law as to vagueness -- the Court does not specifically delineate where it’s basing its decision on federal constitutional law and where on state constitutional law but it is clearly dealing with the issue on a mixed basis, Mr. Justice Brennan."
1974.73-5768,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1443.906,1444.816,On both grounds?
1974.73-5768,1,40447,robert_e_shepherd_jr,,1444.816,1448.467,"Yes sir, Your Honor."
1974.73-5768,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1738.442,1747.916,"Are you going to make this the law of the case or raise it, what you are going to do with when you drag a man in the courtroom?"
1974.73-5768,1,40447,robert_e_shepherd_jr,,1747.916,1753.861,Do you mean as to the instructional issue as to whether we would make to lower the case that there has been a deliberate bypass?
1974.73-5768,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1753.861,1757.921,"Would you try to, how could you?"
1974.73-5768,1,40447,robert_e_shepherd_jr,,1757.921,1758.81,"Well, I think the issue would have --"
1974.73-5768,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1758.81,1764.55,"Mr. Kaufman and the petitioner didn’t come there voluntarily, didn’t he?"
1974.73-5768,1,40447,robert_e_shepherd_jr,,1764.55,1772.478,"Well, they didn’t come in there voluntarily in the sense that they did not initiate the proceeding."
1974.73-5768,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1773.126,1774.415,They objected to the proceeding.
1974.73-5768,1,40447,robert_e_shepherd_jr,,1774.415,1775.87,"They objected to the proceeding, that’s correct."
1974.73-5768,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1775.87,1779.839,How could they be bound by it?
1974.73-5768,1,40447,robert_e_shepherd_jr,,1783.146,1787.654,I'm not sure that they technically submitted to the jurisdiction of the court.
1974.73-5768,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1787.654,1789.286,Did they file anything?
1974.73-5768,1,40447,robert_e_shepherd_jr,,1789.286,1791.753,They filed nothing.
1974.73-5768,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1791.753,1794.749,How do you get jurisdiction of it?
1974.73-5768,1,40447,robert_e_shepherd_jr,,1794.749,1798.866,"Well, of course we have that question in the first instance as to why the burden --"
1974.73-5768,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1798.866,1800.095,All I'm saying is I’m --
1974.73-5768,1,40447,robert_e_shepherd_jr,,1800.095,1800.649,Why the burden was placed on us.
1974.73-5768,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1800.649,1803.183,(Voice Overlap) I got this all.
1974.73-5768,1,40447,robert_e_shepherd_jr,,1803.183,1818.48,"Right, and of course we felt to that procedure was not the appropriate one but nevertheless we proceeded on the basis of what we have been directed to do by the federal District Court judge."
1974.73-5768,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1868.057,1876.255,"Are you -- you're suggesting or you say there's an argument, it could be made that there's a deliberate bypass of the instructional issue?"
1974.73-5768,1,40447,robert_e_shepherd_jr,,1876.255,1877.287,That’s correct.
1974.73-5768,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1877.287,1887.109,In the sense that the defendant is going forward and would be precluded by deliberate bypass or many remedy in the state court?
1974.73-5768,1,40447,robert_e_shepherd_jr,,1887.109,1887.749,I think that's an argument --
1974.73-5768,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1887.749,1897.084,Do you think -- in which event of the Court of Appeals clearly would be -- would have been wrong not to reach the Fourth Amendment issue?
1974.73-5768,1,40447,robert_e_shepherd_jr,,1897.084,1901.848,"Mr. Justice White, I am not completely sure that's Fourth Circuit was even aware."
1974.73-5768,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1901.848,1907.065,Assume there was a deliberate bypass that means there would be no remedy available in the state court?
1974.73-5768,1,40447,robert_e_shepherd_jr,,1907.065,1907.86,That’s correct.
1974.73-5768,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1907.86,1911.614,In which event the Fourth Amendment issue is squarely on the table?
1974.73-5768,1,40447,robert_e_shepherd_jr,,1911.614,1912.602,Probably so and of course that --
1974.73-5768,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1912.602,1914.153,"Probably it would be, wouldn’t it?"
1974.73-5768,1,40447,robert_e_shepherd_jr,,1914.153,1916.553,"That’s correct, but I don’t think --"
1974.73-5768,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1916.553,1918.178,Do you think you make deliberate bypass in that argument?
1974.73-5768,1,40447,robert_e_shepherd_jr,,1918.178,1923.471,"Well, I don’t think that question was squarely before the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit."
1974.73-5768,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1923.471,1927.898,Are you putting it before us?
1974.73-5768,1,40447,robert_e_shepherd_jr,,1927.898,1929.741,"No, not really at this point because I think --"
1974.73-5768,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1929.741,1930.821,I think you would.
1974.73-5768,1,40447,robert_e_shepherd_jr,,1930.821,1936.061,I think this Court has to probably deal with the issues as they were before the Fourth Circuit.
1974.73-5768,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1942.091,1943.21,In the state court.
1974.73-5768,1,40447,robert_e_shepherd_jr,,1943.21,1947.672,"In the state court ultimately, initially and perhaps ultimately in the federal court."
1974.73-5768,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1947.672,1964.262,"Well, if the defendant is going to face that kind of argument from you in the state court which apparently he is at least that’s another argument for having a ruling in the federal court on the search and seizure?"
1974.73-5768,1,40447,robert_e_shepherd_jr,,1964.262,1981.815,"Well, of course then we get into the question procedural sequencing you know it appears to me that the federal courts would have to deal with the question of exhaustion including the deliberate bypass argument before they could deal properly with the search and seizure question."
1974.73-5768,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1981.815,1986.362,"Well, nobody could ever have to deal with it unless you raised it."
1974.73-5768,1,40447,robert_e_shepherd_jr,,1986.362,1990.902,"Well, that’s correct and I certainly would not want to waive that position at this point."
1974.73-5768,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1990.902,1994.145,But nevertheless argue he must go back and face it.
1974.73-5768,1,40447,robert_e_shepherd_jr,,1994.145,1996.519,"I think that's right, I think he has to go back and face the question."
1974.73-5768,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1996.519,1999.767,But then he can come back to court on the search and seizure issue?
1974.73-5768,1,40447,robert_e_shepherd_jr,,1999.767,2007.583,It was certainly a procedural decision that he had to make at the time of that hearing and the Circuit Court in Fairfax County.
1974.73-5768,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2083.585,2087.594,What about Roberts against LaVallee?
1974.73-5768,1,40447,robert_e_shepherd_jr,,2087.594,2116.635,"Mr. Justice Marshall, we feel that Roberts against LaVallee is perhaps a decision of somewhat narrower boundaries than this decision the issue involved in Roberts was whether the petitioner in that case as an indigent was entitled to a free transcript of the preliminary hearing just as a pecunious defendant would have been."
1974.73-5768,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2160.478,2167.199,"Well, in this case that he was entitled to another instruction, he would be retried?"
1974.73-5768,1,40447,robert_e_shepherd_jr,,2167.199,2168.493,That’s correct.
1974.73-5768,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2168.493,2174.439,And the same evidence would be used?
1974.73-5768,1,40447,robert_e_shepherd_jr,,2174.439,2175.92,I assume unless the state court (Voice Overlap).
1974.73-5768,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2175.92,2177.719,What kind of fundamental is that?
1974.73-5768,1,40447,robert_e_shepherd_jr,,2177.719,2180.354,Unless the state court were to make a new determinant.
1974.73-5768,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2180.354,2180.612,Right.
1974.73-5768,1,40447,robert_e_shepherd_jr,,2184.434,2196.504,That’s correct and I think Mr. Kaufman is correct and that the state courts would not re-adjudicate the search and seizure issue after the Supreme Court of Virginia denied a writ of error.
1974.73-5768,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2196.504,2202.141,"Well, is that log like Roberts?"
1974.73-5768,1,40447,robert_e_shepherd_jr,,2202.141,2231.165,"Well, the results maybe the same, the court really did not address all of the issue in Roberts -- I don’t believe the case was -- I'm not sure with the case was brief and argued it was a per curiam decision that petition for writ of certiorari appear to have been --"
1974.73-5768,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2231.165,2233.635,(Inaudible)
1974.73-5768,1,40447,robert_e_shepherd_jr,,2233.635,2245.099,It was a per curiam opinion that dealt fairly narrowly with the issue as to the availability of the transcript and the right to access to the transcript.
1974.73-5768,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2253.211,2254.787,"Well, they did say though."
1974.73-5768,1,40447,robert_e_shepherd_jr,,2267.2,2276.679,I think the problem we have here of course is that the resolution of that question was somewhat dispositive in that case procedurally.
1974.73-5768,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2342.969,2347.673,"Mr. Shepherd, you were right with that argument."
1974.73-5768,1,40447,robert_e_shepherd_jr,,2351.898,2357.483,That was my impression Mr. Justice Marshall because I feel that the court has in the last few years --
1974.73-5768,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2357.483,2360.501,"You don’t try to get too much out of that, do you?"
1974.73-5768,1,40447,robert_e_shepherd_jr,,2360.501,2361.268,Sir?
1974.73-5768,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2361.268,2363.379,"You don’t try to get too much out of that, do you?"
1974.73-5768,1,40447,robert_e_shepherd_jr,,2363.379,2364.695,I don’t try and get an awful out of that.
1974.73-5768,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2364.695,2366.969,There was an opinion and a dissenting opinion.
1974.73-5768,1,40447,robert_e_shepherd_jr,,2366.969,2382.235,"Although, I think the Court has been inclined in the last few years to deal with some of the procedural aspects of federal habeas corpus and a good deal more detail than it had during the period in which the Roberts case was decided."
1974.73-5768,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2382.235,2384.019,That’s your opinion?
1974.73-5768,1,40447,robert_e_shepherd_jr,,2384.019,2384.759,"That’s my opinion, yes."
1974.73-5768,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2384.759,2386.493,Which you are entitled to it.
1974.73-5768,1,40447,robert_e_shepherd_jr,,2386.493,2389.754,That’s true.
1974.73-5768,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2413.983,2437.964,"Suppose the Virginia -- suppose the state courts have not changed their mind, suppose there hadn't been any change in the state law and the issue then presented of both state court to the state court turned down no question of exhaustion and the two issues are presented to the federal district court and to the federal Court of Appeals, which issue would you think the Court of Appeals should reach?"
1974.73-5768,1,40447,robert_e_shepherd_jr,,2443.115,2449.373,Assuming that there had been exhaustion we would take the position that they should not reach the search and seizure issue at all.
1974.73-5768,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2449.373,2458.073,"Well, I know, but that’s to the court, do you think that and not available -- now, let's assume the law state the way it is namely that that you do reach those."
1974.73-5768,1,40447,robert_e_shepherd_jr,,2458.073,2459.085,That Kaufman is still liable?
1974.73-5768,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2459.085,2460.925,Yes.
1974.73-5768,1,40447,robert_e_shepherd_jr,,2460.925,2463.311,"Well, --"
1974.73-5768,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2463.311,2469.693,"Certainly, the search and seizure issue is much more like, it is going to have a greater impact on the trial than the instructional issue?"
1974.73-5768,1,40447,robert_e_shepherd_jr,,2469.693,2472.131,I think that’s probably correct Mr. Justice White.
1974.73-5768,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2472.131,2473.63,Yes.
1974.73-5768,1,40447,robert_e_shepherd_jr,,2473.63,2482.498,"Obviously, if the evidence has to the search and seizure is excluded, I think that's in a sense dispositive of the case."
1974.73-5768,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2482.498,2485.32,Yes.
1974.73-5768,1,40447,robert_e_shepherd_jr,,2485.32,2503.764,"But, in light of the action that the District Court had taken on the instructional issue and in light of the Fourth Circuit’s view that that was the correct disposition for the Court to then deal with the search and seizure issue --"
1974.73-5768,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2503.764,2504.298,I know but what --
1974.73-5768,1,40447,robert_e_shepherd_jr,,2504.298,2514.851,-- would be to in a fact dealing with a pretrial of federal habeas corpus giving an advisory opinion prior to what might very well be a new state trial.
1974.73-5768,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2514.851,2531.836,Why shouldn’t the Fourth Circuit have dealt with search and seizure issue first and that it sustained that the trial -- the case was over and that that turn it down and then they sent it back to case to the Virginia courts on the instructional issue?
1974.73-5768,1,40447,robert_e_shepherd_jr,,2531.836,2543.212,"I think that would’ve been a much easier road to travel but as to whether it would’ve been and appropriate or a proper road, I think it’s an entirely different question."
1974.73-5768,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2543.212,2544.53,"Or whether it’s error, if it didn’t?"
1974.73-5768,1,40447,robert_e_shepherd_jr,,2544.53,2546.277,Or whether it’s error if it didn’t.
1974.73-5768,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2546.277,2559.772,Is it apparent for me that the District Court opinion or the Court of Appeals’ opinion that the states simply would not have tried the man again had the search and seizure point been resolved against him?
1974.73-5768,1,40447,robert_e_shepherd_jr,,2559.772,2583.297,I don think either of the courts expressed any view on that Mr. Justice Rehnquist and it’s really hard for me to even say at this point what other available evidence there might be because it’s a local Commonwealth’s attorney that actually tries the cases and we merely handle the appellate in collateral proceedings.
1974.73-5768,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2583.297,2592.894,"Have you ever known of a dope case in Virginia where a conviction without any, the dope being used?"
1974.73-5768,1,40447,robert_e_shepherd_jr,,2595.316,2612.312,"I think it would -- I think it [Laughter] would be very, very difficult conceivably in this case, they might have received it purely on the testimony of the informer as to whether he was able to express the facts that it was really --"
1974.73-5768,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2612.312,2625.508,But more to the point as I understand that your point is that the Fourth Circuit could have passed on both points but they didn’t have to pay a small (Inaudible).
1974.73-5768,1,40447,robert_e_shepherd_jr,,2625.508,2626.318,I think that --
1974.73-5768,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2626.318,2629.038,You admit that they could’ve passed on both.
1974.73-5768,1,40447,robert_e_shepherd_jr,,2629.038,2641.262,"I think they probably could have passed on both and in fact in the passed as counsel for the petitioners pointed out, they have done so in Hewett versus North Carolina."
1974.73-5768,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2670.643,2694.633,"Mr. Shepherd, you sought up to bring up a couple of times the larger question or the larger position, the larger claim that a search and seizure claim is simply unavailable on federal habeas corpus that is the position taken by Mr. Justice Powell in his concurring opinion in Schneckloth against Bustamonte."
1974.73-5768,1,40447,robert_e_shepherd_jr,,2705.211,2716.752,I'm not sure that it’s ever directly been brought up and as to whether it’s properly before the court at this point and in matter of fact as to whether the substance of the issue is even before the court.
1974.73-5768,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2725.613,2742.289,"So of course if you're -- if the claim is here, if you should prevail on that claim then clearly the Court of Appeals was right in saying in not reaching the claim because if you're correct they couldn’t reach the claim."
1974.73-5768,1,40447,robert_e_shepherd_jr,,2745.708,2747.449,That would be correct.
1974.73-5768,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2747.449,2754.547,"But you haven’t made that, you haven’t take that position in this litigation until now, have you?"
1974.73-5768,1,40447,robert_e_shepherd_jr,,2754.547,2755.704,"No, the Schneckloth is (Voice Overlap)."
1974.73-5768,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2755.704,2756.94,And you don’t really in your brief here?
1974.73-5768,1,40447,robert_e_shepherd_jr,,2756.94,2761.626,Schneckloth is cited but it is not cited for that purpose.
1974.73-5768,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2761.626,2762.506,Brought a composition.
1974.73-5768,1,40447,robert_e_shepherd_jr,,2762.506,2764.044,Right.
1974.73-5768,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2764.044,2765.435,And you haven’t brief to that?
1974.73-5768,1,40447,robert_e_shepherd_jr,,2765.435,2766.399,"No, that’s correct."
1974.73-5768,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2784.453,2786.777,Thank you Mr. Shepherd.
1974.73-5768,2,21087,daniel_c_kaufman,,2788.395,2790.676,"Yes I do, Mr. Chief Justice."
1974.73-5768,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2847.314,2858.914,"Do you agree with Mr. Shepherd, Mr. Kaufman that those practices of the Supreme Court of Virginia is not to pass on an issue such as that if it wasn’t raised any differently than you raised it in the Circuit Court?"
1974.73-5768,2,21087,daniel_c_kaufman,,2858.914,2875.285,"Mr. Justice Rehnquist, I'm not that familiar with the practice of the Virginia Supreme Court to be aware of the rational for their decision but as Mr. Shepherd pointed out it was a decision and it has the effect of the decision on the merits."
1974.73-5768,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2875.285,2885.016,Certainly not on the merits of a claim that prior decisions of the Court would hold couldn’t properly be raised in the absence of a suitable objection?
1974.73-5768,2,21087,daniel_c_kaufman,,2885.016,2897.033,I would tend to agree that that would certainly be an open question had the Commonwealth in opposing the petition called the Court’s attention to some defect in the objection but they did not.
1974.73-5768,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2987.809,2988.977,Thank you Mr. Kaufman.
