2010.09-529,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,8.254,"We will hear argument next in Case 09-529, the Virginia Office For Protection and Advocacy v. Stewart."
2010.09-529,0,41355,seth_m_galanter,,9.356,12.189,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2010.09-529,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,52.999,61.955,"Counsel, if this were a private suit, let's say Ford Motor Company has two subsidiaries, Ford East and Ford West, they get into a dispute."
2010.09-529,0,41355,seth_m_galanter,,66.543,68.811,"--Well, Your Honor, if I could clarify."
2010.09-529,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,72.279,72.712,Yes.
2010.09-529,0,41355,seth_m_galanter,,76.731,78.166,It would have to--
2010.09-529,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,78.166,81.202,"That adversely affects their reputation, too, so they sue them."
2010.09-529,0,41355,seth_m_galanter,,81.202,87.289,"--I think that inquiry goes to the question of adversity and standing, the Article III question."
2010.09-529,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,93.51,96.895,It's independent -- it is independent from what?
2010.09-529,0,41355,seth_m_galanter,,96.895,99.497,--It's independent from the executive branch.
2010.09-529,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,102.199,104.401,"Yes, but is it independent from the State?"
2010.09-529,0,41355,seth_m_galanter,,105.918,109.036,The statute requires independence.
2010.09-529,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,125.231,143.376,"You say on page 27 of your brief, the blue brief, that there is no big deal here with respect to State sovereignty because ultimately the sovereign retains the authority to dissolve the State agency plaintiff if the State believes the litigation is too onerous."
2010.09-529,0,41355,seth_m_galanter,,143.376,144.026,That is correct.
2010.09-529,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,155.016,163.522,"That's a good cite for your proposition, but arguably in those cases the ICC is really not the real party in interest."
2010.09-529,0,41355,seth_m_galanter,,167.891,181.651,"Well, I believe this Court has continually held that independent agencies and other Federal agencies can litigate, the cases involving the Federal Labor Relations Board."
2010.09-529,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,190.607,195.327,"To get back to my question, no court would entertain Ford West against Ford East?"
2010.09-529,0,41355,seth_m_galanter,,195.327,201.397,"--If that's right, and I think it is if they are part of the same, if they are subsidiaries of one corporation and aren't separate."
2010.09-529,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,201.397,202.281,Why is that true?
2010.09-529,0,41355,seth_m_galanter,,223.661,230.565,"I had understood that to be the Chief Justice's hypothetical, they were divisions of a single legal entity."
2010.09-529,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,230.565,235.202,Not divisions; separate corporate entities that happened to be wholly owned by the same parent.
2010.09-529,0,41355,seth_m_galanter,,235.202,241.106,"I do believe then that there could be litigation between them, but ultimately there wouldn't be."
2010.09-529,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,241.106,243.891,"Well, I would have thought that would become an advisory opinion."
2010.09-529,0,41355,seth_m_galanter,,263.722,273.261,"Well, that's true that after the litigation is over, one of the parties may, you know, be able to work around the law."
2010.09-529,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,283.883,287.585,The State here is free to dissolve one of the parties to the case.
2010.09-529,0,41355,seth_m_galanter,,288.871,292.389,"Well, it's the Commonwealth that is free to dissolve one of the parties."
2010.09-529,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,292.389,293.523,"All right, State, Commonwealth."
2010.09-529,0,41355,seth_m_galanter,,293.523,294.007,I know.
2010.09-529,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,333.132,340.636,"Counsel, I'm not quite sure what the premise of your argument is."
2010.09-529,0,41355,seth_m_galanter,,376.744,377.561,I--
2010.09-529,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,377.561,387.933,"And if it is the one about the State's independence, how do you articulate why that becomes important or not?"
2010.09-529,0,41355,seth_m_galanter,,395.539,401.126,"--If I may, there are -- there are three issues that are intertwined here."
2010.09-529,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,448.923,457.113,"Well, let's assume, and -- and I'm not sure what the situation is in -- in the Commonwealth."
2010.09-529,0,41355,seth_m_galanter,,483.096,487.798,It -- it is not the case in Virginia or in 49 of the 50 States.
2010.09-529,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,487.798,488.481,Okay.
2010.09-529,0,41355,seth_m_galanter,,522.387,523.154,I--
2010.09-529,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,523.154,532.077,Requiring the State to in effect alter its -- its governmental structure in order to obtain the Federal money?
2010.09-529,0,41355,seth_m_galanter,,532.077,535.862,"--I do think there might be a problem, first requiring it."
2010.09-529,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,547.586,547.886,Sure.
2010.09-529,0,41355,seth_m_galanter,,547.886,557.075,"--And here the only question, because -- the only question addressed below and the only question -- this is all on the interlocutory appeal just on the Eleventh Amendment--"
2010.09-529,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,557.075,557.492,Got you.
2010.09-529,0,41355,seth_m_galanter,,557.492,578.071,"--is whether we can sue other officials in the State to bring them into prospective compliance with the Federal law, as -- as I said, though, and this statute authorizes the State if it takes the money to designate either a public or private entity as its protection and advocacy system."
2010.09-529,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,581.773,589.546,"Well, right, but that makes all the difference in the world because they made the choice of saying this is going to be one of us, the State."
2010.09-529,0,41355,seth_m_galanter,,598.069,609.008,--I -- I think that they're both sufficiently jurisdictional that you could reach them in -- in -- you wouldn't have to reach Article III before the Eleventh Amendment.
2010.09-529,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,623.184,629.504,"Mr. Galanter, if we can go back to get what this -- this entity was."
2010.09-529,0,41355,seth_m_galanter,,648.133,649.035,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2010.09-529,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,649.035,655.588,It's not -- it's not up to the State to want to put it into an independent regulatory agency.
2010.09-529,0,41355,seth_m_galanter,,667.879,672.367,It -- it and its predecessors were created just to implement this program.
2010.09-529,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,672.367,675.902,Does it ever do anything else other than administer the Federal program?
2010.09-529,0,41355,seth_m_galanter,,675.902,698.331,"It has a few responsibilities that the State has given it under State law in addition, but its primary function -- and at this point all its budget comes from the Federal Government, and it serves primarily this Federal function to go into public and private institutions to observe and make sure that abuse and neglect is not occurring there."
2010.09-529,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,718.312,725.299,"Counsel, following up on Justice Scalia's question to you, his question in fact is in part what happened here."
2010.09-529,0,41355,seth_m_galanter,,745.462,746.628,That -- that is correct.
2010.09-529,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,759.703,761.555,"Well, just -- I know you are anxious to get to that, but--"
2010.09-529,0,41355,seth_m_galanter,,782.885,810.135,"--Well, I -- again, I would go back to the Federal analogy, that in all this litigation with the ICC or -- well, with the Federal labor relations authorities, with the licensing authority of the Department of Interior for dams that -- that, you know, the TVA might want to build, that Congress can always eliminate these agencies, but while they are still in existence--"
2010.09-529,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,810.135,817.308,"I guess in Nixon v. United States the President could have dismissed the attorney general, but we allowed the suit to go forward."
2010.09-529,0,41355,seth_m_galanter,,819.51,833.001,"--Well, I think it's because you look at standing in terms of the current reality, and in Nixon, for example, the attorney general had promulgated a regulation saying he couldn't dismiss the special prosecutor except for cause."
2010.09-529,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,833.001,843.375,"But there are a number of instances in the States where constitutional officers have their separate autonomy, their separate responsibilities."
2010.09-529,0,41355,seth_m_galanter,,890.689,895.658,"Well, I would say that -- well, I would say two things."
2010.09-529,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,921.125,938.087,"Well, he would tell the governor that the governor is not giving adequate protection to prison inmates or State employees, the -- that the governor's own personnel regulations are incorrect, and he would sue under Ex parte Young."
2010.09-529,0,41355,seth_m_galanter,,938.087,940.872,--If the Commonwealth--
2010.09-529,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,940.872,942.789,There are all kinds of Federal rights.
2010.09-529,0,41355,seth_m_galanter,,942.789,944.091,"--Well, but they are generally not--"
2010.09-529,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,944.091,949.193,And the question is can one State entity enforce it against another State entity in a Federal court.
2010.09-529,0,41355,seth_m_galanter,,949.193,955.113,--The -- there are not a lot of Federal rights that State officials have against other officials.
2010.09-529,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,956.599,975.727,"Well, but that -- but under -- under your theory there would be, because under Ex parte Young the whole point of it is that a -- a person can allege that this fictional private individual who is really a governmental individual is violating a Federal right."
2010.09-529,0,41355,seth_m_galanter,,976.694,978.262,--Violating the plaintiff's Federal right.
2010.09-529,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,984.499,995.14,But State attorney generals have -- have the obligation to enforce Federal rights for all the citizens of their States.
2010.09-529,0,41355,seth_m_galanter,,995.14,1009.198,"And if they have that right under -- power under State law, then -- and they exercise that power and elect to be in Federal court to litigate Federal issues, that is not barred by the Eleventh Amendment, we would submit."
2010.09-529,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1009.198,1011.9,"Well, that's -- that issue -- I know your white line is on."
2010.09-529,0,41355,seth_m_galanter,,1026.076,1030.045,I believe the case here I'm thinking of comes out of Seattle.
2010.09-529,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1031.813,1032.88,Do you have the citation?
2010.09-529,0,41355,seth_m_galanter,,1032.88,1033.949,--I don't have it with me.
2010.09-529,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1033.949,1034.949,I have been looking for it.
2010.09-529,0,41355,seth_m_galanter,,1035.215,1049.775,"But -- but the point I was making is that sometimes one Federal agency needs permission from another Federal agency to build something, and there would be a litigable controversy under Article 3, and that was the only point I was trying to make."
2010.09-529,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1053.744,1054.179,"Thank you, counsel."
2010.09-529,1,24910,ginger_d_anders,,1066.486,1068.855,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2010.09-529,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1091.619,1105.111,Do you think -- do you think the Spending Clause allows the Federal Government to condition the receipt of Federal funds on a State's agreement to change the structure of State government?
2010.09-529,1,24910,ginger_d_anders,,1105.111,1114.884,"I think it does, so long as that requirement is reasonably related to the government's interest in the funds and in -- in the objective of its regulation."
2010.09-529,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1115.167,1134.465,"Suppose the government said: If you want Medicaid funds, the State agency that administers the Medicaid program must be headed by a person who has a 20-year term of office and is removable only for gross dereliction of duty."
2010.09-529,1,24910,ginger_d_anders,,1137.95,1141.968,"--I think it could do that, so long as that's not independently unconstitutional."
2010.09-529,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1178.744,1192.753,"Ms. Anders, I understand that most States that are taking advantage of this program do it through a private agency, not a State; is that -- is that right?"
2010.09-529,1,24910,ginger_d_anders,,1192.753,1193.553,--That's correct.
2010.09-529,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1196.038,1201.692,Can EPA sue the Army Corps of Engineers for violating the Clean Water Act?
2010.09-529,1,24910,ginger_d_anders,,1201.692,1205.894,"Well, I think you would have an Article 3 problem if there isn't sufficient adversity."
2010.09-529,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1206.944,1207.679,"Well, it's very adverse."
2010.09-529,1,24910,ginger_d_anders,,1215.0,1225.224,"--Well, they're both -- the heads of both agencies are, in that situation, I think, subject to removal by the same people, and so in that situation, you would have an Article 3 problem."
2010.09-529,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1229.926,1238.115,Do you agree with the Petitioners that Virginia can dissolve VOPA if it finds the litigation too onerous?
2010.09-529,1,24910,ginger_d_anders,,1238.115,1250.673,"I think that that would not happen in practice, because if Virginia were to dissolve VOPA, it would be out of compliance with the Federal scheme so it would lose its -- it would lose its Federal funding at that point."
2010.09-529,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1254.042,1258.362,"If it happened to arise, do you think that they can -- do you agree with the Petitioners that they can do it?"
2010.09-529,1,24910,ginger_d_anders,,1258.362,1269.753,"--I think they -- I think they could do it, but I think this -- this Court has previously adjudicated cases where, in theory, the government could have changed the case mid-stream."
2010.09-529,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1294.202,1300.289,Could you be a little bit more specific for me on what you mean about an Article 3 problem?
2010.09-529,1,24910,ginger_d_anders,,1317.983,1319.333,I think there are several.
2010.09-529,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1336.561,1338.897,I thought -- this I'm confused about.
2010.09-529,1,24910,ginger_d_anders,,1355.087,1362.593,"--If that was sufficient to get into Federal court for Article 3 purposes, I think there might be some situations in which the attorney general--"
2010.09-529,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1362.593,1362.926,No.
2010.09-529,1,24910,ginger_d_anders,,1380.97,1392.795,"--There may be some circumstances like that one, in which the State AG's use of Ex parte Young would raise special sovereignty interests that would counsel against--"
2010.09-529,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1392.795,1394.397,I want just a yes or no answer.
2010.09-529,1,24910,ginger_d_anders,,1415.66,1418.945,--I think he could under this Court's decision in Verizon.
2010.09-529,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1418.945,1419.229,He could?
2010.09-529,1,24910,ginger_d_anders,,1419.229,1422.062,I think there might be certain extreme circumstances where--
2010.09-529,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1422.062,1423.881,I don't -- I think that is a problem.
2010.09-529,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1425.133,1425.966,That can't be.
2010.09-529,1,24910,ginger_d_anders,,1437.274,1443.177,"--Right, and as this Court said in Lassen, I think often the Federal court doesn't look behind State officers--"
2010.09-529,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1443.177,1446.812,I thought that -- suppose I am right about this and you can't do it.
2010.09-529,1,24910,ginger_d_anders,,1461.222,1469.809,"--No, I don't think so, because the same special sovereignty interests are not present here, because under the spending clause, Virginia had the choice to opt into this scheme."
2010.09-529,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1469.809,1482.717,"Doesn't the Federal statute say: Virginia, if you want to do this through a State agency, that State agency has to be an independent agency and has the authority to sue."
2010.09-529,1,24910,ginger_d_anders,,1482.717,1484.217,"Yes, that's correct."
2010.09-529,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1484.217,1489.371,Are you sure that the governor cannot remove the members of VOPA?
2010.09-529,1,24910,ginger_d_anders,,1499.06,1501.345,"As a matter of State law, I don't think he can."
2010.09-529,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1508.998,1510.2,What would it not comply with?
2010.09-529,1,24910,ginger_d_anders,,1522.175,1530.614,"--Well, there is definitely a prohibition on him removing board members of VOPA or officials of VOPA as a result of VOPA's actions in litigation."
2010.09-529,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1531.314,1531.998,Where is that?
2010.09-529,1,24910,ginger_d_anders,,1531.998,1539.054,"--Well, the provision -- well, the requirement that VOPA have full authority to pursue legal remedies to ensure the protection of individuals."
2010.09-529,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1547.825,1568.823,"What if the VOPA officials are engaged in corruption or illegal conduct or, you know, extracurricular activity that brings discredit upon the -- the governor has no power to say that, you are a Virginia official and you are -- you know, whatever -- breaking Virginia law, for example?"
2010.09-529,1,24910,ginger_d_anders,,1569.623,1574.56,"--Well, under Virginia law I think that VOPA's officials are subject to for-cause removal provisions."
2010.09-529,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1588.634,1601.294,"Going back to your exchange with Justice Breyer, I assume that you could stand by your answer and say the attorney general could sue the governor, because he's not suing the governor in his official capacity."
2010.09-529,1,24910,ginger_d_anders,,1614.018,1616.97,"I think that's right, that under Verizon no more is required."
2010.09-529,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1618.672,1620.722,Of course -- of course Verizon was a private party.
2010.09-529,1,24910,ginger_d_anders,,1620.722,1622.458,Verizon was a private party.
2010.09-529,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1622.458,1626.01,Suing in his capacity as attorney general and under his.
2010.09-529,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1638.15,1638.85,I really lost you.
2010.09-529,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1641.169,1642.335,"Yes, right, exactly."
2010.09-529,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1642.335,1648.656,I didn't think Ex parte Young allows -- allows an attorney general to sue as a plaintiff in his personal capacity.
2010.09-529,1,24910,ginger_d_anders,,1649.506,1652.941,"Well, I think that you might have State sovereignty interests at that point."
2010.09-529,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1652.941,1654.124,That's your position.
2010.09-529,1,24910,ginger_d_anders,,1654.124,1666.582,"That would prevent a Federal court from adjudicating a suit, but there's no question that those interests aren't present here because Virginia has chosen to create a State agency in order to enforce these Federal rights."
2010.09-529,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1666.582,1668.801,I'm with Justice Scalia on this.
2010.09-529,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1670.301,1673.253,"Thank you, Ms. Anderson."
2010.09-529,2,22366,earle_duncan_getchell_jr,,1677.621,1681.007,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2010.09-529,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1692.314,1695.349,A dignified sovereign should not agree to the deal.
2010.09-529,2,22366,earle_duncan_getchell_jr,,1695.349,1697.701,"--Well, let's--"
2010.09-529,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1697.701,1700.236,"I mean, you know, the Commonwealth had the choice."
2010.09-529,2,22366,earle_duncan_getchell_jr,,1720.9,1731.773,"--Well, let me -- let me first say that the choice issue raises some interesting questions because of the procedural posture of this case being an interlocutory appeal."
2010.09-529,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1755.388,1760.625,"It's not a waiver, it's the Federal statute is clear."
2010.09-529,2,22366,earle_duncan_getchell_jr,,1796.198,1799.066,I would have thought two things about that.
2010.09-529,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1823.765,1827.984,Suppose you have a State which loves litigation.
2010.09-529,2,22366,earle_duncan_getchell_jr,,1886.772,1889.707,I would say two things about that.
2010.09-529,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1897.329,1897.612,Okay.
2010.09-529,2,22366,earle_duncan_getchell_jr,,1914.94,1924.729,"Well, I don't think the State by restructuring itself would then ordinarily expect its agencies to sue each other in Federal court."
2010.09-529,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1924.729,1931.55,If they wrote it down specifically in the law and said we would love to have our agencies sue each other.
2010.09-529,2,22366,earle_duncan_getchell_jr,,1937.639,1943.96,I would think that under ordinary rules of waiver of sovereign immunity that would limit the suits to the suits of the sovereign of the State.
2010.09-529,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1943.96,1948.995,"Why, because what's undignified about allowing the State to live with the choice it made?"
2010.09-529,2,22366,earle_duncan_getchell_jr,,1948.995,1955.35,I think the existing doctrine is an unspecified waiver of sovereign immunity that is not consented in Federal court.
2010.09-529,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1955.35,1960.152,"I'm sorry, I think there are concepts being confused."
2010.09-529,2,22366,earle_duncan_getchell_jr,,2043.908,2053.614,"In referring to sovereign immunity, I was trying to answer the hypothetical with respect to why Ex parte Young doesn't apply."
2010.09-529,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2063.037,2064.853,The State should have expected that.
2010.09-529,2,22366,earle_duncan_getchell_jr,,2064.853,2066.039,Excuse me.
2010.09-529,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2071.241,2071.943,No.
2010.09-529,2,22366,earle_duncan_getchell_jr,,2078.847,2079.497,--Okay.
2010.09-529,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2079.497,2110.818,"I am imagining a system where the State wants to let the AG, this organization, the sheriff of Middlesex County, the City of San Francisco, they want to permit such entities to become plaintiffs against other parts of the State government in such a State if ordinary Ex parte Young requirements are met."
2010.09-529,2,22366,earle_duncan_getchell_jr,,2119.34,2124.376,Because Ex parte Young is an exception to the default position.
2010.09-529,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2159.132,2160.767,Why -- why is it an extension?
2010.09-529,2,22366,earle_duncan_getchell_jr,,2210.232,2225.657,"Well, what I -- what I would say is that Ex parte Young is intended to deal with the situation where a citizen of a dual sovereign is able to vindicate his superior Federal rights against the State."
2010.09-529,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2266.484,2277.34,"When Virginia agreed to participate in this program, did Virginia understand that it could be sued by VOPA not only in the State courts but also in Federal court?"
2010.09-529,2,22366,earle_duncan_getchell_jr,,2277.34,2278.459,I would assert not.
2010.09-529,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2291.784,2315.065,"So the point is, if it's not in -- you certainly agree that this State agency has taken on the obligations of the Federal program, and if it doesn't turn over records as the Federal statute requires it to do, it has to be amenable to suit somewhere."
2010.09-529,2,22366,earle_duncan_getchell_jr,,2350.722,2354.44,The program would go to a State court.
2010.09-529,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2359.844,2368.617,If you -- is that -- I want to make sure I understood what your position is on that.
2010.09-529,2,22366,earle_duncan_getchell_jr,,2382.793,2391.232,"If you have a -- if you have a clear right to these documents as a surrogate, and you know that's a merits question that has never been reached, whether this is a rights-conferring statute."
2010.09-529,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2391.232,2392.465,I'm asking you what is the forum?
2010.09-529,2,22366,earle_duncan_getchell_jr,,2435.075,2438.444,I would -- I personally believe you could also do it in circuit court.
2010.09-529,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2448.466,2455.572,But which office has said it has to go to -- to the State supreme court on mandamus?
2010.09-529,2,22366,earle_duncan_getchell_jr,,2461.993,2507.104,"The statute, the mandamus statute has a fairly broad catch-all provision at the end which I think would allow suit in -- in circuit court, but I don't think where it can sue really informs the doctrine here, because I think the doctrine here is if you are going to let, under the analysis argued here -- which is not modest, it's very, very broad -- if VOPA can sue in Federal court under Ex parte Young, so can any agency of -- of the -- any State that receives Federal funds upon which it makes the claim at the Ex parte Young stage, which is before you reach the merits, any agency receiving Federal money that can dream up a Federal claim under Ex parte Young could sue the State."
2010.09-529,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2507.104,2510.992,And -- and that has independent litigating authority.
2010.09-529,2,22366,earle_duncan_getchell_jr,,2510.992,2512.575,"Yes, and -- and--"
2010.09-529,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2512.575,2512.942,Okay.
2010.09-529,2,22366,earle_duncan_getchell_jr,,2514.194,2514.51,--And I--
2010.09-529,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2514.51,2517.812,This agency was given independent litigating authority.
2010.09-529,2,22366,earle_duncan_getchell_jr,,2517.812,2537.643,"--I think -- I think Virginia happens to be unusual, as long as we are talking about the policy of results that is will come from this, I think Virginia is unusual in having as much control in the attorney general over who can sue than -- than a lot of States do; because I think a lot of States have their own independent agencies that proliferate and have suit authority."
2010.09-529,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2566.393,2567.745,It hasn't happened.
2010.09-529,2,22366,earle_duncan_getchell_jr,,2611.358,2620.714,I would -- I would say that it's never happened before because nobody's ever claimed before that Ex parte Young permits a part of the State to sue the other part of the State.
2010.09-529,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2627.867,2656.47,"It isn't that Ex parte Young -- if I understand this right, which is why I mention it -- it isn't that Ex parte Young permits one part of a State to sue another part, it is a State permits one part of the State to sue another part, that that's common in the State, that the law requires it, and the question is, in that circumstance should the Ex parte Young situation be treated differently?"
2010.09-529,2,22366,earle_duncan_getchell_jr,,2656.47,2657.103,And--
2010.09-529,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2657.103,2660.272,Am I right about the statement of the question in the case?
2010.09-529,2,22366,earle_duncan_getchell_jr,,2660.272,2675.514,"--I -- I think -- I think whether or not the State has given independent authority to sue without specifying that it can be in Federal court, without waiving its immunity in Federal court, is not the issue in the case."
2010.09-529,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2709.187,2724.281,Do you know -- do you know of any other statute in which there is an independent State agency that exists for the sole purpose of administering a Federal program?
2010.09-529,2,22366,earle_duncan_getchell_jr,,2724.281,2728.816,I -- I am not an expert in that area of the law.
2010.09-529,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2735.003,2752.948,"You couldn't give any example of a Federal program that says State, you can do it through a private agency; you can do it through a public agency -- public agency created to implement this Federal program, that is until all this -- I don't really know of any such."
2010.09-529,2,22366,earle_duncan_getchell_jr,,2752.948,2766.108,"--I personally don't know of one as I stand here, but my supposition is that because the Federal spending power has been so dramatically exercised over the years, that there probably is one, I had not thought to look for it."
2010.09-529,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2766.108,2767.976,"In your experience, this would be helpful."
2010.09-529,2,22366,earle_duncan_getchell_jr,,2795.543,2804.083,"There -- there are two things to look at: Lower subdivisions of the States, which in many States are--"
2010.09-529,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2804.083,2806.435,Cities against -- they must do that a lot.
2010.09-529,2,22366,earle_duncan_getchell_jr,,2806.435,2810.22,"--Yeah, but they are just corporations in Virginia and most States."
2010.09-529,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2830.015,2838.137,University of Massachusetts v. State Environmental Organization.
2010.09-529,2,22366,earle_duncan_getchell_jr,,2841.656,2850.095,--I think that -- that the States vary as to how tolerant they are of having their parts sue each other in State court.
2010.09-529,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2908.115,2923.81,I'm not sure that -- what you are forgetting is that Virginia took a lot of money to set up and get the benefits of Federal funds by creating an independent agency.
2010.09-529,2,22366,earle_duncan_getchell_jr,,2955.095,2965.303,--I think it has -- I think it has long been recognized that the dignity of the State is not offended at all by a suit against -- against it in its own courts that it has authorized.
2010.09-529,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2976.426,2978.361,But we use -- we don't bring the State in.
2010.09-529,2,22366,earle_duncan_getchell_jr,,2981.663,2991.018,--But this Court has always recognized that there is a large sense in which that's a fiction and it's just something that we have to tolerate in order to have a dual system of -- of sovereignty.
2010.09-529,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2991.018,2995.839,Your argument is really -- really is a sovereign immunity argument.
2010.09-529,2,22366,earle_duncan_getchell_jr,,3024.057,3025.425,That is precisely my argument.
2010.09-529,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3025.425,3028.46,"So sovereign immunity is part of your argument, but--"
2010.09-529,2,22366,earle_duncan_getchell_jr,,3028.46,3042.351,"I think it's all that is really appropriately before this Court, because again, we are up here on an interlocutory appeal where the decision below in the Fourth Circuit by Judge Wilkinson is premised entirely on sovereign immunity."
2010.09-529,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3042.351,3042.835,Right.
2010.09-529,2,22366,earle_duncan_getchell_jr,,3074.756,3077.958,"One, the State is being pitted against itself."
2010.09-529,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3127.207,3140.449,"Are there other areas -- and I can't come up with the name of the case which was suggested by counsel, your friend, in his opening argument."
2010.09-529,2,22366,earle_duncan_getchell_jr,,3163.397,3165.082,I don't know the case.
2010.09-529,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3180.342,3185.596,"In this case, could Virginia sue VOPA in Federal court?"
2010.09-529,2,22366,earle_duncan_getchell_jr,,3185.596,3189.781,I don't think -- I don't think it appropriately could.
2010.09-529,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3189.781,3191.916,You think it could or could not?
2010.09-529,2,22366,earle_duncan_getchell_jr,,3191.916,3193.516,I do not think it appropriately could.
2010.09-529,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3197.22,3205.826,"Well, it would be the parent suing the -- the subsidiary, and VOPA is not the State."
2010.09-529,2,22366,earle_duncan_getchell_jr,,3205.826,3214.349,"VOPA is part of the State for purposes of sovereign immunity analysis, I would have thought."
2010.09-529,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3290.43,3294.384,"Bottom line, then, is that -- to restrict Congress's choice."
2010.09-529,2,22366,earle_duncan_getchell_jr,,3328.105,3329.821,"--I don't think so, for two reasons."
2010.09-529,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3330.255,3330.973,I'm sorry.
2010.09-529,2,22366,earle_duncan_getchell_jr,,3333.09,3344.531,"--I don't think that -- I think Congress could have, under traditional waiver authority, under the spending power, have said: If you want to take the money, we're making a clear statement, you have to waive your sovereign immunity and be sued in State -- I mean, Federal court."
2010.09-529,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3362.493,3382.656,"--So you would acknowledge that if the State knew when it took the money that it was -- and when it created a State agency to administer the program that it was letting itself open to suit in Federal court under an Ex parte Young theory, then everything would be okay?"
2010.09-529,2,22366,earle_duncan_getchell_jr,,3382.656,3385.692,"--Well, no, because I don't think it would ever."
2010.09-529,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3385.692,3389.846,"That would be a waiver of whatever sovereignty immunity interest it would have, wouldn't it?"
2010.09-529,2,22366,earle_duncan_getchell_jr,,3389.846,3393.048,"Congress conditioned on receiving the money on waiver, I suppose."
2010.09-529,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3393.048,3402.737,"Congress could, but if they knew it in this instance when they accepted the money, you wouldn't have a case, would you?"
2010.09-529,2,22366,earle_duncan_getchell_jr,,3402.737,3408.557,"The law, under traditional waiver doctrine had been done right, no, we wouldn't have a case."
2010.09-529,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3417.913,3419.113,That's a good point.
2010.09-529,2,22366,earle_duncan_getchell_jr,,3419.113,3443.58,"And so under the circumstances here we have a fairly peculiar specialized situation, but deciding in favor of the petitioners I think is fraught with peril and is doctrinally unprecedented and improper and we would ask that the decision of the Fourth Circuit be affirmed."
2010.09-529,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3443.58,3445.097,"--Thank you, counsel."
2010.09-529,3,41355,seth_m_galanter,,3447.848,3453.919,I have three points for those three minutes.
2010.09-529,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3509.339,3518.112,"Have you found any case, are there a lot, a few, none, where one State agency at a State level sues another in Federal court, period?"
2010.09-529,3,41355,seth_m_galanter,,3520.981,3521.981,No.
2010.09-529,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3522.766,3523.649,"Well, are there any?"
2010.09-529,3,41355,seth_m_galanter,,3523.649,3527.217,Other than in this protection advocacy system.
2010.09-529,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3527.217,3527.784,None?
2010.09-529,3,41355,seth_m_galanter,,3527.784,3528.284,None.
2010.09-529,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3528.284,3531.954,"See, nagging at me is some kind of Article III problem."
2010.09-529,3,41355,seth_m_galanter,,3537.206,3542.227,"Well, but that's because Congress doesn't usually vest rights in--"
2010.09-529,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3542.227,3543.596,It wouldn't have to.
