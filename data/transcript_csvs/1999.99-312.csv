1999.99-312,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.91,"We'll hear argument now in Number 99-312, Norfolk Southern Railway Company v. Dedra Shanklin."
1999.99-312,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,10.301,12.933,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1999.99-312,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,75.236,83.238,"Well, has the Secretary determined the devices to be installed here, or is it just some minimum program we're dealing with?"
1999.99-312,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,83.238,85.559,"--This is not a minimum program, Justice O'Connor."
1999.99-312,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,101.612,113.446,I somehow had the impression that we were dealing here with a crossing that had crossbucks installed under the minimum program for a State.
1999.99-312,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,113.446,114.539,I think it's important--
1999.99-312,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,114.539,115.435,"In this case, Tennessee."
1999.99-312,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,116.055,116.24,--No.
1999.99-312,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,116.24,118.537,"No, okay."
1999.99-312,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,118.537,121.049,"That's absolutely wrong, Justice O'Connor, on two counts, one a matter of law, and one is a matter of fact."
1999.99-312,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,157.319,158.084,Mr. Phillips--
1999.99-312,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,158.084,158.592,--the section 130 program.
1999.99-312,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,159.391,163.959,"--Where do we find (b)(1) and (b)(3) set out in the... in your brief, or somewhere else?"
1999.99-312,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,163.959,171.096,"It's in the appendix to the petition, Mr. Chief Justice, at pages 46a and 47a."
1999.99-312,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,171.096,171.653,Thank you.
1999.99-312,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,171.653,183.433,"Is it your position that preemption occurs when the devices are installed and the... pursuant to the Federal program, and the money's paid?"
1999.99-312,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,183.433,184.304,Yes.
1999.99-312,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,187.461,189.183,That's the point at which preemption occurs?
1999.99-312,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,189.183,189.383,Right.
1999.99-312,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,212.304,228.705,"Mr. Phillips, you started with discussion of the Easterwood case, and that was a case that held there was no preemption, yet you're using it to support your position that there is preemption."
1999.99-312,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,257.709,258.653,"No, Justice Ginsburg."
1999.99-312,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,263.444,264.08,"Yes, but--"
1999.99-312,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,264.08,264.735,--Crossing in CSX.
1999.99-312,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,264.735,265.266,"--Yes, but the--"
1999.99-312,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,265.266,265.556,There was--
1999.99-312,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,265.556,270.693,"--It was originally a proposal not for a simple sign, but for gates."
1999.99-312,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,273.01,273.503,--No--
1999.99-312,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,273.503,279.668,All... my only point is that the Court was not looking at what we have before us today.
1999.99-312,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,283.144,283.825,--Okay.
1999.99-312,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,367.556,383.907,"It held there was no preemption, and I'm a little troubled at the idea of taking a case that held there was no preemption in that case to establish beyond question that there is preemption in a case that was not before the Court."
1999.99-312,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,383.907,421.62,"Well, I wouldn't be so bold as to tell you that there's no basis for rethinking the wisdom of the basic analysis in Easterwood, but the reality of what happened in Easterwood is, the Solicitor General described this exact scheme and said that this is a... that this prospective approach will work perfectly well, it is exactly what Congress wanted, but the key is to make sure that each individual grade crossing is embraced by this scheme, and you can only be assured of that once you have Federal funding, or that Federal moneys participate in the installation of the devices for any project under (b)(3)."
1999.99-312,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,421.62,434.663,"If the Secretary decided that it would be desirable to have every crossing meet at least a minimum standard, there would be no way to do that without affecting preemption, in your view?"
1999.99-312,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,434.663,457.912,"I think if the Secretary spends the money under the program that's set up today, under the (b)(3), (b)(4) program that exists today, then the Secretary would necessarily have to review the moneys that are being spent and ensure that those projects are being done in a safe fashion, and then rely on the States, subject to Federal approval as well, because it's all federally funded, to ensure the future safety of them."
1999.99-312,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,457.912,470.332,"But he couldn't... the Secretary couldn't say, in your view, we don't want to engage in that kind of detailed analysis, we just want to say universally every crossing will have at least the minimum sign?"
1999.99-312,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,470.332,480.975,I think the answer to that problem would be that the Secretary ought to change the regulations so that they no longer define adequate warning devices at all projects for which Federal funds are involved.
1999.99-312,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,480.975,483.048,Under these regulations the Secretary--
1999.99-312,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,483.048,483.048,I think if they want to get out of that they could do that.
1999.99-312,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,483.048,484.219,--could not do that.
1999.99-312,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,484.219,484.528,I'm sorry?
1999.99-312,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,484.528,494.767,"Under these regulations, the Secretary could say... couldn't say, without looking at any particular crossing, we are going to require every crossing to have at least the minimum."
1999.99-312,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,494.767,495.774,That's correct.
1999.99-312,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,548.914,555.246,"Mr. Phillips, did the Solicitor General support the outcome that we reached in Easterwood?"
1999.99-312,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,555.246,557.936,"--He did not support the... oh, he supported the outcome--"
1999.99-312,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,557.936,558.412,The outcome.
1999.99-312,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,558.412,559.776,"--that you reached in Easterwood, yes, Justice Scalia."
1999.99-312,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,559.776,560.944,Did he support the rationale?
1999.99-312,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,560.944,566.701,"He not only supported the rationale, he... I was going to say invented."
1999.99-312,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,589.018,596.828,"So you're saying that having persuaded us that that was correct, the Solicitor General now wants to persuade us that it's not correct?"
1999.99-312,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,596.828,601.546,--I think the Solicitor General could fairly be described as having come up the hill to ask you to come back down the hill--
1999.99-312,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,601.546,602.296,"Well, it's a different Solicitor General, too, isn't it?"
1999.99-312,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,603.614,606.246,"--My... yes, Your Honor, there is a different Solicitor General."
1999.99-312,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,606.246,609.755,"Representing a different philosophy on this whole area of the law, I would say."
1999.99-312,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,609.755,612.082,"Well, I... no question about that, Justice Stevens."
1999.99-312,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,612.082,612.247,Yes.
1999.99-312,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,652.39,665.867,"But that... and the reason for that... I mean, it's not as though this is... I mean, the reason why there's no cost to the railroads is that there's no real benefit to the railroad because first of all, you know, having grade crossings does no benefit to the railroad."
1999.99-312,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,729.897,734.77,"Just on this, go back for a second to the regulation, (b)(4)."
1999.99-312,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,776.832,780.339,"Well, I mean, Tennessee said they wanted to have a minimum protection program--"
1999.99-312,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,780.339,793.017,"Okay, so maybe nobody else ever does, but our problem is, it makes tremendous sense to preempt something, where somebody in authority has said this is adequate, so keep the private plaintiffs out of it."
1999.99-312,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,804.469,805.163,--(b)(4)--
1999.99-312,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,805.163,805.557,--(b)(4).
1999.99-312,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,805.557,805.797,--Right.
1999.99-312,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,805.797,806.779,(b)(3) doesn't apply.
1999.99-312,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,806.779,807.3,Right.
1999.99-312,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,807.3,814.562,"And it talks about whether the determination is made by State regulatory agencies, State highway, et cetera."
1999.99-312,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,854.072,856.468,"Well, Justice Breyer, the next line where you stop the quotation--"
1999.99-312,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,856.468,856.6,Yes.
1999.99-312,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,856.6,859.367,"--says, subject to the approval of the Federal Highway Administration."
1999.99-312,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,859.367,859.367,Yes.
1999.99-312,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,859.367,883.819,"So the initial determination of adequacy is made by those who are the closest to the situation, and they cover essentially the scope of individuals who would have information relevant to make the determination as to the adequacy of these particular devices, but all of that remains subject, ultimately, to the Secretary's approval, and if the Secretary's not convinced that these are adequate, and essentially that has to be--"
1999.99-312,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,883.819,885.512,"This, I don't understand about how it works."
1999.99-312,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,913.239,922.755,"--Well, what is clear is that the Secretary is supposed to exercise discretion, particularly with respect to all 109, section 109--"
1999.99-312,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,922.755,934.229,"Well, you have a 109 argument, but if I don't read 109 the way you read it, why don't I read the reg to say, where there's an adequacy determination by somebody in authority, you win?"
1999.99-312,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,943.628,947.735,"--I don't think that would be... the scheme was designed to be comprehensive and, indeed, I don't read the... I don't read the--"
1999.99-312,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,947.735,948.259,"--Wait, are you--"
1999.99-312,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,948.259,951.268,--What is the word... doesn't it hinge on what the word determination means?
1999.99-312,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,951.268,951.925,"--Yes, that's right."
1999.99-312,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,951.925,954.599,"Well, how can you possibly read determination to refer to adequacy?"
1999.99-312,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,963.865,964.267,Right.
1999.99-312,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,964.267,970.594,--whether the determination is made by a State or regulatory agency is subject to the approval of--
1999.99-312,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,970.594,971.31,Right.
1999.99-312,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,971.31,977.18,--That word determination there obviously means the determination of the type of warning device to be installed.
1999.99-312,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,977.18,983.312,"But Justice Scalia, the entire regulatory scheme is the (b)(3), (b)(4) scheme, and look at the beginning of (b)(3)."
1999.99-312,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1009.328,1009.65,I don't deny that.
1999.99-312,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1024.829,1025.136,Oh--
1999.99-312,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1025.136,1031.808,"And if the State says, even though we think this device is not adequate, just between you and me, we're going to install it."
1999.99-312,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1037.31,1041.28,"--And that... to me that's the pivotal point, though, is the subject to the approval of the Secretary."
1999.99-312,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1061.087,1069.088,"And you say the Secretary has exercised it just by providing the funds, whether or not any particular review is made?"
1999.99-312,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1069.088,1083.556,"Well, the Secretary receives whatever information the Secretary wants on a project-by-project basis if that's what he requires, and then has to sign... one of his delegees has to sign off on it, so yes, there has to be a determination under those circumstances."
1999.99-312,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1085.804,1087.42,"Very well, Mr. Phillips."
1999.99-312,1,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,1089.135,1096.493,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1999.99-312,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1145.136,1147.345,Where do we find 924?
1999.99-312,1,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,1147.345,1166.27,"It's in the same... 23 C.F.C. 6... part 924 generally describes the process by which you create, or collect the data about the crossings and then crunch it through, and you have a prioritization scheme."
1999.99-312,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1253.468,1255.505,You mean to upgrade even where it's not required?
1999.99-312,1,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,1258.296,1263.024,We upgrade even where it's not specifically required by (b)(3).
1999.99-312,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1263.024,1263.542,Okay.
1999.99-312,1,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,1263.542,1269.131,"We have in Texas about 12,000 public crossings."
1999.99-312,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1269.131,1272.844,"What about number 8,617 on the list?"
1999.99-312,1,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,1300.971,1304.992,"Well, Justice Breyer, that's ultimately the question in this case, who gets to decide that."
1999.99-312,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1304.992,1308.23,"Yes, right, but I mean, you haven't relieved the concern by saying that that is what's there."
1999.99-312,1,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,1313.233,1325.8,"The concern, and the concern expressed in Shots and Shanklin is that the States aren't doing a good job in prioritizing crossings and putting in active devices where the--"
1999.99-312,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1325.8,1326.084,They're doing a great job.
1999.99-312,1,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,1338.93,1343.004,--That simply not the case in Texas or in other States.
1999.99-312,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1343.004,1346.631,"You mean, there's no bad crossing way down on that list that the railroad's never in fault?"
1999.99-312,1,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,1347.641,1353.17,"I'm not saying that there are no bad crossings, but this program is nearly 30 years old."
1999.99-312,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1406.089,1407.357,I'm puzzled about one thing.
1999.99-312,1,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,1414.203,1415.71,--We think it does.
1999.99-312,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1423.784,1425.91,Federal-State without requiring any contribution from the railroads.
1999.99-312,1,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,1425.91,1427.397,--It has worked very well.
1999.99-312,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1427.397,1427.791,Yes.
1999.99-312,1,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,1427.791,1437.492,"The safety statistics have dramatically improved over the past 30 years, and fatality rates have plummeted during the time this project... program--"
1999.99-312,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1437.492,1439.269,But wouldn't that happen no matter which way we decided the case?
1999.99-312,1,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,1439.269,1451.973,"--If the Sixth Circuit determination in this case is correct, that there must be a separate Federal determination regarding the adequacy of all the devices, we think that that will divert resources."
1999.99-312,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1455.251,1457.054,But it will divert the railroad's resources.
1999.99-312,1,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,1458.639,1464.798,"We believe it will divert Federal resources, because it will be the Federal Government that will have to make independent determinations."
1999.99-312,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1471.988,1478.165,"Suppose we just said, where nobody has said it's adequate, under those circum... nobody in authority has said it's adequate."
1999.99-312,1,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,1481.817,1491.881,"--I don't believe you can say nobody has said it's adequate, because in any given year... for instance, if Texas does a State-wide crossings program, it still has two-thirds of that money."
1999.99-312,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1506.798,1510.973,"Mr. Coleman, you seem to be arguing something contrary to what Mr. Phillips argued."
1999.99-312,1,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,1524.366,1525.392,"--No, I think my--"
1999.99-312,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1525.392,1526.869,So how does the scheme work?
1999.99-312,1,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,1526.869,1530.819,"--Justice O'Connor, I believe my argument is entirely consistent with Mr. Phillips."
1999.99-312,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1560.589,1568.654,"I assume he can look through the statistics that you've generated as to the traffic, as to the nearness of high schools and all of that."
1999.99-312,1,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,1568.654,1570.074,"Yes, Justice Scalia."
1999.99-312,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1570.074,1576.797,And on the basis of that determine that this is not a place that in his view requires an automatic signal.
1999.99-312,1,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,1576.797,1586.548,The Secretary has discretion to do as little or as much background check or updating of the State's numbers as he or she wants.
1999.99-312,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1586.548,1593.195,But he has no discretion as to whether or not approval is required.
1999.99-312,1,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,1596.859,1599.542,I believe that the regulation--
1999.99-312,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1599.542,1603.24,"If he accepts it and gives the funding, does that mean that he approves?"
1999.99-312,1,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,1603.24,1612.288,"--Under the regulations, the Secretary may approve, disapprove, the Secretary may qualify approval, the Secretary may condition approval on changes being made."
1999.99-312,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1613.341,1616.682,"May the Secretary do nothing and just say, I... you know, may be good, may be bad."
1999.99-312,1,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,1619.724,1623.396,--I don't think that Federal funds can be used unless there's an approval.
1999.99-312,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1623.396,1632.817,"Well, is that 23 U.S.C. 109 that says that Federal... which is at 40a of the appendix to the petition at the top of the page."
1999.99-312,1,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,1659.883,1664.669,There's some question about whether the text of that provision applies.
1999.99-312,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1683.417,1688.435,On-system meaning a Federal aid highway or a highway affected under chapter 2?
1999.99-312,1,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,1688.435,1689.352,"Yes, Justice Kennedy."
1999.99-312,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1698.382,1699.819,"Thank you, Mr. Coleman."
1999.99-312,1,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,1699.819,1700.214,Thank you.
1999.99-312,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1700.214,1702.752,"Mr. Goldstein, we'll hear from you."
1999.99-312,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1702.752,1711.532,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1999.99-312,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1752.893,1764.567,"Now, the position... your opponents claim that the position that you're asserting here was not the position that you took in the court of appeals, is that correct?"
1999.99-312,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1764.567,1765.039,I'm--
1999.99-312,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1765.039,1767.778,"I mean, as to the outcome of course it is."
1999.99-312,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1767.778,1769.391,You're not representing the Solicitor General.
1999.99-312,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1769.391,1770.566,"--That's correct, I--"
1999.99-312,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1770.566,1771.387,"No, I thought it--"
1999.99-312,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1771.387,1771.773,--But I think Justice Scalia is correct.
1999.99-312,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1772.594,1774.663,"--Yes, I understand who you are."
1999.99-312,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1774.663,1775.019,No--
1999.99-312,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1777.413,1787.773,"And... now, I may be wrong about what's asserted in the opposing briefs, but I thought they asserted that with respect to you it's a new position as well."
1999.99-312,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1789.32,1793.75,I don't understand there to be any tension between our position below and here whatsoever.
1999.99-312,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1803.353,1814.906,"No, but you go along with the Government's division of (3) and (4) into minimums and then those areas where you need on-site inspections to go above the minimums."
1999.99-312,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1816.53,1825.889,"What we explained below is that this is a crossing, if you look at it in terms of (b)(3) and (b)(4), just... let's go to the regulations which are the only ones they're alleged to preempt here--"
1999.99-312,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1825.889,1826.008,Right.
1999.99-312,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1826.008,1848.496,"--Is that at the very least, even if these regulations were applicable, they weren't complied with, because the district court explained that the conditions set out, if we could just turn to the cert petition 47a in the appendix, there's a list of six or seven conditions there, and what the district court said, and we supported that view on appeal, is look, these conditions existed at this crossing."
1999.99-312,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1870.668,1876.223,"Well, I mean, that comes to whether the money could have... can be given."
1999.99-312,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1879.668,1882.694,"--And that is not correct, and let me just get right to the nub of it."
1999.99-312,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1916.294,1920.488,"Now, do you need on-site inspection to determine whether (a), (b), (c), (d), (e) and (f) exist?"
1999.99-312,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1920.488,1920.658,Yes.
1999.99-312,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1922.474,1922.848,Why?
1999.99-312,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1928.422,1928.802,But--
1999.99-312,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1928.802,1929.797,We have all the statistics.
1999.99-312,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1933.731,1935.005,--But (b)(4) is the negative.
1999.99-312,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1964.606,1964.819,Excuse me.
1999.99-312,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1974.482,1975.074,--Some of them.
1999.99-312,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1976.613,1976.882,"Ah, not all of them."
1999.99-312,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1976.882,1978.981,--That there are multiple mainline railroad tracks.
1999.99-312,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1980.768,1982.078,But you can't tell that they don't exist.
1999.99-312,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1982.078,1982.281,No.
1999.99-312,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2022.318,2029.744,"Well, I don't know that we would want to decide this case just on the basis of what an official said about this particular crossing."
1999.99-312,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2029.744,2031.141,"--Mr. Chief Justice, I understand that."
1999.99-312,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2058.138,2076.081,"Well now, this crossing in question was identified as one of I think 196 crossings for which Federal funds were sought, and are you saying that the Secretary approved funds for inadequate safety devices?"
1999.99-312,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2076.081,2079.286,"Let me say first that it is, of course, more than 196."
1999.99-312,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2081.391,2084.744,The 196 list included this one.
1999.99-312,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2084.744,2085.045,--Yes.
1999.99-312,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2085.045,2087.331,Included Oak Church specifically.
1999.99-312,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2087.331,2087.752,Yes.
1999.99-312,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2087.752,2094.484,And the Secretary approved Federal funds for the installation of those devices there.
1999.99-312,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2094.484,2094.87,Yes.
1999.99-312,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2094.87,2101.373,Are you saying that the Federal Government approved funds for the installation of inadequate safety devices?
1999.99-312,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2101.373,2103.011,"Yes, and here is why."
1999.99-312,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2103.011,2103.886,Can it do that?
1999.99-312,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2103.886,2104.754,And it's authorized to do that.
1999.99-312,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2104.754,2105.039,Yes.
1999.99-312,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2105.039,2106.665,"And that's the SG's position, too."
1999.99-312,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2106.665,2107.017,Yes.
1999.99-312,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2107.017,2113.321,"And since he's authorized to do it, I assume they're entitled to those funds whether or not he approves it."
1999.99-312,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2113.321,2114.727,And in fact there's a congressional mandate.
1999.99-312,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2114.727,2119.234,"And you say he can do that consistently with (b)(4), or that (b)(4) is simply inapplicable?"
1999.99-312,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2119.234,2120.784,Or its section 109.
1999.99-312,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2120.784,2124.233,Let me deal with two separate statutes and a regulation.
1999.99-312,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2154.888,2162.071,"But the section also says not just Federal aid highway, or highway affected under chapter 2 of this title."
1999.99-312,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2162.071,2164.6,And chapter 2 is in the main things like Indian lands.
1999.99-312,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2238.293,2251.454,"As I understand it, you're saying the section you just referred to, the quoted section on page... is the one that authorizes the Federal Government to contribute funds even where the situation is inadequate."
1999.99-312,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2254.965,2258.287,"--Mr. Chief Justice, below... the last sentence, at a minimum--"
1999.99-312,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2258.287,2259.347,Would you please give me the page number?
1999.99-312,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2259.347,2261.186,"--I apologize, Justice Kennedy."
1999.99-312,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2324.463,2343.911,"What's bothering me about your side of this is I suspect Justice Scalia was right, and you seem to agree with that, too, that it's pretty hard to read the reg (b)(4) as talking about... the way I wanted to read it, I think that's not really possible, so you just say, well, look, (b)(4) doesn't apply at all."
1999.99-312,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2343.911,2344.957,That's right.
1999.99-312,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2344.957,2345.742,Nor does (b)(3).
1999.99-312,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2376.698,2383.162,"Well, the truth of the matter is that every single State has this program, and every single State has taken money under it."
1999.99-312,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2383.162,2385.402,"Well, are there some regs on this other program, for example?"
1999.99-312,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2385.919,2388.718,There is a directive from the Federal Highway Administration.
1999.99-312,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2424.374,2429.027,"I get that point, but does it say somewhere that (b)(4) doesn't apply to that kind of a program?"
1999.99-312,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2429.027,2432.332,"--No, because (b)(3) is... and (b)--"
1999.99-312,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2432.332,2432.819,Not (b)(3).
1999.99-312,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2434.32,2435.246,"--Just Breyer, if I could just--"
1999.99-312,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2435.246,2435.788,Does it say somewhere (b)(4)--
1999.99-312,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2435.788,2441.588,"--point out, as Easterwood twice explains, (b)(4) is just... is triggered only by (b)(3)."
1999.99-312,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2446.945,2458.88,"--Mr. Goldstein, the section you just read, which in your brief you say the Federal Highway Administration explained in 1974, and then it's cited FHMP."
1999.99-312,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2463.762,2465.954,It's the Federal Highway Program Manual.
1999.99-312,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2465.954,2466.585,Can you answer my question?
1999.99-312,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2466.585,2467.801,It is not a regulation.
1999.99-312,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2473.435,2479.432,"Well now, that certainly doesn't have nearly the status that a regulation issued by the Secretary would."
1999.99-312,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2479.432,2486.821,"--As a matter of deference to the Secretary that may well be true, Mr. Chief Justice, but let me just tell you what really is at issue."
1999.99-312,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2511.29,2516.518,"Well, how could something that was issued in 1974 explain what happened in the eighties or nineties?"
1999.99-312,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2516.518,2519.908,"--Because this was the guidance that they issued, and this is the guidance--"
1999.99-312,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2519.908,2520.143,Well--
1999.99-312,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2520.143,2522.261,"--The regulation, for example, Mr. Chief Justice--"
1999.99-312,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2522.261,2524.071,"--Well, just a minute, Mr. Goldstein."
1999.99-312,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2537.094,2548.733,"--Just as the regulation was issued in 1975, this is the guidance that the agency gave in response to the statute, and it hasn't been repealed in any sense, Mr. Chief Justice."
1999.99-312,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2605.901,2619.365,"Well, it wouldn't prevent the State, would it, from coming back later and saying this crossing deserves a better mechanism and we're going to use some of the Federal money, or at least propose to use it, to upgrade?"
1999.99-312,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2619.365,2620.67,--That would be the only way.
1999.99-312,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2621.672,2622.657,But that could be done.
1999.99-312,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2622.657,2633.897,"--They could, but for example, Justice O'Connor, what they could not do would be to come in and say, we've determined that several thousand crossings actually need a fourth or a fifth warning sign."
1999.99-312,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2644.068,2646.657,You were saying that what the State did not do here was?
1999.99-312,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2646.657,2653.244,What they did not do is send out anyone on their own or on behalf of the Federal Government as the delegatee under the--
1999.99-312,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2653.244,2657.073,"Well, isn't that disputed by some later lodging, the Cantrell deposition?"
1999.99-312,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2657.073,2662.011,"--There is one letter that is not in the record, but it does not dispute my point."
1999.99-312,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2667.196,2674.268,"I thought Farris was an employee of the Tennessee Department of Transportation, and he wrote that after he visited the crossing no signs were needed."
1999.99-312,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2678.336,2684.815,"--Justice Kennedy, what (b)(3) and (b)(4) require is someone go out and determine what warning devices are necessary."
1999.99-312,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2720.715,2725.043,"Mr. Goldstein, you know, normally when we interpret a statute it's interpreted."
1999.99-312,3,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2910.614,2925.279,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1999.99-312,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2951.333,2954.667,"Ms. Millett, would this have been relevant to our decision in Easterwood?"
1999.99-312,3,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2954.667,2963.208,Easterwood was so far beyond the minimum program... it was a situation where individual study had already been done--
1999.99-312,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2963.208,2972.744,"Whether there are two programs, a minimum program and then some supplemental program, was certainly relevant to the preemption decision in Easterwood, wasn't it?"
1999.99-312,3,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2972.744,2975.175,"--Well, it wasn't remotely at issue in the case."
1999.99-312,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2977.161,2983.309,"Well, it was at issue... it was relevant to the general issue of preemption and when preemption occurs."
1999.99-312,3,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2983.309,2990.188,--There are an awful lot of highway programs that are covered and administered by the Secretary.
1999.99-312,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3004.293,3004.423,Did you--
1999.99-312,3,38150,patricia_a_millett,,3004.423,3007.701,"We did do that in our brief, but we did not go on at length about this program."
1999.99-312,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3016.414,3021.919,"--Well, they're saying for 25 years we thought (b)(3) and (b)(4) governed this minimal... we're not saying there wasn't some minimal thing."
1999.99-312,3,38150,patricia_a_millett,,3031.591,3034.681,"--Absolutely, and the first thing is the practice of the State."
1999.99-312,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3045.792,3046.163,"So they say sometimes you do, sometimes you don't."
1999.99-312,3,38150,patricia_a_millett,,3062.296,3070.481,--For purposes of a (b)(3) and (b)(4) determin... because you're not going to get the money from the Secretary unless you submit an engineering study of that individual crossing.
1999.99-312,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3123.98,3124.996,They need the Secretary's approval--
1999.99-312,3,38150,patricia_a_millett,,3124.996,3125.157,That didn't happen.
1999.99-312,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3125.157,3126.733,--for minimal program expenditure.
1999.99-312,3,38150,patricia_a_millett,,3126.733,3128.546,They need the Secretary's approval for that--
1999.99-312,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3128.546,3129.333,And what says that?
1999.99-312,3,38150,patricia_a_millett,,3129.333,3137.232,"--The... well, first of all, 23 C.F.R. part 630 addresses the general need for a Secretary's authorization for Federal funds."
1999.99-312,3,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3137.232,3137.491,What--
1999.99-312,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3137.491,3138.559,--Where is that?
1999.99-312,3,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3138.559,3140.275,Where do we find what you're talking about now?
1999.99-312,3,38150,patricia_a_millett,,3140.275,3141.414,I don't believe it's reproduced in the briefs.
1999.99-312,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3154.283,3155.817,"You see, this is why I have some sympathy for the railroad."
1999.99-312,3,38150,patricia_a_millett,,3159.781,3161.124,--It's not that it's a separate program.
1999.99-312,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3168.698,3169.302,Ms. Millett--
1999.99-312,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3169.302,3171.634,"--You're making a distinction between authorized and approval, then."
1999.99-312,3,38150,patricia_a_millett,,3174.335,3174.745,Uh-huh.
1999.99-312,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3174.745,3194.421,But approval relates to a specific crossing.
1999.99-312,3,38150,patricia_a_millett,,3196.112,3198.081,"Unfortunately I'm not even... that's... those aren't the words, either."
1999.99-312,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3210.931,3211.457,But you authorized something.
1999.99-312,3,38150,patricia_a_millett,,3212.102,3212.395,--Right.
1999.99-312,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3213.058,3213.483,--the spending of Federal funds.
1999.99-312,3,38150,patricia_a_millett,,3213.483,3214.762,There's two things that we can approve.
1999.99-312,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3236.333,3236.606,Okay.
1999.99-312,3,38150,patricia_a_millett,,3237.125,3238.595,"--but it doesn't make it adequate, and this is... I'm sorry."
1999.99-312,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3238.595,3240.18,"--No, I... finish your sentence."
1999.99-312,3,38150,patricia_a_millett,,3240.18,3261.87,"I just want to say, this is... we have a directly different response to your question to Mr. Phillips, and that was does the Secretary have the ability to approve just a Federal minimum program that doesn't determine what is adequate, and that, yes we have the ability because Congress said so in 23 U.S.C. 130(d), so that is the exception to the normal rule."
1999.99-312,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3269.933,3270.282,All right.
1999.99-312,3,38150,patricia_a_millett,,3368.286,3369.21,Two answers.
1999.99-312,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3403.12,3411.634,But there's no question that when the minimal sawbuck signs are installed the purpose of installing them is to make the crossing safe.
1999.99-312,3,38150,patricia_a_millett,,3411.634,3412.038,--No--
1999.99-312,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3412.038,3414.275,"It may not succeed, but that's the purpose."
1999.99-312,3,38150,patricia_a_millett,,3414.275,3420.397,"--NO, it is not to make that crossing safe in the same way that State tort law makes that crossing safe, or any State law--"
1999.99-312,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3420.397,3420.729,No--
1999.99-312,3,38150,patricia_a_millett,,3420.729,3421.799,--that makes a crossing safe.
1999.99-312,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3424.736,3424.961,--Okay.
1999.99-312,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3431.885,3432.483,Ms. Millett--
1999.99-312,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3432.483,3437.389,--Do you distinguish between making a crossing safe and making it less unsafe?
1999.99-312,3,38150,patricia_a_millett,,3437.389,3450.238,"--Well, what... for purposes of (b)(3) and (b)(4) what adequate warning devices are, are designed to address what makes an individual crossing safe in the same way that State law had for hundreds of years before."
1999.99-312,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3470.241,3472.365,"That might have been the holding, but that was not our general language."
1999.99-312,3,38150,patricia_a_millett,,3523.029,3523.791,May I answer?
1999.99-312,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3523.791,3524.361,"Yes, you may."
1999.99-312,3,38150,patricia_a_millett,,3524.361,3528.584,Because (b)(3) and (b)(4)... (b)(4) is a direct outgrowth of (b)(3).
1999.99-312,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3542.606,3543.92,"Thank you, Ms. Millett."
1999.99-312,4,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3547.34,3552.922,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1999.99-312,4,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3629.977,3643.258,"--that the floor is in the regulations, that there's no lack of statutory authority for the Secretary to do what Mr. Goldstein contends the Secretary did do?"
1999.99-312,4,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3643.258,3667.161,"I think there's clearly statutory authority, and I think it's important to recognize that (b)(3) and (b)(4) are designed to implement 109, which is what's going to preserve the Government's ability to decide what safe, and what it's going to fund, and if the Secretary chooses to apply that in a different way, that's fine, but that's not the system that the Secretary employed in this particular case, and it's not the system the Court identified in Easterwood."
1999.99-312,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3667.161,3671.055,What do you do with the argument that 109 only applies to Federal aid highways?
1999.99-312,4,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3671.055,3679.531,"109... well, first of all, there's a serious question about whether they intend that, but the bottom line about 109 is, the regulation still implements 109."
1999.99-312,4,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3688.198,3688.568,"Thank you, Mr. Phillips."
