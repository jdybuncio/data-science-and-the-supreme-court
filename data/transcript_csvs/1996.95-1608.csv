1996.95-1608,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.427,"We'll hear argument next in Number 95-1608, Michele Timmons v. The Twin Cities Area New Party."
1996.95-1608,0,40497,richard_s_slowes,,19.675,27.318,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1996.95-1608,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,116.747,120.1,Somebody else's candidate that is already there.
1996.95-1608,0,40497,richard_s_slowes,,125.102,138.733,"In this instance what happens is, and what really controls here, Justice Scalia, is that the candidate must file an affidavit of candidacy, and on the affidavit of candidacy he must indicate his political party."
1996.95-1608,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,138.733,139.352,--Yes.
1996.95-1608,0,40497,richard_s_slowes,,139.352,146.957,"In this instance, Representative Dawkins had filed an affidavit of candidacy for the Democratic-Farmer-Labor primary."
1996.95-1608,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,153.901,160.396,"What if the New Party had filed... well, the same thing would happen if the New Party had... what if the New Party had put up Dawkins first?"
1996.95-1608,0,40497,richard_s_slowes,,166.489,169.602,If Representative Dawkins had said yes--
1996.95-1608,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,169.602,171.155,To the New Party?
1996.95-1608,0,40497,richard_s_slowes,,171.155,177.317,"--I'll file this affidavit of candidacy listing the New Party as my party, filed it with the county officials--"
1996.95-1608,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,177.317,181.32,I presume he would not have done that if he wanted to be elected.
1996.95-1608,0,40497,richard_s_slowes,,187.484,190.265,"--I would presume that's so, Mr. Chief Justice."
1996.95-1608,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,199.602,201.502,What if he sent both in at the same time?
1996.95-1608,0,40497,richard_s_slowes,,202.333,205.465,"--Your Honor, that would not be permitted by the law."
1996.95-1608,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,208.268,210.769,What is the State interest in preventing that from happening?
1996.95-1608,0,40497,richard_s_slowes,,210.769,222.937,"--The State interests are multiple, Justice Stevens, and what they have to do with, a number of issues that this Court has recognized as compelling State interests, although we don't believe that the Court has to conclude that they're compelling in this instance."
1996.95-1608,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,243.05,248.763,I guess you could have instructions on the ballot telling people what to do in that event.
1996.95-1608,0,40497,richard_s_slowes,,248.763,252.737,"Justice O'Connor, in fact that's kind of the narrow tailoring that the Eighth Circuit suggested for that."
1996.95-1608,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,253.528,264.425,"But that would be possible, I guess, to have instructions along with a ballot that did permit parties to name the same person as their candidate."
1996.95-1608,0,40497,richard_s_slowes,,264.425,265.673,"--Yes, Your Honor, it would be possible."
1996.95-1608,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,265.673,272.459,"Or, indeed, I suppose you could count the vote whether you voted on one line, two lines, or either, or both."
1996.95-1608,0,40497,richard_s_slowes,,272.459,273.5,"Your Honor, that would--"
1996.95-1608,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,273.5,277.821,I... it seems to me you have to be pretty dense to be confused on this one.
1996.95-1608,0,40497,richard_s_slowes,,278.762,286.229,"--Well, apparently some voters in Connecticut were, Your Honor, and one of the issues in the recount was how do you deal with the ballots where there are multiple markings."
1996.95-1608,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,286.229,297.857,"Yes, but are we supposed to erase from our mind that there is at least one State that has had a lot of experience with fusion candidates, and there's no large confusion."
1996.95-1608,0,40497,richard_s_slowes,,310.193,312.135,"That's indeed the case, Your Honor."
1996.95-1608,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,312.135,313.364,"New Yorkers are smarter, I think."
1996.95-1608,0,40497,richard_s_slowes,,314.796,320.581,"I think that I have to be careful, if I'm going back to Minnesota, about making that argument, Your Honor."
1996.95-1608,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,333.7,338.033,How many States have these antifusion laws like your State?
1996.95-1608,0,40497,richard_s_slowes,,338.033,339.762,"There are approximately 40, Your Honor."
1996.95-1608,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,345.388,348.477,And most of them have been in effect how many years?
1996.95-1608,0,40497,richard_s_slowes,,348.477,354.791,"Roughly since the turn of the century, Your Honor, so there's not a broad range of empirical evidence, but there's also--"
1996.95-1608,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,354.791,363.137,"What's your answer to the suggestion that someone made here that, assuming somebody gets confused and votes twice, all the State has to do is count it once?"
1996.95-1608,0,40497,richard_s_slowes,,367.902,375.126,--Because we can't be certain that the ballot is going to be easily understandable in terms of what they really intended to do.
1996.95-1608,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,375.126,383.382,"Well, if they marked... if Joe Doaks is running on two lines and they mark Joe Doaks on each line, isn't it a fair inference that they want Doaks?"
1996.95-1608,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,385.243,397.962,"Don't you have to know what party they voted for Doaks on in order to determine who gets on the ballot without having to go through a petition process the next time around, or not?"
1996.95-1608,0,40497,richard_s_slowes,,397.962,398.65,Justice Scalia--
1996.95-1608,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,398.65,400.733,Is there any minimum party size?
1996.95-1608,0,40497,richard_s_slowes,,400.733,406.117,"--In the circumstances of this case, which was a legislative election for a legislative seat--"
1996.95-1608,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,406.117,406.858,Right.
1996.95-1608,0,40497,richard_s_slowes,,406.858,409.94,--the vote count has no effect on the future party status.
1996.95-1608,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,409.94,410.48,Okay.
1996.95-1608,0,40497,richard_s_slowes,,410.48,417.333,"Those... only Statewide elections count in Minnesota for major party status, so that's really not an issue here."
1996.95-1608,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,417.333,419.265,"Well, but I take it the argument--"
1996.95-1608,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,419.265,423.118,"--But that argument would be a valid argument in other elections, although not in this one?"
1996.95-1608,0,40497,richard_s_slowes,,423.118,431.692,"If it were a Statewide election there would be that issue, and then the State would have the question of how are we going to appropriately deal with this issue."
1996.95-1608,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,431.692,436.927,"But I take it the respondent's argument would address a Statewide election if the respondent prevails, would it not?"
1996.95-1608,0,40497,richard_s_slowes,,436.927,444.652,"It... they claim that it does not, Your Honor, because there are three statutes that are... affect fusion in Minnesota."
1996.95-1608,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,461.412,467.847,"And then there would be a problem with determining the amount of votes garnered for each party, or a potential problem."
1996.95-1608,0,40497,richard_s_slowes,,467.847,479.334,"--The State would have to retune its system, figure out how it is going to deal with the issue of how you count the votes for a major party, along with the issues such as are we going to have an aggregated or a disaggregated ballot."
1996.95-1608,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,484.248,487.619,But why are these such difficult issues for the State to deal with?
1996.95-1608,0,40497,richard_s_slowes,,523.212,552.901,"Your Honor, I'm not suggesting that the State's ability or inability to figure out how it wants to count these votes toward major party status is the preeminent interest that justifies the fusion ban, but I think it illustrates a slightly different point, and that is, what goes into creating a fair and orderly and efficient electoral process involves a lot of judgments, essentially a lot of political engineering about how the pieces of the system will work together."
1996.95-1608,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,558.014,559.906,"If that's not the preeminent interest, what is the preeminent interest?"
1996.95-1608,0,40497,richard_s_slowes,,564.098,571.064,"--The justifications... I think voter confusion is an interest, Your Honor, and that's a side point of it."
1996.95-1608,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,571.064,579.089,May I ask with respect to voter confusion if that is not offset by voter information?
1996.95-1608,0,40497,richard_s_slowes,,624.419,626.981,"Justice Ginsburg, our position is not that it's irrelevant."
1996.95-1608,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,656.86,661.332,I'm interested in Justice Stevens' question.
1996.95-1608,0,40497,richard_s_slowes,,695.756,697.356,"I'm sorry, Justice Kennedy, I--"
1996.95-1608,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,697.356,699.569,"Well, you've had a number of questions, but--"
1996.95-1608,0,40497,richard_s_slowes,,699.569,701.34,--And I... let me try to address that.
1996.95-1608,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,723.733,729.847,--But that bogus minor party would have to meet all the State statutory requirements for becoming a party eligible to get on the ballot.
1996.95-1608,0,40497,richard_s_slowes,,729.847,731.57,"--That's correct, Justice Stevens, and--"
1996.95-1608,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,731.57,736.922,"And so they would be splintering their own strength by going out of the way to create another party, wouldn't they, and has this ever happened?"
1996.95-1608,0,40497,richard_s_slowes,,736.922,739.585,"--Let me go back to the first question, Your Honor."
1996.95-1608,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,741.655,741.925,Right.
1996.95-1608,0,40497,richard_s_slowes,,741.925,742.516,--to get on the ballot.
1996.95-1608,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,747.179,747.479,Right.
1996.95-1608,0,40497,richard_s_slowes,,747.479,748.551,--to get someone on the ballot.
1996.95-1608,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,754.543,758.106,And you're saying a major party would do that why?
1996.95-1608,0,40497,richard_s_slowes,,758.106,797.991,"--Because major party candidates might very well, if they're, for example... this wasn't the case with Mr. Dawkins, but if they're in a case, an election where they do have a tough contest with an opposing major party, they might decide that it's to their advantage either to have their name on the ballot more than one time, or they might even prefer to have their name on the ballot not only as a Democratic candidate, but also as the no-new-taxes candidate, and the tough-on-crime candidate, and the fusion system, especially in a State like Minnesota that is friendly to minor parties getting on the ballot and makes it easy to do it, opens the door for that kind of ballot manipulation."
1996.95-1608,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,797.991,800.583,Would you explain how the Minnesota system works?
1996.95-1608,0,40497,richard_s_slowes,,806.978,808.229,There are--
1996.95-1608,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,808.229,811.542,Or getting on the general election ballot?
1996.95-1608,0,40497,richard_s_slowes,,819.226,822.469,"--Justice O'Connor, there are two ways to get on the ballot in Minnesota."
1996.95-1608,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,831.174,841.73,"But this... this party, the Twin Cities Area New Party, did not have to go on the primary election ballot, is that right?"
1996.95-1608,0,40497,richard_s_slowes,,841.73,842.441,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1996.95-1608,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,848.044,853.938,"And if you're everything else, how do you get past the primary and on the general election ballot?"
1996.95-1608,0,40497,richard_s_slowes,,853.938,856.8,--To get on the ballot you're required to file a nominating petition.
1996.95-1608,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,856.8,858.943,You mean on the general election ballot?
1996.95-1608,0,40497,richard_s_slowes,,858.943,859.815,On the general election ballot.
1996.95-1608,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,864.015,865.686,But the major parties can't do that.
1996.95-1608,0,40497,richard_s_slowes,,865.686,866.087,Major--
1996.95-1608,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,866.087,867.088,They go through a primary.
1996.95-1608,0,40497,richard_s_slowes,,867.088,868.04,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1996.95-1608,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,877.773,883.397,"So all we're talking about here is access to the general election ballot, in effect."
1996.95-1608,0,40497,richard_s_slowes,,883.397,884.809,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1996.95-1608,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,884.809,893.715,And whether the minor party can nominate the same candidate as some other party--
1996.95-1608,0,40497,richard_s_slowes,,893.715,894.806,That's--
1996.95-1608,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,894.806,896.519,--who's gotten there by primary election.
1996.95-1608,0,40497,richard_s_slowes,,896.519,899.21,"--That's all we're talking about, Your Honor, that's correct."
1996.95-1608,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,918.121,923.925,May I put another question to you that... what concerns me in the background?
1996.95-1608,0,40497,richard_s_slowes,,947.441,953.515,"Your Honor, their interests again are as I've started... tried to be telling you."
1996.95-1608,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,953.515,953.836,Excuse me.
1996.95-1608,0,40497,richard_s_slowes,,955.448,955.806,They--
1996.95-1608,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,955.806,957.058,Not in Minnesota--
1996.95-1608,0,40497,richard_s_slowes,,961.761,963.842,--It all depends on the nomenclature you're using.
1996.95-1608,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1772.133,1782.018,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1996.95-1608,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1825.307,1827.418,Maybe New Yorkers like confusion.
1996.95-1608,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1827.818,1828.547,"--Well, that may be."
