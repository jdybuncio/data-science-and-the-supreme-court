1996.95-966,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,13.951,"We'll hear argument now in Number 95-966, Kevin O'Gilvie and Stephanie O'Gilvie, Minors v. United States, and 95-977, Kelly O'Gilvie v. The United States."
1996.95-966,0,41786,stephen_r_mcallister,,15.343,24.73,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1996.95-966,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,114.221,124.877,"Well, of course, you've now used the term, in connection with, but the statute says on account of, and it's my impression the Government's position is that punitive damages are not on account of the personal injuries."
1996.95-966,0,41786,stephen_r_mcallister,,124.877,129.781,"That is certainly the Government's contention, Your Honor, and we believe that's wrong for several reasons."
1996.95-966,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,329.434,330.346,Where is that set forth?
1996.95-966,0,41786,stephen_r_mcallister,,338.423,342.136,"--There's an '89 amendment, Your Honor, which altered the scope of the original."
1996.95-966,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,367.166,381.705,"--Well, of course, you know, when I read the United States Code I don't do it piece by piece and figure out which paragraph was enacted in 1918 and which was enacted in 1989, or 1996."
1996.95-966,0,41786,stephen_r_mcallister,,391.202,393.032,"Well, I think that's correct."
1996.95-966,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,393.032,395.105,I'd like to see the whole thing set forth somewhere.
1996.95-966,0,41786,stephen_r_mcallister,,407.584,411.798,"It's certainly not, Your Honor, in terms of resolving the statutory interpretation issue present here."
1996.95-966,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,436.236,438.728,And what about the '89 amendment?
1996.95-966,0,41786,stephen_r_mcallister,,441.442,459.514,"The '89 amendment was prospective, but it's important, because what the '89 amendment does, it can be read two ways, but what the lower courts have strongly endorsed is the view that what Congress understood at the time was that all punitive damages as of 1989 were excludable under section 104."
1996.95-966,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,483.342,485.652,"Mr. McAllister, I don't understand your reference to lower courts."
1996.95-966,0,41786,stephen_r_mcallister,,509.338,520.658,"--I don't believe that's correct, and certainly most of the cases come after the 1989 amendment, and what I'm suggesting is that the lower courts have, when they've decided these cases, looked at that amendment and said, what--"
1996.95-966,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,520.658,527.743,"What circuit, other than the Sixth Circuit, has ruled in favor of taxpayers on these challenges?"
1996.95-966,0,41786,stephen_r_mcallister,,527.743,532.177,--You're right in that no circuit other than the Sixth Circuit has ruled in favor of taxpayers.
1996.95-966,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,535.269,538.043,"But the tax court is subject... has the Skolson rule, so--"
1996.95-966,0,41786,stephen_r_mcallister,,538.043,539.423,Was reversed by circuits on further review.
1996.95-966,1,34672,linda_d_king,,1019.721,1022.605,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1996.95-966,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1134.557,1137.32,Was Schleier a liquidated damages?
1996.95-966,1,34672,linda_d_king,,1137.32,1139.16,"--It's my understanding that it was, Your Honor."
1996.95-966,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1240.914,1250.75,"But any time there's a dissenting opinion taking a different view of the statute, that's a sign that the statute is ambiguous?"
1996.95-966,1,34672,linda_d_king,,1250.75,1254.883,"Mr. Chief Justice, I would not go that far as to say that."
1996.95-966,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1254.883,1258.326,"But if three out of nine dissent, then it's ambiguous?"
1996.95-966,1,34672,linda_d_king,,1258.326,1260.229,"Again, Your Honor, I would not say that."
1996.95-966,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1261.201,1262.343,How about four out of nine?
1996.95-966,1,34672,linda_d_king,,1266.466,1271.669,"--No, my position is that it is, ambiguous out of context of the original steps."
1996.95-966,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1271.669,1274.892,But didn't all those circuits read it in context?
1996.95-966,1,34672,linda_d_king,,1277.286,1290.182,"Each of those circuits determined that it first was ambiguous, and then read it in a very tunnel vision fashion, only the language of the current statute, section 104(a)(2) as written."
1996.95-966,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1301.589,1304.681,"You're going to tell us why you win if it's ambiguous, aren't you?"
1996.95-966,1,34672,linda_d_king,,1304.681,1305.242,Yes.
1996.95-966,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1305.242,1305.913,Okay.
1996.95-966,1,34672,linda_d_king,,1309.205,1316.962,"The very nature of a patent structural ambiguity is that it has two distinct, clear, and mutually exclusive meanings."
1996.95-966,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1403.169,1407.022,"Well, why would you want a clear intent to exclude?"
1996.95-966,1,34672,linda_d_king,,1416.137,1417.326,"Yes, that is correct."
1996.95-966,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1419.059,1420.72,"But that works against you, doesn't it?"
1996.95-966,1,34672,linda_d_king,,1443.574,1464.758,"--My argument is that in the face of an ambiguity, that you need to look to the intent of Congress before you decide in favor of the Government, and if there is clear and reliable evidence... clear and reliable evidence... that there was an intent to exclude, that should control before a default rule."
1996.95-966,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1464.758,1467.911,"I thought the conclusion you were going to come to was, then there is no ambiguity."
1996.95-966,1,34672,linda_d_king,,1467.911,1469.373,I'm sorry.
1996.95-966,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1469.984,1473.036,"In which case, it seems to me your case would be a lot easier."
1996.95-966,1,34672,linda_d_king,,1473.036,1473.497,Well--
1996.95-966,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1473.497,1475.487,Aren't you basically saying there's no ambiguity?
1996.95-966,1,34672,linda_d_king,,1475.487,1476.979,--Yes.
1996.95-966,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1498.754,1505.188,"You say the words are ambiguous, but if you take the history together with the words, then there's no ambiguity."
1996.95-966,1,34672,linda_d_king,,1505.589,1513.984,"I think the words taken out of context, a short phrase taken out of the context of its original statute are ambiguous without its context."
1996.95-966,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1513.984,1516.207,"--Well, we don't interpret things out of context."
1996.95-966,1,34672,linda_d_king,,1522.083,1531.429,The appellate courts that have looked at this have given no regard to the original statute.
1996.95-966,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1531.429,1532.741,So you say they were wrong.
1996.95-966,1,34672,linda_d_king,,1532.741,1533.681,I say they were wrong.
1996.95-966,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1533.681,1535.633,Because they were taking it out of context--
1996.95-966,1,34672,linda_d_king,,1535.633,1535.984,Yes.
1996.95-966,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1535.984,1542.577,"--right, and ambiguity out of context doesn't apply, right, doesn't count?"
1996.95-966,1,34672,linda_d_king,,1542.577,1544.769,"That's... out of context, it doesn't count."
1996.95-966,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1573.469,1575.051,"Thank you, Ms. King."
1996.95-966,1,34672,linda_d_king,,1575.051,1575.422,--Thank you.
1996.95-966,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1575.422,1578.044,"Mr. Jones, we'll hear from you."
1996.95-966,2,33864,kent_l_jones,,1578.044,1583.276,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1996.95-966,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1779.3,1790.657,What if we... what if this came up from a State where the supreme court had said something else about... something more favorable to the petitioners about the nature of exemplary damages?
1996.95-966,2,33864,kent_l_jones,,1790.657,1802.785,"--Sometimes, if you will, writing it in academic fashion, courts look at the fact that these moneys go to the plaintiff and say, perhaps they serve a compensatory purpose in that respect."
1996.95-966,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1921.368,1941.453,"In Schleier we also said that whether one treats respondents attaining the age of 60, or his being laid off on account of his age, as the proximate cause of respondent's loss of income, neither the birthday nor the discharge can fairly be described as a personal injury or sickness."
1996.95-966,2,33864,kent_l_jones,,1946.595,1955.852,"It is a... it is the... it is the explanation of why those damages aren't on account of the personal injury, but the Court said--"
1996.95-966,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1955.852,1958.754,There was no personal injury is what we were saying.
1996.95-966,2,33864,kent_l_jones,,1958.754,1976.135,"--No, I believe, Justice Scalia, that what the Court acknowledged in Schleier was that age discrimination, the but-for, but for age discrimination these recoveries would not have been obtained, but the Court pointed out that these recoveries were not on account of that personal injury that stems from the age discrimination."
1996.95-966,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1985.201,1996.4,"That sentence suggests to me that we thought that the gravamen of the complaint was not personal injury or sickness, and that's a totally different point from whether it was on account of or not."
1996.95-966,2,33864,kent_l_jones,,1996.4,1997.429,"Well, but that's the point."
1996.95-966,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2006.317,2017.594,"You're... but it has to be on account of personal injury or sickness, but you're laying Schleier before us as though what it proves is that there was no on account of there, which is what this case involves."
1996.95-966,2,33864,kent_l_jones,,2017.594,2017.824,That there was not--
1996.95-966,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2017.824,2022.077,But really what I think it proves is that there was no physical injury or sickness there.
1996.95-966,2,33864,kent_l_jones,,2022.077,2036.289,"--Actually, I... Justice Scalia, we... only by reference to the opinion can this question be answered, but my recollection of the opinion is that the Court acknowledged in Schleier that age discrimination effects personal injuries."
1996.95-966,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2135.189,2139.751,"Mr. Jones, I think you're coming to your... before you leave, I'd like you to comment on the 1989 amendment."
1996.95-966,2,33864,kent_l_jones,,2154.063,2163.439,"--That's a difficult hypothetical, but if it had been in the statute from the beginning with the history that it had, my answer would be that it does not affect the outcome in this case."
1996.95-966,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2177.561,2187.425,"But is it not a fair reading of it, as your opponent argues, to suggest that the Congress that enacted that amendment must have assumed that punitive... this sort of punitive damages were excludable?"
1996.95-966,2,33864,kent_l_jones,,2187.425,2191.168,--It is neither factually nor legally a fair reading of the statute.
1996.95-966,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2217.396,2217.677,Let me make--
1996.95-966,2,33864,kent_l_jones,,2226.054,2226.101,--No.
1996.95-966,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2247.689,2248.41,This isn't a negative inference.
1996.95-966,2,33864,kent_l_jones,,2263.89,2265.653,"But that's not the way it's written, Justice Scalia."
1996.95-966,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2266.942,2268.204,Where is the text?
1996.95-966,2,33864,kent_l_jones,,2272.207,2273.689,"--Yes, I'm sure that it is."
1996.95-966,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2273.689,2296.383,The way Justice Blackmun described it in Burke was that the enactment allowed exclusion of punitive damages only in cases involving physical injury or physical sickness.
1996.95-966,2,33864,kent_l_jones,,2296.383,2298.797,"What... at page 30 of our brief, Justice Scalia--"
1996.95-966,3,41786,stephen_r_mcallister,,3242.872,3244.373,"No, I don't, Your Honor."
1996.95-966,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3269.87,3274.725,You did admit that the refund was made on July 9 in the answer to the complaint.
1996.95-966,3,41786,stephen_r_mcallister,,3274.725,3278.177,What the stipulation says is the amounts were refunded.
1996.95-966,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3280.987,3285.371,"Well, but your answer to the complaint is not inconsistent with that stip."
1996.95-966,3,41786,stephen_r_mcallister,,3288.382,3291.296,--The amount was refunded on July 9.
1996.95-966,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3316.162,3319.735,"Well, you wouldn't make that argument if you never received the check, would you?"
1996.95-966,3,41786,stephen_r_mcallister,,3319.735,3321.505,--No.
1996.95-966,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3325.339,3327.96,"The Government wouldn't be suing to get it back, either--"
1996.95-966,3,41786,stephen_r_mcallister,,3327.96,3328.17,--That's right.
1996.95-966,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3329.071,3329.241,--if you never received it.
1996.95-966,3,41786,stephen_r_mcallister,,3333.493,3334.184,It might.
1996.95-966,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3334.184,3336.056,Do you know how it works with a private company?
1996.95-966,3,41786,stephen_r_mcallister,,3336.056,3337.868,"With a private company, I do not, Your Honor."
1996.95-966,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3339.84,3341.533,"So that might be the right rule, but nobody's... we haven't looked it up yet."
1996.95-966,3,41786,stephen_r_mcallister,,3341.533,3341.813,Right.
1996.95-966,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3347.757,3351.788,Was it just oversight that you didn't bring this up in the first instance?
1996.95-966,3,41786,stephen_r_mcallister,,3351.788,3352.889,"--In the first instance, yes, Your Honor."
1996.95-966,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3366.4,3371.181,"All of these tax years were all before 1989 though, weren't they?"
1996.95-966,3,41786,stephen_r_mcallister,,3371.181,3371.392,--Right.
1996.95-966,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3371.392,3377.787,So in fact the way the law read at the time that's relevant here did not contain the 1989 amendment.
1996.95-966,3,41786,stephen_r_mcallister,,3377.787,3378.418,Correct.
1996.95-966,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3378.418,3379.907,"Thank you, Mr. McAllister."
1996.95-966,3,41786,stephen_r_mcallister,,3379.907,3380.097,Thank you.
1996.95-966,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3380.097,3381.68,The case is submitted.
