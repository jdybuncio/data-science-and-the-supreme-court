1960.18,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,8.804,"-- States, Appellant, versus John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Company, et al."
1960.18,0,25167,george_cochran_doub,,14.823,18.08,"Mr. Chief Justice, members of the Court."
1960.18,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,363.616,370.401,"Could there have been a valid foreclosure under Kansas law without making the United States a party, a valid foreclosure against (Inaudible)"
1960.18,0,25167,george_cochran_doub,,370.401,371.867,No.
1960.18,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,394.909,395.828,That's what I'm getting at.
1960.18,0,25167,george_cochran_doub,,395.828,418.069,"That -- that's -- now, in our answer when we were brought into this case, we set up our debt, we asserted, we asked that our claim be recognized as a second lien, that any excess mortgage proceeds derived from sale and you are -- to our benefit."
1960.18,1,27248,harry_l_hobson,,1528.066,1531.757,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1960.18,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1730.563,1734.371,Regardless of what (Inaudible) it was.
1960.18,1,27248,harry_l_hobson,,1734.371,1743.38,"Mr. Justice Frankfurter, the act of Congress related to appearance in the foreclosure portion of this action."
1960.18,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1759.156,1764.718,And no relation to the property of the (Inaudible) trying to have its redemption rights.
1960.18,1,27248,harry_l_hobson,,1764.718,1772.172,Those three notes had no relation whatsoever concerning the property that we're now talking about.
1960.18,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1778.058,1782.991,But it was seeking the redemptive rights on the basis of those notes.
1960.18,1,27248,harry_l_hobson,,1782.991,1786.907,It is seeking the redemptive right on the basis of all four notes.
1960.18,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1801.676,1811.147,"Would you have any quarrel with the Government, Mr. Hobson if the -- if they were just insisting upon their actual lien on the property (Voice Overlap) --"
1960.18,1,27248,harry_l_hobson,,1811.147,1814.179,"We would still quarrel with the Government Your Honor, although I --"
1960.18,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1814.179,1816.118,You would still be in a quarrel with them?
1960.18,1,27248,harry_l_hobson,,1816.118,1828.171,We would still -- still quarrel with them as to the application of this right of redemption for the 12-month period for -- for other reasons not related to the argument that I'm now making.
1960.18,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1860.871,1871.301,"Well, on what field is the Government going against this property to enforce its claim against three unrelated unsecured notes?"
1960.18,1,27248,harry_l_hobson,,1871.301,1885.343,The Government asked Mr. Frankfurter in its cross petition that the indebtedness indicated by those four promissory notes be declared a lien on this real estate.
1960.18,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1922.546,1937.649,"So if the lien, as I thought, that the lien was derived from the adjudication of a judgment in favor of the United States on its claims which did not by -- of course of the original arrangement operator's lien."
1960.18,1,27248,harry_l_hobson,,1937.649,1939.239,That is right Your Honor.
1960.18,2,25167,george_cochran_doub,,3914.929,3937.478,"The Kansas law specifically provides that in actions to enforce a mortgage, a personal judgment or judgments shall be rendered for the amount due as well to the plaintiff as other parties to the action having liens upon the mortgage premises."
1960.18,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3938.548,3941.923,Have you had liens on the mortgaged premises on those three notes?
1960.18,2,25167,george_cochran_doub,,3944.48,3955.337,"Well the -- apparently the -- this agency thought that it did, but the Court held that its lien was confined to one of the four notes."
1960.18,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3981.583,3986.372,(Inaudible) -- I don't understand why you called it a refinement whether you have a lien or you haven't.
1960.18,2,25167,george_cochran_doub,,3990.122,3993.636,"No, I -- I was talking to another point, Mr. Justice Frankfurter."
1960.18,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4017.617,4018.029,Suppose --
1960.18,2,25167,george_cochran_doub,,4018.029,4018.721,assert.
1960.18,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4018.721,4028.462,(Inaudible) with my mind that -- that I don't see it that way.
1960.18,2,25167,george_cochran_doub,,4051.04,4051.336,"Well, all they --"
1960.18,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4051.336,4059.495,"If they're wrong about it, and it isn't a refinement, if you had a lien to start with and you had no lien to start with, that is a refinement."
1960.18,2,25167,george_cochran_doub,,4059.495,4065.9,"Well first, if the Court please, we were brought into this case under 2410."
1960.18,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4067.48,4069.823,(Inaudible) on which you were brought in.
1960.18,2,25167,george_cochran_doub,,4069.823,4070.13,The -- the --
1960.18,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4070.13,4071.485,On one note.
1960.18,2,25167,george_cochran_doub,,4071.485,4079.238,"Well, it was -- no, it was a state foreclosure case to which we had to be a party no matter how many notes we had, whether we had one or a hundred."
1960.18,2,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,4079.238,4083.343,Yes but you had to be a party only in respect with the one mortgagor.
1960.18,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4083.343,4084.856,That's the fact of it though.
1960.18,2,25167,george_cochran_doub,,4084.856,4085.17,Yes.
1960.18,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4085.336,4088.348,You didn't have to be a party in respect to these three unsecured notes.
1960.18,2,25167,george_cochran_doub,,4088.348,4089.334,"No, that's what --"
1960.18,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4089.334,4092.326,You're only brought in respect to the lien.
1960.18,2,25167,george_cochran_doub,,4092.326,4092.991,That's true.
1960.18,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4092.991,4095.235,"Well, now why -- I -- I'm just -- I'm puzzled."
1960.18,2,25167,george_cochran_doub,,4095.653,4097.009,But here --
1960.18,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4097.009,4099.234,You -- you call it a defensive measure
1960.18,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4099.234,4111.694,"What you did as I understand it then is that -- that instead of having (Inaudible) your lien in the amount of the one note, you asked for a lien on the very property in the amount of the aggregate of the fourth note, is it?"
1960.18,2,25167,george_cochran_doub,,4111.694,4113.06,"Yes, and --"
1960.18,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4113.06,4113.571,This is what you --
1960.18,2,25167,george_cochran_doub,,4113.571,4118.865,And the court held the lien was confined to the one note very properly (Inaudible)
1960.18,3,27248,harry_l_hobson,,4322.557,4327.591,(Inaudible)
1960.18,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4327.591,4327.889,Yes.
1960.18,4,25167,george_cochran_doub,,4334.35,4334.739,Thank you.
1960.18,5,27248,harry_l_hobson,,4334.739,4338.453,Thank you.
1960.18,5,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4338.453,4350.345,(Inaudible)
