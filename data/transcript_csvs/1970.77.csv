1970.77,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,7.607,"We'll hear arguments in number 77, United States against Weller."
1970.77,0,33067,james_van_r_springer,,13.686,17.029,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1970.77,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,94.185,102.504,"Tell me, Mr. Springer, we would give him a rather welcome use to which fact something was being done by the Congress for the Criminal Appeals Act."
1970.77,0,33067,james_van_r_springer,,103.947,108.357,"I understand, I don't have a report as to what has happened this morning."
1970.77,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,130.507,132.891,So it may happen within next week or so we hope?
1970.77,0,33067,james_van_r_springer,,132.891,135.674,"Yes, it may, Mr. Justice."
1970.77,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,143.476,146.436,We won't have to suffer with it much longer if something is passed?
1970.77,0,33067,james_van_r_springer,,146.436,147.464,We can hope not.
1970.77,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,147.464,151.813,I hope we don't get the same new problems with the same order?
1970.77,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,151.813,158.106,Is the Solicitor General's office still of the view that this case should be in the Court of Appeals and not here?
1970.77,0,33067,james_van_r_springer,,158.106,160.221,"Yes, very much so, Mr. Chief Justice."
1970.77,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,173.766,176.603,Do you have a protected appeal pending?
1970.77,0,33067,james_van_r_springer,,176.603,185.497,"That would not be necessary, Mr. Justice Brennan, because of the provision in the Criminal Appeals Act that says if an appeal is improperly brought here --"
1970.77,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,185.497,186.15,You transfer it?
1970.77,0,33067,james_van_r_springer,,186.15,201.99,"It should be “remanded” is the word, but if you -- of course we filed, in lieu of a jurisdictional statement, we filed something called a motion to remand, and the Court has deferred the issue of jurisdiction until this time."
1970.77,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,470.547,475.435,"Mr. Springer, what is the reason for your deep concern about this?"
1970.77,0,33067,james_van_r_springer,,479.055,485.289,"Well, it would be here, Mr. Justice Blackmun, only on a petition for a writ of certiorari."
1970.77,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,544.264,545.671,"May I ask, Mr. Springer."
1970.77,0,33067,james_van_r_springer,,557.6,558.381,"Yes, that's right, Mr.--"
1970.77,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,558.381,561.87,"And on the second one, that this is not a motion at Bar, is that it?"
1970.77,0,33067,james_van_r_springer,,561.87,565.895,"Yes, and as I will try, I hope briefly to articulate our reasons."
1970.77,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,565.895,573.886,"But, I mean that it's not a motion at Bar, not that it's not a motion at Bar when the defendant -- that it is a motion at Bar, but not one when the defendant is not to put to jeopardy."
1970.77,0,33067,james_van_r_springer,,573.886,574.647,"No, I think it's clear."
1970.77,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,578.889,583.19,It's just simpler that it's not a motion in both.
1970.77,0,33067,james_van_r_springer,,583.885,585.833,Yes.
1970.77,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,585.833,592.93,"The government is in the peculiar position of having brought it here and then wishing it hadn't, is it not?"
1970.77,0,33067,james_van_r_springer,,592.93,601.891,"Well, having brought it here, Mr. Justice Blackmun, by the filing of a piece of paper in the District Court called a notice of appeal to the Supreme Court."
1970.77,1,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,2716.592,2726.994,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1970.77,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3024.7,3028.416,"What is that, the one decision subsequent to Judge Peckham's decision?"
1970.77,1,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,3028.416,3036.401,"I believe that is the Cassidy decision, Mr. Justice Stewart, and -- I beg your pardon, it's the Evans decision, Mr. Justice Stewart."
1970.77,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3038.96,3039.869,Thank you.
1970.77,1,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,3039.869,3047.33,-- and in some place in our brief.
1970.77,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3198.772,3202.281,Like in Sisson?
1970.77,1,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,3202.281,3207.938,"Well, I think that the Sisson case, Mr. Justice White, went off on a number of other problems."
1970.77,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3247.797,3261.491,"The motion filed here by the government to re -- to send the case to the Court of Appeals came before the Court of Appeals decision in the Evans case, did it not?"
1970.77,1,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,3268.835,3271.235,"That is correct, Mr. Justice Stewart."
1970.77,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3271.235,3278.847,"Wasn't the motion on jurisdiction made by the government earlier than January of 1970, I thought it was made last fall?"
1970.77,1,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,3278.847,3285.615,"The government's motion to remand, Mr. Chief Justice, which I have before me is dated December 1969."
1970.77,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3288.32,3291.52,"Well, wasn't there an earlier motion with the same effect though?"
1970.77,1,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,3291.52,3293.909,"If there is, I'm not aware of it, Mr. Chief Justice."
1970.77,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3293.909,3295.643,Mr. Springer is indicating in the negative.
1970.77,1,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,3295.643,3296.653,Yes.
1970.77,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3296.653,3300.784,"Well, that answers it."
1970.77,1,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,3300.784,3323.651,"The practical consideration, of course, is that which was revealed in the colloquy between Mr. Justice Brennan and Mr. Springer that if the government succeeds on its jurisdictional point, the case will go to the Ninth Circuit and the decision of the Ninth Circuit has been clearly foreshadowed by the Evans case and others."
1970.77,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3337.243,3343.544,Is it not Mr. Springer's point that your position is that no crime is committed?
1970.77,1,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,3343.544,3362.731,"Mr. Justice Marshall, our position is that the facts alleged in the indictment did indeed occur, and our position is that there was in fact an induction refusal as indeed is not contested and is really contested in conscientious objector cases."
1970.77,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3362.731,3367.714,The only crime could've been that it was an invalid induction law.
1970.77,1,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,3374.086,3375.935,"We do indeed, but it was --"
1970.77,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3375.935,3378.305,There's no doubt.
1970.77,1,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,3378.305,3414.369,"If I can go back to my understanding of the position taken by the dissenters in the Mersky case, Mr. Justice Marshall, they spoke for the traditional view of the motion at Bar provision and likened it to either the specific ancient pleas, if I'm not being prejudicial in using that word, the specific venerable pleas such as the statute of limitations, (Inaudible) convict, pardon, and suggested that it has to be something which is of the nature of confession and avoidance."
1970.77,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3429.245,3439.529,"Well, the only difference is as to whether or not the valid induction order is a part of the Act."
1970.77,1,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,3447.377,3449.14,"That is our position, Mr. Justice Marshall."
1970.77,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3587.067,3600.408,"Mr. Karpatkin, suppose the government had, however, appealed to the Ninth Circuit, what would have been your avenue for relief, a way of getting here, where would you be, in the Ninth Circuit?"
1970.77,1,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,3600.408,3611.223,"I would suppose, Mr. Justice Blackmun, that we would probably make a motion to dismiss the appeal on the grounds that there was direct and exclusive jurisdiction in the Supreme Court of the United States."
1970.77,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3611.223,3621.926,"So that you would interpret 8-3731 to, where it says an appeal may be taken in the mandatory language there?"
1970.77,1,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,3621.926,3627.85,"My friend is showing me the statute, yes."
1970.77,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3647.025,3657.253,"Is that the -- is that analogy by certification, certainly distinct from any concern that 3731 was mandatory?"
1970.77,1,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,3657.253,3663.732,"I believe that the Ninth Circuit expressed its uncertainty about that in that case, Mr. Justice Blackmun."
1970.77,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3712.052,3723.509,Do I understand correctly that here the statute was silent as to whether or not counsel could or couldn't be provided by the executive?
1970.77,1,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,3723.509,3724.934,"Absolutely silent, Mr. Justice White."
1970.77,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3724.934,3729.724,And the regulation expressly says that he may not have counsel.
1970.77,1,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,3729.724,3730.475,"Yes, Mr. Justice White."
1970.77,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3730.475,3743.411,"And I suppose the District Judge says there's some rule of law, which in this context, which means that a silent statute just doesn't authorize the regulation."
1970.77,1,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,3746.466,3750.726,"Well, I think it very much is a construction of the statute, but I believe that the district judge went further than that."
1970.77,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3750.726,3757.369,"You mean because he read it and said it was silent, that's a construction or that --"
1970.77,1,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,3757.369,3764.765,"As I see what the district judge did, Mr. Justice White, is that he looked to the provisions of the statute --"
1970.77,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3764.765,3766.865,And found them silent?
1970.77,1,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,3766.865,3773.596,"But, he did find that the statute directed the President to select them for military service in a fair and impartial manner."
1970.77,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3794.7,3796.476,Yes.
1970.77,1,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,3796.476,3797.293,It seems to me --
1970.77,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3797.293,3803.886,But that isn't what -- that isn't why the regulation wasn't authorized?
1970.77,1,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,3803.886,3823.399,"Well, as a matter of law, I certainly feel that the district judge was absolutely correct in invoking the principle of Greene against McElroy and Hannah against Larche and many other decisions of this Court to find that wherever something gets so close to a constitutional right, Congress must act explicitly."
1970.77,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3823.399,3827.141,"Well, that's not construing the statute."
1970.77,1,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,3841.067,3857.231,"Well, it seemed to me -- it seems to me, again, Mr. Justice White, that the District Judge was looking with a magnifying glass or a microscope from the beginning of the statute to the end, looking through every clause which could possibly have some relationship with it and he found that there was none."
1970.77,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3857.231,3867.198,But if a district judge reads a decision of this Court which says that any regulation which denies counsel must at least have express congressional authorization.
1970.77,1,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,3878.09,3900.949,"Well, I believe, since the government takes the position that the statute properly construed, should indicate congressional acquiescence in the existing pattern of denial of counsel that the district, and since I'm sure this position was ably urged by the United States Attorney in the Northern District of California, the district judge had to examine the statute and to see it should be construed from the point of view advocated by the government."
1970.77,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3904.827,3920.296,"Are you saying that -- what you're saying is that the government is either -- is arguing both sides of the road when it says that it's -- the statute is silent on the one hand, but it isn't silent on the other because of congressional acquiescence?"
1970.77,1,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,3920.296,3926.142,"You're -- you have anticipated my next observation much more aptly, Mr. Justice White."
1970.77,2,33067,james_van_r_springer,,5468.715,5469.616,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1970.77,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5471.922,5474.447,"No, I see no indication of it."
1970.77,2,33067,james_van_r_springer,,5476.127,5477.266,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
