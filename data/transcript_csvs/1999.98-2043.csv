1999.98-2043,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.628,"We'll hear argument next in Number 98-2043, Hunt-Wesson v. Franchise Tax Board."
1999.98-2043,0,44961,walter_hellerstein,,32.322,35.377,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1999.98-2043,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,101.758,115.504,"Well, I suppose we don't have to answer all the questions here if we were to find that the interest offset is unconstitutional because it taxes income over which California lacks jurisdiction to tax."
1999.98-2043,0,44961,walter_hellerstein,,117.361,118.969,"That is correct, Justice O'Connor."
1999.98-2043,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,150.51,154.142,Beatrice was an Illinois domiciliary the same way Hunt-Wesson is?
1999.98-2043,0,44961,walter_hellerstein,,154.142,160.374,"--Yes, Chief Justice Rehnquist, Beatrice was an Illinois domiciliary."
1999.98-2043,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,179.155,180.231,"Beatrice, I think."
1999.98-2043,0,44961,walter_hellerstein,,184.085,184.828,--Beatrice.
1999.98-2043,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,187.495,191.004,Smart move.
1999.98-2043,1,21118,david_lew,,1525.587,1533.881,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1999.98-2043,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1584.287,1604.06,"Yes, but the problem here is, California has chosen to allocate 100 percent of the taxpayer's interest expense in excess of its business interest income to its generation of nonbusiness income that's not taxable by California."
1999.98-2043,1,21118,david_lew,,1604.06,1604.72,"--Well, the--"
1999.98-2043,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1604.72,1617.845,"I mean, it's California's choice to have this scheme, and it's enacted one that does raise concerns of trying to tax extraterritorial income, in effect."
1999.98-2043,1,21118,david_lew,,1635.678,1671.51,"--Well, the answer to your question, Justice O'Connor, is that what California is trying to do with this statute is basically eliminate a double tax benefit that arises whenever a corporation, number 1, incurs debt, and there is therefore interest expense generated by that debt, and at the same time has funds invested in nontaxable activities which produce nontaxable income."
1999.98-2043,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1682.201,1691.489,But you solved that problem by denying it against all nonunitary income whether or not the interest expense was related to it.
1999.98-2043,1,21118,david_lew,,1691.489,1701.603,"Well, what the statute is attempting to do, Justice Kennedy, is to essentially close that loophole in the most effective way possible."
1999.98-2043,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1701.603,1707.342,"Well, of course, it's always effective if you deny apportionment."
1999.98-2043,1,21118,david_lew,,1707.342,1717.95,"Well, the theory behind doing it on a dollar basis... and if I may just take one step back."
1999.98-2043,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1729.733,1732.234,"And if the business interest is big enough, then there's going to be no problem."
1999.98-2043,1,21118,david_lew,,1732.234,1732.977,That's correct.
1999.98-2043,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1735.783,1736.404,Of course.
1999.98-2043,1,21118,david_lew,,1736.404,1768.188,"To the extent that any remains, that is allocated also on a dollar-for-dollar basis against the corporation's nonbusiness income, and again it's intended basically to eliminate the possibility that any amount of that interest expense which is related to the generation of income that's not taxable by the State of California is used by the corporation to reduce its California tax base."
1999.98-2043,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1768.188,1771.41,"Yes, but it's not allocable against all its nonbusiness income."
1999.98-2043,1,21118,david_lew,,1771.41,1780.327,"It's... well, the answer to your question is, it's allocable against its nonbusiness interest and dividend income."
1999.98-2043,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1782.101,1786.392,My can company has no business interest income.
1999.98-2043,1,21118,david_lew,,1808.023,1814.877,Because the money that is borrowed basically is... can't... is used to free--
1999.98-2043,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1814.877,1815.908,Say you don't know.
1999.98-2043,1,21118,david_lew,,1850.133,1857.275,"--There's nothing wrong with a proportional approach, Your Honor, except that it doesn't really close the loophole."
1999.98-2043,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1857.275,1859.254,--How does it not close the loophole?
1999.98-2043,1,21118,david_lew,,1859.254,1870.317,"Because to the extent that less than $1 of interest expense is used to offset a dollar of nonbusiness income, there's still that differential that exists."
1999.98-2043,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1870.317,1873.66,"Sure there's a differential, but the sheep farm had nothing whatsoever to do with the lending."
1999.98-2043,1,21118,david_lew,,1873.66,1874.736,Well--
1999.98-2043,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1874.736,1876.361,"I mean, I don't see why you call that a loophole."
1999.98-2043,1,21118,david_lew,,1876.361,1879.688,"--The assumption is that it's not related, and--"
1999.98-2043,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1879.688,1880.431,"Yes, right."
1999.98-2043,1,21118,david_lew,,1881.712,1883.403,"--Indirectly, yes."
1999.98-2043,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1883.403,1887.861,"Well, maybe the tin is really related, so why don't you allocate all the deduction for the tin to the sheep, too?"
1999.98-2043,1,21118,david_lew,,1887.861,1908.006,"Well, the answer is that you just don't know that, and what... and what California is trying to do is to prevent any of that interest that might be related to the generation of income that it cannot tax to be used to reduce its California tax base."
1999.98-2043,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1908.006,1931.329,"Well, when you say they just don't know, what you're referring to is the... a process in which most States know by virtue of a reasonable apportionment formula, and so when you say, well, we just don't know, that seems to be the equivalent of saying, well, we can't apportion, but you clearly can."
1999.98-2043,1,21118,david_lew,,1931.329,1935.954,"Well, there's no problem, constitutional problem with apportionment."
1999.98-2043,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1964.933,1989.164,"Yes, but you don't know either, and instead of adopting an apportionment formula, what you in effect do is adopt an irrebuttable presumption, and as against an apportionment formula, which provides a rational basis, and an irrebuttable presumption which ignores the facts, due process normally requires the rational process."
1999.98-2043,1,21118,david_lew,,1989.164,2005.307,"Well, I can only say that the objective of the State is to attempt to eliminate that possibility of the taxpayer receiving a double tax benefit."
1999.98-2043,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2005.307,2005.966,"Oh, you certainly do that."
1999.98-2043,2,44961,walter_hellerstein,,3224.353,3230.586,I have three very brief points.
1999.98-2043,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3323.92,3325.695,"Thank you, Mr. Hellerstein."
