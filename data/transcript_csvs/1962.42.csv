1962.42,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,6.52,"Number 42, United States, Appellant, versus Loew's, Incorporated, et al."
1962.42,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,37.311,40.68,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1962.42,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,283.348,284.559,What page is that please?
1962.42,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,284.559,285.854,Page 8.
1962.42,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,285.854,287.052,"In which, Mr. Friedman?"
1962.42,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,287.052,295.0,That's the brief -- it's the caption briefed for the United States in reply to appellant's briefs in Number 43 and Number 44.
1962.42,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,305.633,309.291,One of your errors to change a firm to reverse.
1962.42,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,309.291,311.555,No -- no Mr. Justice.
1962.42,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,333.943,334.759,What page is that?
1962.42,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,334.759,336.93,"Page 17, Mr. Justice."
1962.42,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,336.93,338.329,13 months.
1962.42,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,338.329,340.14,"13 months, that's correct."
1962.42,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,371.747,373.279,The case doesn't turn on it.
1962.42,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,373.279,374.983,"No, it does not, Mr. Justice."
1962.42,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,374.983,376.685,"What was the last one, I misunderstood?"
1962.42,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,376.685,383.681,"On page 19, in the middle of the page, was released in 1957 that should be 1956."
1962.42,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,383.681,384.969,Thank you.
1962.42,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,384.969,394.795,"Now, coming to the facts of the case, the Government in 1957 filed six separate cases against the defendants."
1962.42,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,499.475,501.686,All of these are (Inaudible)
1962.42,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,501.686,508.419,They vary from the early period of the 20s to 1928 or 1929 down to 1948.
1962.42,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,508.419,509.643,Nothing later than 1948.
1962.42,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,509.643,510.722,Not in this case.
1962.42,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,515.39,529.206,"You mean, when you say that all of the defendants undertook to furnish these films in packages, do you mean offer them in packages or the condition there -- a use of any of them upon the use of all?"
1962.42,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,529.206,535.427,"Well, they offered them all in packages and the District Court found that a number of instances they had conditioned them."
1962.42,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,538.449,541.264,That's what I'm asking.
1962.42,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,541.264,555.112,"And one other factor about them is that where they undertook to sell in smaller packages, not the entire view of package of 39 or package of 58 or 52, they all set up what they called balance packages."
1962.42,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,564.971,566.064,(Inaudible)
1962.42,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,566.064,578.338,"Well that's -- the theater seem to think, the station seem to think they were good and they -- the evidence indicates as I shall develop that there were many instances which the stations didn't want affirmatively some of them."
1962.42,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,585.042,600.385,"Mr. Friedman, I don't know whether this is material or not but in these packages, were they pictures all of the same vintage or might you get one of very late vintage and one of very early vintage, and so forth?"
1962.42,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,600.385,602.221,"That's correct, they vary completely."
1962.42,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,602.221,602.694,Varied completely.
1962.42,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,602.694,605.775,The station set up with it thought it would be a balanced package.
1962.42,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,612.329,615.801,There is no classification as to age or anything of that kind.
1962.42,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,615.801,624.698,"Well, except to this extent, I think, Mr. Chief Justice that generally, it was felt that the older pictures were sometimes less desirable."
1962.42,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,758.569,760.786,This is how it was exonerated.
1962.42,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,760.786,778.876,"No, on the contrary that their argument is that it exonerated and that was an ancillary restraint and we think it clearly was not an ancillary restraint of whatever it may have been the business reasons for C & C entering into this agreement, it could not justify block booking in order to accomplish its business aims."
1962.42,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,812.107,813.658,17 out of how many?
1962.42,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,813.658,817.247,Out of 59 that were challenged by the Government.
1962.42,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,817.247,818.646,Out of what?
1962.42,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,818.646,820.711,17 out of 59.
1962.42,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,820.711,821.75,More than how much?
1962.42,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,821.75,827.621,$3 million of commerce involved in the contract specifically found block booked.
1962.42,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,962.266,969.67,"The purchasers or the licensees in every case where individual stations rather than networks, were they?"
1962.42,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,969.67,972.685,They are individual stations in one or two examples.
1962.42,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,982.671,983.53,With the national network.
1962.42,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,983.53,985.03,That's correct.
1962.42,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1089.107,1102.33,"Mr. Friedman, you feel that this Court has held unequivocally that to tie two contrary articles together that are hearsay a violation of the contract?"
1962.42,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1102.33,1104.424,We think so Mr. Justice White and I'm just --
1962.42,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1104.424,1109.893,Is this your -- did you feel the lower court have directed its decision on that proposition?
1962.42,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1109.893,1111.019,I think so and --
1962.42,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1111.019,1113.671,And do you stand on that proposition here?
1962.42,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1113.671,1115.92,"Well, we think we stand on two things."
1962.42,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1116.185,1117.639,I know but do you stand on that?
1962.42,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1117.639,1119.915,"Oh yes, we do."
1962.42,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1119.915,1122.326,I'm trying to understand you get some other --
1962.42,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1122.326,1125.354,"Yes, we stand on that proposition and I would like to come to that --"
1962.42,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1125.354,1131.715,"(Voice Overlap) that I suppose that this Court has held that any time you force somebody to take something and he doesn't want it, he won't need to pay you."
1962.42,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1131.715,1141.52,"No Mr. Justice, the Court has recognized -- the Court has pointed out that as long as he has -- it requires two things, it requires there'd be sufficient economic power."
1962.42,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1143.667,1154.58,"What about when I wanted to sell you 100 films and you'd say -- you would buy 100 films and then I say if you get the 100, you have to take another 100."
1962.42,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1165.174,1169.632,"Well, I think there we have the same product, whereas in this case, we have different product."
1962.42,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1169.632,1171.514,What are the products in this case?
1962.42,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1171.514,1174.426,"In the case, the product is a copyrighted motion picture."
1962.42,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1179.173,1183.641,So you said just treating each particular picture as a separate product.
1962.42,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1185.367,1186.595,"Well, we -- if I may --"
1962.42,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1186.595,1188.132,(Voice Overlap) bad films and good filMs.
1962.42,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1188.132,1188.954,"No, that's right."
1962.42,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1210.016,1217.295,At least one of -- the major part of your position is that this is just an extension of the copyright and I believe it's --
1962.42,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1217.295,1222.78,"That's right and we believe, Mr. Justice, that's what the Court specifically held in the Paramount case."
1962.42,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1223.814,1225.523,What does the court held below?
1962.42,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1225.523,1228.138,The court below held that this Court's decision in the Par --
1962.42,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1228.138,1231.095,It rested firmly on that and nothing else.
1962.42,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1231.095,1235.911,It rested on Paramount and the other tying cases of this Court.
1962.42,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1235.911,1241.547,"I mean on the theory of the copyright, one picture, I believe was a copyrighted product."
1962.42,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1241.547,1243.328,"Yes, I think that's correct."
1962.42,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1274.918,1297.434,"Mr. Friedman, before you go on, if you will, could you return a moment to the argument you're making at the time that Mr. Justice White asked you some questions to the effect that this practice of Loew's insisting and if they take all 723 when the station only wanted 500, excluded competitors from the market, I didn't understand that."
1962.42,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1297.434,1298.14,Oh!
1962.42,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1311.175,1312.346,Who would be the competing sellers?
1962.42,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1312.346,1316.016,One of the other defendants perhaps might want to sell the poor pictures but --
1962.42,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1316.016,1319.61,"Well, but you just told Mr. Justice White that each one of these pictures is unique."
1962.42,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1319.61,1320.458,Exactly.
1962.42,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1320.458,1322.368,Each one of these pictures is unique.
1962.42,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1322.368,1324.314,So what -- where is the competition?
1962.42,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1324.314,1330.76,"Well, the competition is selling -- complete selling, competing films even though each film is unique otherwise --"
1962.42,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1330.76,1336.192,You mean each is uniquely bad no matter how many of them would sell that.
1962.42,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1336.192,1338.242,Some people think that.
1962.42,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1359.433,1361.107,"But they don't say that, do they?"
1962.42,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1364.059,1364.949,That's right.
1962.42,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1364.949,1365.478,They don't want.
1962.42,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1368.642,1369.237,That's right.
1962.42,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1371.314,1371.639,Yes.
1962.42,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1371.639,1374.092,They're forced to take those particular pictures.
1962.42,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1384.283,1386.94,I don't -- I don't understand the argument.
1962.42,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1386.94,1387.837,Well this is really --
1962.42,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1387.837,1391.843,(Inaudible)
1962.42,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1391.843,1392.715,That's right.
1962.42,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1392.715,1393.168,That's correct.
1962.42,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1433.965,1436.442,Transportation is not unique.
1962.42,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1436.442,1444.01,"No, but I might point out, Mr. Justice, in Northern Pacific case, we did not have the copyrights."
1962.42,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1444.01,1444.453,No.
1962.42,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1444.453,1444.997,We did not --
1962.42,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1444.997,1458.359,(Inaudible)
1962.42,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1458.359,1459.66,That's right.
1962.42,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1459.66,1460.595,"Well, no I --"
1962.42,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1460.595,1472.586,(Inaudible)
1962.42,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1472.586,1485.113,"But each one -- the reason they're able to do this, Mr. Justice, the reason they're able to accomplish this here is because of the fact that they had to copyright monopoly on the particular pictures which the stations wanted."
1962.42,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1485.113,1495.681,(Inaudible)
1962.42,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1495.681,1498.061,"Well, I don't know if it said it has to be restraint."
1962.42,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1498.118,1500.531,"Well, it would be again a competitive effect on --"
1962.42,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1500.531,1502.978,I think Northern Pacific merely illustrated the inevitable --
1962.42,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1502.978,1505.86,The product is the particular copyrighted picture.
1962.42,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1522.494,1525.863,"Well, if I may put it this way."
1962.42,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1532.581,1535.5,So it's one product.
1962.42,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1535.5,1537.549,"No, I can't say its one product."
1962.42,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1542.209,1549.09,"Are you saying that this is a result, what do you need to show if it's an anticompetitive effect or not."
1962.42,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1557.924,1559.469,That's precisely it.
1962.42,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1559.469,1563.881,"Well, Mr. Friedman, that station you say it was West Virginia station?"
1962.42,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1563.881,1563.914,Yes.
1962.42,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1563.914,1576.004,"You said it had to take 700 odd pictures and initially told the seller, ""I won't use 200 odd of them"", and in fact at the time of the hearing had not used and still wouldn't use."
1962.42,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1582.132,1593.612,"Well, I assume that since part of the price they paid for the library, part of the price they paid for the library reflected these 200 pictures."
1962.42,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1612.355,1616.082,"(Voice Overlap) that's the relevant question, isn't it, whether they're good or bad?"
1962.42,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1616.082,1616.778,That's right.
1962.42,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1616.778,1620.487,But whether you're being forced to take pictures that you don't want.
1962.42,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1620.487,1622.098,That's precisely.
1962.42,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1634.692,1641.121,"All I'm saying is that if they -- as I ask you, you're just relying on the fact you don't have to show any anticompetitive effect."
1962.42,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1641.121,1642.546,That's correct.
1962.42,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1642.546,1647.036,"Yes, but you do want to talk about anticompetitive effects."
1962.42,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1647.036,1651.005,"Mr. Friedman, what about the case of (Inaudible)"
1962.42,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1651.005,1652.283,That's correct.
1962.42,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1652.283,1666.185,"(Inaudible) total showing, is there a distinction with that?"
1962.42,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1666.185,1682.578,"We don't think that this distinction is this part that it's significant, Mr. Justice because in both instances, in both instances whether it's the thing that the State, the theatre depends on entirely or it's something which the television station either wants."
1962.42,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1697.339,1712.809,"But there's another way of looking at this whole transaction and that is that Loew's have said this, you have 500 pictures and these 500 pictures will cost you $500,000.00 and we're going to be very kind and show him 223 more."
1962.42,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1712.809,1715.662,"Well, this comes to our argument on the relief."
1962.42,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,1754.088,1755.852,Is that only instance of the practice?
1962.42,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1755.852,1762.37,"No, Mr. Justice, we have cited in our brief there are six or seven instances of this practice."
1962.42,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,1875.894,1892.7,"Well, aren't you making some assumptions there if you assume that the -- in the case that the District Court found as he did that the purchaser wanted to do this to protect himself?"
1962.42,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1903.77,1912.291,"Well, in each instance I think, Mr. Justice, it is done because he wants to get particular pictures."
1962.42,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1925.807,1930.946,"We'll recess now, Mr. Friedman."
1962.42,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1933.255,1935.849,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1962.42,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2112.381,2123.0,"Mr. Friedman, would there be any circumstances where you can lower the pictures and lawfully offer the pictures in the block book package than you did?"
1962.42,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,2123.0,2130.989,He could always -- he cannot offer in a block if the station is required to buy some in order to get others.
1962.42,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2175.932,2188.952,But now we've been talking mostly about the Loew's and that involved their whole library of 723 pictures but most of these -- most of these transactions here involved about 30 or 40 or 50 that general area of magnitude --
1962.42,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,2188.952,2190.906,"That's right, range --"
1962.42,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2190.906,2201.982,And you say that -- that a -- the owner of these pictures that distributed these pictures couldn't say that we sell them only by a minimum of half a dozen.
1962.42,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,2210.814,2212.273,Any six that the station wants.
1962.42,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2212.273,2213.275,Yes.
1962.42,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,2213.275,2216.308,I think -- let me put it this way Mr. Justice.
1962.42,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2223.355,2227.365,But your answer to Mr. Goldberg suggested that you would say that that was a violation.
1962.42,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,2227.365,2237.611,"I would say that's right, if they initially come and say, you, in order to get any pictures from us, you have to get six."
1962.42,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2262.066,2264.325,"If the station wants six, could they (Inaudible)?"
1962.42,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,2264.325,2279.33,"Surely, the station -- if the station says, ""We'd like six"", the thing about it is, Mr. Justice Stewart, that if the station wants six pictures, good pictures or bad pictures, it should be free to select the pictures that wants."
1962.42,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2280.259,2287.599,(Inaudible)
1962.42,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,2287.599,2287.992,That's right.
1962.42,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2288.679,2289.324,He cannot?
1962.42,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,2289.324,2290.837,He cannot say that.
1962.42,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2290.837,2297.358,(Inaudible)
1962.42,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,2297.358,2298.796,"Oh surely, surely."
1962.42,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2298.861,2300.175,He can persuade him?
1962.42,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,2300.175,2303.045,He can persuade them but not coerce them into buying --
1962.42,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2303.045,2327.84,Suppose he gain his trust (Inaudible).
1962.42,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,2327.84,2332.984,"Well, I would have to say, Mr. Justice, I would think that would be bad because it --"

1962.42,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,2334.39,2338.381,That's right because again he's conditioning.
1962.42,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2338.381,2342.075,Your argument was back to the old tie-in clause cases.
1962.42,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,2342.075,2347.547,"That's right, it rest on those as this Court has repeatedly been condemned."
1962.42,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2355.717,2359.861,"If these were not copyrighted, that wouldn't make any difference."
1962.42,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,2361.37,2367.108,"The result might be different depending on the degree of power, economic power they had in the market but we think --"
1962.42,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2367.108,2370.539,When you get back to the Colgate case that type of thing.
1962.42,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,2370.539,2372.877,"Well, we don't think we get back to the Colgate case."
1962.42,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2372.877,2375.556,"In case it didn't have a copyright, you'd --"
1962.42,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,2375.556,2375.584,You might.
1962.42,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2375.584,2376.783,Yes.
1962.42,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,2376.783,2381.382,"But we think here, the copyright does apply as I've indicated in the market on this."
1962.42,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2381.382,2384.552,What is the smallest package?
1962.42,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,2386.739,2392.569,Smallest -- there is one instance of one package I think of seven which is not frequently referred.

1962.42,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,2466.213,2466.839,Pardon sir.

1962.42,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,2472.959,2477.261,"Well, it would still be the different films, I suppose."
1962.42,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2638.51,2641.506,You don't object to those?
1962.42,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,2641.506,2642.717,We -- no.
1962.42,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2652.767,2654.386,What page is that?
1962.42,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,2654.386,2659.865,At 52 and 53 of Volume 1 of the record.
1962.42,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2855.69,2857.325,When did you file the suit?
1962.42,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,2857.325,2859.756,Filed a suit in 1957.
1962.42,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2859.756,2863.474,(Inaudible)
1962.42,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,2863.474,2866.124,Early in 1956.

1962.42,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,2870.116,2873.026,"Well no, that's from 1956 to 1960, Mr. Justice."
1962.42,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2873.026,2875.06,This was after the case was tried.
1962.42,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,2875.06,2876.823,After the time the case was tried.
1962.42,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,2889.732,2893.801,Is this the first case at the time of this kind that the Government brought?
1962.42,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,2893.801,2895.729,Against block booking of --
1962.42,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,2895.729,2899.471,In a government suit.
1962.42,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,2899.471,2903.292,"Well, it's the first case that the Government has brought dealing with this particular practice."
1962.42,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,2906.803,2908.145,"Well, I meant this practice."
1962.42,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,2908.145,2909.293,Yes.
1962.42,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2909.293,2918.289,Had there been any triple -- trouble damage suits in this field touching block booking by television?
1962.42,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,2918.289,2929.973,"I know of only one, Mr. Justice, which is a Fifth Circuit decision cited by the Court of -- District Court in its opinion which involved the tying of Warner Brothers pictures and in Popeye cartoons."

1962.42,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,2951.263,2954.036,"But that was -- that was part of the Government's aim, yes."

1962.42,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,2978.371,2984.833,That is correct and we are -- we are suggesting -- we have suggested in our brief some revisions in the phraseology of this.
1962.42,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2984.833,2993.383,"But what specifically, we were not given or whatsoever offering at the interim (Inaudible), is that right?"
1962.42,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,2995.716,2998.696,That is with respect to the differential.
1962.42,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2998.696,3004.679,"Well, I'm looking at (c) at page 73, your closing to the final judgment."
1962.42,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,3004.679,3005.368,Yes.
1962.42,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3005.368,3010.029,You did not get what the (Inaudible)
1962.42,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,3010.029,3011.266,That's correct.
1962.42,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3012.046,3017.17,And that's one of the (Inaudible) that you have at this page?
1962.42,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,3017.17,3026.204,That is one but we also did not get into the qualifications for the purpose of permitting the defendant to attempt to sell or license such group.
1962.42,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3026.204,3028.566,That's at (f) of the subsequent page?

1962.42,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,3078.985,3101.711,"We would have gotten (c) but I don't think we would have gotten (d) and (f), which is the individual -- we want the individual picture by picture and also a differential, it does not exceed the cost and saving -- its cost, savings and distribution or selling."
1962.42,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3146.948,3152.003,"Do you think it would be alright if they offered 10 -- if you take 10, you'll get 10% discount, something like that."
1962.42,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,3152.789,3157.736,If that reflected a saving in the pack -- and being able to sell it at package.
1962.42,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3217.495,3221.482,"The other -- the 30 or 40 didn't -- not include any Selznick, did it?"
1962.42,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,3221.482,3222.056,Oh yes.
1962.42,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3222.056,3222.63,It did.
1962.42,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,3222.63,3227.751,"In other words, Mr. Justice, let me explain one of the situations."
1962.42,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3255.198,3261.926,"You said after that, the price was $61,000 for 46, how long was it?"
1962.42,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,3261.926,3274.986,"No, in the course of -- I'm sorry, in the course of negotiations, they were quoted a price for the Selznick's which came to within $1,000 of the total price for all the pictures in the package including the Selznick."
1962.42,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3274.986,3277.259,And this was in the course of the same negotiation.
1962.42,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,3277.259,3278.103,That's right.
1962.42,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,3386.041,3395.947,"Could the (Voice Overlap) say that Loew intended to pick any given type of a picture, you could have a discount of 10%, could they do that?"
1962.42,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,3395.947,3399.172,"As under our construction of the judgment, no, Mr. Justice."
1962.42,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,3399.172,3401.625,Not in any quantity discount?
1962.42,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,3401.625,3412.602,"No, only to -- only to the extent, they can have any quantity discount to the extent that this discount reflects a difference in the course of distribution."
1962.42,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3440.654,3445.223,"You may, Mr. Friedman."
1962.42,1,34896,louis_nizer,,3446.461,3448.238,Thank you sir.
1962.42,1,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,3728.993,3731.205,What is the figure of the 59?
1962.42,1,34896,louis_nizer,,3734.774,3738.639,They reduced the number after all of these pretrial proceedings.
1962.42,1,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,3741.318,3741.826,I see.
1962.42,1,34896,louis_nizer,,3741.826,3747.658,And at that we think that it's 80 -- 80 something and I think that was inadvertent but it doesn't matter.
1962.42,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3829.956,3834.07,"Of course, that was -- there were no copyright of patented material."
1962.42,1,34896,louis_nizer,,3834.07,3841.512,No sir and in the cellophane case there was a patented article and it doesn't matter as I shall soon attempt to demonstrate.
1962.42,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3926.791,3933.049,"Of course the earlier tying agreements went off on a different theory though, didn't they?"
1962.42,1,34896,louis_nizer,,3933.049,3937.901,The early ones like the IBM case was the classic case.
