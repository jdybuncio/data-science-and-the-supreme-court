1995.94-9247,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,13.24,"We'll hear argument next in Number 94-9247, Charles Carlisle v. The United States."
1995.94-9247,0,29474,james_a_christopherson,,20.306,22.887,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1995.94-9247,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,63.212,65.202,"Well, the rule is clear."
1995.94-9247,0,29474,james_a_christopherson,,84.676,104.679,"--It is not sufficiently clear, Your Honor, because I think the second sentence in subparagraph (a) of 29 gives the court the authority on its own motion to rule on a judgment of acquittal based upon the insufficiency of the evidence."
1995.94-9247,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,104.679,112.105,"Now, you... where do we find the second sentence set out in haec verba in your brief or somewhere else in the papers?"
1995.94-9247,0,29474,james_a_christopherson,,112.105,116.738,"It's actually, I think, set out on page 2 of the Government's brief."
1995.94-9247,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,116.738,117.849,Page 2 of the Government's brief?
1995.94-9247,0,29474,james_a_christopherson,,117.849,118.168,Yes.
1995.94-9247,1,37863,paul_a_engelmayer,,1551.647,1555.051,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1995.94-9247,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1625.245,1627.716,But it hasn't extended the time for a motion here.
1995.94-9247,1,37863,paul_a_engelmayer,,1630.539,1631.571,That's absolutely right.
1995.94-9247,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1652.533,1661.009,"What happens if the attorney is on his way to the court and is abducted, or has a heart attack, and misses the filing deadline by a few hours?"
1995.94-9247,1,37863,paul_a_engelmayer,,1662.999,1669.124,"Well, Justice Kennedy, the district court, of course, itself has the power--"
1995.94-9247,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1669.124,1672.636,"No, no, I'm assuming that the 7 days expires."
1995.94-9247,1,37863,paul_a_engelmayer,,1672.636,1689.266,"--I think the text of the rule admits of no excusable neglect exception, and whether or not that is wise as a matter of policy, the rule says no... that it is not subject to an excusable neglect exception, even though that's... your hypothetical surely would be excusable neglect."
1995.94-9247,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1689.266,1690.929,Surely an appeal would still lie.
1995.94-9247,1,37863,paul_a_engelmayer,,1690.929,1691.788,Absolutely.
1995.94-9247,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1691.788,1695.13,"That there wasn't sufficient evidence to sustain the jury verdict, right?"
1995.94-9247,1,37863,paul_a_engelmayer,,1699.994,1712.084,"That's absolutely right, Mr. Chief Justice, on appeal, whether or not the motion was timely made in the district court, the court of appeals will be reviewing de novo the question of whether the Jackson v. Virginia standards--"
1995.94-9247,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1712.084,1718.767,"My goodness, Jackson v. Virginia is not the same, is it, as whether you're deciding a sufficiency of the evidence 100 percent, it's just that?"
1995.94-9247,1,37863,paul_a_engelmayer,,1731.114,1734.096,"--I guess all I'm saying, Justice Breyer, is that there's an adequate recourse on it."
1995.94-9247,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1734.096,1742.241,"Is that adequate if, in fact, then the court of appeals doesn't go and, looking for plain error, apply the same standard to the evidence as otherwise?"
1995.94-9247,1,37863,paul_a_engelmayer,,1742.241,1750.528,"Our position, Justice Breyer, and I think this is consistent with the way the courts of appeals have addressed the issue of sufficiency where no timely... where the issue is not--"
1995.94-9247,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1750.528,1760.684,"I don't remember ever going back looking, combing through records where, you know, there are close questions and so forth, in the absence of a motion, where they say you have to find plain error."
1995.94-9247,1,37863,paul_a_engelmayer,,1768.567,1775.173,--I think the court on appeal obviously is going to have to be guided in large part by the submissions of the parties as to what the evidence at trial showed.
1995.94-9247,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1789.672,1794.086,But that's certainly not the same as the trial judge... you made a distinction in the brief yourself.
1995.94-9247,1,37863,paul_a_engelmayer,,1802.982,1807.867,"Justice Ginsburg, the Sixth Circuit did not reach the issue of sufficiency."
1995.94-9247,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1811.859,1815.651,"--Well, what was it... remanded for sentencing, not for doing anything with the verdict any more."
1995.94-9247,1,37863,paul_a_engelmayer,,1815.651,1830.433,"--That's right, but the... under the Sixth Circuit's remand, following sentencing in the case, the defendant would have been free to raise the substance of a sufficiency claim in the court of appeals under a plain error standard as well as any other trial errors, as well as any objections to sentencing."
1995.94-9247,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1830.433,1835.246,"Well, and a sufficiency claim is very difficult to make out as a practical matter, isn't it?"
1995.94-9247,1,37863,paul_a_engelmayer,,1847.324,1848.165,That's right.
1995.94-9247,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1848.165,1854.118,"Well, that's sort of interesting, because the... to me, is that we used to get hundreds... I mean, that was the most common thing."
1995.94-9247,1,37863,paul_a_engelmayer,,1901.457,1907.712,"Justice Breyer, let me address that first with regard to direct appeal plain error and then with regard to sufficiency, if I might."
1995.94-9247,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1932.099,1933.06,"Not appropriate, mandatory."
1995.94-9247,1,37863,paul_a_engelmayer,,1933.39,1933.78,Mandatory.
1995.94-9247,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1933.78,1934.079,"--agree, right."
1995.94-9247,1,37863,paul_a_engelmayer,,1934.079,1934.409,Absolutely.
1995.94-9247,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1934.409,1941.325,"But wait a minute, may I just... may I just... I hate to interrupt, but I want to be sure you're... what if he didn't do it sua sponte within the 7 days?"
1995.94-9247,1,37863,paul_a_engelmayer,,1945.298,1960.656,"And I was going to get to that, and I'd like to turn in a moment, if I may, just to the text of the rule, because I... the answer to your hypothetical would be yes, the district court does have the power under Rule 29(c), in our view, to act within the 7 days after the verdict to grant the judgment of acquittal, but--"
1995.94-9247,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1960.656,1961.227,Without a motion.
1995.94-9247,1,37863,paul_a_engelmayer,,1961.227,1964.57,"--On its own motion, absolutely, and I'd like, if I may in just--"
1995.94-9247,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1964.57,1965.211,"Well, you've--"
1995.94-9247,1,37863,paul_a_engelmayer,,1965.211,1965.892,--a moment to turn to the text of that.
1995.94-9247,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1965.892,1966.343,--Is it also obligated to?
1995.94-9247,1,37863,paul_a_engelmayer,,1966.343,1968.363,"Yes, it would be."
1995.94-9247,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1975.269,1977.5,"Yes, but what's the source of the obligation, is what I want to know?"
1995.94-9247,1,37863,paul_a_engelmayer,,1980.692,1989.817,I think the source of the authority is that the lack of sufficient evidence is a due process violation.
1995.94-9247,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1989.817,1992.83,The obligation was not to allow the case to go to the jury in the first place.
1995.94-9247,1,37863,paul_a_engelmayer,,1993.35,1995.641,"That's right, and it's plain error if the district court--"
1995.94-9247,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1995.641,1996.242,--go to the jury.
1995.94-9247,1,37863,paul_a_engelmayer,,1996.242,2000.335,--allows on its watch an insufficient case to result in a verdict and does not overturn--
1995.94-9247,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2000.335,2001.616,But that does not depend on the rule.
1995.94-9247,1,37863,paul_a_engelmayer,,2006.978,2011.944,"--Much as it would be for other abuses that could occur at trial, such as prosecutorial misconduct, for example."
1995.94-9247,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2011.944,2013.654,But these things are never plain.
1995.94-9247,1,37863,paul_a_engelmayer,,2030.393,2031.354,Justice Breyer--
1995.94-9247,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2031.354,2031.825,--it's too complicated.
1995.94-9247,1,37863,paul_a_engelmayer,,2031.825,2039.68,"--the defendant pays a price there for not having properly raised this below and perhaps obtained a more careful, thoughtful discussion from the district court."
1995.94-9247,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2039.68,2052.239,"Suppose on the eighth day, as was alleged to have happened in this case, there's a new opinion from the court of appeals indicating that it was clear error to introduce certain testimony, and without that testimony the verdict simply can't stand?"
1995.94-9247,1,37863,paul_a_engelmayer,,2052.239,2054.382,Let me address that in two steps.
1995.94-9247,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2117.184,2126.401,"Well, and even if it didn't, the new law would certainly have to be applied by the court of appeals on appeal, wouldn't it, in deciding whether the case should have ever gone to the jury?"
1995.94-9247,1,37863,paul_a_engelmayer,,2126.401,2137.768,"--There actually is a circuit split, Justice Scalia, where the issue is not raised below as to which law to apply under a plain error standard, but where it was preserved, there's no question that you would be applying the new law."
1995.94-9247,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2137.768,2152.127,"Mr. Engelmayer, I think Justice Breyer and I may disagree, and I'd be interested to know the Government's position as to whether the district judge, in passing on a motion for a new trial, applies the same standard as the court of... or, not a motion for a new trial, a motion for judgment of acquittal."
1995.94-9247,1,37863,paul_a_engelmayer,,2179.365,2180.927,What you stated is our position.
1995.94-9247,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2197.486,2199.988,I guess my question does not turn on credibility or not credibility.
1995.94-9247,1,37863,paul_a_engelmayer,,2224.836,2240.365,"Well, I think what I'm saying in the same practical spirit in which your question was phrased is that it does, as a practical matter, make it a... put the defendant on much more of an uphill road in order to establish insufficiency in the court of appeals than in the district court, and that is the price the defendant pays for not having made the motion."
1995.94-9247,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2253.864,2276.271,"Mr. Engelmayer, may I ask you about the possibility of a theoretical difference, and I mean, I understand your answer to say that there isn't this difference, but wouldn't it be possible for the district judge, ruling on a motion made within the time, to say, no... the conviction depends upon acceptance of the testimony of X.--"
1995.94-9247,1,37863,paul_a_engelmayer,,2295.672,2297.121,I don't think so.
1995.94-9247,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2326.611,2327.262,Yes.
1995.94-9247,1,37863,paul_a_engelmayer,,2338.248,2338.529,Right.
1995.94-9247,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2344.984,2345.344,Right.
1995.94-9247,1,37863,paul_a_engelmayer,,2345.344,2346.516,Our position--
1995.94-9247,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2346.516,2348.807,It does not speak to the judge's action.
1995.94-9247,1,37863,paul_a_engelmayer,,2348.807,2354.66,"--Well, I think it's a general term, unlike Rule 29(a), which specifically identifies the two movants."
1995.94-9247,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2359.092,2359.412,Right.
1995.94-9247,1,37863,paul_a_engelmayer,,2359.412,2374.673,"So our view is that the general term, motion for judgment of acquittal in 29(c) properly encompasses both of the previous types of motion, defendant's and the court's, that are listed in 29(a), and as a result the court is bound by the same 7-day deadline."
1995.94-9247,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2375.204,2382.279,"But what is... but you would agree, xx to look at paragraph (a) to find the authority in xx is that right, then?"
1995.94-9247,1,37863,paul_a_engelmayer,,2382.279,2384.349,--I think... I think--
1995.94-9247,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2384.349,2390.474,"You see, some of us were inclined to say well, let's not even look at (a), and you kind of agree with your opponent that we should look at (a)."
1995.94-9247,1,37863,paul_a_engelmayer,,2390.474,2400.171,"--Well, I think my opponent suggests that there is no temporal aspect, temporal limitation to (a) in that the text of the... the clear text, the clear headline of (a) which says, before verdict, is irrelevant."
1995.94-9247,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2419.993,2421.523,For acting on its own motion.
1995.94-9247,1,37863,paul_a_engelmayer,,2421.523,2422.274,"--and (c) is a general term, and if--"
1995.94-9247,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2422.274,2423.075,"Well, but Mr.--"
1995.94-9247,1,37863,paul_a_engelmayer,,2431.891,2432.853,"--Right, but it's a general term."
1995.94-9247,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2435.404,2442.22,"So you would find the... I want to be sure, you would find the authority for the judge to act on his own arising from (a) rather than from any inherent power in the judge."
1995.94-9247,1,37863,paul_a_engelmayer,,2442.22,2458.157,"--We would find the authority for the judge to act on his own to arise in (c) under the term, motion for judgment of acquittal, and we would find... we would help give meaning to the (c) term, motion for judgment of acquittal, from the language in (a) where two types of motions is listed, and one of those is, and I quote, on its own motion, referring to the court."
1995.94-9247,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2458.157,2458.999,"I understand, yes."
1995.94-9247,1,37863,paul_a_engelmayer,,2458.999,2470.888,"And I would point out that that is a more favorable reading to the district court than the alternative, where there is a strong negative implication that the court has no authority after the verdict at all because (a) affirmatively sets out the authority in the preverdict phase."
1995.94-9247,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2470.888,2474.768,"Mr. Engelmayer, two questions."
1995.94-9247,1,37863,paul_a_engelmayer,,2483.463,2486.415,"Strictly speaking, that is correct, Justice O'Connor."
1995.94-9247,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2486.415,2489.297,This was a motion made by the defendant that was late.
1995.94-9247,1,37863,paul_a_engelmayer,,2489.297,2490.259,That is right.
1995.94-9247,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2490.259,2491.13,Okay.
1995.94-9247,1,37863,paul_a_engelmayer,,2531.908,2544.948,"Our reading would be, rather, that the term motion, not being subject in either of those sentences to any limiting language, applies to both types of motion set forth in (a), and I think there's actually an interesting analogue under the Federal Rules, and--"
1995.94-9247,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2544.948,2554.094,"Before we get to analogues, just tell me why it says, may on such motion in one sentence, and conspicuously does not say on such motion in the next sentence."
1995.94-9247,1,37863,paul_a_engelmayer,,2555.875,2557.358,"--I don't, but I think it may just be that--"
1995.94-9247,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2557.358,2558.006,I thought not.
1995.94-9247,1,37863,paul_a_engelmayer,,2558.006,2559.929,--It may be that it is... but I don't think it may be... it may not be a--
1995.94-9247,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2559.929,2561.829,It's quite obvious and conspicuous.
1995.94-9247,1,37863,paul_a_engelmayer,,2575.606,2576.007,--Right.
1995.94-9247,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2576.007,2579.33,"It just sticks out like that, and you say there's no explanation for it."
1995.94-9247,1,37863,paul_a_engelmayer,,2579.33,2584.084,"Let me try... let me give you the analogue, because I think it actually may help to answer this question."
1995.94-9247,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2657.532,2661.904,"Mr. Engelmayer, there's one concern that I had about an earlier answer you gave."
1995.94-9247,1,37863,paul_a_engelmayer,,2670.62,2681.168,"--Or for another reason, if I may, Justice Ginsburg, which is that the court may have wished to preserve the Government's right to appeal under the Double Jeopardy Clause a conviction whereas had--"
1995.94-9247,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2681.168,2681.907,Yes.
1995.94-9247,1,37863,paul_a_engelmayer,,2686.44,2686.88,--Right.
1995.94-9247,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2686.88,2697.116,"Right, but you were... you recognized the possibility of a judge's own... in the judge's mind, she has missed something."
1995.94-9247,1,37863,paul_a_engelmayer,,2715.259,2715.61,"Yes, it was."
1995.94-9247,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2715.61,2722.444,Do we make no distinction between the slips made by a representative that the State has provided to the defendant?
1995.94-9247,1,37863,paul_a_engelmayer,,2722.444,2734.72,"This rule makes no distinction, and the text of the rule, I think, governs, but your point that a court can informally prod a defendant's counsel as the time is running to make such a motion is certainly a correct one."
1995.94-9247,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2764.302,2770.796,I wasn't clear where you went with your explanation to us about Rules 33 and 34.
1995.94-9247,1,37863,paul_a_engelmayer,,2773.209,2774.199,"Oh, I--"
1995.94-9247,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2774.199,2775.972,--with a judgment of acquittal.
1995.94-9247,1,37863,paul_a_engelmayer,,2775.972,2777.01,--I certainly agree with that.
1995.94-9247,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2796.094,2815.025,"Yes, but I... that's a very interesting argument, but I don't see how it doesn't work against you, because in this case there is no double jeopardy problem, and so the court's power to enter the acquittal should be greater, and the rules may recognize that, arguably, by this silence."
1995.94-9247,1,37863,paul_a_engelmayer,,2815.025,2828.665,"And the court's powers are greater, Justice Kennedy, in that, unlike in the new trial context the court does, in our view, under 29(c) have the power to order a judgment of acquittal following the verdict, even if the defendant has not asked for that relief."
1995.94-9247,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2828.665,2829.186,Yes.
1995.94-9247,1,37863,paul_a_engelmayer,,2829.186,2842.474,"It just so happens, though that that, the time limit that the court is constrained by is the same 7-day, unless timely extended, time limit that the defendant is constrained by in Rule 29(c)."
1995.94-9247,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2846.397,2857.483,"Before you do that, why is it constrained by the same... I mean, it's not... it isn't granted by (c), and why is it constrained by (c), the time in which the judge can act on his own?"
1995.94-9247,1,37863,paul_a_engelmayer,,2857.483,2878.558,"--If one construes in (c) the expression, a motion for judgment of acquittal, to include a motion for judgment of acquittal on the court's own... on the court's initiative, which is a type of motion that is adverted to in (a), then such a motion on the court's own initiative must be made with 7 days after the jury is discharged, or within time extended afterwards."
1995.94-9247,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2884.342,2889.685,"What if he says, I forgot to ask the clerk to make the entry but I told myself I was going to extend the time a few days?"
1995.94-9247,1,37863,paul_a_engelmayer,,2889.685,2895.928,"--That would... I think would really get more towards the formality of what constitutes a motion, I would think."
1995.94-9247,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2895.928,2896.84,But how do you rule in that case?
1995.94-9247,1,37863,paul_a_engelmayer,,2896.84,2899.742,I think the judge would have to put something on the record in a timely fashion--
1995.94-9247,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2899.742,2900.152,Within the 7 days.
1995.94-9247,1,37863,paul_a_engelmayer,,2900.152,2900.481,--because otherwise--
1995.94-9247,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2900.481,2906.806,"Well, doesn't that suggest that there's some flaws in your argument that a judge can do... act on his own within 7 days?"
1995.94-9247,1,37863,paul_a_engelmayer,,2914.803,2932.655,"--Mr. Chief Justice, I think we might well require that the judge put on the record, say, after a verdict that I'm troubled by the close nature of the sufficiency here, and I'm going to reserve to myself the right to enter judgement of acquittal up through sentencing, or whatnot, and I don't think that would be any problem."
1995.94-9247,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2941.49,2943.09,But you are bending the rules to a certain extent.
1995.94-9247,1,37863,paul_a_engelmayer,,2946.753,2950.566,"--Well, it says on a... if the court may enter a judgment of acquittal on--"
1995.94-9247,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2950.566,2954.077,"Once you say that motion means on the court's own motion, I mean, you can make up all sorts of things."
1995.94-9247,1,37863,paul_a_engelmayer,,2967.978,2972.109,"--If the court can make its own motion before the verdict, I don't see why it couldn't make it afterwards."
1995.94-9247,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2972.629,2974.79,Why does the Government take a position like this?
1995.94-9247,1,37863,paul_a_engelmayer,,2984.878,3002.569,"--I think it's the correct reading of the rule, Mr. Chief Justice, and the alternative, of course, would simply be for the court, if it was stripped of power after the verdict, to call up defense counsel and say, you might think of coming down to my courtroom within the next 7 days and making... making such a motion yourself, with the same effect."
1995.94-9247,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3002.569,3011.117,"But don't many judges ask, just as a matter of course at the end of the trial, is there a motion going to be filed under rule 29?"
1995.94-9247,1,37863,paul_a_engelmayer,,3011.117,3012.146,"Yes, and--"
1995.94-9247,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3012.146,3012.757,"I mean, they do."
1995.94-9247,1,37863,paul_a_engelmayer,,3012.757,3013.959,--And in the typical case--
1995.94-9247,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3013.959,3015.859,"I think this is an aberration, this thing."
1995.94-9247,1,37863,paul_a_engelmayer,,3015.859,3021.472,--I think the whole case is an aberration in the sense that the overwhelming... in the overwhelming majority of cases these motions are made--
1995.94-9247,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3021.472,3025.796,"It's an aberration, but it is rather unusual to have a fellow who everybody thinks is innocent sitting in jail."
1995.94-9247,1,37863,paul_a_engelmayer,,3025.796,3027.806,"--Well, it's not everybody who thinks he's innocent."
1995.94-9247,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3027.806,3032.168,"Well, I mean, at least if you take the judge's analysis of the record, which we're doing for purposes of this appeal."
1995.94-9247,1,37863,paul_a_engelmayer,,3032.168,3035.601,We the Government believe the evidence was sufficient.
1995.94-9247,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3050.552,3057.636,What is the scope of the district judge's authority on a postverdict motion?
1995.94-9247,1,37863,paul_a_engelmayer,,3063.94,3093.093,"The district judge realistically, because of the theory of plain error which I've set out earlier, and we're not aware, by the way, of any court of appeals that has ever held that the plain error standard was decisive on a sufficiency claim that the nature of the standard mattered, realistically a district court will almost never have to get to a 2255 motion, because one way or the other, plain error analysis on the sufficiency question on direct appeal should dispose of it."
1995.94-9247,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3093.46,3103.437,"If I'm right, though, that that failed here, that the Sixth Circuit considered... there wasn't only one question raised on the appeal from the judgment, was there?"
1995.94-9247,1,37863,paul_a_engelmayer,,3112.112,3112.913,--Not in this case.
1995.94-9247,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3126.903,3131.376,"But let's assume the Sixth Circuit affirmed, didn't find any plain error, so there s another appeal after the sentence--"
1995.94-9247,1,37863,paul_a_engelmayer,,3131.376,3131.777,--Right.
1995.94-9247,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3131.777,3135.518,"--and then we're left with what, 2255?"
1995.94-9247,1,37863,paul_a_engelmayer,,3135.518,3149.679,"And the 2255 would fail under any theory, because sufficiency will have been raised and lost in the court of appeals, and ineffective assistance of counsel would fail to show prejudice because there would be a legal sufficiency, and therefore any timing mess-up by the lawyer would have been, in effect, harmless error, so--"
1995.94-9247,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3149.679,3159.126,"I thought you had raised those two possibilities as discrete, but now you're saying if you lose one, if you lose the plain error review on the circuit, you can forget the 2255."
1995.94-9247,1,37863,paul_a_engelmayer,,3159.126,3174.109,"--Except in the highly exceptional case, Justice Ginsburg, where the existence of reasonable doubt was so much in equipoise that maybe the plain error standard was dispositive, and therefore, except in that situation there would be... it would be duplicative to raise an ineffective assistance claim."
1995.94-9247,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3242.894,3246.246,"Thank you, Mr. Engelmayer."
1995.94-9247,2,29474,james_a_christopherson,,3249.138,3251.95,"Mr. Chief Justice, if it please the Court:"
1995.94-9247,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3292.356,3294.556,Do you know if he denied the motion one time?
1995.94-9247,2,29474,james_a_christopherson,,3294.556,3307.395,"He denied the motion in August and, again, in the transcript he said, I agonized and wrote two separate opinions, and then when it came the day for sentencing he called the counsel in and on the record explained that he had changed his mind."
1995.94-9247,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3350.224,3352.636,"Thank you, Mr. Christopherson."
