1985.84-1023,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,11.762,"Mrs. Stemler, I think you may proceed whenever you are ready."
1985.84-1023,0,38355,patty_merkamp_stemler,,11.762,15.869,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1985.84-1023,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,169.151,172.133,"Mrs. Stemler, do you think the case is moot?"
1985.84-1023,0,38355,patty_merkamp_stemler,,172.133,174.055,Do I think the case is moot?
1985.84-1023,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,603.945,607.007,What do you call a superseding indictment?
1985.84-1023,0,38355,patty_merkamp_stemler,,607.007,627.219,"A superseding indictment, I haven't really... I haven't been able to find a definition of superseding indictment, but what I would call a superseding indictment is one that replaces the original indictment that charges offenses that arise from the same transaction or series of transactions as those offenses that were charged in the original indictment."
1985.84-1023,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,627.219,639.916,And you would... I gather from what you have said that there would be some superseding indictments where a discretionary continuance certainly should be granted.
1985.84-1023,0,38355,patty_merkamp_stemler,,639.916,640.822,That is correct.
1985.84-1023,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,644.541,649.944,"But you just say the act just doesn't make it mandatory except once, just once."
1985.84-1023,0,38355,patty_merkamp_stemler,,649.944,650.351,That's right.
1985.84-1023,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,651.897,656.083,"As long as the superseding indictment relates to the same transaction, right?"
1985.84-1023,0,38355,patty_merkamp_stemler,,656.083,656.88,That is correct.
1985.84-1023,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,662.018,667.015,Even if the superseding indictment charges a violation of an additional statute?
1985.84-1023,0,38355,patty_merkamp_stemler,,667.015,668.484,--That is correct.
1985.84-1023,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,681.369,684.852,Even if an entirely new crime is added?
1985.84-1023,0,38355,patty_merkamp_stemler,,684.852,687.382,That is correct.
1985.84-1023,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,689.132,691.1,You seemed to hesitate.
1985.84-1023,0,38355,patty_merkamp_stemler,,698.909,705.5,--I think that as long as the offense is related to the other... the offenses that were charged in the original indictment--
1985.84-1023,1,29518,judy_clare_clarke,,1317.129,1321.268,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1985.84-1023,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1373.576,1382.213,"But it is mandatory, as I read it, from the date on which the defendant first appears through counsel."
1985.84-1023,1,29518,judy_clare_clarke,,1382.213,1393.177,"That is correct, Justice Rehnquist, and the definition then that this Court must look to is what does the term ""first appears through counsel"" mean, and we have to look at the history and how that language got into the statute."
1985.84-1023,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1415.606,1420.54,You are paraphrasing... you just paraphrased what the Conference submitted to Congress?
1985.84-1023,1,29518,judy_clare_clarke,,1420.54,1421.04,That's right.
1985.84-1023,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1464.242,1475.285,"Well, but the Congress could so easily have said from the date on which an indictment is first returned if it had meant what you said."
1985.84-1023,1,29518,judy_clare_clarke,,1475.285,1480.954,"--But Congress did hook it in to the filing of the indictment, and Congress went a step further."
1985.84-1023,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1513.675,1517.283,"But first appearance through counsel could be at an arraignment, couldn't it?"
1985.84-1023,1,29518,judy_clare_clarke,,1517.283,1518.939,It could be at an arraignment.
1985.84-1023,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1526.373,1529.2,So they just didn't tie it to indictment at all.
1985.84-1023,1,29518,judy_clare_clarke,,1529.2,1531.262,--I would disagree with the Justice--
1985.84-1023,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1531.262,1532.512,If it can be at an arraignment--
1985.84-1023,1,29518,judy_clare_clarke,,1532.512,1535.151,--What happens at an arraignment?
1985.84-1023,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1537.213,1542.365,"--But it's not the date of the indictment... I mean, the arraignment doesn't necessarily take place on the date of the indictment."
1985.84-1023,1,29518,judy_clare_clarke,,1542.365,1543.834,"No, no."
1985.84-1023,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1604.998,1613.041,"Well, counsel, suppose the superseding indictment merely changed the date from the 3rd to the 4th of August?"
1985.84-1023,1,29518,judy_clare_clarke,,1613.041,1616.555,"--As is similar in this case, Justice Marshall."
1985.84-1023,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1617.805,1618.508,I realize that.
1985.84-1023,1,29518,judy_clare_clarke,,1618.508,1619.633,--The superseding... I'm sorry.
1985.84-1023,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1619.633,1624.348,So what is the need for a whole lot of time on that?
1985.84-1023,1,29518,judy_clare_clarke,,1624.348,1626.816,"Well, then we go back--"
1985.84-1023,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1626.816,1632.017,Because I'm going to take it to when they change the time from 12:15 to 12:16.
1985.84-1023,1,29518,judy_clare_clarke,,1632.017,1640.436,--Then the problem becomes the super... the defense preparation period becomes discretionary at the hands of the government.
1985.84-1023,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1640.436,1644.482,What additional weight does that put on the defendant?
1985.84-1023,1,29518,judy_clare_clarke,,1644.482,1648.104,"Well, the problem is this Court is interpreting (c)(2)."
1985.84-1023,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1648.104,1650.854,What additional weight does that put on the defendant?
1985.84-1023,1,29518,judy_clare_clarke,,1650.854,1653.244,"Well, I would be speculating, but I will be happy to answer your question."
1985.84-1023,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1693.493,1694.79,Wouldn't that Be up to the judge?
1985.84-1023,1,29518,judy_clare_clarke,,1694.79,1696.82,"--I'm sorry, sir."
1985.84-1023,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1696.82,1699.131,Wouldn't that be up to the judge to decide that?
1985.84-1023,1,29518,judy_clare_clarke,,1699.131,1701.396,To decide whether or not--
1985.84-1023,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1701.396,1705.441,Whether or not you needed more time to change from the 5th to the 6th.
1985.84-1023,1,29518,judy_clare_clarke,,1705.441,1714.53,"--That's precisely why Congress enacted the mandatory defense preparation period, because the judges, because of the pressures of the outer time limits of the act--"
1985.84-1023,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1714.53,1716.092,I thought the decision was that it was automatic.
1985.84-1023,1,29518,judy_clare_clarke,,1727.027,1728.26,--That's right.
1985.84-1023,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1728.26,1728.979,That's your position.
1985.84-1023,1,29518,judy_clare_clarke,,1728.979,1729.479,That's right.
1985.84-1023,2,38355,patty_merkamp_stemler,,3103.099,3105.676,"Just a few points, Your Honor."
1985.84-1023,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3265.581,3266.425,Why wasn't it?
1985.84-1023,2,38355,patty_merkamp_stemler,,3271.986,3284.372,"--I think it's just the choice of the individual prosecutor, and there is nothing to reflect, in the record that reflects why in this case they chose to get the superseding indictment rather than to ask the Court to amend the indictment."
1985.84-1023,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3285.107,3295.228,What would the government do about the problem of the subsection (b) requirement of a date relating to arrest?
1985.84-1023,2,38355,patty_merkamp_stemler,,3295.228,3310.284,"--That's right, The Courts of Appeals have addressed the question of whether a superseding indictment has to be returned within 30 days of arrest and have uniformly held that it does not, that only the original indictment has to be returned within 30 days of arrest."
1985.84-1023,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3365.512,3373.727,"I don't recall what the rule provision is, if any, on amending indictments."
1985.84-1023,2,38355,patty_merkamp_stemler,,3375.977,3378.335,"I don't know, Your Honor."
1985.84-1023,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3390.986,3391.611,"Thank you, counsel."
