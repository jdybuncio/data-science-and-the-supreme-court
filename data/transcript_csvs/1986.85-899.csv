1986.85-899,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,56.92,"Ms. Dewey, you may proceed whenever you are ready."
1986.85-899,0,29933,julia_dicocco_dewey,,56.92,59.622,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1986.85-899,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,300.894,325.026,"Mrs. Dewey, what if a defendant or the defendant in this case in this case refused to sign a written confession because of a belief that only written statements could be introduced in evidence against him?"
1986.85-899,0,29933,julia_dicocco_dewey,,325.026,341.221,"Justice O'Connor, I don't believe that this Court has every held that the individual knowledge of a defendant or suspect, a knowledge that's not communicated to the police officers, would have any bearing on whether there was a free and voluntary act by the defendant."
1986.85-899,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,346.007,361.901,"The trial court would have to determine, would it not, that the respondent knowingly gave us his right, understanding that the statements could be used against him?"
1986.85-899,0,29933,julia_dicocco_dewey,,361.901,368.888,"It would still be a factual determination for the trial court, if evidence of that nature came before the trial court at a suppression hearing."
1986.85-899,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,368.888,391.152,"Do you think that when someone, a defendant, makes a waiver of this type which is selective or perhaps conditional, that that suggests that there may be some uncertainty on the part of the defendant about what statements can be used against him?"
1986.85-899,0,29933,julia_dicocco_dewey,,391.152,397.621,A selective or conditional waiver has never been held to be an equivocal or an ambiguous situation.
1986.85-899,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,399.823,413.167,"Well, I didn't ask or suggest that it was ambiguous, but, does it possibly suggest a lack of knowledge of how the statements could be used?"
1986.85-899,0,29933,julia_dicocco_dewey,,413.167,427.927,"--Under the facts of particular case, it might be possible theta selective waiver, if it were somehow inherently inconsistent, could suggest a lack of knowledge or could suggest that the defendant did not truly comprehend his Miranda rights."
1986.85-899,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,467.032,467.432,Excuse me.
1986.85-899,0,29933,julia_dicocco_dewey,,486.862,490.897,The result should be same as was held by the Connecticut trial court.
1986.85-899,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,517.731,526.82,"Well, was advised and he said he understood it, but in fact he didn't understand it if he thought that anything he said orally couldn't be used against him."
1986.85-899,0,29933,julia_dicocco_dewey,,526.82,534.343,"But in the present case, the defendant himself testified that he did understand the Miranda rights and he did understand that what was said could be used against him."
1986.85-899,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,544.982,547.934,You are saying that my question is not this case?
1986.85-899,0,29933,julia_dicocco_dewey,,547.934,549.52,Yes.
1986.85-899,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,549.52,558.375,"Well, part of the Miranda warning, Ms. Dewey, is that whatever you say may be used against you in court, isn't it?"
1986.85-899,0,29933,julia_dicocco_dewey,,558.375,563.862,"Yes, it is part of the Miranda warning, a warning this defendant received on four separate occasions."
1986.85-899,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,575.587,579.455,"He said explicitly,"
1986.85-899,0,29933,julia_dicocco_dewey,,582.407,582.741,"Oh, no."
1986.85-899,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,584.443,588.911,"You only inferred from the nature of the warning, of the Miranda warning?"
1986.85-899,0,29933,julia_dicocco_dewey,,588.911,596.333,"--The nature of the Miranda warnings, plus the fact that the officers testified that upon each individual right they asked the defendant, ""Do you understand this""?"
1986.85-899,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,597.35,598.633,"""Do you understand"", what?"
1986.85-899,0,29933,julia_dicocco_dewey,,598.633,600.635,"""Do you understand what I've just stated? """
1986.85-899,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,604.704,605.272,"They didn't say,"
1986.85-899,0,29933,julia_dicocco_dewey,,610.224,613.193,"No, I don't believe that they used those exact terms."
1986.85-899,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,617.83,621.199,"Mrs. Dewey, may I ask you a question, because you referred to what the trial court found."
1986.85-899,0,29933,julia_dicocco_dewey,,637.092,638.16,Yes.
1986.85-899,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,638.16,654.003,"And the Supreme Court of Connecticut said that the trial court impliedly found that the defendant had requested counsel, and then they point out in a footnote that that's what they support that with a footnote."
1986.85-899,0,29933,julia_dicocco_dewey,,667.18,676.953,"There's an inconsistency is the Connecticut Supreme Court's decision in the regard, where they state that the trial court implied found that the defendant had requested counsel."
1986.85-899,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,700.549,705.87,We should a appraise we should look at the trial court's finding ourselves and not accept what the Supreme Court said about it then?
1986.85-899,0,29933,julia_dicocco_dewey,,705.87,722.546,"That is the state's position, yes, Your Honor, that there was never a factual finding made concerning the invocation, and because there was never a factual finding, the Connecticut Supreme Court by applying an automatic rule whenever the word ""attorney"" is mentioned, was in error."
1986.85-899,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,722.546,727.283,"Do you is there any explanation for the fact that,"
1986.85-899,0,29933,julia_dicocco_dewey,,741.876,743.709,Yes Justice Marshall.
1986.85-899,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,756.053,761.421,"Do you mean, yet, he knew that the officer was going to testify?"
1986.85-899,0,29933,julia_dicocco_dewey,,761.421,765.075,--There is no indication that he knew the officer was going to testify in this case.
1986.85-899,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,765.075,769.526,"Well, why did he not want a written statement?"
1986.85-899,0,29933,julia_dicocco_dewey,,769.526,779.399,"There could be any number of reasons including just a reluctance to put anything in writing which would not be dispositive, or the fact that he felt more comfortable talking about the incident."
1986.85-899,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,779.399,785.486,But he didn't have the slightest idea that it would be used against him?
1986.85-899,0,29933,julia_dicocco_dewey,,785.486,787.455,He was told that anything he said could be--
1986.85-899,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,787.455,796.928,"I said, so you think he had any idea it was going to be used against him when he made the statement?"
1986.85-899,0,29933,julia_dicocco_dewey,,796.928,803.867,"--One would have to presume that having been warned four times that if would be used against him, that he knew that that statement would be used against him."
1986.85-899,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,814.822,823.261,"Well, what in the rights that he was read said that, ""Don't make an oral"" I mean, ""Don't make a written statement""?"
1986.85-899,0,29933,julia_dicocco_dewey,,823.261,824.363,Absolutely nothing.
1986.85-899,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,840.706,843.825,Didn't he go again the next day?
1986.85-899,0,29933,julia_dicocco_dewey,,843.825,844.691,Excuse me?
1986.85-899,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,844.691,846.86,Didn't he go after two days in a row?
1986.85-899,0,29933,julia_dicocco_dewey,,846.86,847.393,No.
1986.85-899,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,849.228,852.346,"Yes, but it was two times, two separate times?"
1986.85-899,0,29933,julia_dicocco_dewey,,852.346,853.046,Only because the--
1986.85-899,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,853.046,856.965,"You said, standing there, that they save him four warnings."
1986.85-899,0,29933,julia_dicocco_dewey,,856.965,858.5,"--Within a matter of hours, yes, they did."
1986.85-899,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,858.5,860.417,"Well, that was four different times."
1986.85-899,0,29933,julia_dicocco_dewey,,860.417,864.321,"Yes, it was, because of four different situations that had happened between--"
1986.85-899,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,864.321,871.058,"And each one of the those occasions, he had no idea that they were going to use it against him?"
1986.85-899,0,29933,julia_dicocco_dewey,,871.058,883.2,"--One would have to assume that, having been advised and having had no there being no indication that he didn't comprehend, that he did know that they would be used against him."
1986.85-899,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,883.2,890.971,"May I ask this question, was the respondent ever informed that the police were attempting to the tape his statement?"
1986.85-899,0,29933,julia_dicocco_dewey,,890.971,896.959,It's not a matter of record that the respondent was informed that they were attempting to tape record it.
1986.85-899,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,896.959,899.661,The police tried twice to do it?
1986.85-899,0,29933,julia_dicocco_dewey,,899.661,901.227,"Yes, they did?"
1986.85-899,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,901.227,910.183,"And when they discovered they'd fumbled that, then they undertook to write our their recollection of what he had said?"
1986.85-899,0,29933,julia_dicocco_dewey,,910.183,917.021,"They tried twice to tape it and within a matter of days they did reduce the narrative statement to writings, yes."
1986.85-899,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,917.021,919.123,They did attempt to write it out?
1986.85-899,0,29933,julia_dicocco_dewey,,919.123,919.723,Yes.
1986.85-899,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,919.723,923.692,And they used that to refresh their recollection before they testified?
1986.85-899,0,29933,julia_dicocco_dewey,,923.692,926.561,"Yes, they did use their written noted to reflect their recollection."
1986.85-899,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,926.561,941.338,"Is it reasonable for us to suppose that if respondent had known they trying to tape his statement, or to write it out, that he might have declined to talk to them any further?"
1986.85-899,0,29933,julia_dicocco_dewey,,945.19,949.844,"Yes, if he had known that they were attempting to tape record it, would he have been more reluctant to give an oral statement."
1986.85-899,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,949.844,951.36,"Yes, yes."
1986.85-899,0,29933,julia_dicocco_dewey,,965.168,975.058,But it was also obvious in this case that he wanted to tell the police officers his version of the events in order to possibly exculpate himself from any involvement in the sexual assault.
1986.85-899,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,975.058,984.331,"He was willing to do it orally, but my question is whether or not, in view of his not being informed, that actually he was misled?"
1986.85-899,0,29933,julia_dicocco_dewey,,984.331,986.297,I don't believe he was misled in this situation.
1986.85-899,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1008.047,1011.899,"Mrs. Dewey, earlier I asked you about the trial Court and the Supreme Court."
1986.85-899,0,29933,julia_dicocco_dewey,,1015.516,1016.302,"Yes, they are."
1986.85-899,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1021.837,1023.587,"70 and 71 A, thank you."
1986.85-899,0,29933,julia_dicocco_dewey,,1023.587,1024.954,"Yes, they are."
1986.85-899,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1079.723,1080.473,"Thank you, Ms. Dewey."
1986.85-899,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1086.843,1094.849,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1986.85-899,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1221.532,1227.869,In any of those cases was the refusal accompanied by a request for counsel as it was here?
1986.85-899,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1227.869,1235.042,"Well, I think in those cases they have refused at least on some occasions to sign statements without the advice of counsel."
1986.85-899,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1235.042,1235.975,Which one?
1986.85-899,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1237.042,1240.862,"A number are cited in our brief, Justice Stevens, but I cannot tell you specifically."
1986.85-899,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1240.862,1246.766,"Because I thought this case was a rather unusual fact pattern myself, but you say there are a lot of cases just like it?"
1986.85-899,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1246.766,1252.336,"Well, I think probably the typical fact pattern is the suspect simply refuses... says something to the effect that,"
1986.85-899,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1253.786,1254.336,"Correct, so--"
1986.85-899,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1254.336,1259.49,Essentially asserting his right to remain silent rather than his right to request the presence of an attorney.
1986.85-899,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1259.49,1260.74,"--The cases in which he says,"
1986.85-899,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1265.008,1283.355,"I think that's true, Your Honor, but I think that the point that I'm trying to make is the rationality of the defendant's decision and whether or not he appreciates whether or not there is an inconsistency between the action that he took and his understanding of his rights."
1986.85-899,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1292.461,1300.781,What do you say about the Supreme Court's reference to all the phone cells and the failure of the police to inquire whether he was trying to locate his lawyer or not?
1986.85-899,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1300.781,1307.471,"--Well, I think one statement to make at the outset is that apparently respondent was not in fact trying to contact his attorney."
1986.85-899,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1310.256,1312.306,How do we know that?
1986.85-899,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1312.306,1314.041,--I believe there was testimony to that effect at the trial.
1986.85-899,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1325.73,1331.217,But the state Supreme Court seemed to think they had a duty to find out whether he wanted to wait for his lawyer?
1986.85-899,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1331.217,1338.239,"--Well, I think I should say something also about the factual findings of the lower courts here, as you were discussing before."
1986.85-899,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1363.605,1376.531,"No, but isn't it correct that they in effect treated the trial court as having held that there had been an intelligent waiver after a request for counsel, whereas and they treated the two questions separately, and that issue isn't involved here?"
1986.85-899,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1376.531,1384.685,"--Well, I think what the Connecticut Supreme Court did, Your Honor, was accent the trial court's findings about what occurred and went on to make legal conclusion about the significance--"
1986.85-899,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1384.685,1390.874,"Well, but they also said, the trial court impliedly found that the defendant had requested counsel."
1986.85-899,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1392.674,1393.457,"--No, not at all."
1986.85-899,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1427.047,1428.114,Mr. Rothfeld.
1986.85-899,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1428.114,1429.166,"Yes, Justice Marshall."
1986.85-899,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1429.166,1436.486,Does the FBI rule still say that if a prisoner asks for a lawyer you stop questioning him?
1986.85-899,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1436.486,1439.772,"I think that clearly is the rule, yes, Justice Marshall."
1986.85-899,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1439.772,1440.605,You said what?
1986.85-899,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1440.605,1441.557,"Yes, indeed it is."
1986.85-899,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1441.557,1445.026,"That's still the rule, so it's a good rule, isn't it?"
1986.85-899,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1445.026,1446.442,It's the rule the Court set down in Miranda.
1986.85-899,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1451.013,1456.132,"Once a man asks for a lawyer, you stop questioning him?"
1986.85-899,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1456.132,1457.334,"That's correct, Justice Marshall."
1986.85-899,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1457.334,1460.202,And this time you questioned him four times?
1986.85-899,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1460.202,1464.421,"Well, the question here is whether or not he in fact requested a lawyer."
1986.85-899,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1589.35,1597.169,"Do you agree that if he had known that this would be used against him, he would have continued to talk?"
1986.85-899,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1597.169,1600.871,"--I think that that was the actual finding of the trial court, Justice Marshall."
1986.85-899,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1600.871,1602.24,I'm asking you.
1986.85-899,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1602.24,1614.148,"Well, I not having participated in the proceedings I can't give a personal opinion, but I think we have to accept the trial court's conclusion that he understood his rights and nevertheless preceded to talk."
1986.85-899,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1617.083,1621.904,"Not a general understanding of his rights, it's a particular one that,"
1986.85-899,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1627.289,1630.677,"The respondent was told here, Justice Marshall,"
1986.85-899,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1637.144,1638.194,"But he also said,"
1986.85-899,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1641.112,1649.452,"Well, I think as I was suggesting, there are these two types of reasons the suspect may rationally make that distinction."
1986.85-899,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1710.276,1711.793,"Thank you, Mr. Rothfeld."
1986.85-899,2,39334,robert_l_genuario,,1718.279,1721.714,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
1986.85-899,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1785.205,1787.407,"Is that the only question in the case, Mr. Genuario?"
1986.85-899,2,39334,robert_l_genuario,,1800.564,1818.776,The question of whether or not he understood his rights and understood that his oral statements could be used against him bears on a decision that this Court might make in finding whether his request for counsel was ambiguous or not.
1986.85-899,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1826.448,1829.15,"If he asked for counsel, it may go to that?"
1986.85-899,2,39334,robert_l_genuario,,1829.15,1829.984,That is correct.
1986.85-899,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1829.984,1834.388,"You didn't argue below, did you, that he didn't understand his rights?"
1986.85-899,2,39334,robert_l_genuario,,1834.388,1841.624,"We did argue on appeal, and I would like to correct both the Solicitor General's office and Attorney Dewey."
1986.85-899,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1870.061,1872.494,Was that argued before--
1986.85-899,2,39334,robert_l_genuario,,1872.494,1875.046,That was argued before the Conecticut Supreme Court--
1986.85-899,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1875.046,1878.381,--That he didn't know that the oral statements could be used against him?
1986.85-899,2,39334,robert_l_genuario,,1878.381,1882.333,"--That is correct, Your Honor."
1986.85-899,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1885.118,1888.503,"The trial court found against your client on that latter point, didn't it?"
1986.85-899,2,39334,robert_l_genuario,,1888.503,1893.641,--The trial court found that there had been a knowing and voluntary waiver.
1986.85-899,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1908.15,1917.756,"Mr. Genuario, I'm not sure I understand why the waiver here could he considered ambiguous."
1986.85-899,2,39334,robert_l_genuario,,1928.762,1938.301,"I think there is quite a bit ambiguous about it, Your Honor, and the ambiguity arises on two levels."
1986.85-899,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1949.791,1950.31,"He said,"
1986.85-899,2,39334,robert_l_genuario,,1971.688,1979.276,"--Well, if I might, Your Honor, the defendant did not say that,"
1986.85-899,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1999.505,2000.457,"Well, he said more than that."
1986.85-899,2,39334,robert_l_genuario,,2035.861,2037.777,"That's absolutely correct, Your Honor, and the question--"
1986.85-899,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2037.777,2039.563,"Well, what's ambiguous about that?"
1986.85-899,2,39334,robert_l_genuario,,2039.563,2041.379,"--Well, let me illustrate it this way."
1986.85-899,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2114.862,2127.669,"So, you would have no quarrel then, under those circumstances if the police had not made any notes of defendant's statements and had simply relied on their recollection in the testimony at trial?"
1986.85-899,2,39334,robert_l_genuario,,2127.669,2130.371,"Well, I think the issue goes further than that."
1986.85-899,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2130.371,2131.571,"Well, could you answer my question?"
1986.85-899,2,39334,robert_l_genuario,,2131.571,2132.573,"Certainly, Your Honor."
1986.85-899,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2150.951,2159.455,"Now, do you agree that my hypothesis meets your ambiguousness argument?"
1986.85-899,2,39334,robert_l_genuario,,2171.614,2186.374,"--It does on the first level, Your Honor, but it doesn't answer the question that Justice Marshall has asked, doesn't it imply that he doesn't understand the distinction and that therefore the reason he wants counsel, and the request for counsel."
1986.85-899,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2186.374,2191.426,"Well, I think a lot of people probably didn't realize that Miranda was quite this complicated."
1986.85-899,2,39334,robert_l_genuario,,2204.586,2206.402,"On the contrary, Your Honor."
1986.85-899,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2232.069,2235.355,But he requested counsel conditionally here.
1986.85-899,2,39334,robert_l_genuario,,2244.044,2254.851,"Well, nothing in any of the decisions of this Court have indicated that a conditional request for counsel is not an invocation of that right."
1986.85-899,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2254.851,2261.938,"Well, but a good many of our decisions see Miranda as a plain, simple, easy to follow principle, very simple."
1986.85-899,2,39334,robert_l_genuario,,2269.194,2273.313,I don't think I'm asking for any additional rules to be added on.
1986.85-899,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2288.239,2289.289,"Suppose he said,"
1986.85-899,2,39334,robert_l_genuario,,2306.665,2309.117,"Your Honor, we are not making the argument that counsel is--"
1986.85-899,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2309.117,2311.735,But why is that any more absurd than the argument you are making?
1986.85-899,2,39334,robert_l_genuario,,2321.758,2328.328,--He requested counsel for assistance with the police.
1986.85-899,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2328.328,2330.696,Only for a written statement?
1986.85-899,2,39334,robert_l_genuario,,2337.384,2344.123,And therein lies a very basic ambiguity in the situation in which he wanted counsel.
1986.85-899,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2349.158,2350.027,That's not what he said.
1986.85-899,2,39334,robert_l_genuario,,2364.468,2378.894,"--Again, I believe that a common man's interpretation of ""nothing in writings"" would lead to the conclusion that the statements were not to be written down, and I think that the--"
1986.85-899,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2378.894,2396.939,"Well, Mr. Genuario, do you take the position that every selective or conditional waiver of Miranda such as is in this case constitutes a full invocation of counsel for all purposes?"
1986.85-899,2,39334,robert_l_genuario,,2396.939,2400.558,--If the request is in the--
1986.85-899,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2400.558,2405.628,"It sounds like that's your position, that there just can't be a selective waiver."
1986.85-899,2,39334,robert_l_genuario,,2408.764,2421.221,"--Nothing we're saying would countermand the ruling of this Court in Edwards, which says that a defendant can in fact waive his right to counsel."
1986.85-899,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2422.839,2425.625,Selectively?
1986.85-899,2,39334,robert_l_genuario,,2433.445,2441.218,"--There are no magic words, Your Honor, and I think that the request that the individual makes has to be looked at in each and every case."
1986.85-899,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2448.205,2458.644,"Counsel, wouldn't you be much better off if he had testified as to why he did that?"
1986.85-899,2,39334,robert_l_genuario,,2463.131,2466.417,"Well, in that hypothetical--"
1986.85-899,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2466.417,2467.1,Wouldn't you be better off?
1986.85-899,2,39334,robert_l_genuario,,2467.1,2474.67,"--We might be better off, depending on what he said in his testimony."
1986.85-899,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2474.67,2477.455,"Well, you can't substitute your testimony."
1986.85-899,2,39334,robert_l_genuario,,2477.455,2479.057,"Absolutely not, and I wouldn't try to."
1986.85-899,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2479.057,2484.478,"So, wouldn't you be better off, and isn't it a missing point in your case?"
1986.85-899,2,39334,robert_l_genuario,,2484.478,2498.019,"Well, if in fact if in fact there were some evidence to the effect further evidence to the effect of a lack of understanding, that certainly would be a stronger case for us."
1986.85-899,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2498.721,2507.244,"We have a finding of understanding, don't we, by the trial court and no finding on that point by the Court of Appeals?"
1986.85-899,2,39334,robert_l_genuario,,2507.244,2512.111,--We have a finding by the trial court and no finding by the Supreme Court of Connecticut.
1986.85-899,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2537.513,2542.065,I thought you were just arguing this as a straightforward application of Miranda.
1986.85-899,2,39334,robert_l_genuario,,2542.065,2544.6,I think it is a straightforward application of--
1986.85-899,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2544.6,2547.052,"What is there to balance, then?"
1986.85-899,2,39334,robert_l_genuario,,2547.052,2552.105,"--Well, the question that this Court has to decide is under what circumstances--"
1986.85-899,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2552.105,2554.322,"Well, suppose we didn't held this in Miranda."
1986.85-899,2,39334,robert_l_genuario,,2560.461,2561.611,--What I'm suggesting is--
1986.85-899,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2561.611,2564.413,Is that right?
1986.85-899,2,39334,robert_l_genuario,,2564.413,2566.698,"--No, Your Honor, I don't think it is."
1986.85-899,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2566.698,2567.682,What's wrong with it?
1986.85-899,2,39334,robert_l_genuario,,2567.682,2577.638,"The question that I'm asking this Court to decide, or the question that I think is before this Court, is when does someone invoke his right to counsel."
1986.85-899,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2577.638,2582.375,"Well, does that mean how we should read Miranda, is that it?"
1986.85-899,2,39334,robert_l_genuario,,2582.375,2586.344,I think it means I think it certainly deals with an interpretation.
1986.85-899,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2586.344,2591.163,Let's suppose we read Miranda as not covering this case.
1986.85-899,2,39334,robert_l_genuario,,2599.169,2606.757,"Well, I think that our reasoning follows from Miranda, and I think it's consistent with Edwards."
1986.85-899,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2651.786,2656.506,"So, it doesn't require a lot of balancing, then, does it?"
1986.85-899,2,39334,robert_l_genuario,,2656.506,2658.708,"--No, I don't believe it does, Your Honor."
1986.85-899,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2699.449,2700.451,What if I'm the defendant
1986.85-899,2,39334,robert_l_genuario,,2745.112,2762.304,"I think that when a defendant requests counsel in a situation like that, then he has requested counsel and unless after a cessation of interrogation he comes back to the police, there can be no waiver."
1986.85-899,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2768.291,2769.977,"He hasn't said, ""I want counsel"", now."
1986.85-899,2,39334,robert_l_genuario,,2777.666,2781.868,He has indicated a need to have an attorney assist him.
1986.85-899,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2781.868,2784.737,If he gives a written statement.
1986.85-899,2,39334,robert_l_genuario,,2784.737,2786.153,"That's correct, that's correct."
1986.85-899,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2786.153,2788.539,"And you're saying,"
1986.85-899,2,39334,robert_l_genuario,,2795.091,2798.995,There's no claim that subsequently he could not waive that right.
1986.85-899,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2850.892,2852.36,"Thank you, Mr. Genuario."
1986.85-899,3,29933,julia_dicocco_dewey,,2858.33,2861.449,"Just briefly, Your Honor."
1986.85-899,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2912.215,2913.165,"Thank you, Ms. Dewey."
