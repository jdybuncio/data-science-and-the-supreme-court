1984.83-1545,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,59.82,"Mr. Booth, I think you may proceed whenever you're ready."
1984.83-1545,0,25049,gordon_dean_booth_jr,,59.82,63.503,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1984.83-1545,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,431.604,438.069,"Well, what precisely did the company mean by reversing the seniority or inverting the seniority?"
1984.83-1545,0,25049,gordon_dean_booth_jr,,446.454,449.306,This is only captain Plaintiffs.
1984.83-1545,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,459.073,470.01,"Yes, but as to the captains, you say the company advances a reasonable factor other than age, the fact it would invert the seniority, if I understand."
1984.83-1545,0,25049,gordon_dean_booth_jr,,471.14,483.749,"--Well, Your Honor, a lot of carriers, not all of them but a lot of carriers, feel very strongly that the most senior person in the cockpit should be the captain, the next most senior person should be the copilot, and the most junior person should be the flight engineer."
1984.83-1545,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,504.414,506.675,"Well, what is so bad about that?"
1984.83-1545,0,25049,gordon_dean_booth_jr,,506.675,516.852,"Well, there's a strong feeling among a lot of carriers that having someone who has been a captain become in a subordinate position is bad for command."
1984.83-1545,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,547.921,552.733,Someone who has previously been a captain is more apt to second-guess or backseat drive?
1984.83-1545,0,25049,gordon_dean_booth_jr,,552.733,554.025,"That's right, to interfere with the operation of the cockpit."
1984.83-1545,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,554.025,557.508,"Of course, that is not true for all airlines, is it?"
1984.83-1545,0,25049,gordon_dean_booth_jr,,557.508,559.028,That is not the view of all airlines.
1984.83-1545,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,595.16,602.637,"But if the captain flying as a flight engineer gets out of line, he's very easily dealt with."
1984.83-1545,0,25049,gordon_dean_booth_jr,,602.637,604.688,"Your Honor, he would be--"
1984.83-1545,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,604.688,605.969,"He's grounded, right?"
1984.83-1545,0,25049,gordon_dean_booth_jr,,605.969,611.463,"--Your Honor, he would be dealt with... I'm not sure that's true, first."
1984.83-1545,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,635.78,638.26,The other airlines have no trouble with it.
1984.83-1545,0,25049,gordon_dean_booth_jr,,638.26,644.454,"Your Honor, the other airlines have not experienced any known difficulty with it, those who have tried it."
1984.83-1545,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,653.739,657.633,"Well, I hope you're not relying on that only."
1984.83-1545,0,25049,gordon_dean_booth_jr,,657.633,658.704,"--No, Your Honor."
1984.83-1545,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,784.736,788.669,"Mr. Booth, can I ask you kind of a basic question that puzzles me a little."
1984.83-1545,0,25049,gordon_dean_booth_jr,,805.779,807.509,There are two different sets of Plaintiffs.
1984.83-1545,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,810.412,813.834,"I see, one applies to one set of Plaintiffs and the other applies to the other."
1984.83-1545,0,25049,gordon_dean_booth_jr,,813.834,814.305,"--Right, Your Honor."
1984.83-1545,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,838.821,842.204,Your objection there is to the form of the instruction which placed the burden of proof on you?
1984.83-1545,0,25049,gordon_dean_booth_jr,,842.204,842.913,"Exactly, Your Honor."
1984.83-1545,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,842.913,847.547,"You say that, even though it's an affirmative defense, you apply the McDonnell Douglas approach."
1984.83-1545,0,25049,gordon_dean_booth_jr,,848.588,849.718,"Well, I'll address that in a moment, Your Honor."
1984.83-1545,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,856.323,872.793,"On the instruction point concerning reasonable factor other than age, where in the instruction did the court tell the jury that it was an affirmative defense?"
1984.83-1545,0,25049,gordon_dean_booth_jr,,872.793,875.765,"Your Honor, I thought somebody might ask that."
1984.83-1545,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,884.199,886.122,Where is that?
1984.83-1545,0,25049,gordon_dean_booth_jr,,886.122,886.502,"--Sorry, Your Honor."
1984.83-1545,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,901.871,910.449,I just didn't find anyplace where the trial judge said the reasonable factor other than age was an affirmative defense and that the burden was on Western Airlines.
1984.83-1545,0,25049,gordon_dean_booth_jr,,914.841,917.683,"--You're quite right, Your Honor, it is nowhere in there stated as that."
1984.83-1545,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,922.096,926.157,So that argument may fail simply because that isn't what the judge instructed.
1984.83-1545,0,25049,gordon_dean_booth_jr,,926.157,929.69,It's conceivably possible that that's true.
1984.83-1545,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,929.69,942.499,Then you made this argument that the court had to apply that McDonnell Douglas approach on reasonable factors other than age.
1984.83-1545,0,25049,gordon_dean_booth_jr,,951.025,954.688,"No, Your Honor."
1984.83-1545,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,973.519,982.856,"Well, isn't that direct evidence of age discrimination, so that you have to face it head-on rather than in a McDonnell Douglas approach?"
1984.83-1545,0,25049,gordon_dean_booth_jr,,982.856,983.977,"I'm sorry, Your Honor."
1984.83-1545,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1004.62,1012.464,"Well, I guess all we had here were captains who had reached the age that precluded them from being captains."
1984.83-1545,0,25049,gordon_dean_booth_jr,,1012.464,1013.814,In this case?
1984.83-1545,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1013.814,1014.425,Yes.
1984.83-1545,0,25049,gordon_dean_booth_jr,,1014.425,1014.936,"No, Your Honor."
1984.83-1545,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1084.361,1086.262,"Mr. Booth, can I interrupt again."
1984.83-1545,0,25049,gordon_dean_booth_jr,,1122.267,1127.158,"Your Honor, as to this population of Plaintiffs I don't know, but I would assume that all of them are 60 by now."
1984.83-1545,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1127.158,1136.255,But I don't see how a captain could possibly have suffered injury by being forbidden to bid down if he was going to get fired when he was 60 anyway.
1984.83-1545,0,25049,gordon_dean_booth_jr,,1136.255,1137.387,"Well, I think, Your Honor--"
1984.83-1545,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1137.387,1138.737,Because he would presumably earn more money as a captain.
1984.83-1545,0,25049,gordon_dean_booth_jr,,1138.737,1143.411,--They earn... the flight engineer earns 60 percent of what a captain earns.
1984.83-1545,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1148.804,1149.275,Right.
1984.83-1545,0,25049,gordon_dean_booth_jr,,1149.275,1156.598,"--because if they had the right to bid down under the seniority provisions of the collective bargaining agreement, the company has to train them."
1984.83-1545,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1160.903,1164.155,But they would have been fired when they reached their sixtieth birthday anyway.
1984.83-1545,0,25049,gordon_dean_booth_jr,,1164.155,1168.526,"--Well, of course they were trying to position themselves to argue that that was--"
1984.83-1545,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1168.526,1168.977,That's right.
1984.83-1545,0,25049,gordon_dean_booth_jr,,1172.449,1173.639,"--Well, of course, Your Honor--"
1984.83-1545,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1173.639,1179.533,"I just don't understand how the reasonable factor other than age can possibly determine anybody's rights, that issue in this case."
1984.83-1545,0,25049,gordon_dean_booth_jr,,1181.045,1183.816,"--Well, maybe only two or three years' rights, Your Honor."
1984.83-1545,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1183.816,1184.437,Pardon me?
1984.83-1545,0,25049,gordon_dean_booth_jr,,1184.437,1188.149,"It may be only two or three years' rights, but the Plaintiffs--"
1984.83-1545,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1188.149,1190.131,But it would be two or three years at a lower salary.
1984.83-1545,0,25049,gordon_dean_booth_jr,,1190.131,1191.24,--Of course.
1984.83-1545,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1203.779,1206.41,But you don't want to try it on that issue if you're going to lose anyway on the BFOQ issue.
1984.83-1545,0,25049,gordon_dean_booth_jr,,1211.703,1216.098,"--Well, actually I viewed this as the introduction to the facts, Your Honor."
1984.83-1545,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1471.666,1474.258,"Mr. Booth, may I ask one other question."
1984.83-1545,0,25049,gordon_dean_booth_jr,,1480.782,1494.45,"Your Honor, there were numerous discussions between the court and the parties as to the different BFOQ's that were given... I mean, strike that... that were proposed for charges."
1984.83-1545,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1497.872,1502.955,"Well, my question is did you, after it was made or after you knew what it was going to be, make objections to it?"
1984.83-1545,0,25049,gordon_dean_booth_jr,,1502.955,1506.448,"--Your Honor, I think the objections were continually made."
1984.83-1545,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1508.721,1509.05,Can I find them in the record.
1984.83-1545,0,25049,gordon_dean_booth_jr,,1511.483,1514.015,"--Your Honor, I don't know."
1984.83-1545,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1514.015,1518.457,And did you propose a different instruction and is that in the record?
1984.83-1545,0,25049,gordon_dean_booth_jr,,1518.457,1522.039,Different instructions that were proposed were in the record.
1984.83-1545,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1523.569,1525.281,But somebody representing your client.
1984.83-1545,0,25049,gordon_dean_booth_jr,,1525.281,1526.022,"Yes, Your Honor."
1984.83-1545,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1526.022,1529.974,And where are the instructions that your client proposed on BFOQ?
1984.83-1545,0,25049,gordon_dean_booth_jr,,1529.974,1532.167,Where are they shown in the record?
1984.83-1545,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1532.167,1533.437,Yes.
1984.83-1545,0,25049,gordon_dean_booth_jr,,1533.437,1535.139,"Your Honor, I don't have the citations for the record."
1984.83-1545,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1543.644,1557.204,On page 79 of the joint appendix there are some responses to requests.
1984.83-1545,0,25049,gordon_dean_booth_jr,,1583.421,1584.132,"--In the full record, Your Honor."
1984.83-1545,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1590.995,1591.806,Were they recorded or not?
1984.83-1545,0,25049,gordon_dean_booth_jr,,1591.806,1593.649,"--Your Honor, a lot of that was not recorded."
1984.83-1545,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1606.385,1618.293,"Well, is the instruction to which you address your challenge embraced within the instruction that begins on page 51 of the appendix?"
1984.83-1545,0,25049,gordon_dean_booth_jr,,1618.293,1619.135,"Yes, Your Honor."
1984.83-1545,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1622.206,1645.582,"Well, Mr. Booth, to try to clarify your point, if I can, the trial judge instructed that, in 1978 when these Plaintiffs were retired, the jury had to find it was highly impractical for Western to deal with each second officer over 60 on an individualized basis to determine his ability."
1984.83-1545,0,25049,gordon_dean_booth_jr,,1655.069,1661.921,"Your Honor, I don't believe there was that instruction to the subsets of that instruction."
1984.83-1545,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1679.095,1691.991,And did the clarifying paragraphs make it clearer that it was enough for the jury to find that the employer simply had a reasonable basis in fact to think it was highly impractical?
1984.83-1545,0,25049,gordon_dean_booth_jr,,1691.991,1706.183,"Your Honor, the clarifying language approached the problem by saying that the jury could adjust the impracticality factor by considering the safety obligations and the safety responsibilities."
1984.83-1545,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1714.878,1717.23,But that's what you're urging today.
1984.83-1545,0,25049,gordon_dean_booth_jr,,1717.23,1718.509,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1984.83-1545,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1718.509,1727.024,You urge that the trial judge should have said the employer had a reasonable basis in fact to believe it was impractical.
1984.83-1545,0,25049,gordon_dean_booth_jr,,1727.024,1744.625,"Well, Your Honor, we also say that the trial judge should have charged the jury on Western's standard of care and allowed the jury to consider its safety obligations in light of the other requirements it had."
1984.83-1545,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1744.625,1752.222,"Well, that seems like a separate point, and of course the trial judge did instruct that safety was a factor."
1984.83-1545,0,25049,gordon_dean_booth_jr,,1752.222,1762.978,"Well, it's true, we are now proposing to the Court what we think would be a perfect charge and we are complaining about the charge below on the ground that it had several errors that we thought--"
1984.83-1545,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1762.978,1767.072,"Although you did not propose the ""perfect charge"" at the time?"
1984.83-1545,0,25049,gordon_dean_booth_jr,,1767.072,1773.526,"--No, Your Honor, but the charge we proposed was not given and the charge that was given was an inaccurate statement of the law."
1984.83-1545,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1773.526,1775.929,"Mr. Booth, did the Court of Appeals review that charge?"
1984.83-1545,0,25049,gordon_dean_booth_jr,,1775.929,1779.633,"Your Honor, it reviewed the charge, yes."
1984.83-1545,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1863.216,1872.693,Mr. Fay.
1984.83-1545,1,39257,raymond_c_fay,,1872.693,1876.325,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1984.83-1545,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1895.576,1896.798,Did you try the case?
1984.83-1545,1,39257,raymond_c_fay,,1896.798,1897.757,"Yes, I did."
1984.83-1545,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1897.757,1902.572,"Well, is what you're going to tell us in the record or is it just your memory?"
1984.83-1545,1,39257,raymond_c_fay,,1902.572,1904.643,I'm going to tell you everything that's in the record.
1984.83-1545,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1904.643,1906.783,You mean everything you say is going to be in the record?
1984.83-1545,1,39257,raymond_c_fay,,1906.783,1907.534,That's correct.
1984.83-1545,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1907.534,1908.125,All right.
1984.83-1545,1,39257,raymond_c_fay,,1910.737,1924.295,"First of all, with regard to the backseat driver defense, that was not raised in this case at all, either as a reasonable factor other than age or as a BFOQ."
1984.83-1545,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2048.847,2049.478,"Well, counsel--"
1984.83-1545,1,39257,raymond_c_fay,,2049.478,2050.039,--Yes.
1984.83-1545,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2050.039,2064.898,--what about that portion of the instruction dealing with the instruction that the jury had to find it was in fact highly impractical for individualized testing?
1984.83-1545,1,39257,raymond_c_fay,,2064.898,2077.197,"After the judge made his ruling that he was not going to abide by the Tuohy district court ruling, because he said that would take it away from the jury, Western tendered an instruction called 19 alternate."
1984.83-1545,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2140.126,2146.821,And in the first proposed instruction they had asked for the rational basis in fact language?
1984.83-1545,1,39257,raymond_c_fay,,2146.821,2147.322,--That's correct.
1984.83-1545,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2210.114,2217.307,"We will resume there at 1:00 o'clock, counsel."
1984.83-1545,1,39257,raymond_c_fay,,2236.141,2241.032,One more item of clarification regarding the state of the record.
1984.83-1545,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2354.499,2363.084,"What page of the instructions is that on, Mr. Fay?"
1984.83-1545,1,39257,raymond_c_fay,,2363.084,2364.226,In the joint appendix?
1984.83-1545,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2364.226,2364.625,Yes.
1984.83-1545,1,39257,raymond_c_fay,,2364.625,2373.362,"It's instruction number 28, on page 61 of the joint appendix, where it states:"
1984.83-1545,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2562.084,2563.116,Could I ask you--
1984.83-1545,1,39257,raymond_c_fay,,2563.116,2563.757,Yes.
1984.83-1545,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2563.757,2577.434,--did Western take the position in the trial court that the reason they're insisting on a BFOQ for the flight engineer was that it's the training ground for the captain's position?
1984.83-1545,1,39257,raymond_c_fay,,2577.434,2579.176,Not as such.
1984.83-1545,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2580.156,2605.763,"Because we haven't... I don't know that we have any cases that say that a carrier can't adopt a scheme for training pilots that means, we're going to take everybody in as a flight engineer, nobody can be a pilot who hasn't been a flight engineer, and the flight engineering job is a training ground for pilots."
1984.83-1545,1,39257,raymond_c_fay,,2605.763,2608.645,--That had nothing to do with the BFOQ argument that Western made.
1984.83-1545,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2608.645,2609.216,Why not?
1984.83-1545,1,39257,raymond_c_fay,,2609.216,2610.696,Why not?
1984.83-1545,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2610.696,2611.477,Yes.
1984.83-1545,1,39257,raymond_c_fay,,2611.477,2612.286,Because it simply didn't assert it.
1984.83-1545,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2613.508,2614.279,That's what I asked you.
1984.83-1545,1,39257,raymond_c_fay,,2614.279,2615.22,--It did not.
1984.83-1545,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2615.22,2616.52,It did not assert it?
1984.83-1545,1,39257,raymond_c_fay,,2616.52,2622.364,"It did make a pass at saying that it had a progression line, but that was in support of the restriction on down-bidding."
1984.83-1545,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2622.364,2630.138,"Well, would you say that it could have a progression line like that and say, therefore all flight engineers that we hire must meet the requirements of a pilot?"
1984.83-1545,1,39257,raymond_c_fay,,2630.138,2634.732,"Well, in fact that was the contractual requirement here."
1984.83-1545,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2637.665,2639.135,"Well, would you say that... no, no."
1984.83-1545,1,39257,raymond_c_fay,,2639.135,2640.326,But they had to have a pilot's certificate.
1984.83-1545,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2640.326,2644.748,"Well, and they also couldn't be over 60, just like a pilot couldn't be."
1984.83-1545,1,39257,raymond_c_fay,,2644.748,2648.871,"Well, that's just another... that's another way of saying that there's a flat-out ban on age."
1984.83-1545,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2654.355,2655.686,So your answer is that they can't have--
1984.83-1545,1,39257,raymond_c_fay,,2655.686,2656.545,They cannot.
1984.83-1545,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2656.545,2658.408,--a flat rule against a progression?
1984.83-1545,1,39257,raymond_c_fay,,2658.408,2664.572,"Well, here, Your Honor, in this record there was no flat rule."
1984.83-1545,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2664.572,2672.016,"Could they say, could they have a rule that, because the flight engineer is a training seat for pilots, we'll never hire a flight engineer over 60?"
1984.83-1545,1,39257,raymond_c_fay,,2672.016,2674.059,That argument--
1984.83-1545,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2674.059,2677.161,What about your position on that?
1984.83-1545,1,39257,raymond_c_fay,,2677.161,2678.17,--Could that argument be made?
1984.83-1545,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2678.17,2679.402,"Well, no."
1984.83-1545,1,39257,raymond_c_fay,,2679.402,2680.263,I'm sorry.
1984.83-1545,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2680.263,2681.614,Would it be sustainable?
1984.83-1545,1,39257,raymond_c_fay,,2681.614,2685.066,"I'm boxed in by this record, where there were so many exceptions to the progression."
1984.83-1545,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2685.066,2686.284,In the abstract?
1984.83-1545,1,39257,raymond_c_fay,,2686.284,2687.055,In the abstract?
1984.83-1545,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2687.055,2700.955,"Could TWA say, look, we're training pilots by making them flight engineers, so we refuse to hire anybody as a flight engineer who's over 60?"
1984.83-1545,1,39257,raymond_c_fay,,2700.955,2704.117,"Oh, age 60 hiring."
1984.83-1545,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2704.117,2706.861,Because of this progression.
1984.83-1545,1,39257,raymond_c_fay,,2706.861,2711.483,It would still have to be shown that it was related to safety.
1984.83-1545,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2714.335,2721.789,"Well, it's related to safety in the sense that this is where we get all our pilots, and therefore, if the pilot BFOQ is related to safety, so is this one."
1984.83-1545,1,39257,raymond_c_fay,,2721.789,2723.771,"Well, that would establish perhaps the first prong."
1984.83-1545,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2734.467,2741.372,But supposing they just don't want to hire someone at 60 when the position is a line promotion to something else that he can never fill.
1984.83-1545,1,39257,raymond_c_fay,,2742.221,2747.126,I'm scratching my head because I don't think it exists in this industry.
1984.83-1545,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2747.126,2749.748,"No, but I just want to know your answer to the question in the abstract."
1984.83-1545,1,39257,raymond_c_fay,,2749.748,2754.79,The question in the abstract is I don't think it would meet both prongs of the Tamiami test.
1984.83-1545,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2757.853,2760.995,"But Mr. Booth, it's not farfetched."
1984.83-1545,1,39257,raymond_c_fay,,2768.958,2771.97,That's true.
1984.83-1545,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2771.97,2773.262,"I mean, it was an absolute rule."
1984.83-1545,1,39257,raymond_c_fay,,2773.262,2774.454,"That's true, Your Honor."
1984.83-1545,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2774.454,2782.779,"So I mean, it's not too farfetched, from saying that you have to be an engineer... I mean, that you have to be a flight engineer before you can be a pilot."
1984.83-1545,1,39257,raymond_c_fay,,2782.779,2786.561,The normal progression rule is the one that Western asserted in this case.
1984.83-1545,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2810.676,2813.128,"Well, they also had up-or-out, too."
1984.83-1545,1,39257,raymond_c_fay,,2813.128,2821.975,"--Well, the up-or-out was a very limited one here, and once you made captain, as Criswell and Starley did, they were allowed to go backwards as many times as they wanted."
1984.83-1545,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2821.975,2830.01,"Even if you concede what Justice White and Justice Rehnquist were asking you, how does that affect your case?"
1984.83-1545,1,39257,raymond_c_fay,,2830.01,2831.31,"I don't believe it affects the case at all, Your Honor."
1984.83-1545,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2831.31,2843.549,"Well, it might affect whether an overage pilot can go take a seat as a flight engineer that would keep it away from some younger man who would be training for a pilot."
1984.83-1545,1,39257,raymond_c_fay,,2843.549,2846.24,Which is not this case.
1984.83-1545,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2848.93,2857.456,"Does the record tell us what happens to a flight engineer who has a medical certificate good enough to be a flight engineer, but is not physically qualified to be a pilot?"
1984.83-1545,1,39257,raymond_c_fay,,2858.377,2859.068,He does not.
1984.83-1545,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2872.757,2875.599,"Of course, he couldn't be training, obviously, for the pilot job."
1984.83-1545,1,39257,raymond_c_fay,,2875.599,2878.681,He was not qualified to fly as a captain any more because of the medical requirements.
1984.83-1545,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2999.811,3011.367,--Mr. Wallace.
1984.83-1545,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3011.367,3016.001,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1984.83-1545,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3095.734,3108.252,"So is it your position, Mr. Wallace, then that there is direct evidence of discrimination on the basis of age, and therefore the RFOA defense doesn't apply?"
1984.83-1545,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3108.252,3110.644,"--That is correct, just as there was in the TWA case."
1984.83-1545,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3248.323,3258.868,"Mr. Wallace, if you're running an airline and you simply leave that question up to the jury in every case, it doesn't help much in making decisions as to what you can do."
1984.83-1545,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3258.868,3268.224,"Well, the Congress did choose to bring juries into the enforcement of the Age Discrimination Act."
1984.83-1545,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3268.224,3271.388,"Or if you leave it up to a judge in every case, it doesn't help much."
1984.83-1545,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3271.388,3286.988,"It is a factual inquiry, and obviously if someone is going to decide that he comes within an extremely narrow exception to the Act, he better do so with assurance that he has evidence that will stand up in court."
1984.83-1545,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3286.988,3320.641,"Well, on the second prong of that Tamiami test requirement for a BFOQ, what is an airline supposed to do if two medical reports come to it, one that says the tests to screen out unqualified people over 50 are valid and will properly identify the people who should be eliminated, and the other medical report says, no, those tests won't tell you who's safe and who isn't safe?"
1984.83-1545,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3338.761,3346.968,"I recognize that, and safety considerations are definitely relevant."
1984.83-1545,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3363.539,3380.368,"Well, would it be appropriate to at least instruct the jury that, if the employer has a rational basis in fact to think the tests won't screen out individually the people who are at risk, that the employer is not liable under ADEA?"
1984.83-1545,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3380.368,3384.191,"--We do not think that is the statutory standard, Justice O'Connor."
1984.83-1545,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3613.561,3615.503,"Well, is the union a party to this case?"
1984.83-1545,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3615.503,3618.837,The union was not a party in this case and no one from the union testified.
1984.83-1545,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3654.82,3655.782,"Thank you, gentlemen."
