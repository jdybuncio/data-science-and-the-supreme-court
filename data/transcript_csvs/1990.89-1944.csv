1990.89-1944,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.856,"We'll hear argument next in No. 89-1944, Ohio v. Ediberto Huertas."
1990.89-1944,0,32567,jonathan_e_rosenbaum,,82.552,101.116,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.89-1944,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,125.847,126.814,May I just interrupt you?
1990.89-1944,0,32567,jonathan_e_rosenbaum,,138.605,156.183,"--The syllabus in this case is taken directly from the text of the opinion from Section 1(e), and it says expressions of opinion by a witness as to the appropriateness of a particular sentence in a capital case violate the defendant's constitutional right to have the sentencing decision made by the jury and judge."
1990.89-1944,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,169.51,173.045,"But do those cases, do Booth or Gathers deal with the issue discussed in the syllabus?"
1990.89-1944,0,32567,jonathan_e_rosenbaum,,173.045,173.612,--Absolutely.
1990.89-1944,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,199.295,201.481,Let me just be sure... are you now reading from the syllabus or the opinion?
1990.89-1944,0,32567,jonathan_e_rosenbaum,,201.481,206.033,I am reading from the very next line that came from the opinion... the syllabus.
1990.89-1944,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,209.301,212.437,"Yes, but the references to the cases that you just made is not in the syllabus, is it?"
1990.89-1944,0,32567,jonathan_e_rosenbaum,,212.437,212.805,--That's correct.
1990.89-1944,0,32567,jonathan_e_rosenbaum,,215.491,216.257,Next line of the opinion?
1990.89-1944,0,32567,jonathan_e_rosenbaum,,216.257,217.741,"--The very next line of the opinion, that is correct."
1990.89-1944,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,242.558,256.298,"Counsel, on this point, as I recall the opinion of the Ohio Supreme Court, it cited no State authority in support of its holding on this... that you have just quoted from the syllabus."
1990.89-1944,0,32567,jonathan_e_rosenbaum,,256.298,259.584,"Mr. Justice Kennedy, it cited no other authority other than Booth and Gathers."
1990.89-1944,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,264.222,273.927,"Well, Mr. Rosenbaum, did either Booth or Gathers involve testimony of the witness as to what the penalty should be in the case?"
1990.89-1944,0,32567,jonathan_e_rosenbaum,,273.927,277.379,The... Booth had... did not involve testimony--
1990.89-1944,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,277.379,281.849,"I thought it was quite different, a different kind of evidence in those cases."
1990.89-1944,0,32567,jonathan_e_rosenbaum,,281.849,305.632,"--In the Bronsteins' statement in the victim impact statement that was this Court's basis, or was construed to be inappropriate by this Court, they make reference to, although they did not express the desire to impose the ultimate penalty, they said that the person was not subject to rehabilitation, that justice should be swift, and they clearly implied what their thinking was, although they did not come out and say that."
1990.89-1944,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,305.632,316.189,"It seemed to me that the Ohio syllabus here was focusing on a somewhat different point, to whit, the recommendation of the penalty and nothing more."
1990.89-1944,0,32567,jonathan_e_rosenbaum,,316.189,327.914,"I think the syllabus clearly points out that what is important here is the constitutional right, and I think the constitutional rights involved, and whether there is a prohibition based upon those rights."
1990.89-1944,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,344.674,369.341,"Counsel, can you tell me... can you make an inference as to why in preparing the syllabus, whoever prepares it, the court focused on just the opinion as to the ultimate issue, as opposed to the other kinds of Booth-Gathers evidence that really was introduced into this trial?"
1990.89-1944,0,32567,jonathan_e_rosenbaum,,369.857,370.757,--I cannot make--
1990.89-1944,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,370.757,373.293,--Can we speculate on why that might be?
1990.89-1944,0,32567,jonathan_e_rosenbaum,,373.293,392.856,"--I am reluctant to speculate, but I can respond to your question by saying in Chief Justice Moyer's concurring opinion he made it very clear that this ruling came from their concerns about Booth and Gathers, and that they asked... that he felt this was a very confusing case, and he asked for this Court to review it and revisit it."
1990.89-1944,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,406.014,417.222,As a matter of State law in Ohio is opinion evidence on the penalty in a criminal case admissible as a matter of Ohio law?
1990.89-1944,0,32567,jonathan_e_rosenbaum,,417.222,423.209,"--I... this is a point that has been raised by the respondent, and they cite the case of State v. White."
1990.89-1944,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,426.078,428.112,"Well, you can just answer the question."
1990.89-1944,0,32567,jonathan_e_rosenbaum,,428.112,430.162,"I will, thank you."
1990.89-1944,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,444.805,456.947,"In determining whether a defendant is guilty or innocent in a criminal case in Ohio, lay witness opinion as to the penalty is considered relevant?"
1990.89-1944,0,32567,jonathan_e_rosenbaum,,456.947,458.113,Is not considered relevant.
1990.89-1944,0,32567,jonathan_e_rosenbaum,,458.113,459.18,Not considered relevant.
1990.89-1944,0,32567,jonathan_e_rosenbaum,,459.18,462.332,"It is not considered relevant, and that... in the guilt phase."
1990.89-1944,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,473.723,482.162,Are there Ohio cases holding that lay witness opinion evidence is relevant in the penalty phase of a capital case?
1990.89-1944,0,32567,jonathan_e_rosenbaum,,482.162,482.662,--No.
1990.89-1944,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,482.662,483.597,Thank you.
1990.89-1944,0,32567,jonathan_e_rosenbaum,,483.597,484.547,There are not.
1990.89-1944,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,484.547,497.922,"Mr. Rosenbaum, when the Supreme Court of Ohio decided this case and said that the testimony of the lay witness was not admissible, did it rely on any Ohio cases to say that or did it rely on the United States Constitution?"
1990.89-1944,0,32567,jonathan_e_rosenbaum,,497.922,503.826,It relied solely upon this Court's interpretations of the Eighth Amendment based on Booth and Gathers.
1990.89-1944,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,534.195,548.003,I think one can read the discussion on page 21 of the cert. petition as indicating they thought that Booth and Gathers were so far different that even the dissenting justices' opinions in Booth and Gathers would not have applied to this case.
1990.89-1944,0,32567,jonathan_e_rosenbaum,,550.838,553.107,--You read the majority of the Ohio opinion as saying that?
1990.89-1944,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,553.107,554.425,"Yes, at page 21."
1990.89-1944,0,32567,jonathan_e_rosenbaum,,554.425,560.246,I... I think that this Court has wrongfully applied Booth and Gathers on page 21.
1990.89-1944,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,565.198,569.184,"But, as I say, they're talking about the position of the dissenters in Booth and Gathers in there."
1990.89-1944,0,32567,jonathan_e_rosenbaum,,569.184,570.151,Correct.
1990.89-1944,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,570.151,577.022,"But we could perfectly well affirm without doing anything one way or the other to Booth and Gathers, couldn't we?"
1990.89-1944,0,32567,jonathan_e_rosenbaum,,577.022,579.124,You could affirm the Ohio Supreme Court decision?
1990.89-1944,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,579.124,579.54,Yes.
1990.89-1944,0,32567,jonathan_e_rosenbaum,,579.54,579.957,Absolutely.
1990.89-1944,1,32795,joann_bour_stokes,,1661.457,1667.36,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.89-1944,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1704.302,1706.504,That's a very strange rule.
1990.89-1944,1,32795,joann_bour_stokes,,1709.17,1710.122,"I don't think so, Your Honor."
1990.89-1944,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1714.324,1720.745,"As Justice Stevens said, Justice Stewart used to lecture us about Ohio syllabi."
1990.89-1944,1,32795,joann_bour_stokes,,1720.745,1723.097,And it's very important in this case.
1990.89-1944,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1725.466,1731.303,"Well, you have to... you have to... the word ""constitutional"" is in the syllabus, isn't it?"
1990.89-1944,1,32795,joann_bour_stokes,,1731.303,1745.129,"--Yes, Your Honor, and I would like to respond to the fact that the constitutional right referred to in the syllabus cannot be a Federal constitutional right, first because it talks about the constitutional right to a jury and judge decision."
1990.89-1944,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1756.853,1759.52,You're saying the syllabus couldn't be wrong?
1990.89-1944,1,32795,joann_bour_stokes,,1759.52,1761.072,"I'm... no, no, I don't believe a syllabus is wrong."
1990.89-1944,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1762.339,1763.007,"Well, but it could be wrong."
1990.89-1944,1,32795,joann_bour_stokes,,1776.665,1782.653,"--I think what the Ohio Supreme Court decided in this case is entirely correct, that the opinion testimony was improper in this case."
1990.89-1944,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1782.653,1794.376,"Well, if you're looking around for some evidence of what they meant by constitutional right, I suppose it's not against the Ohio rules to look at their opinion, is it?"
1990.89-1944,1,32795,joann_bour_stokes,,1794.376,1795.728,"No... it's not, Your Honor."
1990.89-1944,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1796.862,1797.445,"Well, look at it."
1990.89-1944,1,32795,joann_bour_stokes,,1804.251,1805.501,"--That is correct, Your Honor."
1990.89-1944,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1805.501,1809.386,The only constitutional law they discuss is Federal.
1990.89-1944,1,32795,joann_bour_stokes,,1809.386,1810.922,"And what the court did was, in--"
1990.89-1944,2,32567,jonathan_e_rosenbaum,,2781.162,2781.412,Thank you.
1990.89-1944,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2821.137,2830.826,"Of course, Mr. Rosenbaum, there is... isn't there also a one-sidedness in the whole business of you're limited to statutory aggravating circumstances on the one side, but on the other side they can use nonstatutory mitigating circumstances?"
1990.89-1944,2,32567,jonathan_e_rosenbaum,,2831.928,2833.095,That is one-sided.
1990.89-1944,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2833.095,2834.797,"And it's probably unconstitutional, too, under your argument."
1990.89-1944,2,32567,jonathan_e_rosenbaum,,2834.797,2837.249,"No, I don't... I would not go that far."
1990.89-1944,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2837.249,2837.732,Why not?
1990.89-1944,2,32567,jonathan_e_rosenbaum,,2837.732,2845.652,"Because the State has recognized, or you... this Court has recognized that the State has a legitimate right to rebut that, and that's what the State did here."
1990.89-1944,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2854.389,2859.143,"Of course it's kind of one-sided that they have to prove their case by a... beyond a reasonable doubt, too."
1990.89-1944,2,32567,jonathan_e_rosenbaum,,2859.143,2861.162,"Well, the State of Ohio welcomes that burden."
1990.89-1944,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2861.162,2861.712,Yeah.
1990.89-1944,2,32567,jonathan_e_rosenbaum,,2861.712,2864.28,"And that is fair, and that is a proper part of--"
1990.89-1944,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2864.28,2866.047,"Some one-sided things are okay, and others are not."
1990.89-1944,2,32567,jonathan_e_rosenbaum,,2866.047,2870.933,--But in this burden the State should... in meeting its burden the State should not be severely handicapped.
1990.89-1944,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2880.523,2882.241,"Thank you, Mr. Rosenbaum."
