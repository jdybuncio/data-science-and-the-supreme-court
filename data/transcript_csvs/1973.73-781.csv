1973.73-781,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,35.185,"We’ll hear arguments next in 73-781, Scherk against Alberto-Culver Company."
1973.73-781,0,39510,robert_f_hanley,,38.019,41.464,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1973.73-781,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,381.646,382.318,Mr. Robert F. Hanley --
1973.73-781,0,39510,robert_f_hanley,,382.318,382.978,"Yes, Your Honor."
1973.73-781,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,382.978,392.283,-- to what extent are you pursuing the suggestion of the Federal District Court in Illinois did not have jurisdiction of this?
1973.73-781,0,39510,robert_f_hanley,,392.283,418.088,"Your Honor, we believe that the Federal District Court has now ruled and in the face of our motion to dismiss on jurisdictional grounds we believe and the Court of Appeals has -- if you are asking me as far as the preliminary injunction is concerned, the Court of Appeals has ruled that it had jurisdiction under 1292 (a) (1)."
1973.73-781,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,678.348,692.62,"It’s your admission I guess that that language means that if an action under the Exchange Act 34 comes to a Court it’s the Federal District Courts that have exclusive jurisdiction, exclusive of the state courts, is that your point?"
1973.73-781,0,39510,robert_f_hanley,,692.62,693.918,"That’s correct, Your Honor."
1973.73-781,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,693.918,696.615,"That language is not on the 33 Act, is it?"
1973.73-781,0,39510,robert_f_hanley,,696.615,697.616,"No, Your Honor."
1973.73-781,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,697.616,701.675,And it was the 33 Act which is Wilko against Swan?
1973.73-781,0,39510,robert_f_hanley,,701.675,705.597,That’s correct.
1973.73-781,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,705.597,706.37,Mr. Hanley?
1973.73-781,0,39510,robert_f_hanley,,706.37,707.112,"Yes, Your Honor."
1973.73-781,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,707.112,713.226,"Before you proceed, let me come back to something you said a little earlier."
1973.73-781,0,39510,robert_f_hanley,,722.771,736.995,"Technically, Your Honor, I believe we would have to concede under the cases that for the purpose, at least to this argument, we concede that there are promissory notes involved."
1973.73-781,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,736.995,741.979,"This was a purchase of assets and nothing more, wasn’t it?"
1973.73-781,0,39510,robert_f_hanley,,741.979,742.356,"No, well."
1973.73-781,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,742.356,746.921,In substance?
1973.73-781,0,39510,robert_f_hanley,,746.921,748.72,There was a purchase of assets.
1973.73-781,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,752.603,761.88,Right and the purchase embraced a 100% of the ownership of your client?
1973.73-781,0,39510,robert_f_hanley,,761.88,765.195,There were some -- Your Honor that’s 90% accurate.
1973.73-781,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,779.827,788.479,The purchaser acquired stock in the German company that was organized as a part of the transaction as I understood it?
1973.73-781,0,39510,robert_f_hanley,,788.479,793.14,He acquired stock in a company or business --
1973.73-781,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,793.14,794.677,It was Liechtenstein.
1973.73-781,0,39510,robert_f_hanley,,794.677,803.424,"It was Liechtenstein Anstalt, Your Honor, and at the time of the transaction, at the time of the re-entering into it, it was not a stock company."
1973.73-781,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,805.343,806.281,It was converted as part of this --
1973.73-781,0,39510,robert_f_hanley,,806.281,816.296,It was converted as part of the transaction and stock was issued and was delivered and at the time of the closing it was held in escrow.
1973.73-781,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,861.179,871.661,"Well, neither the Act of 33 nor 34 was addressed to negotiate it mergers and acquisitions of assets."
1973.73-781,0,39510,robert_f_hanley,,877.551,890.894,Your Honor I have read the cases and have seen the extension of this definition of securities to include and I do not like to state and argue by myself but I --
1973.73-781,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,890.894,891.883,Have we said so?
1973.73-781,0,39510,robert_f_hanley,,894.614,896.494,"No, Your Honor."
1973.73-781,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,934.017,940.089,Didn’t lose it in entirely with Judge Stevens as I read his opinion?
1973.73-781,0,39510,robert_f_hanley,,940.089,940.255,Well --
1973.73-781,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,940.255,940.87,Go ahead.
1973.73-781,0,39510,robert_f_hanley,,950.939,951.737,"Alright, Your Honor."
1973.73-781,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,951.737,982.248,"Do I correctly understand the main thrust of your argument is that given the long standing judicial and legislative policy to encourage arbitration, that that should be followed absent compelling reasons of public policy not to do so and that there are no compelling reasons of public policy presented here as there were in Wilko?"
1973.73-781,0,39510,robert_f_hanley,,982.248,983.56,"That’s right, Your Honor."
1973.73-781,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1134.813,1135.648,Mr. Hanley?
1973.73-781,0,39510,robert_f_hanley,,1135.648,1136.353,"Yes, Your Honor."
1973.73-781,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1136.353,1138.455,Let me see if I follow you on this.
1973.73-781,0,39510,robert_f_hanley,,1166.254,1176.017,"We believe, Your Honor, that the arbitral court should resolve all of the questions, all of the factual questions here."
1973.73-781,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1228.836,1247.911,"But you see you have a federal statue and it would be amazing I think that anybody who has worked in the field to assume that if I bought out a company, lock, stock and barrel with a stock and the ventures and everything else that wasn’t a security?"
1973.73-781,0,39510,robert_f_hanley,,1247.911,1251.465,"Your Honor, I can see areas that --"
1973.73-781,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1251.465,1263.855,Read the definition in Section 3810 of the Exchange Act 34. It would be driving at a hole in the Act that big enough to send the caravan through?
1973.73-781,0,39510,robert_f_hanley,,1263.855,1276.502,"Your Honor, we can certainly hypothecate factual situations in which it would be unreasonable to not to apply Wilko versus Swan in this particular case."
1973.73-781,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1285.913,1293.591,"In this field you don’t talk about equity, you talk about the law, whether or not you have a security or you don’t have a security?"
1973.73-781,0,39510,robert_f_hanley,,1293.591,1305.992,"Well, what we’ve tried to show Your Honor is that under Section 27, the courts have not been requiring that all securities disputes be resolved in the District Courts."
1973.73-781,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1305.992,1310.129,"Well, you haven’t cited anything in the brief."
1973.73-781,0,39510,robert_f_hanley,,1314.111,1334.992,"Well, we hope we’ve shown Your Honor that it would be -- that because of the policies that were established by this Court or articulated in this Court in Zapata that it would be unfair and it would be unnecessary to extend Zapata into this international situation."
1973.73-781,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1337.241,1343.45,"Zapata was a common law case, was it not, at -- an admiralty claim?"
1973.73-781,0,39510,robert_f_hanley,,1343.45,1356.783,"And we believe that as in Zapata, Your Honor that the issues in this case are ripe for determination by the arbitral court."
1973.73-781,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1429.649,1440.526,"But that convention preserves consistently the issue of whether the arbitration award is against public policy in this country or any country, does it not?"
1973.73-781,0,39510,robert_f_hanley,,1440.526,1441.39,Yes.
1973.73-781,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1441.39,1461.8,"So, I get back to my question do you -- whether, if you prevail on the primary availability of arbitration here under the agreement, you still aren’t subject possibly to an American Court's passing on the public policy issue?"
1973.73-781,0,39510,robert_f_hanley,,1461.8,1466.155,"If there are facts I would certainly agree, Mr. Justice Blackmun."
1973.73-781,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1482.39,1491.932,That may will be and -- but certainly the arbitrator is not the one to pass on that?
1973.73-781,0,39510,robert_f_hanley,,1491.932,1492.531,I would concede it.
1973.73-781,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1492.531,1494.442,"I guess, that’s what I am asking."
1973.73-781,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1494.442,1501.044,"Mr. Hanley is your problem this Wilko was arm’s length bargaining, was there?"
1973.73-781,0,39510,robert_f_hanley,,1507.832,1508.926,I think not.
1973.73-781,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1554.022,1563.304,"As you see this definition of security doesn’t -- in 34, it doesn’t turn upon how strong one party is and how weak the other party is."
1973.73-781,0,39510,robert_f_hanley,,1567.82,1568.779,"Well, I understood --"
1973.73-781,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1568.779,1583.78,"A very unusual situation to acquire all this lock -- company lock, stock, and barrel securities and to match up saying that’s not a security, that is much more than a person who is working a deal who can swallow at least more quickly?"
1973.73-781,0,39510,robert_f_hanley,,1583.78,1604.09,"Well, it may -- it may be a security Your Honor and in this particular situation assuming as a security we are saying that it is not necessary for this Court to effectuate the rule, to apply the rule, to extend the rule in Wilko versus Swan and to prevent arbitration here."
1973.73-781,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1604.683,1612.269,"Very well, Mr. Hanley."
1973.73-781,1,24905,gerald_aksen,,1613.523,1617.8,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1973.73-781,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1782.126,1783.828,Mr. Aksen let me be straight.
1973.73-781,1,24905,gerald_aksen,,1789.143,1803.169,"The UN convention, Your Honor, provides in a section on enforcement of awards that the host country may of course refuse to honor the arbitration award if it would offend its public policy."
1973.73-781,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1814.198,1817.348,"Well, that doesn’t invalidate the validity of my inquiry to --"
1973.73-781,1,24905,gerald_aksen,,1817.348,1818.824,"Well, Your Honor it does not."
1973.73-781,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1830.955,1835.709,Well is that presented in this case at this stage?
1973.73-781,1,24905,gerald_aksen,,1835.709,1837.594,Amicus has not so argued in this case.
1973.73-781,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1846.058,1860.232,"The jurisdiction of a United States Court to deal with what Mr. Justice Blackmun has raised to you, that is the award when as and if one was made, is a question not now before the Court?"
1973.73-781,1,24905,gerald_aksen,,1860.232,1860.961,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1973.73-781,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1862.886,1874.222,"Mr. Aksen, is there some workable line that could be drawn assuming that the Court wish to follow your suggestion between the Wilko versus Swan type of case and this type of case?"
1973.73-781,1,24905,gerald_aksen,,1883.888,1895.212,The only workable line to accommodate the Federal Arbitration Act and the old Wilko v. Swan argument is to take a very hard look at recent times.
1973.73-781,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1929.207,1936.233,There are a lot of financial refugees around the world who do not dare to return to their own country.
1973.73-781,1,24905,gerald_aksen,,1941.602,1948.834,I think Mr. Justice Douglas that all of the businessmen in the world would welcome the free use of arbitration.
1973.73-781,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1948.834,1952.106,I am talking about the refugees.
1973.73-781,1,24905,gerald_aksen,,1952.106,1955.007,"If they are businessmen, Your Honor, I think they would welcome arbitration."
1973.73-781,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1955.007,1962.186,I am sure they would to avoid the rigors of their regime at home.
1973.73-781,1,24905,gerald_aksen,,1962.186,1966.437,"I am perhaps missing something, but I am not sure if a political type --"
1973.73-781,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1966.437,1966.89,It's not political I am talking about.
1973.73-781,1,24905,gerald_aksen,,1966.89,1971.654,-- problem with refugees is relevant to the definition of commerce as defined by the convention.
1973.73-781,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1971.654,1982.377,"I'm thinking in terms of the problems of security, regulation of securities in Switzerland, here, England and elsewhere."
1973.73-781,1,24905,gerald_aksen,,1982.377,1998.035,"Well, I think it is clear if this Court finds that the securities matters in this case which we consider peripheral, but if the Court finds that these securities matters are controlling, then it has a very difficult time accommodating these two statutes."
1973.73-781,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2022.251,2037.09,"What do you think the end result would be under the amendments to the act under the convention if the Securities Act said itself expressly, that arbitration clauses will not be permitted?"
1973.73-781,1,24905,gerald_aksen,,2037.09,2042.334,Then there would be no doubt in of my mind and the Wilko attitude should prevail but this is --
1973.73-781,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2042.334,2048.601,And that the convention would concededly accept that sort of provision.
1973.73-781,1,24905,gerald_aksen,,2048.601,2048.781,Yes.
1973.73-781,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2048.781,2051.337,Doesn’t that what Wilko really said?
1973.73-781,1,24905,gerald_aksen,,2051.337,2051.648,We think not.
1973.73-781,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2051.648,2055.496,"Just as though, that kind of a provision was written into the Act?"
1973.73-781,1,24905,gerald_aksen,,2055.496,2067.643,"No, because I think when you talk of public policy, Wilko would have had to have said that you cannot only, not agree to arbitrate future disputes, but you could not agree to arbitrate an existing dispute."
1973.73-781,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2077.17,2082.81,"Well, Mr. -- what have Mr. Justice Jackson’s concurring language, simple sentence?"
1973.73-781,1,24905,gerald_aksen,,2096.556,2101.532,"That is correct, but I don’t think that is sufficient public policy of the kind required."
1973.73-781,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2101.532,2110.978,"But that was, at least Mr. Justice Jackson read Mr. Justice Reid’s opinion as a construction of the Securities Act to prohibit as Mr. Justice White suggested."
1973.73-781,1,24905,gerald_aksen,,2110.978,2118.881,"It clearly did, Your Honor in a domestic transaction between two Americans who were fully aware of the local statutory provisions."
1973.73-781,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2118.881,2141.384,Did we not have something to say in the Zapata case of the impact on international trade and commerce if arm’s length transactions by American companies and foreign companies could not freely commit themselves to arbitration.
1973.73-781,1,24905,gerald_aksen,,2142.894,2147.072,You certainly did Mr. Justice Burger and we hardly endorse the language from the Zapata public opinion.
1973.73-781,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2182.442,2184.433,Thank you Mr. Gerald Aksen.
1973.73-781,2,24072,francis_j_higgins,,2186.663,2190.011,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1973.73-781,2,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2283.279,2284.778,29 (a) of the 34 Act?
1973.73-781,2,24072,francis_j_higgins,,2284.778,2292.821,Of the 34 Act is identical to 14 of the 33 Act.
1973.73-781,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2345.66,2354.037,"Well, not just because he is a foreigner but because he made an agreement and he is also a foreigner, isn’t that --"
1973.73-781,2,24072,francis_j_higgins,,2354.037,2358.646,"He made an agreement, but the plaintiff in the case is a person."
1973.73-781,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2378.105,2379.149,"Well, I could understand that."
1973.73-781,2,24072,francis_j_higgins,,2393.764,2402.083,I would like to address myself to that because I think this is the heart of Chief Judge Friendly's position in Leasco.
1973.73-781,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2434.855,2437.818,"Yes, but that case didn’t involve this question of arbitration?"
1973.73-781,2,24072,francis_j_higgins,,2437.818,2438.514,No.
1973.73-781,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2438.514,2439.996,And that’s the only question here.
1973.73-781,2,24072,francis_j_higgins,,2462.083,2462.698,Correct.
1973.73-781,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2605.705,2606.411,Mr. Higgins?
1973.73-781,2,24072,francis_j_higgins,,2606.411,2607.326,"Yes, Mr. Justice Rehnquist."
1973.73-781,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2607.326,2616.496,When your client engages in considerable negotiation over where there shall be arbitrator that’s really a throw away from his point of view.
1973.73-781,2,24072,francis_j_higgins,,2625.594,2637.99,"Well, I think when you talk about renege, I don’t think that parties, when they are entering into negotiations of this type assume or necessarily foresee that there is going to be securities fraud committed Justice Rehnquist."
1973.73-781,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2662.76,2671.777,"Except Wilko, I understand was a kind of a contract of adhesion where there wasn’t a very substantial bargaining process?"
1973.73-781,2,24072,francis_j_higgins,,2671.777,2675.816,But I was attempting to point out Justice Rehnquist that that’s not what the case involved.
1973.73-781,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2694.956,2703.778,"Under your view of the law, would the arbitration provision and the agreement that your client signed be applicable to some disputes that arose under the Act?"
1973.73-781,2,24072,francis_j_higgins,,2703.778,2714.183,"I would assume that if there was a straight non-securities violation of breach of contract it would be applicable, yes."
1973.73-781,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2765.725,2777.448,Is it -- what your position precludes agreements of the parties and with respect to the applicable law as to how the contract is to be interpreted and enforced?
1973.73-781,2,24072,francis_j_higgins,,2777.448,2778.07,No.
1973.73-781,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2779.966,2788.245,Because the parties here could have stipulated that the law of West Germany or the French law or something.
1973.73-781,2,24072,francis_j_higgins,,2788.245,2790.178,In fact they did stipulate on Illinois law.
1973.73-781,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2790.178,2791.4,"Yes, yes, indeed."
1973.73-781,2,24072,francis_j_higgins,,2791.4,2793.136,And this is another factor here which --
1973.73-781,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2793.136,2794.831,I wondered why if you would --
1973.73-781,2,24072,francis_j_higgins,,2794.831,2795.389,Yes.
1973.73-781,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2795.389,2796.893,-- if that it isn't the fact of your argument.
1973.73-781,2,24072,francis_j_higgins,,2796.893,2799.027,It hasn’t been so far but --
1973.73-781,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2799.027,2812.697,"But you would suppose that businessmen then and their lawyers could if Wilko is followed in this case, nevertheless structured their agreements to obtain the benefits of arbitration?"
1973.73-781,2,24072,francis_j_higgins,,2812.697,2814.207,"Yes, no question."
1973.73-781,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2819.727,2823.54,They've stipulate to take back without the --
1973.73-781,2,24072,francis_j_higgins,,2823.54,2830.514,"No, no if the stipulation in advance to waive the provisions of the Exchange Act is void in advance."
1973.73-781,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2831.823,2842.616,"Well, so they can’t stipulate out of the determination of process act you think so federal act."
1973.73-781,2,24072,francis_j_higgins,,2842.616,2843.812,Correct.
1973.73-781,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2844.965,2854.88,They stipulated what the Government law apply for this case that what kind of law would you expect security has.
1973.73-781,2,24072,francis_j_higgins,,2854.88,2856.71,"That’s correct, Your Honor."
1973.73-781,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2856.71,2862.564,[Voice Overlap]
1973.73-781,2,24072,francis_j_higgins,,2862.564,2865.344,Yes and the defendant is subject to the jurisdiction of the Court.
1973.73-781,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2923.221,2926.145,You accepted -- it says the laws of the State of Illinois.
1973.73-781,2,24072,francis_j_higgins,,2926.145,2945.057,"Right, Justice Stewart but the AAA in its amicus brief pointed out accurately, we believe, that when party selects state law they also select federal law to the extent that that is under the supremacy clause, part of the law of the state, but this is simply another quite aside from that legal argument."
1973.73-781,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2954.509,2965.862,"Mr. Higgins before you go on, why do you and your client insists that SEV be converted into a Lichtenstein Stock Corporation?"
1973.73-781,2,24072,francis_j_higgins,,2965.862,2970.552,The record indicates that there were certain tax considerations which Alberto-Culver deserved.
1973.73-781,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2970.552,2972.47,The benefit of your client?
1973.73-781,2,24072,francis_j_higgins,,2972.47,2975.737,"Well, it was for the benefit of having a deal made."
1973.73-781,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2984.808,2988.321,That was the condition to the obligation to purchase the business?
1973.73-781,2,24072,francis_j_higgins,,2988.321,2991.824,Yes.
1973.73-781,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3215.93,3216.699,Thank you gentlemen.
