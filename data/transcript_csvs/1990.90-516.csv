1990.90-516,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.987,"We'll hear argument next in No. 90-516, Jill S. Kamen v. Kemper Financial Services."
1990.90-516,0,39933,richard_m_meyer,,31.152,34.724,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.90-516,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,87.889,89.359,"Mr. Meyer, can I just ask one question?"
1990.90-516,0,39933,richard_m_meyer,,92.492,99.427,"--We are seeking damages, and--"
1990.90-516,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,99.427,100.757,And who is the we?
1990.90-516,0,39933,richard_m_meyer,,102.699,105.851,--We ask that the damages be paid to the fund.
1990.90-516,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,105.851,106.789,To--
1990.90-516,0,39933,richard_m_meyer,,106.789,110.403,"To Cash Equivalent Fund, which is the mutual fund involved."
1990.90-516,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,110.403,110.853,--I see.
1990.90-516,0,39933,richard_m_meyer,,113.395,119.489,This is a matter which the Solicitor General takes--
1990.90-516,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,119.489,119.929,Right.
1990.90-516,0,39933,richard_m_meyer,,119.929,121.059,--a somewhat different view of.
1990.90-516,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,144.276,145.004,The Seventh Circuit.
1990.90-516,0,39933,richard_m_meyer,,145.004,145.946,--Seventh Circuit.
1990.90-516,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,194.809,202.704,Can you answer that question without explaining first what law applies?
1990.90-516,0,39933,richard_m_meyer,,202.704,204.003,--I agree--
1990.90-516,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,204.003,205.986,Or are you going to say it doesn't make any difference?
1990.90-516,0,39933,richard_m_meyer,,205.986,209.058,--I am going to say that it doesn't make any difference.
1990.90-516,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,284.627,285.228,Excuse me there.
1990.90-516,0,39933,richard_m_meyer,,297.376,320.22,"--The American Law Institute and the American Bar Association have adopted... taking the American Law Institute, which has been a little more active in the area, a... what they call a tentative draft, which is, I think they are now up to tentative draft number 10, which suggests what is called the universal demand requirement."
1990.90-516,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,353.001,354.113,It goes along with this.
1990.90-516,0,39933,richard_m_meyer,,365.671,370.293,"The... no, I don't believe they say that."
1990.90-516,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,440.238,454.857,"Well, Mr. Meyer, under the Seventh Circuit's view, if a demand is made and refused, what's the legal effect of that on the suit?"
1990.90-516,0,39933,richard_m_meyer,,456.279,458.841,That is a question--
1990.90-516,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,458.841,460.822,Under the Seventh Circuit's holding?
1990.90-516,0,39933,richard_m_meyer,,460.822,464.755,--That is a question that has not been answered.
1990.90-516,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,466.337,469.496,And how do you understand its holding in that regard?
1990.90-516,0,39933,richard_m_meyer,,470.908,491.733,"--I understand it in the following way, that assuming that a special litigation committee is formed and makes a recommendation, which invariably is a recommendation that the litigation not go forward, that's invariably the case--"
1990.90-516,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,491.733,492.554,"Well, it may or may not be."
1990.90-516,0,39933,richard_m_meyer,,495.716,496.184,--All right.
1990.90-516,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,581.971,584.963,"Well, then the legal issue changes, as I understand you, Mr. Meyer?"
1990.90-516,0,39933,richard_m_meyer,,595.42,601.664,"--Mr. Chief Justice, I submit that the plaintiff has an impossible row to hoe."
1990.90-516,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,601.664,602.323,"Well, could you answer my question?"
1990.90-516,0,39933,richard_m_meyer,,605.007,605.485,Yes.
1990.90-516,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,615.423,621.628,"So the futility exception really gives the plaintiff a leg up, then."
1990.90-516,0,39933,richard_m_meyer,,627.141,629.001,That's correct.
1990.90-516,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,640.588,641.74,"But Mr. Meyer, excuse me."
1990.90-516,0,39933,richard_m_meyer,,662.944,668.979,--At one point in its opinion the Seventh Circuit does suggest that.
1990.90-516,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,740.326,743.886,I thought the Seventh Circuit went through... I don't know where it is in the opinion.
1990.90-516,0,39933,richard_m_meyer,,776.828,784.013,There are a number of reasons why demand may not be futile.
1990.90-516,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,987.476,989.707,Where... what courts decided these cases?
1990.90-516,0,39933,richard_m_meyer,,989.707,992.269,"--These are appellate courts, circuit courts."
1990.90-516,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,992.269,992.99,Federal courts of appeals?
1990.90-516,0,39933,richard_m_meyer,,992.99,994.041,Federal courts of appeal.
1990.90-516,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1025.13,1026.502,"Very well, Mr. Meyer."
1990.90-516,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1028.182,1037.779,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.90-516,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1080.007,1087.46,"Mr. Dreeben, that's a little odd, isn't it, because this is an action brought under a Federal statute?"
1990.90-516,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1087.46,1089.083,"That's correct, Justice O'Connor."
1990.90-516,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1089.083,1090.192,A Federal cause of action.
1990.90-516,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1096.297,1102.561,"Well, I think the case that's closest related to the particular problem here today is Burks v. Lasker."
1990.90-516,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1102.561,1102.961,Yes.
1990.90-516,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1102.961,1104.123,"It's quite similar, really."
1990.90-516,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1104.123,1104.764,Yes.
1990.90-516,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1104.764,1107.806,It was another derivative action under the Investment Company Act.
1990.90-516,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1107.806,1108.265,Yes.
1990.90-516,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1126.236,1129.979,"Well, there are two responses I'd like to give to that."
1990.90-516,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1200.885,1205.349,What if the State law says that there will be a demand made in every case?
1990.90-516,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1205.349,1215.835,"That... in our view the initial step for a court to follow is to adopt that rule, and then to consider whether it infringes any Federal policy to follow it."
1990.90-516,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1255.102,1259.624,And how do you read the Seventh Circuit's holding about... insofar as that is concerned?
1990.90-516,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1259.624,1273.621,"Well, the Seventh Circuit thought it could achieve a nice distinction, a very logical, tidy distinction between a Federal rule of universal demand and State law governing what happens after demand is made."
1990.90-516,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1321.423,1337.335,"Mr. Dreeben, I understood the Seventh Circuit to avoid that problem by federalizing the latter question as well, that is by saying how much deference you give to the board decision is also a Federal question, and we will not adopt as a matter of Federal law the business judgment rule."
1990.90-516,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1337.335,1341.747,"Well, I am not sure that the court said exactly either of those things."
1990.90-516,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1517.302,1526.208,"Well, how would it obstruct them if you can do pretty much what you want in the way of prosecuting your suit after a demand is turned down?"
1990.90-516,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1527.808,1535.134,"--It would simplify things if there were a coherent way of applying it, and the way of applying it were consistent with Federal law."
1990.90-516,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1555.157,1565.274,"Well, might not the States change some of their laws if... in that regard, if a demand under this statute were treated as a matter of Federal law, and you say you require it in every case?"
1990.90-516,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1565.274,1572.367,"Well, it's certainly possible the States might be forced to change their internal law of corporations if Federal law reached out and grabbed a portion of it."
1990.90-516,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1575.64,1577.521,This whole statute is a Federal statute.
1990.90-516,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1585.026,1599.065,"--That's true, Chief Justice Rehnquist, and if the Court in Burks v. Lasker had ruled that it is always a Federal question when directors can terminate a derivative action under a Federal statute, then we would not be here today arguing that State law is the primary source."
1990.90-516,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1614.646,1615.815,"Thank you, Mr. Dreeben."
1990.90-516,2,30948,joan_m_hall,,1617.698,1628.314,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.90-516,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1772.34,1780.444,"Ms. Hall, you may be dead right that the allegations are insufficient, but neither the court of appeals... the court of appeals didn't rely on that ground, did it?"
1990.90-516,2,30948,joan_m_hall,,1780.444,1781.393,"They did, Your Honor."
1990.90-516,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1781.393,1784.258,But the questions presented by the cert. petition don't raise that.
1990.90-516,2,30948,joan_m_hall,,1793.121,1799.765,"I think that issue is properly before the Court and that it provides an independent ground for affirming the judgment of dismissal, Your Honor."
1990.90-516,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1799.765,1800.597,I see.
1990.90-516,2,30948,joan_m_hall,,1800.597,1805.029,And it also is one part of the holding of the court of appeals.
1990.90-516,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1815.546,1818.459,"Can we say that's all... well, that's an alternative holding rather than dicta, then?"
1990.90-516,2,30948,joan_m_hall,,1818.459,1819.818,"It is an alternative holding, we believe."
1990.90-516,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1827.265,1831.038,"Well... gee, I... see, I didn't understand."
1990.90-516,2,30948,joan_m_hall,,1831.038,1839.754,"At both A16 and A17 of the Seventh Circuit opinion, the Seventh Circuit finds the allegations of futility to be--"
1990.90-516,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1839.754,1841.152,16 and 17?
1990.90-516,2,30948,joan_m_hall,,1841.152,1841.713,--insufficient.
1990.90-516,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1841.713,1845.607,What page was that on?
1990.90-516,2,30948,joan_m_hall,,1845.607,1846.425,"At A16, Your Honor."
1990.90-516,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1891.236,1895.179,"Mrs. Hall, I'm having trouble finding what you're... even A16."
1990.90-516,2,30948,joan_m_hall,,1899.561,1899.921,I'm sorry.
1990.90-516,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1900.272,1905.497,"--portion of the appendix where the ""as do we"" language is found."
1990.90-516,2,30948,joan_m_hall,,1905.497,1905.838,"6A, Your Honor."
1990.90-516,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1914.914,1917.075,"Well, but they do."
1990.90-516,2,30948,joan_m_hall,,1923.328,1929.683,"I think it's an alternative holding, Your Honor, and provides an alternative ground for affirmance of the dismissal in this case."
1990.90-516,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1929.683,1935.176,I don't see... it isn't necessarily alternative.
1990.90-516,2,30948,joan_m_hall,,1946.315,1961.455,"I think he... I think he also reviews these particular allegations and finds them insufficient, and goes on to say in addition that he is abolishing futility as an exception to the demand requirement."
1990.90-516,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2049.822,2058.268,"--Well, what should apply in another suit where the State law argument is not waived?"
1990.90-516,2,30948,joan_m_hall,,2058.268,2069.545,"In that instance, Justice O'Connor, we submit that Federal law would apply, and that's the second reason why we think Federal law properly applies in this case."
1990.90-516,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2158.985,2164.618,"Well, how about the question of the effect of the demand requirement?"
1990.90-516,2,30948,joan_m_hall,,2170.341,2182.168,"Your Honor, the question of standard of review is not before the Court in this case, and the commission is in agreement with us on that point, that this Court should not reach that issue in this case."
1990.90-516,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2183.29,2191.538,"Well, we certainly have to be concerned with it, because it seems to me the questions are very much interrelated ultimately."
1990.90-516,2,30948,joan_m_hall,,2191.538,2201.042,"--We think, Your Honor, that under Burks the question of standard of review would be governed by State law, and in fact that statement appears in the opinion of the court of appeals."
1990.90-516,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2201.042,2218.525,"But I take it the Solicitor General's point is that that just brings us around to where we began, because Delaware's law is predicated on the assumption that there are two types of situations, one where there is demand and one where there is demand excused."
1990.90-516,2,30948,joan_m_hall,,2251.324,2253.777,"I believe it is, Your Honor."
1990.90-516,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2265.756,2273.931,"Well, I am suggesting, as Justice O'Connor suggested, I believe, that it's necessarily involved because you're asking us to adopt a standard that might be completely unworkable."
1990.90-516,2,30948,joan_m_hall,,2273.931,2276.903,"I think the standard is not unworkable, Your Honor."
1990.90-516,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2309.624,2316.129,But that law provides either no answer or an answer that is quite incorrect because it is premised on a false assumption.
1990.90-516,2,30948,joan_m_hall,,2316.129,2316.748,--No.
1990.90-516,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2354.702,2363.18,"It may well be that even though you do come full circle, I suppose, and have to confront the same State law issues, you may not have to do it in as many cases."
1990.90-516,2,30948,joan_m_hall,,2363.18,2364.059,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1990.90-516,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2364.059,2372.315,"In some of the cases, presumably, the corporation will decide to take up the cudgels on behalf of the shareholder."
1990.90-516,2,30948,joan_m_hall,,2372.315,2387.146,"Either the corporation will decide to take up the cudgels on behalf of the shareholders, or in fact the board of directors of a corporation when they are presented with demand have a whole range of intra-corporate dispute resolution mechanisms available to them."
1990.90-516,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2406.568,2424.169,"But where those options do fail, you really don't have any answer to the SG's argument that you may have to get into the same kind of inquiry that we have up to now been conducting or the courts have been conducting under the futility rubric."
1990.90-516,2,30948,joan_m_hall,,2424.169,2425.16,I have two answers.
1990.90-516,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2463.803,2474.902,"Mrs. Hall, more precisely, what exactly was the question decided in Burks what... as to what the directors could do?"
1990.90-516,2,30948,joan_m_hall,,2480.646,2493.074,"--It... I believe the precise question, Your Honor, was whether they had the power to terminate, whether a special litigation committee appointed by the board of directors had the power to terminate a suit brought under the 1940 act."
1990.90-516,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2493.074,2495.906,Brought by whom?
1990.90-516,2,30948,joan_m_hall,,2495.906,2496.345,A shareholder.
1990.90-516,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2496.345,2496.895,By the shareholder.
1990.90-516,2,30948,joan_m_hall,,2496.895,2497.667,A derivative suit.
1990.90-516,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2497.667,2498.618,Thank you.
1990.90-516,2,30948,joan_m_hall,,2498.618,2511.915,In this case we're not... we are confronted with an issue involving the futility exception to the demand requirement which is not a core issue of corporate law.
1990.90-516,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2559.336,2561.979,May I interrupt here because I want to be sure I understand.
1990.90-516,2,30948,joan_m_hall,,2561.979,2562.559,"Yes, Your Honor."
1990.90-516,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2562.559,2565.021,On the review... I know you say it's not before us now--
1990.90-516,2,30948,joan_m_hall,,2565.021,2565.401,Yes.
1990.90-516,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2565.401,2568.142,--But do you have the position there that that is a matter of State law?
1990.90-516,2,30948,joan_m_hall,,2568.142,2568.713,Yes.
1990.90-516,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2570.512,2572.886,"But then why doesn't your, why wasn't your uniformity argument apply equally to that?"
1990.90-516,2,30948,joan_m_hall,,2572.886,2575.117,"Well, I think--"
1990.90-516,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2575.117,2577.118,"Because that, in last analysis that's a question of access to the courts."
1990.90-516,2,30948,joan_m_hall,,2577.118,2584.044,"--I think that that argument is foreclosed by Burks, and we're not urging the overruling of Burks."
1990.90-516,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2595.591,2598.503,Thank you.
1990.90-516,2,30948,joan_m_hall,,2598.503,2603.295,Whereas our issue deals with the right of shareholders to come to the Federal court.
1990.90-516,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2772.036,2773.388,Mrs. Hall--
1990.90-516,2,30948,joan_m_hall,,2773.388,2774.316,"Yes, Your Honor."
1990.90-516,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2774.316,2798.082,"--Your opposing counsel says that the demand requirement is not just kind of a mechanical thing where you can abolish it and then everything will come out all right... come out the same way, and then... but the substantive standard of review of the shareholders' claim is much different under the law of most States where demand has been made and refused than it is where it is shown to be futile."
1990.90-516,2,30948,joan_m_hall,,2799.725,2801.234,"I do not, Your Honor."
1990.90-516,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2868.189,2868.999,"May I ask this, Mrs. Hall?"
1990.90-516,2,30948,joan_m_hall,,2868.999,2869.82,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1990.90-516,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2869.82,2876.094,You're saying... one of your arguments is you'll save a lot of skirmish... time skirmishing about futility if you have an automatic demand rule.
1990.90-516,2,30948,joan_m_hall,,2901.269,2909.125,"Not necessarily, Your Honor, because there will be a certain number of cases in which the board will be able to take action which will obviate the need for a lawsuit."
1990.90-516,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2909.125,2913.077,But even... that's not impossible after a complaint is filed either.
1990.90-516,2,30948,joan_m_hall,,2913.077,2921.713,"It's not impossible, but it becomes very unlikely, and the case law is very clear that demand futility is to be determined as of the time suit is commenced."
1990.90-516,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2929.339,2933.4,Maybe we need more reasonable lawyers on both sides is what we need.
1990.90-516,2,30948,joan_m_hall,,2935.002,2936.272,--It just happens to be true.
1990.90-516,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2936.272,2936.973,"Yeah, okay."
1990.90-516,2,30948,joan_m_hall,,2936.973,2951.222,"Your Honor, I think that this case is a classic example of a situation where a demand should have been made."
1990.90-516,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2971.945,2974.898,"Yeah, but that wouldn't have done any good because they have already hired the investment advisor."
1990.90-516,2,30948,joan_m_hall,,2983.352,2989.186,"Well, the mutual fund must seek approval of its fees."
1990.90-516,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2989.186,2989.686,Right.
1990.90-516,2,30948,joan_m_hall,,2997.343,2998.112,That's correct.
1990.90-516,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2998.863,3000.974,"And if later on you send out a corrected proxy statement, what good does that do?"
1990.90-516,2,30948,joan_m_hall,,3000.974,3011.042,"--Well, if, it gives the shareholders the opportunity to vote with that additional information, which petitioner claims they needed to have."
1990.90-516,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3011.042,3013.814,It gives them an opportunity for a petition for rehearing in effect?
1990.90-516,2,30948,joan_m_hall,,3013.814,3014.655,Right.
1990.90-516,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3014.655,3015.306,Yeah.
1990.90-516,2,30948,joan_m_hall,,3015.306,3020.127,And it obviates the need for a lawsuit on a proxy claim.
1990.90-516,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3044.674,3053.911,"Or they might have appointed an impartial committee to resolve the question, as some corporations do, I suppose--"
1990.90-516,2,30948,joan_m_hall,,3053.911,3054.309,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1990.90-516,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3054.309,3058.162,--which would also avoid ever having to confront the futility question.
1990.90-516,2,30948,joan_m_hall,,3058.162,3060.933,That's correct.
1990.90-516,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3204.827,3206.639,"Thank you, Mrs. Hall."
1990.90-516,3,39933,richard_m_meyer,,3210.133,3213.425,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1990.90-516,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3379.762,3380.934,"Thank you, Mr. Meyer."
