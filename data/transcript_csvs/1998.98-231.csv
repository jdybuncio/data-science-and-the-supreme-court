1998.98-231,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,53.165,"We'll hear argument next in No. 98-231, Grupo Mexicano de Desarrollo v. Alliance Bond Fund."
1998.98-231,0,39903,richard_a_mescon,,54.236,56.259,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1998.98-231,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,93.144,99.058,"Mr. Mescon, do you mind giving us a little preliminary information here?"
1998.98-231,0,39903,richard_a_mescon,,123.414,124.946,"That is correct, Justice O'Connor."
1998.98-231,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,124.946,126.416,And there's a bond outstanding--
1998.98-231,0,39903,richard_a_mescon,,126.416,127.117,That is correct.
1998.98-231,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,127.117,130.889,--which could be... the damages could be secured from the bond.
1998.98-231,0,39903,richard_a_mescon,,139.015,140.157,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1998.98-231,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,140.157,142.728,And no appeal was taken from that.
1998.98-231,0,39903,richard_a_mescon,,142.728,145.09,The--
1998.98-231,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,145.09,146.482,Is that right?
1998.98-231,0,39903,richard_a_mescon,,146.482,147.229,"--That is correct, Justice O'Connor."
1998.98-231,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,147.229,147.74,Okay.
1998.98-231,0,39903,richard_a_mescon,,152.134,167.185,The issues that would... that Your Honor has suggested would render this appeal moot arise in cases where the issue to be decided on the merits is the same as the issue to be decided in the preliminary injunction.
1998.98-231,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,220.953,224.065,"And on that, you rest on New York law basically."
1998.98-231,0,39903,richard_a_mescon,,224.065,225.905,"Right, that under... no."
1998.98-231,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,237.134,248.261,What are your damages from... what... what would you receive if you showed that the preliminary injunction was wrong even though the... the final injunction is okay?
1998.98-231,0,39903,richard_a_mescon,,248.261,267.773,"Justice Scalia, if I could prevail on proving that and establishing damages, my damages would be the loss to GMD for the inability to restructure its debt, conduct its business, and organize its affairs during the 4 months of the pendency of the preliminary injunction, which damages--"
1998.98-231,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,267.773,269.756,"Well, but it shouldn't have been doing that anyway."
1998.98-231,0,39903,richard_a_mescon,,276.818,277.369,--No.
1998.98-231,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,279.499,280.31,Not the preliminary.
1998.98-231,0,39903,richard_a_mescon,,281.242,282.183,--No.
1998.98-231,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,300.254,306.628,You're talking about a period then just between the issuance of the preliminary injunction and the final injunction.
1998.98-231,0,39903,richard_a_mescon,,306.628,307.59,"--That is correct, Mr. Chief Justice."
1998.98-231,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,307.59,312.533,"And you say that that caused discrete, demonstrable damages to your client."
1998.98-231,0,39903,richard_a_mescon,,312.533,314.175,We would... we have not yet proved that.
1998.98-231,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,314.175,315.093,That's the theory of your case.
1998.98-231,0,39903,richard_a_mescon,,315.093,316.034,"Yes, Justice Kennedy."
1998.98-231,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,316.034,328.483,"The theory behind that is that it may entirely be proper now to enjoin a certain use of those assets, but it would not have been wrong to use those assets for the other purposes, for want of which you have sustained damages."
1998.98-231,0,39903,richard_a_mescon,,328.483,329.084,That is correct.
1998.98-231,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,339.791,353.739,"Mr. Mescon, I thought Judge Martin said, look, I basically want to make sure that if there is, as I think there will be, a judgment for the plaintiff, there's something to realize it against, but I don't want to be rigid about this."
1998.98-231,0,39903,richard_a_mescon,,376.074,378.065,"Justice Ginsburg, you're correct."
1998.98-231,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,402.051,402.902,For parties other than this plaintiff.
1998.98-231,0,39903,richard_a_mescon,,402.902,404.111,Pardon me?
1998.98-231,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,404.111,405.333,For parties other than this plaintiff.
1998.98-231,0,39903,richard_a_mescon,,405.333,406.533,Parties other than this plaintiff.
1998.98-231,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,406.533,423.864,"So, the... what you... you are arguing essentially, if I understand you, that you wanted to be able to deal with your other creditors so that there would not be... the consequence of that would... there would not be these assets against which the final decision could be realized."
1998.98-231,0,39903,richard_a_mescon,,423.864,427.567,"I would only quibble with one part of your comment, Justice Ginsburg."
1998.98-231,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,445.418,450.291,So... but the judges... we're talking about a 3 and a half month period?
1998.98-231,0,39903,richard_a_mescon,,450.291,452.845,"It's a week less than 4 months, Justice Ginsburg."
1998.98-231,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,452.845,461.12,"And you said something about the court hasn't power to do this preliminarily, and one of the reasons was, you said, in New York they wouldn't do it."
1998.98-231,0,39903,richard_a_mescon,,485.896,486.035,Right.
1998.98-231,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1639.233,1640.723,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1998.98-231,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1681.031,1695.731,But... but here the theory of the petitioner is... is that the reason any mischief happened was because it was at the initial injunction stage.
1998.98-231,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1695.731,1698.152,"I understand that, Justice Kennedy, but I think that what--"
1998.98-231,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1698.152,1706.606,"It's the difference between the preliminary and the permanent injunction that is the very theory of his case, and that just wasn't involved in the case that you cite."
1998.98-231,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1706.606,1708.299,--That is correct.
1998.98-231,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1757.801,1777.213,"But that may be true, Mr. Days, but if... if the petitioner is right, that the authority to issue the preliminary injunction is... is nonexistent, whereas the authority to issue the permanent injunction is clear, I would think that would be enough to at least give the structure of a claim for damages on the bond."
1998.98-231,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1777.213,1790.472,"Mr. Chief Justice, with... with respect, this Court has said that where one wants to have those types of issues resolved, they have to be resolved after trial on the merits and judgment."
1998.98-231,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1792.783,1796.967,But if... if... maybe you need a separate suit on the bond.
1998.98-231,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1810.835,1825.996,"--Well, I think, Mr. Chief Justice, but what the district judge, in essence, found was that the activities of GMD that were preliminarily enjoined were correctly enjoined, and that's what the permanent injunction is all about."
1998.98-231,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1825.996,1837.803,"Yes, but if we decide he was laboring under a misapprehension as to what his authority was to issue a preliminary injunction, then... you know, that... that goes to the merits of this case certainly to a certain extent."
1998.98-231,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1844.168,1868.742,"Yes, I think that is certainly possible, Mr. Chief Justice, but what it opens up is the ability of any party who's been dissatisfied with a ruling on a preliminary injunction to raise not just the basic propriety of the issuance of the preliminary injunction, namely, whether it met the basic requirements of rule 65, but larger issues, or even issues as to do with whether there was irreparable harm."
1998.98-231,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1874.235,1888.795,"Well, but, Mr. Days, it wouldn't really... it wouldn't really open up that Pandora's box if it only applied to cases in which it was contended that there was an absence of power during the interval between the time of the preliminary injunction entered and the judgment in the case was entered on the merits."
1998.98-231,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1888.795,1889.697,Yes.
1998.98-231,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1890.588,1891.808,And I think he agrees it would be limited to that.
1998.98-231,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1891.808,1892.399,Yes.
1998.98-231,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1923.529,1934.766,"Well, that... that would certainly perhaps be a defense to a damage... a partial defense to a damages action, that you had it within your power to correct this situation without enduring it."
1998.98-231,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1938.848,1940.731,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice."
1998.98-231,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2141.832,2149.049,"Mr. Days, do you think that the merger of law and equity enlarged the... the kind of remedies that were available?"
1998.98-231,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,2149.049,2168.249,"--I think, Mr. Chief Justice, what the merger did was allow a court, sitting on both law and equity cases, to use remedies that previously would have been available only in a court of equity after there had been some satisfaction of a judgment in... on the law side of the court."
1998.98-231,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2168.249,2178.918,"But do you think that if a court of equity couldn't have given it before there was a judgment and then you merge law and equity, wouldn't the rules still be the same?"
1998.98-231,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,2184.721,2202.984,"Well, I think... I think that certainly if the law had been clear in that respect, the courts had been very clear that no matter what the circumstances, no matter what the merger, no matter what happened to the Seventh Amendment rights that were always implicated in that type of situation, then we'd have a different... different problem."
1998.98-231,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2202.984,2204.574,Do you have any cases to the contrary?
1998.98-231,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,2210.727,2226.919,"We do not have a case that deals specifically with this question, but I think the... this Court in... in Dairy Queen v. Wood pointed out the kind of time-bound nature of decisions like Scott v. Neely."
1998.98-231,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2226.919,2235.035,There have been deadbeat creditors... deadbeat debtors who... who were going to try to get rid of their property forever.
1998.98-231,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,2270.199,2290.331,"Justice Scalia, I think that what rule 65 does is embody all of the principles of equity power, and I don't think those decisions that have been cited by... by GMD stand for the proposition that they would absolutely have been foreclosed after a merger of law and equity."
1998.98-231,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2290.331,2292.372,But you don't have a single case that--
1998.98-231,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,2292.372,2302.299,"Well, I think that the fact that there haven't been many of these cases arising is reflective of the fact that in most instances we don't have the unique circumstances presented in this case."
1998.98-231,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2348.759,2352.773,--Are you saying that we're doing this to supplement the void in the bankruptcy laws?
1998.98-231,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,2352.773,2354.382,No.
1998.98-231,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2360.186,2366.31,"Well, I would have thought that would have been... it's your argument, not mine... not a bad argument because--"
1998.98-231,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,2366.31,2368.862,"I'll accept it then, Mr. Justice Kennedy."
1998.98-231,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2368.862,2371.225,"--Assuming the assets were, say, in the State of California--"
1998.98-231,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,2371.225,2372.184,Yes.
1998.98-231,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2372.184,2377.639,"--in this case, GMD had its assets, I take it you could have initiated an involuntary bankruptcy proceeding?"
1998.98-231,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,2377.639,2378.168,"Yes, that is correct."
1998.98-231,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2378.168,2378.859,All right.
1998.98-231,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,2385.464,2387.945,I think it's a very persuasive argument.
1998.98-231,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2387.945,2394.831,Equity simply fills in any gap that may result from an absence of a bankruptcy law in Mexico?
1998.98-231,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,2394.831,2402.564,"Well, I... I won't... I don't want to go to the point of seeing this as merely a gap-filling procedure."
1998.98-231,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,2423.378,2423.849,But it seems to me--
1998.98-231,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,2423.849,2424.82,--nothing that can be done.
1998.98-231,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2424.82,2428.251,"--That's... that's the minimum of what you're doing, and you may be even doing more."
1998.98-231,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,2437.206,2440.319,"Well, I don't think it's a sweeping change."
1998.98-231,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2457.141,2461.813,I take it you say that the reason this isn't coming up a lot is obvious.
1998.98-231,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,2475.383,2475.964,What is the objection to... to this approach?
1998.98-231,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2475.964,2475.971,No.
1998.98-231,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,2483.908,2485.919,"Yes, that is correct."
1998.98-231,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2486.87,2487.211,No.
1998.98-231,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,2497.036,2508.242,"--I'm not prepared to say that there would be a wholesale transporting of the Mareva injunction approach to the United States, but I think it does say two important things."
1998.98-231,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2518.911,2527.877,And you think we have the same freedom in developing new rules of equity as the... as the House of Lords does?
1998.98-231,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,2530.298,2533.6,"I understand that, Justice Scalia."
1998.98-231,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2533.6,2537.494,And we have the same... we have the same authority to... to revise equitable--
1998.98-231,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,2537.494,2558.946,"I think what it says is that to the extent that this Court has held and it's held for a number of years that, as long as Federal courts are applying principles of equity that were handed to the courts in 1789 in the first judiciary act, then they can continue to do that and they can determine--"
1998.98-231,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2558.946,2560.238,--I just found an old treatise somewhere.
1998.98-231,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,2588.054,2588.765,--Yes.
1998.98-231,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2589.837,2590.297,What was the reason?
1998.98-231,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,2590.886,2592.429,--I... I think the reasons aren't given.
1998.98-231,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2648.025,2651.988,--May I ask you to comment on an aspect of the case that I am just kind of puzzled about?
1998.98-231,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,2684.639,2693.715,"Justice Stevens, that's obviously an issue that a trial judge, a Federal trial judge, would have to consider very carefully."
1998.98-231,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2770.106,2776.069,"Mr. Days, I'm a little concerned about your taking Erie out of the picture because you say they didn't mention it."
1998.98-231,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,2798.304,2801.815,"Well, that's correct, Justice Ginsburg."
1998.98-231,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2836.557,2840.17,But rule 64 says you can... you can... it's a permissive rule.
1998.98-231,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,2842.421,2843.112,Yes.
1998.98-231,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2843.112,2848.866,"Rule 65, at least Mr. Mescon tells us, is a how-to rule."
1998.98-231,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,2853.86,2854.329,Yes.
1998.98-231,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2884.74,2889.163,"Well, I thought Judge McLaughlin, who knows something about New York law, said New York law... you couldn't get this in New York."
1998.98-231,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,2889.163,2900.591,"--Well, Justice Ginsburg, as I indicated earlier, I don't think that that particular comment can be read for the proposition that GMD invokes it for."
1998.98-231,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2932.551,2939.217,What particular provision of rule 65 is it that you think is substantive rather than procedural?
1998.98-231,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,2939.217,2954.845,"--Well, Your Honor, I... it is not a question of whether it says explicitly that the rules of equity must apply, but what... as we've indicated in our brief, rule 65 is a result of a development from--"
1998.98-231,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2954.845,2955.586,I... I take it then--
1998.98-231,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,2955.586,2956.457,--1789.
1998.98-231,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2956.457,2959.449,--I take it then there isn't anything in the rule that--
1998.98-231,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,2959.449,2960.34,That is correct.
1998.98-231,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2966.043,2966.653,--I thought none of the rules could be--
1998.98-231,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,2966.653,2967.494,I beg your pardon?
1998.98-231,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2967.494,2974.519,"--I thought none of the rules could be substantive, because didn't Congress say in the Rules Enabling Act, you can't do things that affect substantive rights?"
1998.98-231,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,2974.519,2977.051,"Well, that is... that is correct, certainly, Justice Ginsburg."
1998.98-231,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2994.662,3011.852,"Well, you would probably be willing to hazard this far at least, that if... if the State in question under... under rule 64 did not permit injunctions at all, you could still get an injunction in Federal court by reason of rule 65."
1998.98-231,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,3011.852,3014.244,"Well, in fact, rule... under 64--"
1998.98-231,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,3014.244,3015.255,I'm... yes.
1998.98-231,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,3015.255,3015.646,--Yes.
1998.98-231,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3017.636,3018.227,No.
1998.98-231,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,3021.049,3021.599,Yes.
1998.98-231,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3021.599,3024.552,Would you be able to get an injunction in Federal court by reason of rule 65?
1998.98-231,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,3024.552,3033.337,"I would say yes, Your Honor, because as this Court has indicated, it tries to get... and Justice Ginsburg's questions I think got to this point."
1998.98-231,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3071.712,3077.977,What... what do you think rule 65 says substantively that is in conflict with the New York rule?
1998.98-231,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,3077.977,3092.209,"--What New York... what... what rule 65 says... and it has always been part of equity... is when a party faces irreparable harm and has no adequate remedy at law, Federal courts remain open and available--"
1998.98-231,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3092.209,3095.702,Is this... you're not reading from the rule.
1998.98-231,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,3095.702,3096.059,"--No, I'm not."
1998.98-231,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3098.78,3103.145,"Well, but I mean, is there some sentence in rule 65 you can point to that--"
1998.98-231,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,3103.145,3123.788,"I cannot point to some sentence, but I repeat, Mr. Chief Justice, that it has always been understand... understood to be a bedrock principle of Federal equity, that when a party is experiencing irreparable harm and has no adequate remedy at law, that equity will come to the... the support of that particular litigant."
1998.98-231,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3123.788,3128.881,"--Well, yes, that may be, but I think it would have to be derived from somewhere other than rule 65."
1998.98-231,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,3144.461,3145.871,"No, I'm not saying that, but I am saying--"
1998.98-231,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3145.871,3147.383,"Well, but that's the issue before us."
1998.98-231,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,3152.496,3155.618,--I certainly hope that's not the situation.
1998.98-231,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3155.618,3156.639,"No, probably not."
1998.98-231,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,3156.639,3178.316,"But... but even if rule 65 were not directly on point, we think that this Court's decisions in Byrd v. Blue Ridge Electric and, indeed, the discussion in Gasperini points to the fact that there are essential characteristics of Federal courts that need to be protected even where the Erie analysis comes into play."
1998.98-231,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3221.762,3223.573,"Yes, but this wasn't, you know, catch me if you can."
1998.98-231,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,3232.869,3233.5,--There was no--
1998.98-231,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3233.5,3238.563,--They didn't want to do it simply in order to avoid paying the judgment that might ensue from this.
1998.98-231,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,3243.405,3244.096,--Well--
1998.98-231,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3244.096,3246.958,I thought that's the agreed upon state of matters.
1998.98-231,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,3246.958,3252.124,"--Justice Scalia, there is no explicit finding of fraud here."
1998.98-231,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3300.854,3305.405,"May I ask just a technical question about this, what's... what's left here."
1998.98-231,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,3305.405,3305.946,Yes.
1998.98-231,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3305.946,3306.647,We have a permanent injunction--
1998.98-231,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,3306.647,3307.268,Yes.
1998.98-231,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3307.268,3313.061,--and the possibility of a suit for damages against the bond.
1998.98-231,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,3316.544,3318.465,The appeal bond is still in existence.
1998.98-231,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3386.278,3387.5,"Thank you, Mr. Days."

1998.98-231,2,39903,richard_a_mescon,,3390.603,3392.474,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1998.98-231,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3437.293,3439.514,I suppose the State legislature could make that decision.
1998.98-231,2,39903,richard_a_mescon,,3439.514,3441.685,"--And the State legislatures could do that as well, yes, Justice Stevens."

1998.98-231,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3492.158,3494.389,--You did... I got... picked that up from what you said.
1998.98-231,2,39903,richard_a_mescon,,3494.389,3495.0,"Okay, fine."
1998.98-231,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3495.0,3496.482,"You did answer the question, and it was helpful."
1998.98-231,2,39903,richard_a_mescon,,3496.482,3509.329,"And finally, with regard to the question of the merger of law and equity, it is correct cases like Stainback and Gordon made clear that the merger of law and equity have made no fundamental difference on the powers of this Court acting as a court--"
1998.98-231,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3509.329,3517.824,"If we ruled for you, would we necessarily be disavowing the Marcos case, or are there distinctions between the two so that Marcos could stand and you could still prevail?"
1998.98-231,2,39903,richard_a_mescon,,3517.824,3530.563,"--I cannot find the principal distinction between our case and... the Marcos case cries out for something because the facts are very bad and the facts here are much more favorable to... to our client, which makes this a... a better case from our side of the table."
