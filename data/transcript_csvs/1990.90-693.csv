1990.90-693,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.827,"We'll hear argument next in No. 90-693, Curtis Johnson v. Home State Bank."
1990.90-693,0,44835,w_thomas_gilman,,48.493,49.304,Thank you.
1990.90-693,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,145.309,146.08,That's a liquidation.
1990.90-693,0,44835,w_thomas_gilman,,146.08,146.941,That's correct.
1990.90-693,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,162.402,174.671,"But did the... in the chapter 7 proceeding, did the general creditors receive any equity in the property that would be left after the foreclosure if there were some equity?"
1990.90-693,0,44835,w_thomas_gilman,,174.671,183.667,"No, in fact the... in the chapter 7 procedure the bank was what we call undersecured, meaning that there was no equity in this property whatsoever."
1990.90-693,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,193.103,204.282,"When you say undersecured, the value of the bank security was not sufficient... would not be sufficient to pay off a face of its note?"
1990.90-693,0,44835,w_thomas_gilman,,204.282,204.753,That's correct.
1990.90-693,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,204.753,213.798,In that position would the bank be entitled to participate with the general creditors to the extent of the unsecured balance?
1990.90-693,0,44835,w_thomas_gilman,,213.798,214.369,Absolutely.
1990.90-693,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,214.369,216.831,Was that sort of order made?
1990.90-693,0,44835,w_thomas_gilman,,216.831,220.123,"It's made as of a matter of course, and it was in this case, yes."
1990.90-693,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,231.1,233.194,Based on the appraised value of the property?
1990.90-693,0,44835,w_thomas_gilman,,233.194,245.822,"No, in this case what it was was oil and gas proceeds that had accrued before the filing of the chapter 7 and were in suspense and were available for the trustee in the chapter 7 proceeding to take charge of as first creditor."
1990.90-693,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,245.822,248.106,"Those being the only assets available, I take it?"
1990.90-693,0,44835,w_thomas_gilman,,248.106,252.27,Those were the only... as I recall those were the only assets available for unsecured creditors.
1990.90-693,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,252.27,263.737,"Mr. Gilman, now the court below did not address the questions of feasibility or good faith--"
1990.90-693,0,44835,w_thomas_gilman,,263.737,264.388,That's correct.
1990.90-693,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,264.388,264.648,--I take it.
1990.90-693,0,44835,w_thomas_gilman,,281.49,282.601,"Yes, that's right, Your Honor."
1990.90-693,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,312.881,314.323,Was it the only bidder there?
1990.90-693,0,44835,w_thomas_gilman,,314.323,314.834,--Excuse me?
1990.90-693,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,314.834,316.655,Was it the only bidder?
1990.90-693,0,44835,w_thomas_gilman,,316.655,317.265,Yes.
1990.90-693,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,348.637,350.911,What was his purpose in doing that?
1990.90-693,0,44835,w_thomas_gilman,,350.911,352.38,In filing the chapter 13?
1990.90-693,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,352.38,352.811,Yes.
1990.90-693,0,44835,w_thomas_gilman,,352.811,357.245,His purpose is to try to retain ownership in his farmland.
1990.90-693,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,360.746,363.279,"To delay the foreclosure, I suppose?"
1990.90-693,0,44835,w_thomas_gilman,,363.279,366.551,"--Well, it's true that it did delay the foreclosure, but--"
1990.90-693,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,366.551,368.232,Wasn't... wasn't that one of his purposes?
1990.90-693,0,44835,w_thomas_gilman,,368.232,373.775,"--No, I think his honest purpose was to try to pay for his land and retain his land."
1990.90-693,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,379.149,390.905,"He would... he would... in the ordinary course of events if the forecloser went forward, he would have a limited time to get it back, wouldn't he?"
1990.90-693,0,44835,w_thomas_gilman,,390.905,391.696,That's correct.
1990.90-693,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,391.937,397.292,And a shorter time than what his chapter 13 plan called for.
1990.90-693,0,44835,w_thomas_gilman,,397.292,398.02,--No question about that.
1990.90-693,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,398.02,398.581,Well--
1990.90-693,0,44835,w_thomas_gilman,,415.492,420.146,That's one of the purposes of chapter 13 is to string out the payment--
1990.90-693,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,420.146,422.77,The so called cram-down provisions--
1990.90-693,0,44835,w_thomas_gilman,,422.77,423.588,"--Right, and chapter 13--"
1990.90-693,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,423.588,424.018,--would be available.
1990.90-693,0,44835,w_thomas_gilman,,424.018,430.253,"--Yes, in chapter 13 it's... it's an almost automatic cram-down as opposed to in chapter 11 where you have to do more--"
1990.90-693,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,430.253,435.048,So the... the foreclosure would just not take place if it were allowed?
1990.90-693,0,44835,w_thomas_gilman,,435.048,436.097,--That's correct.
1990.90-693,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,441.412,445.974,Do creditors get to express a view under chapter 13--
1990.90-693,0,44835,w_thomas_gilman,,445.974,446.675,"Oh, yes."
1990.90-693,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,446.675,448.134,--as to whether they should go further?
1990.90-693,0,44835,w_thomas_gilman,,448.134,448.895,"Oh, yes."
1990.90-693,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,453.209,465.748,"And if under chapter 13, the debtor fails to meet his payment schedule, can the bank at that time ask to be relieved... released from the automatic stay?"
1990.90-693,0,44835,w_thomas_gilman,,465.748,468.5,It'd be... it would be dismissed.
1990.90-693,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,479.567,492.687,"In... under this chapter 13 cram-down provision, is it just the interest of the creditors that are considered or adjusted against one another or is the debtor's interest, too, considered as to whether the thing should go forward?"
1990.90-693,0,44835,w_thomas_gilman,,492.687,500.104,"In the chapter 13 proceeding, the interests of the debtor take... have a greater weight than the interest of the creditor, in my view."
1990.90-693,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,500.104,513.433,Did you say that the... did you say that the amount of the debts that are listed in a chapter 13 petition may be scaled down by the plan or just strung out?
1990.90-693,0,44835,w_thomas_gilman,,513.433,517.725,"Well, the amount that's listed is the amount that's owed."
1990.90-693,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,519.938,521.057,"Well, just forget it."
1990.90-693,0,44835,w_thomas_gilman,,539.229,543.673,--It can call for payment of 0 percent of the unsecured debt scheduled and be confirmed.
1990.90-693,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,543.673,546.074,And does that often happen?
1990.90-693,0,44835,w_thomas_gilman,,546.074,549.867,"In my experience, this happened a couple of times."
1990.90-693,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,549.867,551.417,"Uh-huh, uh-huh."
1990.90-693,0,44835,w_thomas_gilman,,551.417,552.078,But--
1990.90-693,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,552.078,558.423,"Now, what if... what if... do you think the same can happen when the only debt scheduled is a secured debt?"
1990.90-693,0,44835,w_thomas_gilman,,558.423,560.346,--That's normally when it does happen.
1990.90-693,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,560.346,571.451,You mean... you mean that... you... he... let's assume that... let's assume that the only thing there is is a claim against property.
1990.90-693,0,44835,w_thomas_gilman,,581.757,581.907,No.
1990.90-693,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,583.499,584.26,"No, of course, it couldn't."
1990.90-693,0,44835,w_thomas_gilman,,587.971,594.936,"The debt... no, the debt... the claim would be allowed in the amount of the value of the collateral and you would have to propose in your plan to pay the value of the collateral--"
1990.90-693,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,594.936,595.968,The entire... the entire amount.
1990.90-693,0,44835,w_thomas_gilman,,595.968,597.709,--The entire value of the collateral.
1990.90-693,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,597.709,600.6,Not the entire amount of the debt?
1990.90-693,0,44835,w_thomas_gilman,,600.6,609.128,"No, under section 506 of the bankruptcy code, the amount... the amount of the secured debt is tied to the value of the collateral."
1990.90-693,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,624.738,631.003,"Well, the debt... the debt has actually been discharged in the... it's just a claim against a property that hasn't been discharged."
1990.90-693,0,44835,w_thomas_gilman,,631.003,632.255,That's the nut of the issue here.
1990.90-693,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,632.255,632.776,Yes.
1990.90-693,0,44835,w_thomas_gilman,,632.776,638.629,The... the debt has been discharged and the question is what is the effect of a discharge on a debt.
1990.90-693,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,651.078,656.17,And why does the in rem right pass through?
1990.90-693,0,44835,w_thomas_gilman,,658.431,661.173,"Yes, section 5--"
1990.90-693,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,661.173,663.494,I mean that... that claim against the property is not discharged.
1990.90-693,0,44835,w_thomas_gilman,,663.494,664.395,--That's correct.
1990.90-693,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,664.395,667.057,Because of a provision in the statute.
1990.90-693,0,44835,w_thomas_gilman,,667.057,667.587,That's correct.
1990.90-693,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,667.587,675.965,Because you have to claim here that the claim against the property is a claim... is a debt.
1990.90-693,0,44835,w_thomas_gilman,,678.787,684.694,"Well, I want to use the terms claim and debt coextensively as we learned in Davenport."
1990.90-693,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,688.207,691.96,Because otherwise... otherwise the claim against the property would be discharged in chapter 7.
1990.90-693,0,44835,w_thomas_gilman,,691.96,696.502,"No, a secured debt... a lien passes through a chapter--"
1990.90-693,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,696.502,697.543,"Well, I... I know but why does it?"
1990.90-693,0,44835,w_thomas_gilman,,703.626,707.149,"--Yes, that's correct."
1990.90-693,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,707.149,711.834,Why do you have to prove that it's a claim or a debt for purposes of chapter 13?
1990.90-693,0,44835,w_thomas_gilman,,723.374,733.562,"Well, the reason we have to show that there... that the bank has a claim is because in order to address the claim in the bankruptcy, the claim has to exist."
1990.90-693,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,735.653,737.072,Where... where is the section?
1990.90-693,0,44835,w_thomas_gilman,,744.588,745.689,"--Well, section--"
1990.90-693,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,745.689,748.211,--Where does it say that you have to have a claim?
1990.90-693,0,44835,w_thomas_gilman,,748.211,752.275,--109 provides that section--
1990.90-693,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,752.275,753.574,1... 109?
1990.90-693,0,44835,w_thomas_gilman,,753.574,765.274,"--Section 109 is the eligibility provisions... is the eligibility statute, and that says that they have to have a certain amount of claims in order to be eligible for a chapter 13 bankruptcy."
1990.90-693,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,779.774,785.81,Why didn't your client file under chapter 13 in the first place?
1990.90-693,0,44835,w_thomas_gilman,,785.81,789.232,He was not eligible at the time to file a chapter 13 because he had too much debt.
1990.90-693,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,789.232,792.884,So he first got rid of some of the debt under chapter 7?
1990.90-693,0,44835,w_thomas_gilman,,792.884,794.757,Essentially that's correct.
1990.90-693,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1014.122,1014.703,At the--
1990.90-693,0,44835,w_thomas_gilman,,1017.275,1030.013,"Because in section 524, Congress specifically said that only the in personam rights are dischargeable in chapter 7 or any other chapter of the bankruptcy code."
1990.90-693,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1030.013,1032.895,You mean the in personam right to payment?
1990.90-693,0,44835,w_thomas_gilman,,1032.895,1035.366,"Yes, I do."
1990.90-693,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1039.71,1042.902,"Mr. Gilman, why would... I don't understand why Congress would do it that way."
1990.90-693,0,44835,w_thomas_gilman,,1066.788,1076.395,"--Well, what they eventually did was pass chapter 12, Your Honor, for farmers, which is specifically the problem that was being encountered throughout the... especially the Midwest."
1990.90-693,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1076.395,1085.801,"Well, but that wasn't... we're just talking about 7 and 13 right now, and it just seems to me quite contrary to what must have been the congressional intent."
1990.90-693,0,44835,w_thomas_gilman,,1094.677,1095.758,But on the other hand--
1990.90-693,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1095.758,1100.113,"--the creditor to proceed under 7 first and lower your debt, and they proceed under 13."
1990.90-693,0,44835,w_thomas_gilman,,1102.015,1104.828,"--But on the other hand, they didn't limit it anywhere in the code."
1990.90-693,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1109.88,1111.442,Unless you're wrong about the meaning of claim.
1990.90-693,0,44835,w_thomas_gilman,,1111.442,1112.142,--Well--
1990.90-693,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1112.142,1113.493,Maybe that's how they limited it.
1990.90-693,0,44835,w_thomas_gilman,,1113.493,1122.729,"--That's true, but I... I think that the plain language and also the decision in Davenport requires a holding that an in rem right is a... is a claim."
1990.90-693,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1122.729,1129.123,"I'm sure... I'm sure it is, but it isn't discharged in the chapter 7."
1990.90-693,0,44835,w_thomas_gilman,,1138.769,1139.38,Exactly.
1990.90-693,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1140.752,1145.284,And so they wanted to save that... they wanted to save that kind of a claim.
1990.90-693,0,44835,w_thomas_gilman,,1154.321,1162.397,"No, well, I'm saying that they did not pass anything that would prohibit my client from filing a chapter 13 after he gets a discharge on chapter 7."
1990.90-693,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1162.397,1177.588,"Well, you can say that... you can say like the court of appeals did for example, that the right to payment they're talking about is right to payment from the debtor not from property."
1990.90-693,0,44835,w_thomas_gilman,,1177.588,1182.292,"But that... but that's not in the statute, and I think section 102(2) belies that statement."
1990.90-693,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1182.292,1184.783,"Well, I--"
1990.90-693,0,44835,w_thomas_gilman,,1197.142,1206.117,"Well, if Congress did not mean to include in rem liabilities as claims, then I don't see what the purpose of section 102(2) was."
1990.90-693,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1206.117,1218.915,"Well, but I... simply as a matter of language it doesn't seem to me that your position just automatically establishes itself."
1990.90-693,0,44835,w_thomas_gilman,,1221.937,1222.768,I agree with that.
1990.90-693,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1257.002,1260.896,You say unless it's unenforceable against the debtor or property of the debtor?
1990.90-693,0,44835,w_thomas_gilman,,1260.896,1267.12,The language of the statute is unless it's unenforceable against the debtor and property of the debtor.
1990.90-693,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1267.12,1267.28,Right.

1990.90-693,0,44835,w_thomas_gilman,,1287.967,1293.131,--It says it will be allowed unless the claim is unenforceable.

1990.90-693,0,44835,w_thomas_gilman,,1301.557,1306.291,"And in this case, it's enforceable against property of the debtor and therefore the claim will be allowed."

1990.90-693,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1826.129,1827.7,That's why it's not a claim anymore.

1990.90-693,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1868.49,1868.851,Okay.

1990.90-693,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1954.739,1959.193,And how did... how did... I don't quite understand your response to Justice Souter.

1990.90-693,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1975.596,1975.766,Right.
1990.90-693,1,19943,calvin_dee_rider,,1975.766,1978.259,--I may have misunderstood Justice Souter's question.
1990.90-693,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1982.661,1982.831,Right.
1990.90-693,1,19943,calvin_dee_rider,,1982.831,1986.164,--and still has that in rem remedy after the chapter 7 discharge.
1990.90-693,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1986.164,1987.985,"And it no longer has a personal claim, correct?"
1990.90-693,1,19943,calvin_dee_rider,,1987.985,1988.726,That's correct.
1990.90-693,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1988.726,2005.127,"Mr. Rider, what... is it the case that if this is a claim or a debt under chapter 13 it would necessarily be one under chapter 7 so that it would automatically have been discharged?"
1990.90-693,1,19943,calvin_dee_rider,,2007.26,2009.17,That... that is one of our positions.
1990.90-693,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2010.743,2018.127,The only thing that prevents this from... from being discharged in chapter 7 is the fact that it's not a claim?

1990.90-693,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2024.892,2029.354,"That's because of a specific provision, isn't it?"
1990.90-693,1,19943,calvin_dee_rider,,2037.78,2039.06,--That is correct.
1990.90-693,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2039.06,2041.672,The claim against the property is not discharged.
1990.90-693,1,19943,calvin_dee_rider,,2041.672,2045.365,The in rem remedy against the property is not discharged.
1990.90-693,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2045.365,2045.915,"Well, which is correct?"
1990.90-693,1,19943,calvin_dee_rider,,2060.018,2061.78,That is correct.
1990.90-693,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2061.78,2062.21,All right.
1990.90-693,1,19943,calvin_dee_rider,,2062.21,2074.668,"In the Bullard case and this Court's case of... in Louisville v. Radford, it's been long recognized that the bankruptcy does not destroy a mortgage even on exempt property."
1990.90-693,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2141.582,2146.056,"Well, you're dealing with a very complicated, intricate statute as you know."
1990.90-693,1,19943,calvin_dee_rider,,2166.004,2184.674,"Mr. Chief Justice, our response is that there... the specific prohibition is not there, but there are other code provisions, specifically one I've cited in my brief, code section 706 that allows a one-time conversion from a chapter 7 to a 13."
1990.90-693,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2206.169,2209.901,"xxx 6(d), quoted on page 21 of your brief."
1990.90-693,1,19943,calvin_dee_rider,,2218.617,2219.548,"--Yes, that is correct."
1990.90-693,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2219.548,2227.503,And you say if you're not allowed to convert a fortiori you should not be able to start afresh in that section?
1990.90-693,1,19943,calvin_dee_rider,,2227.503,2234.629,"Congress contemplated a debtor moving into... filing a 7, if he can't... if there's nondischargeable debts, they can move on."
1990.90-693,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2253.652,2264.328,I don't under... are they two separate arguments?
1990.90-693,1,19943,calvin_dee_rider,,2264.328,2267.33,It's the same one.
1990.90-693,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2269.333,2279.549,He couldn't have been a debtor under chapter... under the other title... under chapter 13 within the meaning of 706(d) only because his debt would have been too high.
1990.90-693,1,19943,calvin_dee_rider,,2279.549,2280.36,That's... that is--
1990.90-693,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2280.36,2282.24,"There is no other reason he couldn't have been a debtor under that, right?"
1990.90-693,1,19943,calvin_dee_rider,,2282.24,2283.712,--Under the chapter 13.
1990.90-693,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2283.712,2283.902,Okay.
1990.90-693,1,19943,calvin_dee_rider,,2283.902,2284.483,That's correct.
1990.90-693,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2312.31,2319.656,"Mr. Rider, can I ask you... this may be an unrealistic hypothetical, but I'm trying to think this crazy case through."
1990.90-693,1,19943,calvin_dee_rider,,2352.528,2362.703,The father could still file a 13... can still... would still be able to schedule debts in a 13.
1990.90-693,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2374.35,2379.796,"Well, the... his right to payment would be strictly by selling the property and collecting the proceeds."
1990.90-693,1,19943,calvin_dee_rider,,2399.972,2402.145,Justice Stevens--
1990.90-693,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2402.145,2403.044,I guess your position is no?
1990.90-693,1,19943,calvin_dee_rider,,2403.044,2404.926,"--No, no, that... that is correct."
1990.90-693,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2576.713,2584.468,"Mr. Rider, what do you do about the provision that a claim against a debtor includes a claim against property of the debtor?"
1990.90-693,1,19943,calvin_dee_rider,,2586.78,2587.751,First--
1990.90-693,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2587.751,2589.652,"This is a claim against property of the debtor, right?"
1990.90-693,1,19943,calvin_dee_rider,,2589.652,2590.673,--This--
1990.90-693,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2590.673,2596.027,"And therefore, that seems to me... it seems by that paragraph 2 to be a claim against the debtor."
1990.90-693,1,19943,calvin_dee_rider,,2596.027,2604.114,"--It is our contention, Justice Scalia, this isn't a claim against property of the... of the debtor."
1990.90-693,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2619.813,2635.133,"Even though the claim... the claim need not be against the debtor, but the claim... the owner... the property in question must be the property of the debtor, but you're saying the... you must have a claim against somebody, even if not the debtor."
1990.90-693,1,19943,calvin_dee_rider,,2635.133,2642.98,--You must still... the strict language of the code talks about a claim against the debtor including a claim against property of the debtor.
1990.90-693,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2661.922,2667.597,Give me an example of where there is a claim against property of the debtor without a claim against the debtor.
1990.90-693,1,19943,calvin_dee_rider,,2667.597,2673.819,I believe in... you may have an example where a... for instance a farmer.
1990.90-693,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2719.602,2736.302,"Well, Mr. Gilman, in your answer when he pledges the property on a nonrecourse basis, he still couldn't realize against that property if he did not have the antecedent or the independent debt, right?"
1990.90-693,1,19943,calvin_dee_rider,,2737.922,2741.556,"I'm sorry, Justice Souter, I'm not sure--"
1990.90-693,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2741.556,2743.966,"No, I'm saying he gets a pledge of the property."
1990.90-693,1,19943,calvin_dee_rider,,2748.95,2751.071,--The--
1990.90-693,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2751.071,2752.762,If the... let me put it this way.
1990.90-693,1,19943,calvin_dee_rider,,2760.279,2760.809,--That's correct.
1990.90-693,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2760.809,2761.06,All right.
1990.90-693,1,19943,calvin_dee_rider,,2798.215,2804.841,I believe that is our position that we have the property interest to pursue against our collateral--
1990.90-693,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2804.841,2806.892,"And it's a property interest, pure and simple."
1990.90-693,1,19943,calvin_dee_rider,,2809.012,2810.203,--That's correct.
1990.90-693,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2810.203,2822.192,"Whereas in the pledge situation, it's not just a property interest, pure and simple, because the right to realize upon it is still dependent upon the relationship of debtor and creditor, which is independent of it."
1990.90-693,1,19943,calvin_dee_rider,,2822.192,2825.674,In the nonrecourse loan agreement?
1990.90-693,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2825.674,2825.845,Yes.
1990.90-693,1,19943,calvin_dee_rider,,2825.845,2826.834,"Yes, in that case."
1990.90-693,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2826.834,2827.014,Okay.
1990.90-693,1,19943,calvin_dee_rider,,2827.014,2846.267,"In this case, we do not... to further answer Justice Scalia's question, we do not have a right to payment, and in the second definition of claim... the right to an equitable remedy for breach of performance if such breach gives rise to a right to payment."
1990.90-693,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2899.737,2909.612,"Well, the amount of the bank's claim against the property, I take it, must always be calculated by reference to the antecedent debt."
1990.90-693,1,19943,calvin_dee_rider,,2919.979,2922.13,That is correct.
1990.90-693,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2922.13,2937.721,"And so it's somewhat artificial to say that the bank has simply a claim... or an interest in the property, because that interest must be defined by reference at least to an antecedent document."
1990.90-693,1,19943,calvin_dee_rider,,2937.721,2950.29,That's... we must look at the document to determine what was there even... but... even though all of that has been discharged and there's no personal liability on it.
1990.90-693,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2950.29,2955.543,Is it fair to... I'm sorry... I didn't want to interrupt your answer.
1990.90-693,1,19943,calvin_dee_rider,,2955.543,2981.139,"In this case what we're saying is that the claim... Congress, in this specific instance, limited the definition of claim in 101(4)(b), where Congress stated in the legislative history that rights to an equitable remedy for breach of performance with respect to which such breach does not give rise to a right to payment, are not claims."
1990.90-693,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2992.506,2996.108,May... may I just follow up on Justice Kennedy's question?
1990.90-693,1,19943,calvin_dee_rider,,3043.822,3046.413,"To... to an extent, Justice Souter."
1990.90-693,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3058.291,3061.834,"In fact, maybe that... maybe my question reflects a confusion."
1990.90-693,1,19943,calvin_dee_rider,,3074.924,3077.145,The value of the property?
1990.90-693,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3077.145,3088.361,"Yes, in chapter 7 does the... does the bankruptcy court in effect say, look, you own a piece of property... you own this property to the extent of $10,000."
1990.90-693,1,19943,calvin_dee_rider,,3091.092,3091.233,Yes.
1990.90-693,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3091.233,3097.157,So he knows the extent... the dollar amount at least... of his interest once chapter 7 is over.
1990.90-693,1,19943,calvin_dee_rider,,3097.157,3098.709,That is correct.
1990.90-693,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3098.709,3098.829,Okay.
1990.90-693,1,19943,calvin_dee_rider,,3098.829,3103.121,But then you move on to the chapter 13 and that value is determined again.
1990.90-693,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3103.121,3109.065,What happens to the equity of redemption in the chapter 7 proceeding?
1990.90-693,1,19943,calvin_dee_rider,,3109.065,3121.342,"In the chapter 7, if... if the... if the... if the debtor retains the property, Chief Justice... Mr. Chief Justice, then the debtor retains that right of redemption."
1990.90-693,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3137.505,3140.908,So he retains that after the conclusion of the chapter 7?
1990.90-693,1,19943,calvin_dee_rider,,3140.908,3143.7,--He still... even... this plan is set to conclude in less than a year.
1990.90-693,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3150.776,3154.038,"No, I asked you if he still had it at the conclusion of the chapter 7 proceeding."
1990.90-693,1,19943,calvin_dee_rider,,3157.241,3157.891,"Both, Your Honor."
1990.90-693,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3167.027,3169.498,But he does retain that after chapter 7?
1990.90-693,1,19943,calvin_dee_rider,,3169.498,3169.658,Yes.
1990.90-693,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3190.274,3192.304,It's a right to regain title to the property.
1990.90-693,1,19943,calvin_dee_rider,,3192.304,3192.465,--Exactly.
1990.90-693,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3213.269,3215.53,Can you help me with one other thing that I just really don't understand?
1990.90-693,1,19943,calvin_dee_rider,,3236.684,3242.558,"No, the bank... the... if I understand your question, the property is increasing in value?"
1990.90-693,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3242.558,3247.332,"No, the property... the... there's a $100,000 note secured by a property."
1990.90-693,1,19943,calvin_dee_rider,,3267.668,3275.922,"I... in that specific instance, Justice Stevens, that's something that I'm not exactly clear on."
1990.90-693,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3286.548,3290.512,Is there some kind of a dollar figure set on the value of the property in the chapter 7 proceeding?
1990.90-693,1,19943,calvin_dee_rider,,3290.512,3290.662,--Yes.
1990.90-693,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3290.662,3294.415,"And that's their... that's the extent of the in rem claim is that figure, then?"
1990.90-693,1,19943,calvin_dee_rider,,3294.415,3294.625,Yes.
1990.90-693,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3294.625,3297.258,"So if it produces more, we don't know what happens to the... to the--"
1990.90-693,1,19943,calvin_dee_rider,,3297.258,3298.599,That's right.
1990.90-693,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3298.599,3301.601,--They cannot recover against the property up to the full amount of their claim?
1990.90-693,1,19943,calvin_dee_rider,,3301.601,3302.622,"Oh, yes, yes, I'm sorry."
1990.90-693,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3303.113,3303.771,Up to the full amount of their claim.
1990.90-693,1,19943,calvin_dee_rider,,3303.771,3303.961,Yes.
1990.90-693,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3303.961,3310.485,"No matter what the property... you know, if it's sold 2 years later and it's gone up in the interim, they can get the full amount of their claim."
1990.90-693,1,19943,calvin_dee_rider,,3311.867,3313.627,The full... the full amount--
1990.90-693,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3313.627,3314.509,Of their claim.
1990.90-693,1,19943,calvin_dee_rider,,3314.509,3315.039,"--Yes, of their claim."
1990.90-693,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3315.44,3316.479,"No more than that, but up to there."
1990.90-693,1,19943,calvin_dee_rider,,3316.479,3316.96,That's correct.
1990.90-693,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3323.935,3329.619,"Well, I... in my hypothetical if you sell the property for 60, the bank gets the full 60."
1990.90-693,1,19943,calvin_dee_rider,,3332.832,3338.185,"If the value of their claim is... their allowed claim, yes."
1990.90-693,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3338.185,3345.311,"But the original value... the original in personam claim was worth $100,000 in my hypothetical, which has been discharged in the chapter 7 proceeding."
1990.90-693,1,19943,calvin_dee_rider,,3354.086,3367.363,"From what I... what I've discussed with Justice Scalia, the value... the value of their allowed... the bank is entitled to the value of their allowed claim."
1990.90-693,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3367.363,3369.076,In the original proceeding?
1990.90-693,1,19943,calvin_dee_rider,,3369.076,3369.336,Yes.
1990.90-693,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3369.336,3369.517,"Oh, okay."
1990.90-693,1,19943,calvin_dee_rider,,3376.884,3383.418,"Well, the... if that's the amount... the bank is allowed the... only the amount of their secured claim... their allowed secured claim."
1990.90-693,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3383.418,3388.682,"Well, supposing I have... supposing there's a note for $100,000 which I have given you."
1990.90-693,1,19943,calvin_dee_rider,,3396.558,3399.93,I'm sorry.
1990.90-693,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3402.321,3408.616,"Yes, I think both Justice Scalia, Justice Stevens, and I are trying to get an answer from you which seems to be very difficult to get out of you."
1990.90-693,1,19943,calvin_dee_rider,,3410.296,3410.897,I apologize for that.
1990.90-693,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3410.897,3418.193,"--The debtor has a... has a... has executed a note for $100,000."
1990.90-693,1,19943,calvin_dee_rider,,3440.871,3445.743,"No, in fact in this case, what was... our claim was much more."
1990.90-693,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3456.03,3460.804,"Well, did the amount for which it was allowed have anything to do with the value of the security?"
1990.90-693,1,19943,calvin_dee_rider,,3460.804,3463.876,"The... yes, it... yes, it did."
1990.90-693,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3468.309,3468.77,"Thank you, Mr. Rider."

1990.90-693,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3490.537,3492.718,And even though the in personam claim has been discharged?
1990.90-693,2,44835,w_thomas_gilman,,3492.718,3493.088,Right.
1990.90-693,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3540.399,3542.2,And the 10 would go back to the debtor?
1990.90-693,2,44835,w_thomas_gilman,,3542.2,3544.172,--The 10 would be equity for the unsecured creditors.
1990.90-693,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3544.172,3544.553,All right.
1990.90-693,2,44835,w_thomas_gilman,,3552.62,3554.711,The value of the mortgage.
1990.90-693,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3554.711,3557.223,"Well, okay... all right, the value of the mortgage."
1990.90-693,2,44835,w_thomas_gilman,,3557.223,3558.414,But--
1990.90-693,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3558.414,3564.617,"But then in your chapter 13 proceeding, you use the value of the property as you... as what you have to pay off over a period of time."
1990.90-693,2,44835,w_thomas_gilman,,3564.617,3569.46,--You use both the value of the property and the... and the amount of the mortgage.
