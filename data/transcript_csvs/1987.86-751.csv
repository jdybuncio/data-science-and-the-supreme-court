1987.86-751,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,55.901,"Mr. Hughes, you may proceed whenever you are ready."
1987.86-751,0,43609,vester_t_hughes_jr,,55.901,59.367,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1987.86-751,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,193.968,201.466,"You are not saying the Internal Revenue Service has always been consistent, are you?"
1987.86-751,0,43609,vester_t_hughes_jr,,201.466,204.402,"No, Justice Blackmun."
1987.86-751,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,222.535,228.658,"Now that I have you interrupted, am I correct in assuming the Tax Court decision here was not reviewed by the full Court?"
1987.86-751,0,43609,vester_t_hughes_jr,,228.658,230.188,It was reviewed by the full Court.
1987.86-751,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,230.188,230.423,It was?
1987.86-751,0,43609,vester_t_hughes_jr,,230.423,235.935,"It was a regular Tax Court decision, as contrasted with a memo decision."
1987.86-751,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,237.138,237.513,Yes.
1987.86-751,0,43609,vester_t_hughes_jr,,242.606,248.619,"My understanding, Justice Blackmun, is that it is not a memo decision."
1987.86-751,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,251.336,255.569,That is out of my line with my understanding of long standing.
1987.86-751,0,43609,vester_t_hughes_jr,,256.036,277.669,The Corn Products decision actually was a development in a much older line of thinking on the nature of a capital gain.
1987.86-751,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,635.68,638.461,That is Rev. Rule 58-40?
1987.86-751,0,43609,vester_t_hughes_jr,,638.461,642.881,"No, Your Honor, the Corn Products Decision."
1987.86-751,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,642.881,647.8,Did you cite 58-40 in your original Brief?
1987.86-751,0,43609,vester_t_hughes_jr,,647.8,650.519,"I believe we did, Your Honor."
1987.86-751,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,650.519,668.291,"It isn't in the Index, and hence, if you didn't, of course, then the Government doesn't have an opportunity to respond to it."
1987.86-751,0,43609,vester_t_hughes_jr,,670.963,675.977,I am certain that it was cited either in one of the Amicus Briefs or in our Brief.
1987.86-751,0,43609,vester_t_hughes_jr,,675.977,676.586,It's in the Reply Brief.
1987.86-751,0,43609,vester_t_hughes_jr,,676.852,678.882,In the Reply Brief.
1987.86-751,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,703.809,715.524,"Mr. Hughes, may I inquire about this particular case?"
1987.86-751,0,43609,vester_t_hughes_jr,,715.524,716.211,"Yes, Justice O'Connor?"
1987.86-751,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,716.211,729.612,I take it that the stock acquired after 1972 was listed or referred to in the financial records of the company as an investment.
1987.86-751,0,43609,vester_t_hughes_jr,,729.612,731.815,"Yes, Justice O'Connor."
1987.86-751,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,731.815,732.034,As an investment.
1987.86-751,0,43609,vester_t_hughes_jr,,732.034,737.61,"I think that in terms of where it fitted on the balance sheet, that that would inevitably be true."
1987.86-751,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,737.61,744.778,"What if the price of that stock had gone up, and it had been sold?"
1987.86-751,0,43609,vester_t_hughes_jr,,749.043,750.368,"Yes, Your Honor."
1987.86-751,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,754.774,760.678,"And the IRS would be in the position of saying no, it ought to be an ordinary gain, do you suppose?"
1987.86-751,0,43609,vester_t_hughes_jr,,760.678,764.724,It would be if it followed its rulings.
1987.86-751,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,764.724,766.066,As in Corn Products.
1987.86-751,0,43609,vester_t_hughes_jr,,766.066,774.844,"As in Corn Products, or as in Revenue Ruling 58-40 or as in Revenue Ruling 75-13."
1987.86-751,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,774.844,779.547,This is a bit of a twist.
1987.86-751,0,43609,vester_t_hughes_jr,,788.729,798.053,"And of course, the Internal Revenue Service did prevail in the Mansfield Journal case, where it was exactly the reverse of the situation."
1987.86-751,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,799.647,801.849,So it can cut two ways.
1987.86-751,0,43609,vester_t_hughes_jr,,801.849,803.599,"Yes, Justice O'Connor."
1987.86-751,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,803.599,812.75,Do you think this is of diminishing importance in light of the Tax Code changes and the withdrawal of capital gains treatment altogether?
1987.86-751,0,43609,vester_t_hughes_jr,,812.75,816.047,"I don't believe so, Your Honor, for two or three reasons."
1987.86-751,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1042.55,1047.329,Did that proposal that you last described pass the 30-day proposal?
1987.86-751,0,43609,vester_t_hughes_jr,,1047.329,1050.421,"No, Chief Justice, it did not."
1987.86-751,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1309.786,1315.595,Now you are getting down to it.
1987.86-751,0,43609,vester_t_hughes_jr,,1315.595,1316.892,"Justice White, I am down to it."
1987.86-751,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1473.235,1478.358,"Well, yes, you can, but the Government says that, so what?"
1987.86-751,0,43609,vester_t_hughes_jr,,1480.779,1484.793,"Justice White, that is what the Government says."
1987.86-751,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1490.823,1496.117,Your argument would be the same if there weren't any exceptions to the capital asset definition.
1987.86-751,0,43609,vester_t_hughes_jr,,1496.117,1511.173,"The argument is based, really, on the 1921 Act, yes, Justice White, the same way that the Court held in Burnet v. Harmel, and P.G. Lake."
1987.86-751,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1512.86,1516.906,"I take it your answer to me is well, Corn Products would have come out that way if there were no exceptions?"
1987.86-751,0,43609,vester_t_hughes_jr,,1516.906,1518.312,That's right.
1987.86-751,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1518.312,1535.554,"Mr. Hughes, it might not be totally unreasonable to take the position that assets acquired to preserve existing assets necessarily acquire the same characteristic as the assets sought to be preserved."
1987.86-751,0,43609,vester_t_hughes_jr,,1539.474,1558.061,"Certainly, Justice O'Connor, that is a concept not unknown in the law, but there was a specific finding here, unchallenged by the Eighth Circuit, unchallenged by the Government, that the purchase after 1972 was not to preserve another asset."
1987.86-751,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1576.678,1577.866,"Very well, Mr. Hughes."
1987.86-751,1,16165,allan_a_horowitz,,1579.677,1585.877,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1987.86-751,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1614.163,1620.207,This is just the stock purchased after 1971 that is at issue here?
1987.86-751,1,16165,allan_a_horowitz,,1620.207,1625.799,"Well, originally Petitioner took the view in the Tax Court that all the shares were ordinary--"
1987.86-751,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1625.799,1625.986,I know.
1987.86-751,1,16165,allan_a_horowitz,,1630.11,1630.36,--Right.
1987.86-751,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1635.889,1658.036,"Mr. Horowitz, it seems to me that until the 1986 changes to the Revenue Code, that it was often to the advantage of the IRS to adopt the very view that Petitioner does here, that we ought to preserve the Corn Products Doctrine and prevent things from being treated as capital gains."
1987.86-751,1,16165,allan_a_horowitz,,1675.778,1678.012,Let me give a couple of responses to that.
1987.86-751,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1703.268,1711.014,Do you think the IRS has been wholly consistent n its approach to the Corn Products Doctrine all these years?
1987.86-751,1,16165,allan_a_horowitz,,1716.2,1719.807,I would like to separate what is called the Corn Products Doctrine--
1987.86-751,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1719.807,1720.713,I don't blame you.
1987.86-751,1,16165,allan_a_horowitz,,1720.713,1725.821,--from what the Commissioner is relying on from the Corn Products Decision which we did argue for and which we continue to think is correct.
1987.86-751,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1751.514,1753.122,But the Court in Corn Products said this wasn't true hedging.
1987.86-751,1,16165,allan_a_horowitz,,1753.122,1755.449,The Court said it wasn't true hedging.
1987.86-751,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1882.491,1885.521,"One does get a little bit the feeling, though, of:"
1987.86-751,1,16165,allan_a_horowitz,,1892.144,1898.829,"Well, I think I just have to reiterate that this case is so far removed from anything that went on in Corn Products."
1987.86-751,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1901.875,1910.401,"And all the courts who have been following Corn Products, other than in hedging operations, have really misread the case."
1987.86-751,1,16165,allan_a_horowitz,,1910.401,1913.416,"That is absolutely right, starting with the Booth Newspapers case."
1987.86-751,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1913.416,1914.994,All of those Judges?
1987.86-751,1,16165,allan_a_horowitz,,1914.994,1918.008,All those courts have misread the case.
1987.86-751,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1932.705,1940.344,Congress has certainly had plenty of opportunity to disagree with all these courts and it has never disturbed--
1987.86-751,1,16165,allan_a_horowitz,,1940.344,1942.514,Congress has not done anything one way or the other.
1987.86-751,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1942.514,1948.136,"--Well, certainly some of those Courts of Appeals opinions rest on just as much as Corn Products did."
1987.86-751,1,16165,allan_a_horowitz,,1948.136,1954.54,"Well, I think I have to disagree with that, Mr. Chief Justice."
1987.86-751,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1967.863,1978.75,"Mr. Horowitz, haven't some of those Court of Appeals opinions gone in favor of the Government to deny a taxpayer capital gains treatment and have benefitted the Government in the past?"
1987.86-751,1,16165,allan_a_horowitz,,1978.75,1983.06,"Well, I actually never really finished answering the question before, Justice O'Connor."
1987.86-751,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2150.695,2165.159,"Mr. Horowitz, you explain the Revenue Rulings that seem to have accepted the what we'll call bad Corn Products, as opposed to good Corn Products, your narrower reading of it."
1987.86-751,1,16165,allan_a_horowitz,,2194.146,2210.546,"Well, in the litigation in this case from the start we asserted that the Windle case that is mentioned in the briefs, which is the Tax Court's version of the Corn Products doctrine is also a case where we argued the Corn Products Doctrine didn't exist."
1987.86-751,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2217.262,2218.996,When was that?
1987.86-751,1,16165,allan_a_horowitz,,2219.762,2221.761,1978?
1987.86-751,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2224.525,2229.273,Was that the first time you have really taken aim at Corn Products?
1987.86-751,1,16165,allan_a_horowitz,,2229.273,2230.038,I don't believe so.
1987.86-751,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2249.827,2253.607,Your position didn't prevail in all those cases?
1987.86-751,1,16165,allan_a_horowitz,,2253.607,2254.42,No.
1987.86-751,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2259.029,2261.621,Do you have any comments about Rev. Rule 58-40?
1987.86-751,1,16165,allan_a_horowitz,,2261.621,2268.322,I was about to say actually that Rev. Rule 58-40 might be something of an exception to what I've just said.
1987.86-751,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2346.712,2360.55,I take it we have had cases in the past where a regulation has approved a certain course of action and the Treasurer changes its mind and changes the regulation.
1987.86-751,1,16165,allan_a_horowitz,,2363.517,2365.72,I think we are doing quite a bit less than that.
1987.86-751,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2365.72,2366.142,Exactly.
1987.86-751,1,16165,allan_a_horowitz,,2366.142,2370.718,"We have been trying for a long time to get to the Supreme Court on this issue, and we are finally here."
1987.86-751,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2373.217,2389.257,"What would you say if you were asked do you think that adopting your position would upset some very subtle expectations of taxpayers, that they stand to lose a lot of money?"
1987.86-751,1,16165,allan_a_horowitz,,2389.257,2398.159,"Well, the Service, if the Government prevails in this case, the Service is going to have to figure out how to deal with that."
1987.86-751,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2400.627,2406.938,In this case I would suppose that they were going to buy this stock no matter what.
1987.86-751,1,16165,allan_a_horowitz,,2406.938,2415.153,"Well, yes, I was going to go on to say that this is not the sort of area where there is, I think a big expectations problem."
1987.86-751,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2438.393,2443.829,"But if we do what you say, we're just not going to affect just stock."
1987.86-751,1,16165,allan_a_horowitz,,2451.264,2456.292,"It does have application in some other areas, although stock has been in the main focus of the litigation."
1987.86-751,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2456.292,2459.557,What other areas?
1987.86-751,1,16165,allan_a_horowitz,,2461.415,2483.125,"Well, I know there is a ruling out there about transactions in foreign currency I think that the Treasury had treated it as the Corn Products Doctrine applying to that, although I think that has actually been, there is a special treatment for foreign currency now in the 1986 Act anyway."
1987.86-751,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2485.671,2503.054,"Mr. Horowitz, it seems to me that almost by definition, these transactions are ones in which if they are not made for an investment purpose but as in Booth or the other case, to secure an inventory or get some business objective accomplished, that it is probably not a wise investment and there is a probability of a loss."
1987.86-751,1,16165,allan_a_horowitz,,2516.376,2526.264,"If the business purpose is so predominant, then it seems to me you probably aren't worried about the tax, whether it's going to be a capital loss or not, either."
1987.86-751,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2526.264,2526.983,That's true.
1987.86-751,1,16165,allan_a_horowitz,,2526.983,2533.106,I think one of the problems with the Corn Products Doctrine is that you can't separate out the business and investment purpose so well.
1987.86-751,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2545.117,2547.974,"Yes, but that was before 1971."
1987.86-751,1,16165,allan_a_horowitz,,2547.974,2548.193,The two motives tend to coalesce.
1987.86-751,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2548.193,2550.005,"That was before 1971, wasn't it?"
1987.86-751,1,16165,allan_a_horowitz,,2550.005,2550.755,"Yes, that was before 1971."
1987.86-751,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2550.755,2553.691,They were only talking about those purchases made to protect their reputation.
1987.86-751,1,16165,allan_a_horowitz,,2553.691,2565.874,"Well, again, we discussed in our Brief that I don't really accept the characterization that the Tax Court made this finding that that was the only purpose of purchasing the stock."
1987.86-751,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2589.255,2605.578,"The Government contends then that Corn Products, the holding of Corn Products means that buying futures by a company in the business that Corn Products was in, it applies to that situation but not to any others."
1987.86-751,1,16165,allan_a_horowitz,,2606.967,2607.826,That is correct.
1987.86-751,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2607.826,2615.823,"In other words, the only way stock can be treated as ordinary income, a gain or loss, is if you are a dealer?"
1987.86-751,1,16165,allan_a_horowitz,,2615.823,2616.854,"If you are a dealer, that's right."
1987.86-751,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2630.021,2637.424,"And to whatever extent the Treasury has departed from that basic proposition in the past, it has now changed its mind?"
1987.86-751,1,16165,allan_a_horowitz,,2637.424,2640.438,--Well--
1987.86-751,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2640.438,2640.704,Yes.
1987.86-751,1,16165,allan_a_horowitz,,2640.704,2641.501,--Okay.
1987.86-751,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2647.685,2650.029,"To the extent you have, you shouldn't be stuck with it."
1987.86-751,1,16165,allan_a_horowitz,,2651.339,2654.573,"--Yes, we've changed our mind."
1987.86-751,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2662.196,2663.976,And the Devil made you do it.
1987.86-751,1,16165,allan_a_horowitz,,2663.976,2666.991,The Courts of Appeals made us do it.
1987.86-751,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2666.991,2677.111,"Mr. Horowitz, straighten me out on my technical question."
1987.86-751,1,16165,allan_a_horowitz,,2680.625,2681.515,"No, it was not."
1987.86-751,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2681.515,2682.374,I didn't think it was.
1987.86-751,1,16165,allan_a_horowitz,,2682.702,2698.697,"Despite Petitioner's avoidance of it in this Brief, there is a statute that addresses this issue, at Section 1221 of the Internal Revenue Code, and I would like to focus on it a little bit, because we do think it controls this case."
1987.86-751,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2719.172,2722.42,Is there any disagreement about that at all?
1987.86-751,1,16165,allan_a_horowitz,,2722.42,2733.51,"I didn't think there was, although Mr. Hughes, I thought, suggested that maybe they were holding this National Bank of Commerce stock for sale to customers, because they eventually ended up having to sell it."
1987.86-751,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2789.723,2792.798,What exception in the statute was it that Corn Products came under?
1987.86-751,1,16165,allan_a_horowitz,,2792.798,2793.735,Section 1.
1987.86-751,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2802.529,2805.042,And the futures were other property of a kind?
1987.86-751,1,16165,allan_a_horowitz,,2805.042,2806.027,"Yes, that's correct."
1987.86-751,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2829.409,2832.892,"Those were quieter days, 1955."
1987.86-751,1,16165,allan_a_horowitz,,2840.093,2845.106,"I guess that is right, Justice Scalia, because I'm not sure even they needed to say they were departing from the literal language of the statute."
1987.86-751,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2853.18,2859.99,Can I go back to Corn Products for a second?
1987.86-751,1,16165,allan_a_horowitz,,2880.233,2882.653,"As I said, it is not a very clear Opinion."
1987.86-751,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2884.591,2884.888,Yes.
1987.86-751,1,16165,allan_a_horowitz,,2884.888,2887.481,The Second Circuit placed it under Number 1.
1987.86-751,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2901.677,2906.409,But Justice Clarke said it was really a form of insurance.
1987.86-751,1,16165,allan_a_horowitz,,2906.409,2909.502,That is what the General Counsel memorandum said also.
1987.86-751,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3028.173,3033.672,"Unfortunately for your case, it is subsequent to 1955."
1987.86-751,1,16165,allan_a_horowitz,,3035.639,3040.871,I don't understand Petitioner's argument to be that Corn Products changed the law.
1987.86-751,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3042.184,3056.788,"No, but if Congress had adopted one of these exceptions after Corn Products, you could argue that evidently Congress didn't think that Corn Products said what your opponent claims it says because then the new exception would have been unnecessary."
1987.86-751,1,16165,allan_a_horowitz,,3060.147,3065.113,"I don't dispute that fact, that they are pre-1955, but I don't think it really undermines our argument."
1987.86-751,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3077.842,3092.352,"It doesn't undermine that part of your argument, but it does not enable you to use any of the exceptions for the proposition that Congress has not acquiesced in effect, in Corn Products, seen it and said it was good."
1987.86-751,1,16165,allan_a_horowitz,,3092.352,3096.054,"Congress has not said anything about Corn Products, one way or the other."
1987.86-751,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3237.2,3264.519,"Mr. Horowitz, I take it you are arguing here that the statute is so clear that the Treasury would never be permitted to again issue some of the Revenue Rulings that it has, that any departure, anything outside a narrow reading of Corn Products is just forbidden by the statute."
1987.86-751,1,16165,allan_a_horowitz,,3271.842,3272.061,I agree.
1987.86-751,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3276.59,3289.476,But of course you could win if we just said this is a permissible construction of the statute that Treasury can follow.
1987.86-751,1,16165,allan_a_horowitz,,3289.476,3295.489,"Well, I suppose so, although that is not what we are arguing."
1987.86-751,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3297.394,3297.613,Yes.
1987.86-751,1,16165,allan_a_horowitz,,3297.613,3314.309,"I really view this whole case as kind of ironic, because I know the Court, this Court and other courts are often grappling, trying to define terms in the Internal Revenue Code and trying to define policies behind them and wondering why the Code doesn't, why Congress doesn't just define the term for it, and here that is exactly what they have done."
1987.86-751,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3314.309,3330.678,"Mr. Horowitz, you know, if you are right, that the statute as written governs, it is awfully hard to fit even Corn Products' so-called inventory exception with that, because those futures weren't inventory."
1987.86-751,1,16165,allan_a_horowitz,,3343.205,3350.092,I guess there you are just talking about sort of a narrow versus a broad interpretation of the statute.
1987.86-751,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3408.444,3409.724,"Thank you, Mr. Horowitz."
1987.86-751,2,43609,vester_t_hughes_jr,,3412.113,3414.035,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1987.86-751,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3440.993,3448.192,"Mr. Hughes, do you think your taxpayer fits within the language of the statute somehow?"
1987.86-751,2,43609,vester_t_hughes_jr,,3448.192,3469.152,"Justice O'Connor, there are two ways that this could be approached, and I think that either way gets us to the correct answer for the purpose of tax administration, as it should be interpreted and applied."
1987.86-751,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3648.534,3654.344,"Why do they make all those exceptions then, if all of those exceptions would automatically be--"
1987.86-751,2,43609,vester_t_hughes_jr,,3654.344,3660.203,"Justice Scalia, I don't think they would have automatically been taken out."
1987.86-751,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3675.852,3684.942,"--That's fine, but then why do they have to say, except, it does not include one, two, three four, and some of those exceptions are not '55, but the latest was what, '54."
1987.86-751,2,43609,vester_t_hughes_jr,,3684.942,3691.048,There is no doubt about it that it could have been done a different way.
1987.86-751,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3693.704,3695.157,It's not that it could have been done a different way.
1987.86-751,2,43609,vester_t_hughes_jr,,3706.761,3713.508,"--There is no doubt about it, that Corn Products suffers from that difficulty of analysis."
1987.86-751,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3740.904,3742.466,"Thank you, Mr. Hughes."
