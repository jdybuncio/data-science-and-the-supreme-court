1986.86-98,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.685,"We will hear arguments next in No. 86-98, Gregory L. Rivera versus Jean Marie Minnich."
1986.86-98,0,44212,william_watt_campbell,,49.199,65.286,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the issue in this case is whether a man can be determined to be the father of an illegitimate child with the associated stigma and impact on himself and his family by the same quality of proof as is used in the ordinary civil case."
1986.86-98,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,199.341,202.903,"What do the four D's stand for, Mr. Campbell?"
1986.86-98,0,44212,william_watt_campbell,,202.903,215.788,"Chief Justice Rehnquist, the 4D program is the popular name for the provision of the Social Security Act through which the Federal Government funds the child support enforcement programs in the 50 states."
1986.86-98,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,215.788,218.74,"Oh, it refers to a section of the statute?"
1986.86-98,0,44212,william_watt_campbell,,218.74,221.615,"It is a title of the statute, Chief Justice Rehnquist."
1986.86-98,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,221.615,222.082,It is not like 4R?
1986.86-98,0,44212,william_watt_campbell,,222.082,223.207,No.
1986.86-98,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,304.347,306.486,You don't really... you are putting it too strongly.
1986.86-98,0,44212,william_watt_campbell,,331.803,335.114,"--Justice Scalia, I would respectfully disagree with that."
1986.86-98,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,352.967,358.918,Can society enforce that upon him except financially?
1986.86-98,0,44212,william_watt_campbell,,358.918,372.288,"Justice Scalia, it is correct that a lot of those expectations cannot be enforced, but legally enforceable expectations aren't the only considerations that have been taken into account."
1986.86-98,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,482.993,487.819,"Now, as far as the child is concerned I don't know how this cuts either way."
1986.86-98,0,44212,william_watt_campbell,,494.879,495.847,"Yes, I do."
1986.86-98,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,495.847,505.484,"That means that unless you prove beyond a mere preponderance that this individual is the father, although he may be the father, you come out with a verdict by a Court that he is not the father, right?"
1986.86-98,0,44212,william_watt_campbell,,505.484,507.748,It is true--
1986.86-98,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,507.748,512.511,"Even though he is and you know, if you went on a preponderance he would have been found to be."
1986.86-98,0,44212,william_watt_campbell,,512.511,521.664,"--It is true that there are risks of error in either direction, but a child will be harmed by an erroneous... a child will be harmed either way, but when--"
1986.86-98,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,521.664,524.179,The risk is greater when you require more of a preponderance.
1986.86-98,0,44212,william_watt_campbell,,524.179,538.314,--The kind of evidence the plaintiff must use to prove their case calls for an increased burden of proof in order to instruct the factfinder to proceed more cautiously so that we may have more confidence in the decision.
1986.86-98,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,551.48,554.245,It doesn't tell the factfinder to proceed more cautiously.
1986.86-98,0,44212,william_watt_campbell,,562.757,564.757,"Absolutely not, Justice Scalia."
1986.86-98,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,646.739,657.876,"Is the blood test evidence that you have just described, is that admissible no matter how little probative it may be of the defendant's paternity?"
1986.86-98,0,44212,william_watt_campbell,,663.559,665.966,"--No, Chief Justice Rehnquist."
1986.86-98,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,675.68,685.333,"I would think you would be... on reasonable doubt standard if it is... 19 to 1, you say?"
1986.86-98,0,44212,william_watt_campbell,,685.333,686.879,"Eighteen to one, that's right."
1986.86-98,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,686.879,687.567,Eighteen to one.
1986.86-98,0,44212,william_watt_campbell,,687.567,701.89,"Well, the reason I have not asked for the beyond the reasonable doubt standard, I think there is some language in Addington versus Texas which would explain why it would not be appropriate for me to do that because of the use of scientific evidence."
1986.86-98,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,701.89,713.088,"So should the jury be told that under your standard clear and convincing, and that means that proof that it is 18 to 1 that he is the father isn't good enough?"
1986.86-98,0,44212,william_watt_campbell,,713.088,725.052,"Well, all the probability, all the probability results do is supposedly help the jury consider the rest of the evidence."
1986.86-98,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,736.079,737.391,What did the blood test show?
1986.86-98,0,44212,william_watt_campbell,,737.391,741.718,--The blood tests results were expressed in two fashions.
1986.86-98,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,741.718,743.139,I may not have... go ahead.
1986.86-98,0,44212,william_watt_campbell,,743.139,746.824,An 18 to 1 odds that he was the father.
1986.86-98,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,746.824,747.84,That he was the father.
1986.86-98,0,44212,william_watt_campbell,,747.84,748.106,Right.
1986.86-98,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,748.106,748.918,One chance out of 18?
1986.86-98,0,44212,william_watt_campbell,,750.089,750.635,One out of 19.
1986.86-98,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,767.145,770.596,"--Yes, but the odds were 18 to one that he was the father?"
1986.86-98,0,44212,william_watt_campbell,,770.596,772.721,Eighteen to one....
1986.86-98,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,772.721,773.923,That he was the father.
1986.86-98,0,44212,william_watt_campbell,,773.923,779.797,"Not that he was the father, but that a person with his blood characteristics was the father."
1986.86-98,1,35523,mary_louise_barton,,1008.954,1025.511,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the interest of the states in family matters has well been respected by the court in both theory and precedent."
1986.86-98,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1037.24,1038.568,"How many states, Ms. Barton?"
1986.86-98,1,35523,mary_louise_barton,,1038.568,1040.488,"Forty-one, Mr. Chief Justice."
1986.86-98,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1482.0,1493.027,"In this 18 to 1 and 19 to 1 findings, is that considered a high probability as these things run, or medium, or what?"
1986.86-98,1,35523,mary_louise_barton,,1493.027,1496.166,"Your Honor, I hesitate to answer that question."
1986.86-98,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1666.536,1680.547,"In the vast majority of cases as a practical matter what you are talking about is shifting the risk from the man to the state, no?"
1986.86-98,1,35523,mary_louise_barton,,1687.871,1689.574,That's correct.
1986.86-98,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1689.574,1691.291,Isn't that generally what is going on?
1986.86-98,1,35523,mary_louise_barton,,1691.291,1712.846,"Justice Scalia, in my... if I understand it correctly, when the fundamental liberty interests, of course, are at stake then it is a private party versus the state and then, of course, in all fairness the risk should be shifted more towards the state so that an individual cannot be deprived of what is a fundamental liberty interest."
1986.86-98,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1719.843,1722.515,You did mistake my question.
1986.86-98,1,35523,mary_louise_barton,,1731.167,1733.04,"I am sorry, I did misunderstand your question."
1986.86-98,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1744.177,1751.769,And what percentage of these cases in your experience involve that situation where the real party in interest is the state?
1986.86-98,1,35523,mary_louise_barton,,1751.769,1759.968,Since I only get involved in those interests where the state is involved I can't answer that question fairly.
1986.86-98,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1759.968,1761.232,"Probably the vast majority of them, though, isn't it?"
1986.86-98,1,35523,mary_louise_barton,,1761.232,1771.353,"I believe that's correct, because I believe the women, the mothers that are not on welfare are then of the next socioeconomic level where they cannot afford to have an attorney."
1986.86-98,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1780.568,1793.47,Do you think these blood tests showed that the odds were 18 to 1 that this particular person was the parent?
1986.86-98,1,35523,mary_louise_barton,,1798.53,1801.794,I believe--
1986.86-98,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1801.794,1812.68,"You have said the blood test reduces the risk of error terrifically and it does... if they exclude him, why, he is excluded."
1986.86-98,1,35523,mary_louise_barton,,1826.565,1828.753,--If the odds would be 18 to 1?
1986.86-98,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1828.753,1829.627,"Well, were they?"
1986.86-98,1,35523,mary_louise_barton,,1832.109,1834.016,"I believe they did, Your Honor."
1986.86-98,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1840.748,1841.294,I should say--
1986.86-98,1,35523,mary_louise_barton,,1841.294,1847.963,"--Yes, and if only one person had access, and that person happened to be a person with an 18 to 1 probability of paternity--"
1986.86-98,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1847.963,1849.93,--That is the only direct evidence there was here anyway.
1986.86-98,1,35523,mary_louise_barton,,1849.93,1851.368,"--Well, that's correct."
1986.86-98,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1860.114,1861.91,We are not passing on that.
1986.86-98,1,35523,mary_louise_barton,,1874.749,1901.222,"In all honesty I understand that that is how it is done, and as I tried to explain earlier, I believe the statistical tables that are used at this time when it comes to parents of two different nationalities are not as highly refined as they may be once more of these kind of relationships come forward and we are able to do statistical tables based on more of these kind of relationships as far as genetic markers go, Your Honor."
1986.86-98,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1901.222,1904.878,I didn't understand that that is how the 18 to 1 works.
1986.86-98,1,35523,mary_louise_barton,,1921.09,1924.104,"Well, really, in all fairness, I--"
1986.86-98,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1924.104,1928.197,That is something quite different from saying that the odds are 18 to 1 that this was the father.
1986.86-98,1,35523,mary_louise_barton,,1928.197,1935.536,"--To me what you have said would be the same as 18 to 1, but that is why I was not a mathematics major in college."
1986.86-98,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1936.645,1940.129,I am not sure it has anything to do with math.
1986.86-98,1,35523,mary_louise_barton,,1965.071,1989.451,"No, that would be correct, but you know, in my brief I have cited several forensic medical articles that deal with HLAs and how the statistical... it is all based on Mendel's theory of probability and Mendel's theory of genetics, and in those articles it is much better explained by medical people who know what they are talking about and in all honesty when it comes to these statistical theories I am not the person to ask."
1986.86-98,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1989.451,1999.573,"If you are right about that, doesn't it mean, I mean a clear and convincing standard surely doesn't require 18 to 1 odds?"
1986.86-98,1,35523,mary_louise_barton,,2007.679,2023.877,"Well, Justice Stevens, I believe that it does because I believe that when you go into a suit just because one side has better evidence or more evidence than another, we don't automatically raise the ante on them, and that is what you would be doing here."
1986.86-98,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2028.811,2038.589,"No, you would be saying if you are going to win anyway once you have told the child that we had a trial on this father, we didn't... we don't think there is just a 51 percent chance this is your father."
1986.86-98,1,35523,mary_louise_barton,,2041.385,2045.132,"--Well, I believe that one could say that."
1986.86-98,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2056.768,2056.987,I understand.
1986.86-98,1,35523,mary_louise_barton,,2063.219,2063.891,Absolutely.
1986.86-98,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2063.891,2069.06,"Well, you have to, because blood test evidence is just not that strong."
1986.86-98,1,35523,mary_louise_barton,,2081.946,2082.54,Yes.
1986.86-98,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2167.411,2169.738,"Ms. Barton, I probably shouldn't interrupt you because I have another mathematical question."
1986.86-98,1,35523,mary_louise_barton,,2186.794,2190.73,"--Correct, but I also want the decision to be fair in as many cases as possible."
1986.86-98,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2190.73,2193.276,That is not the right response.
1986.86-98,1,35523,mary_louise_barton,,2208.957,2227.669,"And if I may borrow a quote from one of this Court's cases, if you would shift the risk to the child, all it would accomplish would be to visit the condemnation of the parents' irresponsible liaison upon the child."
1986.86-98,2,44212,william_watt_campbell,,2421.015,2423.436,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1986.86-98,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2498.78,2503.217,"Of course, you are at 94.6, so you are fairly close to 95."
1986.86-98,2,44212,william_watt_campbell,,2503.217,2534.625,"That's right, but in this case, just another example of why there is tough evidence in this case, in this case I tried to show that Gregg's, my client's brother, had opportunity and access to have sex... this was one of the contentions we were trying to show... that he had sex with her, so he could be the father, and as indicated in the reporter cases and could have been in this case, blood test results don't mean anything else if somebody else had sex with the woman who was related."
1986.86-98,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2534.625,2535.843,Aren't you arguing to a jury now?
1986.86-98,2,44212,william_watt_campbell,,2535.843,2536.484,Excuse me?
1986.86-98,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2536.484,2537.983,Aren't you making a jury argument?
1986.86-98,2,44212,william_watt_campbell,,2539.671,2542.747,"Yes, the jury rejected it but--"
1986.86-98,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2542.747,2546.308,All of what you are telling us was argued to the jury.
1986.86-98,2,44212,william_watt_campbell,,2546.308,2549.025,"--That's right, and by a preponderance--"
1986.86-98,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2549.025,2549.432,0 xxx.
1986.86-98,2,44212,william_watt_campbell,,2549.432,2550.9,--That's correct.
1986.86-98,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2556.101,2557.257,You still think you are right.
1986.86-98,2,44212,william_watt_campbell,,2557.257,2559.319,"--I am sorry, Justice Marshall?"
1986.86-98,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2559.319,2560.022,You still think you are right.
1986.86-98,2,44212,william_watt_campbell,,2560.022,2562.442,"That is why I am here, Justice Marshall."
1986.86-98,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2588.12,2590.29,"Thank you, Mr. Campbell."
