1986.85-494,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,11.706,"We will hear arguments first this morning No. 85-494, California Federal Savings and Loan Association versus Mark Guerra."
1986.85-494,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,14.624,17.193,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1986.85-494,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,204.849,223.495,"Well, Mr. Olson, I guess in theory, an employer could comply with the California state law by offering female employees the pregnancy leave, and comply with Title VII by offering comparable leave to other disabled employees."
1986.85-494,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,231.583,233.452,It is in theory one way to approach it.
1986.85-494,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,261.435,263.804,How would you do that?
1986.85-494,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,263.804,268.958,How would... you would do it by adopting a leave policy that would guarantee reinstatement to work.
1986.85-494,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,268.958,271.041,"Well, I know, but how about the four months?"
1986.85-494,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,271.041,273.343,"Up to four months, the statute--"
1986.85-494,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,273.343,275.612,"I mean, just any disability up to four months?"
1986.85-494,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,275.612,290.455,"--The thrust of Justice O'Connor's question, and the argument that has been presented by some of the participants in this litigation, is that there isn't tension between Title VII and the California statute because the California statute mandates treatment for pregnancy in a certain way."
1986.85-494,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,298.226,304.299,"Mr. Olson, is it quite fair to Justice O'Connor's question to say, for all disabilities, or for all comparable disabilities?"
1986.85-494,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,304.299,320.641,"--All disabilities... well, it would have... any... as I understand the thrust of Title VII, as amended by the Pregnancy Disability Act, it requires that all disabilities be treated the same based upon comparableness in terms of the ability or inability to work."
1986.85-494,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,326.812,328.847,"Well, if it would take you off for a week."
1986.85-494,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,332.366,332.982,--Of course.
1986.85-494,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,367.389,370.507,"Isn't the benefit here the one, the right to return to work?"
1986.85-494,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,370.507,371.091,Yes.
1986.85-494,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,371.091,371.957,That is what is involved in this?
1986.85-494,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,371.957,372.359,Yes.
1986.85-494,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,388.452,389.569,I don't want to have any words with you.
1986.85-494,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,392.787,394.356,That's correct.
1986.85-494,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,394.356,396.523,And I don't think you've discussed that.
1986.85-494,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,396.523,402.794,The thrust of the requirement of the California statute is that the job remain open.
1986.85-494,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,444.121,446.055,"Well, does it?"
1986.85-494,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,457.846,486.865,"--As I read the statute, Justice O'Connor, and as I have read the legislative history, in the context in which this statute was passed, and as this Court has repeatedly suggested, we must start with the words of the statute themselves, and give them the meaning... or that the words would ordinarily be susceptible to: Women affected by pregnancy shall be treated the same for all employment-related purposes as other persons not so affected, but similar in their ability and inability to work."
1986.85-494,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,486.865,488.9,That may be a remedial provision.
1986.85-494,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,506.529,510.814,"Well, I suppose we wouldn't be here unless there was some debate on the other side of that question."
1986.85-494,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,573.471,580.577,"Well, I think to be more specific, it was passed in response to this Court's opinion in Gilbert."
1986.85-494,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,580.577,582.627,--There's no question that it was--
1986.85-494,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,582.627,589.516,"I mean, that was the immediate cause of the passage of this act, as I understand it."
1986.85-494,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,589.516,590.983,--That was the immediate cause of it.
1986.85-494,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,693.981,712.109,"Mr. Olson, supposing that this Court were to affirm to the California judgment and say that your employer, your client, had to treat all of its leave policies the same way that it treats the pregnancies which are required to be treated under California law."
1986.85-494,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,717.497,733.208,"The concrete situation... and I alluded to this in response to Justice O'Connor's initial question, is that it would require the change of Cal Fed's... the addition of Cal Fed's policy, and all other employees of the State of California, with respect to every disability, their leave policy."
1986.85-494,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,733.208,735.158,"Well, how specifically, would it work?"
1986.85-494,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,735.158,747.182,It would have to be charged to guarantee the right of reinstatement in the same way that that's guaranteed by the State of California and as set forth in their policy as interpreted by the agency interpreting it.
1986.85-494,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,747.182,756.622,In what situations new where a person takes leave because of illness or disability is it common not to allow the person to go back to the job?
1986.85-494,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,756.622,762.323,"Well, employers policies vary, as you might understand, all across the lot."
1986.85-494,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,813.724,818.076,What is California Federal's policy?
1986.85-494,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,818.076,834.752,"--California Federal's policy, which is set forth on the Joint Appendix at page 40, is to provide reasonable leave for employees for pregnancy or for other disabilities or for personal leave up to six months, on the basis of the needs of the individual employee."
1986.85-494,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,855.832,869.009,"And also I suppose that if you can imagine an employer without any disability leave policy, in order to comply with both California and the federal law they would have to adopt one."
1986.85-494,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,869.009,871.377,They would have to adopt a California policy.
1986.85-494,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,928.396,931.165,"Mr. Olson, let me just ask you a question about that example again."
1986.85-494,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,941.204,943.339,"--Well, that's theoretically correct."
1986.85-494,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,946.941,955.631,"But under the California statute, if we didn't have Title VII, there might be no job; and you'd still have to make one available, wouldn't you?"
1986.85-494,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,957.666,961.851,With the limitations that are built into the statute from a standpoint--
1986.85-494,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,961.851,962.718,--But it's the same problem.
1986.85-494,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,965.77,997.955,"Well, I think the practical effect of that, Justice Stevens, is that these situations in the real world, and we're talking about thousands of employers and large workforces and so forth, are going to differ when one statute... the whole California mechanism for enforcement, to bring actions and provide penalties and so forth, requires that you treat the pregnant employee a certain way, and the employer is deciding to voluntarily give certain rights to other employees, it should be--"
1986.85-494,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,997.955,1011.532,"No, but your hypothesis... under your hypothesis, I think you're assuming that the federal statute applies and requires equal treatment, requires that the male who has just had a bypass operation coming back at the same time as a female who just had a child must be treated alike."
1986.85-494,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1015.417,1018.269,"--Well, it would create practical problems, because you would have--"
1986.85-494,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1018.269,1020.305,"Well, Title VII created a lot of practical problems."
1986.85-494,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1020.305,1025.208,"--California would have the responsibility to enforce the federal law, as it does, as well as the state law."
1986.85-494,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1035.997,1038.598,"Well, the statute doesn't require that they be treated as a favored class."
1986.85-494,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1049.657,1051.359,--I think that if... let's suppose--
1986.85-494,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1051.359,1052.059,Would that be preempted?
1986.85-494,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1052.059,1068.984,"--let's take that example, that the State of California decided that people of Asian background be, for whatever reasons the California legislature might select, should have a different minimum wage, a higher minimum wage than presently prevails in California."
1986.85-494,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1096.754,1100.54,"Mr. Olson, that may well be unlawful, but not unlawful under Title VII."
1986.85-494,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1125.721,1143.033,"--Title... well, Section 708 of Title VII in fact suggests, states, that employers are exempt from requirements imposed by the state of... by the states, if the state permits or requires an unlawful employment practice."
1986.85-494,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1148.668,1150.853,--But not differently.
1986.85-494,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1150.853,1164.029,"--When the full force, I submit, of the State of California comes out and selects a group on what has been determined in Title VII by the national legislature to be an impermissible basis for classification, then they're selecting--"
1986.85-494,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1164.029,1165.062,By employers.
1986.85-494,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1178.789,1201.119,"--I submit, Justice Scalia, that Section 704... it isn't a leap, that Section 704 of Title VII, and Section 1104 of Title XI specifically make that link, that what is happening here is the State of California is authorizing or permitting employers to provide specific benefits to one class of individuals."
1986.85-494,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1202.103,1204.32,"--I thought you were going to say, special benefits."
1986.85-494,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1218.164,1231.972,"--We submit that when a state government selects out a class of individuals and determines that those individuals shall have certain benefits, and sets up an enforcement mechanism for that purpose, that that is special treatment."
1986.85-494,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1231.972,1244.196,"But Mr. Olson, the statute in California does not prevent an employer from extending benefits to other employees on a similar basis, and in comparable situations, does it?"
1986.85-494,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1244.196,1245.481,"No, it does not."
1986.85-494,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1301.751,1304.52,xxx--
1986.85-494,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1304.52,1305.686,--I agree with that.
1986.85-494,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1307.222,1326.117,"--Well, Mr. Olson, could California pass a general law that says, if an employer is going to have a disability policy, or indeed, it passes a law and says, all employers shall have a disability plan which shall be as follows."
1986.85-494,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1331.02,1335.622,"--Yes, unless I missed some element of your question, I believe that California definitely could do that."
1986.85-494,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1335.622,1344.661,"So that if you win this case, California could just say, well, we're going to extend these disability provisions that we have said apply to pregnancy to everyone?"
1986.85-494,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1344.661,1356.036,"Yes, exactly, and that bill, AB 3340, was in fact introduced, and was pending before the California legislature, and the California legislature adjourned this year without its passage."
1986.85-494,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1373.747,1378.651,"Well, it could be that... it could be Congress doesn't pass it because they don't think it's necessary."
1986.85-494,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1380.284,1383.12,"--That could be the case, Justice White."
1986.85-494,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1383.12,1388.007,And that all you have to do is comply with both statutes.
1986.85-494,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1388.007,1390.892,That could be the basis for what is happening in Congress.
1986.85-494,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1439.975,1450.514,"Well, is it clear from the legislative history that employers would not have to adopt a pregnancy leave policy?"
1986.85-494,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1450.514,1454.049,--It is clear to me from the legislative history that that is exactly what--
1986.85-494,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1454.049,1458.268,Employers would be perfectly free not to have any disability?
1986.85-494,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1458.268,1471.344,"--Yes, those... the same question, in virtually those same words, was asked and answered in various different ways during the hearings, in the committee reports, and in various different ways."
1986.85-494,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1516.29,1519.659,But this wouldn't be a judicial extension.
1986.85-494,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1523.877,1529.431,"I suspect that's why the state of... the United States in its brief called it, an extension, an end run."
1986.85-494,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1569.775,1586.819,"Well, Mr. Olson, I suppose, though, that whenever state law and federal law operate in the same field, as under a scheme like this, where Congress has said states may legislate, the result of the combination may be one that isn't entirely intended by either the state or Congress."
1986.85-494,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1589.838,1603.829,"--Well, all of the examples that I have read, and to the extent that there has ever been an outcome... to the extent that I've been able to find one... in this Court which would come to that conclusion, would be a very narrow extension under very narrow circumstances."
1986.85-494,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1652.579,1653.579,"Thank you, Mr. Olson."
1986.85-494,1,36075,marian_m_johnston,,1657.232,1661.767,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1986.85-494,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1762.8,1770.87,But it is something that the petitioner doesn't provide for in its plan.
1986.85-494,1,36075,marian_m_johnston,,1770.87,1771.42,--That's correct.
1986.85-494,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1771.906,1778.476,"So to comply, the petitioner will certainly have to change its leave policy."
1986.85-494,1,36075,marian_m_johnston,,1778.476,1780.21,"--Well, that's not necessarily true, Your Honor."
1986.85-494,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1796.354,1797.904,"But on its face, petitioners'--"
1986.85-494,1,36075,marian_m_johnston,,1797.904,1798.556,On its face--
1986.85-494,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1798.556,1801.341,--disability leave policy does not provide for it.
1986.85-494,1,36075,marian_m_johnston,,1801.341,1811.197,--Except that the state statute does permit employers not to return pregnant employees to work if there are sufficient business reasons that make it truly impossible not to keep that job open.
1986.85-494,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1818.368,1827.306,Did you raise any question in the action of the District Court as to whether the District Court should have gone ahead with the proceedings if there was something pending before the California Commission?
1986.85-494,1,36075,marian_m_johnston,,1827.306,1828.325,"Initially we did, Your Honor."
1986.85-494,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1873.053,1883.21,"Ms. Johnston, can you help me because I really didn't have this point well in mind before, where do I find in the papers the text of the California statutory provision that allows the business justification defense?"
1986.85-494,1,36075,marian_m_johnston,,1883.21,1888.429,--It's in the Joint Appendix at page 50.
1986.85-494,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1888.429,1891.881,Thank you.
1986.85-494,1,36075,marian_m_johnston,,1891.881,1901.07,"Now, since this is a Title VII preemption question, I think the Court understands that Title VII has a very limited preemptive effect upon state laws."
1986.85-494,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1976.701,1993.912,"Well, if you insert the word ""pregnancy"" in the statute, I suppose the federal act would then say that women affected by pregnancy shall be treated the same as other persons not so affected but similar in their ability or inability to work."
1986.85-494,1,36075,marian_m_johnston,,1993.912,1994.781,"That's correct, but--"
1986.85-494,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1994.781,2004.303,"And of course, their argument, then, is that would require employers to give all similarly disabled workers the same benefits it gives pregnant workers."
1986.85-494,1,36075,marian_m_johnston,,2004.303,2012.493,--I believe that's a misreading of the statute to say that pregnancy discrimination is forbidden the same way as discrimination on the basis of other disabilities is forbidden.
1986.85-494,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2099.949,2114.458,"Well, it's your position that an employer, even absent California state law, an employer who does not provide reasonable pregnancy leave would be in violation of Title VII."
1986.85-494,1,36075,marian_m_johnston,,2114.458,2120.678,"--Well, since this is a preemption case, Your Honor, we don't need to decide what Title VII requires the way that Cal Fed violates it."
1986.85-494,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2120.678,2123.214,"Well, is that your position, if we were faced with that?"
1986.85-494,1,36075,marian_m_johnston,,2123.214,2125.016,"Well, various possibilities exist."
1986.85-494,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2128.618,2129.634,Is that your position?
1986.85-494,1,36075,marian_m_johnston,,2129.634,2132.253,--California doesn't care which way the Court comes out on that.
1986.85-494,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2132.82,2139.926,"But your argument of a disparate treatment analysis would lead to that result, would it not?"
1986.85-494,1,36075,marian_m_johnston,,2139.926,2154.0,"--We do argue that the disparate impact analysis has to be available and that a plaintiff in a Title VII case would have to be able to establish that an inadequate leave policy had a disparate impact on the basis of sex, including pregnancy."
1986.85-494,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2234.767,2238.588,May I just interrupt to ask a hypothetical case?
1986.85-494,1,36075,marian_m_johnston,,2281.565,2282.867,"No, I don't think it's perfectly fair."
1986.85-494,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2286.069,2288.685,"Well, you say, it simply guarantees equality for all workers."
1986.85-494,1,36075,marian_m_johnston,,2288.685,2293.639,"Women as compared to men, in that neither lose their job due to pregnancy and child birth."
1986.85-494,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2302.412,2302.945,"Well, you're saying it's--"
1986.85-494,1,36075,marian_m_johnston,,2308.066,2308.983,That's true.
1986.85-494,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2334.281,2341.787,Why does the State of California resist amending its statute to provide for complete equality based on disability?
1986.85-494,1,36075,marian_m_johnston,,2341.787,2345.905,"It simply hasn't gone that far, Your Honor, and neither has Congress."
1986.85-494,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2347.089,2363.366,"Well, Congress under Title VII, at least the language of Title VII can be read, I think... and this is the argument presented to us here today, and I'm not suggesting what the answer is... that state statutes must treat employees equally."
1986.85-494,1,36075,marian_m_johnston,,2363.366,2368.604,"--And if that is the interpretation that the Court chooses to adopt of Title VII, California has no problem with that."
1986.85-494,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2626.302,2630.754,"Ms. Johnston, could I interrupt you and go back for a moment to the business justification defense?"
1986.85-494,1,36075,marian_m_johnston,,2636.408,2637.325,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1986.85-494,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2637.325,2640.979,And were those regulations in effect at the time this controversy arose?
1986.85-494,1,36075,marian_m_johnston,,2640.979,2642.712,"They were in the process, Your Honor."
1986.85-494,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2644.431,2646.581,"The answer is no, they were not in effect; is that right?"
1986.85-494,1,36075,marian_m_johnston,,2646.581,2646.982,--They were not.
1986.85-494,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2648.382,2652.601,And is there statutory authorization for that particular defense?
1986.85-494,1,36075,marian_m_johnston,,2652.601,2658.505,--Not any more than there's statutory authorization for the business necessity defense under Title VII.
1986.85-494,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2661.407,2672.581,"The answer is... under your California statute, I mean, there's no... is there any judicial... would it be a business defense for the employer to come in and say, we didn't have a job open at the time?"
1986.85-494,1,36075,marian_m_johnston,,2679.854,2680.654,We don't know.
1986.85-494,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2691.244,2691.844,"Well, I understand that."
1986.85-494,1,36075,marian_m_johnston,,2700.35,2706.838,"--Well, it's not simply that there's no job available, but that the employer did not make reasonable efforts, sufficient efforts, to maintain the job."
1986.85-494,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2726.649,2729.435,An employer?
1986.85-494,1,36075,marian_m_johnston,,2735.672,2752.431,"Cal Fed says, and it's in the Joint Appendix at page 40, I believe Your Honor, that it says that it reserves the right to terminate... Cal Fed reserves the right to terminate an employee on leave of absence if a similar or suitable position is not available."
1986.85-494,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2752.431,2760.204,"Yes, but it previously says, if this happens... so forth and so on... the personnel division will make every effort to provide similar and suitable position."
1986.85-494,1,36075,marian_m_johnston,,2764.139,2765.591,"I don't think that's enough, Your Honor."
1986.85-494,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2772.262,2775.797,"Well, even if they don't have an obligation do, if they always do, which they say they do--"
1986.85-494,1,36075,marian_m_johnston,,2775.797,2776.916,"--Well, they didn't in this case, Your Honor."
1986.85-494,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2790.073,2793.091,"--Which is the first time they had a job available, I gather."
1986.85-494,1,36075,marian_m_johnston,,2836.084,2842.588,"Well, in fact, Your Honor, I believe it's still correct that California does have a higher minimum wage than the federal minimum, and all employees have to receive that."
1986.85-494,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2854.146,2856.664,"Well, why would it be unconstitutional?"
1986.85-494,1,36075,marian_m_johnston,,2867.305,2872.691,"Well, at the very least they would have to show a sufficient state interest in order to justify such a state statute."
1986.85-494,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2896.289,2904.078,"Well, but supposing California comes in in a case like this, where that question is raised, and says: The employer doesn't have to violate it at all."
1986.85-494,1,36075,marian_m_johnston,,2906.514,2909.382,--And I think that that's a perfectly reasonable interpretation of Title VII.
1986.85-494,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2937.735,2941.787,"That's what most laws are based on, isn't it, assumptions that the legislature makes?"
1986.85-494,1,36075,marian_m_johnston,,2941.787,2949.091,But the California statute is quite different in that it doesn't assume that pregnant employees are going to need any specific time off.
1986.85-494,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2965.386,2973.159,"Well, but the California legislature has specified a period of four months, which is certainly a generalization that may not apply in every single case, isn't it?"
1986.85-494,1,36075,marian_m_johnston,,2973.159,2976.276,"--Well, what it is is a limit, though, on the amount of leave that a woman can receive."
1986.85-494,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2978.66,2982.764,"Yes, but isn't it conceivable that some women might need more than four months of--"
1986.85-494,1,36075,marian_m_johnston,,2982.764,2983.147,That's correct.
1986.85-494,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2983.147,2984.064,--or something like that?
1986.85-494,1,36075,marian_m_johnston,,2984.064,2987.716,"And if that happens, Your Honor, then this particular California statute does not apply."
1986.85-494,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3002.059,3013.034,What I wanted to point out by my question is that there is an area of general legislation in the California statute where they specify four months as the period that the limit can't exceed.
1986.85-494,1,36075,marian_m_johnston,,3013.034,3013.667,That is true.
1986.85-494,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3072.669,3074.705,"Thank you, Ms. Johnston."
1986.85-494,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3077.407,3080.525,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1986.85-494,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3171.933,3181.89,"But Mr. Olson, at the time the California statute was passed, immediately after the Gilbert decision, it was true, was it not, that this group did need some extra help to be equalized in the employment market?"
1986.85-494,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3181.89,3185.759,The Congress addressed the means of providing that assistance.
1986.85-494,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3186.126,3188.478,"Well, I'm saying at the time that California enacted its statute."
1986.85-494,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3188.478,3193.948,"--California enacted its statute shortly before the Pregnancy Discrimination Act, but it was not effective until after, Mr. Justice Stevens."
1986.85-494,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3193.948,3194.382,I understand.
1986.85-494,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3200.102,3204.554,"Yes, but I believe that Congress selected the means to solve that problem."
1986.85-494,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3204.554,3206.256,After the California statute was passed?
1986.85-494,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3206.256,3208.375,But before the California statute became effective.
1986.85-494,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3208.375,3209.992,Okay.
1986.85-494,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3209.992,3211.725,"Thank you, Mr. Olson."
