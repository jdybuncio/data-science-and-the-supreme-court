1971.71-32,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,20.004,So first this morning in number 71-32 Curtis C. Flood against Kuhn and others.
1971.71-32,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,20.985,25.894,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the court.
1971.71-32,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1007.87,1023.15,"He indicated in his letter, I noticed in the record in his letter in late 1969 to Mr. Kuhn that Philadelphia had offered him a contract, what were the terms of that contract, not all the details but in the (voice overlap)"
1971.71-32,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1023.15,1040.988,"They offered him an increase to a $100,000 with salary and another benefits, but that was not what he was contesting, he was contesting being removed without his consent and as his letter states he didn't want to be treated as channel property, question of principle."
1971.71-32,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1040.988,1051.206,"I just wanted to ask to you, but you are now telling us about the lack of mootness and about his damages in 1970 He was moved off for $20,000 (voice overlap)"
1971.71-32,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1051.206,1078.67,"It is not by the way new although I have seen articles about it which indicates that this high paid ball player did things as you know that, why did he do it when other ball players, by the way despite of all the stories in press in the five years previous had only averaged a little over $8,000 a year, why this high paid ball player did this?"
1971.71-32,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1118.855,1129.41,"As a practical matter, he had no real chance remaining in St. Louis and negotiating another controversy with St. Louis, he would have had to go to one on the other teams even if he had been to the reserve --"
1971.71-32,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1129.41,1137.322,"Exactly, Mr. Justice provided this clause is legal and I shall say it is not."
1971.71-32,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1137.322,1145.94,"Even if it's not legal, if St. Louis is trading him, regardless of the reserve clause they are not going to negotiate another contract?"
1971.71-32,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1145.94,1159.386,"He said that what he wanted, what is the opportunity as a free agent to negotiate his own deal, not to be traded as this form that I have referred, indicates without his concern."
1971.71-32,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1249.017,1257.544,"Mr. Justice may I ask you, suppose it had been collectively agreed to would your position be any different?"
1971.71-32,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1257.544,1260.389,No.
1971.71-32,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1263.551,1264.997,I hope you are going to get to that.
1971.71-32,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1264.997,1273.68,"I will move fast, because of the shortness of time, we have these three of our positions."
1971.71-32,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1288.208,1290.159,And as they would have to be overruled.
1971.71-32,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1290.159,1310.61,"They would have to overruled, they should be overruled, they should be overruled for very good reasons, they should be overruled because the first one Federal Baseball was not as Judge Friendly has said, “Justice Holmes happiest hour”, indeed."
1971.71-32,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1310.61,1316.116,But I take that Mr. Justice those both dealt with the issue of statutory constructions.
1971.71-32,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1316.116,1323.144,"Yes, but even then it showed, I doubt that Justice Holmes had never seen a ball game--"
1971.71-32,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1323.144,1328.759,The Court doesn’t readily overrule as a Statutory construction.
1971.71-32,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1328.759,1342.184,Yes but it has and quite recently as I shall point out in a moment in reading throwing opinion written by Justice Stewart for a unanimous court in construing a statute.
1971.71-32,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1486.201,1514.149,"Mr. Justice said just before you start on that, do you think Federal Baseball and Toolson indicated that the baseball was not engaged in interstate commerce or is it that labor isn't an article of commerce, service is not article of commerce is a matter of statutory construction than the intent of Congress, would you just say that labor is an article of commerce?"
1971.71-32,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1514.149,1519.773,"It depends on what way labor is treated, labor should not be an article of commerce."
1971.71-32,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1522.183,1524.712,Well is Flood different?
1971.71-32,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1524.712,1531.614,"Yes, because he is been treated as a commodity, as everybody is under the reserve rule."
1971.71-32,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1539.515,1543.142,But in anyways -- I gather Radovich settled that?
1971.71-32,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1543.142,1558.639,"Yes it did, the same issue was Radovich and decided against the football owners which brought Radovich, which were involved in Radovich's decision in this Court."
1971.71-32,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1810.727,1812.741,Has the petitioner left baseball?
1971.71-32,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1812.741,1813.558,Pardon.
1971.71-32,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1813.558,1814.589,Has the petitioner left baseball?
1971.71-32,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1814.589,1817.572,"Yes, he left -- he left now."
1971.71-32,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1817.572,1818.676,Is the case moot?
1971.71-32,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1818.676,1837.027,"No, it's not because the 70 season, is the season where he has right to recover damages because he returned later and he also has right to decide if he wants to go to Minor Leagues, or Japan which are subjected to the same rules."
1971.71-32,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1841.399,1842.374,Your rebuttal time is used up.
1971.71-32,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1842.374,1843.726,"About, yes."
1971.71-32,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1845.96,1847.044,Excuse me.
1971.71-32,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1854.634,1869.328,There is nothing too bad to the baseball argument that a new found affection for the collective bargaining and the labor act.
1971.71-32,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2021.918,2023.105,Mr .Potter.
1971.71-32,1,38229,paul_a_porter,,2023.105,2039.305,"Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the court, I wish to take about five minutes, I represent the respondent Bowie Kuhn, Commissioner of Baseball who was the defendant below on the count of one, and that was the Antitrust law."
1971.71-32,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2125.612,2132.239,"Well, Mr. Porter is the structure of other sports different to that football, basketball?"
1971.71-32,1,38229,paul_a_porter,,2132.239,2134.546,Not presumably Mr. Justice Brennan.
1971.71-32,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2140.738,2146.287,Yet they come within the application of the Antitrust law?
1971.71-32,1,38229,paul_a_porter,,2146.287,2148.908,Well it is never been challenged expect in Radovich.
1971.71-32,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2162.994,2168.047,You are not making an argument for uniqueness of baseball and and respective instructions.
1971.71-32,1,38229,paul_a_porter,,2168.047,2168.876,Indeed we are.
1971.71-32,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2168.876,2169.373,You are.
1971.71-32,1,38229,paul_a_porter,,2169.373,2170.667,Indeed we are.
1971.71-32,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2238.986,2247.472,Does this go to whether there would be a violation of the antitrust laws rather than to coverage?
1971.71-32,1,38229,paul_a_porter,,2247.472,2253.074,"Well, I think that Mr. Justice White this is a labor dispute."
1971.71-32,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2289.851,2294.67,I beg your pardon you just said this litigation was brought by the players union?
1971.71-32,1,38229,paul_a_porter,,2294.67,2299.038,"Oh, it was really financed by the players union and indeed that's conceded in this record."
1971.71-32,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2301.232,2303.246,Are they really saying this is their law suit not --
1971.71-32,1,38229,paul_a_porter,,2303.246,2303.964,Absolutely.
1971.71-32,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2334.11,2336.033,Mr. Hoynes.
1971.71-32,2,34625,louis_f_hoynes_jr,,2336.033,2339.609,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the court.
1971.71-32,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2348.09,2351.837,Is your position that baseball is not commerce?
1971.71-32,2,34625,louis_f_hoynes_jr,,2351.837,2355.662,"No, it's not my position that baseball is not commerce Your Honor."
1971.71-32,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2387.963,2390.679,Does the record show us anything about the union?
1971.71-32,2,34625,louis_f_hoynes_jr,,2390.679,2402.124,"The record shows in very great detail Your Honor as does the opinion of Judge Cooper devoted a good portion of his opinion to tracing the effectiveness of bargaining, the effectiveness of the union--"
1971.71-32,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2402.124,2404.274,It's extent numbers of players or --
1971.71-32,2,34625,louis_f_hoynes_jr,,2404.274,2410.579,Yes all of the players in Major League baseball really are members of Players Association.
1971.71-32,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2422.493,2428.13,There are many NLRB proceedings involving the relationships between the clubs and this --
1971.71-32,2,34625,louis_f_hoynes_jr,,2428.13,2428.423,Well.
1971.71-32,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2449.133,2452.237,Your both proceedings you're referring to are the ones that are by the umpires.
1971.71-32,2,34625,louis_f_hoynes_jr,,2452.237,2456.697,"No, I was referring to proceedings involved in the Major League Baseball players association."
1971.71-32,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2475.937,2480.421,Would you be taking the same position that the plaintiff here were a minor league player?
1971.71-32,2,34625,louis_f_hoynes_jr,,2480.421,2482.038,It's a player for Minor league player?
1971.71-32,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2498.844,2508.535,The players aren't -- the Minor League Players at terms aren't settled by the bargaining between them?
1971.71-32,2,34625,louis_f_hoynes_jr,,2508.535,2510.852,Bargaining with the Minor League players directly?
1971.71-32,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2519.61,2523.26,So then your position would not be the same if this is a point on the plaintiff.
1971.71-32,2,34625,louis_f_hoynes_jr,,2523.26,2525.45,Well at my position would be the same Your Honor.
1971.71-32,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2538.422,2543.164,"Mr. Hoynes, how far is this representation of Flood Curt."
1971.71-32,2,34625,louis_f_hoynes_jr,,2551.46,2553.919,"I mean, as far as the assignment of Flood's contract?"
1971.71-32,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2553.919,2554.79,Yes.
1971.71-32,2,34625,louis_f_hoynes_jr,,2554.79,2561.624,No that contract assignment took place under the rules which themselves were the subject to bargaining.
1971.71-32,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2561.624,2567.623,"Well, how much representation Flood get from this outfit?"
1971.71-32,2,34625,louis_f_hoynes_jr,,2567.623,2569.648,"Well, no one--."
1971.71-32,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2569.648,2578.331,"As to this trade which is the basis of this suit, now what position did the union take on that?"
1971.71-32,2,34625,louis_f_hoynes_jr,,2579.529,2580.939,I call it union Your Honor.
1971.71-32,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2580.939,2583.617,Well what position did the union take on that?
1971.71-32,2,34625,louis_f_hoynes_jr,,2584.925,2608.101,"The Union after the transaction took place, conferred with Mr. Flood as I understand it and ultimately agreed with him to finance the cost of his litigation and as I was about to point out, it is quite transparent I believe from the reading of the record that the Players Association, the Players Union has in fact controlled this litigation from beginning to end."
1971.71-32,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2608.101,2616.563,"I understood that, the union and management what they were interested in is non-litigate, is that right?"
1971.71-32,2,34625,louis_f_hoynes_jr,,2616.563,2619.079,"We certainly are interested in not litigating Your Honor, we believe that--"
1971.71-32,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2619.079,2624.557,What if negotiation was done between this union that protected Flood?
1971.71-32,2,34625,louis_f_hoynes_jr,,2624.557,2626.505,"Well, when the law suit --"
1971.71-32,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2626.505,2629.934,What if anything before the law suit?
1971.71-32,2,34625,louis_f_hoynes_jr,,2629.934,2633.635,No representations by the union were made to us --
1971.71-32,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2633.635,2634.746,That’s normal?
1971.71-32,2,34625,louis_f_hoynes_jr,,2634.746,2636.687,Seeking any --
1971.71-32,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2636.687,2639.833,Is that normal in union management relationship?
1971.71-32,2,34625,louis_f_hoynes_jr,,2639.833,2643.315,"Your Honor, I believe it is during the pendency of the collective bargaining agreement."
1971.71-32,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2653.407,2664.046,"Now the union, which says the management, you can pick up a man and throw him out the door without any recourse."
1971.71-32,2,34625,louis_f_hoynes_jr,,2665.938,2667.881,Your Honor I don't believe the unions ever agreed to that.
1971.71-32,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2668.848,2675.958,"Well, did the union agreed to the bargaining -- to that paragraph which is under attack here, the reserve clause?"
1971.71-32,2,34625,louis_f_hoynes_jr,,2675.958,2680.856,The reserve system is not simply a paragraph but a number of inter-related rules--
1971.71-32,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2680.856,2682.399,Agreed to by the union?
1971.71-32,2,34625,louis_f_hoynes_jr,,2682.399,2686.789,"I believe that's right Your Honor – I beg your pardon, with the management."
1971.71-32,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2686.789,2689.088,Is there anything in the record that shows that?
1971.71-32,2,34625,louis_f_hoynes_jr,,2689.088,2694.066,"Well, your honor there are the collective bargain agreements in the record."
1971.71-32,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2694.066,2700.935,Is there anything that shows that the union which you call a union agree to these provisions?
1971.71-32,2,34625,louis_f_hoynes_jr,,2700.935,2711.983,"Your Honor, a collectively bargained agreement is an agreement signed obviously by the union and by management and all of the major league rules where encompassed by that agreement."
1971.71-32,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2713.708,2715.246,As far as the union.
1971.71-32,2,34625,louis_f_hoynes_jr,,2715.246,2727.616,"Well, the union Your Honor is I think having participated in the bargaining on management side for the last several years, has made remarkable gains with respect to player club relationships."
1971.71-32,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2727.616,2731.359,What has it done concerning individual players’ relationships?
1971.71-32,2,34625,louis_f_hoynes_jr,,2731.359,2732.645,Well the union is --
1971.71-32,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2732.645,2734.156,"Well, I say nothing."
1971.71-32,2,34625,louis_f_hoynes_jr,,2734.156,2734.903,"No, I would not say nothing."
1971.71-32,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2734.903,2738.642,Then wouldn’t you say under reserve clause there was no room for bargaining?
1971.71-32,2,34625,louis_f_hoynes_jr,,2738.642,2740.21,"No, I certainly would not say that."
1971.71-32,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2760.663,2762.017,You mean back to the union?
1971.71-32,2,34625,louis_f_hoynes_jr,,2762.017,2765.188,Back to the collective bargaining table.
1971.71-32,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2766.277,2770.315,Well even though the union is not protecting the individuals?
1971.71-32,2,34625,louis_f_hoynes_jr,,2770.315,2772.214,Well the union is protecting the individual.
1971.71-32,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2774.517,2781.897,How the union is protecting this individual whose name who is the petitioner Curtis C. Flood?
1971.71-32,2,34625,louis_f_hoynes_jr,,2781.897,2793.029,"Your Honor, the union bargains obviously for future benefits and what's at stake here is the shape of baseball and its employee relations really for the future."
1971.71-32,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2800.612,2802.56,"Would you call it voluntary, would you?"
1971.71-32,2,34625,louis_f_hoynes_jr,,2802.56,2806.146,"Well, I would call it voluntarily retired at this point, Your Honor."
1971.71-32,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2861.248,2863.264,This isn't in the record?
1971.71-32,2,34625,louis_f_hoynes_jr,,2863.264,2865.025,None of which is in the record Your Honor.
1971.71-32,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2865.025,2867.942,He is playing with Washington or any of his other business?
1971.71-32,2,34625,louis_f_hoynes_jr,,2867.942,2872.208,"Well, the record was closed before he began to play for Washington Your Honor, yes."
1971.71-32,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3015.892,3029.894,"I would say at this point would you comment as to why baseball moved to extend the -- why did it move into the draft system in 1965, to the new player?"
1971.71-32,2,34625,louis_f_hoynes_jr,,3029.894,3045.827,"Your Honor, the adaption of the draft system is simply one more step, and a number of steps that baseball had taken over a period of years to try to equalize competition on a playing field, preceding the draft rule there were rules about bonus issue, you may remember this."
1971.71-32,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3062.347,3066.472,The bonus system itself didn't come into effect until fairly recently?
1971.71-32,2,34625,louis_f_hoynes_jr,,3066.472,3067.839,I beg your pardon?
1971.71-32,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3067.839,3069.743,When are the first bonuses paid?
1971.71-32,2,34625,louis_f_hoynes_jr,,3069.743,3076.148,Well I think the first bonuses were probably of large amount were paid in 50s.
1971.71-32,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3105.814,3118.415,"Mr. Hoynes what are the principle differences between the standard National Football League contract, and the type of contract which Mr. Flood had?"
1971.71-32,2,34625,louis_f_hoynes_jr,,3118.415,3128.652,"Well, Your Honor, there are number of differences in the employment relationship between football, and baseball, and a number of differences in the sport, the character of the sport themselves."
1971.71-32,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3341.213,3344.393,Why they came to this lawsuit?
1971.71-32,2,34625,louis_f_hoynes_jr,,3346.879,3349.723,You're expressing a fact Your Honor.
1971.71-32,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3423.994,3429.766,Do you think this issue here whether the Reserve Clause violates the antitrust laws.
1971.71-32,2,34625,louis_f_hoynes_jr,,3434.665,3448.464,"Well, Your Honor, I think the only factual issues presented here, obviously the broader issue is Toolson exemption which we believe reaches to the entire structure of the game, not only reserve system."
1971.71-32,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3452.871,3457.261,The merits of the controversy were never reached either in the District Court or the Court of Appeals.
1971.71-32,2,34625,louis_f_hoynes_jr,,3484.64,3491.945,"It's quite right Your Honor, but I think there are other levels of decision here too, the labor matter that we're discussing that I'm now arguing, that's not --"
1971.71-32,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3491.945,3498.668,Well that's -- but that just is a -- that bolsters your argument I gather that this is not a matter for the Antitrust law.
1971.71-32,2,34625,louis_f_hoynes_jr,,3498.668,3499.816,That's right Your Honor.
1971.71-32,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3503.454,3515.122,"I believe that you could lose the issue here, that is here on coverage and still win on the reasonableness of the Reserve System under the Antitrust law."
1971.71-32,2,34625,louis_f_hoynes_jr,,3515.122,3530.094,"Yes, I presume we could also lose the issue here on broad coverage and prevail on the issue that no suit can appropriately be brought by member of the collective bargaining organization and matter which is essentially a matter of collective bargaining."
1971.71-32,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3530.094,3540.884,"Do you think there is something unique in the union representing the great range of baseball players, all of them being neglected bargaining agent for all of the players in a unit?"
1971.71-32,2,34625,louis_f_hoynes_jr,,3540.884,3541.971,No Your Honor I don't.
1971.71-32,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3541.971,3545.634,But you don't report to reach the question of salary?
1971.71-32,2,34625,louis_f_hoynes_jr,,3545.634,3554.862,"No, the union has expressed in its dealing to the best that it does not wish to bargain except to set minimums and other parameters."
1971.71-32,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3565.67,3567.218,The unions usually do.
1971.71-32,2,34625,louis_f_hoynes_jr,,3567.218,3568.946,"That's right Your Honor, but the range of --"
1971.71-32,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3568.946,3570.27,And why it doesn't adhere?
1971.71-32,2,34625,louis_f_hoynes_jr,,3570.27,3572.063,It certainly could Your Honor.
1971.71-32,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3578.852,3580.033,And the same with you?
1971.71-32,2,34625,louis_f_hoynes_jr,,3581.002,3582.561,We would have put it on the bargaining table as well.
1971.71-32,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3588.749,3594.187,That's just because players are too different one from another for one union to represent.
1971.71-32,2,34625,louis_f_hoynes_jr,,3594.187,3596.994,"I think that that is part of the answer Your Honor, yes."
1971.71-32,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3598.278,3599.751,What's the rest of the answer?
1971.71-32,2,34625,louis_f_hoynes_jr,,3599.751,3609.33,"Well, I think that rest of the answer is that now we know the players are different but their relationships with their clubs maybe different as well."
1971.71-32,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3609.33,3610.699,You're saying the same thing.
1971.71-32,2,34625,louis_f_hoynes_jr,,3610.699,3613.823,"It's feature of the same thing, an aspect of the same."
1971.71-32,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3622.84,3632.369,"And while the union feels that if in a new field apparently, that you and the union really shouldn't set salaries which is usually the subject of collective bargaining."
1971.71-32,2,34625,louis_f_hoynes_jr,,3638.15,3639.196,"Well, Your Honor--"
1971.71-32,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3639.196,3642.674,Even though the players are different one from another and their relationships are collaborative--
1971.71-32,2,34625,louis_f_hoynes_jr,,3642.674,3649.585,"We don't think it will be practical to have a different Reserve System for each individual player, such as you can't differentiate salaries."
1971.71-32,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3707.944,3716.07,Let's assume that for the moment that both players and management as they do say pay out as a collective bargaining issue.
1971.71-32,2,34625,louis_f_hoynes_jr,,3729.949,3731.95,But we certainly would not do that Your Honor.
1971.71-32,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3731.95,3734.274,Let's just assume you did.
1971.71-32,2,34625,louis_f_hoynes_jr,,3740.915,3742.459,Not one that we have suggested Your Honor.
1971.71-32,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3752.474,3755.749,"Well, I take it then you wouldn't do that because you think that would be improper."
1971.71-32,2,34625,louis_f_hoynes_jr,,3755.749,3758.121,I think it would improper Your Honor.
1971.71-32,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3758.121,3761.835,Such as violating the Antitrust laws.
1971.71-32,2,34625,louis_f_hoynes_jr,,3761.835,3765.329,"No, not all Your Honor, improper in terms of the labor laws."
1971.71-32,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3765.329,3766.483,Alright let's pursue that.
1971.71-32,2,34625,louis_f_hoynes_jr,,3789.083,3797.134,"If this were put aside as a bargaining issue, you can't make something that is not a bargaining issue, which you can agree not to bargain about it."
1971.71-32,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3797.134,3798.996,"Alright let's assume, put it the way you want."
1971.71-32,2,34625,louis_f_hoynes_jr,,3800.804,3807.186,We had agreed not to bargain about it and the union thereby would have acquiesced in our setting such maximums.
1971.71-32,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3809.942,3811.479,Only because of the labor exemption.
1971.71-32,2,34625,louis_f_hoynes_jr,,3811.479,3813.884,"Because of the labor exemption, because of the union acquiescence."
1971.71-32,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3818.733,3823.83,"Because of the labor exemption, because of the basic exemption to baseball Antitrust laws. Of course right?"
1971.71-32,2,34625,louis_f_hoynes_jr,,3823.83,3825.707,That goes without saying Your Honor.
1971.71-32,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3859.867,3866.236,You are suggesting that this judgment below would be upheld on the grounds not reached below?
1971.71-32,2,34625,louis_f_hoynes_jr,,3866.236,3882.208,"Your Honor I'm suggesting that the judgment ; number one, that the judgment below be upheld on the grounds reached below, but alternatively that there is an additional, powerful and we think quite correct ground, which the courts below felt that not necessary to reach to a labor policy which offers an alternative reason for --"
1971.71-32,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3882.208,3884.358,Do you think the record is adequate for that ground?
1971.71-32,2,34625,louis_f_hoynes_jr,,3884.358,3889.817,I think the record is quite adequate.
1971.71-32,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3889.817,3892.686,You would oppose the remand.
1971.71-32,2,34625,louis_f_hoynes_jr,,3911.017,3918.025,Your Honor I think it would not be inappropriate to remand that for such findings as you might feel that would be appropriate or not inconsistent with your opinion.
1971.71-32,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4009.28,4010.082,Thank you gentlemen.
