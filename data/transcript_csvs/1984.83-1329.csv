1984.83-1329,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,9.057,We'll hear arguments next in Ponte against Real.
1984.83-1329,0,36181,martin_e_levin,,50.183,74.539,"Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court, this case presents a relatively narrow issue, and that is whether Chapter 103 of the Code of Massachsetts Regulations, Section 430.14 fails to satisfy the due process clause because it does not require a Prison Disciplinary Board to state its reasons in the record for denying an inmate's request for witnesses at his disciplinary hearing."
1984.83-1329,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,91.102,109.985,"Counsel, when you say requirement of a statement of reason, you're talking about a requirement that the administrative record before the Prison Disciplinary Board contain a statement of reasons as to why the Superintendent refused to allow a witness requested by the prisoner to be called?"
1984.83-1329,0,36181,martin_e_levin,,109.985,113.317,As to why the Disciplinary Board refused to allow that request.
1984.83-1329,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,114.108,125.035,"That would be as opposed to what might later be offered in a 1983 suit where the prisoner challenges his disciplinary hearing, reasons advanced at that time by the State."
1984.83-1329,0,36181,martin_e_levin,,125.035,126.197,"Correct, Your Honor."
1984.83-1329,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,257.482,262.545,What was the theory of... his theory of the incident?
1984.83-1329,0,36181,martin_e_levin,,264.137,270.812,"--Well, Your Honor, that' not clear from the record as to why... why those witnesses were requested."
1984.83-1329,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,290.183,291.833,"Well, that's a pretty good defense."
1984.83-1329,0,36181,martin_e_levin,,291.833,306.395,"--Well, Your Honor, that may be a good statement in mitigation, but in fact what occurred here was the officer did issue an order which was not obeyed under circumstances in which immediate obedience was necessary."
1984.83-1329,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,306.395,318.012,"But if he couldn't obey, in other words, hasn't he asserted the defense that sounds rather reasonable and he ought to have a chance to prove it?"
1984.83-1329,0,36181,martin_e_levin,,318.012,352.284,"Well, he... I don't want to get into the particulars of the record, but our position basically is that under the circumstances, in fact, when the officer had indeed ordered him not to come in in the first place, and he did not comply with that order, although a number of other inmates whom he was with did, was sufficient disobedience of an order, especially under circumstances such as these in which an assault was taking place, to constitute the offenses charged."
1984.83-1329,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,352.284,364.321,"Mr. Levin, there were no reason given by the Disciplinary Board for its refusal to allow any of the witnesses to be called?"
1984.83-1329,0,36181,martin_e_levin,,364.321,365.631,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1984.83-1329,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,365.631,377.859,"And at the subsequent habeas hearing in the State trial court, is it correct that the State at that time offered no reason, no subsequent reason or explanation?"
1984.83-1329,0,36181,martin_e_levin,,377.859,382.974,"Well, there was no evidence presented by the State at that hearing."
1984.83-1329,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,387.486,399.173,"Well, in addition to no evidence, as I understand that, and I want you to correct me if I'm wrong, the attorney for the State offered no explanation at all."
1984.83-1329,0,36181,martin_e_levin,,399.173,400.726,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1984.83-1329,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,401.915,426.623,"So, on the surface then, the Defendant may have had some plausible excuse for his failure to immediately leave the scene, and yet the reviewing court has no opportunity at all to understand the reason why he wasn't allowed to call witnesses."
1984.83-1329,0,36181,martin_e_levin,,430.865,444.264,"Well, Your Honor, the reviewing court did, I believe, have the administrative record which reflected what was before the Prison Disciplinary Board during the prison disciplinary proceedings."
1984.83-1329,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,494.627,504.492,"One thing that worries me: We assume that the original order by the guard was a lawful order, don't we?"
1984.83-1329,0,36181,martin_e_levin,,507.675,509.137,That it was a lawful order?
1984.83-1329,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,509.137,510.098,Yeah.
1984.83-1329,0,36181,martin_e_levin,,510.098,518.444,"Well, there has never been any issue raised in the case that the guard didn't have the authority to order Real to stay out of the office at that time."
1984.83-1329,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,518.444,520.073,For no reason?
1984.83-1329,0,36181,martin_e_levin,,527.899,530.73,"Well, whether or not the officer has--"
1984.83-1329,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,530.73,531.54,And is that a lawful order?
1984.83-1329,0,36181,martin_e_levin,,531.54,538.145,"--Whether or not the officer has to give a reason to a prisoner, in general--"
1984.83-1329,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,538.145,541.557,"You say that in this case, the prisoner has to give all these reasons."
1984.83-1329,0,36181,martin_e_levin,,544.149,551.355,"--Well, under these circumstances, Your Honor, I don't think the guard did have to give any reasons."
1984.83-1329,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,557.92,559.399,I don't mean he had to give reason to the man.
1984.83-1329,0,36181,martin_e_levin,,561.88,563.241,--To the court?
1984.83-1329,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,563.241,564.303,Yeah.
1984.83-1329,0,36181,martin_e_levin,,564.303,576.141,"Well, the reasons for the order, the reasons for the charge of the offense in the first place, were before the court in the administrative record and the disciplinary report."
1984.83-1329,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,576.141,580.473,"It said... well, what was the reason for the guard doing that?"
1984.83-1329,0,36181,martin_e_levin,,580.473,587.938,"The guard was in a prison office, an office within the prison, trying to stop another inmate's attack on another guard."
1984.83-1329,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,599.186,600.067,That's in the record.
1984.83-1329,0,36181,martin_e_levin,,600.067,601.727,That's in the administrative record.
1984.83-1329,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,603.019,604.369,"Well, that's all I was asking for."
1984.83-1329,0,36181,martin_e_levin,,615.308,634.569,"Well, Your Honor, in some of the lower federal courts in successful actions under these circumstances, what prisoners did show, for example, was that there was a persistent practice on the part of prison officials to never allow an inmate to call a witness."
1984.83-1329,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,649.88,667.18,"Could a showing ever be made, in your view, on an individual case that it was needed just for evidence and there was no valid excuse no discrimination alleged, no overall policy alleged?"
1984.83-1329,0,36181,martin_e_levin,,667.18,676.817,"Well, Your Honor, in the first place, it's our position that the necessity with respect to the evidence is not the end of the inquiry."
1984.83-1329,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,716.054,740.978,"Well, do you think that the case of Hughes v. Roe has any relevance for our purposes here in indicating that in the absence of some indication on the record that concern for safety of witnesses, for example, or other prisoners was a concern that the State has to offer at least an explanation of some kind?"
1984.83-1329,0,36181,martin_e_levin,,740.978,741.618,"No, Your Honor."
1984.83-1329,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,818.339,830.037,"Well, of course, the Supreme Judicial Court seems to have held that, and I think that's contrary to the... for myself, that's contrary to the language in Wolff and in Baxter."
1984.83-1329,0,36181,martin_e_levin,,874.646,875.968,"No, Your Honor."
1984.83-1329,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,966.467,976.744,"Mr. Levin, may I just say that I'm still a little unclear whether you draw a distinction between the duty to explain at the hearing itself and in subsequent litigation."
1984.83-1329,0,36181,martin_e_levin,,978.294,979.766,"--Well, Your Honor, the--"
1984.83-1329,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,979.766,988.442,"You're saying that if aggravated facts are alleged, you would have to explain; if he alleged that there was a conspiracy directed against him."
1984.83-1329,0,36181,martin_e_levin,,992.633,993.544,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1984.83-1329,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,993.544,994.716,That's your position?
1984.83-1329,0,36181,martin_e_levin,,1001.96,1003.332,"Yes, Your Honor."
1984.83-1329,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1003.332,1005.172,You draw no distinction between the two?
1984.83-1329,0,36181,martin_e_levin,,1005.172,1006.584,We draw no distinction.
1984.83-1329,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1048.502,1055.694,"The decision below was that the agency, the prison had to put in the administrative record a reason."
1984.83-1329,0,36181,martin_e_levin,,1055.694,1057.905,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1984.83-1329,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1057.905,1063.93,"And that it wouldn't be enough if, in litigation, the State offered a reason?"
1984.83-1329,0,36181,martin_e_levin,,1063.93,1066.561,"That was, most certainly, the decision below, Your Honor."
1984.83-1329,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1066.561,1070.434,"So that's the issue we have, whether at the time they must give an explanation."
1984.83-1329,0,36181,martin_e_levin,,1070.434,1071.596,"Yes, Your Honor."
1984.83-1329,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1071.596,1072.986,We'll resume there at 1:00 o'clock.
1984.83-1329,0,36181,martin_e_levin,,1072.986,1073.446,Thank you.
1984.83-1329,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1073.446,1083.044,"You may continue, Mr Levin."
1984.83-1329,0,36181,martin_e_levin,,1083.044,1099.663,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, to resume with my response to Justice White's question, in fact what the Supreme Judicial Court did hold in this case is that the statement of reasons to be given is to be given in the administrative record at the disciplinary hearing."
1984.83-1329,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1196.168,1197.568,"Mr. Levin, may I ask you a question?"
1984.83-1329,0,36181,martin_e_levin,,1200.39,1201.381,"Yes, Your Honor."
1984.83-1329,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1201.381,1217.069,"But, in their opinion, they said the question was based on the fact there was no... I am reading from page 16 of the jurisdictional statement, I guess it is, petition for certiorari... failure to explain in any fashion at the hearing or later."
1984.83-1329,0,36181,martin_e_levin,,1231.781,1251.963,"Well, Your Honor, I'd have to page through the opinion to find the exact spot, but I am confident that even though they noted that there was no statement of reasons given, either at the hearing or later, the ruling was that the statement of reason should come at the point of the disciplinary hearing and not be what they considered to be a post hac rationalization."
1984.83-1329,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1302.967,1311.302,"That may all be absolutely correct, but the constitutional violation, as I understand their holding, was that there was no explanation at any time."
1984.83-1329,0,36181,martin_e_levin,,1319.788,1324.109,"--Well, Your Honor, we're not saying that it is the same issue."
1984.83-1329,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1346.035,1355.472,"Well, I am still not quite clear whether your position is that there was no constitutional violation in this record or that the Massachusetts court ordered the wrong remedy."
1984.83-1329,0,36181,martin_e_levin,,1358.444,1359.762,"--Well, Your Honor, both."
1984.83-1329,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1362.614,1365.185,Even though there was no explanation at any time.
1984.83-1329,0,36181,martin_e_levin,,1365.185,1366.407,Certainly not.
1984.83-1329,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1366.407,1372.271,"Well, Mr. Levin, let me ask you a question about the holding."
1984.83-1329,0,36181,martin_e_levin,,1377.163,1378.215,"Yes, Your Honor."
1984.83-1329,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1378.215,1383.368,"And on page 22, they said... and this is of the jurisdictional statement:"
1984.83-1329,0,36181,martin_e_levin,,1401.601,1406.983,"Yes, Your Honor, and that's exactly the portion of the opinion to which I was just referring."
1984.83-1329,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1469.154,1470.326,What does that follow?
1984.83-1329,0,36181,martin_e_levin,,1480.181,1493.641,"Well, Your Honor, I believe that under the ruling in Wolff, the record is to be shown to the inmate and is to include those factors that is required by the court under the constitution."
1984.83-1329,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1519.007,1520.469,I don't understand your reference to Wolff.
1984.83-1329,0,36181,martin_e_levin,,1522.75,1523.321,"--No, no."
1984.83-1329,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1617.061,1639.998,"--Well, I suppose that a procedure whereby some kind of explanation is... contemporaneous explanation would be made by the Disciplinary Board, but in every case perhaps kept confidential so that it could be reviewed by any subsequent court in camera."
1984.83-1329,0,36181,martin_e_levin,,1643.048,1648.073,"Well, Your Honor, I'm not going to say it's unworkable."
1984.83-1329,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1648.82,1651.502,So that it isn't reviewed at all by the prisoner.
1984.83-1329,0,36181,martin_e_levin,,1651.502,1660.579,--There are certain drawbacks to that procedure which are inherent in the procedure in general.
1984.83-1329,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1808.308,1816.061,Mr. Shapiro.
1984.83-1329,1,33077,jonathan_shapiro,,1816.061,1826.247,"Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court, I'd like to first address some of the factual issues that were raised in Petitioner's argument."
1984.83-1329,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1952.989,1954.992,Did he have any witnesses at all?
1984.83-1329,1,33077,jonathan_shapiro,,1954.992,1962.727,The only witness who was presented was the correction officer who testified against him.
1984.83-1329,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1962.727,1965.151,I said did he have any.
1984.83-1329,1,33077,jonathan_shapiro,,1965.151,1971.974,"He had requested that that correction officer be present, because otherwise the correction officer would not have been present."
1984.83-1329,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1975.807,1977.537,"Well, he asked for two others."
1984.83-1329,1,33077,jonathan_shapiro,,1977.537,1980.8,He asked also for the officer--
1984.83-1329,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1980.8,1982.933,He asked for two inmates.
1984.83-1329,1,33077,jonathan_shapiro,,1982.933,1985.633,--Those were the witnesses who were denied.
1984.83-1329,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1985.633,1986.382,Yes.
1984.83-1329,1,33077,jonathan_shapiro,,1990.757,2001.312,"The witness request in this case requested two inmates who were eye witnesses, but also... and an officer."
1984.83-1329,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2002.273,2002.794,Right.
1984.83-1329,1,33077,jonathan_shapiro,,2002.794,2003.785,And they were denied.
1984.83-1329,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2003.785,2004.455,Right.
1984.83-1329,1,33077,jonathan_shapiro,,2005.547,2027.11,"It is clear, we think in the record below, that the request was timely made to the Disciplinary Board, and that both in the form which the inmate was required to fill out, he sufficiently indicated the reasons for those witnesses to be present by indicating they were eye witnesses."
1984.83-1329,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2046.102,2049.024,What was the issue in the habeas corpus proceeding?
1984.83-1329,1,33077,jonathan_shapiro,,2053.929,2054.788,Yes.
1984.83-1329,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2063.586,2068.668,Did you... was part of your argument in the... were you at the habeas corpus?
1984.83-1329,1,33077,jonathan_shapiro,,2068.668,2073.581,Mr. Real was not represented at any of the judicial proceedings below.
1984.83-1329,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2075.641,2076.493,In the habeas corpus?
1984.83-1329,1,33077,jonathan_shapiro,,2076.493,2079.104,"--in the Superior Court, and he also proceeded pro se--"
1984.83-1329,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2079.104,2087.529,"Who presented the argument, or who made the argument that the reason for denial should appear in the administrative record?"
1984.83-1329,1,33077,jonathan_shapiro,,2087.529,2097.396,"--That argument was not made at all in the trial court, nor indeed was it made by Mr. Real in the Supreme Judicial Court."
1984.83-1329,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2097.396,2099.918,But that's what the Supreme Judicial Court held.
1984.83-1329,1,33077,jonathan_shapiro,,2099.918,2108.893,We think that a fair reading of the Supreme Judicial Court's opinion is that both issues were considered and ruled on.
1984.83-1329,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2108.893,2109.454,Right.
1984.83-1329,1,33077,jonathan_shapiro,,2139.114,2141.606,I think that was the issue presented.
1984.83-1329,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2145.746,2153.192,"--Well, I mean... but the habeas corpus court could then have decided whether that was enough of a reason to deny witnesses."
1984.83-1329,1,33077,jonathan_shapiro,,2153.192,2153.693,Yes.
1984.83-1329,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2158.856,2160.677,Didn't the State ever give a reason?
1984.83-1329,1,33077,jonathan_shapiro,,2160.677,2162.81,The State has never given a reason.
1984.83-1329,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2165.802,2173.956,But the District Court said that... also held there should be reasons given at the administrative hearing.
1984.83-1329,1,33077,jonathan_shapiro,,2173.956,2206.187,"--The trial judge, and this was a Superior Court, State judge, held only that because in his view the inmate had made a prima facie case, that he was entitled to witnesses, and in court the Petitioner, the State had not given any explanation as to why those witnesses were refused, he concluded that that meant that the witnesses had been arbitrarily denied and ordered relief on that basis."
1984.83-1329,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2206.187,2206.587,Right.
1984.83-1329,1,33077,jonathan_shapiro,,2206.587,2216.014,There was no requirement considered or imposed by the trial judge that reasons be given at the administrative rather than the judicial hearing.
1984.83-1329,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2216.014,2216.826,Right.
1984.83-1329,1,33077,jonathan_shapiro,,2232.514,2236.798,I think the Supreme Judicial Court did certainly find that persuasive.
1984.83-1329,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2291.933,2306.142,--Would it have satisfied your position if the reason given was that it would expose these witnesses to reprisals either by the individual or by his friends?
1984.83-1329,1,33077,jonathan_shapiro,,2306.142,2319.041,"I think, unquestionably, that would provide, depending on the facts of the case, a legitimate justification for a limitation of the right to call witnesses."
1984.83-1329,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2408.18,2422.6,"Would it be appropriate for the regulations to provide that in order to have that right, the inmate must tender or proffer a statement of what the witnesses, each of the witnesses would say if they were called?"
1984.83-1329,1,33077,jonathan_shapiro,,2422.6,2426.941,I think the regulations could properly require such a statement.
1984.83-1329,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2430.964,2432.484,I'm not challenging that.
1984.83-1329,1,33077,jonathan_shapiro,,2432.484,2439.288,The Petitioner has never challenged the relevance of the witnesses.
1984.83-1329,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2442.551,2454.259,The State would hardly question the idea that the inmate must identify and state the testimony that would be given if the witness appeared.
1984.83-1329,1,33077,jonathan_shapiro,,2454.259,2456.951,--I think that would be a reasonable requirement.
1984.83-1329,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2470.802,2482.637,"In your view of the Superior Court's decision, the Superior Court would have had no occasion to set aside the regulations because the regulations weren't inconsistent with the reasoning of the Superior Court."
1984.83-1329,1,33077,jonathan_shapiro,,2482.637,2483.718,That's correct.
1984.83-1329,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2533.811,2536.743,"Well, but that's the basis that the Supreme Judicial Court decided it."
1984.83-1329,1,33077,jonathan_shapiro,,2536.743,2538.573,--That is one of the bases.
1984.83-1329,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2540.285,2542.226,In the Supreme Judicial Court's opinion?
1984.83-1329,1,33077,jonathan_shapiro,,2542.226,2543.017,--Yes.
1984.83-1329,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2555.786,2559.737,"Well, it affirmed the judgment for the reasons given by the Supreme Judicial Court."
1984.83-1329,1,33077,jonathan_shapiro,,2559.737,2588.008,"And also earlier in the opinion, the portion of the opinion referred to by Justice Stevens on page 16, where the court in defining the issue presented, indicates that the question is whether federal due process requirements impose a duty on the Board to explain in any fashion at the hearing or later, why witnesses were not allowed to testify."
1984.83-1329,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2761.791,2783.786,"Mr. Shapiro, what about Justice O'Connor's suggestion made to your opponent, that perhaps there should be reasons at least adduced in the habeas corpus hearing, but that perhaps those reasons should be submitted in camera to the judge just because of the very volatility of the prison situation?"
1984.83-1329,1,33077,jonathan_shapiro,,2783.786,2793.943,"We think that where the Commonwealth makes a showing that that is a consideration in the case, that would be appropriate."
1984.83-1329,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3306.931,3324.973,"That would be pretty coincidental, though, wouldn't it, when the record happened to support because of the testimony of other witnesses or something else, the refusal of the... or due to the record, supplied the reasons for the prison officials' refusal to call the witness."
1984.83-1329,1,33077,jonathan_shapiro,,3324.973,3326.515,I don't think it would be coincidental.
1984.83-1329,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3361.748,3367.111,Was the written record of the administrative proceeding produced in the Superior Court in this case?
1984.83-1329,1,33077,jonathan_shapiro,,3367.111,3404.347,"The written record of the hearing consists of the disciplinary charge, and these are set forth in the Appendix to this case, the disciplinary report which is on page 13-A of the Appendix, the report of the testimony and who testified on 14-A, the decision of the Board on 15-A, the appeal and the decision of the Superintendent affirming the conviction of the inmate."
1984.83-1329,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3404.347,3410.11,"So at least the administrative report, as it's now done in Massachusetts, doesn't have a transcript of testimony."
1984.83-1329,1,33077,jonathan_shapiro,,3410.11,3410.982,There is no transcript.
1984.83-1329,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3410.982,3422.318,"Well, how could a report of the dimensions of, say, that on page 14-A ever, except by sheerest coincidence, support a conclusion that witnesses shouldn't be allowed?"
1984.83-1329,1,33077,jonathan_shapiro,,3422.318,3438.419,Very often the description of the offense in the disciplinary report is more than necessary to indicate what the case is about and what the evidence is likely to be.
1984.83-1329,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3476.865,3479.937,Didn't Wolff... do I recall Wolff right?
1984.83-1329,1,33077,jonathan_shapiro,,3494.149,3495.037,Yes.
1984.83-1329,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3496.309,3515.76,"Well, would it be enough to satisfy the Constitution, in your view, if the Superintendent said, or the decision-maker in the prison said we deny these witnesses because in our view, calling these witnesses would jeopardize institutional safety, period?"
1984.83-1329,1,33077,jonathan_shapiro,,3515.76,3516.191,No.
1984.83-1329,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3521.594,3526.78,They then have to explain their judgment that institutional safety would be--
1984.83-1329,1,33077,jonathan_shapiro,,3526.78,3528.76,I think so.
1984.83-1329,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3534.885,3535.576,"--No, it wouldn't be meaningless."
1984.83-1329,1,33077,jonathan_shapiro,,3548.372,3554.847,"--I think that standard is so broad, that effectively it would not only insulate--"
1984.83-1329,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3554.847,3565.125,So a court would have to decide whether that institutional decision was rational or not.
1984.83-1329,1,33077,jonathan_shapiro,,3565.125,3570.999,"--And I think that is because of this Court's decision in Wolff, that a court would be obligated to do that."
1984.83-1329,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3570.999,3582.647,"Yeah, but Wolff didn't say that... Wolff gave the standard, but it didn't say that the official had to explain it in detail."
1984.83-1329,1,33077,jonathan_shapiro,,3582.647,3597.786,"I think to the extent that Wolff recognizes a right to call witnesses, that right, in order to be meaningful, it's implicit that there has to be at least a limited judicial review."
1984.83-1329,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3604.07,3615.127,"Well, it isn't entirely a fruitless matter to inquire whether you knew what the law was and whether you applied the right standard in denying."
1984.83-1329,1,33077,jonathan_shapiro,,3617.038,3619.719,I think it would mean--
1984.83-1329,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3619.719,3636.429,"And at least the official could evidence that he knew what the law was and give his opinion that we looked at the evidence, we looked at the situation and thought that the witnesses could be denied under the standard."
1984.83-1329,1,33077,jonathan_shapiro,,3636.429,3650.441,--I don't think that simply responding that institutional security would be endangered does sufficiently indicate that the official knows what the law is and is applying it.
1984.83-1329,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3659.627,3663.187,"Do you have anything further, Mr. Levin?"
1984.83-1329,2,36181,martin_e_levin,,3663.187,3667.63,"Your Honor, just to address Justice White's question."
1984.83-1329,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3689.714,3700.193,Is there any... can you point to anyplace in the record where the State explained why it did not permit him to call these witnesses?
1984.83-1329,2,36181,martin_e_levin,,3700.193,3702.964,--There is no explanation of that expressly in the record.
1984.83-1329,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3705.865,3706.797,"Thank you, gentlemen."
