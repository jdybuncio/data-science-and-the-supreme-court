1968.258,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,12.988,"Number 258, Morris H. Kramer versus Union Free School District No. 15, et al."
1968.258,0,37445,osmond_k_fraenkel,,13.261,16.566,May it please the Court.
1968.258,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,271.702,282.536,"Mr. Fraenkel, the statute provides that only people with these qualifications shall be entitled to vote at any school meeting."
1968.258,0,37445,osmond_k_fraenkel,,285.972,286.501,Yes.
1968.258,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,286.501,287.826,"Are these ballots, secret ballots --"
1968.258,0,37445,osmond_k_fraenkel,,287.826,288.137,"No, there are meetings."
1968.258,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,288.137,288.635,And ballot box voting?
1968.258,0,37445,osmond_k_fraenkel,,288.635,289.614,There are meetings.
1968.258,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,289.614,290.828,We're just talking about meetings.
1968.258,0,37445,osmond_k_fraenkel,,290.828,301.235,There are meetings at which the members of the school board are elected at the denominations made by a certain number of qualified electors.
1968.258,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,310.976,311.537,Having to do with schools?
1968.258,0,37445,osmond_k_fraenkel,,311.537,314.725,"Out of state, out of the district and things of that sort."
1968.258,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,314.725,319.207,And so these are actually meetings and what we're -- are they public meetings?
1968.258,0,37445,osmond_k_fraenkel,,320.573,321.837,"So far as I know, yes."
1968.258,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,321.837,322.918,And only these people can vote.
1968.258,0,37445,osmond_k_fraenkel,,322.918,324.306,Only these people can vote.
1968.258,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,324.306,328.084,And how often do these meetings held?
1968.258,0,37445,osmond_k_fraenkel,,328.084,329.332,That I don't know.
1968.258,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,333.49,334.466,So we're -- so this statute --
1968.258,0,37445,osmond_k_fraenkel,,334.466,339.548,Actually being a resident of the City of New York and I'm not too familiar with what goes on in the suburbs.
1968.258,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,339.548,341.635,And this does not involve ballot box voting?
1968.258,0,37445,osmond_k_fraenkel,,341.635,342.23,No.
1968.258,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,342.23,344.982,It involves voting in an open meeting.
1968.258,0,37445,osmond_k_fraenkel,,344.982,345.695,That's right.
1968.258,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,345.695,349.485,Which people did you say up a minute ago?
1968.258,0,37445,osmond_k_fraenkel,,349.485,352.13,Roughly taxpayers and parents.
1968.258,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,362.06,363.202,What about people under 21?
1968.258,0,37445,osmond_k_fraenkel,,363.202,366.431,And to parents of children attending school.
1968.258,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,371.356,372.115,Children under 21?
1968.258,0,37445,osmond_k_fraenkel,,372.115,372.827,Citizens and so on.
1968.258,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,372.827,374.397,People under 21 vote?
1968.258,0,37445,osmond_k_fraenkel,,374.397,376.383,"No, not in New York."
1968.258,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,376.383,377.561,I mean in these elections.
1968.258,0,37445,osmond_k_fraenkel,,377.561,378.685,"No, no."
1968.258,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,445.073,450.79,"But we're not talking about a right to vote -- it's provided by a federal law, are we?"
1968.258,0,37445,osmond_k_fraenkel,,450.79,458.032,"No, we're dealing here only with the question of equal protection, whether this is an improper discrimination by the state."
1968.258,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,461.895,463.05,Or any constitutional --
1968.258,0,37445,osmond_k_fraenkel,,463.05,465.435,Or any constitutional issue.
1968.258,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,490.648,497.065,"You assume the burden here I take it, of approving an invidious discrimination of the plaintiff."
1968.258,0,37445,osmond_k_fraenkel,,497.065,498.781,Yes and no.
1968.258,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,520.996,529.481,Do you have any cases for that except in areas where a certain particular interests are involved?
1968.258,0,37445,osmond_k_fraenkel,,529.481,537.496,"Well, of course, the most recent application of it was in the Williams-Rhodes case."
1968.258,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,541.068,541.989,That's right.
1968.258,0,37445,osmond_k_fraenkel,,541.989,549.389,"And for that reason, this Court may have -- I may be permitted to say so stretch a little."
1968.258,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,558.291,561.813,"That is a normal equal protection law, is it?"
1968.258,0,37445,osmond_k_fraenkel,,561.813,571.908,"Well, the normal equal protection law deals mostly with taxation and routine things of that sort."
1968.258,1,31107,john_p_jehu,,1597.04,1600.504,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1968.258,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1749.282,1753.536,A statute seems to refer only to meetings.
1968.258,1,31107,john_p_jehu,,1753.536,1754.765,"Well, it says --"
1968.258,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1754.765,1755.782,Does it or am I mistaken?
1968.258,1,31107,john_p_jehu,,1755.782,1757.298,It may well be so Your Honor.
1968.258,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1760.334,1762.731,Because it will be entitled of other school meeting.
1968.258,1,31107,john_p_jehu,,1768.88,1776.097,The statute itself I think is set forth in the opinion of the Court below.
1968.258,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1789.686,1795.875,I'd be quite interested in seeing the statutes or having a reference to him.
1968.258,1,31107,john_p_jehu,,1795.875,1797.447,Page 2 of the appellant's brief.
1968.258,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1839.529,1848.184,"Well, at least, you say this statute which seems to refer only to school meetings would mean applicable to voting by voting machine?"
1968.258,1,31107,john_p_jehu,,1848.184,1853.186,"It is modified for other sections of the Education Law, Your Honor, yes."
1968.258,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1853.186,1859.619,I understand this law doesn't -- is not applicable at all to two-thirds of the people in the state.
1968.258,1,31107,john_p_jehu,,1859.619,1861.716,That's correct Your Honor and in the so-called --
1968.258,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1861.716,1864.979,It's not applicable in the big cities and it's not applicable to the smallest.
1968.258,1,31107,john_p_jehu,,1864.979,1873.982,"The smaller cities, that's correct and between the two groups of city school districts as more than two-thirds of the population of the states, some 11 million people by the 1960 census."
1968.258,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1887.646,1906.658,"Could you, forgive me sir, but would you be so kind as to tell us as specifically and precisely as possible just what are the matters brought before the school meetings on which these qualified people vote."
1968.258,1,31107,john_p_jehu,,1906.658,1908.058,"Yes, Your Honor."
1968.258,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1979.813,2005.175,"No, not -- I'm sorry but it doesn't quite because it is a complicated Education Law and I'm interested in finding out just as precisely as I can and with as little possibility of error as can be managed just what this voting right is often concerning?"
1968.258,1,31107,john_p_jehu,,2025.858,2027.044,"Correct, Your Honor."
1968.258,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2027.044,2046.213,"And what I would like to know is whether they're -- just what the specific subjects are as to which Mr. Fraenkel's client claims, he should be entitled to vote and I haven't found that in any of the papers before us."
1968.258,1,31107,john_p_jehu,,2051.349,2059.306,"Well, Section 2021 Your Honor consists of some 20 or 30 subdivisions which indicate the powers of the voters."
1968.258,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2139.18,2148.601,"There's a text to which the -- which may be levied by the school district, solely a tax upon real property."
1968.258,1,31107,john_p_jehu,,2148.601,2149.488,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1968.258,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2149.597,2151.853,Where does that appear in the statute?
1968.258,1,31107,john_p_jehu,,2151.853,2152.477,Excuse me sir?
1968.258,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2152.477,2162.912,"I've just gotten a copy of a statute brought to me and the statute does not indicate that it has to be a real property tax, does it?"
1968.258,1,31107,john_p_jehu,,2162.912,2179.832,"Well, the tax provisions were taken out of the state Education Law many years ago and put into the Real Property Tax Law and they would be in Article 13 of the Real Property Tax Law has all the different provisions but all they have is a power to levy a tax on real property."
1968.258,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2183.775,2187.195,you can't tell me anything in this law that --
1968.258,1,31107,john_p_jehu,,2187.195,2189.428,"In the Education Law, Your Honor?"
1968.258,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2189.428,2201.497,Anything in the law that confirms the tax power of the school meetings that we're talking about to the levying of real estate taxes.
1968.258,1,31107,john_p_jehu,,2201.497,2204.078,"Well, as I indicate Your Honor, this is no longer in the education law."
1968.258,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2206.652,2208.678,I'm looking Section 2021.
1968.258,1,31107,john_p_jehu,,2213.558,2214.243,"Well, the powers of the meeting basically --"
1968.258,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2214.243,2216.234,That's what I'm trying to find out.
1968.258,1,31107,john_p_jehu,,2216.234,2216.722,Are to --
1968.258,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2216.722,2218.607,When it comes to the power to tax --
1968.258,1,31107,john_p_jehu,,2218.607,2219.08,Yes.
1968.258,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2219.08,2228.335,I want to know specifically in terms of the statute whether the taxing power is limited to the levying of tax on real property.
1968.258,1,31107,john_p_jehu,,2244.912,2245.816,Right.
1968.258,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2266.662,2273.735,Does the state have had any of its tax receipts to school districts for their operation?
1968.258,1,31107,john_p_jehu,,2273.735,2281.154,The operations of the school districts of the state are financed basically from the school tax which is a real property tax.
1968.258,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2299.105,2303.211,"I suppose, do you have a sales tax?"
1968.258,1,31107,john_p_jehu,,2303.211,2303.357,There are --
1968.258,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2303.357,2304.02,Do you have a sales tax?
1968.258,1,31107,john_p_jehu,,2304.02,2310.883,"We have a state sales tax now, that's correct which is also is part of that and they have local sales tax just like in New York City and some of the counties have sales taxes."
1968.258,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2310.883,2311.946,Yes.
1968.258,1,31107,john_p_jehu,,2311.946,2329.318,"But all these things go into the state budget and before that budget is made up, a new formula is made up, state aid formula is made up almost every year, and that formula determines how much the taxes will have to be brought into the State Conference in order to cover the various expenses including education."
1968.258,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2329.318,2337.549,"Well, do these people who are deprived of voting under this law have to pay those state taxes?"
1968.258,1,31107,john_p_jehu,,2337.549,2337.681,Oh!
1968.258,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2339.854,2346.413,"Then they do -- then they do contribute with their tax moneys to the support of these schools, do they not?"
1968.258,1,31107,john_p_jehu,,2346.413,2350.255,"And the main part if it please Chief Justice, my argument is this --"
1968.258,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2350.255,2351.839,"No, I'm not interested in your argument."
1968.258,1,31107,john_p_jehu,,2352.316,2353.233,"No, on this point is what I mean."
1968.258,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2353.233,2362.335,I just like to ask you if they are obliged to pay state taxes that are used to operate the schools.
1968.258,1,31107,john_p_jehu,,2362.335,2385.723,That's absolutely correct and some of their federal taxes go into that picture but what I'm getting at is that he has never lost and does not now lose his franchise on state legislation which determines how much of his tax money goes into the education system and he has not lost his franchise to elect a senator of the United States or congressman who would in turn determine how much federal money goes back to the states for schools.
1968.258,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2392.156,2404.22,"Well, it might determine how much he would be willing to put in to the local budget and wouldn't it depending on how much he used to get from the state?"
1968.258,1,31107,john_p_jehu,,2404.22,2404.729,No.
1968.258,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2404.729,2405.494,Why?
1968.258,1,31107,john_p_jehu,,2405.494,2406.49,As I say the --
1968.258,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2406.49,2406.886,Why?
1968.258,1,31107,john_p_jehu,,2406.886,2417.581,"This -- the whole state aide formula is the most complicated kind of a machinery and what the voters do, they merely authorize that district to spend, shall we say, $5 million for their schools."
1968.258,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2417.581,2417.966,Yes.
1968.258,1,31107,john_p_jehu,,2417.966,2429.041,"And that that authorization to spend then has to be covered by an estimate of how much state aid will they get, how much federal aid will they get, how much will they get from other various source of income such tuition and so forth."
1968.258,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2434.841,2435.93,Yes.
1968.258,1,31107,john_p_jehu,,2456.5,2458.877,"Well, the vote Your Honor is not on the total amount."
1968.258,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2462.059,2468.005,"I know but he might say in view of the subventions from a state, we don't need these things."
1968.258,1,31107,john_p_jehu,,2468.005,2468.125,Oh!
1968.258,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2471.426,2485.943,"Alright, well then, doesn't the person who pays the state taxes also have an interest in how much he will provide for the district, for school purposes?"
1968.258,1,31107,john_p_jehu,,2485.943,2487.145,I don't think Your Honor.
1968.258,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2499.401,2506.422,Well why do you give the right to vote to the taxpayers who are owners of property?
1968.258,1,31107,john_p_jehu,,2506.422,2507.205,"Well, may I explain --"
1968.258,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2507.205,2508.602,What is the reason for that?
1968.258,1,31107,john_p_jehu,,2508.602,2509.713,May I explain this.
1968.258,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2509.713,2513.616,Would I assume it's because they're interested in how their money is spent?
1968.258,1,31107,john_p_jehu,,2514.991,2516.557,This may well be one of the reasons.
1968.258,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2516.557,2521.713,Well why exclude the bachelor who might be the highest taxpayer in the country?
1968.258,1,31107,john_p_jehu,,2521.713,2524.103,Because he is not a member of the community of interest.
1968.258,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2524.103,2527.433,And because he's not interested what happens to his tax money?
1968.258,1,31107,john_p_jehu,,2527.433,2528.996,No.
1968.258,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2529.449,2532.344,Suppose the law said only republicans can vote.
1968.258,1,31107,john_p_jehu,,2532.344,2534.426,"No, that would be an invidious discrimination."
1968.258,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2534.426,2535.657,Why?
1968.258,1,31107,john_p_jehu,,2535.657,2542.265,Because there is no relation between the purpose of the statutory objective of the legislature and the way they're doing it.
1968.258,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2543.097,2548.569,Then what is the relationship for excluding a bachelor?
1968.258,1,31107,john_p_jehu,,2548.569,2551.383,"Well, he's not being excluded because he's a bachelor"
1968.258,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2553.264,2556.001,He's excluded because he's not married.
1968.258,1,31107,john_p_jehu,,2556.001,2561.192,"No, he is excluded because he has absolutely no interest in the operations of the school system."
1968.258,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2561.192,2561.714,Why not?
1968.258,1,31107,john_p_jehu,,2561.714,2564.691,"His children are not affected because he has no children, whatever --"
1968.258,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2564.691,2566.687,His money is.
1968.258,1,31107,john_p_jehu,,2566.687,2568.61,"Just a moment, if I may Your Honor."
1968.258,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2596.302,2605.691,But if he was a bachelor and a pauper but a tenant he could vote?
1968.258,1,31107,john_p_jehu,,2605.691,2608.039,"He could vote, absolutely."
1968.258,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2608.039,2610.056,"Now, what interest does that in anyone?"
1968.258,1,31107,john_p_jehu,,2610.056,2610.782,"Well, they --"
1968.258,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2610.782,2617.307,This bachelor who's broke and just happened to be a tenant --
1968.258,1,31107,john_p_jehu,,2617.307,2618.43,Right.
1968.258,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2618.43,2620.497,"Now, what interest does he have?"
1968.258,1,31107,john_p_jehu,,2620.497,2625.041,"Well, the question really Your Honor is this."
1968.258,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2722.586,2725.73,Let me ask you this question.
1968.258,1,31107,john_p_jehu,,2747.887,2749.71,May I make two answers to that Your Honor.
1968.258,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2771.096,2775.546,"Well, let me ask you just one more question along that line."
1968.258,1,31107,john_p_jehu,,2814.635,2832.266,"I would say Your Honor that they're properly excluded here because the parents themselves is the -- if they have the children, the people you're talking about whose grandchildren do have the franchise but the interest of these other people is purely theoretical just like I have a tremendous interest in good education in Mississippi right now."
1968.258,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2832.266,2835.519,"No, I'm talking about this specific case."
1968.258,1,31107,john_p_jehu,,2839.076,2842.384,Unless he is assessed for a school tax.
1968.258,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2855.67,2857.819,"Well, that perhaps, I would ask just one more question."
1968.258,1,31107,john_p_jehu,,2871.703,2873.92,"Your Honor, isn't it the question of payment of taxes."
1968.258,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2881.806,2890.254,"Well, let's say assessed unless he assessed for that much, you could put a limit on the amount of taxes he pays."
1968.258,1,31107,john_p_jehu,,2890.254,2900.52,If that did that Your Honor we will run into harbor and properly so that would be impermissible because wealth as you had pointed out in harbor has no relation to the use of the franchise.
1968.258,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2949.57,2961.495,"In connection, I would be very interested in having a citation of authority for your submission that the power to tax is only the power to impose taxes on real property."
1968.258,1,31107,john_p_jehu,,2963.135,2964.967,I would indeed sir.
1968.258,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2964.967,2967.033,We'll recess now.
1968.258,1,31107,john_p_jehu,,2967.033,2979.747,I will supply the Court with copies or texts of the relevant sections of the education and other laws dealing with various questions which have been raised during the argument.
1968.258,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2979.747,2980.389,That would be very helpful.
1968.258,1,31107,john_p_jehu,,2980.389,2982.278,I would like to do that sometime next week.
1968.258,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2982.278,2985.838,That would be very helpful.
