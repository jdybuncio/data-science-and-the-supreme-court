1987.87-352,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,12.308,"We will hear arguments next in Number 87-352, Sun Oil Company versus Richard Wortman and Hazel Moore."
1987.87-352,0,26036,gerald_sawatzky,,20.395,77.916,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the questions presented in this case are, first, whether the full faith and credit clause and the due process clause require Kansas, a quorum state, to apply the limitations laws of the States of Texas, Oklahoma, and Louisiana, where the claims arose in favor of class members residing in those states, and secondly, whether Kansas has failed in this case to apply the interest laws of those same states to those claims as required by this Court's decision in Phillips Petroleum Company versus Shutts, which was an identical case to this one except it did not involve the limitations issue."
1987.87-352,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,272.291,275.76,"Mr. Sawatzky, may I ask you a question?"
1987.87-352,0,26036,gerald_sawatzky,,295.507,302.311,"--Your Honor, the... I think I--"
1987.87-352,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,302.311,314.468,Do they... have you cited any authority that would indicate to us that those states regard their statutes of limitations as substantive rather than procedural?
1987.87-352,0,26036,gerald_sawatzky,,314.468,316.32,"--No, Your Honor."
1987.87-352,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,365.42,384.132,"Well, I can imagine certainly that a particular state could make a determination for itself that it wanted to treat a particular statute of limitations as substantive, but absent that, I wonder whether we should assume that it is."
1987.87-352,0,26036,gerald_sawatzky,,384.132,418.888,"I think that in applying the constitution, Your Honor, we must look at what a statute of limitations does to a party and to a claim, and because of the history, the common law history by which this common law fiction arose, a fiction that limitations goes to the remedy and not to the right, which arose way back in McLemoyle versus Cohen."
1987.87-352,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,446.389,450.507,"Well, that certainly wasn't the holding of this Court in the Wells case, was it?"
1987.87-352,0,26036,gerald_sawatzky,,450.507,451.359,"No, it wasn't."
1987.87-352,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,462.382,470.119,"Well, Justice Jackson certainly put forward an argument in his opinion in that case."
1987.87-352,0,26036,gerald_sawatzky,,470.119,470.586,Yes.
1987.87-352,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,470.586,472.404,"But it didn't carry the day, did it?"
1987.87-352,0,26036,gerald_sawatzky,,472.404,486.08,"It didn't carry the day, Your Honor, because the majority opinion in Wells simply rotely adopted the old McLemoyle line of cases, and if you look back at McLemoyle, likewise it did not analyze the question."
1987.87-352,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,588.179,594.033,Do you think we have to overrule a whole string of cases to hold for you on this?
1987.87-352,0,26036,gerald_sawatzky,,594.033,595.966,"--I don't really think you have to, Your Honor."
1987.87-352,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,597.735,598.101,"Just ignore them, or what?"
1987.87-352,0,26036,gerald_sawatzky,,598.101,608.357,"--I think it would be the best thing that this Court could do to overrule them, because it is an old English common law fiction which has been applied without discrimination."
1987.87-352,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,608.357,612.995,"Well, don't you have a Court of Appeals case on your side?"
1987.87-352,0,26036,gerald_sawatzky,,612.995,614.245,"Yes, we do."
1987.87-352,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,615.446,616.529,The Third Circuit?
1987.87-352,0,26036,gerald_sawatzky,,616.529,617.279,The Third Circuit.
1987.87-352,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,617.279,618.481,What did they say?
1987.87-352,0,26036,gerald_sawatzky,,618.481,636.443,"They said that constitutionally under the full faith and credit clause and the due process clause in particular, the common rule in effect, the common law rule should be disregarded because one state should apply the law of another state."
1987.87-352,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,636.443,642.514,They must have felt that there weren't any cases and this Court finding them that would hold otherwise.
1987.87-352,0,26036,gerald_sawatzky,,642.514,650.47,"Well, I think, Your Honor, you are coming to one aspect of my case."
1987.87-352,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,679.287,684.757,Do you think in some of the old cases did that very situation obtain?
1987.87-352,0,26036,gerald_sawatzky,,700.783,701.233,"Well, yes."
1987.87-352,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,701.8,702.317,Had they?
1987.87-352,0,26036,gerald_sawatzky,,703.269,712.24,"--There had absolutely been no cases discussing, analyzing the due process clause in connection with this problem."
1987.87-352,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,718.728,722.013,"So it's the constitutional issue that Hustler reserved, you think?"
1987.87-352,0,26036,gerald_sawatzky,,722.013,726.334,--It is perfectly open and right here for this Court in this case.
1987.87-352,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,726.334,733.738,How is the due process argument different from the full faith and credit argument?
1987.87-352,0,26036,gerald_sawatzky,,733.738,773.831,"Well, you look at the due process analysis in the Shutts case itself and in the cases cited by Shutts, and that is that parties are entitled to expect that their activities and their rights and legal obligations will be governed by laws of the jurisdiction where they undertake their activities, and where the alleged wrong or the breach occurs, and that this lends predictability to the law, and this is an element of the fairness incorporated in and an absolute part of the due process clause."
1987.87-352,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,783.504,787.123,Predictability is important when you are going to govern your actions by it.
1987.87-352,0,26036,gerald_sawatzky,,787.123,788.407,"--Absolutely, Your Honor."
1987.87-352,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,788.407,794.561,But how do you govern your actions differently if you know that there is a five-year statute of limitations rather than a nine-year one?
1987.87-352,0,26036,gerald_sawatzky,,799.779,819.509,"The statute of limitations, as this Court has pointed out many times and is generally recognized, is a statute of repose that gives people certainty in their affairs, and if you want to go to a state and conduct your activities with a limitation of two or three years instead of five of six years, that is your option."
1987.87-352,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,819.509,833.686,--Do you think anybody ever conducted affairs in one state versus another because they knew they had a shorter statute... do people really advert to statutes of limitations when they conduct their primary conduct?
1987.87-352,0,26036,gerald_sawatzky,,834.219,841.458,"Well, I don't think anybody has made a study out of it, Your Honor, but that is one of the elements that goes into your expectancy."
1987.87-352,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,841.458,844.994,"Part of a favorable climate for business, perhaps?"
1987.87-352,0,26036,gerald_sawatzky,,844.994,860.603,"Well, the point is, though, that in any action there are affirmative defenses, let's say unclean hands or something else."
1987.87-352,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,885.987,915.69,"But one can certainly make the argument in the case of the statute of limitations that the primary interest it serves is that of a state, the state's court system in not trying to process stale claims which are very difficult to figure out who is right and who is wrong, and that if Texas feels they want a shorter statute of limitations, it is a state interest there that is being vindicated, but if the Kansas court system feels they don't have that same reservation, then why not let Kansas apply its longer statute?"
1987.87-352,0,26036,gerald_sawatzky,,915.69,920.392,"Of course, in our case, you understand, Kansas supplied its longer statute, not a shorter statute--"
1987.87-352,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,920.392,920.758,Yes.
1987.87-352,0,26036,gerald_sawatzky,,920.758,945.942,"--to bar something, and so this argument technically would not apply, but... and so I wouldn't need to rebut that particular argument, but I think from the standpoint of logic and common sense, this argument which has been made does not bear analysis, because the interest as far as stale claims is concerned, the parties are interested in it."
1987.87-352,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1046.225,1052.129,"And that... taking it both ways, whether the forum state statute is longer or shorter."
1987.87-352,0,26036,gerald_sawatzky,,1052.129,1052.762,That is correct.
1987.87-352,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1074.125,1074.891,May I interrupt--
1987.87-352,0,26036,gerald_sawatzky,,1074.891,1075.641,"--Yes, sir."
1987.87-352,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1075.641,1078.327,--just to go back to Professor Loeffler's article?
1987.87-352,0,26036,gerald_sawatzky,,1083.646,1091.836,"His function and his role, Your Honor, was in the conflict of laws area, and was proposing that as a uniform rule."
1987.87-352,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1091.836,1098.656,I have a vague recollection that he is very reluctant to constitutionalize the law of conflicts of laws.
1987.87-352,0,26036,gerald_sawatzky,,1098.656,1119.92,"But if you read the article and read the study, and similar scholars, and conclude, Your Honor, that this is substantive, that they are correct in saying it is substantive, once you say it is substantive, our constitution requires us to apply it in that manner."
1987.87-352,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1124.273,1140.833,"Mr. Sawatzky, what do you do with Texas itself says when it enacts its statute of limitations: the reason we have these statute of limitations is, we don't think our courts can find the facts very accurately or efficiently when the claims are older than this."
1987.87-352,0,26036,gerald_sawatzky,,1161.314,1163.033,"--I would still say, Your Honor, that that would apply."
1987.87-352,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1178.208,1178.624,It is in the statute.
1987.87-352,0,26036,gerald_sawatzky,,1178.891,1179.891,--In the statute.
1987.87-352,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1393.762,1413.407,"--Where I don't follow you, Mr. Sawatzky, is, I don't see how we can tell a state that its statute of limitations must be substantive, and once you accept that then your scheme doesn't give us any more certainty that the existing scheme."
1987.87-352,0,26036,gerald_sawatzky,,1423.448,1443.077,"If a state were to design a statute of limitations so that it would bear a real relationship to lost evidence and to stale claims and which could demonstrably improve the administration of cases in this Court, that might be one thing."
1987.87-352,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1482.82,1492.692,"How do you get different statutes of limitations in the same state, depending on whether it is personal injury, trespass to real property, personal property, that sort of thing?"
1987.87-352,0,26036,gerald_sawatzky,,1492.692,1498.746,--This again is a combination of objects by the state.
1987.87-352,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1744.791,1751.879,"Is there an interest argument here, what rate of interest?"
1987.87-352,0,26036,gerald_sawatzky,,1751.879,1753.062,"Yes, there is."
1987.87-352,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1753.062,1754.481,Are you going to leave that to your brief?
1987.87-352,0,26036,gerald_sawatzky,,1754.481,1757.366,"I am going to argue that right now, Your Honor."
1987.87-352,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1759.551,1760.418,That's a good idea.
1987.87-352,0,26036,gerald_sawatzky,,1760.418,1775.81,Because the Kansas court on remand after being directed by this Court to look to the laws of these other states... I will mention Texas as a prime example.
1987.87-352,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1847.574,1848.709,And the rate?
1987.87-352,0,26036,gerald_sawatzky,,1848.709,1857.798,"The rate that Kansas found was the federal rate, a rate that ranged up to 18 to 20 percent."
1987.87-352,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1857.798,1860.833,And they thought the Texas courts would apply that?
1987.87-352,0,26036,gerald_sawatzky,,1860.833,1864.885,"Yes, they did."
1987.87-352,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1864.885,1868.254,"Thank you, Mr. Sawatzky."
1987.87-352,1,25904,gordon_penny,,1870.106,1892.971,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, I believe the Court granted certiorari in this case to consider these interesting and important choice of law questions, and they are difficult and subtle, and they should not be regarded lightly."
1987.87-352,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1973.174,1977.827,"Well, Mr. Penny, with all respect, I didn't think that was why we took the case."
1987.87-352,1,25904,gordon_penny,,1992.67,1994.503,"I believe you are right, Justice O'Connor."
1987.87-352,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1995.539,1997.172,So do you plan to talk about those?
1987.87-352,1,25904,gordon_penny,,1997.172,1997.855,"Yes, I do."
1987.87-352,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1997.855,2014.917,"While I have you interrupted, what if Texas, for example, passed a law that made it crystal clear it considered its shorter statute of limitations to be substantive?"
1987.87-352,1,25904,gordon_penny,,2022.106,2037.132,"Yes, I do, Justice O'Connor, if Kansas did not have enough other contacts with the litigation to make its application of its own statute of limitations reasonable."
1987.87-352,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2262.895,2276.238,"Of course, by that standard you would never be able to overrule any case that says old process is due process, in effect, because people are used to living under that regimen."
1987.87-352,1,25904,gordon_penny,,2276.238,2280.024,Well--
1987.87-352,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2280.024,2281.624,Perhaps that is not a disadvantage.
1987.87-352,1,25904,gordon_penny,,2281.624,2284.911,--It is not a disadvantage as far as I am concerned.
1987.87-352,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2294.1,2298.136,And others.
1987.87-352,1,25904,gordon_penny,,2298.136,2302.539,You say and others?
1987.87-352,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2302.539,2303.205,"And others, yes."
1987.87-352,1,25904,gordon_penny,,2303.205,2304.022,"Oh, I see."
1987.87-352,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2559.988,2564.856,That is a plaintiff's state.
1987.87-352,1,25904,gordon_penny,,2564.856,2566.308,"Excuse me, sir?"
1987.87-352,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2566.308,2567.958,That's a plaintiff's state.
1987.87-352,1,25904,gordon_penny,,2567.958,2569.177,Apparently so.
1987.87-352,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2794.356,2800.26,"Well, you had here a Texas case that had used the lower interest figure, didn't you?"
1987.87-352,1,25904,gordon_penny,,2800.26,2800.86,"--Yes, sir."
1987.87-352,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2800.86,2807.43,"And in the face of that the Kansas court said, no, the next time around they are going to use a higher one."
1987.87-352,1,25904,gordon_penny,,2807.43,2817.22,"Yes, the Stahl case was... which did apply 6 percent interest, was an unusual case."
1987.87-352,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2907.295,2910.045,Those are personal injury cases you are referring to.
1987.87-352,1,25904,gordon_penny,,2910.045,2911.33,"Yes, sir, personal injury."
1987.87-352,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3053.772,3059.926,A little bit off the mark?
1987.87-352,1,25904,gordon_penny,,3059.926,3064.978,I would say that the prediction missed by some amount.
1987.87-352,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3155.654,3157.839,So the Kansas court was a little bit wrong.
1987.87-352,1,25904,gordon_penny,,3163.676,3188.109,"Well, Your Honor, I think probably the way to finality of judgments is to affirm if a good faith effort was made by the Court to arrive at what the other state's court law is."
1987.87-352,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3188.109,3189.425,Or would be?
1987.87-352,1,25904,gordon_penny,,3189.425,3190.911,Right.
1987.87-352,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3190.911,3197.564,At the time of this judgment was the Louisiana law the way you say it is now?
1987.87-352,1,25904,gordon_penny,,3197.564,3201.701,"Yes, it was."
1987.87-352,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3208.272,3209.905,"Well, they just didn't look at the Louisiana Code then."
1987.87-352,1,25904,gordon_penny,,3209.905,3211.974,--No.
1987.87-352,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3216.128,3217.428,How about Texas?
1987.87-352,1,25904,gordon_penny,,3217.428,3223.798,"The Texas law, the Cavnar case, I believe, came down in 1985."
1987.87-352,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3223.798,3224.482,It came later.
1987.87-352,1,25904,gordon_penny,,3224.482,3225.167,Yes.
1987.87-352,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3226.15,3229.435,Oklahoma?
1987.87-352,1,25904,gordon_penny,,3229.435,3244.028,--The Texas Supreme Court judgment applying it to all types of cases or really confirming that it applies to all types of cases just came last month.
1987.87-352,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3244.028,3249.663,"Well, the Supreme Court of Kansas opinion is June 8th, 1987."
1987.87-352,1,25904,gordon_penny,,3254.483,3256.169,"Yes, it was after the Cavnar case."
1987.87-352,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3256.169,3257.169,I see.
1987.87-352,1,25904,gordon_penny,,3260.721,3262.589,Okay.
1987.87-352,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3294.127,3298.496,"And the Kansas court just borrowed the federal rules, the federal rate?"
1987.87-352,1,25904,gordon_penny,,3298.496,3300.698,The Kansas court applied the federal rule to--
1987.87-352,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3300.698,3303.483,Saying that these other states would do the same thing.
1987.87-352,1,25904,gordon_penny,,3303.483,3304.133,--Yes.
1987.87-352,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3304.133,3313.106,Is it clear that they would not do that?
1987.87-352,1,25904,gordon_penny,,3329.181,3335.371,"No, I don't think it's... I don't think it's that clear, Justice Scalia."
1987.87-352,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3337.954,3341.156,--You think there is some possibility that they got it entirely right?
1987.87-352,1,25904,gordon_penny,,3341.156,3357.951,"--Yes, I think it was a good faith effort, and I think if one of these cases comes before one of the other courts, Texas, Oklahoma, or Louisiana, I think it's quite likely they would do exactly as the Kansas court did."
1987.87-352,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3357.951,3359.32,In spite of a statute.
1987.87-352,1,25904,gordon_penny,,3359.32,3360.82,Yes.
1987.87-352,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3360.82,3364.439,"In Oklahoma it says, here's the interest rate on overdue royalty."
1987.87-352,1,25904,gordon_penny,,3367.741,3370.075,I think that would make it more difficult.
1987.87-352,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3378.281,3381.65,Have you got a citation for the Oklahoma statute that you didn't have in your brief?
1987.87-352,1,25904,gordon_penny,,3381.65,3384.518,"--Title 52, Section 540."
1987.87-352,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3384.518,3394.91,May I ask if that statute was called to the attention of the Kansas Supreme Court by either party to the litigation?
1987.87-352,1,25904,gordon_penny,,3394.91,3405.682,"It was not, Your Honor, and maybe this is incompetence on our part."
1987.87-352,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3405.682,3409.502,You at least had a theory that the federal rule applied.
1987.87-352,1,25904,gordon_penny,,3409.502,3409.918,Yes.
1987.87-352,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3409.918,3410.251,And they opposed it.
1987.87-352,1,25904,gordon_penny,,3411.351,3413.286,They claimed 6 percent.
1987.87-352,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3420.024,3425.178,But isn't there an issue in here of not only postjudgment but prejudgment interest?
1987.87-352,1,25904,gordon_penny,,3425.178,3426.361,"Yes, sir."
1987.87-352,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3433.949,3438.585,I thought there was some argument that these other states wouldn't give prejudgment interest at all.
1987.87-352,1,25904,gordon_penny,,3438.585,3442.02,"--Yes, there was that claim made."
1987.87-352,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3442.02,3443.139,Well--
1987.87-352,1,25904,gordon_penny,,3443.139,3454.197,"It would be, especially with respect to Oklahoma, the claim was made that there would be no prejudgment interest."
1987.87-352,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3454.197,3457.565,"--That was a common law rule, wasn't it?"
1987.87-352,1,25904,gordon_penny,,3457.565,3458.915,Yes.
1987.87-352,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3468.105,3472.241,May I ask about the Oklahoma statute?
1987.87-352,1,25904,gordon_penny,,3480.162,3482.28,--I was not aware of the statute until yesterday.
1987.87-352,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3482.28,3484.216,"I see, and you don't know whether your opponent was or not?"
1987.87-352,1,25904,gordon_penny,,3484.216,3484.782,No.
1987.87-352,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3490.786,3493.655,What about the Louisiana statute?
1987.87-352,1,25904,gordon_penny,,3493.655,3504.98,--The Louisiana statute was cited by the Kansas court in the Shutts versus Phillips case.
1987.87-352,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3504.98,3506.313,How about in this case?
1987.87-352,1,25904,gordon_penny,,3506.313,3517.27,"In this... the Kansas court's opinion in this case referred... mostly just referred to the Shutts case, which had been decided a month earlier."
1987.87-352,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3517.27,3520.905,"Well, how come they said Louisiana would apply the federal rule?"
1987.87-352,1,25904,gordon_penny,,3520.905,3555.062,"There was a case in Louisiana called Boutte versus Chevron, in which the federal court said, whenever this money is paid out... it was dicta in the case, but the federal court did say, Chevron, you don't have to pay the money out until the rates become final, but when you do pay the money out, you will pay them to the royalty owners at the same... together with the same rate of interest as you are required to by your Federal Power Commission undertaking."
1987.87-352,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3671.097,3672.501,"Thank you, Mr. Penny."
