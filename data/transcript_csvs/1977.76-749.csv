1977.76-749,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,39.599,We will hear arguments next in 76-749 Pfizer Incorporated against Government of India and others.
1977.76-749,0,41731,samuel_w_murphy_jr,,39.599,54.526,Thank you!
1977.76-749,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,54.526,58.614,Mr. Murphy I think you can proceed whenever you are ready.
1977.76-749,0,41731,samuel_w_murphy_jr,,58.614,62.42,Mr. Chief Justice may it please the Court.
1977.76-749,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,570.507,575.463,Mr. Murphy would not your argument require as to overrule Georgia against Evan?
1977.76-749,0,41731,samuel_w_murphy_jr,,575.463,579.437,"No, Justice Stevens we do not think so."
1977.76-749,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,596.823,601.17,But was it a corporation or a person as defined in Section 8 of the Sherman Act?
1977.76-749,0,41731,samuel_w_murphy_jr,,601.17,609.748,"No, my argument Justice Stevens is not that the definitional statutes are conclusive."
1977.76-749,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,684.789,715.182,"Do you see any constitutional objection counsel to having the united states if it elected to enter into conventions or treaties with certain countries granting them the rights the Eighth Circuit has given here, granting it by treaty or convention either on a reciprocal basis or for any reason the Executive Branch and the Congress agreed on?"
1977.76-749,0,41731,samuel_w_murphy_jr,,715.182,729.422,"No Sir, I do not believe I do, and I do not see any reason why Congress had it thought it desirable to do so, or if it should think it is desirable to do so now, could not legislate that result."
1977.76-749,0,41731,samuel_w_murphy_jr,,729.422,736.554,"In other words, if other countries did not grant the same right to the United States then we could deny it to them."
1977.76-749,0,41731,samuel_w_murphy_jr,,736.554,738.406,Yes Sir.
1977.76-749,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,821.438,835.432,"Particularly I suppose with the situation in 1890 recruiting the kingdom of Spain, with whom we are going to war eight years later and the United Kingdom with whom we have almost gone to work 20 years before over the Alabama claim."
1977.76-749,0,41731,samuel_w_murphy_jr,,835.432,837.652,Exactly Sir.
1977.76-749,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,930.956,941.86,"Would it have included in North Vietnam during the recent hostilities, while those hostilities were ongoing?"
1977.76-749,0,41731,samuel_w_murphy_jr,,941.86,952.994,"Well, Your Honor, one of the difficulties with the Eighth Circuit's result is it confers the remedy on a foreign nation whether it is friend or foe."
1977.76-749,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,976.597,982.342,"Well, nothing would have prevented the North Vietnamese from hiring American lawyers to bring such a lawsuit, will it?"
1977.76-749,0,41731,samuel_w_murphy_jr,,982.342,1012.967,"Well, indeed Your Honor one of the complications we had in this litigation was one of the original foreign government plaintiffs was the Republic of Vietnam, and in the midst of the litigation that government disappeared, was swallowed up, by my view, by North Vietnam and the question was presented, should the Vietnam case be dismissed or suspended?"
1977.76-749,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1028.519,1045.655,"In other words a suit of this kind is not barred under the Eighth Circuit opinion if we either have broken-off diplomatic relations or have no diplomatic relations for any reason, they can still sue."
1977.76-749,0,41731,samuel_w_murphy_jr,,1045.655,1060.473,"Well, if we have no diplomatic relations at all Mr. Chief Justice it may be that our Courts would not recognize that government as an entity which would be entitled to sue."
1977.76-749,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1060.473,1069.912,"Well, recognition and the government as such and the presence of diplomatic representatives are not always exactly the same."
1977.76-749,0,41731,samuel_w_murphy_jr,,1069.912,1073.023,"Well, quite so, Sir."
1977.76-749,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1073.023,1084.645,"Mr. Murphy, are any of the petitioning companies in this case subject to the jurisdiction of respondent countries?"
1977.76-749,0,41731,samuel_w_murphy_jr,,1084.645,1086.758,I believe so Justice Powell.
1977.76-749,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1099.963,1103.585,Any of those countries have their proximate equivalent about antitrust laws?
1977.76-749,0,41731,samuel_w_murphy_jr,,1103.585,1105.294,"Yes sir, they do."
1977.76-749,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1109.895,1117.32,Have any suits been brought in those countries against these particular United States covenant?
1977.76-749,0,41731,samuel_w_murphy_jr,,1117.32,1118.505,Not to my knowledge.
1977.76-749,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1138.59,1147.501,Is there any evidence that the United States government would have reciprocal rights to sue in any of these countries?
1977.76-749,0,41731,samuel_w_murphy_jr,,1147.501,1156.396,There is no evidence in this record and I am not sufficiently familiar with the laws of those countries to answer the question.
1977.76-749,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1160.329,1164.102,Very well Mr. Murphy.
1977.76-749,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1164.102,1167.427,Mr. Rigler.
1977.76-749,1,21453,douglas_v_rigler,,1167.427,1171.102,Mr. Chief Justice may it please the Court.
1977.76-749,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1203.555,1208.639,Is there any special significance to your use of the adjective friendly --?
1977.76-749,1,21453,douglas_v_rigler,,1208.639,1209.311,"No there is not, Your Honor."
1977.76-749,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1209.311,1212.646,"-- but Cuba could, Cuba or the --"
1977.76-749,1,21453,douglas_v_rigler,,1212.646,1227.126,"Turning to one of the questions that was just raised, it is our view that without diplomatic relations a foreign government's right to enter the Courts of this country would be governed by rules of comity and that they would not have that privilege extended to them."
1977.76-749,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1235.578,1241.666,"Taiwan could bring a suit, but the other, China could not, is that your suggestion?"
1977.76-749,1,21453,douglas_v_rigler,,1241.666,1245.162,That is my suggestion Mr. Chief Justice.
1977.76-749,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1245.162,1255.804,Does it not that bring the Courts pretty close to getting involved in political questions of the highest magnitude --
1977.76-749,1,21453,douglas_v_rigler,,1255.804,1256.558,I don't believe so Your Honor.
1977.76-749,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1256.558,1259.587,-- to make decisions of that kind?
1977.76-749,1,21453,douglas_v_rigler,,1259.587,1265.993,"I believe the test would be very simple, that is, whether or not we had diplomatic relations with the foreign government."
1977.76-749,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1273.682,1293.3,Do you agree Mr. Murphy that United States could enter into conventions or treaties with other countries granting those sovereigns the right to sue for treble-damages if we have the same right In their Courts?
1977.76-749,2,41731,samuel_w_murphy_jr,,1293.3,1304.548,"Well, it is our position Mr. Chief Justice that the right for foreign governments to sue here is already established so that there would be no necessity for such a treaty."
1977.76-749,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1311.056,1336.425,There would be nothing to prevent the Congress of the United States from -- if the Eighth Circuit opinion should stand nothing to prevent the Congress from terrifying it so that right to sue for treble-damages did not exist and then do you see any problem about negotiating treaties or conventions of its reciprocity.
1977.76-749,2,41731,samuel_w_murphy_jr,,1336.425,1352.588,If the Eighth Circuit opinion is affirmed there would be no problem in the Congress entering into additional treaties or approving additional treaties to specify the mechanics as to how those rights might be gained or amplified.
1977.76-749,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1377.977,1386.551,"But the Secretary of the State in 1890 was not wandering around the world urging other countries to adopt the Sherman Act, was he?"
1977.76-749,2,41731,samuel_w_murphy_jr,,1386.551,1388.353,"Not to my knowledge, Mr. Rehnquist."
1977.76-749,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1388.353,1392.868,And is that not the time we take congressional intent as of?
1977.76-749,2,41731,samuel_w_murphy_jr,,1392.868,1398.438,"Yes it is, however among the five compelling reasons which I hope to cite."
1977.76-749,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1411.705,1424.239,But how does the conduct of the Attorney General in recent years and urging other countries to adopt out antitrust principles there on the intended Congress in 1890?
1977.76-749,2,41731,samuel_w_murphy_jr,,1424.239,1432.38,The recent conduct of the Attorney General surely could not bear on the intended Congress in 1890.
1977.76-749,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1432.38,1445.181,"What policy or considerations or let me just back up a little, of necessity, your argument must be that Congress intended this result that the Eighth Circuit reached."
1977.76-749,2,41731,samuel_w_murphy_jr,,1448.592,1449.762,Certainly that is a principle premise.
1977.76-749,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1449.762,1463.581,What policy considerations would impel the Congress of the United States to grant to foreign -- other sovereign nations rights which it did not grant to the United States itself?
1977.76-749,2,41731,samuel_w_murphy_jr,,1463.581,1467.645,"Well, principles of comity plus the fact that not only where these rights granted."
1977.76-749,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1467.645,1470.317,"Comity is usually something like reciprocity, is it not?"
1977.76-749,2,41731,samuel_w_murphy_jr,,1470.317,1471.181,Yes Sir.
1977.76-749,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1471.181,1473.936,There is no reciprocity in my hypothetical.
1977.76-749,2,41731,samuel_w_murphy_jr,,1473.936,1474.815,Alright.
1977.76-749,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1599.13,1613.44,"Mr. Rigler, you start up by telling us that there are at least five compelling reasons why your possession is correct, and I am sure by our interrogation we have gotten you to -- you have probably given us all the reasons but not in one, two, three, four, five --"
1977.76-749,3,21453,douglas_v_rigler,,1613.44,1618.33,"I am not sure that I have covered them, but I will cover them briefly, Mr. Justice Stewart."
1977.76-749,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1708.896,1719.816,"With foreign corporations though at least that they are wholly owned by the government, this is a two-way street, they are suable as well as capable of being sued under your analysis, right?"
1977.76-749,3,21453,douglas_v_rigler,,1719.816,1732.863,The fifth reason I was about to come to Mr. Justice Rehnquist was Dunhill which I have mentioned previously and it seems to us that the government itself may be suable as you put it under the principles enunciated in Dunhill.
1977.76-749,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1732.863,1742.883,"So your feeling is that if your position were adopted not only could the government of Iran sue for treble-damages, but it could be sued in the Courts of this country for treble-damages."
1977.76-749,3,21453,douglas_v_rigler,,1742.883,1751.494,For its commercial activities I believe that this Court has stated that rule and indeed since the Court stated that rule it has been incorporated in the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act.
1977.76-749,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1751.494,1769.921,"We have not yet decided whether or not the municipality in the United States is covered by the antitrust laws defendant, let alone, whether or not a foreign nation is."
1977.76-749,3,21453,douglas_v_rigler,,1769.921,1774.896,I heard the City of Lafayette's argument if it is that to which you refer Sir.
1977.76-749,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1815.951,1822.209,Is there anything in 1890 that mentioned foreign government?
1977.76-749,3,21453,douglas_v_rigler,,1822.209,1825.065,There is Mr. Justice Marshall.
1977.76-749,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1862.456,1873.437,"Is there anything that Senator Sherman said other than I want to protect American people, did not he said it over-and-over again?"
1977.76-749,3,21453,douglas_v_rigler,,1873.437,1874.876,"No, he did not as a matter of fact."
1977.76-749,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1874.876,1877.235,He said he will protect the foreign governments?
1977.76-749,3,21453,douglas_v_rigler,,1877.235,1889.144,"He did not say specifically foreign governments, however, he referred, he did not -- Senator Sherman did not referred to the protection of the American people as opposed to the exclusion of foreign interest."
1977.76-749,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1889.144,1890.251,I did not say that.
1977.76-749,3,21453,douglas_v_rigler,,1894.643,1896.09,I do not know.
1977.76-749,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1896.971,1899.19,What did he say he was protecting?
1977.76-749,3,21453,douglas_v_rigler,,1899.19,1921.855,"He said that he was trying to make effective pre-existing remedies both common law and state remedies on page 21 Congressional Record 24-60, he gave a speech which outlined his philosophy of the bill, and his philosophy was that the individual remedies then existing for antitrust defenses simply were ineffective to control the trusts."
1977.76-749,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1921.855,1923.79,He was talking about American people.
1977.76-749,3,21453,douglas_v_rigler,,1923.79,1929.376,"No Sir, because he went on to say that he referred to the foreign commerce of the United States --"
1977.76-749,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1929.376,1931.912,That was taking advantage of the people.
1977.76-749,3,21453,douglas_v_rigler,,1931.912,1934.591,"No, absolutely not right."
1977.76-749,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1934.591,1936.914,"Yes, he was."
1977.76-749,3,21453,douglas_v_rigler,,1936.914,1968.357,"Mr. Justice Marshall, I respectfully urge you to return to the reference at 24-60 -- 24-56 because repeatedly he referred to foreign commerce of the United States in addition to which the bill itself not only mentions foreign commerce but as the Eighth Circuit noted trade and commerce with the foreign nations found its way into the statutory language and it seems to us that while respondents argue we were not concerned."
1977.76-749,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1968.357,1972.223,"Well, why did not the statute say persons and foreign governments?"
1977.76-749,3,21453,douglas_v_rigler,,1972.223,1974.258,It did say foreign corporations by the way.
1977.76-749,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1974.258,1977.741,"Why did not it say, persons and foreign governments?"
1977.76-749,3,21453,douglas_v_rigler,,1977.741,1978.379,Probably because --
1977.76-749,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1978.379,1980.819,"It said, persons."
1977.76-749,3,21453,douglas_v_rigler,,1980.819,1982.127,"It said, persons include."
1977.76-749,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1982.127,1998.187,"And when it said, persons, that included corporations, because this Court had already said that corporation were included in the word 'persons' in the Fourteenth Amendment."
1977.76-749,3,21453,douglas_v_rigler,,2005.085,2007.886,"Well, surely governments were meant to be included in persons."
1977.76-749,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2007.886,2010.519,I thought this Court said the US government was not.
1977.76-749,3,21453,douglas_v_rigler,,2010.519,2015.605,But this Court said that State governments were and this Court has recognized the right of Municipal Government.
1977.76-749,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2015.605,2017.626,But he said US government was not.
1977.76-749,3,21453,douglas_v_rigler,,2017.626,2026.927,"But that is because Senator Sherman specifically excluded in the legislative history, specifically indicated why the United States government was to be excluded."
1977.76-749,4,41731,samuel_w_murphy_jr,,2984.667,2988.962,Mr. Chief Justice just one or two points.
1977.76-749,4,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3132.769,3143.109,"Assume we agree to it what do you do with Georgia, you said it will just confine it to its facts and say a state is a state and a foreign government is a foreign government (Voice Overlap) a person --"
1977.76-749,4,41731,samuel_w_murphy_jr,,3143.109,3155.299,"In a practical sense the way a 1890 Congressmen would look at it, I am sure that is what he would say, he could think of all kinds of reasons why Georgia ought to be able to sue and Iran or would not."
