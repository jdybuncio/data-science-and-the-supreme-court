1972.71-1598,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,32.604,We’ll hear arguments next in number 71-1598 Hudson against Arnheim.
1972.71-1598,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,35.294,38.488,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1972.71-1598,1,23229,eugene_b_strassburger_jr,,1567.274,1571.236,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1972.71-1598,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1698.917,1700.021,And that was -- that was the District Court?
1972.71-1598,1,23229,eugene_b_strassburger_jr,,1700.021,1701.089,That was the District Court.
1972.71-1598,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1769.303,1771.186,"Theory, is that literally true?"
1972.71-1598,1,23229,eugene_b_strassburger_jr,,1776.025,1778.484,"Well I’m coming to that Your Honor, as to whether or not --"
1972.71-1598,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1778.484,1782.704,I mean it’s not literally true that in order to be an enterprise you have to own something.
1972.71-1598,1,23229,eugene_b_strassburger_jr,,1782.704,1784.306,I think almost it is Your Honor.
1972.71-1598,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1788.02,1790.194,How about the security guards?
1972.71-1598,1,23229,eugene_b_strassburger_jr,,1790.194,1790.791,Sir?
1972.71-1598,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1790.791,1792.592,How about the security guards?
1972.71-1598,1,23229,eugene_b_strassburger_jr,,1792.592,1797.283,The security guards may or may not be an enterprise depending on whom they work for.
1972.71-1598,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1797.283,1799.686,Or do they have to own something?
1972.71-1598,1,23229,eugene_b_strassburger_jr,,1799.686,1801.066,Not the security guards Your Honor.
1972.71-1598,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1801.655,1802.346,Well what is the difference?
1972.71-1598,1,23229,eugene_b_strassburger_jr,,1804.856,1817.786,"Well, I may have been misunderstood but I say that the enterprise doctrine itself must show some and I think I will be able to point to that Your Honors little more clearly that the enterprise doctrine must contain some type of ownership in order to --"
1972.71-1598,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1817.786,1820.854,Well your own paper and pencils and typewriters and what not.
1972.71-1598,1,23229,eugene_b_strassburger_jr,,1822.062,1828.641,"I am talking about title to the receipts which they receive for example, the gross rentals that they receive."
1972.71-1598,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2222.115,2226.334,I didn’t find the workmen’s compensation for example specifically sent forth in the stipulation.
1972.71-1598,1,23229,eugene_b_strassburger_jr,,2226.334,2257.839,"I don’t think it’s in the stipulation Your Honor, probably this wasn’t thought about with respect to talking about the minimum wage, we are talking about workmen’s compensation but I think there is enough in the stipulation itself to show especially at the bottom of page 23 that the funds deposited in these accounts are the property of the owner and that the owner himself would have to stand all those -- well, as a matter of actual fact and actual practice, I know as my own knowledge that each account is kept separate."
1972.71-1598,2,24636,frank_l_seamans,,2834.875,2838.805,Mr. Chief Justice and if the Court please.
1972.71-1598,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3035.634,3036.64,Thank you Mr. Seaman.
1972.71-1598,3,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3039.173,3039.698,Yes sir.
1972.71-1598,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3063.243,3080.962,"Well, he assumed his argument was directed at the proposition of the small apartment owner who economically couldn’t meet the standards and who by the very exclusion of the small category by Congress was not intended to be covered."
1972.71-1598,3,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3080.962,3091.803,"Well, Congress intended that employees who were employed in an enterprise -- who are not employed in an enterprise of a certain size would not be covered."
1972.71-1598,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3091.803,3097.971,"And they might be a long side, a large building where the person during the same work would be covered is that not true?"
1972.71-1598,3,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3097.971,3114.217,"Oh, it’s entirely possible that you could have two buildings, one small and independently operated where the only enterprise is under $500,000 and one along side that’s larger where the enterprise were either the office building itself has enough revenues to come within there."
1972.71-1598,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3114.217,3120.452,"So that all discrimination, all disparity could not be eliminated under the Act."
1972.71-1598,3,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3121.194,3127.594,"Well, I think no matter how you structured it unless you just made it applicable across the board to all employees, there would be some discrimination."
1972.71-1598,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3127.594,3129.581,But Congress made that discrimination.
1972.71-1598,3,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3129.581,3130.789,"Yes, Congress."
1972.71-1598,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3130.789,3137.845,"Now isn’t that partly a matter -- a practical matter of enforcement, is that at least one of the considerations?"
1972.71-1598,3,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3137.845,3145.828,"Well, I think that Congress felt that in -- where you were dealing with what say the Mom and Pop grocery store."
