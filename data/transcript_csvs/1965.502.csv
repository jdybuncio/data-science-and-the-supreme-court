1965.502,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,33.647,"Number 502, Raymond Dennis et al., Petitioner, versus United States."
1965.502,0,43387,telford_taylor,,35.99,39.006,"Mr. Chief Justice, members of the Court."
1965.502,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,168.419,176.382,"And most of -- most if not all of the previous and other prosecutions other than this case had been brought under that statute, isn't it?"
1965.502,0,43387,telford_taylor,,176.382,176.977,They have indeed.
1965.502,0,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,475.184,476.319,What were the grounds?
1965.502,0,43387,telford_taylor,,476.319,479.009,Errors in the admission of evidence.
1965.502,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,627.921,637.267,"Of the actual fraud as an element of the offense is it -- it has to be a conspiracy to defraud, but it doesn't need to be successful to defraud."
1965.502,0,43387,telford_taylor,,637.267,651.488,"That's quite right Mr. Justice Stewart and it does not need to be successful, but the charge must embody a charge of intent to defraud the government if it is to survive under the foreign clause and that charge must be substantiated by the underlying allegations --"
1965.502,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,651.488,652.569,For the purpose of the --
1965.502,0,43387,telford_taylor,,652.569,653.89,Yes.
1965.502,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,747.979,761.843,"Maybe we're talking about different cases or maybe we're talking about the same one I'm -- I'm misinformed, but I had -- my understanding the Bridges case was that it involved statute of limitations in the War-time Suspension of the statute of limitation --"
1965.502,0,43387,telford_taylor,,761.843,764.358,We're talking indeed about the citations (Voice Overlap)
1965.502,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,766.174,768.646,(Voice Overlap) -- that I don't remember you state in your argument.
1965.502,0,43387,telford_taylor,,768.646,770.764,"I did indeed, yes."
1965.502,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,2675.576,2680.67,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1965.502,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3212.546,3218.221,"How did the issue arise in the Doud, did they refuse to file anything (Voice Overlap) --"
1965.502,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,3218.221,3230.326,"The union and the officers used to file affidavit -- and then when the National Labor Relations Board failed to place the union's name in a representation election, they've brought suit --"
1965.502,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3230.326,3230.748,Against the Board.
1965.502,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,3230.748,3239.949,"-- against the Board to require the Board to make the appropriate measures, taking appropriate steps."
1965.502,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3239.949,3250.808,"Suppose this affidavit -- suppose this law had required that the prerequisite getting attention by the Union, by the Board?"
1965.502,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,3267.051,3270.556,"We think Mr. Justice Black, yes."
1965.502,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3288.391,3300.23,"Now let's assume that I don't know which position you are taking for the Government, let's assume that such a requirement would be void under the First Amendment."
1965.502,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,3315.354,3315.682,We think --
1965.502,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3315.682,3318.427,"Assuming now that it is void, the law is void."
1965.502,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,3318.427,3319.912,Yes.
1965.502,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3336.345,3347.931,Not -- which will be charged there -- would be given the government the wrong information with reference to their religious beliefs and we're assuming now that the government doesn't have the right to make any such inquiry.
1965.502,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,3347.931,3348.326,That --
1965.502,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3348.326,3349.463,The answer would be the same.
1965.502,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,3349.463,3357.474,"Well, Mr. Justice Black, it seems to me their response to the unlawful inquiry would be not to answer and then, if it --"
1965.502,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3357.474,3366.681,But if they did answer through here and then you could try them for perjury even though it was inquired -- requiring them to do something which the constitution forbade.
1965.502,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,3366.681,3376.597,"No, I think Mr. Justice Black, it might will be a defense if you say if they -- will require to answer through fear or through some form of coercion but if they have --"
1965.502,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3376.597,3378.627,I am talking about the coercion of the law.
1965.502,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,3378.627,3379.042,Yes.
1965.502,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3379.042,3380.725,Nothing but the law.
1965.502,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,3388.213,3392.5,"We think their obligation is just not to answer, not -- and they may not answer falsely --"
1965.502,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3392.5,3403.957,"And do -- do you have to make them draw and guess about that, those answers and then they can be tried even though they couldn't be tried for not answering it at all, because it --"
1965.502,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,3403.957,3407.242,"Yes, Mr. Justice Black because we think that they've committed a separate offense, we think that that --"
1965.502,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3407.242,3410.042,I -- I was just trying to find that if that was your first argument.
1965.502,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,3410.042,3412.177,"Well, that is our argument."
1965.502,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3450.159,3458.823,"Of course if he didn't answer, I'd assume he could be tried or commit a -- convicted of a crime, isn't it?"
1965.502,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,3458.823,3461.253,"Under this statute Mr. Justice Black, there is no --"
1965.502,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3461.253,3464.565,Not in this particular one but it would mean the same thing if it was a crime.
1965.502,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,3464.565,3476.379,"Oh, that they didn't answer but then he would have the constitutional claim then he could assert his constitutional claim and we think under our system, that's what a -- that's what somebody who was subject to an unconstitutional request must do."
1965.502,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3491.763,3529.362,"Well I gather this will not go through as far that there is any finding with these records to actually date [Inaudible] Let's assume that someone have been filed and executing these files for [Inaudible] I gather your argument goes far down to each place, in that place that I made, it's going to constitute, but nevertheless that -- part of me that, the prosecution under this indictment should not have brought from 1956 was not."
1965.502,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,3529.362,3533.928,"I think Mr. Justice Brennan, it would have been possible -- it would not have been -- it wouldn't have been void, I don't think I --"
1965.502,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3533.928,3535.493,Wide as the matter to get it done.
1965.502,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,3535.493,3536.761,"Yes, I think it would have been constitutionally permissible."
1965.502,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3536.761,3546.304,Your argument is not withstanding before the [Inaudible] nevertheless I think the affidavit -- they're prosecuted before the days of [Inaudible].
1965.502,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,3548.96,3563.267,"Yes sir because it was a false statement and because the petitioners could have raised their constitutional claim by simply not filing any statement and it did give them, the fact that the statute might be unconstitutional did not give them a light --"
1965.502,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3563.267,3564.915,I think [Inaudible]
1965.502,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,3564.915,3566.279,Yes.
1965.502,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3566.279,3570.172,Those arguments had been [Inaudible] results.
1965.502,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,3570.172,3570.733,Yes.
1965.502,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3570.733,3579.196,Now that the [Inaudible] requirement that these statutes or these statements to [Inaudible] statements here.
1965.502,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,3579.196,3579.523,Well --
1965.502,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3579.523,3582.371,That the [Inaudible]
1965.502,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,3582.371,3584.255,As a -- under the --
1965.502,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3584.255,3585.224,As conspiracy-to-defraud statute.
1965.502,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,3585.224,3600.036,"Well, under the conspiracy-to-defraud statute which is what this prosecution was brought under, I think the statement would have to be material because fraud would have been -- would be required."
1965.502,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3620.663,3621.953,Was this under 1001?
1965.502,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,3623.763,3623.981,No.
1965.502,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3623.981,3624.569,It was not?
1965.502,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,3624.569,3624.755,No.
1965.502,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3626.14,3626.968,That's the point of --
1965.502,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,3626.968,3632.847,That's right.
1965.502,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3907.596,3914.207,Have they held that in reference to questions involving First Amendment for you?
1965.502,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,3914.207,3914.981,I don't know of any case.
1965.502,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3914.981,3920.576,Do you conceive that there's any difference in that kind of case?
1965.502,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,3920.576,3925.446,"Well, I think it might be different in First Amendment case if possibly Mr. Justice Black."
1965.502,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4196.851,4203.776,And a relevance to the [Inaudible]?
1965.502,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,4203.776,4204.735,"Yes, right."
1965.502,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4214.739,4217.55,Is it the members [Inaudible] --
1965.502,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,4217.55,4218.566,"Right, Mr. Justice Brennan."
1965.502,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4219.994,4230.333,Why would they charge in this case for the violation -- conspiracy to violate this Act?
1965.502,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,4230.333,4247.494,"The real reason they weren't charged Mr. Chief Justice is, that there were some doubt -- apparently the time that the indictment was drafted whether an indictment charging them both with conspiracy-to-defraud and conspiracy to violate 1001 might not be duplicitous."
1965.502,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4253.672,4260.962,Or that they just take to a simple way of doing it and charge them with a conspiracy for violating this Act.
1965.502,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,4260.962,4263.023,I'd like to turn to that next with regard to the --
1965.502,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4263.023,4263.91,Alright.
1965.502,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,4263.91,4265.485,-- if I may on the right to --
1965.502,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4265.485,4266.29,Whatever you wish?
1965.502,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,4266.29,4266.523,Right.
1965.502,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4267.563,4268.17,Yes.
1965.502,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,4268.17,4277.358,With regard to the petitioner's second contention which is precisely that they should have been charged with 18 U.S.C. 1001 rather than with a conspiracy-to-defraud.
1965.502,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4313.156,4318.912,"Mr. Lewin, can you violate 9 (h)?"
1965.502,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,4318.912,4328.433,Only in the sense that 9 (h) has the sanction of not providing Board itself (Voice Overlap) it's not if you don't violate.
1965.502,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4328.433,4335.005,But in no -- in no event could you have charged him with a conspiracy to violate 9 (h)?
1965.502,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,4335.005,4345.227,"I don't think so Mr. Justice White, because all that -- all that 9 (h) does is it tells the Board, you may not offer your facilities to such and such unions."
1965.502,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4345.227,4346.7,Unless something happened.
1965.502,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,4346.7,4347.737,Unless something happened.
1965.502,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,4354.086,4359.648,Would perjury lie?
1965.502,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,4359.648,4365.826,"Well, if -- I think under the perjury statute, this would have to be before tribunal competent jurisdiction."
1965.502,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4396.948,4401.82,Did the indictment here specifically refer to 1001?
1965.502,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,4401.82,4404.945,"The indictment Mr. Justice Fortas, did not refer to that one."
1965.502,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4404.945,4447.22,"Because as I see this -- the juror saying maybe that this contained -- the specs that the charge here is a conspiracy-to-defraud the United States of the services of the NLRB by falsely filing an -- by filing a false affidavit under 9 (h), and I don't see -- I'm not sure that I understand why you referred to 1001 in your last statements."
1965.502,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,4459.95,4460.507,Yes.
1965.502,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4460.507,4470.339,And that the means of the overt act was the -- at least one of the over acts was the filing of this false affidavit.
1965.502,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,4470.339,4471.737,Yes sir.
1965.502,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4471.737,4475.428,"Now, the other question I want to ask you is this."
1965.502,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,4503.304,4504.813,That's precisely our position.
1965.502,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4504.813,4505.555,"(Voice Overlap) of the constitutional issues, is that right?"
1965.502,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,4505.555,4515.968,"That's right, we're saying no matter how that's decided, it does not affect these convictions just as it would not affect the bribery conviction or result conviction on -- if it were -- if it that would be --"
1965.502,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4515.968,4535.81,So you're charging a conspiracy under 371 to the defraud the United States by means of filing false affidavit with purpose of obtaining the services of the National Labor Relations Board under 9 (h) --
1965.502,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,4535.81,4535.98,Yes sir.
1965.502,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4535.98,4536.537,-- isn't it?
1965.502,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,4536.537,4538.116,That's right.
1965.502,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4548.581,4553.485,"Was that more than or less than, it was a different problem, you don't mention 1001 in the event that --"
1965.502,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,4553.485,4568.018,"We don't mention 1001 but well -- it was - in the course, Mr. Justice Stewart, in the course of committing their greater conspiracy that conspirators we think violated -- could very well been charged with having violated 1001."
1965.502,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4568.018,4568.936,But they weren't charged with that.
1965.502,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,4568.936,4584.907,"They were not charged with that, but the indictment, if I can just point to pages 2 and 3 of the indictment, it's entirely clear from the face of the indictment that there were three parts to the conspiracy."
1965.502,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4619.47,4628.561,Was there any advantage to the Government of charging with the -- under the fraud section and under this -- this has a violation of 1001?
1965.502,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,4628.561,4632.162,I can think of the -- I can think of none --
1965.502,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4632.162,4637.884,"Well, you may not or you may not have been may or had some worries about charging the folks but you could have taken either one."
1965.502,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,4637.884,4638.682,We could have taken either one --
1965.502,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4638.682,4638.928,So why do you think --
1965.502,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,4638.928,4639.816,-- I think it's possible --
1965.502,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4639.816,4643.22,"Why did you choose, what sounds like a more difficult course."
1965.502,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,4643.22,4648.006,Well I think it more accurately describes what the conspirators did really.
1965.502,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4653.547,4659.211,Well you have not -- you certainly agree to that part of what they did with the violation of 1001.
1965.502,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,4659.211,4660.53,"That's right, but I think that can only --"
1965.502,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4660.53,4664.951,"So you could have charged them with that and what about penalty wise, is that the same penalty --"
1965.502,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,4664.951,4669.629,"Same penalty, I think arguably --"
1965.502,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4669.629,4669.719,But there's no --
1965.502,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,4669.719,4670.499,-- they might have contend --
1965.502,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4670.499,4673.484,But there's no fraud connotation to this 1001.
1965.502,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,4673.484,4683.47,"Right, but they might then have contended and I don't think it would have been sound but they might have contended that their conspiracies were separate conspiracies then for each year."
1965.502,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4690.79,4707.093,Would you feel -- do you have to cut in to some prior cases in this Court to say that you've been -- that you can maintain this indictment and yet the fact is that it does charge a -- an actual facts amount to a violation of 1001?
1965.502,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,4711.936,4714.286,"Right, but we don't think we have to cut into any -- any statement --"
1965.502,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4714.286,4716.717,You don't think any -- you think General Taylor is erroneous?
1965.502,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,4716.717,4719.775,"Oh no, because the Bridges case which is I think the only case --"
1965.502,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4719.775,4721.132,You don't think that that's into that at all?
1965.502,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,4721.132,4757.119,"No, the Bridges case was as Mr. Justice Stewart pointed out a case in which the question was with the War-time Suspension of Limitations Act which extended a period of limitations for fraud against the United States would apply to a case in which a conspiracy-to-defraud was charged in which the whole conspiracy-to-defraud consisted only of the commission of substantive offenses, various substantive offenses which is making a false statement to a naturalization officer, obtaining a false naturalization certificate."
1965.502,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4867.713,4873.398,Would you say -- that would charge the violation of 1001 in any event?
1965.502,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,4873.398,4880.021,"We say that the facts alleged in the indictment amount to a violation of 1001 and more, yes."
1965.502,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4880.021,4885.608,And what's this -- what's your answer to these arguments about prejudice?
1965.502,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,4885.608,4896.0,"Well, our first answer of course is that if we could properly charge it then, even if they weren't prejudiced that there was -- its lawful prejudice."
1965.502,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4914.299,4927.668,"What if you're wrong -- what if you are wrong in your argument is there -- and what if it sound that the Government to this indictment, they only thing this indictment can be held with charges with the conspiracy to violate 1001?"
1965.502,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,4927.668,4940.807,"Then we think that the error was not prejudicial and that that -- because, the petitioners and the defendants in this case knew exactly from the fact spelled out very carefully indict -- in the indictment, what they were being charged with."
1965.502,2,43387,telford_taylor,,6362.394,6369.062,I would like to deal with a few of the questions that the Court put during the Government's argument.
1965.502,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6418.959,6422.238,"That conspires -- that conspiracy to violate 1001, is that it?"
1965.502,2,43387,telford_taylor,,6422.238,6430.394,Yes and the sequence is that this indictment in our case came in November of 1956.
