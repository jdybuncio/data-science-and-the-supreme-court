1999.99-699,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.122,"We'll hear argument now in Number 99-699, Boy Scouts of America and Monmouth Council v. James Dale."
1999.99-699,0,25174,george_a_davidson,,11.372,14.241,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1999.99-699,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,47.045,60.372,Do we take this case as one in which Dale was terminated because of the reasonable likelihood that he would use his position to advocate for his cause?
1999.99-699,0,25174,george_a_davidson,,60.372,75.814,"Your Honor, Mr. Dale had created a reputation for himself by the newspaper article which appeared, and which... the reputation which would have carried into the troop meeting and affected his ability to be a role model to the youths in his troop."
1999.99-699,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,75.814,92.343,"So if it were simply called to the Scouts' attention that he was a very private person, but had said to his family that he was a homosexual, that he could still be terminated?"
1999.99-699,0,25174,george_a_davidson,,92.343,110.137,"Well, as Mr. Dale alleges in his complaint and reaffirmed in his summary judgment affidavit, Scouting does not investigate the sexual orientation of applicants and only excludes those that are open about their sexual orientation."
1999.99-699,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,120.909,124.98,"Well, what is the position of the Scouts in the case that I have posited?"
1999.99-699,0,25174,george_a_davidson,,124.98,129.348,"Well, I would be prepared to defend any decision they might make in that situation."
1999.99-699,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,131.515,137.269,Is that on the grounds that from his status a certain amount of advocacy is likely?
1999.99-699,0,25174,george_a_davidson,,138.205,147.394,"--Well, Boy Scouts is concerned about two things, expression and conduct inconsistent with the oath and law."
1999.99-699,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,149.611,155.298,"Well, if a Boy Scout... well, let's just keep it at troop leaders for now."
1999.99-699,0,25174,george_a_davidson,,169.956,183.048,If the... whoever heard whatever statement was made learned that the person intended to engage in homosexual conduct felt that that was an appropriate--
1999.99-699,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,183.048,185.067,That wasn't my question.
1999.99-699,0,25174,george_a_davidson,,192.304,199.91,"--As I said in response to Justice Kennedy's question, that precise question hasn't come up."
1999.99-699,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,201.926,210.516,"But you're defending an expressive policy, and that's one of the things that's confusing."
1999.99-699,0,25174,george_a_davidson,,222.055,224.674,The policy is not to inquire.
1999.99-699,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,232.429,232.762,"Well, do we answer the--"
1999.99-699,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,232.762,245.57,"--Well, where do we look, though, to determine what the policy is, because it is a little confusing, and let me add another question to the mix, and maybe you can clarify for us where we look."
1999.99-699,0,25174,george_a_davidson,,262.031,262.764,--If a--
1999.99-699,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,262.764,270.804,"Now, what about that person, and where do we look to see what the Boy Scout position is on these things?"
1999.99-699,0,25174,george_a_davidson,,270.804,279.558,"--If that person were to advocate that position through Scouting channels in an effort to change policy, that would be permissible."
1999.99-699,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,301.971,312.629,"Well, I take it from what you're saying, Mr. Davidson, that perhaps the Scouts have not adopted a comprehensive policy covering every single conceivable situation that might come up."
1999.99-699,0,25174,george_a_davidson,,312.629,341.631,"Mr. Chief Justice, the Scouts have general moral principles in the morally straight and clean requirements of the oath and law, and they have to be interpreted by Scout leaders in situations as they have come up and certainly, in the case of those who have... Mr. Dale has alleged are openly homosexual are not permitted to be Scout leaders, in furtherance of the efforts to pursue those moral values in youth."
1999.99-699,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,341.631,346.6,So you want us to decide this case without reference to the likelihood of any public advocacy?
1999.99-699,0,25174,george_a_davidson,,352.068,369.013,"Certainly not in Mr. Dale's case, who has really constantly reiterated his intention and desire to be open, and has had considerable media attention both before the case was filed and subsequently."
1999.99-699,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,369.013,373.417,But you don't find that a necessary predicate for your case here?
1999.99-699,0,25174,george_a_davidson,,374.6,387.391,"I'm saying that the First Amendment would protect application of exclusion of other people in other circumstances, but they're not presented here today."
1999.99-699,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,387.391,395.347,When you... I'm not sure what we're talking about when we say exclusion of people who are not openly homosexual.
1999.99-699,0,25174,george_a_davidson,,407.489,413.708,"Well, if that person also were to take the view that the reason they didn't engage in that conduct would it would be morally wrong--"
1999.99-699,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,413.708,413.992,Right.
1999.99-699,0,25174,george_a_davidson,,413.992,421.081,"--and that's the view that would be communicated to youth, that case has not come up, but it's my understanding of the policy that that person would not be excluded."
1999.99-699,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,421.081,432.872,"But somebody who was homosexual and celibate, but who said, in my view it isn't morally wrong, would such a person be excluded?"
1999.99-699,0,25174,george_a_davidson,,432.872,447.982,"Justice Ginsburg, I'm not sure I got the nots right in that question, but if somebody said it was morally wrong, and that they didn't engage in it but did have homosexual inclinations, I believe that that person would be eligible for leadership, as I understand the policy."
1999.99-699,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,447.982,455.369,So again you're saying it's not the status of being gay or being candid about who you are but--
1999.99-699,0,25174,george_a_davidson,,455.369,460.539,It's about the message that would go to youth in the program.
1999.99-699,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,463.658,472.078,"--Well, I'm... I just... I don't understand what is the Boy Scouts' policy, and I think we've all asked about that."
1999.99-699,0,25174,george_a_davidson,,479.918,485.904,--The practice is not to inquire into the sexual orientation of leaders.
1999.99-699,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,506.735,509.203,Does that go for cohabiters also?
1999.99-699,0,25174,george_a_davidson,,509.203,510.437,"I'm sorry, I couldn't quite--"
1999.99-699,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,510.437,516.876,"People who live together, heterosexual unions but not blessed by marriage."
1999.99-699,0,25174,george_a_davidson,,516.876,525.815,"--Well, there's certainly adulterers or other people that have engaged in heterosexual behavior which Boy Scouts has not regarded as morally straight who have been excluded."
1999.99-699,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,525.815,534.588,"I don't mean... just, the incidence of living together before marriage is not so uncommon these days."
1999.99-699,0,25174,george_a_davidson,,537.338,537.54,Right.
1999.99-699,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,537.54,539.856,Two people who live together but they're not married.
1999.99-699,0,25174,george_a_davidson,,539.856,545.944,I know of no particular instances of application of the policy in that connection.
1999.99-699,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,558.286,575.313,"Is it fair to say, then, that anyone who is openly homosexual and whose admission, or profession of that fact would be likely to come to the attention of the Boy Scouts themselves, be excluded?"
1999.99-699,0,25174,george_a_davidson,,575.313,577.331,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1999.99-699,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,578.398,585.037,Openly homosexual in the sense of practicing homosexuality?
1999.99-699,0,25174,george_a_davidson,,585.037,595.81,"--Well, being openly homosexual in... communicates the concept that this is okay."
1999.99-699,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,597.776,599.262,That the sexual expression of it is okay?
1999.99-699,0,25174,george_a_davidson,,599.262,608.201,"--Absent some further statement that it would be immoral to act on the impulses, in the culture in which these statements are made we talk about coming out."
1999.99-699,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,617.89,633.482,"Is it... and I take it... we may have touched on this, but I take it that the position that you've just described is not stated anywhere in a Boy Scouts manual, or even a troop leader manual?"
1999.99-699,0,25174,george_a_davidson,,643.355,663.752,"Well, the record shows, although the actual article is not in the record, that in the magazine sent to all adult Scouters in 1992 there was an article about the policy, so it's not a stealth policy, but the general principle of morally straight is really very, very widely known in the Scouting movement."
1999.99-699,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,663.935,681.713,"The general principle is, but this particular application of the Scouts' view of the principle I take it is not stated in any official manual, either the handbook for boys that the Scouts get, or a troop leader's manual, is that right?"
1999.99-699,0,25174,george_a_davidson,,681.713,695.473,"--Well, in Mr. Dale's 1972 Scout master's handbook there is a reference in dealing with incidence of sexual activity that might occur in a troop that speaks disapprovingly of homosexual conduct, but there's not a--"
1999.99-699,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,695.473,696.023,But that's--
1999.99-699,0,25174,george_a_davidson,,696.023,705.045,"--formal policy statement in the troop... in either of those, of the publications, nor is there anything about adultery or any other... or a number of other--"
1999.99-699,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,705.045,705.262,--And I--
1999.99-699,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,705.262,705.445,--But--
1999.99-699,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,705.445,711.199,"--I take it you've just touched on something that I think... again, I think I understand your position, but I want to be clear."
1999.99-699,0,25174,george_a_davidson,,731.779,734.981,"--Absolutely not, Your Honor."
1999.99-699,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,768.599,770.551,But that's not at issue here.
1999.99-699,0,25174,george_a_davidson,,770.551,770.834,That's--
1999.99-699,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,770.834,772.917,"It's not alleged, and that's not the basis of it."
1999.99-699,0,25174,george_a_davidson,,772.917,773.467,--not alleged.
1999.99-699,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,774.383,774.717,All right.
1999.99-699,0,25174,george_a_davidson,,801.217,821.114,"That person could take that position in Scouting Councils to urge that a change be made, but if that... unless that person were willing to... if that person were to take that position to the youth in the program and urge it on the youth in the program, that person would not be able to continue as a Scout leader, and that's why Mr. Rice was terminated."
1999.99-699,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,821.114,827.685,"How about if he alleged in the community... one moment, just... how about if he just made speeches about this in the community as a whole?"
1999.99-699,0,25174,george_a_davidson,,827.685,835.957,"Well, I think this is a situation which, if it would be likely to come to the attention of the youth in the program, it would be open to--"
1999.99-699,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,835.957,836.34,All right.
1999.99-699,0,25174,george_a_davidson,,836.34,838.173,--Scouts to terminate that person's membership.
1999.99-699,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,840.642,853.919,"Did anything happen here, other than what's in the complaint, which I take it was that Mr. Dale, sometime in the past, was a member of the Gay Alliance at a university, gave some seminars, was interviewed then, and it was in the newspaper."
1999.99-699,0,25174,george_a_davidson,,856.121,856.404,Right.
1999.99-699,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,858.92,869.978,"All right, yes, but there's nothing other than that, and when you use the word open, that's what open refers to, is talking to the newspaper reporter about his previous membership in the Gay Alliance?"
1999.99-699,0,25174,george_a_davidson,,869.978,870.212,"No, no."
1999.99-699,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,872.98,874.866,We're... are we thinking of the same thing?
1999.99-699,0,25174,george_a_davidson,,874.866,875.266,"Oh, I'm sorry."
1999.99-699,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,875.266,882.753,"I'm thinking of a seminar that he was at, and there was a newspaper article about him, is that right, which is in the complaint?"
1999.99-699,0,25174,george_a_davidson,,882.753,883.253,"That's correct, Justice Breyer."
1999.99-699,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,883.253,883.819,And that's it.
1999.99-699,0,25174,george_a_davidson,,883.819,884.403,That's--
1999.99-699,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,884.403,888.74,"It's on the basis of that that he's terminated, and when you use the word open, you're referring to that?"
1999.99-699,0,25174,george_a_davidson,,888.74,888.94,--Right.
1999.99-699,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,888.94,889.39,All right.
1999.99-699,0,25174,george_a_davidson,,897.596,902.565,"Well, it would be open to Scouts to make that determination, and it's also open to Scouts to--"
1999.99-699,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,902.565,911.319,"Well, of course, it's always open to the Scouts to decide whom they're going to hire and not, but what I'm saying is, is there a policy that it would be identical were that person not gay?"
1999.99-699,0,25174,george_a_davidson,,922.043,925.494,--I have no information as to how that situation would be resolved.
1999.99-699,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,938.404,966.388,"I want you to proceed with the rest of your argument, but in answer to Justice Souter's question as to what documents, what about the 1978 memorandum, I think it was, that's quoted in the California supreme court case, which is a question and answer format, in which a high executive of the Scouts, I had thought, indicates that homosexuality in its troop leaders is incompatible with Scouting?"
1999.99-699,0,25174,george_a_davidson,,969.023,969.24,Well--
1999.99-699,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,969.24,970.792,--it seemed to me that that was a rather strong statement.
1999.99-699,0,25174,george_a_davidson,,970.792,985.885,"--There are several position statements, of which that's the first, to the effect that Scouting does not appoint avowedly homosexual leaders."
1999.99-699,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1038.166,1046.69,"May I ask right there, is it the position that a person who is a homosexual, engages in homosexual conduct, cannot fit that definition?"
1999.99-699,0,25174,george_a_davidson,,1046.69,1048.041,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1999.99-699,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1048.041,1071.823,May I ask also whether it makes any difference in the balance that the Court strikes that the Scouts are a federally chartered institution and that Government entities such as schools and fire departments and police departments and so on sponsor troop units?
1999.99-699,0,25174,george_a_davidson,,1086.667,1091.052,Let me answer both of those questions in order.
1999.99-699,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1131.962,1142.437,"--Well, I must say, I found it somewhat difficult to assess the relevance of this web of relations that the Boy Scouts have in New Jersey with schools and fire departments."
1999.99-699,0,25174,george_a_davidson,,1161.481,1199.69,"Well, with respect to the... we have governments that are begging Scouting to go into Cabrini Green housing projects, and to have cub packs at women's prisons, but Scouting itself has pulled back considerably from goverment, taking the Career Awareness Exploring Program back and making it a nonmembershp activity which doesn't involve oaths or membership or anything like that, so that many police and fire departments are no longer sponsoring Scouting units, because that's been moved over to Learning for Life."
1999.99-699,1,23398,evan_wolfson,,1758.934,1769.39,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1999.99-699,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1799.428,1808.617,"Mr. Wolfson, I suppose literally the policy of New Jersey would require the Boy Scouts to admit girls as well."
1999.99-699,1,23398,evan_wolfson,,1821.091,1822.791,"--Actually, that would not follow, Justice O'Connor--"
1999.99-699,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1822.791,1823.326,Why not?
1999.99-699,1,23398,evan_wolfson,,1823.326,1823.893,--for several reasons.
1999.99-699,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1824.843,1826.328,Isn't that a status?
1999.99-699,1,23398,evan_wolfson,,1826.328,1849.694,"--The New Jersey law itself, Your Honor, specifically creates an exemption for those public accommodations that are reasonably restricted, in the statute's words, to single status, and therefore the statute itself recognizes that there may be instances in which an organization that is nevertheless a public accommodation does not fall within the sex proscription otherwise in the statute."
1999.99-699,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1849.694,1861.133,"Yes, but if we accept your position and New Jersey changes its law, New Jersey drops its exemption, then, I take it, as Justice O'Connor suggested, it would fall out that the Boy Scouts would have to admit girls."
1999.99-699,1,23398,evan_wolfson,,1861.133,1889.235,"Well, in that unlikely event, Justice Souter, that they were to actually drop this exception, which clearly is embedded in the law, that would... it still would not follow, and this Court certainly need not reach that decision here today, because even were an organization under that public accommodations obligation, they would nevertheless then be able to make a First Amendment argument with regard to the burden on their expressive purposes and their ability to delivery their message, and that would be the case that would then be before the Court on whatever record exists there."
1999.99-699,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1889.235,1892.354,"Well, they don't have an antigirl message, do they?"
1999.99-699,1,23398,evan_wolfson,,1892.354,1893.737,"No, Your Honor, they do not."
1999.99-699,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1893.737,1894.056,And--

1999.99-699,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1895.689,1911.249,"--And they're saying that they do have... however they may have expressed it, they do have an antihomosexual expression message, so I suppose in the case of the girl who wanted to be admitted their position would be weaker than it is here."
1999.99-699,1,23398,evan_wolfson,,1911.249,1936.383,"--Well, actually, Your Honor, there's far more in the record with regard to Boy Scouts' self-identity and purposes and concepts, and perhaps their peda... excuse me... pedagogical approach, et cetera, that relates to boys, beginning with the name of the organization, right on, than there is in this record at all with regard to any effort to convey the asserted, implicit view on homosexuality that, as several questions of the Court indicated, is not reflected--"
1999.99-699,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1936.383,1962.367,"But this is... you are relying on cases that involve exclusion of women, and there's a certain irony in that you're relying on the Jaycees case and the Rotary case, and this statute of New Jersey does include sex, as well as sexual orientation, and I don't even think New Jersey has said that the exception would cover such an organization."
1999.99-699,1,23398,evan_wolfson,,1975.941,2005.294,"--Well, to answer your question, Justice Ginsburg, the best I can come up with regard to the admission of girls is that obviously that question is not presented before this Court, and the statute itself, and the legislature in enacting the statute, clearly intended to proscribe sex descrimination of the kind reflected in this Court's precedent, acknowledged in this Court's precedents with regard to Jaycees and others, acknowledged that nevertheless there may be some programs and some institutions that are able to show a reasonable restriction to single sex."
1999.99-699,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2041.967,2056.726,"--Well, what about a gay or lesbian group that takes the position that it does not want heterosexual members to participate, or be admitted?"
1999.99-699,1,23398,evan_wolfson,,2056.726,2057.543,What the State of New Jersey--
1999.99-699,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2057.543,2062.813,You would presumably think that this law would prevent that as well.
1999.99-699,1,23398,evan_wolfson,,2062.813,2073.188,"--That's... if that organization were a public accommodation, Your Honor, that had opened itself to all, that falls within the category of meeting those criteria, then that's correct, Your Honor."
1999.99-699,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2078.906,2091.15,"Do you think there's a difference at all in application of such a policy to commercial entities and groups, as opposed to private membership groups?"
1999.99-699,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2108.342,2121.019,"Should it apply, do you think, or should the weight we give it in the context of a First Amendment claim be the same for a purely private organization?"
1999.99-699,1,23398,evan_wolfson,,2121.019,2123.135,"--I have two answers to that, Justice O'Connor."
1999.99-699,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2161.06,2185.091,"Well, Mr. Wolfson, if we compare the antidiscrimination laws such as New Jersey has enacted with the sort of Fourteenth Amendment principles of equal protection, the... you know, we start out with people, with kind of immutable characteristics, blacks, national origin, and then presumably homosexuals are not quite the same."
1999.99-699,2,25174,george_a_davidson,,3583.638,3596.529,"Mr. Chief Justice, we've been in litigation on this precise issue for the last 19 years and 5 days, and I would just say this, that if you have to dissect each butterfly in order to classify it, there are not going to be many butterflies left."
1999.99-699,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3597.529,3599.898,The case is submitted.
