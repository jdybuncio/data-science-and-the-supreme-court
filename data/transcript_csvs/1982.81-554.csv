1982.81-554,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,6.748,We will hear arguments next in EEOC against Wyoming.
1982.81-554,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,61.414,64.647,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1982.81-554,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,162.358,172.509,"Do you recall, Mr. Solicitor General, whether in Murgia there was any subjective evidence with respect to capacity to perform the job?"
1982.81-554,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,172.509,173.165,I believe there was.
1982.81-554,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,173.165,176.868,In relation to the particular--
1982.81-554,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,176.868,177.727,To Mr. Murgia.
1982.81-554,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,177.727,180.507,--or men under a particular age?
1982.81-554,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,180.507,191.502,"The evidence in that case, as I recall, was that there was a general deterioration of certain physical abilities that were related to capacity to perform as members of the uniformed police force."
1982.81-554,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,437.855,450.068,"General Lee, the Congress of the United States itself has imposed a mandatory retirement age for similarly situated federal personnel, as I understand it."
1982.81-554,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,450.068,450.475,Yes.
1982.81-554,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,450.475,461.361,Maybe that indicates to us that there is a BFOQ defense for the state as a matter of law.
1982.81-554,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,461.361,463.611,"I don't think so, Justice O'Connor."
1982.81-554,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,527.818,531.427,Do you recall the case involving the foreign service officers?
1982.81-554,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,531.427,533.364,"Vance versus Bradley, yes."
1982.81-554,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,533.364,545.812,There certainly there was a policy decision by the Congress of the United States that there was an inherent impediment on foreign service officers after reaching the age of 60.
1982.81-554,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,545.812,548.045,That is correct.
1982.81-554,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,548.045,551.778,Doesn't that relate to the question Justice O'Connor put to you?
1982.81-554,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,551.778,553.341,It certainly does.
1982.81-554,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,645.756,652.926,"How would compare the functions of a game warden with the functions of the officer involved in the Murgia and, I think, Feeney cases?"
1982.81-554,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,654.815,655.769,Or with an FBI agent.
1982.81-554,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,820.608,842.631,"General Lee, supposing we just confine ourselves for the moment to the first ground, the interest in the work force, and Congress found that it would be, there's a shortage of jobs and it would be better to have younger men occupying these positions in the long run and that therefore, they imposed a mandatory retirement age of 55 for nationwide, game wardens, law enforcement people throughout the country."
1982.81-554,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,844.271,845.724,I think it would be constitutional under Murgia.
1982.81-554,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,845.724,863.529,Wasn't that part of the theory in Congress in putting a limit on the foreign service officers so that there would be an inducement for younger people to get in the system and not have these over-aged men of 60 blocking their progress?
1982.81-554,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,864.857,868.98,That was a much more powerful argument to me a few years ago than it is right now.
1982.81-554,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,868.98,892.362,"General Lee, in amplification of Justice Stevens' question, supposing that Congress imposed a mandatory retirement age of 50, feeling that it really wanted to get the younger people up there, and Wyoming came with a showing that half of its game wardens were over 50, and therefore, it really was impairing its right to structure its own employment system?"
1982.81-554,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,896.953,908.041,"I think it would be a fair amount closer, yes, because it does... while Hodel said that economic impact alone is not sufficient, it certainly is relevant."
1982.81-554,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,956.164,959.896,"But earlier, you said the case was really one of drawing the line with greater precision."
1982.81-554,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,969.143,971.439,"Well, that's true, that is correct."
1982.81-554,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,979.591,980.295,"General Lee,--"
1982.81-554,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1010.689,1018.982,"That's a good point, Mr. Chief Justice, and it does very little if any violence at all to that concept which I fully support, for this reason."
1982.81-554,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1049.048,1059.639,"From your description, Congress was a good deal more stringent than that, if the principle of the BFOC is that all or substantially all have to be disabled from performing."
1982.81-554,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1096.483,1101.512,"I don't know what the EEOC would say, but I would say that it's an acceptable procedure."
1982.81-554,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1101.512,1105.011,"Well, that doesn't mean the EEOC wouldn't say it's age discrimination."
1982.81-554,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1105.011,1106.104,I agree with that.
1982.81-554,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1119.709,1124.878,"Are you personally acquainted with him that you refer to him by name all the time, or is it just kind of an argument tool?"
1982.81-554,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1124.878,1126.206,Just kind of an argument tool.
1982.81-554,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1177.233,1193.037,"Do you mean by that, Mr. Solicitor General, that Congress was acting on a stereotype with respect to foreign service officers, FBI agents, military people, where they have arbitrary retirement ages, all of them down the line?"
1982.81-554,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1198.349,1199.832,I don't know.
1982.81-554,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1256.406,1263.795,What statement did Murgia make about the Constitution protecting against age discrimination?
1982.81-554,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1263.795,1290.924,"It is simply an inference, Justice Rehnquist, from the fact that the court rejected age as a suspect classification, it rejected employment as a fundamental right, and then went on to find that there was a rational basis, all of which is consistent with if the court had, in fact, held that age is not protected by the equal protection clause, all of that analysis would have been surplusage."
1982.81-554,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1301.701,1303.668,Do you find that a very satisfying analysis?
1982.81-554,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1303.668,1304.73,"Oh, indeed, I do."
1982.81-554,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1304.73,1311.854,"Doesn't that merely say that age... you assume for purposes of a decision that it's protected, and then go ahead and make the analysis."
1982.81-554,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1311.854,1332.439,"The court did not say in so many words that age... but if there is any doubt on that,... and may I add that the dozen or so lower federal courts that have considered the issue, the same premise is built in... I see no reason that age should not be protected."
1982.81-554,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1368.502,1382.012,"Did I understand you to say, Mr. Solicitor General, that if Congress enacted the statute requiring retirement of all federal law enforcement officers to retire at age 55, that that would be valid?"
1982.81-554,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1382.012,1383.917,"Well, yes."
1982.81-554,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1387.572,1389.461,Wouldn't that be equally discriminatory?
1982.81-554,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1389.461,1407.564,"--No, I think that is squarely covered by... it may be discriminatory in the sense that it draws classifications in the sense that virtually any statute passed by any legislature is discriminatory, but it passes the rational basis test, and that's Murgia and Vance versus Bradley."
1982.81-554,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1407.564,1417.435,You were talking about discrimination against the people in this case who are compelled to retire at 55.
1982.81-554,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1422.449,1424.682,"Indeed, that argument can be made."
1982.81-554,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1493.873,1502.119,Do you suppose Congress was experimenting on the states collectively in this area?
1982.81-554,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1502.119,1507.93,"Experimenting in the sense... to the extent that it's experimenting, it's doing it both ways."
1982.81-554,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1683.517,1684.734,Very well.
1982.81-554,1,18080,bruce_a_salzburg,,1689.95,1693.417,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1982.81-554,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1849.731,1850.526,There was a third one.
1982.81-554,1,18080,bruce_a_salzburg,,1855.432,1856.463,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1982.81-554,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1918.499,1926.216,"Mr. Salzburg, supposing that Wyoming had a law that said all game wardens shall be men?"
1982.81-554,1,18080,bruce_a_salzburg,,1929.166,1938.304,"Your Honor, Wyoming could not have such a law because sex discrimination is unconstitutional in this context."
1982.81-554,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1999.389,2002.403,Isn't the only issue here the 10th Amendment issue?
1982.81-554,1,18080,bruce_a_salzburg,,2002.403,2007.84,"--Your Honor, we submit that the only issue here is the 10th Amendment issue."
1982.81-554,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2011.713,2020.958,Suppose we reversed the judgment that the Act is unconstitutional on 10th Amendment grounds?
1982.81-554,1,18080,bruce_a_salzburg,,2029.345,2030.236,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1982.81-554,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2030.236,2034.329,Why do we have to go on to issues that were never decided below?
1982.81-554,1,18080,bruce_a_salzburg,,2034.329,2040.045,"In this particular case, it seems to me clear that the Court would not have to."
1982.81-554,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2043.216,2054.149,"That may be, but the only question raised in the papers and argued in the briefs is the 10th Amendment."
1982.81-554,1,18080,bruce_a_salzburg,,2054.149,2060.584,"Well, Your Honor, we certainly raise the same arguments that we raised before the district court."
1982.81-554,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2064.44,2065.471,"You're respondent here, I take it."
1982.81-554,1,18080,bruce_a_salzburg,,2065.471,2067.362,"--We are appellant, Your Honor."
1982.81-554,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2068.706,2069.596,Appellee.
1982.81-554,1,18080,bruce_a_salzburg,,2086.279,2104.239,The third test of National League of Cities versus Usery is whether or not the regulation interferes with the ability of the state to structure integral operations of traditional state functions.
1982.81-554,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2158.561,2170.383,"General Salzburg, this isn't as intrusive, is it, as making the Fair Labor Standards Act applicable, where in effect, the government would have been telling Wyoming what to pay to every single state employee?"
1982.81-554,1,18080,bruce_a_salzburg,,2178.068,2179.833,"Your Honor, it's more intrusive."
1982.81-554,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2337.051,2353.826,"Mr. Salzburg, do you think it's open to us to decide that Wyoming has established a BFOQ defense as a matter of law because of the congressional enactment exempting its own law enforcement personnel from application of the Act?"
1982.81-554,1,18080,bruce_a_salzburg,,2353.826,2362.964,"It is clear from the legislative history, Your Honor, that the Congress treats its own law enforcement officers as being presumptively entitled to a bona fide occupational qualification."
1982.81-554,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2374.553,2375.459,Would that solve your problem?
1982.81-554,1,18080,bruce_a_salzburg,,2375.459,2378.769,"--It would certainly solve our problem in this case, Your Honor."
1982.81-554,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2378.769,2382.642,What would be the theory on which we would reach such a decision?
1982.81-554,1,18080,bruce_a_salzburg,,2382.642,2399.729,"The theory is, Your Honor, that there is no constitutionally significant difference in the facts between the federal government's across-the-board requirement for its law enforcement officers... and understand that it's not little enclaves."
1982.81-554,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2441.868,2457.221,"Well, certainly we wouldn't do it as a matter of congressional intent, then, because there's no indication that I can find that Congress intended age to be an automatic BFOQ in the case where it was applying the ADEA to states."
1982.81-554,1,18080,bruce_a_salzburg,,2457.221,2459.126,"No, Your Honor."
1982.81-554,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2525.46,2531.318,Do you take the position that all enforcement officers are the same?
1982.81-554,1,18080,bruce_a_salzburg,,2531.318,2534.207,All law enforcement officers?
1982.81-554,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2534.207,2537.938,"Yes, please don't take that position."
1982.81-554,1,18080,bruce_a_salzburg,,2537.938,2538.829,"No, Your Honor."
1982.81-554,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2538.829,2539.938,Which I think you are saying.
1982.81-554,1,18080,bruce_a_salzburg,,2539.938,2540.813,"No, Your Honor."
1982.81-554,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2541.484,2546.155,I don't know of any two police forces in any two states that are the same.
1982.81-554,1,18080,bruce_a_salzburg,,2549.497,2551.185,"--Let me say it this way, Your Honor,--"
1982.81-554,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2551.185,2552.387,How are you going to get to that point?
1982.81-554,1,18080,bruce_a_salzburg,,2552.387,2560.213,"--The record, as the Solicitor General points out, consists only of a complaint."
1982.81-554,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2780.201,2784.293,May I just ask you... it really is the second half of your opponent's argument.
1982.81-554,1,18080,bruce_a_salzburg,,2794.712,2803.146,"--It would certainly be a different case, Your Honor, with respect to whether or not it's proper for the court to assume that the Section V power exists."
1982.81-554,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2805.237,2809.158,Does the scope of their power depend on what they say at the outset of the statute?
1982.81-554,1,18080,bruce_a_salzburg,,2809.158,2809.908,"No, Your Honor."
1982.81-554,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2810.846,2817.483,"Then can't we assume that they did, in effect, say that, and still have the same problem that you won't argue?"
1982.81-554,1,18080,bruce_a_salzburg,,2817.483,2824.871,"I am saying this, Your Honor, that if you use Pennhurst, you never reach the second question."
1982.81-554,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2837.053,2840.287,"Now, why is that?"
1982.81-554,1,18080,bruce_a_salzburg,,2847.675,2852.079,"No, Your Honor, I need to clarify that because my argument has apparently been misapprehended."
1982.81-554,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2979.435,2993.522,Isn't your broader position that the states have never delegated to the federal government the authority to tell them how to run the state government in terms of its employment?
1982.81-554,1,18080,bruce_a_salzburg,,2993.522,2995.037,"--That's exactly right, Your Honor."
1982.81-554,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3036.707,3045.438,"Do you think that before the 14th Amendment, the states could have discriminated against women on police forces?"
1982.81-554,1,18080,bruce_a_salzburg,,3045.438,3051.873,"It's a difficult question to speculate about, Your Honor."
1982.81-554,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3051.873,3055.497,"At any rate, after the 14th Amendment they could not."
1982.81-554,1,18080,bruce_a_salzburg,,3055.497,3056.309,Clearly not.
1982.81-554,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3119.254,3129.156,"Again, do you think the issue here is whether the Wyoming regulation or statute... it's a regulation, isn't it?"
1982.81-554,1,18080,bruce_a_salzburg,,3129.156,3130.61,--Pardon me?
1982.81-554,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3134.795,3143.181,"But the imposition of the age requirement was by regulation, wasn't it, under this statute?"
1982.81-554,1,18080,bruce_a_salzburg,,3143.181,3145.26,"No, Your Honor."
1982.81-554,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3146.79,3149.133,"Well, in any event, what is the statute or regulation?"
1982.81-554,1,18080,bruce_a_salzburg,,3161.394,3162.753,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1982.81-554,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3162.753,3171.859,Are you just responding about the closer fit because the Solicitor General has argued an issue that isn't here?
1982.81-554,1,18080,bruce_a_salzburg,,3171.859,3179.808,"Your Honor, the Solicitor General presents the closer fit argument as justification for the constitutionality of the Act."
1982.81-554,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3220.619,3223.775,"Do you have anything further, Mr. Solicitor General?"
1982.81-554,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,3223.775,3225.601,"Just a couple of matters, Mr. Chief Justice."
1982.81-554,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3314.503,3322.999,"Well, there are a number of federal employees who are not subject to as stringent limitations on retirement as the state of Wyoming's will be, isn't that true?"
1982.81-554,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,3322.999,3323.453,That is correct.
1982.81-554,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3368.294,3370.466,"Thank you, gentlemen, the case is submitted."
