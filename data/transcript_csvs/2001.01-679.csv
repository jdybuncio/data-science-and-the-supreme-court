2001.01-679,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.081,"We'll hear argument now in number oh one six seventy-nine, Gonzaga University and Rob- Roberta S League versus John Doe."
2001.01-679,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,10.15,30.059,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court: In nineteen seventy-four, when it en- enacted the Family Educational r- Rights and Privacy Act, Congress conditioned Federal funding for educational institutions on the institution not having a policy or practice of releasing student records without consent."
2001.01-679,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,83.106,83.106,far less reason --
2001.01-679,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,84.161,91.933,"primarily a distinction that makes a difference in c- connection with whether there's an implied cause of action, rather than whether nineteen eighty-three authorized a cause of action?"
2001.01-679,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,91.933,150.407,"In the implied right of action question there are two questions, did Congress intend to create a right, and did Congress intend to provide a judicial remedy? In the nineteen eighty-three context, there are two questions, did Congress intend to create a right, and did Congress intend to preclude resort to the nineteen eighty-three remedy, so that first question I think is the same under both categories of cases, and as the Court said in Cannon, if Congress phrases the statute as quo- quote, as a prohibition on the disbursement of public funds, there's far less reason to think that they intended a private remedy."
2001.01-679,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,150.407,176.265,This- The the statute does talk about rights of students and rights rights of parents.
2001.01-679,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,176.265,192.179,"Well, of course, the word rights does not appear in the disclosure provision, subsection B, and in Pennhurst, where the Court was dealing with the developmentally disabled bill of rights, the Court explained that just because the statute uses the word rights doesn't mean that it creates a nineteen eighty-three right."
2001.01-679,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,192.179,216.895,"Yes, I recognize in the one section that we're talking about here you have a stronger argument than the other, but if we a- assume for the moment would have a nineteen eighty-three cause of action under the whole act without going down provision by provision, then I I do think you have to recognize that w- the act does talk about rights of students, rights of parents t- to look at files, et cetera."
2001.01-679,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,216.895,253.802,"Well, first of all, the Court in Blessing said that you don't look at the whole act."
2001.01-679,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,955.692,985.623,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: If I could begin by responding to Justice Kennedy's question about whether the Family Policy Compliance Office is overworked, I will tell you that they do work very hard, but they do they handle for a small staff, they handle an amazing amount of work, and have been doing so for twenty-eight years under this statute."
2001.01-679,2,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1558.977,1610.779,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In FERPA, Congress gave parents the right to prevent the release of certain education records."
2001.01-679,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1610.779,1613.786,"Now, oi- you're reading from nine A, Ms. Brinkmann?"
2001.01-679,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3348.753,3484.294,"Thank you, Your Honor."
2001.01-679,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3484.294,3488.028,"They're answerable to us, presumably."
2001.01-679,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3488.028,3506.392,"Well It is implausible to suppose that the same Congress that was so worried about multiple interpretations of the law from the regional offices of one Department would have been perfectly content and, in fact, intended to confer the right for every one of sixty-two million students to go into court in a nineteen eighty-three action."
2001.01-679,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3506.392,3508.632,"Thank you, Mr. Roberts."
