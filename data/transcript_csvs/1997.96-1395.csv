1997.96-1395,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.156,"We'll hear argument next in Number 96-1395, Janice LaChance v. Lester Erickson."
1997.96-1395,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,53.435,56.628,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1997.96-1395,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,248.574,264.146,"General Waxman, just for purposes of discussion and not to indicate my view on what the Court's likely to do in the preceding case, but let's assume we recognize an exculpatory no doctrine, does that have any spillover effect in this situation?"
1997.96-1395,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,264.146,288.5,"Boy, the only spillover effect it could have, Justice O'Connor, would be if you found an exculpatory no doctrine required as a matter of constitutional law, because the argument in favor of the exculpatory no doctrine in every court that has adopted some form of it has done so as a matter of statutory construction, trying to define what Congress could have intended."
1997.96-1395,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,294.044,313.146,"I guess as a practical matter the consequences of lying about the situation, if you're correct in this case, are often more severe than the underlying malfeasance."
1997.96-1395,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,313.146,313.667,It may--
1997.96-1395,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,313.667,315.718,I would assume that could often be the case.
1997.96-1395,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,315.718,317.29,"--That could often be the case, and--"
1997.96-1395,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,317.29,319.06,I suppose the moral of that is don't lie.
1997.96-1395,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,319.06,334.491,"--That's the moral that we hope people will derive from the long line of cases in which this Court has held that even where there are important constitutional guarantees at issue, for example, in... under the self-incrimination clause, there is never a license to lie."
1997.96-1395,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,338.562,366.992,"Is there any concern about the conduct on the part of the agent, because most of these interviews are on a one-to-one basis, so is that perhaps what's reflected in this, that if you had a written record or... and the person, the employee when confronted lies, that's one thing, but if it's just an oral translation, how can you be sure that the one who's doing the interview isn't dissembling?"
1997.96-1395,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,366.992,369.263,"Well, a couple of answers."
1997.96-1395,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,426.252,434.095,"Was the... did the Federal Circuit in this case rest its holding on any statutory ground, or was it a purely constitutional holding?"
1997.96-1395,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,434.095,436.336,It is a purely constitutional holding.
1997.96-1395,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,485.47,497.838,"As I understand this panel of the Federal Circuit, they were following a precedent already set, and all these MSPB cases nowadays do go to that one circuit."
1997.96-1395,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,509.646,512.198,I... sure.
1997.96-1395,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,521.043,521.374,Yes.
1997.96-1395,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,521.374,544.559,"--I must say that although several panels of the MSPB itself in several instances in these cases felt that the result that was ultimately reached by the Federal Circuit was dictated by Grubka, but there are other... there were other MSPB decisions that basically distinguish Grubka."
1997.96-1395,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,577.421,580.884,There was one curiosity in the Federal Circuit's opinion.
1997.96-1395,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,590.361,601.196,"They did say that, but it's a little bit curious because all six of the employees in this case were alleged and proven to have made... to have lied during the investigative stage."
1997.96-1395,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,628.946,630.078,"--Very well, General Waxman."
1997.96-1395,1,38161,paul_e_marth,,631.758,635.17,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1997.96-1395,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,668.944,692.338,"Did you tell us that the question presented was not presented in your opposition to the petition, because the question presented surely says what you say is not at issue here, whether the Due Process Clause precludes a Federal... the Due Process Clause precludes a Federal agency from sanctioning an employee for making false statements to the agency regarding allegations that the employee had engaged in employment-related conduct."
1997.96-1395,1,38161,paul_e_marth,,695.811,697.534,"No, Your Honor, I'm not saying that."
1997.96-1395,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,698.605,698.944,Oh.
1997.96-1395,1,38161,paul_e_marth,,699.224,720.828,"--that the Government in its brief and in its argument has characterized this as a broad constitutional right to lie, whereas it's the respondents' position that the Federal Circuit said, in a very narrowly tailored situation, to protect an employee's meaningful right to respond, an employee can deny misconduct and put the Government to its proof."
1997.96-1395,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,720.828,721.219,Okay.
1997.96-1395,1,38161,paul_e_marth,,723.92,728.723,"Your Honor, I disagree with General Waxman with regard to that issue."
1997.96-1395,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,758.492,761.464,And was that denied to these respondents?
1997.96-1395,1,38161,paul_e_marth,,761.464,783.4,"--That was not denied, but what the court of appeals was saying, Your Honor, was that the meaningful right to respond and the meaningful right to have those rights was denied because early on before those rights were ever given, they were... in effect could be... if an employee was forced to respond affirmatively to the Government charges of misconduct, that that subsequent meaningful right was denied."
1997.96-1395,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,783.4,789.925,"Well, if it was simply an interpretation of the statute, why did the court of appeals refer to the Due Process Clause?"
1997.96-1395,1,38161,paul_e_marth,,789.925,806.104,"Well, the Due Process Clause comes in because the court of appeals found that there was a risk of erroneous deprivation in this case of those subsequent rights if an employee was forced to respond without a... an opportunity to deny the misconduct at the early stage."
1997.96-1395,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,806.104,807.616,"Let me ask my question again, then."
1997.96-1395,1,38161,paul_e_marth,,817.892,823.885,"Certainly, but the Due Process Clause, Your Honor, is based on property rights, and the property rights come from the statute."
1997.96-1395,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,823.885,826.047,Well... okay.
1997.96-1395,1,38161,paul_e_marth,,836.325,849.731,"Well, Your Honor, this Court has never, to my knowledge, dealt with this issue in a Federal employment context, where they have looked at the issues in the context of Federal employment."
1997.96-1395,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,856.167,864.842,"Well, even if the precise issue hasn't, what is the constitutional decision from this Court that most closely supports your position?"
1997.96-1395,1,38161,paul_e_marth,,864.842,881.104,"Well, in Garrity v. State of New Jersey this Court said that officers who are given the choice of either answering questions or losing their jobs had their Fourteenth Amendment rights violated, and the statements they gave were not voluntary and could not be used against them."
1997.96-1395,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,883.334,887.977,"There's no question of using the statements here against these people in some other proceeding, is there?"
1997.96-1395,1,38161,paul_e_marth,,887.977,892.752,"--You mean, whether or not these statements could be used in another proceeding?"
1997.96-1395,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,892.752,893.193,Yes.
1997.96-1395,1,38161,paul_e_marth,,893.193,902.847,"Your Honor, I would... or, Chief Justice, I would say that there is no prohibition against using those statements in another context, but--"
1997.96-1395,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,902.847,911.213,"The Government isn't trying to use them... the Government isn't trying to obtain a criminal conviction by using these statements in some sort of a criminal proceeding, is it?"
1997.96-1395,1,38161,paul_e_marth,,913.986,944.595,"--That's correct, Your Honor, but the employees certainly did not know that, and there are several employees in this case, Barrett and Roberts, for example, who could have been charged with taking Government property, misappropriation of Government property, Ms. Kye in this case, who could have been charged with some kind of credit card fraud or abuse, and these employees, when they're brought into the investigation stage, are not told by the Government whether or not criminal consequences are contemplated."
1997.96-1395,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,944.595,947.828,But no criminal consequences resulted in these cases.
1997.96-1395,1,38161,paul_e_marth,,947.828,948.388,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1997.96-1395,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,948.388,950.308,Now--
1997.96-1395,1,38161,paul_e_marth,,987.955,999.001,"Well, Justice Ginsburg, you've pointed out a real distinction between the Federal and the private sector, and that is that in the Federal sector an employee has absolutely no right to refuse to answer."
1997.96-1395,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1017.243,1022.337,"Oh, but that simply means that if the employee refuses there will be consequences for refusal."
1997.96-1395,1,38161,paul_e_marth,,1026.718,1027.249,"--That's correct, Your Honor--"
1997.96-1395,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1027.249,1027.739,--public and private?
1997.96-1395,1,38161,paul_e_marth,,1027.739,1040.568,"--Your Honor, and even this case, Ms. Kye, one of the charges against her was that supposedly she failed to cooperate in the investigation, so you're correct that an employee is put to a dilemma."
1997.96-1395,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1040.568,1042.799,And that's a separate charge from--
1997.96-1395,1,38161,paul_e_marth,,1042.799,1043.119,That's a separate charge.
1997.96-1395,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1043.119,1044.849,--the charge that she in fact lied.
1997.96-1395,1,38161,paul_e_marth,,1044.849,1047.534,"That's separate from that charge, yes, Your Honor."
1997.96-1395,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1047.534,1047.971,"That's right, yes."
1997.96-1395,1,38161,paul_e_marth,,1057.248,1058.64,"That's correct, Justice O'Connor."
1997.96-1395,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1059.52,1062.351,"It's a line I don't understand, but is it one you espouse?"
1997.96-1395,1,38161,paul_e_marth,,1062.351,1072.188,"--It is one we espouse, and the Merit Systems Protection Board has had no difficulty applying that line, and we contend that that line is no more difficult--"
1997.96-1395,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1072.188,1073.27,What is the line?
1997.96-1395,1,38161,paul_e_marth,,1073.27,1083.124,"--The line is that... the difference between denying the charges, a simple denial of the charges versus telling false tales or creating a story to cover yourself."
1997.96-1395,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1083.124,1094.604,"Well, in the case of the employee, Ms. Kye, she asserted that she had lost or torn up her Government credit cards, and yet that is not treated as a false statement."
1997.96-1395,1,38161,paul_e_marth,,1098.085,1108.073,"Your Honor, basically the elements of what the Government had to prove in her case was that she had misused her credit card."
1997.96-1395,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1125.102,1126.294,"Yes, but she said... she went beyond that."
1997.96-1395,1,38161,paul_e_marth,,1128.265,1144.166,"And she also attempted, Your Honor, to correct that later on, and when she attempted to correct it, and that's one of the risks here, that when that employee attempted to correct it she was charged with falsifying evidence and her entire credibility--"
1997.96-1395,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1144.166,1145.667,"Which, indeed, she had been doing."
1997.96-1395,1,38161,paul_e_marth,,1151.57,1152.611,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1997.96-1395,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1152.611,1153.553,So what's wrong with that?
1997.96-1395,1,38161,paul_e_marth,,1153.553,1172.035,"Well, the danger here that if an employee... for example, in a couple of these cases they were asking questions, in Ms. Walsh's case about some conduct that occurred 3 years before, and in the Barrett and Roberts case they were asking them how were they spending a 2-hour period 14 months before."
1997.96-1395,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1198.292,1202.105,"Well, doesn't there have to be intentional misrepresentation?"
1997.96-1395,1,38161,paul_e_marth,,1203.847,1204.636,"Well, yes, Your Honor."
1997.96-1395,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1204.636,1205.658,"Well, doesn't that solve that problem?"
1997.96-1395,1,38161,paul_e_marth,,1205.658,1209.812,"Well, the problem is the chilling effect on an employee of denying--"
1997.96-1395,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1209.812,1210.931,Chilling effect on lying.
1997.96-1395,1,38161,paul_e_marth,,1210.931,1213.603,--Chilling effect on denying misconduct.
1997.96-1395,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1236.029,1240.45,"Yes, but that's because it's a more serious thing to do."
1997.96-1395,1,38161,paul_e_marth,,1265.836,1283.59,"Your Honor, but here Congress has said that employees, when they're going to be disciplined, have certain rights, and the issue is, are those rights to a meaningful opportunity to defend affected when... before those rights are ever given, and here you have... I think it's important to understand the context."
1997.96-1395,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1317.552,1334.651,"But even this case, how does it fit with what the Federal Circuit said its narrow holding was, that as it said, that false statements made during agency investigations may properly be subject to falsification or similar charges?"
1997.96-1395,1,38161,paul_e_marth,,1351.454,1354.735,"Your Honor, that's the one point I agree with General Waxman on."
1997.96-1395,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1367.112,1369.143,"Well, but this seems to say just the opposite."
1997.96-1395,1,38161,paul_e_marth,,1374.619,1386.985,"Well, I mean, there's no question that these questions were given during the investigation, but what is evident is that the investigation had focused on the individual respondents in this case."
1997.96-1395,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1429.725,1434.607,"--Mr. Marth, can I... let me express what... the trouble I have with your presentation."
1997.96-1395,1,38161,paul_e_marth,,1459.804,1461.254,"Not exactly, Your Honor."
1997.96-1395,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1470.04,1471.081,Just in the investigation.
1997.96-1395,1,38161,paul_e_marth,,1471.081,1478.916,Just in the investigation prior to the meaningful rights that Congress has given in 5 U.S. Code section 7513.
1997.96-1395,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1494.617,1499.499,"Once the proceeding starts, however, you agree that there's no such--"
1997.96-1395,1,38161,paul_e_marth,,1499.499,1500.049,"I agree, Your Honor."
1997.96-1395,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1500.049,1500.43,--No such right.
1997.96-1395,1,38161,paul_e_marth,,1510.918,1516.74,"I don't think the record is clear on that, Your Honor, Justice Breyer."
1997.96-1395,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1520.302,1530.58,"I mean, what I... the difference between this case and Alger Hiss illustrates the point that when a person commits perjury he is put under oath."
1997.96-1395,1,38161,paul_e_marth,,1576.361,1585.677,"Well, Your Honor, one thing, of course, that would solve the problem would be that there would be no investigation questions to a given employee who's under charges until they're given--"
1997.96-1395,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1585.677,1586.278,"Yes, yes--"
1997.96-1395,1,38161,paul_e_marth,,1586.278,1587.017,--Until they're given their rights.
1997.96-1395,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1587.017,1593.131,--I mean a legal route within the framework of the law we are discussing.
1997.96-1395,1,38161,paul_e_marth,,1593.131,1609.923,"Well, the legal framework, Your Honor, as I understand the court of appeals decision and what we're advocating here is that for the meaningful rights to apply, an employee has to be able to deny the misconduct, similar to a not guilty plea, and put the Government to its proof."
1997.96-1395,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1609.923,1615.427,"Well, but we're not dealing here, are we, with criminal charges as such."
1997.96-1395,1,38161,paul_e_marth,,1627.315,1629.947,"Well, not only an employee sanction, but a--"
1997.96-1395,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1629.947,1631.097,Isn't that what we're talking about?
1997.96-1395,1,38161,paul_e_marth,,1631.097,1632.779,"--We are talking about a double sanction, yes, ma'am."
1997.96-1395,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1632.779,1643.945,"And this Court has never imposed some kind of Miranda rights scheme in the context of looking into employee malfeasance or misfeasance, have we?"
1997.96-1395,1,38161,paul_e_marth,,1643.945,1644.776,No.
1997.96-1395,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1645.875,1648.569,But you would want us to impose something like that.
1997.96-1395,1,38161,paul_e_marth,,1648.569,1649.778,"No, Your Honor."
1997.96-1395,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1660.277,1662.067,A Miranda-type scheme for--
1997.96-1395,1,38161,paul_e_marth,,1662.067,1662.538,Right.
1997.96-1395,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1662.538,1662.978,--employees.
1997.96-1395,1,38161,paul_e_marth,,1668.543,1669.531,"No, I'm not advocating that."
1997.96-1395,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1671.324,1672.442,--But that's not this case.
1997.96-1395,1,38161,paul_e_marth,,1681.358,1682.289,Well--
1997.96-1395,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1682.289,1685.562,"I thought if they were trying not to lie, nothing could happen to them."
1997.96-1395,1,38161,paul_e_marth,,1685.562,1690.064,"--Well, the risk is that something could happen to them, Your Honor, and... Justice Scalia."
1997.96-1395,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1690.064,1695.669,The risk is that something could happen to them if it were proven that they were not trying not to lie.
1997.96-1395,1,38161,paul_e_marth,,1695.669,1697.45,"Well, for example, in Ms. Walsh's case--"
1997.96-1395,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1697.45,1699.06,"I mean, life is tough."
1997.96-1395,1,38161,paul_e_marth,,1702.073,1703.425,--In Mrs. Walsh--
1997.96-1395,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1703.425,1703.945,--that can't be eliminated.
1997.96-1395,1,38161,paul_e_marth,,1703.945,1704.266,--I'm sorry.
1997.96-1395,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1723.116,1726.829,"But the MSPB ruled in favor of these employees, as I understand it, right?"
1997.96-1395,1,38161,paul_e_marth,,1726.829,1727.44,That's correct.
1997.96-1395,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1727.44,1727.931,And was affirmed.
1997.96-1395,1,38161,paul_e_marth,,1758.188,1761.211,"We do have a policer for some Federal employees, Your Honor, but not for all."
1997.96-1395,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1765.885,1768.546,We're dealing with a case that comes to us through the MSPB.
1997.96-1395,1,38161,paul_e_marth,,1768.546,1779.934,"--Right, but I think it's important, though, if we're looking at due process rights available to the entire Federal workforce, that the Court understand that not all employees have a right to get that independent decisionmaker."
1997.96-1395,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1785.538,1802.277,"I take it under your scheme if there's suspicion that a credit card has been misused and the supervisor said, I'd like to talk to you about this credit card problem, the employee has a right to say, I decline to make any statements on that unless you want to bring charges."
1997.96-1395,1,38161,paul_e_marth,,1802.277,1807.372,"An employee can certainly do that, and the agency has the right to bring charges."
1997.96-1395,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1807.372,1810.945,Can the agency separately charge for noncooperation--
1997.96-1395,1,38161,paul_e_marth,,1810.945,1811.334,Yes.
1997.96-1395,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1811.334,1812.165,--and failure to answer?
1997.96-1395,1,38161,paul_e_marth,,1812.165,1812.586,Yes.
1997.96-1395,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1813.287,1814.235,"Well, but not under your scheme."
1997.96-1395,1,38161,paul_e_marth,,1822.952,1826.674,"I don't believe I was ever advocating that, Your Honor."
1997.96-1395,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1826.674,1841.313,"Oh, you would never give them a right to be silent, only to lie."
1997.96-1395,1,38161,paul_e_marth,,1851.481,1853.822,"Well, either one, they're subject to potential penalties."
1997.96-1395,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1853.822,1860.648,"Is the penalty the same for simply saying, I don't care to discuss it, as it is for lying?"
1997.96-1395,1,38161,paul_e_marth,,1860.648,1873.354,"I am not sure on the table of penalties, Your Honor, whether or not the refusal to cooperate in an investigation is a removable offense or not, so I cannot answer that question."
1997.96-1395,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1873.354,1879.147,But you're not denying that it's permissible to remove the employee for failure to cooperate?
1997.96-1395,1,38161,paul_e_marth,,1882.169,1882.48,"No, but that--"
1997.96-1395,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1882.48,1882.95,"--prohibition, do you?"
1997.96-1395,1,38161,paul_e_marth,,1882.95,1893.907,"--No, but that puts the employee in the difficult situation where they're... where they're questioned, again, before they're given those meaningful rights that Congress has given them, that the issue is, at that point, what do they do?"
1997.96-1395,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1923.736,1932.883,"Well, certainly it would mislead, if you're asked a question, did you misuse the credit card, and you say no, I didn't, when in fact you did."
1997.96-1395,1,38161,paul_e_marth,,1935.384,1947.203,"--Well, I guess there is that issue of whether or not a simple denial is misleading, or whether to mislead or to deceive the Government requires some kind of more affirmative misconduct."
1997.96-1395,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1947.203,1966.316,"Well, it's hard for me to see how the... you know, you could say perhaps a spinner of tall tales would dig their own grave by making extravagant statements that were easily refutable, whereas perhaps a simple no would be less easy to identify as perjurious."
1997.96-1395,1,38161,paul_e_marth,,1966.316,1987.029,"Your Honors, we would contend that the due process concerns in this case with regard to risk of erroneous deprivation, basically that there are six potential risks to the employees in these... in this case."
1997.96-1395,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1998.398,2003.391,"Mr. Marth, may I just ask you one question about the relationship of the prior decisionmakers?"
1997.96-1395,1,38161,paul_e_marth,,2011.256,2021.314,The Federal Circuit in Grubka came up with the proposition to begin with that a person always has the right to deny a charge and put the Government to its proof.
1997.96-1395,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2021.314,2026.496,So it wasn't MSPB as... MSPB was not the originator.
1997.96-1395,1,38161,paul_e_marth,,2026.496,2027.207,That's correct.
1997.96-1395,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2027.207,2032.492,I didn't understand that your theory was risk of erroneous deprivation.
1997.96-1395,1,38161,paul_e_marth,,2050.143,2050.955,"Well, Your Honor--"
1997.96-1395,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2050.955,2051.733,Isn't that your theory?
1997.96-1395,1,38161,paul_e_marth,,2051.733,2061.02,"--Yes, Your Honor, but the risk comes from requiring an employee at that early stage in effect to give up or minimize his later meaningful rights."
1997.96-1395,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2061.02,2063.581,"Yes, but it's not a risk of erroneous deprivation."
1997.96-1395,1,38161,paul_e_marth,,2063.581,2080.434,"Well, if he is required to respond with more than an exculpatory no in effect at that time, then there is that risk that his later rights would be deprived of him, deprived of him from a meaningful point of view."
1997.96-1395,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2080.434,2085.087,"Well, it's a risk that his later rights will not protect him from a justified deprivation."
1997.96-1395,1,38161,paul_e_marth,,2098.105,2098.324,No.
1997.96-1395,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2139.601,2141.373,"Thank you, Mr. Marth."
1997.96-1395,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2143.203,2145.995,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1997.96-1395,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2197.911,2200.011,"But Mr. Waxman, that... none of that was necessary."
1997.96-1395,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2200.011,2201.972,--It was absolutely not necessary.
1997.96-1395,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2208.066,2213.15,"But even if he was put in a room and asked a bunch of rapid-fire questions, it seems to me we've got the same answer under--"
1997.96-1395,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2213.15,2214.109,--That's... that's right.
1997.96-1395,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2222.434,2224.026,"--Which is I suppose what he should have done, right?"
1997.96-1395,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2224.026,2244.8,"--We have as an... the Government as an employer has the right to ask that they do that, even if we had been ""unreasonable"" and put him on the spot and said, look, we're investigating this Mad Laugher incident, and were you... do you or do you not know anything about that, but none of the cases before this Court are anything approaching that."
1997.96-1395,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2272.67,2274.15,"In fact, I don't suppose she could even say I don't remember, if she really did."
1997.96-1395,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2274.15,2298.266,"That's... that's right, and the problem that Justice Breyer was suggesting that some people may have with the potential for abuse I think is dealt with very adequately by Congress and by the Office of Personnel Management in the relevant stat... provisions of the Civil Service Protection Act and the implementing regulations."
1997.96-1395,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2320.982,2356.277,"Is this... this is a minor... but I mean, it... point, but it's crucial, I guess not necessarily to whether you win or lose, but I'm still worried about whether this is a constitutional or a statutory case, and the language on 12a, you see, they say, the question before us is whether doubling up a misconduct charge, et cetera, deprives the employee of the due process that the statute intends, and then they talk about Federal law throughout the rest of it, and they've got the Constitution in there quite a lot, but I... maybe it's the same answer."
1997.96-1395,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2361.991,2368.075,There is simply no doubt that the Federal Circuit was ruling as a matter of constitutional due process.
1997.96-1395,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2371.615,2380.421,"Mr. Waxman, you would not be happy, I don't suppose, with a decision that says we find no constitutional basis for this decision, but we leave open the question whether it's commanded by the statute."
1997.96-1395,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2380.421,2387.817,--I don't think there would be any basis whatsoever... that would be the most muscular interpretation of the statute imaginable.
1997.96-1395,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2389.407,2391.27,You think it's more muscular than the interpretation of the Due Process Clause?
1997.96-1395,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2391.27,2394.592,"--Well, that's... you mean by the court below?"
1997.96-1395,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2394.592,2395.091,Yes.
1997.96-1395,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2395.091,2395.912,That's rather--
1997.96-1395,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2395.912,2398.062,"We've muscled that around before, right?"
1997.96-1395,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2398.403,2398.813,--That's rather muscular.
1997.96-1395,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2410.812,2435.208,"Well, he... they've attached 7513 and to the list in 7511 and they say, for the efficiency of the service, and then they list all these rights and they say, well, obviously, this means that you have a right to say no, and certainly during the hearing, and since you must have a right to exculpatory no during the hearing itself you have this reading."
1997.96-1395,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2436.538,2457.062,"It's... look, it's not how... it isn't how the Government has read the opinion, but it would be wonderful if the Court could so read the opinion and then hold that even as a matter of statutory construction it simply cannot be that as an a priori matter it doesn't promote the efficiency of the service to sanction employees who deliberately and intentionally lie to their employers."
1997.96-1395,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2466.838,2467.921,"Thank you, Mr. Waxman."
