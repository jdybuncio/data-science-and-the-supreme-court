2014.13-1175,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,8.555,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 13-1175, the City of Los Angeles v. Patel. Mr. Rosenkranz."
2014.13-1175,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,8.555,42.39,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This case is about whether to deprive scores of cities of one of the most effective tools that they have developed to deter human trafficking, prostitution, and drug crimes that have seized the -- the ground in America's hotels and motels. The ordinance in question is the least intrusive of -- inspection scheme that this Court has ever encountered."
2014.13-1175,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,60.17,76.605,"Could you -- first, two questions: Is the information that they've been keeping for 150 years the same? Because looking at the requirements, the early information was basically somebody's name and -- I'm not even sure -- their address."
2014.13-1175,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,102.335,105.93,"You are right, Your Honor, that the amount of information has increased."
2014.13-1175,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,123.89,124.19,Right.
2014.13-1175,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,137.115,142.99,"Well, it is administrative, Your Honor, and to understand why it's administrative, you have to focus first on the target."
2014.13-1175,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,165.83,189.975,"Mr. Rosenkranz, are you saying then that the police can do this -- can request these records on demand, and they don't have to have any reason at all -- no reasonable suspicion, no probable cause, nothing -- because the purpose is to deter people from staying in hotels who might do bad things."
2014.13-1175,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,194.82,225.28,"That's correct, Your Honor. It's the same rationale that this Court adopted in Burger, that frequent, unannounced spot inspections are necessary in order to achieve that deterrent purpose; that if the hotels do not record all the names, and more specifically, they record most names but not the names of the -- of the guests that they know are criminals, there's no way to know, unless you have this frequent, unannounced inspection, that someone is missing."
2014.13-1175,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,230.52,240.065,Can you tell me how many prosecutions there have been -- and I use the word both criminally or civil -- for the failure to register people?
2014.13-1175,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,240.065,242.47,"Well, there have been numerous prosecutions."
2014.13-1175,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,274.81,280.535,But that has nothing to do with the free right to search.
2014.13-1175,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,295.355,297.73,"Agreed, Your Honor, and so let me just break it down."
2014.13-1175,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,297.73,300.04,Those people who don't want to do it are not going to do it anyway.
2014.13-1175,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,300.04,300.56,Exactly.
2014.13-1175,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,358.92,365.73,You -- you mean they can walk up and down the halls and see that nobody's in the certain room? I don't know quite how you do that.
2014.13-1175,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,365.73,367.72,"Well, Your Honor, the way it works in particular --"
2014.13-1175,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,367.72,372.595,"You have room No. 2 as if it's right there, but room No. 1204 --"
2014.13-1175,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,372.595,375.54,"So motels, for example, are out in the open."
2014.13-1175,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,376.67,382.61,What about my question about room 1204? You seem to say the police can wander all over the hotel.
2014.13-1175,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,382.61,388.07,"Well, if -- the police may be allowed to wander around the hotel."
2014.13-1175,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,394.87,399.83,I suppose in motels they can see what rooms have cars in front of them.
2014.13-1175,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,411.925,420.175,"That's correct, Your Honor, and that's why the realtime observation is so key, because you can't do that a month later."
2014.13-1175,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,422.43,422.72,Sure.
2014.13-1175,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,456.43,458.89,"But not nearly as effectively, Your Honor, because --"
2014.13-1175,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,458.89,468.605,"Well, since when has the Fourth Amendment completely been abandoned to how effective the proof that the police can get at a moment should be?"
2014.13-1175,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,468.605,470.34,"Well, Your Honor, that's not the test."
2014.13-1175,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,510.91,526.44,"But, Mr. Rosenkranz, why isn't this just like Barlow's really? That it's not necessary on the following rationale: Number one, most people will consent so that you go -- the police go into a hotel and say we'd like to see your registry, most people are going to consent."
2014.13-1175,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,554.165,566.51,"Your Honor, what makes this different is the distinction between Barlow's on the one hand and Burger, Dewey, Biswell, Colonnade, on the other hand, and that is the movability of information."
2014.13-1175,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,592.85,593.23,What's --
2014.13-1175,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,593.23,593.58,Go ahead.
2014.13-1175,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,593.58,606.27,"What's going to -- what's going to change here? The registry is the registry, and as I said, if in an unusual case you have the feeling that the hotel is complicit, you can make sure to freeze the registry."
2014.13-1175,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,616.265,622.91,"Well, Your Honor, what will -- what would change is, is the information on the basis of which you draw that comparison."
2014.13-1175,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,630.39,635.82,"A month later doesn't -- you know, it -- it's an hour later."
2014.13-1175,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,635.82,643.85,"Well, you mean get a warrant within hour? Warrants within an hour are -- are not that easy to get, particularly --"
2014.13-1175,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,643.85,646.52,What's the probable cause for the warrant?
2014.13-1175,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,646.52,647.815,"Well, there is -- that's --"
2014.13-1175,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,647.815,651.3,"If you haven't seen the register, what's the probable cause?"
2014.13-1175,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,651.3,653.17,There is no probable cause.
2014.13-1175,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,653.17,668.155,"What, do you have to have a policeman sit outside the hotel for -- for days to -- I mean, you don't have probable cause unless you know that there -- there are people who are, you know, in -- in the room for a short time who haven't registered."
2014.13-1175,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,668.155,668.57,Right.
2014.13-1175,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,679.28,703.795,"If you prevail in this case and a member of the Court sits down to write the opinion, does he or she have to use the phrase ""reasonable expectation of privacy"" and say there is no reasonable expectation of privacy in our society, in our culture, in our day, or do we just forget that phrase? In -- in a way, as we all know it's circular, that if we say there is a reasonable expectation, then there is."
2014.13-1175,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,703.795,708.895,"Well, Your Honor, the answer depends upon which Fourth Amendment rubric one uses."
2014.13-1175,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,720.61,723.88,Is closely regulated another way to talk about reasonable expectation of privacy?
2014.13-1175,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,723.88,724.97,"Yes, indeed it is."
2014.13-1175,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,724.97,727.51,"We talk about that in the Katz case, the telephone booth case --"
2014.13-1175,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,727.51,728.31,I don't know that --
2014.13-1175,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,728.31,735.47,But I'm not sure that -- is that still a phrase that's -- that's necessary and required for us to address in an opinion like this?
2014.13-1175,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,735.47,756.74,"If the Court adopts the Burger rubric, what the Court was doing in Burger was saying because this is so heavily regulated in the context of this case, because everyone knows that these registers have been reviewed by the police for 15 years, no one goes into the hole -- into the hotel business unaware that their registers will be inspected."
2014.13-1175,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,756.74,758.69,Whose expectation of privacy are we talking about?
2014.13-1175,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,758.69,760.02,We are talking only about the hotel.
2014.13-1175,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,760.02,760.93,Not the hotel guests; right?
2014.13-1175,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,760.93,761.945,"No, Your Honor."
2014.13-1175,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,768.74,769.11,Yes.
2014.13-1175,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,769.92,770.48,But only --
2014.13-1175,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,770.48,771.25,-- of the hotel.
2014.13-1175,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,771.25,771.895,Yes.
2014.13-1175,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,771.895,775.71,You can't see my register. It's -- it's dear to me.
2014.13-1175,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,775.71,786.225,"Even though I have entered a business that for 115 years has revealed these registers and for 100 of those years, actually revealed the registers to the guests."
2014.13-1175,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,786.225,786.48,But --
2014.13-1175,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,786.48,786.58,Who --
2014.13-1175,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,786.58,810.24,"Suppose that there's a -- Mr. Rosenkranz, suppose that there's a statute that says that the taxing authority, the IRS or the equivalent on the State level, that the taxing authority can go into businesses at any time and check payroll records; and the reason is that they need to conduct these surprise, warrantless searches because there's a serious problem with businesses ginning up false payroll records."
2014.13-1175,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,811.915,815.01,"I would think not, Your Honor, at least not without more information."
2014.13-1175,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,831.81,832.51,How about the hiring --
2014.13-1175,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,832.51,832.61,No.
2014.13-1175,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,844.91,848.19,"Well, Your Honor, either a payroll record is false or it's not."
2014.13-1175,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,850.94,855.885,"No, you do, because you don't want to give them the time to falsify things till the end of the year."
2014.13-1175,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,859.24,861.36,And -- and my answer is still the same.
2014.13-1175,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,866.91,874.825,"I don't know why not. Checking to see if people are actually registered, you don't know that until you see a person working."
2014.13-1175,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,882.035,882.85,"Well, Your Honor, that was --"
2014.13-1175,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,882.85,884.37,That's a realtime need.
2014.13-1175,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,884.37,890.27,It's a -- it's -- but either the record -- either the ultimate record that is submitted is false or it's not.
2014.13-1175,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,894.34,894.76,You just --
2014.13-1175,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,894.76,894.91,-- correct.
2014.13-1175,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,894.91,936.785,"You just keep a register -- you falsify the register the way that you're saying these people would. I -- my problem with the closely held -- closely regulated is I don't see one regulation that's not applicable to virtually every public accommodation entity, whether it's a telephone company or a day school or a hospital. I mean, virtually all of these requirements that you list are part of the normal State regulation of entities that serve people. Is it your position now that once we say this is closely regulated, that everything is --"
2014.13-1175,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,936.785,937.63,"No, your Honor."
2014.13-1175,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,937.63,939.34,-- that serves the public in some way?
2014.13-1175,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,939.34,939.68,No.
2014.13-1175,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,968.13,975.72,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Dreeben."
2014.13-1175,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,975.72,997.68,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This Court can resolve this case on a much narrower basis than it has used in looking at other administrative inspection schemes, such as the one in Barlow's. The Ninth Circuit itself recognized that this case did not involve an entry into the nonpublic working places of a business."
2014.13-1175,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1009.565,1011.51,"Well, that doesn't seem very significant."
2014.13-1175,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1021.94,1029.17,"That's certainly right, but what the -- this statute requires is that the registry be produced for inspection."
2014.13-1175,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1035.95,1036.17,I'm sorry.
2014.13-1175,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1054.465,1056.57,"Well, Justice Sotomayor, it would be a search."
2014.13-1175,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1059.6,1060.23,So that's the point.
2014.13-1175,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1060.23,1087.965,"-- my point here is that this is -- we're dealing here with businesses which have reduced expectations of privacy, and we are not dealing with entry into the nonpublic areas of the businesses, which is what Marshall's was concerned with, Colonnade, Biswell, Burger, all of those cases. So the Ninth Circuit itself did not apply the rules that govern those kinds of situations where the Court has sometimes said an administrative warrant is required and other times said it is not."
2014.13-1175,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1087.965,1097.445,"This is a facial challenge. Now, are there any or a substantial number of instances in which the application of this statute would be constitutional?"
2014.13-1175,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1097.445,1105.85,"Well, I -- I think there would, Justice Alito, in -- if there were exigent circumstances that justified the access to the registry. And most importantly --"
2014.13-1175,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1105.85,1107.69,But -- but then you don't need the statute.
2014.13-1175,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1107.69,1110.44,"Well, the statute helps because it informs the --"
2014.13-1175,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1110.44,1110.56,No.
2014.13-1175,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1110.56,1110.79,-- hotels.
2014.13-1175,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1110.79,1112.23,There are exigent circumstances.
2014.13-1175,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1114.94,1115.805,Yeah.
2014.13-1175,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1117.12,1118.0,So that doesn't work.
2014.13-1175,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1118.0,1139.645,"No, I think it works, Justice Kennedy, in the sense that the -- the statute provides encouragement for a potentially recalcitrant hotel owner to produce it, because it's an offense for him not to. But more importantly, I think for the Court's evaluation of the facial challenge issue is that there's no record in this case about what kind of privacy expectations actually exist with respect to hotel registries."
2014.13-1175,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1144.05,1147.83,I don't think -- I don't see why we've ever required more.
2014.13-1175,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1155.915,1156.6,Because --
2014.13-1175,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1156.6,1162.23,"What -- what are they suppose to prove, that they don't use -- that they don't show it to anyone else? We've never required that."
2014.13-1175,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1162.23,1166.96,"Well, I think that they should show that there's a certain degree of confidentiality associated with it that they in fact --"
2014.13-1175,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1166.96,1178.09,"Well, there is today when the Federal law requires that you not disclose credit card information and driver's license information and these registries contain that information."
2014.13-1175,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1180.81,1180.96,Well --
2014.13-1175,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1180.96,1181.87,The registries --
2014.13-1175,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1181.87,1182.2,-- some --
2014.13-1175,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1182.2,1188.125,-- by law are required to have the driver's license information taken for people who are paying cash --
2014.13-1175,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1188.125,1188.68,That's right.
2014.13-1175,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1188.68,1193.745,-- and requires the credit card information of people who are otherwise registering.
2014.13-1175,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1193.745,1198.445,"Well, the registry doesn't have to have the credit card information unless they check in at a kiosk."
2014.13-1175,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1207.65,1207.91,Yes.
2014.13-1175,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1220.0,1221.18,"I would agree with that, Justice Scalia."
2014.13-1175,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1221.18,1222.82,And this case does not involve the guests.
2014.13-1175,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1224.49,1245.96,"It's just the hotel, and there is a range of situations in which different information is maintained in different ways. So I think that treating it as a facial challenge is problematic; but if you reach the merits, what the Ninth Circuit itself did is conclude that this case doesn't trigger the very strong safeguards that are triggered when there is an invasion of a nonpublic space of a business."
2014.13-1175,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1282.8,1287.08,How -- how do you distinguish -- is it Marshall and Barlow? Do I -- do I have the right name?
2014.13-1175,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1287.08,1306.3,"You do, Justice Kennedy. And the distinction which the Ninth Circuit, itself drew is that involved entry into the nonpublic areas of a business which exposes a much wider range of information to the inspection of the authorities. Marshall covered every industry in interstate commerce, and it allowed OSHA inspections without any limitation."
2014.13-1175,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1307.46,1309.32,"I guess I don't understand that, Mr. Dreeben."
2014.13-1175,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1315.325,1326.845,"What I'm saying, Justice Kagan, is that the Ninth Circuit analyzed it precisely that way, that you can walk into the lobby of a hotel. This Court so said in the Lone Steer case, you're not invading any expectation of privacy."
2014.13-1175,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1343.03,1350.11,"Well, if I were running a hotel, I think I might have -- prefer to have two uniformed detectives in the backroom so the guests don't see it."
2014.13-1175,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1352.43,1361.565,The Ninth Circuit treated it as a lesser degree of intrusion than an inspection of all of the private areas of the business; and that's why it applied the subpoena line of cases.
2014.13-1175,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1418.66,1426.645,"Mr. Dreeben, I'm trying to figure out what do you think is relevant here; so let me give you a hypo, which is say that it's not a hotel, but it's a hunting lodge."
2014.13-1175,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1451.525,1455.37,"It seems like a much more difficult case to me, Justice Kagan, in part because --"
2014.13-1175,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1455.37,1457.495,Is this a public hunting lodge?
2014.13-1175,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1457.495,1460.21,"It's a private hunting lodge, this was a private hotel."
2014.13-1175,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1460.21,1461.445,"Well, that's a big difference, isn't it?"
2014.13-1175,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1461.445,1466.135,I will have to defer to members of the Court on hunting lodges. (Laughter.)
2014.13-1175,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1466.135,1477.41,"But I think that interest that is being served there is far weaker than the interest that is being served here, which is a genuine problem reflected in the fact that there are a hundred statutes like this across the country in different sounds --"
2014.13-1175,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1477.41,1488.41,"Wait, that's how you're going to distinguish it, Just because it's more important? Because the fish and wildlife people think that it's really, awfully very important to make sure that all these rules are -- are complied with."
2014.13-1175,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1488.41,1502.48,"I agree with that, Justice Kagan, but I do think that this Court in it's classic Fourth Amendment analysis balances the government interest to be served against the nature of the intrusion. I don't know enough about the hunting lodges that you have in mind to really gage the nature of the intrusion."
2014.13-1175,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1517.825,1522.78,There -- there -- there is no dispute here that you can require the hotel to keep the records.
2014.13-1175,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1522.78,1523.425,That is correct.
2014.13-1175,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1523.425,1523.97,Is that right?
2014.13-1175,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1523.97,1525.37,The hotels are not challenging that.
2014.13-1175,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1525.37,1531.85,"I think there would be a big dispute with regard to private hunting lodges, whether you could require them to keep the records."
2014.13-1175,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1531.85,1541.005,"And there may be Second Amendment concerns that the Court would weigh in the balance. I think that the Court can resolve this case, in an extremely narrow fashion."
2014.13-1175,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1541.005,1543.55,I -- I think it's even more dangerous.
2014.13-1175,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1566.46,1566.9,I -- I think --
2014.13-1175,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1566.9,1579.36,"So it can't be that merely ask -- intruding on someone's private information, in a public place eliminates the Fourth Amendment."
2014.13-1175,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1579.36,1579.795,May I answer?
2014.13-1175,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1579.795,1580.175,Yes.
2014.13-1175,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1580.175,1589.75,"I think you ask -- asked three questions, Justice Sotomayor; first, the substantiality of the government interests; second, the nature of the intrusion on privacy; and third, necessity."
2014.13-1175,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1605.705,1606.62,"Thank you, counsel."
2014.13-1175,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1606.62,1608.49,Thank you.
2014.13-1175,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1608.49,1610.505,Mr. Goldstein.
2014.13-1175,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1610.505,1621.68,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court: We ask the Court to hold that the city does not need to go to the judge in advance and get a warrant, but instead, that it merely needs to issue us a one-page subpoena."
2014.13-1175,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1632.83,1643.135,Is it -- is it your position that there is no instance in which this statute and the -- the implementation of it would be constitutional?
2014.13-1175,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1643.135,1661.25,"It is because the hypothesis that you would use it for, exigent circumstances or when would you have waived the right to privacy by putting it out on the desk, don't actually involve the enforcement of the statute. What's necessary here, the value that's in the Fourth Amendment, is the requirement that there be a regularized scheme."
2014.13-1175,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1691.51,1709.49,Suppose that a city or a State wanted to establish an administrative inspection regime along the lines of Barlow's? What would it -- what would it have to include in your judgment? Could they -- could the warrant be issued by an administrative law judge --
2014.13-1175,3,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,1709.49,1709.64,Yes.
2014.13-1175,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1709.64,1712.705,-- as opposed to a superior court judge in California?
2014.13-1175,3,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,1712.705,1712.945,Yes.
2014.13-1175,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1712.945,1715.23,Would it have -- would it require probable cause?
2014.13-1175,3,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,1715.23,1715.92,No.
2014.13-1175,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1715.92,1719.775,Could they -- could it be done without prior notice?
2014.13-1175,4,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1719.775,1720.58,Yes.
2014.13-1175,4,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1720.58,1724.385,Could you have different standards for different types of hotels?
2014.13-1175,5,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,1724.385,1725.19,If there is --
2014.13-1175,5,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1725.19,1739.41,"Periodic inspections for all hotels, but much more frequent inspections for hotels that rent by the hour, hotels that have a large number of guests who pay in cash, and so forth?"
2014.13-1175,6,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1739.41,1740.1,Yes.
2014.13-1175,6,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1740.1,1741.695,All those things could be done.
2014.13-1175,6,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1741.695,1741.87,Sure.
2014.13-1175,6,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1741.87,1749.3,"Now if that's okay, it's really not clear to me what that would add to the ordinance that we have before us."
2014.13-1175,6,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1749.3,1749.42,Great.
2014.13-1175,6,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1817.65,1823.45,"Well, what would be the nature of the objection? I'm going back to Mr. Rosenkranz's answer to my question."
2014.13-1175,6,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1845.165,1845.92,"Sure, Your Honor."
2014.13-1175,6,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1890.915,1896.81,"Well, what's the purpose -- you agree that it's constitutional to require the registry?"
2014.13-1175,6,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1896.81,1897.72,Absolutely.
2014.13-1175,6,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1897.72,1898.08,Okay.
2014.13-1175,6,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1905.03,1905.41,Ah --
2014.13-1175,6,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1905.41,1906.08,What's the point?
2014.13-1175,6,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1906.08,1911.28,"Well, Justice Kennedy, the fact that its only interest is in law enforcement I think is a point in our favor."
2014.13-1175,6,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1979.23,1988.1,Seeing the light on doesn't prove anything unless you know that the hotel has not registered the person who is in the room.
2014.13-1175,6,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1988.1,1989.56,Justice Scalia --
2014.13-1175,6,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1989.56,1990.32,And --
2014.13-1175,6,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1990.32,1996.095,"-- remember, our objection is not to them being able to either require the register or inspect the register."
2014.13-1175,6,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2034.7,2036.33,They -- they -- they could fill in.
2014.13-1175,6,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2040.33,2045.41,"The subpoena is -- Justice Scalia, the subpoena -- he's not running off anywhere. The subpoena is simply handed at the desk."
2014.13-1175,6,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2048.395,2049.375,"No, no -- sorry."
2014.13-1175,6,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2049.375,2051.16,I don't understand.
2014.13-1175,6,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2051.16,2051.56,Okay.
2014.13-1175,6,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2051.98,2053.1,He has it in his pocket?
2014.13-1175,6,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2053.1,2053.595,Yes.
2014.13-1175,6,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2054.55,2063.51,"All you're asking for all this litigation is just that the one who wants to inspect it, just pulls out a piece of paper and hands it to him and that makes it all okay."
2014.13-1175,6,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2063.51,2063.71,No.
2014.13-1175,6,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2086.34,2088.68,He could say the same thing without the subpoena.
2014.13-1175,6,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2088.68,2095.02,"Yes, but that's -- our critical point is that this guarantees him the right to say that to a judge."
2014.13-1175,6,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2095.02,2096.21,And the --
2014.13-1175,6,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2096.21,2105.26,"It allows him the opportunity, while the policeman is getting a subpoena, to fill in the name of the person in what is otherwise a blank space."
2014.13-1175,6,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2105.26,2107.73,"Mr. Chief Justice, he's not going to get a subpoena."
2014.13-1175,6,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2111.14,2116.93,"Oh, I thought you said that if he serves a subpoena, the other person can demand judicial -- pre-enforcement judicial review."
2014.13-1175,6,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2116.93,2117.62,"Yes, that's correct."
2014.13-1175,6,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2117.62,2123.065,So the police officer has to go somewhere to get the judicial review with whoever the hotel owner sends.
2014.13-1175,6,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2123.065,2129.6,"Well, it might not work that way, and that is, the hotel office -- the hotel owner may have to file a motion to quash."
2014.13-1175,6,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2134.01,2137.02,"Well, it is important because we're trying to figure out how this works."
2014.13-1175,6,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2137.02,2137.15,Yes.
2014.13-1175,6,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2137.15,2140.3,"The policeman goes with a subpoena and the hotel owner says, I object."
2014.13-1175,6,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2140.3,2140.61,Yes.
2014.13-1175,6,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2140.61,2141.64,Now what happens?
2014.13-1175,6,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2141.64,2142.22,He files --
2014.13-1175,6,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2142.22,2143.25,And how long does it take?
2014.13-1175,6,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2143.25,2147.22,"It doesn't take any amount of time, which is why the Court has consistently required it."
2014.13-1175,6,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2156.35,2156.57,Okay.
2014.13-1175,6,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2157.645,2158.07,Yes.
2014.13-1175,6,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2158.07,2158.615,Okay.
2014.13-1175,6,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2169.23,2169.43,No.
2014.13-1175,6,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2192.72,2199.915,"So in a construction subpoena, if you object and say, well, I'm going to take these records and keep them in the police car trunk until we resolve this?"
2014.13-1175,6,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2199.915,2201.12,"Yes, you can do that."
2014.13-1175,6,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2201.55,2202.62,There's authority for that?
2014.13-1175,6,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2202.62,2203.155,I'm sorry?
2014.13-1175,6,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2203.155,2204.3,There's authority from this Court?
2014.13-1175,6,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2204.3,2204.53,"Oh, sure."
2014.13-1175,6,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2216.41,2219.625,It seems to me that's much more intrusive than the scheme you're objecting to.
2014.13-1175,6,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2219.625,2222.245,"Justice Kennedy, I don't think the government can have it both ways."
2014.13-1175,6,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2234.55,2236.45,They're not entirely private records --
2014.13-1175,6,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2236.45,2236.61,Right.
2014.13-1175,6,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2236.61,2242.645,-- they're records required by law to be kept and you are not objecting to that at all.
2014.13-1175,6,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2242.645,2244.88,"Well, Justice Scalia, that's absolutely right."
2014.13-1175,6,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2270.49,2271.37,"Mr. Goldstein, I thought --"
2014.13-1175,6,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2271.37,2282.12,"But you said they could be -- they can be -- they can be sequestered by the police officer, they even answered before, that suggested you have to have some outside approval."
2014.13-1175,6,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2290.785,2291.28,Yes.
2014.13-1175,6,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2302.965,2304.3,That's a seizure.
2014.13-1175,6,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2304.61,2304.835,Right.
2014.13-1175,6,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2305.945,2310.005,So why is that justified and looking at the information not?
2014.13-1175,6,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2310.005,2315.43,"This Court has held that in the identical circumstance, this arises in the Fourth Amendment context."
2014.13-1175,6,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2326.09,2328.25,"Yeah, that's if it has probable cause."
2014.13-1175,6,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2328.25,2333.31,"Well, Your Honor, it has the relevant level of cause that's required in the particular context."
2014.13-1175,6,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2334.38,2345.6,"I'm confused by your answer. I thought you said in response to my earlier questions that the city could have a regime under which an administrative law judge issues a warrant, not a subpoena --"
2014.13-1175,6,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2345.6,2345.945,Yes.
2014.13-1175,6,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2345.945,2347.875,-- for a periodic inspection.
2014.13-1175,6,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2347.875,2348.175,Sure.
2014.13-1175,6,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2348.175,2354.48,"So the -- the officer would have the warrant, would go to the hotel, here's the warrant, this is your periodic inspection."
2014.13-1175,6,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2356.25,2356.88,That is -- that's not right.
2014.13-1175,6,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2356.88,2358.79,There could be a challenge to it later.
2014.13-1175,6,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2358.79,2359.29,"No, Your Honor."
2014.13-1175,6,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2373.12,2373.41,Right.
2014.13-1175,6,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2373.41,2375.72,Right? So we'd be perfectly happy with that.
2014.13-1175,6,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2390.65,2400.84,"The complexity of the answers and, frankly, the surprise I have at some of your answers may indicate that this is not a basis for a facial -- this is not a case for facial attack."
2014.13-1175,6,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2400.84,2401.37,Okay.
2014.13-1175,6,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2401.6,2407.905,Seems to me we have to go back and -- and decide these issues on a case-by-case basis.
2014.13-1175,6,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2407.905,2417.53,"Well, Justice Kennedy, I'll give my responses to that obviously, and that is, the Court in all of the Colonnade line of cases and Camara cases has dealt with things on a categorical basis."
2014.13-1175,6,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2442.72,2443.06,I'm sorry.
2014.13-1175,6,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2452.325,2453.43,Certainly.
2014.13-1175,6,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2453.85,2454.09,We did.
2014.13-1175,6,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2454.09,2454.97,Sibron says exactly --
2014.13-1175,6,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2454.97,2455.66,Exactly.
2014.13-1175,6,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2460.455,2461.46,Yes.
2014.13-1175,6,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2461.46,2467.215,"-- we've looked at it, facially it was applied or whatever, but it doesn't need to be as applied."
2014.13-1175,6,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2467.215,2467.47,Yes.
2014.13-1175,6,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2496.345,2512.145,"Would you -- would you -- you've constantly said that one of the objections that the hotel owner can make is that you want these records for enforcement of the criminal law, right? You say that's bad."
2014.13-1175,6,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2512.145,2512.995,Yes.
2014.13-1175,6,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2512.995,2517.65,"But the whole purpose of this thing is to enable the criminal law to be enforced, isn't it?"
2014.13-1175,6,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2517.65,2520.16,"Ah, Justice Scalia, there are two different points that are being made here."
2014.13-1175,6,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2564.305,2572.8,"Well, I think there may be an exception to that principle where the whole purpose of the scheme is to enable the detection the criminal activity."
2014.13-1175,6,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2572.8,2573.095,But --
2014.13-1175,6,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2573.095,2576.79,And then the objection would be the whole scheme is bad.
2014.13-1175,6,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2592.375,2592.66,No --
2014.13-1175,6,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2592.66,2594.08,That doesn't make any sense at all.
2014.13-1175,6,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2594.08,2595.36,Because it's not the argument.
2014.13-1175,6,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2596.085,2597.33,"Well, what is -- what is the argument?"
2014.13-1175,6,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2597.33,2604.21,The argument is -- their defense of the statute is not that the -- the records are used to detect crime; it's they're used to deter crime.
2014.13-1175,6,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2622.33,2629.95,"And, Mr. Goldstein, I had thought that an equally important purpose behind these laws is to -- as you said earlier, prevent harassment."
2014.13-1175,6,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2629.95,2630.31,Yes.
2014.13-1175,6,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2630.31,2642.14,"Prevent, I don't like this hotel owner, I want to drive this hotel out of business, I'm going to be showing up in his lobby every day. But that's part of what's going on here, isn't that right?"
2014.13-1175,6,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2642.14,2648.14,"That's -- in fact, the principal thing that this Court's precedents have pointed to -- and just look at what's missing in this -- in this ordinance."
2014.13-1175,6,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2666.185,2667.99,Have we used that phrase before?
2014.13-1175,6,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2667.99,2669.04,"Which one, Your Honor?"
2014.13-1175,6,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2669.04,2670.17,Tranquility.
2014.13-1175,6,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2670.17,2671.48,I don't think that that word is --
2014.13-1175,6,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2671.48,2679.15,"We talk about privacy and all that, but I'm not sure that the Fourth Amendment should be expanded to protect the sense of tranquility."
2014.13-1175,6,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2679.15,2679.52,I'm trying to --
2014.13-1175,6,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2679.52,2682.56,I have a problem imagining tranquil hotel owners.
2014.13-1175,6,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2687.165,2697.665,"It is the sense of certainty that the Fourth Amendment provides that what you do know is that there are going to be limits on when the police come in and say, show us your papers."
2014.13-1175,6,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2699.58,2708.31,"Do -- I think there's some rule -- at least they do it, I mean, in hotels, they have these notices posted all over about where the first emergency exit is and all that."
2014.13-1175,6,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2708.31,2708.705,Yes.
2014.13-1175,6,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2708.705,2712.46,Could police come in and check to make sure the hotel has those posted --
2014.13-1175,6,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2712.46,2713.32,Yes.
2014.13-1175,6,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2713.32,2714.6,-- without any type of a warrant?
2014.13-1175,6,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2714.6,2716.365,Because they're in public spaces.
2014.13-1175,6,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2717.485,2722.38,"Well, I don't know -- is the back of a hotel room door -- I mean, is that a private place?"
2014.13-1175,6,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2722.38,2726.65,"So you're saying, say, for example, in the back of the restaurant, in the back of the kitchen, for example?"
2014.13-1175,6,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2726.65,2728.38,"No, no, I'm talking about every hotel room --"
2014.13-1175,6,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2728.38,2728.58,Yes.
2014.13-1175,6,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2728.58,2729.38,-- has one of those --
2014.13-1175,6,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2729.38,2730.18,"Oh, inside the room."
2014.13-1175,6,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2730.18,2736.85,"Can they go and say, look, you know, this is a very important thing to make sure people don't die in a big fire, we're going to make sure you've got them."
2014.13-1175,6,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2738.71,2742.59,It's a great example for us. That's actually Camara and See; that's a fire inspection regime.
2014.13-1175,6,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2760.8,2763.11,This is -- I didn't quite understand your question about harassment.
2014.13-1175,6,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2785.47,2785.605,Right.
2014.13-1175,6,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2785.605,2790.89,So exactly what does -- how does this aid in harassment of hotels?
2014.13-1175,6,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2790.89,2794.35,Because of the fact that they're requiring us to produce private records.
2014.13-1175,6,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2807.03,2808.97,"No, but it's a private -- it's a public space."
2014.13-1175,6,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2841.5,2846.09,It's the fact -- it's the fact that day after day after day we have to give them our private information.
2014.13-1175,6,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2870.11,2876.86,"I think that's -- if you had such a case-specific example, that might be one thing."
2014.13-1175,6,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2883.39,2883.67,Yes.
2014.13-1175,6,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2883.67,2892.78,"So the hotel owner says, sorry, you can't look at the registry, I want pre-compliance judicial review."
2014.13-1175,6,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2892.78,2893.625,Yes.
2014.13-1175,6,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2893.625,2897.23,What is the nature of that review?
2014.13-1175,6,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2897.23,2908.06,"The -- this Court has considered that question in the Fair Labor Standards Act, the context of the tax, the context -- and the banking context, so California Bankers, Donovan and Lone Steer."
2014.13-1175,6,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2951.545,2954.21,And those are the only objections that would be --
2014.13-1175,6,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2954.21,2954.72,Yes.
2014.13-1175,6,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2954.72,2958.47,"-- successful, harassment and using this for law enforcement?"
2014.13-1175,6,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2958.47,2958.56,Yes.
2014.13-1175,6,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2963.75,2985.52,"How many of these Courts' precedents involves a business that has been treated like a public utility? I mean, there are requirements for hotels, how big the room has to be, how many people you can put in the room, even in -- in many locations, how much you can charge for the room. The hotel owner is not like the -- like a private business."
2014.13-1175,6,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2994.48,2997.63,"The short answer -- the first question you asked is, how many times have you been asked that question."
2014.13-1175,6,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3032.65,3044.88,"But I think the question that Justice Scalia is asking is, is there a reason to think that hotels are a more heavily regulated industry than all the other industries that we can think of?"
2014.13-1175,6,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3044.88,3045.435,No.
2014.13-1175,6,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3080.24,3089.385,"But innkeepers have been regulated, not for decades, but they've been regulated for centuries and they have -- they have duties to the public that are enforceable."
2014.13-1175,6,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3089.385,3089.915,So --
2014.13-1175,6,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3089.915,3092.67,And I'm just puzzled by this case.
2014.13-1175,6,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3100.26,3102.04,"Ah, that we disagree with, Justice Kennedy."
2014.13-1175,6,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3119.725,3125.82,"Motel 6 does this? Jeez, I've never -- I've never received anything from them. (Laughter.)"
2014.13-1175,6,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3125.82,3126.745,My goodness.
2014.13-1175,6,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3126.745,3131.98,You may not be in their frequent guest -- (Laughter.)
2014.13-1175,6,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3131.98,3153.48,"But, nobody doubts -- remember, this is an ordinance that applies to the Four Seasons and the Ritz-Carlton and everything else. They've just carved out a very specific subset. And, Justice Kennedy, while we are attentive to the point that you can't -- we are not asserting and the guests are not asserting Fourth Amendment rights here, let's not lose sight of the fact that these records can show very, very personal information."
2014.13-1175,6,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3159.195,3165.37,"Once again, you're not complaining about the privacy interests of the guests. That's not your complaint here."
2014.13-1175,6,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3165.37,3166.355,That's the point.
2014.13-1175,6,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3236.98,3248.19,"99.4 percent jurisdictions, does that include -- are you comparing the little hamlet in Indiana with Los Angeles or New York? Does New York City have something like this?"
2014.13-1175,6,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3248.19,3254.07,"I don't know the answer to the question of that particular city, but, Your Honor, they're including big and small and so am I."
2014.13-1175,6,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3257.44,3262.135,"But -- you're -- you're saying, oh, the hotel has a private interest because it wants to know who its customers."
2014.13-1175,6,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3271.86,3274.07,"Well, that's because your precedents say they can, Your Honor."
2014.13-1175,6,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3276.44,3278.0,"Well, that means it's true. (Laughter.)"
2014.13-1175,6,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3278.0,3289.91,"Well -- and hence, my answer yes. But my point is this: Because they can do it here, Justice Kennedy, they can do it everywhere. The government can require any business to keep track of all of its transactions and all of its customers."
2014.13-1175,6,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3318.34,3326.88,"A subpoena -- a subpoena is worthless when what is sought is something that can be easily destroyed, hidden or falsified."
2014.13-1175,6,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3357.46,3364.5,"Lone Steer says the opposite with all respect, and that is, the records there are how many hours did someone work at what amount of pay."
2014.13-1175,6,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3388.31,3396.905,You think -- you think payroll records in general are no more complicated than the ledger at a motel that runs by the hour?
2014.13-1175,6,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3396.905,3407.295,"In the relevant respect, Justice Alito, if the question is, did the person work 50 hours or 35 and the record says 50 -- the actual record would be 30 -- 50 and I just want to fill in 35, yes."
2014.13-1175,6,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3414.625,3418.645,"Thank you, counsel. Four minutes, Mr. Rosenkranz."
2014.13-1175,7,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,3418.645,3425.4,"Thank you, Your Honor. Let me start with the facial point and then circle back to the -- to the merits."
2014.13-1175,7,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3491.15,3493.22,But that's -- that's not the statute.
2014.13-1175,7,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,3499.745,3500.05,Well --
2014.13-1175,7,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3500.05,3500.33,Without this --
2014.13-1175,7,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,3500.33,3502.565,"So not that one, Your Honor."
2014.13-1175,7,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3545.2,3548.025,I'm still very confused about this.
2014.13-1175,7,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,3580.735,3581.62,"Understood, Your Honor."
2014.13-1175,7,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3581.62,3594.595,"You're entitled to a warrant, you're entitled to a subpoena, you're entitled -- that's what they're challenging, which is they're not challenging all of the other reasons why the police could go in legitimately --"
2014.13-1175,7,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,3594.595,3595.0,"Well, Your Honor --"
2014.13-1175,7,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3595.0,3597.08,-- as an exception to the Fourth Amendment.
2014.13-1175,7,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,3610.79,3611.31,"Right, Your Honor."
2014.13-1175,7,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3611.31,3613.16,Is the process here right.
2014.13-1175,7,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,3613.16,3625.83,"Understood. And so let's not talk about the exceptions. Let's talk about another example where the motel continues to keep the register in the open, like they did for 100 years, and then snatches it away when the police come."
2014.13-1175,7,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3626.02,3628.855,"You know something, but that's a different issue."
2014.13-1175,7,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,3630.37,3631.21,"Well, right."
2014.13-1175,7,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3631.51,3632.905,And how often do you think that's going to happen?
2014.13-1175,7,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,3632.905,3638.73,"And for that reason, they would have no expectation of privacy and the Fourth Amendment calculus would be totally different."
2014.13-1175,7,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3639.24,3640.99,"Well, but then it's not a search at all."
2014.13-1175,7,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,3644.2,3645.24,"Well, no, your Honor."
2014.13-1175,7,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3648.36,3650.99,You're saying that they have no expectation of privacy.
2014.13-1175,7,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,3656.565,3657.75,"Well, no, exactly."
2014.13-1175,7,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3667.49,3670.15,"Counsel, our questions intruded on your rebuttal time."
2014.13-1175,7,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,3671.48,3678.23,"Thank you, Your Honor. So let me just emphasize that this is a very narrow rule that we're talking about."
2014.13-1175,7,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3744.885,0.0,"Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted."
