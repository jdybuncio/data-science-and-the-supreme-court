1970.113,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,14.53,"We'll hear argument in number 113, Decker against Harper and Row."
1970.113,0,34461,lee_a_freeman_jr,,14.53,27.453,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1970.113,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,27.453,29.876,"Mr. Freeman, you may proceed."
1970.113,0,34461,lee_a_freeman_jr,,29.876,53.415,This case arises in the midst of several antitrust actions which have been brought on behalf of public schools and libraries and parochial schools seeking damages for an alleged price-fixing conspiracy among numerous publishers and jobbers in the sale of library editions of children's books to institutional schools and libraries.
1970.113,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,613.611,615.205,Are we bound to?
1970.113,0,34461,lee_a_freeman_jr,,615.205,621.474,"Well, the Seventh Circuit has created a conflict among the Circuits as a law before the Seventh Circuit ruled."
1970.113,1,26553,h_templeton_brown,,1736.556,1739.618,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1970.113,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1822.023,1831.324,Isn't it true that he did permit the production of some of the debriefing statements?
1970.113,1,26553,h_templeton_brown,,1831.324,1836.615,"I think there may have been -- well, there may have been a limited number to which an objection was raised."
1970.113,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1836.615,1839.485,Yes and those are in the record now?
1970.113,1,26553,h_templeton_brown,,1839.485,1840.027,Both would be.
1970.113,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1840.027,1849.607,"Those were submitted sealed to the judge, he made his ruling but the ones that were ordered produced are now available?"
1970.113,1,26553,h_templeton_brown,,1849.607,1850.486,There was no objection to those.
1970.113,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1850.486,1851.577,And they're now available?
1970.113,1,26553,h_templeton_brown,,1851.577,1852.882,That's correct and the other --
1970.113,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1852.882,1862.482,Would you suggest that the contents of those debriefing statements in terms of what they cover and what they don't cover are irrelevant to decision of this case?
1970.113,1,26553,h_templeton_brown,,1862.482,1862.63,Oh!
1970.113,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1863.789,1864.631,Why?
1970.113,1,26553,h_templeton_brown,,1864.631,1870.742,"Well, in the first place it seems to me that an attorney-client privilege has to be determined at the time that a communication takes place."
1970.113,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1873.299,1877.502,"Well, I know, but what goes in the deciding whether the privilege would?"
1970.113,1,26553,h_templeton_brown,,1877.502,1886.013,"Well, I would like come to that in the course of my argument that the question is what the -- what is the nature of the communication under what circumstances as the communication had?"
1970.113,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1957.88,1968.017,"Were the representatives of the bar associations, were their voices heard before the Committee and trusted with developing the new federal rules of evidence?"
1970.113,1,26553,h_templeton_brown,,1968.017,1972.163,"Well, let me advert to that Mr. Justice White."
1970.113,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2021.834,2029.096,You don't know then whether the Bar Association says -- the association's (Inaudible)?
1970.113,1,26553,h_templeton_brown,,2029.096,2036.521,"Well, I think that they have but I -- it would be really a hearsay as far as I'm concerned as to what they've done."
1970.113,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2845.307,2864.287,"Mr. Brown, an employee of a corporation or the employee of an individual certainly anticipates that he might be called as a witness and is sued against his employer and his employer knows that too, I suppose."
1970.113,1,26553,h_templeton_brown,,2891.437,2899.11,"Well, I would say Mr. Justice White that if the matter is a simple as the one that you stated that you might just as well discard the attorney-client privilege."
1970.113,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2899.11,2904.164,"Well, I still ask you (Voice Overlap) what's the significance of the privilege?"
1970.113,1,26553,h_templeton_brown,,2904.164,2904.529,Alright.
1970.113,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2950.46,2967.84,"That all may be true but the problems only going to come up isn't it when there might be a variation between what the employee would tell counsel and what he would he say on the stand, is that what worries people or?"
1970.113,1,26553,h_templeton_brown,,2967.84,2978.786,"Well, let me -- I think that the best thing I can do Your Honor is to refer to authority that I have always considered to be very persuasive to me."
1970.113,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3014.784,3034.404,"Well, I understand that and I have read that before, but what -- again, just tell me what deterrent effect is there going to be on an employee in communicating with counsel which seems to be the main point here?"
1970.113,1,26553,h_templeton_brown,,3041.814,3055.048,I don't -- I think as I said before that this gets back the way question of human nature as much as anything else and regardless of how human should act.
1970.113,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3065.386,3071.404,This is really in some way as you think a handmaid and other the privilege against self-incrimination maybe?
1970.113,1,26553,h_templeton_brown,,3071.404,3072.333,"No, I do not."
1970.113,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3083.59,3088.921,"And none of the values, none of the same values underlie the attorney-client privilege you have?"
1970.113,1,26553,h_templeton_brown,,3088.921,3090.684,"Well, some of the same values underlie it."
1970.113,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3095.784,3096.073,Yes.
1970.113,1,26553,h_templeton_brown,,3096.073,3113.389,"If you say that the privilege against the self -- if you take the argument it seems to me or the question, I beg your pardon, that's been propounded to me and carried what's logical extreme then what's the value, why should you have the privilege against self-incrimination if the employee is going to have to except in the criminal case (Voice Overlap) why --"
1970.113,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3113.389,3115.36,"Well, that's the reason."
1970.113,1,26553,h_templeton_brown,,3117.959,3120.36,"Well, and that's precisely what I think is true here and this is --"
1970.113,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3120.36,3138.305,"Well, what are those values that underlie the attorney-client privilege that you're talking about that indicate that although he is going to have to say the same thing on the stand nevertheless the lawyer shouldn't have to say what he told him?"
1970.113,1,26553,h_templeton_brown,,3138.305,3140.489,"Well, I'll be perfectly frank."
1970.113,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3173.88,3182.569,"So, it's a -- it's really as much of this argument goes to the impact on counsel as on the client?"
1970.113,1,26553,h_templeton_brown,,3182.569,3190.615,I did not intend to mean that -- intend to mean it as such because I think that if I do not feel free.
1970.113,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3232.636,3245.384,Are you really saying that anything that undermines full candid disclosure by client to a lawyer is to that degree inhibits the whole process?
1970.113,1,26553,h_templeton_brown,,3245.384,3250.878,I am saying that and I have thought that this was generally recognized.
1970.113,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3260.206,3266.246,"If the values are there, I would think it would be help to restate them which you're now doing?"
1970.113,1,26553,h_templeton_brown,,3266.246,3269.119,"Yes, well."
1970.113,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3269.119,3277.097,I welcome those that and your point and when your point is that you don't think you want to be a built-in an impeachment mechanism for the opposition?
1970.113,1,26553,h_templeton_brown,,3277.097,3278.7,I certainly do not.
1970.113,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3362.385,3365.179,Are you really suggesting that this is in respect to privilege?
1970.113,1,26553,h_templeton_brown,,3369.818,3373.956,"I am talking about, that's correct."
1970.113,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3442.813,3443.553,May I ask you?
1970.113,1,26553,h_templeton_brown,,3443.553,3443.964,Certainly.
1970.113,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3443.964,3453.878,"If the corporate president interviewed the sales manager and makes a memorandum of it, is that something of discovery?"
1970.113,1,26553,h_templeton_brown,,3453.878,3456.189,Certainly.
1970.113,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3461.632,3469.284,"And if the lawyer does the interviewing and writes a memorandum, he gives to the president that's not so self-discriminating?"
1970.113,1,26553,h_templeton_brown,,3469.284,3470.592,That is not.
1970.113,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3482.117,3483.416,Not necessarily.
1970.113,1,26553,h_templeton_brown,,3483.416,3486.55,"Not at all, sir."
1970.113,2,34461,lee_a_freeman_jr,,3696.946,3708.307,"To touch briefly on a few points, we submit that it is not possible as defendants wish to mechanically apply the individual attorney privilege to the corporate context."
1970.113,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3851.711,3852.609,Thank you Mr. Freeman.
