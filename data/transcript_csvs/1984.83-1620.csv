1984.83-1620,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,9.598,We will hear arguments next in First National Bank of Atlanta against Bartow County Board.
1984.83-1620,0,20444,charles_t_zink,,12.078,14.87,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1984.83-1620,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,419.873,426.889,"Well there, Mr. Zink, there was an actual discrimination, wasn't there, in the Idaho situation against the federal obligations?"
1984.83-1620,0,20444,charles_t_zink,,426.889,429.32,"No, Your Honor, I do not believe so."
1984.83-1620,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,468.804,480.671,"Well, now, do you think it was the secretary's feeling there that there was an element of unfair treatment, differential treatment between federal obligations and other obligations?"
1984.83-1620,0,20444,charles_t_zink,,480.671,486.715,"No, sir, I don't believe that was the problem, because I think they treated all exempt income the same way."
1984.83-1620,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,504.598,515.446,Do you think it is true about what the Supreme Court of Georgia has done here that the Georgia formula does not discriminate against federal obligations?
1984.83-1620,0,20444,charles_t_zink,,515.446,521.189,"No, sir, I don't think it discriminates; I just think it violates the statute."
1984.83-1620,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,521.189,534.387,"In your view, Mr. Zink, the state had to treat this as though the bank had no federal income producing assets at all?"
1984.83-1620,0,20444,charles_t_zink,,535.179,536.651,"Yes, Your Honor, that's correct."
1984.83-1620,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,568.999,578.015,"Mr. Zink, does that mean that any time a bank had federal bonds of a value greater than the bank's net worth, there could be no net worth tax obligation?"
1984.83-1620,0,20444,charles_t_zink,,578.015,579.717,"--That is correct, Your Honor."
1984.83-1620,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,642.389,655.406,"Mr. Zink, if we follow your position here, do you think the states will be given the franchise taxes at greater cost to the banks?"
1984.83-1620,0,20444,charles_t_zink,,655.406,656.968,"They could, Your Honor."
1984.83-1620,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,760.379,764.12,"Well, at least proportionality was upheld in Atlas Life, wasn't it?"
1984.83-1620,0,20444,charles_t_zink,,764.12,766.4,"--Yes, sir, but not in the net worth context."
1984.83-1620,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,769.432,775.078,"Well, the cases are different, but at least it indicates a proportionality approach."
1984.83-1620,0,20444,charles_t_zink,,775.078,779.129,"I think that... yes, sir, I think the... yes, Your Honor."
1984.83-1620,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,789.107,800.815,"While I have you interrupted, do you think that the case that we had, American Bank and Trust Company against Dallas County, helps you or hurts you in your case?"
1984.83-1620,0,20444,charles_t_zink,,800.815,802.317,"It makes this case, Your Honor."
1984.83-1620,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,956.746,969.916,Mr. Horowitz.
1984.83-1620,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,969.916,975.609,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1984.83-1620,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1123.385,1124.206,May I interrupt?
1984.83-1620,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1128.177,1129.719,"--In some cases, if--"
1984.83-1620,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1129.719,1134.091,"It wouldn't if they sold off non-federal and exchanged it for federal; then it would go down, wouldn't it?"
1984.83-1620,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1134.091,1135.052,--That's true.
1984.83-1620,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1135.052,1138.555,"I mean, they don't just get assets out of thin air."
1984.83-1620,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1140.167,1140.708,"Well, they can get assets out of thin air."
1984.83-1620,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1144.9,1151.585,"Yes, but if you just started with a given balance sheet, and then buy or sell what you have got, the more federal obligations you buy, the lower your taxes."
1984.83-1620,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1152.286,1153.475,That's true.
1984.83-1620,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1181.785,1185.418,"Mr. Horowitz, I'll ask you the same question I asked Mr. Zink."
1984.83-1620,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1195.104,1198.764,"Oh, I don't know whether it would be a greater cost to the government or not."
1984.83-1620,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1236.77,1240.142,"Well, it may not be the issue, but I think it is a practical effect."
1984.83-1620,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1242.994,1247.228,"--Well, we won't be in here fighting franchise taxes if the statute isn't amended."
1984.83-1620,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1253.851,1256.404,You will cheerfully acquiesce?
1984.83-1620,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1256.404,1258.415,I don't know about that.
1984.83-1620,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1544.841,1553.097,Ms. Evans.
1984.83-1620,2,25253,grace_p_evans,,1553.097,1558.64,"Mr. Chief Justice Burger, and may it please the Court:"
1984.83-1620,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1621.545,1624.928,"It doesn't produce the same result, does it?"
1984.83-1620,2,25253,grace_p_evans,,1624.928,1626.508,"--Yes, Your Honor, it does."
1984.83-1620,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1626.508,1633.272,That would happen if you treated the bank as owning no federal obligations at all?
1984.83-1620,2,25253,grace_p_evans,,1633.272,1638.775,"If the bank owned no federal obligations at all, they would be entitled to no deduction."
1984.83-1620,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2536.401,2542.025,"Well, what percent would you say remains subject under C&S's example?"
1984.83-1620,2,25253,grace_p_evans,,2542.025,2547.749,"--Under C&S's example, all federal obligation values are removed from the tax."
1984.83-1620,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2583.833,2589.206,"Ms. Evans, which is the larger of the two banks, C&S, or First Atlanta?"
1984.83-1620,2,25253,grace_p_evans,,2589.206,2593.958,C&S in its brief stated that it was the largest bank in Georgia.
1984.83-1620,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2593.958,2606.988,"Can you spell out for me... maybe you already have, but would you do it again if you have... why C&S is on one side of this case as an amicus on the other side of this of this case from First Atlanta?"
1984.83-1620,2,25253,grace_p_evans,,2606.988,2624.589,"Your Honor, I hesitate to speak for C&S, but I would imagine... and as they pointed out in their brief... that C&S views the pro rata method as a fair method of fully excluding tax exempt values from the tax base."
1984.83-1620,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2624.589,2637.608,"Well, it is rather unusual, isn't it, where perhaps the two largest banks in Georgia, I don't know whether that is so, but anyway, two substantial banks are taking opposite positions on this rather vital banking case?"
1984.83-1620,2,25253,grace_p_evans,,2637.608,2655.84,"Well, we would also point out, Your Honor, that the Pennsylvania Bankers Association also endorses Georgia's method and recognizes that this method is a fair method of removing in full federal obligation values without sheltering taxable assets."
1984.83-1620,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2670.941,2674.101,May I ask a question about your computations?
1984.83-1620,2,25253,grace_p_evans,,2674.101,2674.452,Yes.
1984.83-1620,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2674.452,2679.964,"As I understand it, what you do is you figure out this ratio and take the percentage out of net worth."
1984.83-1620,2,25253,grace_p_evans,,2700.828,2701.919,Well--
1984.83-1620,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2701.919,2710.825,"But if I am right on what you said, I don't know how that squares with the language of the statute that says you don't consider the amount of federal obligations."
1984.83-1620,2,25253,grace_p_evans,,2713.727,2720.861,"--Well, now, the statute says that federal obligations cannot be considered in the computation of the tax."
1984.83-1620,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2720.861,2721.432,Right.
1984.83-1620,2,25253,grace_p_evans,,2721.432,2725.576,"And this Court defined ""considered"" to mean ""included in the accounting""."
1984.83-1620,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2727.005,2727.426,I see.
1984.83-1620,2,25253,grace_p_evans,,2727.426,2729.088,--from the computation of the tax--
1984.83-1620,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2729.088,2732.451,So you're saying that's not considering it within the meaning of the statute?
1984.83-1620,2,25253,grace_p_evans,,2732.451,2736.161,"--That's correct, because they are not included in the accounting, in the computation of the tax."
1984.83-1620,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2738.662,2739.594,Thank you.
1984.83-1620,2,25253,grace_p_evans,,2739.594,2746.189,"We submit that Georgia's method would, if anything, decrease the cost of federal borrowing."
1984.83-1620,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2849.817,2851.119,You're very welcome.
1984.83-1620,3,20444,charles_t_zink,,2852.348,2854.03,"If it please the Court, briefly:"
1984.83-1620,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3036.76,3039.133,"Thank you, counsel, the case is submitted."
