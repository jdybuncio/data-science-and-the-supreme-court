1975.74-6257,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,42.557,"We will hear arguments next in 74-6257, Gregg against Georgia."
1975.74-6257,0,25492,g_hughel_harrison,,45.017,49.695,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1975.74-6257,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,534.409,539.33,"So, it deprived him of an opportunity to find him not guilty to acquit him totally?"
1975.74-6257,0,25492,g_hughel_harrison,,539.33,541.471,"No sir, certainly I think there is a --"
1975.74-6257,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,541.471,544.019,"(Inaudible) factor is always there, is it not?"
1975.74-6257,0,25492,g_hughel_harrison,,544.019,560.583,"Yes sir, Mr. Chief Justice, but also as a matter of right, I think a jury, at least in Georgia, has a right to convict of a lesser included offense, particularly in a capital case."
1975.74-6257,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,565.343,571.145,"You are (Inaudible) for another separate area apart from the Eighth Amendment argument, I take it?"
1975.74-6257,0,25492,g_hughel_harrison,,571.145,580.555,"Not on necessity Your Honor, I think it comes back down to show that whether we use equal protection in this sense of what happened to Allen."
1975.74-6257,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,652.698,667.889,"Do you take the position that the presence or existence of that discretion is fatal to the Eighth Amendment arguments, you go along with the arguments, in other words of Mr. Amsterdam and others?"
1975.74-6257,0,25492,g_hughel_harrison,,667.889,690.216,"I would follow that argument Mr. Chief Justice and particularly to this point, that in the end result, whatever it might -- what process we might have to get to that, that here under this statute, the arbitrariness no guidelines."
1975.74-6257,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,715.369,718.835,But has no power over a (Inaudible)?
1975.74-6257,0,25492,g_hughel_harrison,,718.835,725.201,Except Your Honor when it becomes really effective in the breast of the court for trial.
1975.74-6257,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,737.022,741.455,Did the successor reinstate that to go ahead with the trial?
1975.74-6257,0,25492,g_hughel_harrison,,741.455,744.013,"Sir, I am sorry I did not understood you."
1975.74-6257,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,744.013,749.35,"The successor, suppose that county attorney and the prosecutor were removed then by the Governor or some of the process."
1975.74-6257,0,25492,g_hughel_harrison,,753.309,771.396,"Of course, there is that remedy to the ballot box, but had to precede the re-indict and I am sure the argument might be made, well, he does not indict, but for all practical purposes he does, because he attends upon the grand jury, he prepares the indictments and submits them."
1975.74-6257,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,806.746,808.278,"He had testified, did he?"
1975.74-6257,0,25492,g_hughel_harrison,,808.278,817.762,"No sir, his only appearance in this case was to be brought, adjunct to the courtroom for the purpose of identification, that was all."
1975.74-6257,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,817.762,820.513,Verifying him or his identifying your client?
1975.74-6257,0,25492,g_hughel_harrison,,820.513,826.319,"No sir, I believe it was for the purpose of an officer identifying Sam Allan if I recall it correctly on it."
1975.74-6257,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,826.319,828.402,My understanding was Allan did not testify?
1975.74-6257,0,25492,g_hughel_harrison,,828.402,829.465,He did not.
1975.74-6257,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,926.82,928.121,The Appendix to the brief of respondent?
1975.74-6257,0,25492,g_hughel_harrison,,928.121,931.045,"Of respondent, yes."
1975.74-6257,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1023.069,1024.795,Was this one covered in the instruction?
1975.74-6257,0,25492,g_hughel_harrison,,1024.795,1027.127,This was given in the instructions Your Honor.
1975.74-6257,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1060.948,1063.414,Where?
1975.74-6257,0,25492,g_hughel_harrison,,1063.414,1070.091,"This is at the top of the page Mr. Chief Justice on the along B27, 25, 34"
1975.74-6257,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1070.091,1074.821,Is that something you cannot follow?
1975.74-6257,0,25492,g_hughel_harrison,,1074.821,1083.167,I think it is -- it creates the confusion of what I have if you are going to enumerate the statutory condition.
1975.74-6257,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1305.593,1308.193,"You cited among others that Dulles case, did you not?"
1975.74-6257,0,25492,g_hughel_harrison,,1308.193,1309.018,Yes sir.
1975.74-6257,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1309.018,1312.725,Because that has some language in it that is not very favorable to your side?
1975.74-6257,0,25492,g_hughel_harrison,,1312.725,1325.035,"Yes sir, but I believe the theory or the idea there of looking into the punishment is present Your Honor, Mr. Justice."
1975.74-6257,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1339.166,1342.144,Thank you Mr. Harrison.
1975.74-6257,1,25210,g_thomas_davis,,1355.698,1359.133,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1975.74-6257,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1634.953,1637.933,"This was not a bifurcated preceding at the trial, was it?"
1975.74-6257,1,25210,g_thomas_davis,,1637.933,1640.795,"Yes, Your Honor."
1975.74-6257,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1646.836,1666.539,"With the judge instructing the jury at the second phase giving him for consideration three of the statutory aggravating circumstances and what if any mitigating circumstances and in his report to the appellate court, he said they were not"
1975.74-6257,1,25210,g_thomas_davis,,1666.539,1666.935,That is right.
1975.74-6257,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1678.344,1681.247,Was anything proffered on behalf of the defendant?
1975.74-6257,1,25210,g_thomas_davis,,1681.247,1683.141,"There was nothing proffered, Your Honor."
1975.74-6257,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1694.824,1713.733,"(Inaudible) said that there were two stages to, except the preceding that there are sometimes in Georgia which do not call for separate penalty preceding, is that true?"
1975.74-6257,1,25210,g_thomas_davis,,1713.733,1715.215,I am not aware of any Your Honor.
1975.74-6257,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1724.332,1729.519,What issue is submitted to the jury in Georgia at the second trial?
1975.74-6257,1,25210,g_thomas_davis,,1729.519,1730.787,Punishment.
1975.74-6257,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1730.787,1737.602,"Simply that -- I have not read that instruction, what does it say in substance?"
1975.74-6257,1,25210,g_thomas_davis,,1737.602,1747.482,The instruction as I pointed out to the Court was just what the court charged in the mitigating factor.
1975.74-6257,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1782.303,1790.096,"In this case as I understand it, no evidence of mitigating circumstances was offered by the defendant?"
1975.74-6257,1,25210,g_thomas_davis,,1790.096,1797.66,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1975.74-6257,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1797.66,1809.501,The jury in bringing in a verdict of recommending death or for bringing in the verdict of the death sentence must include or at least one of the statutory aggravating circumstances --
1975.74-6257,1,25210,g_thomas_davis,,1809.501,1809.908,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1975.74-6257,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1809.908,1815.006,-- as found at least one in this sole state and identify which one --
1975.74-6257,1,25210,g_thomas_davis,,1815.006,1815.607,In writing --
1975.74-6257,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1815.607,1816.257,-- in writing --
1975.74-6257,1,25210,g_thomas_davis,,1816.257,1818.664,-- beyond a reasonable doubt.
1975.74-6257,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1951.782,1954.897,(Inaudible)
1975.74-6257,1,25210,g_thomas_davis,,1954.897,1960.679,"They submitted evidence, the jury returned it in the Supreme Court of Georgia."
1975.74-6257,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1960.679,1967.948,The Supreme Court can review the specific decision of the jury?
1975.74-6257,1,25210,g_thomas_davis,,1967.948,1971.131,Very definitely.
1975.74-6257,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2193.361,2197.767,"This statute has been in effect since 1973, Mr. Davis?"
1975.74-6257,1,25210,g_thomas_davis,,2197.767,2197.911,Yes.
1975.74-6257,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2198.849,2204.029,And that you happen to know how many death sentences have been imposed under it?
1975.74-6257,1,25210,g_thomas_davis,,2204.029,2205.959,By our records 55.
1975.74-6257,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2205.959,2211.679,"And how many of those, if any, have been set aside by Supreme Court of Georgia?"
1975.74-6257,1,25210,g_thomas_davis,,2211.679,2214.569,One has been completely set aside.
1975.74-6257,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2227.915,2231.736,What do you mean completely compared to what?
1975.74-6257,1,25210,g_thomas_davis,,2232.307,2237.479,"For example compared to this case Gregg, Gregg was sentenced to four death sentences by the jury."
1975.74-6257,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2237.479,2246.874,"And they were two sentence, two death sentences, but let us talk then about people not how many sentences imposed on it."
1975.74-6257,1,25210,g_thomas_davis,,2263.156,2263.649,That is correct.
1975.74-6257,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2263.649,2267.65,And he got a new trial order or what happened to that case?
1975.74-6257,1,25210,g_thomas_davis,,2267.65,2271.409,There would a new trial as to punishment.
1975.74-6257,1,25210,g_thomas_davis,,2273.394,2276.274,No possibility of the death sentence.
1975.74-6257,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2293.412,2298.391,That will involve the co-defendants today or what?
1975.74-6257,1,25210,g_thomas_davis,,2298.391,2300.154,It depends on what stage of the process they are.
1975.74-6257,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2300.154,2303.67,"Some had not yet arrived at the Supreme Court, not been decided --"
1975.74-6257,1,25210,g_thomas_davis,,2303.67,2304.634,None have been decided.
1975.74-6257,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2310.719,2321.56,"So there are as I understand your answer, 54 people now under sentence of death in Georgia, but some of whose convictions have not yet been reviewed on appeal."
1975.74-6257,1,25210,g_thomas_davis,,2321.56,2324.982,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1975.74-6257,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2773.962,2790.567,"Mr. Attorney General, might I ask what your judgment is on the comparison between this group of 55, who now have received the death sentence as to the pre Furman experience under the statute, would you say that there are more or less death penalties than there were before?"
1975.74-6257,1,25210,g_thomas_davis,,2791.8,2794.228,"I really do not, Your Honor, I do not what to --"
1975.74-6257,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2794.228,2804.626,"I do not want you to state if you do not have a thought already in line and secondly could you tell us how many of the 55 are for rape and how many for murder, if you know?"
1975.74-6257,1,25210,g_thomas_davis,,2804.626,2806.681,"Of the total 55, I could not say."
1975.74-6257,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2826.011,2841.074,"Any for robbery, I know for these robberies death sentences were set aside as an comparability basis and that would imply that there are no death sentences for robbery, although the statute does provide for it."
1975.74-6257,1,25210,g_thomas_davis,,2841.074,2842.253,The statute provides it.
1975.74-6257,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2859.17,2869.637,"Did not quite say that it would, that under Georgia law it could never be imposed, no reason why it should, it said that?"
1975.74-6257,1,25210,g_thomas_davis,,2869.637,2883.258,Of course what the Court said would have to be considered in light of the facts present in Gregg and of course the same thing with the rape that was present in Coley.
1975.74-6257,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2965.363,2970.169,Mr. Davis.
