1988.87-1303,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,11.996,"We'll hear argument next in No. 87-1303, Allegheny Pittsburgh Coal Company v. County Commission of Webster County, and a companion case."
1988.87-1303,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,71.348,75.629,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:"
1988.87-1303,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,194.846,203.42,"Well, Mr. Prettyman, are you suggesting that if there's a sale of a piece of property, the assessor has to go in and revalue all the adjoining property right then?"
1988.87-1303,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,203.42,212.369,--The statute tells the assessor to revalue property at its true and actual value.
1988.87-1303,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,212.369,214.587,"Well, that's a matter of West Virginia law."
1988.87-1303,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,214.587,225.161,"It is indeed, and consequently, she is under both a constitutional and a statutory duty in West Virginia which is very different than some other states, to--"
1988.87-1303,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,225.161,228.394,You mean a federal constitutional duty?
1988.87-1303,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,228.394,247.574,"--Her federal constitutional duty is to make certain that there's no discrimination between like properties, and if they are going to value at a current value those properties which are sold, she must devise some system by which she, on some kind of current basis, revalues other properties."
1988.87-1303,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,252.228,253.963,"Well, must she rush in every year?"
1988.87-1303,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,253.963,256.884,"--The states have varied on that, industry."
1988.87-1303,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,256.884,261.179,"Well, but I mean as a matter... you are talking about a matter of federal equal protection doctrine, I take it."
1988.87-1303,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,261.179,291.058,"What we say is that on any kind of a regular basis we would... whatever the circumstances are in the state... in some states it's every year, in some states it's every other year, and in some states it's every third or fourth year, but at least if there is a good faith attempt by the assessor to keep up with current market value, if that's the standard that they're going to use, then there cannot be the disparities that show up in this case."
1988.87-1303,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,312.222,314.519,There's some dispute over that.
1988.87-1303,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,326.655,329.904,"Well, Your Honor, it doesn't make any difference whether that's true or not."
1988.87-1303,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,403.219,405.781,--Would it be lawful to have this kind of a system?
1988.87-1303,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,425.789,426.304,Sure.
1988.87-1303,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,426.304,439.597,"Except that where a property is sold, you have a more reliable valuation, so particular properties that are sold you reassess on the basis of the sales price."
1988.87-1303,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,439.597,479.111,"If your system in the state, which it is in West Virginia, to value property on the basis of current market value and you are in fact valuing some properties, namely, recently sold properties, on that basis, and a disparity grows because of the system that you simply... that you just stated, and in fact the other are not being currently market valued, then you could indeed have discrimination, unconstitutional discrimination, particularly if you have the kind of disparities you have here."
1988.87-1303,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,517.207,527.766,Is it your position that the classification used here could never be adopted by the legislature into a constitutional scheme?
1988.87-1303,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,527.766,532.731,"No, sir, but I want to emphasize that there are no classifications here, either--"
1988.87-1303,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,532.731,541.744,"No, but I'm saying... you're saying that, then that this could be a constitutional scheme if the legislature mandated it?"
1988.87-1303,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,541.744,545.68,--Could be but you would test it under a rational basis test.
1988.87-1303,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,547.493,550.898,"Well, why isn't it a due process argument that you have here then?"
1988.87-1303,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,562.066,572.375,"--In, in that case, in the case that you posited, Justice Kennedy, let's suppose the state came along and they said we're going to make two classifications of property owners."
1988.87-1303,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,609.048,623.792,"Well, I'm still not certain why, then, this isn't just a case, if we can assume at least for the moment that this could be a constitutional scheme, why this isn't just a state where the... case where the state law has been violated."
1988.87-1303,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,623.792,626.088,--The state law has been what?
1988.87-1303,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,626.088,627.478,Has been violated.
1988.87-1303,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,638.271,642.816,"Well, I have not said for a moment that they could necessarily convince you of this."
1988.87-1303,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,668.992,671.195,"Well, may I, may I go back one more time then?"
1988.87-1303,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,671.195,671.632,Sure.
1988.87-1303,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,671.632,684.096,"I take it, then you're arguing that the state could not constitutionally reach the result by statute that it in fact has reached here by administrative practice."
1988.87-1303,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,684.096,704.275,"What I'm saying is that, that it is conceivable that the state could somehow come up with good grounds for this kind of distinction that might persuade this Court that it had a rational basis and the state could do it."
1988.87-1303,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,736.543,739.621,"Where these claims made to the Supreme Court of West Virginia, Mr. Prettyman?"
1988.87-1303,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,739.621,740.198,--Pardon me?
1988.87-1303,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,740.198,746.977,"Were these claims of statutory and constitutional, of state constitutional violation made to the Supreme Court of West Virginia?"
1988.87-1303,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,746.977,748.055,"In other cases, the--"
1988.87-1303,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,748.055,749.915,I mean in this case.
1988.87-1303,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,749.915,757.318,"--In this case, the Supreme Court of West Virginia come down with what I consider a rather odd decision because--"
1988.87-1303,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,757.318,769.656,"Well, but I asked you not what kind of a decision it came down with but whether these claims were made to the Supreme Court of West Virginia, of state statutory violation and state constitutional violation."
1988.87-1303,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,769.656,776.809,--There was no claim made that somehow this conformed to the state constitution.
1988.87-1303,1,46441,william_ullrich,,1730.528,1745.413,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please Court:"
1988.87-1303,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1764.031,1772.698,"Could you tell me, just so we're on the last topic we were discussing, is this state law a welcome stranger law?"
1988.87-1303,1,46441,william_ullrich,,1772.698,1782.445,"I don't think that it has to be a welcome stranger law, but to the extent that it is, it's certainly defendable."
1988.87-1303,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1784.258,1786.147,"Well, what does the state law require?"
1988.87-1303,1,46441,william_ullrich,,1789.49,1791.208,"Oh, yes, Your Honor."
1988.87-1303,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1791.724,1792.224,It does.
1988.87-1303,1,46441,william_ullrich,,1801.316,1807.251,"--Justice Scalia, there are... there's more than one relevant law that applies to these facts."
1988.87-1303,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2009.184,2009.497,I don't understand.
1988.87-1303,1,46441,william_ullrich,,2016.871,2024.664,"Yes, but I need to explain that that's why I said that a comparability is being used in different fashions."
1988.87-1303,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2046.749,2053.591,What would comparability mean in the context of this case except that they were of comparable value?
1988.87-1303,1,46441,william_ullrich,,2059.964,2065.055,In the context of the--
1988.87-1303,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2065.055,2078.205,"I mean, what, they are, they have the same elevation above sea level or... obviously the only comparability that's relevant in this case is whether they are of comparable value, and to stipulate to comparability without understanding that that's what's being stipulated I can't understand."
1988.87-1303,1,46441,william_ullrich,,2078.205,2093.698,"--Well, but to construe the stipulation, respectfully, Your honor, of similarity, of geological similarity, which is the limitation that was put on the stipulation as being a concession of identity or similarity to such an extent that they should be treated as--"
1988.87-1303,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2093.698,2107.802,"So if a property's highest and best use was mining coal or its coal reserve, then a certain acre of the... acreage of the comparable property would be expected to be roughly similar in value to these value of the property in question."
1988.87-1303,1,46441,william_ullrich,,2107.802,2112.191,"--Well, that's exactly what's not a legitimate conclusion from that stipulation."
1988.87-1303,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2142.039,2147.052,You say the stipulation doesn't cover those factors; it just covers geological similarity?
1988.87-1303,1,46441,william_ullrich,,2147.052,2152.722,"--On the face of the stipulation itself, it says comparable insofar as they are geologically similar."
1988.87-1303,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2152.722,2156.143,It's certainly a silly stipulation.
1988.87-1303,1,46441,william_ullrich,,2156.143,2181.539,"And I would suggest to the Court that it was in fact a... not a stipulation that convinced convinced the circuit court of the identity of the values enough to apply a remedy that the true and actual value of the Petitioners' property should be applied to these ""comparables""."
1988.87-1303,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2253.528,2254.872,"Well, suppose we don't agree with you?"
1988.87-1303,1,46441,william_ullrich,,2278.112,2279.283,"Absolutely, Your Honor."
1988.87-1303,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2302.992,2312.816,"--Well, I guess it is clear, and I suppose you would concede, that the policy of the assessor was to revalue based on current sales."
1988.87-1303,1,46441,william_ullrich,,2312.816,2313.801,--That's correct.
1988.87-1303,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2313.801,2317.033,And other properties that weren't sold were not revalued.
1988.87-1303,1,46441,william_ullrich,,2317.033,2318.377,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1988.87-1303,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2318.377,2320.688,That seems to be clear enough.
1988.87-1303,1,46441,william_ullrich,,2320.688,2323.609,"Oh, actually, excuse me, I misspoke."
1988.87-1303,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2347.317,2356.596,"But that assessment was made if there... if the properties had been sold within the year, then that sale price was used for a revalue."
1988.87-1303,1,46441,william_ullrich,,2356.596,2361.689,"--That is one of the factors and absolutely correct, Your Honor, she did do that."
1988.87-1303,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2363.657,2370.482,And she did not use that sale value to go re-examine adjacent properties.
1988.87-1303,1,46441,william_ullrich,,2370.482,2384.116,"She did not, and Your Honor, arguably she should not or could not absent some indi... some notice, some knowledge of relevant similarity at the time that she did her assessing, her discretionary act."
1988.87-1303,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2387.318,2388.958,Isn't it her job to find similarities?
1988.87-1303,1,46441,william_ullrich,,2395.816,2401.189,"Whether it is her job or not, Your Honor, Justice Kennedy brought up I think a very important point."
1988.87-1303,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2410.842,2412.638,I don't understand that.
1988.87-1303,1,46441,william_ullrich,,2419.23,2419.683,"No, Your Honor."
1988.87-1303,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2447.0,2452.779,"--Can you, can you look to state law to see whether or not the official acted rationally or reasonably?"
1988.87-1303,1,46441,william_ullrich,,2452.779,2453.873,--You say can you?
1988.87-1303,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2453.873,2454.404,Yes.
1988.87-1303,1,46441,william_ullrich,,2454.404,2460.964,"Yes, I think so, and the state can put any standard it wants, but I think that on the record before us--"
1988.87-1303,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2460.964,2466.573,So there can be an equal protection violation for an irrational application of state law.
1988.87-1303,1,46441,william_ullrich,,2466.573,2480.051,"--Well, a state, I think it is very clear that the, that states can make classifications, and those classes, those classes have to be treated under the equal protection analysis."
1988.87-1303,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2480.051,2490.016,"Well, didn't West Virginia classify these properties the same way and say that each should be given current value annually?"
1988.87-1303,1,46441,william_ullrich,,2490.016,2497.53,West Virginia certainly classified all properties as having to be--
1988.87-1303,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2497.53,2498.373,At current value?
1988.87-1303,1,46441,william_ullrich,,2498.373,2526.503,"--Absolutely, but it's not precluded from having some subclassifications under the Carmichael analysis, and in fact, the system that they create, which says you must use recent values, you should consider the Commissioner's report unless you have a reason not to, you should add all improvements, and you certainly should take the presumption of the last entry or that property as valid, that might result--"
1988.87-1303,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2526.503,2534.797,"I mean, the problem is that this looks like such an egregious situation, actually, I mean, you have properties side by side."
1988.87-1303,1,46441,william_ullrich,,2542.654,2543.778,--That--
1988.87-1303,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2543.778,2550.604,"And the paper increase in value of the adjacent properties is just not taken into account by the assessor, apparently."
1988.87-1303,1,46441,william_ullrich,,2550.604,2563.286,"--That, that... Your Honor put your finger on one of the critical concerns, which is why I feel that it's important that this Court look behind the conclusions at a superficial level of the circuit court."
1988.87-1303,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2602.505,2615.374,But one would be more satisfied with your explanation if one felt that the assessor has made that sort of a determination rather than really doing nothing in the light of this recent sale.
1988.87-1303,1,46441,william_ullrich,,2615.374,2637.585,"That's the... we should start off with what is her job, what is the presumption, what are the presumptions that she's burdened with in performing her job, and under due process she can't go out, and in fact, had she, just because neighboring property was worth a lot more and was geologically similar, she tried to reassess somebody else's property based on that information, we'd be here on a different case, a violation--"
1988.87-1303,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2637.585,2644.63,"It happens every day, all over America, in every tax jurisdiction except apparently this one in West Virginia."
1988.87-1303,1,46441,william_ullrich,,2644.63,2677.835,"--Well, Your Honor, I do not suggest that she is precluded from doing an excellent and exotic job of assessing, but the equal protection does not place a burden on her, starting with a statutorily mandated presumption that the property was properly assessed in the previous year, and a duty to assess each piece of property accurately, that she should somehow explain why she doesn't treat this property similar to or the same as other properties."
1988.87-1303,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2677.835,2682.162,There is some fun's fun but you can't die laughing principle involved here.
1988.87-1303,1,46441,william_ullrich,,2692.284,2694.517,"Well, I think the discrepancies in value--"
1988.87-1303,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2694.517,2696.251,Given geologically similar land.
1988.87-1303,1,46441,william_ullrich,,2696.251,2715.182,"--Your Honor, I think that the, that the market tested the reality of the value of that, of those lands, and I think it is not irrational, it's certainly a reasonable estimate that some of the land was worth more just because of the fact that it was purchased for the price that it was."
1988.87-1303,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2912.963,2939.015,"Well, do you know of any cases in West Virginia, either trial court or Supreme Court, that says that under West Virginia law that it's quite proper for an assessor just to increase the assessment of a recently sole property and not assess comparable property any higher until it's sold?"
1988.87-1303,1,46441,william_ullrich,,2944.043,2946.683,"No, not that... not as stated, Your Honor."
1988.87-1303,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2977.014,2981.794,"But I just want, whoever is responsible for enforcing the West Virginia law--"
1988.87-1303,1,46441,william_ullrich,,2981.794,2982.326,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1988.87-1303,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2982.326,2998.286,"--is there any case that says in West Virginia that West Virginia's system is to tax recently sold property, or to assess recently sold property differently from property that hasn't been sold?"
1988.87-1303,1,46441,william_ullrich,,2998.286,3000.646,"As stated, I think--"
1988.87-1303,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3000.646,3005.066,"Is it any closer, is there any closer decision than this one in this case?"
1988.87-1303,1,46441,william_ullrich,,3005.066,3011.892,"--Not that I'm aware of, Your Honor, but the way you ask the question is important."
1988.87-1303,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3158.008,3170.425,"Mr. Ullrich, on this factual finding point, it can't be the case, can it, that so long as the state courts say, well, no, we haven't done anything bad, we have to accept that?"
1988.87-1303,1,46441,william_ullrich,,3170.425,3171.081,"Oh, no, Your Honor."
