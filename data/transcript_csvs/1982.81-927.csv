1982.81-927,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,7.386,We will hear arguments next in Connecticut against Johnson.
1982.81-927,0,34730,linda_k_lager,,76.903,103.112,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the principal issue in this case is whether as a matter of federal constitutional law the state prosecution is entitled to show that a constitutional error in an unobjected to portion of a lengthy, detailed, and elaborate jury instruction is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt."
1982.81-927,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,216.77,219.394,"Ms. Lager, that is seven years ago, isn't it?"
1982.81-927,0,34730,linda_k_lager,,219.394,220.689,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1982.81-927,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,220.689,224.031,Why did it take four years in the Connecticut court to get decided?
1982.81-927,0,34730,linda_k_lager,,224.031,230.437,The case was... excuse me.
1982.81-927,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,288.427,291.504,Does this happen frequently in the state of Connecticut?
1982.81-927,0,34730,linda_k_lager,,291.504,293.583,--This was a somewhat unusual circumstance.
1982.81-927,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,296.316,296.831,Just somewhat unusual?
1982.81-927,0,34730,linda_k_lager,,296.831,298.11,--with transcription.
1982.81-927,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,377.453,379.001,May I ask you a question?
1982.81-927,0,34730,linda_k_lager,,381.189,382.25,That is correct.
1982.81-927,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,382.25,393.527,"Before you get to that, I am not quite clear on your position with respect to when the harmless error argument should be made in Connecticut."
1982.81-927,0,34730,linda_k_lager,,415.86,426.092,I believe that what the Connecticut Supreme Court did is decide as a matter of federal constitutional law that it would not review the error in Truppi as being harmless.
1982.81-927,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,429.807,439.915,"Well, they cite State against Zeco, which is a Connecticut case, State against Sorbo, a Connecticut case, Elman against State, a Connecticut case, State against Briggs, a Connecticut case."
1982.81-927,0,34730,linda_k_lager,,439.915,446.443,"Those citations are to cases in which the court, the Connecticut Supreme Court was willing to apply a harmless error rule--"
1982.81-927,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,446.443,446.848,Right.
1982.81-927,0,34730,linda_k_lager,,446.848,479.272,"--and the Connecticut Supreme Court has indicated in a decision that was decided on January 5th of 1982, Turcio versus Manson, which was cited at Page 3 of the Respondent's brief, in a footnote that they would not decide in the Turcio case nor did they decide in the Johnson case, this case, that there can be no language or other circumstances which could operate to cure an intent instruction containing the phrase ""conclusively presumed""."
1982.81-927,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,527.455,535.469,I am not sure I understand what your explanation of what the state of Connecticut's position is on harmless error on this issue.
1982.81-927,0,34730,linda_k_lager,,537.969,546.949,"I think that the state of Connecticut has a very ambivalent position with the application of the harmless error rule, and I think it has adopted a case by case review."
1982.81-927,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,564.177,568.283,"Well, does that mean... I just want to be sure I follow what you are explaining to me."
1982.81-927,0,34730,linda_k_lager,,576.219,588.136,--It appears that the Connecticut Supreme Court as a matter of federal constitutional law sometimes entertains the instruction... the challenge that the error was harmless and sometimes it does not.
1982.81-927,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,601.784,605.173,"Well, is it your position that they must apply it in every case?"
1982.81-927,0,34730,linda_k_lager,,605.173,623.7,"--No, Your Honor, my position is not that they must apply the harmless error rule in every case, but if the prosecution asks the Connecticut Supreme Court to review an error for its harmlessness as a matter of federal constitutional law, that it must at least use the harmless error test."
1982.81-927,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,623.7,625.728,Let me just state it to be sure I understand it correctly.
1982.81-927,0,34730,linda_k_lager,,635.537,639.348,"In the context of an unconstitutional jury instruction, yes."
1982.81-927,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,639.348,650.812,"Ms. Lager, before you go on, would you mind telling me where 23A and 25A?"
1982.81-927,0,34730,linda_k_lager,,659.247,670.4,"At 23A, Your Honor, the court was giving a general instruction with respect to the question of a finding of intent."
1982.81-927,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,672.599,675.208,This would cover all of the offenses charged.
1982.81-927,0,34730,linda_k_lager,,675.208,675.582,--That is correct.
1982.81-927,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,696.012,705.617,"The court drew back from that instruction in the latter part, did he not, where he said,"
1982.81-927,0,34730,linda_k_lager,,722.08,735.42,"That is correct, Your Honor, and in fact the argument was made to the Connecticut Supreme Court that what was operating in this case was not merely a conclusive presumption at all, that the court's language was ambiguous."
1982.81-927,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,767.123,771.716,"In the court's opinion, that discussion relates only to the first count of attempted murder."
1982.81-927,0,34730,linda_k_lager,,781.088,800.377,What the Connecticut Supreme Court found is that this general instruction that appears at the bottom of Pages 22A and 23A of the appendix was unconstitutional despite the other language that was used in the qualifying language in the charge.
1982.81-927,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,811.527,813.808,The first being the charge of attempted murder?
1982.81-927,0,34730,linda_k_lager,,813.808,815.512,The first being the charge of attempted murder.
1982.81-927,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,815.512,819.416,That is where the 25A?
1982.81-927,0,34730,linda_k_lager,,819.416,820.508,That is correct.
1982.81-927,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,866.288,900.069,"Ms. Lager, am I right in thinking this about the state's position, that the questions as to whether the instructions considered as a whole might have improperly influenced the jury on the constitutional issue of burden of proof go into deciding whether or not there was so-called Sandstrom error, and then the question of harmless error is whether on that, on the issue that the instructions were addressed to, the evidence was so overwhelming that probably no damage was done?"
1982.81-927,0,34730,linda_k_lager,,900.069,903.333,--That is an aspect of the state's position.
1982.81-927,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,940.226,962.184,"But I think your response assumes that the Connecticut Supreme Court at any rate simply took one instruction in isolation, and said, look, this violates the Sandstrom case, and then didn't treat the other portions of the instructions that might be assumed to counteract that effect."
1982.81-927,0,34730,linda_k_lager,,992.581,1015.1,"I would agree that if the test that was adopted would simply require a canvass of the instructions to determine whether the Sandstrom error was harmless, as the Respondent has suggested in his brief, you would have the equivalent of an automatic reversal rule given what the Connecticut Supreme Court did in this case."
1982.81-927,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1028.098,1055.695,"Well, would that extend to a situation where the instruction on intent is clearly wrong under Sandstrom, and there is no redeeming instruction whatever, so that if you are simply canvassing the instructions, you have to reach the conclusion that the jury was improperly instructed in violation of Sandstrom, but the testimony at the trial is that the defendant took the stand on the question of intent, perhaps was asked the question, did you intend to do this, and the defendant said, sure."
1982.81-927,0,34730,linda_k_lager,,1071.219,1073.75,"--Yes, I would agree with Your Honor's statement."
1982.81-927,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1073.75,1094.208,"Could I put it another way, that the only way to be successful is that the appellant has to first show, has the burden of showing that there is a violation of Sandstrom, and secondly, he must show that there is not harmless error."
1982.81-927,0,34730,linda_k_lager,,1094.208,1095.193,"No, Your Honor."
1982.81-927,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1157.122,1164.492,"You mean, you assume that you put yourself in the position of a juror who is told about this conclusive presumption."
1982.81-927,0,34730,linda_k_lager,,1168.727,1172.085,--That's not precisely the analysis that--
1982.81-927,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1172.085,1173.083,"It's close, though, isn't it?"
1982.81-927,0,34730,linda_k_lager,,1173.083,1174.693,"--Not exactly, Your Honor, because--"
1982.81-927,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1174.693,1176.642,"Well, how do you get at the word ""conclusive""?"
1982.81-927,0,34730,linda_k_lager,,1176.642,1177.628,--What an appellate court--
1982.81-927,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1177.628,1181.953,"What do you think ""conclusive"" means to the average person?"
1982.81-927,0,34730,linda_k_lager,,1181.953,1188.89,"--I think that the word ""conclusive"" had to be viewed particularly in this case in context."
1982.81-927,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1194.857,1196.511,My question was very simple.
1982.81-927,0,34730,linda_k_lager,,1204.79,1207.679,"--To reach a conclusion, Your Honor."
1982.81-927,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1207.679,1209.741,Reasonable what?
1982.81-927,0,34730,linda_k_lager,,1209.741,1212.693,To reach a conclusion.
1982.81-927,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1212.693,1223.343,"Well, how can you reach a conclusion as to a presumption that is... oh, yes, you reach a position he is guilty."
1982.81-927,0,34730,linda_k_lager,,1223.343,1226.825,"Well, that is not exactly what the jury in this case was told."
1982.81-927,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1305.092,1308.2,"Well, after all of that, why did you need the presumption instruction?"
1982.81-927,0,34730,linda_k_lager,,1308.2,1326.13,"Well, at the time that that instruction was given, and I don't believe that any court since the Sandstrom decision would give that instruction, it had been a recognized statement of what I would like to describe as the standardized inference of intent, proving intent from an accused conduct."
1982.81-927,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1400.911,1402.677,I think that you and I are in the same position.
1982.81-927,0,34730,linda_k_lager,,1405.126,1406.861,"--Well, I think that--"
1982.81-927,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1406.861,1407.532,Or am I wrong?
1982.81-927,0,34730,linda_k_lager,,1407.532,1409.22,--I think that in fact an appellate court--
1982.81-927,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1409.22,1410.14,Am I wrong?
1982.81-927,0,34730,linda_k_lager,,1410.14,1412.468,--I think that--
1982.81-927,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1412.468,1414.328,I know I've never been on a jury.
1982.81-927,0,34730,linda_k_lager,,1414.328,1416.013,"--Well, I've never been on a jury either, Your Honor."
1982.81-927,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1416.013,1417.093,I've never been in a jury room.
1982.81-927,0,34730,linda_k_lager,,1417.093,1429.915,But I think that appellate courts accepting and in fact sanctioning a standardized inference of intent understand what jurors do when they attempt to find intent.
1982.81-927,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1516.801,1525.328,"Incidentally, the Respondent is now incarcerated on what conviction?"
1982.81-927,0,34730,linda_k_lager,,1525.328,1532.059,The Respondent is incarcerated on the kidnapping and sexual assault convictions.
1982.81-927,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1532.059,1533.559,And what are his sentences?
1982.81-927,0,34730,linda_k_lager,,1533.559,1540.508,He is serving now as a result of the reversal an 18 to 36 year sentence.
1982.81-927,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1540.508,1548.756,And if the consequence of the Supreme Court of Connecticut's decision is what?
1982.81-927,0,34730,linda_k_lager,,1548.756,1567.373,"The consequence of the Supreme Court of Connecticut's decision is that the state is now obliged to conduct a second trial of the attempted murder and the robbery convictions, bring this victim back in after seven years of the incident to repeat the details of the story, establish the same case."
1982.81-927,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1567.373,1569.421,"Well, what sentences did he get on those two?"
1982.81-927,0,34730,linda_k_lager,,1569.421,1580.978,"He got a... the consequence of the reversal was that the minimum sentence was reduced by ten years, and the maximum sentence was reduced by 20 years."
1982.81-927,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1580.978,1583.165,So he had--
1982.81-927,0,34730,linda_k_lager,,1583.165,1587.178,He got a 28 to 56 year sentence originally.
1982.81-927,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1587.178,1588.005,"--Twenty-eight to 56, and he is now serving a--"
1982.81-927,0,34730,linda_k_lager,,1588.005,1590.301,An 18 to 36 year sentence.
1982.81-927,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1590.301,1590.879,--18 to 36.
1982.81-927,0,34730,linda_k_lager,,1594.084,1596.143,Why must the state reprosecute?
1982.81-927,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1596.143,1598.019,That is what you just said.
1982.81-927,0,34730,linda_k_lager,,1598.019,1608.731,The state's position in a case such as this one is that the gravity of the offense is so serious that it would be necessary to reprosecute the defendant.
1982.81-927,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1608.731,1613.729,"Well, that's a matter of discretion on the state's part."
1982.81-927,0,34730,linda_k_lager,,1613.729,1615.434,It is a matter of prosecutorial discretion.
1982.81-927,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1615.434,1616.198,So it doesn't have to.
1982.81-927,0,34730,linda_k_lager,,1616.198,1625.944,"It does not have to, but as the case stands now, it is in a posture of having a retrial on the two counts that were ordered to be retried."
1982.81-927,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1627.039,1628.131,Let me have those figures again.
1982.81-927,0,34730,linda_k_lager,,1631.566,1635.205,--Twenty-eight to 56 under the original sentence.
1982.81-927,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1635.205,1636.41,"Well, it is down to 18 to 36, you said."
1982.81-927,0,34730,linda_k_lager,,1636.41,1637.486,That is correct.
1982.81-927,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1637.486,1640.999,"Now, on the assault charge, what was the sentence on that?"
1982.81-927,0,34730,linda_k_lager,,1642.782,1644.938,If I may have a moment.
1982.81-927,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1654.23,1658.664,"--Well, if it takes time, don't use the time now."
1982.81-927,0,34730,linda_k_lager,,1660.399,1666.693,If you look at Pages 51A and 52A of the appendix--
1982.81-927,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1666.693,1667.567,Thank you.
1982.81-927,0,34730,linda_k_lager,,1667.567,1668.132,--that would give the sentence.
1982.81-927,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1670.975,1675.299,Mr. Barnett?
1982.81-927,1,29350,jerrold_h_barnett,,1675.299,1723.076,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this case... this case involves the question of whether an admittedly unconstitutional instruction that posited the element of intent as a question of law, contrary to decisions of this Court, and which remained uncured in a viewing of the charge as a whole, can ever be considered harmless error by virtue of the strength of the state's evidence."
1982.81-927,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1792.378,1794.8,Was that the one at Page 23A?
1982.81-927,1,29350,jerrold_h_barnett,,1794.8,1797.639,"That's the one that appears on Page 23A, Justice Brennan."
1982.81-927,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1797.639,1799.187,"With the word ""conclusive""."
1982.81-927,1,29350,jerrold_h_barnett,,1799.187,1834.47,"The word ""conclusive"", where the jury was instructed on a rule of law that every person is conclusively presumed to intend the natural and necessary consequences of his act, and of course in Sandstrom versus Montana, this Court noted that ""presume"" had a common meaning of acceptance of a proposition as true without proof, and ""conclusively"", of course, has common meanings of irrefutable, final, and decisive."
1982.81-927,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1834.47,1839.184,I am not sure I understood the state's position just as you have stated it.
1982.81-927,1,29350,jerrold_h_barnett,,1855.305,1860.178,"I do not understand the state's position to be such, Your Honor."
1982.81-927,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1918.886,1949.138,"Mr. Barnett, supposing that an appellate court reviewing a claim of Sandstrom error in the charge to the jury saw there was one sentence in a very long set of instructions that might be interpreted as suggesting a conclusive presumption, but came across seven or eight restatements of the proposition, as you often get in a series of complicated instructions, which simply used the... clearly spoke in terms of an inference that was permissible under the Sandstrom decision."
1982.81-927,1,29350,jerrold_h_barnett,,1965.68,1988.808,"My position, if Your Honor please, is that it would be proper for an appellate court to rule on the possibility of misunderstanding solely from the language of the charge, that if there was language which imported a conclusive presumption that the error could only be corrected in the charge."
1982.81-927,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1988.808,2005.054,"Well, but supposing the appellate court concludes that it was corrected in the charge, that there is something that taken all by itself might be Sandstrom error, but other parts of the charge really cured it, so that the impact on the jury was de minimis."
1982.81-927,1,29350,jerrold_h_barnett,,2015.597,2028.06,I think that the appellate court would have to rule or would rule in my opinion that there was no violation of Sandstrom because the charge has to be considered as a whole.
1982.81-927,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2028.06,2039.213,"Mr. Barnett, I gather, or do I, that you think that an examination of the evidence is irrelevant to the determination of the issue we have to decide?"
1982.81-927,1,29350,jerrold_h_barnett,,2039.213,2064.887,"I so think, Your Honor, and I base that on what I am going to posit to the Court is a concept of what is a jury's verdict, and I refer to language used by Justice Rutledge in Kotteokos versus the United States, where he said that a verdict is more than a judgment on the facts."
1982.81-927,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2085.457,2094.392,"Now, do you suggest that we have never treated for harmless error purposes instructional error?"
1982.81-927,1,29350,jerrold_h_barnett,,2094.392,2098.579,"No, I do not make that suggestion."
1982.81-927,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2207.485,2213.513,"Well, Mr. Barnett, isn't your position basically an attack on the whole notion of harmless error?"
1982.81-927,1,29350,jerrold_h_barnett,,2256.31,2273.164,"That is true, Justice Rehnquist, and I stated that the Court has treated instances of instructional error differently from instances of evidentiary error, such as existed in Harrington."
1982.81-927,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2273.164,2277.442,What cases are you relying on for treatment of instances of instructional error?
1982.81-927,1,29350,jerrold_h_barnett,,2277.442,2287.658,"I am relying on Wyler versus the United States, the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners versus the United States, Bollenbach versus the United States."
1982.81-927,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2287.658,2290.563,"All of those were trials in federal court, weren't they?"
1982.81-927,1,29350,jerrold_h_barnett,,2290.563,2291.577,"Yes, they were."
1982.81-927,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2291.577,2298.901,And wasn't the court in those cases interpreting a statute of Congress providing that technical errors shouldn't be used as ground for reversal?
1982.81-927,1,29350,jerrold_h_barnett,,2298.901,2321.347,"That is correct, but I believe that this Court in Chapman versus California mentioned that the rule adopted in that case, very much like the federal harmless error statute that preceded it, was not designed to relate to substantial rights, so I think those cases do become very relevant."
1982.81-927,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2321.347,2324.563,"But there is no reason why one should govern the other, is there?"
1982.81-927,1,29350,jerrold_h_barnett,,2324.563,2339.338,"Well, I think that the idea of directed verdicts and their functional equivalents have been discussed by this Court lately."
1982.81-927,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2435.894,2441.034,And that it is irreparable other than by better instructions?
1982.81-927,1,29350,jerrold_h_barnett,,2441.034,2444.22,It cannot be cured except by other language in the charge.
1982.81-927,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2444.22,2461.698,"Well, now, in this case, Mr. Barnett, I appreciate that argument as to the attempted murder, where twice ""conclusive"" was used, but how do you carry this as instructional error into the other convictions--"
1982.81-927,1,29350,jerrold_h_barnett,,2461.698,2462.353,Into the robbery--
1982.81-927,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2462.353,2462.649,--Yes.
1982.81-927,1,29350,jerrold_h_barnett,,2462.649,2465.086,--conviction.
1982.81-927,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2508.144,2509.505,Even on parole?
1982.81-927,1,29350,jerrold_h_barnett,,2509.505,2511.783,Even on parole.
1982.81-927,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2513.658,2516.033,"Well, you say it won't make much difference."
1982.81-927,1,29350,jerrold_h_barnett,,2517.687,2524.983,"That, on parole, I cannot tell you, Your Honor, whether it will definitely make any difference or not."
1982.81-927,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2534.072,2542.18,Would it make a difference if he were ever paroled and convicted of a new crime for recidivism purposes?
1982.81-927,1,29350,jerrold_h_barnett,,2542.18,2547.019,It would increase his past record.
1982.81-927,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2550.786,2555.609,Is there another one?
1982.81-927,1,29350,jerrold_h_barnett,,2556.923,2558.577,It's the robbery.
1982.81-927,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2683.163,2703.982,Do you think it is always improper for an appellate court to say what the jury might have done under other circumstances?
1982.81-927,1,29350,jerrold_h_barnett,,2703.982,2710.65,"Well, Justice White, I think that much of it depends upon the instruction."
1982.81-927,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2741.623,2744.607,What about an evidentiary error?
1982.81-927,1,29350,jerrold_h_barnett,,2744.607,2745.589,--In an evidentiary--
1982.81-927,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2745.589,2751.728,"--in which the jury is told, you consider all the evidence; and the jury considers all the evidence."
1982.81-927,1,29350,jerrold_h_barnett,,2762.085,2762.584,--Yes.
1982.81-927,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2773.861,2784.589,"Well, not unless the appellate court is coming to a conclusion as to what the jury would have done absent the evidence or with the evidence."
1982.81-927,1,29350,jerrold_h_barnett,,2784.589,2785.51,"--Oh, absent the evidence?"
1982.81-927,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2785.51,2786.59,Yes.
1982.81-927,1,29350,jerrold_h_barnett,,2788.949,2800.611,"It is, but it can perform it because it can say with some certitude that this tainted item of evidence had no impact on the jury."
1982.81-927,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2800.611,2810.625,"Well, what about the certitude based on the evidence that the jury couldn't possibly have found anything but that the defendant intended the act?"
1982.81-927,1,29350,jerrold_h_barnett,,2810.625,2819.482,"First, the appellate court must assume that the jury followed the instruction."
1982.81-927,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2821.653,2825.822,"Well, you have just told us we should assume the jury's followed instructions."
1982.81-927,1,29350,jerrold_h_barnett,,2825.822,2826.493,--Yes.
1982.81-927,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2862.431,2878.13,"But if the jury, you say the appellate court is foreclosed from saying, if the jury had been properly instructed, it would have found him guilty anyway because it couldn't have done anything but found that he intended what he did."
1982.81-927,1,29350,jerrold_h_barnett,,2878.13,2880.395,"No, Your Honor."
1982.81-927,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2880.395,2881.346,The Court can't do that?
1982.81-927,1,29350,jerrold_h_barnett,,2881.346,2904.714,"No, Your Honor, I am saying that if the jury used an improper decisional process fostered by the instruction which it must be presumed that they followed, then that is an error that affected the verdict."
1982.81-927,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2907.587,2909.666,"Well, it affected the verdict."
1982.81-927,1,29350,jerrold_h_barnett,,2909.666,2921.656,And the test is not whether the same result would have been achieved had the error not have occurred.
1982.81-927,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2923.142,2927.263,What about the hypothesis that I posed to your opponent?
1982.81-927,1,29350,jerrold_h_barnett,,2974.651,2981.9,"I must answer the question this way, Justice Rehnquist--"
1982.81-927,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2981.9,2983.932,You cannot answer it yes or no?
1982.81-927,1,29350,jerrold_h_barnett,,2983.932,2988.038,"--Yes, I can answer it yes or no."
1982.81-927,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2988.038,2989.742,But you are going to take some time doing it.
1982.81-927,1,29350,jerrold_h_barnett,,2990.1,2991.66,But may I explain my answer a little.
1982.81-927,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3054.543,3065.054,"But on this kind of an instruction, is it your position that no amount of evidence, no matter how overwhelming, could permit a reviewing court to say that it was harmless error?"
1982.81-927,1,29350,jerrold_h_barnett,,3065.054,3082.764,"That is my position, Mr. Chief Justice, that if the instruction posited as conclusive, and I draw that to the analogy to the directed verdict, that no court has the power to direct a verdict in a criminal case no matter how conclusive the evidence may be."
1982.81-927,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3082.764,3098.822,Even if a reviewing court would say that no rational mind could have been misled by the ambiguity in the instruction in the light of the overwhelming evidence?
1982.81-927,1,29350,jerrold_h_barnett,,3100.757,3102.539,I maintain that position.
1982.81-927,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3102.539,3105.179,"It doesn't leave much left to the harmless error rule, does it?"
1982.81-927,1,29350,jerrold_h_barnett,,3105.179,3112.034,"Well, it depends, if Your Honor please, I submit, on what type of error has been committed."
1982.81-927,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3138.071,3143.85,"May I ask, Mr. Barnett, do you concede that the instruction in this case was ambiguous?"
1982.81-927,1,29350,jerrold_h_barnett,,3143.85,3145.753,"No, I most certainly do not."
1982.81-927,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3149.785,3155.299,"Mr. Barnett, may I just ask you what your understanding of the holding of the Connecticut Supreme Court was?"
1982.81-927,1,29350,jerrold_h_barnett,,3162.872,3172.652,"Justice Stevens, perhaps I should start with answering something that you asked of Ms. Lager."
1982.81-927,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3267.847,3270.44,"Well, I am still not sure I understand."
1982.81-927,1,29350,jerrold_h_barnett,,3283.324,3298.755,"No, if Your Honor please, it means that they have taken the position that failure to object to the instruction at trial will not bar you from appellate review in the sense of Wainwright v. Sykes."
1982.81-927,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3298.755,3300.084,"Well, all right."
1982.81-927,1,29350,jerrold_h_barnett,,3317.858,3323.104,I don't believe that the Connecticut Supreme Court has passed on that question.
1982.81-927,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3328.994,3337.239,And what do you understand them to have done in this case as a reason for rejecting the prosecutor's argument that this error was harmless?
1982.81-927,1,29350,jerrold_h_barnett,,3337.96,3354.17,"They rejected it because the error, the instructional error, was uncured by the remainder of the charge and because of its conclusive, expressly stated conclusive nature, removed the element that could have been interpreted by a reasonable jury."
1982.81-927,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3354.17,3360.214,But that doesn't really meet the argument that the prosecutor makes that it could also be cured by the abundant evidence of guilt.
1982.81-927,1,29350,jerrold_h_barnett,,3360.214,3360.76,No.
1982.81-927,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3361.462,3363.915,"And then they don't really deal with that argument, do they?"
1982.81-927,1,29350,jerrold_h_barnett,,3363.915,3366.648,--The decision does not expressly address that.
1982.81-927,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3375.566,3385.468,"Mr. Barnett, as I understand your position, the Sandstrom function is a functional equivalent of a directed verdict."
1982.81-927,1,29350,jerrold_h_barnett,,3405.897,3409.412,"That certainly would have been error, Justice Powell."
1982.81-927,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3411.614,3412.519,Why?
1982.81-927,1,29350,jerrold_h_barnett,,3416.987,3417.72,Yes.
1982.81-927,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3417.72,3419.128,--of a directed verdict--
1982.81-927,1,29350,jerrold_h_barnett,,3419.128,3419.674,Yes.
1982.81-927,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3419.674,3421.078,--on the issue of intent.
1982.81-927,1,29350,jerrold_h_barnett,,3424.373,3426.092,"Yes, it is."
1982.81-927,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3426.092,3428.655,What's the difference in this instance?
1982.81-927,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3428.655,3432.839,May a Judge?
1982.81-927,1,29350,jerrold_h_barnett,,3432.839,3435.759,If the Judge had said--
1982.81-927,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3435.759,3438.318,--Can you have a directed verdict in Connecticut in a criminal case?
1982.81-927,1,29350,jerrold_h_barnett,,3438.318,3439.849,"No, you most certainly cannot."
1982.81-927,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3439.849,3440.255,Never?
1982.81-927,1,29350,jerrold_h_barnett,,3440.255,3441.581,Never.
1982.81-927,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3450.625,3454.001,Can the Judge just dismiss that count?
1982.81-927,1,29350,jerrold_h_barnett,,3454.001,3464.51,"Well, the question, Your Honor, is why would the Judge dismiss the count?"
1982.81-927,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3476.412,3478.115,"But it still had to find the other elements, didn't it?"
1982.81-927,1,29350,jerrold_h_barnett,,3478.115,3489.268,"The jury still, as a factual situation, would... that is the only, the only, element in which the conclusive presumption was used."
1982.81-927,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3492.423,3498.498,You haven't said very much about the failure to object here.
1982.81-927,1,29350,jerrold_h_barnett,,3498.498,3508.243,"No, I haven't, Mr. Chief Justice, because the Connecticut Supreme Court accepted the claim."
1982.81-927,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3535.326,3544.618,"The whole purpose of objections is to give the trial in the courts an opportunity to correct an asserted error, is it not?"
1982.81-927,1,29350,jerrold_h_barnett,,3544.618,3546.056,"Yes, it is, sir."
1982.81-927,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3557.147,3563.877,"Well, as I understand it, Connecticut Supreme Court practice, or at least that's what happened here, was that notwithstanding the failure to object--"
1982.81-927,1,29350,jerrold_h_barnett,,3563.877,3564.798,--That is correct.
1982.81-927,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3564.798,3565.812,--they were willing to entertain the--
1982.81-927,1,29350,jerrold_h_barnett,,3565.812,3567.672,"Yes, yes, Justice Brennan."
1982.81-927,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3567.672,3568.799,--And did.
1982.81-927,1,29350,jerrold_h_barnett,,3568.799,3569.938,It did.
1982.81-927,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3574.449,3576.606,"Ms. Lager, do you have anything further?"
1982.81-927,2,34730,linda_k_lager,,3576.606,3604.424,"With respect to the claim of the concurrent sentence doctrine that was raised by Mr. Barnett, the sentences, in response to your question earlier, Mr. Chief Justice, were 10 to 20 years on the attempted murder count, 8 to 16 years on the kidnapping count, 10 to 20 years on sexual assault, and 5 to 10 years on the robbery, which was concurrent with the kidnapping offense."
1982.81-927,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3619.589,3621.508,"Now, you say obliged again."
1982.81-927,2,34730,linda_k_lager,,3621.508,3625.275,Or can exercise its prosecutorial discretion.
1982.81-927,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3627.786,3632.52,"But if it does not, the respondent has 15 to 36, is that right?"
1982.81-927,2,34730,linda_k_lager,,3632.52,3634.474,"--If it does not, the respondent has 18 to 36."
1982.81-927,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3683.437,3684.685,"Thank you, Counsel."
