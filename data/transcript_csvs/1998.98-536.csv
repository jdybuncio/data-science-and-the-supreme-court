1998.98-536,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.879,"We'll hear argument now in No. 98-536, Tommy Olmstead v. L.C., by Jonathan Zimring."
1998.98-536,0,17576,beverly_p_downing,,12.309,15.421,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1998.98-536,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,123.745,144.027,"Ms. Downing, just to clarify the dimensions of this case, do I understand correctly that you are saying these two women are appropriately placed as far as medical needs are concerned in a community based facility?"
1998.98-536,0,17576,beverly_p_downing,,157.838,170.366,"Your Honor, at the point that the patients were placed, they did... they were appropriate for placement in the community and they did have to wait a short time in order to make their way up the waiting list."
1998.98-536,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,182.632,187.467,"Your position is... is as I... if I understand it correctly, is... is much further than that."
1998.98-536,0,17576,beverly_p_downing,,217.277,225.141,"Your Honor, it's our understanding that... that it's actually the Government's position that the State would not be required to have community placements."
1998.98-536,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,227.872,228.904,I'm not saying whether there are.
1998.98-536,0,17576,beverly_p_downing,,232.707,238.959,We think that if Georgia is required to... to expand their community placements by this statute--
1998.98-536,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,238.959,239.801,That's not the question I asked.
1998.98-536,0,17576,beverly_p_downing,,241.501,244.633,--We don't think... no.
1998.98-536,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,247.754,248.025,I didn't think you said that.
1998.98-536,0,17576,beverly_p_downing,,248.596,249.096,That's correct.
1998.98-536,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,249.096,277.245,"Now, could... as I understand it, the act provides that the Attorney General will promulgate regulations, and it goes on to say that those regulations will be consistent with the Disabilities Act and with regulations promulgated under section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act."
1998.98-536,0,17576,beverly_p_downing,,277.916,278.466,That's correct.
1998.98-536,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,278.466,308.016,"And there was a regulation adopted under section 504 saying that no otherwise qualified handicapped individual would be excluded from participation and/or denied the benefits of or subjected to discrimination, and that services had to be provided in the most integrated setting appropriate to the needs."
1998.98-536,0,17576,beverly_p_downing,,310.808,311.689,That's correct.
1998.98-536,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,312.049,317.275,And the same regulation was then adopted by the Attorney General under the Disabilities Act.
1998.98-536,0,17576,beverly_p_downing,,317.275,318.955,--That... that's correct.
1998.98-536,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,318.955,322.788,Is there any definition of integrated setting?
1998.98-536,0,17576,beverly_p_downing,,324.33,338.147,"Well, what we know is that the original integration regulation was promulgated by HEW in 1977, and that the rule... the notice at that point described it as providing access to treatment."
1998.98-536,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,365.326,379.495,"Well, this... do you challenge the regulation that was adopted by the Attorney General, or do you challenge the interpretation of that regulation?"
1998.98-536,0,17576,beverly_p_downing,,385.519,393.155,We don't say that the Attorney General lacked authority to promulgate it in the way that it was interpreted at the time.
1998.98-536,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,402.772,416.079,"Well, so what this case actually turns on, when you sort all other things around it, is the meaning of the regulation saying it must be in the most integrated setting appropriate."
1998.98-536,0,17576,beverly_p_downing,,416.89,418.23,Yes.
1998.98-536,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,418.23,419.372,Is that what it boils down to?
1998.98-536,0,17576,beverly_p_downing,,419.372,430.138,"That's what it boils down to, Your Honor, and that the new interpretation of the regulation actually would be precluded by the language of the statute, which requires discrimination by reason of disability."
1998.98-536,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,442.738,444.558,May... may I ask you about that?
1998.98-536,0,17576,beverly_p_downing,,528.314,531.785,"We would say no, that the--"
1998.98-536,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,531.785,531.996,Why not?
1998.98-536,0,17576,beverly_p_downing,,531.996,545.544,"--the second group which you posited needs a certain level of treatment, that this level of treatment can be provided appropriately in the hospital and that the person can benefit from that treatment provided in the hospital."
1998.98-536,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,545.544,565.279,"So, you're saying that if hospitalization would provide some appropriate treatment, that in effect renders irrelevant the fact that an individual can live outside the institution and presumably get the treatment on a... on a day care basis or something of that sort."
1998.98-536,0,17576,beverly_p_downing,,566.088,569.13,We wouldn't say that it renders irrelevant.
1998.98-536,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,588.794,602.973,"Well, do you accept the position, just as a matter of statutory interpretation, that... I'll assume for... for my question that your... your answer gives one version of... of what might be regarded as discrimination."
1998.98-536,0,17576,beverly_p_downing,,638.567,640.216,"Well, I believe that--"
1998.98-536,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,640.216,640.967,Or unreasonable?
1998.98-536,0,17576,beverly_p_downing,,640.967,643.539,"--Respectfully I believe that it is, that--"
1998.98-536,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,643.539,644.871,Why is it unreasonable?
1998.98-536,0,17576,beverly_p_downing,,644.871,650.615,--It presumes that the person's disability is irrelevant to their hospitalization.
1998.98-536,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,650.615,651.096,"Well, that's right."
1998.98-536,0,17576,beverly_p_downing,,654.578,663.502,Respectfully we would say that... that the person's disability is... is directly relevant to their hospital treatment and the--
1998.98-536,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,663.502,665.284,"Well, in other words, you're changing my question."
1998.98-536,0,17576,beverly_p_downing,,701.987,722.322,"--In... in an involuntary setting, that would be a reasonable reading of the statute, where there's involuntary treatment being provided or where the person is being confined against their will involuntarily and there were no medical reason for it and the person were not dangerous to themselves or others, yes, that would certainly violate the ADA."
1998.98-536,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,722.322,722.54,But--
1998.98-536,0,17576,beverly_p_downing,,726.023,726.393,That's right.
1998.98-536,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,726.393,735.459,But the... the voluntary character of the hospitalization then is what... what takes us out of... of the situation that you and I have just been describing?
1998.98-536,0,17576,beverly_p_downing,,735.459,739.823,"Well, it's the voluntary... the voluntariness of it is certainly a very key part of it."
1998.98-536,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,739.823,758.405,"But is... is that... does the... does the voluntariness, in effect, negate the possibility of discrimination on the argument that, look, if they're doing this voluntarily, you can't say that the Government is discriminating against them because they themselves are responsible for the... for the treatment that they're receiving."
1998.98-536,0,17576,beverly_p_downing,,760.396,763.238,That... that's one... one aspect of the argument.
1998.98-536,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,777.048,783.591,"Well, but their point was that if they left the hospital, then they... under your scheme, they couldn't get any treatment at all."
1998.98-536,0,17576,beverly_p_downing,,783.591,783.881,No.
1998.98-536,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,783.881,784.402,Wasn't that their--
1998.98-536,0,17576,beverly_p_downing,,784.402,784.843,No.
1998.98-536,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,784.843,785.393,--Wasn't that their point?
1998.98-536,0,17576,beverly_p_downing,,785.393,786.163,No.
1998.98-536,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,792.528,793.089,No.
1998.98-536,0,17576,beverly_p_downing,,796.781,802.063,It's also... that's also untrue under the facts of this case.
1998.98-536,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,802.925,809.918,"What we're trying to do is to test what your legal theory is, and it's still not quite clear to me."
1998.98-536,0,17576,beverly_p_downing,,844.362,844.68,--No.
1998.98-536,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,861.163,862.853,I thought that's what the respondents were saying.
1998.98-536,0,17576,beverly_p_downing,,862.853,863.033,--No.
1998.98-536,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,863.033,863.964,"And if you say, well--"
1998.98-536,0,17576,beverly_p_downing,,863.964,864.215,No.
1998.98-536,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,864.215,874.523,"--there are... there are reasons why they should be in the hospital because it's involuntary medication sometimes in some context, then that's quite different."
1998.98-536,0,17576,beverly_p_downing,,895.714,920.801,"The State's position is that if a person were excluded from hospital treatment or community treatment by reason of a disability, for example, if the person had AIDS and were prohibited from going into the hospital or if were prohibited going into community treatment because of that disability, that would violate the ADA, and that would violate it under the terms of the statute which require that a person not be excluded by reason of disability."
1998.98-536,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,920.801,931.388,I guess the person who's not admitted to the hospital because the State determines that the condition is not serious enough to be treated in the hospital is not being discriminated against because of his disability.
1998.98-536,0,17576,beverly_p_downing,,934.86,945.137,"Well, Your Honor, I believe that whenever you get into decisions about treatment of the disabled, every... every decision is going to be made by reason of the person's disability."
1998.98-536,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,952.942,965.17,"No, but he's not... he's being excluded from... from institutional treatment in the hypothetical I gave you not because of the disability he has, but because he does not have an additional disability."
1998.98-536,0,17576,beverly_p_downing,,966.47,972.284,The... the person must be qualified to receive the services.
1998.98-536,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,974.846,976.969,Does the State have to treat all disabilities?
1998.98-536,0,17576,beverly_p_downing,,976.969,978.548,"--No, the State does not."
1998.98-536,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,981.881,989.976,"Now, does it therefore discriminate against people on the basis of their disability if it offers no treatment for... I don't know... dyslexia?"
1998.98-536,0,17576,beverly_p_downing,,989.976,991.027,No.
1998.98-536,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,994.48,1005.246,"If it says half the people who have dyslexia have to sit at a special table, I guess that would be discrimination, wouldn't it?"
1998.98-536,0,17576,beverly_p_downing,,1019.615,1022.738,"That would... that would discriminate, yes."
1998.98-536,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1022.738,1023.018,All right.
1998.98-536,0,17576,beverly_p_downing,,1039.44,1040.439,Certainly.
1998.98-536,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1040.439,1040.73,All right.
1998.98-536,0,17576,beverly_p_downing,,1065.997,1067.227,Well--
1998.98-536,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1067.227,1069.818,It's... there's no medical reason for putting them there.
1998.98-536,0,17576,beverly_p_downing,,1112.387,1120.795,"--Your Honor, in response to an earlier point that you made in your... in what... in your hypothetical, again you referred to locked, that they're locked in the room."
1998.98-536,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1121.633,1122.565,I'll assume they're not.
1998.98-536,0,17576,beverly_p_downing,,1122.565,1123.346,--That they're not locked.
1998.98-536,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1123.346,1128.179,"Let's just call... just call it a special room, and by that we'll mean an institutionalized room."
1998.98-536,0,17576,beverly_p_downing,,1128.179,1143.798,"I believe where the State would disagree and the State's position is different than that is that it cannot be assumed that because one option is appropriate... and that's community care... that another option, which is hospital care is not appropriate."
1998.98-536,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1167.145,1169.686,"Ms. Downing, do you have a special room for broken legged people?"
1998.98-536,0,17576,beverly_p_downing,,1194.122,1195.522,That's... that's correct.
1998.98-536,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1195.522,1198.554,"And here you have plaintiffs who say, I don't want to come into this one room."
1998.98-536,0,17576,beverly_p_downing,,1233.138,1233.546,I--
1998.98-536,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1233.546,1234.508,"Now, tell us if the case is--"
1998.98-536,0,17576,beverly_p_downing,,1234.508,1235.87,--I would disagree with the last point.
1998.98-536,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1255.01,1256.122,"--Well, are you putting some extra barriers?"
1998.98-536,0,17576,beverly_p_downing,,1257.902,1258.223,No.
1998.98-536,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1266.918,1268.45,--What if there's no space?
1998.98-536,0,17576,beverly_p_downing,,1269.86,1270.391,"Yes, we do."
1998.98-536,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1270.391,1280.928,"But you... you assert you could eliminate the second room entirely if you wanted to, if... if you decide that the way the State wants to provide treatment is... is institutionally, you're... you're authorized to do that."
1998.98-536,0,17576,beverly_p_downing,,1280.928,1282.219,"Your Honor, that--"
1998.98-536,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1282.219,1282.79,I thought you said that.
1998.98-536,0,17576,beverly_p_downing,,1285.392,1304.274,"--Your Honor, Georgia... Georgia thinks it would be inconsistent to say that Georgia must provide as many beds in the community, once they have a program, as... as there's demand for, and yet at the same time to say that Georgia is not required to provide those beds in the first place."
1998.98-536,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1304.274,1307.635,"Which is your position, that you're not required to provide community service at all."
1998.98-536,0,17576,beverly_p_downing,,1307.635,1311.649,"Well, Georgia... not under the ADA."
1998.98-536,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1314.039,1317.232,May I ask you a question about the meaning of the word discrimination?
1998.98-536,0,17576,beverly_p_downing,,1333.284,1342.439,"Well, Georgia... Georgia believes that unjustified disparate treatment based on disability--"
1998.98-536,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1342.439,1351.014,"Do you think discrimination just means unjustified disparate treatment, or do you say every disparate treatment is discrimination?"
1998.98-536,0,17576,beverly_p_downing,,1352.584,1355.407,"--Well, we don't believe that every disparate treatment is discrimination."
1998.98-536,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1356.989,1367.114,"--Well, if it's unjustified disparate treatment that constitute discrimination and if there's no justification for keeping a person in the second room instead of the first, why doesn't the statute apply?"
1998.98-536,0,17576,beverly_p_downing,,1367.114,1372.207,"--Well, we believe that there is justification for... for treating the person in the hospital."
1998.98-536,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1379.712,1381.535,But then--
1998.98-536,0,17576,beverly_p_downing,,1385.416,1387.026,And... and financial reasons.
1998.98-536,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1388.568,1400.777,"--But... but... if... if you factor in the fact that it's medically reasonable and preferable to... which is what the implication of your suggestion is, to treat in a hospital, then this whole case goes away."
1998.98-536,0,17576,beverly_p_downing,,1415.787,1416.465,--Well--
1998.98-536,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1416.465,1429.004,"What we're trying to do is to find out what is the issue you're asking us to decide, and it seems the parties are... the briefs are not meeting the way you're... you're presenting the case."
1998.98-536,0,17576,beverly_p_downing,,1429.004,1447.357,"--It's Georgia's position that what the ADA is primarily focused on is evenhanded treatment between the handicapped and... and the non handicapped, that to... it does have some application in disability services, but it does not apply with equal force in the provision of disability services."
1998.98-536,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1465.639,1465.809,Yes.
1998.98-536,0,17576,beverly_p_downing,,1485.822,1489.095,That's... that's correct.
1998.98-536,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1490.056,1493.209,"Well, it's correct because that's the question you presented."
1998.98-536,0,17576,beverly_p_downing,,1493.376,1507.346,"It's Georgia's position that it is reasonable for the State to ask someone to wait until a community placement is available, that that does not constitute discrimination."
1998.98-536,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1514.72,1517.792,"Well, that issue is open on remand I assume."
1998.98-536,0,17576,beverly_p_downing,,1517.792,1519.214,--But we... we think that goes to--
1998.98-536,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1519.214,1522.785,Whether it's a fundamental alteration of the State's program.
1998.98-536,0,17576,beverly_p_downing,,1522.785,1527.26,--But we think that also goes to the issue of whether there's been discrimination in the first instance.
1998.98-536,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1527.26,1531.952,Can you make that wait longer for the mentally ill than for other disabilities?
1998.98-536,0,17576,beverly_p_downing,,1531.952,1532.653,No.
1998.98-536,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1540.426,1547.382,"Ms. Downing, I thought this case had gone back on remand to decide the financial, whatever it was, question--"
1998.98-536,0,17576,beverly_p_downing,,1547.382,1557.73,"--Well, what the Eleventh Circuit did, however, is limit the question on remand to a comparison between the cost of serving two persons in the community relative to the entire mental health budget of the State."
1998.98-536,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1572.33,1575.131,--You say the Eleventh Circuit sent back the wrong question.
1998.98-536,0,17576,beverly_p_downing,,1575.131,1575.962,--Absolutely.
1998.98-536,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1582.677,1587.43,"Why... I opened with this question and... and if I'm wrong about it, do tell me."
1998.98-536,0,17576,beverly_p_downing,,1603.331,1614.568,"--The... the act by its terms... the act by its terms... there's more than one argument, obviously, we have."
1998.98-536,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1632.029,1634.142,A total reversal of... of what?
1998.98-536,0,17576,beverly_p_downing,,1634.142,1640.483,--The Justice Department... I would like to point out that the Justice Department's position has... has reversed in this case.
1998.98-536,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1642.657,1643.696,Reversed from what?
1998.98-536,0,17576,beverly_p_downing,,1646.578,1647.429,--Yes.
1998.98-536,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1647.96,1655.954,And they say the unnecessary segregation of individuals with disabilities is a form of discrimination prohibited by the ADA and its implementing regulations.
1998.98-536,0,17576,beverly_p_downing,,1655.954,1660.058,"--Yes, and that's the first time, as conceded by the Attorney General, that they ever took that position."
1998.98-536,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1677.06,1677.67,Where is that from?
1998.98-536,0,17576,beverly_p_downing,,1677.67,1679.339,That is from the Bowen case.
1998.98-536,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1748.256,1751.047,There's no time left and no further questions.
1998.98-536,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1752.898,1758.801,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1998.98-536,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1817.081,1821.676,"How dependent is your argument, Mr. Gottesman, on what you describe as the legislative history?"
1998.98-536,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1821.676,1824.338,It's I think not dependent at all.
1998.98-536,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1840.777,1846.712,"This isn't... I mean, this doesn't... this isn't isolation or segregation."
1998.98-536,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1863.003,1870.637,"Well, Your Honor, the argument that this is voluntary, we provide the service, we happen to provide it in the locked ward of a mental institution--"
1998.98-536,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1870.637,1870.857,Right.
1998.98-536,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1870.857,1877.121,"--You don't have to take the service, but if you would like the service, the only place you can have it is here."
1998.98-536,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1877.121,1881.614,"Well, now, in this case we do not have a locked ward."
1998.98-536,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1881.614,1882.465,"Yes, we do, Your Honor."
1998.98-536,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1882.465,1894.903,"Well, according to counsel for the petitioner, these particular individuals were permitted to leave, or at least one of them, during the day and return at night."
1998.98-536,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1894.903,1898.805,"No, that's not accurate, Your Honor, and let me be clear about what the record shows."
1998.98-536,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1926.185,1931.418,"So, you disagree with the description given by counsel for the petitioner of the--"
1998.98-536,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1931.418,1931.969,"--Totally, Your Honor."
1998.98-536,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1931.969,1932.31,--conditions.
1998.98-536,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1932.31,1933.021,Totally.
1998.98-536,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1934.261,1938.324,"They were locked, but to say it's locked is not to say that it's involuntary."
1998.98-536,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1940.264,1940.614,--She could--
1998.98-536,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1940.614,1941.556,It took 72 hours.
1998.98-536,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1941.556,1941.736,--Yes.
1998.98-536,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1941.736,1945.068,She had to give them 72 hours' notice that I no longer want to be here--
1998.98-536,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1945.068,1945.807,That's right.
1998.98-536,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1945.807,1946.929,--whereupon she was free to leave.
1998.98-536,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1946.929,1950.582,She was free to leave and would not receive any of the services that she needed.
1998.98-536,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1950.582,1960.517,"And one... one of these... one of these... respondents was... was in... in a community location for some time, wasn't she?"
1998.98-536,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1960.517,1963.61,"Immediately before suit was filed, for a period of a few weeks."
1998.98-536,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1964.01,1964.972,Paid for by the State.
1998.98-536,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1964.972,1965.783,That's correct.
1998.98-536,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1965.783,1972.635,And... and it took... it took a full time person living with her to make that treatment effective.
1998.98-536,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1975.337,1981.951,"One of them was living in a place with several full time attendants for a very brief time, but then that was withdrawn."
1998.98-536,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1982.722,1983.854,"I mean, that's pretty expensive."
1998.98-536,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1984.212,1984.763,--No.
1998.98-536,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1985.514,1986.856,"--I guess that's community treatment, but it's pretty expensive."
1998.98-536,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1986.856,1990.977,"Well, it's cheaper, Your Honor, and I... I do want to spend a minute on why it's cheaper."
1998.98-536,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2049.206,2050.467,In a way that's what's bothering me--
1998.98-536,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2050.467,2050.858,--Pardon?
1998.98-536,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2050.858,2053.969,--is if I say what is... maybe you can say something to reassure me.
1998.98-536,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2074.353,2074.753,Yes.
1998.98-536,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2074.753,2089.453,"And so, what worries me about your position is writing something that, as it really works out in the world, leads a lot of the people who need to be in institutions to be out, abandoned in the streets."
1998.98-536,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2106.954,2107.214,Correct.
1998.98-536,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2107.214,2119.843,"And so, I'm suddenly worried in areas of uncertainty, like your clients here who have been in and out because they had threats to kill themselves or others from time to time, and then sometimes... that's the real world."
1998.98-536,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2136.623,2143.697,"Well, the first reassurance is that in this case the State's own professionals said that these people could appropriately be served in the community."
1998.98-536,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2143.697,2145.539,It's the rule of law that I fear--
1998.98-536,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2145.539,2158.138,"And the question is, to what extent would deference be owed to the State medical professionals in cases where, unlike this one, they said, we don't think this person can be appropriately served in the community?"
1998.98-536,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2158.138,2163.551,"--Can we go back one step to have this clear, this basic question clear?"
1998.98-536,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2189.197,2190.787,"We would say yes, Your Honor."
1998.98-536,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2229.094,2229.464,May I--
1998.98-536,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2246.556,2253.609,"Well, Your Honor, if one... one can definitionally negate entirely this provision."
1998.98-536,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2254.33,2255.421,I don't think that negates it entirely.
1998.98-536,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2257.422,2262.454,"--It is not, and the State has not argued that the service in this case is institutionalization."
1998.98-536,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2268.749,2269.67,Mr. Gottesman--
1998.98-536,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2269.67,2272.082,The question is where it's going to be provided and that's what--
1998.98-536,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2272.082,2291.456,"--May I ask, if you've finished your answer to Justice Breyer's question, because I'm also concerned about the possibility that if we adopt the rule in its strongest form that you advocate, that the States, in order to avoid the risk of liability, would have a motive and an incentive to push people out into the community that should not go in that direction."
1998.98-536,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2293.336,2294.408,"--Yes, I would like to, Your Honor."
1998.98-536,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2323.195,2328.168,Where do we get the deference to professionals out of the statute?
1998.98-536,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2328.168,2332.912,The statute does not say how the determination will be made.
1998.98-536,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2342.927,2346.96,But it won't be the patient against the State's professionals.
1998.98-536,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2356.297,2356.976,"Well, this Court--"
1998.98-536,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2356.976,2360.529,We certainly wouldn't do that if the issue were involuntary confinement.
1998.98-536,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2360.529,2361.24,--I hope not.
1998.98-536,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2361.24,2363.06,Somebody says... I hope not too.
1998.98-536,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2374.758,2377.82,"Well, Your Honor, on this issue I find it hard to be arguing."
1998.98-536,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2393.781,2396.803,"Yes, but we have to worry about other cases, not your case."
1998.98-536,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2396.803,2396.993,Well--
1998.98-536,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2396.993,2398.343,This isn't even a class action.
1998.98-536,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2398.343,2399.115,--That's correct.
1998.98-536,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2399.115,2403.197,"So, the question is a very pressing one, and you haven't answered it yet."
1998.98-536,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2403.197,2419.417,"Well, this Court has in other cases said, we will give very strong deference to the judgment of the... the institution's professionals, said that in a different context, not the ADA, in Youngberg v. Romeo."
1998.98-536,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2420.678,2431.885,"But what we don't know is, Mr. Gottesman... is how many other people the experts in the... in the institution have... Justice O'Connor just made the point it's not a class action."
1998.98-536,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2440.701,2441.002,--True.
1998.98-536,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2441.002,2442.522,--but they haven't come to court?
1998.98-536,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2448.486,2452.31,"We are not saying that, Your Honor."
1998.98-536,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2471.783,2494.568,"What if you get into a situation, Mr. Gottesman, where you have what you call the professionals, which I presume means M.D.'s and so forth in the hospital, but there's a hospital administrator who's perhaps a political appointee and he... he may disagree with the professionals or if he doesn't like what the professionals are doing, maybe he'll hire professionals who say what he wants them to say?"
1998.98-536,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2494.568,2509.337,"--Well, on the first score, Your Honor, this Court in both Youngberg and in an 8... 504 case Arline, which also talked about deference to the State's professionals, said it has to be professional judgment that we defer to, not administrative judgment."
1998.98-536,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2523.986,2535.534,"Of course not, but he would hire, as the Chief Justice suggests... you know, as sure as God made little apples, he will hire professionals who agree with him, people... professionals who like to keep everybody in institutions."
1998.98-536,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2535.534,2539.267,"Well, Your Honor, I'd like to think States do better than that, and I think they do."
1998.98-536,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2545.741,2551.094,"What it boils down to... let's assume... I mean, just I... I assume there's something in Justice Scalia's suggestion."
1998.98-536,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2576.711,2586.377,"--Well, this Court in Arline, which was a 504 case, said that we give very strong deference to the views of the State's professionals."
1998.98-536,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2586.377,2590.729,"So, your answer to Justice Breyer's question I think boils down to this."
1998.98-536,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2602.617,2602.827,Yes.
1998.98-536,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2602.827,2607.82,"Number two, there is no presumption in favor of release."
1998.98-536,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2619.741,2623.53,Unless... there's no presumption unless the State's own professionals say--
1998.98-536,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2623.53,2627.514,"Right, but that's not a... I'm... I'm talking about a presumption apart from the testimony of professionals."
1998.98-536,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2627.514,2627.694,--That's right.
1998.98-536,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2627.965,2634.74,"And... and number two, the burden... number three I guess, the burden is on the person seeking release--"
1998.98-536,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2634.74,2634.788,Correct.
1998.98-536,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2634.788,2637.529,--to demonstrate entitlement to release.
1998.98-536,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2646.137,2646.515,Well--
1998.98-536,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2646.515,2648.338,Are those the three components basically?
1998.98-536,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2648.338,2663.906,"--Well, certainly those three, that is to say, that even if all professionals' judgments are to be given equal deference by the court, the plaintiff, by virtue of having the burden of proof... I can appropriately be served in the community... would have to be more persuasive than the State."
1998.98-536,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2663.906,2667.068,"Well, Mr. Gottesman, what do we mean by the most integrated setting?"
1998.98-536,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2667.068,2676.816,"Well, the... in the... in adopting the regulations, the Attorney General gave us a definition of what that means, and it's printed on page 21 of our brief."
1998.98-536,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2687.294,2688.453,"Well, let me ask you this."
1998.98-536,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2717.601,2718.873,Probably not.
1998.98-536,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2731.223,2733.433,"It certainly would... would be the most integrated setting, though--"
1998.98-536,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2733.433,2734.415,"It would, indeed, but--"
1998.98-536,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2734.415,2735.484,--under your definition of it.
1998.98-536,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2735.484,2739.317,"--That's correct, but there is a limit in the statute on the--"
1998.98-536,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2739.317,2740.409,Isn't there also a limit in the reg?
1998.98-536,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2748.564,2764.344,"--Well, it could well because it is... before you get to whether it's a fundamental alteration, you have to ask is this a reasonable accommodation because b(7) of the reg says, a public entity shall make reasonable modifications in policies and practices to avoid--"
1998.98-536,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2764.344,2764.535,Suppose--
1998.98-536,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2764.535,2765.306,--discrimination.
1998.98-536,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2765.306,2770.919,--Suppose the State said we have 500 spaces in the... in the community based facility.
1998.98-536,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2786.689,2795.266,"Well, the State's obligation here is to... if it is going to provide these services, is to provide integrated settings."
1998.98-536,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2806.684,2808.324,"Well, they can help it, but it would cost money."
1998.98-536,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2825.505,2827.538,"Well, it doesn't have to get everybody out, Your Honor."
1998.98-536,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2850.712,2853.363,Do they have an opportunity to make that proof?
1998.98-536,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2853.363,2853.914,Of course.
1998.98-536,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2853.914,2869.125,"But, as I understood, Georgia to take the position that what was sent back to Judge Shoob was a much less... much narrower question than that."
1998.98-536,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2869.125,2880.382,"Well, they were allowed to demonstrate that it would be a burden, an undue burden, and therefore a fundamental alteration to serve these two people in the community, and they said, we concede that we cannot make that showing."
1998.98-536,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2880.382,2883.434,"But in any case, we don't have any question before us--"
1998.98-536,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2883.434,2883.815,That is correct.
1998.98-536,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2883.815,2891.027,"--about how, in effects, the balance should be struck on... on what is reasonably... what is reasonable financially."
1998.98-536,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2891.027,2891.668,That's correct.
1998.98-536,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2892.169,2916.156,"And the... the only question we've got, I guess, is whether there is a... kind of a... just a... a stone wall against your position erected by a... a view of discrimination that says that as long as you treat all handicapped persons, regardless of the handicapped... their handicap, in the same way, as a matter of law, there can't be discrimination under the statute."
1998.98-536,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2918.016,2918.447,--That's right.
1998.98-536,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2928.144,2929.954,"Thank you, Mr. Gottesman."
1998.98-536,2,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,2931.843,2945.855,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1998.98-536,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2971.681,2976.393,"Suppose you have people who are uncertain on that point, I mean, and they say, it's also appropriate at the hospital."
1998.98-536,2,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,3007.115,3017.78,The statutory obligation only is triggered when it is appropriate to treat the person in the community.
1998.98-536,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3017.78,3026.418,"Now, what do you do when people disagree, when psychiatrists are not certain when, as here, one says I think it's appropriate to treat her in the facility, not outside?"
1998.98-536,2,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,3026.418,3048.481,"In... in this Court's decision in Arline I believe, which was under section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, provides the nearest analogy, and there the Court said that courts should generally defer to reasonable judgments made by the State's treatment professionals."
1998.98-536,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3048.481,3058.148,"Mr. Gornstein, can I ask, what administration... what... what responsibilities for administering this act does the Attorney General have?"
1998.98-536,2,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,3058.148,3063.632,The Attorney General has authority or was compelled to issue regulations--
1998.98-536,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3063.632,3064.213,Anything else?
1998.98-536,2,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,3064.213,3064.563,--Yes.
1998.98-536,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3064.563,3065.882,Does he administer the act?
1998.98-536,2,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,3066.563,3072.046,He administers the act by following... filing lawsuits when there are violations of the act.
1998.98-536,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3072.046,3074.077,--That... that's not in administration of the act.
1998.98-536,2,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,3076.621,3077.49,Well--
1998.98-536,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3077.49,3080.04,And we don't give him deference as to the meaning of criminal laws.
1998.98-536,2,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,3080.04,3081.603,--You're raising the question of deference.
1998.98-536,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3081.603,3086.686,I'm raising the question of... do you know any other case in which we have given deference?
1998.98-536,2,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,3097.482,3113.493,"In... this Court's decision in Bragdon said that the Attorney General was entitled to deference in his interpretation of title III in the... of the ADA based on the very factors that are present here, that the Attorney General was directed to issue regulations to--"
1998.98-536,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3113.493,3119.268,Suppose Congress tells the Attorney General to issue regulations concerning the meaning of section 1983.
1998.98-536,2,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,3123.971,3128.663,"--Justice Scalia, I think you would not be bound by it, but I think you would be entitled--"
1998.98-536,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3128.663,3129.174,Can Congress--
1998.98-536,2,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,3129.174,3133.506,--you would be... you would be required to give it Chevron deference.
1998.98-536,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3133.837,3151.448,"--You see, I thought Chevron deference was... came about because when Congress passes a statute that requires administration by an executive agency, the executive is necessarily the first person to take a cut at giving meaning to it, and we give deference to that person's cut because it's part of his necessary function."
1998.98-536,2,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,3174.582,3181.648,"--Justice Scalia, I think Bragdon does settle that issue, but I also... it's also the case that Chevron itself--"
1998.98-536,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3181.648,3182.99,Right and what's the cite for Bragdon?
1998.98-536,2,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,3182.99,3185.933,--That is... that is in our brief.
1998.98-536,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3193.667,3199.109,"Well, it's pretty scary if we decided that way."
1998.98-536,2,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,3199.109,3200.522,--11... I just want to give you the--
1998.98-536,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3200.522,3201.46,It was the dentist case.
1998.98-536,2,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,3201.46,3203.383,--the jump cite if I can.
1998.98-536,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3203.383,3204.816,Tell me... tell me I didn't join that opinion.
1998.98-536,2,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,3205.326,3205.587,No.
1998.98-536,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3209.898,3211.731,--I feel much better.
1998.98-536,2,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,3212.051,3214.632,But... but it... just to--
