1985.84-1979,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,8.207,The Court will hear arguments first this morning in Meritor Savings Bank against Vinson.
1985.84-1979,0,24694,f_robert_troll_jr,,18.385,28.89,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1985.84-1979,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,205.788,209.049,"Counsel, Mr. Taylor is not here, is he?"
1985.84-1979,0,24694,f_robert_troll_jr,,209.049,210.921,He is not before this Court.
1985.84-1979,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,210.921,212.561,Have you represented him in the past?
1985.84-1979,0,24694,f_robert_troll_jr,,212.561,213.663,"No, we have not."
1985.84-1979,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,221.347,224.121,Is he any longer employed by the bank?
1985.84-1979,0,24694,f_robert_troll_jr,,224.121,234.966,"Although I don't think it's part of the record, it is my understanding that he is still employed with the bank and is still at the branch premises where the alleged incidents occurred."
1985.84-1979,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,424.529,442.671,"Mr. Troll, do you concede that the trial court simply didn't handle the case as one involving a recognition of a sexual harassment or hostile environment type claim?"
1985.84-1979,0,24694,f_robert_troll_jr,,442.671,456.542,"We would concede, Your Honor, that at the time this case was tried before Judge Penn, of course, that theory of law had not been applied to sexual harassment cases."
1985.84-1979,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,456.542,456.833,Okay.
1985.84-1979,0,24694,f_robert_troll_jr,,462.146,463.498,We agree that he did not.
1985.84-1979,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,464.706,473.772,"Now, do you agree today that that is a valid claim or could be a valid claim under Title VII?"
1985.84-1979,0,24694,f_robert_troll_jr,,473.772,484.799,"--As we've mentioned in our brief, if the employee has sustained some form of tangible job detriment we feel indeed it would be cognizable."
1985.84-1979,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,484.799,497.919,"Well, even without detriment other than the suffering that occurs in the hostile environment itself, do you agree that such a claim might exist?"
1985.84-1979,0,24694,f_robert_troll_jr,,504.634,506.634,"They do in fact suggest that, Your Honor."
1985.84-1979,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,537.173,550.623,Would you say that if it were a racial harmful environment claim that a tangible effect on employment is a necessary element of such a claim?
1985.84-1979,0,24694,f_robert_troll_jr,,550.623,556.958,"We would believe, Your Honor, that a reasoned argument could be made contrary to our position."
1985.84-1979,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,575.73,585.014,Do you think the principle should apply similarly in a sexual harassment claim as it would to a racial?
1985.84-1979,0,24694,f_robert_troll_jr,,585.014,586.786,"Yes, we do."
1985.84-1979,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,637.21,638.55,Let me interrupt you right there.
1985.84-1979,0,24694,f_robert_troll_jr,,645.415,658.134,"--Under the allegations in this case of a one to one sexual relationship, where the employee has remained in the environment for over a period of four years, we submit there is not, Your Honor."
1985.84-1979,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,658.134,662.966,"Because in effect the claim just has been waived, or what is the theory?"
1985.84-1979,0,24694,f_robert_troll_jr,,665.047,667.19,I'm not denying that there can be such a case.
1985.84-1979,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,675.214,678.549,"Does that mean even if there were psychological harm, it would be--"
1985.84-1979,0,24694,f_robert_troll_jr,,678.549,693.452,"--It would be our feeling that if there was psychological harm or emotional disturbance as a result of this conduct, that it would in fact constitute a state tort remedy and that would be where this employee would seek relief."
1985.84-1979,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,693.452,693.789,--I see.
1985.84-1979,0,24694,f_robert_troll_jr,,700.491,705.123,"In order to measure, in order to show what exactly occurs."
1985.84-1979,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,705.123,706.986,Wasn't the Respondent fired?
1985.84-1979,0,24694,f_robert_troll_jr,,706.986,708.797,"No, she was not, Your Honor."
1985.84-1979,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,708.797,713.839,How did she become unemployed?
1985.84-1979,0,24694,f_robert_troll_jr,,713.839,723.096,The facts of this record indicate that the Respondent here filed this lawsuit before she became unemployed.
1985.84-1979,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,745.331,751.155,Do you rely fully on the point that the bank was not notified?
1985.84-1979,0,24694,f_robert_troll_jr,,751.155,752.405,Absolutely.
1985.84-1979,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,752.405,753.867,Isn't that your point?
1985.84-1979,0,24694,f_robert_troll_jr,,753.867,756.569,The point is the bank was never notified.
1985.84-1979,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,756.569,764.235,"Now, where is the statute or anyplace else do you get the need to notify the bank?"
1985.84-1979,0,24694,f_robert_troll_jr,,764.235,772.05,"Well, Your Honor, in reading the statute, of course, as we've indicated in our brief, it requires intentional discrimination."
1985.84-1979,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,792.091,796.395,What type of protest do you want?
1985.84-1979,0,24694,f_robert_troll_jr,,796.395,797.406,"Pardon me, Your Honor?"
1985.84-1979,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,797.406,798.917,Do you need a written one or oral?
1985.84-1979,0,24694,f_robert_troll_jr,,798.917,799.397,"No, sir."
1985.84-1979,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,817.068,822.601,"Well, they did have notice after she filed the charges."
1985.84-1979,0,24694,f_robert_troll_jr,,822.601,824.792,We had notice once this lawsuit was filed.
1985.84-1979,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,824.792,835.581,"May I ask on that point, do I correctly read your brief to indicate that you would not make the same notice argument if it were a quid pro quo type of claim?"
1985.84-1979,0,24694,f_robert_troll_jr,,839.605,844.878,"We don't necessarily distinguish between the two, Your Honor."
1985.84-1979,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,863.57,869.374,"Yes, but is that any different from acting with respect to the conditions, working conditions around the office?"
1985.84-1979,0,24694,f_robert_troll_jr,,869.374,879.371,"The problem is is that in one case the intent of the employer can be measured, whereas in the other it cannot unless there is in fact notice to the employer."
1985.84-1979,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,879.371,892.038,"Well, Mr. Troll, isn't supervision... isn't part of supervision the creation of a productive work environment and the proper management of the employees who are supervised?"
1985.84-1979,0,24694,f_robert_troll_jr,,892.038,895.501,"I would agree with that, Justice O'Connor."
1985.84-1979,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,898.572,911.902,Why wouldn't the agency theory then cover an assumption that the supervisor is going to create a proper and productive work environment for the employees being supervised?
1985.84-1979,0,24694,f_robert_troll_jr,,911.902,938.471,"--The employer here has in no way authorized supervisory personnel to harass its other subordinate employes, such that under an agency concept the acts of the supervisor would be outside the scope, actual or apparent, of the supervisor, and Title VII would probably not impose any liability."
1985.84-1979,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,946.595,963.987,"Well, but if the supervisor discharged an employee within his apparent authority to do so, but his real reason was a racial discriminatory reason, do you think the employer has a defense?"
1985.84-1979,0,24694,f_robert_troll_jr,,963.987,973.432,I think that the employee then has a duty to go forward to someone at the employer and to notify the employer.
1985.84-1979,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1023.455,1030.959,"Mr. Troll, can a supervisor who is not an employer be made a defendant in a Title VII action?"
1985.84-1979,0,24694,f_robert_troll_jr,,1030.959,1041.978,"It is our understanding that, under the definitional section of the statute, an agent of the employer could include a supervisor."
1985.84-1979,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1041.978,1046.16,So that a supervisor who was not an employer could be named as a defendant?
1985.84-1979,0,24694,f_robert_troll_jr,,1046.16,1048.952,You're saying is not an employer.
1985.84-1979,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1051.082,1060.167,"Well, I mean, supposing that in this case Ms. Vinson had simply decided to bring a Title VII action against the supervisor."
1985.84-1979,0,24694,f_robert_troll_jr,,1060.167,1067.493,"That is our reading of the statute, Your Honor; that would be perfectly within the statute and within its meaning."
1985.84-1979,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1067.493,1071.815,So you do not have to be an employer in your view to be named a defendant?
1985.84-1979,0,24694,f_robert_troll_jr,,1071.815,1073.888,"That is correct, that would be our feeling."
1985.84-1979,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1110.811,1119.467,"But of course, supposing you had just a common law fraud action, where your fraud required intent to deceive."
1985.84-1979,0,24694,f_robert_troll_jr,,1133.548,1144.904,"It would depend upon, I think, some further circumstances: the scope of the authority actually vested, the scope of the apparent authority of the salesman."
1985.84-1979,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1179.728,1187.331,"May I ask you on that question, supposing the harassment, if it did occur... and of course, we don't really know exactly what did happen here."
1985.84-1979,0,24694,f_robert_troll_jr,,1201.392,1230.421,"Well, under the EEOC guidelines there would have to be notice in that case, and it would be my feeling that, if the supervisor was charged with responsibility, as he would be, with maintaining a good working environment, you couldn't determine the corporate intent, however, unless one of those employees complained above the supervisor."
1985.84-1979,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1232.652,1235.132,The answer is you would make the same argument?
1985.84-1979,0,24694,f_robert_troll_jr,,1235.132,1236.494,I would make the same argument.
1985.84-1979,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1243.467,1253.796,"Well, there certainly are a substantial number of lower court cases dealing with, for example, racial harassment by co-employees, that don't adopt your theory at all."
1985.84-1979,0,24694,f_robert_troll_jr,,1269.684,1271.196,There are several cases--
1985.84-1979,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1271.196,1272.108,--that there is a body of opinion?
1985.84-1979,0,24694,f_robert_troll_jr,,1272.108,1274.418,--There are several cases of that ilk.
1985.84-1979,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1285.997,1289.369,"Well, but some form of management, of course, is the supervisor."
1985.84-1979,0,24694,f_robert_troll_jr,,1298.165,1304.56,We would submit that the majority of those cases do involve employer toleration of a condition.
1985.84-1979,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1312.454,1323.45,I thought that the district court kept out evidence that was offered of the supervisor's treatment of other employes.
1985.84-1979,0,24694,f_robert_troll_jr,,1323.45,1335.218,"As the district court said in its opinion, some of that form of evidence was allowed in in the plaintiff's case in chief, some of it was not."
1985.84-1979,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1385.821,1392.236,To whom do you have to give the notice to be able to say the employer knew?
1985.84-1979,0,24694,f_robert_troll_jr,,1392.236,1398.52,We think and we submit that internally notice should go to someone with requisite authority--
1985.84-1979,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1398.52,1399.111,"Well, who is that?"
1985.84-1979,0,24694,f_robert_troll_jr,,1403.093,1405.684,"--Well, in this particular case--"
1985.84-1979,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1405.684,1415.01,"Would the supervisor's boss, this particular supervisor's boss, he adequate, that you gave him notice?"
1985.84-1979,0,24694,f_robert_troll_jr,,1415.01,1418.693,--At some point in time you would reach a corporate level--
1985.84-1979,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1418.693,1419.264,"Well, which?"
1985.84-1979,0,24694,f_robert_troll_jr,,1424.697,1432.36,"--In this particular case, Your Honor, we feel that notice should have gone to the EEO officer, with whom the plaintiff had frequent contact."
1985.84-1979,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1438.215,1439.086,--What officer?
1985.84-1979,0,24694,f_robert_troll_jr,,1439.086,1445.66,The equal opportunity employment officer that this bank had in place.
1985.84-1979,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1445.66,1449.183,"Well, did he have any authority over the supervisor?"
1985.84-1979,0,24694,f_robert_troll_jr,,1449.183,1453.077,"Yes, sir, he certainly did, and the record so indicates."
1985.84-1979,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1453.077,1457.138,"Well, was that officer an officer of the bank?"
1985.84-1979,0,24694,f_robert_troll_jr,,1457.138,1468.665,He was a senior bank officer who had also been designated as the equal opportunity employment official to carry out the bank's policy of non-discrimination.
1985.84-1979,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1468.665,1471.279,What level of notice?
1985.84-1979,0,24694,f_robert_troll_jr,,1476.592,1485.538,"It would be our feeling that if notice goes to one who has requisite authority to correct the situation, that is all that's sufficient."
1985.84-1979,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1485.538,1488.69,"Well, suppose the vice president was guilty."
1985.84-1979,0,24694,f_robert_troll_jr,,1491.783,1495.213,"Well, if you're positing a question in terms of--"
1985.84-1979,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1495.213,1497.777,I don't want anything added.
1985.84-1979,0,24694,f_robert_troll_jr,,1499.807,1506.502,"--If there would still be the president left to complain to, certainly that could be a complaint."
1985.84-1979,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1509.754,1512.646,The Court of Appeals said you couldn't use tort law anyhow.
1985.84-1979,0,24694,f_robert_troll_jr,,1512.646,1515.208,"That's true, that's true."
1985.84-1979,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1515.208,1516.657,Do you agree with that?
1985.84-1979,0,24694,f_robert_troll_jr,,1516.657,1517.719,We feel that's correct.
1985.84-1979,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1661.571,1662.753,Very well.
1985.84-1979,1,37736,patricia_j_barry,,1670.57,1673.9,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1985.84-1979,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1713.457,1718.329,"Ms. Barry, did you represent the plaintiff in the action below?"
1985.84-1979,1,37736,patricia_j_barry,,1718.329,1720.021,"Yes, I was the trial attorney."
1985.84-1979,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1729.259,1742.134,Did the plaintiff and you on her behalf make clear in the proceedings below that you were proceeding on the basis of a hostile environment theory?
1985.84-1979,1,37736,patricia_j_barry,,1742.134,1748.759,"Your Honor, in our Respondents' brief it's cited where I say to the trial court:"
1985.84-1979,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1821.251,1826.804,"May I ask, before you leave that particular point."
1985.84-1979,1,37736,patricia_j_barry,,1826.804,1827.255,"Yes, Justice."
1985.84-1979,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1827.255,1832.807,Which section in your complaint do you rely on as supporting environmental harassment?
1985.84-1979,1,37736,patricia_j_barry,,1832.807,1851.699,"If you go to the joint complaint, one of the allegations is that there was a pattern of sexual misconduct... I am paraphrasing... engaged in by Sidney Taylor, that the bank should have known about and therefore acquiesced in and ratified."
1985.84-1979,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1851.699,1855.873,"Is that in your complaint that was filed September 22nd, 1978?"
1985.84-1979,1,37736,patricia_j_barry,,1855.873,1857.014,"That's correct, Justice."
1985.84-1979,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1857.014,1857.784,Which paragraph?
1985.84-1979,1,37736,patricia_j_barry,,1857.784,1869.972,Begging the Court... paragraph 14 at page 5 of the joint appendix.
1985.84-1979,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1869.972,1870.502,Yes.
1985.84-1979,1,37736,patricia_j_barry,,1870.502,1888.034,"""Defendant Taylor has also sexually harassed numerous other female employees of the defendant association, and said conduct constitutes a well-known pattern of behavior which has been known to the officials of the defendant association for many years and which thereby and therefore has been condoned by the defendant association. """
1985.84-1979,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1888.034,1890.524,There's no mention of Environment in that paragraph.
1985.84-1979,1,37736,patricia_j_barry,,1890.524,1891.335,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1985.84-1979,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1966.934,1979.973,"What if we agreed with one of the submissions of the bank, namely that voluntariness is a defense to a suit like this."
1985.84-1979,1,37736,patricia_j_barry,,1979.973,1987.598,"Well, Your Honor, the question has to be looked at in the context of environmental harassment."
1985.84-1979,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2014.526,2019.558,"Well, the Court of Appeals ruled that voluntariness was irrelevant."
1985.84-1979,1,37736,patricia_j_barry,,2019.558,2026.013,It did in the way that the trial court captioned its findings of fact.
1985.84-1979,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2030.738,2042.635,"Nevertheless, the Court of Appeals thought that a hostile environment suit was quite proper, and it felt it necessary to rule on the voluntariness and the notice claim."
1985.84-1979,1,37736,patricia_j_barry,,2042.635,2043.814,That's right.
1985.84-1979,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2060.317,2067.6,"Well, are you defending the Court of Appeals' rulings on notice and voluntariness?"
1985.84-1979,1,37736,patricia_j_barry,,2067.6,2072.822,I'm certainly defending the Court of Appeals' position on notice.
1985.84-1979,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2091.516,2102.413,It's been suggested that an element is a sexual harassment claim is that the conduct complained of be unwelcome.
1985.84-1979,1,37736,patricia_j_barry,,2102.413,2103.795,"Yes, Justice."
1985.84-1979,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2103.795,2115.451,"Is the term ""unwelcome"" the same as... does that equate with whether it's voluntary or not, or is there a difference in your view?"
1985.84-1979,1,37736,patricia_j_barry,,2115.451,2120.114,"Well, that again I think goes back to what the Court of Appeals was trying to say."
1985.84-1979,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2135.986,2143.211,"Well, do you think the Court of Appeals had in mind as an element of a sexual harassment claim that the conduct must be unwelcome?"
1985.84-1979,1,37736,patricia_j_barry,,2143.211,2144.52,Yes.
1985.84-1979,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2167.675,2183.376,"That's hard to reconcile, Ms. Barry, with... your view of the unwelcomeness, with the Court of Appeals' ruling that evidence of the complaining employee's work place dress and voluntary conduct couldn't be admitted."
1985.84-1979,1,37736,patricia_j_barry,,2183.376,2203.249,"--Your Honor, Justice Rehnquist, with respect to evidence of the dress, evidence of the dress by itself without anything more does not make it more likely or less likely under the Federal Rules of Evidence that she welcomed the advances of the supervisor."
1985.84-1979,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2203.249,2210.625,"Well now, is that for you as a lawyer to say, that no finder of fact could find that relevant?"
1985.84-1979,1,37736,patricia_j_barry,,2210.625,2220.132,"Yes, that dress by itself is so subjective, Justice Rehnquist, that it has little probative value."
1985.84-1979,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2228.226,2233.628,"Yes, and the district court in this case controlled it by letting it in."
1985.84-1979,1,37736,patricia_j_barry,,2233.628,2242.244,"--And did so, created such prejudice that he never got to the primary fact-finding responsibility in this case, Justice Rehnquist."
1985.84-1979,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2267.71,2280.159,"So you say, then, that evidence of the complaining employee's work place dress and voluntary conduct is not admissible on the issue of whether or not the thing was unwelcome?"
1985.84-1979,1,37736,patricia_j_barry,,2280.159,2281.831,"--Justice Rehnquist, what I'm saying to you--"
1985.84-1979,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2281.831,2283.241,Are you or are you not?
1985.84-1979,1,37736,patricia_j_barry,,2283.241,2284.773,"--No, I'm not saying that."
1985.84-1979,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2295.68,2298.212,"Well, of course it isn't standing alone here."
1985.84-1979,1,37736,patricia_j_barry,,2316.814,2335.196,"If we're talking about work place conduct is a sexual harassment case, the California Rules of Evidence... I think it's 1103 or 1105... provides an excellent guidance, and it would be a good guidance for a federal court to follow in making rules of evidence."
1985.84-1979,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2342.06,2343.04,Ms. Barry.
1985.84-1979,1,37736,patricia_j_barry,,2343.04,2344.173,"Yes, Justice."
1985.84-1979,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2344.173,2353.696,May I ask whether the Court of Appeals found that any of the findings of fact by the district court were clearly erroneous?
1985.84-1979,1,37736,patricia_j_barry,,2353.696,2356.05,"No, it did not, Justice."
1985.84-1979,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2356.05,2361.163,And do you consider you are bound by all 21 of those findings of fact?
1985.84-1979,1,37736,patricia_j_barry,,2361.163,2370.359,"Yes, unless this Court determines that it would like to review the full record and order the production of the trial transcript."
1985.84-1979,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2390.171,2392.452,The final finding by the trial court was that--
1985.84-1979,1,37736,patricia_j_barry,,2392.933,2396.146,So we didn't get the trial transcript.
1985.84-1979,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2396.887,2404.571,"I was just going to say, the final finding was that the plaintiff was not the victim... this is on page 44A of the petition:"
1985.84-1979,1,37736,patricia_j_barry,,2415.968,2428.496,"Well, Justice, I don't think it does, because the trial court at 44A of the appendix makes it very clear what in its mind constitutes sexual harassment, and the trial court says:"
1985.84-1979,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2538.98,2540.87,May I ask one more question.
1985.84-1979,1,37736,patricia_j_barry,,2540.87,2541.591,"Yes, Justice."
1985.84-1979,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2541.591,2547.625,"In your rebuttal testimony, did you introduce evidence by any other women that they had been harassed?"
1985.84-1979,1,37736,patricia_j_barry,,2547.625,2552.367,I did not present that at that time.
1985.84-1979,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2559.951,2563.274,But the trial court did say you could have introduced that in rebuttal?
1985.84-1979,1,37736,patricia_j_barry,,2563.274,2576.254,"In the rebuttal, but there would be no purpose because, unless the defendant, either one of the defendants or both of them, was putting on a case of environmental harassment, it would not, even under the rules of evidence, be proper rebuttal."
1985.84-1979,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2594.354,2601.59,"But whatever the reason, so far as this Court is concerned we have only the testimony of your client?"
1985.84-1979,1,37736,patricia_j_barry,,2601.59,2605.131,You're saying that is lodged with the Court?
1985.84-1979,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2605.131,2606.543,Yes.
1985.84-1979,1,37736,patricia_j_barry,,2606.543,2608.814,"We have that transcribed, because that's--"
1985.84-1979,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2608.814,2613.166,Only the testimony of your client as to sexual harassment or as to the environment.
1985.84-1979,1,37736,patricia_j_barry,,2613.166,2616.459,"--That's correct, Your Honor, Justice."
1985.84-1979,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2672.764,2677.549,"The Court of Appeals decided that question, didn't it?"
1985.84-1979,1,37736,patricia_j_barry,,2677.549,2682.302,"Yes, it did, without it being briefed by either the bank or myself."
1985.84-1979,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2740.872,2744.225,"Well, you don't have to use that sort of evidence as impeaching evidence."
1985.84-1979,1,37736,patricia_j_barry,,2751.969,2764.287,"Well, the federal rules of evidence frown on using general character evidence as proof that that person acted in conformity with that character at a specific time, and that's exactly what this evidence was designed to do."
1985.84-1979,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2841.578,2847.482,"Well, the district court in a bench trial has a great deal of latitude in deciding what kind of evidence it's admitting."
1985.84-1979,1,37736,patricia_j_barry,,2853.814,2872.828,"--Justice Rehnquist, it would be analogous, for example, in a rape case the trier of fact certainly would not permit the defendant to present evidence of how the victim dressed to prove the issue of consent."
1985.84-1979,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2876.081,2877.753,I'm not entirely sure you're correct.
1985.84-1979,1,37736,patricia_j_barry,,2879.003,2883.307,In terms of that they could present evidence of how--
1985.84-1979,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2883.307,2885.127,In a civil action.
1985.84-1979,1,37736,patricia_j_barry,,2885.127,2900.827,"--Well, Justice Rehnquist, the evidence of dress is so subjective and has so much to do with so many other factors other than proving that that particular individual, that woman, consented to the advances."
1985.84-1979,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2900.827,2903.83,This may be a good argument to make to the district court.
1985.84-1979,1,37736,patricia_j_barry,,2917.117,2921.941,"Well, Justice Rehnquist, just once more, just alluding to the California Rules of Evidence--"
1985.84-1979,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2921.941,2925.624,"Well, we're not governed by the California Rules of Evidence, Ms. Barry."
1985.84-1979,1,37736,patricia_j_barry,,2925.624,2926.304,"--Yes, Justice."
1985.84-1979,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2926.304,2928.066,We're practicing under federal rules of evidence.
1985.84-1979,1,37736,patricia_j_barry,,2928.066,2928.487,Yes.
1985.84-1979,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2938.741,2941.693,And the district court did exercise some control.
1985.84-1979,1,37736,patricia_j_barry,,2942.635,2951.551,"Yes, and for that reason we're arguing that in this particular case, because of what I've just argue to you, Justice Rehnquist, it was wholly irrelevant."
1985.84-1979,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3075.472,3082.476,"Counsel, I might have missed it, but how do you answer the question about notice?"
1985.84-1979,1,37736,patricia_j_barry,,3082.476,3100.616,"With respect to notice, we rely on the definition of employer set out in Section 701(a), which talks about an employer is a person, which is anyone engaged in commerce and employing so many employees, and an agent of that employer."
1985.84-1979,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3117.409,3119.412,That was when he was out at the motel?
1985.84-1979,1,37736,patricia_j_barry,,3119.412,3122.815,"Excuse me, Justice?"
1985.84-1979,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3122.815,3125.286,He was the supervisor when he was out at the motel?
1985.84-1979,1,37736,patricia_j_barry,,3125.286,3132.98,"Yes, because the conditions of being out there was, like I have the power to hire you, I have the power to fire you."
1985.84-1979,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3168.533,3180.651,I agree that the statute defines an agent of an employer as an employer himself or herself.
1985.84-1979,1,37736,patricia_j_barry,,3200.404,3202.016,--And it is the--
1985.84-1979,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3202.016,3203.226,And can be sued for it.
1985.84-1979,1,37736,patricia_j_barry,,3203.226,3204.117,"--That's right, Justice."
1985.84-1979,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3204.117,3209.921,I don't see why you think that notice to Taylor is notice to another employer.
1985.84-1979,1,37736,patricia_j_barry,,3209.921,3214.615,"Well, the employer in the sense of being the collective entity, the bank."
1985.84-1979,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3214.615,3215.044,"Well, I know."
1985.84-1979,1,37736,patricia_j_barry,,3224.559,3225.64,Because--
1985.84-1979,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3225.64,3226.63,That isn't what the statute says.
1985.84-1979,1,37736,patricia_j_barry,,3226.63,3233.535,"--Well, the statute says that the definition of employer shall include the agent, and--"
1985.84-1979,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3233.535,3236.888,"I agree with you, and all that means is that the agent is an employer."
1985.84-1979,1,37736,patricia_j_barry,,3236.888,3238.989,"--That's correct, and therefore--"
1985.84-1979,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3238.989,3240.12,"Well, that's all it means."
1985.84-1979,1,37736,patricia_j_barry,,3248.165,3255.501,"--Well, it says that the employer is the person, the employer is the agent."
1985.84-1979,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3256.292,3257.944,"Well, that just means an agent is an employer."
1985.84-1979,1,37736,patricia_j_barry,,3257.944,3258.515,--Yes.
1985.84-1979,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3259.376,3259.645,That's all.
1985.84-1979,1,37736,patricia_j_barry,,3259.645,3260.065,--All right.
1985.84-1979,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3268.23,3272.384,"Well, that's quite a gloss on what the statute says, I must say."
1985.84-1979,1,37736,patricia_j_barry,,3279.41,3280.472,"Well, in fact--"
1985.84-1979,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3280.472,3281.361,And could you sue them both?
1985.84-1979,1,37736,patricia_j_barry,,3281.361,3282.082,--Yes.
1985.84-1979,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3282.082,3290.336,"And the only reason you could sue Taylor is not because he was an agent of the bank, but because the statute says you could sue him as an employer."
1985.84-1979,1,37736,patricia_j_barry,,3290.336,3310.759,"But for purposes of Title VII liability the courts have routinely held that the collective entity, which would be Meritor Bank in this case, Justice, would, if there were discriminatory intent and a discriminatory act proven on the part of Sidney Taylor, the supervisor, then the collective entity becomes liable."
1985.84-1979,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3312.762,3320.767,"What about, what would you say if a co-employee, not a supervisor, did this harassing?"
1985.84-1979,1,37736,patricia_j_barry,,3320.767,3325.061,--Then the issue of notice would come into operation.
1985.84-1979,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3325.061,3326.641,"Well, why?"
1985.84-1979,1,37736,patricia_j_barry,,3329.843,3339.76,"No, either under Title VII definitions or even under principles of traditional common law concepts of principal-agency doctrine, that just wouldn't operate."
1985.84-1979,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3346.215,3347.787,So you couldn't sue a co-employee?
1985.84-1979,1,37736,patricia_j_barry,,3347.787,3348.876,"Yes, you could."
1985.84-1979,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3348.876,3349.778,Under Title VII?
1985.84-1979,1,37736,patricia_j_barry,,3349.778,3350.789,I'm sorry.
1985.84-1979,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3423.916,3432.692,"Suppose Mr. Taylor was embezzling money from the bank regularly, unknown to anyone else in the bank."
1985.84-1979,1,37736,patricia_j_barry,,3448.593,3459.66,"Chief Justice, I would doubt that to be the case, because there we can distinguish that particular hypothetical from the instant one."
1985.84-1979,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3476.08,3477.062,Your time is expired now.
1985.84-1979,1,37736,patricia_j_barry,,3477.062,3477.542,All right.
1985.84-1979,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3477.542,3480.134,"The light is covered, hut the red light is on."
1985.84-1979,1,37736,patricia_j_barry,,3480.134,3482.755,"I'm sorry, I had it covered up."
1985.84-1979,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3482.755,3483.545,Very good.
1985.84-1979,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3483.545,3492.3,"You have two minutes remaining, Mr. Troll."
1985.84-1979,2,24694,f_robert_troll_jr,,3492.3,3505.158,"Very briefly, the reason why notice to Mr. Taylor is not notice to the bank is that notice to the actual perpetrator in and of itself can never constitute notice."
1985.84-1979,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3558.984,3561.177,"Thank you, counsel."
