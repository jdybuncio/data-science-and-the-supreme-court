1979.78-1548,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,57.174,We'll hear arguments next in California Brewers Association against Bryant.
1979.78-1548,0,44264,willard_z_carr_jr,,58.32,58.819,Mr. Chief Justice
1979.78-1548,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,58.819,59.347,-- you're ready.
1979.78-1548,0,44264,willard_z_carr_jr,,59.347,61.752,-- may it please the Court.
1979.78-1548,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,475.739,476.386,Mr. Carr --
1979.78-1548,0,44264,willard_z_carr_jr,,476.386,476.709,Yes sir.
1979.78-1548,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,476.709,483.113,-- you don't -- will you point out where in the Ninth Circuit statement was incorrect.
1979.78-1548,0,44264,willard_z_carr_jr,,483.113,486.616,"Well, in our opinion, Your Honor, they said it was an all or nothing proposition."
1979.78-1548,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,490.684,492.202,Is -- is that incorrect?
1979.78-1548,0,44264,willard_z_carr_jr,,492.202,497.485,"It is incorrect, Your Honor in this respect, in our opinion."
1979.78-1548,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,536.505,540.377,"Well, I don't think the Ninth Circuit meant it was lost in that respect."
1979.78-1548,0,44264,willard_z_carr_jr,,545.465,556.217,He has to earn 45 weeks within the calendar year but he does not start over again in the sense that his seniority is continuing to push him ahead.
1979.78-1548,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,566.299,576.118,"Well, is it not true that if one man who worked on a year and a half but happened to work 45 weeks in one calendar year, is a permanent employee."
1979.78-1548,0,44264,willard_z_carr_jr,,584.355,585.997,"That's conceivable, Your Honor."
1979.78-1548,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,654.091,664.528,"Does the record show how many get across the line between “temporary” and you admit this is a poor term, into the permanent category?"
1979.78-1548,0,44264,willard_z_carr_jr,,664.528,665.654,"No, Your Honor."
1979.78-1548,1,40713,roland_p_wilder_jr,,1256.914,1262.22,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1979.78-1548,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1501.378,1513.338,"You say in effect this -- if that's all seniority, means all you would need to do is have a (Voice Overlap) one or two sentence definition of it, the number of days you worked for the plant."
1979.78-1548,1,40713,roland_p_wilder_jr,,1513.338,1514.555,I'm not sure I followed the question.
1979.78-1548,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1514.555,1528.208,"Well, you're -- you're saying that seniority is as simple as the Ninth Circuit said it was, then all you would need in defining a seniority system is a one or two sentenced paragraph."
1979.78-1548,1,40713,roland_p_wilder_jr,,1528.208,1535.889,Simply a -- a sentence in the collective bargaining agreement saying that plant seniority shall govern for all purposes.
1979.78-1548,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1538.515,1544.272,"Well, it would still have to be -- well, suppose defined in terms of interruptions and so on."
1979.78-1548,1,40713,roland_p_wilder_jr,,1544.272,1550.306,"Well, I think that there is one other factor that would have to be here other than the measure of seniority."
1979.78-1548,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1550.306,1550.493,Right.
1979.78-1548,1,40713,roland_p_wilder_jr,,1550.493,1554.346,There would have to be a definition of the field of eligible participants.
1979.78-1548,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1554.346,1554.834,Certainly.
1979.78-1548,1,40713,roland_p_wilder_jr,,1557.733,1561.241,"Otherwise, you (Voice Overlap) wouldn't also compete using their plant seniority."
1979.78-1548,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1561.241,1563.853,Precisely.
1979.78-1548,1,40713,roland_p_wilder_jr,,1563.853,1578.182,But the -- the point that I -- that I wish to make and I -- I think it is an important one that the qualifications on absolute accumulation of seniority exist today.
1979.78-1548,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1635.829,1636.685,Mr. Wolpman.
1979.78-1548,2,33448,james_wolpman,,1636.685,1641.677,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1979.78-1548,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1682.056,1688.396,"Well, he obviously didn't work for seven years in the common meaning of that term.He -- he worked for the parts of seven years."
1979.78-1548,2,33448,james_wolpman,,1688.54,1688.716,Right.
1979.78-1548,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1692.454,1696.873,"Well, we don't know what his income was, I mean it -- it could've been -- even if he'd worked a week in one year."
1979.78-1548,2,33448,james_wolpman,,1696.873,1697.305,Right.
1979.78-1548,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1705.821,1707.743,He didn't work for seven years.
1979.78-1548,2,33448,james_wolpman,,1708.11,1708.679,That's correct.
1979.78-1548,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1708.679,1709.013,Yes.
1979.78-1548,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1709.013,1709.261,Did this case --
1979.78-1548,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1709.261,1709.645,Right.
1979.78-1548,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1709.645,1712.644,-- go off on summary judgment or was it after trials?
1979.78-1548,2,33448,james_wolpman,,1712.644,1719.724,"It was even before summary judgments on motions to dismiss filed by the defendant breweries, Your Honor."
1979.78-1548,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1719.724,1727.536,And the motions for summary judgment granted by the breweries were granted in that -- those judgment or were reversed by the Ninth Circuit?
1979.78-1548,2,33448,james_wolpman,,1727.536,1728.588,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1979.78-1548,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1728.588,1729.764,And remanded.
1979.78-1548,2,33448,james_wolpman,,1729.764,1731.95,That's correct.
1979.78-1548,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1764.496,1773.508,"Well, that's true of someone who has worked five years on an assembly line and someone who's worked 25 years on an assembly line too, isn't it?"
1979.78-1548,2,33448,james_wolpman,,1773.508,1776.102,I doubt that it would be that extreme.
1979.78-1548,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1789.701,1790.644,What do you mean a litmus paper test?
1979.78-1548,2,33448,james_wolpman,,1790.644,1795.735,"Well, any -- there's so many differences."
1979.78-1548,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1831.312,1844.114,"But if this -- our case wasn't on summary judgment or a motion to dismiss, how can the Ninth Circuit have any peculiar knowledge as to what was “behind” the Agreement."
1979.78-1548,2,33448,james_wolpman,,1844.114,1846.78,"The Agreement itself will tell us a lot, Your Honor."
1979.78-1548,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1862.216,1868.091,"But it was collectively bargained for by the union, could -- presumably has the employee in mind."
1979.78-1548,2,33448,james_wolpman,,1868.091,1868.35,Right.
1979.78-1548,2,33448,james_wolpman,,1877.754,1889.296,"In fact, the fine -- essential a finite wage and benefit package has been divided up by those few permanents to the disadvantage of the temporaries."
1979.78-1548,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1889.296,1901.523,"Well, isn't that a complaint that temporaries may have against the union rather than that the possible permanent employee has against the employer?"
1979.78-1548,2,33448,james_wolpman,,1901.523,1919.128,"I think it raises really -- no, the question that is the -- is this really a seniority a provision or is it a thing that allows the employer low-paid labor and the old timers the right to -- to divide up a -- a package among themselves, a -- a smaller number."
1979.78-1548,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1945.904,1959.045,But to the extent that it makes it more expensive for the employer to keep on employees who worked for a number of years and the employer has a finite amount of money that he can devote to labor cost.
1979.78-1548,2,33448,james_wolpman,,1965.659,1968.085,"It certainly does, Your Honor but that's not seniority."
1979.78-1548,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1995.052,2018.889,"But any bona fide seniority system is necessarily going to be top heavy with labor cost at the -- at -- at the upper end of the age scale of the workers and if the -- if it's a finite of amount of wages of -- of money available to the employer, it's going to be conversely lower in the lower wage scales."
1979.78-1548,2,33448,james_wolpman,,2018.889,2028.498,"I -- I think we have to get -- to -- to get at the -- to the answer to that question, you have to begin to see what kind of industry we're talking about here, Mr. Justice Rehnquist."
1979.78-1548,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2096.614,2113.152,"Well, you say that a -- as a rule where 45 weeks out of 52 does not count as seniority or if it's a 44, does not advance one toward seniority, is a seasonal industry?"
1979.78-1548,2,33448,james_wolpman,,2113.152,2113.754,"That's right, Your Honor."
1979.78-1548,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2126.836,2132.287,What's the vacation period maximum for a very seniority employee in this industry?
1979.78-1548,2,33448,james_wolpman,,2132.287,2134.738,"I don't know off the top of my head, Your Honor."
1979.78-1548,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2135.965,2137.867,"Must be at least two to three weeks, isn't it?"
1979.78-1548,2,33448,james_wolpman,,2137.867,2138.348,That's right.
1979.78-1548,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2138.348,2140.259,More likely three than two.
1979.78-1548,2,33448,james_wolpman,,2140.259,2141.342,That's right.
1979.78-1548,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2141.36,2142.856,Possibly four?
1979.78-1548,2,33448,james_wolpman,,2142.856,2143.874,Possibly.
1979.78-1548,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2146.851,2147.024,Then you don't have --
1979.78-1548,2,33448,james_wolpman,,2147.024,2147.681,-- to pass --
1979.78-1548,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2147.681,2154.38,-- then you don't have many -- you don't have much range between five weeks and four weeks and seven weeks.
1979.78-1548,2,33448,james_wolpman,,2154.38,2156.83,"It's a -- it's a very, very difficult hurdle."
1979.78-1548,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2232.313,2244.021,"Since this was decided rather summarily as it was, I suppose there is nothing in this case -- in the record to show the history of the collective bargaining of this particular provision, is there?"
1979.78-1548,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2244.811,2251.173,But one -- one can assume that it followed the pattern that you're describing of give and take.
1979.78-1548,2,33448,james_wolpman,,2251.173,2252.422,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1979.78-1548,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2416.099,2425.008,"Did the -- did the Ninth Circuit send this back for trial or did it simply say, “This is not a seniority system.”"
1979.78-1548,2,33448,james_wolpman,,2425.008,2441.475,"It -- well, it -- it sent it back for trial but it also said that this is not a seniority system, therefore, we would go to trial on the issue of whether it is perpetu -- whether it indeed does perpetuate discrimination and whether it can be justified as a business necessity."
1979.78-1548,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2443.086,2452.932,"Well, if you -- if you -- if you're right and you have to kind of look at the purpose of the thing just behind it, I would think that was a factual issue if there ever was one."
1979.78-1548,2,33448,james_wolpman,,2452.932,2462.027,I -- I would say that except that the facts are so completely clear in the collect -- from the nature of the collective bargaining agreement.
1979.78-1548,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2492.108,2494.222,It certainly was collective bargaining in this.
1979.78-1548,2,33448,james_wolpman,,2494.222,2504.252,It certainly was collective bargaining but not everything as we well know from the history of Title VII litigation is in collective bargaining is to be protected.
1979.78-1548,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2549.717,2557.648,"Well, on the other hand, if this is not a seniority system, it's going to be quite a swath cut through collective bargaining agreements, isn't there?"
1979.78-1548,2,33448,james_wolpman,,2557.648,2559.057,"No greater a swath, Your Honor."
1979.78-1548,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2559.057,2565.05,"Well, how do you -- how do you phrase the position of the AFL-CIO in term --"
1979.78-1548,2,33448,james_wolpman,,2565.05,2566.135,Well --
1979.78-1548,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2566.135,2569.08,They'd -- they'd say this is a seniority system.
1979.78-1548,2,33448,james_wolpman,,2569.08,2572.535,They say that it is a senior -- and they actually adopt our reasoning.
1979.78-1548,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2583.725,2589.432,"Well, in any event, this is -- in any event, this is a seniority system in their -- in their view."
1979.78-1548,2,33448,james_wolpman,,2589.432,2590.327,"In their view, yes, Your Honor."
1979.78-1548,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2590.327,2599.672,"And I suppose I wouldn't be so interested if this was on the effect, maybe one or two strays -- stray collective bargaining agreements, wouldn't it?"
1979.78-1548,2,33448,james_wolpman,,2599.672,2616.77,"It certainly affects any collective bargaining agreement or many collective bargaining agreements in seasonal industry, and I think that in -- in analyzing this problem, the Court is going to have to inevitably meet the question of -- of just how broad 703 (h) could be."
1979.78-1548,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2620.815,2624.995,I suppose somebody besides permanent employees belong to these unions.
1979.78-1548,2,33448,james_wolpman,,2624.995,2626.301,"I -- I'm sorry Your Honor, I didn't hear you."
1979.78-1548,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2626.301,2631.516,I suppose someone besides permanent employees belong to these unions.
1979.78-1548,2,33448,james_wolpman,,2631.516,2632.404,"Yes, Your Honor."
1979.78-1548,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2703.478,2712.192,"Well, your -- your argument about whether this is a seniority system or not would be the same whether there was any racial -- racial aspects of this case at all."
1979.78-1548,2,33448,james_wolpman,,2712.192,2712.753,"Yes, Your Honor."
1979.78-1548,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2726.549,2732.695,And it's not just to -- it won't be disgrace or be any kind of what could be called invidious discrimination.
1979.78-1548,2,33448,james_wolpman,,2736.157,2741.022,"Well, that would have to be gotten not only for the duty of fair representation, Your Honor."
1979.78-1548,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2777.824,2789.017,"Well, certainly, of a good deal of that patience ended with the Landrum-Griffin Act of 1959 where the Congress finally got into the internal affairs of unions to a certain extent."
1979.78-1548,2,33448,james_wolpman,,2789.017,2789.459,"Right, Your Honor."
1979.78-1548,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2808.563,2811.805,But how do you develop a record except by trial?
1979.78-1548,2,33448,james_wolpman,,2811.805,2816.004,"I think with -- well, we have to decide first of all, is this a seniority system?"
1979.78-1548,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2819.737,2821.769,A record of -- of witnesses?
1979.78-1548,2,33448,james_wolpman,,2821.769,2822.037,No.
1979.78-1548,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2855.728,2857.023,Mr. Wallace.
1979.78-1548,3,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2857.023,2860.568,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1979.78-1548,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3112.82,3113.013,Is this the --
1979.78-1548,3,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3113.013,3113.481,our --
1979.78-1548,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3113.481,3115.948,-- is this the Ninth Circuit standard?
1979.78-1548,3,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3115.948,3120.577,"Well, I don't think they were that specific, Mr. Justice."
1979.78-1548,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3352.251,3362.648,"But if the business justification is meant, wouldn't it be also a business justification for that kind of a seniority system?"
1979.78-1548,3,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3362.648,3378.559,"Well, there are -- the -- the seniority aspects of this contract don't need a justification in our view, Mr. Justice, but because they're protected by 703 (h) and some of those were recited by Mr. Carr."
1979.78-1548,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3384.614,3384.989,"Well, you say --"
1979.78-1548,3,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3384.989,3385.205,It's --
1979.78-1548,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3385.205,3394.667,-- then that you -- the plaintiff can pick and choose as among the seniority provisions and say some are protected by 703 (h) and some aren't.
1979.78-1548,3,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3394.667,3406.256,"Well, that the question presupposes that the 45-week rule is a seniority provision but I have devoted my entire argument to the reasons why we think it is not a seniority provision."
1979.78-1548,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3484.142,3502.119,"Well, Mr. Wallace, I think that if -- if the employer and the union had a contract and -- and they agreed that one classification of employees was permanent employees, then at -- in this company, we -- they had agreed there would be a hundred employees of permanent employees."
1979.78-1548,3,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3518.41,3519.912,"Well, there might -- there might be --"
1979.78-1548,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3519.912,3521.261,"Well, that should be the same thing."
1979.78-1548,3,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3521.261,3526.409,It -- it's very similar although there would be some additional certainty of progression in your --
1979.78-1548,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3526.409,3526.501,"Why, what for example?"
1979.78-1548,3,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3526.501,3528.72,"-- hypothetical Mr. Justice, because here --"
1979.78-1548,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3528.72,3531.134,Except that it's just between two years and one --
1979.78-1548,3,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3531.134,3543.928,"Here, the indications are that automation is reducing the number of permanent employees and that people are not progressing into that rank but this is something that has not been explored in detail."
1979.78-1548,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3557.499,3563.495,"But the -- but in this case, the question of seniority has been finally disposed off by the Ninth Circuit."
1979.78-1548,3,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3565.244,3566.105,That is correct --
1979.78-1548,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3566.105,3566.15,Yes.
1979.78-1548,3,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3566.15,3567.057,-- Mr. Justice.
1979.78-1548,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3571.31,3572.847,And you agree with that.
1979.78-1548,3,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3572.847,3573.485,We agree with that.
1979.78-1548,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3573.485,3575.32,Yes.
1979.78-1548,3,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3575.32,3585.396,But what is of principle concern to us are the governing legal principles which I have come to -- to state.
1979.78-1548,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3585.396,3588.178,"Mr. Wilder, you have about six minutes left."
1979.78-1548,4,40713,roland_p_wilder_jr,,3588.178,3592.929,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1979.78-1548,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3624.622,3625.269,Please.
1979.78-1548,4,40713,roland_p_wilder_jr,,3625.269,3627.221,Six weeks per year.
1979.78-1548,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3627.221,3629.139,"And that would be a permanent employee, isn't it?"
1979.78-1548,4,40713,roland_p_wilder_jr,,3629.139,3630.04,Yes.
1979.78-1548,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3638.523,3644.067,"So that, even if this fellow would work only 46 weeks in the year then if he -- if he qualified --"
1979.78-1548,4,40713,roland_p_wilder_jr,,3644.067,3654.519,"If he -- if he took the vacation or if he qualified for it, you don't -- you earn your vacation on the basis of time worked according to a particular formula."
1979.78-1548,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3657.177,3661.278,"I suspect there aren't all that many six weeks people, are there?"
1979.78-1548,4,40713,roland_p_wilder_jr,,3661.278,3661.953,I --
1979.78-1548,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3661.953,3662.294,(Voice Overlap) --
1979.78-1548,4,40713,roland_p_wilder_jr,,3662.294,3663.894,-- do not know Your Honor.
1979.78-1548,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3771.912,3773.577,"Well, but the Government who says more than that."
1979.78-1548,4,40713,roland_p_wilder_jr,,3781.972,3794.8,"The Government proposes a cumulative length of service criterion which is a criterion that henceforth, it's been unknown in the real world of collective bargaining."
1979.78-1548,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3803.458,3805.455,It doesn't -- it doesn't -- isn't triggered by that.
1979.78-1548,4,40713,roland_p_wilder_jr,,3810.531,3812.183,That's correct.
1979.78-1548,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3956.049,3970.874,Could I ask you -- could I ask you if there was -- what if -- what if the only semblance of a seniority system in this case was a collective bargaining provision providing for how people enter the permanent employee class?
1979.78-1548,4,40713,roland_p_wilder_jr,,3989.471,3989.597,It -- it --
1979.78-1548,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3989.597,3990.562,-- you're a permanent employee.
1979.78-1548,4,40713,roland_p_wilder_jr,,3991.814,3993.296,I -- I will answer the question.
1979.78-1548,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3999.318,3999.594,"Well, I know --"
1979.78-1548,4,40713,roland_p_wilder_jr,,3999.594,4000.799,But with that -- but with that --
1979.78-1548,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4000.799,4002.683,Would that be a seniority system or not?
1979.78-1548,4,40713,roland_p_wilder_jr,,4002.683,4006.711,I think it would be because it is based on time worked.
1979.78-1548,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4016.228,4016.277,But you think (Voice Overlap) --
1979.78-1548,4,40713,roland_p_wilder_jr,,4016.277,4019.436,Let's call it a non-seniority criterion.
1979.78-1548,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4019.436,4021.583,You're glad you don't have that case.
1979.78-1548,4,40713,roland_p_wilder_jr,,4021.583,4023.976,"Yes, I am glad I don't have that case."
1979.78-1548,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4026.607,4027.916,Do you say that the Ninth Circuit --
1979.78-1548,4,40713,roland_p_wilder_jr,,4027.916,4027.95,-- in a --
1979.78-1548,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4027.95,4030.367,-- only simplified the case to be just that.
1979.78-1548,4,40713,roland_p_wilder_jr,,4030.367,4031.293,That's correct.
1979.78-1548,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4036.494,4042.122,"Do you say it was wrong even on its -- even on its simplistic assumptions, it was wrong?"
1979.78-1548,4,40713,roland_p_wilder_jr,,4042.122,4047.63,I think that that would make it a -- an easier case analytically.
1979.78-1548,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4052.497,4053.212,"Thank you, gentlemen."
