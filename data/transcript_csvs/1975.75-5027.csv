1975.75-5027,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,41.49,"We will hear arguments next in 75-5027, Bryan against the Itasca County, Minnesota."
1975.75-5027,0,17431,bernard_p_becker,,44.101,46.279,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1975.75-5027,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,372.643,378.763,"Well, what kind of civil law of the state have general applicability under law?"
1975.75-5027,0,17431,bernard_p_becker,,381.722,387.878,"State law of General applicability in connection with causes of action, yes and the question is what kind of laws are those?"
1975.75-5027,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,388.737,393.114,That -- I know you tie the civil laws to a causes of action?
1975.75-5027,0,17431,bernard_p_becker,,393.251,394.773,"I think that is the only way to read, otherwise --"
1975.75-5027,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,394.773,408.273,"Well, I know used to -- I know you do, but -- but it just says, and those civil laws of such state or territory that are of general application to private persons or private properties shall have the same force and effect."
1975.75-5027,0,17431,bernard_p_becker,,408.273,421.27,"Well, I think if you look at the C-section, Your Honor, it says and the Indian law shall be given full force and effect in the determination of civil causes of action pursuant to this Section and I think that --"
1975.75-5027,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,421.27,425.777,(Inaudible) is not inconsistent with any applicable civil law of the state?
1975.75-5027,0,17431,bernard_p_becker,,425.777,430.135,"That is correct, but the point I wanted to make is that determination."
1975.75-5027,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,450.638,459.267,"If I live in Itasca County and do not pay my taxes, does not either that county or the state have a cause of action against me for failure to pay the taxes?"
1975.75-5027,0,17431,bernard_p_becker,,459.267,474.074,"That is correct, but it would have what we would call, they would bring us -- they could bring a civil action against you for to foreclose on any property or in some cases depending on the tax where judgment for those taxes is correct and that is a cause of action."
1975.75-5027,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,519.135,528.737,"Subsection (b) then, which purports to be an exemption from a much more general type of authority I think that you are talking about?"
1975.75-5027,0,17431,bernard_p_becker,,528.737,534.278,We read subsection (b) very differently and I think that that is the mistake that the Minnesota Supreme Court has made.
1975.75-5027,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,567.659,577.152,"But you said a moment of ago this was a lawyer’s statute, that was drafted by lawyers and presumably using legal language rather than just language of general applicability."
1975.75-5027,0,17431,bernard_p_becker,,585.183,586.419,Not necessarily.
1975.75-5027,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,596.996,605.996,"You want to make it -- you give the Indians some insurance, you would say, nothing in this Section shall authorize any taxes on Indians or their property."
1975.75-5027,0,17431,bernard_p_becker,,605.996,607.822,"Well, that is certainly would be one way of doing --"
1975.75-5027,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,607.822,615.514,"I do not want be complicated about it, but in talking about trust property, you just give the broad exemption, which is what you are arguing for anyway?"
1975.75-5027,0,17431,bernard_p_becker,,615.514,632.374,"Well, is that -- we argued that that is the proper reading of the statute, Your Honor, but I think that the words causes of action combined with civil laws of general applicability to indicate to us that it is an adjudicatory section, but at worst or at best if you will, it is an ambiguous statute."
1975.75-5027,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,798.013,802.036,But only with the respect to the specific areas to which it applied?
1975.75-5027,0,17431,bernard_p_becker,,802.036,805.764,It would apply that -- of to a large part of tribal life.
1975.75-5027,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,805.764,810.134,"Not to all, and they excluded certain parts of certain states?"
1975.75-5027,0,17431,bernard_p_becker,,810.134,812.644,"Mr. Justice White, I think you misunderstand the statute."
1975.75-5027,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,897.948,900.697,"I am a little confused by part of your argument, I want you to straighten it to me."
1975.75-5027,0,17431,bernard_p_becker,,912.372,912.833,That is correct.
1975.75-5027,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,925.993,932.993,"What I am really interested in, so you can explain it so that I understand it, is the principle on which some states are in and some are out."
1975.75-5027,0,17431,bernard_p_becker,,939.675,958.774,"In the initial -- for the initial states, each -- the Department of the Interior indicated that they had conversations with both the State Governments and the Tribes in those states and that on the five mandatory states, there was agreement, except for the reservations that were exempted, Red Lake, Warm Springs and Menominee."
1975.75-5027,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,985.293,996.978,"We will resume there at 1 o’clock, Mr. Becker.[Luncheon Break]"
1975.75-5027,0,17431,bernard_p_becker,,999.492,1000.812,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1975.75-5027,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1042.462,1055.927,"But the fact was Mr. Becker, was it not that as of that time the taxability of the personal property of -- personal property on Indian Reservations, both of Indians and a non-Indians was not at all settled --"
1975.75-5027,0,17431,bernard_p_becker,,1055.927,1056.258,"That is correct, Your Honor --"
1975.75-5027,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1056.258,1057.443,-- is that correct?
1975.75-5027,0,17431,bernard_p_becker,,1057.443,1069.241,"-- and that is why I think the reading that the lower court, the state give this indicate that Congress somehow went through and understood what the tax situation was and indicated that that ought to pass to the states as well."
1975.75-5027,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1177.863,1193.164,"Well, I thought the Supreme Court of Minnesota’s opinion seem to go on the idea that A was ambiguous when you talk about all Civil Laws, but some light is thrown on its meaning when you cease B, which apparently carves out otherwise existing authority to tax?"
1975.75-5027,0,17431,bernard_p_becker,,1193.164,1206.089,"Well, I think that they relied very heavily on B as indicating their reading of A, that is correct and without B being there that they would have read A very possibly as not conveying the taxing authority."
1975.75-5027,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1296.55,1301.915,Is there any other kind of authority you think it does not convey other than taxing authority?
1975.75-5027,0,17431,bernard_p_becker,,1301.915,1306.877,"Well, that of course, is one of the key problems."
1975.75-5027,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1400.897,1403.794,Did not we have this in Tonasket --
1975.75-5027,0,17431,bernard_p_becker,,1403.794,1408.324,"That arouse, that arouse in a very different kind of situation I think it is -- Tonasket."
1975.75-5027,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1408.324,1408.855,Tonasket --
1975.75-5027,0,17431,bernard_p_becker,,1408.855,1413.055,"Tonasket versus Washington, yes, which was remanded back and there was a change of statute there."
1975.75-5027,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1438.725,1439.747,That was 280 we were dealing with --
1975.75-5027,0,17431,bernard_p_becker,,1439.747,1440.645,That was 280.
1975.75-5027,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1440.645,1441.078,-- was it not?
1975.75-5027,0,17431,bernard_p_becker,,1441.078,1443.676,"That is correct, to a degree."
1975.75-5027,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1450.042,1450.879,There was a dispute?
1975.75-5027,0,17431,bernard_p_becker,,1450.879,1451.504,Right.
1975.75-5027,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1451.504,1458.154,(Inaudible) The tax law might have been the same without 280?
1975.75-5027,0,17431,bernard_p_becker,,1458.154,1459.055,That is a good possibility.
1975.75-5027,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1467.334,1467.91,Is that your position on that?
1975.75-5027,0,17431,bernard_p_becker,,1467.91,1476.926,Our position is that as far as the pre-collection and imposing the state law obligation to pre-collect on the Indians that the answer is yes.
1975.75-5027,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1547.213,1550.762,"(Inaudible) tradition to it, is it not, to keep mobility?"
1975.75-5027,0,17431,bernard_p_becker,,1550.762,1552.833,"Well, that is yes."
1975.75-5027,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1623.408,1633.126,Very well.
1975.75-5027,1,19438,c_h_luther,,1634.866,1639.382,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1975.75-5027,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1654.491,1658.237,"Perhaps 280, I take it you would agree would not have the power?"
1975.75-5027,1,19438,c_h_luther,,1658.237,1661.867,"Yes, Your Honor, I would."
1975.75-5027,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1853.669,1856.977,"Has the Ninth Circuit gone the other way, Mr. Luther?"
1975.75-5027,1,19438,c_h_luther,,1856.977,1858.544,"Not to my knowledge, Your Honor."
1975.75-5027,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1858.544,1860.076,Not in the Santa Rosa case?
1975.75-5027,1,19438,c_h_luther,,1860.076,1860.642,"No, Your Honor."
1975.75-5027,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1868.096,1870.864,"And what other taxes that might be involved here, income taxes?"
1975.75-5027,1,19438,c_h_luther,,1870.864,1871.739,"Yes, Your Honor."
1975.75-5027,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1875.705,1882.517,"And how about gasoline, state gasoline taxes?"
1975.75-5027,1,19438,c_h_luther,,1883.965,1885.216,Sales tax?
1975.75-5027,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1898.543,1900.681,Any tax of general applicability?
1975.75-5027,1,19438,c_h_luther,,1900.681,1901.406,Yes sir.
1975.75-5027,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1908.847,1910.716,I suppose you have a state gasoline tax?
1975.75-5027,1,19438,c_h_luther,,1910.716,1911.303,"Yes, we do."
1975.75-5027,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1911.303,1912.743,Is it being collected on the reservation?
1975.75-5027,1,19438,c_h_luther,,1912.743,1914.903,"Yes, it is."
1975.75-5027,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1920.086,1923.684,Inheritance?
1975.75-5027,1,19438,c_h_luther,,1923.684,1925.455,"I do not know, Your Honor that --"
1975.75-5027,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1925.455,1928.163,Let us put the property (Inaudible) trust property?
1975.75-5027,1,19438,c_h_luther,,1928.163,1936.37,"Well, the Indians are selling properties that it is dealt -- inheritance tax would apply."
1975.75-5027,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1936.37,1939.409,(Unaudible)
1975.75-5027,1,19438,c_h_luther,,1939.409,1943.827,"Well, this is the personal property tax that we are talking about."
1975.75-5027,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1972.089,1974.573,(Inaudible)
1975.75-5027,1,19438,c_h_luther,,1974.573,1977.007,"You are absolutely right sir, we could not tax the land."
1975.75-5027,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1977.007,1982.368,"Well, could you tax the furniture in the home on the land?"
1975.75-5027,1,19438,c_h_luther,,1982.368,1990.012,"If we had a personal property tax which was applicable to that kind of personal property, yes."
1975.75-5027,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1990.012,1991.925,You just could not tax the building?
1975.75-5027,1,19438,c_h_luther,,1991.925,1999.218,You cannot tax the land itself or a building which is part of the land in the sense that is real property.
1975.75-5027,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1999.218,2001.073,Anything else?
1975.75-5027,1,19438,c_h_luther,,2001.073,2001.249,Yes.
1975.75-5027,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2001.249,2009.892,"The Court said that extending the taxing power of the state is not quiet responsive to the need that was being expressed at the time, is it?"
1975.75-5027,1,19438,c_h_luther,,2010.882,2012.249,No Your Honor.
1975.75-5027,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2030.208,2030.626,I know.
1975.75-5027,1,19438,c_h_luther,,2035.401,2035.578,Criminal.
1975.75-5027,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2035.578,2038.021,-- the lack of remedies and the lack of standing?
1975.75-5027,1,19438,c_h_luther,,2038.021,2076.098,"Well, I think the problem that precipitated it, was it started out as a criminal statute essentially and as it progressed through the Congress, it expanded in its scope and then expanded from merely a criminal, subjecting the Indians to the state criminal laws and state jurisdiction in criminal matters to civil which is the Section that we are speaking off and then that expanded and progressed to the point where it included not only giving the Indians access to the State Courts for civil litigation purposes."
1975.75-5027,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2076.098,2077.13,Subject to rules?
1975.75-5027,1,19438,c_h_luther,,2077.13,2088.661,"Exactly, which maybe appropriate now to bring up the fourth point that I want to bring up which is the policy question."
1975.75-5027,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2181.119,2186.13,I suppose that same argument could have been made in McClanahan --
1975.75-5027,1,19438,c_h_luther,,2186.13,2207.865,"Yes, Your Honor, it could have been made in McClanahan, but McClanahan did not have Public Law 280 and this was of course is the major difference because our position is that Public Law 280 authorizes, grants us jurisdiction to the State and Public Law 280 did not apply in the McClanahan case."
1975.75-5027,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2210.04,2212.752,"General Luther, may I ask you a question please?"
1975.75-5027,1,19438,c_h_luther,,2234.896,2237.221,"I am not clear on that Your Honor, I think perhaps --"
1975.75-5027,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2237.221,2242.274,You might make quite a difference in whether you think they are ready to pay their share of the taxes or not?
1975.75-5027,1,19438,c_h_luther,,2243.778,2244.131,Yes.
1975.75-5027,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2250.201,2250.599,(Inaudible)
1975.75-5027,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2250.599,2254.949,Do you know why Red Lake was exempted?
1975.75-5027,1,19438,c_h_luther,,2254.949,2258.363,"Well, I would defer with Mr. Becker, he is more an expert than I."
1975.75-5027,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2279.85,2285.788,"And that is a partial answer, the question posed by Mr. Justice Stevens, I suppose --"
1975.75-5027,1,19438,c_h_luther,,2285.788,2286.458,Yes.
1975.75-5027,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2293.209,2293.876,Very well.
1975.75-5027,2,17431,bernard_p_becker,,2295.24,2297.083,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1975.75-5027,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2322.474,2326.363,"How about the sales tax on a reservation, absent 280?"
1975.75-5027,2,17431,bernard_p_becker,,2326.363,2330.558,"Absent 280, in a sale to an Indian, clearly no."
1975.75-5027,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2331.202,2333.118,Despite the Buck Act?
1975.75-5027,2,17431,bernard_p_becker,,2333.118,2339.987,Despite the Buck Act.
1975.75-5027,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2392.975,2394.119,"(Inaudible), is it not?"
1975.75-5027,2,17431,bernard_p_becker,,2422.152,2428.752,"My problem is I do not -- I am not even sure you can necessarily read this as, you know, a terminationist statute."
1975.75-5027,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2456.671,2460.708,"It did something that was not, that did not exist before though, did not it?"
1975.75-5027,2,17431,bernard_p_becker,,2460.708,2461.22,That it did.
1975.75-5027,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2462.736,2464.032,It worked a major change?
1975.75-5027,2,17431,bernard_p_becker,,2464.032,2473.198,"It worked a major change, but I do not think it worked a major change of subjecting the Indians to State taxes, the full panoply of State taxes."
1975.75-5027,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2479.038,2490.878,"Except, but you I thought considered earlier for all that Congress knew or all the Indians knew, they were subjected to the full panoply State taxes as it is was?"
1975.75-5027,2,17431,bernard_p_becker,,2490.878,2491.812,"Well, they have been fighting (Voice overlap)"
