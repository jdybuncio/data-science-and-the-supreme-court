1990.89-1080,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.106,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Number 89-1080, the Board of Education of Oklahoma City Public Schools v. Robert L. Dowell."
1990.89-1080,0,39089,ronald_l_day,,12.308,15.76,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.89-1080,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,71.179,75.548,"Mr. Day, how do you define unitary status?"
1990.89-1080,0,39089,ronald_l_day,,75.548,95.628,"I define unitary status, Justice Blackmun, as the Court did, the unanimous Court in Swann and Spangler; that is, it's a school district that has dismantled the dual school system and eliminated unlawful discrimination, including the vestiges of unlawful discrimination, to the extent practical."
1990.89-1080,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,95.628,101.449,Do you think that's what the Court meant when it used that term?
1990.89-1080,0,39089,ronald_l_day,,101.449,102.782,"Yes, sir, I do."
1990.89-1080,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,102.782,103.983,No question about it?
1990.89-1080,0,39089,ronald_l_day,,103.983,122.195,"No question about it, because the '77 record demonstrates, Justice Blackmun, that respondents' attorney or plaintiffs' attorney took the position at that time that jurisdiction could not be relinquished until all the vestiges of discrimination had been eliminated, and of course, the district court did relinquish jurisdiction."
1990.89-1080,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,122.195,135.972,"Mr. Day, did the district court in 1977 assume that the plan would remain in effect in making its unitariness binding?"
1990.89-1080,0,39089,ronald_l_day,,135.972,144.81,I believe in 1977 Judge Bohanon did comment that he did not foresee that his order would result in the dismantlement of the plan.
1990.89-1080,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,152.448,163.789,"Well, do you think that a school district reaches that unitary status as soon as the desegregation plan is in effect?"
1990.89-1080,0,39089,ronald_l_day,,163.789,164.339,--No.
1990.89-1080,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,180.484,192.375,"Well, do you think that in 1978, for example, in this case that the school distinct would have been free to reintroduce neighborhood schools?"
1990.89-1080,0,39089,ronald_l_day,,192.375,192.791,Yes.
1990.89-1080,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,194.827,195.71,As of that time?
1990.89-1080,0,39089,ronald_l_day,,195.71,197.56,--Yes.
1990.89-1080,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,197.56,213.789,"And the result apparently would be to, in many of the schools, return it to the conditions that existed when the lawsuit began so many years ago; is that right?"
1990.89-1080,0,39089,ronald_l_day,,213.789,215.741,"No, I believe that's incorrect, Justice O'Connor."
1990.89-1080,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,260.935,272.91,"I take it that part of the definition of a unitary system is a plan that's operated over some period of time in the unitary status, is it not?"
1990.89-1080,0,39089,ronald_l_day,,278.147,279.947,"That is correct, Justice."
1990.89-1080,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,279.947,288.003,"--And does that mean that perceptions are important, perceptions of the community, perception of the students?"
1990.89-1080,0,39089,ronald_l_day,,288.003,289.372,"Yes, it does."
1990.89-1080,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,289.939,292.574,So this case is in part about perceptions?
1990.89-1080,0,39089,ronald_l_day,,292.574,293.107,"--Yes, it is."
1990.89-1080,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,303.43,309.6,"Mr. Day, may I ask you... I'm sorry, did I... may I ask you a question about... that always puzzled me about this case?"
1990.89-1080,0,39089,ronald_l_day,,316.439,317.289,That is correct.
1990.89-1080,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,317.289,321.324,"Was the school board, therefore, still bound by the decree?"
1990.89-1080,0,39089,ronald_l_day,,321.324,323.426,It is our position that they were not.
1990.89-1080,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,323.426,325.228,That he in effect vacated the decree?
1990.89-1080,0,39089,ronald_l_day,,325.228,327.578,"That that was his intent, yes, Justice Stevens."
1990.89-1080,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,327.93,341.388,"Well, but if the decree had remained in effect, it is clear, is it not, that the return to neighborhood schools for the younger children was a violation of the decree?"
1990.89-1080,0,39089,ronald_l_day,,341.388,343.174,"--Yes, that would be correct."
1990.89-1080,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,349.16,353.195,"I understand, and it had a provision in it to go in and ask for a modification."
1990.89-1080,0,39089,ronald_l_day,,360.651,361.235,--Yes.
1990.89-1080,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,361.235,364.587,"So that one of the questions, I guess, is whether the decree was still in effect?"
1990.89-1080,0,39089,ronald_l_day,,364.587,366.289,"Well, we do not believe it was."
1990.89-1080,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,374.026,375.561,"Well, it doesn't say that, though."
1990.89-1080,0,39089,ronald_l_day,,380.03,381.382,That's correct.
1990.89-1080,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,418.888,422.292,Do you know why he didn't go ahead and vacate the decree when he made the finding?
1990.89-1080,0,39089,ronald_l_day,,422.292,424.892,I don't believe he thought it was necessary.
1990.89-1080,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,451.376,467.921,But does the fact that the schools became identifiably... or would become identifiably black in some neighborhoods under the student reassignment plan... does that mean that the Finger Plan didn't work?
1990.89-1080,0,39089,ronald_l_day,,467.921,471.689,No.
1990.89-1080,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,478.295,478.978,Yes.
1990.89-1080,0,39089,ronald_l_day,,478.978,480.912,"No, I don't think so."
1990.89-1080,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,493.722,501.709,"Well, there was a finding in an earller decree, wasn't there, that residential segregation was in part caused by the de jure violation?"
1990.89-1080,0,39089,ronald_l_day,,501.709,504.78,"I don't believe that is correct, Justice Kennedy."
1990.89-1080,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,667.236,670.254,May I question the... I'm sorry.
1990.89-1080,0,39089,ronald_l_day,,689.765,690.834,"Justice Stevens, you're exactly correct."
1990.89-1080,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,698.238,701.457,"--But they were totally unpersuasive to him, as of 1972?"
1990.89-1080,0,39089,ronald_l_day,,701.457,708.546,"That's right, but the prior opinions in the case demonstrate that, for example, there was integration in sporting activities, extracurricular activities."
1990.89-1080,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,708.546,709.046,Right.
1990.89-1080,0,39089,ronald_l_day,,709.046,712.915,"In other words, that some of the Green factors were being impacted prior to '72."
1990.89-1080,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,883.876,900.338,"Mr. Day, do you understand that unitarianist means both that there no continuing discrimination and that the vestiges of past discrimination have been eliminated?"
1990.89-1080,0,39089,ronald_l_day,,900.338,900.721,Yes.
1990.89-1080,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,901.204,912.146,"Or is it rather that unitarianist means you are now running a system in which there is no discrimination, but there may or may not be the vestiges of past discrimination?"
1990.89-1080,0,39089,ronald_l_day,,912.146,924.786,"--It is our position, Justice Scalia, that once unitary status is achieved, it signifies that unlawful discrimination has been eliminated and the vestiges have been eliminated to the extent practical."
1990.89-1080,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,944.7,958.44,How is the school board injured by being required to continue to operate the schools in conformity to the United States Constitution?
1990.89-1080,0,39089,ronald_l_day,,958.44,962.494,The question was how was the board injured?
1990.89-1080,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,967.213,970.432,"xxx the Constitution, do you?"
1990.89-1080,0,39089,ronald_l_day,,970.432,975.802,"--With all due respect, Justice Marshall, they do intend and do comply with the Constitution."
1990.89-1080,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,978.088,980.706,"Well, how are they harmed by it?"
1990.89-1080,0,39089,ronald_l_day,,980.706,983.842,"--Well, they weren't harmed so much, but the young black students were."
1990.89-1080,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,984.375,986.194,"Well, are they a party to this suit?"
1990.89-1080,0,39089,ronald_l_day,,986.194,986.627,--Yes.
1990.89-1080,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,987.444,988.896,Are they are party to this suit?
1990.89-1080,0,39089,ronald_l_day,,988.896,989.779,--The young black children?
1990.89-1080,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,989.779,990.262,Yes.
1990.89-1080,0,39089,ronald_l_day,,990.262,991.146,"Yes, sir, they are."
1990.89-1080,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,992.848,994.014,Yes.
1990.89-1080,0,39089,ronald_l_day,,1000.953,1002.703,"Yes, sir."
1990.89-1080,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1002.703,1004.905,--And that's all they're required to do.
1990.89-1080,0,39089,ronald_l_day,,1004.905,1005.755,"Yes, sir."
1990.89-1080,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1005.755,1007.207,And they object to that?
1990.89-1080,0,39089,ronald_l_day,,1007.207,1008.54,"No, sir."
1990.89-1080,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1008.54,1009.892,"Well, what is--"
1990.89-1080,0,39089,ronald_l_day,,1009.892,1021.098,"They believe that because in 1977 there were increased busing burdens on young minority children, that a change was necessary."
1990.89-1080,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1027.854,1035.691,--What assurance do I have that the school board will continue to operate pursuant to this order?
1990.89-1080,0,39089,ronald_l_day,,1035.691,1039.661,--You have the assurance of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and traditional--
1990.89-1080,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1039.661,1040.261,"Well, that's what--"
1990.89-1080,0,39089,ronald_l_day,,1040.261,1041.444,--Traditional--
1990.89-1080,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1041.444,1051.652,"--That's what the order says, but if you take the order away, what assurance do I have that the school board will continue to follow the Constitution?"
1990.89-1080,0,39089,ronald_l_day,,1051.652,1057.04,"--Well, when they achieve unitary status, they are governed by traditional equal protection principles."
1990.89-1080,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1072.216,1074.585,You'll have to file a new lawsuit.
1990.89-1080,0,39089,ronald_l_day,,1074.585,1077.954,"Yes, sir."
1990.89-1080,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1081.321,1088.309,General Starr.
1990.89-1080,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1088.309,1092.629,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.89-1080,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1289.54,1315.274,"Well, General Starr, how does a school district eliminate the last vestiges of discrimination when residential segregation remains a reality and when at some point in the past the segregated schools may have contributed to that residential segregation?"
1990.89-1080,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1322.112,1346.579,"Justice O'Connor, I think Green itself suggests that factors such as residential segregation cannot in any meaningful sense be considered a vestige once... once there has been good-faith compliance with a desegregation plan."
1990.89-1080,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1369.008,1373.562,Does that mean the vestige can never be eliminated or that it's not a vestige?
1990.89-1080,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1373.562,1375.096,I believe the latter.
1990.89-1080,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1406.633,1414.389,"Mr. Starr, what did the busing in the period 1972-1988 accomplish?"
1990.89-1080,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1414.389,1425.245,It certainly accomplished the dismantling of a school assignment or student assignment plan that was infected with invidious racial discrimination.
1990.89-1080,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1442.441,1448.544,"And yet, we have 11 schools that will become black again, and they're the same schools that were black before."
1990.89-1080,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1454.781,1457.4,"--Well, I think it worked in the sense of dismantlement."
1990.89-1080,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1528.246,1530.781,"Of course, it's still doing that here, isn't it?"
1990.89-1080,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1550.845,1551.662,That is true.
1990.89-1080,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1551.662,1554.147,"Is that... is that unlawful, in your view?"
1990.89-1080,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1554.147,1555.114,It is not.
1990.89-1080,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1555.114,1556.666,"Well, then what you just said is wrong."
1990.89-1080,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1556.666,1559.118,"No, I don't think so, with all due respect."
1990.89-1080,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1585.968,1603.413,"General... General Starr, do I understand you correctly that in Oklahoma City the dismantling was done by putting it on residence rather than race but the poor Afro-American kids were still in the same school?"
1990.89-1080,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1603.413,1604.047,--Justice Marshall--
1990.89-1080,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1604.047,1608.115,The dismantling was in changing the reason?
1990.89-1080,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1609.383,1613.935,"--It's not, and if I failed to be clear I do want to be clear on this point."
1990.89-1080,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1632.416,1634.816,Does school stay the same?
1990.89-1080,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1637.634,1639.836,--Not by virtue of State action.
1990.89-1080,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1639.836,1643.188,But does it still remain a segregated school?
1990.89-1080,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1643.188,1646.49,"By virtue of residential segregation, it does."
1990.89-1080,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1646.49,1652.56,"Then it's a still a segregated school, and you don't think segregation is unconstitutional?"
1990.89-1080,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1652.56,1657.114,"With all respect, Justice Marshall, that is emphatically not our position."
1990.89-1080,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1668.589,1669.789,"Thank you, General Starr."
1990.89-1080,2,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,1676.945,1680.313,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.89-1080,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1702.476,1709.999,"In saying that that's the issue, you're using the word segregate in an unusual sense."
1990.89-1080,2,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,1717.736,1718.605,No.
1990.89-1080,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1773.239,1776.274,"Was that testimony accredited, believed by the district court?"
1990.89-1080,2,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,1777.726,1789.451,"Well, I'm not sure, Your Honor, but there's no way... there's nothing else that would support a court finding that the majority-minority transfer provision will correct the segregation of the schools in... in this residential district."
1990.89-1080,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1789.451,1794.17,"But you don't know whether the district court believed or disbelieved, though, the witness you referred to?"
1990.89-1080,2,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,1794.17,1803.628,"Oh, Your Honor, I think that in the record there's no finding by the court one way or the other in terms of... of whether this provision would correct the past discrimination."
1990.89-1080,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1826.124,1832.695,"Of course, the main reason it might not solve the problem is that the parents would rather have their children go to the neighborhood school--"
1990.89-1080,2,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,1832.695,1833.147,Your Honor--
1990.89-1080,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1833.147,1839.467,"--which they participate in, and which they can watch and which they can have some voice in running."
1990.89-1080,2,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,1839.467,1851.024,"--We think Swann demands where we have a segregated school system like we have in Oklahoma City, that the board take steps affirmatively to desegregate those schools."
1990.89-1080,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1864.999,1877.842,"Once again, you're using segregated to mean the schools that... that happen to have a majority or almost a totality of one race but in which anyone who is in the neighborhood of any race can go, and you call that a segregated school."
1990.89-1080,2,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,1877.842,1883.33,"--Yes, Your Honor, because we have the segregated community that the State helped to create."
1990.89-1080,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1883.33,1884.796,"Well, is it a segregated community?"
1990.89-1080,2,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,1887.212,1892.883,"Your Honor, we have testimony on record that no one expects whites to move into this district."
1990.89-1080,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1892.883,1900.221,"Well, that does not mean that it's... I thought segregated meant that... you know, segregated means you couldn't move there unless you were... unless you were white."
1990.89-1080,2,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,1900.221,1901.171,Segregated meant that--
1990.89-1080,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1901.171,1902.757,You couldn't use that room unless you were white.
1990.89-1080,2,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,1904.173,1921.735,"--Your Honor, segregated means that the board is pursuing practices which perpetuate racially segregated schools, and that's what we have here in Oklahoma City, and that's what... you cannot find these schools not segregated if you apply Swann, if you apply Green."
1990.89-1080,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1921.735,1925.504,"Well, what definition do you use of segregated, Mr. Chambers?"
1990.89-1080,2,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,1925.504,1931.258,Schools that have been created with a racial identity through practices of a State.
1990.89-1080,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1931.258,1946.267,"And so you... you say that a school today in Oklahoma City if it has majority black students at it, what else does it need to be segregated under your definition?"
1990.89-1080,2,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,1946.267,1956.558,"Well, if the past practices of the board created, perpetuated that racial identity, that is, in my definition, a segregated school."
1990.89-1080,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1956.558,1961.11,"Well, sir, assume there's no doubt that the schools were segregated by law at one time."
1990.89-1080,2,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,1961.11,1965.831,"That's correct, and there's no doubt that they... that segregation was perpetuated by practices of the board."
1990.89-1080,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1965.831,1976.888,"Well, so even though there are no racial restrictions on the attendance at schools in Oklahoma City, you say it's segregated because, what, because there are a majority of black students attending now?"
1990.89-1080,2,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,1976.888,1992.731,I'm saying it's segregated because the vestiges of the past practices of the board continue to be active today so that the board's practices in drafting a student assignment plan on that residential area perpetuates the racial identity of the schools.
1990.89-1080,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1992.731,1994.017,Are you free to argue that?
1990.89-1080,2,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,1998.552,2000.004,"Your Honor, I would like to address that."
1990.89-1080,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2000.004,2001.654,And that's... and that's res judicata.
1990.89-1080,2,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,2002.554,2004.873,"Well, I'd like to address both of those issues."
1990.89-1080,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2121.366,2130.989,"Didn't the district court make a finding, though, on whether the school district was responsible for the residential segregation?"
1990.89-1080,2,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,2130.989,2131.989,"--Yes, it did, Your Honor."
1990.89-1080,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2155.554,2157.539,What was its later finding?
1990.89-1080,2,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,2157.539,2162.693,--It said it found that the board had not contributed to that residential segregation.
1990.89-1080,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2162.693,2173.966,"But it's your position that by adopting the neighborhood assignment plan this really reinstates matters to where it was, say, in 1966 before?"
1990.89-1080,2,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,2173.966,2175.484,"That's correct in this district, Your Honor."
1990.89-1080,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2175.484,2187.641,And then it follows that busing over all these years has done almost nothing to eliminate the causes and the effects of segregation?
1990.89-1080,2,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,2187.641,2188.927,I think it has.
1990.89-1080,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2191.193,2198.283,"Well, if the neighborhood pattern is just the same and if your goal is to affect the neighborhood pattern, then what's busing accomplished?"
1990.89-1080,2,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,2198.283,2210.507,"--Your Honor, the injunction was designed to... to require the board to address those practices that cause and perpetuated a residential... racially segregated system."
1990.89-1080,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2210.507,2211.324,I understand.
1990.89-1080,2,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,2211.324,2214.959,And that's all the order at that stage can do.
1990.89-1080,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2237.008,2258.905,"Well, if 100 years from now in Oklahoma City there are still some residential patterns that have... show predominantly black neighborhoods and predominantly white neighborhoods, does this order have to remain in effect all that time and on into the next centuries?"
1990.89-1080,2,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,2258.905,2274.431,"Your Honor, we think the order should remain and must remain in force until all vestiges have been eliminated, which would cause resegregation even through use of a racially neutral attendance plan."
1990.89-1080,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2275.433,2276.133,xxx.
1990.89-1080,2,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,2276.133,2283.472,"--Well, yes, but it depends on the extent to which segregation would be reinstated by that residential segregation."
1990.89-1080,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2295.078,2305.683,"What do you... I don't understand your answer to Justice Kennedy's point that if... if a quarter century of busing hasn't... hasn't made a dent in that, what reason is there to believe that the next quarter century is... is... is going to make a dent in it?"
1990.89-1080,2,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,2305.683,2306.266,"Well, Your Honor--"
1990.89-1080,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2306.266,2312.337,"And if there's no reason to believe, why is it justifiable as a... as a... as an injunction from the Court?"
1990.89-1080,2,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,2312.337,2313.455,--Why is the injunction justified?
1990.89-1080,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2313.455,2313.839,Yeah.
1990.89-1080,2,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,2321.193,2322.978,I didn't say it had produced nothing.
1990.89-1080,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2328.049,2332.751,"--While it's in effect, but as soon as it's gone you say the vestige returns."
1990.89-1080,2,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,2333.953,2335.036,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1990.89-1080,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2335.036,2337.821,"Well, then it is not useful in eliminating the vestige."
1990.89-1080,2,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,2337.821,2344.741,"It's certainly useful in integrating the schools, and that's what we're about in Brown and the cases that follow Brown."
1990.89-1080,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2360.436,2367.507,"You do not regard this, then, as a transitional remedy, which is what it was originally described at when it was adopted."
1990.89-1080,2,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,2377.396,2383.284,"--Your Honor, I think the plan is designed to correct a constitutional violation."
1990.89-1080,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2399.745,2406.632,Or adopt other remedies that... that won't require perpetual supervision of democratic processes by courts.
1990.89-1080,2,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,2409.167,2419.975,"Your Honor, if... well, I think busing was envisaged because the court felt it was necessary to use that remedy to correct this intransigent segregation of schools."
1990.89-1080,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2431.116,2437.286,"Mr. Chambers, you referred to the Swift case, and, of course, the court of appeals relied heavily on that."
1990.89-1080,2,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,2454.296,2455.148,"Yes, Your Honor."
1990.89-1080,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2462.486,2478.697,"You don't think there should be any difference in... because of the fact that there is presumably a preference for local regulation of education, other things being equal, whereas I don't know there's any preference for meat packers."
1990.89-1080,2,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,2478.697,2490.905,"Your Honor, I think that when the court, as this Court has directed, the district court begins to design a remedy, it takes into consideration that it's ordering a local public school district to do something."
1990.89-1080,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2505.247,2514.853,"Well, do you... do you think Swift is consistent with the idea that when the violation has been cured it goes back to local control?"
1990.89-1080,2,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,2514.853,2516.12,"Yes, sir."
1990.89-1080,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2528.446,2534.35,"What did you mean... I... what did you mean by your statement in your brief that... it says,"
1990.89-1080,2,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,2559.049,2559.382,Okay.
1990.89-1080,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2566.369,2568.238,"Well, you say that it had achieved."
1990.89-1080,2,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,2568.238,2571.607,"Well, it had achieved as long as they were operating with the Finger Plan."
1990.89-1080,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2571.607,2576.944,"Well, obviously it had effectively and permanently achieved full integration and that it had made the system unitary."
1990.89-1080,2,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,2576.944,2577.511,We were--
1990.89-1080,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2577.511,2578.796,What did you mean by unitary?
1990.89-1080,2,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,2578.796,2590.77,"--There, we were talking about unitary in the sense that with that plan in effect, it integrated the schools and removed the vestiges of the past which would, though--"
1990.89-1080,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2590.77,2591.27,So you say--
1990.89-1080,2,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,2591.27,2592.336,"--Except for housing, Your Honor."
1990.89-1080,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2592.336,2602.494,"--You do... you do agree, then, that the plan had made the system unitary but that you just can't abandon it if it means going back to black schools?"
1990.89-1080,2,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,2602.494,2607.982,"Your Honor, it doesn't mean that it was unitary in a sense that all vestiges of past discrimination have been eliminated."
1990.89-1080,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2607.982,2608.615,"Well, you said it was unitary."
1990.89-1080,2,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,2608.615,2616.486,I was using that in the sense that the plan was countering the... the continuing effects of the past.
1990.89-1080,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2618.004,2627.11,"By the way, what... what had happened during the life of the Finger Plan residentially?"
1990.89-1080,2,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,2630.061,2630.961,"--There had, Your Honor."
1990.89-1080,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2637.751,2638.451,And--
1990.89-1080,2,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,2638.451,2638.984,But--
1990.89-1080,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2638.984,2641.536,"--And had whites been moving, also?"
1990.89-1080,2,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,2641.536,2645.655,"--Whites had been moving, had been moving to areas in the city and to the suburban areas--"
1990.89-1080,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2645.655,2659.581,"Well, did you feel at the time that in 1988, 1987-1988, do you think that the Finger Plan was still an effective instrument to achieve your end?"
1990.89-1080,2,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,2661.617,2662.067,--We did.
1990.89-1080,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2663.533,2665.152,Why did... why did you want it modified?
1990.89-1080,2,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,2665.152,2665.919,There are two reasons.
1990.89-1080,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2665.919,2666.652,What had happened?
1990.89-1080,2,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,2666.652,2667.603,Okay.
1990.89-1080,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2729.511,2746.604,"So basically, you think that the district court in a situation like that should modify its desegregation plan in order to keep up with demographic movements that might result in blacker schools or whiter schools?"
1990.89-1080,2,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,2746.604,2746.956,--No.
1990.89-1080,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2779.86,2792.917,"Mr. Chambers, would it make any difference in your view if the transfer provisions were fully adequate so that any pupil wanting to get out of a school could do so?"
1990.89-1080,2,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,2794.136,2797.321,"Your Honor, it would not solve the problem."
1990.89-1080,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2799.987,2807.677,"In other words, you think there must be forced busing for students who do not want to be bused?"
1990.89-1080,2,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,2807.677,2820.334,"--I think there must be some pairing and clustering with the schools, with transportation provided if that is necessary, in order to accommodate desegregation or the maintenance of desegregation of these elementary schools."
1990.89-1080,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2912.16,2920.183,Was the board's determination of parental involvement based on the fact that the parental involvement would be much more likely if there were neighborhood schools?
1990.89-1080,2,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,2920.183,2927.206,"The board said that, and, Your Honor, in fact there was a finding of the district court that that had helped to promote parental involvement."
1990.89-1080,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2927.572,2934.943,"So then your last summary was not quite consistent with the finding of facts by the district court in that one respect, it seems to me, counsel."
1990.89-1080,2,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,2934.943,2942.965,"--Well, Justice Kennedy, the problem is I'm saying that these things could have been done; that is, you could have promoted parental involvement with desegregated schools."
1990.89-1080,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2953.321,2955.273,Can I ask you to help me out?
1990.89-1080,2,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,2969.533,2970.583,Yes.
1990.89-1080,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2971.485,2984.042,"Well, are there cities in the country where there are predominantly black schools and white schools where you could not successfully claim that it's... that it's the result of State action?"
1990.89-1080,2,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,2984.042,2987.91,"--Well, I... you know, Your Honor, there may be."
1990.89-1080,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3007.824,3012.71,But you say... you say Oklahoma City should not be treated like one of those cities?
1990.89-1080,2,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,3012.71,3015.445,"--Your Honor, it's clear... no, it should not."
1990.89-1080,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3019.482,3035.658,"Well, the argument is, of course, that... is that official segregation is a thing of the past and this has achieved unitary status, and Oklahoma City ought to be... ought to be treated with a city with de facto segregation."
1990.89-1080,2,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,3035.658,3048.318,"Your Honor, I submit that there are vestiges of segregation still remaining in Oklahoma City which bars the Court from considering Oklahoma like this de facto situation we're talking about."
1990.89-1080,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3093.447,3094.247,"Well, not really."
1990.89-1080,2,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,3100.934,3101.786,--That's correct.
1990.89-1080,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3101.786,3106.654,"Well, that was the practice before, and that isn't there anymore."
1990.89-1080,2,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,3106.654,3108.023,"That is not there, and there's also--"
1990.89-1080,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3108.023,3109.556,"Well, there a lot of other--"
1990.89-1080,2,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,3109.556,3110.725,"--I'm sorry, Your Honor."
1990.89-1080,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3110.725,3114.093,--You say that they're still back to their... up to their same old tricks.
1990.89-1080,2,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,3115.843,3118.995,"Well, Your Honor, there have been changes in teachers' assignments."
1990.89-1080,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3137.209,3151.635,"But you're operating in an environment in which any family, assuming the economic ability, can move to any district in the city and go to any neighborhood school that it wants, and that is different."
1990.89-1080,2,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,3151.635,3154.302,"Your Honor, that is a change--"
1990.89-1080,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3154.302,3157.872,"And that assumes the ability to change, which is a difficult problem."
1990.89-1080,2,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,3157.872,3158.739,--Yeah.
1990.89-1080,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3162.008,3175.834,"And also the transfer policy, so that any student in a racially segregated residential area can transfer out on request."
1990.89-1080,2,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,3178.203,3180.103,It would be some difference.
1990.89-1080,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3200.949,3205.203,Just continue to note my objection to the use of the word segregated in that context.
1990.89-1080,2,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,3221.63,3224.249,"If the person lives in the neighborhood, then one can go to that school."
1990.89-1080,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3233.854,3235.472,"Mr. Chambers, can I ask you one question?"
1990.89-1080,2,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,3249.882,3251.382,"No, Your Honor."
1990.89-1080,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3251.382,3259.322,"What do you... what do you say in response to your opponent's argument that the judge's understanding, the parties' understanding was that the decree would no longer be in effect?"
1990.89-1080,2,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,3259.322,3265.309,"Your Honor, we... we'd point out that... that first the board didn't ask for a dissolution of the injunction."
1990.89-1080,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3323.097,3324.63,What about in '85 and '87?
1990.89-1080,2,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,3324.63,3326.299,"--We have appealed that, Your Honor."
1990.89-1080,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3334.37,3335.488,What finding?
1990.89-1080,2,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,3336.238,3340.024,The unitariness findings.
1990.89-1080,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3345.861,3346.462,--What do you think?
1990.89-1080,2,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,3351.847,3354.283,"--Did it address the unitary... it did, Your Honor."
1990.89-1080,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3354.283,3355.235,What did it hold?
1990.89-1080,2,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,3355.235,3358.537,"It held that the court, the district court was clearly erroneous--"
1990.89-1080,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3358.537,3360.52,On the unitary... on the unitariness?
1990.89-1080,2,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,3360.52,3364.191,--Yes.
1990.89-1080,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3364.191,3366.091,"Well, I find it very fuzzy in that respect."
1990.89-1080,2,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,3366.091,3366.691,I'm sorry?
1990.89-1080,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3366.691,3377.315,I... I find it very fuzzy in that respect because I thought they really said it doesn't make any difference whether it's unitary or not; the injunction remains.
1990.89-1080,2,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,3377.315,3377.815,The court--
1990.89-1080,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3377.815,3378.582,That's what it held.
1990.89-1080,2,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,3378.582,3379.784,--The court said--
1990.89-1080,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3379.784,3386.755,They applied Swift and said that unitariness just was irrelevant to their decision.
1990.89-1080,2,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,3386.755,3389.289,"--The court said basically two things, Your Honor."
1990.89-1080,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3389.289,3392.424,Do you have a page citation for what you're about to say?
1990.89-1080,2,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,3394.443,3395.31,I could furnish it later.
1990.89-1080,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3427.632,3430.199,"I think you've answered the question, Mr. Chambers."
1990.89-1080,2,29682,julius_levonne_chambers,,3430.199,3430.749,"--Thank you, Your Honor."
1990.89-1080,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3430.749,3434.937,Thank you.
1990.89-1080,3,39089,ronald_l_day,,3436.42,3442.691,"Mr. Chief Justice, unless there are questions from the Court, we're prepared to yield the remainder of our time back to the Court."
1990.89-1080,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3442.691,3444.459,I was going to ask Mr. Chambers.
1990.89-1080,3,39089,ronald_l_day,,3467.992,3486.036,"Justice Kennedy, the respondents had alternative arguments, and I believe in their first argument there was no definition, but in one of their alternative arguments they took the position that before a unitary status can be achieved that all the vestiges had to be eliminated, and in Oklahoma City that meant that all the neighborhoods had to be integrated."
1990.89-1080,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3486.036,3488.738,That was part of their unitary... the unitary definition?
1990.89-1080,3,39089,ronald_l_day,,3488.738,3491.572,Yes.
1990.89-1080,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3491.572,3492.488,"Thank you, Mr. Day."
