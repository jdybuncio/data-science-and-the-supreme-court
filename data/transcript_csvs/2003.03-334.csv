2003.03-334,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,36.495,"We'll hear argument now on 03-334, Shafiq Rasul vs. George W. Bush and a companion case."
2003.03-334,0,30576,john_j_gibbons,,11.829,15.765,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2003.03-334,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,58.65,64.1,"Mr. Gibbons, I understand that your clients have been detained approximately two years?"
2003.03-334,0,30576,john_j_gibbons,,64.1,65.214,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2003.03-334,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,65.214,70.422,"Supposing they had only been detained six months, how much would that weaken your case?"
2003.03-334,0,30576,john_j_gibbons,,70.422,85.371,"It wouldn't weaken it at all because as I'll get into in the argument, the case depends on compliance with provisions of a binding treaty, which requires a prompt determination of their status."
2003.03-334,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,85.371,93.56,"So they would have had a habeas corpus entitlement, in your view, within weeks after their, after their detention?"
2003.03-334,0,30576,john_j_gibbons,,93.56,106.387,"They would have had entitlement to the process specified in the Geneva Convention, and if they had that process--"
2003.03-334,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,106.387,109.864,Did they have that right when they were in Afghanistan?
2003.03-334,0,30576,john_j_gibbons,,109.864,115.859,"--They allege not, and on this record, you have to assume that, as did the Court of Appeals."
2003.03-334,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,115.859,124.144,"But now in Johnson vs. Eisentrager, we said that the Geneva Convention did not confer a private right of action."
2003.03-334,0,30576,john_j_gibbons,,124.144,133.158,"Your Honor, the question of the private right of action really is not presented in this case."
2003.03-334,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,152.912,167.891,"Well, I guess, at least the question presented is just whether the Federal court has jurisdiction under the Habeas Statute, Section 2241, is that right?"
2003.03-334,0,30576,john_j_gibbons,,167.891,168.718,That's correct.
2003.03-334,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,168.718,176.099,And you don't raise the issue of any potential jurisdiction on the basis of the Constitution alone.
2003.03-334,0,30576,john_j_gibbons,,181.397,184.108,"That's correct, Justice O'Connor."
2003.03-334,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,185.233,186.679,1331.
2003.03-334,0,30576,john_j_gibbons,,187.546,195.593,"--It doesn't depend on Section 1331, although the Administrative Procedure Act claim does depend on Section 1331."
2003.03-334,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,195.593,195.783,--That's what I'm asking.
2003.03-334,0,30576,john_j_gibbons,,198.275,198.913,Yes.
2003.03-334,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,198.913,200.157,"I thought you were still asserting that, are you not?"
2003.03-334,0,30576,john_j_gibbons,,200.157,200.316,Yes.
2003.03-334,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1812.572,1826.915,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2003.03-334,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1870.18,1876.744,"Mr. Olson, supposing the war had ended, could you continue to detain these people on Guantanamo?"
2003.03-334,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1878.428,1881.009,"--We believe that there would not be jurisdiction, just--"
2003.03-334,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1881.009,1883.967,So the existence of the war is really irrelevant to the legal issue?
2003.03-334,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1883.967,1902.364,"--It is not irrelevant, because it is in this context that that question is raised, and I would... the question, the case of Johnson vs. Eisentrager, which we have discussed here, even the dissent in that case said that it would be fantastic to assume that habeas corpus jurisdiction would exist in the time of war."
2003.03-334,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1904.467,1908.001,"No, but your position does not depend on the existence of a war?"
2003.03-334,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1908.001,1911.846,"--It doesn't depend upon that, Justice Stevens, but it's even more forceful."
2003.03-334,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1920.69,1926.466,"What if one of the Plaintiffs were an American citizen here, being held in Guantanamo."
2003.03-334,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1926.466,1927.065,We have not--
2003.03-334,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1927.065,1928.998,Jurisdiction under Habeas Statute?
2003.03-334,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1928.998,1930.154,--We would acknowledge jurisdiction.
2003.03-334,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1930.812,1931.091,Excuse me.
2003.03-334,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1931.091,1934.298,--We would acknowledge that there would be jurisdiction--
2003.03-334,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1934.298,1934.767,Why?
2003.03-334,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1934.767,1946.213,"--under the Habeas Corpus Statute for the reasons that are explained in Eisentrager itself, that citizenship is a foundation for a relationship between the nation and the individual and a foundation for--"
2003.03-334,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1946.213,1951.115,"Is that sufficient to give us jurisdiction over Guantanamo, which is another sovereign?"
2003.03-334,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1951.115,1952.917,--With respect to the individual.
2003.03-334,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1954.263,1958.008,What if the American citizen was in the middle of the battlefield in Iraq?
2003.03-334,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1958.008,1980.209,"--We would still argue that the jurisdiction under the Habeas Statute would not extend under these circumstances to a wartime situation, Justice Stevens, but that the... what the Eisentrager Court said, that there is enhanced respect with respect to the power of the Court under the habeas corpus jurisdiction with respect to questions involving citizenship."
2003.03-334,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1998.217,2000.38,"Well, it's clear that there was no relief."
2003.03-334,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2025.737,2032.778,"Our response to that is throughout the decision in Eisentrager, the Court referred to the question of jurisdiction."
2003.03-334,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2032.778,2033.207,"Oh, it did."
2003.03-334,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2033.207,2033.425,It starts--
2003.03-334,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2033.425,2038.247,"I'm really not asking a question about, frankly, about the Court's terminology."
2003.03-334,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2039.722,2040.111,--The holding--
2003.03-334,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2040.111,2046.067,The mere argument is you can't say it held anything more than that there was no relief at the end of the road.
2003.03-334,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2046.067,2054.376,"--It held that there was no relief at the end of the road, because the ultimate question, to use the words of the Court, the ultimate question is jurisdiction."
2003.03-334,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2061.145,2078.358,"General Olson, would you look at page 777 of the Johnson v. Eisentrager opinion, and it says... this is a hard opinion to fathom, but it does say we are here confronted with, and there is a whole list of things."
2003.03-334,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2112.162,2135.26,"Well, those were unquestionably facts that related to the case, that related to the facts that came to the Court, but in the very next paragraph, the Court goes on to say that we have pointed out that the privilege of litigation has been extended to aliens whether friendly or enemy, that specifically addresses one of the points you mentioned, only because permitting their presence in the country implied protection."
2003.03-334,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2156.913,2158.558,Their trial and their punishment.
2003.03-334,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2171.045,2180.418,--It seems to me... it seems to me that those statements all have to be read in the context... context of the Court saying the ultimate question is jurisdiction.
2003.03-334,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2180.418,2186.672,"But it was so unnecessary to say, to give that list that appears on page 777."
2003.03-334,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2186.672,2211.532,"Well, I suspect that there are many decisions of this Court where, when the Court is dealing with the facts of a specific case, especially in the context of a Court of Appeals decision, if the Court were to turn to the briefs that were written before to present the issue in this Court, the only... the question presented, submitted in this case, in this Court, in Eisentrager was the jurisdiction under the Habeas Statute."
2003.03-334,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2214.57,2217.46,Was it really... was it really under the Habeas Statute or under the Constitution?
2003.03-334,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2217.46,2217.798,--It was--
2003.03-334,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2217.798,2230.894,"Because if the, if the views of the dissenters in Ahrens against Clark were the law at that time as they perhaps are now, then there would have been statutory jurisdiction, which was not present at that time."
2003.03-334,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2230.894,2238.705,--But the Court was specifically focusing on the jurisdictional incidents attached to the condition of the individual--
2003.03-334,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2238.705,2245.655,"But the Eisentrager Court never once mentioned the statute, the Habeas Statute in its opinion."
2003.03-334,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2253.066,2262.678,"--The Court specifically did say, but did not mention the statute, Justice O'Connor, but the statute is mentioned throughout the briefs, in the government's brief when it says what... the statute at issue, the Habeas Corpus Statute and within its territory, the language of Part A."
2003.03-334,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2283.892,2302.358,"Well, the briefs may have mentioned it, but wasn't the problem that Eisentrager had to confront, the problem created by Ahrens, construing respective jurisdiction, and therefore, the only way there could be habeas jurisdiction in Eisentrager was if due process demanded it."
2003.03-334,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2325.745,2330.168,"Well, it seems to me again the entire opinion has to be taken in context."
2003.03-334,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2341.834,2344.393,The reason it said that was because Ahrens was then the law.
2003.03-334,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2344.393,2344.622,Yeah.
2003.03-334,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2344.622,2347.49,And that was very clear in the Court of Appeals opinion.
2003.03-334,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2349.981,2359.293,"Well, Justice Stevens, I submit that in the context of the case, in the context of the way the dissent understood it, as well as the majority understood it--"
2003.03-334,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2359.293,2364.693,"Yes, but the fact case was... the case was decided when the majority view in Ahrens was the law, and that is no longer the law."
2003.03-334,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2364.693,2370.17,"--Well, we would submit that Ahrens, the over... partial overruling, I think, has been pointed out before."
2003.03-334,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2410.481,2416.018,The context of the case was it was decided at a time when Ahrens against Clark was the law.
2003.03-334,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2421.595,2430.121,"--Well, it seems to me that a fair reading of the case goes much further than that, because the Court was not focusing on that."
2003.03-334,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2448.045,2452.188,And that's a complete response to an argument resting entirely on the Constitution.
2003.03-334,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2452.188,2454.628,Did it cite Ahrens?
2003.03-334,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2454.628,2457.287,"--It did not, as I'm--"
2003.03-334,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2457.287,2458.58,I don't recall.
2003.03-334,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2458.58,2459.627,--I don't recall that it did.
2003.03-334,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2460.684,2463.921,Kind of extraordinary if it was relying entirely on that--
2003.03-334,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2463.921,2465.533,--The District Court relied upon that decision.
2003.03-334,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2484.587,2491.081,"--Well, didn't the Johnson opinion also say, we don't have to concern ourselves here with the proper custodian."
2003.03-334,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2492.954,2495.006,I believe that's a correct characterization.
2003.03-334,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2521.023,2532.766,"That gets me back to your statement that if this had been a citizen held in Guantanamo, that habeas would be available."
2003.03-334,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2556.4,2581.43,"I think, Justice Kennedy, the answer to that is, in the first place, we are not, we are not saying that there necessarily would be jurisdiction there, but we are saying that the Court... that the Court would go further with respect to that because, and this is also in Eisentrager and a number of other Court's... of this Court's decisions, that the Court will find more protection for citizens as a result of the relationship going back--"
2003.03-334,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2581.43,2583.301,"Well, but the only way we can do it--"
2003.03-334,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2596.031,2604.436,"--We are not... we are saying that we would not be contesting it, Justice Kennedy, and the Court will be dealing with other issues involving citizens."
2003.03-334,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2604.436,2606.131,You don't have to contest the jurisdictional objection.
2003.03-334,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2609.757,2623.493,"Well, I guess the only way I can answer this, Justice Stevens, is to say that what the Court seemed to say, not only in the majority opinion, but in the dissenting opinion, that more rights would be given to citizens--"
2003.03-334,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2623.493,2627.903,"No, but there are no rights that can be recognized unless there is jurisdiction in the first place."
2003.03-334,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2640.561,2641.31,--I don't--
2003.03-334,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2641.31,2642.555,With respect to the citizen?
2003.03-334,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2648.759,2654.685,--I think that the answer is that that does not necessarily follow.
2003.03-334,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2659.635,2665.383,"Certainly the argument is available that in that situation, the Constitution requires jurisdiction."
2003.03-334,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2678.322,2682.017,"I agree with that, justice Scalia, and this Court has said again and again that--"
2003.03-334,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2682.017,2684.447,And that was part of his argument in Eisentrager.
2003.03-334,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2684.447,2691.51,"--And it was... and in that case, the Court specifically said the Fifth Amendment did not extend to the Petitioners in that case."
2003.03-334,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2695.883,2709.1,"Is that your answer to Justice Kennedy, that there would be jurisdiction because due process would require it for citizens, but there would not be statutory jurisdiction in the case of the citizen at Guantanamo?"
2003.03-334,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2709.1,2710.277,I think it would be an interpretation.
2003.03-334,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2716.282,2721.703,"Well, but what is the position... I mean, I want to know what the position of the United States is for the same reason Justice Kennedy does."
2003.03-334,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2721.703,2735.975,"--Our answer to that question, Justice Souter, is that citizens of the United States, because of their constitutional circumstances, may have greater rights with respect to the scope and reach of the Habeas Statute as the Court has or would interpret it."
2003.03-334,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2740.108,2744.202,You go outside of the statutory language for your case that's in front of us.
2003.03-334,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2744.202,2746.174,"--Excuse me, Justice--"
2003.03-334,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2746.174,2751.912,You are going outside of the statutory language to resolve both the hypothetical case and the case in front of us.
2003.03-334,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2757.083,2773.197,--And this Court construed those provisions in the Eisentrager case and determined that the statute did not reach aliens that did have no contact with the United States and were held in a foreign jurisdiction outside the sovereignty of the United States.
2003.03-334,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2773.197,2775.586,It did not construe the statute.
2003.03-334,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2781.811,2784.045,"Well, Justice Stevens, I respectfully disagree."
2003.03-334,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2791.904,2794.323,"Not a word, not a word in the opinion that supports it."
2003.03-334,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2794.323,2796.385,"Well, I respectfully disagree."
2003.03-334,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2809.612,2823.007,"Well, it's obvious that there is language in Eisentrager that supports you, obvious to me, but you have just heard that judges don't always distinguish between 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6), not even in this Court, at least we don't always get it right."
2003.03-334,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2910.745,2913.123,"--Well, Justice Breyer, there are several answers to that."
2003.03-334,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2945.209,2947.947,"It could have been just a clarifying, General Olson."
2003.03-334,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2958.176,2962.787,"Well, I understand that, but the bill was... came eight months after Eisentrager."
2003.03-334,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2962.787,2967.548,You're not using it to say what the law was.
2003.03-334,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2981.016,2982.761,That's precisely correct.
2003.03-334,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3013.001,3014.156,I grant you this.
2003.03-334,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3055.344,3057.445,"--Well, let me get back to it again."
2003.03-334,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3070.313,3074.996,Can we hold hearings to determine the problems that are bothering you?
2003.03-334,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3089.122,3089.989,--Congress could do all that--
2003.03-334,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3089.989,3094.598,"If it wanted to change the Habeas Statute, it could make all sorts of refined modifications."
2003.03-334,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3094.598,3095.565,"--Yes, it could--"
2003.03-334,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3095.565,3099.929,"About issues that we know nothing whatever about, because we have only lawyers before us."
2003.03-334,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3115.687,3127.272,"--Well, we would agree with that and we would emphasize the point that stepping across that line would be impossible to go back from with respect to prisoners in the battlefield."
2003.03-334,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3137.533,3151.098,"The battlefield, I might, since... all I mean by working out the substantive rights is what Justice Harlan meant and what Justice Kennedy meant in adopting Justice Harlan's view in Verdugo."
2003.03-334,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3160.85,3186.019,"--Well, to the extent that the Court would say, the executive, you must give a military process because the Petitioners in this case, first of all, demanded in their petition and they would have a right to raise these issues to the extent they have not backed off in this case, but they demanded in their petition, their release, unmonitored communications with counsel, cessation of interrogations, evidentiary hearings."
2003.03-334,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3186.019,3186.208,Wasn't it--
2003.03-334,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3186.208,3194.026,"--Our, our doctrine would have to be applied in the first instance by 800 different district judges, I take it."
2003.03-334,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3194.026,3197.304,"Well, there is no question that that is exactly right."
2003.03-334,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3210.495,3216.619,"General Olson, I have looked at the reply brief, which is the last chance to say what they mean."
2003.03-334,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3243.848,3251.019,"But Justice Ginsburg, the relief that I was articulating is what they asked for in the first instance."
2003.03-334,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3263.777,3267.852,"If you go back to the jurisdiction, so I understand really what your argument is."
2003.03-334,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3281.675,3283.2,"--Yes, we would."
2003.03-334,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3293.709,3295.533,"Why is that, why is that crucial?"
2003.03-334,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3304.567,3310.632,"--It is, it is the line that this Court drew and repeatedly articulated--"
2003.03-334,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3310.632,3311.239,But why is it a good line?
2003.03-334,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3313.062,3319.806,"--Because it is a line that is, is... has the virtue of what Justice Breyer was talking about, of having relative certainty."
2003.03-334,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3323.282,3325.664,Why does it have complete jurisdiction?
2003.03-334,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3330.952,3339.42,"Well, the complete jurisdiction is a phrase in that lease, the lease specifically says that ultimate sovereignty is Cuba's."
2003.03-334,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3341.654,3347.36,How many years have we been operating in Guantanamo with Cuban law never applying?
2003.03-334,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3347.36,3356.224,--With respect... the lease restricts the ability of the United States to use that property for only Naval or coaling purposes.
2003.03-334,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3359.292,3365.448,"General Olson, there is a whole other issue in this case which you have not addressed and I don't think your brief much addressed it."
2003.03-334,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3376.594,3390.291,"What is cited in the brief, and we explain that the President is not an agency under the APA, that the United States military with respect to operations and military operations are specifically exempted by the APA."
2003.03-334,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3390.291,3390.868,That goes to the merits.
2003.03-334,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3390.868,3403.886,"And that the fundamental nature of what the Petitioners are seeking here is the review of the nature and status of their detention, which sounds in... and is examined by this Court repeatedly under the doctrine of habeas corpus."
2003.03-334,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3436.018,3442.194,"I think Guantanamo, everyone agrees, is an animal, there is no other like it."
2003.03-334,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3444.357,3447.285,--The Canal Zone was treated differently by Congress.
2003.03-334,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3461.427,3467.683,"Why isn't this like, as I asked Mr. Gibbons, a Federal enclave within a State?"
2003.03-334,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3467.683,3474.894,"Because it is... because it is a... in the first place, the question of sovereignty is a political decision."
2003.03-334,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3482.406,3484.745,"The word is physical control, power."
2003.03-334,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3484.745,3497.762,"--We have that, Justice Ginsburg, in every place where we would put military detainees, in a field of combat where there are prisons in Afghanistan where we have complete control with respect to the circumstances."
2003.03-334,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3497.762,3508.846,"But those... Afghanistan is not a place where American law is, and for a century, has customarily been applied to all aspects of life."
2003.03-334,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3543.66,3557.782,"The Court actually heard a case, Neely vs. Henkel, in 1901, which specifically addressed that, and held that the United States did not have sovereignty for the enforcement of its laws in Guantanamo."
2003.03-334,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3559.533,3561.536,"We've been doing a pretty good job of it since then, am I right?"
2003.03-334,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3561.536,3570.798,"--With respect to a certain area, a military base in Germany, a military base in Afghanistan, the United States must have and does exercise relatively complete control."
2003.03-334,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3590.072,3609.95,Are you saying that there is no statutory regime that applies to Guantanamo which is different from the statutory or legal regime that applied to occupied territories after World War II or indeed that applies to territory under the control of the American military in Afghanistan or Iraq?
2003.03-334,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3609.95,3616.923,--There is a great deal of differences in connection with every area over which the United States has some degree of control.
2003.03-334,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3624.016,3625.232,"Thank you, General Olson."
