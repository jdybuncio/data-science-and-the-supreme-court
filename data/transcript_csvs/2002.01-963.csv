2002.01-963,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,11.024,"We'll hear argument now in Number 91... or rather, 01-963, Norfolk & Western Railway Company versus Freeman Ayers."
2002.01-963,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,12.139,14.944,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2002.01-963,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,72.591,73.956,How do we know that?
2002.01-963,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,97.277,99.756,"--Well, there is a legal answer and there is a factual answer."
2002.01-963,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,108.301,112.388,"Well, but that, the fact that it's one element doesn't mean it's the primary element, does it?"
2002.01-963,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,118.332,122.585,"They all suffered asbestosis, and they all suffered some physical elements of it."
2002.01-963,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,122.585,128.446,And how do you know that the physical impairment was not the primary ingredient in the jury verdict.
2002.01-963,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,128.901,132.09,"I don't know that it's not the primary ingredient, Justice Stevens."
2002.01-963,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,143.486,149.225,"Yes, but you said it was the primary element of damages, and that's what I think Justice Breyer and I are wondering whether the record really supports that element--"
2002.01-963,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,149.225,160.083,"--Well, I think the record supports it in the sense that we know that these are asbestosis claims that even the respondents' expert testified were mild, for the most part."
2002.01-963,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,170.569,170.978,--Did the defendant--
2002.01-963,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,170.978,174.943,--particularly where there's no cost of medical care as part of the component.
2002.01-963,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,174.943,185.057,"--Mr. Phillips, did the defendant attempt to test this by seeking a special verdict so that the damages could be broken down by the jury?"
2002.01-963,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,188.439,192.033,"No, the defendants didn't... the defendant did not ask for that."
2002.01-963,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,192.033,192.526,But it could have--
2002.01-963,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,192.526,198.432,"What the defendant did ask for, Justice Ginsburg, was to have fear-of damages eliminated as a component of the case in a case like this--"
2002.01-963,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,198.432,209.987,"--But they could have... if they tested this, isolated this, and then we'd know how much was actually allocated, whether it was as he initially said the primary, or whether it was a lesser thing."
2002.01-963,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,210.813,212.467,"--Oh, and that's because it's the plaintiff's burden."
2002.01-963,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,1095.293,1110.359,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2002.01-963,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1130.959,1131.042,May I ask in that--
2002.01-963,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,1131.042,1132.074,--and give rise to separate--
2002.01-963,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1132.074,1133.354,--May I ask this question?
2002.01-963,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,1152.236,1156.472,"--Your Honor, I do think there would be a difference between those two instances."
2002.01-963,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1170.923,1171.295,So you would say--
2002.01-963,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,1171.295,1171.478,--to asbestos.
2002.01-963,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1171.478,1181.697,"--So you would say that in this case, then, if it were true, which I understand it is not, that the asbestosis itself is a contributing cause to cancer, that then there would be liability?"
2002.01-963,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,1181.697,1193.752,"Well, Your Honor, I think that... you know... the Court may still need to look at what type... what exactly the causal connection is... and it would still need to take into account both the text and the purposes of FELA, and... and in particular, the concern--"
2002.01-963,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1193.752,1203.04,"But taking all those things into account, what do you do in a case in which the cancer is a result of the asbestosis rather than the result of a common source?"
2002.01-963,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,1203.04,1218.067,"--I... I do think, Your Honor, that if... that if the cancer, in fact, results directly from the disease of asbestosis, then that puts you more directly in the category of pain and suffering damages that would be available traditionally in tort law, and that probably would be recoverable there, but--"
2002.01-963,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1218.067,1219.348,Why-- --Isn't that a jury question?
2002.01-963,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,1223.313,1247.562,"--I do think, Your Honor, that this Court can look to the experience of courts that have considered the relationship between the two diseases, and have adopted legal rules to govern the disposition of these claims, and have concluded that they are separate diseases that result in separate injuries and give rise to separate causes of action, and I think this Court can look to that and... and... and can conclude that as a matter of law both because of--"
2002.01-963,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1247.562,1251.548,Do the respondents agree with you on that factual point?
2002.01-963,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,1251.548,1253.406,--That the majority of courts have concluded--
2002.01-963,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1253.406,1264.346,"No... no, that... that asbestosis does not lead to cancer, but rather, is... is produced by the same... by the same cause that produces cancer?"
2002.01-963,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,1264.346,1267.895,"--Your Honor, I do think that the respondents have taken that position in this case."
2002.01-963,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1312.522,1323.38,"The question I had is, if there is a causal correlation, if 50 percent of the people who have contracted asbestosis as a result of exposure to asbestos will also contract cancer, why does that matter?"
2002.01-963,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,1325.859,1326.957,I... I think--
2002.01-963,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1326.957,1331.432,Because I understand... I think you do correctly state their... they agree with you on the facts on this.
2002.01-963,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,1331.432,1332.191,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2002.01-963,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1353.989,1362.041,But both of those cases were a self-standing claim of emotional distress.
2002.01-963,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,1396.137,1399.769,"--Yes, Your Honor, that is the way the court below approached the question."
2002.01-963,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1411.286,1416.57,"But doesn't it matter what form... I'm familiar with one of those cases, and that was the question--"
2002.01-963,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,1416.57,1416.82,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2002.01-963,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1416.82,1421.937,--when does the statute of limitations start to run when you get the virulent form of cancer?
2002.01-963,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,1437.132,1469.454,"We do think it is instructive, however, Your Honor, and that's particularly true because FELA provides for liability... to any person suffering injury while employed... for such injury, and we think, consistent with the text of that statute, which limits the employer's liability to the injury that's actually suffered, and not the fear of suffering a future... injury in the future... that the rule we are propounding today is the most consistent with that text and the most consistent with the purposes and... and policy considerations this Court articulated in both Gottshall and Buckley, and in particular--"
2002.01-963,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1469.454,1492.117,"You said in your brief that it's a question of not whether, but when, because when you get cancer, if you get cancer, you get the damages for past, present, and future pain and suffering, but that's not quite right, is it, because you are leaving out the category of person who has asbestosis and never gets cancer, which will be most of these people?"
2002.01-963,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,1496.741,1503.717,"--It is true, Your Honor, that people who now have asbestosis and fear getting cancer in the future may never get cancer."
2002.01-963,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1506.029,1507.432,And then they--
2002.01-963,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,1507.432,1507.632,--But--
2002.01-963,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1507.632,1510.776,--they never... they can never collect for this alleged fear.
2002.01-963,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,1510.776,1514.863,"--That is true, Your Honor, and that's also true for the snowmen of Metro-North that were at issue in Buckley."
2002.01-963,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1543.058,1545.947,But here... here we've got something more.
2002.01-963,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,1554.271,1562.816,"--That is correct, and they can recover for all of their harms related directly to that asbestosis, but our position is they can't recover for their fears of the future disease of cancer--"
2002.01-963,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1562.816,1605.995,"I know that that's your position, but once we cross that threshold, as we have in this case... the threshold that shows that the fear is, in fact, a serious one, because at least asbestosis has now developed, why isn't their fear of cancer just as reasonable whether that fear rests upon the fact that in 10 percent of asbestosis cases, the asbestosis progresses to cancer... which isn't true... or, on the other hand, in the same percentage of asbestosis cases, cancer will also develop as a result of the common cause for which the employer is liable?"
2002.01-963,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,1609.793,1616.769,"--Your Honor, with respect, we don't think the question is whether their fears are reasonable, but their question is whether their fears are recoverable at this time."
2002.01-963,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1616.769,1625.314,"Well, I know that, and one of the questions we want to know in determining whether recovery is possible is whether the fear is reasonable."
2002.01-963,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,1625.314,1626.14,And we do not--
2002.01-963,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1626.14,1635.428,"One threshold test that we all agree on is, the fear has at least got to be confirmed by some physical manifestation."
2002.01-963,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,1651.925,1677.121,"--Your Honor, we think that one of the primary reasons why it should not be enough... that reasonableness of the fear should not be enough in and of itself... even assuming for a moment that the statistics that are at... that were in evidence here are, in fact, sufficiently conclusive to draw those assumptions... I mean, I do think it's important to remember that this Court in Buckley referred to these same types of figures as being uncertain and controversial, and I think that that description is probably still true here."
2002.01-963,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1719.474,1720.672,"Thank you, Mr. Salmons."
2002.01-963,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,1720.672,1721.31,--Thank you.
2002.01-963,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1721.31,1723.705,"Mr. Lazarus, we'll hear from you."
2002.01-963,2,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,1723.705,1728.08,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2002.01-963,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1753.611,1758.256,"Well, the question presented doesn't speak in terms of the instruction, as I read it."
2002.01-963,2,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,1758.256,1781.291,"--No, but the question poses a pure question of law, and that is whether, when you have a physical injury, what the relationship has to be between the emotional distress and the physical injury, and our argument, Your Honor, is that under traditional tort law, it is not required that the emotional stress immediately accompany the physical injury; that it have its own physical manifestations; that it be severe."
2002.01-963,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1822.612,1825.584,And you say this case is not brought on this theory?
2002.01-963,2,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,1825.584,1829.299,--The jury instruction is reproduced on page 573 of the joint appendix.
2002.01-963,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1829.299,1831.035,Where do we... 573?
2002.01-963,2,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,1831.035,1852.833,"573 on the joint appendix, and that jury instruction makes it absolutely clear that respondents were entitled to recover for their reasonable fear of cancer as part of their overall damages only to the extent that that fear related to... the Court's words... related to proven physical injury, and there is absolutely no merit to petitioner's argument--"
2002.01-963,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1852.833,1862.409,Do some jurisdictions go further these days and require there be a reasonable causal nexus?
2002.01-963,2,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,1862.409,1865.631,"--Your Honor, almost no jurisdictions do."
2002.01-963,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1866.867,1868.603,I thought there were a few that did.
2002.01-963,2,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,1868.603,1877.891,"--But almost all the cases go the other way, and the reason, Your Honor, is because... there's some confusion in petitioner's argument here about what ""pain and suffering"" means."
2002.01-963,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1911.865,1940.761,"All that is true, what you say, but I felt the question was open, and the reason that I thought it was open is because probably I once learned that this area of the law arose out of an English case where somebody is watching a coffin fall off in an accident, and the rule was that you can't recover unless something hits you, but what you were recovering for was the coffin, and the pain and suffering that a family member would feel."
2002.01-963,2,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,1940.761,1940.994,Right.
2002.01-963,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1940.994,1950.299,"That was immediate, directly related to the accident, and quite clearly present and measurable."
2002.01-963,2,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,1950.299,1950.586,Right.
2002.01-963,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1950.586,1953.726,This is the kind of thing that is not immediate.
2002.01-963,2,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,1966.729,1967.76,"Your Honor, it's really--"
2002.01-963,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1967.76,1975.684,"You want to say... I'll look it up, but if you were to say it's absolutely not open, I mean, they have, you know, lots of briefs where they've made a pretty good case it's at least open."
2002.01-963,2,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,1975.684,1976.882,--It's open and shut.
2002.01-963,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1976.882,1978.079,"Oh, all right."
2002.01-963,3,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3448.823,3449.733,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2002.01-963,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3484.367,3494.687,"Well, but should we adopt your position if it's as difficult to show this separate causation as your brother argues?"
2002.01-963,3,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3494.687,3501.95,"--Well, Dean Prosser said from day one it's always going to be difficult to apportion, but that's no reason not to have the jury undertake to apportion."
2002.01-963,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3560.733,3561.948,"Thank you, Mr. Phillips."
