2003.02-964,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,7.142,"We'll hear argument now in No. 02-964, George Baldwin v. Michael Reese."
2003.02-964,0,27613,hardy_myers,,11.312,14.201,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2003.02-964,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,110.674,117.733,"Well, we're reviewing a Ninth Circuit holding, which seems fairly open-ended."
2003.02-964,0,27613,hardy_myers,,120.251,148.336,"--Your Honor, I was about to describe it is a transformation of the responsibility of the state prisoner to present his claim, a transformation of that into a responsibility of the... of the state court... state courts to, in effect, step into the shoes of the state prisoner and complete or try to complete an incompletely presented claim."
2003.02-964,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,169.041,176.805,"Well, do you agree with your opponents here on at least some of the ground rules that would suffice?"
2003.02-964,0,27613,hardy_myers,,190.672,191.498,--Yes.
2003.02-964,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,193.812,201.363,How about if you cite at least a... a reported case that has decided the claim on a Federal basis?
2003.02-964,0,27613,hardy_myers,,204.873,205.905,--Yes--
2003.02-964,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,205.905,209.908,--clearly has decided the claim on a Federal basis.
2003.02-964,0,27613,hardy_myers,,212.138,213.874,"--Yes, Your Honors, so--"
2003.02-964,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,213.874,223.078,And what if a... a claim is spelled out that necessarily must be based on a Federal right to exist at all?
2003.02-964,0,27613,hardy_myers,,223.078,227.62,"--Yes, Your Honor, that is part of the test that we propose--"
2003.02-964,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,227.62,228.196,Why yes?
2003.02-964,0,27613,hardy_myers,,238.121,247.698,"--Well, we are referring to necessarily, Your Honor, in the sense that the... the source of the claim, that is its Federal source, is--"
2003.02-964,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,247.698,247.986,Who--
2003.02-964,0,27613,hardy_myers,,248.812,249.351,--is unmistake--
2003.02-964,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,249.351,250.837,--He hasn't read the state constitution.
2003.02-964,0,27613,hardy_myers,,263.961,266.812,"--Your Honor, we think that the state court--"
2003.02-964,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,266.812,270.36,And I don't want to have to go through the trouble of figuring out whether there's a valid state claim.
2003.02-964,0,27613,hardy_myers,,290.711,293.949,"--No, Your Honor, and we would be quite content--"
2003.02-964,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,293.949,295.419,So why do you want to add anything to it?
2003.02-964,0,27613,hardy_myers,,318.825,319.568,"--No, Your Honor."
2003.02-964,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,321.341,321.918,You don't think so?
2003.02-964,0,27613,hardy_myers,,321.918,323.942,--Not... not necessarily--
2003.02-964,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,323.942,328.4,"Yeah, but if he added, and therefore, it violated the Federal Constitution, then it would be a Federal claim?"
2003.02-964,0,27613,hardy_myers,,328.4,345.49,"--Your Honor, it would... the... a Federal source of the claim would have been identified, but, of course, whatever further clarification the Court might consider adopting or adopt, the balance of the statement of the claim also has to meet the requirements of fair presentation."
2003.02-964,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,345.49,352.755,But why... why doesn't the state judge know he's raising a claim of inadequate assistance of counsel that violates the Federal Constitution?
2003.02-964,0,27613,hardy_myers,,357.75,371.414,"No, Your Honor, because the description of the claim that you just gave, apart from whether it's factually adequate or whatever could as... could equally address, or state a claim under state law."
2003.02-964,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,371.414,372.09,"Well, certainly--"
2003.02-964,0,27613,hardy_myers,,376.698,378.184,"Not necessarily, Your Honor."
2003.02-964,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,378.184,396.677,"I... I thought the Federal standards... and I was going to get into this, but let's do it in relation to Justice Stevens' hypothetical... I thought the Federal standards and the state standards for adequate assistance of counsel were... were in substance the same, and in, you know, in Oregon."
2003.02-964,0,27613,hardy_myers,,417.193,428.339,"Your Honor, when state judicial authority is invoked to address a claim before it, it's of paramount importance for that court to know whether it is addressing a state claim--"
2003.02-964,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,428.339,428.71,"No, my--"
2003.02-964,0,27613,hardy_myers,,442.995,444.786,"--No, Your Honor, and I would like to--"
2003.02-964,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,444.786,446.915,May... maybe I didn't make my... my point.
2003.02-964,0,27613,hardy_myers,,472.717,490.3,"--And, Your Honor, as I was saying a few moments ago, it... the answer to that goes to the fact... or rests on the fact that the state court's authority to address a state law-based claim is very different, of course, from its authority to address a Federal law-based claim."
2003.02-964,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,504.5,517.131,"No, but I'm... my... the... the... my... my question assumed that the... that the substantive law governing the claim was the same under... under the state system and under the Federal system."
2003.02-964,0,27613,hardy_myers,,529.969,544.558,"--But, Your Honor, the... the... the authority issue is crucial, because if the state court does not know whether it, in fact, has a state law claim before it, it does not know whether it has the prerogative in that case to change the rule."
2003.02-964,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,544.558,544.913,Suppose--
2003.02-964,0,27613,hardy_myers,,596.653,620.952,"Your Honor, I... I would still assert respectfully that the... the... the clarity with which the claim is presented in terms of making clear whether there is a state claim or a Federal claim present is still of great importance, because the state court can still change its decision with respect to the state claim if it is a state claim."
2003.02-964,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,620.952,625.782,"Sure it can, but the question is, what does it know when it sets out to adjudicate the case?"
2003.02-964,0,27613,hardy_myers,,693.194,704.006,"Well, Your Honor, with respect, we do think that there is unfairness if it is not absolutely and explicitly clear to the court that a Federal claim is being presented by a state court."
2003.02-964,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,704.006,705.121,You mean because it's just nice to know?
2003.02-964,0,27613,hardy_myers,,705.121,706.03,"No, because it--"
2003.02-964,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,706.03,707.6,It doesn't make any difference in the law.
2003.02-964,0,27613,hardy_myers,,712.263,719.405,"--But it could, in the sense that they might want to change their position or interpretation with respect to state law."
2003.02-964,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,719.405,721.262,"Yes, but that... the change in position to allow the claim."
2003.02-964,0,27613,hardy_myers,,730.013,731.106,"That's true, Your Honor."
2003.02-964,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,731.106,743.282,"And so if he's denied relief without knowing whether it's Federal or state, is there any possibility that if it were refiled, and clearly named Federal Constitution as the background, he would then grant relief?"
2003.02-964,0,27613,hardy_myers,,743.282,746.897,"I'm not sure, Your Honor."
2003.02-964,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,747.474,748.922,I don't see how it could possibly happen.
2003.02-964,0,27613,hardy_myers,,777.174,799.487,"Well, because we think at... again, Your Honor, we think... not only do I still feel the authority issue, very respectfully, is important, but also our whole approach toward fair presentation of Federal claims places a choice on the petitioner to make as to whether or not to assert a Federal claim."
2003.02-964,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,799.487,803.368,"General Myers, doesn't the burden on the habeas court have anything to do with this?"
2003.02-964,0,27613,hardy_myers,,851.954,853.069,"No, Your Honor."
2003.02-964,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,853.069,854.433,How often are these habeas--
2003.02-964,0,27613,hardy_myers,,854.433,854.721,There is--
2003.02-964,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,854.721,858.148,--petitioners represented by counsel in Oregon?
2003.02-964,0,27613,hardy_myers,,863.554,864.586,--For Federal habeas?
2003.02-964,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,864.586,865.207,Right.
2003.02-964,0,27613,hardy_myers,,865.207,868.801,"Yes, I... well, like indigent Federal habeas, yes, I believe so, Your Honor."
2003.02-964,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,868.801,870.12,You don't know that?
2003.02-964,0,27613,hardy_myers,,870.78,871.606,"Oh, I'm sorry."
2003.02-964,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,873.009,878.005,In... in the Federal court you think they're routinely appointed by the state?
2003.02-964,0,27613,hardy_myers,,878.005,880.689,"--No, not--"
2003.02-964,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,880.689,882.463,A Federal habeas petitioner?
2003.02-964,0,27613,hardy_myers,,882.463,884.404,"--In Federal court, no, Your Honor."
2003.02-964,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,885.769,885.973,No.
2003.02-964,0,27613,hardy_myers,,885.973,886.512,--They would--
2003.02-964,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,886.512,887.831,It would be up to the Federal rules.
2003.02-964,0,27613,hardy_myers,,887.831,888.945,"--they would probably be Federal, yes."
2003.02-964,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,889.688,899.059,And must... must the petitioner seeking habeas relief also fairly present the factual basis for the claim?
2003.02-964,0,27613,hardy_myers,,899.059,901.371,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2003.02-964,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,901.371,902.569,Was that done here?
2003.02-964,0,27613,hardy_myers,,902.569,903.396,"No, Your Honor."
2003.02-964,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,903.396,907.194,And did the state point that out alone?
2003.02-964,0,27613,hardy_myers,,907.194,908.347,"No, Your Honor."
2003.02-964,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,924.694,929.402,"Well, but if the petition contains no facts, you wouldn't point that out?"
2003.02-964,0,27613,hardy_myers,,931.26,932.003,Your Honor--
2003.02-964,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,932.003,933.71,"Why wouldn't you say, but there are no facts?"
2003.02-964,0,27613,hardy_myers,,933.71,951.05,"--Your Honor, in this case, we made a choice to concentrate or focus on the issue of the... of the sufficiency of the... of the identification of the claim as Federal, and we maintained that as the focus and that was the... the focus of the petition, of course, for--"
2003.02-964,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,951.05,956.273,And you want us to decide this case on the assumption that facts were presented when indeed none were?
2003.02-964,0,27613,hardy_myers,,956.273,964.325,"--In this case, yes, Your Honor, inasmuch as we have not appealed from... we have not made that an issue below and appealed from it."
2003.02-964,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,976.79,978.154,May I... may I go back to the question--
2003.02-964,0,27613,hardy_myers,,1000.667,1002.136,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2003.02-964,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1002.136,1003.456,So that that's a two-part test.
2003.02-964,0,27613,hardy_myers,,1053.777,1056.295,"It... well, Your Honor, we don't... yes."
2003.02-964,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1088.867,1093.697,We certainly enforce it with respect to people raising claims in our Court.
2003.02-964,0,27613,hardy_myers,,1100.96,1102.446,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2003.02-964,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1103.478,1137.536,"How does the case decided, the Fitzgerald case, which is cited in page 34 of the red brief, it was just last term, when... when this Court said that the Court would consider a state court decision as relying on Federal grounds sufficient to support this Court's jurisdiction, if under the state's decisional law, the state and the Federal constitutional claim are treated identically, the content of the right is treated identically."
2003.02-964,0,27613,hardy_myers,,1159.539,1169.691,"--I... I may have misunderstood the... that interpretation, Your Honor, because I thought this was still a very much open question as to whether--"
2003.02-964,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1169.691,1171.632,This was not in the habeas context.
2003.02-964,0,27613,hardy_myers,,1171.632,1172.663,"--Yes, I understand."
2003.02-964,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1176.545,1179.767,And it... what I read to you is... is from the decision itself.
2003.02-964,0,27613,hardy_myers,,1214.811,1231.53,"--Well, if I am understanding it correctly, Your Honor, I would very much advocate for the Court not extending... I'm understanding it correctly... not extending that... that doctrine or view, if you will, into the habeas context."
2003.02-964,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1231.53,1234.009,"It had to do with jurisdiction, not with pleading."
2003.02-964,0,27613,hardy_myers,,1270.212,1285.612,"It is, Your Honor, to assure that the states have a meaningful first response... opportunity to consider Federal attacks on their convictions, and to--"
2003.02-964,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1285.612,1292.421,Do you... do you think the hypothetical that I gave you would give a state court a meaningful opportunity to decide the Federal question?
2003.02-964,0,27613,hardy_myers,,1292.421,1295.188,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2003.02-964,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1295.188,1299.562,Then it would seem we would follow the exhaustion requirement is satisfied.
2003.02-964,0,27613,hardy_myers,,1299.562,1302.702,"Yes, Your Honor."
2003.02-964,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1302.702,1305.424,May I go back to the question of appointment of counsel?
2003.02-964,0,27613,hardy_myers,,1311.368,1312.937,"Yes, Your Honor, by statute--"
2003.02-964,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1312.937,1313.68,--for state habeas--
2003.02-964,0,27613,hardy_myers,,1313.68,1316.076,"--In the post-conviction relief process, yes."
2003.02-964,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1316.076,1316.652,--Okay.
2003.02-964,0,27613,hardy_myers,,1316.652,1317.601,"Always, by statute."
2003.02-964,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1379.113,1383.982,Don't you think it's likely that Federal judges sitting in the state would be aware of those changes?
2003.02-964,0,27613,hardy_myers,,1383.982,1387.204,"--Yes, I think they would be aware of them, Your Honor."
2003.02-964,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1400.579,1404.644,But are you thinking of changes that are favorable to the claimant or favorable to the state?
2003.02-964,0,27613,hardy_myers,,1404.644,1406.317,"--Well, I think it could go either way, Your Honor."
2003.02-964,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1406.317,1410.033,"But certainly if it's favorable to the claimant, it couldn't cause any harm."
2003.02-964,0,27613,hardy_myers,,1413.376,1413.848,Yes.
2003.02-964,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1413.848,1434.387,"I guess in every case where the Federal habeas court has some doubt whether a Federal claim was raised, the Federal habeas court, that is, where it is not explicitly stated, the Federal habeas court will have to inquire into state law to see whether it is indeed congruent with Federal law."
2003.02-964,0,27613,hardy_myers,,1435.296,1436.949,"Yes, that's correct."
2003.02-964,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1509.145,1515.378,"What was wrong with the Ninth Circuit's position, at least with respect to the intermediate appellate court?"
2003.02-964,0,27613,hardy_myers,,1539.61,1553.828,"Actually, Your Honor, in the petition for review in Oregon, the decision of the court below is included, but that in this case was a summary affirmance of the... of the trial court's decision."
2003.02-964,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1553.828,1557.154,"Well, you're talking about the court... the Supreme Court of Oregon."
2003.02-964,0,27613,hardy_myers,,1560.21,1561.901,"Yes, that's--"
2003.02-964,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1561.901,1564.79,The... the appeal from the trial court to the court of appeals.
2003.02-964,0,27613,hardy_myers,,1564.79,1566.276,"--I beg your pardon, Your Honor."
2003.02-964,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1608.441,1613.354,"Do you wish to reserve the rest of your time, General Myers?"
2003.02-964,0,27613,hardy_myers,,1613.354,1613.725,I do.
2003.02-964,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1614.18,1614.923,Very well.
2003.02-964,1,20566,dennis_balske,,1617.236,1622.149,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2003.02-964,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1651.416,1653.106,"You're talking about the trial court, correct?"
2003.02-964,1,20566,dennis_balske,,1653.106,1653.728,"--Yes, I am."
2003.02-964,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1655.974,1659.877,You have to... you agree you have to present the claim all the way up through the state?
2003.02-964,1,20566,dennis_balske,,1659.877,1660.62,"--I do, I do."
2003.02-964,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1679.817,1684.769,"Well, there were... there were two... there was a petition and an amended position, as I recall."
2003.02-964,1,20566,dennis_balske,,1684.769,1685.223,Correct.
2003.02-964,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1685.223,1685.883,Correct me if I'm wrong.
2003.02-964,1,20566,dennis_balske,,1685.883,1686.792,You're right.
2003.02-964,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1686.792,1695.914,And the... the original petition did not recite the... the factual basis to support the claim.
2003.02-964,1,20566,dennis_balske,,1723.49,1731.087,"Well, well the... the way it works in PCR is the court, under the pleadings, decides the case based on the first amended petition."
2003.02-964,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1752.097,1755.236,"No, you're... you're... you refer to a clear statement rule."
2003.02-964,1,20566,dennis_balske,,1757.215,1757.853,--Yes.
2003.02-964,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1757.853,1758.58,--or a rule of Federal law?
2003.02-964,1,20566,dennis_balske,,1758.58,1760.642,"That is a rule of Oregon law, and that--"
2003.02-964,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1760.642,1763.797,"And what does... what does it... what does that... what's the case for it, and what does it say?"
2003.02-964,1,20566,dennis_balske,,1763.797,1764.44,--All right.
2003.02-964,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1765.738,1766.176,Okay.
2003.02-964,1,20566,dennis_balske,,1766.176,1769.724,It's 138.640.
2003.02-964,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1805.474,1816.953,Did... did... did the order of the Oregon trial court specify the facts upon which the Federal claim was--
2003.02-964,1,20566,dennis_balske,,1816.953,1817.408,No.
2003.02-964,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1817.408,1817.779,--was based?
2003.02-964,1,20566,dennis_balske,,1817.779,1818.317,No.
2003.02-964,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1835.59,1836.892,"Well, all right, but it wasn't, okay?"
2003.02-964,1,20566,dennis_balske,,1839.782,1840.236,--Right.
2003.02-964,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1840.236,1841.556,--thousands of cases.
2003.02-964,1,20566,dennis_balske,,1850.434,1850.844,Right.
2003.02-964,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1850.844,1855.014,So I look to see what the arguments are that he's making that the lower court made a mistake.
2003.02-964,1,20566,dennis_balske,,1864.385,1864.84,Right.
2003.02-964,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1864.84,1865.416,All right?
2003.02-964,1,20566,dennis_balske,,1875.736,1876.812,There... let... let me help you there.
2003.02-964,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1921.227,1925.974,"But all that tells me is that somewhere in this brief they're cited, that's the table of authorities they cite."
2003.02-964,1,20566,dennis_balske,,1928.203,1929.235,--And... well--
2003.02-964,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1929.235,1932.001,"So if I'm going to look to see what the argument is, I'll try to turn the page and--"
2003.02-964,1,20566,dennis_balske,,1932.001,1932.578,--A judge--
2003.02-964,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1932.578,1933.776,--where does it say he's making the argument--
2003.02-964,1,20566,dennis_balske,,1933.776,1951.98,"--You're not going to look for an argument because you're an Oregon Supreme Court judge, and under the Oregon Supreme Court rule, I'm... yeah, 9.05(4)(A)(v), the petitioner only presents a brief argument if he wants to, it's optional."
2003.02-964,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1954.952,1956.976,--Do you have to have your reasons why they're wrong and so on?
2003.02-964,1,20566,dennis_balske,,1956.976,1957.142,"--Yes, and in--"
2003.02-964,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1957.142,1957.598,Where is that?
2003.02-964,1,20566,dennis_balske,,1957.598,1963.17,"--that's where we turn to the next page, 47, statement of legal questions presented on review."
2003.02-964,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1993.019,1993.596,I see.
2003.02-964,1,20566,dennis_balske,,2001.77,2003.627,And that--
2003.02-964,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2003.627,2011.058,And... and are you saying that Oregon rules make it optional as to whether he's going to tell me what the case is about?
2003.02-964,1,20566,dennis_balske,,2011.058,2015.106,"--Yeah, what... well, whether you're going to brief it, whether you're going to present legal argument."
2003.02-964,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2016.509,2017.623,But there are no facts.
2003.02-964,1,20566,dennis_balske,,2025.797,2028.147,--Because the state waived that defense in this case.
2003.02-964,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2029.717,2031.203,But it... but the point is--
2003.02-964,1,20566,dennis_balske,,2031.203,2031.574,--I'm sorry.
2003.02-964,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2031.574,2038.511,"--as I understand my colleague's question, if the judge sees that there are no facts set out, why doesn't the judge just say, you're out of here?"
2003.02-964,1,20566,dennis_balske,,2038.511,2048.581,"The judge might say that, but the judge would say that in the context of a Federal question, a Federal issue presented of ineffective assistance of counsel under the Federal Constitution."
2003.02-964,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2048.581,2051.803,But think he would say that on the basis of Oregon procedural law that--
2003.02-964,1,20566,dennis_balske,,2051.803,2052.295,Well--
2003.02-964,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2052.295,2054.69,--you... you just haven't said anything.
2003.02-964,1,20566,dennis_balske,,2054.69,2062.327,"--Well, I don't... well, it's conjecture what they would have decided or thought."
2003.02-964,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2067.878,2068.355,Okay.
2003.02-964,1,20566,dennis_balske,,2073.434,2073.927,--Sure.
2003.02-964,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2073.927,2084.208,"--to either say, I'm relying on section, you know, article XIV of the United States Constitution, or I'm relying on some Federal case."
2003.02-964,1,20566,dennis_balske,,2087.112,2087.485,Well--
2003.02-964,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2087.485,2089.038,What's... what's hard about that?
2003.02-964,1,20566,dennis_balske,,2089.038,2089.531,--Well--
2003.02-964,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2089.531,2091.1,Could... can you answer that?
2003.02-964,1,20566,dennis_balske,,2091.1,2096.318,--I... I can answer it by saying that the prisoners are pretty ignorant.
2003.02-964,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2103.089,2105.423,"Well, you... how sharp do you have to be to figure that out?"
2003.02-964,1,20566,dennis_balske,,2105.423,2108.646,"Well, tell you what, let me give you the perfect example in this case."
2003.02-964,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2123.628,2125.486,"No, where... are... are you reading from some... in the brief?"
2003.02-964,1,20566,dennis_balske,,2125.486,2125.786,--Yes.
2003.02-964,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2147.034,2147.489,Go ahead.
2003.02-964,1,20566,dennis_balske,,2147.489,2162.349,"--If Mr. Reese followed the formula written by the attorney general, he would fail their test, because the right to ineffective assistance of appellate counsel comes under the Fourteenth Amendment, not the Sixth Amendment."
2003.02-964,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2173.578,2174.488,Touche.
2003.02-964,1,20566,dennis_balske,,2177.21,2183.609,"--I... I think, Justice O'Connor--"
2003.02-964,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2183.609,2200.41,"I... I think it's... it's... it's common to, you know, you've heard of the incorporation doctrine, which is that the Fourteenth Amendment incorporates and applies to the states the first ten amendments, or at least portions of the first ten amendments."
2003.02-964,1,20566,dennis_balske,,2200.41,2201.98,--But--
2003.02-964,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2201.98,2209.904,"So it is not inaccurate to say that... that it's a Sixth Amendment right, which has been applied to the states via the Fourteenth."
2003.02-964,1,20566,dennis_balske,,2209.904,2219.563,"--I thought when we're talking about appellate counsel, though, the Sixth Amendment doesn't cover it, because the Sixth Amendment doesn't give you the right to effective counsel on your appeal, only at trial."
2003.02-964,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2233.104,2243.302,"What would happen if the Oregon constitution happened to contain the right in the same number amendment, like the Sixth was... they were both Sixth Amendment."
2003.02-964,1,20566,dennis_balske,,2245.941,2248.049,"Well, the... it... the trouble here, the heart--"
2003.02-964,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2248.049,2258.285,"Or is this... is this one of the ones that it doesn't contain it in the Oregon constitution Sixth Amendment so this is one of the ones that, by necessity, must refer to."
2003.02-964,1,20566,dennis_balske,,2258.285,2258.756,--No.
2003.02-964,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2264.123,2265.322,But the... the court of appeals--
2003.02-964,1,20566,dennis_balske,,2265.322,2265.693,--tougher case.
2003.02-964,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2265.693,2282.905,"--thought that the only way in which this claim was properly presented was if they adopted, the court of appeals adopted the rule, that the state court is deemed to have read and understood the proceedings in the trial court."
2003.02-964,1,20566,dennis_balske,,2284.391,2285.589,I think they said that and--
2003.02-964,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2285.589,2286.415,--that formulation of the rule?
2003.02-964,1,20566,dennis_balske,,2286.415,2291.616,"--I think they said that, and I don't think you have to go that far to find that Mr. Reese fairly presented his claim."
2003.02-964,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2291.616,2293.557,"Well, do you defend that as the test?"
2003.02-964,1,20566,dennis_balske,,2293.557,2294.877,I'm--
2003.02-964,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2294.877,2296.258,It... it's a... do you defend--
2003.02-964,1,20566,dennis_balske,,2296.258,2296.651,--No.
2003.02-964,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2296.651,2297.394,--the Ninth Circuit's--
2003.02-964,1,20566,dennis_balske,,2297.394,2297.932,I don't.
2003.02-964,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2297.932,2299.046,--articulated test?
2003.02-964,1,20566,dennis_balske,,2299.046,2300.821,I do not defend the Ninth Circuit's test.
2003.02-964,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2302.102,2302.678,In your--
2003.02-964,1,20566,dennis_balske,,2302.678,2305.651,I only say to you he fairly presented the claim in this case.
2003.02-964,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2305.651,2305.939,--Right.
2003.02-964,1,20566,dennis_balske,,2310.109,2310.58,Yes.
2003.02-964,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2310.58,2316.22,--is there really a big problem of differences among the lower circuits... among the lower courts?
2003.02-964,1,20566,dennis_balske,,2321.171,2321.876,Correct.
2003.02-964,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2321.876,2324.022,And there are dozens of ways it could be done.
2003.02-964,1,20566,dennis_balske,,2346.313,2352.174,"Well, if the... the... there are differences in the circuits, so I can't disagree--"
2003.02-964,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2352.174,2354.486,Is it... are they real differences in terms of what counts or--
2003.02-964,1,20566,dennis_balske,,2354.486,2354.858,"--Well, I--"
2003.02-964,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2354.858,2355.312,--are they just differences in--
2003.02-964,1,20566,dennis_balske,,2355.312,2366.746,"--I don't think they are in the sense of, although I know this Court likely views the Ninth Circuit as quote, unquote, a liberal circuit of sorts, when you read their opinion here, they were being very conservative."
2003.02-964,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2372.979,2376.489,"--But that... that's a Ninth Circuit case, isn't it, the... Duncan against Henry?"
2003.02-964,1,20566,dennis_balske,,2376.489,2378.263,"--Yes, it is."
2003.02-964,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2378.923,2380.121,It's not a case from this Court?
2003.02-964,1,20566,dennis_balske,,2380.121,2381.979,"No, I was talking about--"
2003.02-964,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2381.979,2382.6,But... but the only--
2003.02-964,1,20566,dennis_balske,,2382.6,2383.836,--they were applying your Duncan decision.
2003.02-964,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2383.836,2394.489,"--But the only way in which they could sustain their judgment was to adopt this rule of... that the appellate court has the duty, or is presumed to have understood what happened in the trial court."
2003.02-964,1,20566,dennis_balske,,2406.832,2407.242,Right.
2003.02-964,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2407.242,2421.071,"--but the... the petition that you read me at the appendix, where that just cites the Federal constitutional provision and then says ineffective of counsel... ineffective assistance of counsel... does not give the court any clue as to what it's supposed to do--"
2003.02-964,1,20566,dennis_balske,,2421.071,2422.353,Well--
2003.02-964,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2422.353,2423.755,--other than to review a record.
2003.02-964,1,20566,dennis_balske,,2423.755,2427.015,--Well... sorry.
2003.02-964,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2427.015,2442.908,"And... and... and I had thought the exhaustion requirement was designed to give the court some assistance in determining whether or not it showed... should spend more time with the case in order to review the record, in other words, said that counsel had a conflict of interest because of marriage or something."
2003.02-964,1,20566,dennis_balske,,2455.046,2459.709,"Well, what the purpose of the exhaustion rule is to give him a fair opportunity to decide it."
2003.02-964,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2466.646,2472.052,"But we get thousands of cases around here that just says Fifth Amendment, ineffective assistance of counsel."
2003.02-964,1,20566,dennis_balske,,2474.281,2474.736,--Well--
2003.02-964,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2474.736,2475.313,Sixth Amendment.
2003.02-964,1,20566,dennis_balske,,2475.313,2478.739,--here... here we're talking about ineffective assistance of counsel.
2003.02-964,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2556.841,2581.361,"Well, it seems to me that argument that you're making now that inadequate is the buzzword for a state claim, ineffective for a Federal claim, is at least in tension with your argument that... that in... with respect to ineffective assistance of counsel, the state... the content of the state standard and... is identical to the Federal."
2003.02-964,1,20566,dennis_balske,,2589.496,2589.734,--Right.
2003.02-964,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2668.463,2687.41,"--Well, if you... you say that the Ninth Circuit approach to this was wrong, which... which seems to be anchored in, if it's clear that the court of first instance relied on the Federal ground, that stays with the case all the way up."
2003.02-964,1,20566,dennis_balske,,2698.063,2698.639,Sure.
2003.02-964,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2716.017,2716.389,But may I--
2003.02-964,1,20566,dennis_balske,,2730.878,2734.322,That... I... that's true.
2003.02-964,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2736.534,2740.621,I thought you said before that you were not defending the... the Ninth Circuit's approach.
2003.02-964,1,20566,dennis_balske,,2740.621,2740.992,--I--
2003.02-964,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2740.992,2741.819,Now you tell me you are.
2003.02-964,1,20566,dennis_balske,,2751.933,2753.086,--That's correct.
2003.02-964,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2753.086,2758.266,"And I was going to ask you if you're relying on that now, why didn't you rely on it in your brief in opposition?"
2003.02-964,1,20566,dennis_balske,,2776.204,2776.575,I did--
2003.02-964,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2776.575,2778.077,--you respond to that--
2003.02-964,1,20566,dennis_balske,,2778.077,2778.344,"--I did, but I--"
2003.02-964,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2778.344,2785.657,"--by simply saying the question is not presented because, in fact, he did cite a specific provision of the Constitution?"
2003.02-964,1,20566,dennis_balske,,2785.657,2787.515,"--I did, but I didn't--"
2003.02-964,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2787.515,2790.943,"I mean, we're wasting our time here if... if you want us to decide whether this brief--"
2003.02-964,1,20566,dennis_balske,,2790.943,2791.686,--It's--
2003.02-964,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2791.686,2794.036,"--you know, contains the... the Sixth Amendment or not."
2003.02-964,1,20566,dennis_balske,,2804.81,2805.448,--I understand.
2003.02-964,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2805.448,2807.744,--What... we're just spinning our wheels here.
2003.02-964,1,20566,dennis_balske,,2809.496,2809.951,"But, yeah--"
2003.02-964,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2809.951,2810.239,Where?
2003.02-964,1,20566,dennis_balske,,2810.239,2810.611,--it's argued in--
2003.02-964,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2810.611,2810.982,I need to go back to it.
2003.02-964,1,20566,dennis_balske,,2810.982,2812.634,--It's in section III of my brief.
2003.02-964,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2812.634,2813.106,I've just looked at it.
2003.02-964,1,20566,dennis_balske,,2814.037,2814.492,Okay.
2003.02-964,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2814.492,2816.161,I didn't see it presented very clearly.
2003.02-964,1,20566,dennis_balske,,2864.276,2866.383,"Well, I--"
2003.02-964,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2866.383,2868.612,"That was, I thought, the question."
2003.02-964,1,20566,dennis_balske,,2868.612,2869.288,--Well--
2003.02-964,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2869.288,2872.16,"And on that question, do you... what do you want to say?"
2003.02-964,1,20566,dennis_balske,,2872.615,2873.729,"--Well, I guess what I want to say is this."
2003.02-964,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2906.301,2917.325,"--So... so... so now you're... you're... what you... in order to win your case, you're going to have to give us a standard, and your standard is, it seems to me, that state appellate courts are bound to look at the pleadings in the lower courts."
2003.02-964,1,20566,dennis_balske,,2917.325,2926.157,"--I guess you're seeing my focus being back in the state courts, and I'm looking at Federal court."
2003.02-964,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2944.567,2946.136,"No, but the exhaustion rule--"
2003.02-964,1,20566,dennis_balske,,2946.136,2946.508,--but what did he present?
2003.02-964,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2946.508,2952.163,--depends upon whether or not the state appellate courts had fair notice of the claim.
2003.02-964,1,20566,dennis_balske,,2952.163,2952.702,Yes.
2003.02-964,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2952.702,2955.674,And that's... that's what we're trying to discuss here and--
2003.02-964,1,20566,dennis_balske,,2967.767,2970.08,"Well, what we have here--"
2003.02-964,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2970.08,2971.688,And... and that is a rule.
2003.02-964,1,20566,dennis_balske,,2972.059,2972.968,"--Well... well, here's--"
2003.02-964,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2972.968,2975.486,"--you... you... if you're going to save your judgment, we're going to have to do it with a rule."
2003.02-964,1,20566,dennis_balske,,2975.486,2982.795,"--Well, and I think with the rule, here's... here's the caveat to the rule, so to speak, and it's that comity goes both ways."
2003.02-964,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3009.006,3011.485,"But that just goes to the trial court's judgment, doesn't it?"
2003.02-964,1,20566,dennis_balske,,3011.485,3016.725,"--Well, that goes to the... the... specifying the basis of the judgment in the trial court--"
2003.02-964,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3016.725,3016.941,Yeah.
2003.02-964,1,20566,dennis_balske,,3016.941,3019.037,--whether it's a state or a Federal issue.
2003.02-964,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3019.037,3019.325,Yeah.
2003.02-964,1,20566,dennis_balske,,3019.325,3022.463,"And in this case, in his written opinion, he does that."
2003.02-964,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3022.463,3025.603,But how does... how does that bear on the appeal process?
2003.02-964,1,20566,dennis_balske,,3025.603,3035.301,"And then in the appeal process, I'm... the... the... the reason you have the clear statement rule is so the appellate courts will know what the trial court did, not--"
2003.02-964,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3035.301,3039.282,"Well, then, you're really... you really are supporting the Ninth Circuit's judgment, aren't you... opinion?"
2003.02-964,1,20566,dennis_balske,,3049.213,3061.101,"--The... the court of appeals most certainly would have seen it and the... the Oregon Supreme Court was on notice by his petition, I mean, the petition for review itself--"
2003.02-964,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3061.101,3064.174,You... you want--
2003.02-964,1,20566,dennis_balske,,3064.174,3065.848,--is ineffective assistance of counsel.
2003.02-964,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3065.848,3076.168,"--You want to withdraw your... your assurance earlier that you are not defending the... the Ninth Circuit's basis for reaching its result, but just the result?"
2003.02-964,1,20566,dennis_balske,,3076.168,3084.879,"Well, I guess, you know, I didn't think that I needed the Ninth Circuit's and I... I must be confused now, because I think I just--"
2003.02-964,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3084.879,3085.539,I... I'm certainly confused.
2003.02-964,1,20566,dennis_balske,,3086.161,3086.616,"--Well, I think I can--"
2003.02-964,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3086.616,3086.904,Is... is--
2003.02-964,1,20566,dennis_balske,,3086.904,3087.647,--I'm sorry.
2003.02-964,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3087.647,3089.876,--I don't think you need the Ninth Circuit if you're saying the following.
2003.02-964,1,20566,dennis_balske,,3092.105,3092.371,Yeah.
2003.02-964,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3092.371,3092.826,--whether I'm right.
2003.02-964,1,20566,dennis_balske,,3134.353,3135.179,That's what I'm saying.
2003.02-964,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3135.179,3135.65,Okay.
2003.02-964,1,20566,dennis_balske,,3149.213,3153.55,"Well, yes, in this sense of... did you want--"
2003.02-964,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3153.55,3160.981,"Well, if there's a difference, would your client not have had the obligation to... to exhaust the state rule as well as the Federal rule?"
2003.02-964,1,20566,dennis_balske,,3165.439,3167.872,--I guess I didn't follow your question.
2003.02-964,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3169.441,3172.868,Are inadequate assistance as a matter of state law the same as--
2003.02-964,1,20566,dennis_balske,,3172.868,3173.322,Right.
2003.02-964,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3173.322,3174.808,--ineffective assistance as a matter of Federal law?
2003.02-964,1,20566,dennis_balske,,3174.808,3179.722,"Well, at the trial level, trial ineffectiveness, they are different clearly."
2003.02-964,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3185.128,3187.645,It is just a difference in names or a difference in substance?
2003.02-964,1,20566,dennis_balske,,3187.645,3191.322,--It's a difference in substance when you're talking about trial court ineffectiveness.
2003.02-964,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3192.847,3193.163,I see.
2003.02-964,1,20566,dennis_balske,,3193.94,3195.447,--now we're talking about appellate ineffectiveness.
2003.02-964,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3195.447,3196.19,Yeah.
2003.02-964,1,20566,dennis_balske,,3196.19,3205.561,"They've got one test that was discussed during earlier questions, and what they do is they interchangeably use the words ineffective and inadequate."
2003.02-964,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3210.558,3211.134,Okay.
2003.02-964,1,20566,dennis_balske,,3219.762,3220.505,Yes.
2003.02-964,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3220.505,3222.651,--the... the issue that--
2003.02-964,1,20566,dennis_balske,,3222.651,3223.766,Sure.
2003.02-964,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3223.766,3231.939,--that you are now relying on at the Supreme Court level to wit that the Federal Constitution was cited in the brief to the Supreme Court?
2003.02-964,1,20566,dennis_balske,,3231.939,3232.394,Right.
2003.02-964,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3232.394,3232.932,Where--
2003.02-964,1,20566,dennis_balske,,3232.932,3237.307,"Well, I think it will be in... I did it in three parts, and the third part would have been that--"
2003.02-964,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3237.307,3238.588,--This is the brief in opposition--
2003.02-964,1,20566,dennis_balske,,3240.612,3241.272,"--Oh, oh, oh, I'm sorry."
2003.02-964,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3242.182,3243.129,Once I've granted--
2003.02-964,1,20566,dennis_balske,,3246.74,3247.466,I'm sorry.
2003.02-964,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3247.466,3250.271,I... I like to know it's irrelevant before I vote to grant cert.
2003.02-964,1,20566,dennis_balske,,3250.271,3250.948,Right.
2003.02-964,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3259.865,3278.219,"If... can you tell... tell me, if I were to accept your position about the Ninth Circuit rule, how does it differ from what I wrote in dissent when I thought that we... you... you shouldn't have to go to the supreme court of the state, if you... if you remember?"
2003.02-964,1,20566,dennis_balske,,3279.35,3279.993,"--I mean, I know that--"
2003.02-964,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3279.993,3288.622,"I mean, what's bothering me about it is it sounds like a reasonable position, but it also sounds like a position I agreed with in dissent, which means it isn't the law, the opposite is the law."
2003.02-964,1,20566,dennis_balske,,3288.622,3298.364,"--Well, at... I don't disagree that O'Sullivan says that it's got to be presented to the highest court of the state."
2003.02-964,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3302.739,3320.488,"If there had been an... an objection preserved in the Ninth Circuit that whatever else, this doesn't tell us what the facts were, would not that have been a... a ground for saying you didn't exhaust?"
2003.02-964,1,20566,dennis_balske,,3320.488,3334.44,"That would have been a bigger problem for me than this problem, yes, because although he said, and part of his saying was under the Oregon Balfour procedure when he didn't have a lawyer, he said, my lawyer and I disagreed on what issues to raise."
2003.02-964,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3344.721,3353.925,"So... so they... they have abandoned an objection one... one would think would be the logical first one, he doesn't have any facts, out the door."
2003.02-964,1,20566,dennis_balske,,3353.925,3357.186,"Yes, I... that's true."
2003.02-964,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3358.689,3361.644,Do we have to ignore that too?
2003.02-964,1,20566,dennis_balske,,3361.644,3374.564,"I think you should, and I've argued in my brief that you should because they dropped it from the case and abandoned it, and because the only issue presented is the issue of whether or not he fairly presented it."
2003.02-964,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3380.88,3385.05,"But if this... if this Court is going to give any guidance, certainly that should be the... the first one, shouldn't it?"
2003.02-964,1,20566,dennis_balske,,3385.05,3385.588,Well sure.
2003.02-964,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3386.247,3387.279,"So, what your case is about--"
2003.02-964,1,20566,dennis_balske,,3387.279,3389.319,--and... and I think that is fair presentation law.

2003.02-964,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3483.585,3484.428,What... what is that?

2003.02-964,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3537.583,3539.191,Okay.
