1973.72-1690,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1754.619,1767.18,Do I correctly read the record that the essence of his defense was that he wasn’t showing contempt or disrespect but he was showing respect for the flag by associating it with the concept of peace?
1973.72-1690,1,33555,james_e_warme,,1767.18,1768.446,That was his defense.
1973.72-1690,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1771.886,1773.161,That was his testimony essentially was --
1973.72-1690,1,33555,james_e_warme,,1773.161,1784.301,"That it was his testimony but it was not relevant and the -- jury was instructed that that was not relevant and the Court should understand the statutory scheme in the State of Washington, there are two statutes."
1973.72-1690,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1827.332,1844.843,"That would protect a protect the person, would it not who has an old worn-out tattered flag and follows the procedure recommended in some Congressionally published flag book that the thing to do with such a flag is not to throw out in the garbage pail but to cremate it."
1973.72-1690,1,33555,james_e_warme,,1844.843,1845.651,That’s correct.
1973.72-1690,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1845.667,1848.873,So that he would be protected because his purpose was a benign purpose.
1973.72-1690,1,33555,james_e_warme,,1848.873,1849.9,That’s correct.
1973.72-1690,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1874.744,1894.122,"In the -- excuse me, in history books there's a -- some of the history books has a picture of the kind your friend referred to of, I think the campaign perhaps of Grover Cleveland or the McKinley’s day, that one of the campaign documents was the American flag with the picture of the candidate, Grover Cleveland, superimposed over it."
1973.72-1690,1,33555,james_e_warme,,1900.812,1902.67,If it were a picture of the flag?
1973.72-1690,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1902.67,1903.341,No.

1973.72-1690,1,33555,james_e_warme,,1906.052,1909.084,"If it were the flag itself, it would violate the statute, that’s correct."
1973.72-1690,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1909.084,1915.126,"But you say if it were reproduced as it is in the history book, it would not be."
1973.72-1690,1,33555,james_e_warme,,1915.126,1915.252,It would not be.
1973.72-1690,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1915.252,1917.598,To set the picture of the flag not a flag.
1973.72-1690,1,33555,james_e_warme,,1917.598,1918.492,That’s correct.
1973.72-1690,2,37947,peter_greenfield,,3449.656,3467.12,"Let me just clarify that personal in the sense that Mr. Warme was using it slightly different, I think and personal in the sense in which it was used in Chaplinsky, that is, was the fighting words doctrine involves words directed at a person, not something that one may as a matter of his own feelings finds the troubling."
