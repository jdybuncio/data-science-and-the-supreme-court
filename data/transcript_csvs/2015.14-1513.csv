2015.14-1513,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,14.16,"We'll hear argument next in Case 14-1513, Halo Electronics v. Pulse Electronics and the consolidated case, 14-1520, Stryker Corporation v. Zimmer. Mr. Wall."
2015.14-1513,0,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,14.16,66.065,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Federal Circuit has developed such a -- a rigid test for enhanced damages in patent infringement cases that a large number of the worst infringers, even bad-faith copiers, are not -- are immunized from any enhancement. The Federal Circuit has done that by moving away from historical practice in two key ways. First, it's made the test all about recklessness rather than also intent. Second, it judges recklessness based on legal defenses developed in litigation rather than the facts at the time of the infringement. The net result, now that this Court in Octane and Highmark set aside a similarly artificial test for fees is a one-of-its-kind, good for patent-damages-only framework that does not track the enhancement statute's text, history, or purposes. It was not always this way."
2015.14-1513,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,81.0,90.16,"But is that -- is that what you're advocating, to return to that, just as a matter of discretion, for the district court and that's it?"
2015.14-1513,0,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,90.16,91.61,"In a word, yes."
2015.14-1513,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,131.29,134.21,You -- you referred to the nature of the infringement.
2015.14-1513,0,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,143.1,151.865,"Well, I think there was some litigation misconduct here, and we cited in the district court's opinion that Zimmer did conceal some things in the run up to trial."
2015.14-1513,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,165.4,172.405,We have to decide whether enhanced damages can be awarded solely based on litigation misconduct.
2015.14-1513,0,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,182.175,182.43,Yeah.
2015.14-1513,0,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,225.99,226.52,I think you could --
2015.14-1513,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,226.52,227.18,Why is the --
2015.14-1513,0,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,227.18,227.655,-- ordinarily --
2015.14-1513,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,227.655,246.585,"Why is the nature of the infringement so determinative under your view? Yes, they copied it, but perhaps they had a, you know, good-faith belief that this wasn't patented. So the fact that they copied it doesn't seem to me to automatically make it something which is suitable for sanctions."
2015.14-1513,0,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,246.585,250.005,"So the products here were marked. I mean, they were marked as patented."
2015.14-1513,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,252.185,255.63,"Or they could have had, you know, a good-faith belief that the patent wasn't valid."
2015.14-1513,0,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,255.63,256.14,Sure.
2015.14-1513,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,323.46,324.475,That may be.
2015.14-1513,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,493.79,495.68,Have I stated the argument --
2015.14-1513,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,495.68,497.16,-- pretty much the way it is? All right.
2015.14-1513,0,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,499.58,504.92,"I think you have stated the best possible version of Respondents' argument, and I'm happy with your assumptions."
2015.14-1513,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,518.61,519.97,Not just their strategy.
2015.14-1513,0,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,519.97,520.275,It's --
2015.14-1513,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,520.275,524.61,We have all kind of amicus briefs that say that's the truth.
2015.14-1513,0,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,544.025,555.26,"Justice Breyer, the sky didn't fall for a century and a half, and it's not going to fall if you reverse the Federal Circuit's framework, just as it didn't fall after Octane and Highmark in the fees context. You've got to show as a patentee, you've got to --"
2015.14-1513,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,555.26,556.23,It hasn't fallen.
2015.14-1513,0,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,560.6,565.29,"Justice Breyer, showing intent or recklessness based on the facts at the time is not going to be easy."
2015.14-1513,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,577.55,577.93,Okay.
2015.14-1513,0,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,578.88,579.21,-- carraigeware.
2015.14-1513,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,579.21,618.91,"-- with this? You've just used a word that might help: ""reasonable belief."" We say that where a company is small, where it is small and wants to run the risk, follow the Federal Circuit rule, in order to show willfulness -- because it's reasonable -- in order to show willfulness, you have to show that that infringer not only didn't know it was faulty, but also was a big company that was pretty used to getting these lawyers' opinions, and also pretty used to asking their own experts whether it really was a good patent or not."
2015.14-1513,0,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,621.17,640.0,"Justice Breyer, we tried in opening brief to embrace the full totality of circumstances, including the strength of the patent, the kind of notice, what's commercially reasonable in the industry. The one point I just want to make, because I think it's very important, is to get into the recklessness box at common law, and traditionally, you had to show an objectively high risk."
2015.14-1513,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,685.61,687.64,Tell me how you articulate this.
2015.14-1513,0,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,717.48,718.065,Yes.
2015.14-1513,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,718.065,725.505,It can't be that they can give enhanced penalties on whim.
2015.14-1513,0,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,725.505,726.175,That's right.
2015.14-1513,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,726.175,746.98,"All right? So if it's not whim, what is it? How do we articulate a test that protects what Justice Breyer is concerned about, which I think is a legitimate concern, but doesn't entrench a position that just favors you?"
2015.14-1513,0,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,746.98,747.35,No.
2015.14-1513,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,747.62,749.22,"And by that, I mean, you know --"
2015.14-1513,0,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,749.22,757.925,"Right. No, I think there's a little bit of daylight between us and the government, in the sense that we think the statute was invoked for various purposes and not just to punish infringement."
2015.14-1513,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,763.65,764.2,So how do --
2015.14-1513,0,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,764.2,765.82,And I think what you can say --
2015.14-1513,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,765.82,766.01,Help me --
2015.14-1513,0,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,766.01,772.31,"-- that the guidance is, in the lion's share of cases, what the parties are really debating is the nature of the infringement."
2015.14-1513,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,779.05,779.53,"No, but that -- that --"
2015.14-1513,0,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,779.53,779.93,-- is acting --
2015.14-1513,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,779.93,783.63,"-- you know, that these tests understands life a little -- is more --"
2015.14-1513,0,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,783.63,783.82,Sure.
2015.14-1513,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,783.82,793.455,"-- complex than that. Okay? Because you can often use the conduct of someone, after the time, to reflect what they thought."
2015.14-1513,0,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,805.17,805.85,Sure.
2015.14-1513,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,805.85,813.605,So your articulation doesn't really give life to the complexity of this inquiry.
2015.14-1513,0,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,813.605,820.47,"So -- and to add, then, a little more, I think what you ought to be taking into account is, for instance, the strength of the notice."
2015.14-1513,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,824.28,829.71,This is all the Read Corporation factors that the district court here did in the Stryker case.
2015.14-1513,0,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,829.71,830.26,I think that's right.
2015.14-1513,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,834.62,836.6,I don't want to adopt that test.
2015.14-1513,0,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,839.84,858.58,"I think what you would say is that in judging whether a reasonable person would have thought that there was a really high risk, you've got to take account of both the strength of the notice, what kind of notice were they on of the patent, and what would have been commercially reasonable in the industry as it exists."
2015.14-1513,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,868.13,880.885,Are courts going to be able to assess the state of mind of the infringer at the time of the infringer's conduct without getting into communications with the -- with the company's attorneys?
2015.14-1513,0,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,880.885,884.725,"Yes, Justice Alito, and they did historically."
2015.14-1513,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,911.25,930.78,"Well, this -- you see, you had the case where at the time when the -- the question of enhanced damages is decided, the judge can see that the defense was able to -- with the help of good lawyers, was able to put on an objectively reasonable, although unsuccessful, defense."
2015.14-1513,0,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,940.57,945.03,"Well, I think in the typical -- the -- the intent cases are -- are fairly easy because they're generally copying."
2015.14-1513,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,999.685,1015.62,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Martinez."
2015.14-1513,1,56052,roman_martinez,,1015.62,1024.42,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: We agree with the Federal Circuit and with all the parties to this case that mere negligence is not enough to trigger enhanced damages."
2015.14-1513,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1038.14,1050.465,The enhanced damages that we're discussing really is almost entirely punitive if the octane standard for attorneys' fees remains in effect.
2015.14-1513,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1073.74,1084.095,And you -- and you want to just basically dismantle the willfulness structure that the court of appeals has established; is that correct?
2015.14-1513,1,56052,roman_martinez,,1084.095,1084.765,No.
2015.14-1513,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1183.85,1185.74,I didn't think they were doing that.
2015.14-1513,1,56052,roman_martinez,,1258.74,1266.19,I think there are -- there are a couple things that are wrong with -- with that. Because I think the first thing that they're paid to do is to look to the text and history of the statute.
2015.14-1513,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1307.98,1309.62,But I just gave you the reason.
2015.14-1513,1,56052,roman_martinez,,1317.565,1327.11,"Well, I think -- I think that the reason you gave is that -- I think, of concern that we share, which is that we think it's important in cases where a patent is of questionable validity."
2015.14-1513,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1350.415,1356.66,"As I read your brief and the Petitioner's brief, I got the sense that there was quite a bit of difference between the two."
2015.14-1513,1,56052,roman_martinez,,1379.8,1381.0,I think there's some minor differences.
2015.14-1513,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1400.85,1402.48,Just a -- for one just brief moment.
2015.14-1513,1,56052,roman_martinez,,1405.32,1405.76,No.
2015.14-1513,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1410.73,1410.98,Okay.
2015.14-1513,1,56052,roman_martinez,,1410.98,1420.73,"In other words, if you have a good-faith belief that the patent is not valid and that belief's reasonable, we don't think you're an intentional infringer. The -- the second bucket covers recklessness cases."
2015.14-1513,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1478.26,1480.75,"That avoids the use of the word ""willfulness."""
2015.14-1513,1,56052,roman_martinez,,1480.75,1481.24,Excuse me?
2015.14-1513,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1481.24,1483.58,"That avoids the use of the word ""willfulness."""
2015.14-1513,1,56052,roman_martinez,,1483.58,1483.73,Right.
2015.14-1513,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1485.155,1486.43,But the bucket is there.
2015.14-1513,1,56052,roman_martinez,,1486.43,1488.56,There's a sort of semantic element to this case.
2015.14-1513,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1566.07,1567.23,Can I ask --
2015.14-1513,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1567.23,1577.28,"Why isn't that post hoc defense necessarily -- you're almost reading it as unreasonable, by definition."
2015.14-1513,1,56052,roman_martinez,,1577.28,1588.905,I think it's possible to imagine -- let me -- let me make it concrete. Imagine a case in which there's intentional violation or a reckless violation based on the facts known at the time.
2015.14-1513,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1626.59,1628.51,"Justice Kagan, did you have a question?"
2015.14-1513,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1628.51,1647.185,"Besides the -- if you were doing this just on policy -- very odd, but you know, we have a test that everybody's off of at this point. And -- and maybe some viewed that what happened in 1952, for some of the reasons that Justice Breyer gave, is perhaps not the most relevant thing."
2015.14-1513,1,56052,roman_martinez,,1651.01,1651.5,Yes.
2015.14-1513,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1681.385,1687.82,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Phillips."
2015.14-1513,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1687.82,1723.84,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Before I get into the substance of my argument, one point that seems to me to cry out, at least in response to the characterizations by my -- from Mr. Wall where he repeatedly described Zimmer's conduct as copying the invention in this case, what -- what the Zimmer Corporation copied was the product itself. The -- the patent wasn't released or issued until two years of that initial copying. There's nothing inherently wrong with finding that a competitor has built a new product, not know anything about the patents or any patentability, no evidence of any patents, and think you're going to copy it --"
2015.14-1513,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1723.84,1724.46,"Well, I thought you said --"
2015.14-1513,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1724.46,1725.65,-- and improve on it. I'm sorry?
2015.14-1513,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1725.65,1727.16,I thought you said the product was marked.
2015.14-1513,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1727.16,1734.6,"After 2000, it was marked. But the -- but the actions taken by Zimmer at the time were 1998, two years before the patent even issued."
2015.14-1513,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1738.97,1741.575,"There had been a patent application, though?"
2015.14-1513,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1741.575,1742.57,Right.
2015.14-1513,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1748.76,1749.345,I'm sorry.
2015.14-1513,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1753.695,1754.85,"Yes, it does."
2015.14-1513,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1754.85,1756.525,So why are you here?
2015.14-1513,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1756.525,1758.01,"If -- no, no, no."
2015.14-1513,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1866.31,1907.445,"My empirical information -- I mean my empirical information -- ha, ha, ha, laughs slightly -- is -- is coming out of the briefs, which you do have to admit has an interest. The -- the -- I have -- I have assumed, and is there stuff that I could look at to back this up -- that in a world of patent and copyright protection, I think it's unfortunate that Congress hasn't passed a special regime for those kinds of patents, but they haven't. In that such -- in that a world like that, we're seeing more and more companies that have more and more, and continuously more patents."
2015.14-1513,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1947.825,1954.54,"Well, the -- the briefs that I thought were particularly effective, Justice Breyer, are the amicus brief of public knowledge and --"
2015.14-1513,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1954.54,1955.44,Of course.
2015.14-1513,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1970.19,1974.17,"Well, Professor Lumley has written on the subject repeatedly, and he --"
2015.14-1513,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1974.17,1984.53,Lumley has also said quite a lot that he's worried about lawyers coming in and inventing various things that make the patent look weak after the event.
2015.14-1513,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1986.31,1986.4,Right.
2015.14-1513,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1986.57,1988.48,He is not totally with you on this.
2015.14-1513,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1988.48,1990.48,But there are -- but there are two separate issues here.
2015.14-1513,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2034.97,2042.115,"Is there a way of compromising this in this way? To say to the circuit, we see your point."
2015.14-1513,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2080.0,2080.57,Justice Breyer --
2015.14-1513,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2080.57,2084.59,What about that? Giving them some leeway around the edges?
2015.14-1513,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2084.59,2093.1,"Justice Breyer, I understand the desire to always be in a position where you can sort of catch that one party that's out there, and I think the real issue there is twofold."
2015.14-1513,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2097.76,2099.195,"Well, leave it to the circuit to decide."
2015.14-1513,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2099.195,2101.03,-- entity -- the circuit's already decided.
2015.14-1513,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2101.39,2108.16,"Well, I have -- they have that squarely facing them, where they had -- where they -- and they did? Did they have that issue that --"
2015.14-1513,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2108.16,2115.24,"Well, I mean, they had the facts in this case where the -- where if -- if you -- if you accept, obviously, the plaintiffs' version of it, there -- there was a fair amount of information --"
2015.14-1513,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2115.24,2115.92,And your other point.
2015.14-1513,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2123.66,2129.185,"I always -- I always appreciate it when you anticipate I'm going to make a good point before I make the good point, but --"
2015.14-1513,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2129.185,2141.2,"Mr. Phillips, I -- I -- there's a whole lot of worry articulated by Justice Breyer and reflected in your briefs about protecting innovation."
2015.14-1513,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2141.2,2141.84,"Yes, Your Honor."
2015.14-1513,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2141.84,2147.315,But there's not a whole lot of worry about protecting the patent owner.
2015.14-1513,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2202.48,2203.37,But let me just say --
2015.14-1513,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2203.37,2203.96,If I'm there --
2015.14-1513,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2203.96,2204.67,-- I think that -- but I guess --
2015.14-1513,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2204.67,2205.86,If I'm there --
2015.14-1513,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2205.86,2206.31,Right.
2015.14-1513,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2206.31,2216.685,-- and I don't think that the Seagate test is -- is -- is appropriate but I am still in the balance of how do we get --
2015.14-1513,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2216.685,2216.975,Right.
2015.14-1513,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2216.975,2225.46,-- a similar protection without an artificial test that I don't think is right --
2015.14-1513,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2225.46,2225.945,Right.
2015.14-1513,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2225.945,2227.42,-- where -- where do I go?
2015.14-1513,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2227.42,2247.42,"Well, let -- let me at least correct one portion of the statement because you said that -- enough to put forward that it's not frivolous. I -- I don't think that's the appropriate standard. Objective reasonableness is the requirement that the Federal Circuit has looked at, and I think that's more than simply the ability to satisfy Rule 11. I think there has to be a substantial defense."
2015.14-1513,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2256.16,2258.73,"Well, the different court called it differently in the second case."
2015.14-1513,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2258.73,2259.1,Right.
2015.14-1513,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2315.74,2315.97,"Well, you are --"
2015.14-1513,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2315.97,2318.26,"That's what makes an extraordinary case. Yes, Your Honor."
2015.14-1513,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2318.61,2321.13,"We are, after all, dealing with statutory language."
2015.14-1513,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2328.15,2328.565,Right.
2015.14-1513,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2328.565,2351.83,"And yet the Federal Circuit standard, you've got -- you know, you've got heightened burdens of proof, particularly articulated. I mean, the way we -- the -- courts have been used to dealing with discretionary standards for a long time. And the way it works is, historically, you know, the exercise of discretion in a lot of cases that, you know, wears a channel which kind of confines the exercise of discretion."
2015.14-1513,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2355.315,2355.67,Right.
2015.14-1513,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2355.89,2361.87,"Over time, this is what discretion has -- has given us in this area, and therefore, you get beyond that, it's an abuse."
2015.14-1513,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2367.85,2375.49,"I -- I -- I understand that, and that's why I think you have to take it one step at a time. First of all, you -- you quoted one portion of the language of -- of 284."
2015.14-1513,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2473.26,2484.11,"But I don't know how far that gets you, Mr. Phillips, because Mr. Martinez just told us that he'd be happy to call willfulness his test. And willfulness has meant different things to different people here."
2015.14-1513,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2484.11,2484.43,Yes.
2015.14-1513,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2484.43,2491.98,"And there's nothing that Congress did that suggests that, when it used that word ""willfulness,"" it really meant the Seagate test."
2015.14-1513,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2491.98,2516.08,"Well, the only test in front of it at the point -- at that point in time was Seagate because Seagate was the definition of what 284 was about and what the standard of willfulness was about. But I think what's equally important, Justice Kagan, is -- I'll -- I'll concede that willfulness can have a lot of different meanings, but the meaning that the Seagate court adopted was the -- was the meaning this Court adopted in Safeco."
2015.14-1513,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2548.46,2548.79,Can we -- can we --
2015.14-1513,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2548.79,2550.73,-- that's the best way to enforce this statute.
2015.14-1513,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2550.73,2563.105,Can we at least peel off the clear and convincing evidence that seems to come out of nowhere and the -- the -- the standard is de novo review rather than abuse of discretion?
2015.14-1513,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2563.105,2572.37,I would -- I would desperately ask you not to take out de novo review because it -- we're talking about an objective standard; it's really almost -- it's essentially a question of law.
2015.14-1513,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2577.09,2577.26,But --
2015.14-1513,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2577.26,2578.58,-- standard that you can deferentially --
2015.14-1513,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2578.58,2580.39,-- how about clear and convincing evidence? You've been --
2015.14-1513,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2580.39,2586.64,"Well, the -- the clear and convincing standard, I don't think is -- is -- is particularly relevant to the -- how this case got decided."
2015.14-1513,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2646.44,2647.785,But you can't have abuse of discretion.
2015.14-1513,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2647.785,2648.455,I'm sorry?
2015.14-1513,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2648.455,2657.585,You -- you care about de novo review in the Federal Circuit rather than testing the district court's determination for abuse of discretion.
2015.14-1513,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2657.585,2658.54,"Yes, Justice Ginsburg."
2015.14-1513,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2708.185,2727.195,"The recklessness decision here seems different from those that generally come up. But maybe you can provide an example where this occurs outside of this context. Usually, to determine whether someone was reckless, you have to assess the -- the nature of the risk, the severity of the risk."
2015.14-1513,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2773.665,2780.91,"Well, I think -- I think the copyright would probably be the other one that sort of attends to it in the same way, because it's essentially the same kind of an inquiry."
2015.14-1513,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2834.82,2837.64,How does it work in tort law?
2015.14-1513,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2837.64,2838.94,"Well, in tort law --"
2015.14-1513,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2838.94,2847.39,"I mean, you can imagine situations where when the actor takes a risk, it looks tremendously great."
2015.14-1513,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2863.13,2866.66,"Well, you take -- I mean, obviously, you take the -- the plaintiff as you --"
2015.14-1513,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2866.66,2866.9,Yeah.
2015.14-1513,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2875.085,2879.74,"Right, but I -- my guess is in those circumstances, Justice Breyer, there aren't punitive damages."
2015.14-1513,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2879.74,2880.35,There are?
2015.14-1513,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2880.35,2881.27,"There are not, because --"
2015.14-1513,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2881.27,2881.52,There are not.
2015.14-1513,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2881.52,2882.52,-- normally act reasonably on --
2015.14-1513,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2882.52,2887.3,"Well, then we would have a -- an analogy on your side, because the other way, it would be an analogy on the other side."
2015.14-1513,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2887.3,2894.39,"Well, let my friend on the other side come forward with tort cases in which the eggshell plaintiff gets punitive damages because the defendant overreacted."
2015.14-1513,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2894.39,2918.36,"Is there any way to allow some consideration for a subjective intent to infringe in an egregious case, as an additional element for -- as an additional way to define willfulness without completely wrecking the Seagate standard?"
2015.14-1513,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2918.36,2928.15,"I -- I think if you -- if you are in a situation where you're past recklessness, that is, there is no defense, there's no objective, they have no -- you know, this is a true pirate."
2015.14-1513,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2953.19,2953.25,No.
2015.14-1513,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2962.795,2964.53,Copy a product or copy a patent?
2015.14-1513,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2964.53,2965.5,A patented product.
2015.14-1513,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2965.5,2965.9,Okay.
2015.14-1513,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2965.9,2974.02,"All right? So same thing, let's call it. Mr. Jones sells a product that involves a patent, and it's selling very well."
2015.14-1513,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3003.23,3004.36,"Well, one of them. (Laughter.)"
2015.14-1513,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3004.36,3014.94,"The fact that he went and said I am going to copy this patent so that I can reap the benefits of some other person's work, that doesn't make a difference."
2015.14-1513,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3020.425,3020.885,Right.
2015.14-1513,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3028.83,3028.98,Right.
2015.14-1513,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3056.685,3056.92,Okay.
2015.14-1513,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3056.92,3061.645,That seems like it's a bad -- that seems like a bad incentive.
2015.14-1513,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3061.645,3062.155,Right.
2015.14-1513,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3128.745,3140.195,"See, the question -- I know this is not exactly a question that we've seen in your briefs, but we see countering in your brief, is there was a company."
2015.14-1513,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3162.44,3163.425,I'm not sure.
2015.14-1513,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3187.85,3188.34,Right.
2015.14-1513,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3188.34,3203.93,"And that's why I'm looking for is there some way we can get the real worst ones without destroying what you don't want to have destroyed and yet, where he's really worried about the real worst ones?"
2015.14-1513,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3203.93,3209.35,"And I think the answer, at the end of the day, is Congress made the choice, I think --"
2015.14-1513,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3209.35,3211.41,"They just used the word ""willful."" I'm not --"
2015.14-1513,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3211.41,3212.14,"No, no."
2015.14-1513,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3242.35,3247.29,"But the -- the -- the choice is reflected in the statute, which leaves a lot of discretion to the district courts."
2015.14-1513,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3272.8,3290.75,"Mr. Chief Justice, I think the problem with that is -- is that it -- unless you come up with -- I mean, I -- you know, recklessness -- I -- or egregiousness -- I don't know what ""egregiousness"" means, and I don't know how you -- how you evaluate that on review. I do know what it means to -- to take an objectively reasonable position."
2015.14-1513,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3354.705,3362.709,"Thank you, Mr. Phillips. Mr. Wall, you have four minutes remaining."
2015.14-1513,3,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,3362.709,3378.32,"Mr. Chief Justice, I have two fairly simple points. The first is, as we and the PTO and many of Respondents' amici recognize, the system as it currently stands is out of balance."
2015.14-1513,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3502.28,3523.005,"One point Mr. Phillips brought up that you didn't address in your initial argument, maybe you could say a word about it, is Section 298 of the American -- America Invents Act. Under your -- under your reading, could evidence of the failure to obtain or introduce advice of counsel be used to prove that the defendant infringed in bad faith?"
2015.14-1513,3,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,3523.005,3523.54,No.
2015.14-1513,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3546.37,3549.17,How do you get to that point under the language of 298?
2015.14-1513,3,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,3549.17,3573.11,"Because 298 just says when you're proving of willfulness, whether it's a factor as it is in our approach, whether it's the end-all, be-all as it is in their approach, whenever the patentee is trying to prove that up, you can't affirmatively put that at issue. And as Pulse candidly, and I think honestly, concedes in its brief, you can read 298 to have effect on either side's view of the -- how you ought to treat the enhancement statute."
2015.14-1513,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3589.315,0.0,"Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted."
