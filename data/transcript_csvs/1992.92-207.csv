1992.92-207,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.207,"We'll hear argument next in 92-207, the United States v. Xavier Padilla."
1992.92-207,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,11.079,14.122,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1992.92-207,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,176.933,186.748,"Mr. Bryson, the Ninth Circuit, as you've described, went off on some notion of standing--"
1992.92-207,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,186.748,186.939,That's right.
1992.92-207,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,186.939,193.613,--Acquired to address the privacy concerns of the Fourth Amendment by virtue of the joint venture.
1992.92-207,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,208.984,210.285,"Well, Your Honor, I--"
1992.92-207,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,210.285,211.646,"--At least, the possessory interest."
1992.92-207,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,211.646,211.826,--Yes.
1992.92-207,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,211.826,214.297,"Now, do we have to deal with that here, or should we?"
1992.92-207,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,214.297,216.17,"I think you should, and here's why."
1992.92-207,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,254.695,259.858,"But Mr. Bryson, the question presented in your cert petition says nothing about ownership as a justification."
1992.92-207,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,259.858,265.594,"Well, Your Honor, we... in our cert petition, we address... we use the language that the court of appeals used."
1992.92-207,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,272.142,276.483,"You probably should, but you said nothing about it and you relied entirely on the joint venture rationale in your question."
1992.92-207,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,276.483,276.694,"Well, Your Honor--"
1992.92-207,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,276.694,277.605,That's the only question you asked.
1992.92-207,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,277.605,292.545,"--The position taken by the court of appeals was that joint venture, which of course in their view incorporated the interest of the Simpsons in the car and the interest of Xavier Padilla in the cocaine, that that... the joint venture, including--"
1992.92-207,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,292.545,295.706,"I know they gave additional reasons, but you didn't challenge one of those reasons."
1992.92-207,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,295.706,304.652,"--Well, Your Honor, we challenged the judgment of the court of appeals which was premised in its finding that there was an expectation of privacy, as they called it--"
1992.92-207,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,304.652,311.097,You think the question directed at one part of the analysis gives you license to just challenge anything about the judgment you want.
1992.92-207,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,311.097,312.91,"--Your Honor, I think there are two points to be made."
1992.92-207,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,321.107,324.33,"But you didn't challenge that part of their reasoning, is my point."
1992.92-207,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,324.33,329.456,"--Well, Your Honor, I think a fair reading of our petition is that we did, and what's more... and there's a second reason."
1992.92-207,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,358.724,364.697,"Well, does the Government take the position that the ownership of a car does not give the owner a right to challenge the seizure of the car?"
1992.92-207,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,364.697,368.471,"--Your Honor, we... the answer is yes and no."
1992.92-207,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,370.113,370.283,Yes and no.
1992.92-207,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,370.283,370.604,--Yes.
1992.92-207,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,383.994,385.363,But do you deny that a stop is a seizure?
1992.92-207,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,385.363,390.758,"--This particular stop was a seizure, but it did not affect the ownership interests--"
1992.92-207,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,390.758,391.798,But was it a seizure of the car?
1992.92-207,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,391.798,393.891,--It was a seizure of the car.
1992.92-207,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,395.611,398.543,"But the owner doesn't have standing to challenge it because it didn't hurt him right at the time, is that the point?"
1992.92-207,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,398.543,398.703,--Exactly.
1992.92-207,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,430.846,443.595,"Suppose the Government had loaned... suppose the car had been loaned for a week, and the Government seized it and then kept it for only 6 days, couldn't you say the same thing?"
1992.92-207,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,443.595,446.957,"--Well, if it had been loaned for a week... suppose it's a rental car, to make it--"
1992.92-207,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,446.957,447.897,Right.
1992.92-207,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,447.897,469.641,"--And the rental agreement was that after 7 days it should be returned, and in fact the car was returned on the seventh day... the Government had held it for 6 days in between... we would say that the effect on the person who rented the car, the renter of the car, the rental company, was that their property interests in the car were not affected."
1992.92-207,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,492.971,495.143,What about their privacy interest in the car?
1992.92-207,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,504.86,515.187,"Well, if there's a privacy interest, then the privacy interest is... and they have retained a privacy interest in the car, then they may well have a basis for objecting to the search of the car but not to the seizure."
1992.92-207,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,515.187,517.899,But possession and privacy go together.
1992.92-207,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,525.766,553.184,"Your Honor, where, as in this case, all that happens is that you hold the goods and you don't conduct a search at all... in this case there was a consent search, which waived, in effect, the privacy interests of the Simpsons in the trunk, whatever those might have been, but if all that would happen in this case is that there had been a stop, and let's say Arciniega had made a confession which implicated the Simpsons, then no privacy interest in the car would have been implicated."
1992.92-207,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,602.671,618.791,"Well, Mr. Bryson, don't our cases generally in the Fourth Amendment area say that the privacy interest is protected against seizures and the property... the privacy is to protect against searches, and the privacy interest is... the property interest is to protect it against seizures?"
1992.92-207,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,618.791,646.95,"--Yes, that's right, and here, we... there was a seizure which affected the property interest of, control of the car of Arciniega, temporary possessory interest, but he doesn't... he's not a defendant, so he would have standing to object, but the privacy concerns which are with regard to the search of the trunk of the car are at minimum waived by Arciniega's agreement to allow the search of the trunk."
1992.92-207,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,646.95,652.803,"Well, Mr. Bryson, I thought that the respondents say that there wasn't consent here."
1992.92-207,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,655.536,655.726,No.
1992.92-207,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,657.456,658.647,So we're not in a position--
1992.92-207,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,658.647,658.798,--No.
1992.92-207,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,658.798,660.638,--To answer that.
1992.92-207,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,660.638,660.928,That's right.
1992.92-207,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,661.659,672.578,"I mean, you would acknowledge that based on the district court's finding that the Simpsons had a privacy interest in the trunk, and the question of consent is open."
1992.92-207,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,672.578,674.7,"--I think the question of consent is open, Your Honor."
1992.92-207,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,691.551,695.023,"Well, then do you say that we have to remand in this case?"
1992.92-207,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,696.676,719.589,"--Well, I think that you're going to have to remand... assuming we win the major submission in the case, you will have to remand for a disposition of the remaining claims and ultimately for trial, and I think... there has not been a final disposition by the court of appeals, for example, of the consent issue, and there's a finding by--"
1992.92-207,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,719.589,729.567,What difference does it make if... to the Simpsons' interest if Mr. Arciniega's consent is valid or not?
1992.92-207,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,729.567,752.775,"--This is this difference, I think: if the Simpsons did not retain any privacy interest, even a joint privacy interest with Arciniega in the trunk of the car... let's... suppose this had been a search of the front seat, where the officer had stopped Arciniega and just looked in the front seat and there was all the cocaine, we would argue, and we would be right, that the Simpsons just had no continuing privacy interest in the front seat of the car."
1992.92-207,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,771.905,773.377,"Well, do you think--"
1992.92-207,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,773.377,773.866,--If that's true--
1992.92-207,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,773.866,775.017,--Go ahead.
1992.92-207,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,775.017,778.861,"--We don't think that's right, but we do have a district court finding to that effect."
1992.92-207,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,794.661,803.196,"Well, my suggestion is that even if the consent is invalid as to Arciniega, the Simpsons get no benefit from that."
1992.92-207,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,803.196,806.719,They don't if they did not retain a privacy interest in the trunk of the car.
1992.92-207,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,808.121,812.756,"Okay, now tell me about how we go about determining whether they retain a privacy interest in the right of the car."
1992.92-207,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,814.388,817.01,"--Well, Your Honor, I think you have to look at--"
1992.92-207,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,817.01,819.702,"--Or at the criminal enterprise, as the Ninth Circuit suggested?"
1992.92-207,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,819.702,826.877,"--You would have to look at such things as the terms of the bailment, you would have to look at whether in the view of--"
1992.92-207,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,826.877,829.489,"Well, how is the officer to know this when he makes his stop?"
1992.92-207,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,829.489,842.645,"--Well, the officer is not going to know it, and typically the officer will be in a position of having apparent authority to go into the trunk, so even if the person who's driving the car--"
1992.92-207,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,842.645,842.806,The driver would have.
1992.92-207,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,842.806,844.758,"--Doesn't have actual authority, he may have apparent authority."
1992.92-207,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,865.853,872.658,"Well, I don't understand how an officer is supposed to know whether someone else has retained privacy interests in the trunk."
1992.92-207,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,876.471,893.432,"--If he had... if he's in a situation where it's reasonable for the officer to assume that somebody who's driving a car has authority to consent to the search of the trunk, then the officer's acted reasonably if he obtains the consent in a valid fashion."
1992.92-207,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,893.432,896.483,Is it reasonable for officers to do that if they know someone else owns the car?
1992.92-207,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,896.483,908.141,"Typically it will be, yes, because they will assume that somebody who is driving a car and is in the middle of the highway has authority to go into the trunk, particularly if he's been given the keys, as was the case here."
1992.92-207,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,910.264,911.244,"Well then, why don't you win?"
1992.92-207,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,913.207,918.492,"--Well, we think we do win if this Court wants to make a finding with respect to the validity of the consent."
1992.92-207,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,927.81,933.113,"Well, I'm confused as to how we determine if someone... some third-person owner has some retained privacy interest in the trunk."
1992.92-207,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,933.113,933.353,--Well--
1992.92-207,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,933.353,941.06,"It seems to me there's a question of whether or not an officer acts reasonably, and whether this is a legitimate interest that we're prepared to recognize or not."
1992.92-207,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,941.06,943.089,"--Well, if the officer--"
1992.92-207,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,943.089,947.953,Some third... we can assume that most cars riding around out there have third persons' property interest in them.
1992.92-207,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,950.606,951.066,--Not--
1992.92-207,1,45715,walter_b_nash_iii,,1726.759,1732.282,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1992.92-207,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1762.472,1768.428,"Well, how does a policeman know that he's either searching or seizing when he stops to question a suspect who's driving an automobile?"
1992.92-207,1,45715,walter_b_nash_iii,,1768.428,1769.268,--He always--
1992.92-207,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1769.268,1771.28,There's obviously been a detention of the property.
1992.92-207,1,45715,walter_b_nash_iii,,1772.702,1773.102,"--Yes, sir."
1992.92-207,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1786.97,1795.596,"Well, you say the district judge just focused on the illegal stop of the car and that everything else was illegal after that."
1992.92-207,1,45715,walter_b_nash_iii,,1803.142,1803.833,Exactly.
1992.92-207,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1804.374,1805.596,"Well, that's the question, so--"
1992.92-207,1,45715,walter_b_nash_iii,,1805.596,1805.796,--That's the issue.
1992.92-207,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1806.895,1822.717,"--And if no one else except the driver had standing to challenge the stop, your clients should lose the case."
1992.92-207,1,45715,walter_b_nash_iii,,1822.717,1825.138,"Under that hypothetical, that's correct."
1992.92-207,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1825.138,1825.328,Right.
1992.92-207,1,45715,walter_b_nash_iii,,1825.328,1831.153,But both Mr. Padilla and Mr. and Mrs. Simpson had a possessory or property right in both the car and its contents.
1992.92-207,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1831.153,1832.663,"Well, suppose the stop were lawful?"
1992.92-207,1,45715,walter_b_nash_iii,,1832.663,1835.395,If the initial stop were lawful--
1992.92-207,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1835.395,1835.906,And so then--
1992.92-207,1,45715,walter_b_nash_iii,,1835.906,1841.378,--Then the issue as to the seizure of the car would not be subject to further argument.
1992.92-207,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1843.031,1845.182,"--Well, then it's not just a question of seizure."
1992.92-207,1,45715,walter_b_nash_iii,,1845.182,1859.232,"--Well, the way the question is postured to this Court, it is, because the only issue that was ruled on in the district court and in the Ninth Circuit was the seizure of the car, not the consent, not the other things, except insofar as they were tainted."
1992.92-207,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1876.661,1885.627,"But it seems to me, first things first, because you've conceded that if the stop were lawful and the consent were lawful, then there would be no question of seizure--"
1992.92-207,1,45715,walter_b_nash_iii,,1885.627,1886.519,--Under that--
1992.92-207,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1886.519,1889.582,--So I question the district court's and the Ninth Circuit's approach.
1992.92-207,1,45715,walter_b_nash_iii,,1889.582,1897.827,"--Well, we always have to begin with the first level of intrusion, and the first level of intrusion is almost always the stopping of the vehicle or the person."
1992.92-207,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1907.163,1913.817,"If you're right about that, Mr. Nash, why did the Ninth Circuit reverse as to Strubbe?"
1992.92-207,1,45715,walter_b_nash_iii,,1916.929,1931.151,"Because what the Ninth Circuit said was Mr. Strubbe had not claimed and could never show any possessory interest in either the contraband or in the vehicle, nor could he show, or did he attempt to show, any right to privacy."
1992.92-207,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1939.856,1940.765,"Well, the way--"
1992.92-207,1,45715,walter_b_nash_iii,,1940.765,1946.531,"--The rule is not mere membership in a joint venture, ipso facto, confers standing on a litigant."
1992.92-207,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1955.477,1959.27,"--That isn't what the court of appeals said in its opinion, as I read it."
1992.92-207,1,45715,walter_b_nash_iii,,1986.64,1994.835,"It does, and let me suggest to the Court two reasons why it does, and first of all, it is clear that the Ninth Circuit does not go off solely on an expectation of privacy."
1992.92-207,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2052.033,2061.3,"Mr. Nash, the question presented in the Government's petition for certiorari plainly raises the joint venture issue and nothing else, as far as I'm concerned--"
1992.92-207,1,45715,walter_b_nash_iii,,2061.3,2061.57,That's correct.
1992.92-207,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2061.57,2067.362,--Whether membership in a joint venture to transport drugs gives coconspirators a legitimate expectation of privacy.
1992.92-207,1,45715,walter_b_nash_iii,,2082.545,2083.386,It does two things.
1992.92-207,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2089.79,2091.371,I'm not talking about the briefs of counsel.
1992.92-207,1,45715,walter_b_nash_iii,,2100.879,2103.742,--Mr. Padilla's opposition did not squarely raise it.
1992.92-207,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2111.699,2114.981,I think you can answer this question yes or no.
1992.92-207,1,45715,walter_b_nash_iii,,2124.498,2125.988,--Mr. Simpson did in his opposition.
1992.92-207,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2125.988,2126.368,Where did he do that?
1992.92-207,1,45715,walter_b_nash_iii,,2126.368,2135.485,His counsel has indicated to me that it's found at page 10 of his prose opposition to the petition for writ of certiorari.
1992.92-207,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2159.339,2161.122,Would you show me where on page 10?
1992.92-207,1,45715,walter_b_nash_iii,,2177.975,2178.165,I'm looking at--
1992.92-207,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2178.165,2180.045,"I thought that's what we were going to talk about today, and you tell--"
1992.92-207,1,45715,walter_b_nash_iii,,2180.045,2180.376,--I'm looking at page 10.
1992.92-207,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2180.376,2180.656,--Yes.
1992.92-207,1,45715,walter_b_nash_iii,,2180.656,2184.429,"Page 10, which starts... the paragraph beginning at line 24,"
1992.92-207,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2191.823,2193.085,Yes.
1992.92-207,1,45715,walter_b_nash_iii,,2193.085,2196.057,That is the square issue that we're talking about.
1992.92-207,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2196.057,2196.237,"No, no."
1992.92-207,1,45715,walter_b_nash_iii,,2210.809,2212.482,If this is a seizure case--
1992.92-207,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2212.482,2218.826,"Would you show me where that appears in anybody's brief, or otherwise say, as far as you know, it does not appear in anybody's opposition?"
1992.92-207,1,45715,walter_b_nash_iii,,2218.826,2227.712,"--To say that, in the opposition of Mr. Simpson to the petition for writ of certiorari, that the Government overlooks the difference between a seizure which doesn't involve a right to privacy, that is the issue."
1992.92-207,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2229.335,2230.787,That's a quite different point.
1992.92-207,1,45715,walter_b_nash_iii,,2238.032,2238.203,--Yes.
1992.92-207,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2238.203,2238.693,We understand that.
1992.92-207,1,45715,walter_b_nash_iii,,2238.693,2238.854,Yes.
1992.92-207,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2238.854,2239.852,But that's not the point you were making.
1992.92-207,1,45715,walter_b_nash_iii,,2245.836,2247.238,What I am saying is that--
1992.92-207,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2247.238,2249.541,"If you could answer that yes or no, Mr. Nash."
1992.92-207,1,45715,walter_b_nash_iii,,2249.541,2250.761,"--Yes, sir, it is in the case."
1992.92-207,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2250.761,2252.533,"Okay, it is in the case."
1992.92-207,1,45715,walter_b_nash_iii,,2252.533,2253.763,It's raised in the case.
1992.92-207,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2303.518,2318.807,Assume we agree with the Government that this joint enterprise theory doesn't give standing to the members of the conspiracy without more?
1992.92-207,1,45715,walter_b_nash_iii,,2324.031,2324.662,"Yes, sir."
1992.92-207,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2324.662,2337.191,"Namely... but if we agree with the Government on that, it seems to... on their submission about the joint enterprise, it seems to me the only people who might have standing to complain would be the Simpsons--"
1992.92-207,1,45715,walter_b_nash_iii,,2337.191,2337.581,"No, sir."
1992.92-207,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2337.581,2338.002,--Who own the car.
1992.92-207,1,45715,walter_b_nash_iii,,2338.002,2342.316,"No, sir, because that overlooks the interest in a possessory right to the contraband."
1992.92-207,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2361.429,2372.125,"Well, let's assume that the driver of the car owned the car, and let's assume that the consent was valid to open the trunk."
1992.92-207,1,45715,walter_b_nash_iii,,2381.402,2382.243,That's correct.
1992.92-207,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2382.243,2382.801,And--
1992.92-207,1,45715,walter_b_nash_iii,,2382.801,2387.617,"If under that hypothetical, which is not this case, you would be correct."
1992.92-207,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2387.617,2397.732,"--Well, that would be this case if we say that the Simpsons don't have... just because of their ownership don't have standing to object at all."
1992.92-207,1,45715,walter_b_nash_iii,,2397.732,2400.562,"Under that hypothetical, that would be correct."
1992.92-207,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2400.562,2400.763,Right.
1992.92-207,1,45715,walter_b_nash_iii,,2400.763,2403.006,But the Simpsons are clearly the owner of the car.
1992.92-207,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2413.024,2413.264,Well--
1992.92-207,1,45715,walter_b_nash_iii,,2413.264,2414.065,Just--
1992.92-207,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2414.065,2421.481,"--If we don't agree with that, why the seizure of the cocaine is not challengeable."
1992.92-207,1,45715,walter_b_nash_iii,,2421.481,2427.157,"--And assuming the validity of the consent, which is an issue that has to get, perhaps, sent back to the district court."
1992.92-207,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2427.157,2434.861,"Suppose that Arciniega was going 90 miles an hour, and he was stopped... a valid stop, correct?"
1992.92-207,1,45715,walter_b_nash_iii,,2434.861,2436.033,"Yes, sir."
1992.92-207,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2436.033,2439.602,"And the police said, may we search the trunk of your car, and he said, yes."
1992.92-207,1,45715,walter_b_nash_iii,,2441.205,2444.708,"If we assume also the validity of the consent, yes, it is."
1992.92-207,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2444.708,2449.139,"And at that point, isn't the case over and the Simpsons lose?"
1992.92-207,1,45715,walter_b_nash_iii,,2449.139,2449.34,Yes.
1992.92-207,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2452.632,2453.063,"Why, then, isn't this a search case?"
1992.92-207,1,45715,walter_b_nash_iii,,2453.063,2461.04,"--Because this case, number 1, involves a search that is, by the Government's own tacit admission by not challenging it on appeal, invalid."
1992.92-207,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2467.563,2474.798,What standing do the Simpsons have to raise the violations of Arciniega's rights--
1992.92-207,1,45715,walter_b_nash_iii,,2474.798,2475.529,Because it was--
1992.92-207,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2475.529,2476.868,--When he's been invalidly stopped?
1992.92-207,1,45715,walter_b_nash_iii,,2476.868,2481.833,"--Because it was their car, sir, and they also had a possessory interest in the contraband."
1992.92-207,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2491.729,2496.581,Don't our cases say that you can't have a legitimate possessory interest in contraband?
1992.92-207,1,45715,walter_b_nash_iii,,2496.581,2498.223,They do not for standing purposes.
1992.92-207,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2507.622,2509.094,Which of our cases is that?
1992.92-207,1,45715,walter_b_nash_iii,,2509.094,2511.356,Trupiano was one of the ones that's cited in the briefs.
1992.92-207,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2516.988,2519.299,Trupiano was largely overruled by Rabinowitz.
1992.92-207,1,45715,walter_b_nash_iii,,2519.299,2521.66,But not squarely on that point.
1992.92-207,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2532.739,2538.584,Do you have any case stronger than what remains of Trupiano to support your position?
1992.92-207,1,45715,walter_b_nash_iii,,2541.358,2543.088,Jeffers also says the same thing.
1992.92-207,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2543.088,2543.338,"Jeffers, okay."
1992.92-207,1,45715,walter_b_nash_iii,,2578.613,2580.614,But they could have a possessory interest in it.
1992.92-207,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2580.614,2582.356,"No, but that begs the question."
1992.92-207,1,45715,walter_b_nash_iii,,2608.615,2614.529,"But possession does not require ownership, it merely requires a measure of control and intent to control."
1992.92-207,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2614.529,2622.704,"Well, and what's... where do you get the power to control something which you do not have in your physical possession if you do not, in fact, own it?"
1992.92-207,1,45715,walter_b_nash_iii,,2622.704,2624.664,By merely possessing it.
1992.92-207,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2624.664,2627.155,"But they're not... no, but that begs the question."
1992.92-207,1,45715,walter_b_nash_iii,,2631.89,2632.699,"Yes, sir."
1992.92-207,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2632.699,2633.09,Okay.
1992.92-207,1,45715,walter_b_nash_iii,,2638.764,2639.575,"Yes, sir."
1992.92-207,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2639.575,2648.951,"Isn't it an element of constructive possession that you must have a... some sort of right to exercise dominion and control, even though it is not in your presence?"
1992.92-207,1,45715,walter_b_nash_iii,,2648.951,2649.732,"Yes, sir."
1992.92-207,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2649.732,2658.317,And do we not usually find that right to exercise dominion control in title or property to the goods or to the object in question?
1992.92-207,1,45715,walter_b_nash_iii,,2658.317,2660.088,It can be found from title.
1992.92-207,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2661.83,2662.909,Where else do you get it?
1992.92-207,1,45715,walter_b_nash_iii,,2662.909,2665.441,--You can get it from someone bailing it to you.
1992.92-207,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2670.676,2676.921,"Well, it seems to me that that just pushes the difficulty further off, because the bailor doesn't have any possession at that point--"
1992.92-207,1,45715,walter_b_nash_iii,,2676.921,2677.99,"--Well, the bailor--"
1992.92-207,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2677.99,2689.136,"--And if the bailor's only possession is constructive, then you've got the same problem with the bailor that you have if you deal with people in the Simpsons' position right now."
1992.92-207,1,45715,walter_b_nash_iii,,2693.39,2700.435,"--If this Court chooses to find that one can never, as a matter of law, have a possessory interest in contraband, then your hypothetical is correct."
1992.92-207,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2700.435,2707.208,"All we have to find, it seems to me, is that you may not have title or ownership in contraband, and I thought that's where we were at the present time."
1992.92-207,1,45715,walter_b_nash_iii,,2707.208,2710.732,"Well, one can possess something, my argument is, without necessary owning it."
1992.92-207,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2710.732,2711.763,"Well, I agree with you."
1992.92-207,1,45715,walter_b_nash_iii,,2711.763,2730.643,"The Government urges that an absentee owner can never claim any type of proper possessory interest, and with regard to the vehicle and with the contraband, once we assume the correctness of my position on the possession versus ownership issue, it's simply not valid."
1992.92-207,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2756.132,2759.445,"In both of those cases, one was Federal Express, the other an airline."
1992.92-207,1,45715,walter_b_nash_iii,,2765.487,2767.379,"That's clear, and that's--"
1992.92-207,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2767.379,2767.559,But--
1992.92-207,1,45715,walter_b_nash_iii,,2767.559,2775.973,"--That is exactly this case, with even more control exerted over the bailee by the bailor than was found in the Federal Express example."
1992.92-207,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2775.973,2784.138,--So are you saying that any time the police stop an automobile and find that it's registered to a different owner that there can be no consent given by the driver?
1992.92-207,1,45715,walter_b_nash_iii,,2784.138,2785.18,"Absolutely not, sir."
1992.92-207,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2980.072,2981.294,"Thank you, Mr. Nash."
