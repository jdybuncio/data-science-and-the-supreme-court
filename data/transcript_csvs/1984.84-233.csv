1984.84-233,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,7.154,"We will hear arguments next in Phillips Petroleum Company against Shutts, et al.--"
1984.84-233,0,16545,arthur_r_miller,,90.391,94.962,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1984.84-233,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,266.589,276.362,So this would just... your submission is that that is just a limit on plaintiff class actions?
1984.84-233,0,16545,arthur_r_miller,,276.362,297.959,"Our position, Justice White, is that although those cases which I have described do speak in terms of the defendant, because the party to be affected in those cases were defendants, that that same principle must be applied to non-resident class members."
1984.84-233,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,297.959,301.18,And it isn't enough just to give them an option to opt-out?
1984.84-233,0,16545,arthur_r_miller,,301.18,303.13,Absolutely not.
1984.84-233,1,31305,joel_i_klein,,1658.744,1678.89,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the standing issue in this case is not merely whether Phillips may raise the constitutional rights of others, but whether Phillips may raise the rights of absent class members to defeat a recovery in their favor that was obtained against Phillips."
1984.84-233,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1678.89,1689.698,"Mr. Klein, did the respondents challenge petitioners' standing to raise this question over non-resident plaintiffs in the Kansas courts?"
1984.84-233,1,31305,joel_i_klein,,1689.698,1690.598,"Yes, we did, Your Honor."
1984.84-233,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1692.9,1697.804,And did the Kansas courts nevertheless reach and resolve the jurisdiction question?
1984.84-233,1,31305,joel_i_klein,,1697.804,1700.589,The Kansas courts did reach and resolve the jurisdictional question.
1984.84-233,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1700.589,1707.409,"Well, is that sufficient, then, for us to exercise discretion to reach it under Craig versus Boren?"
1984.84-233,1,31305,joel_i_klein,,1707.409,1708.559,"Absolutely not, Your Honor."
1984.84-233,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1743.499,1747.468,And you think this Court doesn't even have discretion to reach the issue?
1984.84-233,1,31305,joel_i_klein,,1747.468,1754.907,"I do not think... on established case law it doesn't, Your Honor, and I think the reason is that no case has ever gone in this direction."
1984.84-233,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1789.378,1798.333,"Well, Mr. Miller's argument is that that isn't always going to happen, and in a case where the defendant prevails, there may be some problems with the absent plaintiff."
1984.84-233,1,31305,joel_i_klein,,1798.333,1801.619,"There may be, Your Honor, and in that case I assume we may hear from them."
1984.84-233,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1803.221,1811.125,But how do you decide this sort of an issue when the time comes for a motion to certify at the beginning of the case in the state court?
1984.84-233,1,31305,joel_i_klein,,1811.125,1816.945,"Well, at the beginning of the case in the state court, in Kansas as in the federal court, all parties have a right to raise the issue."
1984.84-233,2,16545,arthur_r_miller,,3297.104,3299.04,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice."
