1987.86-1145,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.356,"We'll hear argument next in number 86-1145, Timothy A. Patrick versus William M. Burget."
1987.86-1145,0,17806,barbee_b_lyon,,64.156,67.977,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1987.86-1145,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,276.926,289.52,Is there no mechanism in Oregon in your view for a judicial review of the deprivation of the privilege to restore that privilege?
1987.86-1145,0,17806,barbee_b_lyon,,289.52,291.286,Certainly no clear review.
1987.86-1145,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,304.844,307.029,So perhaps that power exists?
1987.86-1145,0,17806,barbee_b_lyon,,307.029,310.23,Perhaps that power might exist.
1987.86-1145,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,310.23,313.615,It wasn't pursued by your client here?
1987.86-1145,0,17806,barbee_b_lyon,,313.615,315.151,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1987.86-1145,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,315.151,316.084,So we don't know.
1987.86-1145,0,17806,barbee_b_lyon,,316.084,317.419,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1987.86-1145,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,317.419,322.823,"Now, I guess there is a State action for interference with business relations?"
1987.86-1145,0,17806,barbee_b_lyon,,322.823,323.073,That is.
1987.86-1145,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,326.441,328.441,And that also was not pursued?
1987.86-1145,0,17806,barbee_b_lyon,,328.441,329.559,That was pursued.
1987.86-1145,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,336.48,345.419,"Is that a form of State supervision in a sense, do you think, to provide that kind of an action?"
1987.86-1145,0,17806,barbee_b_lyon,,345.419,348.069,"Your Honor, this Court has never so held."
1987.86-1145,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,555.173,563.778,"Mr. Lyon, what supervision does the State of Oregon maintain over this group, the peer group?"
1987.86-1145,0,17806,barbee_b_lyon,,563.778,565.978,"I maintain none at all, Your Honor."
1987.86-1145,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,566.811,568.461,Is there anything in the Statute about it?
1987.86-1145,0,17806,barbee_b_lyon,,568.461,570.513,"I say there isn't, Your Honor."
1987.86-1145,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,570.513,573.732,"Is there anything in any rule about it, State rule?"
1987.86-1145,0,17806,barbee_b_lyon,,573.732,575.232,"No rules that I know of, Your Honor."
1987.86-1145,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,575.232,580.386,It's your position that they just turn it over to the peer committee and forget about it?
1987.86-1145,0,17806,barbee_b_lyon,,580.386,582.519,"That's true, Your Honor."
1987.86-1145,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,623.013,625.915,It is a State created body?
1987.86-1145,0,17806,barbee_b_lyon,,625.915,629.783,"The peer review committee is, Your Honor--"
1987.86-1145,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,629.783,632.919,"It is a State-created body by statute, isn't it?"
1987.86-1145,0,17806,barbee_b_lyon,,632.919,637.52,--The peer review committees are not creatures of Statute.
1987.86-1145,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,648.244,650.28,With or without the approval of the State--
1987.86-1145,0,17806,barbee_b_lyon,,650.28,655.6,The State does not intervene in the appointment of these committees in any way.
1987.86-1145,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,655.6,658.284,--Did the State create it?
1987.86-1145,0,17806,barbee_b_lyon,,662.938,668.14,"It doesn't seem to me that it is, because the hospital creates them."
1987.86-1145,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,668.14,669.64,I'm not interested in your views.
1987.86-1145,0,17806,barbee_b_lyon,,670.923,674.977,"It is the hospital that creates the peer review committees, Your Honor."
1987.86-1145,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,674.977,678.262,And the State has no regard to that at all?
1987.86-1145,0,17806,barbee_b_lyon,,678.262,680.448,It has no authority to mandate--
1987.86-1145,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,680.448,682.698,Does the State supervise the hospital?
1987.86-1145,0,17806,barbee_b_lyon,,682.698,686.767,--The State Health Division has supervisory authority over the hospital.
1987.86-1145,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,686.767,691.236,"Well, why wouldn't that give them authority over the peer committee?"
1987.86-1145,0,17806,barbee_b_lyon,,691.236,703.563,Because all that the State statute gives the Health Division the power to do is to see to it to assure that the trustees have adopted procedures for peer review.
1987.86-1145,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,718.656,725.827,"That's what worries me, that the State does have supervision."
1987.86-1145,0,17806,barbee_b_lyon,,732.646,753.208,"There's been no reported case, there's no evidence in this record that any agency of the State ever did anything, there's no reported case in which any State agency has ever intervened in any way in any peer review decision in any matter in the State of Oregon."
1987.86-1145,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,920.034,944.399,"Mr. Lyon, do you think that in order to fit under the Parker-Brown exception, there has to be a cadre of State officials that actually review each decision of the peer review committee and have the chance to second guess those committees?"
1987.86-1145,0,17806,barbee_b_lyon,,944.399,947.434,"--Well, certainly not each decision has to be reviewed."
1987.86-1145,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,960.759,963.861,Did you look at the AMA filed brief in this case?
1987.86-1145,0,17806,barbee_b_lyon,,963.861,964.611,"--Yes, I did, Your Honor."
1987.86-1145,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,964.611,972.983,And do you think the alternative recommendations given in that brief are satisfactory in your view?
1987.86-1145,0,17806,barbee_b_lyon,,972.983,975.251,"No, Your Honor, I don't think--"
1987.86-1145,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,975.251,975.568,Why not?
1987.86-1145,0,17806,barbee_b_lyon,,975.568,977.036,--I beg your pardon?
1987.86-1145,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,977.036,977.786,Why not?
1987.86-1145,0,17806,barbee_b_lyon,,977.786,1016.511,"Because unless there is a procedure in a case whereby the particular result in a particular case can be challenged, can be reviewed by the State to see that the State policy is being carried out, the State policy of bettering patient care, of reducing mortality, then without a system in place for permitting that, then there is no way for the... as this Court said... the pointed reexamination of each case, of the events that go on to take place."
1987.86-1145,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1145.725,1148.041,"Thank you, Mr. Lyon."
1987.86-1145,1,43384,thomas_m_triplett,,1150.227,1154.247,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1987.86-1145,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1310.414,1314.966,Was it the State policy to reduce the number of doctors practicing in the State.
1987.86-1145,1,43384,thomas_m_triplett,,1314.966,1325.423,The net effect of that policy would be to reduce those doctors who ought not continue to practice.
1987.86-1145,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1337.064,1357.542,"I think all that you've described shows that there's been State action, but as I understood the State action defense in antitrust law, it was that this particular result which the Federal antitrust law declares to be unlawful, if that result is declared to be lawful by the State, then it's all right."
1987.86-1145,1,43384,thomas_m_triplett,,1384.84,1394.381,The State did direct hospitals to cause doctors to review doctors at the hospital level.
1987.86-1145,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1412.842,1414.794,Because of their incompetency.
1987.86-1145,1,43384,thomas_m_triplett,,1417.83,1420.096,"--That's right, because of their incompetence."
1987.86-1145,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1472.981,1476.099,Does that apply to all doctors or just surgeons?
1987.86-1145,1,43384,thomas_m_triplett,,1477.999,1480.9,All doctors who are members of the medical--
1987.86-1145,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1480.9,1487.638,--Normally do all doctors have to have hospital contacts in order to practice.
1987.86-1145,1,43384,thomas_m_triplett,,1487.638,1487.89,--No.
1987.86-1145,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1487.89,1489.056,They do?
1987.86-1145,1,43384,thomas_m_triplett,,1489.056,1489.856,They do not.
1987.86-1145,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1489.856,1491.192,That's what I thought.
1987.86-1145,1,43384,thomas_m_triplett,,1491.192,1492.242,There are a number of--
1987.86-1145,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1492.242,1493.125,But surgeons do.
1987.86-1145,1,43384,thomas_m_triplett,,1493.125,1493.81,--That is correct.
1987.86-1145,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1495.794,1498.096,"Well, shouldn't we make a difference there?"
1987.86-1145,1,43384,thomas_m_triplett,,1498.096,1525.679,"The doctors who are not part of a medical staff are subject to the ongoing review of the Board of Medical Examiners, and upon complaint by a private citizen, complaint of a fellow practitioner, or any other person, they will then inspect the practice of that doctor to determine whether he or she should continue to practice medicine in the State of Oregon."
1987.86-1145,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1525.679,1539.673,"May I ask if a peer review committee determines that a doctor is not fit to practice in a particular hospital, does the committee have any duty to institute proceedings to exclude the doctor from the practice of medicine?"
1987.86-1145,1,43384,thomas_m_triplett,,1539.673,1552.081,The hospital has the responsibility if there is an adverse determination in peer review to report that to the Board of Medical Examiners.
1987.86-1145,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1584.052,1585.237,Did that happen in this case?
1987.86-1145,1,43384,thomas_m_triplett,,1585.237,1585.904,--Excuse me?
1987.86-1145,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1585.904,1587.37,Did that happen in this case?
1987.86-1145,1,43384,thomas_m_triplett,,1587.37,1595.76,"No, because Dr. Patrick resigned before any decision was made by the Hearing Committee of the Hospital."
1987.86-1145,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1595.76,1596.776,He resigned from what?
1987.86-1145,1,43384,thomas_m_triplett,,1596.776,1599.212,He resigned privileges from the Hospital.
1987.86-1145,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1607.9,1615.804,"Mr. Triplett, was there evidence that Dr. Patrick had performed some 2,000 or 3,000 operations?"
1987.86-1145,1,43384,thomas_m_triplett,,1615.804,1617.339,Two thousand... twenty-five hundred.
1987.86-1145,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1617.339,1619.489,Over what period of time--
1987.86-1145,1,43384,thomas_m_triplett,,1619.489,1621.791,Over a period of approximately ten years.
1987.86-1145,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1621.791,1640.186,"--But Mr. Triplett, even if he had resigned his privileges at the hospital, if he got adverse peer review recommendations, wouldn't that lead the State Examining Board to inquire into his competency to continue to practice?"
1987.86-1145,1,43384,thomas_m_triplett,,1640.186,1656.696,There was no report that I am aware of made subsequent to his resignation from the hospital to the Board of Medical Examiners that would then invoke their authority.
1987.86-1145,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1656.696,1664.051,"In other words, they wouldn't act on the report that was sent to them by the peer review committee to look into his fitness to continue practicing?"
1987.86-1145,1,43384,thomas_m_triplett,,1666.753,1668.036,Let me explain.
1987.86-1145,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1739.283,1746.003,"Mr. Triplett, you're explaining why you think he should have exhausted before he filed a lawsuit against your clients."
1987.86-1145,1,43384,thomas_m_triplett,,1772.254,1773.606,He ought not to.
1987.86-1145,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1773.606,1775.123,"Well, then why did he?"
1987.86-1145,1,43384,thomas_m_triplett,,1775.123,1793.25,"Your Honor, in this case, the decision to bring him to a hearing was made in March of 1981 by the Executive Committee of the Hospital."
1987.86-1145,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1837.513,1844.285,"I suppose you don't if you're interested in defending a lawsuit, but if you're interested in getting rid of incompetent doctors, I think you do."
1987.86-1145,1,43384,thomas_m_triplett,,1853.807,1869.666,"--I can report to you that with respect to the Snodgrass incident which is the one that triggered the hospital peer review, that that was reported."
1987.86-1145,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1968.08,1969.766,We had a jury trial about that.
1987.86-1145,1,43384,thomas_m_triplett,,1990.029,1992.797,There's no question that that's how the jury saw it.
1987.86-1145,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1992.797,2003.403,I think that the state action claim you're making goes beyond what our cases have held.
1987.86-1145,1,43384,thomas_m_triplett,,2056.252,2063.005,I know the Court has debated whether the issue here is exemption or preemption.
1987.86-1145,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2151.296,2155.284,"Before you go on, would you use the same language here?"
1987.86-1145,1,43384,thomas_m_triplett,,2162.438,2163.004,--Yes.
1987.86-1145,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2163.004,2165.74,For the reasons done here?
1987.86-1145,1,43384,thomas_m_triplett,,2165.74,2170.375,"For good, bad or indifferent reasons."
1987.86-1145,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2170.375,2171.644,That's reasonably foreseeable.
1987.86-1145,1,43384,thomas_m_triplett,,2171.644,2172.127,Yes.
1987.86-1145,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2172.127,2183.535,"Mr. Triplett, it seems to me that under Oregon's law, the only thing that's reasonably foreseeable is that peer review action might take place in good faith."
1987.86-1145,1,43384,thomas_m_triplett,,2227.462,2252.512,"My analysis of the Oregon Statute which is a Statute that addresses the question of immunity, not the question of the evidentiary privilege, and there is no exception in Oregon with respect to whether you are entitled to the type of information that was obtained here."
1987.86-1145,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2278.913,2281.579,Excuse me.
1987.86-1145,1,43384,thomas_m_triplett,,2297.375,2298.541,"Well, I'm not so sure."
1987.86-1145,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2298.541,2299.992,"It needs something more than that, doesn't it?"
1987.86-1145,1,43384,thomas_m_triplett,,2299.992,2303.878,My view of the language of the Oregon Statute is this.
1987.86-1145,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2320.573,2322.923,"Well, what is the remedy as a matter of State law."
1987.86-1145,1,43384,thomas_m_triplett,,2324.108,2326.977,"Well, there are a host of remedies."
1987.86-1145,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2336.25,2341.319,You mean the Board could direct the Hospital to reinstate a doctor?
1987.86-1145,1,43384,thomas_m_triplett,,2341.319,2344.855,The State Court can direct.
1987.86-1145,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2344.855,2346.671,If the doctor brings a lawsuit.
1987.86-1145,1,43384,thomas_m_triplett,,2346.671,2350.275,If he asks for judicial review of the decision.
1987.86-1145,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2350.275,2354.127,Under a particular statute or just your right to sue anybody?
1987.86-1145,1,43384,thomas_m_triplett,,2354.127,2354.677,Yes.
1987.86-1145,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2384.044,2388.948,"Is that the one, is that Statute in so many words authorize judicial review?"
1987.86-1145,1,43384,thomas_m_triplett,,2388.948,2390.134,--That is my view of it.
1987.86-1145,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2390.134,2392.784,But I'm just asking you.
1987.86-1145,1,43384,thomas_m_triplett,,2392.784,2393.784,Yes.
1987.86-1145,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2393.784,2395.267,If it authorizes it in so many words.
1987.86-1145,1,43384,thomas_m_triplett,,2397.836,2416.482,"The reason that there has been fuzziness about is there judicial review is that in the Straube case, the Court of Appeals of the Supreme Court of Oregon said, we need not decide whether there is a right of review."
1987.86-1145,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2458.059,2463.713,"But Mr. Triplett, the requirement for State action?"
1987.86-1145,1,43384,thomas_m_triplett,,2480.39,2487.877,"--Well, I guess it depends on what the definition of active versus passive is."
1987.86-1145,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2556.787,2563.091,"May I ask, is there a State law that prescribes the procedures to be followed at a peer review proceeding?"
1987.86-1145,1,43384,thomas_m_triplett,,2567.377,2567.86,--No.
1987.86-1145,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2572.864,2576.935,But there's no State law that says how these proceedings shall be conducted?
1987.86-1145,1,43384,thomas_m_triplett,,2576.935,2582.921,--It says you shall have one that is written and that--
1987.86-1145,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2582.921,2587.539,"Does it say what the burden of proof is, or what the grounds are for disqualification?"
1987.86-1145,1,43384,thomas_m_triplett,,2587.539,2587.756,--No.
1987.86-1145,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2588.523,2589.658,What kind of evidence is received?
1987.86-1145,1,43384,thomas_m_triplett,,2592.193,2595.729,"--In the by-laws, the answer is, yes."
1987.86-1145,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2595.729,2596.395,By-laws of the hospital?
1987.86-1145,1,43384,thomas_m_triplett,,2596.395,2596.812,By-laws of the hospital.
1987.86-1145,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2602.966,2605.918,Can the Health Division of the State of Oregon tell them to rewrite the by-laws?
1987.86-1145,1,43384,thomas_m_triplett,,2605.918,2606.218,Yes.
1987.86-1145,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2606.218,2609.453,The by-laws on peer review can?
1987.86-1145,1,43384,thomas_m_triplett,,2609.453,2610.489,Yes.
1987.86-1145,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2629.116,2632.252,Have they adopted any rules relating to peer review commissions?
1987.86-1145,1,43384,thomas_m_triplett,,2632.252,2637.806,--They have granted authority to the--
1987.86-1145,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2637.806,2642.424,They have authority to adopt these rules.
1987.86-1145,1,43384,thomas_m_triplett,,2643.726,2668.408,"--They have adopted rules where a complaint has been filed by any person who believes there's been a violation of the Health Rules, which includes the entire peer review section that apply to hospitals, which grants to them total access to all hospital records to determine whether there's been a violation of the Act."
1987.86-1145,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2668.408,2672.479,That's not a rule describing how a peer review shall be conducted.
1987.86-1145,1,43384,thomas_m_triplett,,2672.479,2690.791,There is also a provision that they shall use the rules of the Joint Commission on Hospital Accreditation or they adopt their own and they are subject to review by the State of Oregon Health Division for conformance with the State law.
1987.86-1145,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2690.791,2697.844,And does that Division have the right to reverse a decision of a peer review committee to deny hospital privileges?
1987.86-1145,1,43384,thomas_m_triplett,,2697.844,2722.662,"The Statute says that in event of a violation of any health statute, that the Division will report that to the District Attorney and obtain an injunction against continued or perpetuation of that practice."
1987.86-1145,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2724.228,2750.229,"Mr. Triplett, are there any instances cited to us where either the State Health Division or the Board of Medical Examiners have actually intervened in cases to assure a correction of substantive abuses like those alleged here in the process, or directed procedural changes to avoid problems?"
1987.86-1145,1,43384,thomas_m_triplett,,2750.229,2765.989,The only evidence in the record at all of an interface between the Board and the problems of Dr. Patrick are that it did--
1987.86-1145,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2765.989,2768.274,Any one else?
1987.86-1145,1,43384,thomas_m_triplett,,2768.274,2775.797,"--We weren't dealing with any one else in this case, so I can't answer that."
1987.86-1145,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2832.098,2849.524,"Well, counsel, after the final action is taken by the review committee, what are the steps that would mean administrative review, specific, if you please?"
1987.86-1145,1,43384,thomas_m_triplett,,2849.524,2849.624,All right.
1987.86-1145,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2875.925,2876.741,What next?
1987.86-1145,1,43384,thomas_m_triplett,,2876.741,2890.799,"Then the Executive Committee, if it concurs in the recommendation, then passes it on to the Governing Board of the Hospital, 18 people, 16 of the 18--"
1987.86-1145,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2890.799,2891.249,What next?
1987.86-1145,1,43384,thomas_m_triplett,,2891.249,2892.001,--not being doctors.
1987.86-1145,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2892.001,2892.701,What next?
1987.86-1145,1,43384,thomas_m_triplett,,2892.701,2901.189,They then will hear the case both to determine whether there has been procedural due process--

1987.86-1145,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3035.026,3044.315,"Mr. Lyon, what is the point then of the requirement in the Statute that the hospital report disciplinary actions to the State Medical Examiner?"
1987.86-1145,2,17806,barbee_b_lyon,,3044.315,3056.373,That is because the function of the State Board of Medical Examiners is to pass on the qualification of physicians to have a state license to practice medicine within the State.
1987.86-1145,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3067.664,3077.786,"Under your view of that, the fact that your client had resigned from the Hospital facilities wouldn't have prevented the State Medical Board from going ahead to look into his fitness to practice?"
1987.86-1145,2,17806,barbee_b_lyon,,3077.786,3078.103,"Oh, not at all."
1987.86-1145,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3096.582,3105.353,Does the State Board have any power to compel a hospital to allow a doctor to have staff privileges?
1987.86-1145,2,17806,barbee_b_lyon,,3105.353,3106.555,"No, Your Honor, none at all."
1987.86-1145,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3171.315,3174.767,You say the hospital settled?
1987.86-1145,2,17806,barbee_b_lyon,,3174.767,3175.667,"Yes, Your Honor."
1987.86-1145,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3175.667,3176.25,This case?
1987.86-1145,2,17806,barbee_b_lyon,,3176.25,3176.886,"Yes, Your Honor."
1987.86-1145,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3251.85,3254.652,Wasn't all that decided by the jury?
1987.86-1145,2,17806,barbee_b_lyon,,3254.652,3255.702,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1987.86-1145,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3255.702,3257.588,"Well, what business is it of ours?"
1987.86-1145,2,17806,barbee_b_lyon,,3257.588,3259.29,"It is none, Your Honor."
1987.86-1145,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3275.847,3276.964,What page are you reading from?
1987.86-1145,2,17806,barbee_b_lyon,,3276.964,3281.001,"--I'm reading from page 46 of their brief, Your Honor."
1987.86-1145,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3354.014,3365.37,"Except you're exaggerating the State law in the same manner that your opponent is, that is to say, there isn't a State statute that says you're liable for damages if you act in bad faith, is there?"
1987.86-1145,2,17806,barbee_b_lyon,,3365.37,3366.571,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1987.86-1145,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3366.571,3369.273,There is one that says you're not liable for damages if you act in good faith.
1987.86-1145,2,17806,barbee_b_lyon,,3369.273,3369.973,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1987.86-1145,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3373.225,3375.343,That's the same kind of inference he's trying to draw.
1987.86-1145,2,17806,barbee_b_lyon,,3378.545,3380.747,"Yes, Your Honor."
1987.86-1145,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3451.175,3452.51,"Thank you, Mr. Lyon."
