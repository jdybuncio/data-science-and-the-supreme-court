1959.33,0,17850,bessie_margolin,,25.471,30.447,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1959.33,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,489.674,492.034,Do the -- do the seasons overlap?
1959.33,0,17850,bessie_margolin,,494.285,498.707,The seasons -- I think they do not generally overlap.
1959.33,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,509.417,513.607,How many weeks in each season? How many weeks in the corn season and how many in the carrots?
1959.33,0,17850,bessie_margolin,,513.607,525.074,From -- the dates are given and judging from the dates it's about eight to nine weeks -- nine to 10 weeks for the corn and about six weeks for carrots.
1959.33,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,539.952,543.805,"And during those two periods, employment went up (Voice Overlap) --"
1959.33,0,17850,bessie_margolin,,543.805,556.741,"The Government conceded that during the active -- during the active period, the employees engaged in the freezing, in the -- the processing and the immediate packaging into --"
1959.33,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,556.741,558.199,Were exempt.
1959.33,0,17850,bessie_margolin,,558.199,559.638,-- were exempt.
1959.33,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,566.57,574.798,Well that was (Inaudible) 14 weeks -- second 14 weeks period?
1959.33,0,17850,bessie_margolin,,574.798,575.416,No.
1959.33,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,582.852,583.172,Yes.
1959.33,0,17850,bessie_margolin,,583.172,583.812,-- operation.
1959.33,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,583.812,583.92,Yes.
1959.33,0,17850,bessie_margolin,,588.931,589.511,That's right.
1959.33,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,589.511,594.676,"Well, are we concerned here with the exemption as to the 20 only?"
1959.33,0,17850,bessie_margolin,,594.676,600.827,"If we're concerned, that's primarily our -- our concern, I presume."
1959.33,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,616.88,627.369,"Well, I -- I just -- the heavier date when this so-called post processing period begins when they have time now to package for consumer use."
1959.33,0,17850,bessie_margolin,,627.369,648.819,Well there are -- there are -- there are some tables in the record which show -- show the weeks for which the Oregon claimed the exemption and the weeks where -- which we claimed this evidence to show which weeks we claim that they weren't entitled to it.
1959.33,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,681.831,685.648,"But not as the Government's proof (Inaudible) I gather in this Court, which were the (Inaudible)"
1959.33,0,17850,bessie_margolin,,685.648,710.206,"We can see that during the active season when the crops are coming in, when there's a great influx of crops and they have to be immediately processed and they -- we -- and that the freezing process is -- the freezing process and the immediate repackaging, that continues operation until there's a break that that is a – exempt, but when there's a break, the subsequent operations are not that."
1959.33,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,710.206,711.221,We'll recess now.
1959.33,0,17850,bessie_margolin,,723.324,775.737,"The administrator's interpretation of this language of the exemptions, his long standing interpretation has been that this seasonal -- that it is a seasonal exemption limited to -- to the purpose of giving relief, the seasonal commodities during the peak season when prompt processing is essential for preservation of the crop and when the heavy influx during the short harvesting season can be handled only by working large quantities of labor for long hours and that it was not intended to exempt activities which could be extended around the year and where there was ample labor -- year round labor available to handle it."
1959.33,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1188.083,1203.065,"Has it been contended at any point along the line that this was not the -- this -- even though it was not a first processing, it was a canning or packing of a perishable vegetable."
1959.33,0,17850,bessie_margolin,,1203.065,1205.179,"Well, it's certainly not canning."
1959.33,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1205.449,1206.042,Or packing.
1959.33,0,17850,bessie_margolin,,1206.042,1212.377,The packing is for the -- there's some confusion that is in the -- in respondent's brief.
1959.33,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1219.547,1222.137,The statute is perishable.
1959.33,0,17850,bessie_margolin,,1222.137,1226.898,"Perishable, seasonal and perishable fresh vegetables, packing of those."
1959.33,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1226.898,1229.141,Fresh -- fresh fruits or vegetables.
1959.33,0,17850,bessie_margolin,,1229.141,1231.631,And that's always been interpreted and generally accepted.
1959.33,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1231.631,1235.677,"Was it raised below in the -- the lower courts didn't rule on this, did they?"
1959.33,0,17850,bessie_margolin,,1235.677,1236.021,No.
1959.33,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1251.922,1259.216,Has the administrator made any rulings to whether the frozen vegetables are perishable within the meaning of the statute?
1959.33,0,17850,bessie_margolin,,1259.216,1259.712,"Oh, yes."
1959.33,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1275.069,1276.972,I don't understand.
1959.33,0,17850,bessie_margolin,,1276.972,1307.764,"He has -- he has also specifically ruled that -- that a -- a process -- packaging doing operations, subsequent operations on vegetables processed by someone else at another place of business, couldn't tack his operations onto the other processes, in order to take advantage of the exemptions."
1959.33,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1560.67,1571.529,You (Inaudible) -- Mr. Gallagher.
1959.33,1,35950,martin_p_gallagher,,1571.529,1576.629,"Mr. Chief Justice, Honorable Members of the Court."
1959.33,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1668.914,1676.382,You do claim -- you do claim that a first processing cannot be a branch within the whole set of frequent --
1959.33,1,35950,martin_p_gallagher,,1676.382,1681.617,Yes Your Honor as they interpret it particularly.
1959.33,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1711.656,1714.462,Are all of those presently exempt?
1959.33,1,35950,martin_p_gallagher,,1714.462,1716.674,Yes.
1959.33,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2064.808,2072.446,Did the operation continue uninterrupted straight through the -- the year until it's all processed?
1959.33,1,35950,martin_p_gallagher,,2072.446,2072.614,Yes Your Honor.
1959.33,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2072.614,2077.637,Or -- or do -- do they have spurts and stops and so forth --
1959.33,1,35950,martin_p_gallagher,,2077.637,2078.793,No.
1959.33,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2084.391,2085.54,Yes.
1959.33,1,35950,martin_p_gallagher,,2085.54,2095.876,"But as the season peters out of the end, where there're more of these bins pulled out and at the end of it, all these bins are pulled out continuously until it's all packaged."
1959.33,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2123.23,2129.64,When you say -- when you say it's all one operation to get an exceptional year --
1959.33,1,35950,martin_p_gallagher,,2129.64,2129.841,Yes.
1959.33,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2129.841,2138.393,"-- the normal year, what gaps in time are there between the beginning (Inaudible) that is --"
1959.33,1,35950,martin_p_gallagher,,2138.393,2138.86,Yes.
1959.33,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2138.86,2145.733,"-- and the final consumer packaging, what gaps in time are there?"
1959.33,1,35950,martin_p_gallagher,,2145.733,2153.361,There are no gaps in time particularly as to the commodity goes right straight through and into the consumers package.
1959.33,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2154.476,2156.434,And we'll take -- take one lot or --
1959.33,1,35950,martin_p_gallagher,,2156.434,2160.64,Take one lot goes in the storage in (Voice Overlap) the 64-cubic --
1959.33,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2160.64,2162.894,Would you mind -- would you mind seeing that through?
1959.33,1,35950,martin_p_gallagher,,2162.894,2163.306,Yes.
1959.33,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2182.708,2184.034,Still on the cob?
1959.33,1,35950,martin_p_gallagher,,2184.034,2188.969,"Still on the cob, that's -- I'm taking the cob as example, Your Honor."
1959.33,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2195.924,2199.22,What is this processing that took for an hour or two hours?
1959.33,1,35950,martin_p_gallagher,,2199.22,2216.476,"That would include taking the husk off and grading it, cutting the cob corn to size through the blanching period, steam blanch, through the freeze tunnels, and out the other end of the freeze tunnel, in to the 64-cubic foot --"
1959.33,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2216.476,2220.094,"And temporarily and physically, that's one continuous process."
1959.33,1,35950,martin_p_gallagher,,2220.094,2220.629,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1959.33,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2220.629,2221.327,Thus far.
1959.33,1,35950,martin_p_gallagher,,2221.327,2221.704,Thus far.
1959.33,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2221.704,2222.917,"Now, go on to that."
1959.33,1,35950,martin_p_gallagher,,2222.917,2233.308,"Then the cubic -- the -- the bin goes into full storage which just across the package room, it's all in one building and into the storage."
1959.33,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2277.71,2281.019,Is that all that's done?
1959.33,1,35950,martin_p_gallagher,,2284.141,2284.668,No.
1959.33,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2286.626,2287.83,(Voice Overlap)
1959.33,1,35950,martin_p_gallagher,,2287.83,2288.196,Yes.
1959.33,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2296.44,2297.449,It's frozen -- just frozen.
1959.33,1,35950,martin_p_gallagher,,2297.449,2312.298,"Just frozen and they take it home and drop it in the boiling water for two or three minutes and it comes out, as professor says “The closest to corn on the cob,” that we pick off the stock in our own home garden."
1959.33,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2312.298,2321.586,"Now, you freeze that, it -- the picture you've given me is that of an assembly line that (Inaudible) unbroken without any stoppage."
1959.33,1,35950,martin_p_gallagher,,2321.586,2324.087,"This continues movement, Your Honor, yes."
1959.33,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2324.087,2327.127,What -- what -- how many hours is -- is the process (Voice Overlap) --
1959.33,1,35950,martin_p_gallagher,,2327.127,2328.791,From start to finish?
1959.33,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2328.791,2335.838,"From beginning to the final packaging so that my Brother, Whittaker, can now eat frozen cob -- corn on the (Voice Overlap) --"
1959.33,1,35950,martin_p_gallagher,,2335.838,2351.035,"I'm guessing this a little bit, but I think a cob of corn starting out, coming into the plant from the farmers, from the time it hits the plant, I suspect to matter three or four hours."
1959.33,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2351.035,2351.88,The whole thing.
1959.33,1,35950,martin_p_gallagher,,2351.88,2353.235,The whole thing.
1959.33,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2353.235,2363.272,So then what about -- and there's some other things as to what is Ms. Margolin said I gather the following -- said I gathered she was talking about (Inaudible) wasn't she?
1959.33,1,35950,martin_p_gallagher,,2363.272,2364.544,Yes.
1959.33,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2374.426,2377.611,That must be different from what you've just get this to?
1959.33,1,35950,martin_p_gallagher,,2377.611,2377.88,Yes.
1959.33,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2408.252,2410.775,"Well, then there is a break due to nature."
1959.33,1,35950,martin_p_gallagher,,2410.775,2417.541,Due to the nature of their -- some delay in the -- in the mixed vegetable pack.
1959.33,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2417.541,2421.681,And that the earlier vegetables were put in the storage until you get the (Voice Overlap) --
1959.33,1,35950,martin_p_gallagher,,2421.681,2425.457,"Yes, we get -- we get our earlier vegetables because we can't grow them on (Voice Overlap) --"
1959.33,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2425.457,2426.704,You put it that way.
1959.33,1,35950,martin_p_gallagher,,2428.81,2429.715,They're frozen --
1959.33,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2429.715,2430.128,Frozen.
1959.33,1,35950,martin_p_gallagher,,2430.128,2430.358,-- at a plant --
1959.33,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2430.358,2432.164,And put away in bins or something.
1959.33,1,35950,martin_p_gallagher,,2432.164,2434.892,And put it in bins or something and brought to us.
1959.33,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2435.336,2437.063,They have to wait till the corn comes in.
1959.33,1,35950,martin_p_gallagher,,2437.063,2438.789,Then we have to wait until corn comes in.
1959.33,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2444.53,2447.685,"If you don't put the corn on the side, you say --"
1959.33,1,35950,martin_p_gallagher,,2447.685,2452.132,"Oh no [Laughter] no, we keep the cob corn separate."
1959.33,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2490.208,2502.449,Do I understand that corn (Inaudible) corn kernels when you cut off it.
1959.33,1,35950,martin_p_gallagher,,2502.449,2503.26,That's correct.
1959.33,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2503.26,2503.976,Two processes.
1959.33,1,35950,martin_p_gallagher,,2503.976,2505.1,Two processes.
1959.33,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2505.1,2511.351,"One goes on the cob or if you do it at a later time, is to (Inaudible)"
1959.33,1,35950,martin_p_gallagher,,2511.351,2511.93,That's correct.
1959.33,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2511.93,2516.982,"But to the other it (Inaudible) you take all, you mix it with other vegetables."
1959.33,1,35950,martin_p_gallagher,,2516.982,2518.981,Some -- some we mix as kernel corn.
1959.33,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2523.329,2526.613,Now do you sell any -- any frozen peas as such?
1959.33,1,35950,martin_p_gallagher,,2526.613,2527.659,"No, we do not, Your Honor."
1959.33,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2527.659,2535.101,"So the peas and the other -- and the beans or whatever, they have to wait for the belated corn and carrots?"
1959.33,1,35950,martin_p_gallagher,,2535.101,2535.424,That's correct.
1959.33,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2535.424,2536.911,How long a wait is that?
1959.33,1,35950,martin_p_gallagher,,2536.911,2538.457,Up until about October.
1959.33,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2538.457,2539.382,I mean in --
1959.33,1,35950,martin_p_gallagher,,2539.382,2540.033,In time.
1959.33,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2540.033,2541.295,-- in time.
1959.33,1,35950,martin_p_gallagher,,2541.295,2549.742,Peas probably come off in July -- June or July and there would be that period of time for June and July until October.
1959.33,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2549.742,2552.708,But those peas whatever vegetables go into this (Voice Overlap) --
1959.33,1,35950,martin_p_gallagher,,2552.708,2554.095,String beans and lima beans.
1959.33,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2554.095,2569.506,"The peas and the beans and the lima beans, they wait for corn and carrots, but while waiting, they're not employed -- they're not utilized or packaged for any independent use, except to wait for their companions and vegetables."
1959.33,1,35950,martin_p_gallagher,,2569.812,2570.712,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1959.33,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2573.471,2578.788,"And Mr. Gallagher, we get to the point where you've got all of your product in there, carrots are the last (Voice Overlap) --"
1959.33,1,35950,martin_p_gallagher,,2578.788,2579.75,Carrots are the last.
1959.33,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2579.75,2581.053,Are the last.
1959.33,1,35950,martin_p_gallagher,,2593.736,2600.983,"Just as soon as the carrots are frozen, they're diced carrots, then the mixing operation starts then."
1959.33,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2600.983,2601.082,Yes.
1959.33,1,35950,martin_p_gallagher,,2601.082,2608.218,"And it takes about, I think about two months to complete this mixture."
1959.33,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2613.052,2614.07,December or January --

1959.33,1,35950,martin_p_gallagher,,2771.234,2772.641,That's correct.

1959.33,1,35950,martin_p_gallagher,,2835.206,2835.496,That's correct.
1959.33,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2835.496,2837.471,-- because that stage wasn't reached.
1959.33,1,35950,martin_p_gallagher,,2837.471,2839.225,That's right.
1959.33,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2839.225,2839.76,Well may I ask you this?

1959.33,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2970.746,2971.31,I understand that.
1959.33,1,35950,martin_p_gallagher,,2971.31,2973.365,We can claim under 7 (c) --

1959.33,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3045.01,3048.595,Well is this the first time this question has arisen?
1959.33,1,35950,martin_p_gallagher,,3048.595,3051.173,This precise question?
1959.33,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3051.173,3053.143,How do you account for that or at least --
1959.33,1,35950,martin_p_gallagher,,3053.143,3053.71,"Well, I don't know."
1959.33,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3053.71,3059.862,It comforts me because this same situation must've arisen since the beginning of the Act.
1959.33,1,35950,martin_p_gallagher,,3059.862,3086.669,The only explanation I have for this coming up now is within my own recollection known familiarity with it would be that first time I've known that they've said that this limitation of first processing breaks off here at -- when we put them in bins.
1959.33,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3117.49,3132.103,"Well except that the exception -- is an exception -- exception is an exception or exemption and therefore, limitation upon general purposes of the Act."
1959.33,1,35950,martin_p_gallagher,,3134.83,3145.159,"They don't run in parallel columns, but we feel that Congress was very interested in those exemptions for the benefit of the farmer."

1959.33,1,35950,martin_p_gallagher,,3245.667,3258.707,Well this is the first time that I have known that the interpretation that the Government is now given to first processing ends on this bulk freezing.

1959.33,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,3310.322,3327.675,"Now, is there any difference in the manner of whether one has been processed over the other as respects those you buy from those you produce, they're frozen in each instance --"
1959.33,1,35950,martin_p_gallagher,,3327.675,3328.313,They're both --
1959.33,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,3328.313,3328.917,-- are they?
1959.33,1,35950,martin_p_gallagher,,3328.917,3332.094,There are identical items.
1959.33,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,3339.34,3339.7,All right.
1959.33,1,35950,martin_p_gallagher,,3344.44,3344.593,I think --
1959.33,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,3344.593,3346.018,-- before you buy them?
1959.33,1,35950,martin_p_gallagher,,3346.018,3349.992,I think he is in the process of processing.
1959.33,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,3399.453,3401.893,Well he's done all he's ever going to do to --
1959.33,1,35950,martin_p_gallagher,,3401.893,3402.439,No.
1959.33,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,3402.439,3403.261,When he sold --
1959.33,1,35950,martin_p_gallagher,,3403.261,3426.982,"In this particular lot that he has, what we buy from him he has, but the balance of what we buy from him are probably just an infinitesimal amount of his production and he's engaged in freezing peas to put in consumer sized package for the retail market, but in addition to that, he just diverts part of his production over to us."
1959.33,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3426.982,3435.047,"But he has -- he does rely on his exemption under (c), has he?"
1959.33,1,35950,martin_p_gallagher,,3435.047,3437.45,"Well, undoubtedly, he has both exemptions."
1959.33,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3437.45,3443.555,"Well, I mean he -- he has that and therefore as you are in there has already been a first processing."
1959.33,1,35950,martin_p_gallagher,,3443.555,3444.726,"I think so, yes."
1959.33,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3444.726,3448.956,"Therefore, you can't build on there, can you?"
1959.33,1,35950,martin_p_gallagher,,3448.956,3456.028,"Well, basically we're engaged in the processing of corn and carrots and the addition of these other things are somewhat incidental."

1959.33,2,17850,bessie_margolin,,3626.578,3634.423,It's been greatly increasing in the last decade and it's continuously increasing and that's why the reason for the issue is of such importance.
1959.33,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3634.716,3642.11,Well what I'm trying to get at was whether in the 1943 the processing of frozen vegetables is --
1959.33,2,17850,bessie_margolin,,3642.11,3652.02,I think it was -- I think they were some at that day -- it wasn't -- it's nearly so limited as it was today.
1959.33,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3652.02,3678.976,"Ms. Margolin, could one make a valid distinction between the processing described by Mr. Gallagher which is a continuous, uninterrupted assembly line, if I may use that to all that analogy and situations where there is a real temporal interruption of one moment or a minute?"
1959.33,2,17850,bessie_margolin,,3678.976,3693.759,"Well, the administrator has and I assume that for practical reasons, so if there's continuous process and uninterrupted, he is not going to try to break off the things that are -- are directly –"
1959.33,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3693.759,3694.428,In this case --
1959.33,2,17850,bessie_margolin,,3694.428,3708.644,"-- required for a -- because of the perishability factor, if they get them immediately into consumer pack -- packages in a -- in a continuous operation, he's not going to cut them off at the time it gets."
1959.33,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3708.644,3708.994,To gather the matter --
1959.33,2,17850,bessie_margolin,,3708.994,3712.396,Even though they might not need to do it then for seasonal reasons.
1959.33,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3712.396,3714.846,Is that by way of grace of the – of the -- is that a legal --
1959.33,2,17850,bessie_margolin,,3714.846,3720.583,"Well, I think it's a practical interpretation of the -- of the Act."
1959.33,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3738.142,3765.05,"Well I've got a question put here that so long as there is bulk – bulk of process or bulk storage, at that point, he's rather – rather perfectly good physical lines, if all of peas that have come in, all the corn is to be frozen, that's perfectly physical -- good easy physical line, what you say that –"
1959.33,2,17850,bessie_margolin,,3765.05,3765.467,Well --
1959.33,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3765.467,3775.646,"-- as a matter of construction, you could think if there's no such break as there was in 1954, it's outside of your regulation?"
1959.33,2,17850,bessie_margolin,,3775.646,3780.291,"Oh, I'm not sure I understand Mr. Gallagher's position there."
1959.33,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3825.325,3825.714,"Well, why can't --"
1959.33,2,17850,bessie_margolin,,3825.714,3831.119,"And it's the -- it's the need to label it, put the firm one -- to get firm orders."
1959.33,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3843.689,3859.996,"I'm not talking about perishability, but as far as the statute goes, there's nothing in that that to me makes a difference between not going into the last state because you haven't got any order in going into it because you think it will have orders."
1959.33,2,17850,bessie_margolin,,3879.983,3881.724,That you can't wait until you have a promising market.
1959.33,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3881.724,3882.794,Yes.
1959.33,2,17850,bessie_margolin,,3882.794,3884.783,There's nothing in the statute that says that.
1959.33,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3918.157,3924.103,Well I think perishable or seasonal refers to the -- to the process to which we subject --
1959.33,2,17850,bessie_margolin,,3924.103,3925.114,"Well, I say these -- these --"
1959.33,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3925.114,3928.499,-- the perishables that it doesn't relate to the first processing.
1959.33,2,17850,bessie_margolin,,3928.499,3938.962,"Well, these -- these words of the exemption, I think, are indicative of what Congress had in mind and the legislative history shows that that is what -- what Congress had in mind."
1959.33,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3939.044,3956.277,"Well even so it will bear on the fact that it ceases to be, although it's the continuous things from a commercial point of view and it's approximately that it's done in two days, but it's not a processes, because it's done in two weeks or two months."
1959.33,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3956.277,3970.645,Ms. Margolin is there any significance to the fact that the fact that itself does first processing of these things during this period of – work periods of not more than 14 work weeks in the (Inaudible) in any calendar year.
1959.33,2,17850,bessie_margolin,,3976.336,3980.369,"Well, if there's a suggestion that you might have several seasons."
