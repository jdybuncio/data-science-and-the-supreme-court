1999.98-678,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,11.456,"We'll hear argument next in Number 98-678, the Los Angeles Police Department v. United Reporting Publishing Corporation."
1999.98-678,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,72.179,76.398,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1999.98-678,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,141.091,144.276,"Where is this in your brief, Mr. Goldstein?"
1999.98-678,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,144.276,147.596,"--The appendix to the blue brief, Mr. Chief Justice, at page 3."
1999.98-678,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,147.596,148.362,3a?
1999.98-678,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,149.346,165.824,"And subsection (f)(3) teaches that with respect to addresses of both crime victims and arrestees, the State grants access only, quote, where the requester declares, under penalty of perjury, that the request is made for one of five specified purposes."
1999.98-678,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,174.164,182.501,"Well, could the respondent just publish this in a little newspaper format and claim a journalistic exception?"
1999.98-678,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,182.501,184.12,That has never been tested.
1999.98-678,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,195.327,202.647,So the statute permits the automatic release of the name of an individual.
1999.98-678,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,205.683,211.77,"That is exactly right, Mr. Chief Justice, with respect both to the victim and to the arrestee."
1999.98-678,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,211.77,225.012,"Well, the Jail Mail Register that's in the record, isn't that an illustration of what looks like a newspaper but really has a mailing list, or--"
1999.98-678,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,225.012,236.42,"Well, I think the difficulty is, and again the lower courts never reached this question and it would remain open on remand, is what precisely respondent wants to do with the addresses, with respect to the Jail Mail Register."
1999.98-678,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,257.334,261.269,"--So if the purpose controls, then assume this hypothetical."
1999.98-678,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,289.372,295.359,"No, and let me... that is exactly the distinction that I wanted to get to with the remainder of subsection (f)(3) in the text."
1999.98-678,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,328.847,331.616,Are you referring to a specific section of the statute now?
1999.98-678,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,331.616,334.568,"--We're still within... Mr. Chief Justice, still within (f)(3), the last sentence."
1999.98-678,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,336.853,337.47,Okay.
1999.98-678,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,337.47,349.743,"It rolls over and it says, if you get it, or are trying to get access for one of the five permitted purposes, say, journalism in your hypothetical, Mr. Justice Kennedy, you get it for journalism, you can't then use it to sell a product or service."
1999.98-678,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,366.622,368.555,You say it's not going to be used by that person.
1999.98-678,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,368.555,370.007,No--
1999.98-678,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,370.007,371.041,But that statute doesn't say that.
1999.98-678,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,371.041,376.228,"--No, that... with respect, the Los Angeles Times... and let me just take one quick detour."
1999.98-678,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,422.292,434.766,"Among political... permitted purposes is political, and I think I have some idea of what these others encompass, journalism, scholarly, but what is political?"
1999.98-678,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,434.766,445.991,"Political was added at the same time as the amendment for adding governmental purposes, and it was, as we understand it, simply to make clear that it wasn't simply the Government then existing."
1999.98-678,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,454.078,457.03,"Is this a State statute, Mr. Goldstein, or an ordinance?"
1999.98-678,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,457.03,458.649,"--It is a State statute, Your Honor."
1999.98-678,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,458.649,461.601,I'm still not totally clear on your explanation.
1999.98-678,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,489.168,492.703,"It is not to sell a product or service, that is exactly--"
1999.98-678,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,492.703,503.328,"So does the product or service mean, in other words, I who print this paper know that people want to get lists of names and addresses of victims--"
1999.98-678,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,503.328,503.878,--No.
1999.98-678,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,503.878,508.981,"--and therefore I will sell them this list, and I put a few articles in as a kind of cover-up."
1999.98-678,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,510.364,513.967,"What happens here, to focus on this exact example--"
1999.98-678,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,513.967,514.351,Yes.
1999.98-678,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,514.351,521.722,--is that if respondent wants the names to advertise in the Jail Mail Register that it has a product or service... and it does.
1999.98-678,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,570.555,574.19,"Well, had the statute never been construed by the State courts?"
1999.98-678,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,574.19,575.024,It has not.
1999.98-678,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,591.885,597.872,"How did the Ninth Circuit go about interpreting it, if there had been no State interpretation?"
1999.98-678,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,597.872,601.074,"Improvidently, I think is the first answer, but the--"
1999.98-678,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,601.607,603.257,So what's new?
1999.98-678,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,603.859,619.468,"What... I don't... section 6254, I don't think there's any question as between the parties that in the first place the Ninth Circuit got the statute wrong."
1999.98-678,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,644.901,648.888,There's a different in being nosy and being political?
1999.98-678,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,649.522,651.34,There is.
1999.98-678,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,658.243,660.629,"Well, I read through this list of all the people who had been arrested in Sacramento."
1999.98-678,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,683.395,705.574,"--It would depend on the specific facts, and to take them just as you say, if all that they were doing... say that the Los Angeles Times publishes out... publishes a special version for lawyers, and it says, look, we've got everybody who's arrested for DUI, it would be a much closer case, and I think what you would see, honestly, is the California legislature addressing that problem."
1999.98-678,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,707.093,708.526,"Okay, but we've got to work with what we've got here."
1999.98-678,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,708.526,708.993,--Right.
1999.98-678,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,708.993,718.132,"Let's assume that the paper simply publishes this in one section of its regular edition, every day, a complete listing."
1999.98-678,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,719.918,721.018,"It would not, but the--"
1999.98-678,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,721.018,744.449,"Why would it not, because when it made out its affidavit, it would know perfectly well, assuming the statute remained in its present form, that individuals such as the respondent here would use the information and in any event would know that the purveyors of services would use the information, so how could it make out the affidavit?"
1999.98-678,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,744.449,751.103,--Because on the text of the statute the sentence about selling a product or service does not limit the scope of the first sentence.
1999.98-678,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,760.311,767.715,"Well, why isn't it journalistic to provide information to people who are interested in communicating with arrestees and victims?"
1999.98-678,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,770.251,783.058,"Because that is not... the press and the core of journalism, under the constitutional tradition that we have, and what we think of as police blotters, is to simply educate the public about what is going on in the community."
1999.98-678,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,784.676,788.044,So then you have to identify your journalism by the generality of the publication.
1999.98-678,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,815.461,822.115,"--In the main, if you are publishing a police blotter, in the traditional, journalistic sense that is a journalistic purpose."
1999.98-678,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,823.384,826.169,Why do you say that only a police blotter is journalistic?
1999.98-678,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,838.811,841.013,--Journalism includes the press.
1999.98-678,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,841.013,845.215,"Well, the press is broken down into little subsets."
1999.98-678,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,862.692,865.294,The State and the legislative history explains this.
1999.98-678,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,882.004,882.54,May I ask--
1999.98-678,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,885.708,890.826,"Newspapers would not exist if they couldn't sell newspapers, but they are trying to educate the public, with respect."
1999.98-678,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,890.826,893.378,May I ask you a question about the proceedings in the lower court?
1999.98-678,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,903.519,904.203,No.
1999.98-678,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,906.371,908.657,"They didn't make the basic argument you're making now, in other words."
1999.98-678,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,908.657,909.44,--They did.
1999.98-678,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,925.833,928.119,What does Central Hudson have to do with our access cases?
1999.98-678,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,934.538,941.628,"--Well, the Los Angeles Police Department said below, and believes strongly here, of course, that this is an access case, that all that we do--"
1999.98-678,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,941.628,945.846,And what of our cases ever said Central Hudson applies to an access case?
1999.98-678,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,945.846,947.532,--I agree that it... none.
1999.98-678,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,947.532,949.984,But they did agree below that Central Hudson was the test.
1999.98-678,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,955.186,965.594,"With respect, on a full reading of the Los Angeles Police Department's briefs below, this case... this Court's cases like Houchin, Zemel and the like are cited and fully relied on."
1999.98-678,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,965.594,976.717,"I now see how they got into this, and I... I read the last sentence on 4a, where, to think that at its heart was case 1, not case 2."
1999.98-678,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1011.622,1029.084,"Under the hypothetical, if you simply want to sell addresses of arrestees and victims, without regard to what somebody else is going to do with them, you just want to sell them, you don't know what they're going to do, you are prohibited from receiving access under the first sentence of subsection (f)(3) because you don't have one of the five--"
1999.98-678,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1029.084,1031.584,"Well then, I must also execute an affidavit, must I not--"
1999.98-678,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1031.584,1032.118,--You must.
1999.98-678,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1032.118,1059.186,"--that I am not going to, as an enforcement device, I, or... the language covers it only awkwardly, but I who want to sell to other people addresses of victims and have never published a newspaper must execute that declaration that I am not... want the information to sell a product or service, namely my product or service that I've just described."
1999.98-678,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1059.186,1061.888,And it is enforceable only as against you.
1999.98-678,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1061.888,1066.523,"Yes, but I've now pushed you into this, because it seems to me that maybe that wasn't what this case was about."
1999.98-678,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1087.103,1088.286,"No, absolutely not."
1999.98-678,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1122.96,1139.971,"Do you accept the distinction that the Government's brief makes between what I think it called an intrinsic speech content on the one hand and information which is useful only for some purpose, e.g. in this case finding targets for solicitation?"
1999.98-678,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1145.458,1154.398,--We do accept the distinction insofar as it means that respondent's sales of addresses aren't subject to the highest level of First Amendment scrutiny.
1999.98-678,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1156.35,1161.235,"No, but that... your argument for that is that it's part of a commercial enterprise, right?"
1999.98-678,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1162.754,1163.254,--No.
1999.98-678,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1163.254,1163.686,No.
1999.98-678,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1163.686,1166.788,Just simply on the perspective of them transmitting data.
1999.98-678,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1171.109,1173.592,"Well, information is a commodity to the New York Times."
1999.98-678,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1173.592,1179.613,Information is a means of communicating an idea for the New York Times.
1999.98-678,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1182.815,1185.017,"But I mean, I don't... I don't know that that is so."
1999.98-678,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1201.879,1205.18,"--It is in a larger context, even... and the same is true of a police blotter."
1999.98-678,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1210.917,1213.686,"Well, has the respondent ever claimed to be a journalist?"
1999.98-678,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1213.686,1218.84,"Respondent did request a declaration in the district court, and the district court never got to that part of the case, yes."
1999.98-678,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1230.046,1246.007,"Well, but one of the reasons why... I mean, we've got to make a... basically a category judgment, whether it's an access restriction or whether it's a speech restriction, and one of the reasons upon which we may make that categorization, it seems, is the reason behind my question."
1999.98-678,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1249.775,1252.644,--Taking... take your question to the furthest.
1999.98-678,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1264.052,1265.737,"Thank you, Mr. Goldstein."
1999.98-678,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1324.61,1332.863,"Well, I think your question certainly gets to the heart of the case, which is that this case is about, in the first instance, access, who can have access."
1999.98-678,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1408.68,1412.631,But somebody who reads the L.A. Times can use them for all of those commercial purposes.
1999.98-678,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1412.631,1438.883,"That's right, and that gets to your question of what level of scrutiny we're under, because normally what we would say is, the legislature can address a problem that it perceives one step at a time, and it may address the problem that it perceives, and I... it's fair to say on this record and from the legislative history that the problem that was perceived was not that journalists were printing those addresses, and that that was invading people's privacy, but that commercial services were gathering them and selling them to commercial solicitors."
1999.98-678,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1468.468,1482.895,"Could the Government, or could the State pass a statute which said, we have... anyone can get access to this information, but it's a felony if you use it for any purpose other than scholarly, journalistic, political, governmental?"
1999.98-678,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1482.895,1506.76,"What BJF and Cox Broadcasting suggests is that certainly in the... when you are dealing with the institutional press, it may very well not be enough to have a restriction set off somewhere else in a statute which puts the onus on the reporter, having gotten something which is facially perfectly available and says press release on the top, for that reporter to know that there's another restriction on access."
1999.98-678,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1512.764,1513.533,So what do you do with my statute?
1999.98-678,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1516.485,1523.139,"--I say if it's... applies to the press, it is probably unconstitutional under BJF, or at least it's constitutionally problematic."
1999.98-678,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1523.139,1523.689,"Excuse me, only if it applies to the press?"
1999.98-678,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1527.857,1530.809,The Court has been reluctant to recognize a special status.
1999.98-678,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1530.809,1537.998,"--Yes, so I don't know... I don't know of any, and it seems to me Joe Six Pack can do anything with the information that the press ought to be able to do with it."
1999.98-678,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1537.998,1555.11,"Well, the fundamental distinction that we draw out of BJF and Cox Broadcasting on this point is this one, that it may be unfair, the Court has said, to give somebody something that is facially perfectly available but then say, gotcha, there's another piece of a statute somewhere that you may not have known about that criminalizes--"
1999.98-678,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1555.11,1559.162,"Well, I don't think that was the point of Justice Kennedy's... he wasn't talking about tricking."
1999.98-678,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1571.285,1572.571,--We... well--
1999.98-678,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1572.571,1574.154,--but they can only use it for certain purposes.
1999.98-678,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1574.154,1575.623,--And we think that is perfectly permissible.
1999.98-678,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1589.664,1593.818,"It's a condition subsequent on the use of information that's in, within a wide domain."
1999.98-678,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1595.001,1595.468,--No.
1999.98-678,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1595.468,1598.537,"--like this, either for you or against you, I must admit."
1999.98-678,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1598.537,1602.257,"With respect, it is a condition precedent to getting the information."
1999.98-678,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1654.206,1665.914,"Mr. DuMont, could a State in a KQED type situation say, we're going to give investigative journalists access to our prisoners to interview them, but nobody else?"
1999.98-678,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1682.976,1701.17,"--Well, I think particularly in contexts where there are what amount to constraints on quantity... I mean, you can't have everybody traipsing through the prisons, so when you have a constraint on quantity, or there's a limited number of seats in a courtroom, you may make certain kinds of what would normally be neutral but I think can probably favor the press in some circumstances."
1999.98-678,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1743.883,1745.599,"As a practical thing, as a practical matter, is there a difference?"
1999.98-678,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1746.299,1746.818,--Yes.
1999.98-678,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1746.818,1765.947,"--I've sat in courts... I mean, trial courts a lot of the time and I... people come before the courts for arraignment, and I don't know that their addresses are mentioned, so that I don't know that there's a practical way that, en masse, this kind of information really could be obtained unless it's obtained from the police."
1999.98-678,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1773.468,1782.741,"There are a variety of kinds of information that the Government may have a practical monopoly or a near monopoly on, and what I would suggest is, for instance, the names of people who have HIV or AIDS may be--"
1999.98-678,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1782.741,1784.141,But what about my question?
1999.98-678,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1793.614,1797.001,"--En masse, probably not, the same way there is not to get the list--"
1999.98-678,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1797.001,1802.47,"Yes, so that as a practical matter, this is a prohibition on a form of commercial speech."
1999.98-678,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1803.488,1803.855,--No.
1999.98-678,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1804.338,1805.774,"--that's the practical effect of it, it seems to me."
1999.98-678,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1805.774,1814.879,"--It is a public restriction which was undertaken with the consciousness that it would not facilitate a certain kind of commercial speech, and that is--"
1999.98-678,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1814.879,1840.428,"Right, but I think... and I don't want to put words in your mouth, but I think you are conceding that the argument that they can use it if they get it from any other source really does not meet the objection, because the objection is that there is a category of commercial speech which in fact is being prohibited by the prohibition on this source of supply, and I think you agreed that in practical terms that argument is true, sound."
1999.98-678,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1840.428,1850.136,--What I do not agree with is that simply because the Government may have a practical monopoly on compelling the compilation of the information... and again I would go to the case of public health.
1999.98-678,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1864.026,1869.764,"Well, that's... I mean, are you conceding that this... I mean, I don't know, maybe it's obvious... skip it."
1999.98-678,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1871.299,1871.932,Thank you.
1999.98-678,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1871.932,1873.532,"Thank you, Mr. DuMont."
1999.98-678,2,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,1907.655,1917.861,"Chief Justice Rehnquist, it is not essential to our argument whether the LAPD could withhold this information from everyone."
1999.98-678,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1931.937,1936.675,Then I gather pages 35 through 49 of your brief were not really essential.
1999.98-678,2,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,1936.675,1938.241,Not to win this case.
1999.98-678,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1968.794,1991.475,"But Mr. Ennis, may I stop you at that first point, because if you regard this case as one where there is no right of access at all, unless the Government chooses to give it, then the Government's choice to give it to some is increasing speech where there would have been none before, so I think it's really important to address the Chief's question."
1999.98-678,2,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,1997.879,2006.152,"--Justice Ginsburg, I think that's a very difficult question, and it's not necessary to resolve that question here."
1999.98-678,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2049.114,2054.918,But I don't understand why you don't answer Justice Ginsburg's question directly.
1999.98-678,2,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2063.156,2065.107,"Your Honor, for the--"
1999.98-678,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2065.107,2066.04,"And if not, why not?"
1999.98-678,2,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2066.04,2066.891,--For the reasons--
1999.98-678,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2066.891,2068.925,Why isn't that a pure access issue?
1999.98-678,2,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2068.925,2081.485,"--For the reasons we list in our brief, it is our view that in this area, arrests, a total denial of access would be highly constitutional suspect."
1999.98-678,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2106.184,2108.819,Under what holding of this Court?
1999.98-678,2,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2112.588,2113.471,"Justice O'Connor, there is--"
1999.98-678,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2113.471,2114.706,--how you back that up.
1999.98-678,2,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2114.706,2117.742,--there is no specific holding of this Court--
1999.98-678,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2117.742,2118.275,No.
1999.98-678,2,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2118.275,2123.829,"--which you could apply to say, as a rote matter, we would win that general access point."
