1973.73-640,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,60.659,We will hear arguments next in 73-640 Geduldig against Aiello.
1973.73-640,0,29509,joanne_condas,,66.605,69.9,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1973.73-640,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,319.22,328.839,"Mrs. Condas, you told us about the Rhode island experience and the fact that Rhode Island was the first state to have any such plan as this and California the second."
1973.73-640,0,29509,joanne_condas,,332.024,334.648,Yes Mr. Justice Stewart.
1973.73-640,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,337.34,345.885,"Well I just wondered if any of the states now have the plan to provide maternity benefits, currently."
1973.73-640,0,29509,joanne_condas,,345.885,359.798,"Yes currently, perhaps the best example of the potential problems that we are discussing is the State of Hawaii and Hawaii, in May amended its law to provide coverage for pregnancy."
1973.73-640,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,377.837,381.603,"It doesn’t go on a percentage out there, it is fixed sum in dollars?"
1973.73-640,0,29509,joanne_condas,,381.603,394.023,"It’s a disability insurance premium charge and as a matter of fact, all but a certain base period as California has a limitation on what the employee can be charged."
1973.73-640,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,445.874,453.434,"And those two states do pay for pregnancy to any of the other three or -- what are they, total of five?"
1973.73-640,0,29509,joanne_condas,,453.434,453.895,Yes.
1973.73-640,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,453.895,455.469,So that leaves two others?
1973.73-640,0,29509,joanne_condas,,455.469,456.933,"Yes, I beg your pardon."
1973.73-640,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,490.775,492.0,"Sick leaves, illness, or injuries?"
1973.73-640,0,29509,joanne_condas,,492.0,500.427,"Yes and I don’t know enough about the details of the plan, to know just what financial impact that has ultimately."
1973.73-640,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,578.869,581.369,"Unless the person is in the hospital, isn’t that correct?"
1973.73-640,0,29509,joanne_condas,,581.369,583.61,That’s correct.
1973.73-640,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,635.973,639.055,"But it is a flat percentage, isn’t it rather than a flat rate?"
1973.73-640,0,29509,joanne_condas,,639.055,640.868,"Well, it’s a flat rate of 1%, yes."
1973.73-640,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,640.868,641.768,1%?
1973.73-640,0,29509,joanne_condas,,656.227,660.442,Well our brief includes some charts.
1973.73-640,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,676.597,677.559,In absolute terms?
1973.73-640,0,29509,joanne_condas,,677.559,680.436,In absolute terms.
1973.73-640,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,824.225,832.127,"Mrs. Condas, are there any exclusions in your plan for particular diseases at all?"
1973.73-640,0,29509,joanne_condas,,832.127,846.404,"Mr. Justice Blackmun, there are none that I am aware of, except that, for example in the case of a diabetic or a person with renal failure who has to go in the hospital once a week or who has an intermittent disease."
1973.73-640,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,857.3,866.327,"Now, most private plans do have disease exclusions, do they not -- I am thinking mainly of psychiatric problems or am I wrong on this?"
1973.73-640,0,29509,joanne_condas,,866.327,877.839,"I have not made a very deep study of private plans, I know that there are various combinations of exclusions which I would like to point out, are generally based on premium cost."
1973.73-640,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,887.486,891.136,But doesn’t California exclude drug addiction for instance?
1973.73-640,0,29509,joanne_condas,,891.136,899.486,"Well there is this one code section which deals with Dipsomania, drug addiction, and sexual psychopaths."
1973.73-640,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,899.486,900.786,So you do have some exclusions?
1973.73-640,0,29509,joanne_condas,,900.786,907.784,"Well, except that it requires that they be under court commitment and that is a fairly archaic practice."
1973.73-640,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,913.965,917.434,"So in absent court commitment, they are covered?"
1973.73-640,0,29509,joanne_condas,,917.434,923.075,That is correct.
1973.73-640,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1232.403,1235.459,What about cosmetic surgery?
1973.73-640,0,29509,joanne_condas,,1235.459,1246.066,We conducted a brief study which indicates that this is truly a de minimis proposition.
1973.73-640,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1246.066,1247.367,Even in California?
1973.73-640,0,29509,joanne_condas,,1253.563,1280.397,"Even in California, at least during the three months which were surveyed, November through February of this past period, a three-month survey was made of all disability claims and it was found that 0.12% of all claims filed were for purely cosmetic surgery and 85.5% of those claims were filed by women."
1973.73-640,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1280.397,1287.832,"Of course, I suppose some of those would run into your short term disability proposition anyway."
1973.73-640,0,29509,joanne_condas,,1287.832,1300.41,"Well, these were claims that were filed so they would have to be either for hospitalization benefits in which there is not the seven-day exclusion or for disabilities that ran into the eighth day."
1973.73-640,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1300.41,1313.466,"Mrs. Condas, before you sit down, some of these original plaintiffs have been fully paid off after the interim decision in the state court, haven’t they?"
1973.73-640,0,29509,joanne_condas,,1313.466,1314.661,"Yes, Mr. Justice."
1973.73-640,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1314.661,1317.925,"So that so far as they are concerned, the case is moot?"
1973.73-640,0,29509,joanne_condas,,1317.925,1318.942,"Yes, Mr. Justice."
1973.73-640,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1334.539,1339.409,Very well.
1973.73-640,1,46465,wendy_w_williams,,1352.463,1355.632,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1973.73-640,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1439.276,1445.803,"How about -- It also covers some peculiarly feminine conditions, hysterectomy, mastectomy?"
1973.73-640,1,46465,wendy_w_williams,,1445.803,1447.813,"That’s correct, Your Honor."
1973.73-640,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1455.358,1460.113,But that does it or does it not cover voluntary abortions?
1973.73-640,1,46465,wendy_w_williams,,1460.113,1465.757,There is some question under the new statute whether it does or does not cover abortions.
1973.73-640,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1494.84,1501.657,"Well of course her choice is not final in the abortion aspect, is this not correct?"
1973.73-640,1,46465,wendy_w_williams,,1501.657,1504.745,"I am sorry, Your Honor, could you clarify the question?"
1973.73-640,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1504.745,1517.685,"You referred to a woman having an abortion when she chooses and I merely asked whether under our decisions, her choice is not a solitary factor that enters into that decision."
1973.73-640,1,46465,wendy_w_williams,,1517.685,1523.072,"As I understand the Roe opinion, it’s a doctor’s decision or maybe --"
1973.73-640,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1523.072,1540.288,Or it will depend upon the California law which would be limited by the Roe decision but within those limits could the California law could take a variety of different forms and impose a variety of different limitations.
1973.73-640,1,46465,wendy_w_williams,,1540.288,1541.809,"Yes, Your Honor."
1973.73-640,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1683.222,1690.055,Has there been some litigation on differential disability rates between women and men?
1973.73-640,1,46465,wendy_w_williams,,1690.055,1702.753,"Yes, as I understand it there are now lawsuits in the New York Area challenging the application of an actuarial basis as between men and women in the granting of insurance benefits."
1973.73-640,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1702.753,1712.184,"So that if California departed from the pooled risk approach and took the differential approach, it would not be out of the woods, I take it?"
1973.73-640,1,46465,wendy_w_williams,,1712.184,1713.762,Minimally it would face lawsuits.
1973.73-640,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1722.457,1734.907,"Well, I suppose an ingenious lawyer under California’s present system could bring a class suit on behalf of all men, couldn’t be that they are discriminated against because they get less for what they pay in?"
1973.73-640,1,46465,wendy_w_williams,,1734.907,1737.784,Well that really brings me to my next point.
1973.73-640,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1737.784,1738.89,Because they’re men.
1973.73-640,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1738.89,1740.9,Because they’re men.
1973.73-640,1,46465,wendy_w_williams,,1740.948,1742.086,And then--
1973.73-640,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1742.086,1742.81,I mean.
1973.73-640,1,46465,wendy_w_williams,,1756.076,1759.448,Men per se do not pay in more and get out less.
1973.73-640,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2272.744,2281.332,Didn’t Shapiro have a footnote in it indicating that insurance claims might be treated differently than ordinary welfare payments?
1973.73-640,1,46465,wendy_w_williams,,2281.332,2284.186,I believe you are referring to footnote 6 in Shapiro --
1973.73-640,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2284.186,2286.164,"Well, you know more of that that I do."
1973.73-640,1,46465,wendy_w_williams,,2286.164,2301.429,That footnote states that a state disability program would be entitled to tie benefits to contribution rate which California now does by its flat 1% rate.
1973.73-640,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2770.133,2775.434,"Well, have they said that they are not disabled or that this is not a kind of a disability contemplated by the statute?"
1973.73-640,1,46465,wendy_w_williams,,2775.434,2784.703,"They have said that normal pregnancy, the pregnancy is a normal physiological function and it does not give rise to illnesses or injuries."
1973.73-640,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2866.717,2878.781,"Mrs. Williams, what is your comment to the question I asked to the opposing counsel, do you conceive that some of these main plaintiffs have a moot case?"
1973.73-640,1,46465,wendy_w_williams,,2878.781,2879.878,"Yes, we do."
1973.73-640,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2879.878,2887.196,But you think that the one Mrs. Jaramillo still is one as far as the controversy is concerned?
1973.73-640,1,46465,wendy_w_williams,,2887.196,2889.234,"Yes, I believe it is."
1973.73-640,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2970.072,2984.551,"Mrs. Williams, does your -- as I understood your argument, it depends entirely upon the claim that this is discrimination based upon gender, am I mistaken about that?"
1973.73-640,1,46465,wendy_w_williams,,3025.421,3026.819,"No, Your Honor, it is not."
1973.73-640,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3040.556,3042.192,[Inaudible]
1973.73-640,1,46465,wendy_w_williams,,3044.216,3047.917,"Well, in this particular case I don’t think it’s a matter of being ingenious."
1973.73-640,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3057.388,3067.293,"In other words, it would not be an answer to your argument to conclude that this is not gender discrimination?"
1973.73-640,1,46465,wendy_w_williams,,3068.746,3069.644,"No, it would not."
1973.73-640,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3069.644,3070.571,-- directed to.
1973.73-640,1,46465,wendy_w_williams,,3070.571,3072.741,"No, it would not."
1973.73-640,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3072.741,3082.135,"Mrs. Williams, you suggested that you might want to respond to some material if you will respond in that sense rather than introducing new matter."
1973.73-640,1,46465,wendy_w_williams,,3088.588,3090.69,"Thank you, Your Honor, I will do that."
1973.73-640,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3100.461,3102.918,I believe there is another question here too.
1973.73-640,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3102.918,3108.227,"Mrs. Williams, I would like to ask you a question that is irrelevant to legal argument."
1973.73-640,1,46465,wendy_w_williams,,3120.378,3126.082,It recently of course considered complications of pregnancy in the passage of the bill.
1973.73-640,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3139.834,3148.055,"At the time of that change where the legislative hearings, public hearings were the attentive for members of public to appear and testify?"
1973.73-640,1,46465,wendy_w_williams,,3148.055,3150.356,"I believe so, yes."
1973.73-640,2,29509,joanne_condas,,3194.353,3202.947,I should like to respond to the question concerning further legislative consideration of inclusion of pregnancy.
1973.73-640,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3325.048,3326.109,There are only three.
1973.73-640,2,29509,joanne_condas,,3326.109,3327.967,I beg your pardon?
1973.73-640,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3609.959,3611.064,In which it isn’t.
1973.73-640,2,29509,joanne_condas,,3611.064,3615.29,"In which it is not, but let us assume that for the sake of argument."
1973.73-640,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3648.207,3656.142,Mrs. Condas I interrupted you and I wonder if you could just summarize again these five parts of the elephant?
1973.73-640,2,29509,joanne_condas,,3657.519,3658.806,I will be happy to.
1973.73-640,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3703.093,3705.754,"That is one aspect of cost, isn’t it?"
1973.73-640,2,29509,joanne_condas,,3705.754,3708.32,"Yes, yes it is."
1973.73-640,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3750.125,3750.908,Thank you ladies.
