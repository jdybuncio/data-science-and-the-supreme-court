2002.01-1229,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.94,"We'll hear argument now in Number 01-1229, Pierce County v. Ignacio Guillen."
2002.01-1229,0,20962,daniel_r_hamilton,,12.932,15.686,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2002.01-1229,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,74.539,78.819,Would you help us figure out how to interpret this statute?
2002.01-1229,0,20962,daniel_r_hamilton,,78.819,79.764,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2002.01-1229,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,79.764,84.981,"It says data, highway safety data compiled or collected by a State."
2002.01-1229,0,20962,daniel_r_hamilton,,99.754,100.505,"Yes, Your Honor."
2002.01-1229,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,100.505,108.874,And those presumably are not either compiled or collected for the purpose of getting highway funding from the Federal Government.
2002.01-1229,0,20962,daniel_r_hamilton,,116.41,119.422,"Your Honor, no, that's not completely correct."
2002.01-1229,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,119.422,119.7,No?
2002.01-1229,0,20962,daniel_r_hamilton,,119.7,130.401,"They are collected and compiled for purposes of highway hazard identification, essentially, from the very beginning."
2002.01-1229,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,130.401,140.435,"--Well, don't you suppose that at least in some jurisdictions, maybe not Tacoma, but in some jurisdictions you will find just ordinary police reports--"
2002.01-1229,0,20962,daniel_r_hamilton,,140.435,141.337,"Well, it's my--"
2002.01-1229,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,141.337,160.355,"--of accidents, and sometime later, perhaps the State might decide, or the county, I'd like to have some Federal money to make some changes at that crossing, and maybe we can use some of the data to assemble it to try to apply for Federal money."
2002.01-1229,0,20962,daniel_r_hamilton,,164.344,173.032,"--Well, in the... if I understand the hypothetical, the... Your Honor is postulating a situation where there is an accident report purely State in origin."
2002.01-1229,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,191.927,200.027,So your point is that the police officers are using a kind of a unified Federal traffic report--
2002.01-1229,0,20962,daniel_r_hamilton,,200.027,200.6,--Essentially--
2002.01-1229,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,200.6,201.328,--when there's an accident?
2002.01-1229,0,20962,daniel_r_hamilton,,201.328,217.06,"--The forms are not all the same, because each State has the right to choose how to put it together, but the elements of the forms are dramatically Federal in their nature, and they're Federal totally directed toward the issue of highway design."
2002.01-1229,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,231.802,233.406,"Well, let me ask you this."
2002.01-1229,0,20962,daniel_r_hamilton,,282.925,293.496,"I don't believe so, Your Honor, and the county's position, and we believe it's well-founded, is that the constitutional issue is not an excuse for artificially narrowly interpreting--"
2002.01-1229,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,293.496,311.435,"Well, but I think that our Court has always preferred, along the lines suggested by Justice O'Connor and Justice Kennedy, to construe a statute to avoid constitutional problems if we can, and certainly the respondents here at least suggest there are several different constructions."
2002.01-1229,0,20962,daniel_r_hamilton,,315.053,324.295,"--Well, I've... I'm happy... in fact, I had intended to, if given the opportunity, to provide the Court the way the county believes the statute should be interpreted."
2002.01-1229,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,324.295,325.507,"Well, I'll give you that opportunity right now."
2002.01-1229,0,20962,daniel_r_hamilton,,325.507,325.722,Okay.
2002.01-1229,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,325.956,338.608,"Yes, that's our question, and you might bear in mind if you wish that I think we generally construe evidentiary privileges narrowly."
2002.01-1229,0,20962,daniel_r_hamilton,,338.608,339.159,Yes.
2002.01-1229,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,427.413,429.157,You're telling us what's wrong with the other reading.
2002.01-1229,0,20962,daniel_r_hamilton,,430.428,464.652,"--Our reading, Your Honor, is that there should be... this Court should establish a bright line rule that documents collect... as the language says, for... we would ask the Court to enforce the language of the statute, which reads, documents and data, quote, compiled or collected for the purpose, end quote, of specified highway safety programs, and here's the operative language, quote, shall not be subject to discovery or admitted into evidence in a Federal or State proceeding or considered for any other purposes in any action for damages arising from any occurrence at a location mentioned or addressed in those documents or data."
2002.01-1229,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,465.235,466.504,It doesn't say documents.
2002.01-1229,0,20962,daniel_r_hamilton,,470.184,471.069,--Yes--
2002.01-1229,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,471.069,471.849,--after the noun.
2002.01-1229,0,20962,daniel_r_hamilton,,471.849,472.476,--Yes.
2002.01-1229,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,472.993,475.134,The noun you inserted was documents.
2002.01-1229,0,20962,daniel_r_hamilton,,475.134,475.444,--Yes.
2002.01-1229,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,475.989,476.763,It says--
2002.01-1229,0,20962,daniel_r_hamilton,,476.763,477.566,--references to specific types.
2002.01-1229,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,477.566,478.449,"--It says data, doesn't it?"
2002.01-1229,0,20962,daniel_r_hamilton,,478.449,484.848,"It says data, and also lists reports, lists... and that sort of thing, and I was trying to condense it down, but yes."
2002.01-1229,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,484.848,499.022,"To be plain, do you mean that everything that goes to the Public Works Department, everything that eventually gets to the Public Works Department and is relevant to the safety of highway crossings is exempt from discovery?"
2002.01-1229,0,20962,daniel_r_hamilton,,499.022,501.257,"Yes, Your Honor, that is what we're saying."
2002.01-1229,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,501.257,524.556,"Every fact, so that if the Department of Environmental Protection has prepared a report saying the accidents are wrecking the grass and the flowers at an intersection, and that report is then given to whatever the data collection agency here is for this purpose, that all of that data, including the data in the Department of Environmental Protection, is then covered by the privilege?"
2002.01-1229,0,20962,daniel_r_hamilton,,525.366,532.578,To the extent that characterization goes to the data that's in the reports.
2002.01-1229,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,534.562,535.321,That's my question.
2002.01-1229,0,20962,daniel_r_hamilton,,535.321,535.619,--Yes.
2002.01-1229,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,535.619,538.016,The same data is in the environmental report.
2002.01-1229,0,20962,daniel_r_hamilton,,548.714,562.416,"We believe the... again, if it meets the test of dealing with an occurrence at a... again, following the language of the statute, an occurrence at the location mentioned or addressed in such reports in the damage action, then that report that it's collected and compiled by--"
2002.01-1229,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,562.416,564.157,I'm not talking about the report.
2002.01-1229,0,20962,daniel_r_hamilton,,566.545,566.91,--Yes.
2002.01-1229,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,566.91,568.291,The data in the report.
2002.01-1229,0,20962,daniel_r_hamilton,,568.291,568.641,Well--
2002.01-1229,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,568.641,570.409,Does that... does that data--
2002.01-1229,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,570.409,571.251,--You can answer that yes or no.
2002.01-1229,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,571.251,572.006,--become subject to the privilege?
2002.01-1229,0,20962,daniel_r_hamilton,,572.006,590.005,"--Yes, if Your Honor means, when you say data, going to the report to get the data, to... if you were to... if that person who wanted to raise that issue were to go to the person who, or the entity that created that information, and were to depose that, those people, they could get the information that way."
2002.01-1229,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,591.233,598.398,"Then your... then the answer to my question, I guess, is no, the data does not become, as such, subject to the privilege."
2002.01-1229,0,20962,daniel_r_hamilton,,605.862,606.45,"--Yes, you can."
2002.01-1229,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,606.45,606.714,Okay.
2002.01-1229,0,20962,daniel_r_hamilton,,606.714,607.824,"Yes, and I'm sorry I misunderstood you."
2002.01-1229,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,607.824,608.41,"Well, could you--"
2002.01-1229,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,608.41,609.391,--What if you don't have to depose them?
2002.01-1229,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,609.391,613.057,--go to the Police Department under this uniform Federal form you were telling us about it?
2002.01-1229,0,20962,daniel_r_hamilton,,613.057,614.55,"I'm sorry, I missed the question."
2002.01-1229,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,614.55,620.99,You said at the outset that there's a uniform document for collisions or crashes or something.
2002.01-1229,0,20962,daniel_r_hamilton,,620.99,621.333,Yes.
2002.01-1229,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,621.333,622.59,And the Police Department fills it out.
2002.01-1229,0,20962,daniel_r_hamilton,,624.665,634.419,"Under our interpretation, you could find the officer, you could depose the officer, but you cannot get the report if it's collected and filed for hazard identification."
2002.01-1229,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,634.419,639.118,"Well, so then Justice Souter's hypothetical is different from this."
2002.01-1229,0,20962,daniel_r_hamilton,,647.016,647.301,No--
2002.01-1229,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,647.301,649.087,You didn't say he could get the document.
2002.01-1229,0,20962,daniel_r_hamilton,,649.087,649.238,--No.
2002.01-1229,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,649.238,650.644,You said you could depose him--
2002.01-1229,0,20962,daniel_r_hamilton,,650.644,650.908,Yes.
2002.01-1229,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,650.908,652.812,--and that was what my question was going to be.
2002.01-1229,0,20962,daniel_r_hamilton,,662.207,662.467,"Yes, Your Honor."
2002.01-1229,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,663.879,668.83,Why?
2002.01-1229,0,20962,daniel_r_hamilton,,676.367,678.872,--I think that certainly is a fair interpretation of the statute.
2002.01-1229,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,697.5,701.245,They could get a police report of an accident.
2002.01-1229,0,20962,daniel_r_hamilton,,704.888,715.168,"Your Honor, before the 1966 Highway Safety Act they could not get an accident, a collection of accident reports, at least in Washington State, and it's my understanding Nation-wide, just by asking for them--"
2002.01-1229,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,715.168,722.372,But you could certainly get a police... at least judging from my own practice in Arizona you could certainly get an individual police report of an accident.
2002.01-1229,0,20962,daniel_r_hamilton,,722.372,722.604,--Yes.
2002.01-1229,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,737.795,741.663,"No, but you could ask for the police report of the particular accident that you were concerned with."
2002.01-1229,0,20962,daniel_r_hamilton,,741.663,744.511,"Prior to 1966, yes, Your Honor, that's correct."
2002.01-1229,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,744.818,745.962,I'm still slightly mixed up.
2002.01-1229,0,20962,daniel_r_hamilton,,745.962,746.397,--Okay.
2002.01-1229,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,746.397,760.605,"Imagine the forest service in the State collects, because they have tree lovers, a piece of paper that says the elm trees at the intersection of such-and-such were diseased, all right."
2002.01-1229,0,20962,daniel_r_hamilton,,794.936,795.36,No.
2002.01-1229,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,795.36,796.374,No?
2002.01-1229,0,20962,daniel_r_hamilton,,796.374,796.831,No.
2002.01-1229,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,796.831,797.286,Very well.
2002.01-1229,0,20962,daniel_r_hamilton,,818.482,820.12,Let me think about that for a minute.
2002.01-1229,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,820.12,821.747,"Well, I don't see what the difference would be."
2002.01-1229,0,20962,daniel_r_hamilton,,835.676,836.241,I think what they copied--
2002.01-1229,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,836.241,846.605,"--and that's why, you see, exactly why I find your interpretation of the statute rather strained, so what is the answer to what my hypothetical suggests?"
2002.01-1229,0,20962,daniel_r_hamilton,,846.605,856.705,"--Well, since my answer would be strained if I said the photo, the telephone book, what I'm referring to would be what was written down for the purposes, and collected for the purposes--"
2002.01-1229,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,856.705,860.906,But you said that they could not get the piece of paper--
2002.01-1229,0,20962,daniel_r_hamilton,,860.906,861.062,--Yes.
2002.01-1229,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,861.062,861.944,--in the Tree Division--
2002.01-1229,0,20962,daniel_r_hamilton,,861.944,862.407,The--
2002.01-1229,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,862.407,873.353,--and all I'm having trouble is distinguishing between the piece of paper written for tree health and the address in the telephone book written so people can know where people should be phoned.
2002.01-1229,0,20962,daniel_r_hamilton,,873.353,877.4,--The piece of paper written for tree help... and I'm sorry I misunderstood the question.
2002.01-1229,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,898.319,904.749,But what is there that suggests that Congress wanted to change the game to that extent?
2002.01-1229,0,20962,daniel_r_hamilton,,922.92,927.092,"Your Honor, we... respectfully, we disagree with that characterization of our position."
2002.01-1229,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,927.092,934.885,"Well, you just, in response to the Chief's question, said that at least the police report of this accident was routine."
2002.01-1229,0,20962,daniel_r_hamilton,,934.885,946.706,"The police report of this accident, when you go and ask for... and the reason why is because... because of the Highway Safety Act, 1966 Highway Safety Act, the accident reports were indexed by location."
2002.01-1229,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,956.293,957.558,"But that's not because of a privilege, is it?"
2002.01-1229,0,20962,daniel_r_hamilton,,957.558,958.216,--Yes.
2002.01-1229,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,960.356,964.149,"I thought the reason for that is the police said, look, we don't have to do your homework for you."
2002.01-1229,0,20962,daniel_r_hamilton,,970.026,971.956,"Yes, because the police don't do that."
2002.01-1229,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,976.496,989.937,"Okay, so in the past, then, and in accordance with Justice Ginsburg's question, you could have asked for the police report, and in Justice Breyer's example, I presume you could have gone to the Tree Division and said, let's have the slip of paper that says the elm trees are diseased."
2002.01-1229,0,20962,daniel_r_hamilton,,991.094,993.222,"Well, Your Honor, I believe that--"
2002.01-1229,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,993.222,1008.484,"And Justice Ginsburg's question is, I thought it was supposed to leave things, as it were, level, the way they were, that a disadvantage was not being created, it was simply, the intent was simply to avoid creating a new advantage which would deter the State."
2002.01-1229,0,20962,daniel_r_hamilton,,1010.615,1021.089,"--I think the purpose, yes, Your Honor, is to avoid discouraging States from participating, and allowing them to get accident reports from the hands of third parties does discourage States from participating."
2002.01-1229,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1021.089,1022.489,Would you like to reserve your time?
2002.01-1229,0,20962,daniel_r_hamilton,,1022.489,1022.948,"Yes, I would, Your Honor."
2002.01-1229,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1023.584,1025.698,Mr. Clement.
2002.01-1229,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1025.698,1039.577,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2002.01-1229,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1071.32,1087.303,"Well, what about documents created not for the purpose of getting Federal funds, not for section 152, but for some other purpose, some of which are later incorporated in a Federal funding application--"
2002.01-1229,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1087.303,1088.965,I think those documents--
2002.01-1229,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1088.965,1089.656,--by a different agency?
2002.01-1229,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1089.656,1113.652,"--I think those documents, Justice O'Connor, would be discoverable and admissible if the documents were sought from the party that collected them for a purpose different than the Federal highway funding purposes, but what the statute, I think, does prohibit is somebody going to the State Highway Traffic Department and essentially engaging in a one-stop shopping enterprise where they can get all sorts of documents that have been collected--"
2002.01-1229,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1113.652,1117.216,But you differ from petitioner in your reading of the statute.
2002.01-1229,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1119.747,1137.503,"--That's exactly right, Justice O'Connor, and so as a result of our interpretation of the statute, the typical police accident report can be obtained from the Police Department and, I think with respect to Justice Breyer's hypothetical, the report about the tree can be obtained from the State Tree Department or the State Environmental Department."
2002.01-1229,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1137.503,1144.441,"Let me ask a somewhat different question, although I'm not sure we've resolved the point that we've been inquiring about."
2002.01-1229,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1150.276,1154.437,"I think that's a difficult question, Justice Kennedy."
2002.01-1229,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1196.745,1198.315,"Let me just interrupt you, if I may."
2002.01-1229,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1210.723,1214.623,I think the admissibility of those materials--
2002.01-1229,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1214.623,1216.602,I'm just asking you about showing them to the plaintiff.
2002.01-1229,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1216.602,1228.321,"--I think there's a sense in which it would violate the Federal statute, but I'm not suggesting that the Department of Transportation is going to be able to leap to the defense of the statute in that hypothetical and assert the interests of the statute."
2002.01-1229,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1239.054,1241.877,"Well, supposing this simply comes up during a trial."
2002.01-1229,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1257.116,1259.408,"I don't think so, Chief Justice."
2002.01-1229,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1283.108,1285.795,"With these rights, is it a matter of discretion for the trial court?"
2002.01-1229,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1301.634,1305.602,"--Well, I'm suggesting that the language of the statute is mandatory."
2002.01-1229,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1314.694,1319.626,How would this be enforced by the Federal Government?
2002.01-1229,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1353.715,1365.291,"I think under the circumstances that you're envisioning, Justice Ginsburg, the Federal Government would not provide funds under 152 or 130 or 144 to that particular locality."
2002.01-1229,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1365.291,1380.525,"So you're saying that the 409 privilege is not simply a right of the State agency, but is... that the funding depends on the State's asserting that privilege?"
2002.01-1229,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1380.525,1386.943,It certainly depends on the States or the localities abiding by that privilege as a general matter.
2002.01-1229,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1480.985,1488.233,"Mr. Clement, one of the arguments made by respondent Guillen is that... is a Tenth Amendment argument."
2002.01-1229,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1491.186,1518.341,"I think the better view is that he doesn't have standing to raise that argument, and I'll also suggest that if they wanted to make a Tenth Amendment argument, and wanted this Court to decide the difficult question of whether or not an individual had standing to raise a Tenth Amendment argument, that they probably should have raised the Tenth Amendment argument before the conclusion section of their brief, and I think this Court would be well-advised not to definitively decide whether or not an individual had standing to raise a Tenth Amendment issue."
2002.01-1229,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1519.115,1539.584,"Why... what's special about the... this is just an assertion that the Federal Government has no authority to do what it has done, and you say an individual who has been harmed by the Federal Government's exceeding its authority does not have standing to challenge?"
2002.01-1229,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1542.729,1548.23,"--Well, Justice Scalia, I don't think all Tenth Amendment challenges are created equal, and I think therein lies the difference."
2002.01-1229,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1556.359,1558.019,But that's all it--
2002.01-1229,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1558.019,1559.428,--How about a Commerce Clause challenge?
2002.01-1229,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1559.428,1559.722,Yes.
2002.01-1229,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1559.722,1560.32,--Absolutely.
2002.01-1229,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1578.394,1581.299,"Well, we allow those challenges all the time in separation of powers cases."
2002.01-1229,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1581.299,1586.951,"I think that's right, but Justice Kennedy, I think there's something that certainly seems different."
2002.01-1229,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1601.514,1605.1,Why couldn't you say the same thing for the Executive and the legislature in a case like Chadha?
2002.01-1229,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1605.1,1617.606,"Again, I think you could, and I think that's why with respect to a more typical Tenth Amendment challenge that's based on an enumerated power, or the lack of an enumerated power, there would be standing."
2002.01-1229,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1618.69,1625.579,"I don't... whenever the Government goes beyond its enumerated power, it is infringing upon the powers of the States, isn't it?"
2002.01-1229,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1625.579,1627.109,--Well--
2002.01-1229,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1627.109,1636.171,"All the Tenth Amendment says is, you know, other than the enumerated powers, the other powers continue where they used to be, with the States."
2002.01-1229,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1639.837,1649.915,"In Buckley v. Valeo we held that the Appointment Clause, where the President had signed the legislation, could be raised by private individuals."
2002.01-1229,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1649.915,1652.587,"--No, I understand that, and that was also true in Chadha."
2002.01-1229,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1741.382,1755.637,"Don't you think that our opinion in the Commerce Clause case, in order to have persuasive force, should begin with an interpretation of the statute, recognize that a privilege can be waived or not waived?"
2002.01-1229,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1762.418,1774.115,"I agree with you entirely, Justice Kennedy, that this Court should define the scope of the statute before deciding whether or not it's constitutional, and we would urge the United States' construction of the statute."
2002.01-1229,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1791.048,1794.035,"Do we have a final State decision here, Mr. Clement?"
2002.01-1229,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1794.035,1813.34,"I think you do have a final State decision, and I think that's most clear with respect to the PDA action... that's the State Public Disclosure Act that was brought... because in that case the Washington supreme court held that the four documents were disclosable and said that attorney's fees would be appropriate."
2002.01-1229,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1814.164,1821.365,"There was a fifth document, though, and they didn't... there was no appeal on that one, right?"
2002.01-1229,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1821.365,1828.016,"--Well, but there was no cross-appeal on that document either, Justice Scalia, so I think that document is no longer part of the case."
2002.01-1229,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1854.171,1910.59,"Mr. Clement, there was... you said that the PDA suit, the four documents were required to be turned over under that, but I thought the Washington supreme court said that accident reports from nonofficers, from witnesses, would not be disclosable under the PDA, though they would be subject to discovery under rule 26(b), so the notion that the PDA suit was the one that determined that these four documents were required to be turned over, I don't understand that, because I thought there was one part at least, the reports from nonofficers, that the county prevailed on before the Washington supreme court, but that it was a Pyrrhic victory because they lost on that point under 26(b)."
2002.01-1229,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1910.59,1914.445,"--That's not how I read the decision, Justice Ginsburg."
2002.01-1229,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1920.58,1934.096,"Did you read the decision to say that these documents are not disclosable under our Freedom of Information Act, nevertheless they can be discovered in a civil litigation?"
2002.01-1229,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1934.096,1936.2,"That's not, with respect, how I read the opinion."
2002.01-1229,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2071.558,2074.434,Do we need to find finality with respect to both?
2002.01-1229,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2074.434,2076.206,"I don't think so, Your Honor."
2002.01-1229,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2083.88,2094.518,"So if I don't want to wrestle with the complexities of the tort action, what would we do, just dismiss that case as improvidently granted and decide the other one?"
2002.01-1229,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2094.518,2109.057,"--I think that would be fair, or this Court could just sort of ignore the tort case and say that it's going to take jurisdiction over the PDA action and decide this Federal statutory issue in the context of the State PDA action, and then--"
2002.01-1229,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2109.057,2109.819,"Well, we can't ignore it."
2002.01-1229,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2114.832,2115.611,"--Well, I--"
2002.01-1229,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2115.611,2116.752,Just hide it under--
2002.01-1229,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2116.752,2118.032,--There's only one case--
2002.01-1229,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2118.032,2131.462,"--I mean, I think that this Court could say that to the extent that the tort action is before it, that that action is not final, and that... or they're not going to... the Court's not going to definitively resolve that, and that the PDA action is final."
2002.01-1229,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2144.413,2145.512,"--We wouldn't want to do that too often, I think."
2002.01-1229,2,41799,salvador_a_mungia,,2204.442,2208.216,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2002.01-1229,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2259.022,2260.557,Why is it intrastate?
2002.01-1229,2,41799,salvador_a_mungia,,2288.769,2289.426,Justice--
2002.01-1229,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2289.426,2290.68,--I... yes.
2002.01-1229,2,41799,salvador_a_mungia,,2290.68,2306.584,"--Justice Breyer, I agree with the Solicitor General's interpretation of the statute, we still get our documents, and I do want to make it clear for the record, and I think it's clear in the briefs, Pierce County took a different tack on this and had a very wide scope of interpretation."
2002.01-1229,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2324.046,2346.896,"Well, that's certainly right, and so Congress says, we have a Federal interest in trying to minimize accidents, and in order to do that, we want to get information from the States when they want our money, and to be sure the information is accurate, we want to be sure that at least the information they give us, they're collecting with an eye towards being accurate rather than with an eye towards protecting themselves from tort litigation."
2002.01-1229,2,41799,salvador_a_mungia,,2346.896,2348.942,Justice--
2002.01-1229,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2348.942,2349.741,It sounds reasonable to me.
2002.01-1229,2,41799,salvador_a_mungia,,2351.534,2362.666,"--Justice Breyer, because the analysis starts, is this commercial or interstate activity that in fact the Federal Government is regulating, and they're not, they're regulating State courts."
2002.01-1229,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2363.716,2370.909,But they're regulating in the interest of a commerce-type thing that's preventing automobile accidents.
2002.01-1229,2,41799,salvador_a_mungia,,2370.909,2385.062,"--That is the disputable part, as to whether or not there's any evidence in, within... not only in the record, or anywhere that can be found, whether this action, indeed, would prevent any further accidents."
2002.01-1229,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2386.729,2391.464,"When Congress makes that judgment, don't we owe it substantial deference?"
2002.01-1229,2,41799,salvador_a_mungia,,2410.98,2415.114,"--Justice Ginsburg, that is the historic and that is the correct analysis."
2002.01-1229,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2448.545,2459.771,May I ask you just to back up for a moment to address the question that Mr. Clement did about the separateness of these two?
2002.01-1229,2,41799,salvador_a_mungia,,2475.084,2477.402,"Justice Ginsburg, no."
2002.01-1229,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2534.25,2549.482,"But the way you interpreted it, although you say it's debatable, is that everything that falls under the PDA, everything that... those four documents, those are not available to you."
2002.01-1229,2,41799,salvador_a_mungia,,2554.678,2573.072,"Correct, and I read the opinion differently, where in fact we do get those documents, and I... we may have a fight back at the trial court as to the language of the Washington State supreme court, because I realize in its opinion it said that those would normally not be discoverable under the PDA, but then you have to look at the purpose of the documents."
2002.01-1229,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2573.072,2577.331,You set forth four alternative interpretations at page 20 of your brief.
2002.01-1229,2,41799,salvador_a_mungia,,2592.108,2607.82,"Justice Kennedy, the documents that we sought under the PDA, even under the narrowest construction, under the narrowest construction, we get the documents, just on a statutory construction under the PDA request."
2002.01-1229,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2607.82,2611.877,But some of the documents you requested fit naturally within your category 1?
2002.01-1229,2,41799,salvador_a_mungia,,2611.877,2612.536,Correct.
2002.01-1229,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2612.536,2613.539,All right.
2002.01-1229,2,41799,salvador_a_mungia,,2613.539,2624.867,"And so at least in this case, this Court need not address the constitutional issues, finding no final judgment in the tort action and, in fact, a narrow construction for the PDA action."
2002.01-1229,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2624.867,2628.737,"I'm sorry, I'm not sure I understood."
2002.01-1229,2,41799,salvador_a_mungia,,2632.515,2637.853,"Of our interpretation, which is a very narrow construction of the statute."
2002.01-1229,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2639.293,2645.026,"In other words, they were documents that were actually prepared to get highway funds?"
2002.01-1229,2,41799,salvador_a_mungia,,2645.026,2646.33,"No, I'm sorry, if I--"
2002.01-1229,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2646.33,2647.975,That's what I understood you to say.
2002.01-1229,2,41799,salvador_a_mungia,,2647.975,2648.631,"--Oh, no, I'm sorry."
2002.01-1229,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2659.227,2664.291,"So in your view, none of the documents that you're... that are in dispute fall within category 1."
2002.01-1229,2,41799,salvador_a_mungia,,2664.291,2669.729,"Correct, under the PDA action, that is correct, not the tort action but the PDA action."
2002.01-1229,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2669.729,2671.362,Do they fall in category 2?
2002.01-1229,2,41799,salvador_a_mungia,,2672.189,2674.615,No.
2002.01-1229,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2685.691,2688.13,Documents the agency has in its possession?
2002.01-1229,2,41799,salvador_a_mungia,,2688.13,2690.896,"--Correct, they fall within category 2."
2002.01-1229,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2747.117,2765.885,"But the construction put forward by the Solicitor General, as I understand it, is you can get it from the agency, like a law enforcement agency, but not from the Public Works Department if the purpose is to implement the Federal program."
2002.01-1229,2,41799,salvador_a_mungia,,2767.996,2769.395,"Yes, Justice Ginsburg."
2002.01-1229,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2769.395,2788.215,"But under that position, I suppose, in the day when we have this great data base and all reports are there initially, then under the Government's approach, everything would be exempt from discovery."
2002.01-1229,2,41799,salvador_a_mungia,,2792.424,2797.582,"Correct, Justice Ginsburg, I do, and that is the day, if it's not today, that this court--"
2002.01-1229,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2797.582,2798.639,"No, I didn't read it that way."
2002.01-1229,2,41799,salvador_a_mungia,,2825.293,2837.546,"--Justice Breyer, as far as interpreting the electronic portion, it probably is a reasonable interpretation, and you're right, I mean, it's not part of this case, but it probably will have to be faced sooner or later."
2002.01-1229,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2900.674,2905.716,I don't see how you can characterize section 409 as a condition.
2002.01-1229,2,41799,salvador_a_mungia,,2929.385,2930.848,"Justice O'Connor, I agree."
2002.01-1229,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2942.554,2942.996,But--
2002.01-1229,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2942.996,2943.797,"--Well, why not?"
2002.01-1229,2,41799,salvador_a_mungia,,2956.034,2973.269,"Under the Spending Clause analysis, this Court has long gone through through Pennhurst, through South Dakota v. Dole, and just recently in Durham v. Gorham, it's clear that the conditions have to be spelled out."
2002.01-1229,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2982.428,2982.997,You'd have another--
2002.01-1229,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2982.997,2987.48,--No State has to participate in this program if it doesn't want to.
2002.01-1229,2,41799,salvador_a_mungia,,2991.04,2997.682,"It can turn down Federal money, and that's the interesting, Mr. Chief Justice, about 409."
2002.01-1229,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3014.831,3015.948,"Well, it can avoid--"
2002.01-1229,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3015.948,3019.674,"--But you can agree, nonetheless, that a State can refuse to participate?"
2002.01-1229,2,41799,salvador_a_mungia,,3035.655,3039.575,"Mr. Chief Justice, I think that's an open question, and I don't necessarily agree with that."
2002.01-1229,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3044.897,3046.695,"You think it's just categorical, then?"
2002.01-1229,2,41799,salvador_a_mungia,,3046.695,3047.066,Correct.
2002.01-1229,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3047.066,3055.769,But how could that be if... how could any document be collected for the purpose of participating in the Federal program if the State doesn't participate in the Federal program?
2002.01-1229,2,41799,salvador_a_mungia,,3055.769,3063.985,"Because if you read section 152, what it mandates States to do is come up with a list and a survey of hazardous sites."
2002.01-1229,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3079.44,3082.426,"Do the list whether or not you have any Federal money, is that what you're saying?"
2002.01-1229,2,41799,salvador_a_mungia,,3097.257,3098.921,"--Justice Ginsburg, that's correct."
2002.01-1229,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3135.117,3142.693,"Aren't we losing sight of the fact, the rather plain fact that the States and the counties wanted this?"
2002.01-1229,2,41799,salvador_a_mungia,,3165.161,3167.286,"Justice Ginsburg, I have two responses."
2002.01-1229,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3188.241,3193.618,"But this very provision they wanted, not the thing in general."
2002.01-1229,2,41799,salvador_a_mungia,,3193.618,3241.31,"And that goes... then to my second part of my response is, and I think it's a fundamental part of the constitutional analysis, because here, if the States wanted this protection they had the means to do it themselves, and this Court has explained, again citing from New York v. U.S., State sovereignty isn't for the benefit of the States, it's for the benefit of the citizens to derive the benefits of liberty from the division of separate powers, so it really, just because State officials want it, it's clearly that the people of the State of Washington did not want this, because it infringed upon a State cause of action."
2002.01-1229,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3246.826,3249.902,"Well, that goes to the waiver point."
2002.01-1229,2,41799,salvador_a_mungia,,3257.602,3269.4,"I... Justice Kennedy, you look at the language, and in fact you look at the early responses by Pierce County, where Pierce County clearly said, we cannot... I mean, we must... we don't have that choice."
2002.01-1229,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3270.358,3273.674,The hypothetical is that the State could waive it if it wanted to.
2002.01-1229,2,41799,salvador_a_mungia,,3275.28,3276.711,--And Justice Kennedy--
2002.01-1229,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3276.711,3277.342,--hypothetical question.
2002.01-1229,2,41799,salvador_a_mungia,,3277.342,3291.351,"--Yes, and I... Justice Kennedy, my response is, I don't see how the State could, because I think just for the very reasons, as was pointed out by the Solicitor General, where do you cross that line between, I guess, a single waiver, and then it becoming endemic."
2002.01-1229,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3338.775,3347.047,"Well, is it irrelevant under your argument that the object of the Federal legislation is safety in an artery of commerce?"
2002.01-1229,2,41799,salvador_a_mungia,,3348.629,3355.911,"Justice Souter, the object at least for the Federal Highway Act is safety."
2002.01-1229,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3378.124,3384.744,"So you that think the Federal interest in this case is comparable to the Federal interest in Lopez, the ultimate interest?"
2002.01-1229,2,41799,salvador_a_mungia,,3384.744,3390.023,"I think that the... Justice Souter, the Federal interest in section 409--"
2002.01-1229,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3390.023,3399.749,"No, I'm talking about the ultimate Federal interest that gives rise to all of this regulation, which is the safety of an artery of commerce."
2002.01-1229,2,41799,salvador_a_mungia,,3413.071,3416.976,"--Justice Souter, I think it's more the latter."
2002.01-1229,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3423.266,3425.955,"Thank you, Mr. Mungia."
2002.01-1229,3,20962,daniel_r_hamilton,,3627.96,3430.332,"Thank you, Your Honor."
2002.01-1229,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3628.511,3629.63,"Thank you, Mr. Hamilton."
