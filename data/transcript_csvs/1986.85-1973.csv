1986.85-1973,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.587,"We will hear arguments next in No. 85-1973, Pope against Illinois."
1986.85-1973,0,26057,glenn_a_stanko,,97.295,101.532,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1986.85-1973,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,181.818,186.054,"Well, we're really just talking about this particular case."
1986.85-1973,0,26057,glenn_a_stanko,,189.006,190.439,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1986.85-1973,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,242.558,254.282,"Well, Mr. Stanko, I don't understand your point when you say that the issue is whether, you know, the majority can run roughshod over... it really isn't an issue of whether the majority can or not."
1986.85-1973,0,26057,glenn_a_stanko,,272.493,273.36,That's not true at all.
1986.85-1973,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,273.36,278.397,All you're insisting is that it be a nationwide standard and not a community standard.
1986.85-1973,0,26057,glenn_a_stanko,,281.099,282.466,"That's not true, Your Honor."
1986.85-1973,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,282.466,283.468,"Oh, then I don't understand your--"
1986.85-1973,0,26057,glenn_a_stanko,,283.468,284.751,I'm not arguing for a standard.
1986.85-1973,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,322.51,330.866,"--Well, are you saying that the jury here then should simply evaluate on its own whether or not there's redeeming value?"
1986.85-1973,0,26057,glenn_a_stanko,,330.866,335.501,I'm saying that the jury should evaluate based on the evidence in the case.
1986.85-1973,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,335.501,338.853,"Well, what sort of evidence would be admissible, under your view?"
1986.85-1973,0,26057,glenn_a_stanko,,338.853,342.424,Any evidence which would relate to the value of the particular work.
1986.85-1973,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,354.397,357.114,And how would the judge charge the jury?
1986.85-1973,0,26057,glenn_a_stanko,,357.114,366.039,"The judge would do more than charge the jury that they are to determine if the work, in Illinois, under this statute, was utterly without redeeming social value."
1986.85-1973,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,372.609,381.799,"But he wouldn't say any... he wouldn't have to say anything else that, you know, you must give some consideration to the expert testimony and that sort of thing?"
1986.85-1973,0,26057,glenn_a_stanko,,381.799,385.351,"No, I don't think he has to say anything about the expert testimony."
1986.85-1973,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,397.741,400.926,"Well, what difference would this make in the outcome of any case?"
1986.85-1973,0,26057,glenn_a_stanko,,406.264,422.209,"Because in many cases, particularly when you have a small community, the jury could ascertain that in this community this work would be found to be unacceptable, and we find that it would be obscene, applying contemporary community standards."
1986.85-1973,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,435.433,440.253,Do you think jurors would do that without any more charge than you've suggested from the judge?
1986.85-1973,0,26057,glenn_a_stanko,,440.253,444.139,"I think they can and do that everyday, Mr. Chief Justice."
1986.85-1973,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,444.139,453.811,"Mr. Stanko, may I inquire whether the petitioner offered any evidence that the materials here had redeeming social value?"
1986.85-1973,0,26057,glenn_a_stanko,,453.811,457.347,"There was no evidence offered in either one of these cases, Your Honor."
1986.85-1973,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,457.347,462.601,Then how would the petitioner be prejudiced here?
1986.85-1973,0,26057,glenn_a_stanko,,462.601,472.106,"Well, in each of these cases, an attack was made on the validity of the statute, both as written and construed."
1986.85-1973,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,491.436,500.059,"But you lost on that issue, and the petitioner was tried and convicted."
1986.85-1973,0,26057,glenn_a_stanko,,500.059,502.078,--That's correct.
1986.85-1973,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,517.919,520.039,But you didn't even make an offer of proof?
1986.85-1973,0,26057,glenn_a_stanko,,520.039,520.755,That's correct.
1986.85-1973,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,525.341,529.145,xxx an instruction to consider community standards?
1986.85-1973,0,26057,glenn_a_stanko,,529.145,530.378,"Yes, there was."
1986.85-1973,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,530.378,534.097,So the jury was told to look to community standards?
1986.85-1973,0,26057,glenn_a_stanko,,534.097,538.851,"The phrasing of the instruction allowed the jury to apply community standards, that's correct, Your Honor."
1986.85-1973,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,538.851,541.036,What instruction did you request?
1986.85-1973,0,26057,glenn_a_stanko,,541.036,550.808,"In the Morrison case, there was a specific instruction which included community standards in the first two elements and excluded it from the third element."
1986.85-1973,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,578.226,580.494,"I must say, you've sort of thrown me off."
1986.85-1973,0,26057,glenn_a_stanko,,602.193,610.697,"Well, the relief sought in each case flows from a constitutional facial attack on the statute."
1986.85-1973,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,696.655,698.671,"Mr. Stanko, may I interrupt you on that point?"
1986.85-1973,0,26057,glenn_a_stanko,,704.409,706.861,--It's a question of fact for the jury.
1986.85-1973,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,721.936,725.888,"Maybe there's a third category: fact, law and taste."
1986.85-1973,0,26057,glenn_a_stanko,,725.888,734.678,"Well, I suppose taste might enter into the court's determination of the fact, but that's the way I would view--"
1986.85-1973,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,734.678,735.446,I'm a little unclear.
1986.85-1973,0,26057,glenn_a_stanko,,749.79,773.405,"--Beginning with Jacobellis v. Ohio and on through the Miller line of cases, Smith v. United States, this Court has recognized in an obscenity case any appellate court, and ultimately this Court, has an independent... has an obligation to independently constitutionally review the facts pertaining to obscenity."
1986.85-1973,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,773.405,774.021,I understand.
1986.85-1973,0,26057,glenn_a_stanko,,785.463,790.748,"I think it's broader on the third element, Your Honor, necessarily so."
1986.85-1973,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,842.614,850.703,"Mr. Stanko, I was not being entirely facetious when I said, you know, there may be three categories."
1986.85-1973,0,26057,glenn_a_stanko,,928.37,937.677,"There are many situations in which something may have value, but only a minority of people, but not to a majority of people."
1986.85-1973,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,988.193,1002.537,"But each one is to judge on the basis of his own determination, not looking to national standards, do art critics nationally think so, do other communities think so, but rather, the juror is to look at it and say, this has artistic merit."
1986.85-1973,0,26057,glenn_a_stanko,,1005.337,1008.524,--I want the jury to look at it based on the evidence.
1986.85-1973,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1016.01,1019.396,"Art is personal opinion, is what I'm suggesting."
1986.85-1973,0,26057,glenn_a_stanko,,1019.396,1019.796,Well--
1986.85-1973,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1019.796,1024.282,"Unless you look to a national standard or a community standard, there's nothing else but opinion."
1986.85-1973,0,26057,glenn_a_stanko,,1024.282,1039.376,"--I would suggest that evidence can be adduced about works that could show the jury that although their taste did not extend to these works, that there was a significant segment of society had value."
1986.85-1973,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1039.792,1049.316,"Now you're back to saying that what the instruction has to be, ask the jury whether nationally a lot of people would consider this to have artistic merit."
1986.85-1973,0,26057,glenn_a_stanko,,1054.386,1057.421,--The evidence could be national in scope.
1986.85-1973,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1102.985,1111.406,"Is there ever in these cases, or was there in this, any attempt by the judge to tell the jury what value meant?"
1986.85-1973,0,26057,glenn_a_stanko,,1111.406,1112.258,No.
1986.85-1973,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1119.245,1122.397,Except that they said community standards.
1986.85-1973,0,26057,glenn_a_stanko,,1122.397,1125.649,"Community standards applied to all three elements, yes."
1986.85-1973,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1128.268,1130.82,Was there a definition of community standards?
1986.85-1973,0,26057,glenn_a_stanko,,1130.82,1131.686,--No.
1986.85-1973,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1141.158,1142.558,So it's a statewide standard?
1986.85-1973,0,26057,glenn_a_stanko,,1142.558,1144.627,"That's a statewide standard, that's correct."
1986.85-1973,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1144.627,1146.312,And the jury is told that?
1986.85-1973,0,26057,glenn_a_stanko,,1146.312,1150.931,"Yes, they are."
1986.85-1973,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1269.007,1271.793,xxx just parochial?
1986.85-1973,0,26057,glenn_a_stanko,,1271.793,1273.509,--It's a State of Illinois standard.
1986.85-1973,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1290.338,1291.721,Where was this case tried?
1986.85-1973,0,26057,glenn_a_stanko,,1292.338,1294.389,"No, this case was tried in Rockford."
1986.85-1973,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1294.389,1294.839,Rockford.
1986.85-1973,0,26057,glenn_a_stanko,,1294.839,1296.674,Ninety miles northwest of Chicago.
1986.85-1973,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1296.674,1298.008,Winnebago County.
1986.85-1973,0,26057,glenn_a_stanko,,1298.008,1303.645,The jury was selected on a... juries in Illinois of course come from the country.
1986.85-1973,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1311.584,1313.786,What's the population of that country?
1986.85-1973,0,26057,glenn_a_stanko,,1315.903,1316.905,Of Winnebago County?
1986.85-1973,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1316.905,1317.705,Yes.
1986.85-1973,0,26057,glenn_a_stanko,,1317.705,1318.788,"250,000."
1986.85-1973,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1318.788,1322.226,"250,000."
1986.85-1973,0,26057,glenn_a_stanko,,1322.226,1331.915,"The idea is, with majoritarian rule, when it comes to value, we freeze the state of knowledge on certain things."
1986.85-1973,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1363.903,1365.586,I don't understand what you just said.
1986.85-1973,0,26057,glenn_a_stanko,,1371.607,1387.001,"What I'm saying is that if we suppress works based on majority view, then works that may have value, albeit to a significant... albeit to a majority... minority of society, may never have the opportunity to grow and develop."
1986.85-1973,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1387.001,1390.453,"That may be true, but how do you charge the jury?"
1986.85-1973,0,26057,glenn_a_stanko,,1398.274,1402.178,"Well, I don't think case involves the scope of what the charge would be."
1986.85-1973,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1418.037,1428.828,"--And you're confident that on the basis of that instruction the jury is going to come to a conclusion that if a minority somewhere thinks it has redeeming social value, the jury has to find it has redeeming social value?"
1986.85-1973,0,26057,glenn_a_stanko,,1428.828,1433.947,"I think if there's evidence to that effect, and the jury believes that evidence, it can make that determination."
1986.85-1973,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1433.947,1439.184,I would find that a confusing xxx way as a juror member who got that charge.
1986.85-1973,0,26057,glenn_a_stanko,,1441.736,1444.838,"Well, certainly, there would be opportunities for states to develop that charge."
1986.85-1973,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1465.451,1474.39,"--Mr. Stanko, it occurs to me, there might be cases in which it would be more favorable to the defendant to use the local standard rather than the national standard."
1986.85-1973,0,26057,glenn_a_stanko,,1490.983,1492.602,"Well, that may be true."
1986.85-1973,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1689.881,1691.181,"Thank you, Mr. Stanko--"
1986.85-1973,1,41240,sally_louise_dilgart,,1697.785,1705.057,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1986.85-1973,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1820.849,1824.717,Is it your view that in order to decide this case we have to read these magazines?
1986.85-1973,1,41240,sally_louise_dilgart,,1824.717,1838.144,"--It's been my understanding of the Court's decisions in the past, Your Honor, under appellate review, that the Court will undertake that duty, and has a constitutional obligation to conduct a review to make sure that the First Amendment has not been violated in this case."
1986.85-1973,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1838.144,1841.512,"Were they set forth in the Joint Appendix, the parts that you're saying we should look at?"
1986.85-1973,1,41240,sally_louise_dilgart,,1841.512,1842.712,"I'm sorry, I couldn't hear the first part."
1986.85-1973,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1842.712,1847.166,Are the portions of the magazines that you think we should look at in the Joint Appendix?
1986.85-1973,1,41240,sally_louise_dilgart,,1847.166,1852.737,"No, it's my understanding that all the magazines as people's exhibits, and are within the record in that matter."
1986.85-1973,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1852.737,1856.022,"But you think we should read them, even though you didn't bother to put them in the Joint Appendix?"
1986.85-1973,1,41240,sally_louise_dilgart,,1856.022,1860.391,"That would be correct, Your Honor."
1986.85-1973,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2010.622,2026.116,"What do you do about the publisher who thinks that he has something of artistic merit, but it has material in it that he thinks would offend some communities' sensitivities, explicit sexual material."
1986.85-1973,1,41240,sally_louise_dilgart,,2041.41,2043.127,"I would submit three things to you, Your Honor."
1986.85-1973,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2046.195,2046.981,I understand that.
1986.85-1973,1,41240,sally_louise_dilgart,,2046.981,2048.531,"Because, again, there was no intent to convey ideas."
1986.85-1973,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2048.531,2049.231,I understand that.
1986.85-1973,1,41240,sally_louise_dilgart,,2049.231,2064.424,"Secondly, I would submit that there is not a significant notice problem of a nature that you suggest, because under the standard that we advocate today, people can... authors and distributors can reasonably know the contours of that community definition."
1986.85-1973,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2072.112,2075.214,Of what the community thought was good art and what was bad art?
1986.85-1973,1,41240,sally_louise_dilgart,,2085.856,2094.378,"The problem that we would have is, under the alternative approach advocated by petitioners, they'd have no indication whatsoever, because we would not even know what the standard was."
1986.85-1973,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2135.872,2150.798,"May I ask you, following up on Justice Scalia's thought, supposing a publisher had a book that he wanted to sell in Illinois, and he's in New York, and he took it to the art critic or the literary critic of the New York Times, and that person told him, this has got a lot of value."
1986.85-1973,1,41240,sally_louise_dilgart,,2164.356,2165.741,"We do not agree, Your Honor."
1986.85-1973,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2175.497,2177.782,Relevant to the value as measured by the Illinois standard?
1986.85-1973,1,41240,sally_louise_dilgart,,2183.036,2186.138,It would be admissible as any other sort of expert testimony.
1986.85-1973,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2192.458,2200.045,"What if the New York Times critic said to the author, this is great stuff in New York and east of the Hudson, but I know they wouldn't like it in Illinois."
1986.85-1973,1,41240,sally_louise_dilgart,,2204.683,2217.491,"To the extent that a defendant would seek to introduce evidence pertaining to a community reaction outside the state standard employed, no, it would not be admissible in that context."
1986.85-1973,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2291.055,2298.609,What standard would the appellate court have to apply on appellate review of this third part of the Miller test?
1986.85-1973,1,41240,sally_louise_dilgart,,2306.549,2313.904,"--I must be candid and say that the Court has not spoken with utter clarity in the past, because this issue has never been before the Court."
1986.85-1973,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2350.41,2362.885,"Well, Ms. Dilgart, in Jenkins v. Georgia, we reviewed, was it, a patently offensive determination, and said there just wasn't enough evidence to support a patently offensive."
1986.85-1973,1,41240,sally_louise_dilgart,,2369.655,2383.399,"I read Jenkins a little bit differently, Your Honor, because Jenkins, as I understand it, looked to see whether or not the described types of hard-core sexual conduct were present within the movie, Carnal Knowledge."
1986.85-1973,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2383.399,2388.784,"Oh, the first part of the first prong of Miller?"
1986.85-1973,1,41240,sally_louise_dilgart,,2396.623,2399.425,"Under the second prong of patently offensive sexual conduct, yes."
1986.85-1973,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2645.335,2661.796,"Excuse me, General Dilgart, before you get to that, you asserted earlier that it doesn't matter here anyway, because even under the standard that the petitioner asserts, these magazines would have failed."
1986.85-1973,1,41240,sally_louise_dilgart,,2687.531,2694.684,"--It's my understanding that that line of cases... there's been conflicting opinions within the Court in the past on that topic, I know."
1986.85-1973,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2711.146,2711.696,Indicated what?
1986.85-1973,1,41240,sally_louise_dilgart,,2714.181,2720.585,That these standing rules would be relaxed because of the values permitted by the First Amendment.
1986.85-1973,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2720.585,2722.402,Would be relaxed?
1986.85-1973,1,41240,sally_louise_dilgart,,2722.402,2723.971,Uh-huh.
1986.85-1973,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2723.971,2726.739,"Well, that's exactly my point."
1986.85-1973,1,41240,sally_louise_dilgart,,2737.545,2741.047,"But as I understand it, the two analyses are conceptually distinct."
1986.85-1973,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2754.056,2759.174,"You say this is not overbreadth... okay, I'll have to think about that."
1986.85-1973,1,41240,sally_louise_dilgart,,2764.245,2766.28,"Absolutely, Your Honor."
1986.85-1973,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2766.28,2780.253,"Now, would you clarify for me, did the court, the trial court, give the defendants instruction number two, which asks that they apply statewide standards to all aspects?"
1986.85-1973,1,41240,sally_louise_dilgart,,2780.253,2783.622,"Yes, Your Honor, the defendants... two parts here."
1986.85-1973,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2789.895,2799.167,"Then how did... how did the petitioners preserve, in your view, the argument that some other standard should apply?"
1986.85-1973,1,41240,sally_louise_dilgart,,2799.167,2811.892,"--It would be my... petitioners... it's a more complicated situation, inasmuch as petitioners did not even tender instructions which would define a national or an objective standard."
1986.85-1973,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2819.83,2822.449,Should do what?
1986.85-1973,1,41240,sally_louise_dilgart,,2822.449,2837.007,That this Court is entitled to take into consideration the state of this record in deciding whether to affirm or reverse.
1986.85-1973,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2900.365,2908.035,"If I understand this argument, you're saying even if the statute is obviously unconstitutional on its face, that doesn't make any difference."
1986.85-1973,1,41240,sally_louise_dilgart,,2908.035,2910.637,"--Well, of course we would not agree that it's unconstitutional on its face."
1986.85-1973,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2910.637,2911.421,"No, of course you don't."
1986.85-1973,1,41240,sally_louise_dilgart,,2920.693,2925.645,"Well, we would also argue that the statute was not unconstitutionally applied to them."
1986.85-1973,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2925.645,2928.78,Even though the instruction was obviously unconstitutional?
1986.85-1973,1,41240,sally_louise_dilgart,,2928.78,2930.732,I would not agree that the instruction was unconstitutional.
1986.85-1973,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2930.732,2938.904,"I mean, even if it were obviously unconstitutional, you'd still say it wasn't, because there's no evidence of... in your view there's no evidence of redeeming social value."
1986.85-1973,1,41240,sally_louise_dilgart,,2938.904,2945.892,"Well, I would argue that even if the jurors were improperly instructed, the Court must affirm because there's no evidence that--"
1986.85-1973,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2945.892,2946.342,Right.
1986.85-1973,1,41240,sally_louise_dilgart,,2950.312,2955.014,--It was not unconstitutionally applied to them.
1986.85-1973,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3165.534,3170.671,"General Dilgart, go back a minute or so ago."
1986.85-1973,1,41240,sally_louise_dilgart,,3181.978,3183.011,"My point, Your Honor--"
1986.85-1973,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3183.011,3190.751,"I thought that's what this case was about, and I thought almost all of your preceding argument was directed at the validity of using community standards."
1986.85-1973,1,41240,sally_louise_dilgart,,3194.119,3210.229,"--Speaking with respect to the second issue raised by petitioners, on the unconstitutionality of the statute, our position is that no Illinois court, and neither the old nor the new Illinois statute, have ever required the application of community determinations for value."
1986.85-1973,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3234.328,3243.636,"They did affirm this conviction, where the trial judge had charged that community standards should be applied in determining the third part."
1986.85-1973,1,41240,sally_louise_dilgart,,3243.636,3244.669,Absolutely.
1986.85-1973,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3250.956,3257.276,"Oh, so you mean maybe they're going to allow community standards sometimes and not allow it other times?"
1986.85-1973,1,41240,sally_louise_dilgart,,3259.995,3269.767,"To the extent that we could read anything from a silent opinion, I could only submit to you that there is no directive in there to require this result in a future case."
1986.85-1973,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3278.975,3289.247,I understand the point you're making.
1986.85-1973,1,41240,sally_louise_dilgart,,3289.247,3300.638,"I think I'd like to make some concluding remarks, if there are no other particular areas which the Court wishes to investigate."
1986.85-1973,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3374.82,3377.055,"Thank you, Ms. Dilgart."
1986.85-1973,2,26057,glenn_a_stanko,,3379.673,3381.673,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1986.85-1973,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3457.404,3460.622,0 xxx.
1986.85-1973,2,26057,glenn_a_stanko,,3460.622,3465.593,"No, but there was language incorporated into the jury instructions from the statute."
1986.85-1973,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3465.593,3473.014,"If the jury instructions had not referred to community standards, you wouldn't be here?"
1986.85-1973,2,26057,glenn_a_stanko,,3473.014,3474.366,"Well, they would have been in error."
1986.85-1973,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3474.366,3477.818,"I mean, the statute was still there."
1986.85-1973,2,26057,glenn_a_stanko,,3477.818,3479.584,If the--
1986.85-1973,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3479.584,3480.77,You wouldn't be here.
1986.85-1973,2,26057,glenn_a_stanko,,3484.555,3494.244,"--If the jury instruction had not included community standards on the third element, you're right, we wouldn't be here."
1986.85-1973,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3501.516,3509.003,"Mr. Stanko, defendants' instruction was the one that was given, was it not?"
1986.85-1973,2,26057,glenn_a_stanko,,3509.003,3510.289,In one case.
1986.85-1973,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3531.369,3542.26,"Well, in Pope, as I understand it, defendant's instruction was requested and given, and it specified application of statewide community standards?"
1986.85-1973,2,26057,glenn_a_stanko,,3542.26,3542.61,Right.
1986.85-1973,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3659.385,3660.801,The case is submitted.
