1979.79-701,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,65.153,We'll hear arguments next in Roadway Express against Monk.
1979.79-701,0,36272,miles_curtiss_mckee,,68.176,70.961,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice and may it please it Court."
1979.79-701,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,300.92,315.283,One -- one reason advanced by the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit was the -- that 1927 should be construed strictly because they're regarded as penal in nature.
1979.79-701,0,36272,miles_curtiss_mckee,,317.919,321.603,"Your Honor, we could agree with it for the purposes of argument."
1979.79-701,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,321.603,337.159,"Do you think you would be consistent with the language in Newman v. Piggie Park Enterprises where -- where they say that -- the Court said that an attorney's fee award flows almost as a matter of right, if you prevail on the merits?"
1979.79-701,0,36272,miles_curtiss_mckee,,337.159,344.846,"Well, Your Honor there is authority saying that such statutes are penal as to one group of people and not penal as to others and their remedial as to others."
1979.79-701,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,344.846,350.358,"Well, what authority is that?"
1979.79-701,0,36272,miles_curtiss_mckee,,352.164,353.481,"No, it's not."
1979.79-701,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,359.583,363.185,"In 1927 only runs against a party, doesn't it?"
1979.79-701,0,36272,miles_curtiss_mckee,,363.185,363.487,"No, sir."
1979.79-701,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,367.596,367.84,Yes.
1979.79-701,0,36272,miles_curtiss_mckee,,376.413,381.271,"Well, Your Honor there is some legislative history that says that it's against the party."
1979.79-701,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,394.623,398.622,"Well, normally, they're taxed against the losing party."
1979.79-701,0,36272,miles_curtiss_mckee,,398.622,399.522,"Normally, that's correct."
1979.79-701,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,417.627,431.889,"Well, it was part of the theory that -- that the client should not be penalized for the conduct of the lawyer when the client is not in as good a position to evaluate the technique as the lawyer is."
1979.79-701,0,36272,miles_curtiss_mckee,,431.889,434.518,"Absolutely correct, Your Honor."
1979.79-701,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,435.048,444.676,"Well, have -- have the courts not done that with for example, frivolous appeals without any statutory authority under the inherent power of the Court to protect --"
1979.79-701,0,36272,miles_curtiss_mckee,,444.676,445.02,(Voice Overlap) --
1979.79-701,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,445.02,446.427,-- its operations?
1979.79-701,0,36272,miles_curtiss_mckee,,446.427,449.049,"Yes they have, Your Honor."
1979.79-701,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,449.049,453.483,I hope they have it because we've done it from bench on the Court of Appeals in the District of Columbia --
1979.79-701,0,36272,miles_curtiss_mckee,,453.483,453.653,Yes.
1979.79-701,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,453.653,460.093,-- Circuit where there was a frivolous appeal and we ordered the payment by the lawyer and not by the client.
1979.79-701,0,36272,miles_curtiss_mckee,,460.093,462.429,Yes.
1979.79-701,1,27943,herschel_e_richard_jr,,914.578,919.004,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court."
1979.79-701,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,985.56,997.447,"Mr. Richard, do you -- do you support the reasoning of the Fifth Circuit in saying that 1927 should be strictly construed because it's penal in nature?"
1979.79-701,1,27943,herschel_e_richard_jr,,997.447,998.586,"Yes, sir."
1979.79-701,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,999.267,1014.942,How -- how do you square that with the language in Newman versus Piggie Park that says where the -- a plaintiff bringing a Title VII case is on -- the attorney's fees should be awarded almost as a matter of course?
1979.79-701,1,27943,herschel_e_richard_jr,,1014.942,1034.462,"Well, in -- in the Piggie Park case, the awarding of attorney's fees was not to punish the defendant, but -- but it was the furtherance of the federal -- the -- the purpose of the statute to eliminate discrimination."
1979.79-701,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1039.343,1042.298,But it certainly punished the defendant in a sense.
1979.79-701,1,27943,herschel_e_richard_jr,,1042.298,1043.161,It did.
1979.79-701,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1062.086,1068.226,"Oh, in -- in 1927 that it is intended to punish people who violate its conduct in a sense."
1979.79-701,1,27943,herschel_e_richard_jr,,1068.226,1070.521,1927 is designed to punish lawyers.
1979.79-701,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1072.13,1076.332,"So -- so that -- the -- the two really stand pretty much on the same footing, don't they?"
1979.79-701,1,27943,herschel_e_richard_jr,,1076.332,1102.313,"Well, I don't think that the -- the idea of -- of the so -- the attorney's fees provisions if you get a look at the legislative history of -- of this -- of the provisions to allow attorney's fees was to punish the lawyers, but rather to encourage the -- the attorneys to take the source of cases that need to be handled."
1979.79-701,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1102.313,1105.273,"Well, but one -- one man's meat is another man's poison."
1979.79-701,1,27943,herschel_e_richard_jr,,1112.853,1117.067,"Well, I think -- I think that what you have to look at though was the language of the statute."
1979.79-701,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1173.759,1178.789,"Could've -- here, the plaintiff is sued and lost, is that right?"
1979.79-701,1,27943,herschel_e_richard_jr,,1178.789,1182.797,This -- in -- this case was dismissed without prejudice in this case.
1979.79-701,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1182.797,1188.371,And -- and then attorney's fees were assessed against the lawyer for the plaintiff --
1979.79-701,1,27943,herschel_e_richard_jr,,1188.371,1188.884,"Yes, sir."
1979.79-701,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1188.884,1190.296,-- in favor of the defendant.
1979.79-701,1,27943,herschel_e_richard_jr,,1190.296,1191.222,That's correct.
1979.79-701,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1191.222,1198.906,"Now, could the -- could an attorney's fee have been allowed to the defendant against the plaintiff?"
1979.79-701,1,27943,herschel_e_richard_jr,,1198.906,1200.111,I don't think so.
1979.79-701,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1206.87,1209.346,Well this is some of -- was this the kind of a case that you --
1979.79-701,1,27943,herschel_e_richard_jr,,1209.346,1210.745,"Yes, this is a Title VII."
1979.79-701,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1210.745,1213.892,"So -- so that -- so that the prevailing party, in proper circumstances --"
1979.79-701,1,27943,herschel_e_richard_jr,,1213.892,1214.15,Under Christians --
1979.79-701,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1214.15,1215.128,-- in the attorney's fees.
1979.79-701,1,27943,herschel_e_richard_jr,,1215.128,1216.185,Under Christiansburg.
1979.79-701,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1216.185,1223.694,So the -- as the defendant could've -- hadn't -- might have had an award of attorney's fees against the plaintiff as a party?
1979.79-701,1,27943,herschel_e_richard_jr,,1223.694,1224.379,That's right.
1979.79-701,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1228.965,1229.751,I understand.
1979.79-701,1,27943,herschel_e_richard_jr,,1229.751,1231.259,And -- and in this case --
1979.79-701,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1231.259,1246.578,"I understand they -- they -- but nevertheless, it was the kind -- in these very circumstances, the District Judge would not have abused his discretion, I suppose, if he had awarded attorney's fees in favor of the defendant against the plaintiff as a party."
1979.79-701,1,27943,herschel_e_richard_jr,,1246.578,1247.394,I don't think so.
1979.79-701,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1247.928,1248.761,What do you mean you don't --
1979.79-701,1,27943,herschel_e_richard_jr,,1248.761,1248.798,I don't --
1979.79-701,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1248.798,1249.352,-- you think that --
1979.79-701,1,27943,herschel_e_richard_jr,,1249.352,1258.986,"-- in this case, under these facts, there's no facts to award attorney's fees against the party based on the rationale of Christiansburg."
1979.79-701,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1258.986,1260.616,Why -- why not?
1979.79-701,1,27943,herschel_e_richard_jr,,1260.616,1265.094,The Christiansburg looks to the claim of the plaintiff whether it was --
1979.79-701,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1265.094,1265.723,Yes.
1979.79-701,1,27943,herschel_e_richard_jr,,1265.723,1266.766,-- unreasonable --
1979.79-701,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1266.766,1267.123,Right.
1979.79-701,1,27943,herschel_e_richard_jr,,1267.123,1270.876,"-- groundless, frivolous I believe, is the other word."
1979.79-701,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1282.506,1283.223,"Well, I see --"
1979.79-701,1,27943,herschel_e_richard_jr,,1283.223,1285.25,-- with regard to two of the three claimants.
1979.79-701,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1289.442,1289.854,I see.
1979.79-701,1,27943,herschel_e_richard_jr,,1289.854,1290.483,-- of the claim.
1979.79-701,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1297.216,1302.145,"But the award wasn't here -- wasn't based on bringing a frivolous case, but on -- on needless say --"
1979.79-701,1,27943,herschel_e_richard_jr,,1302.145,1304.048,The conduct of the lawyers.
1979.79-701,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1353.821,1356.597,"But that wasn't the reasoning of the Court the Appeals, was it?"
1979.79-701,1,27943,herschel_e_richard_jr,,1364.934,1379.421,"They said you can -- that the -- the issue was not fully -- not considered at all in the Court of Appeals like it has been briefed here in -- in this Court, Your Honor."
1979.79-701,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1443.123,1445.756,But what -- let me go back.
1979.79-701,1,27943,herschel_e_richard_jr,,1488.572,1489.981,The -- the problem with -- regardless --
1979.79-701,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1489.981,1491.132,"Then, that would -- would --"
1979.79-701,1,27943,herschel_e_richard_jr,,1491.132,1491.826,Excuse me.
1979.79-701,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1491.826,1494.282,-- would you still be making this your argument?
1979.79-701,1,27943,herschel_e_richard_jr,,1494.282,1502.282,"Yes, because Congress has stepped into the act, into the bridge as far as what 1927 says."
1979.79-701,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1518.02,1519.038,I don't understand.
1979.79-701,1,27943,herschel_e_richard_jr,,1527.481,1528.14,All right.
1979.79-701,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1528.14,1533.028,"And then the judge says, “Well, I think this is a proper case for 1927 --"
1979.79-701,1,27943,herschel_e_richard_jr,,1533.028,1533.209,All right.
1979.79-701,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1533.209,1538.852,-- so I'm going to make the plaintiff -- the plaintiff's lawyer pay the cost rather than the plaintiff.
1979.79-701,1,27943,herschel_e_richard_jr,,1540.563,1555.369,"Well, you've got to go back to 1927 and read 1927 as for what it says that the -- the lawyer multiplies the proceedings in any case as to increase cost unreasonably and vexatiously."
1979.79-701,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1556.963,1557.981,Right.
1979.79-701,1,27943,herschel_e_richard_jr,,1557.981,1558.2,And --
1979.79-701,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1558.2,1558.733,Right.
1979.79-701,1,27943,herschel_e_richard_jr,,1558.741,1564.137,"-- and just because the plaintiff lost, I don't think has made such standard."
1979.79-701,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1564.137,1574.755,"Well, let -- let's just -- let's suppose that -- that because of the lawyer's conduct, costs were increased."
1979.79-701,1,27943,herschel_e_richard_jr,,1574.755,1574.947,All right.
1979.79-701,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1574.947,1578.11,The defendant's costs were increased and he won.
1979.79-701,1,27943,herschel_e_richard_jr,,1596.155,1596.846,All right.
1979.79-701,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1596.846,1597.53,Isn't that --
1979.79-701,1,27943,herschel_e_richard_jr,,1597.53,1599.982,That's -- that's the purpose of 1927.
1979.79-701,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1599.982,1600.255,Yes.
1979.79-701,1,27943,herschel_e_richard_jr,,1614.116,1615.74,You can't -- you --
1979.79-701,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1615.74,1615.902,Because --
1979.79-701,1,27943,herschel_e_richard_jr,,1615.902,1616.099,You --
1979.79-701,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1616.099,1617.109,-- the grounds are different.
1979.79-701,1,27943,herschel_e_richard_jr,,1617.109,1617.974,That's right.
1979.79-701,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1618.878,1619.071,Well --
1979.79-701,1,27943,herschel_e_richard_jr,,1619.071,1619.624,-- and oranges.
1979.79-701,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1619.624,1630.397,"Well, but you have to say that with respect to all the other federal statutes that provide for the award of an -- an attorney's fees in addition to ordinary cost too, don't you?"
1979.79-701,1,27943,herschel_e_richard_jr,,1630.397,1631.979,"Yes, if --"
1979.79-701,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1631.979,1639.346,You can never have attorney's fees as a part of the award under this 1927 -- under your view.
1979.79-701,1,27943,herschel_e_richard_jr,,1639.346,1640.284,That's correct.
1979.79-701,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1662.707,1665.055,What may just you meant for frivolous appeal --
1979.79-701,1,27943,herschel_e_richard_jr,,1665.055,1665.244,40 --
1979.79-701,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1665.244,1667.235,-- as one example.
1979.79-701,1,27943,herschel_e_richard_jr,,1667.235,1672.944,"46 U.S. -- I mean the Rule 46, I believe with the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure."
1979.79-701,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1672.944,1680.213,Could absent any rule or statute to a good many courts have treated that as an inherent power close to --
1979.79-701,1,27943,herschel_e_richard_jr,,1680.213,1680.339,Thus --
1979.79-701,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1680.339,1681.734,"-- state and federal, have they not?"
1979.79-701,1,27943,herschel_e_richard_jr,,1681.734,1688.856,"-- certainly, the -- the courts have -- have awarded attorney's fees against parties as part of --"
1979.79-701,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1688.856,1692.903,I'm not talking about an attorney's fees against the lawyer as distinguished from the party.
1979.79-701,1,27943,herschel_e_richard_jr,,1692.903,1698.902,"Well, I -- there've been no -- none of the cases cited by Roadway have reached that result."
1979.79-701,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1715.348,1721.201,"Well, don't you -- don't you think it would be proper for a judge to award attorney to -- to the -- under 1927?"
1979.79-701,1,27943,herschel_e_richard_jr,,1735.639,1738.786,I think it's -- it's in the conduct of the litigation is what the 19 --
1979.79-701,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1738.786,1742.653,"Well, doesn't want to -- it says “Who so multiplies the proceedings in any case.”"
1979.79-701,1,27943,herschel_e_richard_jr,,1747.951,1750.506,That's assuming that -- that the claim had no merit to begin with.
1979.79-701,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1750.506,1751.959,"Exactly, exactly."
1979.79-701,1,27943,herschel_e_richard_jr,,1757.368,1764.96,"Under those facts which I don't think are applicable is here, I -- I think that 1927 would probably reach that -- that conduct."
1979.79-701,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1764.96,1770.768,"Mr. Richard, may I ask you a question about Section 1920 which describes taxable cost."
1979.79-701,1,27943,herschel_e_richard_jr,,1777.76,1777.768,Yes.
1979.79-701,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1777.768,1782.421,My question is does it pick up those items of taxable cost that have been added recently?
1979.79-701,1,27943,herschel_e_richard_jr,,1801.225,1803.029,"Well, I think -- I think so, Your Honor."
1979.79-701,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1803.727,1812.964,"Well, if you include subsequently added cost, why don't you include attorney's fees which are taxable as part of the cost in Title VII litigations?"
1979.79-701,1,27943,herschel_e_richard_jr,,1812.964,1816.753,"Well, because I think it -- that because of the -- of the relationship --"
1979.79-701,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1816.753,1819.187,"Because it's not if 1920, is that the reason?"
1979.79-701,1,27943,herschel_e_richard_jr,,1819.187,1819.543,Sir?
1979.79-701,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1819.543,1820.021,Because it -- they're not in --
1979.79-701,1,27943,herschel_e_richard_jr,,1820.021,1822.457,It is not in 1927 and when you look --
1979.79-701,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1822.457,1826.941,"In other words, you would read Section 1927 and saying those costs authorized by Section 1920 --"
1979.79-701,1,27943,herschel_e_richard_jr,,1826.941,1827.468,They're on the same chapter.
1979.79-701,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1827.468,1828.289,-- and nothing else?
1979.79-701,1,27943,herschel_e_richard_jr,,1828.289,1829.79,123 and whatever it is.
1979.79-701,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1830.176,1831.218,It has to be on the same chapter.
1979.79-701,1,27943,herschel_e_richard_jr,,1831.218,1838.029,"Well, you got -- you -- I think you have to read it with the -- looking at what Congress intended."
1979.79-701,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1878.372,1882.468,But they said under no event could attorney's fees be awarded.
1979.79-701,1,27943,herschel_e_richard_jr,,1882.468,1884.117,That's correct.
1979.79-701,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1896.747,1905.391,Mrs. Shapiro.
1979.79-701,2,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,1905.391,1908.682,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1979.79-701,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2032.816,2033.585,Ms. Shapiro --
1979.79-701,2,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,2033.585,2034.87,Yes.
1979.79-701,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2034.87,2040.478,"The award of attorney's fees on both sides is provided in Title VII cases, isn't it?"
1979.79-701,2,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,2040.478,2041.747,That's true but --
1979.79-701,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2041.747,2058.364,"So -- so that in -- in effect, the lawyer who undertakes to defend a civil -- a Title VII action is faced with the same sort of problem as the lawyer who takes on the plaintiff's case."
1979.79-701,2,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,2058.364,2074.083,"Well, the -- the lawyers' fees are recoverable to the prevailing party, but as reading Piggie Park and Christiansburg, the standards are different."
1979.79-701,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2102.163,2102.296,"Well, but who --"
1979.79-701,2,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,2102.296,2102.984,-- spelled out in Christiansburg --
1979.79-701,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2102.984,2115.009,"-- the Congress has given him a special incentive to a certain extent, because it does authorize the award of -- of attorney's fees as cost to the defendant and under the Christiansburg standard --"
1979.79-701,2,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,2115.009,2123.724,Only if the defendant is essentially blameless if the suit is without merit.
1979.79-701,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2138.585,2145.964,"Ms. Shapiro, we're dealing with exceptional cases to start with, because most lawyers don't misbehave and give rise to claims of this kind."
1979.79-701,2,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,2178.934,2204.461,"Well, I think the Court really faced that problem in Christiansburg, because in Christiansburg you made it fairly clear that you -- you were not saying that only the bad faith plaintiff was -- could -- could expect to have counsel's -- I mean, attorney's fees recovered against him."
1979.79-701,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2286.539,2290.568,"Well, it's not penal but per se fees are part of the cost."
1979.79-701,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2294.747,2297.437,Are the -- the -- is it the same?
1979.79-701,2,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,2297.437,2309.477,"Well, the -- the purpose of saying the fees are part of the cost in the substantive statutes is (a) to the -- this -- this private Attorney General principle to --"
1979.79-701,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2309.477,2323.262,"Well, you used -- you -- you used the language of fees as part of the -- the cost in the statute in -- in one statute as the -- entirely different meaning than in 1927."
1979.79-701,2,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,2323.262,2323.967,That's right.
1979.79-701,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2341.622,2345.543,"Well, Ms. Shapiro, what if -- what if a general statute were passed?"
1979.79-701,2,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,2365.83,2372.853,"Well, then you wouldn't have the singling out problem which is our basic -- that's the -- the problem with the -- the -- our fundamental policy problem."
1979.79-701,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2372.853,2377.779,"I don't know how that gets you, though to -- to excluding attorney's fees from cost."
1979.79-701,2,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,2377.779,2378.004,Well --
1979.79-701,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2378.004,2387.633,"Because in my example that I take it, you would say that, “Well, I guess -- I guess attorney's fees are part of -- are -- are part of the cost that can be charged against the lawyer."
1979.79-701,2,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,2387.633,2394.607,What -- what we're -- I -- if you can just have a statute that said attorney's fees here are -- are part of the costs --
1979.79-701,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2394.607,2395.871,And they're allowable to the prevailing party.
1979.79-701,2,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,2395.871,2412.898,"And -- and they're allowable to the prevailing party without amending 1927, then you would still have 1927 as part of -- I mean, assuming this statute didn't overrule the 1853 Act."
1979.79-701,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2413.745,2414.948,(Voice Overlap) 1920 --
1979.79-701,2,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,2414.948,2415.338,Well --
1979.79-701,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2415.338,2419.929,-- with Mr. Justice White's statute in the subsection 7 of 1920.
1979.79-701,2,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,2424.24,2427.573,We -- the -- there is -- there has been a proposal.
1979.79-701,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2429.841,2430.307,I Understand.
1979.79-701,2,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,2433.801,2434.292,Sure.
1979.79-701,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2436.858,2437.314,"Well, I mean if we --"
1979.79-701,2,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,2437.314,2437.481,And --
1979.79-701,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2437.481,2439.599,-- if we just amended 1920.
1979.79-701,2,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,2439.599,2440.655,I'd -- I think that would probably --
1979.79-701,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2440.655,2445.981,"What your -- what you're saying is, it only -- the word, cost, only applies if it's cost in all litigation."
1979.79-701,2,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,2450.844,2456.242,"That when you have this -- the singling out, you get real policy problems."
1979.79-701,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2456.242,2462.328,The problem that I -- I see with your argument is you seem to assume that the singling out was totally for the benefit of the plaintiffs.
1979.79-701,2,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,2470.116,2494.479,"No, the -- the argument really is that you're in -- in the substantive statutes, you're talking about costs -- shifting costs against the parties and that -- that however that line is drawn between the parties, it's drawn on the basis of the merits of the suit."
1979.79-701,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2499.834,2501.126,I just don't understand you.
1979.79-701,2,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,2515.624,2517.876,"Well, in this -- that's up -- and we agree."
1979.79-701,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2532.677,2540.449,"And if the consequences of misbehavior are that you have to pay the costs, I don't know why you don't pay whatever the costs are appropriate for that kind of litigation."
1979.79-701,2,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,2540.449,2544.19,Because the purpose of putting the particular cost in a particular statute --
1979.79-701,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2544.19,2545.538,Without plaintiffs.
1979.79-701,2,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,2545.538,2550.511,-- is for a different -- there's a different basis for that.
1979.79-701,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2553.715,2557.193,"Mr. McKee, do you have anything further?"
1979.79-701,3,36272,miles_curtiss_mckee,,2557.193,2564.688,"Mr. Chief Justice, you asked earlier about the matter of improvident appeals and -- and awards under inherent powers."
1979.79-701,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2705.222,2711.293,That is not -- it's not 1927 to divide the lawyer from his client?
1979.79-701,3,36272,miles_curtiss_mckee,,2711.293,2714.615,"It does, Your Honor, for the purpose of the discretion to the Court, yes."
1979.79-701,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2714.615,2715.198,Yes.
1979.79-701,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2715.198,2721.105,"Well, you could have very serious misconduct on the part of a lawyer in a very meritorious case, couldn't you?"
1979.79-701,3,36272,miles_curtiss_mckee,,2721.105,2722.319,"You could, sir."
1979.79-701,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2722.634,2727.058,And -- and very exemplary conduct on the part of the lawyer in a -- in a frivolous case.
1979.79-701,3,36272,miles_curtiss_mckee,,2727.058,2728.416,That's correct.
1979.79-701,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2728.416,2729.582,So aren't they divided?
1979.79-701,3,36272,miles_curtiss_mckee,,2731.694,2739.598,"Well, they are, Your Honor, but you can't divide them entirely for all of these purposes and ignore the Lincoln Wabash decision at all -- all together."
1979.79-701,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2768.77,2770.689,"Mr. McKee, I -- let me interrupted you."
1979.79-701,3,36272,miles_curtiss_mckee,,2777.769,2779.262,Self.
1979.79-701,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2787.734,2787.839,(Voice Overlap) --
1979.79-701,3,36272,miles_curtiss_mckee,,2787.839,2789.787,-- it was appealed to the Fifth Circuit.
1979.79-701,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2798.76,2799.666,I see.
1979.79-701,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2800.765,2813.219,"Under 1927, could the strictures of 1927 be applied against the lawyer for the prevailing party?"
1979.79-701,3,36272,miles_curtiss_mckee,,2838.541,2840.097,"There's no question, Your Honor."
1979.79-701,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2840.097,2840.303,No question --
1979.79-701,3,36272,miles_curtiss_mckee,,2840.303,2840.79,Mr. Chief Justice --
1979.79-701,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2840.79,2841.423,-- which way --
1979.79-701,3,36272,miles_curtiss_mckee,,2841.423,2844.921,-- that -- that this thing can be applied to everyone who's involved in the litigation.
1979.79-701,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2844.921,2845.385,Yes.
1979.79-701,3,36272,miles_curtiss_mckee,,2846.953,2848.104,Not at all.
1979.79-701,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2848.104,2849.064,-- the losing party.
1979.79-701,3,36272,miles_curtiss_mckee,,2849.064,2849.492,Not at all.
1979.79-701,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2849.492,2849.721,I see.
1979.79-701,3,36272,miles_curtiss_mckee,,2849.721,2854.619,"Now, these -- these offenses which seemed to be -- they come through the argument of the Government."
