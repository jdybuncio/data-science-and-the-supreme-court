1967.26,1,15674,albert_r_connelly,,4220.684,4221.391,Yes sir?
1967.26,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4221.391,4231.355,I suppose that in the argument that the existence of those companies hence -- may have had some market effect.
1967.26,1,15674,albert_r_connelly,,4254.818,4255.706,I think as Mr. DeLone will --
1967.26,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4255.706,4273.419,"And there's a difference between a potential -- a -- between the market effect, these companies have had a sort of (Inaudible), let's say of having been that -- the number of their operations."
1967.26,1,15674,albert_r_connelly,,4295.7,4301.755,"It could well be sir, In terms of certain industry, but not in this industry because the testimony is quite clear."

1967.26,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5435.559,5436.438,I beg your pardon.
1967.26,2,26885,h_francis_delone,,5436.438,5443.196,Even though Mr. Dirksen regarded Allied as the foremost potential competitor.

1967.26,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5457.564,5465.92,-- on all probability with respect to the antitrust impact --
1967.26,2,26885,h_francis_delone,,5465.92,5466.061,Well --
1967.26,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5466.061,5467.543,-- antitrust consequences?
1967.26,2,26885,h_francis_delone,,5467.543,5477.3,"It -- were not for the pulp and paper companies, you would clearly then have an elimination of all potential competition and at least the potential competition --"
1967.26,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5477.3,5477.976,But what you're really (Voice Overlap) --
1967.26,2,26885,h_francis_delone,,5477.976,5479.401,-- which I'm dealing with and --
1967.26,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5479.401,5505.11,"Well, that -- put your -- is that your position, somewhat diluted and I think because if I follow you then, what you're saying is that Penn -- as that Penn and Olin put together, did not constitute a sufficiently large segment of the group of potential competitors to have a necessary antitrust impact."
1967.26,2,26885,h_francis_delone,,5505.11,5506.87,"Well, not precisely sir."

1967.26,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5562.443,5583.623,"The other aspect of it from your point of view now, I should think is that when you have -- when you have this -- you have the facts upon which we were working, the problem upon which we were working assumes that there is another company that is in this business that wasn't in the business before."
1967.26,2,26885,h_francis_delone,,5583.623,5584.225,Yes.
1967.26,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5584.225,5598.779,And that presumably is providing the competition of an actual competitor so that you have not only a process of subtraction but you also have a process of addition if there are -- that a balance I suppose.
1967.26,2,26885,h_francis_delone,,5598.779,5599.461,That's correct.
