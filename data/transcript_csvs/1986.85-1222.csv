1986.85-1222,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,17.01,"We will hear arguments next in two consolidated cases, No. 85-1222, ICC against Texas, et al., and No. 85-1267, Missour-Kansas-Texas Railraod Company against Texas."
1986.85-1222,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,60.289,62.673,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1986.85-1222,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,137.455,145.91,"Mr. Taranto, part of the equipment is trailer rigs, truck-trailer rigs owned by the railroad?"
1986.85-1222,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,145.91,146.576,That's right.
1986.85-1222,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,146.576,152.814,So that it travels over the road in tractor-trailer rigs owned by the railroad; is that it?
1986.85-1222,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,152.814,153.33,That's right.
1986.85-1222,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,160.318,165.455,"For you to prevail, we have to decide that's a form of rail service?"
1986.85-1222,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,165.455,172.561,You have to decide that that is transportation provided by a rail carrier within the meaning of the Staggers Act.
1986.85-1222,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,176.03,177.963,"Well, that... that fact is important to your--"
1986.85-1222,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,179.215,180.998,"--I'm sorry, Justice?"
1986.85-1222,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,180.998,185.285,"They could just as easily have said, by rail, instead of saying, by a rail carrier."
1986.85-1222,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,187.237,195.974,"Well, it is true that the statute generally uses the term, transportation provided by a rail carrier in various places."
1986.85-1222,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,331.18,334.834,"You say, is that explicit in the statute, Mr. Taranto?"
1986.85-1222,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,334.834,351.776,"Yes, in the very first words of Section 10101, the general national transportation policy, says that the following shall govern except when policy has an impact on rail carriers, in which case the specific rail carrier policy will govern."
1986.85-1222,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,470.103,473.574,"Mr. Taranto, excuse me for interrupting, because you answered my question earlier."
1986.85-1222,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,479.728,487.882,--I don't believe that the petition includes the general national transportation policy.
1986.85-1222,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,487.882,491.869,Something that critical was not included in the relevant statutes?
1986.85-1222,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,491.869,496.904,It is included in the statutes; not in the appendix here.
1986.85-1222,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,631.127,633.561,"xxx distinguished it, didn't they?"
1986.85-1222,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,633.561,639.196,--The ICC said that it's 1981 exemption--
1986.85-1222,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,639.196,641.131,"No, I mean the second... Court of Appeals."
1986.85-1222,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,641.131,659.01,"--Yes, when that case went to the Fifth Circuit, the Fifth Circuit said that the transportation involved in the earlier case was interstate transportation; that the shipments there crossed State lines during the entire... at some point during the single TOFC service."
1986.85-1222,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,708.693,715.029,I don't see that the Fifth Circuit mentioned the provision which you referred me to earlier.
1986.85-1222,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,720.183,731.641,I'm not aware that the government made any argument based on the express priority given to the rail carrier policy.
1986.85-1222,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,815.378,823.948,Am I correct that the argument on which the Fifth Circuit based its decision had not been presented to the ICC?
1986.85-1222,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,831.388,839.708,The Fifth Circuit rested its decision on the view that this was transportation provided by a motor carrier.
1986.85-1222,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,839.708,840.125,Right.
1986.85-1222,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,840.41,845.546,The ICC decision in this case itself does not reflect that... that argument.
1986.85-1222,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,853.551,856.419,We don't really know the views of the ICC on this point?
1986.85-1222,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,856.419,869.763,"Well, we do know the view of the ICC that both the motor and truck portion is-properly brought within the rail carrier provisions of the Interstate Commerce Act."
1986.85-1222,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,883.487,896.33,"Mr. Taranto, Texas was decertified after some 40 items of disagreement with the Texas Commission, is that right?"
1986.85-1222,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,896.33,896.813,"Yes, that's right."
1986.85-1222,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,896.813,903.334,Has the ICC had the same trouble with other State commissions in finding them recalcitrant?
1986.85-1222,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,903.334,909.138,"As far as I'm aware, Texas today remains the only State to have been denied certification."
1986.85-1222,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,926.016,931.754,"Of course, it's a large State, and there's probably a lot of intrastate movement in Texas that might not be the case in other States."
1986.85-1222,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,931.754,939.74,"Certainly, Texas is larger than most States, but other States have an enormous amount of intrastate movement."
1986.85-1222,1,36543,michael_e_roper,,1043.723,1057.616,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1986.85-1222,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1214.936,1216.386,I don't really understand that.
1986.85-1222,1,36543,michael_e_roper,,1226.577,1229.343,"Well, you would think so--"
1986.85-1222,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1229.343,1230.945,You're going to make money and they're not going to lose any.
1986.85-1222,1,36543,michael_e_roper,,1233.647,1243.253,"--We will be able... if the motor portion is deregulated as the rail portion, we will be able to provide additional competition there is no question about that."
1986.85-1222,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1243.253,1245.303,And the Texas truckers must lose money.
1986.85-1222,1,36543,michael_e_roper,,1255.06,1257.845,"Well, given the history of the Railroad Commission, I could certainly understand why they would put that trust there."
1986.85-1222,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1352.371,1355.858,"Yes, but isn't the anomaly present if you were just a motor carrier and you didn't have a rail involved?"
1986.85-1222,1,36543,michael_e_roper,,1362.428,1366.214,"--That is true, but in this case, Congress has form a different form of regulation."
1986.85-1222,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1366.214,1366.564,I understand.
1986.85-1222,1,36543,michael_e_roper,,1368.916,1379.104,"Well, I think it's illustrative of the problem you have with the dual regulatory system, that Congress has concluded was too much of a burden on the rail carrier industry."
1986.85-1222,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1483.541,1490.695,"It did... the Act does exempt intrastate transportation by motor, doesn't it?"
1986.85-1222,1,36543,michael_e_roper,,1490.695,1492.23,By motor?
1986.85-1222,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1492.23,1492.597,Yes.
1986.85-1222,1,36543,michael_e_roper,,1494.313,1495.182,No--
1986.85-1222,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1495.182,1498.716,What is the phrase that the Fifth Circuit relied upon?
1986.85-1222,1,36543,michael_e_roper,,1498.716,1511.358,"--Well, the Fifth Circuit said that the ICC and Congress had to be talking only about interstate transportation when they were talking about motor and rail portions."
1986.85-1222,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1511.358,1518.847,"Well, isn't there language in the act that allows States to regulate intrastate motor transportation?"
1986.85-1222,1,36543,michael_e_roper,,1518.847,1519.947,"Yes, there is."
1986.85-1222,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1522.999,1525.165,"Well, that's where the argument is really."
1986.85-1222,1,36543,michael_e_roper,,1534.538,1542.877,"Not to the degree, although the 1980 Motor Carrier Act, I think, did loosen up the regulatory control significantly for interstate motor carriers."
1986.85-1222,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1607.236,1609.855,"Thank you, Mr. Roper."
1986.85-1222,2,24508,fernando_rodriguez,,1611.64,1624.365,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1986.85-1222,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1708.684,1732.05,"May I just ask at that point, suppose that instead of granting an exemption, the ICC had felt there was a danger that the railroad would have a monopoly and would gouge the shippers, and wanted to regulate rather than exempt the entire TOFC or whatever you call it combined type of service, including the intrastate motor carriage portion."
1986.85-1222,2,24508,fernando_rodriguez,,1734.436,1735.788,Your Honor--
1986.85-1222,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1735.788,1736.821,What is your position on that?
1986.85-1222,2,24508,fernando_rodriguez,,1736.821,1739.406,"--Justice Stevens, we're still talking about a purely intrastate movement?"
1986.85-1222,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1739.406,1739.706,Correct.
1986.85-1222,2,24508,fernando_rodriguez,,1740.39,1741.858,"Yes, Your Honor."
1986.85-1222,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1741.858,1742.625,--transportation at issue.
1986.85-1222,2,24508,fernando_rodriguez,,1750.297,1760.403,"Yes, Your Honor, we contend that under 10521b, which is the express reservation of power to the States, the ICC... the ICC simply has no jurisdiction--"
1986.85-1222,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1760.403,1761.803,You'd say they didn't have jurisdiction there either?
1986.85-1222,2,24508,fernando_rodriguez,,1761.803,1762.771,"--Yes, Your Honor, that's correct."
1986.85-1222,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1800.646,1812.288,"Textually, your argument comes down to the argument that this transportation is not being... is being provided by a motor carrier rather than by a railroad; isn't that what it all boils down to?"
1986.85-1222,2,24508,fernando_rodriguez,,1812.288,1814.571,"That's what it all boils down to, Justice Scalia."
1986.85-1222,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1814.571,1817.256,"Well, it seems to me it's being provided by a railroad."
1986.85-1222,2,24508,fernando_rodriguez,,1817.256,1833.367,"Well, Your Honor, is a truck not a struck simply because it has Burlington Norther or MKT on the side, when that truck provides the same type of service which John Doe Freight Lines provides?"
1986.85-1222,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1855.448,1865.154,Then how could you get ICC jurisdiction over the motor carrier portion of interstate transportation.
1986.85-1222,2,24508,fernando_rodriguez,,1867.689,1868.022,--No.
1986.85-1222,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1874.425,1879.21,But supposing only the rail portion is interstate and the motor portion is intrastate.
1986.85-1222,2,24508,fernando_rodriguez,,1880.579,1882.212,"--Well, Your Honor, I think that's an interstate movement."
1986.85-1222,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1917.252,1936.749,"But Mr. Rodriguez, if the motor portion of interstate TOFC movements can be exempted, why doesn't that necessarily mean that the motor portion of intrastate movement is also transportation by a rail carrier?"
1986.85-1222,2,24508,fernando_rodriguez,,1936.749,1944.337,"Justice O'Connor, that's... you've essentially grasped what this case is all about."
1986.85-1222,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2044.184,2052.172,"Well, if there's some question about it, don't we owe some deference to the ICC as the Agency administering the Staggers Act?"
1986.85-1222,2,24508,fernando_rodriguez,,2052.172,2057.159,"Your Honor, I would agree that some deference is due the ICC."
1986.85-1222,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2118.316,2120.934,"Mr. Rodriguez, can I interrupt you just a second?"
1986.85-1222,2,24508,fernando_rodriguez,,2120.934,2121.101,"--Yes, sir."
1986.85-1222,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2121.101,2125.553,"Are you making a Constitutional argument in this case, or is it just a question of statutory construction?"
1986.85-1222,2,24508,fernando_rodriguez,,2125.553,2127.736,"Well, it's a question of statutory construction, Your Honor."
1986.85-1222,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2133.957,2143.681,"But you would not contest the power... if everything were spelled out just as the government, your opponent, says it is, you wouldn't contest the power of Congress to deregulate this particular kind of transportation?"
1986.85-1222,2,24508,fernando_rodriguez,,2143.681,2144.948,"Absolutely not, Justice Stevens."
1986.85-1222,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2156.405,2159.857,Doesn't the Staggers Act do just about that?
1986.85-1222,2,24508,fernando_rodriguez,,2159.857,2162.142,"Just about that, Your Honor."
1986.85-1222,3,40639,richard_g_taranto,,3190.169,3191.354,Nothing further.
1986.85-1222,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3191.354,3192.32,Very well.
