1982.82-52,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,9.496,We will hear arguments next in Arizona Governing Committee for Tax Deferred Annuity and Deferred Compensation Plans against Nathalie Norris.
1982.82-52,0,30151,john_l_endicott,,74.704,86.028,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this case presents some of the questions that we believe were left unresolved by this Court's decision in the Manhart case."
1982.82-52,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,192.719,203.262,"Mr. Endicott, there is some indication that Arizona at least solicited bids on the basis of the sex-based tables--"
1982.82-52,0,30151,john_l_endicott,,203.262,204.808,"--Yes, Justice--"
1982.82-52,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,204.808,210.712,--that it assumed that is what it wanted and went out to get what in fact it got.
1982.82-52,0,30151,john_l_endicott,,210.712,225.784,"--Justice O'Connor, it solicited bids, and in the solicitation it asked for quotes on males and females, but there was nothing to prevent anybody from giving the same quote if there had been a unisex table available and if the bidder had chosen to do it."
1982.82-52,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,225.784,228.189,"And in any event, Arizona didn't ask for it."
1982.82-52,0,30151,john_l_endicott,,228.189,235.249,"No, Your Honor, but as Your Honor may have observed from the various amici briefs filed, nobody was offering."
1982.82-52,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,241.45,242.683,"Yes, probably so."
1982.82-52,0,30151,john_l_endicott,,244.089,248.993,"The burden of proof on what... on precisely what, Justice Blackmun?"
1982.82-52,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,248.993,254.351,On whether unisex tables are available or were available.
1982.82-52,0,30151,john_l_endicott,,254.351,291.883,"It is our position that the burden of proof is upon the respondent, that it would have been upon the plaintiffs in the lawsuit to prove, because if the contention is that Arizona discriminated by not seeking the use of unisex annuity tables, the question would be Arizona discriminated because it didn't ask for or take unisex annuity tables, I think, just as in the other Title 7 cases where an employee who contends he or she was discriminated against by not being given a job, you must show that the job was available."
1982.82-52,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,299.598,302.362,I take it your opposition disagrees with that.
1982.82-52,0,30151,john_l_endicott,,302.362,303.065,I believe so.
1982.82-52,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,462.485,464.735,But the problem there is the tax result.
1982.82-52,0,30151,john_l_endicott,,464.735,470.467,"There is a tax problem, Justice Blackmun, no matter how you take your money out."
1982.82-52,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,482.524,494.41,"I suppose your position is that if you do not prevail in this lawsuit, that in effect the plaintiffs have driven out of the picture the third option."
1982.82-52,0,30151,john_l_endicott,,494.41,495.581,"Yes, Your Honor."
1982.82-52,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,504.718,506.951,"Sometimes we overlitigate, don't we?"
1982.82-52,0,30151,john_l_endicott,,506.951,509.029,"I think so, Your Honor."
1982.82-52,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,548.856,550.7,"We will resume there at 1:00 o'clock, counsel."
1982.82-52,0,30151,john_l_endicott,,570.098,590.09,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, at the luncheon recess I was discussing the options which are available under the Arizona deferred compensation plan, and I had mentioned the fact that the employees can select the lump sum payment, a fixed term annuity, and the third option which is available is the life annuity."
1982.82-52,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,741.966,751.307,"Mr. Endicott, would your position be the same if the insurance companies used tables based on race rather than sex?"
1982.82-52,0,30151,john_l_endicott,,751.307,758.944,"I have to answer your question by going a little further, Justice Blackmun."
1982.82-52,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,783.152,790.119,"Well, there are diseases that are suffered more by persons of one race than another."
1982.82-52,0,30151,john_l_endicott,,811.61,817.794,"In a health insurance plan, a medical benefits plan, that could come up."
1982.82-52,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,830.993,844.19,"Well, if you go back about two decades, you will find a whole slew of actuarial tables based on race, promoted by two of the biggest insurance companies in this country."
1982.82-52,0,30151,john_l_endicott,,844.19,849.111,"--But I think in recent times, Justice Marshall, that those statistics are changing for the better."
1982.82-52,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,849.111,853.093,I thought you said there weren't any.
1982.82-52,0,30151,john_l_endicott,,853.952,856.732,"I don't know that anybody keeps track of it any more, Justice Marshall."
1982.82-52,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,868.727,873.725,"Would it be allowable under Title 7, though, I think, is the question."
1982.82-52,0,30151,john_l_endicott,,873.725,879.161,"I think the answer to that, Justice O'Connor, is who was making the distinction."
1982.82-52,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,883.3,885.799,"If it were an insurance company, as we have here."
1982.82-52,0,30151,john_l_endicott,,885.799,887.455,--And that was what was--
1982.82-52,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,887.455,888.252,On the basis of race.
1982.82-52,0,30151,john_l_endicott,,888.252,891.452,--And that was what was available and offered on the open market?
1982.82-52,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,913.131,915.614,May I ask you another question or two while you are interrupted?
1982.82-52,0,30151,john_l_endicott,,926.549,927.61,"Yes, Your Honor."
1982.82-52,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,927.61,933.811,Have any other women in the plaintiff class retired and selected that annuity?
1982.82-52,0,30151,john_l_endicott,,933.811,935.452,They can't select the life annuity because--
1982.82-52,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,935.452,939.433,"It is now terminated, and so we are dealing with four women."
1982.82-52,0,30151,john_l_endicott,,939.433,943.947,--And the future male and female who would like to retire and get a life annuity.
1982.82-52,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,943.947,946.446,If the plan were reinstituted.
1982.82-52,0,30151,john_l_endicott,,946.446,946.884,"Yes, Your Honor."
1982.82-52,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,946.884,962.596,"If the Court were to affirm the court below, and you had to discuss prospective remedies, what would your position be on the remedy question?"
1982.82-52,0,30151,john_l_endicott,,962.596,997.129,"I am very troubled by the retroactive aspect of the relief that was ordered in this case, and by other aspects, such as ordering the state to pay money when the state plan says that this is an employee plan only, but the retroactive aspect is troublesome because plans not so much like Arizona, where no funds are put up by the employer, but plans that have been funded such as are described in the Florida amicus brief in this case, they have funded a plan on certain actuarial assumptions."
1982.82-52,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1054.027,1068.318,"Putting aside the retroactive relief for the moment, do you know if unisex insurance is available?"
1982.82-52,0,30151,john_l_endicott,,1074.222,1075.003,"Could Arizona, Your Honor?"
1982.82-52,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1075.003,1079.064,Are there such annuities available on the market?
1982.82-52,0,30151,john_l_endicott,,1079.064,1092.98,"There are unisex annuities being offered presently, as I understand some of the statements made in the amicus brief, and as I understand Chinnerly, but, Your Honor, you have to define what unisex means."
1982.82-52,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1136.291,1136.556,Yes.
1982.82-52,0,30151,john_l_endicott,,1136.556,1141.069,"Under the Arizona plan, Your Honor, it could not be done, because it is a voluntary plan."
1982.82-52,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1160.156,1176.229,"Well, assume that the insurance companies had such an annuity available, and the employer didn't buy that one, he bought the one that's in Option 3."
1982.82-52,0,30151,john_l_endicott,,1179.117,1186.801,If the unisex annuity that was offered was better than the sex segregated rate--
1982.82-52,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1186.801,1188.269,"Well, but that, of course--"
1982.82-52,0,30151,john_l_endicott,,1188.269,1191.347,"--No, if it offered to pay the woman more money per month than the sex-based table."
1982.82-52,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1262.645,1271.033,"--There is no life insurance as such in this case, separate and apart from the program?"
1982.82-52,0,30151,john_l_endicott,,1271.033,1273.797,Life insurance?
1982.82-52,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1273.797,1274.063,Yes.
1982.82-52,0,30151,john_l_endicott,,1274.063,1278.483,"My recollection is, one of the choices under the plan is life insurance."
1982.82-52,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1278.483,1286.901,"Now, do the life insurance companies charge less premiums for insuring women of the same age as men?"
1982.82-52,0,30151,john_l_endicott,,1286.901,1287.729,They always do.
1982.82-52,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1288.261,1293.665,"Now, the reason for that is that is a corollary of the annuity proposition, isn't it?"
1982.82-52,0,30151,john_l_endicott,,1293.665,1295.056,It's the other side of the coin.
1982.82-52,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1295.056,1300.99,"It is the women who are going to live longer and pay premiums longer, on an average."
1982.82-52,0,30151,john_l_endicott,,1300.99,1301.91,You need to collect less per year or per month.
1982.82-52,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1329.04,1339.224,"Now, do the mortality tables that are used by the insurers make any division except as between men and women?"
1982.82-52,0,30151,john_l_endicott,,1340.145,1341.505,"Age, Your Honor."
1982.82-52,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1341.505,1343.706,"Well, men and women--"
1982.82-52,0,30151,john_l_endicott,,1343.706,1345.191,And age.
1982.82-52,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1345.191,1345.783,"--Age, obviously."
1982.82-52,0,30151,john_l_endicott,,1345.783,1346.345,Yes.
1982.82-52,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1346.345,1347.345,On a mortality--
1982.82-52,0,30151,john_l_endicott,,1347.345,1348.048,But those are the two--
1982.82-52,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1348.048,1353.437,--They don't include whether they are foreign-born or any other factors?
1982.82-52,0,30151,john_l_endicott,,1353.437,1358.435,"--No, Your Honor, not generally, and not basically, they don't."
1982.82-52,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1384.923,1390.733,"The insurance companies can take care of that by not insuring heavy drinkers and heavy smokers, can they not?"
1982.82-52,0,30151,john_l_endicott,,1390.733,1391.843,If they can identify them.
1982.82-52,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1392.921,1394.217,"Well, and they try to identify them, don't they?"
1982.82-52,0,30151,john_l_endicott,,1394.217,1394.67,Yes.
1982.82-52,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1394.67,1396.107,By their examinations.
1982.82-52,0,30151,john_l_endicott,,1396.107,1398.638,"And as Your Honor probably knows, they rate people."
1982.82-52,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1401.965,1406.15,"But in the group policy context, all this is less significant."
1982.82-52,0,30151,john_l_endicott,,1406.15,1418.458,"I believe in the group policy context, to the extent I am aware of it, Your Honor, it makes no difference, and the whole purpose of group is to underwrite a large group of people cheaply, usually without medical examinations, usually without much medical history."
1982.82-52,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1433.498,1437.388,"Of course, in this plan there is no medical examination at all, is there?"
1982.82-52,0,30151,john_l_endicott,,1437.388,1438.435,Not that I am aware of.
1982.82-52,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1438.435,1442.416,"Of course, there really wouldn't be, because poor health is a benefit to the insurance company."
1982.82-52,0,30151,john_l_endicott,,1442.416,1453.132,"Justice Stevens, you know, the funny thing is that in annuities, you get a self-selection working whereby all your poor life risks don't opt for a life annuity."
1982.82-52,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1460.364,1461.614,Right.
1982.82-52,0,30151,john_l_endicott,,1461.614,1462.535,So you get a self--
1982.82-52,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1462.535,1467.425,"Or the... or the specific term annuity, if I may call it that."
1982.82-52,0,30151,john_l_endicott,,1475.514,1487.447,"--Yes, but you can pick a ten-year certain, or a fifteen-year... if you want to take the risk of estimating how long you are going to live, you pick a fixed term policy and do it that way."
1982.82-52,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1487.447,1492.21,"Certainly if someone at retirement knows he has terminal cancer, he isn't going to take a life annuity."
1982.82-52,0,30151,john_l_endicott,,1492.21,1494.928,I think that is a reasonable assumption.
1982.82-52,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1494.928,1503.893,"Of course, I suppose in selecting, doing their calculation, the insurance company could take into account the fact that there is this self-selection element in the group."
1982.82-52,0,30151,john_l_endicott,,1510.531,1512.577,Identifiably.
1982.82-52,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1514.482,1515.123,Of course.
1982.82-52,0,30151,john_l_endicott,,1515.123,1517.575,And that is what makes your statistics.
1982.82-52,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1536.395,1543.486,Does the record tell us anything about whether the projections for different kinds of industries or professions are somewhat different?
1982.82-52,0,30151,john_l_endicott,,1550.952,1554.169,I am not aware of anything in this record that would reflect on that.
1982.82-52,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1559.418,1560.042,"Right, a pretty wide group."
1982.82-52,0,30151,john_l_endicott,,1560.042,1560.777,--of occupations.
1982.82-52,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1560.777,1565.571,"How long have these statistics been kept, Mr. Endicott?"
1982.82-52,0,30151,john_l_endicott,,1569.148,1573.803,Justice Marshall suggested to me earlier that it went back 100 or more years.
1982.82-52,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1578.613,1580.799,"It is more than 100 years since they began it, isn't it?"
1982.82-52,0,30151,john_l_endicott,,1580.799,1586.313,"Oh, I would believe that it goes back probably into the 1600's or 1700's, but the tables keep being changed."
1982.82-52,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1595.201,1601.494,"Mr. Endicott, are there many other states that have systems comparable to Arizona?"
1982.82-52,0,30151,john_l_endicott,,1601.494,1605.29,"Deferred compensation plans, Your Honor."
1982.82-52,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1605.29,1605.712,Yes.
1982.82-52,0,30151,john_l_endicott,,1605.712,1606.743,I believe there are a number.
1982.82-52,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1649.474,1652.474,But does it necessarily follow that that has to be a permanent solution?
1982.82-52,0,30151,john_l_endicott,,1659.112,1684.914,"Under our... under the Arizona plan, where people have a choice of options, Justice Stevens, and where they don't need to make a decision until they're 65 and retire, the odds are, as I said earlier, that I think you would end up with a female table being used to create the unisex rate because the insurer would have to assume the worst possible case, and that is that he is going to have 100 percent female life annuitants, and he is going to use the female rate."
1982.82-52,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1708.045,1708.794,Very well.
1982.82-52,1,16023,amy_jo_gittler,,1714.23,1734.112,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, in City of Los Angeles Department of Water and Power versus Manhart, this Court held that an employer's use of gender-based actuarial tables in computing payments into a pension plan was unlawful under Title 7."
1982.82-52,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1805.678,1808.426,Let me ask you about the employer withholding money.
1982.82-52,1,16023,amy_jo_gittler,,1809.909,1817.485,"it is my understanding, Justice Blackmun, that it does, but it is the employer that withholds the money from the paychecks."
1982.82-52,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1817.485,1828.043,"But the employer, as I think your statement inferred, is not sitting there with the money in his hot little hand and making money off it."
1982.82-52,1,16023,amy_jo_gittler,,1828.043,1834.915,"Your Honor, it is the state which does hold title to the moneys until they are dispersed to the employee."
1982.82-52,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1849.066,1856.203,"Well, Ms. Gittler, in your answer to Justice Blackmun's question, I would infer that the employer is kind of a self-insurer."
1982.82-52,1,16023,amy_jo_gittler,,1861.639,1871.604,"The physical possession of the money, Your Honor, may well transfer to the insurance companies, but the title remains with the state of Arizona until it is dispersed to the--"
1982.82-52,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1871.604,1878.272,I wasn't aware that one ordinarily separated the concept of the title to money and the physical possession of money.
1982.82-52,1,16023,amy_jo_gittler,,1882.848,1891.47,"--Well, I think, Your Honor, the significance is with respect to the employer's involvement in this plan, and that the legal title remains with the employer."
1982.82-52,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1891.47,1897.812,"The legal title to the money, which is... the possession of which passes to the insurance company?"
1982.82-52,1,16023,amy_jo_gittler,,1897.812,1900.154,"Again, Your Honor, that's my understanding."
1982.82-52,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1900.592,1907.464,That seems like a strange basis to hang your argument on.
1982.82-52,1,16023,amy_jo_gittler,,1926.049,1932.735,"Certainly, Justice O'Connor, that is what the employer would like us to believe today, but the employer's involvement is far more extensive than that."
1982.82-52,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1949.54,1952.18,"Yes, but that has nothing to do with title to the money."
1982.82-52,1,16023,amy_jo_gittler,,1955.632,1965.159,"Justice O'Connor, it is, but the point is, it is one of the many indicia of the control that the employer exercises in this plan."
1982.82-52,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1965.159,1975.717,"Who has the burden of proof, as Justice Blackmun asked earlier, that unisex tables were in fact available?"
1982.82-52,1,16023,amy_jo_gittler,,1975.717,2000.145,"Your Honor, the issue of the burden of proof in this case is really a bogus issue, because in this case we are dealing, Justice O'Connor, with an explicit sex-based classification, and the burden of proof with respect to the existence or non-existence of unisex tables is irrelevant for these purposes, because once we have shown that there is an explicit sex-based classification, that is all that we need to show."
1982.82-52,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2001.831,2007.346,"But you do concede that you have the burden, the respondents as plaintiffs had the burden of proof initially, right?"
1982.82-52,1,16023,amy_jo_gittler,,2007.346,2043.158,"--That's correct, Your Honor, and our burden in this case was met when we established that in fact there was an explicit sex-based classification, and Manhart teaches us that once there is an explicit sex-based classification based upon actuarial tables, as in this case, that the employer is liable under Title 7, and none of the bases upon which the employer now seeks to absolve itself of liability are sufficient to allow it to remove the mandate and the prohibitions established by Congress under Title 7."
1982.82-52,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2066.915,2068.493,Are they compelled to participate?
1982.82-52,1,16023,amy_jo_gittler,,2071.897,2073.459,"No, Chief Justice Burger."
1982.82-52,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2096.527,2100.62,What was the explicit sex classification here?
1982.82-52,1,16023,amy_jo_gittler,,2100.62,2105.368,"It was explicit gender-based classification between men and women, and the parties--"
1982.82-52,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2105.368,2106.118,How was that evidenced?
1982.82-52,1,16023,amy_jo_gittler,,2108.866,2112.974,"--You can read it, Your Honor, in the very contracts that have been signed."
1982.82-52,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2122.628,2124.735,But the employer didn't mandate that.
1982.82-52,1,16023,amy_jo_gittler,,2142.79,2159.471,"It is as a result of the contracts that the state has entered into with the insurance companies that creates this discrimination, but the mere fact that they have contracted with these insurance companies is not sufficient to eliminate the liability."
1982.82-52,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2159.471,2166.625,The employer didn't ask insurance companies to bid based on gender-based annuity.
1982.82-52,1,16023,amy_jo_gittler,,2174.777,2195.675,"Your Honor, as we establish or argue in our brief, Exhibit H to the first set of interrogatories in fact suggests that there was an actual overt solicitation for bids broken down by men and women, and even so, regardless of whether there was an overt solicitation, the employer was not compelled to provide this kind of discrimination."
1982.82-52,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2217.604,2221.226,"Well, Ms. Gittler, what if the employer had self-insured in this case."
1982.82-52,1,16023,amy_jo_gittler,,2230.754,2233.675,"That's correct, Justice Rehnquist."
1982.82-52,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2247.436,2266.053,"Wouldn't the result, if the employer had done that, be very much as Mr. Endicott predicted in the unisex policies, that there would be no men applicants for this particular self-insurance policy that you are mentioning, and that the only applicants would be women, and they would end up paying the female rate?"
1982.82-52,1,16023,amy_jo_gittler,,2266.053,2275.471,"That is not correct, Justice Rehnquist, because under this particular plan in particular, it is an attractive plan to employees because of the significant tax benefits."
1982.82-52,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2276.627,2300.602,"Well, but presumably an employee who has an option of joining the employer's unisex plan, which you say he must have, or taking the money that it would cost to pay premiums in that and go to an insurance company which does rate on the basis of gender, the men are going to go to an insurance company that rates on the basis of gender."
1982.82-52,1,16023,amy_jo_gittler,,2303.943,2309.457,"--Justice Rehnquist, we think that is not an accurate assumption to make in reviewing this case."
1982.82-52,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2376.633,2384.848,Would it be unlawful for an insurance company to charge lower rates for women for life insurance than for men?
1982.82-52,1,16023,amy_jo_gittler,,2384.848,2386.535,Your Honor--
1982.82-52,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2386.535,2389.408,Would that be illegal discrimination?
1982.82-52,1,16023,amy_jo_gittler,,2389.408,2423.364,"--Chief Justice Burger, if it was done in the context of an employer providing the fringe benefit, and that is what we are talking about today, an insurance company in the abstract out in the market is not susceptible to Title 7 in this context but if an employer undertakes to provide life insurance, for example, to an employee, then again Manhart teaches us that the amounts that are paid in or the amounts that are paid out could not be based upon aggregates, cannot be based upon sex-segregated actuarial tables."
1982.82-52,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2423.364,2427.019,"Ms. Gittler, may I ask you a question about burden of proof?"
1982.82-52,1,16023,amy_jo_gittler,,2472.125,2491.806,"Justice Stevens, I don't think that that's an issue that either party needs to necessarily prove one way or the other, because once they have undertaken to provide a sex-discriminatory plan, whether or not there might be some adverse consequences of this Court holds that Title 7 applies is not really relevant to the issue of liability under Title 7."
1982.82-52,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2491.806,2500.176,"In other words, you are saying that if there is a violation of law, even if establishing the violation hurts women generally, that is just an unfortunate consequence of the statute."
1982.82-52,1,16023,amy_jo_gittler,,2500.176,2518.2,"Your Honor, there are always going to be consequences of this Court's decisions, and if in fact... for instance, Mr. Endicott suggested that the consequence if this Court were to uphold the Ninth Circuit, he has suggested that the effect would be to completely eliminate the plan."
1982.82-52,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2518.2,2518.622,Correct.
1982.82-52,1,16023,amy_jo_gittler,,2518.622,2521.309,"That is always a risk that is taken, Your Honor."
1982.82-52,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2588.781,2611.006,"The irony of affirming if a state is to continue, though, to provide an annuity plan after an affirmance is that in order to avoid disparate treatment of women by mandating unisex tables, it will have a disparate impact on men to achieve it."
1982.82-52,1,16023,amy_jo_gittler,,2613.319,2615.178,"--Yes, Justice O'Connor."
1982.82-52,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2716.323,2724.039,"If your position is the correct one, what should inform the Court's selection of remedies, Ms. Gittler?"
1982.82-52,1,16023,amy_jo_gittler,,2734.707,2745.796,"Justice O'Connor, although Mr. Endicott has characterized the relief that was ordered in this case as retroactive, there was nothing retroactive about the relief that was ordered in this case."
1982.82-52,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2768.068,2769.255,Are you satisfied with that?
1982.82-52,1,16023,amy_jo_gittler,,2769.255,2775.816,"--Yes, Your Honor, we have not appealed the decision of the court, the denial of the retroactive benefits."
1982.82-52,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2787.294,2789.981,And yet women in the long run will get more.
1982.82-52,1,16023,amy_jo_gittler,,2789.981,2803.71,"--Justice Blackmun, women as a class, in the aggregate, may get more, but individual women, individuals will not get any more than a similarly situated man."
1982.82-52,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2840.039,2847.286,But your assumption is contrary to the experience of the American Experience Table of Mortality.
1982.82-52,1,16023,amy_jo_gittler,,2870.823,2897.468,"Chief Justice Burger, Manhart teaches us, and the holding in Teal teaches us that it cannot be based on group statistics, that we must under 703(a) look to the individuals, and Title 7 requires us to treat individuals as individuals and not as group statistics, and that is the significant holding that we can derive from Manhart, and it is equally applicable in this case."
1982.82-52,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2900.296,2902.483,"Well, you are driving the option away, aren't you?"
1982.82-52,1,16023,amy_jo_gittler,,2902.483,2909.058,"--Justice Blackmun, you suggested earlier that the result may be that the option is suspended, and--"
1982.82-52,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2909.058,2909.557,Is that what you really want?
1982.82-52,1,16023,amy_jo_gittler,,2909.557,2913.758,"--Your Honor, we want the state to comply with Title 7."
1982.82-52,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2919.569,2920.943,Even though it drives the option away?
1982.82-52,1,16023,amy_jo_gittler,,2920.943,2927.972,"Your Honor, an employer can always absolve itself of liability by not having employees, by not having an employment setting."
1982.82-52,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2929.846,2935.812,"Well, the state of Arizona needs employees, and that is not a very good illustration."
1982.82-52,1,16023,amy_jo_gittler,,2941.513,2945.417,"No, Your Honor, he is not, and at that point he has no obligations in--"
1982.82-52,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2945.417,2947.417,"You are talking about something that is utterly unrealistic, aren't you?"
1982.82-52,1,16023,amy_jo_gittler,,2947.417,2965.722,"--Chief Justice Burger, the point is that Congress has spoken, and we are dealing here with the statute, and I think that is important to emphasize, the statutory prohibitions, and the statute prohibits treating individuals as members of a class, and that's what this Court has held in interpreting Title 7."
1982.82-52,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3000.88,3003.862,"Yes, but you are not suggesting this is an unimportant case."
1982.82-52,1,16023,amy_jo_gittler,,3003.862,3008.455,"No, Your Honor, we are not in any way suggesting that this is an unimportant case."
1982.82-52,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3016.171,3020.653,"Well, but it affects a large number of plans and a large number of people, does it not?"
1982.82-52,1,16023,amy_jo_gittler,,3020.653,3030.602,"Yes, Justice Stevens, it does affect a number of employers, and Mr. Endicott would argue here today for all of those employers that are out there, and that is something that we cannot do."
1982.82-52,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3032.305,3034.304,You are not arguing for all the women employees who are out there?
1982.82-52,1,16023,amy_jo_gittler,,3038.896,3045.252,"--That's correct, Your Honor, but we cannot address the possible... all the possible issues that might be raised by other employers."
1982.82-52,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3062.262,3067.165,"Well, is it part of the record that Arizona has terminated Option 3?"
1982.82-52,1,16023,amy_jo_gittler,,3073.319,3081.175,"--Justice White, I have no personal knowledge that it has, except for the fact that it has avowed to this Court that it has suspended that third option."
1982.82-52,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3081.175,3090.047,"Is that a matter of public notice, is it, or are we permitted to take notice of that, that Arizona is complying in this manner?"
1982.82-52,1,16023,amy_jo_gittler,,3094.468,3122.502,"Your Honor, I have no... no, the... if the employer does not provide the non-discriminatory option, there may, Your Honor, be other issues with respect to contract or other problems with respect to the suspension of the option, but if an employer responds by not providing this particular fringe benefit, that in itself is not a violation except as it may bear on employees who are already participating in the plan or who have already retired."
1982.82-52,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3146.056,3162.782,"Well, my hypothetical question was, if you had a plan which charged women less for life insurance, and the state might well include life insurance in its program, then would that be discrimination against the men?"
1982.82-52,1,16023,amy_jo_gittler,,3162.782,3179.261,"Your Honor, again, that would be discrimination, but I was responding more to Mr. Endicott's suggestion that there was a life insurance program under this particular plan which charged women less, and I know of no such separate provision unless it is included in one of the other options."
1982.82-52,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3179.261,3190.756,Do you think the illegality would be cured if they added a fourth option which was a life insurance policy that gave precisely the same economic benefit to women as a class as this one gives to men as a class?
1982.82-52,1,16023,amy_jo_gittler,,3190.756,3192.349,"Absolutely not, Justice Stevens."
1982.82-52,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3313.037,3314.521,Very well.
1982.82-52,2,30151,john_l_endicott,,3317.598,3321.581,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, just one or two points."
1982.82-52,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3356.081,3360.159,"Mr. Endicott, may I ask you one question?"
1982.82-52,2,30151,john_l_endicott,,3392.786,3395.285,"Two answers to your questions, Your Honor."
1982.82-52,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3416.073,3419.572,Has Congress addressed this problem at all since the Manhart decision?
1982.82-52,2,30151,john_l_endicott,,3419.572,3424.679,"--Congress is presently considering legislation, as I understand it, Your Honor, right now quite actively."
1982.82-52,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3520.937,3522.609,"Thank you, counsel."
