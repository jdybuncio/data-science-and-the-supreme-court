1985.84-1279,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,8.154,We will hear arguments first this morning in Delaware against Van Arsdall.
1985.84-1279,0,39249,richard_e_fairbanks_jr,,14.37,27.755,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the Delaware Supreme Court reversed Robert Van Arsdall's murder conviction because he was not permitted to cross examine Robert Fleetwood on the issue of bias."
1985.84-1279,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,91.698,100.38,"Mr. Fairbanks, does the state concede that there was a violation of the Constitution here, the confrontation clause?"
1985.84-1279,0,39249,richard_e_fairbanks_jr,,107.051,110.909,"Your Honor, we concede that the cross examination should have been permitted."
1985.84-1279,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,110.909,116.594,Was it a violation of the confrontation clause in the state's view--
1985.84-1279,0,39249,richard_e_fairbanks_jr,,116.594,117.531,Your Honor--
1985.84-1279,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,117.531,119.936,--to restrict the cross examination?
1985.84-1279,0,39249,richard_e_fairbanks_jr,,119.936,123.576,--Where you draw a line between cross examination and remedy is not clear.
1985.84-1279,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,127.871,145.191,"Well, I am just trying to determine what the state's position is, whether it is a concession that there was a constitutional error to which the harmless error rule should then be applied, or whether there was no confrontation clause violation in the first place."
1985.84-1279,0,39249,richard_e_fairbanks_jr,,145.191,152.954,"Justice O'Connor, we have not and the parties have not taken a position on that point."
1985.84-1279,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,198.498,222.676,"But it just seems to me, Mr. Fairbanks, that we have to approach the analysis some way, and I am wondering if it is the state's position that you focus on the prejudice in determining whether there is a violation in the first place or whether you focus on it after you concede a violation to determine whether it is harmless."
1985.84-1279,0,39249,richard_e_fairbanks_jr,,222.676,235.499,"Your Honor, this Court has recognized that cross examination restriction cases raise confrontation clause problems because restrictions on cross examination emasculate the right."
1985.84-1279,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,235.499,251.04,"Mr. Fairbanks, throughout your brief you have cited Chapman against California, and did not the Court hold in that case that it doesn't make any difference whether it is a constitutional violation or some other violation that the harmless error rule applies to both categories?"
1985.84-1279,0,39249,richard_e_fairbanks_jr,,251.04,264.081,"Your Honor, Chapman stands for the proposition that at least for federal constitutional violations there is not an automatic reversal rule mandated in all cases, and that therefore some consideration--"
1985.84-1279,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,264.081,273.687,"Undoubtedly courts would look more... give a much closer scrutiny to a constitutional violation, wouldn't you think, than they would to some other statutory or regulation--"
1985.84-1279,0,39249,richard_e_fairbanks_jr,,273.687,276.747,"--That is true, Your Honor, and we are content--"
1985.84-1279,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,276.747,281.761,"--And therefore Justice O'Connor's question, is it a constitutional violation or not?"
1985.84-1279,0,39249,richard_e_fairbanks_jr,,288.946,295.49,"--Justice White, we believe that the error was harmless wherever you placed the burden."
1985.84-1279,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,295.49,302.878,"That may be so, but you don't expect us to say to the Delaware Court, look, you were wrong in saying you never need to look at prejudice."
1985.84-1279,0,39249,richard_e_fairbanks_jr,,307.422,317.231,"Justice White, I think our position is that in the analysis the reversal is not mandated by the Constitution until you look at outcome determinative prejudice."
1985.84-1279,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,324.542,327.789,"Well, where would the federal jurisdiction be if it isn't constitutional error."
1985.84-1279,0,39249,richard_e_fairbanks_jr,,330.398,342.767,--Because the Delaware Supreme Court reversed on the basis that it concluded that the Constitution Sixth Amendment right of confrontation compelled reversal without consideration of outcome determinative prejudice.
1985.84-1279,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,356.403,369.085,"You don't challenge the Supreme Court of Delaware's conclusion that the restriction of cross examination here did violate the Sixth Amendment right, do you?"
1985.84-1279,0,39249,richard_e_fairbanks_jr,,369.085,376.551,--We do not quarrel with the fact that the examination should have been permitted.
1985.84-1279,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,383.127,393.403,"Mr. Fairbanks, I think what we are all probing at from these inquiries is that if this case was decided on a state ground, the case has no business here."
1985.84-1279,0,39249,richard_e_fairbanks_jr,,401.385,406.055,"Chief Justice, I think the Delaware Supreme Court opinion on this point is clear."
1985.84-1279,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,418.003,435.464,"And Chapman tells all of us that even if there is a constitutional error, it might be, it might be subject to the harmless error rule, so what do you lose, if anything, by conceding that there is a constitutional error here?"
1985.84-1279,0,39249,richard_e_fairbanks_jr,,435.464,439.915,"Your Honor, for purposes of this case, we don't quarrel with that fact."
1985.84-1279,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,439.915,442.853,"Well, let's get on with your argument then."
1985.84-1279,0,39249,richard_e_fairbanks_jr,,442.853,450.693,Our point is that this case doesn't require a determination of where you place the line between violation and prejudice.
1985.84-1279,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,455.831,460.673,"Mr. Fairbanks, this is not new, but it still worries me."
1985.84-1279,0,39249,richard_e_fairbanks_jr,,466.218,467.155,"The State of Delaware, Your Honor."
1985.84-1279,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,468.514,471.747,What does the Supreme Court of Delaware... who do they represent?
1985.84-1279,0,39249,richard_e_fairbanks_jr,,471.747,477.933,"Your Honor, the Supreme Court of Delaware is the highest judicial body in the state."
1985.84-1279,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,489.63,490.801,Then it speaks for the State of Delaware.
1985.84-1279,0,39249,richard_e_fairbanks_jr,,490.801,491.755,"Yes, Your Honor--"
1985.84-1279,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,491.755,494.66,And you speak for the State of Delaware.
1985.84-1279,0,39249,richard_e_fairbanks_jr,,498.549,504.547,"--I don't believe that that's the crux of this case, Justice Marshall."
1985.84-1279,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,598.806,603.132,"Mr. Fairbanks, could I interrupt, because I am still a little puzzled."
1985.84-1279,0,39249,richard_e_fairbanks_jr,,622.905,629.761,"--Your Honor, the guts of the Delaware Supreme Court decision is that effective cross examination was not permitted."
1985.84-1279,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,652.283,653.907,But take effective assistance of counsel for a minute.
1985.84-1279,0,39249,richard_e_fairbanks_jr,,661.452,662.451,--That is true.
1985.84-1279,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,662.451,669.792,"So I am asking you, is there a prejudiced component in the confrontation violation in your view?"
1985.84-1279,0,39249,richard_e_fairbanks_jr,,669.792,676.556,We concede that if there is a Prejudiced component... we simply haven't taken a position on that point.
1985.84-1279,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,684.286,688.786,Because the Delaware Supreme Court's analysis really is kind of in two steps.
1985.84-1279,0,39249,richard_e_fairbanks_jr,,701.201,704.466,"They looked at prejudice, we submit, at the wrong place."
1985.84-1279,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,725.255,729.128,"I understand that, but I am just trying to figure out what you are saying, what issue that is directed to."
1985.84-1279,0,39249,richard_e_fairbanks_jr,,738.998,750.275,"--This Court in Davis versus Alaska reversed, and this is the basis upon which the Delaware Supreme Court based its ruling, its interpretation of Davis versus Alaska."
1985.84-1279,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,918.067,932.079,"Mr. Fairbanks, are you taking the position that the state puts on a witness and the defendant says, I want to impeach this witness, and the judge says, oh, that witness isn't important, I won't let you, that he can do that and never... not commit reversible error?"
1985.84-1279,0,39249,richard_e_fairbanks_jr,,935.14,938.045,"--No, Your Honor, because the determination is not the trial court's determination."
1985.84-1279,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,940.434,941.2,"Well, but--"
1985.84-1279,0,39249,richard_e_fairbanks_jr,,941.2,942.683,--based upon a reading of the entire transcript.
1985.84-1279,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,948.133,955.224,"--Well, he says, this is the last witness, this is our last witness, and the judge says, well, he is not important at all, you cannot impeach him."
1985.84-1279,0,39249,richard_e_fairbanks_jr,,955.224,957.692,I think it depends... that that--
1985.84-1279,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,957.692,960.894,Why is it different for a trial judge than for the appellate court?
1985.84-1279,0,39249,richard_e_fairbanks_jr,,960.894,964.813,--It is the same analysis that is undertaken in any harmless error analysis.
1985.84-1279,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,983.87,987.601,"You concede there was error, and then my next question is, what is the source of the error?"
1985.84-1279,0,39249,richard_e_fairbanks_jr,,992.255,997.333,The judge improperly restricted cross examination on--
1985.84-1279,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,997.333,1000.034,What is the source of the rule of law that told him he shouldn't do that?
1985.84-1279,0,39249,richard_e_fairbanks_jr,,1002.58,1016.606,"--The Delaware Supreme Court determined that it was federal constitutional law, and we think that is the error, that the Federal Constitution does not mandate reversal without consideration of harmless error at some point, whether it is in the... wherever you play it."
1985.84-1279,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1016.606,1021.323,But do you agree that the Federal Constitution obligated the judge to allow the impeachment in this case?
1985.84-1279,0,39249,richard_e_fairbanks_jr,,1021.323,1025.118,We agree--
1985.84-1279,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1025.118,1025.696,At the trial level.
1985.84-1279,0,39249,richard_e_fairbanks_jr,,1026.835,1033.256,--We agree that the Federal Constitution is violated if no cross examination of any witness is permitted.
1985.84-1279,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1033.256,1037.706,In this particular case do you agree that the trial judge violated the Federal Constitution?
1985.84-1279,0,39249,richard_e_fairbanks_jr,,1037.706,1042.517,"No, we do not, because we don't believe that the cross examination would have been successful in the first place."
1985.84-1279,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1056.2,1064.822,"Well, would the judge have violated the Federal Constitution if he had said at the trial, I don't think this is a very important witness, I will not allow any impeachment of this witness?"
1985.84-1279,0,39249,richard_e_fairbanks_jr,,1066.43,1068.552,--We think that that is clearly a violation of state law.
1985.84-1279,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1073.926,1074.8,But you don't think it is--
1985.84-1279,0,39249,richard_e_fairbanks_jr,,1074.8,1075.566,--We do not.
1985.84-1279,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1105.524,1113.457,"--If the Delaware Supreme Court had said solely on the basis of Delaware law this is error and reversal, you wouldn't be here."
1985.84-1279,0,39249,richard_e_fairbanks_jr,,1113.457,1113.801,That's correct.
1985.84-1279,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1158.235,1173.308,"Doesn't your case, Mr. Fairbanks, depend on your convincing us that the Court misapplied Chapman and Harrington and the cases that have followed on harmless error, even assuming the presence of the constitutional error?"
1985.84-1279,0,39249,richard_e_fairbanks_jr,,1173.308,1173.902,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1985.84-1279,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1192.361,1193.111,Very well.
1985.84-1279,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1205.2,1213.917,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the question before the Court in this case is essentially one of classification."
1985.84-1279,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1311.438,1330.744,"Well, Mr. Larkin, what is the standard for determining whether there is a confrontation clause violation in a setting such as we have in this case of an isolated error of limiting cross examination of a single witness?"
1985.84-1279,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1334.32,1346.284,"We think a strong argument can be made to support the principle that prejudice should be a component, the reason being is that is consistent with the purpose the confrontation clause serves in the trial process, which is to enhance the accuracy of the outcome."
1985.84-1279,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1356.312,1360.669,"Well, is that your submission, that it is a component of the constitutional violation or not?"
1985.84-1279,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1360.669,1361.435,We didn't make--
1985.84-1279,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1361.435,1363.277,Because there might be a stronger argument on the other side.
1985.84-1279,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1363.277,1365.089,"--Well, there would be--"
1985.84-1279,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1365.089,1366.261,What is your position?
1985.84-1279,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1366.261,1373.944,"--I would, I think, be forced just to say that... I would take the same position we took in the brief."
1985.84-1279,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1399.544,1403.262,"Mr. Larkin, may I just take the other side of the coin?"
1985.84-1279,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1428.547,1431.499,"Well, we think it is not a good practice, and would certainly be error--"
1985.84-1279,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1431.499,1431.718,Of course not.
1985.84-1279,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1434.873,1438.059,--It would turn on whether prejudice is an element of the claim.
1985.84-1279,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1442.29,1444.822,"Well, take this particular case."
1985.84-1279,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1457.285,1465.579,"--Yes, that would be our position, because, although no one would ever condone it, and I think it is unlikely ever to happen--"
1985.84-1279,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1465.579,1470.967,"Well, you might think it is unlikely to deny a right to show any bias on a witness, too, but it happened in this case."
1985.84-1279,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1470.967,1476.996,"--Well, I think the reason it happened was not because of any feeling on the part of the trial judge that he wanted to damage the defense."
1985.84-1279,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1490.194,1492.068,"No, but the prosecutor thought he was important enough to put him on the witness stand."
1985.84-1279,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1497.785,1504.39,"Yes, and it may be not simply just to show that Van Arsdall was in the room, but also to show that Pregent was in the room."
1985.84-1279,2,33696,john_r_williams,,1821.514,1837.273,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, as a result of the constitutional error here, Robert Van Arsdall lost his right to be acquitted or convicted on the basis of all of the evidence which exposes the truth."
1985.84-1279,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1892.861,1901.029,Isn't the issue here whether cross examination would have produced any benefit?
1985.84-1279,2,33696,john_r_williams,,1903.778,1912.196,"Well, I think that is certainly the issue that the state would have presented to this particular Court, and we think that that is an important consideration."
1985.84-1279,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1919.147,1922.801,"Did they pass on that, or did they by a per se rule?"
1985.84-1279,2,33696,john_r_williams,,1922.801,1935.469,"Well, I think they passed on it because at Page 7 of the opinion they point out that the argument that the state is making here today was also asserted to the Delaware Supreme Court."
1985.84-1279,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1940.92,1944.028,"Where are you reading from, counsel, by reference to the petition?"
1985.84-1279,2,33696,john_r_williams,,1944.028,1963.003,--I am not sure if it is in the--
1985.84-1279,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1963.003,1964.472,"Well, don't let me interrupt."
1985.84-1279,2,33696,john_r_williams,,1965.19,1967.096,--It is Page 7 of the reported opinion.
1985.84-1279,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2041.379,2060.902,"--But, counsel, what if the state called the most pro forma sort of witness just to identify documents or something like that, that really there was no contest about, and the Delaware trial court refused to allow cross examination as to bias for that witness."
1985.84-1279,2,33696,john_r_williams,,2066.431,2069.773,"No, Justice Rehnquist, I do not think they would do that."
1985.84-1279,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2093.764,2098.277,"Well, but now did the Supreme Court of Delaware hold that this witness was crucial?"
1985.84-1279,2,33696,john_r_williams,,2098.277,2099.011,I think they did.
1985.84-1279,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2103.4,2107.242,"Do they say... do they paraphrase that, or do you just say they must have thought that?"
1985.84-1279,2,33696,john_r_williams,,2107.242,2123.611,"Well, they cite to their own decision the year before in Webber, the 1983 decision, and one of the things that is pointed out in the Webber versus state decision is one of the exceptions and one of the elements that you look to is cruciality of a witness."
1985.84-1279,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2176.777,2187.913,"Now, is there anywhere in the Supreme Court of Delaware's opinion where they say why the witness cross examined here Fleetwood was crucial or was different from Epps?"
1985.84-1279,2,33696,john_r_williams,,2187.913,2190.38,"Well, I don't think they say that."
1985.84-1279,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2256.854,2263.195,Did they not apply that same approach to the testimony of Detective Bowers?
1985.84-1279,2,33696,john_r_williams,,2274.315,2276.767,"--That is certainly true, Mr. Chief Justice."
1985.84-1279,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2276.767,2282.342,So they don't have an across-the-board per se approach.
1985.84-1279,2,33696,john_r_williams,,2282.342,2286.03,"Oh, definitely not, and I think all you have to do is look at the Van Arsdall opinion."
1985.84-1279,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2444.699,2461.177,"Mr Williams, I would like to understand exactly what your position is with respect to whether or not in this case, at least, the Delaware Supreme Court applied a per se rule."
1985.84-1279,2,33696,john_r_williams,,2502.675,2505.674,That is certainly our position in this case.
1985.84-1279,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2505.94,2512.016,"Are you saying that just to the law of Delaware, or is that the federal constitutional rule?"
1985.84-1279,2,33696,john_r_williams,,2512.016,2514.063,"Well, we have argued that in the alternative."
1985.84-1279,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2528.196,2537.412,"But the Delaware case that you rely on primarily relied in turn on Davis against Alaska, which was a United States constitutional rule."
1985.84-1279,2,33696,john_r_williams,,2537.412,2538.88,--That is certainly true.
1985.84-1279,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2567.524,2583.768,"But coming back to this case, is it your position that wholly without regard to all of the evidence viewed in its totality, that a per se rule must be applied even though it is perfectly clear to the average person or the average lawyer that there was no prejudice?"
1985.84-1279,2,33696,john_r_williams,,2583.768,2587.611,"--No, I don't think the Delaware rule is that simplistic."
1985.84-1279,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2590.062,2597.824,"Do you think if prejudice... if no prejudice can be shown, that there is no per se rule?"
1985.84-1279,2,33696,john_r_williams,,2597.824,2602.822,"--Well, I think you have to decide whether there is a violation or not before you even implicate the Sixth Amendment."
1985.84-1279,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2602.822,2604.587,"Well, let's assume you have a violation to begin with."
1985.84-1279,2,33696,john_r_williams,,2605.915,2606.586,Certainly.
1985.84-1279,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2606.586,2610.069,"Obviously, the judge should have permitted the cross examination."
1985.84-1279,2,33696,john_r_williams,,2624.595,2628.093,"No, I don't think we would say wholly without regard to facts and circumstances."
1985.84-1279,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2628.093,2631.139,So we may look at the facts and circumstances of this case?
1985.84-1279,2,33696,john_r_williams,,2631.139,2637.215,"I think you have to, just as the Delaware Supreme Court did, because the Delaware rule... it says it is a per se rule."
1985.84-1279,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2646.195,2648.57,How do you reconcile those two concepts?
1985.84-1279,2,33696,john_r_williams,,2653.379,2657.8,"--It is certainly a blanket rule, but it is a thin line, I guess is the best way I can characterize it."
1985.84-1279,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2748.122,2751.309,Was this line of argument made to the jury by defense counsel?
1985.84-1279,2,33696,john_r_williams,,2751.309,2753.355,That was our line of argument.
1985.84-1279,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2790.402,2791.933,"Well, Mr. Williams--"
1985.84-1279,2,33696,john_r_williams,,2791.933,2792.948,"Yes, Justice O'Connor."
1985.84-1279,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2792.948,2801.741,--I suppose that Mr. Van Arsdall testified that Mr. Fleetwood did not see him?
1985.84-1279,2,33696,john_r_williams,,2801.741,2809.051,He testified that he did not recall being seen by anyone at the apartment with the exception of Pregent.
1985.84-1279,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2809.051,2821.921,"And didn't Mr. Fleetwood himself indicate that Mr. Fleetwood, that Fleetwood had seen Van Arsdall, but not vice versa?"
1985.84-1279,2,33696,john_r_williams,,2821.921,2827.498,"Well, I don't think Fleetwood could have testified as to what was in Van Arsdall's mind."
1985.84-1279,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2827.856,2834.932,"Well, but at least his testimony is consistent with that, that he didn't think Van Arsdall had seen Fleetwood."
1985.84-1279,2,33696,john_r_williams,,2835.354,2836.916,"--Well, I don't know if that's true or not."
1985.84-1279,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2836.916,2840.65,So I don't see how that would be inconsistent at all with your defense.
1985.84-1279,2,33696,john_r_williams,,2840.65,2849.958,"Well, I think the inconsistency, Justice O'Connor, is the inference that the prosecutor made when it was cross examining Van Arsdall."
1985.84-1279,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2907.403,2909.059,What sort of criminal charges?
1985.84-1279,2,33696,john_r_williams,,2909.059,2913.4,"--The charges, Justice Rehnquist, were that he was charged with being drunk on the highway."
1985.84-1279,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2965.942,2967.504,"Did you try the case, Mr. Williams?"
1985.84-1279,2,33696,john_r_williams,,2967.504,2967.832,"--Yes, sir."
1985.84-1279,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2967.832,2970.675,It was a nine-day trial?
1985.84-1279,2,33696,john_r_williams,,2970.675,2974.033,"No, it was nine days for the prosecution to present its case."
1985.84-1279,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2974.033,2977.311,And how long did Fleetwood's testimony take?
1985.84-1279,2,33696,john_r_williams,,2977.311,2982.84,I can't remember if Fleetwood was on for more than on day or not.
1985.84-1279,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2985.621,2987.855,Including direct and cross?
1985.84-1279,2,33696,john_r_williams,,2987.855,2988.432,Yes.
1985.84-1279,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3009.689,3015.234,I am curious as to just how many pages of transcript does his actual testimony take?
1985.84-1279,2,33696,john_r_williams,,3017.25,3017.531,I don't know.
1985.84-1279,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3344.569,3346.677,Very well.
1985.84-1279,3,39249,richard_e_fairbanks_jr,,3350.083,3350.958,"Thank you, Chief Justice."
1985.84-1279,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3479.875,3481.422,"Thank you, gentlemen."
