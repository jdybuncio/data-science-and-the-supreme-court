1986.85-1358,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,6.737,"We will hear arguments next in No. 85-1358, Lukhard against Reed."
1986.85-1358,0,42559,thomas_j_czelusta,,59.639,84.57,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the question before the Court this morning is whether a state can require a recipient of AFDC benefits who receives a personal injury award to use at least a portion of that award for future living expenses in lieu of receiving AFDC benefits."
1986.85-1358,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,183.102,191.875,"With regard to those items, medical expenses and legal fees, they are deducted before the application of this requirement?"
1986.85-1358,0,42559,thomas_j_czelusta,,191.875,202.081,Under current policy the medical expenses and any other directly related expense is deducted at the front end when determining the disqualification period.
1986.85-1358,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,202.081,206.199,"How about future medical expenses, if it is an ongoing medical problem?"
1986.85-1358,0,42559,thomas_j_czelusta,,206.199,215.824,"In 1984 Congress amended the statute to allow states greater flexibility to shorten the period of ineligibility, and we have done that."
1986.85-1358,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,226.446,227.631,"Yes, how about that situation?"
1986.85-1358,0,42559,thomas_j_czelusta,,236.32,244.308,--If that case had occurred after the 1984 amendment to the Act that person would not have been disqualified at all.
1986.85-1358,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,244.308,249.61,But this particular family is disqualified because it occurred before the adoption of the rule?
1986.85-1358,0,42559,thomas_j_czelusta,,249.61,249.993,Yes.
1986.85-1358,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,249.993,250.545,Is that it?
1986.85-1358,0,42559,thomas_j_czelusta,,250.545,250.961,Yes.
1986.85-1358,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,457.763,461.732,What kind of receipts wouldn't be treated as income?
1986.85-1358,0,42559,thomas_j_czelusta,,467.702,481.843,"If someone owns the house and they sell the house, we would treat the funds that came from the sale of that house as a resource."
1986.85-1358,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,481.843,492.25,So that there would be an incentive in order to bring the resources down to the level at which the person can requalify to spend that money as quickly as possible.
1986.85-1358,0,42559,thomas_j_czelusta,,492.25,493.25,Yes.
1986.85-1358,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,505.391,509.443,"Now, that would only be a problem if you sell a home."
1986.85-1358,0,42559,thomas_j_czelusta,,516.263,516.763,Yes.
1986.85-1358,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,516.763,520.15,So converting it to cash instead of the real estate wouldn't make any difference.
1986.85-1358,0,42559,thomas_j_czelusta,,520.15,521.833,"No, it would be disqualified in either event."
1986.85-1358,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,521.833,525.019,"What about a bequest of $1,500?"
1986.85-1358,0,42559,thomas_j_czelusta,,525.019,528.738,That would be counted as income subject to the lump sum rule.
1986.85-1358,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,535.16,539.862,What if it were a piece of land somewhere?
1986.85-1358,0,42559,thomas_j_czelusta,,539.862,542.814,Land itself is a resource.
1986.85-1358,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,548.218,554.288,So that you would treat the bequest differently from the devise.
1986.85-1358,0,42559,thomas_j_czelusta,,554.288,555.824,Yes.
1986.85-1358,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,589.228,597.817,"Was this, this is the state's construction of this provision?"
1986.85-1358,0,42559,thomas_j_czelusta,,597.817,598.551,Yes.
1986.85-1358,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,598.551,603.221,It is not compelled by any view of the United States?
1986.85-1358,0,42559,thomas_j_czelusta,,603.221,604.588,It is now.
1986.85-1358,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,611.459,613.326,What about before that?
1986.85-1358,0,42559,thomas_j_czelusta,,613.326,626.753,"--Before that the Secretary in accordance with a long-standing policy that the Secretary had would require certain things to be treated as income, such as a retroactive Social Security award."
1986.85-1358,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,626.753,627.87,"Well, what about this particular--"
1986.85-1358,0,42559,thomas_j_czelusta,,627.87,631.555,For this kind of a payment the states had the option--
1986.85-1358,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,631.555,632.324,--I see.
1986.85-1358,0,42559,thomas_j_czelusta,,632.324,635.859,--of treating it as a resource or as income.
1986.85-1358,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,635.859,637.009,"Well, they--"
1986.85-1358,0,42559,thomas_j_czelusta,,637.009,645.298,"And after 1981 to 1986 the Secretary continued that and said, you may do it, but you do not have to."
1986.85-1358,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,647.834,657.122,--Do you understand the Secretary to say the Act requires it or that he is just free to interpret the statute that way?
1986.85-1358,0,42559,thomas_j_czelusta,,657.122,662.426,"The Secretary's position, I believe, is that the statute does not require him to do it."
1986.85-1358,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,662.426,663.293,"Yes, all right."
1986.85-1358,0,42559,thomas_j_czelusta,,663.293,664.961,But it certainly gives him the discretion to do it.
1986.85-1358,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,664.961,666.794,"Well, I guess he is going to speak for himself."
1986.85-1358,0,42559,thomas_j_czelusta,,666.794,667.461,Yes.
1986.85-1358,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,680.721,701.384,"When you answered Justice White in the affirmative when he asked, is this required by the federal government now, did that answer apply not just to the treatment of this income, but also to the treatment that we have been discussing earlier of resources such as a home and so forth?"
1986.85-1358,0,42559,thomas_j_czelusta,,702.917,703.284,Yes.
1986.85-1358,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,703.284,711.573,So all of the answers you have given are now not just Virginia's view but everybody's view by reason of federal law.
1986.85-1358,0,42559,thomas_j_czelusta,,711.573,712.239,0 xxx.
1986.85-1358,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,712.239,721.345,"But the rule is a little different on some of the resources, isn't it, such as... some exchanges of assets now produce income even though they would have produced a resource before."
1986.85-1358,0,42559,thomas_j_czelusta,,729.285,729.668,No.
1986.85-1358,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,729.668,732.569,Under the new federal interpretation?
1986.85-1358,0,42559,thomas_j_czelusta,,733.202,742.842,"Well, one of the things that the federal rule does that we have been doing differently up until now is the issue of casualty loss awards."
1986.85-1358,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,742.842,743.158,Right.
1986.85-1358,0,42559,thomas_j_czelusta,,743.958,756.685,"That right now, although we have moved to change our rule, if a car is destroyed, we treat the insurance payment as a resource, assuming that the person is going to replace the car."
1986.85-1358,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,756.685,758.485,But they require you to treat it as income now.
1986.85-1358,0,42559,thomas_j_czelusta,,758.485,776.78,"But the Secretary says not to the extent that it is earmarked and used for the purposes for which it was intended, so if it comes in intended to replace the car and they go out and replace the car, then the only difference between our rule now and the Secretary's new rule is that we are going to have to ask for receipts and actually go out and see the car."
1986.85-1358,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,776.78,777.297,"Oh, I see."
1986.85-1358,0,42559,thomas_j_czelusta,,777.297,779.731,That is the only difference between the two rules.
1986.85-1358,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,779.731,787.318,Is there any change in the treatment of the medical expenses and the... that you up to now have treated as resource rather than income?
1986.85-1358,0,42559,thomas_j_czelusta,,799.978,804.53,"Well, the money will have been spent by that point in time in paying those medical bills, and--"
1986.85-1358,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,804.53,806.482,And that still will be the same under the new--
1986.85-1358,0,42559,thomas_j_czelusta,,806.482,807.382,"--Yes, that remains the same."
1986.85-1358,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,807.382,811.786,"--Well, but future medical bills will not have been expended."
1986.85-1358,0,42559,thomas_j_czelusta,,811.786,812.186,Correct.
1986.85-1358,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,812.186,818.19,And is it the federal policy that governs on treatment of future medical bills?
1986.85-1358,0,42559,thomas_j_czelusta,,818.19,819.306,It is in the statute now.
1986.85-1358,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,819.306,821.224,How about drugs?
1986.85-1358,0,42559,thomas_j_czelusta,,821.224,841.471,"As I said before, Justice O'Connor, that would shorten the period, so we would disqualify them initially for a period, and then they have the right to come back in and reapply and produce these bills and say, I have incurred these medical expenses, or my husband has absconded with the money, or I had to avoid an eviction, and then we would recalculate the period and shorten it."
1986.85-1358,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,956.011,959.629,"Well, it could have used some other word than ""income"", too."
1986.85-1358,0,42559,thomas_j_czelusta,,959.629,960.479,Certainly.
1986.85-1358,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,960.479,965.3,"Ordinarily you wouldn't think that tort recoveries are income, would you?"
1986.85-1358,0,42559,thomas_j_czelusta,,965.3,968.152,"Again, I think--"
1986.85-1358,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,968.152,968.602,"I mean, just in a--"
1986.85-1358,0,42559,thomas_j_czelusta,,968.602,971.021,"--It depends, I think, on who you are--"
1986.85-1358,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,971.021,973.639,--if you just weren't reading the Social Security Act you wouldn't think that was income.
1986.85-1358,0,42559,thomas_j_czelusta,,973.639,975.722,--It depends on who you talk to.
1986.85-1358,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,992.851,996.319,"Well, I know, but the people who wrote the law weren't just ordinary neighbors."
1986.85-1358,0,42559,thomas_j_czelusta,,1006.526,1014.447,"But even within a technical legal context the word does have different meanings, depending upon that context and the resultant end to be achieved."
1986.85-1358,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1019.801,1021.786,"Thank you, Mr. Czelusta."
1986.85-1358,1,25826,glen_d_nager,,1023.17,1043.465,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, as counsel for petitioners noted, this case presents a question concerning the meaning of the term AFDC part of the Social Security Act."
1986.85-1358,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1054.857,1068.101,"Mr. Nager, it has already been discussed this morning that for a good many years the Department left it up to the states to decide whether to treat it as income or a resource."
1986.85-1358,1,25826,glen_d_nager,,1068.101,1069.034,"--Yes, Justice O'Connor."
1986.85-1358,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1069.234,1070.417,"Now, why the change?"
1986.85-1358,1,25826,glen_d_nager,,1070.417,1081.492,The change arises out of the Secretary's examination of the purposes Congress was trying to promote in amending the statute in 1981.
1986.85-1358,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1112.028,1116.748,"Yes, but if they had spent it that was all right, and the government, the Secretary left it up to the states--"
1986.85-1358,1,25826,glen_d_nager,,1116.748,1117.282,"--Right, and the--"
1986.85-1358,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1117.282,1118.7,--and then all of a sudden there was a change.
1986.85-1358,1,25826,glen_d_nager,,1118.7,1119.117,--Yes.
1986.85-1358,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1167.431,1176.203,"Well, the point is, they have no option any more, and I am wondering if the statute requires that interpretation."
1986.85-1358,1,25826,glen_d_nager,,1176.203,1185.559,"--No, Justice O'Connor, the Secretary's position is not that the statute mandates the personal injury awards and workers' compensation awards be treated as income."
1986.85-1358,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1208.473,1219.863,So you rely or the Secretary relies on some power to enact regulations to further the overall purposes of the statute?
1986.85-1358,1,25826,glen_d_nager,,1219.863,1221.982,"--Yes, Justice O'Connor, Congress--"
1986.85-1358,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1221.982,1225.517,It isn't just an interpretation of the statute that we are considering?
1986.85-1358,1,25826,glen_d_nager,,1225.517,1234.04,--It is a exercise of the Secretary's delegated authority under the statute to interpret the statute.
1986.85-1358,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1287.275,1290.643,"Is it a policy judgment, or is it an interpretive judgment?"
1986.85-1358,1,25826,glen_d_nager,,1290.643,1292.777,"Well, it is an interpretation of the statute, Justice Scalia."
1986.85-1358,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1292.777,1295.679,"I would think so, and all you are saying is, it was no big deal before '81."
1986.85-1358,1,25826,glen_d_nager,,1310.871,1311.69,I couldn't have put it more succinctly.
1986.85-1358,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1394.794,1405.935,"Mr. Nager, now, under the food stamp program, which also is designed to help these same people, these things aren't treated as income, these personal injury awards."
1986.85-1358,1,25826,glen_d_nager,,1405.935,1412.672,"Justice O'Connor, I quibble with your premise that these programs are designed to help the same people."
1986.85-1358,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1635.852,1637.985,"Thank you, Mr. Nager."
1986.85-1358,2,30961,jill_a_hanken,,1639.901,1656.363,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, Virginia and the Secretary of HHS reject the fundamental concept in our common law that a personal injury award only makes the victim whole."
1986.85-1358,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1689.168,1694.405,"The family has money to buy their necessities during that six months, right?"
1986.85-1358,2,30961,jill_a_hanken,,1710.247,1728.043,"It is true that the person has money, but the purpose of that money is to compensate the individual for the injuries that have been suffered, and the problem is that the regulations make no provisions for the family to use the money for the purpose that it is intended."
1986.85-1358,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1728.043,1736.149,"Let's assume an individual gets a multi-million dollar personal injury award, multi-million dollar."
1986.85-1358,2,30961,jill_a_hanken,,1756.895,1765.168,Congress did not intend for multi-million dollar personal injury award that is compensatory to be treated under the lump sum rule.
1986.85-1358,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1876.573,1877.456,Expected according to whom?
1986.85-1358,2,30961,jill_a_hanken,,1878.341,1883.126,--The Congressional estimates at Page 76 of the Joint Appendix.
1986.85-1358,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1887.697,1888.613,"That is not in the statute, though."
1986.85-1358,2,30961,jill_a_hanken,,1888.613,1888.98,--No.
1986.85-1358,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1888.98,1890.149,That is an estimate of whom?
1986.85-1358,2,30961,jill_a_hanken,,1892.851,1901.338,That is in a Congressional... one of the reports prepared by HHS to Congress estimating the--
1986.85-1358,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1901.338,1903.307,Is it in a committee report?
1986.85-1358,2,30961,jill_a_hanken,,1913.431,1926.822,"--Well, that was the amount of savings expected from this particular rule change, and it appears in the OBRA amendments and the final calculations of fiscal savings to be achieved under the various rules."
1986.85-1358,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1941.598,1942.598,"Where is this, Ms. Hanken?"
1986.85-1358,2,30961,jill_a_hanken,,1943.814,1946.05,"In the Joint Appendix, 76."
1986.85-1358,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1946.05,1947.05,Thank you.
1986.85-1358,2,30961,jill_a_hanken,,1947.05,1964.678,And this is a Committee on Ways and Means report estimating the number of families removed from the rolls and the expected impact on the budget.
1986.85-1358,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2000.518,2002.637,May I interrupt you just for a minute?
1986.85-1358,2,30961,jill_a_hanken,,2002.637,2003.137,--Yes.
1986.85-1358,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2003.137,2005.588,How would you classify punitive damages?
1986.85-1358,2,30961,jill_a_hanken,,2005.588,2018.479,"I would classify punitive damages as a gain, as this Court did in the Glentrell Glass case, and since there is a gain it would be more properly classified as income."
1986.85-1358,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2018.479,2020.931,Although they are not compensatory.
1986.85-1358,2,30961,jill_a_hanken,,2020.931,2030.47,"They are not compensatory at all, and therefore could be properly used by the family for future subsistence living expenses."
1986.85-1358,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2030.47,2035.024,"But you would call them, such damages income?"
1986.85-1358,2,30961,jill_a_hanken,,2035.024,2036.308,Yes.
1986.85-1358,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2130.152,2131.785,"They are not allowed to do that, though, are they?"
1986.85-1358,2,30961,jill_a_hanken,,2140.439,2145.926,That is true if the new federal regulation is valid.
1986.85-1358,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2145.926,2150.08,"Well, okay, but your argument assumes that the federal regulation is valid."
1986.85-1358,2,30961,jill_a_hanken,,2156.251,2169.959,"Even under the new regulation there still is an inequity because if the car refrigerator is damaged and money is paid in return, the family can replace the car or refrigerator and return to the program."
1986.85-1358,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2215.439,2221.759,How about prosthetic devices or prescribed drugs or anything of that sort?
1986.85-1358,2,30961,jill_a_hanken,,2221.759,2237.619,"Your Honor, any medical expenses paid with the award would be deducted from the lump sum amount and the length of disqualification could be shortened."
1986.85-1358,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2299.443,2306.949,There may also be a lot of people who can't get on the AFDC rolls right now because the level to quality is too low.
1986.85-1358,2,30961,jill_a_hanken,,2338.934,2339.601,It is not--
1986.85-1358,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2339.601,2341.253,There is hardship on all sides.
1986.85-1358,2,30961,jill_a_hanken,,2341.253,2352.06,"--Well, it is not reasonable because when Congress enacted this statute in 1981 it did not change the definition of income in the AFDC program."
1986.85-1358,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2361.349,2364.718,"It was aware that Virginia was using this definition in 1981, wasn't it?"
1986.85-1358,2,30961,jill_a_hanken,,2364.718,2369.938,"--Your Honor, in 1981, at Page 23 of the joint appendix."
1986.85-1358,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2383.18,2383.93,What about other states?
1986.85-1358,2,30961,jill_a_hanken,,2388.898,2415.901,"There is no evidence in our record that any state was using an option, and in fact the documents referred to by the Secretary and Virginia are all post-OBRA documents discussing an option, and even if there was an option just by the pure definition when your house burns down or is sold, the money is a replacement."
1986.85-1358,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2444.884,2454.276,"Well, Ms. Hanken, isn't it... it also is true that in many personal injury cases you have a very significant element based on loss of earnings that you project the earning capacity in the future, and so forth and so on."
1986.85-1358,2,30961,jill_a_hanken,,2459.061,2481.743,"--Yes, it is true that personal injury awards may include an aspect of lost earnings or lost earning capacity, but most of these situations are settled, and the settlements won't delineate between that portion of the award that is for lost earnings capacity and the portion that is for pain and suffering."
1986.85-1358,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2481.743,2495.301,"No, but it is certainly true, though, that a person who has a substantial salary gets a bigger settlement than a person who has a lower salary, even though the injury is precisely the same, so that it certainly must be part of the settlement figures as well as the awards made by juries and judges."
1986.85-1358,2,30961,jill_a_hanken,,2495.301,2495.517,That is true.
1986.85-1358,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2516.964,2521.201,"See, that kind of cuts against you a little bit, because Congress did it expressly there, didn't they?"
1986.85-1358,2,30961,jill_a_hanken,,2521.201,2527.705,--There is an express exemption in the Internal Revenue Code that exempts personal injury awards.
1986.85-1358,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2562.642,2565.978,"There is also an explicit exception in the food stamp program, isn't there?"
1986.85-1358,2,30961,jill_a_hanken,,2565.978,2566.613,That's true.
1986.85-1358,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2566.613,2568.43,It is set forth explicitly that these things are not covered.
1986.85-1358,2,30961,jill_a_hanken,,2568.43,2568.913,Yes.
1986.85-1358,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2690.561,2691.177,Excuse me.
1986.85-1358,2,30961,jill_a_hanken,,2701.383,2705.487,"--A gift would be like a gain, and would therefore fall under the common definition of income."
1986.85-1358,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2705.487,2708.856,--You think an average person would consider a gift to be income?
1986.85-1358,2,30961,jill_a_hanken,,2735.34,2745.862,"No, but the Secretary does not have the ability or the authority to interpret the word ""income"" in a way that is contrary to what Congress intended."
1986.85-1358,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2745.862,2756.586,"You are saying its entire meaning is not self-evident, but at least it is self-evident that it includes recoveries for personal injuries."
1986.85-1358,2,30961,jill_a_hanken,,2756.586,2759.121,It does not include recoveries--
1986.85-1358,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2759.121,2759.838,"I'm sorry, right."
1986.85-1358,2,30961,jill_a_hanken,,2759.838,2761.99,--It does not include recoveries for personal injuries.
1986.85-1358,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2761.99,2762.59,I wasn't trying to trick you.
1986.85-1358,2,30961,jill_a_hanken,,2763.507,2785.939,"And by using the historical definition of income, accumulated benefits, retroactive Social Security payments, which has always been treated as income... throughout all of the documents of HHS that has always been viewed as income... that would alone have been enough to take care of the $5 million savings and the 5,000 families across the country."
1986.85-1358,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2998.811,3015.773,"Ms. Hanken, you surprised me earlier because it was not my understanding when you said that the practice among the states as far as you know when OBRA was enacted was uniformly to treat these things as resources rather than income."
1986.85-1358,2,30961,jill_a_hanken,,3033.435,3039.554,There isn't evidence in our record that the practices of states was varied.
1986.85-1358,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3040.454,3042.34,"You don't need testimony on that, do you."
1986.85-1358,2,30961,jill_a_hanken,,3049.627,3064.67,"--The Federal Register cite at that point in the Federal Government's brief is one of the post-OBRA cites, a preamble used to explain its shifting of interpretation."
1986.85-1358,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3064.67,3074.228,But does that... that preamble at least does say that the practice among the states at the time of OBRA was varied +/?
1986.85-1358,2,30961,jill_a_hanken,,3074.228,3074.478,That's true.
1986.85-1358,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3075.678,3080.631,--May I ask you another question?
1986.85-1358,2,30961,jill_a_hanken,,3094.273,3094.456,"No, I did not, Your Honor."
1986.85-1358,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3094.456,3097.641,"You did not, so they haven't responded to it yet."
1986.85-1358,2,30961,jill_a_hanken,,3097.641,3098.825,"No, they haven't."
1986.85-1358,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3106.581,3107.231,It is in the record.
1986.85-1358,2,30961,jill_a_hanken,,3107.231,3113.686,And in public documents Virginia's share of the national case load can easily be found.
1986.85-1358,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3113.686,3114.419,I see.
1986.85-1358,2,30961,jill_a_hanken,,3114.419,3122.19,It is essential that the rule here is limited to the scope envisioned by Congress.
1986.85-1358,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3130.529,3130.945,Excuse me.
1986.85-1358,2,30961,jill_a_hanken,,3137.099,3142.135,"Your Honor, I don't take the position that all states' practices were uniform."
1986.85-1358,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3158.179,3164.416,Did you contest the Solicitor General's statement in your reply brief that practice among the states was varied?
1986.85-1358,2,30961,jill_a_hanken,,3186.782,3209.529,"Well, even if the practices of states was varied, and it is true that prior to 1981 the distinction between income and resources, while separate and different, it was not nearly as important as the distinction today in terms of how the two are treated."
1986.85-1358,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3210.731,3218.135,"No, but you make a point that the Congress presumptively knew what the practices were, and if they were different the presumption cuts one way and if they are the same it cuts the other way."
1986.85-1358,2,30961,jill_a_hanken,,3218.135,3241.433,"--Well, the one thing that Congress knew is that the only consistent definition of income was accumulated benefits, the retroactive Social Security awards, and that has been the definition of income for many years by HHS, and that was the concern of Congress in adopting this new income rule."
1986.85-1358,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3325.939,3328.206,"Thank you, Ms. Hanken."
1986.85-1358,3,42559,thomas_j_czelusta,,3330.491,3337.997,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, if the Court has any questions, I will answer them."
1986.85-1358,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3337.997,3339.53,"Yes, do you have an answer to the 5,000 argument?"
1986.85-1358,3,42559,thomas_j_czelusta,,3339.53,3343.568,Ms. Hanken is wrong on the figures.
1986.85-1358,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3350.638,3351.238,I see.
1986.85-1358,3,42559,thomas_j_czelusta,,3352.254,3356.541,"If the Court has no further questions, I have no further rebuttal."
1986.85-1358,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3356.541,3357.441,Thank you.
