1974.73-1279,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,11.641,"We'll hear arguments first this morning in Number 73-1279, the Williams & Wilkins Company against the United States."
1974.73-1279,0,16402,alan_latman,,18.817,22.002,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1974.73-1279,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,145.449,153.669,Has the doctrine of fair use ever been upheld or specifically adopted by any opinion in this Court?
1974.73-1279,0,16402,alan_latman,,153.669,171.577,"I don't believe it has, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, the doctrine was raised in the so-called Jack Benny case which did reach this Court and it was a case which held that a taking of someone else's work either even as a parity constituted infringement, that was a Ninth Circuit case."
1974.73-1279,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,209.032,212.359,Is the Ninth Circuit case the Gas Light case?
1974.73-1279,0,16402,alan_latman,,212.359,213.774,Yes it is Mr. Justice Stewart.
1974.73-1279,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,213.774,214.956,The parity or the 0335
1974.73-1279,0,16402,alan_latman,,214.956,221.961,"That's correct, it was -- Mr. Benny put on what he called auto light as a parity of gas light."
1974.73-1279,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,241.238,242.929,And that was affirmed by an equally divided Court?
1974.73-1279,0,16402,alan_latman,,242.929,251.301,Yes Your Honor.
1974.73-1279,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,301.685,306.726,"Who are the principal constituents of those libraries, the users?"
1974.73-1279,0,16402,alan_latman,,306.726,308.16,"They vary, Your Honor."
1974.73-1279,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,393.847,399.246,The practice used to be before the era of Xerox?
1974.73-1279,0,16402,alan_latman,,399.246,402.651,"The practice of individuals, libraries?"
1974.73-1279,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,402.651,403.576,I just want to know.
1974.73-1279,0,16402,alan_latman,,403.576,431.526,"Was namely to take notes by hand and then in the turn of the century and in the going up to the thirties, there was the system of Photostats and rather elaborate system of dark room facilities which meant that until you got to the era of Xerox, Mr. Justice Stewart, you had a situation where it was impracticable and uneconomical and slow to reproduce an entire article."
1974.73-1279,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,464.441,476.631,"Did the libraries, the National Library, the national Institute of Health before the early 60's subscribed to more copies of your publications than they now do?"
1974.73-1279,0,16402,alan_latman,,476.631,479.928,"No, I don't believe the record is conclusive one way or another."
1974.73-1279,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,611.036,620.818,"Mr. Latman, does the record show how many reprints were supplied to each author of his article?"
1974.73-1279,0,16402,alan_latman,,620.818,627.56,"It does, Mr. Justice Blackmun, it shows that on the average, about 300 reprints are furnished."
1974.73-1279,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,627.56,629.087,That is free of charge?
1974.73-1279,0,16402,alan_latman,,629.087,635.512,"No, there is a certain amount that’s free of charge, 25 or so and the rest are purchased."
1974.73-1279,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,658.703,673.136,"What barriers are there, if any to having a person who desires one of these copies to write to the publisher, your clients got to copy directly."
1974.73-1279,0,16402,alan_latman,,673.136,684.455,"We don't think there's any barriers, we think that -- but in order to facilitate the situation, because in the past it is hard to stock actual back copies."
1974.73-1279,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,769.27,771.915,"Mr. Latman, do you have the same experience with the private library?"
1974.73-1279,0,16402,alan_latman,,771.915,781.478,"Well we've had almost a worst experience, Mr. Justice White and that we almost run into a boycott and I think I've appended to our brief in our experience."
1974.73-1279,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,841.061,846.668,"Somewhere in this massive brief, perhaps in one of the amicus briefs, there was a reference to the library of Congress."
1974.73-1279,0,16402,alan_latman,,846.668,848.083,Yes.
1974.73-1279,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,848.083,855.434,"Could you clarify what it is s, if you know, what is their practice with respect to these furnishing photocopies."
1974.73-1279,0,16402,alan_latman,,855.434,862.323,"Mr. Chief Justice, their practice is in direct and dramatic contrast to the libraries in question."
1974.73-1279,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,901.956,906.837,Right to the public or does it also apply to members of Congress?
1974.73-1279,0,16402,alan_latman,,906.837,908.569,"Does -- what apply, Mr. Justice Marshall?"
1974.73-1279,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,908.569,910.975,That we you just read.
1974.73-1279,0,16402,alan_latman,,910.975,921.546,"I believe it does, I don't know of any exceptions to their policy, on the other hand I'm not familiar with the practice with regard to member of Congress."
1974.73-1279,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,933.439,940.589,"Well the two libraries you're talking about, that's limited to Government use."
1974.73-1279,0,16402,alan_latman,,940.589,942.332,Not the National Library of Medicine.
1974.73-1279,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,942.332,954.571,"If for example if somebody in the National Institute of Health wants a copy of an article, do you think he should be paying for that?"
1974.73-1279,0,16402,alan_latman,,954.571,972.584,"Yes we think that they should pay for it just as they pay for the subscriptions they buy, just as they pay for the microfilm additions, all of which are alternative ways to use the journals, alternative ways to use it within the meaning of the copyright law which provides for exclusive rights to print, reprint and copy."
1974.73-1279,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,979.801,982.663,So that is -- they have several thousand people out there.
1974.73-1279,0,16402,alan_latman,,985.209,993.188,"No, what they could do is to take a license and pay literally a few more dollars a year in order to get --"
1974.73-1279,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,993.188,995.166,Thousand dollars each time they did it.
1974.73-1279,0,16402,alan_latman,,995.166,996.391,"No, no the proposal that we --"
1974.73-1279,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,996.391,997.973,How much money are we talking about?
1974.73-1279,0,16402,alan_latman,,997.973,998.606,Excuse me?
1974.73-1279,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,998.606,999.433,How much money are we talking about?
1974.73-1279,0,16402,alan_latman,,999.433,1014.075,"Well, the proposal that we talked about, which we had to withdraw under the threat of boycott that I indicated, averaged about $3.65 a year for the library, for the life of that particular journal."
1974.73-1279,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1018.232,1021.064,And how much would that be per year?
1974.73-1279,0,16402,alan_latman,,1021.064,1022.475,Well it would vary.
1974.73-1279,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1048.015,1050.863,"That's all the license would bring in is $10,000.00 a year?"
1974.73-1279,0,16402,alan_latman,,1050.863,1053.948,That's all it would bring in if it were accepted.
1974.73-1279,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1053.948,1055.296,That's all we're talking about?
1974.73-1279,0,16402,alan_latman,,1055.296,1059.487,"No, we're talking about more, Mr. Justice Marshall because --"
1974.73-1279,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1059.487,1061.864,It's very hard to find out how much more.
1974.73-1279,0,16402,alan_latman,,1061.864,1066.075,Well it's hard to put a specific dollars and cents tag on it.
1974.73-1279,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1103.782,1117.715,Of course the Court of Claims said that -- Judge Davis said that the Court didn't have the power to compel you to license to a private individual and while you might be willing to some other person in a similar situation might not.
1974.73-1279,0,16402,alan_latman,,1117.715,1129.467,"To begin with Mr. Justice Rehnquist, a person in a similar situation, of course suing the Government has no alternative and the Government is very important subscriber and a very important factor here."
1974.73-1279,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1174.448,1179.363,And the matter would be open for congressional regulation too I think.
1974.73-1279,0,16402,alan_latman,,1179.363,1185.012,"Well it's been open for congressional regulation, Mr. Justice White for many years."
1974.73-1279,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1458.04,1463.279,"Mr. Latman, could I go back to my former question about reprints."
1974.73-1279,0,16402,alan_latman,,1470.519,1471.353,"I believe it does, Your Honor."
1974.73-1279,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1471.353,1475.939,Is it nominal?
1974.73-1279,0,16402,alan_latman,,1475.939,1481.171,I am not sure but I know where the record shows exactly what is charged.
1974.73-1279,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1481.171,1515.925,"I ask this because I know the tendency and I personally think it's been abused greatly of the medical profession at least and I think scientists in general to request almost automatically with penny postcards, used to be penny postcards for thousands of reprints literally and offering to pay no charge expecting the author to supply these and I suppose this or does it similarly come in in a flow to the publisher?"
1974.73-1279,0,16402,alan_latman,,1515.925,1533.018,"Well it does but we think that what's happened, Mr. Justice Blackmun is instead of doing it that way, I have found similarly that people will indiscriminately gather reprints but in the form of photocopies but even though we don't want to stop this, we think that it’s convenient."
1974.73-1279,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1542.941,1557.584,"Now it's not uncommon for judges, members of this Court and others to call on the Library of Congress for a book, sometimes perhaps it's a book at which they have only one or very few copies."
1974.73-1279,0,16402,alan_latman,,1596.128,1596.294,That is --
1974.73-1279,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1596.294,1599.265,Of a copyrighted material?
1974.73-1279,0,16402,alan_latman,,1599.265,1606.531,That is hard a question which we think is quite different from this case and therefore I could just give my opinion on that.
1974.73-1279,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1646.148,1650.44,Is it your opinion that nobody would sue the Chief Justice or that nobody would sue anyone?
1974.73-1279,0,16402,alan_latman,,1650.44,1653.304,No.
1974.73-1279,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1659.689,1673.967,"But supposed his damage claim, suppose I have 10 copies to send to my colleagues so that we would all the sharing in this, recovery might be diminimous."
1974.73-1279,0,16402,alan_latman,,1673.967,1674.721,Exactly.
1974.73-1279,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1674.721,1677.043,So that no one would have any incentive to sue.
1974.73-1279,0,16402,alan_latman,,1677.043,1678.334,Exactly.
1974.73-1279,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1708.005,1712.099,I assume it’s faster than getting a reprint.
1974.73-1279,0,16402,alan_latman,,1712.099,1715.235,It is that the procedure is fast.
1974.73-1279,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1715.235,1717.228,Faster than getting a reprint.
1974.73-1279,0,16402,alan_latman,,1717.228,1720.474,It would be faster than getting a reprint and that's why we encourage --
1974.73-1279,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1720.474,1722.477,It might be an emergency.
1974.73-1279,0,16402,alan_latman,,1722.477,1732.936,"It might be and that's why we encourage the authorized licensing fee that justice, they would have the microfilm which is another alternative that they have the opportunity to do it quickly."
1974.73-1279,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1745.774,1748.995,"Either one now run the library, do you?"
1974.73-1279,0,16402,alan_latman,,1748.995,1749.605,No.
1974.73-1279,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1749.605,1750.759,"You don't want to do that, do you?"
1974.73-1279,0,16402,alan_latman,,1750.759,1752.772,No I do not Mr. Justice Marshall.
1974.73-1279,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1777.464,1778.273,Very well.
1974.73-1279,0,16402,alan_latman,,1778.273,1780.813,Thank you.
1974.73-1279,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1780.813,1783.188,Mr. Solicitor General.
1974.73-1279,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,1783.188,1785.822,Mr. Chief Justice may it please the Court.
1974.73-1279,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1807.359,1811.995,"General Bork, that doesn’t mean that they haven't complained about it, does it surely?"
1974.73-1279,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,1811.995,1814.569,There have been remarkably little complaint Mr. Justice Blackmun.
1974.73-1279,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1825.058,1829.24,Of course I can testify that I have many complaints personally.
1974.73-1279,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,1829.24,1831.474,Well I think there has been.
1974.73-1279,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1831.474,1840.504,What is the level of complaints rising in direct proportion to the number of photocopying machines?
1974.73-1279,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,1840.504,1851.862,I think so Mr. Chief Justice but I think the number of complaints have to do with practices other than that followed by the National Library of Medicine and National Institute of Health.
1974.73-1279,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1875.398,1885.924,Let me suggest what is probably simplistic and hypothetical proposition with a very obvious answer.
1974.73-1279,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,1906.209,1909.605,I have no doubt Mr. Chief Justice that that is clear infringement.
1974.73-1279,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1913.616,1918.106,Well is it different because the medium of abuse is different?
1974.73-1279,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,1918.106,1923.919,"Well it's different for a complete variety of reasons, one is, the non-commercial use here."
1974.73-1279,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1985.719,1998.674,"Well if I am just interested in the first act of the Macado, I suppose I can say the first act of the Macado isn't a substitute for the whole lot so I'll just copy the first act and it's not a substitute."
1974.73-1279,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,2001.356,2009.761,"It might well not be fair use, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, my primary answer to it is that is not the fact, that is not this case."
1974.73-1279,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2066.319,2069.475,"Well, is it quite that broad?"
1974.73-1279,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,2069.475,2070.597,No it's not quite that broad.
1974.73-1279,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2070.597,2078.62,Perhaps it means he can have a copy of that article for $0.75 instead of getting it for nothing.
1974.73-1279,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,2078.62,2080.366,"Oh, on the -- if we --"
1974.73-1279,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2080.366,2084.42,So that the publisher gets some sort of a royalty.
1974.73-1279,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,2089.569,2104.116,"That's correct Mr. Chief Justice and to that I have two answers, one is that there is no infringement of the Copyright Act here either because the Copyright Act doesn't cover this practice or because it is covered by a fair use and I think that's fairly clear."
1974.73-1279,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2122.054,2132.86,"Well 20 years ago, what would you guess would be the number of copies that were furnished out of the medical library, if the medical library was in existence?"
1974.73-1279,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,2132.86,2134.49,No.
1974.73-1279,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2134.49,2137.549,"Which was I guess, wasn't it?"
1974.73-1279,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,2137.549,2139.426,"NIH may have been, Mr. Chief Justice."
1974.73-1279,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2342.508,2353.347,"Except, Mr. Solicitor General, the whole -- the only thing to be decided in those two cases was the meaning of the word perform under the 1907 Act."
1974.73-1279,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,2374.471,2376.854,"I think there is, Mr. Justice Stewart, that's precisely my point."
1974.73-1279,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2445.31,2454.792,The United States has taken a position then that this simply isn't copying and that we don't even need to reach the fair use issue.
1974.73-1279,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,2454.792,2455.34,That is correct.
1974.73-1279,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2456.89,2459.981,You didn't put that in your -- is that in your brief?
1974.73-1279,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,2459.981,2468.66,"In our brief, we say in a footnote citing some other briefs and some of these cases I'm not discussing that it is argued persuasively that."
1974.73-1279,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2495.806,2508.527,But does that direct you some of the history of the act and you never had -- you have arrived at this conclusion without ever having had a fair use doctrine.
1974.73-1279,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,2508.527,2513.561,"That's true, that is true, that is true."
1974.73-1279,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2531.656,2536.856,Well there's quite a difference between copying a couple of paragraphs and quoting it and --
1974.73-1279,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,2536.856,2537.418,There's quite a difference [voice overlap]
1974.73-1279,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2537.418,2539.309,The whole thing is compared.
1974.73-1279,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,2539.309,2540.273,There is quite a difference.
1974.73-1279,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2548.388,2569.153,"Well sometimes a copyright owner will, for example syndicated columnist or writer of an article will have some sort of a footnote saying that up to 700 words may be used out of this article by permission of the copyright owner."
1974.73-1279,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,2569.153,2569.818,That is correct.
1974.73-1279,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2569.818,2578.428,"So that suggests that for many purposes, there's regarded quite a difference under copyright law."
1974.73-1279,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,2578.428,2579.882,Or it may be regarded as quite a difference.
1974.73-1279,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2601.318,2609.256,Don't you occasionally have journals so that may have one very important lead article that might comprise say two thirds of the journal?
1974.73-1279,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,2609.256,2610.757,I simply -- that may occur --
1974.73-1279,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2610.757,2612.902,It's true in law review --
1974.73-1279,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,2612.902,2614.476,Yes it is.
1974.73-1279,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2614.476,2618.19,And would you say a way it was a fair use to copy the lead article?
1974.73-1279,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,2618.19,2624.303,"As I understand the National Library of Medicine's policy, they will not copy as much as half of the journal."
1974.73-1279,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2633.396,2651.8,"But it is true that if the seeker of this material could not get it free from the National Library of Medicine, he would have to pay something, $0.25, a dollar for a reprint, isn't it?"
1974.73-1279,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,2651.8,2652.356,That is true.
1974.73-1279,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2723.948,2728.123,Why won't the medical library copy an entire journal?
1974.73-1279,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,2728.123,2737.719,"Well I think the, Mr. Justice White that the reason that they respect petitioner's copyright interest of not --"
1974.73-1279,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2737.719,2738.483,About what.
1974.73-1279,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,2738.483,2741.839,"Well, he has a copyright interest on each article."
1974.73-1279,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2746.255,2750.713,Well I know but the copyright attaches to each article I take it.
1974.73-1279,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,2750.713,2752.123,That's correct.
1974.73-1279,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2752.123,2755.662,And but the library is not reluctant to copy an entire article?
1974.73-1279,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,2755.662,2759.213,No but what the petition sells is a journal.
1974.73-1279,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2759.559,2766.598,"I'm not talking about a copyright, not a—"
1974.73-1279,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,2766.598,2766.821,That's true.
1974.73-1279,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2766.821,2770.638,Not whether the subscription.
1974.73-1279,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,2770.638,2781.973,"Well for the reasons I'm arguing today, Mr. Justice White, the National Library of Medicine believes that it is not infringing a copyright when it does that."
1974.73-1279,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2781.973,2785.522,It might as well copy the entire magazine.
1974.73-1279,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,2785.522,2793.789,"No Mr. Justice White, if it copied the entire magazine it would be providing a substitute for what petitioner sells."
1974.73-1279,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2797.212,2800.683,Or doesn't the petitioner also sell reprints?
1974.73-1279,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,2800.683,2814.183,"He does sell reprints and let me say this Mr. Justice Blackmun, we're talking here not just about the petitioner, we're talking about five or 600 publishers of medical journals in very different circumstances."
1974.73-1279,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2849.463,2881.391,"Now there is a statute on record piracy, I have forgotten the particular statute that provides an automatic licensing if there is a hit record, you or I or anyone else may, who are in the business of making records, copy it without the consent of the copyright owner but we have to keep a record, written record of how many copies we make and pay, I think the statute provides $0.05 for each copy."
1974.73-1279,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,2885.343,2894.236,I think it may be feasible Mr. Chief Justice and but let me tell you why I think it ought not to be imposed by a rule of Court rather than by a rule of legislature.
1974.73-1279,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2896.837,2900.406,Yes we haven't come to that point yet whether the Court has got any power.
1974.73-1279,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,2901.501,2906.188,Well I think this is -- I think it's tied intimately with this question.
1974.73-1279,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3076.848,3082.372,Well I think that your brother's point on the other side is that choice has been made by Congress.
1974.73-1279,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,3082.372,3093.284,"Well, Mr. Justice Stewart, if it has been made by Congress, it's a choice that has not been enforced for 50 or 60 years while copying practices have been going on and growing."
1974.73-1279,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3104.625,3106.068,Well that's what this case is about.
1974.73-1279,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,3106.068,3108.429,"That is true, that is true."
1974.73-1279,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3139.361,3147.695,Are you suggesting that Congress would be constitutionally obligated to incorporate a doctrine of fair use under the copyright law?
1974.73-1279,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,3147.695,3152.008,I don't -- that is debatable.
1974.73-1279,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3157.119,3160.762,I thought you said a moment ago that that fair use was a constitutionally --
1974.73-1279,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,3160.762,3181.055,"The Courts have derived their power to evolve a doctrine of fair use from the constitutional value, the constitutional principle -- whether or not the Courts could second guess Congress' decision about what would promote rather than retard, I don't know."
1974.73-1279,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3235.839,3243.326,Is that a demonstrable proposition or simply an arguable one?
1974.73-1279,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,3243.326,3256.351,"Mr. Chief Justice I think its about as demonstrable, if I may make the comparison as market definition in antitrust cases."
1974.73-1279,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3293.381,3307.892,"If I understand the petitioner's position, they don't want to curtail the dissemination of information, medical or scientific that they simply want piece of the pies that were --"
1974.73-1279,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,3307.892,3310.241,Mr. Chief Justice they are bound to curtail it.
1974.73-1279,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3337.274,3356.458,I take it what you're saying is that this can only be resolved -- this could not only be resolved by Congress doing something like what they have done with the mandatory copying of records.
1974.73-1279,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,3356.458,3362.391,Or Congress doing something of that sort or perhaps making a solution to differentiate among the different interests involved here.
1974.73-1279,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3423.405,3429.982,"Well in one breath, you say the thing is going to result in chaos and then in the next breath you say how negligible it is."
1974.73-1279,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,3429.982,3438.688,"Yes, that's right Mr. Justice Rehnquist and I confess that I think that both of those breaths are internally consistent, yes."
1974.73-1279,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3516.188,3520.284,Mr. Latman you have just one minute left.
1974.73-1279,2,16402,alan_latman,,3520.284,3526.248,"Well if I may, I think that the Solicitor general's market potential test is a good test."
1974.73-1279,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3608.761,3611.511,"Thank you Mr. Latman, thank you Mr. Solicitor General."
