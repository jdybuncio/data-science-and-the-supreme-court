1985.84-1529,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,7.904,The Court will hear arguments first this morning in Bowen against American Hospital Association.
1985.84-1529,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,10.289,13.991,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1985.84-1529,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,474.391,492.186,"Mr. Cooper, is it true that the administrative record doesn't have any examples in it of a hospital which has refused to treat a handicapped infant when the parents have consented to treatment?"
1985.84-1529,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,492.186,495.822,I believe that is accurate.
1985.84-1529,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,496.59,506.53,"So what you're really concerned about and what the record supports, I suppose, is cases when the parents have refused to give consent to treatment?"
1985.84-1529,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,506.53,514.468,"--That is the circumstance which creates the problem that these regulations are designed to address, that is certainly true, but--"
1985.84-1529,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,514.468,517.253,"These are guidelines, are they not?"
1985.84-1529,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,520.372,523.49,--There are interpretive guidelines--
1985.84-1529,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,523.49,523.94,Or a rule?
1985.84-1529,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,528.126,532.846,"--There are procedural rules, Justice O'Connor, as well as--"
1985.84-1529,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,532.846,535.965,They've been adopted in accordance with the Administrative Procedures Act?
1985.84-1529,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,535.965,536.932,"--Yes, yes."
1985.84-1529,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,565.834,569.703,The posting of a notice and the right to get records.
1985.84-1529,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,569.703,572.888,"--That's right, expedited access to records."
1985.84-1529,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,572.888,589.432,"And the real focus actually is on situations where parents have refused to give consent to treatment, and in that context would you explain how the regulations operate and how you see the application of the Act?"
1985.84-1529,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,589.432,591.984,Yes.
1985.84-1529,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,613.715,617.334,"Well, it's also the case where the doctor agrees with the parents, isn't it?"
1985.84-1529,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,617.334,632.795,"--That may or may not be true, but certainly in some of the examples that are available the doctor and the parents are in agreement with respect to withholding a particular treatment, yes."
1985.84-1529,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,632.795,635.997,"Well, you can tell us about both of those situations, then."
1985.84-1529,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,654.125,673.353,"It would certainly be a battery, Justice O'Connor, unless the parents' refusal to give consent was overridden by operation of state law and if... and this is not uncommon in the care of infants, newborns."
1985.84-1529,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,741.915,758.442,"What has been the practice in the 50 states with regard to situations that you're concerned about, to wit the parents refuse treatment, the doctor agrees no treatment will be provided, the hospital says no treatment."
1985.84-1529,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,768.834,777.154,"Under those circumstances, the child protective agencies may not know about this course of conduct that's been agreed upon."
1985.84-1529,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,777.154,785.093,"Well, presumably you've researched and you can tell us what is effect is happening in the various states in this regard."
1985.84-1529,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,785.093,833.24,"Well, Justice O'Connor, the states... what happens in the states differs, I suspect, quite widely, and it differs in the context of the very example that gave rise to these regulations, that is the Bloomington Baby Doe situation, where a child was born with Down's Syndrome and also had an esophagus that was blocked, and the decision was made by the parents, in consultation with one of the doctors, not to feed, either intravenously or otherwise enable the child to receive nourishment, and it consequently died."
1985.84-1529,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,844.565,854.94,"Mr. Cooper, may I ask you, with regard to that particular case, if the regulations under review today had been in place at that time, would anything different have happened?"
1985.84-1529,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,854.94,855.44,"--No, sir."
1985.84-1529,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,855.44,857.225,So there was no violation?
1985.84-1529,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,862.86,864.479,"I think that's accurate, Your Honor."
1985.84-1529,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,864.479,869.132,"So if you have the regulations at all, we'd have precisely the same problem that gave rise to the regulations?"
1985.84-1529,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,869.132,890.029,"In that particular circumstance, where a hospital undertook to petition the state court to have the parents' decision overridden and the court decided against it, no different result would obtain under these regulations, that's accurate, Justice."
1985.84-1529,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,890.029,901.504,"Well, you haven's finished your answer to Justice O'Connor, have you?"
1985.84-1529,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,901.504,903.371,I'm sorry.
1985.84-1529,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,907.507,916.18,"Well, have you said all you intend to say about the application of the guidelines in the circumstances we were discussing?"
1985.84-1529,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,916.18,920.565,"Well, not all I intend to say, Justice O'Connor."
1985.84-1529,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1068.579,1076.667,"Well, as a practical matter, what is likely to happen if the regulations are upheld?"
1985.84-1529,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,1104.585,1107.27,"--Yes, Justice O'Connor."
1985.84-1529,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1107.27,1121.196,"And if the Government thinks there is not a valid reason for refusing the treatment, the Government would think that the hospital would have to refer the case to the state child abuse agency?"
1985.84-1529,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,1121.196,1142.36,"That would be the analysis that would follow, although what the Government is looking for is now whether there's been a valid reason so much as whether or not it appears that the reason is handicap, the existence of the handicap, because that is the prohibited criterion under 504."
1985.84-1529,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1152.684,1159.904,"Well, what if the hospital just made a blanket practice of referring all such cases to the appropriate state agency?"
1985.84-1529,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,1159.904,1165.892,--Then there would be no violation of 504 because they would--
1985.84-1529,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1165.892,1171.062,Regardless of whether the state agency wants to take any action on the situation?
1985.84-1529,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,1171.062,1171.562,"--Well, that--"
1985.84-1529,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1171.562,1175.431,"That's the end of it as far as the Federal Government is concerned, is that right?"
1985.84-1529,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,1175.431,1215.658,"--Not necessarily, Justice O'Connor, because the state child protective agencies in all 50 states are also recipients of federal financial assistance, and if they make a decision with respect to their operations in their covered programs that is based on the handicap of the child, as opposed to whether or not the handicap affects and makes contraindicated in a bona fide medical judgment the treatment that the child allegedly needs, if the child protective agency makes that decision, it too would violate Section 504."
1985.84-1529,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1215.658,1221.479,"Mr. Cooper, the truth is that the Federal Government is just taking over the state's function."
1985.84-1529,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,1221.479,1225.614,"No, sir, Justice Marshall, with respect."
1985.84-1529,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1225.614,1227.483,Explain to me why I'm wrong.
1985.84-1529,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,1227.483,1239.206,These regulations are carefully tailored to respect to the maximum extent possible the roles of the states in this area.
1985.84-1529,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1269.393,1271.328,"Mr. Cooper, may I interrupt."
1985.84-1529,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,1288.956,1302.697,"--I think that they could not yield to the parents' decision in that context, Justice Stevens, no more than a decision by a parent sending a child to a federally funded educational program can--"
1985.84-1529,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1302.697,1306.001,You say that they couldn't yield to the parents' decision?
1985.84-1529,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,1313.088,1321.844,"--Well, under those circumstances, the same thing they would do if the parents had decided out of religious compulsion."
1985.84-1529,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1338.187,1344.543,"And suppose that, what if the doctor agrees with the decision of the parents?"
1985.84-1529,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,1347.495,1357.183,I think the hospital would then be... the position of the hospital would be essentially no different.
1985.84-1529,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1366.639,1373.979,"Well, supposing they agree with that, but they have a general hospital policy of never allowing surgery absent parental consent?"
1985.84-1529,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,1375.362,1376.362,I see your point.
1985.84-1529,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1382.016,1386.984,Even if it's valid... even if medical people could disagree on whether it's proper or not?
1985.84-1529,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,1386.984,1388.586,"--Well, that's right."
1985.84-1529,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1425.276,1426.645,"Well, but I'm asking what is the violation of federal law."
1985.84-1529,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,1428.58,1431.615,--There would be no violation of federal law under those circumstances.
1985.84-1529,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1431.615,1439.768,"Well, I thought your position was that the violation was in not reporting it to the state agency."
1985.84-1529,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,1446.039,1448.308,"I don't think so, Justice O'Connor."
1985.84-1529,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1459.599,1466.503,You said that the law in all 50 states requires the hospital to be set up to do that.
1985.84-1529,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,1466.503,1477.478,"--I think that's right, and so therefore I don't think it is possible for a hospital to engage in the kind of policy that has been articulated by Justice Stevens."
1985.84-1529,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1477.478,1482.714,"All right, so it's your position that what the hospital must do is refer it to the child abuse agency."
1985.84-1529,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,1482.714,1486.249,That's right.
1985.84-1529,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1486.249,1494.855,"And otherwise, and if they don't, it's discrimination because in non-handicap situations they must under state law."
1985.84-1529,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,1494.855,1502.092,I don't know of any state law that makes a distinction between whether the child is handicapped or not.
1985.84-1529,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1504.71,1508.412,"And if they treat the handicaps different, your position is that's discrimination?"
1985.84-1529,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,1508.412,1510.031,That's right.
1985.84-1529,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1517.935,1523.755,"Does the record, the administrative record, contain any instances of discriminatory non-reporting of this kind?"
1985.84-1529,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,1523.755,1528.843,"--Oh, yes, Justice Stevens, there are."
1985.84-1529,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1586.197,1594.767,"Well, just to clarify, you say the administrative record contains reference to examples of discriminatory nonreporting of this kind."
1985.84-1529,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,1597.136,1598.838,--I do beg your pardon.
1985.84-1529,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1613.014,1627.088,"I was asking about discriminatory... the focus of the regulations as I understood is to be sure that these cases are properly reported, that they report the handicapped child's case as well as the non-handicapped child's case, the same rule is applied to both."
1985.84-1529,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,1627.088,1627.588,--Yes.
1985.84-1529,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1627.588,1636.879,"And I was asking you if there are examples, and if so how many, of cases in which hospitals have failed to report cases of this kind, but they report cases of other kinds."
1985.84-1529,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,1636.879,1666.732,"There is testimony certainly in that administrative record, comments, as well as a host of studies by professionals in the field themselves which acknowledge the fact that oftentimes situations like this are not reported, that in fact the handicapped... the course of treatment or non-treatment that is agreed upon runs its course and there is no reporting."
1985.84-1529,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1699.536,1701.07,That's not involved here.
1985.84-1529,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,1701.07,1702.405,--Excuse me?
1985.84-1529,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1702.405,1704.222,"That's not involved here, is it?"
1985.84-1529,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,1704.222,1707.024,"Well, the validity of the regulations--"
1985.84-1529,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1707.024,1717.164,"The only thing that's involved here is the right of the Federal Government to move into what for centuries has been a state matter, namely how to operate a hospital."
1985.84-1529,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,1717.164,1750.553,"--Justice Marshall, certainly it is true that until Section 504 was passed there was no foundation whatever for the Federal Government to inquire in any way into these kinds of decisions, except to the extent perhaps that a decision in a state hospital might be unconstitutional, relying on this Court's recent ruling in the Cleveland County case."
1985.84-1529,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1778.655,1789.778,"Under the regulations now, who's going to finally make the decision about whether there's been discrimination against the handicapped?"
1985.84-1529,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,1795.498,1821.565,"In the first instance, Justice White, if the recipient of federal funds finds merit in the Secretary's suggestion that an infant care review committee be assembled and put in place, then that is the first instance where the initial decision is reviewed, and if they disagree with it then it would automatically go to the child protective services agency."
1985.84-1529,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1821.565,1824.601,If who disagrees with what?
1985.84-1529,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,1824.601,1832.171,If the infant care review committee decided that this decision is outside the scope of legitimate medical judgment.
1985.84-1529,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1832.171,1832.521,All right.
1985.84-1529,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,1835.223,1835.807,Then--
1985.84-1529,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1835.807,1837.325,Is that the end of it?
1985.84-1529,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,1837.325,1838.841,--That would be the end of their role.
1985.84-1529,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1838.841,1839.658,All right.
1985.84-1529,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,1846.431,1850.966,"If the review committee disagrees, it would go to the child protective agency."
1985.84-1529,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1850.966,1852.335,And then what happens?
1985.84-1529,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,1852.335,1856.303,And then the decision... the inquiry would be the same there.
1985.84-1529,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1856.303,1856.853,All right.
1985.84-1529,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,1860.154,1878.032,"If they disagree with the parents and the doctor, then presumably they would undertake those state court procedures necessary to override the decision of the parents and the doctor and have the treatment or the nourishment administered to the child."
1985.84-1529,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1878.032,1883.852,"When they go to state court on it, they're applying a federal standard, aren't they?"
1985.84-1529,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,1883.852,1884.485,"No, sir."
1985.84-1529,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1897.293,1913.402,"Except that I thought you said if the state child protective services agency did not employ the standard that the Federal Government thinks is appropriate, the Federal Government would then withhold funds from the child protective services agency."
1985.84-1529,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,1922.241,1923.86,If the Federal Government--
1985.84-1529,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1923.86,1930.264,So there is a federal standard provided that either must be satisfied or funds are withheld?
1985.84-1529,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,1930.264,1936.168,"--The federal standard that governs the conduct of the recipient of federal funds, which is the child protective--"
1985.84-1529,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1936.168,1936.684,Yes.
1985.84-1529,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,1936.684,1937.1,--agency.
1985.84-1529,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1943.004,1945.706,"Yes, but how do you tell about discrimination?"
1985.84-1529,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,1954.11,1957.43,"Justice White, there will be many instances where--"
1985.84-1529,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1957.43,1958.263,Is that right or not?
1985.84-1529,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,1958.263,1962.965,--in order to determine whether a decision--
1985.84-1529,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1962.965,1964.334,"There has been discrimination, yes."
1985.84-1529,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,1964.334,1971.405,"--has been based on an impermissible criterion, you must look at the decision itself, that is certainly true."
1985.84-1529,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1971.405,1983.646,Mr. Epstein.
1985.84-1529,1,39145,richard_l_epstein,,1983.646,1993.854,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1985.84-1529,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2229.822,2242.065,"Well, Mr. Epstein, at least in the Bloomington case, don't you think it's at least possible to say that there was some kind of discrimination on the basis of handicap there?"
1985.84-1529,1,39145,richard_l_epstein,,2242.065,2245.767,--Not under our interpretation of discrimination.
1985.84-1529,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2247.719,2260.543,"But the language of 504 is broad, and it would seem to me you have to come to grips with the fact that the language could be interpreted as the Government suggests."
1985.84-1529,1,39145,richard_l_epstein,,2260.543,2281.541,"--Justice O'Connor, in the case of the Bloomington episode, at worst there may have been what would be a case of medical neglect which is cognizable under the Child Abuse Amendments of 1984, which is their very purpose."
1985.84-1529,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2281.541,2291.812,"But it also could theoretically be discrimination within the meaning of Section 504, viewed in its broad provisions."
1985.84-1529,1,39145,richard_l_epstein,,2291.812,2306.572,"Not, I would suggest, if the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, which is what we contend, does not apply to cases of medical treatment decisionmaking, and that's where 504 is to be found."
1985.84-1529,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2308.424,2322.768,But normally the Court would at least defer to any reasonable interpretation by the administrative agency charged with the enforcement of the statute.
1985.84-1529,1,39145,richard_l_epstein,,2322.768,2375.918,"--If we get into that posture, which could have been the case in Bloomington, and that is where the administrator of the hospital, who was in disagreement with the parents' refusal to provide consent, had after the appointment of the guardian had a different result in the process of moving the matter along, where ultimately it was decided, not by a child abuse agency, but by the courts in Indiana, that the decision that was made on the basis of the record that that court had privy to was one that was reasonable; and so the final decision that was made there was one by the courts."
1985.84-1529,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2400.768,2413.11,"Of course, here we're dealing I suppose with a facial challenge, in effect, to the application of Section 504 to any conceivable situation."
1985.84-1529,1,39145,richard_l_epstein,,2413.11,2427.001,"In the sense that, in the sense that, Section 504 we maintain was promulgated without authority from the Congress, and so in that sense it is a facial challenge."
1985.84-1529,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2435.607,2452.085,And you think that we should not look at the interpretation by the agency charged with its enforcement in helping us know whether the statute is applicable?
1985.84-1529,1,39145,richard_l_epstein,,2452.085,2461.008,"We believe that that interpretation rests with the judiciary, Your Honor, and not with an agency, which may embark on its own--"
1985.84-1529,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2461.008,2467.078,"Well, doesn't the Court normally defer to a reasonable interpretation by the agency?"
1985.84-1529,1,39145,richard_l_epstein,,2467.078,2506.703,"--Not in all circumstances, Your Honor, and certainly not in a situation where an agency has undertaken, as in this case in 1982, on a directive to promulgate a regulation to regulate medical treatment to severely ill newborns, and reached out for some kind of statutory nexus on which to allegedly hang that claimed authority, and used Section 504 in the process."
1985.84-1529,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2701.53,2715.39,"Is your submission that these regulations may not validly apply to any handicapped person, any medical decision to treat a handicapped person, whether it's baby or not?"
1985.84-1529,1,39145,richard_l_epstein,,2715.39,2722.528,The regulations endeavor to apply to severely ill newborns.
1985.84-1529,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2742.607,2750.797,But you wouldn't think that the medical treatment of just any handicapped person is beyond the reach of the Act?
1985.84-1529,1,39145,richard_l_epstein,,2750.797,2755.182,"Beyond the reach of which Act, Your Honor?"
1985.84-1529,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2755.182,2757.867,"Well, the Act that Title 4 was passed under."
1985.84-1529,1,39145,richard_l_epstein,,2757.867,2772.627,"There are protections for persons in the regulatory scheme under the Act, for persons to have access to hospitals, to health services, to care."
1985.84-1529,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2789.487,2789.787,So you would say that it wouldn't make any difference.
1985.84-1529,1,39145,richard_l_epstein,,2794.79,2795.54,That is correct.
1985.84-1529,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2844.723,2852.679,Mr. Heineman.
1985.84-1529,2,17741,ben_w_heineman_jr,,2852.679,2855.281,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1985.84-1529,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2982.38,3011.464,"Well, Mr. Heineman, it does strike me that the Respondents in this case just aren't coming to grips with what might be of real concern to us, and that is the breadth of the language, the fact that there's nothing in the legislative history that expressly says Congress did not intend to cover this area, and the fact that we normally defer to the administrative agency's interpretation."
1985.84-1529,2,17741,ben_w_heineman_jr,,3031.592,3036.345,"There are substantial reasons not to defer to the agency in this case, Justice O'Connor."
1985.84-1529,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3136.928,3144.015,"Well, the Government says it has cited studies that are supportive of its concern in this area."
1985.84-1529,2,17741,ben_w_heineman_jr,,3162.428,3163.012,"--Yes, yes."
1985.84-1529,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3257.974,3266.413,"Mr. Cooper indicated that the administrative record shows that there was a substantial problem of non-reporting of cases in this category, as opposed to other cases."
1985.84-1529,2,17741,ben_w_heineman_jr,,3267.196,3268.113,--I disagree with that.
1985.84-1529,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3327.32,3328.003,So what's your bottom line?
1985.84-1529,2,17741,ben_w_heineman_jr,,3330.772,3334.14,"I'm saying that there should be no deference, for a variety of reasons."
1985.84-1529,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3334.14,3336.259,Let's assume there shouldn't be any deference.
1985.84-1529,2,17741,ben_w_heineman_jr,,3342.746,3351.952,"Yes, Again, Justice White, the final judgment here goes to three kinds of decisions: parents, but basically they have conceded that parents are not federal fund recipients."
1985.84-1529,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3351.952,3352.719,I understand that.
1985.84-1529,2,17741,ben_w_heineman_jr,,3352.719,3355.071,And then provider decisions when parents do consent.
1985.84-1529,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3365.526,3370.063,You still have to conclude that Congress just flatly didn't intend to reach that.
1985.84-1529,2,17741,ben_w_heineman_jr,,3370.063,3370.613,--That's correct.
1985.84-1529,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3373.765,3383.573,"But there's no evidence in the statute, the legislative history, that affirmatively says Congress did not intend to reach that, is there?"
1985.84-1529,2,17741,ben_w_heineman_jr,,3383.573,3385.373,"--No, that is correct."
1985.84-1529,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3385.373,3388.025,There's just an absence of a focus on it.
1985.84-1529,2,17741,ben_w_heineman_jr,,3393.179,3411.824,"Well, I think it is an easy case if we take the proper steps, in this sense, that when 504 was enacted in 1973 it was aimed at employment and education, and that there was... Congress made detailed findings that there was handicap problems in those areas in the states."
1985.84-1529,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3442.861,3446.913,"Well, that may be a good question for Congress."
1985.84-1529,2,17741,ben_w_heineman_jr,,3457.955,3462.407,"--No, I believe that what I have to do is say that the law does not authorize it clearly, to be sure."
1985.84-1529,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3473.898,3482.403,"Well, you do have, just by way of silence, to narrow the reach of the language that forbids discrimination against the handicapped."
1985.84-1529,2,17741,ben_w_heineman_jr,,3482.403,3484.022,Correct.
1985.84-1529,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3484.022,3485.872,Isn't that right?
1985.84-1529,2,17741,ben_w_heineman_jr,,3485.872,3494.478,"Yes, and the legislative history narrows it by indicating that when they were talking about health services they were only talking about access to health facilities."
1985.84-1529,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3523.413,3535.637,"Before you move to those, I'm not entirely clear what your position is where the physicians think treatment is desirable, if not indeed imperative, and the parents flatly refuse?"
1985.84-1529,2,17741,ben_w_heineman_jr,,3535.637,3549.295,"The only duty of the physician in those circumstances under state law is to report the parents to the state child abuse and neglect agency for possibly being guilty of medical neglect, medical neglect meaning--"
1985.84-1529,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3549.295,3554.933,Your position is that under Section 504 the Federal Government has no right to intervene there either?
1985.84-1529,2,17741,ben_w_heineman_jr,,3554.933,3555.633,--That is correct.
1985.84-1529,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3609.066,3628.794,"Well, what if the hospital and the medical treatment personnel just took the position that in every case of a newborn with Down Syndrome they're not going to under any circumstances refer a refusal to treat to a child protective services agency?"
1985.84-1529,2,17741,ben_w_heineman_jr,,3636.317,3638.085,--If it was a general policy--
1985.84-1529,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3638.085,3638.735,Yes.
1985.84-1529,2,17741,ben_w_heineman_jr,,3640.519,3649.525,"--Yes, Again, I have a hard time assuming it since physicians and parents are basically in the business of helping children, not trying not to help them."
1985.84-1529,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3664.487,3665.337,"Well, we have a facial challenge here."
1985.84-1529,2,17741,ben_w_heineman_jr,,3670.354,3670.721,Right.
1985.84-1529,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3687.316,3691.434,I thought the judgment below was that 504 just didn't authorize any of--
1985.84-1529,2,17741,ben_w_heineman_jr,,3691.434,3697.271,Investigation and regulation of individual treatment decisions relating to the severely impaired newborns.
1985.84-1529,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3697.271,3702.409,"--At least that's the way you interpret the decision below, and that's all you're defending?"
1985.84-1529,2,17741,ben_w_heineman_jr,,3702.409,3704.444,"Right, individual treatment decisions."
1985.84-1529,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3704.444,3705.744,And if it's any broader than that you don't defend it?
1985.84-1529,2,17741,ben_w_heineman_jr,,3705.744,3711.765,"Well, I would be... yes, I would be prepared to defend it, but that is not what we believe the judgment below is about."
1985.84-1529,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3711.765,3713.715,"Thank you, gentlemen."
