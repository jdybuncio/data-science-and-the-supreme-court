2005.04-1371,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,8.022,"We'll hear argument next in number 04-1371, Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith versus Dabit."
2005.04-1371,0,31339,jay_b_kasner,,9.498,11.683,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
2005.04-1371,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,234.911,237.539,May I just ask you this question about the plain language?
2005.04-1371,0,31339,jay_b_kasner,,250.999,256.505,"--Justice Stevens, if, by ""his or her"", it's referencing ""any private party"", I would agree with that."
2005.04-1371,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,257.276,262.32,"So, the question is whether we should construe the word ""the"" to be the functional equivalent of ""his or her""."
2005.04-1371,0,31339,jay_b_kasner,,262.32,264.214,"--In essence, Justice Stevens--"
2005.04-1371,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,264.214,265.248,Is that true?
2005.04-1371,0,31339,jay_b_kasner,,265.248,265.559,--that's correct.
2005.04-1371,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,289.61,299.358,"Mr. Kasner, the... does the Securities and Exchange Commission have enforcement authority in this... in this area?"
2005.04-1371,0,31339,jay_b_kasner,,299.358,300.863,"It does, Justice Scalia."
2005.04-1371,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,300.863,305.706,Have they issued any rules or regulations on this... on this point?
2005.04-1371,0,31339,jay_b_kasner,,305.706,308.225,"The point being, Your Honor, whether--"
2005.04-1371,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,308.225,315.637,"On the point that you're arguing, whether the critical language means the person's own sale, or not--"
2005.04-1371,0,31339,jay_b_kasner,,315.637,316.589,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2005.04-1371,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,337.312,343.029,--Is it your position that we owe deference to the interpretation of the SEC?
2005.04-1371,0,31339,jay_b_kasner,,343.029,344.481,"That is our position, Your Honor."
2005.04-1371,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,360.349,361.874,"Well, if it's just Skidmore, forget about it."
2005.04-1371,0,31339,jay_b_kasner,,362.834,376.505,"--Well, Your Honor, I actually carefully studied yesterday's opinion, where this Court discussed the Skidmore deference, and, either way, we think that this is... the statute is so clear that, deference or none, there really is no other way to read the language of the statute."
2005.04-1371,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,450.709,467.359,"Mr. Kasner, may I just interrupt those references to ask you... one could agree that, for SEC enforcement purposes, for prosecutorial purposes, the ""in connection with"" is as broad as you suggest."
2005.04-1371,0,31339,jay_b_kasner,,493.195,504.751,"--Justice Ginsburg, I believe that this Court has answered Your Honor's question in the Blue Chip Stamp case, where it specifically rejected that sort of an approach, and one that was consistent with the court below."
2005.04-1371,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,592.955,595.153,Would you explain that rule of lenity?
2005.04-1371,0,31339,jay_b_kasner,,608.272,628.954,"--Your Honor, we... and we have cited authority, including the Leocal decision of this Court, last year, in which, for statutory construction purposes, where you have a civil and a criminal statute that has both elements to it, the rule of lenity would dictate that the narrower reading be the one that is written."
2005.04-1371,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,673.616,679.242,"But one reason you might want to adopt a narrower reading, though, is, we're dealing here with the preemption provision."
2005.04-1371,0,31339,jay_b_kasner,,692.212,701.259,"--Mr. Chief Justice, I think, in this case, there is no other purpose to be served by this statute than to preempt."
2005.04-1371,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,723.315,730.506,"But there's a lot of... I think our cases establish that a phrase like ""in connection with"" carries with it a lot of ambiguity."
2005.04-1371,0,31339,jay_b_kasner,,757.135,776.585,"--Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I would agree with you that, in terms of deciding, for... as a substantive matter, for purposes of 10(b)(5), SEC versus Zandford, how far the outer reaches of the ""in connection with"" language go may well be susceptible of differences of opinion."
2005.04-1371,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,808.449,812.904,"No, but that's a normal reading of the word, so that you... when you say a purchase or... it normally would be"
2005.04-1371,0,31339,jay_b_kasner,,832.211,846.072,"--Justice Stevens, one misimpression I believe that the court below was under, and I believe is perpetuated by Respondent in his amici, this statute does not preempt a State law claim."
2005.04-1371,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,849.231,850.185,It just preempts class actions.
2005.04-1371,0,31339,jay_b_kasner,,850.185,851.649,--It preempts class actions.
2005.04-1371,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,882.74,891.725,"In going through that legislative history, did you find any evidence that they intended to preempt any State law claims that were not... did not have a parallel Federal claim?"
2005.04-1371,0,31339,jay_b_kasner,,891.725,893.721,"--Justice Stevens, the--"
2005.04-1371,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,893.721,894.963,Other than the language of the statute?
2005.04-1371,0,31339,jay_b_kasner,,894.963,896.505,"--Well, we believe that the--"
2005.04-1371,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,896.505,896.618,Yes.
2005.04-1371,0,31339,jay_b_kasner,,896.618,897.248,--this inquiry--
2005.04-1371,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,897.248,897.389,But you--
2005.04-1371,0,31339,jay_b_kasner,,897.389,897.639,--begins and ends--
2005.04-1371,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,897.639,899.153,--you brought up the legislative history.
2005.04-1371,0,31339,jay_b_kasner,,899.153,899.363,--Yes.
2005.04-1371,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,899.363,900.364,"So, you're an expert on that subject."
2005.04-1371,0,31339,jay_b_kasner,,901.508,911.689,"Your... Justice Stevens, the only reference to the purchaser or seller issue is one that is referenced by the Respondent."
2005.04-1371,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,979.34,980.121,May I interrupt?
2005.04-1371,0,31339,jay_b_kasner,,980.562,981.153,--Yes.
2005.04-1371,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,981.153,982.475,--your time is running out.
2005.04-1371,0,31339,jay_b_kasner,,982.475,983.128,Yes.
2005.04-1371,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,983.128,993.117,"Is my understanding correct that, on your reading, State class actions of less than 50 parties are also left unpreempted?"
2005.04-1371,0,31339,jay_b_kasner,,993.117,995.354,"Justice Souter, the definition... yes."
2005.04-1371,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,995.725,996.065,Okay.
2005.04-1371,0,31339,jay_b_kasner,,996.065,996.255,"--your question is, yes."
2005.04-1371,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,996.255,996.445,So--
2005.04-1371,0,31339,jay_b_kasner,,996.445,996.636,The definition--
2005.04-1371,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,996.636,999.151,--individual actions and small State class actions.
2005.04-1371,0,31339,jay_b_kasner,,999.151,1004.245,"--Individual actions, less than 50 people, arbitrations, public enforcement."
2005.04-1371,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1007.345,1009.15,"Thank you, Mr. Kasner."
2005.04-1371,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1018.558,1023.05,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
2005.04-1371,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1044.683,1046.51,"Mr. Hungar, I just wonder if that's correct."
2005.04-1371,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1052.327,1054.503,"--I think that's correct, Justice Stevens, but--"
2005.04-1371,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1054.503,1057.911,"Well, then you don't have to have differing interpretations of ""in connection with""."
2005.04-1371,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1059.876,1077.709,"--Well, the Mr. Kasner indicated, that issue has been dispositively resolved by this Court and the Commission in concluding that the purchaser/seller rule is not a limitation on the scope of the prohibition in section 10(b)."
2005.04-1371,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1081.369,1083.066,"I always thought ""the"" meant ""the""."
2005.04-1371,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1084.579,1084.95,"Certainly, that would be our submission."
2005.04-1371,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1084.95,1086.944,"And ""his or her"" means ""his or her""."
2005.04-1371,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1086.944,1087.988,"Yes, Your Honor."
2005.04-1371,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1088.509,1088.859,"No, but you--"
2005.04-1371,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1088.859,1089.17,--if it--
2005.04-1371,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1089.17,1089.791,"--think it means ""any""."
2005.04-1371,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1089.791,1090.724,--I'm sorry?
2005.04-1371,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1090.724,1094.053,"You think it means ""any"", right?"
2005.04-1371,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1095.788,1098.666,"Right, it's ""the""... well, it's ""the"", in the sense of"
2005.04-1371,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1132.878,1135.557,"Well, it certainly doesn't require the Commission to be a purchaser or seller, either."
2005.04-1371,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1136.107,1137.621,"--Well, we certainly would agree with that, Your Honor, that--"
2005.04-1371,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1137.621,1138.725,--Yes.
2005.04-1371,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1138.725,1147.792,"--But, more generally, it doesn't require that there be a purchaser or seller who's defrauded, and yet the purchaser/seller rule, for the purpose of implied actions, does require that."
2005.04-1371,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1176.004,1176.314,Right.
2005.04-1371,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1176.314,1181.732,"--scienter requirements for... and, of course, the claims that would not satisfy the requirements of the PSLRA."
2005.04-1371,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1186.645,1190.074,"No, but they would be at... adjudged under a different standard, you're dead right."
2005.04-1371,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1194.314,1205.569,"Well, in cases where the... where the only claim is against aiders and abetters, those parties would be... would be out of court; or, likewise, cases where parties could not satisfy the scienter requirement, those parties would be out of court."
2005.04-1371,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1214.095,1214.806,What about the--
2005.04-1371,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1214.806,1215.066,Congress was--
2005.04-1371,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1215.066,1220.42,"--the claim that's made here, the second claim, where the broker said,"
2005.04-1371,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1234.033,1235.307,--Your--
2005.04-1371,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1235.307,1235.598,--just that
2005.04-1371,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1239.277,1242.636,"--Your Honor, the... that issue is not before this Court--"
2005.04-1371,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1242.636,1243.237,"I know, but I--"
2005.04-1371,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1243.237,1243.559,--because it was not--
2005.04-1371,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1243.559,1246.548,--wanted to know what the Government's position was on that claim.
2005.04-1371,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1250.079,1250.68,--The--
2005.04-1371,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1250.68,1251.721,--even as a class action?
2005.04-1371,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1251.721,1273.629,"--The Commission addressed that question in its amicus brief in the Court of Appeals, and took the position that that claim was not in connection with the purchase or sale of securities, because the injury occurs after the fraud has been completed, and is... and has to do with the lost future relationship, rather than fraud in connection with the purchase or sale of securities."
2005.04-1371,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1282.745,1293.177,How do you deal with the Court's... the footnote in the Blue Chip Stamps... that the court says... in the Federal court...
2005.04-1371,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1326.396,1344.822,"Your Honor, that was an accurate description of the state of the law, as it existed at the time, at least in theory, although, as a practical matter, Respondents have not been able to point to a single reported case a... of a holder class action in State court prior to the adoption of the Uniform Standards Act."
2005.04-1371,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1523.99,1525.786,"Thank you, Mr. Hungar."
2005.04-1371,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,1527.471,1536.799,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
2005.04-1371,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1577.06,1584.682,"Can you tell me, do you agree that a holder action falls with 10(b)(5), generally?"
2005.04-1371,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,1584.682,1595.384,"--No, because this Court, in the Blue Chip Stamps case, said that it did not."
2005.04-1371,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1598.202,1600.429,But what about enforcement actions taken by the--
2005.04-1371,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,1600.429,1601.823,--In enforcement--
2005.04-1371,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1601.823,1602.114,--SEC?
2005.04-1371,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,1602.114,1609.435,"--actions, the SEC can bring enforcement authority, pursuant to 10(b)(5)."
2005.04-1371,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1619.113,1619.503,"But then, the--"
2005.04-1371,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,1619.503,1619.743,--jurisdiction.
2005.04-1371,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1619.743,1625.36,"--then it does fall within... holder actions do fall within 10(b)(5), for some purposes."
2005.04-1371,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,1625.36,1631.637,"They do, for enforcement purposes; they do not, for private civil action purposes."
2005.04-1371,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1631.637,1635.108,"So, you want us to interpret the text two ways, depending on the purpose."
2005.04-1371,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,1635.108,1635.498,No.
2005.04-1371,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1725.339,1727.274,"The Government doesn't say that ""all"" are covered."
2005.04-1371,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,1732.257,1743.462,"The point, though, Justice Scalia, is that what Congress, in the PSLRA, was doing was attempting to ratchet up the pleading requirements for Federal law claims."
2005.04-1371,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1743.462,1745.166,It's so... it's so counterintuitive.
2005.04-1371,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,1756.116,1756.366,Absolutely--
2005.04-1371,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1756.366,1756.737,And why--
2005.04-1371,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,1756.737,1756.957,--not.
2005.04-1371,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1756.957,1765.139,"--why the Government would want to police the one, and let the other, you know, proliferate, seems very strange to me."
2005.04-1371,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,1765.139,1767.444,"That's not correct, Justice Scalia."
2005.04-1371,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1811.104,1811.595,But the--
2005.04-1371,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,1835.282,1838.213,"--In most circumstance, that's correct, Mr. Chief Justice."
2005.04-1371,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1861.923,1864.551,But what your clients want to do is cash in on the fraud.
2005.04-1371,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,1878.765,1884.891,--That's the same kind of claim that in... to get back to Justice Scalia's question... arises in the purchaser/seller context.
2005.04-1371,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1903.086,1903.898,In that--
2005.04-1371,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,1903.898,1904.148,In--
2005.04-1371,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1904.148,1917.801,"--in... suppose a person bought the stock at price 30 before any fraud took place, and then he holds it, and then the fraud, and then, subsequently, the word of the fraud gets out, the price falls a lot, and he sells it."

2005.04-1371,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2890.188,2893.867,--but Blue Chip did not adopt the rationale of the Birnbaum case.
2005.04-1371,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2893.867,2898.097,"Well, I think it... it did adopt the rule, though, as a basis of the wording."
2005.04-1371,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2931.845,2942.907,"Mr. Frederick, it seems to me that the language ""in connection with"", you know, whether it means what Blue Chip meant or whether it means what the statute meant, is at least ambiguous."
2005.04-1371,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2953.91,2963.238,"This statute is a... about private civil actions, and it doesn't affect the SEC's enforcement authority or any action."
2005.04-1371,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2974.542,2975.253,--The--
2005.04-1371,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2975.253,2975.664,"So, the SEC--"
2005.04-1371,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2975.664,2986.847,"--Have we not given any weight to SEC determinations, as to its interpretation, where civil actions are involved?"
2005.04-1371,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2988.27,2993.548,"--This is an act, Justice Scalia, where the SEC's enforcement authority isn't affected one jot."
2005.04-1371,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3005.573,3005.954,Yes.
2005.04-1371,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,3005.954,3006.815,--that's addressed to private--
2005.04-1371,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3006.815,3007.118,Do you know--
2005.04-1371,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,3007.118,3007.609,--civil litigation.
2005.04-1371,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3007.609,3009.874,--whether the SEC filed an amicus brief in Blue Chip?
2005.04-1371,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,3009.874,3011.671,Yes.
2005.04-1371,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3021.77,3024.378,"It took the position that the Seventh Circuit took in Eason, didn't it?"
2005.04-1371,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,3024.378,3025.359,That's correct.
2005.04-1371,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3025.359,3026.173,Yes.
2005.04-1371,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,3027.887,3041.698,"But the Court, there, I don't think was... it said that it was not in... giving any deference to the SEC's position, because it was an implied private right of action that this Court had recognized, and that the lower courts had recognized."
2005.04-1371,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3041.698,3044.968,Before you finish... there's two questions I would like to ask him.
2005.04-1371,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,3063.917,3070.764,"Well, there are class actions that concern breaches of fiduciary duty, negligence."
2005.04-1371,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3122.387,3122.668,You--
2005.04-1371,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,3122.668,3155.818,"--one of the strange things about this case and the SEC's position is that District Courts are going to be put in the rather unusual position of paying a rather high cost, because if they are confronted with a removal of a case brought under State law, where the defendant asserts that it is preempted under SLUSA, and the SEC hasn't taken any action at all, and has expressed no interest in this particular area, the District Court, to determine preemption, has to intuit whether or not this is within the SEC's enforcement authority."
2005.04-1371,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3250.061,3263.691,"I agree with that presumption against preemption, where the question is, Does this Federal statute, which says nothing about preemption, accidentally preempt some State law +/?"
2005.04-1371,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,3277.232,3279.957,But it's preemption to rechannel.
2005.04-1371,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3302.045,3305.123,"Mr. Frederick, I want to be sure of one question."
2005.04-1371,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,3314.343,3320.632,"Well, it depends on how the courts would construe the SLUSA cases as affecting the"
2005.04-1371,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3337.702,3337.992,Certainly.
2005.04-1371,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,3337.992,3348.091,"Anytime a court is construing that language, in the SLUSA context, it would necessarily have a collateral impact on the SEC's enforcement authority in 10(b)."
2005.04-1371,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3348.091,3350.486,"Yes, but the SEC could relitigate it, I would think."
2005.04-1371,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,3353.785,3356.763,It could certainly relitigate it.

2005.04-1371,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,3368.506,3368.806,Thank you.
2005.04-1371,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3368.806,3370.884,"Mr. Kasner, you have 3 minutes remaining."
2005.04-1371,3,31339,jay_b_kasner,,3370.884,3378.478,Counsel referred to the findings in the legislation.
2005.04-1371,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3567.365,3570.483,It's surprising that the holder claims didn't respond to Blue Chip.
2005.04-1371,3,31339,jay_b_kasner,,3578.367,3578.928,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2005.04-1371,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3578.928,3579.739,Yes.
