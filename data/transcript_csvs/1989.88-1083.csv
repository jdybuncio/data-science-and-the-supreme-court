1989.88-1083,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,12.25,18.066,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.88-1083,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,49.586,57.002,"Mr. Kneedler, do you know anything about how the parties all got this John Doe denomination in the District Court?"
1989.88-1083,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,57.002,74.236,"There was the proceeding... the Court of Appeals granted a motion for the proceedings on appeal to proceed under seal, and as a result of that, the... the... we have... we have continued to comply with the, with the requirement that the agencies be referred to as John Doe Agency and John Doe Government Agency."
1989.88-1083,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,82.353,83.445,The Court of Appeals directed--
1989.88-1083,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,83.445,83.595,Right.
1989.88-1083,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,83.595,85.605,--that everybody be designated as a John Doe?
1989.88-1083,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,85.605,90.708,"or... or... under seal... under seal, so that... at least with the names under seal, so that the public would not know."
1989.88-1083,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,90.708,91.88,Thank you.
1989.88-1083,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,91.88,111.151,"As I have said, the Court has repeatedly recognized the importance of these law enforcement interests, and after Abramson was decided, Congress in fact built upon Abramson and expanded the coverage of Exemption 7, to ensure that law enforcement information would be protected irrespective of the format in which it was collected."
1989.88-1083,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,139.993,152.071,"Mr. Kneedler, at the time the request was made here, had the documents in your view been compiled or were they compiled after the request was made?"
1989.88-1083,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,152.071,162.78,"--The documents were compiled after the request was made, but in our view they were... they were compiled... compiled for law enforcement purposes; they were compiled for law enforcement purposes before the request was denied."
1989.88-1083,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,208.904,211.205,What constituted the compilation?
1989.88-1083,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,211.205,233.558,"I... I think... I think most... in the sense that the statute uses the term compilation, I think that once the, the Department of Justice, in this... in the course of this consultation said yes, indeed, these documents are relevant to our investigation, we want them, and don't disclose them, we think at that point the records were, were gathered together or incorporated--"
1989.88-1083,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,233.558,240.433,"The request by the agency to withhold them constitutes a compilation, in your view?"
1989.88-1083,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,240.433,242.995,"--Well, there are several senses in which they could be."
1989.88-1083,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,244.978,247.699,Is that what you are asking us to adopt as the rule?
1989.88-1083,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,247.699,247.869,--Yes.
1989.88-1083,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,260.767,266.872,"Well, one could take the position that you have to physically assemble the documents somehow, I suppose?"
1989.88-1083,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,266.872,270.565,"Or, or gather them, take, take them together."
1989.88-1083,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,283.955,285.325,"Well, depending upon the timing."
1989.88-1083,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,292.16,298.886,"--I, I don't think that... I don't think that construction would be... would fit with the sense of the statute."
1989.88-1083,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,307.851,310.205,"When do you say, Mr. Kneedler, they were compiled?"
1989.88-1083,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,310.205,311.794,"--Excuse me, when?"
1989.88-1083,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,311.794,312.275,When?
1989.88-1083,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,312.275,312.756,When.
1989.88-1083,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,329.02,330.761,"Well, the second is the FBI, is that it?"
1989.88-1083,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,330.761,332.591,"Uh, yes."
1989.88-1083,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,333.393,335.145,And the first is DCAA?
1989.88-1083,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,335.145,337.939,"Uh yes, that is... yes."
1989.88-1083,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,337.939,340.07,Were they ever compiled by DCAA?
1989.88-1083,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,340.07,341.43,Yes.
1989.88-1083,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,362.913,366.726,"At that point, before the transfer of the documents to the FBI?"
1989.88-1083,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,366.726,366.846,--Yes.
1989.88-1083,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,393.796,399.09,"Under your approach, though, don't we run into something of an ante litem motem problem?"
1989.88-1083,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,404.984,414.051,"Well, as... as long as, as long as the documents become protected at any period of time, the... the exemption applies."
1989.88-1083,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,457.921,462.836,"Mr. Kneedler, why was the transfer to the FBI so promptly made?"
1989.88-1083,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,462.836,470.84,"Because they... because, to, to bring them promptly within the control of the FBI because they were relevant to the ongoing investigation."
1989.88-1083,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,528.688,530.01,That is why I asked... that is why I asked the question.
1989.88-1083,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,530.01,536.973,"--Well... but there's no suggestion that this was done to, to avoid complying with the FOIA request."
1989.88-1083,1,35747,milton_eisenberg,,1571.68,1590.673,"Your Honor, we, the corporation, requested that the records be sealed after an affidavit was filed by the Assistant United States Attorney which... a public affidavit in the FOIA case, which disclosed for the first time, by name, the subject of a grand jury investigation."
1989.88-1083,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1622.156,1623.865,"Well, how about the name of your client?"
1989.88-1083,1,35747,milton_eisenberg,,1623.865,1639.335,"--We do... we do not, since the government has also just volunteered that the grand jury investigation is continuing, we do not believe that the client's... the subject of the investigation's name should be identified in the caption or in--"
1989.88-1083,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1639.335,1645.889,"You don't think litigation in federal courts under FOIA is a matter of, of public... public notice?"
1989.88-1083,1,35747,milton_eisenberg,,1645.889,1658.89,"--Your Honor, I don't want to make an issue of this because, in fact, this is a public corporation which has disclosed in numerous SEC filings all of the details with respect to this investigation of which it is aware."
1989.88-1083,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1696.263,1697.325,Thank you.
1989.88-1083,1,35747,milton_eisenberg,,1701.316,1706.619,"Your Honor, we... the, the name of the company has been disclosed in the media."
1989.88-1083,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3329.084,3331.175,"I do, Mr. Chief Justice."
1989.88-1083,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3331.175,3332.166,You have four minutes.
1989.88-1083,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3332.166,3332.807,Thank you.
1989.88-1083,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3470.671,3477.545,"Mr. Kneedler, if you read it that broadly really... your reading is that records or information in the possession of a law enforcement agency if it meets any other--"
1989.88-1083,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3477.545,3484.598,"--No, it has... it has... it has to be focused on a particular, under, under 7(a) it would have to be focused on a particular law enforcement proceeding or investigation."
1989.88-1083,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3484.598,3491.764,"--I understand, but as long as it is in the possession of an agency and meets some... any of the six other requirements, you would say it had been compiled."
1989.88-1083,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3491.764,3495.407,"It, it would have to be... it would have to be in the possession for law enforcement purposes."
1989.88-1083,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3495.407,3496.757,"Well, I understand."
1989.88-1083,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3496.757,3500.08,"In other words, in, in DCAA they would have a lot of information but once it becomes refocused--"
1989.88-1083,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3500.08,3502.28,"Right, but compiled means in possession of, I think in your, your definition?"
1989.88-1083,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3502.28,3506.834,"--No, it doesn't... well, compiled, compiled, compiled means--"
1989.88-1083,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3506.834,3513.787,"In your view, could anything in the possession of the agency for law enforcement purposes that meets these requirements not be compiled within the meaning of the statute?"
1989.88-1083,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3513.787,3523.884,"--No, there... there, there also has to be an affirmative designation or selection of the document, or listing, identification of the document as germane to the law enforcement investigation."
1989.88-1083,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3535.283,3551.436,"So under your theory, an agency could issue, the FBI could issue a notice to all agencies in the government saying X corporation is under investigation, we are interested in what kind of... what kind of... FOIA documents this corporation is trying to get in, in anticipating defense of this suit."
1989.88-1083,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3559.062,3566.946,"No, it... it... it's... first of all, a court may be able to examine those facts and see whether it is sufficiently relevant to a concrete, focused investigation."
1989.88-1083,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3576.693,3578.686,"Thank you, Mr. Kneedler."
