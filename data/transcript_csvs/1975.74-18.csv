1975.74-18,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,35.743,"We will hear arguments next in 74-18, Fisher against the United States and 611, United States against Kasmir and others."
1975.74-18,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,44.365,48.023,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1975.74-18,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,570.353,576.192,You are talking now simply about a subpoena to produce a non-testimony in connection with --
1975.74-18,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,576.192,580.68,"That is correct, in resisting a subpoena to produce the papers."
1975.74-18,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,674.05,684.265,"Mr. Wallace, do you think the accountant would be entitled to a return of those papers if he made a demand for them?"
1975.74-18,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,684.265,689.841,"Well, we think that is the law of the States involved, yes, Mr. Justice."
1975.74-18,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,689.841,691.789,That is your position that --
1975.74-18,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,691.789,698.77,That the accountant does have a superior proprietary claim if he should choose to assert it.
1975.74-18,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,888.835,889.366,Does it make any --
1975.74-18,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,889.366,890.643,It changes the function.
1975.74-18,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,890.643,899.654,Does it make any difference if the accountant?s work papers were based on the taxpayer?s own personal records?
1975.74-18,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,899.654,911.903,"We do not believe so, Your Honor because this is not a privileged communication between the taxpayer and the accountant as the Court recognized in Couch."
1975.74-18,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,942.898,950.884,"Wallace, let us assume for the moment that the only records involved were taxpayer?s records."
1975.74-18,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,969.32,977.784,"Well, I doubt that we will have a finding in these cases then that the records belong to the accountant."
1975.74-18,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1020.084,1050.871,"If the accountant has done nothing, but tabulated statistical data, without any analysis, so that the accountant?s yellow pad notes for example are nothing more than an addition perhaps of check stubs, would the mere transposition from the taxpayer?s document to the yellow pad of the accountant be controlling --"
1975.74-18,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1050.871,1051.409,We think it is --
1975.74-18,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1051.409,1055.484,-- without any analysis of creative work by the tax -- by the accountant?
1975.74-18,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1055.484,1069.897,"I would -- I would answer that yes, Mr. Justice, just as the accountant could be put on the stand and required to testify from his memory of what figures were disclosed to him."
1975.74-18,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1069.897,1071.681,"Would you say that, Mr. Wallace?"
1975.74-18,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1071.681,1078.436,"If he could remember them, if you had an accountant with a photographic memory, he might certainly remember some totals, which might --"
1975.74-18,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1078.436,1092.886,"Just suppose -- well, suppose it was a diary of the taxpayer, in which he recorded all his gambling and other illegal transactions, and that is what it was from which the accountant worked on his yellow pad?"
1975.74-18,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1092.886,1096.945,"Well, any record that the accountant has made even if it reflects illegal --"
1975.74-18,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1096.945,1102.101,No matter how incriminating the taxpayer?s own document maybe?
1975.74-18,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1102.101,1118.86,"If the taxpayer has chosen to disclose this information in a non-privileged communication, I do not see any basis for resisting the testimony of the person to whom it was disclosed in whatever form and that person can call upon his own record --"
1975.74-18,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1118.86,1124.98,If as if he has written a letter or the accountant (Inaudible) called him on telephone?
1975.74-18,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1124.98,1130.105,I think all of those cases are the same for purposes of the privilege and the policies underlying the privilege --
1975.74-18,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1130.105,1137.084,"Would you regard it as any different because the letter was written to the lawyer, or the diary was given to the lawyer?"
1975.74-18,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1137.084,1156.114,"We would not, Your Honor and we do not believe that in anticipation of legal process, documentary evidence of this sort can be gathered up whether by purchase or by persuasion or any other way and immunize the proper legal process."
1975.74-18,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1170.9,1173.554,May I just get back to that question for a moment Mr. Wallace?
1975.74-18,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1183.003,1187.012,"Well, there-there be a question of attorney-client privilege --"
1975.74-18,1,39336,robert_e_goodfriend,,1575.921,1579.713,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1975.74-18,2,38807,richard_l_bazelon,,2582.38,2585.478,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1975.74-18,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2702.817,2715.153,"How Mr. Bazelon, how personal are canceled checks which presumably you have already sent out to a payee, they have been paid through a bank, they certainly are not like a diary, are they?"
1975.74-18,2,38807,richard_l_bazelon,,2715.153,2718.571,"Your Honor, they are not like a diary."
1975.74-18,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2864.591,2876.423,"Mr. Bazelon, would your case be any stronger if a taxpayer had gone to a lawyer and then these were the work papers of the lawyer?"
1975.74-18,2,38807,richard_l_bazelon,,2876.423,2888.948,"If the lawyer was serving, Mr. Justice Blackmun, the same function that the accountant was serving in this case, then I do not see why the case should be any stronger if the lawyer performs that work."
1975.74-18,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2888.948,2899.783,Except that a lawyer practices law and an accountant sometimes practices law?
1975.74-18,2,38807,richard_l_bazelon,,2899.783,2905.292,[Laughter] A comparison to the Boyd case further substantiates our position.
1975.74-18,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3019.186,3023.861,You would say search warrant would be equally effective?
1975.74-18,2,38807,richard_l_bazelon,,3023.861,3028.909,"Well, Your Honor, a search warrant does not require any compulsion on the person of the --"
1975.74-18,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3028.909,3032.496,"No, but it is a publication of testimony [Inaudible]"
1975.74-18,2,38807,richard_l_bazelon,,3032.496,3037.506,"Yes it is, Mr. Justice White, but not by the person who is claiming the protection with respect --"
1975.74-18,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3037.506,3045.502,[Inaudible] Are you suggesting a search warrant could be validly used to secure these papers from the accountant?
1975.74-18,2,38807,richard_l_bazelon,,3045.502,3047.072,I am suggesting that whether --
1975.74-18,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3047.072,3048.381,Or with a lawyer?
1975.74-18,2,38807,richard_l_bazelon,,3048.381,3060.36,-- whether to could or not would not justify the government in obtaining these documents in a way that places the taxpayer in a position where he has to incriminate himself.
1975.74-18,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3060.36,3061.249,By the Act --
1975.74-18,2,38807,richard_l_bazelon,,3061.249,3065.928,That is right.
1975.74-18,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3167.653,3173.677,What is the incriminatory link in just the production along the lines that you are just talking about?
1975.74-18,2,38807,richard_l_bazelon,,3173.677,3191.647,The incriminatory link is that the taxpayer is providing the government with the information that the papers produced by the taxpayer are indeed the records transcribed from his own records by the accountant.
1975.74-18,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3191.647,3198.463,"But now, apart from the content of those records, how does that assertion, if it be an assertion, tend to incriminate him at all?"
1975.74-18,2,38807,richard_l_bazelon,,3198.463,3202.726,It becomes part of the link in the chain of evidence against the taxpayer.
1975.74-18,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3202.726,3203.65,But how?
1975.74-18,2,38807,richard_l_bazelon,,3203.65,3227.781,"Because it allows, it is -- it is a statement that these are the documents that permits the government -- that is incriminatory because it gets the government to the next stage in the possession of evidence against the accused, namely to go to the accountant and have the accountant come in and testify."
1975.74-18,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3245.569,3261.563,"But if the subpoena simply described the piece of paper with a certain title on it, certain set of -- produce any paper with a certain title on it and dated a certain date, not saying that who it belong to or anything else, would you make the same argument?"
1975.74-18,2,38807,richard_l_bazelon,,3261.563,3264.876,"We would have a different case, no question about it, Mr. Justice White."
1975.74-18,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3273.005,3276.779,Whether having possession of it would be irrelevant piece of paper?
1975.74-18,2,38807,richard_l_bazelon,,3276.779,3279.535,"Well, that is always, that is always a --"
1975.74-18,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3279.535,3280.437,"Not always, I would say?"
1975.74-18,2,38807,richard_l_bazelon,,3280.437,3296.903,"No, no, well, if that element is involved that is a separate item of testimony and on that score I would like to mention briefly part of the Second Circuit?s opinion in the Beattie case."
1975.74-18,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3371.901,3378.809,"What if they subpoenaed the original records from the English quarters, Judge Friendly suggested they could do that, could not they?"
1975.74-18,2,38807,richard_l_bazelon,,3378.809,3384.534,"They certainly could, and there would be no act of compulsion on the claimant in that case."
1975.74-18,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3385.138,3385.99,Very well.
1975.74-18,3,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3388.232,3398.95,The act of production here is no more incriminating than was the act of production in Bellis or in White or Wilson or that whole line of cases.
1975.74-18,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3453.923,3465.705,"That is, that is peculiar under the facts of this case, would you say that you could subpoena the records from the taxpayer?"
1975.74-18,3,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3465.705,3469.461,Not his own personal records.
1975.74-18,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3479.889,3485.379,"You cannot subpoena them, even though the act of production might not be incriminating at all?"
1975.74-18,3,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3485.379,3495.388,"Well, that would raise a more difficult issue under Boyd, which need not be decided here and I might not foresee all the possible ramifications there --"
