2002.01-1368,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.288,"We'll hear argument next in Number 01-1368, the Nevada Department of Human Resources versus William Hibbs."
2002.01-1368,0,38399,paul_g_taggart,,17.999,22.541,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2002.01-1368,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,66.092,73.605,"Well, but now in the statute, the findings, or the beginning, they refer to the Equal... the Equal Protection Clause."
2002.01-1368,0,38399,paul_g_taggart,,77.942,89.475,"Yes, they do, but they do not... Congress did not invoke Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment, as it did in the ADA and the ADEA statutes."
2002.01-1368,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,96.062,113.524,"Well, as applied to private employers, I suppose Congress had to rely on Commerce Clause powers, but as applied to States, there is specific reference in the statute, of course, to section 5... to equal protection."
2002.01-1368,0,38399,paul_g_taggart,,113.524,117.489,"Yes, there is specific reference to equal protection--"
2002.01-1368,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,117.489,118.065,"Yes, right."
2002.01-1368,0,38399,paul_g_taggart,,118.065,125.578,"--but Congress told us why they mentioned equal protection in the House and the Senate report, where Congress stated that if--"
2002.01-1368,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,125.578,127.603,Why do you need the House and Senate report?
2002.01-1368,0,38399,paul_g_taggart,,172.147,175.202,"--We agree with that position, Justice Scalia."
2002.01-1368,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,175.202,175.369,"But Mr. Taggart, we--"
2002.01-1368,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,175.369,179.865,"--But the statement in the text goes to the manner, goes to the manner, not to the purpose at all."
2002.01-1368,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,179.865,184.861,"The first rule of statutory construction is to read on, and if you read on with me--"
2002.01-1368,1,19848,cornelia_t_l_pillard,,1564.02,1571.617,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2002.01-1368,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1669.781,1673.663,Sex-based dispensing of leave by the States?
2002.01-1368,1,19848,cornelia_t_l_pillard,,1673.663,1674.528,--By the States.
2002.01-1368,2,43575,viet_d_dinh,,2477.869,2492.646,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2002.01-1368,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2530.67,2543.589,"--In our cases, is there any difference between Congress' prohibiting something under its section 5 power and creating a substantive entitlement under that power?"
2002.01-1368,2,43575,viet_d_dinh,,2543.589,2548.503,"I have not seen a distinction in the cases, in the section 5 cases of this Court."
2002.01-1368,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2550.239,2551.148,"Uh-huh, right."
2002.01-1368,2,43575,viet_d_dinh,,2551.148,2555.235,"--as you can appreciate, but the distinction is not readily made."
2002.01-1368,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2565.1,2566.026,"No, it isn't, it's 12 weeks."
2002.01-1368,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2566.381,2567.329,"Well, it's a 12-week period."
2002.01-1368,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2567.329,2602.706,"It says you get 12 weeks, and if... if we approve this, we are establishing the proposition that in order to eliminate, to enforce any of the provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment, but in particular equal protection, the Government may establish whatever substantive requirements might further equal protection, and I just don't know where the Government plucks 12 weeks from and says that it... we have to stop discrimination, and therefore everybody's entitled to 12 weeks of leave, and it's an extraordinary leap."
2002.01-1368,2,43575,viet_d_dinh,,2602.706,2612.654,"--Your Honor, I disagree that there is no limiting principle here, and the limiting principle is precisely provided by this Court's jurisprudence in congruence and proportionality."
2002.01-1368,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2634.368,2636.226,And was that the big fight in the statute?
2002.01-1368,2,43575,viet_d_dinh,,2664.218,2666.697,"Your Honor, I was not there at the time, and I--"
2002.01-1368,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2687.585,2702.734,"Justice Scalia is right, is he not, that it... the bill that he's talking about was the '87 bill, and that didn't say anything about the Equal Protection Clause, and that's the startling difference between the bill that actually passed in 1993."
2002.01-1368,2,43575,viet_d_dinh,,2702.734,2705.418,"--That's precisely right, Justice O'Connor... I mean, Justice Ginsburg."
2002.01-1368,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2788.449,2790.95,Would 24 weeks have been proportional?
2002.01-1368,2,43575,viet_d_dinh,,2790.95,2795.658,"Your Honor, I'd... that would be a more difficult case."
2002.01-1368,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2796.151,2796.689,6 weeks?
2002.01-1368,2,43575,viet_d_dinh,,2798.275,2807.646,"--It would... the... the... I do not think that this Court's jurisprudence on proportionality has fine... is so finely tuned, and this Court's lack of--"
2002.01-1368,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2807.646,2811.816,"Of course, that jurisprudence came after the statute was enacted anyway."
2002.01-1368,2,43575,viet_d_dinh,,2811.816,2825.729,"--And I do not think that this Court's evaluation of congressional enactments under section (5), the unique remedial powers of Congress under section (5), would turn on whether it's 10 weeks or 12 weeks or 13 weeks."
2002.01-1368,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2829.527,2831.635,I agree that it shouldn't turn on the length.
2002.01-1368,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2835.721,2838.981,"Perhaps Justice Scalia should ask this question, but I was just wondering--"
2002.01-1368,3,38399,paul_g_taggart,,3399.331,3410.021,"First, it's important to distinguish that paternity leave and leave for childbirth and when a child is adopted is not the question that was presented to this Court today."
2002.01-1368,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3473.55,3482.179,"You mean holding, upholding money damages under the FMLA, because I take it you concede, or don't you, that Nevada is bound to follow this law?"
2002.01-1368,3,38399,paul_g_taggart,,3482.179,3492.582,"Since... I do concede that, and since 1993 Nevada has had a... a State policy of giving our workers Federal family medical leave."
2002.01-1368,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3516.275,3518.217,"Thank you, Mr. Taggart."
