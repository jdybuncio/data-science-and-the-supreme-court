1970.785,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,454.286,456.897,"Yes, but there’s no issue between you here today as far as I know."

1970.785,1,22361,eugene_greener_jr,,2074.806,2077.103,"Yes sir, they would take an oath of office."
1970.785,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2077.103,2081.574,"They'd take an oath, the same oath that the other state officers take?"

1970.785,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2218.491,2222.902,The county judge then is not primarily a judicial officer?
1970.785,1,22361,eugene_greener_jr,,2222.902,2223.339,No sir.
1970.785,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2223.339,2226.849,"He is more or like a -- what a county judge is in Missouri, for example?"

1970.785,1,22361,eugene_greener_jr,,2263.726,2267.511,"No sir, we do not."

1970.785,1,22361,eugene_greener_jr,,2280.534,2281.826,Yes sir.
1970.785,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2373.099,2381.164,"Mr. Greener, maybe I misunderstood you but I did not understand that the county judge performed that function."
1970.785,1,22361,eugene_greener_jr,,2393.679,2396.797,Let me clarify that Your Honor.
1970.785,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2415.335,2417.032,Who does the nominating?
1970.785,1,22361,eugene_greener_jr,,2417.032,2421.011,The original person seeking to setup the district.
1970.785,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2422.316,2424.896,(Voice Overlap)
1970.785,1,22361,eugene_greener_jr,,2424.896,2437.186,"As we pointed out in our brief, the power to appoint and we have referred to some municipal law in McQuillin, includes the power not to appoint."
1970.785,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2525.97,2528.994,How do you know?
1970.785,1,22361,eugene_greener_jr,,2528.994,2541.164,"Your Honor there is an annotation so holding and we have referred to it in the record, in our brief that -- and this is not controverted in this record."
1970.785,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2555.094,2556.615,May I ask you of that?
1970.785,1,22361,eugene_greener_jr,,2556.615,2557.105,Yes sir.
1970.785,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2557.105,2561.006,Are their districts like that at every place in the state?
1970.785,1,22361,eugene_greener_jr,,2561.006,2562.888,Yes sir.
1970.785,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2562.888,2563.899,The same kind?
1970.785,1,22361,eugene_greener_jr,,2563.899,2564.313,No sir.
1970.785,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2568.302,2574.564,I was trying to find out really what's behind this controversy.
1970.785,1,22361,eugene_greener_jr,,2574.564,2594.984,"Your Honor, that I do not know but I will say this that we and also in an answer to the Chief Justice’s remarks earlier, we have districts in Tennessee that provide fire protection, police protection, sewage, natural gas. There are all kinds of services that a district can provide."
1970.785,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2618.829,2625.066,Is there any difference in the qualities or the kind in East Tennessee and West Tennessee?
1970.785,1,22361,eugene_greener_jr,,2625.066,2625.875,No sir.
1970.785,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2653.464,2656.369,Is it covered by general state law or --
1970.785,1,22361,eugene_greener_jr,,2656.369,2658.299,Yes sir.
1970.785,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2658.299,2664.983,"And their election is by general elections, state elections?"
1970.785,1,22361,eugene_greener_jr,,2664.983,2665.457,Where the commissioners are --
1970.785,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2665.457,2666.342,Benton County?
1970.785,1,22361,eugene_greener_jr,,2666.342,2675.18,"Yes sir, whether commissioners are elected or whether the county judge is elected, they are elected by the qualified voters in the county at a general election."
1970.785,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2679.976,2689.087,What happens if you win and what happens if the others win?
1970.785,1,22361,eugene_greener_jr,,2689.087,2690.526,Well if Your Honor please --
1970.785,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2690.526,2692.417,I’m trying to find out what it’s about.
1970.785,1,22361,eugene_greener_jr,,2692.417,2711.733,"Well, the board simply cannot order one of these districts to bargain with a labor organization if we prevail and if the board prevails a district would have to bargain with the labor organization."
1970.785,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2716.66,2726.135,We’ll recess for lunch now counsel.
1970.785,1,22361,eugene_greener_jr,,2728.085,2732.014,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1970.785,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2843.256,2845.778,That’s under the Social Security Act Provisions.
1970.785,1,22361,eugene_greener_jr,,2845.778,2846.714,Yes sir.
1970.785,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2853.878,2857.292,Do you know under what language of that legislation?
1970.785,1,22361,eugene_greener_jr,,2857.292,2859.312,Yes sir.
1970.785,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2878.491,2880.036,And it says municipal -- excuse me.
1970.785,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2880.036,2884.924,(Voice Overlap) – They also are the non-private corporations in that same division.
1970.785,1,22361,eugene_greener_jr,,2884.924,2886.845,"No sir, I don’t think so."
1970.785,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2890.799,2900.226,"Well non-profit corporations in Tennessee, are they subjected to the will of the county judge?"
1970.785,1,22361,eugene_greener_jr,,2900.226,2900.787,Non-profit --
1970.785,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2900.787,2913.156,"What I’m trying to say is it restricted to Government owned or aren’t they also non-Government owned, non-profit corporations who enjoy the same privilege?"
1970.785,1,22361,eugene_greener_jr,,2913.156,2923.872,I do not know sir but I believe you are probably right that this benefit may extend to non-profit corporations which may or may not be a municipality.
1970.785,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2923.872,2925.992,I just know of several states that have that.
1970.785,1,22361,eugene_greener_jr,,2925.992,2932.369,"Yes sir, I do not know that for sure."
1970.785,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2951.172,2954.129,"Mr. Greener, why do you say that? Do you have a special ruling to that effect?"
1970.785,1,22361,eugene_greener_jr,,2954.129,2962.38,No sir we do not but we have made this contention from the lowest court and it has not been controverted by the board.
1970.785,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2975.055,2977.166,And so far as you know it’s never been litigated.
1970.785,1,22361,eugene_greener_jr,,2977.166,2979.175,"No sir, we do not, it has not."
1970.785,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2979.175,2983.679,"Well, was it embraced in some allegation in pleadings of some kind?"
1970.785,1,22361,eugene_greener_jr,,2983.679,2985.54,"Yes sir, it was."
1970.785,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2985.54,2990.409,"No evidence on it, it’s just an undisputed allegation."
1970.785,1,22361,eugene_greener_jr,,2990.409,2997.473,The record probably can make have this in it.
1970.785,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3022.714,3026.846,What’s the peculiar relevancy of that to the issue?
1970.785,1,22361,eugene_greener_jr,,3026.846,3035.077,The only relevance Your Honor is that this is one more of a series of indicia showing this to be a municipality.
1970.785,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3056.26,3059.414,As you described as a municipality in any law?
1970.785,1,22361,eugene_greener_jr,,3059.414,3060.294,Yes sir.
1970.785,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3089.991,3093.348,What benefit do you get from it if it is a municipality?
1970.785,1,22361,eugene_greener_jr,,3093.348,3094.653,We get tax exemption.
1970.785,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3099.833,3104.05,"Well, would that be highly relevant in the question before us?"
1970.785,1,22361,eugene_greener_jr,,3104.05,3105.532,Yes sir.
1970.785,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3117.451,3119.669,What about federal income taxes?
1970.785,1,22361,eugene_greener_jr,,3119.669,3122.565,Federal -- no federal income tax either Your Honor.
1970.785,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3150.01,3153.136,We can follow through on the federal income tax exemption.
1970.785,1,22361,eugene_greener_jr,,3159.731,3167.692,"Your Honor, it’s not in the record but they have such an -- they are exempt and yes they do."
1970.785,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3167.692,3170.273,Do you have an income tax in Tennessee?
1970.785,1,22361,eugene_greener_jr,,3170.273,3172.982,Yes sir but it’s not applicable to this.
1970.785,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3179.677,3181.434,"They don’t have income, do you?"
1970.785,1,22361,eugene_greener_jr,,3184.63,3185.295,Yes sir.
1970.785,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3185.295,3187.763,Well no wonder he doesn’t pay any income taxes if it has no income.
1970.785,1,22361,eugene_greener_jr,,3187.763,3193.5,"Well, it also exempt specifically from all state taxation Your Honor by the statute itself."
1970.785,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3193.5,3196.984,Is it privately owned?
1970.785,1,22361,eugene_greener_jr,,3196.984,3200.819,It’s owned by the citizens of the district.
1970.785,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3201.741,3203.119,All of them?
