2003.03-167,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,34.887,"We'll hear argument now in No. 03-167, United States v. Carlos Dominguez Benitez."
2003.03-167,0,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,10.173,13.808,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2003.03-167,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,54.968,56.318,May I just ask this one question?
2003.03-167,0,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,69.212,73.247,"--In the context of a guilty plea, I think it is, Justice Stevens."
2003.03-167,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,98.814,99.247,Well--
2003.03-167,0,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,99.247,100.531,--if the error had not been made.
2003.03-167,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,100.531,105.568,"--Except that we... I mean, the... the meaning of that term varies."
2003.03-167,0,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,150.347,156.167,We think the... we think it's directly analogous to the ineffective assistance of counsel context.
2003.03-167,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,180.132,180.616,All right.
2003.03-167,0,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,181.499,182.082,We think the same rule applies here.
2003.03-167,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,182.082,184.751,--Let me... let me suggest at least a reason why maybe it isn't.
2003.03-167,0,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,248.826,266.238,"Well, this Court's decision makes clear in Vonn that the defendant has a burden, of course, rejected the contention in that case that no matter when... regardless of the circumstances of when a rule 11 error occurs, the Government bears the burden of showing that there was no effect on substantial rights."
2003.03-167,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,279.196,290.087,"Well, you don't think that the standard for plain error that the Court spelled out in United States v. Olano provides the standard?"
2003.03-167,0,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,290.087,292.205,"Justice O'Connor, that's exactly our position."
2003.03-167,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,294.991,311.601,"Well, if... if that's so, Olano's fourth prong, if you will, is that the error... asks whether the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings."
2003.03-167,0,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,321.475,323.324,"--It certainly is, Justice O'Connor."
2003.03-167,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,394.087,399.157,May I ask you a question about the practical aspect of it?
2003.03-167,0,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,449.538,462.696,"--Justice Ginsburg, my understanding is that there is a bench book available to judges, and obviously there are a great many district judges in the United States district courts and some are going to be more meticulous than others."
2003.03-167,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,504.773,512.028,"Mr. Himmelfarb, is it... is it clear in this case that the defendant believed that he could withdraw his plea?"
2003.03-167,0,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,513.311,514.044,We don't.
2003.03-167,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,516.063,529.138,Do you think that... that a defendant making a guilty plea would normally believe that he could withdraw it when the Government has promised him nothing except that it would recommend to the judge a certain sentence?
2003.03-167,0,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,529.138,531.506,"Well, it depends, Justice Scalia."
2003.03-167,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,548.802,556.907,"If I was given all of that information, I... I certainly wouldn't leap to the conclusion that, well, if the judge doesn't accept it, I can withdraw the guilty plea."
2003.03-167,0,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,561.559,563.825,"We agree, Justice Scalia, and that's why we think--"
2003.03-167,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,563.825,575.717,"Wasn't... wasn't that covered in... in the plea agreement itself which was translated into Spanish for him, specifically that he could not... he could not withdraw his plea if the judge did not accept the plea?"
2003.03-167,0,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,575.717,578.419,"--That... that's exactly right, Mr. Chief Justice."
2003.03-167,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,578.419,580.704,Your basic point is that this part of the rule is pointless.
2003.03-167,0,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,580.704,583.405,"Not at all, Justice Stevens."
2003.03-167,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,583.405,585.59,"Well, I guess that's Justice Scalia's point."
2003.03-167,0,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,585.59,586.14,No.
2003.03-167,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,587.84,588.876,I'm sorry.
2003.03-167,0,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,588.876,602.2,"My point is that in a case like this where a defendant is advised that the judge is not bound by the parties' agreement, it's probably not reasonable for that defendant to assume that he can withdraw his plea if the judge doesn't follow the--"
2003.03-167,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,602.2,603.802,My point is not that it's pointless.
2003.03-167,0,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,617.36,618.729,--That's exactly right.
2003.03-167,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,620.479,625.399,"But if that's right and I were a district judge, I could probably save time by just omitting this regularly then."
2003.03-167,0,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,625.399,628.517,"No, Justice Stevens, I don't think that's likely to happen."
2003.03-167,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,655.769,663.941,Even... even respondent doesn't argue here that any omission from the rule 11 requirement produces an automatic reversal.
2003.03-167,0,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,665.709,666.242,--No.
2003.03-167,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,666.809,675.332,"So, I mean, that's... that's not the theory here, that if you don't... if you don't produce an automatic reversal, people won't give the rule 11 requirements."
2003.03-167,0,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,675.332,675.832,--That's right.
2003.03-167,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,699.781,703.752,"Now, is knowledge of requirement a wholly subjective test?"
2003.03-167,0,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,713.29,715.975,"It's a subjective standard, Justice Kennedy."
2003.03-167,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,727.681,727.949,So you put him on the stand.
2003.03-167,0,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,729.016,729.383,"No, you don't."
2003.03-167,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,744.143,745.159,"--Well, you're limited to the record on appeal."
2003.03-167,0,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,750.129,751.212,"There could, Justice Kennedy."
2003.03-167,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,763.704,766.139,"--But after sentence, it's impossible for him to testify?"
2003.03-167,0,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,766.139,767.356,That's right.
2003.03-167,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,773.912,774.912,But he didn't do that.
2003.03-167,0,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,779.732,780.266,That's exactly right.
2003.03-167,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,782.432,788.672,--But... but my question is in... in other cases it would not be possible to put him on the stand at any time after sentencing.
2003.03-167,0,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,788.672,789.522,No.
2003.03-167,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,800.027,801.495,"On collateral attack, could he take the stand?"
2003.03-167,0,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,801.495,803.264,--Sure.
2003.03-167,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,807.466,808.033,Under your--
2003.03-167,0,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,815.037,816.203,"No, Mr. Chief Justice."
2003.03-167,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,831.646,834.598,Normally... you may know... I'm just drawing on your background.
2003.03-167,0,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,862.432,868.335,"In the ordinary context, the relevant decision-maker is, of course, the judge, and the--"
2003.03-167,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,868.335,886.713,"No, I'm not talking about... I'm saying something happened to this human being who is there in court, and when I say did this affect his substantial rights, I usually ask myself did this error make a difference in terms of what happened to him."
2003.03-167,0,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,917.168,917.534,--No.
2003.03-167,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,920.37,920.753,Fine.
2003.03-167,0,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,930.659,932.944,--I can.
2003.03-167,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,937.213,937.665,That's my question.
2003.03-167,0,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,940.867,944.485,"Let... let me qualify that... that answer if I could, Justice Breyer."
2003.03-167,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,952.105,953.239,Like structural error.
2003.03-167,0,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,954.722,955.224,--That's exactly right.
2003.03-167,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,955.224,958.776,But I don't think we normally speak in terms of substantial rights in those cases.
2003.03-167,0,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,961.378,968.214,"Well, sometimes the question will be whether the third requirement of the plain error rule, which is a substantial rights requirement, has been affected."
2003.03-167,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,968.214,968.564,All right.
2003.03-167,0,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,977.57,979.589,"We certainly don't, Justice Breyer."
2003.03-167,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,984.576,991.73,"Mr. Himmelfarb, there's... there's another specific about this case that might have averted what happened."
2003.03-167,0,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,1017.381,1051.268,"Justice Ginsburg, I don't know as an empirical matter which is more likely to ensure that a defendant is aware of what's in the plea agreement, sitting down with a lawyer and a Spanish interpreter as happened here and having the three of them go over the plea agreement, having the Spanish interpreter translate it for the defendant in the presence of counsel so that the defendant can ask any questions of counsel that are necessary and counsel can answer them, on the one hand, or the suggestion which you just made."
2003.03-167,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1051.268,1070.182,"But I meant both, that is, that there would be the written... written-out plea agreement, which if he could read English, he could have read, and then the lawyer and the translator go over that written document with him, that that I think would be more effective than just hearing it orally."
2003.03-167,0,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,1070.182,1074.234,"Again, I'm not sure whether that's true as an empirical matter."
2003.03-167,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1084.876,1088.477,But I didn't mean this to be legally dispositive.
2003.03-167,0,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,1096.833,1111.676,"--Again, Justice Ginsburg, I... I don't think it's ordinarily the practice of U.S. Attorney's offices to provide Spanish translations of plea agreements to Spanish speakers who don't speak English."
2003.03-167,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1132.356,1135.374,I... I wasn't suggesting that... that it was a requirement.
2003.03-167,0,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,1160.24,1161.174,--That's right.
2003.03-167,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1195.447,1204.953,"Well, you might... you might say that the fact that the defendant must have known that he had three priors would have made him realize that the plea agreement probably wouldn't be accepted."
2003.03-167,0,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,1204.953,1212.958,--One could reasonably conclude that he should have had substantial doubt about whether he would have been eligible for the--
2003.03-167,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1212.958,1216.343,Are you assuming he understood the sentencing guidelines in that detail?
2003.03-167,0,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,1216.343,1216.976,--No.
2003.03-167,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1217.46,1217.962,It'd be rather unusual.
2003.03-167,0,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,1224.016,1227.484,"--Well, that's true, Justice Stevens."
2003.03-167,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1227.484,1227.801,Yes.
2003.03-167,0,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,1227.801,1234.122,Rule 11 imposes a requirement on the district judge to advise the defendant of his rights.
2003.03-167,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1259.37,1263.239,"Why shouldn't it be as an objective test, do you think?"
2003.03-167,0,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,1296.56,1306.018,"Justice O'Connor, it is absolutely the case that in undertaking this analysis, a court should and ordinarily will look at objective factors."
2003.03-167,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1307.251,1310.636,I would think you would win under an objective test.
2003.03-167,0,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,1313.355,1323.543,"--We think that... we agree that we win under either an objective or a subjective standard, given the strength of the case against respondent and given the fact that he received a substantial benefit from pleading."
2003.03-167,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1338.489,1346.243,"But... but if you're doing a subjective test, you might as... as long as you're doing that, why not accept the Ninth Circuit test: did he know?"
2003.03-167,0,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,1346.243,1356.783,"--Well, Justice Kennedy, we think that if he did knew... if he did know, that's a sufficient basis for rejecting his claim because if he knew, the fact that the judge didn't tell him a second time--"
2003.03-167,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1356.783,1357.316,"No, no."
2003.03-167,0,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,1367.306,1371.56,--We... we have no problem with the question Ninth Circuit asks.
2003.03-167,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1391.055,1396.825,I still would like to understand why you think an objective test is not acceptable.
2003.03-167,0,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,1396.825,1406.364,"--In... in the... when a defendant is confronted with a choice of pleading guilty or going to trial, he has... he, of course, has an absolute right to go to trial."
2003.03-167,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1419.34,1436.919,Maybe... maybe you think the courts would not... would not stand by an objective test in the situation where the facts are such that any intelligent defendant would have... would have made the plea even if he knew that it couldn't be revoked.
2003.03-167,0,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,1467.171,1468.288,--I think that's right.
2003.03-167,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1526.024,1527.626,"Very well, Mr. Himmelfarb."
2003.03-167,1,36379,myra_d_mossman,,1529.828,1535.297,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2003.03-167,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1601.674,1602.541,Why?
2003.03-167,1,36379,myra_d_mossman,,1605.293,1607.095,Or consistently can be--
2003.03-167,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1607.095,1608.978,--I read the Ninth Circuit.
2003.03-167,1,36379,myra_d_mossman,,1640.716,1642.584,--They don't talk about substantial--
2003.03-167,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1642.584,1644.034,"Well, didn't they say just what I read?"
2003.03-167,1,36379,myra_d_mossman,,1644.034,1644.953,"--Yes, but if--"
2003.03-167,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1644.953,1646.47,So why isn't it like summary reverse?
2003.03-167,1,36379,myra_d_mossman,,1648.738,1658.194,"--Well, it's... we... we see that not minor or technical means it has... it affected his substantial rights, and they actually cite to Olano."
2003.03-167,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1658.194,1658.644,"Oh, I see."
2003.03-167,1,36379,myra_d_mossman,,1662.915,1663.332,"Correct, and--"
2003.03-167,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1663.332,1669.085,"Now he, in fact... let's say second... did not understand that he had a right to withdraw."
2003.03-167,1,36379,myra_d_mossman,,1669.085,1669.985,--Correct.
2003.03-167,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1669.985,1671.437,"Now, is that the end of the thing?"
2003.03-167,1,36379,myra_d_mossman,,1671.437,1672.72,"No, they... then--"
2003.03-167,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1672.72,1675.239,"Ah, ah, where... that's... that's the point."
2003.03-167,1,36379,myra_d_mossman,,1678.674,1680.793,"--Well, they do go to fourth prong."
2003.03-167,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1681.243,1682.443,"No, no, not the fourth prong."
2003.03-167,1,36379,myra_d_mossman,,1690.949,1691.515,--Correct.
2003.03-167,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1691.515,1698.338,"I could... it could have affected my understanding, but it might be that I would have pled guilty anyway."
2003.03-167,1,36379,myra_d_mossman,,1698.338,1699.155,"Well, I think--"
2003.03-167,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1699.155,1700.071,That's what's worrying me.
2003.03-167,1,36379,myra_d_mossman,,1700.071,1700.638,--But--
2003.03-167,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1700.638,1705.675,And the most obvious case is where the judge gives me the sentence I hoped for.
2003.03-167,1,36379,myra_d_mossman,,1705.675,1713.429,"--That is the obvious case, Justice Breyer, and that was Chan and they cite to that in Benitez where they got exactly the sentence that they bargained for."
2003.03-167,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1716.031,1717.147,"Oh, I'm sorry."
2003.03-167,1,36379,myra_d_mossman,,1733.592,1734.708,Yes.
2003.03-167,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1734.708,1735.527,What about that?
2003.03-167,1,36379,myra_d_mossman,,1735.527,1739.646,"Well, I think what's coupled here is that it has to be knowing."
2003.03-167,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1754.239,1754.806,No.
2003.03-167,1,36379,myra_d_mossman,,1762.512,1764.797,--We believe that is consistent.
2003.03-167,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1771.867,1772.55,Of course.
2003.03-167,1,36379,myra_d_mossman,,1772.55,1773.267,But the--
2003.03-167,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1773.267,1773.819,Of course.
2003.03-167,1,36379,myra_d_mossman,,1775.135,1775.902,--Because we're--
2003.03-167,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1775.902,1787.31,"If in fact the major error... and he did not understand it... made no difference to the outcome, then, says the Government, he shouldn't be able to appeal it."
2003.03-167,1,36379,myra_d_mossman,,1792.697,1793.531,--So if the--
2003.03-167,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1793.531,1804.903,"And they want an... do you agree with them that they should have an opportunity to go back and to say, judge, we want this client also to be able to show it made no difference to the outcome?"
2003.03-167,1,36379,myra_d_mossman,,1807.522,1813.676,"--Justice Breyer, if they... if it's a major rule 11 error, it would not be minor or technical."
2003.03-167,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1816.378,1823.115,"Well, how... how do you know, just from reading rule 11, which errors are minor and technical and which aren't?"
2003.03-167,1,36379,myra_d_mossman,,1823.115,1826.084,We don't believe all errors in rule 11--
2003.03-167,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1826.084,1830.018,How do you... how do you... what's your standard for telling the difference?
2003.03-167,1,36379,myra_d_mossman,,1830.018,1835.605,"--Well, we think... Congress has enacted this and the full panoply of errors--"
2003.03-167,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1835.605,1836.289,Panoply.
2003.03-167,1,36379,myra_d_mossman,,1836.289,1842.676,"--of rule 11 advisements are important, and none them can be considered minor or technical--"
2003.03-167,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1842.676,1843.028,So--
2003.03-167,1,36379,myra_d_mossman,,1843.028,1843.945,--in and of themselves.
2003.03-167,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1843.945,1853.217,"--But just a moment ago, you said not every rule 11 violation is necessarily not minor or technical."
2003.03-167,1,36379,myra_d_mossman,,1856.086,1858.288,It's part of the analysis.
2003.03-167,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1861.073,1864.109,"Well, but I'm trying to get you to answer a rather specific question."
2003.03-167,1,36379,myra_d_mossman,,1869.077,1874.064,"Well, I think that was brought out in actually the advisory committee notes."
2003.03-167,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1911.422,1918.176,Did the... did the advisory committee purport to cover all possible minor or technical errors?
2003.03-167,1,36379,myra_d_mossman,,1918.176,1920.278,--They were just giving... it was illustrative I believe.
2003.03-167,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1920.278,1920.811,Examples.
2003.03-167,1,36379,myra_d_mossman,,1920.811,1921.361,Yes.
2003.03-167,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1921.361,1942.375,"In... in assessing how weighty this particular lapse is, should we take into account that as far as I know, this defendant has never said in the district court or on appeal that he indeed wants to go to trial."
2003.03-167,1,36379,myra_d_mossman,,1942.375,1947.763,It's our position that I wouldn't be here if he didn't want his plea vacated.
2003.03-167,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1947.763,1950.88,But he... on... on... the plea vacated is one thing.
2003.03-167,1,36379,myra_d_mossman,,1950.88,1951.498,"Well, we--"
2003.03-167,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1951.498,1959.32,"Because then you have... given that he has three priors, his sentence... he was sentenced at the mandatory minimum."
2003.03-167,1,36379,myra_d_mossman,,1974.43,1997.028,"--Justice Ginsburg, it's our position that this particular defendant at every single proceeding, he... he expressed his dissatisfaction with his counsel, and the respondent's second letter to the court, which is at the joint appendix, number 96, was exactly... could be construed, because it was a pro se filing, as a motion to withdraw."
2003.03-167,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2000.23,2001.947,--But that's not the question I asked you.
2003.03-167,1,36379,myra_d_mossman,,2011.705,2027.398,"Justice Ginsburg, after the conference on the substitution of hearing, a sentencing date was... was set, and this particular defendant did not object to the... to a trial date... excuse me... a trial date was set, and this particular defendant did not object."
2003.03-167,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2031.1,2040.121,"It's not... one thing not to object to a setting of a trial date, but did this man ever say I want to exercise my right to trial by jury?"
2003.03-167,1,36379,myra_d_mossman,,2040.121,2048.393,His first statement to the court at that substitution of... of counsel hearing was at no time have I decided to go to trial.
2003.03-167,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2051.295,2052.146,I thought he was stronger than that.
2003.03-167,1,36379,myra_d_mossman,,2055.65,2058.768,--He never said that specifically or definitively.
2003.03-167,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2061.069,2069.475,"But in any case, if he... if... but his concern is that his substantial rights or... have been violated."
2003.03-167,1,36379,myra_d_mossman,,2103.565,2111.987,--This particular defendant made requests of his attorney that were not brought to the court's attention.
2003.03-167,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2137.285,2139.102,What was... what was the evidence in the case?
2003.03-167,1,36379,myra_d_mossman,,2142.637,2147.708,--Basically his own confession and two co-defendants.
2003.03-167,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2153.111,2157.765,Would... would anybody in his right mind have wanted to go to trial?
2003.03-167,1,36379,myra_d_mossman,,2157.765,2160.048,In our opening brief--
2003.03-167,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2160.048,2162.567,And risk getting more than the mandatory minimum?
2003.03-167,1,36379,myra_d_mossman,,2162.567,2178.429,"--In our opening brief, we completely briefed out the defense of entrapment, and this is brought out through the... the language of this defendant through the three letters that were submitted to the court through his own pro se actions."
2003.03-167,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2183.748,2186.083,But you... you have looked at the cases on entrapment.
2003.03-167,1,36379,myra_d_mossman,,2186.083,2186.666,--Yes.
2003.03-167,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2186.666,2192.754,"And if you've got a predisposition, you don't have much of a prayer on a entrapment claim."
2003.03-167,1,36379,myra_d_mossman,,2198.057,2198.623,"No, they were not."
2003.03-167,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2200.009,2214.352,"If... if you were to prevail and he were to have a trial and be convicted, could he get a more lengthy sentence or would that raise problems of vindictive prosecution?"
2003.03-167,1,36379,myra_d_mossman,,2218.304,2219.673,I don't think that would be fair.
2003.03-167,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2221.873,2222.306,That's not--
2003.03-167,1,36379,myra_d_mossman,,2222.306,2222.791,"Also, the--"
2003.03-167,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2222.791,2227.51,"--My question is can he get... if he gets a new trial, can he get an increased sentence?"
2003.03-167,1,36379,myra_d_mossman,,2227.51,2231.295,"--It's possible, but... it's possible, Your... Justice Kennedy."
2003.03-167,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2231.295,2234.08,There's... there's no vindictive prosecution problem?
2003.03-167,1,36379,myra_d_mossman,,2234.08,2238.567,There possibly is.
2003.03-167,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2266.302,2267.987,Let me... let me ask you this question.
2003.03-167,1,36379,myra_d_mossman,,2277.175,2282.496,"Well, defendants plead guilty for all types of reasons."
2003.03-167,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2284.698,2285.065,"No, no."
2003.03-167,1,36379,myra_d_mossman,,2311.599,2312.266,Well--
2003.03-167,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2312.266,2313.899,An odd... an odd way to run the system.
2003.03-167,1,36379,myra_d_mossman,,2313.899,2321.721,--I think it's important to see if the... this implicates the constitutional principles under the Due Process Clause.
2003.03-167,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2329.494,2336.481,But the Ninth Circuit didn't follow... didn't find that his plea was involuntary in a constitutional sense.
2003.03-167,1,36379,myra_d_mossman,,2336.481,2338.916,"--Excuse me, Chief... Mr. Chief Justice."
2003.03-167,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2349.724,2353.442,Did... did they say it was a constitutionally invalid plea?
2003.03-167,1,36379,myra_d_mossman,,2353.442,2354.91,They cited to Graibe.
2003.03-167,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2354.91,2362.531,"Ms. Mossman, you've been asked questions by several different members of the Court and you don't seem to really respond to the questions."
2003.03-167,1,36379,myra_d_mossman,,2364.983,2365.983,"Yes, Your Honor."
2003.03-167,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2370.304,2378.725,I'm rather confused because are... where... there... there are two kinds of questions we've been discussing.
2003.03-167,1,36379,myra_d_mossman,,2407.542,2408.827,Yes.
2003.03-167,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2408.827,2416.331,All that... all that the person has to show is that he didn't understand his rights.
2003.03-167,1,36379,myra_d_mossman,,2419.45,2422.485,"I think, Justice Breyer--"
2003.03-167,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2422.485,2425.687,So let's assume... it's absolutely clear.
2003.03-167,1,36379,myra_d_mossman,,2448.002,2448.535,--Yes.
2003.03-167,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2448.535,2449.904,What's supposed to happen?
2003.03-167,1,36379,myra_d_mossman,,2449.904,2454.439,If he... is he alleging a rule 11 violation?
2003.03-167,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2454.439,2468.216,"Oh, there... look, what happened was the judge never told him that you're stuck with your plea if I don't give you what you think you're going to get."
2003.03-167,1,36379,myra_d_mossman,,2490.212,2495.266,"Justice Breyer, this is... I believe you're talking about a motivated pleader, a pleader that was--"
2003.03-167,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2495.266,2497.402,I'm talking what I think is about this case.
2003.03-167,1,36379,myra_d_mossman,,2497.402,2498.052,--This case.
2003.03-167,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2498.052,2498.468,Yes.
2003.03-167,1,36379,myra_d_mossman,,2522.1,2538.545,"I... Justice, if I can answer your question, it's the... a defendant that's caught in the justice... a criminal justice labyrinth and he... he doesn't understand, he doesn't understand the language, he's not confident in his counsel, and he believes he can withdraw his plea."
2003.03-167,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2539.195,2539.762,Yes.
2003.03-167,1,36379,myra_d_mossman,,2544.931,2546.483,But he... he should--
2003.03-167,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2546.483,2549.601,He's written secret letters to his relations--
2003.03-167,1,36379,myra_d_mossman,,2588.71,2602.053,"--Well, Justice Breyer, if he was motivated to plead guilty and there was an error in the rule 11 colloquy and he had the opportunity to replead, he could replead to another type of plea agreement, a C plea agreement."
2003.03-167,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2610.656,2613.258,Why... why would they give him a better deal the second time around?
2003.03-167,1,36379,myra_d_mossman,,2624.616,2627.501,"Well, he would... if he's motivated to plea--"
2003.03-167,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2627.501,2632.739,"In fact, they might... they might be mad at him for having backed out and... and not give him as good a deal."
2003.03-167,1,36379,myra_d_mossman,,2636.774,2644.297,"--Justice Scalia, I believe he would have an opportunity to renegotiate or he could be repleading to the... and have confidence in the process."
2003.03-167,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2644.297,2646.764,What leverage does he have?
2003.03-167,1,36379,myra_d_mossman,,2660.072,2670.197,"Justice Ginsburg, it possibly could be less time on supervised release, less time... or... or actually a type C plea agreement instead of the type plea agreement."
2003.03-167,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2681.336,2690.341,"But how could... could he escape from the mandatory minimum in any way other than what they thought might work here, this so-called safety valve?"
2003.03-167,1,36379,myra_d_mossman,,2690.341,2694.495,The mandatory minimum just becomes the bottom line then.
2003.03-167,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2694.495,2703.335,"And that's what he got, and that's why I can't understand any better deal that this defendant might have received."
2003.03-167,1,36379,myra_d_mossman,,2703.335,2711.089,"Well, Justice Ginsburg, he could have confidence in the plea proceeding if it was... if he was given the full panoply of his--"
2003.03-167,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2711.089,2715.476,"You'd do it all over again with the same bottom line, but he's going to feel better about it the second time?"
2003.03-167,1,36379,myra_d_mossman,,2715.476,2716.926,"--Possibly, yes."
2003.03-167,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2719.778,2741.043,"Well, I'd like to ask you a question that I asked Mr. Himmelfarb and that it seemed puzzling to me that the safety valve which everyone hoped would allow a sentence below the mandatory minimum could never work from day one because he had two additional prior offenses."
2003.03-167,1,36379,myra_d_mossman,,2751.749,2763.974,"Yes, Justice Ginsburg, the defendant knew, but it was confirmed on the record by the district court judge that he actually fully disclosed to his attorney his priors."
2003.03-167,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2770.895,2777.066,So his... his attorney knew that he was disqualified for this plea?
2003.03-167,1,36379,myra_d_mossman,,2777.066,2779.166,--This... it was confirmed.
2003.03-167,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2797.111,2800.312,"That they were confirmed, but at what--"
2003.03-167,1,36379,myra_d_mossman,,2800.312,2801.614,He exposed--
2003.03-167,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2801.614,2802.331,--at what point in time?
2003.03-167,1,36379,myra_d_mossman,,2802.331,2806.233,--He exposed his prior convictions to his attorney.
2003.03-167,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2813.422,2815.774,Which we don't have or do we have it?
2003.03-167,1,36379,myra_d_mossman,,2815.774,2816.491,"Yes, you do."
2003.03-167,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2820.659,2839.739,"And could... could you point to that place where it says that before he made this deal, which invoked the safety valve, he had told his counsel that I have three--"
2003.03-167,1,36379,myra_d_mossman,,2839.739,2843.341,"It's at... Justice Ginsburg, it's at page 109."
2003.03-167,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2845.126,2845.826,--Yes.
2003.03-167,1,36379,myra_d_mossman,,2845.826,2851.214,"The Defendant: I never felt that I had the proper representation, the way it should have been in my case."
2003.03-167,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2894.438,2900.156,"I don't see where he said, I told my lawyer that I had three prior convictions."
2003.03-167,1,36379,myra_d_mossman,,2900.156,2907.162,"He's trying to say, Justice Ginsburg, that I never hid anything and then... from my attorney about this case."
2003.03-167,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2912.048,2917.534,"Well, that's all right."
2003.03-167,1,36379,myra_d_mossman,,2920.053,2922.021,It's... I... I think it's on page 110.
2003.03-167,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2946.954,2951.608,"And the trial judge told him, you know, if you don't qualify, I might give you 10 years."
2003.03-167,1,36379,myra_d_mossman,,2954.46,2955.227,--Yes.
2003.03-167,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2955.227,2959.278,"And he says, knowing you have a mandatory minimum, I have to give you 10 years."
2003.03-167,1,36379,myra_d_mossman,,2963.082,2964.565,"Yes, correct, but this--"
2003.03-167,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2964.565,2968.319,So it's pretty hard to argue that... I mean... go ahead.
2003.03-167,1,36379,myra_d_mossman,,2968.319,2974.573,"--Justice Breyer, but this defendant... it's not clear that he did not know that he could not withdraw his plea."
2003.03-167,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2983.996,2993.018,"Well, how... how could he have had that when the thing in the plea agreement itself was explained to him in Spanish saying that he couldn't?"
2003.03-167,1,36379,myra_d_mossman,,2993.018,3003.39,"Mr. Chief Justice, our contention is that the... the fact that the plea agreement wasn't in Spanish is fatal here because his attorney couldn't speak Spanish."
2003.03-167,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3003.39,3004.659,"Well, but there was an interpreter there."
2003.03-167,1,36379,myra_d_mossman,,3004.659,3010.996,"But his... his attorney didn't... if his attorney couldn't speak Spanish, he doesn't know exactly what the interpreter is saying."
2003.03-167,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3010.996,3014.431,"Well, the interpreter can presumably speak English."
2003.03-167,1,36379,myra_d_mossman,,3014.431,3022.371,"The... well, there was a contention here between the defendant and his counsel in numerous instances before the court."
2003.03-167,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3035.012,3035.695,This is new to me.
2003.03-167,1,36379,myra_d_mossman,,3061.929,3071.685,"--No, Justice Scalia, we're not contending that, but we agree with the Ninth Circuit that the plea agreement in and of itself in... in this case is not conclusive of understanding."
2003.03-167,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3071.685,3072.035,Because?
2003.03-167,1,36379,myra_d_mossman,,3075.838,3077.788,"That's part of it, Justice Breyer, yes."
2003.03-167,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3077.788,3078.29,That is right.
2003.03-167,1,36379,myra_d_mossman,,3078.29,3079.173,"Yes, but also--"
2003.03-167,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3079.173,3079.556,All right.
2003.03-167,1,36379,myra_d_mossman,,3091.314,3092.831,"--Yes, it... this was--"
2003.03-167,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3092.831,3093.133,Okay.
2003.03-167,1,36379,myra_d_mossman,,3119.7,3139.845,"--Our... Justice Breyer, our position is consistent with the Ninth Circuit that he was under an expectation, a highly... a highly... high expectation that he would... would get the safety valve, and like the Ninth Circuit said, he had no incentive to read or double check the provisions within the plea agreement himself."
2003.03-167,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3141.881,3147.701,I thought one... one of your points was that this was a rather long agreement and this was paragraph 19.
2003.03-167,1,36379,myra_d_mossman,,3147.701,3150.153,"--Yes, Justice Ginsburg, that was going to be my next point."
2003.03-167,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3163.896,3169.9,I... I didn't know that you were claiming that this hadn't been an accurate translation.
2003.03-167,1,36379,myra_d_mossman,,3169.9,3170.466,--We--
2003.03-167,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3170.466,3179.006,I thought your... your point was that it was a lot to absorb without having a written copy to follow.
2003.03-167,1,36379,myra_d_mossman,,3179.006,3192.314,"--In our... Justice Ginsburg, in our opposition to the petition for writ of certiorari, we... we claimed that that point, that... that we have no certainty because there was not a transcript of the Spanish interpretation."
2003.03-167,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3192.314,3194.332,Did you claim that before the Ninth Circuit?
2003.03-167,1,36379,myra_d_mossman,,3194.332,3196.533,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice."
2003.03-167,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3196.533,3199.319,Did the Ninth... did the opinion reflect that at all in the Ninth Circuit?
2003.03-167,1,36379,myra_d_mossman,,3199.319,3199.869,Yes.
2003.03-167,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3199.869,3203.021,That... that you said that it was a not a correct translation?
2003.03-167,1,36379,myra_d_mossman,,3203.021,3204.687,They... yes--
2003.03-167,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3204.687,3206.323,Did it or did it not?
2003.03-167,1,36379,myra_d_mossman,,3206.323,3207.556,--Yes.
2003.03-167,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3207.556,3208.758,Whereabouts?
2003.03-167,1,36379,myra_d_mossman,,3208.758,3214.245,"I can read... excuse me, if I may correct myself, Mr. Chief Justice."
2003.03-167,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3214.245,3214.695,"Yes, please do."
2003.03-167,1,36379,myra_d_mossman,,3214.695,3222.749,"They didn't say that it was not a correct translation, but they did hold it as not conclusive."
2003.03-167,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3227.053,3228.653,"Well, finish."
2003.03-167,1,36379,myra_d_mossman,,3231.139,3233.224,--Just move on?
2003.03-167,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3233.224,3233.64,"Yes, please."
2003.03-167,1,36379,myra_d_mossman,,3233.64,3234.624,Okay.
2003.03-167,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3337.791,3339.493,"Thank you, Ms. Mossman."
2003.03-167,2,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,3342.445,3345.98,"Unless there are further questions, we'll waive rebuttal."
2003.03-167,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3345.98,3347.08,"Well, I do have a question."
2003.03-167,2,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,3374.698,3377.433,He may have an ineffective assistance of counsel claim--
2003.03-167,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3377.433,3377.868,An ineffective assistance claim.
2003.03-167,2,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,3377.868,3382.086,"--Justice Breyer, which he would be... which he would have to raise in a 2255 proceeding."
2003.03-167,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3386.122,3387.39,"Thank you, Mr. Himmelfarb."
