2014.14-114,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,9.71,"We'll hear argument this morning in Case 14-114, King v. Burwell. Mr. Carvin."
2014.14-114,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,9.71,18.325,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This is a straightforward case of statutory construction where the plain language of the statute dictates the result."
2014.14-114,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,18.325,34.0,"Mr. Carvin, will you please back up, because before we get to a question of statutory construction, as you know, each plaintiff, or at least one plaintiff, has to have a concrete stake in these questions."
2014.14-114,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,55.28,55.935,Yes.
2014.14-114,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,84.62,86.36,I -- I'll ask the government if they agree that --
2014.14-114,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,86.36,90.52,"And I should point out that the government has never disputed this, and I'd also like --"
2014.14-114,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,90.52,93.55,But the Court has an obligation to look into it on its own.
2014.14-114,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,93.55,98.59,"That's true, but of course there has been fact-finding by lower courts in an adversarial system."
2014.14-114,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,100.1,105.42,I don't think it was ever brought up in the lower court that these -- these two people were veterans.
2014.14-114,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,105.42,108.55,"If I could just make one further point on this, Justice Ginsburg."
2014.14-114,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,120.91,122.015,"Ah, yes."
2014.14-114,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,122.015,136.665,"With the usual clarity of the IRS code, making clear that you are only disabled from receiving subsidies if you have actually enrolled in a veteran's health services and it's undisputed that --"
2014.14-114,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,136.665,138.29,That's the government that's --
2014.14-114,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,138.29,138.91,-- Mr. Hurst did not.
2014.14-114,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,138.91,149.26,"-- that's deposition to. And then there were the two women, I think one of them was going to turn 65 in June, which would make her Medicaid-eligible."
2014.14-114,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,149.26,155.49,She will turn 65 in late June. She's obviously subject to the individual mandate well in advance of that.
2014.14-114,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,164.16,164.32,Per year?
2014.14-114,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,164.32,164.84,Excuse me?
2014.14-114,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,164.84,168.425,But you said she will turn 65 in June.
2014.14-114,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,168.425,169.27,"Late June, yes."
2014.14-114,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,169.27,171.81,So that takes care of 2015.
2014.14-114,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,171.81,172.665,No.
2014.14-114,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,183.46,183.72,Then --
2014.14-114,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,183.72,188.38,-- she will be subject to the penalty which will be alleviated only by --
2014.14-114,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,188.38,204.92,"Again, I'll ask the government if they agree with you on that. And then I think for the fourth plaintiff, there's a question whether she would qualify for a hardship -- hardship exemption from the individual mandate even if she received the tax credit, in which case the tax credits would be irrelevant."
2014.14-114,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,204.92,205.57,That's true.
2014.14-114,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,215.63,216.47,"Yeah, but you have to --"
2014.14-114,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,216.47,216.53,-- to --
2014.14-114,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,216.53,221.04,"But you would have to establish the standing, prove the standing."
2014.14-114,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,221.04,221.995,"Well, as --"
2014.14-114,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,221.995,226.155,If this gets beyond the opening door.
2014.14-114,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,226.155,235.3,"Fair enough, Your Honor, but -- but it's black-letter law that only one plaintiff needs standing, and for the reasons I've already articulated, both Plaintiff Hurst and Plaintiff Levy have."
2014.14-114,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,235.3,235.45,Okay.
2014.14-114,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,241.305,257.92,"Thank you. Returning to the merits, the only provision in the Act which either authorizes or limits subsidies says, in plain English, that the subsidies are only available through an exchange established by the State under Section 1311."
2014.14-114,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,257.92,298.57,"If you're going to elaborate on that, I would appreciate your -- in your elaboration, I've read that, and this statute is like the tax code more than it's like the Constitution. There are defined terms, and the words you just used concern a defined term. As I read the definition, there's a section, Definitions, and it says, quote, The term ""Exchange"" means, quote, an exchange established under 1311."
2014.14-114,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,359.04,359.53,Correct.
2014.14-114,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,359.53,361.54,And there's nothing else in this statute.
2014.14-114,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,361.54,362.15,Correct.
2014.14-114,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,362.15,364.79,So that's throughout what they're talking about.
2014.14-114,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,366.34,371.34,"As Your Honor just said, it tells the Secretary to establish such Exchange."
2014.14-114,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,371.34,371.745,Yes.
2014.14-114,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,371.745,377.36,And what 36B turns on is whether the State or the Secretary has established the Exchange.
2014.14-114,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,377.36,390.195,"No, it uses the same terminology that it's used in -- 15 times in this statute, namely, the terminology in the definition is ""an Exchange established by a State."""
2014.14-114,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,390.195,390.58,Under --
2014.14-114,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,390.58,391.965,That's the phrase.
2014.14-114,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,391.965,395.16,"Well, under 1311, that is the phrase."
2014.14-114,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,415.73,416.15,Mr. Carvin.
2014.14-114,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,416.15,419.575,-- not established by HHS under Section 1311 --
2014.14-114,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,419.575,420.08,Mr. Carvin.
2014.14-114,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,420.08,423.63,-- so it eliminates any potential ambiguity created by the definitional section.
2014.14-114,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,423.63,438.795,"Can -- can I offer you a sort of simple daily life kind of example which I think is linguistically equivalent to what the sections here say that Justice Breyer was talking about? So I have three clerks, Mr. Carvin."
2014.14-114,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,473.915,488.65,"If you're going to create moneys to Will for writing the memo and Amanda writes the memo and you say, the money will go if Will writes the memo, then under plain English and common sense, no, when Amanda writes the memo --"
2014.14-114,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,488.65,488.76,Gosh --
2014.14-114,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,488.76,489.42,-- but now --
2014.14-114,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,489.42,493.76,-- you -- you run a different shop than I do if that's the way -- (Laughter.)
2014.14-114,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,493.76,500.56,"Because in my chambers, if Elizabeth did not edit the memo, Elizabeth would not be performing her function."
2014.14-114,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,522.18,527.535,"And -- and in your chambers, you're agnostic as to whether Will, Elizabeth or Amanda writes it."
2014.14-114,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,536.04,543.195,"Well, Mr. Carvin, if I had those clerks, I had the same clerks -- (Laughter.)"
2014.14-114,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,543.195,558.04,"-- and Amanda wrote the memo, and I received it and I said, This is a great memo, who wrote it? Would the answer be it was written by Will, because Amanda stepped into Will's shoes?"
2014.14-114,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,558.04,562.7,That was my first answer. (Laughter.)
2014.14-114,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,562.7,563.29,"He's good, Justice Alito."
2014.14-114,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,563.29,569.82,"Justice Kagan didn't accept it, so I'm going to the second answer, which is you are agnostic as between Will and Amanda, but this --"
2014.14-114,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,569.82,570.34,"Ah, but that's --"
2014.14-114,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,570.34,573.82,But Congress was not agnostic as between State and Federal Exchanges.
2014.14-114,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,573.82,573.96,Yes.
2014.14-114,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,605.66,622.37,"We implore you to examine these words in the context of the Act as a whole because our argument becomes stronger for five reasons. To respond to Justice Breyer's point, he says such Exchange connotes that it's the same person doing it."
2014.14-114,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,632.35,633.08,"Yes, it does."
2014.14-114,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,663.4,663.76,To --
2014.14-114,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,663.76,672.405,"Now, that person from Mars, who's literal, which I usually am not, but a literalist, I think would have to read it that way."
2014.14-114,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,684.525,685.245,"Well, two points."
2014.14-114,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,685.245,689.37,"The Exchanges fall apart, nobody can buy anything on them."
2014.14-114,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,704.435,714.28,"Well, again, under the literalist or nonliteralist interpretation, saying that HHS will establish such Exchange doesn't suggest that the State has established such Exchange if there was --"
2014.14-114,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,714.28,715.39,"But the State, if made the --"
2014.14-114,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,715.39,730.13,"-- if there was ambiguity in that regard -- just if I could finish my answer to Justice Breyer -- you look at a parallel provision where they use precisely the same language, and they said, ""and shall be treated as a State,"" that language which is notably omitted from 1321 --"
2014.14-114,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,730.13,730.39,Correct.
2014.14-114,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,730.39,735.87,-- and it's a basic principle of statutory construction that you interpret the same phrases the same way.
2014.14-114,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,744.605,749.325,Take a breath. (Laughter.)
2014.14-114,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,749.325,781.265,I'm -- I'm a little concerned with how you envision this provision working. You're saying that the HHS Exchange can't be for the State so that it's established by the choice of the State. The choice the State had was establish your own Exchange or let the Federal government establish it for you.
2014.14-114,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,911.42,922.34,This Court has never suggested outside the very unusual coercion context of the NFIB Medicaid that a funding condition somehow invades a State police power.
2014.14-114,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,923.1,924.905,"Oh, we did it -- we said it last year."
2014.14-114,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,924.905,926.13,"In an NF -- no, no."
2014.14-114,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,940.42,961.73,"Let me say that from the standpoint of the dynamics of Federalism, it does seem to me that there is something very powerful to the point that if your argument is accepted, the States are being told either create your own Exchange, or we'll send your insurance market into a death spiral."
2014.14-114,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,982.98,986.195,"Two points, Justice Kennedy. One is the government's never made that argument."
2014.14-114,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,987.93,992.37,Sometimes we think of things the government doesn't. (Laughter.)
2014.14-114,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,992.37,1008.675,"Well, I certainly hope you do in this case, but not -- not on this question. What -- what I'm trying to, quite seriously, Justice Kennedy, convey is if this was unconstitutional, then the Medicaid statute that this Court approved in NFIB would be unconstitutional."
2014.14-114,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1008.675,1019.415,"Mr. Carvin, where the -- what would the consequence of unconstitutionality be? Very often you have an ambiguous provision, could be interpreted one way or another way."
2014.14-114,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,1024.485,1025.195,Correct.
2014.14-114,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1025.195,1033.725,"But do we have any case which says that when there is a clear provision, if it is unconstitutional, we can rewrite it?"
2014.14-114,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,1033.725,1034.87,And that -- and that --
2014.14-114,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1034.87,1036.43,Is there any case we have that says that?
2014.14-114,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,1036.43,1037.07,"No, Your Honor."
2014.14-114,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1054.01,1066.855,"I -- I fully understand that, but I think the Court and the counsel for both sides should confront the proposition that your argument raises a serious constitutional question."
2014.14-114,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,1076.87,1077.54,Your Honor --
2014.14-114,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1077.54,1081.09,"It may well be that you're correct as to these words, and there's nothing we can do."
2014.14-114,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1081.995,1083.5,There are many --
2014.14-114,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,1083.5,1097.64,"A -- A, there's no savings construction to echo Justice Scalia's point; but B, the point I want to make on the straight-up constitutionality is, if this is unconstitutional, then all of the provisions in the U.S. Code that say to States if you do something for No Child Left Behind, we will --"
2014.14-114,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1097.64,1099.47,But this is -- this is quite different.
2014.14-114,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1099.47,1110.235,"In -- in South Carolina v. Dole where -- where the matter of funding for the highway, suppose Congress said, and if you don't build the highways, you have to go 35 miles an hour all over the State."
2014.14-114,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,1111.46,1111.62,No.
2014.14-114,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1123.87,1124.36,Mr. Carvin --
2014.14-114,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,1124.36,1125.76,We want to create something new --
2014.14-114,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1125.76,1131.18,"Mr. Carvin, here's a -- you refer to the Medicaid example."
2014.14-114,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,1179.485,1183.21,That's why this is much less risky a deal for Congress.
2014.14-114,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1202.8,1209.785,What -- what are those benefits? What are the customers that can buy on it? What are the insurers that will sell on it?
2014.14-114,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,1209.785,1220.3,"Well, three points. One is we know textually that they thought Exchanges without subsidies work, because again, they have territorial Exchanges, but the government concedes no subsidies."
2014.14-114,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1220.3,1220.67,That's not --
2014.14-114,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,1220.67,1221.96,We have legislative history which --
2014.14-114,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1221.96,1230.36,"Mr. Carvin, that's not -- that's not what you said previously when you were here last time in this never-ending saga. (Laughter.)"
2014.14-114,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1230.36,1240.835,"You said the -- you said without the subsidies driving demand within the Exchanges, insurance companies would have absolutely no reason to offer their products through Exchanges."
2014.14-114,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,1248.22,1249.43,That is entirely true.
2014.14-114,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1255.54,1261.595,"So why create 1326 at all? Obviously, they thought that some States wouldn't."
2014.14-114,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,1261.595,1263.44,"Well, they thought it was possible and --"
2014.14-114,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1263.44,1264.59,Very possible.
2014.14-114,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,1264.59,1264.82,And then --
2014.14-114,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1264.82,1268.27,Because they set up a mechanism for that to happen.
2014.14-114,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,1268.27,1271.79,And then they -- what happens? You still get the Exchange.
2014.14-114,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1277.09,1288.15,But nobody -- no one's going to visit the program if there are no subsidies because not enough people will buy the programs to stay in the Exchanges.
2014.14-114,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,1288.15,1292.39,That is demonstrably untrue and not reflected anywhere in the legislative history.
2014.14-114,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1319.88,1320.41,Wait a minute.
2014.14-114,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,1334.705,1335.71,They didn't have --
2014.14-114,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1335.71,1337.95,You said it yourself in the prior case.

2014.14-114,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2078.51,2078.87,Wow.
2014.14-114,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,2080.625,2081.61,Yes.
2014.14-114,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2082.45,2084.905,You have two more sentences.

2014.14-114,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2104.89,2106.06,Those were two long sentences --

2014.14-114,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2111.135,2111.54,Yes.
2014.14-114,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,2158.53,2163.74,"Which, of course, is not the reading that the government's giving to it because they're not going to tell you --"

2014.14-114,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,2241.24,2244.4,It makes perfect sense to say the States get a choice.

2014.14-114,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,2332.085,2335.405,I've given you the contextual points before.

Now, with respect to standing, the question -- the case or controversy question turns on whether any of the four Petitioners is liable for the tax penalty for 2014. Now, this case was litigated in -- in the district court in 2013 based on projections on the part of each of the four Petitioners that they would earn a certain income in 2014."
2014.14-114,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2531.68,2534.0,So are you saying one person does have standing?

2014.14-114,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2568.915,2580.04,"Well, Mr. Chief Justice, as I said, that based on the projections, it is our -- it was our understanding that at least 1 of the 4 would be liable for a tax penalty."
2014.14-114,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2590.695,2593.22,"This is -- this is on a motion to dismiss, right?"
2014.14-114,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2593.22,2597.5,"Well, that's correct, Your Honor, but it does also go to this Court's jurisdiction."

2014.14-114,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2648.59,2650.34,"No, I'm not suggesting anything of the kinds."
2014.14-114,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2650.34,2652.15,-- on this issue and find what the facts are?
2014.14-114,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2652.15,2655.57,"Justice Alito, I did not raise standing affirmatively, the Court raised it."
2014.14-114,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2658.94,2663.9,"Well, you -- would you send it back then to -- to the district court?"
2014.14-114,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2663.9,2664.51,"Well, I guess no."
2014.14-114,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2676.45,2677.49,Would you -- would you --
2014.14-114,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2677.49,2678.215,-- has standing.
2014.14-114,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2678.215,2681.51,Why wouldn't we accept a representation by him?
2014.14-114,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2681.51,2682.82,There's no reason not to and I'm not --
2014.14-114,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2682.82,2694.755,If he -- if he makes a representation that at least 1 of the 4 is -- has -- was liable in 2014 and is liable in 2000 -- or will be liable in 2015 --
2014.14-114,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2694.755,2695.98,So I guess what I'm saying --
2014.14-114,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2695.98,2697.94,"I mean, we know at least one of them won't because that's --"
2014.14-114,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2697.94,2721.45,"What I'm saying about that is I'm actually going to step further than that, Justice Sotomayor, given that there hasn't been -- I'm willing to accept the absence of a representation as an indication that there is a case or controversy here, and -- and so that's why, Mr. Chief Justice, we haven't raised standing and that's what it -- but I do think that the key question is whether one of the four is liable for a tax penalty."
2014.14-114,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2774.33,2775.655,Of course it could be.
2014.14-114,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2790.855,2802.83,"So it's not the statute that they wrote, and the reason it's not the statute that they wrote, I think -- I want to actually start, if I could, picking up I think on a variation of the hypothetical that Justice Kagan ask -- asked."
2014.14-114,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2841.72,2844.06,There are no statutes that make no sense.
2014.14-114,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2844.06,2844.85,This one makes sense.
2014.14-114,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2844.85,2854.29,"If that is the case, every statute must make sense and we will -- we will twist the words as necessary to make it make -- that can't be the rule."
2014.14-114,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2854.29,2855.01,That isn't the rule.
2014.14-114,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2855.36,2855.63,Of course not.
2014.14-114,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2855.63,2860.25,-- is that you read -- that you don't read statutory provisions in isolation; you read them in context.
2014.14-114,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2870.455,2872.19,Where is that possible.
2014.14-114,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2872.19,2872.44,-- you read --
2014.14-114,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2872.44,2880.285,"I mean, you acknowledge that all of what you're saying only applies where there are alternative readings that are reasonable."
2014.14-114,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2883.05,2883.815,And there is -- there is --
2014.14-114,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2883.815,2895.08,"But, but -- if -- if it can only reasonably mean one thing, it will continue to mean that one thing even if it has untoward consequences for the rest of the statute."
2014.14-114,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2895.975,2899.93,"With respect to this statute, first, let me -- I want to make two points. First --"
2014.14-114,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2899.93,2901.39,Answer me in principle.
2014.14-114,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2917.925,2933.06,"I think there are -- there are a couple of limitations on that principle. The first is if what you have is a situation in which the -- that creates conflict within a statutory scheme, then the Court's got to do its best to try to harmonize and reconcile the provisions."
2014.14-114,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2933.55,2947.02,"Well, I disagree with that. You have a single case in which we have said the provision is not ambiguous, it means this thing, but, Lord, that would make a terrible statute, so we will interpret it to mean something else."
2014.14-114,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2948.04,2950.69,I think -- I think Brown & Williamson is a good example of that.
2014.14-114,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2976.29,2986.59,"But, General Verrilli, before we get too immersed in a number of provisions of this, could you respond to a question that was asked during Mr. Carvin's argument."
2014.14-114,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2992.585,2997.375,"So the -- here's what I would say about that, Justice Alito."
2014.14-114,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3021.65,3026.41,Is it a -- I was going to say does novel mean difficult? (Laughter.)
2014.14-114,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3026.41,3037.32,"Because it -- it -- it does seem to me that if Petitioners' argument is correct, this is just not a rational choice for the States to make and that they're being coerced."
2014.14-114,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3037.32,3038.01,So what I --
2014.14-114,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3038.01,3043.835,And that you then have to invoke the standard of constitutional avoidance.
2014.14-114,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3043.835,3061.92,"Well, what I was going to say, Justice Kennedy, is to the extent the Court believes that this is a serious constitutional question and this does rise to the level of something approaching coercion, then I do think the doctrine of constitutional avoidance becomes another very powerful reason to read the statutory text our way."
2014.14-114,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3090.425,3093.7,"Well, Mr. -- General Verrilli, let me ask you this about notice."
2014.14-114,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3108.955,3109.505,Correct.
2014.14-114,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3109.505,3128.08,"Now, if they were all caught off guard and they were upset about this, you would expect them to file an amicus brief telling us that. But actually, of the 34, only 6 of them signed the brief that was submitted by a number of States making that argument."
2014.14-114,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3141.22,3144.24,"So, I -- I guess I'd make two points about that, Justice Alito."
2014.14-114,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3199.59,3204.34,"Well, there's another point on notice on this Pennhurst argument that seems curious to me."
2014.14-114,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3227.075,3233.72,"Well, let -- let me address that directly, and then I'd like to make a broader point about statutory context in response."
2014.14-114,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3248.09,3249.27,"Well, I said -- I've said going forward."
2014.14-114,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3249.27,3249.52,And then --
2014.14-114,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3249.52,3252.325,After -- after the current tax year.
2014.14-114,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3252.325,3253.09,And then going --
2014.14-114,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3253.09,3272.09,Would it not be possible if we were to adopt Petitioners' interpretation of the statute to stay the mandate until the end of this tax year as we have done in other cases where we have adopted an interpretation of the constitutional -- or a statute that would have very disruptive consequences such as the Northern Pipeline case.
2014.14-114,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3272.09,3272.265,Sure.
2014.14-114,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3313.98,3315.32,How long has it taken --
2014.14-114,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3315.32,3330.8,"Well, for -- just to give you an example of the current time line, Justice Ginsburg, the -- in order to be -- in order to have an exchange approved and insurance policies on the exchange ready for the 2016 year, those approvals have to occur by May of 2015."
2014.14-114,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3335.79,3354.95,"What about -- what about Congress? You really think Congress is just going to sit there while -- while all of these disastrous consequences ensue. I mean, how often have we come out with a decision such as the -- you know, the bankruptcy court decision? Congress adjusts, enacts a statute that -- that takes care of the problem."
2014.14-114,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3358.635,3360.84,"Well, this Congress, Your Honor, I -- I -- (Laughter.)"
2014.14-114,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3360.84,3363.76,"You know, I mean, of course, theoretically -- of course, theoretically they could."
2014.14-114,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3363.76,3366.31,I -- I don't care what Congress you're talking about.
2014.14-114,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3375.355,3410.85,"And -- but the relevant question -- and then I'm going to try to get back to the point I was trying to make in response to Justice Alito's question. The relevant question here is: What did the Congress that enacted this statute in 2010 do? Did they really set up a system in which the States are subject to the kind of onerous situation that the Petitioner claims? And I think there are three textual indications -- objective, textual indications that that cannot possibly have been the statutory scheme that Congress tried to set up. First is the existence of the Federal Exchanges."
2014.14-114,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3424.76,3441.205,"Well, wouldn't it have been -- again, talking about Federalism -- a mechanism for States to show that they had concerns about the wisdom and the workability of the Act in the form that it was passed?"
2014.14-114,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3441.205,3470.34,"So, Justice Kennedy, I think the Federalism values are promoted by our interpretation, because if -- if that is, indeed, what a State thought, if a State really would have preferred that -- not to have the State government participate in the implementation of this Act, for reasons that Your Honor identified, the structure of the Act that Congress put in place and that we're advocating for today fully vindicates that concern."
2014.14-114,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3550.11,3553.41,This is not the most elegantly drafted statute.
2014.14-114,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3582.765,3603.1,"So, Justice Scalia, I -- I'm going to answer that question by talking about the legislative process, because I think it is quite relevant and I think it ought to be quite relevant even to you with respect to the question you just asked. The language here in 36B was not the product of some last-minute deal, it wasn't the product of scrambling at the end."
2014.14-114,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3633.04,3645.65,"There were senators, were there not, who were opposed to having the Federal government run the whole thing, because they thought that would lead to a single-payer system, which -- which some people wanted."
2014.14-114,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3655.765,3656.29,No.
2014.14-114,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3656.77,3659.03,That's -- that's certainly a plausible explanation --
2014.14-114,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3659.03,3659.09,No.
2014.14-114,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3659.09,3660.2,-- as to why the provision is there.
2014.14-114,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3660.2,3666.66,Mr. Carvin has floated that as an explanation and he -- and he suggests that it was Senator Ben Nelson who required it.
2014.14-114,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3726.78,3769.75,"Well, the puzzle that's created by -- by your interpretation is this: If Congress did not want the phrase ""established by the State"" to mean what that would normally be taken to mean, why did they use that language? Why didn't they use other formulations that appear elsewhere in the Act? Why didn't they say, ""established under the Act""? Why didn't they say, ""established within the State""? Why didn't they include a provision saying that an Exchange established by HHS is a State Exchange when they have a provision in there that does exactly that for the District of Columbia and for the territories? It says that they are deemed to be States for purposes of this Act."
2014.14-114,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3769.75,3769.89,So --
2014.14-114,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3769.89,3770.94,So why would they do that?
2014.14-114,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3770.94,3777.6,"So, of course, the provision says -- doesn't say ""established by the State"" with a period after State."
2014.14-114,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3803.52,3808.14,"So you're saying that by -- by cross-reference to 1311, they really mean 1311 and 1321?"
2014.14-114,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3808.14,3808.5,Yes.
2014.14-114,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3811.44,3811.63,All right.
2014.14-114,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3813.88,3814.29,"No, I think --"
2014.14-114,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3814.29,3814.68,-- for your case --
2014.14-114,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3814.68,3814.99,I think --
2014.14-114,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3814.99,3815.5,-- not the right direction.
2014.14-114,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3815.5,3819.68,"No, I think it goes in the right direction, if you'll just ride with me for a little bit, Justice Kennedy, on this."
2014.14-114,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3819.68,3824.01,"Well, before you -- before you get on to that, that -- your answer doesn't explain why -- why ""by the State"" is in there."
2014.14-114,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3827.2,3844.89,"Well, so the second point is that wherever this provision appears in the Act, ""established by the State under Section 1311,"" it's doing work; and the work it's doing is saying, what we're talking about is the specific Exchange established in the specific State as opposed to general rules for Exchanges."
2014.14-114,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3848.48,3853.61,"Well, why didn't they say ""in the State""? That's the phrase you just used, ""in the State."" Why didn't they say ""in the State""?"
2014.14-114,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3853.61,3857.365,"Because -- I suppose they could have, but it worked perfectly well this way."
2014.14-114,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3947.18,3954.32,"So when the statute says, ""each State shall establish,"" it really means the Federal government shall establish if a State doesn't establish."
2014.14-114,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3954.32,3955.16,I think the right way --
2014.14-114,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3955.16,3958.63,"And if that were the correct interpretation, you wouldn't 1321 at all."
2014.14-114,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3958.63,3959.09,So -- no.
2014.14-114,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,4058.53,4063.09,"Well, you're -- you're putting a lot of weight on the -- on the -- one word, such, such Exchange."
2014.14-114,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,4087.95,4089.61,"It isn't gobbledygook, Justice Scalia."
2014.14-114,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,4140.93,4153.315,"The word ""such"" means not -- not just the Exchange that the State was supposed to set up, but it means the State Exchange."
2014.14-114,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,4153.315,4162.05,It means an Exchange that qualifies as satisfy -- as an exchange established by the State because it satisfies the requirement of 1311(b)(1).
2014.14-114,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,4162.05,4162.17,No.
2014.14-114,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,4171.38,4179.045,It hinges on -- it hinges on it qualifying as the State Exchange or being equivalent to the State Exchange for the purpose of the operation of the statute.
2014.14-114,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,4203.9,4215.45,"Would you agree that there -- that there are provisions of the Act where the exact same phrase, ""established by the State,"" has to be read to mean established by the State and not by HHS?"
2014.14-114,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,4215.45,4215.915,I don't --
2014.14-114,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,4215.915,4217.66,There are some provisions like that.
2014.14-114,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,4217.66,4220.96,"They've pointed out some, but I think they're wrong about each one, and I don't know what Your Honor has in mind."
2014.14-114,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,4220.96,4221.24,All right.
2014.14-114,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,4257.76,4257.9,Yes.
2014.14-114,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,4285.99,4286.795,And the State --
2014.14-114,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,4286.795,4292.06,"It met -- it met the requirements of the regulations you say, but do the regulations track the statute?"
2014.14-114,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,4292.06,4292.83,"Yes, they do."
2014.14-114,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,4292.83,4299.28,Do -- do they give the State authority to -- to say whether or not these -- these conditions have been met?
2014.14-114,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,4299.28,4304.12,They -- the requirements are imposed on the State Medicaid and CHIP end of the relationship.
2014.14-114,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,4337.67,4345.8,"As I understand your answer to be that there are Federal regulations telling the States what they have to do here, and they've all done it."
2014.14-114,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,4353.72,4356.495,"On the State's side of the interface, yes."
2014.14-114,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,4432.7,4442.415,What is the provision that says that only a -- only a qualified individual can be -- can enroll in a plan under an Exchange?
2014.14-114,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,4442.415,4464.14,"So let -- the -- the -- I will address that, but I just want to make clear the provision I'm talking about with respect to the -- the prohibition on selling a qualified health plan to anybody on -- on anything other than a qualified health plan on an Exchange is 1311(d)(2)(B), which is at page 8a of the appendix to our brief."
2014.14-114,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,4472.795,4473.79,Qualified health plan.
2014.14-114,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,4480.315,4503.23,"Well, I -- what they -- what the statute says throughout is that -- that qualified individuals are eligible to purchase on Exchanges, and it's the necessary meaning of that phrase that if you are not a qualified individual, then you are not eligible to purchase health care on an Exchange because otherwise, the word qualified would not have any meaning."
2014.14-114,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,4518.05,4521.7,This is part of Section 1312.
2014.14-114,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,4528.02,4528.315,Right.
2014.14-114,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,4537.685,4549.36,"I understand your argument is that it's a -- it's a logical inference from a number of provisions that only a qualified individual may purchase the policy, but I gather there is no provision that you can point to that says that directly."
2014.14-114,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,4549.36,4551.87,"It's -- well, that's what qualified means, Justice Alito."
2014.14-114,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,4560.865,4565.41,"""Qualified"" is used in the -- in the lay sense of the term, it's not a technical term here."
2014.14-114,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,4565.41,4570.08,"Well, I -- I think -- well, given the way it's defined, it's defined as a person who resides in the State."
2014.14-114,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,4634.21,4638.145,Is -- is that a synonym for ambiguity?
2014.14-114,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,4638.145,4653.295,"I think so, exactly right, Justice Scalia -- I mean, excuse me, Justice Kennedy -- that -- that you have ambiguity there precisely because you have to -- you know, this is a statute that's going to operate one way or the other. And the question is how it's going to operate."
2014.14-114,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,4655.52,4659.34,"Well, if it's -- if it's ambiguous, then we think about Chevron."
2014.14-114,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,4677.75,4679.65,"Yes, there are billions of dollars of subsidies involved here."
2014.14-114,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,4680.64,4693.41,"And it -- it seems to me our cases say that if the Internal Revenue Service is going to allow deductions using these, that it has to be very, very clear."
2014.14-114,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,4693.41,4694.15,So --
2014.14-114,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,4694.15,4705.88,And it -- it seems to me a little odd that the director of Internal Revenue didn't -- didn't identify this problem if it's ambiguous and advise Congress it was.
2014.14-114,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,4705.88,4709.53,So a few points about that with respect to Chevron deference.
2014.14-114,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4789.81,4795.955,"If you're right -- if you're right about Chevron, that would indicate that a subsequent administration could change that interpretation?"
2014.14-114,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,4795.955,4806.99,I think a subsequent administration would need a very strong case under step two of the Chevron analysis that that was a reasonable judgment in view of the disruptive consequences.
2014.14-114,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,4815.97,4816.19,General --
2014.14-114,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,4816.19,4833.68,"If there are any -- if there are any tax attorneys in the -- in the courtroom today, I think probably they wrote down what you just said. When we get future tax cases, the United States is going to argue that we should not read them to -- you know, there should be no presumption that a tax credit is provided by that statute."
2014.14-114,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,4833.68,4836.525,You should -- you should read it according to its terms.
2014.14-114,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4846.795,4849.56,"Thank you, General. Four minutes, Mr. Carvin."
2014.14-114,2,35611,michael_a_carvin,,4849.56,4853.74,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Very quickly on standing."
2014.14-114,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,4916.205,4929.425,"Could I follow up on something the General ended with, which -- and Justice Kennedy referred to, which is the need to read subsidies limited."
2014.14-114,2,35611,michael_a_carvin,,4959.655,4960.01,"No, no."
2014.14-114,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,4967.63,4967.93,Well --
2014.14-114,2,35611,michael_a_carvin,,4967.93,4978.375,"The dispute here is whether or not if they win under ambiguity, and they don't because the canon requires unambiguous statutes not to afford the tax credit."
2014.14-114,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,5098.14,0.0,"Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted."
