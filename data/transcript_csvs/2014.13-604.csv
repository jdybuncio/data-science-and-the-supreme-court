2014.13-604,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,4.635,Our first case this morning is Heien v. North Carolina.
2014.13-604,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,6.487,13.158,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
2014.13-604,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,35.321,42.843,"So suppose that this State, North Carolina, did have a good-faith exception to the exclusionary rule."
2014.13-604,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,44.793,56.001,"We would be -- still be arguing, if that were the case, that not only the Fourth Amendment was violated, but that the good-faith exception didn't apply."
2014.13-604,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,63.238,66.689,"Well, why would it be any more debatable than the argument you're making here?"
2014.13-604,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,77.747,81.466,"--Well, that's not exactly what this Court's jurisprudence holds, of course."
2014.13-604,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,88.972,95.476,Then -- and then -- but then that question is why isn't that a problem for you when you say there cannot be a reasonable mistake of law?
2014.13-604,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,96.476,101.03,"--Well, there's a difference, Justice Kennedy, between rights and remedies in the Court's jurisprudence."
2014.13-604,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,115.122,127.197,"Well, in connection -- we're talking about whether as a -- as a categorical matter, as a jurisprudential matter, we can have this dichotomy known as a reasonable mistake of law, a difficult and interesting question."
2014.13-604,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,144.057,146.091,"--No, I really don't think so, Justice Kennedy."
2014.13-604,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,178.313,179.163,Would you just submit that the--
2014.13-604,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,179.163,182.015,"Mr. Fisher, I have a preliminary question."
2014.13-604,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,219.79,224.777,"--Because it would be the fruit of the poisonous tree, Justice Ginsburg, if the stop was illegal."
2014.13-604,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,234.299,238.601,"--Well, suppose the officer had said, all right, I'm giving you a warning."
2014.13-604,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,242.886,248.021,"I -- I think that's more or less what the officer did say here, Justice Alito."
2014.13-604,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,248.021,252.592,"And you would say then, even in that situation, that that would be the fruit of the poisonous tree?"
2014.13-604,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,252.592,254.575,Yes.
2014.13-604,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,275.79,286.146,"I understood you to say earlier that you don't take -- distinguishing the exclusionary rule in qualified immunity, you don't take reasonableness into account when it comes to a mistake of law?"
2014.13-604,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,286.146,288.931,"What -- what I -- I'm sorry, Mr. Chief Justice."
2014.13-604,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,296.437,297.454,"Well, but the Fourth Amendment--"
2014.13-604,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,297.454,297.887,You do sometimes--
2014.13-604,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,297.887,298.821,"--I'm sorry, go ahead."
2014.13-604,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,298.821,299.173,--Forgive me.
2014.13-604,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,302.675,307.726,But the -- but the Fourth Amendment itself protects only against unreasonable searches and seizures by its term.
2014.13-604,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,320.552,336.912,"Mr. Chief Justice, the Court rejected that precise argument in Anderson, that textual argument that the word reasonableness means that the Fourth Amendment incorporates mistakes of law, and because of a deep common law rule, which is that when we ask--"
2014.13-604,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,336.912,338.364,If I could just pause.
2014.13-604,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,338.364,338.748,--Yeah.
2014.13-604,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,338.748,350.405,"I thought we said exactly that in Herring, though, where we said that even though we're going to look at it in terms of remedy, that was not to say that the reasonableness didn't go to whether there was a substantive violation of the Fourth Amendment."
2014.13-604,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,350.405,361.296,"My understanding of Herring would be that would be a mistake of fact case, whether or not there was a warrant outstanding for Mr. Herant's -- Mr. Herring's arrest would have been a factual question, not necessarily a legal question."
2014.13-604,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,383.127,384.243,"Well, if you put aside--"
2014.13-604,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,384.243,385.161,But at the right stage -- forgive me.
2014.13-604,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,385.161,396.902,"--I was just saying, putting aside our discussion of Prouse and -- and Herring, why does it make sense to say that you don't take reasonableness into account when the Fourth Amendment only protects against unreasonable searches and seizures?"
2014.13-604,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,396.902,399.338,"I think for three reasons, Mr. Chief Justice."
2014.13-604,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,435.527,437.061,Isn't it strange that you're citing Cheek for that proposition?
2014.13-604,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,443.783,447.318,Because of a special statutory exception that Congress had written.
2014.13-604,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,475.052,483.472,"Suppose the officer stopped the driver here and said, you know, I've been going to night law school and we don't know about this one light/two light thing."
2014.13-604,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,492.847,494.13,"Well, I think there's two questions in there."
2014.13-604,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,494.13,495.816,And then -- and then he sees the contraband.
2014.13-604,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,495.816,496.666,Pardon me?
2014.13-604,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,496.666,500.084,"And -- and then he sees the -- in the course of this conversation, he sees the contraband."
2014.13-604,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,500.084,502.536,"Well, I think there's two questions embedded in there."
2014.13-604,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,557.104,562.091,"But Mr. Fisher, we -- we don't review opinions."
2014.13-604,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,622.047,628.617,"Well, Justice Scalia, nobody has addressed the question of remedy in this case because nobody needs to address the good-faith--"
2014.13-604,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,628.617,635.704,"Well, we need to if we find, as you urge us to find, that it violates the Fourth Amendment to make the search."
2014.13-604,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,649.03,649.78,"--Well, with -- forgive me."
2014.13-604,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,674.161,674.663,"--Well, you have."
2014.13-604,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,680.031,680.983,--No.
2014.13-604,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,719.275,721.275,So the most you can get from us is a remand?
2014.13-604,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,721.275,722.894,That's right.
2014.13-604,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,724.928,730.499,Just let the North Carolina law -- court decide whether -- whether the remedy of exclusion should have been--
2014.13-604,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,730.499,730.715,--That's right.
2014.13-604,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,749.927,762.035,"I don't know why, following up on what Justice Scalia is saying, he's saying we don't give you a remedy unless we believe that one is warranted under the Fourth Amendment."
2014.13-604,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,787.086,792.99,--The reason to remand is because the lower court hasn't addressed any question of remedy.
2014.13-604,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,798.292,803.596,"But North Carolina has a rule, I thought, that if you violate the Fourth Amendment, that's it."
2014.13-604,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,806.463,808.832,"--That will be our position on remand, Justice Ginsburg."
2014.13-604,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,811.051,814.003,But isn't that -- isn't that -- isn't that what the North Carolina law is now?
2014.13-604,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,821.157,823.025,"It wouldn't be futile, Justice Ginsburg."
2014.13-604,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,846.289,850.092,--That's because -- that's because they would be applying Federal law.
2014.13-604,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,861.584,862.517,"Well, let me say--"
2014.13-604,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,862.517,875.808,"But if indeed they're not going to ask that question when we send it back, it seems to me we have to answer that question here before we are able to reverse or affirm the North Carolina court."
2014.13-604,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,904.261,906.596,"--No, I don't believe they would or should."
2014.13-604,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,935.948,949.875,"Well, there's no question that if -- if North Carolina applied a State constitutional analog to the Fourth Amendment, they could have a more extensive remedy than is recognized under our Fourth Amendment cases."
2014.13-604,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,964.166,966.218,I don't need to make that argument.
2014.13-604,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,980.244,982.679,"Well, was this decision based on the State constitution?"
2014.13-604,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,982.679,983.296,No.
2014.13-604,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,993.719,1026.356,"But you're asking us to reverse it on the basis of Federal law and you're asking us to send it back to a State court which is not going to -- to inquire any further into Federal law, even though Federal law, arguably, you will concede says that even if there is a Fourth Amendment violation, if there's a good-faith reasonable belief that the law was violated, the remedy of exclusion will not be imposed."
2014.13-604,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1044.52,1047.539,"Well, I don't want to keep saying the same thing."
2014.13-604,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1069.369,1076.539,But it -- but it chooses to decide based on only half of the Federal law or three-quarters of the Federal law.
2014.13-604,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1081.36,1084.979,There is -- there is Federal--
2014.13-604,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1084.979,1087.097,This is consistent with Justice Scalia's concern--
2014.13-604,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1087.097,1087.664,--Forgive me.
2014.13-604,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1087.664,1089.865,--which is a follow-on to Justice Scalia's question.
2014.13-604,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1089.865,1092.9,They didn't get Federal law wrong.
2014.13-604,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1111.112,1115.933,"Well, I think that their analysis got Federal law wrong for the reasons we've described."
2014.13-604,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1115.933,1117.3,We don't review analyses.
2014.13-604,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1125.122,1137.845,"Well, Justice Scalia, if you want to decide the good-faith question that has not been briefed by any party, I -- I suggest you might want to tread carefully."
2014.13-604,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1153.872,1159.676,"Well, I don't want to take up your rebuttal time, but your argument this morning has confused me on something I thought I understood."
2014.13-604,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1179.922,1183.474,"Functionally, that's the way things work in North Carolina, Justice Alito."
2014.13-604,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1199.753,1210.209,The State constitution is irrelevant because you're arguing about whether there is -- whether there can be mistake of law in determining whether a search is reasonable under the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.
2014.13-604,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1217.047,1229.022,"--That's the next thing I was going to say, is in theory you're right, Justice Alito, but what North Carolina has said is that we construe article 1, section 20, which is the State counterpart, to be coterminous with the Fourth Amendment."
2014.13-604,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1243.282,1252.638,"Mr. -- Mr. Fisher, suppose this were a Federal case and we had available to us, it had all been briefed, two alternative holdings in order to support the conviction."
2014.13-604,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1273.884,1280.805,"I think the difference between those two holdings, if the Court remanded, may well play out differently in North Carolina."
2014.13-604,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1280.805,1281.172,"No, no, no."
2014.13-604,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1282.824,1283.674,"Oh, if it were."
2014.13-604,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1284.324,1286.542,--Is there any difference?
2014.13-604,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1286.542,1288.994,"If it were a Federal case, it would be functionally the same holding as to the outcome of that case."
2014.13-604,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1291.363,1291.663,"Yes, please."
2014.13-604,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1291.663,1305.439,"But there would be important reasons nonetheless, even though that would be a functionally identical holding for the parties in the case, there'd be very important reasons nonetheless to make sure that you render that holding as to remedy jurisprudence, not as to the Fourth Amendment itself."
2014.13-604,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1323.049,1329.055,"Well, you say that, but some people say that the existence of a rule-remedy gap undermines public confidence in the law."
2014.13-604,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1335.541,1354.186,"Because that argument comes from academic literature and my argument comes from the Court's jurisprudence, where people have argued that you shouldn't suspend remedy and the Court has rejected and said, no, as Judge Wilkinson wrote in the law review piece that I cited in the brief, there's an important reason to announce the right even if you're not going to give a remedy."
2014.13-604,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1382.272,1386.307,Do you dispute that this was a reasonable interpretation of State law?
2014.13-604,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1386.307,1395.08,"--I -- I would dispute if you were asking in sort of a Chevron sense, that -- that the statute was sufficiently ambiguous that it could have been read this way."
2014.13-604,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1410.84,1418.028,"Well, I don't mean to -- I don't mean to ask this in the context of any other body of the Court's case law, just in the common sense understanding of the term."
2014.13-604,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1431.603,1437.157,"--I think in the common sense way, I could concede that that would be reasonable."
2014.13-604,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1516.376,1520.494,"Mr. Fisher, let me -- let me try my problem just one last time before your time."
2014.13-604,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1568.827,1579.282,"--Well, if I need to argue it, I would refer you to the part three arguments in our opening brief, which explain why even if you move good faith into the right -- those -- those would be my arguments, Justice Scalia."
2014.13-604,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1599.696,1603.834,Sent it back down for that court to decide the other piece.
2014.13-604,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1607.536,1615.123,"If a State makes that choice that it's going to give a more favorable remedy, then federalism should respect that choice, Justice Scalia."
2014.13-604,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1617.242,1617.892,"Thank you, Mr. Fisher."
2014.13-604,1,56099,robert_c_montgomery,,1623.978,1627.596,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2014.13-604,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1648.526,1654.68,"When will we ever get an understanding, the right understanding of the law?"
2014.13-604,1,56099,robert_c_montgomery,,1669.023,1671.206,In North Carolina -- excuse me.
2014.13-604,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1671.206,1681.581,"Now, he may be bound by the appellate court decision, but that won't help clarify the state of the law."
2014.13-604,1,56099,robert_c_montgomery,,1701.392,1709.164,"Well, Your Honor in North Carolina, controlling precedent does come from the intermediate court of appeals."
2014.13-604,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1736.917,1746.873,"Well, it will for the appellate decision if it's now taking your view that it can just find out whether the reading, the officer's reading of the law is reasonable."
2014.13-604,1,56099,robert_c_montgomery,,1755.312,1762.699,--It depends on whether the question is an open question and whether that interpretation by the officer is reasonable.
2014.13-604,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1766.77,1768.637,Define what would make it unreasonable?
2014.13-604,1,56099,robert_c_montgomery,,1768.637,1787.266,"--Well, it would be unreasonable if there was plain language of the statute that no one could reach a different interpretation about at all if it was plain, or if there was a definite decision by an appellate court it would be unreasonable for the officer to interpret it in his own way."
2014.13-604,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1795.603,1798.572,That's a very broad definition of reasonable.
2014.13-604,1,56099,robert_c_montgomery,,1819.051,1828.676,It's not -- it's not the same as qualified immunity in that qualified immunity looks also -- it looks -- it protects the plainly incompetent.
2014.13-604,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1832.561,1833.878,"No, I think it doesn't protect the--"
2014.13-604,1,56099,robert_c_montgomery,,1833.878,1834.58,--I'm sorry.
2014.13-604,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1836.38,1836.647,--Yes.
2014.13-604,1,56099,robert_c_montgomery,,1847.388,1860.028,One of the things that this Court has said in Wilson v. Layne is that this Court and courts can look beyond just the officer's interpretation like this.
2014.13-604,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1893.535,1901.372,"You would not give a pass -- I mean, let's say the case is flipped here and the most reasonable reading of the statute is that you only need one brake light."
2014.13-604,1,56099,robert_c_montgomery,,1916.999,1918.451,"No, it would not."
2014.13-604,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1955.507,1957.659,"There is a problem, however -- I'm sorry."
2014.13-604,1,56099,robert_c_montgomery,,1982.343,1983.759,That's correct.
2014.13-604,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1983.759,1991.282,So how many citizens have been stopped for one brake light who are asked to have their car searched?
2014.13-604,1,56099,robert_c_montgomery,,1997.769,2006.392,"Well, there -- wholly innocent people are stopped quite often because of mistakes of fact, for instance."
2014.13-604,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2031.857,2035.894,I'd like to focus again on your definition of reasonableness.
2014.13-604,1,56099,robert_c_montgomery,,2049.802,2066.597,"If you have conflicting rulings from the court of appeals, it would be reasonable then for the officer to decide which he thought was the better rule, if there were two different decisions from the court of appeals, which is not supposed to happen in our system."
2014.13-604,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2071.567,2094.664,"Mr. Montgomery, I take it that one of Mr. Fisher's arguments, maybe his primary argument, is that this just looks like a remedies question, it does not look like a rights question, it focuses on the culpability of the officer in the way we do when we think about immunity or when we think about the exclusionary rule."
2014.13-604,1,56099,robert_c_montgomery,,2112.042,2118.029,"Well, certainly this court looks at different things when it looks at the right versus the remedy."
2014.13-604,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2152.202,2172.266,"What about -- what about the dissenter in the North Carolina court of appeals who said North Carolina has no good-faith exception, and so all that this decision does is it allows the police to get around the absence of a good-faith exception?"
2014.13-604,1,56099,robert_c_montgomery,,2184.99,2191.66,"That was the position of the dissenting justices at the North Carolina Supreme Court, one of the things that they said."
2014.13-604,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2224.898,2231.221,"Counsel, maybe you have the answer to all the questions I was asking of -- of Mr. Fisher."
2014.13-604,1,56099,robert_c_montgomery,,2237.958,2239.291,--The remedy?
2014.13-604,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2239.291,2273.048,"You did not -- you did not assert in your -- in your brief or you haven't asserted it in oral argument, thus far, anyway, that even if it did constitute a violation of the Fourth Amendment, the remedy did not have to be exclusion of the evidence, and that remedy is indeed subject to reasonable mistake of law, and therefore, the decision has to be affirmed."
2014.13-604,1,56099,robert_c_montgomery,,2279.402,2280.352,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2014.13-604,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2280.352,2280.752,Okay.
2014.13-604,1,56099,robert_c_montgomery,,2282.504,2288.474,"Well, we did not make that argument below in the North Carolina Supreme Court."
2014.13-604,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2311.006,2320.712,"Well, I'm not so sure it makes good prudential sense to allow the North Carolina Supreme Court to put to us what is basically an abstract question."
2014.13-604,1,56099,robert_c_montgomery,,2320.712,2324.747,The question of--
2014.13-604,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2324.747,2333.603,"To -- to give an answer without reference to the fact that, as Justice Scalia indicates, part of the Fourth Amendment is the good-faith exception."
2014.13-604,1,56099,robert_c_montgomery,,2335.805,2337.657,--That's correct.
2014.13-604,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2361.439,2362.006,Excuse me.
2014.13-604,1,56099,robert_c_montgomery,,2395.66,2398.462,"--That -- that has not been argued here or below, that's correct."
2014.13-604,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2464.673,2483.218,"Why does it -- why should you draw the line between if he gets the Fourth Amendment wrong, the Fourth Amendment is violated, but if he gets the statute wrong, then the Fourth Amendment is not violated?"
2014.13-604,1,56099,robert_c_montgomery,,2483.218,2494.859,Because the officer only needs to act reasonably and the fact that he gets the statute wrong does not mean that he acted necessarily unreasonably.
2014.13-604,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2494.859,2499.68,"Well, the fact that he made a mistake about what the Fourth Amendment requires could also be reasonable."
2014.13-604,1,56099,robert_c_montgomery,,2499.68,2506.666,"It could be, and that would be proper to consider, as this Court has, in the remedies stage rather than in the rights stage."
2014.13-604,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2538.555,2550.862,"Well, do you think if DeFillippo came up again today, with all the cases that have been decided since then, that we would decide it the same way or do you think we would conceptualize it now as a remedies question?"
2014.13-604,1,56099,robert_c_montgomery,,2550.862,2555.849,I think the Court would decide it the same way.
2014.13-604,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2567.824,2572.459,What kind of mistake of law did the police officer make in DeFillippo?
2014.13-604,1,56099,robert_c_montgomery,,2574.645,2577.097,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2014.13-604,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2577.097,2579.882,Why do you classify this as a mistake of law question?
2014.13-604,1,56099,robert_c_montgomery,,2579.882,2582.501,I believe the--
2014.13-604,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2582.501,2587.735,We said it was presumptively valid and he acted according to a statute.
2014.13-604,1,56099,robert_c_montgomery,,2587.735,2588.404,--That's correct.
2014.13-604,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2588.404,2590.687,You don't ask police officers to ignore the law.
2014.13-604,1,56099,robert_c_montgomery,,2590.687,2594.808,"That is correct that it's different from this case, but there was still--"
2014.13-604,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2594.808,2595.241,"No, no, no."
2014.13-604,1,56099,robert_c_montgomery,,2601.228,2603.08,--That's right.
2014.13-604,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2631.647,2634.616,Isn't there another difference between DeFillippo and this case?
2014.13-604,1,56099,robert_c_montgomery,,2671.724,2676.276,"It is different, but we do want officers to enforce the law."
2014.13-604,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2678.728,2692.322,"We want them to enforce the law fairly and as written and -- and not to push every statute to its -- you know, to the furthest, furthest, furthest it could go without being found, you know, utterly unreasonable."
2014.13-604,1,56099,robert_c_montgomery,,2692.322,2694.138,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
2014.13-604,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2701.344,2702.961,How -- how does the statute read here?
2014.13-604,1,56099,robert_c_montgomery,,2706.13,2711.116,The statute has two parts.
2014.13-604,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2712.885,2714.051,Where -- where do we find it?
2014.13-604,1,56099,robert_c_montgomery,,2714.051,2731.411,"This would be in the appendix to the Respondent's brief, appendix pages 1 -- appendix pages 1 through -- actually through 5, has all of the relevant portions of the statute."
2014.13-604,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2773.756,2775.756,That -- that seems to be what it says.
2014.13-604,1,56099,robert_c_montgomery,,2775.756,2785.163,"The confusion comes in -- the confusion comes in, Justice Scalia, in the last sentence of subsection (g) on appendix page 3, which says,"
2014.13-604,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2817.1,2820.653,"Well, I mean, that applies to all rear lamps, the stop lamp and all the other lamps."
2014.13-604,1,56099,robert_c_montgomery,,2820.653,2822.553,--That's correct.
2014.13-604,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2824.122,2825.405,So -- so it has to be plural.
2014.13-604,1,56099,robert_c_montgomery,,2828.99,2832.211,--Thank you.
2014.13-604,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2832.211,2833.494,"Thank you, counsel."
2014.13-604,2,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,2849.721,2852.673,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2014.13-604,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2902.189,2915.079,"Are all the cases that you cite, including Riddle, all in the context of a customs statute that didn't permit customs officers to suffer damages--"
2014.13-604,2,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,2915.079,2916.964,"Yes, Your Honor."
2014.13-604,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2916.964,2921.166,"--for purposes of an error of law, correct?"
2014.13-604,2,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,2921.166,2922.185,That's correct.
2014.13-604,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2922.635,2925.97,None of those cases involved a violation of the Fourth Amendment.
2014.13-604,2,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,2925.97,2926.787,--That's correct.
2014.13-604,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2933.66,2945.967,"But how is that different in terms of its analysis, those cases, from what we've ultimately applied as a qualified immunity standard with respect to civil damages today?"
2014.13-604,2,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,2945.967,2946.367,So--
2014.13-604,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2946.367,2949.502,Doesn't it follow -- don't they follow exactly the same reason?
2014.13-604,2,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,2949.502,2950.485,"--I don't think so, Your Honor."
2014.13-604,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2967.214,2973.385,So you disagree with Justice Story when he looked at those cases and made the point I just made.
2014.13-604,2,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,2973.385,2973.901,--No--
2014.13-604,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2973.901,2974.851,Do you think he was wrong?
2014.13-604,2,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,2974.851,2982.141,"--There's no doubt that in those cases the question, the question the court was ultimately answering is, are those customs officers liable."
2014.13-604,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2995.148,2996.316,Can I ask you a question?
2014.13-604,2,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,3038.243,3043.395,--I think we agree with each of those descriptions of a reasonable--
2014.13-604,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3043.395,3043.828,All right.
2014.13-604,2,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,3053.586,3062.276,--So we think that the North Carolina Supreme Court and the court of appeals were right that an officer could reasonably interpret the statute to require--
2014.13-604,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3062.276,3071.064,Only after a careful scrutiny and serious difficulty in construing the law does it turn out that the officer was wrong.
2014.13-604,2,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,3072.081,3073.114,--Here--
2014.13-604,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3073.114,3074.666,It stays a stamp -- a stop light.
2014.13-604,2,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,3074.666,3080.653,"--Here, the difficulty is in the other provision, which requires all originally equipped rear lamps to be working."
2014.13-604,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3081.653,3085.055,But that includes the stop light and any other lights.
2014.13-604,2,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,3092.895,3093.161,--Agreed.
2014.13-604,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3117.01,3121.48,So where do you come out in my hypothetical of the two court of appeals decisions?
2014.13-604,2,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,3125.699,3137.157,"So if the officer is in a jurisdiction whose court of appeals has decided the question, we think the officer is bound by that interpretation, even if other courts of appeals come out differently."
2014.13-604,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3153.551,3156.487,"Well, now I forgot one thing, which may be obvious to me."
2014.13-604,2,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,3171.83,3172.713,--That's right.
2014.13-604,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3178.667,3182.536,How is your standard differed from qualified immunity standard of reasonableness?
2014.13-604,2,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,3182.536,3182.971,--Sure.
2014.13-604,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3204.218,3222.196,"The one argument that is in your brief that I didn't follow is that the importance of holding the way you recommend is so that when you get this question solved, you tee up the question, what is the rule, one light or two lights."
2014.13-604,2,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,3250.18,3253.715,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2014.13-604,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3276.414,3283.92,"Do you -- do you agree that if there is an illegal stop, that this consent is the fruit of the poison tree?"
2014.13-604,2,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,3283.92,3286.636,We think that would be a difficult question.
2014.13-604,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3308.535,3314.789,"Ms. Kovner, you started your argument by saying you were going to give us three reasons why this should be a rights question rather than a remedies question."
2014.13-604,2,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,3322.545,3322.961,--Sure.
2014.13-604,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3366.639,3367.823,"Thank you, counsel."
2014.13-604,3,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,3370.023,3371.875,Thank you.
2014.13-604,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3404.98,3413.119,"Well, in this -- in this case, didn't the dissenters in the North Carolina Supreme Court say that the interpretation adopted by the court of appeals was surprising?"
2014.13-604,3,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,3425.593,3430.581,--I think you do because you have to just give a little more teeth to it.
2014.13-604,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3455.262,3455.696,"No, no."
2014.13-604,3,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,3466.67,3476.959,"--Well, I think, Justice Breyer, the problem with that is that it's the core presumption that the officer needs to understand the law as it existed, as it was later construed."
2014.13-604,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3574.032,3575.548,"Thank you, Counsel."
