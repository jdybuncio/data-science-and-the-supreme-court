1969.31,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,60.233,"Number 31, Brockington against Rhodes and others."
1969.31,0,18060,benjamin_b_sheerer,,69.938,77.66,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1969.31,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,190.784,198.873,Was that 1% rule applicable across the board all independent candidates for any elective office of the state?
1969.31,0,18060,benjamin_b_sheerer,,198.873,200.796,"Yes, sir that is my understanding."
1969.31,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,204.351,204.422,Likewise.
1969.31,0,18060,benjamin_b_sheerer,,204.422,207.066,-- applicable across the board.
1969.31,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,207.066,212.33,Your client is a -- wanted to be an independent candidate for election to the House of Representatives.
1969.31,0,18060,benjamin_b_sheerer,,212.33,222.843,"Yes sir that’s correct, for 21 first congressional District State of Ohio and in November 1968 general election."
1969.31,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,300.386,309.656,"Yes, but then, in order to appear on the ballot in November, he has to win a primary election and get a majority of the people voting on the primary."
1969.31,0,18060,benjamin_b_sheerer,,309.656,309.978,That’s correct.
1969.31,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,309.978,312.366,"Which is many, many thousands."
1969.31,0,18060,benjamin_b_sheerer,,312.366,314.073,That may be the case.
1969.31,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,317.08,320.142,Is there any alternative?
1969.31,0,18060,benjamin_b_sheerer,,320.142,321.773,To --
1969.31,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,321.773,323.722,To get on the final ballot?
1969.31,0,18060,benjamin_b_sheerer,,323.722,324.27,"No, sir."
1969.31,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,331.422,343.321,Now what I think we were concerned about you said in response to Justice Stewart’s question that he may have to get a majority in his primary.
1969.31,0,18060,benjamin_b_sheerer,,343.321,343.821,My main --
1969.31,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,343.821,345.318,Many thousands of votes.
1969.31,0,18060,benjamin_b_sheerer,,345.318,348.604,"My main response was that, it might be thousands of votes depending on the size."
1969.31,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,362.264,374.194,"Well, the -- if the party only puts up one candidate, he doesn’t have to -- those two are primary at all."
1969.31,0,18060,benjamin_b_sheerer,,374.194,379.86,"I would assume that his name would be on the ballot, that persons could cast right in votes for other people if they wanted to."
1969.31,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,379.86,381.967,How do you get on the primary ballot?
1969.31,0,18060,benjamin_b_sheerer,,381.967,386.226,"Their primary ballot is secured one or two ways, Your Honor."
1969.31,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,397.075,397.774,Of that party?
1969.31,0,18060,benjamin_b_sheerer,,397.774,399.572,Of that party.
1969.31,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,422.03,428.019,Do you know -- do you have any idea how often candidates are on opposed to the primary?
1969.31,0,18060,benjamin_b_sheerer,,428.019,430.813,"No, sir."
1969.31,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,435.605,442.292,"As a general rule in primary in Ohio is that any significant office, there is competition."
1969.31,0,18060,benjamin_b_sheerer,,442.292,443.436,"Yes, sir."
1969.31,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,447.555,451.161,This 7% requirement that you attack here.
1969.31,0,18060,benjamin_b_sheerer,,451.161,451.678,"Yes, sir."
1969.31,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,451.678,453.987,Which we now know has been reduced to 4 but in any event attacked.
1969.31,0,18060,benjamin_b_sheerer,,453.987,456.909,"Yes, sir."
1969.31,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,456.909,462.925,Those can be signatures of member of the Republican Party or the Democratic Party or no party.
1969.31,0,18060,benjamin_b_sheerer,,462.925,463.201,"Yes, sir."
1969.31,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,463.201,465.691,"Or some other third parties, isn’t it, is that correct?"
1969.31,0,18060,benjamin_b_sheerer,,465.691,466.539,That is my understanding.
1969.31,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,466.539,471.414,"Not limited to people who have not voted in party primaries for example, is he?"
1969.31,0,18060,benjamin_b_sheerer,,471.414,472.735,"No, it is not."
1969.31,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,472.735,476.327,The whole field is open to registered voters.
1969.31,0,18060,benjamin_b_sheerer,,476.327,481.439,"Yes, sir."
1969.31,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,777.928,780.471,Before you get to the merits.
1969.31,0,18060,benjamin_b_sheerer,,780.471,780.824,"Yes, sir."
1969.31,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,780.824,789.015,"If you mention the question of mootness, I missed it, I trust you well before you conclude."
1969.31,0,18060,benjamin_b_sheerer,,789.015,793.999,I would be happy to respond to that at this time Your Honor.
1969.31,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,797.159,821.408,"The relief you asked and I’m looking at page 8 of the appendix, was not for a declaratory judgment but this was an action in mandamus in which you directed yourself to getting your client on the ballot for a specific election, i.e. the election of November 5, 1968 and no other."
1969.31,0,18060,benjamin_b_sheerer,,849.836,851.297,"No, sir."
1969.31,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,910.366,922.167,But Mr. Sheerer isn’t this a partial answer to the Ohio Supreme Court did not reach this mootness?
1969.31,0,18060,benjamin_b_sheerer,,922.167,922.971,"Yes sir, I think that --"
1969.31,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,922.971,926.147,It’s not decided on the basis of remedy.
1969.31,0,18060,benjamin_b_sheerer,,928.43,929.907,"I believe they did, Your Honor."
1969.31,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,929.907,937.943,"Well, I understood the Ohio Supreme Court and please correct me if I’m mistaken, decided this before the election for which you asked to relief."
1969.31,0,18060,benjamin_b_sheerer,,937.943,939.107,"Yes sir, that is correct."
1969.31,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,939.107,940.734,So obviously it wasn’t moot then.
1969.31,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,940.734,942.783,Did they decide the constitutional issue?
1969.31,0,18060,benjamin_b_sheerer,,942.783,947.206,"I believe they decided the constitutional issue, Your Honor."
1969.31,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1006.781,1012.351,Are you suggesting that we now treat it as though you had sought a declaratory judgment?
1969.31,0,18060,benjamin_b_sheerer,,1012.351,1015.841,"Yes, sir if that is possible I’m going to request it."
1969.31,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1015.841,1018.582,On what authority do you suggest we do that?
1969.31,0,18060,benjamin_b_sheerer,,1018.582,1023.313,"Well, sir I don’t have specific authority as to the capability of the Court to do that."
1969.31,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1071.255,1075.595,"But Mr. Sheerer, you have asked the mandamus that’s an action at law."
1969.31,0,18060,benjamin_b_sheerer,,1075.595,1076.895,"Yes, sir."
1969.31,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1076.895,1083.391,"To enjoin the enforcement of the statute is inequitable action, is that right?"
1969.31,0,18060,benjamin_b_sheerer,,1083.391,1084.565,I didn’t here the --
1969.31,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1084.565,1090.949,To enjoin the enforcement of a statute would be inequitable action.
1969.31,0,18060,benjamin_b_sheerer,,1090.949,1092.619,"Well, sir we -- what we said and what we --"
1969.31,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1092.619,1098.61,"Well, what do you want us to tell this brave Court of Ohio, to grant mandamus?"
1969.31,0,18060,benjamin_b_sheerer,,1098.61,1113.737,"We want this Court to say, Your Honor that the courts below were in error that they should have held that the 7% requirement was unconstitutional and that the 1% requirement was in effect."
1969.31,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1115.305,1118.832,And that he should have -- he should be prolonged about.
1969.31,0,18060,benjamin_b_sheerer,,1118.832,1120.251,That that was what --
1969.31,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1120.251,1122.112,That he should have been prolonged about it?
1969.31,0,18060,benjamin_b_sheerer,,1122.112,1122.369,Yes sir.
1969.31,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1124.595,1127.219,Do you have any case that suggests that?
1969.31,0,18060,benjamin_b_sheerer,,1130.566,1132.307,"Well sir, we do cite --"
1969.31,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1132.307,1135.368,You made no effort to change the mandamus action.
1969.31,0,18060,benjamin_b_sheerer,,1140.823,1147.127,"Yes, sir that is true."
1969.31,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1149.102,1151.126,We could give sua sponte.
1969.31,0,18060,benjamin_b_sheerer,,1154.393,1162.862,"Well sir, the thrust of our lawsuit has always been that the 1% requirement was appropriate and the 7% was not."
1969.31,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1162.862,1165.85,What about one and a half?
1969.31,0,18060,benjamin_b_sheerer,,1165.85,1169.739,"Well sir, the -- we say this."
1969.31,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1197.833,1202.78,"I’ll presume somebody will have to decide that maybe like a legislature, wouldn’t it?"
1969.31,0,18060,benjamin_b_sheerer,,1202.78,1207.061,I’m not asking the Court to substitute its judgment for the legislature here.
1969.31,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1241.215,1244.839,Do you think the 1% --
1969.31,0,18060,benjamin_b_sheerer,,1244.839,1249.467,"I’m not entirely clear on that Mr. Justice, I can --"
1969.31,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1249.467,1253.837,"Because my next question was going to be one is, why was it for?"
1969.31,0,18060,benjamin_b_sheerer,,1254.317,1270.396,"Well, again I have to respond to my historical argument that this was not great participation that it was hardly any independent activity and the raise at sevenfold just about ended independent activity and also as a historical fact --"
1969.31,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1270.396,1273.698,"Well, I gather you think four is equally an affirmance in the same reasons."
1969.31,0,18060,benjamin_b_sheerer,,1273.698,1282.088,"Yes sir and of course if we cannot prevail here, I’m sure that 4% statute is going to be subject of litigation."
1969.31,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1310.859,1318.283,Is there some contention that the -- that this man was to run again?
1969.31,0,18060,benjamin_b_sheerer,,1318.283,1320.772,"I’m not clear, Your Honor whether he will or not."
1969.31,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1322.513,1323.476,Or he might run again?
1969.31,0,18060,benjamin_b_sheerer,,1323.476,1325.774,"Yes sir, I think it’s possible."
1969.31,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1330.173,1331.973,Or he’s not running?
1969.31,0,18060,benjamin_b_sheerer,,1331.973,1335.172,"Well, he was able to run as a write-in candidate of course."
1969.31,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1497.799,1511.58,"Well, do you say that it is not a permissible or valid state interest to take some measures to preclude multiple splinter parties?"
1969.31,0,18060,benjamin_b_sheerer,,1511.58,1512.808,I believe not Your Honor.
1969.31,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1513.038,1515.152,And how many parties at all?
1969.31,0,18060,benjamin_b_sheerer,,1515.152,1518.882,"I believe no, I believe there is nothing in the Constitution that requires that."
1969.31,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1535.247,1538.035,Do you think if one -- you thought 1% was all right?
1969.31,0,18060,benjamin_b_sheerer,,1538.035,1550.77,"Well I say this that -- and I want to be perfectly clear on this, I’m not saying that this Court -- this case requires this Court to say 1% is constitutional."
1969.31,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1575.752,1583.749,How does this requirement compare to the requirements of other states with respect to independent candidate is contrasted with no parties?
1969.31,0,18060,benjamin_b_sheerer,,1583.749,1584.631,"Very, very high."
1969.31,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1595.247,1597.467,"Yes I know but that’s a different situation, is it not?"
1969.31,0,18060,benjamin_b_sheerer,,1597.467,1610.113,"But if there -- only require parties to require 1%, the party is a structure as to an organization is the one to obtain ballot status."
1969.31,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1620.404,1622.04,Is that material in your brief?
1969.31,0,18060,benjamin_b_sheerer,,1622.04,1623.471,No sir it is not.
1969.31,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1633.316,1636.45,Thank you Mr. Sheerer.
1969.31,1,39905,robert_d_macklin,,1641.289,1645.668,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1969.31,2,18060,benjamin_b_sheerer,,2487.924,2490.538,Thank you Mr. Chief Justice.
1969.31,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2539.579,2550.518,Well did I understand you say before that there is no prohibition against the so-called sticker or write-in candidate under the present law?
1969.31,2,18060,benjamin_b_sheerer,,2550.518,2557.553,That was achieved by the Williams-Rhodes case in the three-judge District Court.
1969.31,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2559.55,2569.197,"So this candidate, your client could be a write-in candidate in any election for any office, is that correct?"
1969.31,2,18060,benjamin_b_sheerer,,2569.197,2578.69,"Yes, sir with the exception of -- if you are running for president, he would have to -- well now, Ohio requires filing of declaration intent to serve shortly before."
1969.31,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2648.484,2660.172,This could be argued that this is not necessarily legislation against or hostile to bona fide independent candidate.
1969.31,2,18060,benjamin_b_sheerer,,2697.892,2700.449,That could be so Your Honor.
1969.31,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2757.371,2769.778,Would you agree counsel of that the excessively long ballots sometimes called the bed sheet ballot has the tendency to discourage people from voting?
1969.31,2,18060,benjamin_b_sheerer,,2772.02,2776.552,"I don’t know, not about him in nature Your Honor but I suppose that it might discourage some people."
1969.31,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2776.552,2781.819,It’s widely thought that political scientists and other expert servers that is so.
1969.31,2,18060,benjamin_b_sheerer,,2794.949,2797.929,Certainly if there where a showing Your Honor that this was happening.
1969.31,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2804.858,2811.514,"Who must make that showing, the legislature when it fixes a 4% or 3% or 5% or 1%?"
1969.31,2,18060,benjamin_b_sheerer,,2811.514,2812.637,That’s right Your Honor.
1969.31,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2836.454,2855.473,Would you say that in effect that 1% is not unconstitutionally burdensome but the 4% is and in effect you are saying that the judgment of the legislature of Ohio is an erroneous judgment by that difference.
1969.31,2,18060,benjamin_b_sheerer,,2855.473,2858.087,"Yes, sir it is."
1969.31,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2858.087,2859.569,Thank you Mr. Sheerer.
