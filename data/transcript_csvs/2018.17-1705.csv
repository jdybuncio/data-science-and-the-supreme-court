2018.17-1705,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,9.44,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 17-1705, PDR Network versus Carlton & Harris Chiropractic. Mr. Phillips."
2018.17-1705,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,9.44,62.36,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The most startling comment in the Fourth Circuit's opinion in this case is the following one: ""We need not harmonize the FCC's rule with the underlying statute."" I would have thought, in any ordinary instance of judicial review of administrative agency decision-making, that's a statement that ought to leap out off the page, and when it's being applied in the context of a private right of action brought as a class action by private plaintiffs against a private defendant who is seeking to assert that the statute is not violated by the action of the defendant, the idea that the court of appeals will say, no, no, there's no opportunity and no reason for the courts to entertain the agency's standard to be applied in those circumstances is one that, it would seem to me, you could only justify in extraordinary circumstances that are candidly not presented."
2018.17-1705,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,62.36,100.16,"That -- that -- that's a bit what's unusual about this case. It's a different question whether the court of appeals can do it because the Hobbs Act gives it exclusive jurisdiction, and I think the exclusive jurisdiction has to mean something. And that it then doesn't become a matter of jurisdiction; it becomes a matter of how much, if any, deference this interpretation is due than the question we granted cert on, which is, what does the district court -- what can the district court do as opposed to the court of appeals?"
2018.17-1705,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,100.16,101.12,Can --
2018.17-1705,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,101.12,116.2,"So, here, the district court, I understand, didn't think it was challenging the validity of the order, or that you were, of -- of the FDC interpretation. It was interpreting it."
2018.17-1705,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,116.2,116.6,Right.
2018.17-1705,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,116.6,117.24,So where does that leave --
2018.17-1705,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,117.24,120.56,"But it was interpreting it in -- in -- in light of the statute, candidly."
2018.17-1705,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,120.56,121.44,"Well, but --"
2018.17-1705,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,121.44,122.4,Can -- can --
2018.17-1705,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,122.4,146.12,"-- yes, I agree with you, it's interpreting, but that's what applied challenges are about, aren't they? They're here's the statute, here's the interpretation, your facts are unique, and we now as judges decide whether or not that uniqueness falls within or without the interpretive guideline or the -- the statute."
2018.17-1705,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,146.12,147.36,"I mean, there --"
2018.17-1705,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,147.36,149.28,"That's a normal process, isn't it?"
2018.17-1705,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,149.28,149.68,Right.
2018.17-1705,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,169.48,191.36,"Put that aside, because that's -- assuming I don't accept that, that the court of appeals has exclusive jurisdiction, period, and we have plenty of statutes that give courts of appeals exclusive jurisdiction over matters. So, if you're not challenging the validity of the Hobbs Act, how do you -- and you accept it on its face, what happens?"
2018.17-1705,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,191.36,192.64,"Well, I accept it on its face."
2018.17-1705,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,192.96,194.04,Just with a different interpretation?
2018.17-1705,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,194.04,194.2,Right.
2018.17-1705,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,200.4,221.2,"Well, let -- let's assume we just accept where we've always been. Isn't this a Yakus case? If the court of appeals is the only body -- body that can determine the validity of a administrative holding or an administrative final order, do you lose?"
2018.17-1705,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,221.2,260.08,"No -- well, does -- I -- I think if you're relying on Yakus to get to that proposition, it's hard to do that without taking into account the specific circumstances and the statutory language in Yakus, because Yakus didn't just say that the court of appeals has exclusive authority to -- to do the injunctive work and the declaratory work, but it went further, and this Court upheld it under these circumstances, coupled with the provision that ""no court, federal, state, or territorial, shall have jurisdiction or power to consider the validity of any such regulation."" And it was the ""coupled with"" language that -- that makes Yakus what it is."
2018.17-1705,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,272.56,273.32,"Mr. Phillips, what --"
2018.17-1705,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,273.32,274.6,"I mean, I guess I don't --"
2018.17-1705,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,274.6,275.24,So then I'm --
2018.17-1705,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,275.24,300.36,"It seems to me the most difficult part of your argument is the question of reliance by parties that participated in the rule-making activity. So suppose here that PDR had been a party and it said -- it -- it -- it took the position -- it said the FCC should say that the -- the statute applies only if the fax directly proposes a commercial transaction, and the FCC agreed on that."
2018.17-1705,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,303.36,304.12,Right.
2018.17-1705,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,304.12,305.44,So couldn't --
2018.17-1705,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,305.44,308.16,But then I -- then the normal estoppel rules would apply.
2018.17-1705,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,334.64,338.4,"But suppose it wasn't a party, so -- but it -- it was aware of what was going on."
2018.17-1705,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,339.76,340.6,I --
2018.17-1705,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,340.6,342.04,The same result?
2018.17-1705,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,342.04,351.24,"I -- I think so, if you're talking about aware in the sense of -- I mean, the problem is even if they were aware of it, they still weren't sending out faxes."
2018.17-1705,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,360.12,360.2,Well --
2018.17-1705,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,360.2,360.64,Is that the --
2018.17-1705,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,360.64,362.52,"-- the government -- I'm sorry, go ahead."
2018.17-1705,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,362.52,374.96,"Is that the test, were you adversely affected at the time? Did you have -- were you -- you know, did you reasonably think you could be adversely affected at the time? What -- what do you think the test is?"
2018.17-1705,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,374.96,381.24,"I -- I mean, the Administrative Procedure Act suggests the test is you have to be adversely affected by the -- by the action of the agency."
2018.17-1705,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,385.44,386.0,"But, in other words --"
2018.17-1705,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,386.0,387.04,"Otherwise, you have no injury."
2018.17-1705,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,387.04,395.4,"-- that if they were carrying out that kind of activity, if they were sending out faxes at that time, would that be enough?"
2018.17-1705,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,395.4,414.04,"I -- I think that's difficult in that circumstance, because I -- I don't think the Court has historically said -- and -- and Adamo Wrecking and Justice Powell's opinion suggests that it doesn't put that kind of a burden on the average individual to try to sort out all the federal regulations and try to figure out exactly what happens."
2018.17-1705,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,414.04,414.28,Did -- did --
2018.17-1705,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,414.28,429.36,"And I think it's made even more complicated in a case like this one, where the FCC's ultimate order doesn't follow from a specific notice to the public that what we're going to do is entertain this kind of a definition of -- of what an advertisement is."
2018.17-1705,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,429.36,430.08,Did -- did P --
2018.17-1705,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,430.08,433.8,"All it said was we are going to -- we're going to review -- I'm sorry, Your Honor."
2018.17-1705,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,433.8,454.16,"Did -- did PDR have any reason to think that even the regulation as written would affect it? I mean, the -- the district court -- there -- there's -- the regulation was far from crystal-clear."
2018.17-1705,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,454.16,455.16,I agree with that.
2018.17-1705,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,455.16,466.64,And the -- the district court thought that the statute and the regulation were in harmony and that PDR didn't violate either.
2018.17-1705,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,466.64,466.84,Right.
2018.17-1705,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,497.36,497.92,Why --
2018.17-1705,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,497.92,499.44,"May I ask, Mister --"
2018.17-1705,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,499.44,501.04,-- estoppel on steroids.
2018.17-1705,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,501.52,520.24,"Why -- why isn't it enough that you can seek reconsideration of the FCC determination prior to the application of the order to you? And, presumably, the agency will deny it, but then you'd get judicial review at that point."
2018.17-1705,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,520.44,520.72,Right.
2018.17-1705,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,520.72,521.48,-- isn't that enough?
2018.17-1705,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,521.48,522.76,I -- I -- I don't think it's enough.
2018.17-1705,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,540.2,540.76,"Well, I mean --"
2018.17-1705,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,540.76,542.48,-- and -- and on its own time frame.
2018.17-1705,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,542.48,558.76,"Well, is that what Congress intended? I mean, to the extent you have the argument that you want a decision that's applicable throughout the heavily-regulated industry, I mean, that may be exactly what they wanted, whether it was only once or if they wanted to allow you to raise it again at a subsequent time."
2018.17-1705,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,558.76,582.76,"I -- I think it makes much more sense to think of the Hobbs Act as saying to the world, look, if you're directly affected by an agency action, and most of the cases under the Hobbs Act, most of those agencies, you're right, are heavily regulated and they follow very carefully what happens. And if they think they're being adversely affected, they run to court immediately and they seek some form of injunctive relief or equitable relief or declaratory relief in order to stop and --"
2018.17-1705,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,582.76,583.24,But why --
2018.17-1705,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,583.24,584.64,-- and allow them to go forward.
2018.17-1705,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,584.64,605.16,"-- why, if you think you're not doing anything wrong, I -- I know the Chief mentioned a motion for reconsideration, but much easier is a motion for declaratory judgment. And you go to the agency and you say, in fact, is what we do -- what -- we don't think we're violating your order."
2018.17-1705,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,609.72,610.84,We could have done that.
2018.17-1705,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,612.24,613.12,You could have asked that --
2018.17-1705,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,613.12,616.12,-- could have exercised primary -- could have allowed primary jurisdiction --
2018.17-1705,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,616.12,616.6,Exactly.
2018.17-1705,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,616.6,616.96,-- when the Commission --
2018.17-1705,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,616.96,618.92,But you never asked for it.
2018.17-1705,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,618.92,620.64,Because we believed that the district court --
2018.17-1705,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,620.64,621.68,I know what you believed.
2018.17-1705,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,625.24,641.24,"Well, with the benefit of hindsight, I suppose you could say that, but at the -- at the time of the -- of the litigation, we're faced with a question of are we liable potentially for treble damages for a violation of a private cause -- of a -- of a statutory provision providing a private cause of action."
2018.17-1705,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,641.24,645.84,"So, if I think -- if I were to think -- I'm not there yet -- that there's no due --"
2018.17-1705,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,645.84,646.52,There's hope.
2018.17-1705,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,649.4,663.2,"If there's -- if I don't think there's a due process violation because you have access to the agency and to getting a response if you take the proper steps, what happens to your argument then?"
2018.17-1705,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,663.2,663.6,"Well, I think it's --"
2018.17-1705,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,663.6,665.92,If I don't think there's a due process violation.
2018.17-1705,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,665.92,668.12,"Well, there are two issues, two parts of that."
2018.17-1705,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,694.0,699.8,"Mr. Phillips, what -- I guess that's the second time you've said that there's a real difference between the Yakus model and this."
2018.17-1705,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,705.24,705.84,Consider.
2018.17-1705,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,705.84,717.28,"Yeah, but that's -- once you have the word ""exclusive"" in the first provision, a second provision that says no other courts shall hear this kind of case is redundant, isn't it?"
2018.17-1705,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,717.28,717.56,No.
2018.17-1705,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,717.56,718.4,You don't need it.
2018.17-1705,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,718.4,718.92,"No, I think it --"
2018.17-1705,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,718.92,727.04,"As long as you say this Court has exclusive jurisdiction, why would you need a separate provision saying no other courts have jurisdiction?"
2018.17-1705,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,727.04,766.12,"Because there's a big difference between having jurisdiction to decide in the first instance whether or not to enjoin, set aside, or declare invalid a rule of an agency and what happens when an enforcement action is brought. And we know from the Administrative Procedure Act that the strong presumption is in favor of allowing you to defend against the regulation or order in an enforcement action. And, therefore, Congress has to mean explicitly that it wants something different under those circumstances. And what I would tell you is that if we were -- if -- if Yakus had been adopted here, my position would obviously be a heck of a lot more difficult, and then I'd only be arguing, well, that was a national emergency and this isn't."
2018.17-1705,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,772.72,773.72,"Well, I guess I'm still not --"
2018.17-1705,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,773.72,775.2,-- it's just an ordinary statute -- I'm sorry.
2018.17-1705,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,775.2,775.2,-- seeing it.
2018.17-1705,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,792.96,826.4,"If -- if Congress had not already adopted the -- the -- the rule that says you have -- you know, you have both, and this Court hadn't said, because you have both, that is the basis on which there is -- this estoppel operates against this defendant in a -- in a criminal action, that would be one thing. But that's -- that's how the statute was interpreted with that second provision in it. Congress then comes back and adopts a truncated version of that, doesn't say that it wants to go to the Yakus world."
2018.17-1705,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,826.4,828.48,"Well, truncated but with the word ""exclusive"" in it."
2018.17-1705,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,828.48,829.0,Right.
2018.17-1705,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,830.32,832.32,"Exclusive means exclusive, Mr. Phillips, doesn't it?"
2018.17-1705,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,832.32,833.28,Exclusive to do what?
2018.17-1705,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,833.28,834.88,It means this Court and no other.
2018.17-1705,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,834.88,835.52,Right.
2018.17-1705,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,842.56,843.32,Do you -- do you see any --
2018.17-1705,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,843.32,845.8,"-- that 24 -- I'm sorry, Your Honor."
2018.17-1705,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,845.8,846.4,Keep going.
2018.17-1705,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,846.4,853.36,That the -- that the statute subsequently in the Hobbs Act in 2349 specifically talks about judgments for declaratory relief.
2018.17-1705,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,853.36,855.48,The first sentence says determine the validity.
2018.17-1705,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,860.08,867.84,"I think the use of ""consider the validity"" is extraordinarily broad and says to those courts: Stay out of this business."
2018.17-1705,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,906.8,907.4,"So, Mister --"
2018.17-1705,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,907.4,908.4,-- of the regulations.
2018.17-1705,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,908.4,913.2,"-- Mr. Phillips, on -- on -- on Yakus, you've emphasized the difference in the statutory language."
2018.17-1705,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,941.28,941.6,Or were.
2018.17-1705,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,941.6,945.16,"And the other -- or were, right, right, right."
2018.17-1705,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,976.4,976.76,Right.
2018.17-1705,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,976.76,985.4,"Whereas, here, as I understand it, the regulation doesn't disappear tomorrow, and it isn't declared invalid in any meaningful sense."
2018.17-1705,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,991.8,996.68,I -- I tried to make the separation of powers point earlier because I do believe --
2018.17-1705,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,996.68,997.64,Fair -- you did -- you did try.
2018.17-1705,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,998.56,1012.36,"So, I mean, and -- and I do think you have to interpret the Hobbs Act in light of the -- of the extraordinary separation of powers problem that you create by an over-expansive use of exclusive, unless Congress really means it and -- and then ties it up in a bow for you."
2018.17-1705,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1012.36,1014.76,So what -- what separation of powers problem do you create?
2018.17-1705,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1014.76,1024.04,"You create the problem that you have here, where the court of appeals says to the -- to the world: We don't have to harmonize the rule, the FCC's rule, with the statute."
2018.17-1705,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1031.44,1036.04,"Well, I -- I think even the government agrees that a court can interpret a regulation."
2018.17-1705,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1091.08,1124.4,"Well, because I think, at bottom, the -- the -- the -- the normal rule should be, in any situation in which you are being sued for violating a statute, and you are seeking to defend on the basis that you didn't violate the statute, and they're being told, no, you did violate the statute because there's a regulation, and that regulation is not something you're entitled to challenge, you would ask is -- is that a situation -- I mean, that seems like a separation of powers problem to me because district courts are in the business of dictating what the law is, not being slavishly adherent to the --"
2018.17-1705,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1124.4,1125.12,But the problem --
2018.17-1705,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1125.12,1126.52,-- dictates of the Commission --
2018.17-1705,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1126.52,1152.08,"-- but the problem here is that what you're challenging is not the question presented. The district court looked at your argument and bought it and said we're not challenging -- you're right, this doesn't violate either the statute or the interpretive rule that the agency gave it."
2018.17-1705,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1152.08,1152.4,Right.
2018.17-1705,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1152.4,1157.88,It was the court of appeals who read the interpretive rule differently.
2018.17-1705,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1182.68,1182.88,Right.
2018.17-1705,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1214.08,1214.32,"Well, there are --"
2018.17-1705,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1214.32,1216.68,"And if Congress -- I'm sorry, Your Honor."
2018.17-1705,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1216.68,1222.92,"There are statutes that explicitly preclude judicial review in enforcement proceedings, however, like the Clean Air Act."
2018.17-1705,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1222.92,1223.2,Right.
2018.17-1705,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1223.2,1224.36,Are those unconstitutional?
2018.17-1705,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1224.36,1225.96,Probably not under the circumstances.
2018.17-1705,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1226.16,1241.36,"Well, then, if they're not unconstitutional, then that's -- you don't really have a separation of powers argument; you have more an argument about what we should do with a statute that's silent about the -- the -- whether judicial review is available in the enforcement proceedings. Some statutes --"
2018.17-1705,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1241.36,1254.0,"I mean, part of -- I mean, the -- the reason why it's hard for me to tell you in the abstract whether the environmental statutes are constitutional or not constitutional is they have different language than the statute here and certainly different language than the Court had in --"
2018.17-1705,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1254.0,1255.12,But you don't dispute --
2018.17-1705,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1255.12,1255.8,-- in Yakus as well.
2018.17-1705,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1255.8,1258.84,-- you don't dispute that those statutes preclude --
2018.17-1705,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1258.84,1259.52,Some forms --
2018.17-1705,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1259.52,1259.84,-- review?
2018.17-1705,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1259.84,1261.24,-- in some circumstances.
2018.17-1705,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1261.24,1261.4,Right.
2018.17-1705,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1261.4,1272.48,"But, again, it seems to me they're much more useful as an understanding of, you know, would Congress have intended, because even assuming it's constitutional, it's something that the courts -- that Congress doesn't typically do."
2018.17-1705,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1272.48,1289.6,"I agree with that. And -- but I -- I was just pressing the broader -- how far you were going to press the broader point on separation of powers, right? There's some statutes that explicitly preserve judicial review, some statutes that explicitly bar the judicial review in the enforcement proceedings --"
2018.17-1705,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1289.6,1290.44,Right.
2018.17-1705,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1290.44,1292.6,"-- and then we're in the gray area where it's silent, right?"
2018.17-1705,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1292.6,1293.0,Right.
2018.17-1705,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1329.0,1329.56,Could you talk --
2018.17-1705,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1329.56,1330.68,Justice -- Justice Breyer.
2018.17-1705,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1330.68,1331.08,I'm sorry.
2018.17-1705,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1331.08,1338.16,"I have a question. This may be very elementary, in which case just tell me read the brief again."
2018.17-1705,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1350.6,1351.08,Right.
2018.17-1705,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1351.08,1355.0,"-- and orders, but not those of the FCC."
2018.17-1705,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1391.04,1392.12,You want me to ask both or in order?
2018.17-1705,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1392.12,1393.96,"I won't hold -- I won't hold you to that, Justice Breyer."
2018.17-1705,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1393.96,1394.24,Okay.
2018.17-1705,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1420.52,1421.24,I've got them both.
2018.17-1705,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1421.24,1421.56,Okay.
2018.17-1705,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1421.56,1423.08,Let me take them in the -- in the opposite order.
2018.17-1705,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1427.2,1427.24,Yeah.
2018.17-1705,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1427.24,1427.68,-- problem.
2018.17-1705,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1436.08,1436.52,"Right, right."
2018.17-1705,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1441.24,1446.04,"Well, my guess is most -- most courts wouldn't entertain the suggestion that you're not allowed to --"
2018.17-1705,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1446.04,1446.52,"Therefore, there is no case?"
2018.17-1705,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1446.52,1448.2,At least I don't -- I've -- I've not seen one --
2018.17-1705,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1448.2,1448.48,Okay.
2018.17-1705,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1448.48,1449.56,-- where the issue was being fought.
2018.17-1705,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1449.56,1449.76,All right.
2018.17-1705,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1455.84,1456.6,Right.
2018.17-1705,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1456.6,1459.0,I'm trying to reconcile this with the APA.
2018.17-1705,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1459.0,1459.12,Right.
2018.17-1705,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1460.12,1461.0,Go back to the APA? Order is not --
2018.17-1705,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1461.0,1465.0,I don't think this is a final order within the meaning of -- of that provision in the Hobbs Act.
2018.17-1705,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1466.0,1467.28,So I should ask the other side? Okay.
2018.17-1705,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1467.28,1468.24,-- on the interpretive rule.
2018.17-1705,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1468.24,1468.6,Okay.
2018.17-1705,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1468.6,1495.32,"I realize there's a lot of water under that bridge in terms of things that have been reviewed that way, but the reality is -- and -- and I do think the -- the FCC's method of decision-making here is -- is one that's reasonably called into question because there are very specific rules that were adopted as part of this order and there was very specific notice and comment as to those. And none of that went to the part of the order that now is being used or asserted against my client as absolutely binding and without any opportunity for judicial review."
2018.17-1705,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1495.32,1495.72,How did --
2018.17-1705,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1495.72,1498.8,"Well, what -- what about your -- was your client around at the time?"
2018.17-1705,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1498.8,1500.0,"They were, but they weren't using faxes."
2018.17-1705,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1500.0,1511.68,"So what about a rule that says, I'm sorry, people who are around have to come and challenge it in the court of appeals when it's first promulgated or 90 days thereafter? What's wrong with that?"
2018.17-1705,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1511.68,1521.32,"The problem with that is, one, if you haven't been adversely affected by it, you have no injury in fact, you can't go to an Article III court and complain about it under those circumstances."
2018.17-1705,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1521.32,1522.72,Justice -- Justice Kagan?
2018.17-1705,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1522.72,1533.84,"May I ask if you would just talk a little bit about the argument, I think it's at the end of your brief, that this is really an interpretive rule and, whatever is true of any other rules, interpretive rules are different."
2018.17-1705,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1533.84,1534.2,Yeah.
2018.17-1705,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1534.2,1537.64,And then to also tell me why you think that's not waived.
2018.17-1705,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1545.6,1555.6,The -- the -- the main argument is not waived because the court specifically said it did not have to harmonize the interpretation of the FCC with the statute under these cases.
2018.17-1705,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1555.6,1556.48,And I don't want --
2018.17-1705,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1556.48,1558.56,And that's our -- that's the core of our main argument.
2018.17-1705,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1558.56,1563.24,"I don't want to take a lot of your time, but the -- but the point, of course, is -- and you -- I can read a bunch of stuff and I don't want to do that."
2018.17-1705,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1579.96,1580.8,"No, I mean, what we --"
2018.17-1705,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1580.8,1582.56,"-- that you accepted Hobbs, essentially?"
2018.17-1705,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1582.56,1603.84,"Well, I don't know that we accepted Hobbs so much as we were perfectly comfortable with the district court's determination that if you interpret the statute and the regulation and -- and lay it against our conduct, there was nothing wrong and, therefore, no basis for liability. It was when the Fourth Circuit said we -- you can't look at that at all or take any in -- into account, that's when we started to complain."
2018.17-1705,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1633.92,1634.64,So is your point --
2018.17-1705,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1634.64,1635.84,-- put it in front of the Court.
2018.17-1705,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1635.84,1641.28,-- is that point that interpretive rules are not subject to the Hobbs Act at all?
2018.17-1705,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1641.28,1642.2,"Yes, Your Honor."
2018.17-1705,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1642.2,1642.76,Is that your point?
2018.17-1705,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1642.76,1644.52,"That's our last point, yes, Your Honor."
2018.17-1705,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1644.52,1644.88,Okay.
2018.17-1705,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1653.24,1656.04,"Yes, that's absolutely correct, Your Honor."
2018.17-1705,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1656.04,1656.32,Thank --
2018.17-1705,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1656.32,1658.4,Do you think that was adequately briefed here?
2018.17-1705,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1658.4,1660.08,In this Court?
2018.17-1705,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1660.08,1660.56,Yes.
2018.17-1705,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1660.56,1661.56,Absolutely.
2018.17-1705,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1661.56,1664.08,"Thank you, counsel."
2018.17-1705,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1664.08,1667.28,"Thank you, Your Honor."
2018.17-1705,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1667.28,1669.68,Mr. Hara.
2018.17-1705,1,63114,glenn_l_hara,,1669.68,1686.16,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: When a district court refuses to accept a final order of the FCC interpreting the TCPA on the basis that it's inconsistent with the statute, that court is determining the validity of the order."
2018.17-1705,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1686.92,1692.12,The district court didn't find that the regulation was inconsistent with the statute.
2018.17-1705,1,63114,glenn_l_hara,,1701.28,1703.0,"That's exactly right, Justice Ginsburg."
2018.17-1705,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1745.32,1769.72,"What about the very basic argument, someone who is going to be subject to an enforcement proceeding has a right to notice and an opportunity to be heard on the issue? The way this thing came up, PDR had no reason to think that it was a party aggrieved."
2018.17-1705,1,63114,glenn_l_hara,,1769.72,1776.28,"Justice Ginsburg, do you mean in 2006 when the order was issued, or do you mean in 2013 before PDR sent the faxes?"
2018.17-1705,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1776.28,1803.68,"No, I mean when the administrative proceeding was going on, during the rule-making. At that time, PDR had no reason to think, unlike Yakus, where there's a price set and you know it, you're selling meat or whatever, you -- you are subject to that price. But, here, when the initial rule-making was going on, what reason did PDR have to think it would be affected by it?"
2018.17-1705,1,63114,glenn_l_hara,,1803.68,1820.0,"The notice of rule-making was published in the Federal Register, and that constitutes constructive notice to the whole world. You know, we're also assuming that PDR was not sending faxes offering free copies of its hard copy PDR book in 2006."
2018.17-1705,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1821.48,1823.6,"Well, let's -- that's -- those are the facts we have."
2018.17-1705,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1851.72,1852.96,"Shocking, huh?"
2018.17-1705,1,63114,glenn_l_hara,,1852.96,1853.64,Yes.
2018.17-1705,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1853.64,1857.2,Maybe a lot of people don't read the Federal Register. (Laughter.)
2018.17-1705,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1857.2,1858.6,Maybe they can't read it.
2018.17-1705,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1860.16,1868.04,"At any rate, this young man is forever barred, I think, under your interpretation -- maybe not --"
2018.17-1705,1,63114,glenn_l_hara,,1868.04,1868.24,No.
2018.17-1705,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1868.24,1871.6,-- from challenging the validity of that regulation under the statute?
2018.17-1705,1,63114,glenn_l_hara,,1871.6,1874.32,Our position is he is not barred from challenging the validity of the regulation.
2018.17-1705,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1874.32,1874.52,How?
2018.17-1705,1,63114,glenn_l_hara,,1874.52,1879.08,That person can petition the agency even after the 60-day period of review.
2018.17-1705,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1879.08,1880.64,"Oh, I understand he can petition the agency."
2018.17-1705,1,63114,glenn_l_hara,,1886.96,1888.8,A federal district court or a state court?
2018.17-1705,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1888.8,1889.96,"Yeah, federal district court."
2018.17-1705,1,63114,glenn_l_hara,,1889.96,1895.96,"Or a state court, because, under PDR's reading, state courts across the country could also determine the validity of FCC orders."
2018.17-1705,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1895.96,1902.28,"But -- but I'm talking about a federal district court, just as here, would be barred from determining the validity of that order, right?"
2018.17-1705,1,63114,glenn_l_hara,,1902.28,1902.6,Yes.
2018.17-1705,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1906.24,1907.92,He would have had to have been born earlier.
2018.17-1705,1,63114,glenn_l_hara,,1907.92,1912.48,"And then, if you lose there, you petition to the court of appeals, which can determine the validity of the order."
2018.17-1705,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1912.48,1926.08,"Yeah, but the -- the amount of deference you give to an agency in deciding whether they should begin a proceeding is enormous, I mean, compared to anything else. So you say to somebody, oh, go petition the agency, ask him to change it."
2018.17-1705,1,63114,glenn_l_hara,,1971.88,1973.44,I'm -- I'm not aware of a case --
2018.17-1705,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1973.44,1976.44,"Not under just this act, but, I mean, there are a lot of acts."
2018.17-1705,1,63114,glenn_l_hara,,1976.44,1977.52,I'm not aware of a case --
2018.17-1705,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1977.52,1979.16,"Well, that's a pretty big question."
2018.17-1705,1,63114,glenn_l_hara,,2014.4,2020.6,"Your Honor, on the APA's definition of order as something other than rule-making, I have to admit I'm not familiar with it."
2018.17-1705,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2020.6,2022.88,"Well, I'll read it to you if you'd like."
2018.17-1705,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2034.28,2037.72,"God, that's -- here -- where is it? Definitions."
2018.17-1705,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2046.84,2048.68,"Counsel, can I --"
2018.17-1705,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2048.68,2069.84,"It's -- it's -- when you have this business about, well, when the district court is applying, that you can go petition the agency for reconsideration and then, if the agency says no, then you can go to the court of appeals. Is what's before the court of appeals simply the question of whether they should reconsider it or the underlying merits of the interpretation?"
2018.17-1705,1,63114,glenn_l_hara,,2069.84,2072.56,It's the underlying merits of the interpretation.
2018.17-1705,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2097.88,2104.0,"Well, could the D.C. Circuit have said, look, you know, the -- the FCC looked at this just a couple years ago."
2018.17-1705,1,63114,glenn_l_hara,,2111.44,2121.0,"I think it would have to consider -- if you had an argument that had not been decided before, I think it would have to consider the challenge to the statutory authority for the agency's rule."
2018.17-1705,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2121.0,2127.0,Is there any different standard used at the D.C. Circuit when it comes up like that?
2018.17-1705,1,63114,glenn_l_hara,,2127.0,2128.96,It's Chevron deference.
2018.17-1705,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2128.96,2139.32,But is there -- is there any difference between it getting to the D.C. Circuit on that kind of petition and it getting to the D.C. Circuit if you had challenged the rule initially?
2018.17-1705,1,63114,glenn_l_hara,,2139.32,2143.84,There -- there was not in the Bais Yaakov of Spring Valley litigation. The FCC didn't argue for eliminating --
2018.17-1705,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2143.84,2145.4,That's the D.C. Circuit.
2018.17-1705,1,63114,glenn_l_hara,,2145.96,2146.68,Right.
2018.17-1705,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2146.68,2148.76,The -- the question -- I found order.
2018.17-1705,1,63114,glenn_l_hara,,2172.04,2173.0,No.
2018.17-1705,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2173.0,2178.84,"So you have a major question, it seems to me, of administrative law that applies major."
2018.17-1705,1,63114,glenn_l_hara,,2195.16,2197.44,"Well, Your Honor, as you said, nobody did argue that."
2018.17-1705,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2215.88,2216.2,It seems --
2018.17-1705,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2216.2,2228.08,"Even accepting that, though, why is this determining the validity of that order? Because the order stands today as well as it did yesterday."
2018.17-1705,1,63114,glenn_l_hara,,2283.08,2307.36,"I have two main responses. The text of the Hobbs Act, the plain meaning of those words, exclusive jurisdiction to determine the validity of, to determine is to decide, and to the validity of something is to determine if it's legally sound or not. And a district court is being asked to do that when it's being asked to decide this agency interpretation is inconsistent -- you shouldn't apply it because it's inconsistent with the statute."
2018.17-1705,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2307.36,2311.68,"But you'd agree that the regulation is still validly in force today, right?"
2018.17-1705,1,63114,glenn_l_hara,,2311.68,2313.16,You mean if the district court had --
2018.17-1705,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2313.16,2317.36,"No, no, the regulation is still validly enforced."
2018.17-1705,1,63114,glenn_l_hara,,2317.36,2320.52,"Well, no court has ever invalidated it --"
2018.17-1705,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2320.52,2320.84,Yeah.
2018.17-1705,1,63114,glenn_l_hara,,2320.84,2321.56,-- in this case.
2018.17-1705,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2321.8,2322.36,I'm -- I'm -- I'm a little --
2018.17-1705,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2322.36,2372.04,"Do you think that Yakus would be decided the same way today and not in wartime? Let's say that Congress once again sets up an agency to set all sorts of prices on goods that it believes fall -- that -- that -- goods affecting commerce, and the agency sets prices for home-grown tomatoes, maximum prices for home-grown tomatoes, and somebody raises heirloom tomatoes in the backyard and charges more than the specified price, and there's a criminal penalty, so that person is charged with the crime of selling tomatoes at a price that was over the -- the limit. Do you think that person would be prohibited from challenging the regulation? In the criminal prosecution?"
2018.17-1705,1,63114,glenn_l_hara,,2372.04,2374.08,Under Yakus -- Yakus is still good law.
2018.17-1705,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2378.28,2387.52,"But you think that would be consistent with due process? You would say to the -- to the person who was growing these tomatoes in the backyard, well, you know, you should have kept up with the Federal Register."
2018.17-1705,1,63114,glenn_l_hara,,2387.52,2394.96,"Well, to the person growing the tomatoes in the backyard, that would present a more difficult case than the meat wholesaler who presumably followed those regulations."
2018.17-1705,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2394.96,2395.08,Okay.
2018.17-1705,1,63114,glenn_l_hara,,2402.36,2403.0,That's correct.
2018.17-1705,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2412.12,2419.48,Do you know how many pages were issued in the Federal Register in 2018? (Laughter.)
2018.17-1705,1,63114,glenn_l_hara,,2419.48,2420.2,I do not.
2018.17-1705,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2420.2,2424.76,"I think it's something like 90,000 pages."
2018.17-1705,1,63114,glenn_l_hara,,2424.76,2424.96,Right.
2018.17-1705,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2426.64,2439.08,"I once -- I once saw somebody riding home on the Metro at midnight in Washington, D.C., reading the Code of Federal Regulations, and I thought: Only in Washington, D.C., could you see this sight. (Laughter.)"
2018.17-1705,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2439.08,2447.32,But you think people out in other parts of the country are -- they're waiting for the latest addition -- (Laughter.)
2018.17-1705,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2447.32,2449.4,-- addition to the Code of Federal Regulations?
2018.17-1705,1,63114,glenn_l_hara,,2449.4,2456.2,"Yeah, I -- I didn't suggest that PDR should be combing through every issue of the Federal Register, but I do think they should have consulted a lawyer --"
2018.17-1705,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2456.2,2456.44,"Well, is --"
2018.17-1705,1,63114,glenn_l_hara,,2456.44,2458.28,-- before sending their faxes in 2013.
2018.17-1705,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2458.28,2471.88,-- isn't the question here how to interpret statutory silence? Because we have statutes that have pre-enforcement review and then explicitly allow review in the enforcement proceeding.
2018.17-1705,1,63114,glenn_l_hara,,2524.4,2527.64,"First of all, I don't think the Hobbs Act is silent on it."
2018.17-1705,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2532.4,2537.56,"It doesn't say anything close to what the Clean Air Act says for barring review in enforcement proceedings, though."
2018.17-1705,1,63114,glenn_l_hara,,2537.56,2561.36,"It doesn't have the second clause, but I don't think it's necessary. Those two accomplish the same thing using different language. As to the -- the last point Your Honor raised, Justice Kavanaugh, one of the reasons why it has to go through the Hobbs Act process, and it's a reason that this Court recognized in the Port of Boston case, is that, under those circumstances, the attorney general is present there to represent the interests of the government."
2018.17-1705,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2564.36,2564.84,But --
2018.17-1705,1,63114,glenn_l_hara,,2564.84,2569.4,We don't have state courts and district courts across the country deciding telecommunications policy.
2018.17-1705,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2573.08,2576.24,And that's why -- never mind.
2018.17-1705,1,63114,glenn_l_hara,,2576.24,2576.96,Thank you.
2018.17-1705,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2576.96,2584.76,"Thank you, counsel. Ms. Kovner."
2018.17-1705,2,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,2584.76,2589.24,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: There are just four areas I want to cover."
2018.17-1705,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2660.84,2662.72,Prior and adequate it also says.
2018.17-1705,2,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,2662.72,2662.88,Yes.
2018.17-1705,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2673.2,2685.68,"Well, how is it -- how is it prior and adequate in this case? When the -- this -- the issue that is involved here didn't even come up in the original rule for notice and comment."
2018.17-1705,2,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,2689.4,2691.4,"So -- that's right, Justice Ginsburg."
2018.17-1705,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2749.92,2753.28,Do you have a view on whether the rule is interpretive or legislative?
2018.17-1705,2,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,2753.28,2755.72,We -- we don't think that's the right question.
2018.17-1705,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2761.32,2764.76,"Well, I'm assuming that an interpretive rule does not have force and effect of law."
2018.17-1705,2,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,2770.08,2770.44,Fair enough.
2018.17-1705,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2801.08,2826.48,"Yeah, but this is a major question, and it's bothering me. So -- so, look, the part you read, 703, as Justice Kavanaugh just pointed out, it says that judicial review does lie in agency action, which is very broad, is subject to judicial review in civil or criminal proceedings unless prior, adequate, and exclusive, three, and --"
2018.17-1705,2,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,2826.48,2826.92,Yes.
2018.17-1705,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2826.92,2829.68,"Prior, adequate, and exclusive."
2018.17-1705,2,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,2829.68,2829.96,Yes.
2018.17-1705,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2829.96,2838.64,So I would have thought that the answer to Justice Gorsuch's question and my question is clearly there wasn't an adequate opportunity.
2018.17-1705,2,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,2840.48,2841.24,"That's right, Your Honor, so I think --"
2018.17-1705,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2841.24,2842.96,But does it say that in your brief?
2018.17-1705,2,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,2842.96,2843.4,Yes.
2018.17-1705,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2852.12,2861.0,"And did the court there go into whether they were around at the time and they did this very thing, they did have -- they were persons aggrieved during that time?"
2018.17-1705,2,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,2861.0,2864.84,Petitioner never argued below that they were not --
2018.17-1705,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2864.84,2867.72,"No, this is sort of non-jurisdictional but close."
2018.17-1705,2,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,2898.56,2911.88,"Your Honor, I take the point that if the Court is of the view that the disposition of this case turns on issues that weren't really developed below or weren't pressed below, that it has the option of declining to decide the case and dismissing it as improvidently granted."
2018.17-1705,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2911.88,2912.0,"Well, why would --"
2018.17-1705,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2912.0,2927.72,"But your -- in your view, those things don't matter, do they? You weren't even -- would you now concede that if PDR wasn't even in existence at the time, the -- the situation would be different or if they are -- they were in existence, but they had -- they weren't involved in sending out faxes, would it be a different case?"
2018.17-1705,2,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,2927.72,2931.56,"So we think it would -- it would certainly be a different case, and then the question would be -- and, you know --"
2018.17-1705,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2931.56,2931.76,What would be --
2018.17-1705,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2931.76,2936.4,"Well, a case that would come out differently, not that it would -- of course, it would be a different case. Would it come out differently?"
2018.17-1705,2,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,2936.4,2946.08,"So that would present a difficult question under 703 on which we haven't taken a position. And the reason is, of course, this is implicated in a lot of, you know, the Clean -- Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act."
2018.17-1705,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2974.44,2974.44,And -- and --
2018.17-1705,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2974.44,2974.88,But you --
2018.17-1705,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2974.88,2982.04,"-- you're saying that this was never raised by any party, by any court below, that -- the exploration of that question?"
2018.17-1705,2,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,2982.04,2987.8,Petitioner certainly never argued we didn't have an opportunity. They just argued below this isn't determining the validity of --
2018.17-1705,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2987.8,2988.96,"So, counsel, as I --"
2018.17-1705,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2988.96,3015.32,"And similarly, on this question of interpretive, because I -- I would say that if it's an interpretive rule, by which I mean something without -- without the force of law, essentially guidance to the agency, guidance to various parties who are interested in the world, but you can't -- you can't, you know, say that somebody violated it and sanctioned them, something like that doesn't fall within the Hobbs Act at all. Do -- do you -- would you agree with that?"
2018.17-1705,2,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,3015.32,3016.96,"I think I would, Justice Kagan."
2018.17-1705,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3021.12,3021.2,But -- but --
2018.17-1705,2,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,3021.2,3022.04,-- the describing of the --
2018.17-1705,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3022.04,3027.36,"And we don't know really, because nobody argued below, whether that's true, is that correct?"
2018.17-1705,2,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,3027.36,3031.0,Nobody contested below that this was an order that's subject to the Hobbs Act.
2018.17-1705,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3031.0,3033.36,But you think it does have the force and effect of law?
2018.17-1705,2,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,3033.36,3033.72,We -- we think it does.
2018.17-1705,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3033.72,3033.88,Yeah.
2018.17-1705,2,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,3033.88,3035.4,"I mean, this is adopted through notice and comment."
2018.17-1705,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3035.4,3047.52,"So, in your brief, you also say that the general rule is that when a defendant's liability depends in part on the propriety of an agency action, that action ordinarily can be challenged in a civil or criminal enforcement suit."
2018.17-1705,2,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,3071.04,3075.68,"Well, I would really take issue with the idea that those other statutes are more explicit."
2018.17-1705,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3082.72,3087.32,"Well, but even -- I'm sorry to interrupt -- but even the statute at issue in Yakus had a second sentence."
2018.17-1705,2,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,3094.44,3104.6,"I think -- I take that point about Yakus, but I think if you wanted to look for a -- to a statutory framework that just uses the word ""exclusive"" and was around before Yakus, you'd look to the Urgent Deficiencies Act framework."
2018.17-1705,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3104.6,3110.44,"But, counsel, though, you know, you -- you -- you point us to the word ""exclusive,"" but there are more words after that."
2018.17-1705,2,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,3110.44,3110.6,Yes.
2018.17-1705,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3110.6,3111.44,Exclusive to do what?
2018.17-1705,2,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,3111.44,3112.04,Yes.
2018.17-1705,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3112.44,3113.88,And determine the validity of --
2018.17-1705,2,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,3113.88,3114.24,Yes.
2018.17-1705,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3114.24,3117.6,"-- is the language that we have here, and we don't have more than that."
2018.17-1705,2,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,3152.92,3168.0,"Well, let me -- let me talk about the language and then about the court's precedent, and I think that they both are -- are -- sort of contradict that understanding. I think every court of appeals has been right to say that you determine the validity of a regulation when you decline to apply it on the ground that it's substantively invalid."
2018.17-1705,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3169.2,3170.48,You're not saying it's substantively invalid.
2018.17-1705,2,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,3172.04,3172.8,Well --
2018.17-1705,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3172.8,3177.68,The statute -- I'm -- I'm being asked to interpret the statute. That is what the case is about.
2018.17-1705,2,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,3194.4,3213.08,"Well, I think it is, Your Honor, and if you look to the entirety of the TCPA, it says, you know, first, here's the substantive, you know, prohibition. And, second, the agency may make rules to implement that provision. And so, here, a party came before the court and said here is the rule that the agency has made about what unsolicited advertisement means."

2018.17-1705,2,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,3246.76,3249.48,-- do it with regard to jurisdiction.
2018.17-1705,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3249.48,3257.6,"-- who could, meaning let's assume -- and we can argue whether this is a clear rule or not, whether it's a legislative rule or an interpretive rule."
2018.17-1705,2,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,3278.48,3281.08,Not if it's an appeal from an enforcement action.
2018.17-1705,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3290.2,3295.76,"So that, too, explains Weaver and Functional Music."
2018.17-1705,2,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,3306.28,3306.8,That's right.
2018.17-1705,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3317.8,3328.92,"So you disagree with Respondents on that point? Because Respondents seem to suggest that once it got to the court of appeals, that court had the power to decide whether --"
2018.17-1705,2,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,3328.92,3331.56,"I -- I don't -- yes, I don't think that's right."
2018.17-1705,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3364.68,3387.24,"Can I ask a practical rather than strictly legal question, which is, since you're saying they can get judicial review, they just have to go through the motion for reconsideration or petition for rule-making, and the other side is arguing, well, just give us the judicial review and the enforcement action. Why go through all the hurdles of the former if it's just going to be judicial review in the end one way or the other?"
2018.17-1705,2,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,3387.24,3387.56,Sure.
2018.17-1705,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3388.88,3389.8,Or is there --
2018.17-1705,2,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,3389.8,3390.0,Yes.
2018.17-1705,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3390.0,3393.64,"-- something different about the judicial review in the former, which I think may be lurking?"
2018.17-1705,2,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,3393.64,3393.92,Right.
2018.17-1705,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3451.24,3451.4,And -- and --
2018.17-1705,2,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,3451.4,3452.08,-- think you would agree --
2018.17-1705,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3452.08,3453.92,"-- and that happens quite a bit, as you well know."
2018.17-1705,2,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,3453.92,3454.6,That --
2018.17-1705,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3454.6,3457.56,"And in that case, you'd be -- you'd be out."

2018.17-1705,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3458.56,3465.28,"In that case, you could be subject to millions in liability without ever having an opportunity to say that the rule is illegal."
2018.17-1705,2,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,3469.4,3478.8,"And in that case, I think you would have an argument under Section 703 that the Petitioner here really doesn't have, that I didn't have a meaningful opportunity to get review of the --"
2018.17-1705,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3478.8,3480.6,So let me stop you there.

If you had a party that really couldn't have done that for some reason, then I think you have a hard 703 question. Thank you."
2018.17-1705,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3503.6,3506.52,"Thank you, counsel. Two minutes, Mr. Phillips."
2018.17-1705,3,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3506.52,3546.12,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. I -- I think it's important to focus in the first instance on a question Justice Kagan and Justice Kavanaugh, you focused on, which is what is the standard of review if you go through the petition for reconsideration process? And this Court held in Board of Locomotive Engineers that -- that, under those circumstances, the courts reviewed the distinct agency action resulting from the new position. And it's only in very odd circumstances where the Court actually has -- has any kind of an opportunity to take up the underlying question of the validity or -- or of the relationship between the underlying statute and the old rule. And, therefore, it's not a prior and adequate remedy that gives you the basis for --"
2018.17-1705,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3546.12,3549.44,It has done it in Functional Music and in Weaver.

2018.17-1705,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3557.76,3558.68,-- enforcement actions.
2018.17-1705,3,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3558.68,3558.8,Well --
2018.17-1705,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3558.8,3560.68,"Well, one was an enforcement action, the other wasn't."
2018.17-1705,3,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3560.68,3560.88,Right.
