1979.78-1007,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,10.865,"We will hear arguments first this morning in Fullilove v. Juanita Kreps, the Secretary of Commerce."
1979.78-1007,0,38795,robert_g_benisch,,14.069,18.575,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1979.78-1007,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,129.626,144.814,"Mr. Benisch, does it make any difference in your argument whether Congress was acting under its authority to tax and spend or whether it was acting under its authority to enforce the 14th Amendment?"
1979.78-1007,0,38795,robert_g_benisch,,144.814,162.531,"I think, Your Honor, in looking at the legislative history and record here it makes a great deal of difference to observe what Congress was about when it passed the Local Public Works Employment Act."
1979.78-1007,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,172.166,179.899,Did Congress in this particular Act make any findings as to discrimination in the employment area?
1979.78-1007,0,38795,robert_g_benisch,,179.899,210.501,"I submit, Your Honor, none whatsoever, and that is the first prong to my argument, that indeed an examination of the legislative record and history discloses that there was absolutely no finding made whatsoever in the record or even in the discussions, of found discrimination on the part of the non-minority business community in the construction industry."
1979.78-1007,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,323.857,332.055,Why can't Congress just spend the money it raises by taxation in the manner it deems best?
1979.78-1007,0,38795,robert_g_benisch,,332.055,343.97,"Your Honor, the spending power, the cases have held that Congress cannot spend the taxpayers' money which is collected on a nondiscriminatory basis."
1979.78-1007,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,362.323,364.043,No one doubts that.
1979.78-1007,0,38795,robert_g_benisch,,378.327,379.549,I most certainly do.
1979.78-1007,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,435.882,445.843,"When you speak of Congress' civil rights powers, under what provision of the Constitution do you classify that?"
1979.78-1007,0,38795,robert_g_benisch,,445.843,456.414,"Well, there would be the 13th Amendment, Your Honor, and those amendments that have become known as the Civil War Amendments."
1979.78-1007,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,456.414,468.822,"When Congress appropriates money for aid to South Korea, for example, under what clause of the Constitution do they -- does it act?"
1979.78-1007,0,38795,robert_g_benisch,,468.822,471.539,When it appropriates money for South Korea?
1979.78-1007,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,471.539,473.57,For aid to South Korea.
1979.78-1007,0,38795,robert_g_benisch,,473.57,477.131,"Well, it is under its spending powers."
1979.78-1007,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,550.834,557.488,"Let me go back to the aid to Korea again for a moment, to a hypothetical problem."
1979.78-1007,0,38795,robert_g_benisch,,572.381,574.187,That would be true.
1979.78-1007,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,574.187,578.928,Is that not true in this area?
1979.78-1007,0,38795,robert_g_benisch,,578.928,582.304,"Your Honor, the key word here is ""racial classification."""
1979.78-1007,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,655.432,661.283,"What is a ""take note of the historical discrimination in the construction industry""?"
1979.78-1007,0,38795,robert_g_benisch,,661.283,664.015,"The courts below indicated that; yes, Your Honor."
1979.78-1007,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,664.015,666.884,"Well, do you think that there was?"
1979.78-1007,0,38795,robert_g_benisch,,666.884,672.111,"Your Honor, we are dealing here -- and this is not slicing the meat that thin."
1979.78-1007,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,673.406,674.836,How about my question.
1979.78-1007,0,38795,robert_g_benisch,,680.004,695.119,"In the construction industry Your Honor, I don't believe so with respect to non-minority businesses discriminating against minority businesses -- even the entrepreneur --"
1979.78-1007,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,695.119,702.891,Let us assume there had been that kind of discrimination in the construction industry and it was all over the Congressional Record --
1979.78-1007,0,38795,robert_g_benisch,,702.891,703.693,Yes.
1979.78-1007,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,703.693,706.204,-- hearings in some other legislation.
1979.78-1007,0,38795,robert_g_benisch,,710.931,713.324,"Are you saying in the legislative record to the Act, Your Honor?"
1979.78-1007,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,713.324,727.747,"No, I said in another -- you suggest that in this Act they would have to specifically take note of those facts and say that this is the reason we are passing this Act."
1979.78-1007,0,38795,robert_g_benisch,,727.747,728.397,"That is so, Your Honor."
1979.78-1007,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,731.109,738.991,That if they had done that you would suggest that at least first leg of the strict scrutiny test would be satisfied?
1979.78-1007,0,38795,robert_g_benisch,,738.991,743.106,"No, I wouldn't in this regard, if I may answer that."
1979.78-1007,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,842.035,843.086,Mr. Benisch --
1979.78-1007,0,38795,robert_g_benisch,,843.086,843.878,Sir?
1979.78-1007,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,843.878,848.324,I didn't persuade anyone to agree with me.
1979.78-1007,0,38795,robert_g_benisch,,848.324,849.854,I do.
1979.78-1007,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,849.854,851.373,Thank you very much.
1979.78-1007,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,851.373,853.344,"At what stage, Mr. Benisch, --"
1979.78-1007,0,38795,robert_g_benisch,,853.344,853.982,Sir?
1979.78-1007,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,853.982,864.202,"At what stage must these findings be made, including the judicial findings that were referred to in --"
1979.78-1007,0,38795,robert_g_benisch,,864.202,866.539,At what stage of the passage of the Act?
1979.78-1007,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,866.539,867.808,No.
1979.78-1007,0,38795,robert_g_benisch,,878.254,881.167,"I have no challenge of that, yes."
1979.78-1007,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,883.838,895.027,"But the language you read from Justice Powell's opinion referred to legislative or judicial findings, did it not?"
1979.78-1007,0,38795,robert_g_benisch,,895.587,901.996,"Well, but it was talking there -- it was talking across the board."
1979.78-1007,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,909.659,922.524,I am suggesting a judicial finding could be made then only in the context of a judicial proceeding such as a school desegregation case where the proceeding is initiated in the judicial branch.
1979.78-1007,0,38795,robert_g_benisch,,922.524,935.414,"I am submitting that where there is a challenge mounted to the particular activity or action passed by Congress, for example, that a judicial finding could be made; and that is what we are asking for here."
1979.78-1007,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,947.384,956.597,Is it your view that you would expect the Congress the sort of detailed findings that one normally expects a court or an administrative body to make?
1979.78-1007,0,38795,robert_g_benisch,,956.597,966.355,"No, I don't believe Congress would have to make the detailed findings, for example, such as findings of fact might require on a trial."
1979.78-1007,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1004.905,1015.55,"Mr. Benisch, what sort of findings would justify this statute; would they have to found that the Government was guilty of discrimination against minority business enterprises or that there was private discrimination?"
1979.78-1007,0,38795,robert_g_benisch,,1019.724,1042.736,"I believe, Your Honor, that a finding for example -- take it at the basic level -- a finding that there had been a perceived pattern and practice of discrimination on the part of non-minority businesses in the construction industry to exclude from participation non-minority -- minority businesses."
1979.78-1007,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1042.736,1046.784,Do you really think the statute would be valid if there were such a finding?
1979.78-1007,0,38795,robert_g_benisch,,1046.784,1063.229,"If there were would be, Your Honor, because we are not saying -- I am not arguing here today that Congress has no power perhaps to enact remedial legislation or that racial quotas are per se invalid."
1979.78-1007,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1063.229,1077.156,"What if there had been a finding that there had been previous discrimination against Presbyterians, could Congress say that at least 10 percent of this money must now go to Presbyterians?"
1979.78-1007,0,38795,robert_g_benisch,,1077.156,1087.052,If you consider the rights of Presbyterians to be a constitutional --
1979.78-1007,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1087.052,1092.537,The First Amendment and the equal protection clause of the Fifth is involved.
1979.78-1007,0,38795,robert_g_benisch,,1092.537,1093.287,I understand.
1979.78-1007,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1093.287,1096.491,Here we have only the equal protection component of the Fifth.
1979.78-1007,0,38795,robert_g_benisch,,1096.491,1096.965,That is correct.
1979.78-1007,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1096.965,1098.029,Not the First.
1979.78-1007,0,38795,robert_g_benisch,,1098.029,1099.303,That is correct.
1979.78-1007,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1107.487,1113.011,What is your answer to Mr. Justice Stewart's question?
1979.78-1007,0,38795,robert_g_benisch,,1113.011,1115.592,"I am very sorry, I have misplaced - I have --"
1979.78-1007,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1115.592,1121.358,"As I understood your answer to Brother Stevens, you said that this legislation would be valid if there were certain findings."
1979.78-1007,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1125.882,1126.405,Yes.
1979.78-1007,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1139.871,1143.356,Against Presbyterians?
1979.78-1007,0,38795,robert_g_benisch,,1143.356,1144.679,In this case I am speaking of?
1979.78-1007,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1144.679,1146.49,Yes.
1979.78-1007,0,38795,robert_g_benisch,,1146.49,1156.951,"If it was Presbyterians, if it -- if Presbyterians were viewed by Congress to be a minority which was entitled to protection, yes."
1979.78-1007,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1161.97,1164.955,You don't think the religion clauses are any problem?
1979.78-1007,0,38795,robert_g_benisch,,1164.955,1172.672,"Well, the fact there is a separation between church and state would be a consideration."
1979.78-1007,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1183.737,1199.789,"Mr. Benisch, supposing that you have a change of Administration and the Republicans came into power and they they had hearings and they decided in the prior Administration there had been a disproportionate amount of public monies spent by -- for Democratic contractors who contributed to the Democratic Party."
1979.78-1007,0,38795,robert_g_benisch,,1209.057,1209.657,I don't --
1979.78-1007,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1209.657,1211.565,"-- findings, if this was discrimination in the past?"
1979.78-1007,0,38795,robert_g_benisch,,1211.565,1212.768,"I don't believe so, Your Honor."
1979.78-1007,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1212.768,1213.147,Why not?
1979.78-1007,0,38795,robert_g_benisch,,1213.147,1228.093,"We are dealing here with findings which relate to and deal with compelling governmental interest and I don't think that a Democrat, Republican is a compelling governmental interest such as racial discrimination might be."
1979.78-1007,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1228.093,1233.802,Why less so in the context of Justice Stevens' question than in the racial context?
1979.78-1007,0,38795,robert_g_benisch,,1233.802,1247.501,"Well, Congress has perceived, and I think it is indeed well known that racial discrimination is violative of the Constitution."
1979.78-1007,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1247.501,1249.214,"Well, by hypothesis --"
1979.78-1007,0,38795,robert_g_benisch,,1249.214,1249.549,"Yes, sir."
1979.78-1007,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1249.549,1261.806,"-- Justice Stevens' question, as I took it, took Congress to perceiving that discrimination between Republicans and Democrats was violative of the Constitution."
1979.78-1007,0,38795,robert_g_benisch,,1261.806,1266.198,"Well, I would not be prepared to concede that point."
1979.78-1007,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1268.617,1271.525,You don't even need findings in my case.
1979.78-1007,0,38795,robert_g_benisch,,1274.787,1275.885,"Well, you haven't -- I think --"
1979.78-1007,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1275.885,1278.207,Does that raise a constitutional question?
1979.78-1007,0,38795,robert_g_benisch,,1278.207,1283.56,If you -- I think it might -- the Congress may be mis-using its spending powers.
1979.78-1007,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1283.56,1289.919,"Well, if it is, then if they did that for four years and they said we had better remedy what we did in the past, we will now give it to the Democrats."
1979.78-1007,0,38795,robert_g_benisch,,1306.247,1314.958,"Your Honor, my point was that the initial funding for the Republicans in your example would not have been proper; it would have been a mis-use of the spending powers."
1979.78-1007,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1314.958,1315.252,Right.
1979.78-1007,0,38795,robert_g_benisch,,1315.252,1325.787,The remedy therefore to make up and help the Democrats will simply be compounding the wrong.
1979.78-1007,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1325.787,1328.165,"I don't understand why, if you are just equalizing things."
1979.78-1007,0,38795,robert_g_benisch,,1328.165,1334.135,"Well, the cure is as bad as the ill in this -- in that example."
1979.78-1007,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1334.135,1338.023,But you conceded in this case that you are not as bad a deal.
1979.78-1007,0,38795,robert_g_benisch,,1338.023,1354.248,"In this case, yes, the cure is, because we are not with a situation in this case where Congress has acknowledged and perceived a violation of the Constitution on the entrepreneurial level in the construction industry."
1979.78-1007,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1368.171,1370.902,"Your time has expired now, Mr. Benisch."
1979.78-1007,0,38795,robert_g_benisch,,1370.902,1388.795,"Thank you very much, Your Honor."
1979.78-1007,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1388.795,1389.77,Mr. Hickey.
1979.78-1007,1,39431,robert_j_hickey,,1389.77,1390.671,"Yes, Your Honor."
1979.78-1007,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1448.0,1454.479,"We do that with students in schools who cannot speak English, do we not?"
1979.78-1007,1,39431,robert_j_hickey,,1454.479,1459.987,"I agree, Your Honor, that that has been done to remedy certain problems."
1979.78-1007,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1675.066,1677.648,"Well, I suppose an indian from India would have --"
1979.78-1007,1,39431,robert_j_hickey,,1677.648,1684.214,"And that also, the statute does not even say what Indians they are talking about."
1979.78-1007,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1713.595,1718.499,Do you suggest that we hold the statutes unconstitutional because they are badly drawn?
1979.78-1007,1,39431,robert_j_hickey,,1718.499,1724.837,"I think -- I would love to answer as a practicing attorney, but I am too realistic to believe otherwise."
1979.78-1007,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1741.588,1744.469,Has there only been one round of this?
1979.78-1007,1,39431,robert_j_hickey,,1744.469,1747.115,This is the first round of this.
1979.78-1007,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1753.079,1755.757,But has Congress done it more than once?
1979.78-1007,1,39431,robert_j_hickey,,1755.757,1762.512,Congress unfortunately has done it more than once but has not come up to the Supreme Court.
1979.78-1007,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1762.512,1768.436,"That may be, but Congress has done it twice, hasn't it?"
1979.78-1007,1,39431,robert_j_hickey,,1768.436,1771.381,Congress as far as using definitions --
1979.78-1007,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1771.381,1777.878,How about the set aside -- how often has it enacted a set aside?
1979.78-1007,1,39431,robert_j_hickey,,1777.878,1782.687,"Well, it has a small business set aside, it has had that for a number of years."
1979.78-1007,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1782.687,1785.767,Has this set aside we are talking about only been enacted once?
1979.78-1007,1,39431,robert_j_hickey,,1785.767,1787.528,1977.
1979.78-1007,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1790.318,1792.804,"And it is still going on, the funds are still going out?"
1979.78-1007,1,39431,robert_j_hickey,,1792.804,1796.735,"Well, that is the point, the funds are still going out."
1979.78-1007,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1796.735,1799.943,Have there been some more monies appropriated?
1979.78-1007,1,39431,robert_j_hickey,,1799.943,1802.789,There is still monies being paid out.
1979.78-1007,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1817.967,1841.016,"Are you suggesting that the failure to identify the Indians as American Indians, if that is what Congress meant, or the inclusion of Orientals as to whom no prejudice may perhaps be shown nor discrimination, is a fatal flaw in the whole legislation?"
1979.78-1007,1,39431,robert_j_hickey,,1841.016,1842.446,In this legislation it is.
1979.78-1007,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1936.951,1948.657,"Well, does the Governmental grant-in-aid to local and State and municipal governments, so they claim I suppose, if there is one, is that those governmental entities have discriminated?"
1979.78-1007,1,39431,robert_j_hickey,,1948.657,1950.926,The Federal Government pulls the strings.
1979.78-1007,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1950.926,1951.455,Yes.
1979.78-1007,1,39431,robert_j_hickey,,1951.455,1956.791,"And if the States discriminate, it is because the Federal Government allows it."
1979.78-1007,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1957.388,1959.397,"My point is, it is not even going to allow it."
1979.78-1007,1,39431,robert_j_hickey,,1959.397,1962.714,"That is right, and it hasn't allowed it and it hasn't occurred."
1979.78-1007,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1972.844,1982.907,"Mr. Hickey, have we ever held the Federal statute unconstitutional because Congress didn't make appropriate findings?"
1979.78-1007,1,39431,robert_j_hickey,,1982.907,1984.676,"Unfortunately, I would say ""No."""
1979.78-1007,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2012.538,2021.443,"In Katzenbach v. Morgan, certainly the opinion relied upon the fact that Congress had made findings, did it not?"
1979.78-1007,1,39431,robert_j_hickey,,2021.443,2031.711,"Oh, I think that the reverse is definitely true, it is that the Court has sustained action legislation on the basis of findings made by them."
1979.78-1007,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2033.302,2044.516,Would a finding that general contractors who obtained Government contracts have traditionally discriminated against subcontractors been sufficient to support the statute?
1979.78-1007,1,39431,robert_j_hickey,,2044.516,2051.409,"I would say not, because discrimination is not at that level, discrimination is on the Federal Government and the State level government."
1979.78-1007,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2054.134,2065.121,To comply with the 10-percent requirement if the State gave a contract to a general who assured the State that at least 10 percent of the money delivered to subs would be minority business enterprise?
1979.78-1007,1,39431,robert_j_hickey,,2065.121,2068.679,"That is why we are here today, we believe that is a violation of the 14th Amendment."
1979.78-1007,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2071.473,2073.897,"What is involved here, the 5th or the 14th Amendment?"
1979.78-1007,1,39431,robert_j_hickey,,2073.897,2076.094,The 5th through the 14th Amendment.
1979.78-1007,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2076.094,2077.629,"What do you mean, ""the 5th through the 14th""?"
1979.78-1007,1,39431,robert_j_hickey,,2077.629,2084.414,The due process equal protection clause is extended from the 14th through the 5th Amendment to the --
1979.78-1007,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2084.414,2085.96,Federal Governmental action?
1979.78-1007,1,39431,robert_j_hickey,,2085.96,2086.367,Right.
1979.78-1007,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2087.571,2092.92,And the Federal Governmental action is subject only to the 5th Amendment; is that right?
1979.78-1007,1,39431,robert_j_hickey,,2092.92,2095.324,"We do have both, Federal and State, in this case."
1979.78-1007,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2097.495,2109.707,"In Bolling v. Sharpe, which was the companion case to Brown v. Board of Education, the Court held that there was an equal protection component of the 5th Amendment."
1979.78-1007,1,39431,robert_j_hickey,,2109.707,2111.188,You said that in the Loving case as well.
1979.78-1007,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2111.188,2112.342,Right.
1979.78-1007,1,39431,robert_j_hickey,,2114.214,2115.023,And the 14th.
1979.78-1007,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2118.42,2122.926,The claim is that the Federal Government is compelling the States to violate the 14th?
1979.78-1007,1,39431,robert_j_hickey,,2122.926,2132.696,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1979.78-1007,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2132.696,2135.055,Mr. Days.
