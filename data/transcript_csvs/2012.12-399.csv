2012.12-399,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,6.404,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 12-399, Adoptive Couple v. Baby Girl."
2012.12-399,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,7.47,17.676,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2012.12-399,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,42.641,56.051,"Are you suggesting -- I don't know that the parties -- I know that the Government has said that (f) doesn't apply to the father, but (d) does, so there's not a full concession on your point."
2012.12-399,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,93.409,94.592,"Well, under State law--"
2012.12-399,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,94.592,96.861,I'm not asking about State law--
2012.12-399,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,96.861,97.111,--Right.
2012.12-399,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,97.444,98.361,--I'm asking about Federal law.
2012.12-399,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,98.361,107.317,"--Yes, it's Federal law, which requires custodial rights, would protect a father who has visitation, i.e., custodial rights under State law."
2012.12-399,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,110.535,113.154,"Well, (d) doesn't talk about custodial rights."
2012.12-399,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,116.089,116.406,--Right.
2012.12-399,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,116.406,116.989,--custody.
2012.12-399,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,116.989,117.456,Okay.
2012.12-399,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,148.91,167.388,"Well, you don't think that a parent with custody -- well, you do think a parent with custody is the only definition of family, but why wouldn't a noncustodial parent with visitation rights be considered a family with that child?"
2012.12-399,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,167.388,169.24,"My understanding under State law, a parent who--"
2012.12-399,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,169.24,170.842,I'm not going to State law--
2012.12-399,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,170.842,171.858,"Could -- could I hear her answer, please?"
2012.12-399,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,171.858,172.525,--Yes.
2012.12-399,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,206.848,210.15,"--Well, there is a support obligation on that unwed father."
2012.12-399,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,210.15,210.983,No.
2012.12-399,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,210.983,213.602,Why isn't that a parental right?
2012.12-399,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,223.475,230.131,"If a child is being adopted, by definition, the -- the adoptive family would be providing support."
2012.12-399,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,255.529,272.224,So what do you do with the States that do give unwed fathers that don't support their children and who don't have an ongoing relationship the right to be considered first for adoption?
2012.12-399,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,281.496,282.429,Because there's--
2012.12-399,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,282.429,282.796,As--
2012.12-399,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,282.796,290.602,--Because there's nothing in this Act that anyone can point to that was a basis for transferring custody to this father.
2012.12-399,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,333.448,338.183,Your -- your argument assumes that the phrase in the statute
2012.12-399,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,362.565,363.248,So he--
2012.12-399,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,363.248,366.533,--and they're taking the child away from him even though he wants it.
2012.12-399,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,366.533,366.866,--Okay.
2012.12-399,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,367.066,369.901,And that -- that is not the breakup of -- of an Indian family?
2012.12-399,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,369.901,372.937,--The only relationship the dad had is one of biology.
2012.12-399,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,381.809,382.176,"Oh, I see."
2012.12-399,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,393.516,394.216,"Well, I'm hanging -- I'm hanging a lot on two things."
2012.12-399,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,394.216,401.537,"I mean, it seems to me he's the father, the other woman's the mother, that's the -- that's the Indian family, the father, the mother, and the kid."
2012.12-399,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,401.537,405.824,He has a biological link that under State law was equivalent to a sperm donor.
2012.12-399,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,405.824,406.874,He's the father.
2012.12-399,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,406.874,408.36,And so is a sperm donor under your definition.
2012.12-399,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,413.947,414.964,This isn't State law.
2012.12-399,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,420.518,420.984,--Right.
2012.12-399,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,423.47,425.303,--What's the difference with a sperm donor?
2012.12-399,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,453.322,467.064,"--And assuming all biological fathers that are acknowledged or established are swept in, which would include any biological father, the only stranger in this case was the birth father, who expressly repudiated all parental rights and had no custodial rights."
2012.12-399,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,470.266,470.682,But he didn't.
2012.12-399,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,486.892,488.828,--It was too late.
2012.12-399,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,495.065,502.569,Where does it -- where is there a reference in the definition of “ parent ” to a State law?
2012.12-399,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,506.956,510.341,Section 1903(9).
2012.12-399,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,511.691,511.874,Yes.
2012.12-399,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,511.874,512.943,--on page 4A.
2012.12-399,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,538.841,548.283,"It says a parent means a biological parent of an Indian child, and he fits that definition."
2012.12-399,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,555.953,557.572,That's right.
2012.12-399,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,584.722,592.562,"But, Ms. Blatt, if he's a parent, why wouldn't some provision in 1912 give him some rights?"
2012.12-399,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,604.536,610.273,Because this -- this Act is not about creating rights that didn't otherwise exist.
2012.12-399,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,615.008,623.864,But what's the point of labeling him a parent if he gets no parental rights under the statute and if the termination provisions don't apply to him?
2012.12-399,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,623.864,626.247,"Notice, right to counsel, and heightened consent requirements."
2012.12-399,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,631.968,632.72,But what are they supposed to--
2012.12-399,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,632.72,633.62,So those are very significant.
2012.12-399,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,633.62,635.32,"--Well, how are they significant?"
2012.12-399,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,649.012,649.329,Right.
2012.12-399,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,649.329,651.114,--what are you supposed to do once you get notice?
2012.12-399,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,651.114,673.378,"Justice Kagan, just because he's in the door as a parent, that doesn't mean the statute let him leave out the back door with the child when there was no, no determination with respect to -- I mean, any kind -- it would be unprecedented to think that because you had a failure to remediate to prevent the breakup of an Indian family, that's a basis for awarding custody?"
2012.12-399,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,675.813,683.918,I think you're not answering the question of what's the point of labeling him a parent if he gets none of the protections that the Act provides to a parent?
2012.12-399,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,683.918,695.143,"--You're assuming that this entire Act was to make sure unwed dads who are Indian got more time than non-Indian dads to veto adoptions, and that had -- that's not even remotely the purpose of this."
2012.12-399,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,695.143,696.043,"Well, wait, wait, wait."
2012.12-399,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,698.328,701.214,1915(a) still applies.
2012.12-399,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,701.214,703.649,And so 1915(a) means -- that's right.
2012.12-399,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,703.649,704.415,Right.
2012.12-399,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,704.415,706.265,So he does have a -- a considerable right.
2012.12-399,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,706.265,707.201,"Well, 19--"
2012.12-399,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,707.201,709.217,"I mean, they'll have to go through a set and decide."
2012.12-399,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,718.742,723.127,--He's not -- he didn't seek to adopt the child and he's not one of the preferred parties.
2012.12-399,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,723.127,723.293,"Well, you're thinking about this case."
2012.12-399,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,725.76,728.112,"Well, no -- no father is a preferred party under 1915."
2012.12-399,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,731.547,739.151,Doesn't 1915 preclude the adoptive parents because they're not in the preferred category?
2012.12-399,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,754.912,755.312,--Right.
2012.12-399,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,796.256,814.551,"Is it your position that the preference is absolute or is it simply a factor to be considered with the other -- in other words, if every other factor suggests that the best interests of the child are served by placement with the adoptive couple, does the preference under 1915(a) trump all those other interests?"
2012.12-399,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,814.551,815.484,It's not our view.
2012.12-399,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,824.624,829.644,It's not listed under the -- there are guidelines for what constitutes good cause.
2012.12-399,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,829.644,833.629,"--The best interests of the child is not listed under the Government's guidelines, which again is extraordinary."
2012.12-399,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,840.768,851.074,"In -- in your view, at what point, at what date did the Indian father lose the right to ask for custody?"
2012.12-399,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,857.83,858.297,Yeah.
2012.12-399,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,858.297,860.43,The adoption proceedings had not concluded.
2012.12-399,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,860.43,860.932,Right.
2012.12-399,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,860.932,863.551,"And at this point he said, in effect: I've changed my mind."
2012.12-399,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,863.551,868.953,So State law is you have to support the mother during pregnancy or at birth.
2012.12-399,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,874.439,880.26,So the State law determines when his rights under the Federal Act end?
2012.12-399,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,880.26,880.643,No.
2012.12-399,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,895.686,905.294,Unless we believe that the Federal statute determines when he has parental rights by defining “ parent ” to include a biological father.
2012.12-399,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,905.294,905.994,"Yes, but you still have--"
2012.12-399,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,905.994,908.346,"If that's the case, then what you said doesn't apply."
2012.12-399,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,908.346,908.846,"--custodial rights, though."
2012.12-399,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,921.421,921.937,"Yes, I wanted you to talk about (f)."
2012.12-399,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,923.287,923.72,"Yes, and I do--"
2012.12-399,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,923.72,924.353,--Are you going to leave it to the Government?
2012.12-399,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,924.353,924.889,--No.
2012.12-399,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,924.889,926.189,"You don't agree with the Government's position, do you?"
2012.12-399,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,926.189,928.274,"Well, the Government agrees with us on (f)."
2012.12-399,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,975.086,997.266,"Ms. Blatt, continuing on the assumption that this man is a parent under the statutory definition, what your argument seems to be suggesting is that there are really two classes of parents under the statute, right, that everybody is labeled a parent, but then there are the parents who get the protections of -- of the termination of rights provision and the parents who don't."
2012.12-399,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,1006.972,1007.305,Yes.
2012.12-399,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1007.305,1013.642,It seems a strange thing to read into a statute in this sort of backhanded way that there are really two kinds of parents.
2012.12-399,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,1013.642,1024.282,"Well, I think it's rather completely upside down that this entire statute, with 20 or 24 references to removal, custody, return of child to the parent, is somehow being read to create rights."
2012.12-399,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1036.924,1037.991,"Thank you, counsel."
2012.12-399,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1046.697,1048.982,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2012.12-399,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1068.293,1086.405,"What do you do with the lower court's determination that one of the factors of the best interest calculus was the Federal policy to ensure that Indian children, children of biological Indian parents, at least one, should be raised with their parents?"
2012.12-399,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1100.064,1108.087,"--Justice Sotomayor, would that it were true that the Federal preference was one factor in a multifactor test that looked at this child in her best interest."
2012.12-399,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1115.341,1129.334,"--What do I do with the lower court's finding that this father, despite not being married to his prior lover, had children, was attentive of those children, had the resources to raise the child?"
2012.12-399,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1131.034,1136.17,"--What you do with that, Justice Sotomayor, is you look what context those findings were made."
2012.12-399,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1152.446,1154.982,--But they looked at something else that everybody's ignoring--
2012.12-399,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1154.982,1155.748,Please finish.
2012.12-399,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1156.365,1182.049,"--What the court specifically said is they looked at the expert testimony of how it would cause trauma, despair, anxiety, depression on this baby girl to be taken from her parents, and the court specifically said all of that was legally irrelevant because 1912(f) only lets you look at the harm from the new custodial relationship; it doesn't let you look at any harm from the breakup of the previous custodial relationship."
2012.12-399,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1190.069,1198.759,"Well, and even in that sense, serious emotional and physical damage is a much different threshold than the best interests of the child, even on the statutory terms."
2012.12-399,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1198.759,1200.027,It's miles away.
2012.12-399,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1249.527,1252.729,"--Mr. Clement, can I go back to that best interest calculus."
2012.12-399,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1300.809,1305.696,"--Well, Justice Sotomayor, I'm here representing the guardian who represents the best interest of the child."
2012.12-399,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1338.684,1345.938,"So we're going to freeze it at that point or are we going to freeze it today, after the child's been with his -- with her father for 2 years?"
2012.12-399,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1345.938,1348.821,--You freeze it at the time that somebody's talking about--
2012.12-399,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1348.821,1349.24,"I don't want to be that judge, by the way."
2012.12-399,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1349.24,1353.192,--You freeze it at the time that somebody's talking about changing a custodial situation.
2012.12-399,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1373.571,1376.557,"What about now, when you said the best interest."
2012.12-399,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1388.965,1390.467,"--Absolutely, Justice Ginsburg."
2012.12-399,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1395.952,1398.854,And I -- and I take it you'll say that that goes back to this South Carolina court if you prevail?
2012.12-399,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1398.854,1399.756,Absolutely.
2012.12-399,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1403.975,1428.925,"If the best interest of the child is the uniformly accepted standard in State courts, and if we forget constitutional avoidance problems which I -- I think exist here, is there anything in the statute that allows us to import the best interests of the child into the statutory language, or do we have to just rely on constitutional avoidance and -- and really rewrite the statute?"
2012.12-399,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1428.925,1430.575,"Well, a couple of things, Justice Kennedy."
2012.12-399,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1451.038,1456.592,Even though -- even though the guidelines to what's good cause do not include best interest.
2012.12-399,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1456.592,1466.298,"--That's right, but even the Justice Department doesn't say that the guidelines are binding or entitled to anything more than Skidmore deference, and I'd take constitutional avoidance over Skidmore deference any day."
2012.12-399,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1641.058,1641.975,So what do we do about that?
2012.12-399,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1641.975,1644.277,--You correct the lower court.
2012.12-399,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1651.181,1651.331,Finish the answer.
2012.12-399,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1651.331,1661.972,"You could -- you would either do it by changing the definition of “ parent ” and recognize that, given the consequences that flow from a parent in the statute, it only makes sense to prove something more than bare paternity."
2012.12-399,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1677.581,1678.331,"Thank you, counsel."
2012.12-399,2,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1684.504,1686.787,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2012.12-399,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1711.071,1713.421,Do you think that's correct under the Act?
2012.12-399,2,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1729.549,1734.351,"Well, I -- I think that there is some confusion as to exactly what the State courts did here and what ICWA does."
2012.12-399,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1770.36,1777.28,And do you -- you want us to write the case as if this is just a standard best interest determination and -- and this federal statute is irrelevant?
2012.12-399,2,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1778.564,1779.632,"No, no, Your Honor."
2012.12-399,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1803.714,1810.518,Do you apply a “ best interest of the child ” standard to a termination of parental rights?
2012.12-399,2,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1810.518,1811.853,"--No, not in the--"
2012.12-399,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1811.853,1816.655,"I mean, can -- can -- I know a lot of kids that would be better off with different parents."
2012.12-399,2,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1816.655,1820.709,"--And that -- that, too, is exactly right, Justice Scalia."
2012.12-399,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1831.498,1835.216,"Actually, it does -- does (f) apply in your opinion to this case or not?"
2012.12-399,2,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1835.216,1837.834,"Yes, it -- in our opinion, both (d) and (f) apply."
2012.12-399,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1837.834,1844.172,And (f) has something of the best interest standard tilted towards the Indian parent.
2012.12-399,2,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1844.172,1845.022,"Well, I think--"
2012.12-399,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1845.022,1846.388,Is that right or not?
2012.12-399,2,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1849.64,1857.163,"--I think that that's right, but I -- but I would add the -- the caveat that it's not a best interest in the sense of we are going to apply this standard to determine custody."
2012.12-399,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1857.163,1860.798,"So in your view the best interest standard does not apply, but rather (f) applies?"
2012.12-399,2,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1860.798,1861.415,(F) applies--
2012.12-399,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1861.415,1864.25,And (f) is a tough version of the best interest standard.
2012.12-399,2,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1865.418,1875.141,"--Correct, but with this addition: What it applies for is the question whether or not the rights of this parent can be terminated, whether the parental rights of the parent can be terminated."
2012.12-399,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1875.791,1876.976,"Well, how does (f) apply?"
2012.12-399,2,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1882.327,1885.629,--That is -- that is the other side's argument.
2012.12-399,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1907.309,1914.815,So your argument is not that “ continued ” means something different from the normal language; your argument is that “ custody ” means something different from its normal language.
2012.12-399,2,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1914.815,1921.386,"Our argument is that “ custody ” means what Congress said “ child custody proceeding ” means, which is termination of the parent-child relationship."
2012.12-399,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1937.179,1939.312,Could -- could I go back to what you just said about (f)?
2012.12-399,2,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1947.567,1955.24,"--Well, I -- again, the definition of “ child custody proceeding ” in ICWA includes a proceeding leading to the termination of parental rights."
2012.12-399,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1955.907,1958.942,But (f) doesn't say “ child custody proceeding ”.
2012.12-399,2,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1961.311,1969.317,"--That -- that's true, but I think that has to be interpreted within the context of the definitional provision and what Congress had in mind when it referred to child custody proceeding."
2012.12-399,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1975.554,1978.589,Tell me why you are fighting Justice Breyer?
2012.12-399,2,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2016.381,2016.964,--No.
2012.12-399,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2020.716,2021.816,You should if I'm not right.
2012.12-399,2,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2021.816,2024.218,--I don't--
2012.12-399,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2024.218,2035.859,But I think Justice Breyer is quite wrong because a standard that says results in serious emotional or physical damage to the child is far from a best interest standard.
2012.12-399,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2035.859,2036.709,It sure is.
2012.12-399,2,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2046.25,2047.083,--Absolutely not.
2012.12-399,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2052.654,2053.821,"But not me, right?"
2012.12-399,2,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2054.923,2058.041,--And Justice Sotomayor.
2012.12-399,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2061.076,2063.526,You might just have to take--
2012.12-399,2,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2063.526,2064.111,"Which gets me to five, so."
2012.12-399,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2083.938,2089.007,This is not -- (f) is not about terminating parental rights.
2012.12-399,2,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2092.878,2093.828,"--No, no."
2012.12-399,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2104.351,2109.503,"In what proceeding, the adoption proceeding or custody determination?"
2012.12-399,2,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2109.503,2112.539,--Any proceeding which is aimed at the termination of parental rights.
2012.12-399,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2151.849,2160.12,"If -- if you had a tribe, is there at all a threshold before you can call, under the statute, a child an “ Indian child ”?"
2012.12-399,2,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2175.465,2175.898,That--
2012.12-399,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2175.898,2186.004,"I mean, is it -- is -- would that child be considered an Indian child, so a father who had renounced any interest in her until he found out about the adoption would have all these rights?"
2012.12-399,2,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2186.004,2187.772,"--Well, that -- that would be a different question."
2012.12-399,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2189.322,2189.957,"No, no."
2012.12-399,2,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2191.957,2205.901,"--Well -- and the answer would, I think, be as a threshold matter, as this Court has said consistently, it is fundamental -- fundamental basis of tribal sovereignty that -- that a tribe get to determine the--"
2012.12-399,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2205.901,2210.119,I thought the definition of an Indian child is just straight out of the statute.
2012.12-399,2,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2221.677,2222.596,--That is correct.
2012.12-399,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2222.596,2237.272,"So return to what is a hypothetical question and not what the statute provides: Under your argument, a tribe that did not require any blood requirement, but simply enrollment, could be considered an Indian child."
2012.12-399,2,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2237.272,2244.776,"Well, the -- the child would have to be a -- would have to be biological parents--"
2012.12-399,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2244.776,2250.596,"Yes, you have somebody who has no Indian blood, he enrolls in my hypothetical tribe, has a biological child."
2012.12-399,2,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2256.25,2258.686,"--Well, that's -- that's true in theory."
2012.12-399,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2267.724,2269.843,But that is a problem.
2012.12-399,2,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2335.536,2341.69,"--Well, let me answer both that question and the Chief Justice's question which I think have similar responses."
2012.12-399,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2375.511,2381.165,Aren't there Federal definitions of approvals of tribes?
2012.12-399,2,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2388.087,2389.103,--That -- that is quite right.
2012.12-399,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2389.103,2395.507,And isn't one of the conditions of that a condition of blood and not -- not of voluntary membership?
2012.12-399,2,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2395.507,2396.291,As I--
2012.12-399,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2396.291,2397.443,I'm quite sure that's right.
2012.12-399,2,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2402.111,2402.93,--I -- I think that--
2012.12-399,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2402.93,2403.847,Well--
2012.12-399,2,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2403.847,2406.047,"--that's what I was trying to get to -- I'm sorry, Mr. Chief Justice."
2012.12-399,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2406.047,2412.633,--I'm just wondering is 3/256ths close -- close to zero?
2012.12-399,2,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2420.206,2429.078,But it has always been the Cherokee membership criterion that if someone who can trace their lineal ancestry to some -- to a person who is on the Dawes Rolls is a member.
2012.12-399,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2433.799,2446.44,"But what if a tribe makes eligibility available for anybody who, as a result of a DNA test, can establish any Indian ancestry, no matter how slight?"
2012.12-399,2,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2446.44,2450.492,--I think that that would lead to the question posed by Justice Scalia.
2012.12-399,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2453.627,2455.045,"No, it's different from his."
2012.12-399,2,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2458.497,2463.635,--But I -- I think it leads to his question that there is a Federal element to recognition of an Indian tribe.
2012.12-399,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2476.209,2483.213,"--Counsel, there are two forms of the EIFD doctrine, the existing Indian family doctrine."
2012.12-399,2,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2521.422,2524.207,"Well, I guess I'll give you two answers to that."
2012.12-399,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2545.287,2546.055,I don't disagree.
2012.12-399,2,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2546.055,2556.178,--It -- it would be sort of beyond the judicial competence to determine whether or not a particular person is Indian enough to qualify for treatment as a father of an Indian child under -- under ICWA.
2012.12-399,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2657.476,2666.818,"Is my recollection correct that -- that he had offered to -- to marry the mother, and she rejected that?"
2012.12-399,2,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2666.818,2668.618,--That -- that is quite correct.
2012.12-399,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2679.309,2687.063,"I thought that there's some ambiguity there, because one reason why he wanted to marry was that he would get more pay and allowances."
2012.12-399,2,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2687.063,2693.801,"--Well, there -- there are disputed facts as to what was going on, and so I don't want to hinge a lot on this."
2012.12-399,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2715.265,2723.255,"He was excited, but there is no doubt he paid nothing during the pregnancy and nothing at the time of the birth, right, to support the child or the mother?"
2012.12-399,2,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2723.255,2724.255,--That -- that is true.
2012.12-399,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2724.888,2727.473,So he was excited by it; he just didn't want to take any responsibility.
2012.12-399,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2728.407,2734.377,"Well, that -- that was after she had rejected his offer to marry her, no?"
2012.12-399,2,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2734.377,2734.71,--Yes.
2012.12-399,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2735.177,2742.481,"Well, these -- these considerations are why domestic relations pose the hardest problems for judges."
2012.12-399,2,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2753.839,2754.855,--That -- that -- that--
2012.12-399,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2783.189,2784.791,I don't know why you make that concession.
2012.12-399,2,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2803.853,2804.636,--That is quite--
2012.12-399,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2804.636,2806.637,"--extraordinary, not normal."
2012.12-399,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2806.637,2809.589,But is -- is that true under South Carolina law?
2012.12-399,2,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2809.589,2810.689,"--Yes, that is."
2012.12-399,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2811.672,2819.878,"Under South Carolina law in this adoption proceeding, the -- if it had not been for the statute, the best interest of the child standard would not have applied?"
2012.12-399,2,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2819.878,2823.513,--I think there are three things that are going on here.
2012.12-399,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2844.593,2851.166,He would be out under South Carolina law because he didn't support the child during the pregnancy.
2012.12-399,2,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2851.166,2853.316,"--I -- I have to disagree with that, Justice Ginsburg."
2012.12-399,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2880.601,2888.539,"Termination of parental rights requires a showing that it's an unfit parent, which is quite--"
2012.12-399,2,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2888.539,2893.426,"--That -- that is absolutely right, and no such showing has been made or could be made in this case."
2012.12-399,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2894.576,2895.961,You have an extra -- you have an extra minute.
2012.12-399,2,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2895.961,2911.904,"--The -- both of the State courts in this case carefully looked at the -- at the situation here and found that this father, far from being an unfit father, was a fit, loving, devoted father who had created a safe, satisfactory and -- and loving environment for the child."
2012.12-399,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2924.462,2928.599,"Well, if this case would have come out the same way under purely South Carolina law, then why are we here?"
2012.12-399,2,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2928.599,2935.603,--The -- the only reason that ICWA comes into play is because South Carolina law did not give this father a right to object to the adoption.
2012.12-399,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2935.603,2936.855,"Thank you, counsel."
2012.12-399,2,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2936.855,2938.722,"Thank you very much, Your Honor."
2012.12-399,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2938.722,2950.713,Mr. Kneedler?
2012.12-399,3,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2950.713,2953.314,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2012.12-399,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2990.822,2996.576,"But -- but -- did you -- at your -- when you began, do you use “ paternity ” in the biological sense?"

2012.12-399,3,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3005.432,3005.782,--Yes.
2012.12-399,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3005.782,3007.815,--not an existing parental relationship.
2012.12-399,3,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3007.815,3008.915,"No, a biological sense."
2012.12-399,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3010.85,3011.95,"It says that, doesn't it?"
2012.12-399,3,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3013.9,3014.333,--Yes.
2012.12-399,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3015.068,3015.702,That's what it says.
2012.12-399,3,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3015.702,3016.235,Yes.
2012.12-399,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3025.874,3043.669,"Well, family law is traditionally a State province, but your argument is that Federal law can take a traditional family law term like “ parent ” and perhaps others and give it a meaning that is very different from its traditional meaning or its meaning under State law?"
2012.12-399,3,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3043.669,3045.535,"--Well, several things about that."
2012.12-399,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3045.535,3045.935,Strike the
2012.12-399,3,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3047.871,3049.304,"Well, several things about that."
2012.12-399,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3068.634,3068.884,Wait.
2012.12-399,3,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3073.369,3073.852,--I'm sorry.
2012.12-399,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3076.904,3077.904,Okay.
2012.12-399,3,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3078.589,3084.074,What you have here are people who are citizens of two separate sovereigns.
2012.12-399,3,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3124.985,3135.109,"Mr. Kneedler, let's say you're right that this man is a parent under the terms of the Act, so not just a biological father but also he has a legal status as parent under this Act."
2012.12-399,3,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3160.658,3162.592,I think it's not two classes of parents.
2012.12-399,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3176.95,3178.719,That's a very strange way to put it.
2012.12-399,3,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3236.991,3251.067,"I -- I grant you it is somewhat awkwardly written, but we think the sense of it is -- is that, because this is -- as this court noted in the Santosky decision, this is a very unusual statutory provision with respect to the burden of proof."
2012.12-399,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3256.887,3267.093,"But doesn't it happen, in your interpretation, unlike the two parties who have an interpretation I can understand, that -- remember my hypothetical, which I deliberately made dramatic."
2012.12-399,3,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3318.795,3325.632,"--Well, the -- there's several -- several things about that with respect to the rapist and the sperm donor."
2012.12-399,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3327.567,3328.05,All right.
2012.12-399,3,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3332.969,3333.721,"--No, no, no."
2012.12-399,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3333.721,3334.354,--All right.
2012.12-399,3,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3354.485,3372.612,"It's -- it's not as anomalous as you're suggesting because state law standards still apply, and under state law standard under Santosky, there has to be clear and convincing evidence to terminate -- to apply the State termination of parental rights provisions, which is what the family court did in this case."
2012.12-399,3,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3377.75,3382.652,"But as a Federal overlay, Mr. Kneedler, I mean, does it make sense to sort of split apart (d) and (f) in this way?"
2012.12-399,3,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3407.769,3412.587,"--Well, with respect, I don't think so, because custody is in the one and -- and not in the other."
2012.12-399,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3435.603,3465.306,"But the whole thrust of it, you -- this is directed to providing remedial services, which it -- it seems that it fits a situation where someone has custody but is having problems getting his or her act together so needs the help of a social worker, but it makes no sense to talk about remedial services for someone who has never had custody."
2012.12-399,4,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3465.306,3468.174,"Not -- with -- with respect, Justice Ginsburg, I don't agree."
2012.12-399,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3493.708,3499.778,But he didn't want anything to do with the child if the mother had kept the child in her care.
2012.12-399,5,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3505.682,3509.901,--And that's -- that is precisely the point when ICWA kicks in.
2012.12-399,5,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3523.994,3532.083,But what's -- is -- is -- are the would-be adoptive parents required to provide remedial services and rehabilitative programs under (d)?
2012.12-399,5,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3532.083,3534.299,"No, their burden is to demonstrate that that has happened."
2012.12-399,5,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3535.385,3542.872,"So that it's a tribe -- if the tribe wants to defeat the adoption, all they have to do is do nothing with respect to the father's--"
2012.12-399,5,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3542.872,3553.263,"--Well, I -- I think the -- the family court could direct that remedial service -- this -- this happens, I think, frequently in family court, is the remedial services -- this is not an unusual provision."
2012.12-399,5,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3563.286,3564.319,"--Thank you, Mr. Kneedler."
2012.12-399,6,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,3566.155,3572.741,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2012.12-399,6,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3600.494,3615.237,"Counsel, this Act, in terms of voluntary surrender of Indian children by parents, says that it's not final for an adoptive parent until the court does the adoption decree."
2012.12-399,6,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,3625.043,3630.847,"--No, but this -- first of all -- I mean, I love that about this case, the irony here."
2012.12-399,6,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3690.802,3693.004,That was its intent.
2012.12-399,6,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,3693.004,3693.97,No.
2012.12-399,6,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3693.97,3696.306,You don't think that that's what its intent was?
2012.12-399,6,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,3696.306,3696.872,No.
2012.12-399,6,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3696.872,3701.024,It only applies to children of -- to tribal children.
2012.12-399,6,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,3709.029,3709.929,"No, no, Justice Scalia."
2012.12-399,6,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3709.929,3714.25,"--Now, maybe you -- you disagree with that policy, but that's clearly a policy behind the law."
2012.12-399,6,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,3714.25,3715.117,"No, I think the policy is fantastic."
2012.12-399,6,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3724.456,3724.973,It didn't say that.
2012.12-399,6,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,3726.491,3730.193,"There's 30,000 pages of legislative history that's talking about the removal."
2012.12-399,6,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3730.193,3738.883,"That might is what provoked the Act that Indian children were being removed from their families, but the Act is written in much broader terms."
2012.12-399,6,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,3738.883,3739.399,I agree.
2012.12-399,6,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3756.86,3757.71,"Thank you, counsel."
