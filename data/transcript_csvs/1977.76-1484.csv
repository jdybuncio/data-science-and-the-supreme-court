1977.76-1484,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,77.645,We will hear arguments next in 1484 Zurcher v. The Stanford Daily and the related case.
1977.76-1484,0,44365,w_eric_collins,,81.933,87.657,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1977.76-1484,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,648.516,650.443,If Mr. Collins --
1977.76-1484,0,44365,w_eric_collins,,650.443,651.486,Yes sir.
1977.76-1484,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,651.486,663.084,If subpoena duces tecum must be sought first for these other preliminaries and we decide against you and that would be the end of the case.
1977.76-1484,0,44365,w_eric_collins,,671.688,685.173,"It is certainly true Your Honor, that in the affidavit presented to the Judge Forbes, there was no sworn statement of the impracticality which in fact attended to this case."
1977.76-1484,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,685.173,710.809,"Then, we have to go on to decide whether the public statements of the Stanford Daily made previously that they would not aid any prosecution or preserve any evidence or submit any evidence that would help the so called political prosecution, we would have to then move onto that question?"
1977.76-1484,0,44365,w_eric_collins,,710.809,711.544,"Yes, sir."
1977.76-1484,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,770.821,778.187,"Mr. Collins if they destroyed immediately then you can't, what are you going to do then?"
1977.76-1484,0,44365,w_eric_collins,,778.187,793.294,"Your Honor, it is our hope that the Stanford Daily will not set a precedent for the remainder of the media, if they do, destroy it immediately, we obviously cannot get it, you are quite right."
1977.76-1484,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,801.87,805.843,I do not think that has anything to do with this case?
1977.76-1484,0,44365,w_eric_collins,,805.843,809.134,"Very well, Your Honor."
1977.76-1484,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,809.134,819.28,I just think that the duces tecum should do it without a search warrant; should it not?
1977.76-1484,0,44365,w_eric_collins,,821.6,823.263,Your Honor it is true the first --
1977.76-1484,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,823.263,828.677,And then there would be motion to quash and you could have it up.
1977.76-1484,0,44365,w_eric_collins,,832.455,835.607,"In any event, Your Honor they are going to have the day in Court."
1977.76-1484,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,835.607,841.339,They do not have the day in Court if you get an ex parte search warrant to come in and search.
1977.76-1484,0,44365,w_eric_collins,,841.339,844.123,"May I distinguish between two situations, Your Honor."
1977.76-1484,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,844.123,846.112,"Well, do so."
1977.76-1484,0,44365,w_eric_collins,,846.112,849.057,"In the one, it is undoubtedly true."
1977.76-1484,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,875.144,879.496,And then you do not need a warrant anyhow?
1977.76-1484,0,44365,w_eric_collins,,879.496,885.803,"Your Honor there are in this case, considerations that would indicate a warrant should be used."
1977.76-1484,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,930.195,936.133,"I do not know of any injunction, or anything else that can control all the mankind’s actions?"
1977.76-1484,0,44365,w_eric_collins,,936.133,938.478,I thoroughly agree with Your Honor.
1977.76-1484,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,951.469,957.659,If you wish to reserve any time for rebuttal and allow your colleague 10 minutes is it?
1977.76-1484,0,44365,w_eric_collins,,957.659,958.77,Yes Your Honor.
1977.76-1484,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,958.77,963.999,This would be the time to think about that?
1977.76-1484,0,44365,w_eric_collins,,963.999,973.962,"Your Honor, of course."
1977.76-1484,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,973.962,978.587,Mr. Booth.
1977.76-1484,1,38639,robert_k_booth_jr,,978.587,982.665,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1977.76-1484,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1048.899,1063.032,But would you concede that they are entitled to costs that the prevailing plaintiffs were entitled to costs in an injunctive action such as this where you say one of your clients was not even aware of it?
1977.76-1484,1,38639,robert_k_booth_jr,,1063.032,1068.389,"Not, as against Chief Zurcher, Justice Rehnquist he is not the proper party to this case."
1977.76-1484,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1070.19,1102.595,"Well, supposing someone is found to be the proper subject of an injunction because of his participation in an unconstitutional activity or his failure to properly supervise employees, something of that sort, so that an injunction issues although he really did not have any knowledge of acts for which -- on the basis of the injunction, if an injunction issues against him is the plaintiff entitled to costs?"
1977.76-1484,1,38639,robert_k_booth_jr,,1102.595,1110.159,"I think under those circumstances, yes Justice Rehnquist, but I do not believe under section 1983 that there is any such theory of the Respondeat Superior."
1977.76-1484,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1110.159,1121.674,"Well, so then your argument about it or the impropriety of awarding attorney’s fees is based on your contention that the plaintiffs should not have prevailed on the merits against your clients?"
1977.76-1484,1,38639,robert_k_booth_jr,,1121.674,1137.379,"No, it is based on the lack of a cause of action against my clients and also on where I believe should be an extension under the circumstances here, of the judicial and prosecutorial immunity because these officers were acting as agents of the Court carrying out the command of the Court --"
1977.76-1484,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1137.379,1157.161,The judicial or prosecutorial immunity is an affirmative defense which might not disentitle the plaintiffs to an injunction or declaratory judgment even though it might disentitle them to damages and if they were under those circumstances entitled to declaratory judgment would they also be entitled to cost or not.
1977.76-1484,1,38639,robert_k_booth_jr,,1168.999,1172.265,It is my recollection that it would be entitled to costs Justice Rehnquist.
1977.76-1484,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1184.718,1202.651,"Well, that is the problem we had after Edelman agaisnt Jordan, the old term preliminaries case, and this Court had said that you could award cost against the state, you cannot award damages against the state and either questions, are attorney’s fees more like costs or they more like damages?"
1977.76-1484,1,38639,robert_k_booth_jr,,1202.651,1215.151,"I think, when they reach this type of level and the circumstances under which they arise, I believe that they are more like damages."
1977.76-1484,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1230.824,1236.959,"Are all of these points litigated, the responsibility of each person that you were talking about?"
1977.76-1484,1,38639,robert_k_booth_jr,,1236.959,1237.948,"Yes, they were Your Honor."
1977.76-1484,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1237.948,1239.43,And they were held to be liable?
1977.76-1484,1,38639,robert_k_booth_jr,,1239.43,1240.287,"Yes, they were Your Honor."
1977.76-1484,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1240.287,1242.952,But what are you arguing about now?
1977.76-1484,1,38639,robert_k_booth_jr,,1242.952,1243.561,I am arguing that they were improperly held --
1977.76-1484,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1243.561,1244.639,You want us to --
1977.76-1484,1,38639,robert_k_booth_jr,,1244.639,1244.915,They were held --
1977.76-1484,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1244.915,1249.745,"Do you want us to reverse that hold, do we have to roll it back to the older stuff -- ?"
1977.76-1484,1,38639,robert_k_booth_jr,,1249.745,1256.768,I believe that is the case and I think you can do that by finding that there was no cause of action stated under Section 1983.
1977.76-1484,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1256.768,1263.367,But I am not setting to separate the attorney’s fees of the finding I think you have to give both of them that is all I was saying?
1977.76-1484,1,38639,robert_k_booth_jr,,1263.367,1264.723,"Well, I think Mr. Burger --"
1977.76-1484,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1264.723,1266.005,Can I separate them?
1977.76-1484,1,38639,robert_k_booth_jr,,1266.005,1267.433,"Yes, I believe you can Mr. Justice Marshall."
1977.76-1484,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1267.433,1269.173,And what authority they have?
1977.76-1484,1,38639,robert_k_booth_jr,,1269.173,1272.964,I think that there is -- regardless of whether a cause of action was stated.
1977.76-1484,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1283.609,1287.347,And what statute is unfair statute?
1977.76-1484,1,38639,robert_k_booth_jr,,1287.677,1293.936,"Well, it arises out of interpretation of the statute and I think the 1976 Civil Rights Act to amendments."
1977.76-1484,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1293.936,1296.652,Do you want me to use the Chancellor's foot on this?
1977.76-1484,1,38639,robert_k_booth_jr,,1296.652,1297.439,"I am sorry sir, I did not get."
1977.76-1484,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1297.439,1299.392,Do you want me to use the Chancellor's foot on this?
1977.76-1484,1,38639,robert_k_booth_jr,,1299.392,1300.536,"Yes, sir."
1977.76-1484,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1303.588,1306.115,How can you get me more than that?
1977.76-1484,1,38639,robert_k_booth_jr,,1306.115,1332.562,"Well, I do not believe that under the circumstances here where attorney’s fees were awarded in 1971, five years before the Act was amended and the circumstances of this case with summary judgment, never an opportunity to present defenses like good faith, and probable cause that it would be unjust to apply attorney’s fees regardless of the outcome of the remainder of the case."
1977.76-1484,2,30239,jerome_b_falk_jr,,1506.555,1510.58,Thank you Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1977.76-1484,3,44365,w_eric_collins,,3351.035,3352.393,Thank you Your Honor.
1977.76-1484,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3378.862,3385.93,You may have if you have that mind the opportunity to submit a response and comment?
1977.76-1484,3,44365,w_eric_collins,,3385.93,3388.702,Thank you Your Honor that was my request.
