2004.04-104,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,13.625,"We'll hear argument now in Number 04-104, United States against Freddie J. Booker and 04-105, United States against Duncan Fanfan."
2004.04-104,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,15.111,18.576,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2004.04-104,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,161.572,164.478,And you say we found no serious Sixth Amendment issue raised.
2004.04-104,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,168.381,175.152,"In the Edwards case, a Sixth Amendment issue and, I think, fairly including the jury trial, was raised in that case."
2004.04-104,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,184.274,191.704,"The right to jury trial is fairly clear and stark, and I guess don't recall that being argued in any of those cases."
2004.04-104,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,191.704,201.175,"Well, it was argued, I think, fairly clearly in the Watts case, I mean, there was a section... Watts, of course, was a summary reversal, so you have to go and look at the brief in opposition in the Watts case."
2004.04-104,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,231.334,233.108,That just proves they don't listen to me as much as they should.
2004.04-104,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,233.108,245.823,"--It may very well prove that, Justice Stevens, because you were very clear about the point, just to remind you, in the Watts case there were two cases before the Court, there was the Putra case, and there was the Watts case, they were consolidated."
2004.04-104,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,295.995,307.967,"Mr. Clement, here's the problem I have with the Government's argument insofar as it does not urge that we reverse Blakely, I know that you want us to do that as well."
2004.04-104,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,370.57,373.997,"With respect, Justice Scalia, I'd like to make two observations."
2004.04-104,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,401.489,414.577,"Can we just go back to the point you just made, it's a little different when the judge has discretion and there's no... the judge has discretion to take a whole bunch of things into account, but they're not quantified."
2004.04-104,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,442.728,456.391,"--Well, Justice Ginsburg, I think there... there certainly is a difference between sentencing under the Guidelines, versus a system of discretionary sentencing, or even a system of discretionary sentencing where the Guidelines have an advisory character, I'd certainly concede that."
2004.04-104,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,481.079,493.05,"Yes, but we're talking here about one precise role of the judge or of the jury, and that is, to find a fact that is necessary to keep you in jail for an additional number of years."
2004.04-104,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,533.584,566.156,"With respect, Justice Scalia, I think you've built in some assumptions into that question, because under our system, generally speaking if somebody wants to know what the maximum exposure for a particular criminal offense is, they would be well-advised to look at the U.S. Code provision that specifies what the maximum sentence is for that offense, because that is their exposure, that's what they're told about in their Rule colloquy if they plead to the crime, and if the judge makes certain findings, to be sure, upward departure, whatever it takes in a particular case, that is the maximum exposure that the individual--"
2004.04-104,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,566.156,566.649,It's not the maximum exposure.
2004.04-104,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,584.648,588.529,"--Unless the judge departs for some other reason, or the like."
2004.04-104,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,589.894,590.924,"No, or he makes a mistake in finding."
2004.04-104,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,590.924,593.525,"--I suppose that's true, too."
2004.04-104,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,593.525,594.146,He finds a gun when there really wasn't one.
2004.04-104,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,594.146,599.469,So there are different ways that you could get that sentence under the Guidelines system.
2004.04-104,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,615.776,623.949,"Suppose the determination, as is occasionally true of the Guidelines, is made not by the Commission, but by Congress itself?"
2004.04-104,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,653.095,671.588,"--I would not concede that, Justice Ginsburg, but let me first make clear that in the case before us today, the Guidelines that we have are promulgated by the Commission, and were not the direct or indirect result of a Congressional act the way that the, say, the Protect Act added particular amendments to the Guidelines, so that question is not directly posed in this case."
2004.04-104,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,735.284,737.225,What is the difference in effect?
2004.04-104,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,766.203,770.29,"I think it should make... well, I guess what I would respond to that, Justice Souter, is this."
2004.04-104,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,795.553,811.324,"Well, the practical effect is the same but in the moment before either in theory they commit the crime or in the moment before the trial is over or in the moment before the sentence comes down, there is one big difference in the two classes of cases."
2004.04-104,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,834.274,852.811,"Well, I think again, as Justice Stevens suggested earlier, I mean, that may be true if you focus in on that single fact under the Guideline system, but under the myriad of various ways that your Guidelines sentence can go up or down, it may be inappropriate under the Federal Guideline system to focus in on the point of analysis on that particular interval, of just the one--"
2004.04-104,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,852.811,853.304,Why not?
2004.04-104,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,853.304,867.793,"--Because, again, as a defendant, you may have a case where there are five or six potential enhancements, and there are five or six potential departures, and your sentence is going to be a product of the judicial fact finding that goes in, in making those various conclusions--"
2004.04-104,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,867.793,872.789,"And each one is appealable separately, each one is appealable separately, it's a separate legal finding."
2004.04-104,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,889.796,912.17,"--I don't disagree with that characterization of the Guidelines, but I still think that it is a difference from a pure statutory scheme, it's different from a scheme like this Court had before in Blakely against Washington, where the statute focuses you in on just a couple of factors and you really can re-conceptualize that regime as providing for a base offense level and one or two aggravated grades of the offense."
2004.04-104,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,919.889,927.691,"Well, the principal reason you can't, or I think the principle reason that you're advancing is, that the Guideline system is so complicated."
2004.04-104,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,940.49,943.666,"I agree, Justice Souter, and the point isn't that it's more complicated."
2004.04-104,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,986.929,1000.88,I find very little difference between telling him to evaluate it with regard to particular elements of a crime and asking him to evaluate it with regard to particular sentencing facts.
2004.04-104,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1024.247,1027.508,"Well, I think there are differences between the two."
2004.04-104,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1068.83,1088.686,"Is that complexity, is the key or, suppose these Guidelines were proposed by the Commission, just as they are, with all their complexity, but they were proposed as legislation, and then Congress enacted these Guidelines, would you be able to make the argument that you're making, still?"
2004.04-104,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1096.488,1097.52,--I don't think so.
2004.04-104,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1138.365,1145.945,"But that's not so clear anymore, it just happens that there are three members, but they don't have to be any judicial members, under the current legislation."
2004.04-104,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1145.945,1147.637,"--That's true, Justice Ginsburg, but there--"
2004.04-104,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1147.637,1149.039,"It's still in the judicial branch, right?"
2004.04-104,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1149.039,1158.494,"--It's still in the judicial branch, Justice Scalia, and there are the same number of judicial members on the Commission now as there were when this Court considered the Mistretta decision."
2004.04-104,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1192.096,1195.812,In Mistretta it might have come out the other way had it not been for that observation.
2004.04-104,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1195.812,1198.041,"I think that's exactly right, Mr. Chief Justice."
2004.04-104,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1235.11,1253.853,"The paradigm that the cases discussed in Blakely and in the cases leading up to it from Apprendi, are facts such as the amount of drugs, was there a weapon, was there violence performed against the victim."
2004.04-104,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1333.358,1346.937,"Justice Kennedy, I think that the thrust of respondents' position... they can obviously speak for themselves to this point, but I think the thrust of their position is in for a penny, in for a pound, that if you extend Blakely to the guidelines, then that's it, the guidelines go out."
2004.04-104,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1380.085,1384.377,"What, what, what tests would you propose, or the commentators?"
2004.04-104,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1390.943,1393.931,"Well, I mean, two things, Justice Kennedy."
2004.04-104,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1452.509,1467.204,"Mr. Clement, following up on Justice Kennedy's thought, if we adhere to the strict language in Apprendi itself, as quoted below, any... solely on the facts reflected in the jury verdict or the plea bargain, that's... that establishes the maximum."
2004.04-104,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1474.8,1477.772,"Well, Justice Stevens, let me try to answer it as best as I can."
2004.04-104,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1484.625,1491.313,"Well, let's look at the future and assume that in 97 percent of the cases which are plea bargains, you could agree on what the relevant facts are."
2004.04-104,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1502.292,1504.483,"--I'm not sure that's right, Justice Stevens."
2004.04-104,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1507.494,1519.094,"See, it's relevant because underlying all this is a question if the guidelines fail in toto, or do they only fail with respect to those relevant small number of cases in which there's a violation of the Apprendi rule?"
2004.04-104,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1519.094,1524.955,"I understand, and let me answer it this way, which is looking retrospectively at the data from 2002."
2004.04-104,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1540.065,1543.12,"In raising the issue, it depends on what... the issue you describe."
2004.04-104,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1556.356,1557.265,"--Yes, that's 65--"
2004.04-104,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1557.265,1558.38,Do you think 65 percent of the cases do?
2004.04-104,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1558.38,1561.824,--The numbers that we have is 65 percent.
2004.04-104,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1588.267,1590.375,"They all, of course, involve a potential upward adjustment."
2004.04-104,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1596.152,1607.686,"--Well, again, Justice Stevens, I don't know, because that comes to a second question, which is, if I understand your question, which is, we know that 65 percent of the cases raise a potentially, a potential Blakely issue."
2004.04-104,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1619.657,1621.97,"The thing that... I'm sorry, but I really, it's very important to me."
2004.04-104,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1638.454,1641.509,"Well, again, I can only give you the numbers--"
2004.04-104,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1641.509,1643.078,It's potentially that every case does.
2004.04-104,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1655.627,1657.651,"--Again, Justice Stevens, I want to answer as best I can."
2004.04-104,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1691.831,1694.31,"Well, as to past."
2004.04-104,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1725.972,1730.347,"Well, I, well let me try to address the remedial question then going forward."
2004.04-104,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1790.328,1791.981,"What is, what is the lawmaking part?"
2004.04-104,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1829.588,1833.553,"Well, with respect, Justice Souter, I think it is fairly ambitious judicial lawmaking."
2004.04-104,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1840.119,1841.028,What text do you have to take out?
2004.04-104,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1841.028,1852.424,"You have to take out the reference in 3553(b), that talks about what the courts find, and then it makes a definite reference to the court needing to find things in order to have upward and downward departures."
2004.04-104,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1852.424,1853.454,"It depends on what you mean by the ""court"", doesn't it?"
2004.04-104,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1853.454,1856.426,Just consider the word court to mean jury.
2004.04-104,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1857.746,1858.822,And I think then--
2004.04-104,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1858.822,1863.213,"Which... which is sometimes done, there are statutes that refer to the court, that--"
2004.04-104,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1863.213,1868.332,"--And as we point out in our brief, there are plenty of statutes that refer to the court in distinction from the jury."
2004.04-104,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1891.637,1905.649,"--It seems to me, when there is an ambiguity that construed one way creates a constitutional statute and construed another way creates an unconstitutional one, it's an easy call."
2004.04-104,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1905.649,1929.343,"Well, with respect, I don't think there's any way to avoid a potential unconstitutional system going forward, because if you treat these guideline factors that were clearly created by the Commission and in some cases created by Congress, on the assumption that they would be used for judge fact-finding, and then send them to the jury, then what you've done prospectively... it's one thing... let me put it this way."
2004.04-104,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1953.37,1958.216,"It just means that if a different procedure is followed, you'll reach precisely the same sentences the guidelines reached."
2004.04-104,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1958.216,1966.639,"Well, I actually don't think that follows, Justice Stevens, because I think taking guidelines that were clearly designed for judge fact finding and sending them to the jury--"
2004.04-104,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1966.639,1969.528,You think judges reach different results on factual issues than juries do?
2004.04-104,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1970.505,1970.96,--No.
2004.04-104,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1986.192,1994.094,"But keep it simple because we're assuming that in most cases, there aren't a host of factors but usually just two or three, such as the drug quantity and did he... a gun."
2004.04-104,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,2003.448,2004.768,"--I think it would, Justice Stevens."
2004.04-104,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2007.08,2008.566,Keep to the bad example I've given you.
2004.04-104,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,2012.753,2016.634,"Well, it might make as much a difference in the drug case--"
2004.04-104,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2016.634,2017.377,Would it make any difference?
2004.04-104,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,2017.377,2020.515,"--Well, here's how it could make a difference, if I could use the fraud example."
2004.04-104,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2020.515,2020.515,Okay.
2004.04-104,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,2020.515,2025.716,And then you may be able to see how it could or could not relate to the marijuana example or a drug example.
2004.04-104,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2033.146,2036.573,And there's a difference in sentence depending on the on the amount of money that the fraud involved.
2004.04-104,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,2036.573,2037.111,--In the number of victims.
2004.04-104,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2066.005,2067.864,In that case... let's take them one at a time.
2004.04-104,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,2071.911,2073.77,"--I don't think it would, Justice Stevens."
2004.04-104,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2073.77,2074.07,Okay.
2004.04-104,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,2074.07,2075.822,"But that's what, what I want to contrast it is with--"
2004.04-104,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2075.822,2078.239,--Now can you hand me a case in which it would make a difference.
2004.04-104,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,2078.239,2078.61,--Sure.
2004.04-104,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2113.989,2119.767,You don't think a very large fraud such as you've described could be proved through two or three witnesses?
2004.04-104,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,2119.767,2121.253,--I think it would be very--
2004.04-104,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2121.253,2124.12,If you used the Internet and they had all said... I am not persuaded.
2004.04-104,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,2124.12,2124.847,"--Well, I suppose--"
2004.04-104,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2124.847,2131.655,"And if it can't be, maybe the judges shouldn't go, be going around guessing how many people have been defrauded."
2004.04-104,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,2139.857,2157.084,"--Well, again, I think whatever else is true, what you would be doing with such a system is you'd be taking factors that I think everyone concedes were designed by a Commission that was upheld as constitutional precisely because it did not have the effect of creating new Federal crimes and statutory limits."
2004.04-104,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2157.084,2161.255,It doesn't make me feel any good if I spend another years in jail because of it.
2004.04-104,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,2164.97,2168.397,"No, I understand that, Justice Scalia."
2004.04-104,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2170.505,2171.248,May I ask--
2004.04-104,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,2171.248,2171.62,Sure.
2004.04-104,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2171.62,2174.303,--about practice experience in that regard.
2004.04-104,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,2201.879,2205.778,"Well, Justice Ginsburg, I think we don't have enough experience to know."
2004.04-104,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2231.313,2237.916,"I'm assuming that in the case of, say, perjury at trial, you couldn't possibly allege that in the indictment because you won't know."
2004.04-104,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,2237.916,2239.608,"That's completely right, Mr. Chief Justice."
2004.04-104,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2240.972,2243.777,They've got to be separately prosecuted.
2004.04-104,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,2243.777,2250.919,"And that's never been the under... I mean, that's true, there may be some cases that you could bring a separate perjury prosecution, but this court--"
2004.04-104,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2250.919,2252.572,"Well, I don't know of any case in which you could."
2004.04-104,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,2252.572,2259.797,"--Well, there may be situations where there's an obstruction of justice that wouldn't necessarily make out all the elements of a perjury prosecution."
2004.04-104,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2259.797,2260.002,"No, no."
2004.04-104,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,2264.461,2277.547,"Well, Justice Souter, with respect, I mean, this Court, both before the guidelines and after the guidelines, rejected the argument that the only way to enhance a sentence for obstruction of justice was to bring a separate perjury prosecution."
2004.04-104,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2277.547,2292.286,"And I, I would, I would take the same position today, unless you were going to define it, in terms of a condition that is both necessary and sufficient to expand the sentencing range of the crime that you are nominally prosecuting the person for."
2004.04-104,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,2293.151,2294.227,But that's--
2004.04-104,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2294.227,2294.477,Let me go--
2004.04-104,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,2294.477,2296.539,--That's what this Court had before it in Dunnigan.
2004.04-104,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2311.128,2320.976,"I've listed four categories of things that you think would be very difficult to prove to a jury at the trial, but not to a judge at sentencing."
2004.04-104,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,2378.273,2381.328,"I think that's a fair summary, Justice Breyer."
2004.04-104,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2394.787,2406.88,"All right, all right if I believe that that is just out of the question, it's so complicated, nobody could do it, it would be a radical change, Congress could never have intended that, what about a much simpler approach?"
2004.04-104,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,2453.237,2458.15,"Assuming I understand the approach you propose, there would be nothing wrong with taking that approach."
2004.04-104,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2458.15,2464.094,"All right, I have thought of one thing that might be wrong."
2004.04-104,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2464.398,2466.862,"Could it be that ""shall"" does not mean ""may""?"
2004.04-104,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2470.084,2472.806,"All right, well, I... you see nothing wrong with that."
2004.04-104,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,2531.301,2538.294,I would... I would take the approach that you should make the advisory... the advisory guidelines... the guidelines as advisory.
2004.04-104,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2551.651,2553.592,"Well, have you escaped Apprendi?"
2004.04-104,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2574.193,2574.603,--Absolutely.
2004.04-104,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,2597.265,2599.206,"--A couple of observations, Justice Scalia."
2004.04-104,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2665.975,2676.127,"Judicial discretionary sentencing, as I understood it, never permitted an appellate court to increase the sentence given by the district judge."
2004.04-104,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,2683.541,2691.881,"--Well, Justice Scalia, I can point you to the DiFrancesco case, where this Court approved an earlier Federal statute that allowed for appeals in sentencing."
2004.04-104,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2691.881,2708.599,"Well, that may be under statute, but I do not know, at common law, that when you talked about the discretion in the courts, it meant that in a criminal case a court of appeals could increase the sentence because of a... because of an abuse of discretion by the sentencing judge."
2004.04-104,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2710.707,2711.45,"Well, there are lots."
2004.04-104,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,2754.88,2759.764,"Well, I think our position would be that that kind of system would be constitutional."
2004.04-104,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2791.139,2794.92,That just seems so contrary to what Congress intended.
2004.04-104,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,2829.927,2843.795,"--But, Justice O'Connor, that's why, to be clear, we've only argued in favor of an advisory view of the guidelines if we get to the remedial question, because I think you're absolutely right, if you look at what Congress actually intended, it's crystal clear they did not intend the guidelines to be advisory."
2004.04-104,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2849.079,2859.664,"Well, what if this Court said the guidelines are unconstitutional, period, and then judges simply looked to the guidelines, figuring, well, this is as good an idea as anybody else has about sentencing?"
2004.04-104,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,2860.053,2863.38,I think that actually would be the proper remedy.
2004.04-104,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2866.064,2872.462,"And if it were done that way, why would it be that you would try to change the word (b)?"
2004.04-104,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,2888.255,2889.924,"--No, I think that's fair, Justice Ginsburg."
2004.04-104,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2916.862,2917.955,Which has the guidelines--
2004.04-104,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,2917.955,2918.598,--Absolutely.
2004.04-104,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2919.053,2921.282,--as one of other factors.
2004.04-104,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,2921.282,2921.653,Exactly.
2004.04-104,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2922.396,2933.542,"Except that that, as Justice O'Connor suggests, deprives the statute of its principal purpose, which was to constrain... to constrain judicial discretion."
2004.04-104,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,2962.52,2964.189,"--Well, I think--"
2004.04-104,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2964.189,2967.433,"I think there's only one where, where it may not work."
2004.04-104,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,2967.433,2978.867,"--Well, I don't see how it works in 3742(e), because if you read that section in context it's talking about determinations made by the court, it's talking about determinations made by the court after the presentence report comes in--"
2004.04-104,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2978.867,2980.248,That... that may be the one.
2004.04-104,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,2980.248,2982.172,--and so I think that 3742(e) has to go.
2004.04-104,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2983.165,2983.37,All right.
2004.04-104,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,2983.924,2987.389,"--Well, I think the fairer reading of 3553(b) is that it has to go, too."
2004.04-104,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2988.875,2989.125,Yeah.
2004.04-104,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,2989.125,2990.983,--I think you disagree with me on that.
2004.04-104,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3031.85,3052.033,"If you... if you interpret ""court"" to mean ""jury"", how many of the sentencing factors which will be submitted to the jury are... would be a radical departure from the tradition, the role of the jury in the criminal system in the Anglo-American tradition?"
2004.04-104,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,3052.033,3054.141,"I think very, very many of them."
2004.04-104,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3104.5,3106.895,"Well, you ought to get rid of that prosecutor."
2004.04-104,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,3108.753,3116.389,"With respect, Justice Scalia, I think if you look at that supplemental verdict form, and you look at the guidelines, there's no other way to do it."
2004.04-104,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3195.605,3199.859,"Mr. Clement can I... you don't have an awful lot of time left, and I want to ask you one rather important question, to me."
2004.04-104,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,3218.639,3227.351,"Well, Justice Stevens, I think with respect to the Sentencing Reform Act itself, the statute, the provision that we think needs to be severed is 3553(b)."
2004.04-104,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3231.028,3235.979,"Just sticking to the statute, take out 3553(b) in its entirety, you just--"
2004.04-104,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,3235.979,3241.819,"--Well, the specific reference to ""shall""... this is basically the ""shall/may"" issue... I think that needs to be severed."
2004.04-104,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3247.103,3250.53,--I'm just not sure what's left of the whole statute if you take that provision out entirely.
2004.04-104,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,3250.53,3257.96,"Well, I think, as Justice Ginsburg suggests, 3553(a) still stands alone as telling the court that it should consider that."
2004.04-104,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3271.624,3272.655,"Very well, Mr. Clement."
2004.04-104,1,42911,t_christopher_kelly,,3276.925,3283.119,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2004.04-104,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3320.393,3328.938,"Suppose that the judge had simply sentenced the defendant, let's say, to ten years, but looked at these other crimes and said,"
2004.04-104,1,42911,t_christopher_kelly,,3336.74,3339.219,Under the guidelines or under the--
2004.04-104,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3339.219,3340.621,"No, no, there are no guidelines."
2004.04-104,1,42911,t_christopher_kelly,,3340.621,3342.645,"--No, that is not unconstitutional."
2004.04-104,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3342.645,3342.95,All right.
2004.04-104,1,42911,t_christopher_kelly,,3376.287,3378.971,"I believe it would be, Justice Breyer."
2004.04-104,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3378.971,3379.342,You think it would be.
2004.04-104,1,42911,t_christopher_kelly,,3379.592,3380.047,Right.
2004.04-104,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3380.047,3387.122,"--now suppose the people who do it are the parole commission... as happen to be in the United States, executive branch officials."
2004.04-104,1,42911,t_christopher_kelly,,3411.793,3413.938,Parole commissions don't increase sentences.
2004.04-104,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3415.674,3418.003,"No, what they have is an indeterminate sentence."
2004.04-104,1,42911,t_christopher_kelly,,3418.003,3418.253,Right.
2004.04-104,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3418.253,3419.079,California.
2004.04-104,1,42911,t_christopher_kelly,,3419.079,3419.534,Yes.
2004.04-104,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3419.534,3420.565,"And what they say is,"
2004.04-104,1,42911,t_christopher_kelly,,3443.932,3446.494,"That is constitutional, Your Honor."
2004.04-104,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3447.32,3447.453,That's constitutional.
2004.04-104,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3447.453,3450.831,Does he have an entitlement to a certain number of years under any of these questions?
2004.04-104,1,42911,t_christopher_kelly,,3450.831,3452.438,--As I--
2004.04-104,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3452.438,3457.146,"When you're sentenced to an indeterminate sentence, he's not entitled to parole at any time--"
2004.04-104,1,42911,t_christopher_kelly,,3457.146,3457.146,--Other than venues--
2004.04-104,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3457.146,3457.518,--is he?
2004.04-104,1,42911,t_christopher_kelly,,3457.518,3458.344,"--No, not at all."
2004.04-104,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3459.004,3472.629,What I'm trying to drive at... and I'll be... is that I can't imagine a court holding that a parole commission in the executive branch that has exactly this same system would be behaving unconstitutionally.
2004.04-104,1,42911,t_christopher_kelly,,3485.01,3488.726,"--Well, perhaps I misunderstood your second hypothetical, Your Honor."
2004.04-104,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3498.347,3498.347,"You know, I--"
2004.04-104,1,42911,t_christopher_kelly,,3498.347,3500.576,"""you must... you must increase the sentence.... """
2004.04-104,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3500.576,3502.024,--I'm not raising the question well.
2004.04-104,1,42911,t_christopher_kelly,,3531.291,3543.263,The relevant constitutional principle doesn't have to do with whether it's the executive branch of Government or the judicial branch of Government; it has to do whether a fact is necessary in order to increase a sentence.
2004.04-104,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3543.263,3544.006,I understand that.
2004.04-104,1,42911,t_christopher_kelly,,3568.626,3569.557,No.
2004.04-104,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3569.557,3571.581,I would think the answer is no.

2004.04-104,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3624.892,3637.629,"But what is your position if judges simply have complete discretion to sentence within a maximum range, and Judge A gives a lot of maximum sentences, and Judge B doesn't?"
2004.04-104,1,42911,t_christopher_kelly,,3639.775,3642.541,"There is no Sixth Amendment problem with that system, Your Honor."
2004.04-104,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3642.541,3667.722,"What is it in our legal tradition... what policies are served by preferring unexplained, unarticulated, standardless discretion to a system in which the judge gives reasons and follows careful standards and follows... and follows standards that give consistency from one sentence to the other?"
2004.04-104,1,42911,t_christopher_kelly,,3671.148,3674.576,"I think, Justice Kennedy, that Blakely answers that question."
2004.04-104,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3686.093,3686.836,What policies--
2004.04-104,1,42911,t_christopher_kelly,,3686.836,3687.458,--give any particular weight--
2004.04-104,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3687.458,3691.006,"--are being furthered by that, other than wooden adherence to Apprendi and Blakely?"
2004.04-104,1,42911,t_christopher_kelly,,3691.006,3700.005,"--The policy is that if the judge's sentencing authority increases by finding of fact, which is not the case in a discretionary system."
2004.04-104,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3706.858,3726.177,"But isn't that, isn't that ultimately formalistic and contrary to our whole design of our system, which is to learn over experience and to codify and to explain what considerations we take into account in applying the law?"
2004.04-104,1,42911,t_christopher_kelly,,3726.177,3743.184,"--I don't think it's contrary to our system, Your Honor, to say that if a more serious sentence attaches to a more serious crime, or to a more serious version of a crime, then it's up to the jury to decide whether the more serious crime or more serious version was committed."
2004.04-104,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3744.837,3776.538,"So suppose, in Justice Breyer's hypothetical... like the California indeterminate sentencing regime which applied until about years ago, after an indeterminate sentence, the parole board interviews two people convicted for the same crime; one was the ringleader, street-hardened offender, and the other was just a novice, a guy that went along, although he... they both committed the same crime."
2004.04-104,1,42911,t_christopher_kelly,,3787.684,3795.735,"Yes, it would, because, again, under a discretionary system, the judge's sentencing authority is unaffected by the finding of a fact."
2004.04-104,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3806.964,3810.019,"Look, we're trying to go to the same point, and I think you're actually given me a pretty good answer."
2004.04-104,1,42911,t_christopher_kelly,,3810.557,3811.3,--Thank you.
2004.04-104,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3811.3,3815.675,--I'm imagining my system being the system that Apprendi forbids.
2004.04-104,1,42911,t_christopher_kelly,,3824.759,3825.752,I remember.
2004.04-104,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3825.752,3826.224,I didn't agree with it.
2004.04-104,1,42911,t_christopher_kelly,,3846.536,3851.632,"No, no, again, I'm not--"
2004.04-104,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3851.632,3860.244,"Now you understand what I'm doing, because I'm saying you either have to follow the force of your logic and make those unconstitutional, too, or you have to say there's a difference."
2004.04-104,1,42911,t_christopher_kelly,,3872.421,3879.441,"--Well, maybe I... maybe I don't understand your hypothetical, Justice Breyer, because parole commissions do not increase sentences; parole commissions decrease sentences."

2004.04-104,1,42911,t_christopher_kelly,,3881.066,3881.521,Okay.
2004.04-104,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3881.521,3883.395,--which I will argue a different point.
2004.04-104,1,42911,t_christopher_kelly,,3883.395,3884.205,Yes.
2004.04-104,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3884.205,3886.972,"I mean, I will argue it another time."
2004.04-104,1,42911,t_christopher_kelly,,3899.808,3904.638,It would certainly be unconstitutional for a parole commission to find a fact that increased a sentence.
2004.04-104,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3904.638,3904.871,All right.
2004.04-104,1,42911,t_christopher_kelly,,3905.121,3905.559,Yes.
2004.04-104,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3905.559,3909.291,And then the same thing is true of a... of a court of appeals panel.
2004.04-104,1,42911,t_christopher_kelly,,3909.291,3914.371,"If it could find a fact that increased the sentence, yes, because those facts must be found by a jury."
2004.04-104,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3914.371,3922.46,"Mr. Kelly, I would be interested in hearing you address some of the severability problems that the Government has been raising."
2004.04-104,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3922.46,3925.144,"If I could just ask one more question, because this is important to me."
2004.04-104,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3925.144,3925.432,Sure.
2004.04-104,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3925.432,3935.546,What about the previous California system in which it was an indeterminate sentence and the correctional authority made findings which set the sentence?
2004.04-104,1,42911,t_christopher_kelly,,3942.112,3942.522,Sure.
2004.04-104,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3942.522,3954.205,"--correctional authority for the term prescribed by law, and that was set after the fact, post hoc, by the California Adult Authority."
2004.04-104,1,42911,t_christopher_kelly,,3954.205,3961.636,If the agency were increasing an authorized sentence--
2004.04-104,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3961.636,3962.751,They're not increasing it.
2004.04-104,1,42911,t_christopher_kelly,,3962.751,3962.934,--on the basis of a finding--
2004.04-104,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3962.934,3964.198,It's an indeterminate sentence.
2004.04-104,1,42911,t_christopher_kelly,,3964.198,3964.608,--Right.
2004.04-104,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3964.608,3965.723,They set the sentence.
2004.04-104,1,42911,t_christopher_kelly,,3965.723,3970.143,After the... instead of the judge or after the judge?
2004.04-104,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3970.143,3970.481,Yes.
2004.04-104,1,42911,t_christopher_kelly,,3985.58,3989.462,If there were facts which were necessary to authorize--
2004.04-104,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3989.462,3992.556,He sets the sentence within the range authorized by the jury's verdict.
2004.04-104,1,42911,t_christopher_kelly,,3993.178,3993.921,"--Right, that's fine."
2004.04-104,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3996.521,3997.636,"Well, whoa."
2004.04-104,1,42911,t_christopher_kelly,,4013.444,4030.451,"Assuming that authority is given to the parole commission to select a sentence, and no further findings need to be made beyond those made by the jury, there's no Sixth Amendment problem with that."
2004.04-104,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,4030.451,4031.937,There might be a due process problem.
2004.04-104,1,42911,t_christopher_kelly,,4031.937,4035.009,"In fact, there might be a lot of other constitutional problems, but not a Sixth Amendment problem."
2004.04-104,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,4035.009,4062.28,"I hope you will go over to the... to the severability problem, because, as I understood it, you and the Government were very much at odds about what should be severed and what shouldn't, and we didn't get to ask Mr. Clement about his severance, which was going to be that to the extent no plus factors are involved, no sentence-enhancing factors are involved, the guidelines remain binding."
2004.04-104,1,42911,t_christopher_kelly,,4072.97,4073.797,Yes.
2004.04-104,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,4073.797,4075.942,"And why would it be so terrible to say,"
2004.04-104,1,42911,t_christopher_kelly,,4086.345,4088.658,"For a couple of reasons, Justice Ginsburg."
2004.04-104,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,4133.406,4139.721,"Is it any less uniform, any more manipulable, than on your proposal?"
2004.04-104,1,42911,t_christopher_kelly,,4139.721,4141.662,Our--
2004.04-104,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,4141.662,4142.406,"I mean, uniformity is gone."
2004.04-104,1,42911,t_christopher_kelly,,4150.207,4155.037,"--Well, I think our proposal doesn't really allow for any manipulation at all, Justice Souter."
2004.04-104,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,4158.769,4169.033,"Well, except that the manipulation, at that point, is the manipulation, in a way, in the present system, and that is it's the manipulability of charge bargaining."
2004.04-104,1,42911,t_christopher_kelly,,4169.033,4173.492,"Well, that's certainly true, and that exists under the guidelines."
2004.04-104,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,4176.714,4177.085,Yeah.
2004.04-104,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,4177.085,4178.117,It does exist under the guidelines?
2004.04-104,1,42911,t_christopher_kelly,,4178.777,4181.272,"I think it does, because--"
2004.04-104,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,4181.272,4181.56,How?
2004.04-104,1,42911,t_christopher_kelly,,4181.56,4187.755,"--Well, certainly, to the extent that prosecutors make decisions about what charges they're going to bring--"
2004.04-104,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,4187.755,4193.7,"No, only, only, only if you have statutes that have mandatory minimums that have lesser sentences."
2004.04-104,1,42911,t_christopher_kelly,,4194.443,4194.726,--Right.
2004.04-104,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,4194.726,4202.123,"But compared to the status quo, if you have the guidelines alone, one of their basic objectives was to prevent that kind of manipulation."
2004.04-104,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,4205.179,4209.47,"Well, hasn't charge bargaining simply been replaced with fact bargaining?"
2004.04-104,1,42911,t_christopher_kelly,,4209.47,4210.873,"It has, to a large extent."
2004.04-104,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,4210.873,4212.154,Is that lawful under the guideline?
2004.04-104,1,42911,t_christopher_kelly,,4218.592,4220.7,The judge is not required to--
2004.04-104,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,4220.7,4220.904,No.
2004.04-104,1,42911,t_christopher_kelly,,4220.904,4221.359,--accept the facts.
2004.04-104,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4222.473,4227.508,I'm not sure that I understand why you wouldn't have the same alternatives under your view.
2004.04-104,1,42911,t_christopher_kelly,,4244.598,4256.82,"I guess... I wouldn't view that as a two-track system, because the guidelines would continue to apply in either case."
2004.04-104,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4274.32,4286.292,"So you would say... you would say your proposal is closer to what Congress really wanted, because it would leave in place all of the sentences that would be commanded by the guidelines, but just require a different fact finder in some of the cases."
2004.04-104,1,42911,t_christopher_kelly,,4286.292,4288.066,"That's exactly right, Justice Stevens."
2004.04-104,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,4288.232,4302.721,"But then what about all the factors... Justice Breyer outlined four categories of, of guideline factors that are not easily, if at all, presented to the jury."
2004.04-104,1,42911,t_christopher_kelly,,4325.096,4333.391,--I agree that perjury is not something that could be submitted to a jury... perjury during trial is not something that could be submitted to a jury.
2004.04-104,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,4333.929,4335.332,So that would just be out.
2004.04-104,1,42911,t_christopher_kelly,,4335.332,4336.242,--That would be out.
2004.04-104,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,4337.44,4338.554,It would have to be prosecuted as separate--
2004.04-104,1,42911,t_christopher_kelly,,4338.554,4340.123,It would have to be prosecuted as a separate crime.
2004.04-104,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,4340.123,4342.352,Why couldn't you have a sentencing phase afterwards?
2004.04-104,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4342.808,4345.158,Could I interrupt for that?
2004.04-104,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,4345.158,4345.613,Sure.
2004.04-104,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4345.613,4346.727,There's one thing that's running through my mind.
2004.04-104,1,42911,t_christopher_kelly,,4362.581,4373.809,"I don't think so, Justice Stevens, because the judge is still making the finding that the witness deliberately lied, as opposed to being mistaken in his testimony."
2004.04-104,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,4388.67,4391.392,What is your answer to Justice Ginsburg's question?
2004.04-104,1,42911,t_christopher_kelly,,4447.592,4447.864,Sure.
2004.04-104,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,4447.864,4448.978,--and the complexity.
2004.04-104,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,4448.978,4458.433,"In other words, the tradition was that we asked the jury to determine what crime was committed, and the sentencing judge to determine the context in which it was committed."
2004.04-104,1,42911,t_christopher_kelly,,4458.433,4469.512,"And that still happens, even under our proposal, to a large extent, Your Honor, because the presentence report has historically guided a judge in exercising his discretion at sentencing."
2004.04-104,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,4521.713,4523.942,Congress's basic... that's a good answer.
2004.04-104,1,42911,t_christopher_kelly,,4569.618,4576.781,"--The real conduct can still be proved to a jury, as long as it's charged and proved to a jury."
2004.04-104,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4576.781,4579.632,How about the form of verdict under your system?
2004.04-104,1,42911,t_christopher_kelly,,4589.041,4592.18,"There may be, depending on the case."
2004.04-104,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4598.579,4604.606,"But you're suggesting, then, a special... a special verdict in every case where there are guideline facts to be found."
2004.04-104,1,42911,t_christopher_kelly,,4604.606,4611.582,--Just as special verdicts have been used since Apprendi to find drug quantities and other facts that increase maximum sentences.
2004.04-104,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,4611.582,4627.657,"--But a special verdict wouldn't do from the point of view of the defendant, I think would resist it very heavily, if what the findings have to be are, say, a much larger drug quantity, the relevant conduct."
2004.04-104,1,42911,t_christopher_kelly,,4651.995,4657.9,"Your Honor, I think we can trust district judges to fashion procedural protections that assure that trials are fair."
2004.04-104,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,4668.507,4671.314,"So you would have to have, then, essentially two trials."
2004.04-104,1,42911,t_christopher_kelly,,4671.314,4673.709,"--In some cases, yes."
2004.04-104,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,4673.709,4680.48,"Well, isn't it... isn't it... isn't that going to be so in every relevant conduct case in which the Government thinks the relevant conduct is a serious factor?"
2004.04-104,1,42911,t_christopher_kelly,,4698.518,4712.181,"Well, in some of those cases, Your Honor, the additional facts would come in on the main trail anyway, as 404(b) kind of evidence that is relevant to proving the underlying charges."
2004.04-104,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,4717.382,4738.809,"But isn't the defendant in that case going to say look, I, I'm claiming a serious problem, if you're asking the jury to make a specific finding that I committed relevant facts A, B, C, D, and E, even though I don't happen to have been subjected to a criminal guilty verdict with respect to each one."
2004.04-104,1,42911,t_christopher_kelly,,4759.53,4766.672,"--It's certainly possible that they'll demand separate, or bifurcation--"
2004.04-104,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,4766.672,4776.126,"Yes, but you wouldn't sit back and allow that focus, if you're the defense lawyer you're not going to allow that focus to be made at the time of the basic guilty/not guilty finding, are you?"
2004.04-104,1,42911,t_christopher_kelly,,4776.126,4777.629,"--Well, I've had experience with that."
2004.04-104,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,4801.223,4804.817,Do you know what the Kansas system is?
2004.04-104,1,42911,t_christopher_kelly,,4815.713,4820.171,I don't know if they bifurcate all their trials.
2004.04-104,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,4825.827,4837.715,"As long as you're on the subject, I'm quite... you're going to... what is your reaction to what I've written, which you've, you used to say wrong, wrong, wrong, but I want to know why."
2004.04-104,1,42911,t_christopher_kelly,,4883.701,4886.013,"Your Honor, here's how plea bargaining works now."
2004.04-104,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4945.085,4946.571,"Thank you, Mr. Kelly."
2004.04-104,2,40378,rosemary_curran_scapicchio,,4949.543,4963.911,"As to question one, there's no meaningful difference between the Federal Sentencing Guidelines and the Washington State Guidelines."
2004.04-104,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,5030.041,5031.489,So can I ask you the same question?
2004.04-104,2,40378,rosemary_curran_scapicchio,,5069.012,5072.622,If there's a fact necessary to increase the sentence--
2004.04-104,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,5072.622,5073.553,"Well, there is just what I said, just what I said."
2004.04-104,2,40378,rosemary_curran_scapicchio,,5073.553,5074.296,--Then yes.
2004.04-104,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,5074.296,5075.039,Okay.
2004.04-104,2,40378,rosemary_curran_scapicchio,,5075.039,5085.813,"With respect to Mr. Fanfan in this case, Mr. Fanfan's sentence was promulgated based on the jury verdict alone."
2004.04-104,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,5093.615,5095.267,Conspiracy to what?
2004.04-104,2,40378,rosemary_curran_scapicchio,,5095.267,5097.952,Conspiracy to distribute 500 grams of cocaine.
2004.04-104,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,5139.478,5145.506,"Judge Hornby had some distress in doing that, didn't he, because the difference was quite large?"
2004.04-104,2,40378,rosemary_curran_scapicchio,,5153.68,5168.745,"What Judge Hornby did for Mr. Fanfan was, he conducted what he called a presentence, a pre-Blakely hearing, and at the pre-Blakely hearing he allowed the prosecutor to present evidence relative to relevant conduct involved in the offense."
2004.04-104,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,5195.783,5200.053,"He didn't say it, that that was his discretionary choice."
2004.04-104,2,40378,rosemary_curran_scapicchio,,5200.946,5201.606,He was required.
2004.04-104,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,5201.606,5209.257,"--He made, he made those findings of fact, that... leadership role and the quantity of drugs."
2004.04-104,2,40378,rosemary_curran_scapicchio,,5209.257,5209.695,He did.
2004.04-104,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,5209.695,5222.698,"And on the basis of those two he said the guidelines would require me to come up with this higher sentence, not that using the guidelines as advisory he would have gotten--"
2004.04-104,2,40378,rosemary_curran_scapicchio,,5222.698,5223.275,Absolutely.
2004.04-104,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,5229.591,5240.365,"--And then the other, that's the high range, and the low range is, I'll just stick with the crime that he was indicted for, and that's five or six years."
2004.04-104,2,40378,rosemary_curran_scapicchio,,5240.365,5245.938,"He, what Judge Hornby did is, is he sentenced Mr. Fanfan based solely on the jury's verdict."
2004.04-104,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,5264.885,5269.881,"That's quite a windfall for Mr. Fanfan, isn't it?"
2004.04-104,2,40378,rosemary_curran_scapicchio,,5269.881,5289.05,"Well, in this particular case I would say no, because the Government knew when this Court decided Apprendi, and certainly knew by the time this Court decided Ring, that if they wanted to increase a defendant's sentence beyond the statutory max, that they should plead it and prove it in the indictment."
2004.04-104,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,5306.496,5314.669,Did the trial judge give any indication of what sentence he would have imposed if he were not constrained by the guidelines?
2004.04-104,2,40378,rosemary_curran_scapicchio,,5314.669,5316.405,He did not.
2004.04-104,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,5362.306,5366.643,"You wouldn't sever out the ones that would permit a downward departure, would you?"
2004.04-104,2,40378,rosemary_curran_scapicchio,,5366.643,5370.98,Would we sever the portions of the statute that require--
2004.04-104,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,5370.98,5374.239,You would leave in place the provisions for downward departures?
2004.04-104,2,40378,rosemary_curran_scapicchio,,5374.239,5377.212,--We would leave in place the majority of the sentencing guidelines.
2004.04-104,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,5377.212,5379.069,"Well, and... but could you answer my question?"
2004.04-104,2,40378,rosemary_curran_scapicchio,,5379.069,5381.587,"Mr. Chief Justice, would I sever out--"
2004.04-104,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,5381.587,5386.212,Would you leave in place the provisions for downward departure?
2004.04-104,2,40378,rosemary_curran_scapicchio,,5386.212,5386.738,--Yes.
2004.04-104,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,5386.738,5388.813,How can you do that?
2004.04-104,2,40378,rosemary_curran_scapicchio,,5414.447,5418.162,"Well, I think you sever it by severing out the unconstitutional portions of it."
2004.04-104,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,5425.321,5430.96,"But that's the same, that's the same provision that allows departures of the same... by the same procedure."
2004.04-104,2,40378,rosemary_curran_scapicchio,,5430.96,5432.363,"Well, the departures in--"
2004.04-104,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,5432.363,5438.762,"It seems to me you're not severing a piece of a statute, you're just severing a bunch of applications of the statute you think are invalid."
2004.04-104,2,40378,rosemary_curran_scapicchio,,5438.762,5446.358,--The applications of the statute that are invalid in this case are the ones that require judicial fact finding by a preponderance of the evidence.
2004.04-104,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,5446.358,5446.647,Correct.
2004.04-104,2,40378,rosemary_curran_scapicchio,,5447.101,5448.383,Those under Blakely need to be severed.
2004.04-104,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,5455.275,5469.764,"But would it... would it really save the guidelines in the way that Congress intended them, to strike basically the provision for enhancements, and leaving in place the provisions for downward departures?"
2004.04-104,2,40378,rosemary_curran_scapicchio,,5469.764,5473.768,It's not going to operate exactly the way Congress intended.
2004.04-104,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,5488.712,5495.854,"Well, maybe we should just leave it to Congress to decide, because it doesn't sound like the scheme Congress intended."
2004.04-104,2,40378,rosemary_curran_scapicchio,,5495.854,5500.063,"Well, Congress intended a mandatory system."
2004.04-104,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,5504.149,5511.291,And it intended fact finding by a preponderance for both upward adjustments and downward.
2004.04-104,2,40378,rosemary_curran_scapicchio,,5511.291,5515.378,--Not necessarily fact finding by the judiciary.
2004.04-104,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,5534.454,5545.311,"Well, but will there be proportionality if the sentences, sentences can be downward, the jury verdict could be adjusted downward, but not upward?"
2004.04-104,2,40378,rosemary_curran_scapicchio,,5545.311,5565.329,"If it turns out, Mr. Chief Justice, that there is some, some difference in the severity of a sentence that a defendant receives, certainly Congress could, could come in and make the appropriate changes if that's the result of the proposal that we're suggesting, but the proportionality wouldn't change."
2004.04-104,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,5569.787,5579.447,"But you can say the same thing if we simply said that the whole guidelines fall, and they're simply there for judges to apply if they wish."
2004.04-104,2,40378,rosemary_curran_scapicchio,,5585.557,5595.095,"But... absolutely, Mr. Chief Justice, it is true any time Congress acts, but in this particular case, the Government has the burden of proving the inseverability of the statute."
2004.04-104,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,5618.622,5620.768,Why do you... why do you have to call it severability?
2004.04-104,2,40378,rosemary_curran_scapicchio,,5653.795,5657.343,That's certainly an option that the Court could consider.
2004.04-104,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,5657.343,5667.846,"I'm just not sure, I share Justice Stevens' perplexity as to whether that's really properly described as severing part of the statute."
2004.04-104,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,5667.846,5701.76,"And may I add this thought, that it seems to me, I don't know whether this is true; Mr. Clement and I had a dialogue that was inconclusive; I had been under the impression, perhaps erroneous, that in fact the number of unconstitutional departures if one follows Apprendi as being the constitutional rule, is actually a small percentage of the total, and if it should follow that only three, four, five, six percent of the sentences that have heretofore been imposed or will be imposed in the future would be unconstitutional, that's a pretty weak reason for saying the whole statute is unconstitutional on its face, or even in one provision of the statute."
2004.04-104,2,40378,rosemary_curran_scapicchio,,5709.562,5717.901,"I, Well, I think because what's left is, is that the system will then be open to some manipulation, under that scenario."
2004.04-104,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,5727.726,5735.362,"No, my suggestion is everybody can be sentenced under the Guidelines; the only difference is that in three or four percent of the cases you may have to bring a jury in to get an enhanced sentence."
2004.04-104,2,40378,rosemary_curran_scapicchio,,5735.362,5743.99,"In, under that scenario, if any fact that needed to increase a defendant's sentence was pled and proved to a jury, that would suffice."
2004.04-104,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,5743.99,5747.873,"You wouldn't care whether you call this severing, severability or not, would you?"
2004.04-104,2,40378,rosemary_curran_scapicchio,,5747.873,5748.449,Absolutely not.
2004.04-104,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,5748.449,5749.459,I didn't think you would.
2004.04-104,2,40378,rosemary_curran_scapicchio,,5749.459,5756.046,"It produces the same results, whether it's, you call it severance or the way that the statute works."
2004.04-104,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,5756.046,5760.626,"And I assume, don't you, that any solution we come up to is likely to be an interim solution anyway?"
2004.04-104,2,40378,rosemary_curran_scapicchio,,5760.626,5768.139,It's very likely to be interim solution and the legislature will tell us what they really want us to do and we'll all make the appropriate adjustments.
2004.04-104,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,5768.139,5773.795,But the idea is that this works because most cases are plea bargained.
2004.04-104,2,40378,rosemary_curran_scapicchio,,5773.795,5775.653,Most cases are plea bargained.
2004.04-104,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,5775.653,5800.71,"So what you'll do if you're right, is all you would say is any time that the prosecutor wants to say that you committed the bank robbery or you committed the drug offense with more than a minimal amount of money or more than a minimal amount of drug, or there were guns, they get into a bargain, and they end up with a sentence once they bargain... if that's the sentence, because they're not even going to contest it before the judge, both sides will come in and agree."
2004.04-104,2,40378,rosemary_curran_scapicchio,,5805.912,5806.655,Yes.
2004.04-104,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,5806.655,5826.429,"Now, the only reason that I find it disturbing is to think that Congress could have wanted such a system is given other developments in Congress, mandatory minimums and all kinds of things, that seems to me to be a system that would really, might make non-uniformity in reality, worse than it was before 1986."
2004.04-104,2,40378,rosemary_curran_scapicchio,,5837.947,5838.568,The--
2004.04-104,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,5838.568,5842.859,--Should we uphold something like that in the face of a Congress that wanted uniformity?
2004.04-104,2,40378,rosemary_curran_scapicchio,,5842.859,5845.255,"--Yes, and I'll tell you why."
2004.04-104,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,5878.442,5889.178,"Did you find out anything in your research on this where anybody in the... this discussion of the guidelines began, I think, in the early 70's, it's been around for 30 years."
2004.04-104,2,40378,rosemary_curran_scapicchio,,5913.076,5916.048,Before quite... before this Court's decision in Apprendi?
2004.04-104,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,5916.048,5917.041,"Yeah, before we began with Apprendi?"
2004.04-104,2,40378,rosemary_curran_scapicchio,,5917.041,5918.777,I don't believe so.
2004.04-104,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,5918.777,5919.065,Nothing.
2004.04-104,2,40378,rosemary_curran_scapicchio,,5919.065,5920.013,I'm not aware of any.
2004.04-104,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,5920.013,5925.669,Have you read Justice Thomas's opinion in Apprendi?
2004.04-104,2,40378,rosemary_curran_scapicchio,,5931.409,5950.894,"And with respect to Mr. Fanfan in this case, Your Honors, we're asking that this Court give intelligible content to the jury's verdict by finding the district court's imposition of a 78-month sentence based solely on the facts found by the jury beyond a reasonable doubt."
2004.04-104,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,5950.894,5952.586,"May I ask just one, one last question?"
2004.04-104,2,40378,rosemary_curran_scapicchio,,5965.839,5968.523,Within the guideline range?
2004.04-104,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,5969.599,5975.21,"You get to the range by the jury finding, the judge still retains substantial discretion within the, within the range."
2004.04-104,2,40378,rosemary_curran_scapicchio,,5975.21,5976.862,"Substantial discretion within the range, yes."
2004.04-104,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,5979.276,5981.238,Thank you Ms. Scapicchio.
2004.04-104,3,37772,paul_d_clement,,6251.089,5986.439,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2004.04-104,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,6251.832,6254.227,"Thank you, Mr. Clement, the case is submitted."
