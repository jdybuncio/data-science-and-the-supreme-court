2003.02-763,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,7.225,"We'll hear argument now in No. 02-763, Jo Anne Barnhart v. Pauline Thomas."
2003.02-763,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,9.371,15.687,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2003.02-763,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,66.752,79.855,"Mr. Lamken, this case, I think, involves provisions of both title II and title XVI of the act, and there are regulations under each."
2003.02-763,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,79.855,81.241,That is correct.
2003.02-763,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,81.734,88.588,"Now, are there any relevant differences in the text of the two statutes or the regs on this issue?"
2003.02-763,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,88.588,89.536,"--No, Your Honor."
2003.02-763,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,118.847,119.507,But on the test.
2003.02-763,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,119.507,121.532,"On the test, it is an identical test."
2003.02-763,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,121.532,122.108,There's no difference.
2003.02-763,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,122.108,123.305,"There is no test, Justice O'Connor."
2003.02-763,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,123.305,123.827,Thank you.
2003.02-763,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,123.827,134.451,"That construction preserves the distinction long recognized in the commissioner's regulations, in fact, recognizing the commissioner's regulations from the earliest days of administering this statute."
2003.02-763,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,249.955,263.247,I have a... a question about the consistency of the argument you're now making with the... with the commissioner's regulation concerning you don't go back more than 15 years.
2003.02-763,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,278.562,281.246,"Justice O'Connor, the concern of that 15-year--"
2003.02-763,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,281.246,282.089,I'm Justice Ginsburg.
2003.02-763,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,282.089,284.506,"--Oh, Justice Ginsburg."
2003.02-763,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,337.845,340.938,"May I ask this question just about the facts of this case, Mr. Lamken?"
2003.02-763,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,353.82,354.396,--That's correct.
2003.02-763,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,358.361,366.202,"If the absence of elevator jobs had occurred earlier and she hadn't been able to find this job, she would clearly be disabled, wouldn't she?"
2003.02-763,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,366.202,369.545,"No, Justice Stevens, I'm not sure that she would be found disabled."
2003.02-763,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,373.715,374.541,She would have made the fifth step.
2003.02-763,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,374.541,387.34,"--If you were not to consider the... the previous work of an elevator operator and you only applied the fifth step, which is the other work step, in isolation, that's correct, that she would have been found not able to do other work in the national economy."
2003.02-763,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,412.891,424.902,"See, the thought that was running through my mind, just to put it on the table, is that in a sense perhaps the Government's position creates a disincentive to look for other marginal jobs when you're in this position."
2003.02-763,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,426.925,436.13,"Justice Stevens, the commissioner's rules actually take into account incentives to look for work through the unsuccessful work attempt regulations."
2003.02-763,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,453.592,456.647,Capable of working in a disappearing species of jobs.
2003.02-763,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,456.647,463.54,"--Well, Justice Stevens, the key point about the court of appeals decision is not limited to cases of job obsolescence."
2003.02-763,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,479.143,487.111,"Suppose in Justice Stevens' hypothetical the employer said, you know, you can operate the elevator but it's just going to be going for 6 months."
2003.02-763,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,490.91,492.147,Right.
2003.02-763,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,492.147,495.59,Then... then is she again barred under step four?
2003.02-763,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,495.59,504.49,"Justice Kennedy, that would... it would depend on whether or not that sort of a temporary position would qualify as substantial, gainful work under the commissioner's regulations."
2003.02-763,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,516.006,516.294,"No, no."
2003.02-763,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,519.162,521.951,--If this is something--
2003.02-763,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,521.951,530.951,"Everybody knows it's a... it's a job that's soon to be obsolete, and she's told that."
2003.02-763,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,530.951,532.975,"--Justice Kennedy, I think--"
2003.02-763,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,532.975,534.128,She'd be better off not taking that job.
2003.02-763,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,534.128,536.069,--In terms of getting--
2003.02-763,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,536.069,538.176,Or suppose... or... or suppose she didn't take that job.
2003.02-763,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,539.224,549.444,"--If the... if she did take the job, Justice Kennedy, and the job represented functioning at a level that's consistent with work generally that is substantial, gainful work, she would be barred."
2003.02-763,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,570.166,570.466,Yes.
2003.02-763,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,587.05,589.94,"That's correct, Justice Ginsburg."
2003.02-763,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,656.609,657.352,"Very well, Mr. Lamken."
2003.02-763,1,15435,abraham_s_alter,,659.702,664.903,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2003.02-763,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,754.811,757.783,But your... no.
2003.02-763,1,15435,abraham_s_alter,,786.573,788.331,"That is correct, Justice Scalia."
2003.02-763,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,788.331,793.799,So it seems to me it's your position that... that presents a really extraordinary situation.
2003.02-763,1,15435,abraham_s_alter,,821.358,825.157,"That is exactly what I'm saying, Judge Scalia... Justice Scalia."
2003.02-763,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,877.663,897.436,"The commissioner has explained that it's... using this test, can you perform your most recent job, as a proxy for instead of testing people to see the range of light work that exists in the economy."
2003.02-763,1,15435,abraham_s_alter,,924.352,929.432,"--Justice Ginsburg, your rendition of the commissioner's argument is exactly correct."
2003.02-763,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,942.517,944.375,In substantial numbers in the national economy.
2003.02-763,1,15435,abraham_s_alter,,944.375,944.746,--National economy.
2003.02-763,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,944.746,947.635,The very job may exist and be open for her to take.
2003.02-763,1,15435,abraham_s_alter,,947.635,950.486,"Correct, but in most cases it wouldn't be open for her to take."
2003.02-763,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,986.19,986.812,"Well, it's not according to the commissioner."
2003.02-763,1,15435,abraham_s_alter,,1055.997,1057.688,"On the contrary, Your Honor."
2003.02-763,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1107.556,1111.742,"Well, you see... can we go back for a second to Justice Ginsburg's question?"
2003.02-763,1,15435,abraham_s_alter,,1168.651,1169.31,I know.
2003.02-763,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1169.31,1171.251,--to show they exist in the national economy.
2003.02-763,1,15435,abraham_s_alter,,1192.056,1194.907,"Oh, it doesn't make sense at all Your Honor, to me, obviously."
2003.02-763,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1195.328,1195.771,"No, no."
2003.02-763,1,15435,abraham_s_alter,,1196.143,1210.593,"Your Honor's question seems to make step four, previous work, a gauge as to how severe the severe impairment is."
2003.02-763,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1210.593,1212.08,"Exactly, and I think they suggest that might be so."
2003.02-763,1,15435,abraham_s_alter,,1212.08,1222.232,"And... but step four, previous work, is a remedy that the commissioner can use for their convenience."
2003.02-763,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1236.971,1245.887,So you're not saying it is to that end because it's the unemployment office that's concerned about people who are out of work because you don't have elevator operators in the economy anymore.
2003.02-763,1,15435,abraham_s_alter,,1253.855,1264.091,"--Number one, Your Honor, Pauline Thomas could never collect unemployment insurance because the first thing they would ask her, are you ready, willing, and able to work?"
2003.02-763,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1337.902,1351.648,"Mr. Alter, if... if we think the statute may have certain ambiguities in it, why don't we owe deference to the Secretary's regulations and interpretation, which has been pretty consistent through the years?"
2003.02-763,1,15435,abraham_s_alter,,1351.648,1355.94,"There are three answers to that question, Your Honor."
2003.02-763,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1361.884,1374.683,If we think there is.
2003.02-763,1,15435,abraham_s_alter,,1375.63,1385.29,"--If the statute is ambiguous, the commissioner's construction must still be reasonable."
2003.02-763,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1400.233,1433.754,"Mr. Alter, how do you deal with the fact that a number of circuits and, indeed, three judges on this en banc court thought exactly that, that this was an ambiguous regulation, that it had been applied consistently by the Secretary, and that it was entirely reasonable, the... the notion that your current work is a proxy for can you do light work, that that's a... not a necessary or inevitable one, but a reasonable one?"
2003.02-763,1,15435,abraham_s_alter,,1433.754,1438.295,"Justice Ginsburg, first, let me take the... the last part of your sentence."
2003.02-763,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1444.694,1445.033,No.
2003.02-763,1,15435,abraham_s_alter,,1459.183,1463.02,"But it's the reason why, Your Honor, because she can't make an adjustment to any jobs."
2003.02-763,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1525.973,1530.448,"No, you haven't because there's another piece of it."
2003.02-763,1,15435,abraham_s_alter,,1560.896,1562.299,"That is exactly correct, Your Honor."
2003.02-763,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1579.638,1580.01,What?
2003.02-763,1,15435,abraham_s_alter,,1580.01,1582.322,"Skidmore deference, Skidmore v. Swift."
2003.02-763,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1582.322,1583.891,"Oh, I thought you said Skinmore."
2003.02-763,1,15435,abraham_s_alter,,1585.09,1598.669,"Chevron, the... the great case, the elephant in this room... Chevron has a two-step policy."
2003.02-763,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1618.731,1620.589,"Now, what does Chevron amount to?"
2003.02-763,1,15435,abraham_s_alter,,1637.761,1650.476,"Yes, Your Honor, but I believe under U.S. v. Mead the Court did make a distinction between a... an administrative policy--"
2003.02-763,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1650.476,1652.993,But Mead was... but Mead was not a Chevron case.
2003.02-763,1,15435,abraham_s_alter,,1652.993,1669.152,"--Mead was a construction by an agency case, and Mead says, I think... my... my reading is that if a... an administrative policy is at issue, great deference has to be given."
2003.02-763,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1678.135,1682.055,I... I rather thought that's what Chevron was all about.
2003.02-763,1,15435,abraham_s_alter,,1684.838,1696.999,"--Well, my reading, Your Honor, is that Chevron deference will only apply to an agency's statutory interpretation if it emerged from a formal adjudication."
2003.02-763,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1696.999,1698.402,I certainly don't see that in Mead.
2003.02-763,1,15435,abraham_s_alter,,1726.637,1727.463,I understand.
2003.02-763,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1748.724,1749.671,If it's reasonable.
2003.02-763,1,15435,abraham_s_alter,,1770.355,1792.851,"--I would argue, Your Honor, that it is not reasonable in any... by any stretch of the word because may I remind, Your Honor, that we're talking about a job which may not exist at all, and a finding that a person is not disabled because they're capable of doing a job that doesn't exist can't be reasonable."
2003.02-763,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1794.875,1795.535,Why is that?
2003.02-763,1,15435,abraham_s_alter,,1804.013,1805.028,--Your Honor--
2003.02-763,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1805.028,1806.968,"The word is disabled, not unemployed."
2003.02-763,1,15435,abraham_s_alter,,1816.256,1817.205,--But what I meant--
2003.02-763,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1817.205,1821.17,"And all the... all the Secretary is saying is if you can do your prior job, you're not disabled."
2003.02-763,1,15435,abraham_s_alter,,1824.514,1829.093,"--Let me try to highlight the illogical parts of that then, Your Honor."
2003.02-763,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1871.037,1875.345,"--Then she should... we should have ended it at step three, but the commissioner makes a distinction."
2003.02-763,1,15435,abraham_s_alter,,1904.966,1912.48,"--Justice Ginsburg, your question and Justice Scalia's question seem to me to define disability in a vacuum."
2003.02-763,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1924.945,1940.715,"You're the one that... that is tying disability to employment, not... not Justice Ginsburg and I. And... and yet, you keep saying that... that unemployment insurance is a red herring."
2003.02-763,1,15435,abraham_s_alter,,1952.521,1956.896,"--Your Honor, I am not saying that a person is disabled unless they can go get a job."
2003.02-763,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1967.67,1976.587,"And they are saying, to take your example, if you're a former iceman and you're still strong enough to deliver ice, you're probably able to do other jobs."
2003.02-763,1,15435,abraham_s_alter,,1980.552,1987.815,"Because at step five, when the commissioner says that you cannot adjust to other jobs, I take them at their word."
2003.02-763,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2002.593,2010.849,"And... and at the point at which you get to step five, you've already found that the person can't deliver ice anymore."
2003.02-763,1,15435,abraham_s_alter,,2028.971,2030.085,"That is correct, Your Honor."
2003.02-763,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2030.085,2031.078,That's what step four is there for.
2003.02-763,1,15435,abraham_s_alter,,2031.078,2035.453,"That... that is correct, Your Honor, but we keep getting back to that proxy, that word proxy."
2003.02-763,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2041.852,2045.112,"Well, if you're an... first of all, I don't know why it doesn't exist."
2003.02-763,1,15435,abraham_s_alter,,2046.97,2047.691,"Yes, Your Honor."
2003.02-763,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2048.456,2049.077,All right.
2003.02-763,1,15435,abraham_s_alter,,2103.457,2115.124,Your Honor's question about the elevator operator is a... a serious one because an elevator operator we have in this Court pushes buttons.
2003.02-763,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2257.332,2260.016,"Mr. Alter, can we go back to one thing that you said I don't think was quite right?"
2003.02-763,1,15435,abraham_s_alter,,2281.276,2286.356,"--In this particular case, if we get to step five, we will win."
2003.02-763,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2316.821,2320.658,"She did work at this job for... well, 7 years, did she not?"
2003.02-763,1,15435,abraham_s_alter,,2320.658,2321.195,--Correct.
2003.02-763,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2321.195,2326.685,"Because she... at one point in your brief, you said that she had been an elevator operator."
2003.02-763,1,15435,abraham_s_alter,,2332.235,2332.962,"A few years, Your Honor."
2003.02-763,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2467.368,2468.648,"Thank you, Mr. Alter."
2003.02-763,1,15435,abraham_s_alter,,2468.648,2469.597,Thank you.
2003.02-763,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2469.597,2471.537,"Mr. Lamken, you have 19 minutes remaining."
2003.02-763,2,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,2471.537,2477.936,Thank you.
2003.02-763,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2560.497,2564.667,Those regulations were subject to notice and comment rulemaking?
2003.02-763,2,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,2564.667,2565.093,Yes.
2003.02-763,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2603.222,2604.541,Mr. Lamken--
2003.02-763,2,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,2604.541,2604.996,Yes.
2003.02-763,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2604.996,2606.11,--could you clarify something?
2003.02-763,2,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,2634.43,2640.207,I... the respondent's position does have the effect of completing the two separate inquiries.
2003.02-763,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2640.207,2645.037,"Well, eliminating the first entirely, does it not eliminate the first entirely?"
2003.02-763,2,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,2645.037,2655.606,"The one thing that... that it wouldn't take into account is that in the first inquiry, the commissioner does not take into... in the previous work inquiry, the commissioner does not take into account age, education, and work experience."
2003.02-763,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2665.759,2674.758,"Well, but... but if he was doing his previous work, it is impossible to find that considering his age, education, and work experience, he couldn't do it."
2003.02-763,2,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,2675.397,2676.533,--I... I think that's precisely right.
2003.02-763,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2677.898,2678.724,--It's an impossibility anyway.
2003.02-763,2,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,2678.724,2679.179,--Right.
2003.02-763,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2724.975,2726.567,"Thank you, Mr. Lamken."
