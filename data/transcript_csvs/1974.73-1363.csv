1974.73-1363,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,29.949,"We'll hear arguments next in number 73-1363, National Labor Relations Board against Weingarten."
1974.73-1363,0,38000,patrick_hardin,,34.08,38.331,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1974.73-1363,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,114.296,123.629,"It has to be -- you have to say this, this involves engaging in concerted activities."
1974.73-1363,0,38000,patrick_hardin,,123.629,125.157,"Yes, that must be --"
1974.73-1363,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,125.157,127.508,"Not just act in concert, but --"
1974.73-1363,0,38000,patrick_hardin,,127.508,128.148,Concerted activities --
1974.73-1363,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,128.148,131.62,The statute says to engage in other concerted activities.
1974.73-1363,0,38000,patrick_hardin,,141.873,142.445,You're quite right.
1974.73-1363,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,405.111,409.929,"But what's this title, Loss Prevention Specialists, that's certainly a high sounding, (Inaudible)?"
1974.73-1363,0,38000,patrick_hardin,,409.929,413.009,"That's the company's terminology, Your Honor."
1974.73-1363,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,451.153,452.942,"At the previous store, there clearly had been --"
1974.73-1363,0,38000,patrick_hardin,,452.942,455.648,They clearly had been at the lunch counter at the previous store where she --
1974.73-1363,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,455.648,456.831,-- Store No. 2 or whatever.
1974.73-1363,0,38000,patrick_hardin,,456.831,458.548,"That's right, Store No. 2."
1974.73-1363,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,466.933,468.12,In the lobby type store.
1974.73-1363,0,38000,patrick_hardin,,468.12,468.702,That's right.
1974.73-1363,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,525.562,528.442,Nothing more ever happened to Mrs. Collins?
1974.73-1363,0,38000,patrick_hardin,,528.442,531.428,That is correct.
1974.73-1363,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,531.428,532.891,She came back to work?
1974.73-1363,0,38000,patrick_hardin,,532.891,542.096,"She returned to work. She was paid ultimately for the four hours she taken off the preceding afternoon, and so far as the record discloses, I think that she is still working."
1974.73-1363,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,542.096,545.366,"And so, what was the Board's order, there was no reinstatement, and that's the order necessarily."
1974.73-1363,0,38000,patrick_hardin,,545.366,548.913,"No, of course not, nor was there in the Mobil Oil case which had been discussed this morning."
1974.73-1363,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,556.878,568.626,"Is there any -- these, the facts because of what you just told us, well less little more mild in this case than in the previous one."
1974.73-1363,0,38000,patrick_hardin,,574.202,585.147,"It is identical in this case to the situation that the woman in Quality have been into was asking for the assistance of her union representatives, Quality --"
1974.73-1363,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,585.147,586.113,"So we have there, the representatives --"
1974.73-1363,0,38000,patrick_hardin,,586.113,589.37,-- representatives themselves being disciplined for their efforts to provide --
1974.73-1363,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,589.37,590.766,"But, it's basically the same issue."
1974.73-1363,0,38000,patrick_hardin,,590.766,592.805,It is basically the same issue.
1974.73-1363,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,593.813,598.097,"Yes, precisely the same, that is correct."
1974.73-1363,0,38000,patrick_hardin,,598.097,626.031,"The Board adopted the decision of its administrative law judge, which applied the then recent Quality Manufacturing decision and found that there had been concerted activity for the purpose of mutual aid and protection, and then addressed the question whether Mrs. Collins' fears that the interview might lead to discipline were reasonably based in all the circumstances."
1974.73-1363,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,834.522,858.213,"Do you think that that such an interview is this, the preliminary interview where you do not conceive the right have a friend there that the employee could make statements that would be incriminating, and now distinguishing, your case is not part of the state, it's not a governmental --"
1974.73-1363,0,38000,patrick_hardin,,858.213,860.267,"Incriminating literally, you mean?"
1974.73-1363,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,860.267,862.44,Yes.
1974.73-1363,0,38000,patrick_hardin,,862.44,864.539,It certainly is possible that an employ --
1974.73-1363,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,864.539,866.892,In the Fifth Amendment sense.
1974.73-1363,0,38000,patrick_hardin,,866.892,881.484,"Yes, it is not only possible, it is fairly common for an employee caught in the toils of the employer's security apparatus, not only to make incriminating statements, but to see them written out and then design them."
1974.73-1363,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,883.579,887.609,"There's nothing undesirable about that, though as if the statements are truthful?"
1974.73-1363,0,38000,patrick_hardin,,887.609,889.327,"Certainly not, certainly not."
1974.73-1363,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,917.878,929.249,"Now, I take it you distinguished the situation to which you just responded from the typical official incrimination."
1974.73-1363,0,38000,patrick_hardin,,945.548,970.636,"There's no contention whatever in this case that the employer's actions are colored by any state actions, notions, whatever, and the Board in its discussion of these issues has never casts its discussion in constitutional terms or analyzed the issues by reference to the decisions of this Court in the area of Fifth Amendment protections."
1974.73-1363,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,982.889,993.115,I gather as to concerted activities or what the Board appeals to is the very special deference to Board judgment as to what does constituted concerted activity.
1974.73-1363,0,38000,patrick_hardin,,994.182,995.395,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1974.73-1363,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,995.395,1010.112,"And that -- well, in terms of judicial review of Board determination of what constitute the concerted activity, what's the test?"
1974.73-1363,0,38000,patrick_hardin,,1010.112,1011.031,The --
1974.73-1363,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1011.031,1020.553,"Because I gather what the Fifth Circuit has done here say not too clearly, that doesn't accept."
1974.73-1363,0,38000,patrick_hardin,,1020.553,1020.748,Well --
1974.73-1363,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1020.748,1025.827,As within a Board competence -- this definition --
1974.73-1363,0,38000,patrick_hardin,,1025.827,1029.434,"I think, we have to separate two things in this discussion Your Honor.F"
1974.73-1363,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1109.005,1131.085,"Mr. Hardin, that Board isn't taking that position but if this all turns around the word “concerted”, and it's concerted because one employee is holding on his hand to the other, I don't know were your limits are when he doesn't fear discipline is pure investigation or is just a conversation."
1974.73-1363,0,38000,patrick_hardin,,1135.275,1141.546,"Well, that -- the accommodation of admittedly conflicting interests in that area is one --"
1974.73-1363,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1141.546,1142.153,Do you say that that --
1974.73-1363,0,38000,patrick_hardin,,1142.153,1142.697,-- committed to the Board --
1974.73-1363,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1142.697,1146.031,-- won't happen as long as the Board sets it.
1974.73-1363,0,38000,patrick_hardin,,1146.031,1147.893,[Laughter Attempt] I wasn't going to say that.
1974.73-1363,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1161.756,1172.326,And you say as to that in the real world which sets the Board's responsibility they have in mind would it makes this kind of determination.
1974.73-1363,0,38000,patrick_hardin,,1176.602,1178.819,-- and well within its province to decide.
1974.73-1363,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1178.819,1197.059,"Mr. Hardin, this morning, I think you were here when we had this case in the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit argued about Truck Drivers case, and there of course the Court of Appeals upset a determination by the Board and the Board is here, Mr. Kronenberg, you seen him have it reinstated."
1974.73-1363,0,38000,patrick_hardin,,1214.156,1216.524,In any difference in the standard of review?
1974.73-1363,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1216.524,1219.768,"Yes, that the Court should apply to a determination by the Board."
1974.73-1363,0,38000,patrick_hardin,,1219.768,1234.737,"I think the only useful distinction is that in this morning's case, the Board was writing against a background of considerable judicial ruling by this Court in the number of others."
1974.73-1363,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1250.594,1257.613,If you were these judicial decisions in this area than they were in the area this more in this Court.
1974.73-1363,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1257.613,1274.602,"Mr. Hardin, did you find anything in the legislative history of Section 7 that supports your view of it today as embracing within the prayer's concerted activities the type of meetings and conferences we're talking about?"
1974.73-1363,0,38000,patrick_hardin,,1274.602,1275.775,"No, Your Honor."
1974.73-1363,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1282.764,1284.542,Flat silence?
1974.73-1363,0,38000,patrick_hardin,,1284.542,1285.393,Virtually so.
1974.73-1363,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1297.561,1304.796,"The precise language having to do with representation appears in another part of the Act, didn't it?"
1974.73-1363,0,38000,patrick_hardin,,1304.796,1305.829,The precise language having to do --
1974.73-1363,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1305.829,1314.224,That is the right to have union representation or union representative at the time of a grievance.
1974.73-1363,0,38000,patrick_hardin,,1317.311,1319.454,It's in the proviso to 9 (a).
1974.73-1363,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1319.454,1320.571,Proviso to 9 (a)?
1974.73-1363,0,38000,patrick_hardin,,1320.571,1321.944,That's correct.
1974.73-1363,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1321.944,1338.864,"And in view of that very precise language at the time that the Congress was focusing on this problem, don't you suppose that that could be argued as the metes and bounds of what Congress intended to give by way of representation?"
1974.73-1363,0,38000,patrick_hardin,,1338.864,1339.669,Well --
1974.73-1363,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1339.669,1370.048,"The language of history certainly shows, I would -- either as I remember it and I don't remember it specifically with respect to this problem that 6 and 7 had to do is the right to get together in a group and to organize, first to collectively bargaining and secondly, for various other purposes, but not involving, not that all involving, and that suggesting that this involved individual representation at the time of an interview between an employee and his employer."
1974.73-1363,0,38000,patrick_hardin,,1377.135,1379.27,"Well, of course, the proviso to 9 (a) --"
1974.73-1363,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1379.27,1380.063,"9 (a), excuse me."
1974.73-1363,0,38000,patrick_hardin,,1380.063,1385.238,-- was substantially modified during the 1947 amendments.
1974.73-1363,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1524.734,1531.326,"Mr. Hardin, you're not contending or are you that this comes out of the collective bargaining part of Section 7?"
1974.73-1363,0,38000,patrick_hardin,,1531.326,1532.301,"No, we are not."
1974.73-1363,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1532.689,1537.379,"Because there was a goody of such talk in the briefs, I remember as I read on it."
1974.73-1363,0,38000,patrick_hardin,,1538.318,1539.244,Not in our brief.
1974.73-1363,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1539.244,1542.617,"Well, we could -- so this is not collective bargaining?"
1974.73-1363,0,38000,patrick_hardin,,1542.617,1543.811,"No, this is not collective bargaining."
1974.73-1363,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1558.66,1566.19,"Even a grievance – even a complain that that of kind of grievance is not generally known as collective bargaining isn't it, it's something else."
1974.73-1363,0,38000,patrick_hardin,,1566.19,1567.1,I --
1974.73-1363,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1567.1,1568.813,"In any event, we don't need to --"
1974.73-1363,0,38000,patrick_hardin,,1568.813,1579.76,"We don't have to reach that, but the statutory language requires bargaining about the meaning of an agreement during its term, as well as about the terms which are to be settled on the --"
1974.73-1363,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1579.76,1581.663,So-called minor dispute.
1974.73-1363,0,38000,patrick_hardin,,1583.881,1586.102,We are not contending that the rights here arise out of collective bargaining.
1974.73-1363,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1586.102,1590.952,"So, through representatives doesn't have any and that language is inapplicable here?"
1974.73-1363,0,38000,patrick_hardin,,1590.952,1591.633,That's correct.
1974.73-1363,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1591.633,1599.169,Could I ask you what the Board rule is under the proviso if there is a grievance in the employee who wants to adjust it by himself with the employer?
1974.73-1363,0,38000,patrick_hardin,,1607.931,1608.188,Yes.
1974.73-1363,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1639.431,1640.264,Mr. Martin.
1974.73-1363,1,37214,neil_martin,,1640.264,1643.405,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1974.73-1363,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2035.473,2057.096,"In the previous case, we had what seemed to be insubordination case, sassing Mrs. Gerlach or whatever the name was, and the Board came out the same way saying that that created a reasonable fear on behalf of the employee to extent that she was entitled to have a union representative present if she wanted to."
1974.73-1363,1,37214,neil_martin,,2057.096,2059.255,"Yes, but as we understand it --"
1974.73-1363,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2059.255,2063.192,o that Board as I understand in these two cases has made the distinction that you've just suggested.
1974.73-1363,1,37214,neil_martin,,2063.192,2080.106,"No, the cases appeared to exist coequally without the distinction being drawn between while one questioning concerning insubordination would not raised reasonable fear, and while other questioning concerning or insubordination would raise that fear."
1974.73-1363,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2095.614,2114.298,"Do you Mr. Martin accept the law of the National Labor Relations Board that at a concededly disciplinary interview, an employee has a right to a fellow employee or a labor representative?"
1974.73-1363,1,37214,neil_martin,,2114.298,2119.042,"No Your Honor, I do not because there is no statutory basis for it."
1974.73-1363,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2139.072,2139.695,Right.
1974.73-1363,1,37214,neil_martin,,2139.695,2151.871,"Upon appeal, the Fifth Circuit said that they found no basis upon which an employer is required to permit an employee represent to be present, and further that the investigation was not disciplinary, but it was an investigatory."
1974.73-1363,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2151.871,2152.076,Well then --
1974.73-1363,1,37214,neil_martin,,2152.076,2156.212,It is that dichotomy which has been created because of the decision of that court.
1974.73-1363,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2156.212,2166.102,"Yes, but you're complaining about the dichotomy that I had a -- which would suggest that you might be accepting the validity of it on the disciplinary."
1974.73-1363,1,37214,neil_martin,,2166.102,2184.767,"Well Your Honor, the only -- in the context of deciding upon which basis an employer will permit an employees' request and will not, it is far more comfortable for an employer to face the disciplinary interview dichotomy than it is the situation which is now pressed upon us by the Labor Board."
1974.73-1363,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2184.767,2189.451,Now we're dealing here where the question is what does the statute require?
1974.73-1363,1,37214,neil_martin,,2189.451,2197.53,"We're of the position that for the statute does not require union representation, an employee's request for union representation at either --"
1974.73-1363,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2197.53,2198.329,Either kind or area.
1974.73-1363,1,37214,neil_martin,,2198.329,2200.15,-- an investigatory or a disciplinary interview.
1974.73-1363,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2200.15,2203.189,Or if anything until and unless --
1974.73-1363,1,37214,neil_martin,,2203.189,2203.913,Until the man --
1974.73-1363,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2203.913,2205.876,-- the disciplinary action and there's a grievance.
1974.73-1363,1,37214,neil_martin,,2205.876,2206.936,Correct.
1974.73-1363,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2236.303,2239.252,"But again, you're confusing me."
1974.73-1363,1,37214,neil_martin,,2244.391,2245.225,We --
1974.73-1363,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2245.225,2249.164,-- no representation the statutory require it at all in any interview.
1974.73-1363,1,37214,neil_martin,,2249.164,2252.429,"That either, an investigatory or disciplinary interview."
1974.73-1363,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2253.365,2253.816,If this is --
1974.73-1363,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2253.816,2256.242,"And then, you don't have to worry about any dichotomy?"
1974.73-1363,1,37214,neil_martin,,2256.242,2256.962,That's correct.
1974.73-1363,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2256.962,2263.367,Don't you have to take that position in this case where they call the man who said I understand you steal it.
1974.73-1363,1,37214,neil_martin,,2263.367,2264.549,"I'm sorry, I did not catch all of your questions."
1974.73-1363,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2264.549,2272.179,Don't you have to take that position on the facts in your case where this lady was brought in and said we're investigating you for stealing?
1974.73-1363,1,37214,neil_martin,,2272.179,2272.594,The --
1974.73-1363,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2272.594,2274.62,"That's a little investigatory, isn't it?"
1974.73-1363,1,37214,neil_martin,,2274.62,2281.994,"Oh, yes and that's the position that both of the employer and the Labor Board have taken consistently that it was for purposes of investigation."
1974.73-1363,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2281.994,2284.786,"So, you have to take that position if you want to win."
1974.73-1363,1,37214,neil_martin,,2284.786,2292.586,"Well the case -- the question concerning disciplinary action, we do not feel is before us on our fact situation, Your Honor."
1974.73-1363,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2292.586,2293.088,Why?
1974.73-1363,1,37214,neil_martin,,2294.515,2305.526,"Because the purpose of the interview was not to determine the extent of discipline, nor was there a decision made that discipline would be taken before the interview began."
1974.73-1363,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2305.526,2307.549,But what was the purpose of the interview?
1974.73-1363,1,37214,neil_martin,,2307.549,2325.633,"The purpose of the interview was to determine if there was a basis for the suspicions which had been created in the mind of the employer by a fellow employee of Mrs. Collins, who was under the impression that she had taken more chicken than she had paid for."
1974.73-1363,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2335.148,2343.132,"Well, was this interview before the employer or before this man and was protecting, stealing, assemble as his time?"
1974.73-1363,1,37214,neil_martin,,2343.132,2349.092,The Loss Prevention Specialists is a broad title which compasses more than merely thefts.
1974.73-1363,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2356.149,2357.482,Including stealing?
1974.73-1363,1,37214,neil_martin,,2357.482,2358.84,Including stealing.
1974.73-1363,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2358.84,2360.27,Breakage would be --
1974.73-1363,1,37214,neil_martin,,2360.27,2363.903,Breakage or items not shipped in transit.
1974.73-1363,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2369.689,2376.36,"So, management had an expert there, but the lady couldn't have anybody to help her?"
1974.73-1363,1,37214,neil_martin,,2376.36,2383.052,"She could have terminated the interview so -- if she had desired and have -- could've refuse to answer any questions, Your Honor."
1974.73-1363,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2383.052,2385.37,Could she have been fired?
1974.73-1363,1,37214,neil_martin,,2385.37,2391.267,She can only been fired legitimately under the provisions of contract had there been just cause for the termination.
1974.73-1363,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2391.267,2394.072,-- you disagree with the cases before.
1974.73-1363,1,37214,neil_martin,,2394.072,2405.399,The case that was raised -- the fact situations in a Quality Manufacturing case are distinguished -- are distinguishable from our case.
1974.73-1363,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2405.399,2406.439,Mr. Martin as I --
1974.73-1363,1,37214,neil_martin,,2406.439,2406.718,"Yes, Your Honor."
1974.73-1363,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2406.718,2423.428,"-- understand you, you do take the same position as the employer in the previous case; namely, that the correct interpretation of the statute is that considered activities do not include the right of an employee to have representation as an employer will."
1974.73-1363,1,37214,neil_martin,,2423.428,2428.421,Correct Your Honor; that's correct.
1974.73-1363,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2495.182,2504.344,"Well, are you contending that the rule you subscribe to is not only as beneficial to the employer, but also to the employee?"
1974.73-1363,1,37214,neil_martin,,2520.859,2531.984,"Under the rule as you stated now Your Honor, the rule says where it may possibly result in the decision adversely affecting his employment status."
1974.73-1363,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2713.886,2719.755,"Mr. Hardin, you have about three minutes left Mr. Hardin."
1974.73-1363,2,38000,patrick_hardin,,2719.755,2722.314,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1974.73-1363,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2817.857,2832.687,Do you know of anything that could prevent every collective bargaining contract to contain a provision that representation would be allowed in all these circumstances -- all is formerly one to one?
1974.73-1363,2,38000,patrick_hardin,,2832.687,2844.761,"There is certainly no legal impediment, whether the parties would regard it as desirable in the context of their particular relationship, but only the parties to individual grievance can do --"
1974.73-1363,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2844.761,2848.489,Maybe some differences of view and the negotiations on that.
1974.73-1363,2,38000,patrick_hardin,,2848.489,2849.508,There might well be.
1974.73-1363,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2849.508,2853.97,But they could rate it into every contract if there was agreement.
1974.73-1363,2,38000,patrick_hardin,,2853.97,2865.671,"But that of course neglects the question whether Section 7 extends rights in this arena, not only to employees who are represented by union, but also to employees who are not."
1974.73-1363,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2888.362,2902.168,"Under your contention that the employer couldn't by agreement with the union cause the right to be waived on behalf of an employee, could he?"
1974.73-1363,2,38000,patrick_hardin,,2902.168,2902.831,The --
1974.73-1363,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2902.831,2904.031,If it's a statutory --
1974.73-1363,2,38000,patrick_hardin,,2904.031,2911.281,"I believe that follows from the Board's rational Your Honor, although the Board has not expressly spoken to that point."
1974.73-1363,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2931.805,2932.553,Thank you gentlemen.
