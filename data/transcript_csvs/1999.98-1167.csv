1999.98-1167,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.537,"We'll hear argument next in Number 98-1167, Edward Christensen v. Harris County."
1999.98-1167,0,36237,michael_t_leibig,,84.527,87.829,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1999.98-1167,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,143.756,145.435,"Agreement or understanding, is that it?"
1999.98-1167,0,36237,michael_t_leibig,,145.435,147.318,I'm sorry...  agree...  yes.
1999.98-1167,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,147.807,150.938,"Or understanding, in terms of our understanding come in there?"
1999.98-1167,0,36237,michael_t_leibig,,150.938,153.352,"It says agreement or understanding, and also..."
1999.98-1167,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,153.352,156.482,And do we know whether this is the case?
1999.98-1167,0,36237,michael_t_leibig,,162.646,168.192,"Well, there's...  in the record in this case it's not clear when the parties came in effect."
1999.98-1167,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,174.076,188.815,"But certainly, as to any plaintiffs who were hired after 1992 or '93, if the Department said this is going to be our program, and they took the job, would that qualify as an agreement or understanding?"
1999.98-1167,0,36237,michael_t_leibig,,188.815,199.212,"It might, and I'll explain how, but it depends on whether or not that was a...  clearly communicated to the employees and the employees accepted it when it was communicated."
1999.98-1167,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,199.212,200.043,"Well, if they..."
1999.98-1167,0,36237,michael_t_leibig,,200.043,202.113,In this case...
1999.98-1167,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,202.113,202.443,All it has to be is...
1999.98-1167,0,36237,michael_t_leibig,,202.443,203.575,In this case the facts are...
1999.98-1167,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,203.575,204.364,clearly communicated when they accepted the job.
1999.98-1167,0,36237,michael_t_leibig,,204.364,205.025,Excuse me.
1999.98-1167,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,217.324,234.554,"Well, so far as an employee accepting...  if you come to me looking for work and I say, you know, you work 40 hours a week, and you'll be paid at $10 an hour, and you go to work, you've accepted my deal, have you not?"
1999.98-1167,0,36237,michael_t_leibig,,234.554,234.895,Yes.
1999.98-1167,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,234.895,241.319,"I mean, you don't have to say...  it's not a question of voluntary confession or something like that."
1999.98-1167,0,36237,michael_t_leibig,,241.319,255.499,"Right, but under the regulations and the statute, and this is in section 207(o) itself, it says the...  and in the regulation, it says that compensatory time off in lieu of cash may be used, and may be a condition of employment."
1999.98-1167,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,310.026,314.06,You're not suggesting there has to be some sort of a written acceptance.
1999.98-1167,0,36237,michael_t_leibig,,314.06,325.667,"No, but at least there has to be...  which there's not in this case...  a clear enunciation first how the comp time will be preserved and used, and that the employer would have the authority to compel it, which didn't exist in this case."
1999.98-1167,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,339.595,349.452,"What are we supposed to do about that, because I thought that everybody agrees if the employee knowingly and voluntarily agreed to the understanding..."
1999.98-1167,0,36237,michael_t_leibig,,349.452,350.013,I think...
1999.98-1167,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,350.013,364.82,"at issue, then everybody agrees that then the county would win, and I think everybody...  then the issue is here, though, on the assumption that they didn't knowingly and voluntarily agree, and is there now a question in the case about that so that we should send it back, or..."
1999.98-1167,0,36237,michael_t_leibig,,364.82,368.513,"Well, the suggestion of Judge Dennis in the dissent..."
1999.98-1167,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,368.513,368.854,Yes.
1999.98-1167,0,36237,michael_t_leibig,,368.854,370.025,in the Fifth Circuit was exactly that.
1999.98-1167,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,370.025,372.807,"All right, so what are we supposed to do about that?"
1999.98-1167,0,36237,michael_t_leibig,,372.807,377.399,What we ask the Court to do is send the case back for reconsideration in...
1999.98-1167,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,377.399,378.02,Of that point.
1999.98-1167,0,36237,michael_t_leibig,,378.02,379.022,consistent with the Department of Labor rules.
1999.98-1167,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,402.507,411.393,Was there any allegation by the employer that there was anything other than an agreement that there would be comp time?
1999.98-1167,0,36237,michael_t_leibig,,415.324,415.634,No.
1999.98-1167,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,436.578,437.239,Then why would it...
1999.98-1167,0,36237,michael_t_leibig,,437.239,445.003,which is why Judge Dennis suggested that the trial court would have to make such a determination in order to allow any court to apply the applicable regulations.
1999.98-1167,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,445.003,467.089,"Well, why would a trial court have to make such a determination if the employer is not alleging anything more than we had an understanding, they knew when they took the job that it was going to be comp time instead of overtime pay, and we didn't...  we're not alleging that we spelled out the details of it."
1999.98-1167,0,36237,michael_t_leibig,,474.205,474.826,Compelled use.
1999.98-1167,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,474.826,475.978,Compelled use.
1999.98-1167,0,36237,michael_t_leibig,,475.978,490.53,"Well, I think the problem is in the record the way the district...  the trial court did that, they didn't get to the second point where they actually said we're not alleging, the county is not...  that's why I would..."
1999.98-1167,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,490.53,490.878,"In any event, you..."
1999.98-1167,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,490.878,507.64,"Even if they didn't, do you think it is a reasonable interpretation...  when the employer says, you're not going to get overtime, you're going to get comp time, do you think a reasonable interpretation of that is that I can sit on my comp time, refuse to use it until I finally retire, and then cash it in..."
1999.98-1167,0,36237,michael_t_leibig,,507.64,508.221,Yes.
1999.98-1167,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,508.221,509.032,at time and a half?
1999.98-1167,0,36237,michael_t_leibig,,511.454,511.714,Well...
1999.98-1167,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,511.714,519.33,"when the employer says, what you're going to get is comp time, and my follow-up question is, do you think it's a reasonable interpretation of a statute..."
1999.98-1167,0,36237,michael_t_leibig,,519.33,519.731,Yes.
1999.98-1167,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,519.731,530.657,"which says you can give an employee comp time instead of overtime, that it means the employee can sit on the comp time until he retires and then cash it in for overtime pay?"
1999.98-1167,0,36237,michael_t_leibig,,530.657,535.659,"Yes, I do, because the statue also says...  first of all, yes, I think it's reasonable."
1999.98-1167,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,558.635,568.973,"Well, as I understood the statute, it was enacted in response to the complaint of the States that now that you're applying the Fair Labor Standards Act to us we're going to go bankrupt."
1999.98-1167,0,36237,michael_t_leibig,,586.163,586.544,Right.
1999.98-1167,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,587.345,589.115,And then get it in cash.
1999.98-1167,0,36237,michael_t_leibig,,594.779,600.543,"Justice Scalia, I would argue that the Congress didn't quite make as broad a concession as you indicated, because..."
1999.98-1167,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,600.543,601.104,"No, I..."
1999.98-1167,0,36237,michael_t_leibig,,601.104,609.412,"first of all the statute itself says that an employer may use comp time only pursuant to an agreement with the employees, and only pursuant to a number of other conditions."
1999.98-1167,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,647.025,647.646,Mr. Leibig...
1999.98-1167,0,36237,michael_t_leibig,,671.522,684.67,"Our position, and what we asked for in both of our briefs, is that the case should be remanded for further hearing in terms of the Department of Labor regulations, which required the investigation of the extent and meaning of the agreement and how the agreement fit into the rules."
1999.98-1167,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,688.092,698.518,"Could I ask you what Department regulation covers this exactly, and where we might find it in the material with this case?"
1999.98-1167,0,36237,michael_t_leibig,,698.518,700.58,"Yes, Your Honor."
1999.98-1167,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,703.853,704.751,Yes.
1999.98-1167,0,36237,michael_t_leibig,,704.751,705.362,"Yes, Your Honor."
1999.98-1167,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,712.257,713.817,Where do I find that...
1999.98-1167,0,36237,michael_t_leibig,,713.817,714.138,Yes...
1999.98-1167,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,714.138,715.48,in these materials?
1999.98-1167,0,36237,michael_t_leibig,,715.48,720.805,"In the appendix, the original appendix to the petition, which contained most of the appendix, at page 46..."
1999.98-1167,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,720.805,721.874,Just a minute.
1999.98-1167,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,721.874,724.108,I would look at the petition for...
1999.98-1167,0,36237,michael_t_leibig,,724.108,725.297,It's the white...  the white large...
1999.98-1167,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,725.297,726.128,This?
1999.98-1167,0,36237,michael_t_leibig,,726.128,727.22,"Yes, Your Honor."
1999.98-1167,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,727.22,728.44,And where would I...
1999.98-1167,0,36237,michael_t_leibig,,728.44,730.052,It's 46a.
1999.98-1167,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,749.413,758.88,"Where does...  where do I find language here, on page 46a, that tells me the employee does not have to use it?"
1999.98-1167,0,36237,michael_t_leibig,,758.88,760.931,"No, you don't."
1999.98-1167,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,771.718,772.499,Yes.
1999.98-1167,0,36237,michael_t_leibig,,772.499,782.245,"And then in addition to that it says in...  back on page 45, it says agreements of understanding may provide comp time off."
1999.98-1167,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,789.05,793.475,"Well, I think everyone agrees that there can be an agreement covering it."
1999.98-1167,0,36237,michael_t_leibig,,800.718,809.834,"As the letter that I cited from the county, in the regulations themselves there's no express treatment of the compelled use question."
1999.98-1167,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,809.834,810.395,That's what I thought.
1999.98-1167,0,36237,michael_t_leibig,,810.395,810.985,Yes.
1999.98-1167,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,810.985,816.88,"So to what do we defer, then, in terms of the Labor Department?"
1999.98-1167,0,36237,michael_t_leibig,,816.88,822.764,"The Department of Labor's interpretation of their own regulations, which is expressed...  well, first of all, there's three of them."
1999.98-1167,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,836.762,838.412,Who is that letter from?
1999.98-1167,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,838.412,839.583,Who did that letter come from?
1999.98-1167,0,36237,michael_t_leibig,,839.583,843.497,It came from Harris County's...  specifically asking about the facts of this case.
1999.98-1167,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,843.497,845.056,To the Labor Department?
1999.98-1167,0,36237,michael_t_leibig,,845.056,846.328,Went to the Labor Department.
1999.98-1167,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,848.078,849.069,The administrator...
1999.98-1167,0,36237,michael_t_leibig,,849.069,852.662,"Right, and that was September, I think 14, 1992."
1999.98-1167,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,852.662,853.942,And where is that?
1999.98-1167,0,36237,michael_t_leibig,,853.942,861.629,"Of the letters...  the letter itself is not reprinted in the record, but it's cited in all the briefs in this..."
1999.98-1167,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,861.629,863.339,"So that's all we have, really."
1999.98-1167,0,36237,michael_t_leibig,,863.339,863.659,No.
1999.98-1167,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,891.218,894.659,"Well, these are all statutory provisions."
1999.98-1167,0,36237,michael_t_leibig,,899.596,899.803,No.
1999.98-1167,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,899.803,900.504,covering this...
1999.98-1167,0,36237,michael_t_leibig,,900.504,901.576,There's an earlier case before the State.
1999.98-1167,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,904.058,907.53,There is no collective bargaining agreement that we worry about here?
1999.98-1167,0,36237,michael_t_leibig,,907.53,908.56,"No, that's correct."
1999.98-1167,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,908.56,925.412,"Can the employer say, well, maybe it wasn't clear in the past, but I want to make it clear from this date forward, if you want to continue to work here, you're going to have to use your comp time, so if you want to stay a county employee, that's the rule?"
1999.98-1167,0,36237,michael_t_leibig,,926.942,933.356,"Under the statute and regulations they can do that, and then the employees have the option of then either accepting it and continuing to work..."
1999.98-1167,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,933.356,934.067,Or leaving.
1999.98-1167,0,36237,michael_t_leibig,,934.067,940.892,"Or...  and by the way, under the regulations they not only could...  the regulations both provide a condition of employment with those conditions."
1999.98-1167,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,968.26,969.161,"Well, has the county give notice here..."
1999.98-1167,0,36237,michael_t_leibig,,969.161,969.342,No.
1999.98-1167,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,969.342,969.882,do you think?
1999.98-1167,0,36237,michael_t_leibig,,969.882,972.043,"No, because it also says that if the employee..."
1999.98-1167,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,972.043,972.243,No.
1999.98-1167,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,972.243,975.286,These employees don't know that the county thinks they have to use...
1999.98-1167,0,36237,michael_t_leibig,,975.286,995.258,"Well, the regulation also says if the employees fail to express an unwillingness to accept it, it will be presumed, but in this case the employees did express an unwillingness to accept it, and therefore the opposite presumption I think would occur, and again you have to read the last two sentences of the section I cited, so that in this case, first of all..."
1999.98-1167,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,995.258,1002.584,"You mean, if the employee says nothing, then the county has to either fire them or assume that the deal's off?"
1999.98-1167,0,36237,michael_t_leibig,,1002.584,1002.804,No.
1999.98-1167,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1014.853,1015.664,But then...
1999.98-1167,0,36237,michael_t_leibig,,1015.664,1022.316,"Then if the employer lets him continue to work, he doesn't...  can't compel him to use comp time, but he would have the option to terminate."
1999.98-1167,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1030.323,1040.008,"I presume they would also have the option to say, we're not going to fire you, but if you won't use the comp time, we're simply going to reduce your weekly hours to 35 a week."
1999.98-1167,0,36237,michael_t_leibig,,1040.008,1044.853,"Well, I think they could, 1) say we're not going to let you work any more overtime."
1999.98-1167,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1049.467,1049.698,Why not?
1999.98-1167,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1049.698,1050.359,Why not?
1999.98-1167,0,36237,michael_t_leibig,,1050.359,1050.757,Well...
1999.98-1167,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1050.757,1058.905,"They're saying, look, we're doing it because we've got this great overhanging liability out there, and the only way we're going to be able to fund it is to save money in some other way."
1999.98-1167,0,36237,michael_t_leibig,,1058.905,1059.814,"Well, first of all..."
1999.98-1167,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1059.814,1063.587,And the wage and hour law doesn't tell us how many hours we have to let you work.
1999.98-1167,0,36237,michael_t_leibig,,1063.587,1073.573,"The regulations say that the employee's decision to accept comp time has to be made free of coercion or pressure, and that's clear in the regulations and the legislative history."
1999.98-1167,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1073.573,1075.093,But firing is not coercion?
1999.98-1167,0,36237,michael_t_leibig,,1075.093,1076.254,"No, because..."
1999.98-1167,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1076.254,1079.697,"You say you can fire him, but I can't reduce your hours to 35?"
1999.98-1167,0,36237,michael_t_leibig,,1079.697,1095.046,"Well, the regulations say you can make it a condition of employment, so if you make it a condition of employment, the person is free whether to accept the job or not, but if they do accept the job, then it is the system covered by the regulations, and part of this is to make sense out of all the regulations and the legislative history."
1999.98-1167,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1096.969,1097.529,If possible.
1999.98-1167,0,36237,michael_t_leibig,,1102.452,1103.033,"No, no."
1999.98-1167,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1110.406,1111.117,"No, I'm not..."
1999.98-1167,0,36237,michael_t_leibig,,1111.117,1111.708,But other than that...
1999.98-1167,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1111.708,1113.288,"No, I'm not pressuring him."
1999.98-1167,0,36237,michael_t_leibig,,1120.083,1120.393,"Yes, Your Honor."
1999.98-1167,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1120.393,1123.625,And he'll get...  if he keeps it till the end he'll get paid time and a half.
1999.98-1167,0,36237,michael_t_leibig,,1135.794,1136.746,"No, I don't think it is..."
1999.98-1167,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1136.746,1137.016,Okay.
1999.98-1167,0,36237,michael_t_leibig,,1137.016,1137.457,in that context.
1999.98-1167,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1142.267,1146.15,"But the example that I just gave you would not, as a matter of law, be coercion, you concede?"
1999.98-1167,0,36237,michael_t_leibig,,1146.15,1146.431,I don't think so.
1999.98-1167,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1146.431,1146.731,Yes.
1999.98-1167,0,36237,michael_t_leibig,,1146.731,1158.499,"Also I think that, along the same lines because I want to make it clear, the odd thing about this case is the burden between the employer imposing this without an agreement with the employees, and what he would have to do to get an agreement, is not a long road."
1999.98-1167,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1166.254,1168.867,"In fact, the road isn't any longer than my hypothetical, is it?"
1999.98-1167,0,36237,michael_t_leibig,,1168.867,1169.164,No.
1999.98-1167,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1169.164,1170.146,We know it's going to happen.
1999.98-1167,0,36237,michael_t_leibig,,1170.146,1170.416,Right.
1999.98-1167,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1183.734,1185.877,I was assuming some fat there.
1999.98-1167,0,36237,michael_t_leibig,,1185.877,1186.208,Yes.
1999.98-1167,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1186.208,1187.517,I must be...
1999.98-1167,0,36237,michael_t_leibig,,1187.517,1189.66,Comp time in fact would cost more than...
1999.98-1167,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1189.66,1190.509,You have to...  I may have to...
1999.98-1167,0,36237,michael_t_leibig,,1190.509,1192.812,"so they may want to avoid it by paying it out later, but they..."
1999.98-1167,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1192.812,1196.974,Enlighten me about what you mean by saying paying in comp time instead of cash.
1999.98-1167,0,36237,michael_t_leibig,,1200.497,1201.118,"Yes, Your Honor."
1999.98-1167,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1225.514,1226.405,"Yes, but that's..."
1999.98-1167,0,36237,michael_t_leibig,,1226.405,1241.724,"In fact, you have a defense against that, because the employer is free at any time to cash out the contract, so they could avoid that, not only by cashing out the comp time, but I suggested in my brief three or four other ways that an employer can protect themselves from that happening, but in theory that's the additional cost of comp time if it's stored, and so..."
1999.98-1167,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1241.724,1252.613,"But if he...  of course, as the employer used his comp time a year later and the wage rate's gone up, the time he uses the comp time he will stay home and get paid at the rate...  then current rate, will he not?"
1999.98-1167,0,36237,michael_t_leibig,,1252.613,1253.361,"Yes, Your Honor."
1999.98-1167,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1253.361,1253.692,Yes.
1999.98-1167,0,36237,michael_t_leibig,,1253.692,1255.915,"If he waits till he retires, there's another rule."
1999.98-1167,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1257.484,1260.627,"Of course, in the meantime the employer's had the use of the money, too."
1999.98-1167,0,36237,michael_t_leibig,,1260.627,1284.253,"Yes, and inflation's...  but I'm just saying, other than that, and Congress is clear about this both in the regulations and the legislative history, Congress' view was that you're not supposed to use comp time...  they meant comp time to be an equivalent of being paid in cash, because eventually you have to pay the money, and in fact in the real world it works out there would be areas I've described, and as we've described in our brief, there are methods by which the employer can save it."
1999.98-1167,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1284.253,1285.913,"Thank you, Mr. Leibig."
1999.98-1167,0,36237,michael_t_leibig,,1285.913,1286.304,Thank you.
1999.98-1167,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1286.304,1288.765,"Mr. Roberts, we'll hear from you."
1999.98-1167,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1288.765,1299.922,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1999.98-1167,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1352.797,1358.283,"Now, where do we find some departmental regulation that spells out what happens..."
1999.98-1167,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1358.283,1367.758,"Well, the Secretary has construed its...  her regulations to provide that in reliance on three provisions in the regulations."
1999.98-1167,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1390.243,1390.563,"Well, that doesn't get you there."
1999.98-1167,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1390.563,1393.796,That just says there has to be an agreement before you can use comp time.
1999.98-1167,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1402.071,1412.847,"Yes, Your Honor, and the Secretary is also relying on the provision in (a)(2) that says that the agreement may include provisions governing the use of comp time."
1999.98-1167,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1414.46,1415.167,Right.
1999.98-1167,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1415.167,1422.854,"the first sentence, and also relying on (c)(1), which is on page 47."
1999.98-1167,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1422.854,1424.825,"Well, let's do (a)(2) first."
1999.98-1167,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1431.911,1433.621,That's correct.
1999.98-1167,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1433.621,1434.742,"I mean, the regulation could have said that."
1999.98-1167,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1440.096,1454.285,"The regulation doesn't require that it address that, but the Secretary has construed the regulation as a whole to mean that if it doesn't address that, then the employee retains the right to use comp time..."
1999.98-1167,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1454.285,1460.017,"Well, why on earth doesn't the Secretary say that in a regulation, rather than having to construe something that's ambiguous."
1999.98-1167,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1460.017,1471.915,"Well, the Secretary didn't address it in the regulation, but did address it in the opinion letter, which provides clarification of the regulation..."
1999.98-1167,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1471.915,1472.206,"Well, it still..."
1999.98-1167,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1472.206,1473.417,and the Secretary's interpretations.
1999.98-1167,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1473.417,1490.689,"I just want to...  I may be misremembering this, but I can't...  let's just ask you that even if it's not a formal interpretation of the regulation, which I could see how it would be, what it means to say you can put extra conditions there, in terms of the...  a background rule where nobody says anything."
1999.98-1167,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1508.05,1509.72,"Yes, Your Honor."
1999.98-1167,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1517.577,1519.958,I never knew there was a difference of deference.
1999.98-1167,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1521.588,1544.655,"Well, the courts of appeals, and I think this Court as well, recognized a difference between Chevron-type deference or the kind of deference in our, and what might be called Skidmore-type deference, which is that the...  reasoned judgment is entitled to respect for its power to persuade and..."
1999.98-1167,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1544.655,1552.599,"I mean, all we're talking about is, what is the background rule if, in fact, nobody puts a condition in the agreement?"
1999.98-1167,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1560.795,1561.846,"Yes, Your Honor."
1999.98-1167,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1571.123,1573.052,"May I ask, Mr. Roberts, what's the opposite rule?"
1999.98-1167,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1580.187,1590.233,"The employee has the right to use comp time within a reasonable period when the employee requests it, unless it would unduly disrupt the employer's operation."
1999.98-1167,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1590.233,1590.794,"No, excuse me."
1999.98-1167,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1602.094,1610.479,"The employee can accrue the comp time so that the employee can use it on request, as provided by 207(o)(5)."
1999.98-1167,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1613.971,1618.793,"He has no obligation to be reasonable in his use of it at all, isn't that right?"
1999.98-1167,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1620.603,1628.119,"He has an obligation to not...  he's unable to use it on request if it would unduly disrupt the employer's operation, but..."
1999.98-1167,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1628.119,1630.19,Doesn't that cut against...  I'm just trying to think it through.
1999.98-1167,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1653.238,1662.702,Because Congress did not expressly address the situation when the...  if the employer could require the employee to use comp time.
1999.98-1167,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1684.327,1689.41,But the Congress did impose a ceiling on how much comp time that could be accumulated.
1999.98-1167,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1689.41,1700.747,"Yes, but once that ceiling is reached, Congress specified that the employee would have to be paid in cash, which returns the employee to getting his basic rate under the act."
1999.98-1167,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1700.747,1708.703,"But what I don't understand, Mr. Roberts, is what good it does for Congress to say, you don't have to pay these people cash."
1999.98-1167,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1726.355,1727.276,Congress doesn't say you can pay these employees comp time.
1999.98-1167,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1745.92,1753.305,"If they decide to bank it and never spend it, and the employer would like them to, and eventually get cash for it, when do they get the cash, when they retire?"
1999.98-1167,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1753.305,1763.962,"If they bank it, they get...  they can accumulate under the 240 or 480 hours, and on termination of employment they have to..."
1999.98-1167,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1763.962,1768.563,"On termination of employment, so it's quite possible that...  it would be an unusual case where they'd want to bank it."
1999.98-1167,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1780.491,1788.345,"You get paid...  you might get paid more, but I don't think it would be worth more 20 years down the road."
1999.98-1167,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1791.079,1793.63,"Well, at the rate for your rank then, to."
1999.98-1167,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1793.63,1795.21,"At the rate for your rank then, or the last 3 years."

1999.98-1167,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1809.43,1811.183,I don't know whether they do.
1999.98-1167,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1825.742,1838.541,"Mr. Roberts, does it come down to whether the default rule is, you get overtime, or the default is, as Judge Hickinbotham said, the employer sets the work rules?"
1999.98-1167,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1838.541,1840.682,Yes.
1999.98-1167,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1867.219,1869.9,"The question is, how detailed the consent must be."
1999.98-1167,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1869.9,1870.331,Right.
1999.98-1167,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1870.331,1874.562,"Just the comp time, or the working out of it."
1999.98-1167,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1874.562,1875.483,Yes.
1999.98-1167,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1897.189,1899.791,"Thank you, Mr. Roberts."

1999.98-1167,2,35827,michael_p_fleming,,1996.963,1998.694,"Yes, Justice Scalia, and in fact..."
1999.98-1167,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1998.694,1999.805,"So what's the big deal, then?"
1999.98-1167,2,35827,michael_p_fleming,,2003.839,2005.279,That's what we do.
1999.98-1167,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2047.366,2049.187,"Well, why don't you put it in an agreement?"
1999.98-1167,2,35827,michael_p_fleming,,2066.71,2067.061,I think...
1999.98-1167,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2067.061,2072.815,"And if there are good arguments on both sides, which there are, you could have a background rule either way."
1999.98-1167,2,35827,michael_p_fleming,,2075.387,2076.217,Sure.
1999.98-1167,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2076.217,2078.228,And so why not just go with the agency?
1999.98-1167,2,35827,michael_p_fleming,,2085.574,2086.453,Well...
1999.98-1167,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2086.453,2088.135,So that's sort of where I...  what I'm thinking about it.
1999.98-1167,2,35827,michael_p_fleming,,2088.135,2088.405,Well...
1999.98-1167,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2088.405,2089.297,What is your response?
1999.98-1167,2,35827,michael_p_fleming,,2089.297,2115.273,"That's a good question, and in addition to the default rule, which Judge Hickinbotham of the Fifth Circuit said, where he sort of filled in the gaps of what he perceived the agreement would be, in addition to the fact that under the statute we don't have to have an agreement, is our position, really how the case evolved, though, is up until we got to this Court the petitioner was saying that it's completely prohibited by the act, agreement or no agreement, and it was our position that it's...  we're allowed to do it by the act, and that's still our position."
1999.98-1167,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2115.273,2121.017,"Well, and now in this Court everybody agreed that there can be an understanding."

1999.98-1167,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2147.504,2148.974,"Well, what's the it?"
1999.98-1167,2,35827,michael_p_fleming,,2156.821,2157.51,Yes.
1999.98-1167,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2157.51,2157.91,Right?
1999.98-1167,2,35827,michael_p_fleming,,2157.91,2158.421,That's...
1999.98-1167,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2158.421,2160.624,So you must have an agreement to comp time.
1999.98-1167,2,35827,michael_p_fleming,,2160.624,2160.942,Which we have.
1999.98-1167,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2160.942,2166.368,"And the question is, what are the terms and conditions of that comp time?"
1999.98-1167,2,35827,michael_p_fleming,,2177.815,2178.724,Yes.
1999.98-1167,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2178.724,2179.596,operations.
1999.98-1167,2,35827,michael_p_fleming,,2179.596,2180.136,Yes.
1999.98-1167,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2180.136,2183.829,So we have that one condition on it directly out of the statute.
1999.98-1167,2,35827,michael_p_fleming,,2183.829,2184.26,"Yes, Your Honor."
1999.98-1167,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2184.26,2200.82,"But why, if Congress is trying to say, employees, it's your option, or at least you have to be given notice, why shouldn't that notice be, here it is, and at a certain point you're going to have to take it?"
1999.98-1167,2,35827,michael_p_fleming,,2214.72,2219.395,"Justice Ginsburg, I agree that it can be in an agreement, certainly."
1999.98-1167,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2238.815,2239.877,Is that what you did here?
1999.98-1167,2,35827,michael_p_fleming,,2271.739,2274.49,I don't know if...  I don't think that's what the petitioners are maintaining.
1999.98-1167,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2278.813,2280.443,"No, you're doing something a little different."
1999.98-1167,2,35827,michael_p_fleming,,2284.337,2286.317,Yes.
1999.98-1167,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2286.317,2286.958,Right?
1999.98-1167,2,35827,michael_p_fleming,,2286.958,2291.282,"That's what...  as we have maintained, we're doing two things, and they..."
1999.98-1167,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2291.282,2295.904,That's a little different from saying...  you're directing them to take their comp time.
1999.98-1167,2,35827,michael_p_fleming,,2295.904,2296.565,Yes.
1999.98-1167,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2296.565,2306.601,"Which means, you know, they won't get any...  well, they'll get their regular pay, and they'll have time and a half off, I guess, right?"
1999.98-1167,2,35827,michael_p_fleming,,2307.853,2308.213,Yes.
1999.98-1167,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2311.346,2316.218,"Well, that...  it seems to me that's a bit different from simply saying, look at...  God, you've got 240 hours here."
1999.98-1167,2,35827,michael_p_fleming,,2340.321,2342.733,"Yes, but by doing it, it's in two phases."
1999.98-1167,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2355.853,2358.484,"Why don't you do it the other way, and save us all this trouble?"
