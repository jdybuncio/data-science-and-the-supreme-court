1991.90-913,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,11.825,"We'll hear argument now in No. 90-913, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System of the United States v. MCorp Financial, Inc.--"
1991.90-913,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,69.862,74.47,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1991.90-913,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,161.576,182.709,Now Congress... suppose the district court hadn't done anything except to say... except to remind the Board that the statute says that there's an automatic stay of all proceedings.
1991.90-913,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,182.709,185.831,"Yes, Your Honor, the Bankruptcy Code does provide an automatic stay."
1991.90-913,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,205.044,207.605,Does that apply to everything that the Board was doing?
1991.90-913,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,207.605,213.852,"Well, it certainly applies to an action to cease and desist an unlawful practice, and that is what the Board has asserted here."
1991.90-913,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,213.852,219.257,The lower court's ruling was not based on the automatic stay provision.
1991.90-913,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,219.257,219.944,That is correct.
1991.90-913,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,332.133,352.28,"Mr. Minear, could I ask you whether under FISA the Board is ever able to compel the bank holding company to spend its assets to take care of the subsidiary banks before an Article III court has had a chance to review the Board's order?"
1991.90-913,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,352.28,355.28,Has it ever done so or can it do so?
1991.90-913,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,355.28,366.62,Is it possible under the law that the Board can compel that transfer of assets before a court has had a chance to review it?
1991.90-913,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,366.62,370.29,"It could issue an order, but that order would immediately be subject to judicial review."
1991.90-913,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,370.29,373.148,It's immediately subject to appeal and judicial review.
1991.90-913,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,373.148,373.914,"Yes, and the Board--"
1991.90-913,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,373.914,381.599,"And the minute that happens, is it also theoretically possible then, that a bankruptcy court could have jurisdiction?"
1991.90-913,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,381.599,384.145,--That point might be debatable.
1991.90-913,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,414.46,427.519,"Wouldn't you then get the priority section under the Bankruptcy Code if somebody went to the bankruptcy court and said, look, now we're here, and couldn't they apply their jurisdiction at that stage?"
1991.90-913,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,427.519,432.797,"Well, first of all, this is not a claim in bankruptcy as you might... arise from a debtor."
1991.90-913,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,438.639,441.872,"It could happen, presumably."
1991.90-913,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,441.872,446.042,--That MCorp could be required to pay money to the Fed?
1991.90-913,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,446.042,448.666,"No, no, no, no."
1991.90-913,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,456.569,462.301,"It could be that there would be overlapping jurisdiction at some point, but I think that question, of course, is premature here."
1991.90-913,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,482.87,491.835,Do you think there are any limits on the authority of the Board to determine what's an unsound banking practice and to the relief that it can order?
1991.90-913,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,491.835,497.349,"Oh, certainly there are limits, but nevertheless, Congress has not defined that term."
1991.90-913,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,503.94,507.689,And has the Board been consistent in its view of its power?
1991.90-913,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,507.689,509.938,"On this particular question, yes it has."
1991.90-913,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,520.105,536.271,"You want to get Leedom, but while we're on Justice O'Connor's question, assume that the Board conducts its proceedings, issues its orders, and there is then an appeal to the circuit court which ratifies the Board's order."
1991.90-913,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,556.044,561.058,"Well, 1334(d) gives the bankruptcy court exclusive jurisdiction over the property of the debtor."
1991.90-913,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,619.769,623.143,And I take it works that way under the National Labor Relations Act.
1991.90-913,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,639.604,640.776,I believe that is the case.
1991.90-913,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,875.949,878.776,Excuse me.
1991.90-913,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,884.835,885.491,That is correct.
1991.90-913,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,885.491,892.208,But the attempt to review the propriety of that administrative proceeding is a civil proceeding.
1991.90-913,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,892.208,894.613,That is correct as well.
1991.90-913,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,894.613,897.66,So you are within 1334(b).
1991.90-913,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,904.391,907.014,"But what is the civil proceeding, Justice Scalia?"
1991.90-913,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,933.238,941.953,"So your argument is not an argument of one statute's superseding the other, but just of no cause of action here, at this stage, essentially."
1991.90-913,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,941.953,942.172,That is correct.
1991.90-913,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1151.153,1160.211,"Mr. Minear, if we agree with you on the first point, the jurisdictional argument, is it necessary for us to go ahead and address this second question?"
1991.90-913,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1160.211,1160.648,Absolutely not.
1991.90-913,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1236.507,1238.881,"Thank you, Mr. Minear."
1991.90-913,1,16560,alan_b_miller,,1241.443,1253.408,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1991.90-913,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1303.558,1314.476,"Well, Mr. Miller, the completion of the administrative hearing here without any enforcement beyond that won't remove any property from the holding company, will it?"
1991.90-913,1,16560,alan_b_miller,,1314.476,1315.537,It will not.
1991.90-913,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1369.688,1373.827,Was that order enforceable against MCorp without any further proceedings?
1991.90-913,1,16560,alan_b_miller,,1373.827,1375.811,"It was, Chief Justice."
1991.90-913,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1451.076,1457.761,Now did the court of appeals view these orders that you've just quoted the same way you did or you do?
1991.90-913,1,16560,alan_b_miller,,1457.761,1460.51,I don't believe the court of appeals considered them.
1991.90-913,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1460.51,1476.628,"Well, you know, we grant certiorari on certain cases, and as Justice White says, we're not interested in having what we think is a case turn into a noncase, that just goes off on facts that either we weren't aware of or the court of appeals below didn't consider."
1991.90-913,1,16560,alan_b_miller,,1476.628,1481.017,But the court of appeals was considered below an important issue.
1991.90-913,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1495.668,1512.694,"Well, I had thought, please correct me if I'm wrong, that in any entity subject to one of these orders has the right to appeal to the circuit court and that only the circuit court's order makes it enforceable."
1991.90-913,1,16560,alan_b_miller,,1514.785,1517.096,"I believe it's almost right, Justice Kennedy."
1991.90-913,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1570.09,1582.883,But I still take it that the entity MCorp is under no obligation to make an actual transfer of proceeds until the circuit court affirms the order of the Federal Reserve Board.
1991.90-913,1,16560,alan_b_miller,,1582.883,1583.383,--Not at all.
1991.90-913,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1601.61,1611.122,"Well, I want to make it very clear, is MCorp entitled to have a stay of that order pending its consideration by the court of appeals?"
1991.90-913,1,16560,alan_b_miller,,1611.122,1612.418,--We believe it was.
1991.90-913,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1612.418,1619.525,"All right, then I don't see how you come and you say, oh, all these assets are being transferred out of MCorp."
1991.90-913,1,16560,alan_b_miller,,1623.696,1633.271,The Board... the Board took the position that the temporary order requiring the down-streaming of the assets was in full force and effect.
1991.90-913,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1678.235,1702.351,"Well, suppose we think that the bankruptcy law that speaks of what court shall have exclusive or concurrent jurisdiction doesn't apply to ongoing administrative proceedings in an agency such as this board, and so that we think that section simply is inapplicable."
1991.90-913,1,16560,alan_b_miller,,1714.925,1728.654,"Then, Justice, it seems to me that we must examine whether or not this order to put all the assets from the holding company into the banks has any... valid statutory source."
1991.90-913,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1845.183,1851.415,"Well, the automatic stay, though, I assume, presupposes that the bankruptcy court has some jurisdiction."
1991.90-913,1,16560,alan_b_miller,,1851.415,1852.837,"Yes, it does, Justice."
1991.90-913,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1852.837,1858.945,And maybe it doesn't here of a case where there's no final administrative order.
1991.90-913,1,16560,alan_b_miller,,1858.945,1862.271,But the automatic stay is a congressional edict.
1991.90-913,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1868.723,1874.001,"Yeah, but I think it presupposes a bankruptcy court with jurisdiction."
1991.90-913,1,16560,alan_b_miller,,1876.766,1889.323,"But Congress also gave, under 1334(d), exclusive jurisdiction of the assets of a debtor wherever located to the bankruptcy court."
1991.90-913,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1900.38,1909.893,"When you went into the bankruptcy court, Mr. Miller, when you sought a stay in the district court, did you rely on the automatic stay provisions?"
1991.90-913,1,16560,alan_b_miller,,1909.893,1910.548,"Yes, we did."
1991.90-913,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1979.911,1981.066,Now let me just understand.
1991.90-913,1,16560,alan_b_miller,,1996.279,1997.654,"No, I'm not saying that at all."
1991.90-913,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2044.524,2048.774,"I gather you're also telling us the Board hasn't tried to enforce that order, that letter."
1991.90-913,1,16560,alan_b_miller,,2048.774,2051.898,"It couldn't because, first--"
1991.90-913,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2051.898,2053.053,It never did try to.
1991.90-913,1,16560,alan_b_miller,,2055.176,2056.083,"--Oh, it is."
1991.90-913,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2071.562,2072.888,You also couldn't pay your lawyers.
1991.90-913,1,16560,alan_b_miller,,2072.888,2073.42,That's is correct.
1991.90-913,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2073.42,2074.92,But you are paying your lawyers.
1991.90-913,1,16560,alan_b_miller,,2074.92,2084.32,Because there is a stay outstanding from the court of appeals that permits us to carry on the business of these debtors.
1991.90-913,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2094.082,2097.863,And is the validity of that stay what we're reviewing now?
1991.90-913,1,16560,alan_b_miller,,2097.863,2099.502,Yes.
1991.90-913,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2110.857,2111.654,"Oh, okay."
1991.90-913,1,16560,alan_b_miller,,2111.654,2124.868,"Indeed, the temporary orders were first initiated as a procedure preliminary to the final findings on the source-of-strength doctrine initiated by the Board of Governors in the fall of 1988."
1991.90-913,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2242.867,2251.99,"Well, that would mean you would have some sort of a merits inquiry with respect to every regulatory investigation that was being undertaken by the Government."
1991.90-913,1,16560,alan_b_miller,,2259.5,2278.947,"We believe that in a bankruptcy, where the nature of the proceeding is one that is calculated to lead to the removal of the assets of a holding company, yes, that under those circumstances, the Court necessarily must examine whether there is a police or regulatory power, Chief Justice."
1991.90-913,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2278.947,2302.921,"You say calculated to lead, Mr. Miller, but reading the court of appeals opinion here, (2)(a) and <three a@l> [= (3)(a)] of the petition for certiorari, it seems to me the court of appeals did not feel it was presented with your temporary stays that might have had the effect of removing... it's talking about notice of charges and hearings that were to be conducted."
1991.90-913,1,16560,alan_b_miller,,2308.951,2309.95,Correct.
1991.90-913,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2309.95,2316.431,So what you're calling our attention to in these temporary orders was never called to the attention of the court of appeals.
1991.90-913,1,16560,alan_b_miller,,2317.072,2319.399,"No, it was called to the attention of the court of appeals."
1991.90-913,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2319.399,2322.523,"Well, they didn't consider them in their opinion."
1991.90-913,1,16560,alan_b_miller,,2322.523,2322.82,They didn't refer to it.
1991.90-913,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2328.63,2343.405,"And that's why you had calculated to because certainly unless... until the administrative proceeding becomes final and is subject to some sort of review, it isn't going to have the effect of removing any property."
1991.90-913,1,16560,alan_b_miller,,2343.405,2344.295,--That is correct.
1991.90-913,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2474.571,2478.256,Doesn't this get you back into a sort of Leedom kind of analysis?
1991.90-913,1,16560,alan_b_miller,,2479.928,2483.395,I'm reluctant to call it a Leedom kind of... it is a Leedom type of analysis.
1991.90-913,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2483.395,2484.02,--Type of analysis.
1991.90-913,1,16560,alan_b_miller,,2489.549,2490.237,Correct.
1991.90-913,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2490.237,2491.908,Do you think that's what the statute means?
1991.90-913,1,16560,alan_b_miller,,2491.908,2509.994,"Well, I think that 1818(i), which requires that you proceed either in the district court on temporary orders or in the court of appeals on final orders, is analogous to an exhaustion statute."
1991.90-913,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2679.363,2690.734,"Well, at the conclusion of these administrative proceedings to which you object, if there was a final cease-and-desist order, would that be subject to judicial review?"
1991.90-913,1,16560,alan_b_miller,,2690.734,2693.686,The final would be subject to review in the court of appeals.
1991.90-913,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2693.686,2697.091,And would the validity of the regulation be at issue?
1991.90-913,1,16560,alan_b_miller,,2698.746,2700.277,"Yes, it could be an issue, Justice White."
1991.90-913,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2700.277,2707.056,So it's just a question of when you get this adjudication.
1991.90-913,1,16560,alan_b_miller,,2707.056,2719.346,"Well, the difficulty with that is that the standard for review in the court of appeals, it would seem to me... as best I recollect it would be... whether or not the agency action is arbitrary and capricious."
1991.90-913,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2726.907,2731.905,I don't think that's a standard for deciding whether the regulation is consistent with the statute.
1991.90-913,1,16560,alan_b_miller,,2731.905,2734.513,"Well, it would be a question of deciding--"
1991.90-913,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2734.513,2736.98,A question of statutory construction or--
1991.90-913,1,16560,alan_b_miller,,2736.98,2744.775,"--whether the determination was appropriate, and I think under those circumstances, the Administrative Procedures Act requires a finding."
1991.90-913,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2744.775,2756.27,"--And why is it, in a word, your opportunity for judicial review at the end of this proceeding wouldn't be adequate for your purposes?"
1991.90-913,1,16560,alan_b_miller,,2756.27,2775.98,"If we're just referring to the notice of charges, it seems to me that what we've done then is hold hostage the Chapter 11 that Congress has authorized the bank holding company to take advantage of until the long road at the end of the administrative proceeding."
1991.90-913,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2787.178,2793.816,"Well, I suppose you make this argument whether any of the assets of the bank holding company are in danger now."
1991.90-913,1,16560,alan_b_miller,,2793.816,2794.785,--That is correct.
1991.90-913,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2794.785,2803.22,It's just the fact... just the fact that you... that the bankruptcy proceeding is being interfered with while the administrative proceeding going on?
1991.90-913,1,16560,alan_b_miller,,2803.22,2812.31,It's the determination of the extent to which the administrative proceeding is automatically stayed by the congressional act of Section 362(a).
1991.90-913,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2816.09,2819.572,"I think the delay is really the only problem, Mr. Miller, isn't it?"
1991.90-913,1,16560,alan_b_miller,,2832.051,2832.988,I think that's correct.
1991.90-913,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2922.468,2923.187,"Counsel, one question."
