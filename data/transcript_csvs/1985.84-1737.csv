1985.84-1737,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,65.723,"Mr. Lauber, I think you may proceed whenever you are ready."
1985.84-1737,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,65.723,77.5,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1985.84-1737,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,163.669,167.589,Which competitors are you... give me an example.
1985.84-1737,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,167.589,170.885,"Well, for Mueller, it was Ronzoni."
1985.84-1737,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,180.99,187.049,"But they are profit-making entities, are they not?"
1985.84-1737,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,187.049,190.001,"Well, they all make profits."
1985.84-1737,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,193.422,198.967,Is the American College of Physicans a non-profit-making institution?
1985.84-1737,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,198.967,200.793,--It is a non-profit making organization.
1985.84-1737,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,203.855,209.743,Does that distinguish them from Harpers Magazine and a lot of others?
1985.84-1737,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,209.743,227.486,"Well, it does, but not for purposes of this particular tax because an otherwise tax-exempt charity, if it runs a business that's unrelated to its charitable purposes, has to pay tax on the profits only from that business, not from the dues and so forth, but the profits from that advertising business."
1985.84-1737,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,227.486,237.81,I take it your earlier point was that Congress did not want to subsidize nonprofit organizations in competing against for-profit organizations in a business?
1985.84-1737,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,237.81,238.513,Exactly right.
1985.84-1737,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,238.513,245.479,"Now, however, the American College of Physicians has been around a long time, hasn't it?"
1985.84-1737,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,245.479,247.635,A lot of them have.
1985.84-1737,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,250.181,254.023,"Well, I'm not sure, but I think this one might even precede that."
1985.84-1737,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,258.178,261.802,"It's a new tax on an old organization, put it that way."
1985.84-1737,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,430.045,447.537,"Mr. Lauber, do you take the position that commercial advertising can never under any circumstance whatever be substantially related to or contribute importantly to a tax exempt organization within the meaning of the statute?"
1985.84-1737,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,447.537,454.942,"Our position is that the test is that in the regulation, advertising designed and selected in the manner--"
1985.84-1737,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,454.942,457.566,"So, do you think the regulations can amend the statute?"
1985.84-1737,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,457.566,459.268,"--Well, the regulations--"
1985.84-1737,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,459.268,472.701,"Because what I think you are arguing for is an absolutely per se rule which could never be varied, notwithstanding the fact that the statute as far as language is not so phrased?"
1985.84-1737,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,472.701,478.949,"--Well, the regulation was explicitly approved by Congress in 1969."
1985.84-1737,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,478.949,480.775,"Well, but Congress didn't change the statute."
1985.84-1737,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,502.767,512.466,"Well, as mentioned in our brief, Jutice O'Connor, there are, one can imagine, examples of what might be called advertisement being deemed related."
1985.84-1737,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,577.362,591.136,"Well, is the critical factor in your view that if the advertising message is simply an accident of the marketplace, that under these regulations it's taxable?"
1985.84-1737,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,591.136,592.651,--That's a very good point.
1985.84-1737,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,619.158,622.047,"While I have you interrupted, let me ask you one more question."
1985.84-1737,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,630.98,643.021,"Well, normally it is a question of fact, and for the vast universe of tax-exempt groups that run... arguably run businesses like museums, shops and so forth, it is a factual increase."
1985.84-1737,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,675.821,679.913,"Mr. Lauber, let me follow through on Justice O'Connor's first question."
1985.84-1737,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,709.573,727.441,"Well, I think, Justice Blackmun, in the case of the ABA Journal, I think... well, the bar journals, the allocation is based on divvying up the income between the editorial content which is furnished through subscriptions and dues, and the advertising."
1985.84-1737,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,755.944,764.457,"Well, at issue there, in part anyway, were legal notices in the revenue ruling I'm speaking of."
1985.84-1737,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,764.457,776.436,"I think those would be classified just like the ones in the annals, where doctors seeking employment or people seeking to employ doctors, and we contend that those also are not related to the educational purposes."
1985.84-1737,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,776.436,796.615,"That's against the Revenue ruling, and what I m leading up to is that if you should prevail here on your general thesis, shouldn't we just remand for determination of which is properly allocable to, as substantially related income and that which is not?"
1985.84-1737,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,796.615,806.487,"Justice Blackmun, I'm not sure of the kind of legal notices that are referred to in that '82 Revenue ruling."
1985.84-1737,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,816.218,822.466,"Well, the Revenue ruling held flatly, ruled flatly that they were exempt from tax."
1985.84-1737,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,822.466,830.024,"Well, I think in any event, the legal notices are distinguishable from commercial advertising."
1985.84-1737,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,889.61,894.202,"Well, now is this the House report that a company... some substitute of legislation?"
1985.84-1737,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,894.202,918.676,"What happened, Justice Rehnquist, is the regulations came out in '67, and there were moves made on the floor to either stop them or to defer their effective date in 1968, and those moves were unsuccessful on the promise that hearings would be held the following year to address this issue in full."
1985.84-1737,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,947.025,959.879,"Well, how much stronger do you think the Government's position is in view of these hearings and reports than it would be if you simply had to justify the '67 regs on the basis of the statutes as they then stood?"
1985.84-1737,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,959.879,961.768,"Well, I think we're a little bit stronger."
1985.84-1737,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1233.519,1248.933,"Mr. Lauber, I suppose there are instances where the same ad is published in the Annals and in the New England Journal of Medicine, which is a 501-C-6 organization, is that--"
1985.84-1737,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,1248.933,1249.793,"Exactly right, Justice Blackmun."
1985.84-1737,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1253.728,1259.211,"--In which case, I suppose you're suggesting that there is a slight element of inconsistency in the result?"
1985.84-1737,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,1259.211,1279.624,"I think that's exactly right, because respondent's argument would mean that the same ad run in the AMA Journal on the same day would be subject to tax because AMA is exempt under 501-C-6, but the ad in respondent's Journal appearing the same day would be tax exempt because it's under 501-C-3."
1985.84-1737,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1373.43,1374.446,I'm not sure I got all through.
1985.84-1737,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,1382.442,1388.549,"Well, the first one was that the Commissioner has always interpreted Example 7 to apply to all tax-exempt groups."
1985.84-1737,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1388.549,1392.766,"With respect to that, had he done any of that before Congress reviewed Example 7?"
1985.84-1737,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,1392.766,1410.149,"Indeed he had, at the Treasury, took the position on the bill that it would apply to tax-exempt groups across the board, although witnesses who testified before Congress, which included respondent, respondent said in hearings that this regulation would apply to it."
1985.84-1737,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1422.754,1424.27,And what are your other two--
1985.84-1737,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,1424.27,1430.892,"The other two, the second one is that the... the third I made, in response to Justice Blackmun's question, that it would produce an absurd result."
1985.84-1737,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1430.892,1431.437,--Not only with the AMA but--
1985.84-1737,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,1431.437,1446.682,"The second one is that the reasoning of the example is what we're relying upon, and the reasoning of the example is that the publication of commercial advertising, advertising designed and selected in the manner of ordinary commercial advertising, is not educational."
1985.84-1737,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1470.094,1481.51,Mr. Huffaker.
1985.84-1737,1,30713,john_b_huffaker,,1481.51,1488.665,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1985.84-1737,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1614.535,1623.235,"You take the position, Mr. Huffaker, if I may inquire, that that is purely a factual question?"
1985.84-1737,1,30713,john_b_huffaker,,1623.235,1624.907,"Yes, Justice."
1985.84-1737,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1624.907,1634.638,And in the Court of Claims it was determined as a matter of fact that it does not contribute importantly?
1985.84-1737,1,30713,john_b_huffaker,,1634.638,1657.722,"We find... we argued that Judge Kozinsky made a very fundamental error of fact and he was overruled by the Court of Claims as clearly erroneous on that ground, but Judge Kozinsky decided a fact question and he was reversed on a fact question."
1985.84-1737,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1657.722,1669.28,"Well, the Court of Claims decided the case contrary to your position today, and the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit reversed, did it not?"
1985.84-1737,1,30713,john_b_huffaker,,1669.28,1670.294,That's correct.
1985.84-1737,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1670.294,1674.73,And did they find the findings were clearly erroneous?
1985.84-1737,1,30713,john_b_huffaker,,1674.73,1675.463,That's correct.
1985.84-1737,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1820.623,1829.98,"Well, I suppose if the only ads run are those of medical economics, you're in a position to be a little more--"
1985.84-1737,1,30713,john_b_huffaker,,1829.98,1833.478,"My position would be, impossible, Your Honor."
1985.84-1737,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1894.641,1898.077,--One is tempted to ask why you charge for the ads.
1985.84-1737,1,30713,john_b_huffaker,,1898.077,1920.366,"If no charge was made for the ads, or put it more realistically, if the ads were merely self-supporting or no charge was made, I think... the College has limited resources."
1985.84-1737,2,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,3212.078,3214.624,"A few brief points, Mr. Chief Justice."
