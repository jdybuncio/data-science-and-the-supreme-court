1988.87-1485,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.176,"We'll hear argument next in No. 87-1485, Arthur Blanchard v. James Bergeron."
1988.87-1485,0,46021,william_w_rosen,,20.066,23.645,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1988.87-1485,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,79.722,83.966,"Mr. Rosen, tell me how those two work together."
1988.87-1485,0,46021,william_w_rosen,,87.038,88.809,"No, sir."
1988.87-1485,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,128.025,129.067,"Well, I understand all that."
1988.87-1485,0,46021,william_w_rosen,,133.939,134.94,I don't think so.
1988.87-1485,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,144.994,148.558,"So that the contingent fee then, arrangement, really means nothing?"
1988.87-1485,0,46021,william_w_rosen,,148.558,156.602,"--It is in, for general purposes, I think, irrelevant as to the implementation of 1988 fees."
1988.87-1485,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,182.251,187.594,"Well, then you think the court would fix the reasonable fee loss the contingent fee?"
1988.87-1485,0,46021,william_w_rosen,,187.594,197.361,"Justice Blackmun, I don't think that the contingent fee per se is a consideration."
1988.87-1485,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,230.851,232.704,I understand all that.
1988.87-1485,0,46021,william_w_rosen,,236.635,247.233,"If 1988 is implemented correctly, I do not think that both fees probably are necessary or probably should be taken."
1988.87-1485,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,266.494,277.453,"Well, I'm wondering really why, in a case that is subject to 1988, a contingent fee arrangement is at all necessary or indeed indicated."
1988.87-1485,0,46021,william_w_rosen,,277.453,280.125,"I think the reason for that, Justice Blackmun, is this."
1988.87-1485,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,285.088,287.208,I know exactly how it happens.
1988.87-1485,0,46021,william_w_rosen,,293.243,296.736,--He may not know... the attorney may not know what he has.
1988.87-1485,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,312.924,315.508,"--Well, that's a little high, after my old practice days anyway."
1988.87-1485,0,46021,william_w_rosen,,315.508,327.536,"--And I think, sir, that the, that the standard before you even know what the investigation will show as to what kind of case you have, is a contingent fee contract."
1988.87-1485,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,357.146,371.284,"Mr. Rosen, do you read the Fifth Circuit opinion as saying that the $4,000 attorney's fee is payable by the defendant over and above the $5,000 actual damages and the $5,000 punitive damages?"
1988.87-1485,0,46021,william_w_rosen,,371.284,377.028,"Yes sir, Over, over and... yes."
1988.87-1485,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,380.089,380.87,So--
1988.87-1485,0,46021,william_w_rosen,,380.87,383.612,"Otherwise it would be, it would certainly be a windfall to the defendant."
1988.87-1485,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,383.612,384.341,--Yes.
1988.87-1485,0,46021,william_w_rosen,,388.334,393.768,"The defendant would have to pay $14,000... well, I hope that is what the Fifth Circuit said."
1988.87-1485,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,424.158,428.392,"The District Court awarded you $7,500 in attorney's fees."
1988.87-1485,0,46021,william_w_rosen,,428.392,429.051,"Yes, sir."
1988.87-1485,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,429.051,431.843,And did you appeal from that?
1988.87-1485,0,46021,william_w_rosen,,431.843,434.386,I appealed from that on two bases--
1988.87-1485,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,434.386,436.958,And those are the two that you raise here?
1988.87-1485,0,46021,william_w_rosen,,436.958,448.234,"--Well, the first in the appeal to the Fifth Circuit, the paraprofessional issue, was included within the whole attorney fee issue."
1988.87-1485,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,478.894,492.173,"May I ask you a question about... just following up really on Justice Blackmun's question... supposing you had not appealed, just received the $7,500 fee, and putting the costs to one side for a moment."
1988.87-1485,0,46021,william_w_rosen,,501.309,507.362,"Justice Stevens, as a practical matter, I have received no fee at the present time."
1988.87-1485,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,523.172,523.613,Right.
1988.87-1485,0,46021,william_w_rosen,,523.613,526.996,"--Which had been awarded, and I hope and I think that's the way the process should work."
1988.87-1485,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,526.996,545.777,"Or if the client had paid you the... say they had paid the principal judgment right away while the fees were being debated, $10,000 would have been paid to the client, the client would have paid you $4,000 as the 40 percent contingent fees then if thereafter $7,500 was recovered $4,000 would go to the client and $3,500 would go to you."
1988.87-1485,0,46021,william_w_rosen,,545.777,547.739,I think that's the way the system should work.
1988.87-1485,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,585.005,597.481,"Well, what would happen if an attorney spent just a small number of hours on a case and received a huge award, and he had a contingent fee contract?"
1988.87-1485,0,46021,william_w_rosen,,597.481,602.884,"Justice Kennedy, you mean a huge award under the contingent fee?"
1988.87-1485,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,602.884,603.776,Yes.
1988.87-1485,0,46021,william_w_rosen,,603.776,605.678,Under the contingent fee--
1988.87-1485,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,605.678,613.473,"And, and suppose that we'd all stipulate that a reasonable fee would be $20,000 but his contingent fee was $100,000, what happens then?"
1988.87-1485,0,46021,william_w_rosen,,613.473,633.465,"--I think then you get into the area of whether or not the vindication of the particular right was worthy of an enhancement and at that period of time, at that time, then it is a question of looking at what is the relationship and what does the contract call for."
1988.87-1485,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,634.446,646.394,"Well suppose the, suppose the trial court said a reasonable fee here is $20,000, but the judgment was huge, and under the contingent fee contract the fee award under the contingent contract was $100,000?"
1988.87-1485,0,46021,william_w_rosen,,646.394,654.749,"--It may well be that a reasonable fee then would be $20,000, in your example, $20,000."
1988.87-1485,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,654.749,655.899,It is.
1988.87-1485,0,46021,william_w_rosen,,660.993,665.304,"I don't think that the attorney keeps the $100,000, except--"
1988.87-1485,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,665.304,669.699,"You mean the contingency fee contract is just, is just invalidated?"
1988.87-1485,0,46021,william_w_rosen,,669.699,683.447,"--Except to the degree for 1988 purposes, except to the degree of the value of the enhancement of the right, of the enforcement of the right--"
1988.87-1485,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,683.447,689.742,You think 1988 was intended to reduce the contractual entitlement of the lawyer?
1988.87-1485,0,46021,william_w_rosen,,689.742,691.762,--I think--
1988.87-1485,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,691.762,701.559,"I mean, here you have a lawyer who struck a deal for, you know, to get $100,000, and you're telling me 1988 was meant to somehow interfere with that contractual agreement?"
1988.87-1485,0,46021,william_w_rosen,,701.559,703.329,--I think there are two different issues.
1988.87-1485,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,726.828,727.195,That's fine.
1988.87-1485,0,46021,william_w_rosen,,731.79,740.585,"Clearly, from the basis of a civil right litigation, 1988 does, under the supremacy clause of the Constitution."
1988.87-1485,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,744.686,747.618,"--Well, the supremacy clause doesn't have anything to do with a private contract."
1988.87-1485,0,46021,william_w_rosen,,747.618,748.469,"--No, sir."
1988.87-1485,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,773.558,797.092,"Supposing that a client walk into your office with something that you, being a knowledgable lawyer, know is a civil rights case, and that there will therefore be an award of attorney's fees if you win, and you tell the client, I think we can get a judgment for $100,000 here and if we do I think the court probably is going to award another $50,000 as attorney's fees."
1988.87-1485,0,46021,william_w_rosen,,818.625,821.16,--I think it is permissible.
1988.87-1485,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,829.434,830.703,"Well, do you--"
1988.87-1485,0,46021,william_w_rosen,,830.703,831.204,Then the question--
1988.87-1485,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,831.204,838.85,"--Supposing that you're an attorney, you've negotiated that sort of an arrangement, you come to the court and you say, this is what I want the judgment entered for."
1988.87-1485,0,46021,william_w_rosen,,842.192,848.485,"--Mr. Chief Justice, there are various fee arrangements--"
1988.87-1485,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,848.485,850.388,"Well, I've given you one fee arrangement."
1988.87-1485,0,46021,william_w_rosen,,851.898,857.562,--The court may uphold that fee arrangement if they find it reasonable.
1988.87-1485,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,858.323,863.534,"Well, what factors would they take into consideration in deciding whether it was reasonable or not?"
1988.87-1485,0,46021,william_w_rosen,,863.534,877.934,"I think the fact of time spent on the case, of market rate of billing hours, I think the degree of success in the vindication of the civil right."
1988.87-1485,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,892.583,900.33,"Mr. Rosen, the hypothesis is that after taking into all, account all of those factors the judge concludes that $50,000 is a reasonable fee."
1988.87-1485,0,46021,william_w_rosen,,906.444,918.512,"--I would have to say that, if the court said a reasonable fee was $50,000, then under that civil... if the only issue was the civil rights case--"
1988.87-1485,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,918.512,919.101,Correct.
1988.87-1485,0,46021,william_w_rosen,,919.101,923.315,"--Then I think that $50,000 must be accepted as the reasonable fee."
1988.87-1485,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,923.315,929.018,And that a private contractual arrangement in the civil rights area for a higher fee would be unenforceable as a matter of federal law.
1988.87-1485,0,46021,william_w_rosen,,929.018,933.741,Unless there was an enhancement factor that the court looked at.
1988.87-1485,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,933.741,934.201,"No, no."
1988.87-1485,0,46021,william_w_rosen,,948.101,953.855,"I think in the civil rights area I have to argue that is, that is the correct fee, if the court says it is the correct fee."
1988.87-1485,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,953.855,957.375,The state court too?
1988.87-1485,0,46021,william_w_rosen,,957.375,963.58,"I'm not sure that applies to the state court too, if there is a state, if there is a state issue involved in it."
1988.87-1485,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,975.388,976.689,"No, that's not my point."
1988.87-1485,0,46021,william_w_rosen,,992.04,1003.787,--I think under the rulings of this Court in the supremacy area that the federal civil rights acts are supreme to that issue also.
1988.87-1485,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1007.258,1014.343,"You said in the contract, if I win, if I win I will give you 40 percent of what I make."
1988.87-1485,0,46021,william_w_rosen,,1027.941,1033.896,--I do not believe it would be enforceable if the federal court had determined a reasonable fee.
1988.87-1485,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1033.896,1038.62,And the state court couldn't enforce a state contract?
1988.87-1485,0,46021,william_w_rosen,,1038.62,1047.226,The state court could enforce a state contract were it not for the holdings of this Court in the area of supremacy of the civil rights statute.
1988.87-1485,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1061.475,1064.666,"Well, you can get disputes as to what's reasonable fee."
1988.87-1485,0,46021,william_w_rosen,,1072.261,1079.646,"Well, it's clear that both in state and federal law, clear certainly in Louisiana that cases go back to, I think, 1934--"
1988.87-1485,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1079.646,1080.387,I'm talking about Louisiana.
1988.87-1485,0,46021,william_w_rosen,,1080.387,1091.534,"--That if I took a 70 percent contingent fee contract the courts are going to review it, because the courts have final jurisdiction to review attorney's fees."
1988.87-1485,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1248.096,1252.87,"You're going to add the secretarial time, paper, paper clips?"
1988.87-1485,0,46021,william_w_rosen,,1252.87,1253.87,"--No, sir."
1988.87-1485,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1253.87,1254.691,Electricity?
1988.87-1485,0,46021,william_w_rosen,,1254.691,1255.432,"No, sir."
1988.87-1485,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1273.435,1276.677,"Of course, in my day, we didn't charge for paralegals either."
1988.87-1485,0,46021,william_w_rosen,,1283.72,1286.911,"--Well, I, I don't want to use a crystal ball, Justice Blackmun, but--"
1988.87-1485,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1286.911,1289.232,Anything to increase it.
1988.87-1485,0,46021,william_w_rosen,,1289.232,1301.702,"--I might add that in, since I have been practicing, I do not know of any firm that does not charge a market rate to its clients of paralegals and law clerk time."
1988.87-1485,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1322.044,1324.077,What do you mean when you say they're a profession?
1988.87-1485,0,46021,william_w_rosen,,1324.077,1325.357,Absolutely--
1988.87-1485,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1325.357,1327.758,"Well, I said what do you mean when you say they're a profession?"
1988.87-1485,0,46021,william_w_rosen,,1330.209,1336.964,"--They are trained, they have a course of study, they are certified."
1988.87-1485,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1353.377,1361.952,But are their duties more akin to what a lawyer performs or more akin to what a secretary traditionally performed?
1988.87-1485,0,46021,william_w_rosen,,1361.952,1367.525,My opinion is they are much more akin to what a lawyer performs than what a secretary performs.
1988.87-1485,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1367.525,1370.177,Do you charge for Lexis and Westlaw?
1988.87-1485,0,46021,william_w_rosen,,1370.177,1376.441,"I think there is a... I don't personally have Lexis and Westlaw, but I think there usually is a charge for--"
1988.87-1485,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1376.441,1379.994,"Well, in Louisiana do they usually charge for that as a separate item?"
1988.87-1485,0,46021,william_w_rosen,,1379.994,1385.808,"--I think that is charged as a separate item, but I cannot address it because I haven't used that."
1988.87-1485,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1385.808,1392.152,"Actually, they're a paraprofession, aren't they, they're not really a profession?"
1988.87-1485,0,46021,william_w_rosen,,1392.152,1397.706,"Paraprofession, I suppose, is correct."
1988.87-1485,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1449.978,1456.143,"Now, is this a law clerk or a paralegal that you're talking about who drafted the first application for the fee?"
1988.87-1485,0,46021,william_w_rosen,,1456.143,1457.162,A law clerk.
1988.87-1485,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1457.162,1459.846,"Who had, who is in law school?"
1988.87-1485,0,46021,william_w_rosen,,1459.846,1460.525,Correct.
1988.87-1485,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1469.311,1474.576,"Well now, would you have had a paralegal possibly draft a fee application like that?"
1988.87-1485,0,46021,william_w_rosen,,1474.576,1490.985,"Mr. Chief Justice, my opinion is that, if at all possible, law students or law clerks should do the legal research and paralegals, legal assistants, should do the factual part."
1988.87-1485,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1526.899,1531.671,"What does the, what does the paraprofessional do when they're contacting witnesses?"
1988.87-1485,0,46021,william_w_rosen,,1534.283,1535.104,"--Yes, sir."
1988.87-1485,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1535.104,1536.066,By themselves?
1988.87-1485,0,46021,william_w_rosen,,1536.066,1537.175,"Yes, sir."
1988.87-1485,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1540.337,1542.858,And Is that a fairly common thing for them to do?
1988.87-1485,0,46021,william_w_rosen,,1542.858,1545.642,"--It's common in my office, Mr. Chief Justice."
1988.87-1485,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1558.299,1566.157,What if you asked your brother-in-law to go out?
1988.87-1485,0,46021,william_w_rosen,,1571.648,1575.77,"Is he a member of my staff, Justice Scalia?"
1988.87-1485,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1580.865,1583.096,"Oh, well, you offer him 50 bucks if he'll do it."
1988.87-1485,0,46021,william_w_rosen,,1583.096,1587.147,I don't... I would not consider that a paraprofessional.
1988.87-1485,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1587.668,1593.192,"And that's, that's the line, you can't bill it because he's not a paraprofessional?"
1988.87-1485,0,46021,william_w_rosen,,1593.192,1597.706,I would say it is not the common practice.
1988.87-1485,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1631.256,1632.298,Is all that in the record?
1988.87-1485,0,46021,william_w_rosen,,1632.298,1633.52,--I'm sorry--
1988.87-1485,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1633.52,1634.759,Is that in the record?
1988.87-1485,0,46021,william_w_rosen,,1634.759,1636.321,--I'm not--
1988.87-1485,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1636.321,1644.456,"What you've just said, that the custom of billing and all in New Orleans, is that in the record?"
1988.87-1485,0,46021,william_w_rosen,,1644.456,1645.898,"--I think it is, Justice Marshall."
1988.87-1485,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1645.898,1646.357,You think?
1988.87-1485,0,46021,william_w_rosen,,1647.207,1654.102,"I tried the case, but whether or not that particular item is in the record, it is certainly in the briefs, but--"
1988.87-1485,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1654.102,1655.513,Then you should have used a paralegal.
1988.87-1485,0,46021,william_w_rosen,,1655.513,1663.867,--I would like to reserve the rest of the time at the end.
1988.87-1485,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1663.867,1665.8,"Very well, Mr. Rosen."
1988.87-1485,1,22311,edmond_l_guidry_iii,,1669.543,1673.937,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1988.87-1485,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1694.199,1705.358,"Well, are you, are you suggesting that if the fee is limited to $4,000 in this case, that it must come out of their damages?"
1988.87-1485,1,22311,edmond_l_guidry_iii,,1707.419,1708.691,--No.
1988.87-1485,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1713.223,1719.767,"And, so that the Plaintiff is coming out better than his contingent contract--"
1988.87-1485,1,22311,edmond_l_guidry_iii,,1719.767,1721.707,Certainly.
1988.87-1485,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1728.693,1729.164,--Yes.
1988.87-1485,1,22311,edmond_l_guidry_iii,,1729.594,1730.914,The Civil Rights--
1988.87-1485,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1730.914,1732.744,"But the contract didn't provide for that, did it?"
1988.87-1485,1,22311,edmond_l_guidry_iii,,1732.744,1733.635,--I'm sorry?
1988.87-1485,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1733.635,1735.847,"The contract didn't provide for that, did it?"
1988.87-1485,1,22311,edmond_l_guidry_iii,,1735.847,1741.86,The contract simply provided for attorney's fees and 40 percent of the amount of the recovery.
1988.87-1485,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1741.86,1743.653,And the client was liable?
1988.87-1485,1,22311,edmond_l_guidry_iii,,1743.653,1745.003,That's correct.
1988.87-1485,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1745.003,1752.83,So we are going beyond the contingent fee contract in order to reach the result that you explained to Mr. Justice White?
1988.87-1485,1,22311,edmond_l_guidry_iii,,1752.83,1771.97,"In fact you are not, because if the payment of attorney's fees under the statute, as the statute indicates, is made payable to the Plaintiff, then the Plaintiff simply under his attorney's fees contract would then turn over the funds, $4,000, to his attorney and his obligation would be completed."
1988.87-1485,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1771.97,1776.853,But you're arguing that the court is limited and fixed by the terms of the contract.
1988.87-1485,1,22311,edmond_l_guidry_iii,,1783.398,1792.705,"The attorney's fees are set by, by the court, is what they are awarded."
1988.87-1485,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1842.866,1846.78,Why then should the Defendant have to pay anything?
1988.87-1485,1,22311,edmond_l_guidry_iii,,1860.838,1870.556,Because the statute provides that the court may award attorney's fees if a prevailing party is successful in a civil rights action.
1988.87-1485,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1964.156,1967.378,Have you been involved in other litigation like this?
1988.87-1485,1,22311,edmond_l_guidry_iii,,1969.319,1970.621,"No, I have not, Your Honor."
1988.87-1485,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1970.621,1973.213,I wondered that the practice was.
1988.87-1485,1,22311,edmond_l_guidry_iii,,1980.518,1992.764,"In all of the research that I have done, I have not found any, any statutory or jurisprudence that indicates that it should be paid to one or the other."
1988.87-1485,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1992.764,2015.07,"Well, if the District Court says, the statute means what it says, I must award a reasonable attorney's fees to the plaintiff, and a reasonable attorney's fee in this case is $10,000, and he says, pay it to the plaintiff, and it's paid to the plaintiff, do you suppose the plaintiff could then say to his lawyer, sorry, I'm only going to pay you $4,000?"
1988.87-1485,1,22311,edmond_l_guidry_iii,,2015.07,2023.235,I think that he could say that if he had a contingency fee contract that provided for an amount different than the amount awarded by the court.
1988.87-1485,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2025.205,2027.408,"Well, that's this case too."
1988.87-1485,1,22311,edmond_l_guidry_iii,,2033.322,2040.757,I think that's exactly what the Court of Appeals said in this case.
1988.87-1485,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2043.136,2056.327,"Well, your understanding then is in this case, when $7,500 was awarded, the client didn't just keep $4,000, he would keep the whole $7,500 and the lawyer would only get $4,000."
1988.87-1485,1,22311,edmond_l_guidry_iii,,2056.327,2057.008,That's correct.
1988.87-1485,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2057.008,2063.322,"So you two disagree on the meaning of this judgment, if it had just... it says the Plaintiff gets the money."
1988.87-1485,1,22311,edmond_l_guidry_iii,,2067.614,2086.046,"The judgment says that, the statute says the prevailing party, and then the legislative history to the Civil Rights Attorney's Fees Award Act, it indicates that, you know, if victims are to be able to pursue their civil rights, then they must be able to recover what it costs them to--"
1988.87-1485,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2086.046,2100.636,"Of course, actually, I suppose if you read the contract literally, they'd be entitled to, the lawyer would be entitled to 40 percent of the excess, because the recovery included $10,000 plus $7,500, so his 40 percent ought to be on the total $17,500."
1988.87-1485,1,22311,edmond_l_guidry_iii,,2100.636,2105.919,--Depending on whether the contract includes recovery of attorney's fees also.
1988.87-1485,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2105.919,2111.653,"Whereupon you'd have to reopen the judgment to give that excess too, I, I assume."
1988.87-1485,1,22311,edmond_l_guidry_iii,,2111.653,2112.955,Certainly.
1988.87-1485,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2112.955,2115.386,"No, the judgment is for $17,500."
1988.87-1485,1,22311,edmond_l_guidry_iii,,2119.21,2123.79,That's correct... whether or not it would be covered by the contract I'm not certain.
1988.87-1485,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2165.848,2166.968,Excuse me.
1988.87-1485,1,22311,edmond_l_guidry_iii,,2190.196,2191.047,I think--
1988.87-1485,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2191.047,2192.429,And the lawyer never gets anything.
1988.87-1485,1,22311,edmond_l_guidry_iii,,2192.429,2208.1,"--In the case of pro bono work and in the case of public service legal corporations, that Congress by approving the method of payment in Stanford Daly and in the Davis case, which was cited in the history--"
1988.87-1485,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2208.1,2208.8,Where did it prove that?
1988.87-1485,1,22311,edmond_l_guidry_iii,,2208.8,2212.041,--In the legislative history--
1988.87-1485,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2212.041,2212.642,Oh.
1988.87-1485,1,22311,edmond_l_guidry_iii,,2212.642,2230.053,"--To the Civil Rights Attorney's Fees Award Act, Congress cited those two cases as being cases where proper awards were made, one of which was to a, in pro bono work, the other was to a non-profit public service legal corporation."
1988.87-1485,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2245.714,2253.377,"Well, that clear goes... once you concede that you concede the purpose of the act is, goes beyond making the plaintiff whole, once you concede that."
1988.87-1485,1,22311,edmond_l_guidry_iii,,2257.722,2269.219,"Certainly you have to give, you have to make, to make the plaintiff whole you still have to provide these funds, because without these funds these public service corporations would not be able to represent plaintiff."
1988.87-1485,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2325.136,2334.201,"But you don't always know, do you, Mr. Guidry, who all the possible defendants are until you do some investigation or have someone do some investigation for you?"
1988.87-1485,1,22311,edmond_l_guidry_iii,,2334.201,2348.611,"Certainly I think that is true, but you certainly know what you feel is the chance of, of being successful and what type of action you are faced with before you agree to accept the case."
1988.87-1485,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2348.611,2360.039,"Well, does one invariably know when a client walks in the door saying they've sustained some sort of injury, that this is a 1983 case or this is not a 1983 case?"
1988.87-1485,1,22311,edmond_l_guidry_iii,,2360.039,2370.935,"One may not know from the start whether or not it is a 1983 case, but you would not accept the case until you determined what type of case you were faced with."
1988.87-1485,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2370.935,2376.878,You mean you wouldn't accept it until you could tell whether or not it was a 1983 case?
1988.87-1485,1,22311,edmond_l_guidry_iii,,2376.878,2381.232,I would not accept it unless I knew what type of case I was--
1988.87-1485,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2381.232,2385.474,"Well, what do you mean by, what do you mean by the words, ""what type of case""?"
1988.87-1485,1,22311,edmond_l_guidry_iii,,2385.474,2391.067,"--Well, certainly they are, they are... I don't do any Sherman anti-trust work."
1988.87-1485,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2404.568,2420.906,"But a lawyer who, say, specialized in plaintiff's personal injury work might not know just from the client's original recital whether or not there might be some sort of a public defendant that could be joined that would make it, in part, a 1983 case I would think."
1988.87-1485,1,22311,edmond_l_guidry_iii,,2420.906,2422.589,That may be true in other cases.
1988.87-1485,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2432.725,2434.908,"Well, that seems pretty clear."
1988.87-1485,1,22311,edmond_l_guidry_iii,,2434.908,2448.806,"Certainly to the extent that fee awards are intended to reflect fees charged in the marketplace for legal services, enforcement of the contract in this particular case is appropriate."
1988.87-1485,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2491.824,2498.007,"That's an easy question, if we agree with you that the agreed-upon contingency fee is the limit."
1988.87-1485,1,22311,edmond_l_guidry_iii,,2516.37,2522.064,I think that the court can award paralegal time in certain circumstances.
1988.87-1485,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2599.595,2601.014,"Thank you, Mr. Guidry."
1988.87-1485,2,46021,william_w_rosen,,2603.706,2606.089,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1988.87-1485,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2793.911,2794.952,"Thank you, Mr. Rosen."
