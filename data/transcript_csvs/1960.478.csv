1960.478,0,33286,joe_h_tonahill,,7.973,12.602,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1960.478,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,144.215,147.628,"When you say ""appeal"", do you mean appeal?"
1960.478,0,33286,joe_h_tonahill,,147.628,151.85,"Well, appeal a branch that -- to set it aside."
1960.478,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,153.865,156.165,"Well, let -- let's see."
1960.478,0,33286,joe_h_tonahill,,172.718,176.015,"It would -- it would be an appeal, a trial de novo, sir."
1960.478,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,189.135,192.196,An -- a suit filed within 20 days thereafter?
1960.478,0,33286,joe_h_tonahill,,192.196,192.794,"Yes, sir."
1960.478,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,192.912,195.702,"Well, wouldn't that require a pleading under Texas practice?"
1960.478,0,33286,joe_h_tonahill,,195.702,196.293,"Yes, sir."
1960.478,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,196.293,197.262,A complaint?
1960.478,0,33286,joe_h_tonahill,,197.262,198.373,A complaint.
1960.478,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,198.373,202.197,"So that in form, it looks like a -- a new original action, does it?"
1960.478,0,33286,joe_h_tonahill,,202.197,203.162,It is.
1960.478,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,203.162,206.618,"But it is, nevertheless, under your practice, that's an appeal?"
1960.478,0,33286,joe_h_tonahill,,206.618,208.772,"Well, it's -- it's called an appeal."
1960.478,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,212.833,214.845,So what does notice of appeal to mean?
1960.478,0,33286,joe_h_tonahill,,216.881,230.0,"Yes, sir, it has been informed here that the claimant gives notice that he does not satisfy with the Board's award of $1050 and will appeal therefrom in a suit of -- in a court of competent jurisdiction."
1960.478,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,230.0,237.95,"But his appeal has to be, I might be clear about this, his appeal, so named is, in fact, an original complaint and --"
1960.478,0,33286,joe_h_tonahill,,237.95,238.657,That's right.
1960.478,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,238.657,241.316,-- and in what -- so what state court does it go with that original (Voice Overlap) --
1960.478,0,33286,joe_h_tonahill,,241.316,261.199,"Well, that's the -- that's a good -- you're getting right to the heart of it, Your Honor, because under the Workmen's Compensation Law, you can go to either the justice court depending upon the amount of the award or the amount being claimed which has jurisdiction up to $200."
1960.478,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,275.231,279.532,"Now, you said the highest amount that is claimed, did you?"
1960.478,0,33286,joe_h_tonahill,,279.532,280.324,That's -- that's right.
1960.478,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,280.324,281.798,"Now, claimed in what?"
1960.478,0,33286,joe_h_tonahill,,281.798,284.76,Claimed in the claimant's claim that he files with industrial --
1960.478,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,284.76,286.284,And he claims for compensation?
1960.478,0,33286,joe_h_tonahill,,286.284,287.642,"Yes, sir."
1960.478,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,304.536,306.41,"Now, what court do they go to then in --"
1960.478,0,33286,joe_h_tonahill,,306.41,307.362,Federal court.
1960.478,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,307.362,308.803,"No, no."
1960.478,0,33286,joe_h_tonahill,,313.06,314.114,We went to state court --
1960.478,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,314.114,314.196,You went to the state --
1960.478,0,33286,joe_h_tonahill,,314.196,315.437,-- and back to the federal court.
1960.478,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,315.437,317.644,"Now, you went to the -- what state court did you go?"
1960.478,0,33286,joe_h_tonahill,,317.644,320.549,"In the county where the injury arose, Orange County District -- District Court."
1960.478,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,320.549,322.07,In the county -- to the District Court.
1960.478,0,33286,joe_h_tonahill,,322.07,322.867,District Court of Orange County.
1960.478,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,322.867,325.61,Because you claim something in excess of $1000?
1960.478,0,33286,joe_h_tonahill,,325.61,326.232,That's right.
1960.478,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,326.232,327.012,I see.
1960.478,0,33286,joe_h_tonahill,,331.191,338.307,"The respondent, on the date of the award, give notice of appeal that same date and filed suit in the federal court in Beaumont, Texas."
1960.478,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,338.307,340.148,Instead of going to any state court.
1960.478,0,33286,joe_h_tonahill,,340.148,345.112,"Instead of going to state court, they could have gone to District Court where we went."
1960.478,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,349.927,353.683,"Now, they could have gone to the state court because the amount was $1050, is that right?"
1960.478,0,33286,joe_h_tonahill,,353.683,356.035,"That's the only court we say that could have gone to, Your Honor."
1960.478,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,356.035,357.69,Because it's $1050.
1960.478,0,33286,joe_h_tonahill,,357.69,358.301,That's right.
1960.478,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,358.301,361.639,"$50 over the jurisdictional limit of the county court, is that it?"
1960.478,0,33286,joe_h_tonahill,,361.639,363.028,That's exactly the point.
1960.478,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,363.028,363.897,Yes.
1960.478,0,33286,joe_h_tonahill,,363.897,373.384,But -- and they raise to the court of that charge in filing their notice of appeal and a suit the same day.
1960.478,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,379.807,381.412,"May I ask you, sir?"
1960.478,0,33286,joe_h_tonahill,,401.495,407.894,"So far as the insurance company is concerned, it would be the amount claimed by the Commission if they should --"
1960.478,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,407.894,409.497,From a claimed award.
1960.478,0,33286,joe_h_tonahill,,409.497,412.264,It should -- it should be the amount awarded by the Commission.
1960.478,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,452.589,458.831,(Inaudible)
1960.478,0,33286,joe_h_tonahill,,458.831,459.439,"Yes, sir."
1960.478,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,459.439,473.648,(Inaudible)
1960.478,0,33286,joe_h_tonahill,,473.648,488.769,"The insurer can go the justice court or to the county court or to the District Court because under the state rule -- under the state rule, jurisdiction can be fixed in the highest court because of the highest amount claimed to the highest amount awarded."
1960.478,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,551.59,564.774,"Suppose the insurance company takes it up, takes it up, the award of $1000, original claim was $14,000, is there any way the insurance company then can be made to pay the $14,000 after it takes it up?"
1960.478,0,33286,joe_h_tonahill,,564.774,568.013,Only after a trial and -- and judgment.
1960.478,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,568.013,569.677,They could -- they could be made to pay?
1960.478,0,33286,joe_h_tonahill,,569.677,570.234,"Oh, yes, sir."
1960.478,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,582.57,584.269,But only if you counterclaim.
1960.478,0,33286,joe_h_tonahill,,584.269,584.693,That's right.
1960.478,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,585.517,585.969,He --
1960.478,0,33286,joe_h_tonahill,,585.969,586.467,-- we did --
1960.478,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,586.467,587.457,"-- he has to counterclaim, doesn't he?"
1960.478,0,33286,joe_h_tonahill,,587.457,589.228,He has to or he's -- he's out.
1960.478,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,603.822,606.563,(Inaudible)
1960.478,0,33286,joe_h_tonahill,,606.563,607.548,Anytime.
1960.478,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,607.548,612.461,(Inaudible)
1960.478,0,33286,joe_h_tonahill,,612.461,617.291,"It's exactly like the Collins case, in a condemnation suit, Your Honor, no difference."
1960.478,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,617.291,618.837,A jury trial in the court?
1960.478,0,33286,joe_h_tonahill,,618.837,619.335,"Yes, sir."
1960.478,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,621.964,622.56,In justice court?
1960.478,0,33286,joe_h_tonahill,,622.56,624.217,-- you have a right of proper jury trial.
1960.478,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,624.217,626.033,Even in justice court?
1960.478,0,33286,joe_h_tonahill,,626.033,626.719,"Yes, sir."
1960.478,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,633.688,644.797,"In -- in this case, did the claimant infinitively claimed merely what the -- we all Board awarded him a $1000?"
1960.478,0,33286,joe_h_tonahill,,651.229,653.047,"He -- he very well could, Your Honor."
1960.478,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,653.047,654.475,"No, no."
1960.478,0,33286,joe_h_tonahill,,673.891,674.464,"No, Your Honor."
1960.478,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,675.849,676.098,Alright.
1960.478,0,33286,joe_h_tonahill,,676.098,677.734,-- before the Industrial Accident Board.
1960.478,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,677.734,683.479,"But did he thereafter -- the Industrial Accident Board went against him, didn't it?"
1960.478,0,33286,joe_h_tonahill,,683.479,685.396,They -- they wanted -- they gave him only $1050.
1960.478,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,685.396,687.784,They went against him for the -- for the larger amount.
1960.478,0,33286,joe_h_tonahill,,687.784,688.385,That's right.
1960.478,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,688.385,701.788,"What I want to know is that he take a step in the course of this litigation whereby he, infinitively, finally never would claim more than $1000?"
1960.478,0,33286,joe_h_tonahill,,701.788,702.776,"No, no, Your Honor."
1960.478,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,704.31,704.606,Alright.
1960.478,0,33286,joe_h_tonahill,,704.606,717.525,"-- compulsory counterclaim subject to his motion to dismiss, and federal court will lack the jurisdiction and then in state court, he filed his suit to appeal from the Board's awards set for the maximum amount."
1960.478,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,717.525,724.191,"So that he is still subject to all qualification you give him, he is still was out to get $14,000, is that right?"
1960.478,0,33286,joe_h_tonahill,,724.191,727.822,"Yes, sir, but he wanted to get it in the court of his choice that Congress gave him in --"
1960.478,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,727.822,729.028,I understand.
1960.478,0,33286,joe_h_tonahill,,729.028,731.209,-- in the amendment in 1958.
1960.478,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,731.209,732.327,The whole --
1960.478,0,33286,joe_h_tonahill,,732.327,732.986,He -- and --
1960.478,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,732.986,733.634,The whole question.
1960.478,0,33286,joe_h_tonahill,,733.634,736.844,-- and that too is a very valuable right that he is claiming.
1960.478,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,749.852,751.971,"Well, I think -- I think you want to get into the legal question."
1960.478,0,33286,joe_h_tonahill,,760.416,761.485,"No, sir."
1960.478,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,767.615,771.268,"I know Texas is of a great State but it hasn't different currency, does it?"
1960.478,0,33286,joe_h_tonahill,,771.268,776.755,"No, [Laughs] I don't think there's any different (Inaudible) Massachusetts Your Honor."
1960.478,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,787.092,799.527,"Are you saying that in determining the jurisdictions of federal court, it got to go on what the company claim and disregard what the claimant claim?"
1960.478,0,33286,joe_h_tonahill,,799.527,803.29,Not entirely for state court jurisdictional purpose -- purposes.
1960.478,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,803.29,805.515,"So, what about federal court jurisdiction?"
1960.478,0,33286,joe_h_tonahill,,805.583,810.524,"The only -- the only point in federal court jurisdiction is the amount of the Board's award, Your Honor."
1960.478,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,816.542,817.378,I understand that.
1960.478,0,33286,joe_h_tonahill,,826.842,827.251,That's right.
1960.478,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,827.251,830.284,And your federal court has jurisdiction to try if it has jurisdiction.
1960.478,0,33286,joe_h_tonahill,,830.284,831.29,If it has jurisdiction --
1960.478,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,831.29,831.315,Yes.
1960.478,0,33286,joe_h_tonahill,,831.315,832.33,"-- in the first instance, yes, sir."
1960.478,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,832.33,833.151,That's right.
1960.478,0,33286,joe_h_tonahill,,846.138,849.366,"Exactly, and it must exceed $10,000."
1960.478,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,849.366,871.667,"What you're saying is that on your view of the diversity statute, a removed plaintiff can keep a litigation -- keep a litigation out of the federal court by making a different monetary claim in the state court from the federal court."
1960.478,0,33286,joe_h_tonahill,,872.463,873.505,He can claim less.
1960.478,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,874.093,876.531,"Well, Mr. Tonahill, now you said a removed plaintiff."
1960.478,0,33286,joe_h_tonahill,,886.411,887.216,That's true.
1960.478,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,887.216,894.365,"-- to review or rather -- if that's the right word, in any event, they get to set aside the $10,050 award maybe."
1960.478,0,33286,joe_h_tonahill,,894.365,894.499,That's --
1960.478,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,894.499,896.084,So this is not a removed action (Voice Overlap) --
1960.478,0,33286,joe_h_tonahill,,896.084,897.841,This is an original action.
1960.478,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,915.008,922.785,"You already -- your counterclaim means that if the jurisdiction is decided against you and you'll get up your addendum and go for $14,000."
1960.478,0,33286,joe_h_tonahill,,922.785,923.595,"That's right, Your Honor."
1960.478,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,924.579,925.834,I'm not saying you're not entitled.
1960.478,0,33286,joe_h_tonahill,,927.406,932.397,"That's the first case we had in mind, Davis versus Department of Labor.[Laughs]"
1960.478,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,932.397,938.113,"Could they remove the -- could they remove the case to the federal courts, your case in the -- in the state court?"
1960.478,0,33286,joe_h_tonahill,,938.113,941.134,"No, Your Honor, because Congress forbid that in 1958."
1960.478,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,941.134,943.472,That you rely on the 1958 Act?
1960.478,0,33286,joe_h_tonahill,,943.472,944.098,"Exactly, sir."
1960.478,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,944.098,944.529,Yes.
1960.478,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,944.529,949.63,And you're clear that this -- that this must be -- that this is not within the 1958 limitation?
1960.478,0,33286,joe_h_tonahill,,949.63,950.579,"No, sir."
1960.478,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,950.579,951.269,Pardon me?
1960.478,0,33286,joe_h_tonahill,,951.269,955.615,It's -- it's not within -- it's $1050 in the 1958 limitation.

1960.478,0,33286,joe_h_tonahill,,991.133,993.455,Relying on our claim before the Board.

1960.478,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,999.941,1021.032,"Your claim is, conversely, that you can -- you can -- of the diversity jurisdiction act, as it now stand, permits you to cut down what was your initial claim by sending it on -- on what the Board allows you rather what you claim, is that right?"
1960.478,0,33286,joe_h_tonahill,,1021.032,1022.283,"That's right, sir."
1960.478,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1022.283,1022.413,Now --
1960.478,0,33286,joe_h_tonahill,,1022.413,1022.727,It gives --
1960.478,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1022.727,1030.779,"-- however -- however, plus the fact that if this case goes to trial, you will be beyond the $10,000 limit."
1960.478,0,33286,joe_h_tonahill,,1030.779,1031.952,"We could be, we couldn't be."
1960.478,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1034.378,1036.096,But why did you didn't?
1960.478,0,33286,joe_h_tonahill,,1036.096,1036.887,That's right.
1960.478,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1036.887,1038.981,"Why did you didn't, to claim law?"
1960.478,0,33286,joe_h_tonahill,,1038.981,1044.0,"We -- we claim more subject to our county, subject to a motion to dismiss though in the federal court."
1960.478,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1044.0,1048.776,"What I understand on your counterclaim, if you can win on your motion to dismiss to get that out of (Voice Overlap) --"

1960.478,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1053.657,1055.907,It shows what a beautiful thing diversity of jurisdiction is.
1960.478,0,33286,joe_h_tonahill,,1055.907,1063.185,That's a wonderful thing.[Laughter]
1960.478,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1063.185,1065.581,Mr. VanDercreek.

1960.478,1,46451,william_vandercreek,,1105.23,1105.467,We're --
1960.478,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1105.467,1112.153,-- that he already attempt the exact words of the statute referring to diversity jurisdiction?
1960.478,1,46451,william_vandercreek,,1112.153,1113.413,Section 1332 --
1960.478,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1113.413,1113.629,Yes.
1960.478,1,46451,william_vandercreek,,1122.239,1133.784,"The diversity court shall have original jurisdiction of all civil actions where the matter in controversy exceeds the sum or value of $10,000 exclusive of interest and cost."
1960.478,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1176.089,1176.969,May I ask you this?
1960.478,1,46451,william_vandercreek,,1176.969,1177.093,"Yes, sir."
1960.478,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1177.093,1215.098,"After the -- suppose you hadn't counterclaim subject to your jurisdictional resistance, suppose you hadn't counterclaim and the opinion of the Court of Appeals has prevailed, that is, that there was jurisdiction, but you did not counterclaim in terms, suppose the case has gone back to the District Court, could you then, after it got that, have -- has -- somehow rather putting your counterclaim, would you been foreclosed after litigation started?"
1960.478,1,46451,william_vandercreek,,1215.098,1217.231,"We could have been foreclosed, Your Honor."
1960.478,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1217.964,1219.266,I don't mean you could have been.
1960.478,1,46451,william_vandercreek,,1220.468,1222.238,"We don't know, Your Honor."
1960.478,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1222.3,1223.347,What does that came on?
1960.478,1,46451,william_vandercreek,,1223.347,1223.881,Sir?
1960.478,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1223.881,1226.158,But what does that came on?
1960.478,1,46451,william_vandercreek,,1226.158,1234.658,"Well, the time limit for filing a counterclaim whether it'd expired would have obtained permission of the District Court to then file a late counterclaim."
1960.478,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1234.658,1247.307,"Suppose the -- suppose the time -- there were no time pressure, could you, as a matter of right, counterclaim after the case got into the court, into the District Court?"
1960.478,1,46451,william_vandercreek,,1247.307,1252.217,"If our time limit has expired, here is the problem on that, Your Honor."
1960.478,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1284.375,1295.758,"I'll take all the question of statutes of -- statutes of limitation whether by statute or state law or rule regarding the case, what I want to know is this, because I do not know, I'm ignorant."
1960.478,1,46451,william_vandercreek,,1295.758,1296.085,[Laughs]
1960.478,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1296.085,1300.573,I haven't got the rules in my head.
1960.478,1,46451,william_vandercreek,,1319.815,1320.323,"Yes, sir."
1960.478,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1321.548,1322.664,The employee could.
1960.478,1,46451,william_vandercreek,,1322.664,1328.369,"He could counterclaim for -- in this case, for any amount up to $14,035."
1960.478,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1330.118,1339.769,"And that -- and the amount -- the amount up to which he could counterclaim although he didn't counterclaim, to begin with, would be determined by state law, is that correct?"
1960.478,1,46451,william_vandercreek,,1339.769,1340.091,Right.
1960.478,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1346.963,1365.392,"So, assuming -- putting so on the basis of what you tell me as the law, whether you could counterclaim to an amount beyond $10,000 would depend upon the specific facts of the -- of the particular litigation but not the federal rules of federal law, is that correct?"
1960.478,1,46451,william_vandercreek,,1365.392,1366.018,"Yes, Your Honor."
1960.478,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1368.908,1369.255,State.
1960.478,1,46451,william_vandercreek,,1369.255,1370.372,-- state courts and his trying to report --
1960.478,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1370.372,1376.899,"So, he could counterclaim although he only got -- although the suit is merely -- the award is merely for --"
1960.478,1,46451,william_vandercreek,,1376.899,1376.953,Yes.
1960.478,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1376.953,1377.486,-- much lesser amount.
1960.478,1,46451,william_vandercreek,,1377.486,1380.261,"As Mr. Tonahill pointed out, either party can move --"
1960.478,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1380.261,1380.383,Alright.
1960.478,1,46451,william_vandercreek,,1380.383,1382.171,-- to set aside the Board's award.
1960.478,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1382.171,1387.75,"So that this litigation which started, forget all about statutes of limitation, I don't mean that they wouldn't be bear apart."
1960.478,1,46451,william_vandercreek,,1387.75,1390.939,"Well, this is why we have to counterclaim because we were worried about that, Your Honor."
1960.478,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1390.939,1402.739,So that -- so that this suit begun in the District Court for an amount of $1000 could exceed the statutory limit.
1960.478,1,46451,william_vandercreek,,1402.739,1405.116,"No question about that, Your Honor."
1960.478,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1410.657,1413.188,"I can assure you, I'm not thinking because I'm right in the case."
1960.478,1,46451,william_vandercreek,,1415.211,1419.147,Beg the Court's apology.
1960.478,1,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,1653.403,1654.502,Can I ask you a question?
1960.478,1,46451,william_vandercreek,,1658.156,1659.43,"Yes, sir."

1960.478,1,46451,william_vandercreek,,1863.929,1867.119,"I certainly do in the appendix to our main brief, Your Honor."
1960.478,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1877.053,1878.248,I don't care about the statistics.

1960.478,1,46451,william_vandercreek,,2090.178,2091.427,-- would be very proper to abstain.
1960.478,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2091.427,2105.448,"-- was there anything in the legislative history concerning the increase from $3000 to $10,000 which indicated that that increase was made in part to keep out of federal court's original actions of this kind from Texas (Voice Overlap) --"
1960.478,1,46451,william_vandercreek,,2105.448,2117.145,"Yes, Your Honor, because it expressly states in the Report that one of the purposes of increasing jurisdictional amount was to avoid the federal courts from furthering away their time and trial of petty controversies."
1960.478,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2119.128,2130.957,"Now, was there specific reference or expressed reference rather to the problem in Texas and Louisiana has one of the reasons why the amount was increased from $3000 to $10,000."

1960.478,1,46451,william_vandercreek,,2149.771,2150.53,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1960.478,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2150.53,2155.564,"Well, now, the -- the prohibition against removal couldn't have affected the original Act?"
1960.478,1,46451,william_vandercreek,,2155.564,2169.39,"Well, I don't have any later statistics but I believe the administrative officer of United States courts will bear me out on this that there are very few cases now being filed as original actions in federal court after the prohibition of removal."
1960.478,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2177.497,2180.43,"Oh, these original actions then are employees, I see."

1960.478,1,46451,william_vandercreek,,2335.343,2354.205,"With reference to your first question on the Winter Haven case, the only case which I could cite back would be Louisiana Power and Light Company versus City of Thibodaux, I certainly grant, Your Honor, that case can be distinguished from the facts in this particular proceeding."
1960.478,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2416.217,2442.871,"But what you are really urging, as I understand it, is although Congress specifically used the word ""removal"", even what is normally so technical term as removed may, in the context of the whole history of this legislation on the report, have a broader meaning, namely, anything that get to the court after it had a beginning in the Workmen's Compensation Board."
1960.478,1,46451,william_vandercreek,,2447.133,2448.663,"Yes, I think that's a fair statement --"
1960.478,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2448.663,2449.369,Alright.
1960.478,1,46451,william_vandercreek,,2449.369,2450.325,-- Your Honor.
1960.478,1,46451,william_vandercreek,,2462.155,2469.02,We feel that the -- all decisions of this Court in determining the amount in controversy had based upon the plaintiff's claim.
1960.478,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2469.02,2470.302,But that's a different -- that's a different thing.
1960.478,1,46451,william_vandercreek,,2479.237,2480.661,"Yes, because that's his cause of action."

1960.478,1,46451,william_vandercreek,,2507.101,2512.296,"Well, there's one thing that would handicap me in answering completely yes that -- Your Honor."
1960.478,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2526.177,2531.533,"Well, aren't there some States in which the employee can go to the federal courts to begin with?"

1960.478,2,26666,howell_cobb,,3568.523,3571.084,"Yes, sir and he can -- and he can go to file on that."
1960.478,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3571.54,3576.431,"But Mr. Cobb, the Chief Justice gave a supposition which negative to that."
1960.478,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3576.431,3578.622,Exactly.
1960.478,2,26666,howell_cobb,,3578.622,3583.672,"Well, the -- maybe I miss the point completely."
1960.478,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3583.761,3586.826,I must say -- I don't think you fully comprehended the Chief Justice's question.
1960.478,2,26666,howell_cobb,,3586.826,3587.498,Then -- then I --
1960.478,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3587.498,3598.468,"He does precisely what Justice Whittaker just put in legal terms, namely, he formally said, ""My counterclaim will be only for $9999."""

1960.478,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3606.64,3609.922,"Well, that's -- that's the -- that's the point that remained."
1960.478,2,26666,howell_cobb,,3609.922,3610.371,"Alright, sir."
1960.478,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3610.371,3619.895,"The court wouldn't have jurisdiction if all he was seeking in -- in that court was less than $10,000 and that court would not have jurisdiction."

1960.478,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3632.955,3636.011,But that would divest the -- the court of jurisdiction.
1960.478,2,26666,howell_cobb,,3636.011,3644.236,I think it would be a judicial mission that he wouldn't entitle to more than the -- the Supreme -- than the jurisdictional amount.

1960.478,2,26666,howell_cobb,,3668.633,3676.732,"And -- and second reason is that when the award is appealed from, it's vacated and then there's nothing left for us to find and file a lawsuit in the federal court."
1960.478,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3682.958,3692.432,So the -- so you think it's just a question of -- of a race between the courthouse and the federal courts to determine jurisdiction in this manner?

1960.478,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3940.729,3944.531,"Assuming you go on to the State District Court, you don't enter unanimously (Voice Overlap) --"
1960.478,2,26666,howell_cobb,,3944.531,3950.639,"Well, you -- I think you still don't do until the State Senate passes it which they haven't done yet."
1960.478,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3952.541,3955.273,Can't you now (Inaudible)
1960.478,2,26666,howell_cobb,,3955.273,3956.975,"Well, it's -- it is still unanimous --"
1960.478,3,46451,william_vandercreek,,5012.571,5015.977,"We have just one comment to make and reply, Your Honor."
1960.478,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5062.063,5069.742,"So under that case -- under that case, he must file a counterclaim for anything he expects to get, is that right?"
1960.478,3,46451,william_vandercreek,,5069.742,5074.518,"If he wants to get any compensation, he is going to have to file some sort of counterclaim, that is correct, Your Honor."
1960.478,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5074.518,5079.969,Do you mean get any compensation or anything in excess of the award?
1960.478,3,46451,william_vandercreek,,5079.969,5085.695,Under Texas' practices theory will be to actually file a -- a counterclaim.
1960.478,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5087.616,5088.598,"Oh, what happened in this case --"
1960.478,3,46451,william_vandercreek,,5088.598,5089.762,-- entitled to the Board's award.
1960.478,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5089.762,5093.077,-- what happened in this case that you cited this truly well (Voice Overlap) --
1960.478,3,46451,william_vandercreek,,5093.077,5094.721,In the Morris case --
1960.478,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5094.721,5095.011,Yes.
1960.478,3,46451,william_vandercreek,,5095.011,5101.483,"-- the Board awarded, as I recall, around $300."
1960.478,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5144.896,5147.795,"I don't follow this -- take nothing, why would take nothing?"
1960.478,3,46451,william_vandercreek,,5149.117,5159.519,"He ain't going to think, Your Honor, because when the insurance company came in to set aside the Board's award unless he comes in and stands on his two feet and presents his claim, he's all through."
1960.478,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5159.519,5162.899,And -- and he wasn't allowed to present his -- his claim (Voice Overlap) --
1960.478,3,46451,william_vandercreek,,5162.899,5165.273,"Well, he just moved to dismiss for want of jurisdiction."
1960.478,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5177.013,5180.778,You mean he was not allowed to offer his evidence in the county court?
1960.478,3,46451,william_vandercreek,,5180.778,5180.98,That is true.
1960.478,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5180.98,5183.394,"And this because he had not filed a counterclaim, is that it?"
1960.478,3,46451,william_vandercreek,,5183.394,5183.695,Yes.
1960.478,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5187.352,5190.365,"So won by default so to speak, is that it?"
1960.478,3,46451,william_vandercreek,,5190.365,5198.667,Won by default because his motion to dismiss for want of jurisdiction is bad court rule in motion to dismiss want of jurisdiction and holding there was jurisdiction.
1960.478,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5207.571,5209.665,Because he has not filed the counterclaim.
1960.478,3,46451,william_vandercreek,,5209.665,5210.82,"That is precisely correct, Your Honor."
1960.478,3,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,5210.82,5212.678,(Inaudible)
1960.478,3,46451,william_vandercreek,,5212.678,5218.837,"It's Morris versus Maryland Casualty Company, 130 S.W.2d 1080."
1960.478,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5232.252,5235.522,"May I ask you, Mr. VanDercreek, before you sit down?"
1960.478,3,46451,william_vandercreek,,5259.194,5268.952,"No, I was -- as a matter of fact, I would say that most of the petitions filed with the Board would probably be for -- well, let me say I don't know first of all."
1960.478,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5301.482,5306.357,"Now, is there also a practice in that stating any amount in the petition?"
1960.478,3,46451,william_vandercreek,,5306.357,5307.571,"Yes, there is."
1960.478,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5345.217,5368.891,"Well, then, in the Texas -- in the Texas courts, could a man say, ""I -- I lost my finger, and I'm therefore permanently and entirely incapacitated,"" and -- without -- without specifying any amount of -- of damages can then get an award?"
1960.478,3,46451,william_vandercreek,,5368.891,5369.451,"Yes, he could."
1960.478,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5369.742,5381.771,"And as I understood Mr. Cobb that in those circumstances, if the award was less than the $10,000, the federal court would not have jurisdiction."

1960.478,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5389.499,5389.762,Yes.
1960.478,4,26666,howell_cobb,,5390.987,5398.274,"I -- I meant the claim amount there if, for specific injury, let anything less than total and permanent disability or death."
1960.478,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5402.563,5402.992,Yes.
1960.478,4,26666,howell_cobb,,5402.992,5403.414,Thank you.
1960.478,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5403.414,5404.341,Anything?
1960.478,4,26666,howell_cobb,,5408.666,5409.709,Sir?
1960.478,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5409.709,5412.853,And no total and permanent disability is claimed.
1960.478,4,26666,howell_cobb,,5412.853,5413.253,"Yes, sir."
1960.478,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5418.116,5418.851,Yes.
1960.478,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5418.851,5418.965,Did he --
1960.478,5,46451,william_vandercreek,,5418.965,5422.731,"But he claims the loss of a leg, he also claimed total and permanent --"
1960.478,5,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5422.731,5422.798,Yes.
1960.478,5,46451,william_vandercreek,,5422.798,5423.148,-- before the Board.
1960.478,5,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5423.148,5424.538,"Before you sit down, Mr. VenDercreek."
1960.478,5,46451,william_vandercreek,,5460.307,5471.379,"The award which -- which, itself, is -- supersedes the administrative claim is, in itself, set aside by the filing of the suit."
1960.478,5,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5473.861,5476.503,Would the fact -- I didn't make my question clear.
1960.478,5,46451,william_vandercreek,,5486.842,5487.423,"No, Your Honor."
1960.478,5,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5488.951,5489.08,Alright.
1960.478,5,46451,william_vandercreek,,5489.08,5489.615,-- the correct answer --
1960.478,5,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5489.615,5489.956,They don't (Voice Overlap) --
1960.478,5,46451,william_vandercreek,,5489.956,5492.883,-- neither with the claim filed before the Board.
1960.478,5,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5493.649,5495.469,"(Voice Overlap) -- pleadings to the jury, I gather in your --"
1960.478,5,46451,william_vandercreek,,5495.469,5508.322,"Not and then ask could you -- it's jurisdictional of the award and the claim, a matter which is explained in the Booth, and you do have to put in your pleadings and as he did, I believe, it's on page -- top of page 3 of the record, asked for it to be set aside."
1960.478,5,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5508.322,5515.383,But the fact of the amount would not appear -- would have to be kept out of the litigation in the court.
1960.478,5,46451,william_vandercreek,,5515.383,5519.404,"Yes, he cannot tell the jury, ""You got an award for such and such."""
1960.478,5,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5522.293,5529.011,Very well.
