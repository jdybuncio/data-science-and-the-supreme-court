1974.73-938,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,12.833,"We'll hear arguments next in 73-938, Cox Broadcasting against Martin Cohn."
1974.73-938,0,33898,kirk_m_mcalpin,,16.331,19.897,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1974.73-938,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,65.742,67.59,"You're going to deal with jurisdiction and due course, I take it."
1974.73-938,0,33898,kirk_m_mcalpin,,67.59,68.518,"Yes, sir."
1974.73-938,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,301.976,305.352,Where do you -- what case of our do you get the presumption of invalidity from?
1974.73-938,0,33898,kirk_m_mcalpin,,305.352,307.709,The Keefe case.
1974.73-938,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,307.709,311.615,"But that was a -- that was a prior injunctive restraint, wasn't it?"
1974.73-938,0,33898,kirk_m_mcalpin,,311.615,317.656,That was a preliminary injunction and brought by -- they are passing leaflets and blockbusting.
1974.73-938,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,317.656,317.864,Yes.
1974.73-938,0,33898,kirk_m_mcalpin,,326.35,337.007,"But Your Honor, nobody else can make it and if we don't resolve this case and if we are entitled and I want to deal with the factual circumstances in this case."
1974.73-938,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,353.695,360.511,"Well, then in your view, all First Amendment cases involve prior restraint?"
1974.73-938,0,33898,kirk_m_mcalpin,,360.511,362.169,Not necessarily.
1974.73-938,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,362.169,371.969,"Well, what wouldn't under that analysis if you're -- you're always going to have some sanctions that you feel that you would have (Voice Overlap) after."
1974.73-938,0,33898,kirk_m_mcalpin,,371.969,374.576,You held that a judgment is a state restraint.
1974.73-938,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,385.973,391.879,"Are they all prior restraint so, that's the issue that we're focusing on now?"
1974.73-938,0,33898,kirk_m_mcalpin,,391.879,394.896,"Well, I think this case is a prior restraint."
1974.73-938,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,423.958,434.432,But Mr. McAlpin didn't -- as I read the opinion of the Supreme Court of Georgia and I'm looking at jurisdictional statement page 812 and 813.
1974.73-938,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,443.9,447.979,"You have to discern, there is 824 and read their opinion on motion for rehearing."
1974.73-938,0,33898,kirk_m_mcalpin,,447.979,448.499,"Yes, sir."
1974.73-938,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,448.499,449.899,Where they do rely on the statute.
1974.73-938,0,33898,kirk_m_mcalpin,,449.899,451.567,"In the second case, Your Honor --"
1974.73-938,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,451.567,458.423,They may rely on it but they say that independent -- do they say that only the existence of the statute (Voice Overlap)?
1974.73-938,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,458.423,460.065,Yes.
1974.73-938,0,33898,kirk_m_mcalpin,,460.065,461.23,"Excuse me, Your Honor."
1974.73-938,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,461.23,463.239,Creates the cause of action?
1974.73-938,0,33898,kirk_m_mcalpin,,463.239,464.812,"Yes sir, in the second (Voice Overlap)."
1974.73-938,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,464.812,483.07,"The Georgia law, generally, is that a truthful report of a matter of general interest is -- cannot make anybody liable in Georgia and that's well settled that they say that because of the statute, the Georgia legislature is held that this is not a matter of general interest."
1974.73-938,0,33898,kirk_m_mcalpin,,483.07,483.963,That's correct Your Honor.
1974.73-938,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,484.772,494.297,So the statute is essential to blind liability on this lawsuit and that's what the opinion on motion for rehearing makes clear beginning on page 824?
1974.73-938,0,33898,kirk_m_mcalpin,,494.297,495.123,That's correct.
1974.73-938,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,495.123,508.129,I would suppose your answer to Justice Rehnquist to be that Mills against Alabama is your case that would indicate there might be jurisdiction here rather than the Citizens for Better Austin against Keefe which is an injunction case.
1974.73-938,0,33898,kirk_m_mcalpin,,509.785,519.299,"Mills versus Alabama, the only reason I didn't -- we rely on our brief on Mills versus Alabama also in North Dakota Pharmacy, Snyder, and Tornillo."
1974.73-938,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,570.718,591.251,"Well, my question here it was not a just to the jurisdictional issue contrary to Justice Stewart suggest and I think you responded along the lines I have anticipated but you style this as a prior restraint and I have thought that the distinction in our cases was that a prior restraint was something that you're prohibited from doing in advance of trying to do with."
1974.73-938,0,33898,kirk_m_mcalpin,,600.578,603.51,It's a misdemeanor action Your Honor under the Georgia law.
1974.73-938,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,603.51,604.983,Nobody is prosecuting it.
1974.73-938,0,33898,kirk_m_mcalpin,,604.983,613.918,"Well, on the other hand, there was a prosecution and he view in the Wisconsin case in South California maybe our case they rely upon --"
1974.73-938,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,613.918,616.642,But nobody is prosecuting you and under Georgia law.
1974.73-938,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,616.642,621.406,"Even if they were that wouldn't be a prior restraint, Mr. Justice Rehnquist is so correct."
1974.73-938,0,33898,kirk_m_mcalpin,,634.815,638.12,"Well, Your Honor we don't buttress on our trial argument on that point."
1974.73-938,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,709.75,723.619,Don't the code of ethics -- doesn't the code of ethics or canon to journalism already imposed restraints upon you directing now to your present argument that this has some chilling effect?
1974.73-938,0,33898,kirk_m_mcalpin,,727.701,730.402,The State of Georgia has mentioned that.
1974.73-938,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,730.402,731.661,"Well, was that correct or not?"
1974.73-938,0,33898,kirk_m_mcalpin,,733.915,742.017,"Well, I think that there is probably is a -- canons of ethics to effect Your Honor, but on the other hand if there is (Voice Overlap)"
1974.73-938,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,742.017,748.487,"Where there would be that much chilling effect, would they not?"
1974.73-938,0,33898,kirk_m_mcalpin,,748.487,775.069,"I don't think in this particular case Your Honor that there would be even any violation of those ethical principles because in this case the circumstances of the trial itself I do not believe what in any way come within the canons of ethics of the editors which we were refer to for this reason and maybe if you permit to do so, I should probably reach that point."
1974.73-938,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,967.937,970.13,"Mr. McAlpin, if I may for a moment."
1974.73-938,0,33898,kirk_m_mcalpin,,978.268,979.479,"Your Honor, I said --"
1974.73-938,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,979.479,982.22,Would you mind if you emphasize the fact there was a public trial.
1974.73-938,0,33898,kirk_m_mcalpin,,982.22,983.524,It was a public trial.
1974.73-938,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,986.171,990.738,Underlying on that or would it be the same if it were private?
1974.73-938,0,33898,kirk_m_mcalpin,,992.537,1005.223,"Well, the plaintiff makes reference to juvenile in cases where and we comment the court, we comment in our brief that those statutes -- I'm not certainly really that that would be a distinction Your Honor."
1974.73-938,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1052.038,1056.85,"It might also be that you might not have a name either of the victim, if they were close to you."
1974.73-938,0,33898,kirk_m_mcalpin,,1060.973,1064.95,"That's correct Your Honor and to answer that yes, sir --"
1974.73-938,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1064.95,1078.794,The Government's word -- say that the First Amendment right is an absolute one to publish this girl's name no matter where from what source who obtained it?
1974.73-938,0,33898,kirk_m_mcalpin,,1078.794,1078.947,Your Honor --
1974.73-938,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1078.947,1083.693,If it's true that she is the one who was the victim.
1974.73-938,0,33898,kirk_m_mcalpin,,1083.693,1092.066,Under your -- under decisions of this Court that has been held that there are limitations on exercise of First Amendment Rights.
1974.73-938,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1094.529,1097.065,"I know we don't, but I'm asking whether you want us to go beyond."
1974.73-938,0,33898,kirk_m_mcalpin,,1099.429,1105.731,We are not asking for that but I do think in treatment of the First Amendment question in privacy areas.
1974.73-938,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1111.843,1118.555,But you want us then to limit this to a First Amendment Right truthfully to a report to judicial proceeding?
1974.73-938,0,33898,kirk_m_mcalpin,,1118.555,1119.706,"No sir, I do not."
1974.73-938,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1119.706,1120.674,You want us to go beyond that?
1974.73-938,0,33898,kirk_m_mcalpin,,1120.674,1122.017,That's I say I think that these rules --
1974.73-938,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1122.017,1125.032,But how far beyond that you want us to go?
1974.73-938,0,33898,kirk_m_mcalpin,,1125.032,1132.223,"Well, Your Honor it maybe that truthful reporting of non-defamatory matter has absolute privilege."
1974.73-938,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1132.223,1133.473,"Well, do you want us to go that far?"
1974.73-938,0,33898,kirk_m_mcalpin,,1133.473,1134.365,"Well, yes sir."
1974.73-938,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1134.365,1139.547,I thought you wanted us to deal with the constitutional validity of this Georgia statute on its face?
1974.73-938,0,33898,kirk_m_mcalpin,,1139.547,1140.192,We do Your Honor and I would like --
1974.73-938,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1140.192,1142.387,"And that's all we could do, isn't it?"
1974.73-938,0,33898,kirk_m_mcalpin,,1142.387,1143.025,Alright sir.
1974.73-938,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1242.337,1245.988,"Well, I think in this area, this is probably the first case."
1974.73-938,0,33898,kirk_m_mcalpin,,1245.988,1246.554,It is.
1974.73-938,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1246.554,1250.904,"As I recall, since I've been here where we dealt with concededly truthful report."
1974.73-938,0,33898,kirk_m_mcalpin,,1250.904,1252.073,This is correct.
1974.73-938,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1252.073,1257.054,And the question of the extent to which at least there's a press is concerned.
1974.73-938,0,33898,kirk_m_mcalpin,,1257.054,1257.502,That's right.
1974.73-938,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1257.502,1260.405,Under the First Amendment protection to publish that no matter where it comes from?
1974.73-938,0,33898,kirk_m_mcalpin,,1260.405,1261.168,That's right.
1974.73-938,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1261.168,1262.217,That's not something we dealt with --
1974.73-938,0,33898,kirk_m_mcalpin,,1262.217,1282.989,That's right and we tried to label with the question of invasion of privacy in a truthful area as against the right of freedom of press recognizing that this should be given every possible by this Court even has been every possible right with no restraint or no impairment at all.
1974.73-938,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1408.592,1409.704,Excuse me may I interrupt you for a minute?
1974.73-938,0,33898,kirk_m_mcalpin,,1409.704,1410.274,"Yes, sir."
1974.73-938,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1410.274,1413.49,Who decides what is a matter of public interests?
1974.73-938,0,33898,kirk_m_mcalpin,,1413.49,1415.727,"Yes sir, that's the next things I was coming to Justice Powell."
1974.73-938,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1487.476,1488.768,May I follow up that question?
1974.73-938,0,33898,kirk_m_mcalpin,,1488.768,1489.716,Alright sir.
1974.73-938,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1489.716,1495.466,If it's the editor's decision then the judiciary would have no further function in this area?
1974.73-938,0,33898,kirk_m_mcalpin,,1495.466,1498.238,"Your Honor, it may be."
1974.73-938,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1758.178,1759.537,Thank you Mr. McAlpin.
1974.73-938,1,41690,stephen_a_land,,1764.907,1770.272,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1974.73-938,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2032.861,2039.364,And the defendant is stripped of any defense that this was a matter of public interest?
1974.73-938,1,41690,stephen_a_land,,2039.364,2042.573,"The defense, yet I would not agree with that Mr. Justice Brennan."
1974.73-938,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2065.021,2078.532,Do you mean if possibly the victim was the daughter of the Governor of the States that that might be one of the kinds of cases where protection would not extend?
1974.73-938,1,41690,stephen_a_land,,2078.532,2080.838,I would not like to say that Mr. Justice Burger.
1974.73-938,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2080.838,2087.706,"Well, would give us some kind of an idea of what might be one of the exceptions?"
1974.73-938,1,41690,stephen_a_land,,2087.706,2100.772,I would think that the point that you just raised if it was the Governor of Georgia or the President's daughter or whatever gets into the area of public and private figures which I do not believe has a relevance to these cases.
1974.73-938,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2124.674,2149.743,"Well, Mr. Land, would the petitioner or appellant be able to defend on the ground that the mere fact that they were reporting a court proceeding involving pleas to an indictment which named this young lady was itself evidence that this was a matter of public interest?"
1974.73-938,1,41690,stephen_a_land,,2149.743,2150.86,I think not Your Honor because --
1974.73-938,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2150.86,2152.251,He could not do that?
1974.73-938,1,41690,stephen_a_land,,2152.251,2159.216,I would think not because if you would say so and grant that argument then every case of any description brought by any party would be a merit --
1974.73-938,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2159.216,2164.356,"Well, I don't quite understand what's open to you in your submission."
1974.73-938,1,41690,stephen_a_land,,2164.356,2170.819,"What is open to them by way of -- Well, number one is negligence, were they negligent or were they not negligent?"
1974.73-938,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2211.967,2214.557,But there would be no defense rooted in the Constitution?
1974.73-938,1,41690,stephen_a_land,,2214.557,2216.172,Not in the constitutional sense itself.
1974.73-938,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2216.172,2220.937,"In that issue, do you think it's been plainly disposed of in the Georgia Court?"
1974.73-938,1,41690,stephen_a_land,,2220.937,2224.731,"I would have to say that to be candid with you Your Honor, yes."
1974.73-938,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2259.551,2262.613,Do we have jurisdiction here?
1974.73-938,1,41690,stephen_a_land,,2262.613,2263.885,In a sense.
1974.73-938,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2263.885,2266.238,"Well, do we or don't we?"
1974.73-938,1,41690,stephen_a_land,,2266.238,2266.796,I think not.
1974.73-938,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2266.796,2268.869,Is this final -- is this a final judgment?
1974.73-938,1,41690,stephen_a_land,,2268.869,2277.677,It is far from a final judgment in the sense that it's only on summary judgment that was interlocutory step just like under the federal rules of civil procedure.
1974.73-938,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2283.852,2288.501,"Constitutional -- you just said, the constitutional issue is fully decided and finally disposed off?"
1974.73-938,1,41690,stephen_a_land,,2288.501,2295.052,"In so far as in Georgia, as far as Georgia is concerned it has made the initial threshold decision that this -- in this case."
1974.73-938,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2295.052,2296.217,I know but it's final in this case?
1974.73-938,1,41690,stephen_a_land,,2296.217,2297.738,Yes.
1974.73-938,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2297.738,2301.151,The lower courts can't re-decide the Constitution.
1974.73-938,1,41690,stephen_a_land,,2301.151,2306.461,I see no way Fulton Superior Court could turn around and say that the identity of a rape victim is a matter of general public interest.
1974.73-938,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2306.461,2307.857,"Well, how about this Mr. Land?"
1974.73-938,1,41690,stephen_a_land,,2322.705,2324.296,That issue was before the Supreme Court.
1974.73-938,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2324.296,2327.857,"I know, is it before us?"
1974.73-938,1,41690,stephen_a_land,,2327.857,2331.87,As a general proposition or as a constitutional procedure or statutory?
1974.73-938,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2331.87,2334.866,As a constitutional matter.
1974.73-938,1,41690,stephen_a_land,,2359.285,2362.027,It is and isn't which is of course a weasel sort of answer.
1974.73-938,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2362.027,2363.74,"Well, why is it that?"
1974.73-938,1,41690,stephen_a_land,,2363.74,2373.662,Because initially the judicial -- the question of a judicial trial begs the question of the essentials of this case.
1974.73-938,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2375.843,2387.015,Isn't it conceivable to might be a distinction between the report of a judicial trial which disclosed the name of the victim and a report from some other source?
1974.73-938,1,41690,stephen_a_land,,2387.015,2393.511,"Between us for example, I can think of a police report or a report of by word of mouth or some other matter rather than a judicial trial."
1974.73-938,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2393.511,2396.073,Yes.
1974.73-938,1,41690,stephen_a_land,,2396.073,2397.887,"No, I don't think the distinction is valid."
1974.73-938,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2402.074,2415.089,"So that if there's any First Amendment Protection for this support at all, it would extend to a report as long as it's truthful without regard to the source."
1974.73-938,1,41690,stephen_a_land,,2415.089,2416.288,I'm not sure I follow the question.
1974.73-938,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2416.288,2419.625,Without regard to where Cox learned the name.
1974.73-938,1,41690,stephen_a_land,,2430.752,2431.925,I would agree with that yes.
1974.73-938,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2431.925,2444.234,I thought you said a moment just the opposite that area depending on the circumstances of the source of the report whether word of mouth or police report the reconstitution result might be different?
1974.73-938,1,41690,stephen_a_land,,2444.234,2452.798,"No, I think I said that the result might be different before a jury in the trial court in invasion of privacy tort suit."
1974.73-938,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2488.617,2496.859,"Well, historically though the press has enjoyed a qualified privilege as respect to judicial proceedings and it hasn't which in other contexts."
1974.73-938,1,41690,stephen_a_land,,2496.859,2497.0,I'm not --
1974.73-938,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2497.0,2499.273,It's just as a matter of state libel law.
1974.73-938,1,41690,stephen_a_land,,2499.273,2501.687,"Well, the State of Georgia has acted on that regard."
1974.73-938,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2510.941,2516.352,"No, but it is -- it has been characteristics of libel law to distinguish between the reports of the judicial proceedings --"
1974.73-938,1,41690,stephen_a_land,,2516.352,2517.352,Well --
1974.73-938,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2517.352,2518.878,-- and other kinds of report?
1974.73-938,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2520.203,2526.838,"Mr. Land, I assume that in Georgia, there's no question of right of privacy action survived in death?"
1974.73-938,1,41690,stephen_a_land,,2526.838,2539.302,"No sir, that issue did not come up precisely that way in this case and the counsel for appellants who are quite able raised that the question was, was there a so-called relational right of privacy?"
1974.73-938,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2539.302,2541.463,But that would really be state law question in there.
1974.73-938,1,41690,stephen_a_land,,2541.463,2545.514,Yes sir and it was determined that the father did have a cause of action of his own.
1974.73-938,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2627.487,2633.429,But this statute would apply even if the victim and the family had no objection.
1974.73-938,1,41690,stephen_a_land,,2633.429,2635.715,"I would not concur with that Justice Marshall, I think --"
1974.73-938,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2635.715,2639.022,But what in the statute do you point to amend?
1974.73-938,1,41690,stephen_a_land,,2639.022,2643.269,"Well, the statute has drawn is a criminal misdemeanor statute and we --"
1974.73-938,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2643.269,2644.382,And it says?
1974.73-938,1,41690,stephen_a_land,,2644.382,2647.422,We are not dealing with a criminal case.
1974.73-938,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2665.661,2669.177,But the statute is broad enough to cover.
1974.73-938,1,41690,stephen_a_land,,2669.177,2671.279,"Well, if the prosecution were initiated I will --"
1974.73-938,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2671.279,2674.286,"Well, the statute does not make any exception, does it?"
1974.73-938,1,41690,stephen_a_land,,2674.286,2675.143,It does not.
1974.73-938,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2675.143,2676.714,Well that's the question.
1974.73-938,1,41690,stephen_a_land,,2676.714,2685.148,The only exceptions will come in the trial of the case itself to see whether there is in fact a civil cause of action and comes up to the test.
1974.73-938,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2685.148,2691.304,Would your argument be any different Mr. Land if the victim were a common prostitute?
1974.73-938,1,41690,stephen_a_land,,2691.304,2693.519,"No, sir."
1974.73-938,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2693.519,2710.054,I suppose one of the reasons the other side would advance here is that the absence of such statute tends to bring out witnesses as to character of the prosecuting witness.
1974.73-938,1,41690,stephen_a_land,,2710.054,2714.554,I don't accept that although I think that's a valid judgment that's being made by each side.
1974.73-938,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2734.888,2739.839,Do you find any parallel in the comparative secrecy of juvenile proceedings?
1974.73-938,1,41690,stephen_a_land,,2739.839,2745.547,I do and it is not quite so the juvenile proceedings are not closed to the press to my knowledge.
1974.73-938,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2747.31,2748.93,They are in some States.
1974.73-938,1,41690,stephen_a_land,,2748.93,2749.926,They are not in Georgia.
1974.73-938,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2770.05,2777.363,"But the Juvenile Court in Fulton County I take it is closed to the just spectators of the general public, isn't it?"
1974.73-938,1,41690,stephen_a_land,,2777.363,2785.938,"My personal exp -- I'm going to have to speak from personal experiences I've never known of any restriction telling people to stay out, I don't know."
1974.73-938,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2805.422,2821.024,Do you believe that if you do not prevail here that the Georgia restraints on publication of the names of the juvenile offenders will also go by the board?
1974.73-938,1,41690,stephen_a_land,,2821.024,2821.92,"Not in this case, no."
1974.73-938,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2821.92,2824.78,"Not in this case, I'm talking about the general consequences."
1974.73-938,1,41690,stephen_a_land,,2824.78,2825.755,I think so yes.
1974.73-938,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2845.93,2860.617,But isn't it narrower than that if this Court should hold that the victim's name cannot be protected then it is not likely you're suggesting that it would hold that the offender's name would be entitled to protection?
1974.73-938,1,41690,stephen_a_land,,2860.617,2861.765,"No, sir."
1974.73-938,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2923.9,2930.679,I gather Mr. Land you wouldn't be arguing the same position if Ms. Cohn has been murdered only and not been raped?
1974.73-938,1,41690,stephen_a_land,,2930.679,2932.308,No sir.
1974.73-938,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2937.877,2942.094,"I take it, this would be true of victims of other crimes, robberies, armed robberies,--"
1974.73-938,1,41690,stephen_a_land,,2942.094,2946.043,The same social implications do not apply to those crimes.
1974.73-938,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2946.043,2956.311,"Do you know of any case that oppose against First Amendment challenge, the secrecy of the juvenile statute -- juvenile proceedings?"
1974.73-938,1,41690,stephen_a_land,,2956.311,2959.337,I am not familiar with one.
1974.73-938,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3036.427,3037.404,That was the Titicut Follies?
1974.73-938,1,41690,stephen_a_land,,3037.404,3050.829,The Titicut Follies episode and the court specifically stated in that case that there is obviously the State of Mental Institutions in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts is of the greatest public concern.
1974.73-938,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3057.727,3061.274,But then that case arise in the basis of the law of contracts?
1974.73-938,1,41690,stephen_a_land,,3063.383,3067.632,I know what you're speaking of that he violated his word.
1974.73-938,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3070.098,3072.004,That was a contracts law case.
1974.73-938,1,41690,stephen_a_land,,3072.004,3075.854,"I still don't believe that that was the thrust of their decision though, Your Honor."
1974.73-938,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3157.451,3161.989,"Very well, do you have any further Mr. McAlpin?"
