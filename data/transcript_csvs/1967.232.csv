1967.232,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,30.273,"Number 232 and 233, United States, Petitioner, versus David Paul O'Brien; and David Paul O'Brien, Petitioner, versus United States."
1967.232,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,44.461,48.692,May it please the Court.
1967.232,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,444.864,446.25,How old is the defendant?
1967.232,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,446.25,450.414,He was 19 at the time of the offense.
1967.232,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,450.414,455.111,And a person can be sentenced under that Act up to what age Mr. Solicitor General?
1967.232,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,455.111,455.783,21.
1967.232,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,455.783,456.902,21?
1967.232,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,456.902,457.99,That is when the offense is committed.
1967.232,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,457.99,458.774,When the offense --
1967.232,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,458.774,461.835,21.
1967.232,1,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,2871.75,2879.011,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1967.232,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2961.053,2966.493,"What do you mean by a “verbal conduct” That's not what we're talking about here, is it?"
1967.232,1,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,2966.493,2967.841,"Mr. Justice Fortas, I --"
1967.232,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2967.841,2977.851,"I mean to say, we're talking about the burning of the draft card and now you can say that that is symbolic First Amendment expression if you want to --"
1967.232,1,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,2977.851,2978.156,I --
1967.232,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2978.156,2980.407,-- we're not talking about verbal.
1967.232,1,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,2983.418,2984.622,"No, Mr. Justice Fortas."
1967.232,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3007.583,3023.783,"Suppose this charge was that he had willfully placed the -- this Certificate in his dresser -- drawer all the reason, that you now say that he burned up this way."
1967.232,1,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,3040.803,3044.593,"Mr. Justice Brennan, I believe that some of the same questions would be involved."
1967.232,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3044.593,3045.871,With the First Amendment question?
1967.232,1,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,3045.871,3049.284,Some of the First Amendment questions would be involved but not others.
1967.232,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3072.754,3078.515,But you would nevertheless be otherwise urging your First Amendment argument?
1967.232,1,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,3078.515,3089.448,"Yes, Your Honor, we would be urging the -- that we would be urging the First Amendment arguments if the symbolic act had the same manifestation and the same purpose."
1967.232,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3089.448,3093.56,"Well, “manifestation” you mean same public manifestation?"
1967.232,1,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,3102.764,3109.68,"Yes, Your Honor, we are because we believe that this brings it close to the line of symbolic speech cases which have been decided (Voice Overlap) this Court."
1967.232,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3109.68,3112.825,"Well, on the -- in the hypothetical I've put to you --"
1967.232,1,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,3112.825,3121.053,"I believe that factor would be much less, Your Honor, and it would be much more difficult to make an argument of symbolic speech under those circumstances."
1967.232,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3121.053,3125.185,"So that symbolic speech requires some public manifestation, does it?"
1967.232,1,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,3125.185,3128.321,"Well, it requires an act of communication I believe."
1967.232,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3145.485,3150.52,"Well, in my hypothetical, you look -- be hard for -- to it to find any transmission and reception, wouldn't you?"
1967.232,1,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,3150.52,3152.841,"I think it probably would, Mr. Justice Brennan."
1967.232,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3152.841,3156.043,So that probably you wouldn't be making the First --
1967.232,1,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,3156.043,3162.62,"I -- that's why I started in response to this colloquy Your Honor, that I would hope that we would not have to argue this question here."
1967.232,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3169.546,3170.104,Suppose a soldier --
1967.232,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3170.104,3171.114,(Inaudible) excuse me.
1967.232,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3171.114,3192.266,"Suppose a solider over in Vietnam in front of a large crowd, soldiers broke his weapon and said it was a protest against the war in the foreign policy of the government, would that be symbolic speech?"
1967.232,1,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,3192.266,3196.974,"Mr. Chief Justice, I don't know whether that would or wouldn't be symbolic speech but we --"
1967.232,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3196.974,3197.673,But we have --
1967.232,1,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,3197.673,3197.769,But we --
1967.232,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3197.769,3202.941,"We have to go a little farther than just this particular case, do we not?"
1967.232,1,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,3202.941,3205.504,We certainly do not argue.
1967.232,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3225.579,3228.191,Where do you draw the line?
1967.232,1,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,3228.191,3234.981,"We would like to suggest, Mr. Chief Justice, that the lines should be drawn in accordance with the proper application of the clear and present danger test."
1967.232,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3250.656,3260.079,"Well, there was a lady, Virginia Killims (ph) I think it was who protested the constitutionality of the tax laws."
1967.232,1,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,3285.135,3287.383,"I don't know if I would defend it, Mr. Justice Fortas on the basis that you used --"
1967.232,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3287.383,3289.167,I don't mean you personally.
1967.232,1,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,3289.167,3304.797,-- but I would think that it would be much easier to show a valid governmental purpose for the requirement that income tax records be preserved for a certain period of time.
1967.232,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3313.321,3322.633,That's your problem because now you're right back to a defense to an attack upon the requirement of possession --
1967.232,1,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,3322.633,3322.779,Well --
1967.232,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3322.779,3325.129,-- of a draft card.
1967.232,1,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,3348.26,3355.388,"Well, I would think that these are items which can properly be weighed in the judicial constitutional balance."
1967.232,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3355.399,3363.658,That's what we're trying to do and I want to know where you -- how you -- if how in your minds hide the scale tips?
1967.232,1,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,3363.658,3387.577,"Well, let me address myself at this point then, Mr. Justice Fortas to the various suggestions which have been made on the part of the Government in this Court and in other courts and by the learned Solicitor General that this is a proper indication of the power to raise armies because it serves some role in the Selective Service -- in the administration of Selective Service."
1967.232,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3514.207,3521.529,"I thought the -- I thought it was an enforcement, provides, to help identify people who have registered."
1967.232,1,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,3521.529,3524.282,But enforcement of what Mr. Justice Fortas?
1967.232,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3524.282,3527.433,"Collective Service registration, no?"
1967.232,1,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,3527.433,3533.813,"It seems there, does not seem to be -- it does not seem to play any role in the enforcement of the Selective Service laws."
1967.232,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3571.232,3572.781,"Does serve a purpose, doesn't it?"
1967.232,1,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,3581.146,3583.289,"Of course, it does, Mr. Justice Stewart."
1967.232,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3586.142,3587.149,"Well, that's true and --"
1967.232,1,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,3587.149,3587.364,Yes.
1967.232,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3587.364,3595.08,"-- but its not a -- there is some reason that there is such a thing as a registration certificate, is there not?"
1967.232,1,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,3595.08,3597.053,The reason is to --
1967.232,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3597.053,3598.279,"Notify the registrant, isn't there?"
1967.232,1,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,3598.279,3600.458,"There are two certificates, Mr. Justice Stewart."
1967.232,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3600.458,3600.879,Yes.
1967.232,1,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,3600.879,3605.171,There's a Registration Certificate and a Notice of Classification.
1967.232,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3650.62,3660.291,"You mean a boy burnt -- burned up his card, when it serves that function?"
1967.232,1,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,3660.291,3664.616,"Perhaps, some are interested in other types of sustenance, Mr. Justice Fortas."
1967.232,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3664.616,3672.389,"Well, if it serves only a notification purpose, a lot of other information on it, I'm sure."
1967.232,1,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,3677.994,3678.339,"Yes, Your Honor."
1967.232,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3678.339,3680.048,The place of his birth?
1967.232,1,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,3682.849,3683.555,I --
1967.232,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3683.555,3701.517,"It tells the name and address of some person who will always know my address, the color of my eyes, the color of my hair, my height, my weight, do I have to be told those things if this serves only a notification purpose to me in my classification?"
1967.232,1,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,3701.517,3707.623,"I can't see, Mr. Justice Brennan, how that's serves a governmental purpose."
1967.232,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3707.623,3710.57,"Well, perhaps, it serves some other governmental purpose."
1967.232,1,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,3731.985,3745.307,"Well, if it tells you -- if a piece of paper tells you of the date of your birth, I can't see what other purpose it serves other than to allow you to present some proof as to your date of birth."
1967.232,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3745.307,3782.655,"Why not give the Government some information needed in administering the Selective Service Act to have a young man carry a card that would show that he actually did register in a particular place as this certificate shows, Farmington, Town of Farmington, State of Massachusetts and that the date of his registration was 11 -- 12-11-1964 together with the Certificate of the Board on it to the effect that he did actually register."
1967.232,1,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,3807.505,3810.324,"Mr. Chief Justice, the Government has this knowledge."
1967.232,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3818.06,3823.847,"Suppose this young man is found out in, let's say, Arizona."
1967.232,1,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,3854.625,3870.349,"Mr. Chief Justice, if there is any dereliction or delinquency or violation of the Selective Service Statute, the position or retention or non-possession or non-retention of this card will have no effect on the Government's ability to prosecute."
1967.232,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3870.349,3875.369,"Yes, but obviously, it must serve a purpose of identification, was it not?"
1967.232,1,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,3875.369,3876.661,"But that, Mr. Justice Brennan, I must --"
1967.232,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3876.661,3879.633,But not only in registration but of identification.
1967.232,1,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,3906.08,3915.396,I would suppose that one could question whether or not any problem of self-incrimination might be raised by someone being --
1967.232,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3915.396,3921.163,"Typically, you have a difficult enough constitutional question (Voice Overlap) --"
1967.232,1,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,3921.163,3922.15,"I know that, Mr. Justice Brennan."
1967.232,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3922.15,3929.293,"(Voice Overlap) could not have another because that reason, they extended there heavily on the right to privacy."
1967.232,1,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,3940.034,3941.419,"We are not making any such argument, Mr. Justice Black."
1967.232,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3941.419,3945.115,-- without breaking the law?
1967.232,1,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,3945.115,3957.918,"An argument which -- but, I do wish to repeat that David O'Brien was neither indicted, nor tried nor convicted for non-possession."
1967.232,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4059.508,4077.611,But somebody might think of it as insulting and unpatriotic to break a window in the Whitehouse but I suppose you could also -- the person who did it could also be punished criminally regardless of the fact that he might do it to -- as an expression of opinion --
1967.232,1,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,4077.611,4078.17,That's quite something Mr. Justice Fortas --
1967.232,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4078.17,4080.992,"-- than to be all of those things, couldn't it?"
1967.232,1,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,4080.992,4084.07,"That's quite so, Mr. Justice Fortas, but --"
1967.232,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4084.07,4090.26,I think you answered a while ago but I'd like to ask you again.
1967.232,1,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,4105.788,4117.149,"The argument directed at the unconstitutional purpose and the manifestation of unconstitutional purpose on the part of the Congress would be the same, Mr. Chief Justice."
1967.232,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4118.509,4119.229,But you would?
1967.232,1,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,4119.229,4120.401,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice."
1967.232,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4120.401,4140.886,"Now, tell me what cases you have that would equate a private burning of a draft card contrary to the statute to be symbolic speech?"
1967.232,1,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,4140.886,4144.75,"Perhaps, I did not understand your question, Mr. Chief Justice."
1967.232,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4190.488,4202.038,Has -- have you got any case in which this Court has ever invalidated the statutes solely because of an improper motive on the part of Congress?
1967.232,1,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,4202.038,4210.421,"I -- may I first, with respect, Mr. Justice Fortas comment on your terminology."
1967.232,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4213.168,4217.3,I thought I was commenting on yours beforehand.
1967.232,1,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,4217.3,4219.832,"Let me correct my own then, Your Honor."
1967.232,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4241.67,4245.319,He said not -- we haven't yet explicitly done that.
1967.232,1,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,4247.879,4248.115,I do believe --
1967.232,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4248.115,4251.497,So your answer to my question is that you have no authority --
1967.232,1,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,4251.497,4251.994,Well --
1967.232,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4251.994,4264.544,-- to support your argument that this Court may look at the motive of Congress and solely at the motive of Congress and on that basis invalidate the statute as unconstitutional.
1967.232,1,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,4264.544,4268.206,"I think I do have authority which points strongly in that direction, Mr. Justice Fortas."
