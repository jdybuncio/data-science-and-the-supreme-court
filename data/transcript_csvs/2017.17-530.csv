2017.17-530,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.055,7.865,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 17-530, Wisconsin Central versus the United States. Mr. Dupree."
2017.17-530,0,42633,thomas_h_dupree_jr,,7.865,17.765,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Railroad Retirement Tax Act levies a payroll tax on railroad employees' money remuneration."
2017.17-530,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,36.61,37.94,How about -- how about a check?
2017.17-530,0,42633,thomas_h_dupree_jr,,37.94,42.33,"We think a check would constitute a medium of exchange, Justice Kennedy."
2017.17-530,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,51.93,55.215,So you end the slippery slope about that -- at that point?
2017.17-530,0,42633,thomas_h_dupree_jr,,55.215,55.72,Well --
2017.17-530,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,55.72,57.41,"What about a bond, a U.S. savings bond?"
2017.17-530,0,42633,thomas_h_dupree_jr,,57.41,58.865,"That would not be, Your Honor."
2017.17-530,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,90.69,108.95,"Mr. Dupree, wasn't it -- wasn't it so that when the Act was enacted, compensation was in money, but over time, compensation in the form of stock has become more frequent."
2017.17-530,0,42633,thomas_h_dupree_jr,,124.305,137.165,"Well, Justice Ginsburg, what the historical record shows is that at the time of the Great Depression, when the statute was enacted, railroad employees were actually compensated through a variety of means, both cash-based and also non-cash-based."
2017.17-530,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,161.71,163.425,How common was stock at that time?
2017.17-530,0,42633,thomas_h_dupree_jr,,163.425,164.37,How common was it?
2017.17-530,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,164.37,164.57,Yes.
2017.17-530,0,42633,thomas_h_dupree_jr,,164.57,166.21,It -- it was sufficiently common.
2017.17-530,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,211.76,224.07,"Mr. Dupree, in the way you talked about it, it's not just that we have to give meaning to the term ""money."" I think you're quite right to say that the term we have to look at is ""money remuneration."" Is that correct?"
2017.17-530,0,42633,thomas_h_dupree_jr,,224.07,225.82,"That's the key term, yes, Your Honor."
2017.17-530,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,225.82,232.49,"And so that's really money in a -- in a compensation scheme, right? I mean, that's what that means."
2017.17-530,0,42633,thomas_h_dupree_jr,,232.89,234.46,Money remuneration. That's right.
2017.17-530,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,234.46,239.56,"So let's even take your own definition, which I think that there's a lot to be said for."
2017.17-530,0,42633,thomas_h_dupree_jr,,280.85,283.93,"Well, I'm not sure it -- it quite works out that way, Justice Kagan."
2017.17-530,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,297.54,314.595,"Well, I think partly it's because, you know, some companies might give free lunches and other companies might not give free lunches, and -- and you -- I mean, this is -- this is a kind -- instead of getting a check, you're getting stock."
2017.17-530,0,42633,thomas_h_dupree_jr,,315.71,319.73,"Well, you're getting a stock option, which then needs to percolate for many years --"
2017.17-530,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,319.73,320.12,Well -- right.
2017.17-530,0,42633,thomas_h_dupree_jr,,320.12,321.93,-- before it turns into a butterfly and becomes stock.
2017.17-530,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,321.93,322.32,But you can --
2017.17-530,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,322.32,322.85,Yes.
2017.17-530,0,42633,thomas_h_dupree_jr,,322.85,323.255,"But, yes."
2017.17-530,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,323.255,324.83,-- you can take it in stock.
2017.17-530,0,42633,thomas_h_dupree_jr,,344.95,353.2,"Well, I -- I think a generally accepted medium of exchange refers to something that, number one, has a fixed value. In other words, it's a measure of value."
2017.17-530,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,365.52,380.79,"But that's why -- I mean, in your briefs, you keep on saying you can't take a stock option to a grocery store. But I think -- and that's obviously right. But I think what I'm saying is that would be a relevant question if all we were asking is what's the definition of money."
2017.17-530,0,42633,thomas_h_dupree_jr,,402.25,403.32,"Well, I -- I don't think so."
2017.17-530,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,437.185,440.83,"Well, let me ask another question, Mr. Dupree, just to test this a little bit."
2017.17-530,0,42633,thomas_h_dupree_jr,,462.45,470.98,"Well, the -- in Your Honor's -- context of Your Honor's question, I think money is essentially synonymous with overall wealth or assets."
2017.17-530,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,472.62,472.76,Right.
2017.17-530,0,42633,thomas_h_dupree_jr,,478.465,482.365,"But in -- in the context of that question, I think that's fair."
2017.17-530,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,498.17,500.085,Why do we have to go that far?
2017.17-530,0,42633,thomas_h_dupree_jr,,500.085,501.04,I --
2017.17-530,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,501.04,510.115,"Why go that far? Why don't we just take what the Seventh Circuit said, which is this form of compensation is money?"
2017.17-530,0,42633,thomas_h_dupree_jr,,510.115,510.71,Well --
2017.17-530,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,510.71,513.645,"I agree with you, a bottle of wine at Christmas is not."
2017.17-530,0,42633,thomas_h_dupree_jr,,528.45,547.55,"Well, I think, to answer Your Honor's question about the Seventh Circuit's analysis, the Seventh Circuit and Judge Posner actually agreed with our definition of money as a commonly accepted medium of exchange. Where he went awry in our view is concluding that in the year 2018 stock has become a medium of exchange."
2017.17-530,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,553.21,570.25,"I thought Judge Posner's main point was that there's no economic difference to the recipient, whether he gets $1,000 in cash in hand or a share of stock that he can easily convert to $1,000."
2017.17-530,0,42633,thomas_h_dupree_jr,,570.25,570.98,Right.
2017.17-530,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,603.42,615.765,"But if you're right, then Congress did a -- an idle thing when it specifically excluded from compensation, subject to the tax, a qualified stock option."
2017.17-530,0,42633,thomas_h_dupree_jr,,621.38,656.215,"Well, a few points on that, Justice Ginsburg. The first is that the government argues that that exemption is relevant to this case because, in the government's view, it essentially renders our definition -- or it would render the provision surplusage under our definition of money remuneration. We think that's wrong, and the reason why that's wrong is because, when an employee exercises a qualified stock option, they always get stock, but -- and this is the critical point and one the government concedes -- they often get cash as well. That is why that (e)(12) exemption is not surplusage under our reading."
2017.17-530,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,682.7,695.315,"Mr. Dupree, if we're going to look back, as you're encouraging us to do, further than 2004, why not look at 1938 and the regulations that were promulgated then that suggest that money remuneration is broader than you're arguing?"
2017.17-530,0,42633,thomas_h_dupree_jr,,695.315,700.67,"Well, Justice Gorsuch, I think actually that that original regulation strongly supports our point."
2017.17-530,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,736.395,740.325,"Well, what if we read it more broadly? Would you have any further response?"
2017.17-530,0,42633,thomas_h_dupree_jr,,740.325,746.24,"Well, if -- if you read it more broadly, I don't think you could read it more broadly to encompass stock."
2017.17-530,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,746.24,748.965,"I'm sure you don't, but let's just suppose we did."
2017.17-530,0,42633,thomas_h_dupree_jr,,749.585,755.24,"Well, then I would say that that regulation was impermissible, conflicts with the statute."
2017.17-530,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,755.24,761.16,So what do we do with history? I -- I wasn't talking about the tax regulation.
2017.17-530,0,42633,thomas_h_dupree_jr,,809.9,810.43,Right.
2017.17-530,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,880.94,903.31,"Was the government wrong in saying that at least for the last -- for 20 years, railroads have been paying tax, treating the stock option as equivalent to cash? There must have been, if they were paying for 20 years, there must have been something that triggered this inspiration to say there's no --"
2017.17-530,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,903.31,909.38,"And if I could add to that question, the employees thought it was taxable as well."
2017.17-530,0,42633,thomas_h_dupree_jr,,909.38,911.1,"Well, I -- I think what happened --"
2017.17-530,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,911.1,921.63,"And -- and -- and so what effect do we give to this long-time practice; even your -- your people in the position of your own clients, until recently, thought that it was taxable."
2017.17-530,0,42633,thomas_h_dupree_jr,,921.63,959.54,"Well, again, I think the history going back to the Great Depression up and through the mid-'90s is, as a general matter, the railroads were not paying tax on this. As far as what changed, in 1994, the IRS came out with a new regulation, it's the one that's currently on the books, which is a peculiar regulation, in all honesty, because it basically says we're going to treat FICA wages and RRTA compensation to mean the same thing, except where they differ. But the IRS never, to this day, it never has issued a regulation saying that stock options and stock is taxable under the Railroad Retirement Tax Act."
2017.17-530,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1054.87,1055.085,Mr. --
2017.17-530,0,42633,thomas_h_dupree_jr,,1055.085,1056.41,Congress has not changed --
2017.17-530,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1056.41,1073.36,"Mr. Dupree, just asking a question, not about the text but about reasons and purposes: What would be your best reason for why there should be a distinction between FICA and the railroad system with respect to stock options?"
2017.17-530,0,42633,thomas_h_dupree_jr,,1073.36,1074.68,"Absolutely, Justice Kagan."
2017.17-530,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1102.79,1128.6,"Well, I understand the government to be saying that that did exclude certain kinds of things that were clearly not cash-based, but -- you know, lunches or something like that, but that's a different question from the one I'm asking. I'm just saying look at this thing, stock options, and say why -- why would Congress want it to be taxable in FICA but not taxable in the railroad system?"
2017.17-530,0,42633,thomas_h_dupree_jr,,1128.6,1136.73,Because the railroad system -- retirement system is fundamentally different in key respects from Social Security. It has much higher tax rates.
2017.17-530,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1154.34,1162.6,I guess I'm still waiting for a difference that would -- would -- would match why Congress would make this different treatment of stock options.
2017.17-530,0,42633,thomas_h_dupree_jr,,1162.6,1198.585,"Well, I -- I think the different treatment of stock options traces back to the original decision that Congress made and that it has maintained now in the statutory text for 70-plus years, the distinction between a broad wage-based tax system in FICA that encompasses pretty much everything the employee gets and the far narrower tax base that the railroad system utilizes. So I think it's just a natural function that when Congress designed the tax basis for these two retirement systems, among many other differences between the two regimes, it formulated the tax base in a much narrower manner."
2017.17-530,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1205.76,1212.43,I thought -- I thought that the railroad pension system in the 1930s was at risk.
2017.17-530,0,42633,thomas_h_dupree_jr,,1244.06,1244.88,Right.
2017.17-530,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1267.05,1278.775,"So what's going to happen now? Every railroad is going to not pay -- if we buy your argument, not pay taxes, payroll taxes, on stock options."
2017.17-530,0,42633,thomas_h_dupree_jr,,1285.465,1287.035,"Well, I -- I -- I don't--"
2017.17-530,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1287.035,1291.38,And wouldn't that put the system into economic difficulty?
2017.17-530,0,42633,thomas_h_dupree_jr,,1291.38,1293.39,"It would not, Your Honor. And a number of points."
2017.17-530,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1309.01,1315.15,"The pensioners get less, is what you're saying to me? This self-adjusting system means that pensioners will get less."
2017.17-530,0,42633,thomas_h_dupree_jr,,1315.15,1315.97,"Well, no, no, not necessarily."
2017.17-530,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1318.8,1319.92,Someone pays no matter --
2017.17-530,0,42633,thomas_h_dupree_jr,,1319.92,1320.57,Someone pays.
2017.17-530,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1324.2,1332.76,"So who pays is the Joe Blow who gets minimum wage or something close to it, and the people who receive a lot more in stock options pay less?"
2017.17-530,0,42633,thomas_h_dupree_jr,,1332.76,1335.0,"I -- I -- well, no, I don't -- I don't think that's right."
2017.17-530,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1367.18,1368.18,I don't understand that.
2017.17-530,0,42633,thomas_h_dupree_jr,,1374.255,1393.265,"Oh, and -- and my point is that it may not be the -- less money going into the system, as Your Honor is positing, and that's because, if you have an executive who is receiving a large salary and stock options, they already exceed the compensation cap by virtue of their salary alone."
2017.17-530,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1427.85,1437.56,"Can -- can you tell me, just as an empirical matter, in -- in this case, are these stocks always listed so that there's a list price that everyone knows?"
2017.17-530,0,42633,thomas_h_dupree_jr,,1437.56,1437.86,Yes.
2017.17-530,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1440.325,1446.11,"Could there be instances where there might be small satellite corporations that are not listed, so the --"
2017.17-530,0,42633,thomas_h_dupree_jr,,1446.11,1446.25,I --
2017.17-530,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1446.25,1449.33,Because -- because you always know the value if it's publicly traded.
2017.17-530,0,42633,thomas_h_dupree_jr,,1449.33,1451.6,"That's -- that's right, Justice Kennedy."
2017.17-530,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1477.42,1491.26,"Is it ever backdated? If I get a bonus or the employee gets a bonus for today, April 16, is it ever backdated so that you can buy it as -- as of the -- April 16, 2017?"
2017.17-530,0,42633,thomas_h_dupree_jr,,1491.26,1492.86,"I -- I'm not aware of that, Your Honor."
2017.17-530,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1510.76,1515.725,But is the strike price always equivalent to the price on the day that the option is issued?
2017.17-530,0,42633,thomas_h_dupree_jr,,1515.725,1517.44,"Yes, yes."
2017.17-530,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1550.705,1555.99,"Thank you, counsel. Ms. Kovner."
2017.17-530,1,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,1555.99,1567.62,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Three parts of this statute demonstrate that the phrase ""any form of money remuneration"" refers to those payments that can be readily valued in or converted to cash."
2017.17-530,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1615.84,1627.31,How does it -- how does it work? When does the -- the railroad worker get the remuneration? When he gets the stock option or only when he cashes it?
2017.17-530,1,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,1627.31,1629.62,It's only -- only when he exercises it.
2017.17-530,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1698.775,1723.24,"Ms. -- Ms. Kovner, in what circumstances do you think we are allowed to look at what is clearly the natural import of that exemption? In other words, that exemption came about later, so do we have to find that ""money remuneration"" is an ambiguous phrase in order to look at it, or do we take the statute as a whole just generally?"
2017.17-530,1,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,1723.24,1744.26,"I think, you know, what this Court has said about this in West Virginia University Hospitals versus Casey is that the Court adopts the permissible meaning that fits most logically and comfortably with both the previously enacted and the subsequently enacted provisions. So here we think the only meaning that fits with both -- I mean, Mr. Dupree acknowledged when he stood up that money can have this broader reading that readily encompasses stock."
2017.17-530,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1764.55,1779.08,"May -- may I ask: Was Mr. Dupree right about the history, that it wasn't -- from 1938 to 1994, railroads were not paying on -- cash on options?"
2017.17-530,1,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,1779.08,1779.45,I don't --
2017.17-530,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1779.45,1781.58,Or not paying payroll taxes on cash -- cash options?
2017.17-530,1,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,1781.58,1787.295,I haven't seen any authority on one side or the other regarding very early in the statute's history.
2017.17-530,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1815.4,1834.205,"How -- what do I do with the fact that where I'm having difficulty making the leap in your argument is Congress did use ""money remuneration"" in one statute and ""wages"" defined very broadly in another."
2017.17-530,1,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,1844.05,1844.605,Sure.
2017.17-530,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1844.605,1846.47,So what do I do with that?
2017.17-530,1,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,1846.47,1846.53,So --
2017.17-530,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1846.53,1856.52,"You're now equating money remuneration with wages as it appears in FICA, but there -- why weren't identical words used?"
2017.17-530,1,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,1856.52,1856.7,Sure.
2017.17-530,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1895.91,1905.295,"You -- you would agree, wouldn't you, that not every form of stock qualifies under your definition? Justice Kennedy mentioned non-publicly traded stock."
2017.17-530,1,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,1921.385,1921.69,Sure.
2017.17-530,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1931.69,1934.6,"When you say covered too, you mean that counts as money remuneration?"
2017.17-530,1,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,1934.6,1938.63,It's -- that's right. And it counts as money remuneration only at the time that you exercise the option.
2017.17-530,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1962.76,1978.015,"Why would you wait until the day of exercise, though, if it -- why not the date of vesting, and -- and what -- I'm still not clear on what you do with privately-held stock that is not readily -- there's no liquid market value that you can look to at any point in time."
2017.17-530,1,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,1978.015,1978.28,Sure.
2017.17-530,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1992.795,1994.7,"Almost anything can be valued, though."
2017.17-530,1,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,2002.52,2006.11,"No, we think it's a matter of whether it has a readily ascertainable market value."
2017.17-530,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2033.51,2036.6,"No, no, once it vests, it's different."
2017.17-530,1,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,2052.185,2054.525,As -- as to a publicly-traded stock?
2017.17-530,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2054.525,2055.295,Sure.
2017.17-530,1,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,2055.295,2078.98,"I think our -- our view, you know, so there's a sort of pretty established body of IRS law about this, and it looks to, first, the point of issuance and, second, the point of -- the point at which you exercise the option. I think the IRS has sort of made the determination, applying this Court's decision in Commissioner versus LoBue, that those are the two points that you look to. And the IRS has generally said at the point that the option is issued --"
2017.17-530,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2078.98,2080.04,So more regulations. Okay.
2017.17-530,1,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,2108.52,2134.33,"So I think there are -- our definition of money remuneration basically has two pieces: First, can it be readily valued into cash and, second, can it be readily converted into cash? We think that either suffices, but at a minimum, we think the second, which is what you have here and not in those other cases, suffices. So, if it's something that you can easily convert into cash, here just by sort of checking a box on the form when you exercise the option, we think at a minimum those kinds of things qualify as money remuneration, which is sort of what the Court of Appeals said."
2017.17-530,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2134.33,2135.22,A home computer?
2017.17-530,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2135.22,2140.8,What about bushels -- bushels of wheat? It's readily convertible into cash on the Chicago Commodities Exchange.
2017.17-530,1,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,2145.33,2148.45,"Well, I don't think that's readily convertible to cash for the person who receives it."
2017.17-530,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2161.26,2162.74,"I mean, I suppose your answer would --"
2017.17-530,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2162.74,2168.96,"Well, okay, they give you a little -- they say, okay, here, you're entitled to buy 20 bushels of wheat on the commodity exchange."
2017.17-530,1,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,2170.72,2174.21,"Well, a voucher for bushels of wheat? I'm not --"
2017.17-530,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2174.21,2174.345,Sure.
2017.17-530,1,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,2174.345,2174.55,Right.
2017.17-530,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2222.51,2230.33,"Ms. Kovner, would your answer to the Chief Justice's question be different if a -- if a company said you can take a bushel of wheat or its equivalent in cash value?"
2017.17-530,1,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,2230.33,2231.42,"Yes, Your Honor."
2017.17-530,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2258.82,2273.97,Except Mr. Dupree told us that there -- there isn't any real jeopardy to the system if these stock options were not subject to the -- to the tax.
2017.17-530,1,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,2273.97,2290.745,"So I don't think -- with respect, I don't think that the points that Mr. Dupree was making are exactly correct, and if I could explain why. Mr. Dupree's first response was that the tax rate self-adjusts under the RRTA. That's true for the second tier of the RRTA, the sort of supplemental pension benefit system."
2017.17-530,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2344.165,2358.08,Is a third -- a third possibility that the employee waits until after he or she retires and doesn't receive the big salary and then exercises the option?
2017.17-530,1,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,2358.08,2358.83,The --
2017.17-530,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2358.83,2361.215,Or -- or is that unrealistic?
2017.17-530,1,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,2361.215,2389.99,"You know, it's -- it's possible that there are some options that don't get taxed for that reason, but, obviously, if the Court were to say that any payment that a company makes to its employees over the duration of their career that takes the form of stock is not taxable, that's posing a -- a threat to the railroad retirement system. You know, I think if the Court has doubts about how the term ""any form of money remuneration"" is -- is construed, ambiguity in the word ""money,"" I think the surrounding language is helpful."
2017.17-530,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2423.18,2425.285,I guess I'm not sure how the regulations help you.
2017.17-530,1,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,2448.175,2455.08,"I mean, I think that if -- if the regulation had provided a lot greater clarity and discussed stock in particular, obviously, that would have been helpful."
2017.17-530,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2457.35,2460.13,How is the existing regulation helpful to the government?
2017.17-530,1,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,2460.13,2460.3,Sure.
2017.17-530,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2505.04,2530.215,"I don't know. That doesn't help me because, if you're equating, as the current regulations do, the railroad money remuneration with FICA's wages, what do we do -- FICA requires you to value a hard-to-value stock option, and you're telling me it's not required under money remuneration."
2017.17-530,1,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,2530.215,2531.18,"No, we think --"
2017.17-530,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2531.18,2539.075,So I'm not quite sure how you can equate it when you yourself have recognized the major difference.
2017.17-530,1,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,2539.075,2545.53,So we think that options would be treated the same under FICA as they are under the RRTA --
2017.17-530,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2545.53,2549.5,"That's easy because it's publicly traded, it's the known value."
2017.17-530,1,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,2560.525,2578.37,"And we think ""money"" does some work, we think -- but we think the work that ""money remuneration"" is doing in FICA -- in the RRTA is now basically covered by enumerated exemptions under FICA. So, basically, Congress comes in and they add exceptions for things like de minimis benefits and fringe benefits."
2017.17-530,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2611.75,2611.86,And --
2017.17-530,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2611.86,2612.24,If we were --
2017.17-530,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2612.24,2612.865,"-- and, Ms. Kovner --"
2017.17-530,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2612.865,2630.545,"If we were to agree with you, we would have to assume that whoever wrote this statute was told we want you to include money remuneration and stock remuneration; and he said, well, a good way to do that would be to say ""money remuneration."" Right? You're -- you're asking us to accept that, aren't you?"
2017.17-530,1,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,2630.545,2631.68,I -- I don't think exactly.
2017.17-530,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2649.33,2649.43,Well --
2017.17-530,1,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,2649.43,2649.78,-- of the statute.
2017.17-530,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2649.78,2661.12,"-- I'm not -- I'm not saying there isn't a broader use and someone might understand it, but I think if you wanted to be even close to being clear, or reasonably clear, and you want to include both money and stock, you wouldn't pick the phrase ""money."""
2017.17-530,1,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,2661.12,2661.7,I think --
2017.17-530,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2661.7,2672.96,"You would either say ""money and stock,"" or you might say, as you suggested, is something readily reducible -- ascertainable value readily reducible to cash."
2017.17-530,1,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,2672.96,2678.35,"It's not clear that ""stock"" was, you know, necessarily at the forefront of the drafters' mind."
2017.17-530,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2706.42,2711.73,I thought -- I thought you might have answered the Chief Justice by saying it means any form of money remuneration.
2017.17-530,1,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,2714.83,2716.815,"You know, obviously -- (Laughter.)"
2017.17-530,1,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,2716.815,2734.81,"-- if -- if Congress had spoken directly to stock one way or the other, either said it's in or it's out, we wouldn't be here today, but I think the only reasonable interpretation of the word ""money"" as it was used in the statute, particularly given the regulations and Congress's ratification of those regulations and all of the exceptions that Congress has added since, is that it reaches by --"
2017.17-530,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2734.81,2738.46,You -- you think that's the only reasonable -- I -- I didn't think your argument went that far.
2017.17-530,1,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,2738.46,2742.29,"Well, I -- I'd be happy to accept that it's the most reasonable reading of the statute --"
2017.17-530,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2742.29,2746.715,"I thought in some places where you're talking about the regulations, your idea was it was ""a"" reasonable one."
2017.17-530,1,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,2746.715,2747.99,And -- and we think that --
2017.17-530,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2747.99,2750.185,Saying it's the only reasonable one is a bit of a stretch.
2017.17-530,1,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,2750.185,2750.65,Fair enough.
2017.17-530,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2759.51,2759.88,But if I --
2017.17-530,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2759.88,2766.59,"Do you -- do you think the later adopted exemptions change the meaning of ""money remuneration""?"
2017.17-530,1,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,2766.59,2767.06,I -- I don't think --
2017.17-530,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2767.06,2768.015,How can they do that?
2017.17-530,1,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,2768.015,2790.55,"So I think what this Court has said -- I mean, it said it in Casey, it said it in Fausto, it's in the Scalia and Garner treatise, is that when this Court interprets statutes, if there's an ambiguous term in the early statute and then later provisions get enacted that shed light and make clear that Congress is acting on the understanding that it's the broader form of -- of the term that was used, then you construe the statutes together."
2017.17-530,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2796.9,2800.72,So the -- what is the answer to my question? Does it change the meaning or not?
2017.17-530,1,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,2800.72,2804.38,It resolves an ambiguity in the meaning of the prior provision.
2017.17-530,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2804.38,2829.15,"If you could just go back to some answers you gave to prior questions about how to work this on privately listed companies, did -- did I get it right that you're just saying that -- that the how and exactly -- the -- the method by which this is understood as taxable in this context is the same as in the income tax context? Is that right?"
2017.17-530,1,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,2829.15,2829.59,That's right.
2017.17-530,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2844.32,2848.19,"Thank you, counsel. Four minutes, Mr. Dupree."
2017.17-530,2,42633,thomas_h_dupree_jr,,2848.19,2849.36,Thank you.
2017.17-530,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2882.48,2888.935,"How many of those other code provisions use the words ""money remuneration"" as opposed to just ""money""?"
2017.17-530,2,42633,thomas_h_dupree_jr,,2888.935,2904.99,"They -- they don't, Justice Sotomayor, but at the same time, I think ""money remuneration"" can simply be understood as remuneration in money, which, of course, begs the question as to, well, what's money? And our point is that when Congress puts the word ""money"" in a tax statute, it unambiguously excludes stock."
2017.17-530,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2954.825,2955.975,"Thank you, counsel."
