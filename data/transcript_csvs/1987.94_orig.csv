1987.94_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,1.981,The case is submitted.
1987.94_orig,0,31404,john_p_linton,,70.827,73.811,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1987.94_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,191.737,201.425,"Yes, but Mr. Linton, the Master also found that there was very little economic loss to the States as a result of that choice, didn't he?"
1987.94_orig,0,31404,john_p_linton,,201.425,204.153,"The Master did find it, Your Honor."
1987.94_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,259.209,262.873,But is it -- is it a purely dignitary kind of interest?
1987.94_orig,0,31404,john_p_linton,,262.873,263.727,No.
1987.94_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,263.727,271.813,"Yeah, that is the -- you can (Inaudible) that there's no economic harm to the State of South Carolina that results from this -- the TEFRA §310?"
1987.94_orig,0,31404,john_p_linton,,271.813,273.172,"Absolutely not, Your Honor."
1987.94_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,273.172,274.826,What -- what then is the economic?
1987.94_orig,0,31404,john_p_linton,,274.826,279.483,"Well, first of all, the Master found that in certain circumstances, it would be economic harm."
1987.94_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,307.598,317.671,"You know, a long time ago, Chief Justice Marshall and I think it was the McCulloch against Maryland said, “The power to tax is the power to destroy.”"
1987.94_orig,0,31404,john_p_linton,,334.934,338.067,"Your Honor, we think it has weathered well."
1987.94_orig,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,416.106,420.33,"Mr. Linton, do we look at this as tax or as a regulation?"
1987.94_orig,0,31404,john_p_linton,,424.556,426.022,"Yes, Your Honor."
1987.94_orig,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,443.782,466.027,Is that because it -- it's sort of a threat based on an unconstitutional sanction in your view that the -- the Government can't regulate the nature of their bond issue by threatening the imposition of an unconstitutional sanction?
1987.94_orig,0,31404,john_p_linton,,466.027,489.176,"It has a -- that is the core of it, Your Honor, and the other aspect of it is the heart of the right of that States recognized in this immunity from taxation by the National Government as to debt which is backed up by its general obligation taxing power is to tailor that instrument in a manner in which the state fields is most appropriate to market."
1987.94_orig,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,489.176,505.414,"Well, what if we accept all of the Master's findings of fact which is the Chief Justice suggest indicate basically that in this particular instance, it's not a terrible burden economically on the States."
1987.94_orig,0,31404,john_p_linton,,515.575,535.38,"We ask you to rely on the Pollock case to the extent that it is still the law of this Court, but we also point to the Massachusetts case in which what the Court said is we're not going to get caught up in the question of whether immunity applies to a user fee."
1987.94_orig,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,544.334,550.497,"But the bottom, what does it rest on textually in the constitution do you think?"
1987.94_orig,0,31404,john_p_linton,,550.497,552.74,"The tax immunity doctrine, Your Honor?"
1987.94_orig,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,566.141,576.952,Can States today tax the interest income on Federal Government issuance's of securities?
1987.94_orig,0,31404,john_p_linton,,576.952,592.873,"Your Honor, according to -- No, the answer is no, and under the Rockford case, I think the issue -- that was decided by this Court last June, so long as the interest on those bonds is a pledge of the United States, we would not be able to tax revenues."
1987.94_orig,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,592.873,601.435,"Will you take the position that this, all the state municipal bonds pledge the credit of the States or the municipalities?"
1987.94_orig,0,31404,john_p_linton,,601.435,612.11,The issue that we have -- we invoked jurisdiction on is a general obligation bond which pledges the full faith credit and taxing power of State of South Carolina.
1987.94_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,612.11,628.6,"Mr. Linton, are you saying that any federal regulation of the States have authority to raise money by issuing bonds is -- is unconstitutional?"
1987.94_orig,0,31404,john_p_linton,,628.6,632.712,A regulation that interferes with the right a State to borrow.
1987.94_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,632.712,642.122,"But -- and you're saying, interfering with the right of the State to borrow, even though only tiny economic consequences may -- may flow."
1987.94_orig,0,31404,john_p_linton,,642.122,645.726,"Of course, the issue is not economic consequences."
1987.94_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,666.164,673.258,"Yeah, but of course the United States and the States do not operate on a totally two-way street in our system."
1987.94_orig,0,31404,john_p_linton,,673.258,680.464,"Your Honor, we recognize that, but what this Court said in New York was there is irreducible core of federalism."
1987.94_orig,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,705.687,707.157,But it doesn't tax the States.
1987.94_orig,0,31404,john_p_linton,,742.891,748.049,"Your Honor, you're correct in one sense that you say that it's the tax on the bond procedure is the owner."
1987.94_orig,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,783.908,788.977,"What about a sales tax, the burden of which is born by the purchaser?"
1987.94_orig,0,31404,john_p_linton,,809.903,812.997,"No, sir and the courts rejected that argument."
1987.94_orig,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,820.038,821.922,"Well, why doesn't that interfere with the right to borrow?"
1987.94_orig,0,31404,john_p_linton,,823.934,824.74,Because --
1987.94_orig,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,824.74,832.355,"The only reason -- the only reason you loan a stake money is to get the interest, the only reason you want the interest is to spend it and you're interfering with my right to spend it."
1987.94_orig,0,31404,john_p_linton,,832.355,855.124,"The Court makes the distinction between the attenuated effect on the sales tax example on the tax of employees versus the States' obligation to tax in the future, the States -- that affects on the bond aspect when you're dealing with general obligations is the obligation the State to tax is citizens to retire that debt, it interferes with --"
1987.94_orig,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,855.124,855.7,May I --
1987.94_orig,0,31404,john_p_linton,,855.7,856.232,-- states to borrow.
1987.94_orig,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,856.232,864.546,"May I ask, then supposing in the Congress (Inaudible) statute that said, all bonds and issues of over two or three million dollars must be registered."
1987.94_orig,0,31404,john_p_linton,,869.591,873.066,It would be unconstitutional because it conveyed the rights of --
1987.94_orig,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,873.066,875.393,Insofar as it was enforced against the State of the --
1987.94_orig,0,31404,john_p_linton,,875.393,876.486,"Yes, sir."
1987.94_orig,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,897.452,914.674,"Well, Mr. Linton, what if Congress said in your commerce power that no one who buys one of these bonds may transfer it without registration, and the practical effect of that is to also make the States have to register their bonds."
1987.94_orig,0,31404,john_p_linton,,914.674,918.099,"Your Honor, the Congress was not exercising its commerce power --"
1987.94_orig,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,918.099,923.221,"Well, I'm saying, “what if"", can Congress do that?"
1987.94_orig,0,31404,john_p_linton,,923.221,927.184,We -- we think that a different test applies under the taxing power.
1987.94_orig,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,950.4,960.523,"Well, I understood even -- even your interveners, National Governors' Association thought congress could do what I suggested, but you take issue with them."
1987.94_orig,0,31404,john_p_linton,,960.523,965.765,I -- I think you introduced that if they -- it was so coercive that they had absolutely no choice.
1987.94_orig,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,965.765,971.193,"Well, I said the practical effect of it is going to be that States are going to have to register their bond."
1987.94_orig,0,31404,john_p_linton,,971.193,989.637,"But they could -- Congress could do perhaps under the commerce clause without invading the sovereignty of the States because then the States would have chosen to go into an area, it is regulated under the constitution, the interstate commerce is regulated exclusively by Congress."
1987.94_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1011.57,1012.558,"Thank you, Mr. Linton."
1987.94_orig,1,34701,lewis_b_kaden,,1015.959,1018.841,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1987.94_orig,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1075.361,1079.121,You will come (Inaudible) this conscription has been affected.
1987.94_orig,1,34701,lewis_b_kaden,,1079.121,1080.276,"Yes, indeed."
1987.94_orig,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1121.906,1127.132,"On the -- on the threat of the people who -- who are having the bonds, not having the tax deduction."
1987.94_orig,1,34701,lewis_b_kaden,,1127.132,1127.814,"Yes, but as the --"
1987.94_orig,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1127.814,1130.55,What about the 55-mile speed limit?
1987.94_orig,1,34701,lewis_b_kaden,,1130.55,1138.645,This -- this was no condition that gave the States an option as this Court found in the South Dakota case to comply or not.
1987.94_orig,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1150.011,1153.791,"Well, the States could -- could fully not register the bonds."
1987.94_orig,1,34701,lewis_b_kaden,,1165.401,1168.691,I think the difference in the measure of coercion is significant here.
1987.94_orig,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1169.413,1171.657,"I'm talking about the degree of coercion, that's --"
1987.94_orig,1,34701,lewis_b_kaden,,1171.657,1172.174,That's right.
1987.94_orig,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1172.174,1172.72,-- that's --
1987.94_orig,1,34701,lewis_b_kaden,,1172.72,1182.991,"That rights, and -- and that coercion is reflected as I indicate and the fact that the legislative history indicates, no intent to raise money and no effect of raising revenue."
1987.94_orig,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1206.465,1207.864,May I just interrupt for a second?
1987.94_orig,1,34701,lewis_b_kaden,,1207.864,1207.867,"Yes, sir."
1987.94_orig,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1207.867,1216.88,"A degree of coercion within the amount of money loss in highway funds exceed in monetary value, the economic lost -- cost of registration?"
1987.94_orig,1,34701,lewis_b_kaden,,1216.88,1223.85,"No, I think far from it, the penalty in the South Dakota case, if I remember correctly, was 5% of available highway funds."
1987.94_orig,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1228.044,1229.398,"No, if you do register --"
1987.94_orig,1,34701,lewis_b_kaden,,1229.398,1236.175,"-- would be 28 to 32% of their total borrowing cost, billions of dollars a year."
1987.94_orig,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1236.175,1240.975,But if the -- I thought that if Master found the economic cost of compliance (Inaudible)
1987.94_orig,1,34701,lewis_b_kaden,,1240.975,1241.567,Exactly.
1987.94_orig,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1256.183,1262.287,"You can coerce them but not effectively, that's the principle."
1987.94_orig,1,34701,lewis_b_kaden,,1262.287,1263.178,"Here, the effect was complete."
1987.94_orig,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1263.178,1265.241,"(Inaudible) strange constitutional principle, is it?"
1987.94_orig,1,34701,lewis_b_kaden,,1265.519,1265.55,No.
1987.94_orig,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1265.55,1268.363,-- to apply the coercion but not enough to be effective.
1987.94_orig,1,34701,lewis_b_kaden,,1268.363,1269.086,I don't think so.
1987.94_orig,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1277.822,1288.96,"But Mr. Kaden, every time Congress gets under the act with one of its programs that wants the States to help them out with, you have the same kind of a problem."
1987.94_orig,1,34701,lewis_b_kaden,,1292.612,1295.586,You don't have the compulsion to pass laws.
1987.94_orig,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1359.449,1373.846,But what about EEOC and it's -- it differs for 90 days to state Equal Employment Commission Proceedings if the State creates one that it certainly provides a strong incentive for a State to create wanted by legislation.
1987.94_orig,1,34701,lewis_b_kaden,,1373.846,1379.198,I think that provides an option and what is otherwise a generally applicable regulation.
1987.94_orig,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1393.012,1402.633,"But they also -- Congress also said in the EEOC that if a State creates its own board, the Federal Commission will defer proceedings for 90 days."
1987.94_orig,1,34701,lewis_b_kaden,,1402.633,1419.984,"Exactly, which is analogous to the saying in the Hodel case that if the State chooses to set up a regulatory machinery for service mining, it can play that role, otherwise, it will be preempted and fall under the federal regulatory machinery."
1987.94_orig,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1579.736,1580.08,Well --
1987.94_orig,1,34701,lewis_b_kaden,,1580.08,1580.083,--jurisdiction.
1987.94_orig,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1580.083,1587.689,-- Mr. Fried argues that the State has the choice of coercive issuing bearer bonds and letting people pay the tax.
1987.94_orig,1,34701,lewis_b_kaden,,1587.689,1591.031,"Well, he doesn't really argue that with any conviction."
1987.94_orig,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1636.466,1637.103,"Well, could Congress --"
1987.94_orig,1,34701,lewis_b_kaden,,1637.103,1638.106,-- the community issue.
1987.94_orig,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1638.106,1642.882,-- could Congress have achieved the same goal exactly by some other means --
1987.94_orig,1,34701,lewis_b_kaden,,1642.882,1642.973,"Yes, indeed."
1987.94_orig,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1642.973,1644.074,-- that you would accept?
1987.94_orig,1,34701,lewis_b_kaden,,1644.074,1645.15,"Yes, indeed."
1987.94_orig,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1736.566,1746.449,"Excuse me, you -- you think the 55-mile speed limit requirement would have been bad if the sanction for the States failure to observe it had been high enough --"
1987.94_orig,1,34701,lewis_b_kaden,,1746.449,1746.69,If --
1987.94_orig,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1746.69,1749.203,"-- all highway funds eliminated, that -- that would have done it."
1987.94_orig,1,34701,lewis_b_kaden,,1749.203,1760.539,"No, it would have depended on a finding by a fact finder of whether it was coercive, that's the test that court established in Stewart and reaffirmed in -- in South Dakota."
1987.94_orig,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1798.375,1799.557,"Thank you, Mr. Kaden."
1987.94_orig,2,18942,charles_fried,,1804.135,1807.656,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1987.94_orig,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1904.896,1921.086,"Mr. Fried, do you think that's objecting all interest income from municipal bonds, the federal income tax could be said to interfere with essential state or local functions?"
1987.94_orig,2,18942,charles_fried,,1921.086,1923.92,That is a very serious question.
1987.94_orig,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1953.257,1953.768,Right.
1987.94_orig,2,18942,charles_fried,,1957.574,1966.706,"Well, if I may answer you at a little bit of length, Congress has declined to press that issue."
1987.94_orig,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2010.92,2010.923,So you're not going to --
1987.94_orig,2,18942,charles_fried,,2010.923,2012.102,-- in from the confrontation.
1987.94_orig,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2012.102,2025.705,-- answer my question of whether there is any constitutional limit to the removal of the freedom from federal income tax of these bonds.
1987.94_orig,2,18942,charles_fried,,2025.705,2029.192,I suspect there very well maybe a constitutional limit.
1987.94_orig,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2029.192,2031.645,And what would it rest?
1987.94_orig,2,18942,charles_fried,,2031.645,2037.409,"I think it would rest on the Tenth Amendment, I think it would rest on principles of federalism."
1987.94_orig,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2075.28,2085.891,"Well, it's concern because I'm not sure to what extent we have to address in this case, the intergovernmental tax immunity problem."
1987.94_orig,2,18942,charles_fried,,2085.891,2085.931,I would --
1987.94_orig,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2085.931,2090.424,The States are urging that we must address it and it is a concern.
1987.94_orig,2,18942,charles_fried,,2090.424,2106.193,"It is a concern but I believe that a concern of that degree of seriousness should not be addressed and need not to be addressed in the case, but what is at stake is to speak frankly utterly trivial."
1987.94_orig,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2121.367,2125.615,You're not asking us to overrule what's left of Pollock.
1987.94_orig,2,18942,charles_fried,,2125.615,2133.359,"No because there is no occasion to do so, Justice Blackmun."
1987.94_orig,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2335.853,2366.519,"Well, Mr. Fried, supposed one thought indeed as I made that there is a constitutional prohibition against the Federal Government taxing income from these municipal bonds, may the Congress just use that forum of imposing a tax as a meanings of regulation and we should close our eyes to the forum chosen?"
1987.94_orig,2,18942,charles_fried,,2366.519,2387.342,"I would think in this circumstance if that was your premise, you would still, I think, not have cause for worry because as the Special Master found, and his findings are entirely consistent with the intentions of Congress."
1987.94_orig,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2441.515,2446.709,You don't think the mean selected should be proper?
