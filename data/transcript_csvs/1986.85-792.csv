1986.85-792,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,16.426,"We will hear arguments next in two consolidated cases, Interstate Commerce Commission against Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Missouri-Kansas-Texas Railroad Company against Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers."
1986.85-792,0,27892,henri_f_rush_jr,,61.539,65.942,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1986.85-792,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,198.212,212.872,"Mr. Rush, did the respondents in this case raise their argument about their rights under the collective bargaining agreement before the ICC at its hearings on the merger?"
1986.85-792,0,27892,henri_f_rush_jr,,212.872,215.491,"They did not, Justice O'Connor."
1986.85-792,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,215.491,219.359,"Well, how is it that they can raise them later?"
1986.85-792,0,27892,henri_f_rush_jr,,221.895,225.262,"The guise, if you'll--"
1986.85-792,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,225.262,227.381,Why aren't they precluded from doing that?
1986.85-792,0,27892,henri_f_rush_jr,,227.381,242.641,"--Well, the court below held that they the jurisdiction to determine whether the Commission had improperly failed to clarify at the request of the petitioners."
1986.85-792,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,254.949,260.519,You took the position that it was perfectly all right for them to come in later and raise the issue; is that it?
1986.85-792,0,27892,henri_f_rush_jr,,260.519,262.32,"--No, that's not our position at all."
1986.85-792,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,277.897,279.147,Exactly.
1986.85-792,0,27892,henri_f_rush_jr,,287.753,299.228,"Well, I think that an argument can be made for waiver of rights not raised at the proper time before the agency's procedure."
1986.85-792,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,306.481,307.981,It isn't just that.
1986.85-792,0,27892,henri_f_rush_jr,,314.051,316.92,"--That's correct, Judge Scalia."
1986.85-792,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,317.937,319.505,So how do you get around that here?
1986.85-792,0,27892,henri_f_rush_jr,,324.693,339.452,"--Well, our view of jurisdiction is that there was at least jurisdiction in the lower court to determine whether the Commission abused its discretion by refusing the clarify its earlier ruling."
1986.85-792,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,339.452,342.237,"Okay, now how is that?"
1986.85-792,0,27892,henri_f_rush_jr,,347.039,348.307,That's correct.
1986.85-792,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,348.307,354.128,"Then there was filed a petition to reconsider the denial of the petition to clarify, right?"
1986.85-792,0,27892,henri_f_rush_jr,,354.128,355.595,"Right, correct."
1986.85-792,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,355.595,363.084,"And the appeal that we have before us is from that denial of the petition to reconsider, isn't it?"
1986.85-792,0,27892,henri_f_rush_jr,,363.084,366.685,Both the petition for clarification and the petition to reconsider.
1986.85-792,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,366.685,370.804,Was an appeal filed from the petition to clarify?
1986.85-792,0,27892,henri_f_rush_jr,,370.804,381.528,"It was embraced within the denial of the petition to reconsider, it seems to me, because clearly, upon denying the petition to reconsider, the initial petition would be in issue."
1986.85-792,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,381.528,383.312,It's not what the statute reads like.
1986.85-792,0,27892,henri_f_rush_jr,,423.837,442.917,"That's correct, except viewed as an administrative appeal, it has also been held that a properly filed administrative appeal... which is what we deem the two petitions to reconsider the denial of clarification to be... tolls that period and commences it running at the time of the denial of the administrative appeal."
1986.85-792,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,442.917,449.671,A petition to reconsider stays the... tolls the running of the Hobbes Act?
1986.85-792,0,27892,henri_f_rush_jr,,449.671,461.795,"It commences the time running for seeking judicial review, much as denial of a petition for rehearing in a lower court starts the time for seeking certain--"
1986.85-792,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,461.795,464.747,Judicial review of what?
1986.85-792,0,27892,henri_f_rush_jr,,466.897,467.597,"--No, no, no."
1986.85-792,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,480.773,481.74,Why was that even open?
1986.85-792,0,27892,henri_f_rush_jr,,511.442,518.131,"--It may, if I understood your question, that a properly filed petition for reconsideration was filed with the agency."
1986.85-792,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,518.131,519.115,Within the 60 days?
1986.85-792,0,27892,henri_f_rush_jr,,519.115,520.347,Within the time limit.
1986.85-792,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,520.347,522.417,And then the 60 days expire.
1986.85-792,0,27892,henri_f_rush_jr,,524.701,533.391,"Well, that... there are a number of cases that are not included in our brief, I regret to say, that address that issue."
1986.85-792,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,533.391,535.257,It's not what Eagle-Picher says.
1986.85-792,0,27892,henri_f_rush_jr,,554.888,563.493,"Well, there are other cases that do address that, and have in fact held that the time commences from the--"
1986.85-792,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,563.493,564.693,"Well, I'd like to know what they were."
1986.85-792,0,27892,henri_f_rush_jr,,565.528,567.462,--I will supply them to the Court.
1986.85-792,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,608.789,610.641,--Let me make sure I understand your argument now.
1986.85-792,0,27892,henri_f_rush_jr,,614.526,615.143,That's correct.
1986.85-792,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,615.143,628.536,"And your argument is that the petition to reconsider the denial, what, tolls the 60-day period as long as that petition is pending, the 60-day period is tolled?"
1986.85-792,0,27892,henri_f_rush_jr,,628.536,640.077,"Made the 60-day period, for appeal of that denial of clarification, run from the date the administrative appeal is denied."
1986.85-792,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,640.077,660.24,"But what do you do with the statute that says, notwithstanding the ability to file a motion for reconsideration, notwithstanding it, an action of the Commission under this section is final on the date in which it was served, and a civil action to enforce or suspend it may be filed after that date?"
1986.85-792,0,27892,henri_f_rush_jr,,660.24,671.882,"Well, I think we look at the D.C. Circuit case shortly after that very provision was passed."
1986.85-792,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,671.882,672.632,It may be filed.
1986.85-792,0,27892,henri_f_rush_jr,,677.334,680.386,"Well, we have not so interpreted it."
1986.85-792,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,697.662,700.181,So long as the appeal is filed within the 60 days?
1986.85-792,0,27892,henri_f_rush_jr,,700.181,701.799,That's correct.
1986.85-792,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,701.799,707.369,That does seem... that does seem to... that does seem to disregard the 60-day reference in the statute.
1986.85-792,0,27892,henri_f_rush_jr,,713.023,717.309,"Yes, I'm sure it is, Justice Black."
1986.85-792,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,717.309,720.261,"xxx real substance to it, you'll win."
1986.85-792,0,27892,henri_f_rush_jr,,720.261,722.213,But on a very narrow ground.
1986.85-792,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,739.239,740.875,And you want a ruling on the merits?
1986.85-792,0,27892,henri_f_rush_jr,,740.875,750.696,"Yes, we very much do, having exerted this much time and effort in the case to date; and I believe that the respondents want the same thing."
1986.85-792,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,770.277,772.062,One more question.
1986.85-792,0,27892,henri_f_rush_jr,,787.571,788.305,That's correct.
1986.85-792,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,788.305,793.892,So your theory would not even cover that?
1986.85-792,0,27892,henri_f_rush_jr,,793.892,794.392,"No, I--"
1986.85-792,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,794.392,801.665,How do you enable us to get into the merits of the original order on the basis of the petition to clarify?
1986.85-792,0,27892,henri_f_rush_jr,,801.665,818.591,"--I think that very much as with a rule, and there are a number of cases from the D.C. Circuit on that, that rather than go to court with an untimely challenge, you can ask the agency to amend, reconsider, in this case clarify--"
1986.85-792,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,818.591,821.543,"Well, that's all you need to get around the 60 days of the Hobbes Act?"
1986.85-792,0,27892,henri_f_rush_jr,,825.53,834.902,"--Well, we believe, as we've indicated in our brief, that an Eagle-Picher analysis can and should be applied to whether that request for clarification is proper."
1986.85-792,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,834.902,836.302,"Well, how does it work out here?"
1986.85-792,0,27892,henri_f_rush_jr,,852.698,856.133,"They can, and unquestionably, should have been."
1986.85-792,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,856.766,859.884,"Well, that's the end of it then, as far as Eagle-Picher is concerned, isn't it?"
1986.85-792,0,27892,henri_f_rush_jr,,859.884,867.038,"--Well, of course, Eagle-Picher has been... not been applied retroactively, if you will, when this case was in the pipeline."
1986.85-792,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,867.038,869.407,"Well, nor is Eagle-Picher... nor is Eagle-Picher a decision of this Court."
1986.85-792,0,27892,henri_f_rush_jr,,869.407,871.942,That's very correct.
1986.85-792,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,871.942,886.451,"Mr. Rush, if the respondents had raised the issue of their collective bargaining rights during the original ICC hearings on the merger, would the agency have considered them, the ICC?"
1986.85-792,0,27892,henri_f_rush_jr,,886.451,889.57,"I have no doubt they would have, Justice O'Connor."
1986.85-792,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,895.224,899.176,"Well, the respondents seem to be suggesting that had they done so they wouldn't have been heard."
1986.85-792,0,27892,henri_f_rush_jr,,902.811,905.913,I think they have absolutely no basis for that assertion.
1986.85-792,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,905.913,912.001,Are there any limits as to what the ICC can exempt under this statute?
1986.85-792,0,27892,henri_f_rush_jr,,918.071,920.339,"Well, the ICC does not exempt."
1986.85-792,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,978.478,982.247,Why don't you spend a couple of minutes on the merits before your--
1986.85-792,0,27892,henri_f_rush_jr,,982.247,987.751,"Well, I had hoped to reserve some time."
1986.85-792,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1049.974,1051.759,"--Mr. Rush, can I ask just one question."
1986.85-792,0,27892,henri_f_rush_jr,,1064.333,1069.035,"--I would think when the Commission's approval had withstood judicial review, sir."
1986.85-792,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1069.035,1075.625,"You don't contend that the exemption became effective automatically on October 20, 1982?"
1986.85-792,0,27892,henri_f_rush_jr,,1075.625,1083.044,"Well, I think it does, subject to being overturned, if some aspect of the decision is overturned on reviewed."
1986.85-792,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1099.073,1100.856,"Yes, but nothing has been overturned since then."
1986.85-792,0,27892,henri_f_rush_jr,,1100.856,1101.942,"--No, it has not."
1986.85-792,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1102.525,1107.227,"Well, that's not quite right, I guess, because... well, okay."
1986.85-792,0,27892,henri_f_rush_jr,,1107.227,1114.0,"--In the context of this case, my answer would be that it took place in 1982 when the Commission approved the transaction."
1986.85-792,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1118.885,1119.986,"Thank you, Mr. Rush."
1986.85-792,1,31777,joseph_l_manson_iii,,1127.323,1131.711,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1986.85-792,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1192.683,1196.904,xxx any of the questions in the petitions reserved?
1986.85-792,1,31777,joseph_l_manson_iii,,1196.904,1204.658,"Well, it's not raised in our cert petition, but the government raised it in there, as a preliminary matter in its belief."
1986.85-792,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1382.438,1390.377,Would that also... would that also have been true if the terms of the trackage lease agreements had not said anything about who would do the crewing?
1986.85-792,1,31777,joseph_l_manson_iii,,1390.377,1391.543,"--Yes, it would, Your Honor."
1986.85-792,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1429.666,1438.94,"But Mr. Manson, what did the statement in the ICC labor protective conditions, to the effect that collective bargaining rights shall be preserved, mean?"
1986.85-792,1,31777,joseph_l_manson_iii,,1438.94,1449.396,"--That provisions means, Justice O'Connor, that the collective bargaining agreements, the rights of the employees, are preserved, but in the context of the Commission's approval."
1986.85-792,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1489.29,1490.19,I'm not sure what you're saying.
1986.85-792,1,31777,joseph_l_manson_iii,,1497.626,1504.799,"Well, except, I would say principally... the principal exception would be with respect to the implementation of a transaction."
1986.85-792,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1539.972,1543.191,"Well, why wasn't the Commission's order qualified then?"
1986.85-792,1,31777,joseph_l_manson_iii,,1553.647,1575.643,"Well, because I think that it's clear from the... from reading Article I Section 4 in conjunction with Article I Section 2, and it's certainly clear from the decisions of the Interstate Commerce Commission, from the legislative history and decisions of the courts, that provisions of collective bargaining agreements must give way to implementation of Commission-approved transactions."
1986.85-792,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1718.269,1719.455,"Thank you, Mr. Manson."
1986.85-792,2,27901,harold_a_ross,,1723.407,1728.561,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1986.85-792,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1777.875,1779.143,"It's jurisdictional though, isn't it?"
1986.85-792,2,27901,harold_a_ross,,1780.759,1781.111,"Yes, Your Honor."
1986.85-792,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1781.545,1787.015,"Well, if that's the case, the parties simply by agreeing not to raise it can't confer jurisdiction on us, can they?"
1986.85-792,2,27901,harold_a_ross,,1787.015,1795.685,"--However, there are certain exceptions that even the Court of Appeals below recognized are applicable."
1986.85-792,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1813.463,1815.148,"Well, Mr. Ross, Eagle-Picher isn't a decision of this Court."
1986.85-792,2,27901,harold_a_ross,,1815.148,1816.534,"I understand, Your Honor."
1986.85-792,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1835.329,1849.505,"But if all that was properly brought to the Court of Appeals was a refusal of the Commission to, in effect, rehear a petition to clarify, I would think the standard of review would be dramatically different than if you were really bringing the merits before it properly?"
1986.85-792,2,27901,harold_a_ross,,1849.505,1878.089,"Well, Your Honor, the thing was is this, that it's come up in previous decisions of the Court: The organizations, the employee representatives, had no idea that the Commission's order that was issued in October of 1982 had the function that is now being claimed by the Commission that it had; that in other words that the collective bargaining agreements had been effectively abrogated by the Commission's decision."
1986.85-792,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1901.704,1910.144,But the merger agreements it approved specifically said that the railroads would or might use their own crews.
1986.85-792,2,27901,harold_a_ross,,1912.246,1916.614,"But, Your Honor, that had never represented what actually was going to take place."
1986.85-792,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1940.413,1945.4,Had all these other ones contained specific provisions like that where the railroads said that they would use their own crews?
1986.85-792,2,27901,harold_a_ross,,1945.4,1947.267,"Yes, Your Honor."
1986.85-792,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2047.532,2053.436,That's the case in which the consolidation agreement said specifically that--
1986.85-792,2,27901,harold_a_ross,,2053.436,2059.589,"--The Southern Railway employees would have all of the jobs, or most of the jobs."
1986.85-792,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2060.804,2073.147,--What is the citation... is that the only example that you have of how the Commission previously has written opinions like this that didn't mean what they appear to me to mean on their face?
1986.85-792,2,27901,harold_a_ross,,2073.147,2080.335,"That citation is at 331 ICC 151, and the discussion, I believe, was at pages 165 through 173."
1986.85-792,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2232.734,2248.727,"Mr. Ross, may I just ask you to clarify for a minute why you didn't ask in the original proceedings that the ICC specifically eliminate the part of the application that had to do with the crews on trackage rights?"
1986.85-792,2,27901,harold_a_ross,,2248.727,2259.617,"--Justice O'Connor, it was our understanding at the time that the case was heard before the Commission that the Commission would impose certain employee protections."
1986.85-792,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2259.617,2263.403,That the Commission would?
1986.85-792,2,27901,harold_a_ross,,2263.403,2279.346,"Yes, impose certain employee protections under Section 11347 of the Interstate Commerce Act; and that those employee protections would be the methods by which the rearrangements of forces and other matters that are now before the Court today would be handled."
1986.85-792,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2296.125,2304.563,"If you thought what the Commission had actually done didn't protect you, I would have thought you would have appealed right away?"
1986.85-792,2,27901,harold_a_ross,,2304.563,2305.446,"No, Your Honor, we did."
1986.85-792,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2314.169,2315.371,"Well, it wasn't a suggestion."
1986.85-792,2,27901,harold_a_ross,,2321.958,2352.877,"--But in previous cases, Justice O'Connor, where this had taken place, the employee protective conditions then came into being; the railroad served its notice as to what it intended to do, which contained the so-called rearrangements or the employee schedules that were in its application before the Commission; the parties sat down and negotiated, and if they couldn't agree on what the carrier had suggested to the Commission, then that matter, at least in that narrow area as to the equities, would be resolved by the arbitrator."
1986.85-792,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2401.726,2415.534,I guess behind this whole thing is your view that somehow the collective bargaining agreement gave the union you represent the right to have its crews used?
1986.85-792,2,27901,harold_a_ross,,2415.534,2416.486,--To a certain extent--
1986.85-792,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2416.486,2420.688,Does the record show what the collective bargaining agreement provided?
1986.85-792,2,27901,harold_a_ross,,2422.573,2439.566,"--Now, it was not, Your Honor, because of the basis that we had proceeded on before the Commission, believing that the Commission's employee protective conditions would take care of that one limited area, and that the Commission was, as it had said previously like in the Southern Central of Georgia case, that its decision had no effect whatsoever on the collective bargaining agreements."
1986.85-792,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2540.384,2547.121,"Well, the merger statute that the ICC was operating under in this case didn't have any specific requirement of accommodation, did it?"
1986.85-792,2,27901,harold_a_ross,,2547.121,2548.988,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1986.85-792,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2564.749,2568.034,"But there's no contention that there was a failure to impose that here, is there?"
1986.85-792,2,27901,harold_a_ross,,2568.034,2569.368,"--No, there's no... no."
1986.85-792,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2615.396,2616.682,"Thank you, Mr. Rosee."
1986.85-792,3,29579,john_ob_clarke_jr,,2619.015,2622.585,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1986.85-792,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2890.859,2892.359,"You say, it specifically provides."
1986.85-792,3,29579,john_ob_clarke_jr,,2895.394,2909.403,"I guess I got to go back to it, where I said it... the interstate... the protective condition itself does not authorize... when we're talking about the implementing agreement... it does not authorize the abrogation of collective bargaining agreements."
1986.85-792,3,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2965.24,2988.589,"Well, Mr. Clarke, I still don't understand, if you're right that the ICC just doesn't have authority to upset these collective bargaining rights, and if you read in the application what the intention of the merging railroads was with regard to the crews, you could see for yourself that that was not in accord with your view."
1986.85-792,3,29579,john_ob_clarke_jr,,2988.589,2989.189,"That's correct, ma'am."
1986.85-792,3,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2989.189,2996.259,"Why, then, wouldn't you have gone into the ICC hearing initially and said, eliminate that from the application?"
1986.85-792,3,29579,john_ob_clarke_jr,,2996.259,2996.526,We did.
1986.85-792,3,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3039.853,3044.84,But did you directly address the crew trackage right problem?
1986.85-792,3,29579,john_ob_clarke_jr,,3044.84,3053.445,We did not directly address the question of whether or not the Katy's provisions would authorize the Katy to implement them with their own people for this--
1986.85-792,3,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3053.445,3057.064,And yet it was perfectly clear in the application was intended.
1986.85-792,3,29579,john_ob_clarke_jr,,3057.064,3058.131,"--That is correct, Your Honor."
1986.85-792,3,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3058.131,3058.933,That is the sticking point.
1986.85-792,3,29579,john_ob_clarke_jr,,3058.933,3059.516,That is the sticking--
1986.85-792,3,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3059.516,3061.885,That you should be able to lie in wait--
1986.85-792,3,29579,john_ob_clarke_jr,,3061.885,3063.385,--It wasn't lying in wait.
1986.85-792,3,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3063.385,3066.02,"--seeing this, and then come in later; that's the point."
1986.85-792,3,29579,john_ob_clarke_jr,,3066.02,3076.561,"It was not lying in wait, Your Honor, because the Commission's... the Commission's approval said that the applications were approved subject to employee protection."
1986.85-792,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3086.251,3086.651,Mr. Clarke?
1986.85-792,3,29579,john_ob_clarke_jr,,3086.651,3087.084,"Yes, sir."
1986.85-792,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3087.084,3088.536,Can I ask you another question?
1986.85-792,3,29579,john_ob_clarke_jr,,3129.011,3130.63,"No, we submit they would not, Your Honor."
1986.85-792,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3179.712,3184.68,You're saying they had a statutory duty to leave open the question of who would crew the trains?
1986.85-792,3,29579,john_ob_clarke_jr,,3184.68,3185.464,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1986.85-792,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3186.632,3189.901,Even though it might result in a strike and prolonged arbitration?
1986.85-792,3,29579,john_ob_clarke_jr,,3189.901,3192.584,--The problem... that's the argument that comes in later.
1986.85-792,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3267.251,3270.853,"Yes, but those things could both be preserved and have them nevertheless decide who will crew the train?"
1986.85-792,3,29579,john_ob_clarke_jr,,3270.853,3272.136,"No, we submit they cannot, Your Honor."
1986.85-792,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3314.048,3318.584,Would you say that was true even if there was no loss of employment on the landlord railroad?
1986.85-792,3,29579,john_ob_clarke_jr,,3318.584,3334.36,"Yes, Your Honor, because what you're dealing with in this case... and to take it out of the theoretical and put it down to the concrete... prior to the consummation of the transaction, January 3rd, when the Katy began operations, Missouri Pacific employees performed that work."
1986.85-792,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3337.078,3339.328,"No, I'm assuming there's no loss of work on the landlord railroad."
1986.85-792,3,29579,john_ob_clarke_jr,,3344.748,3354.873,"In that case, Your Honor, the employee protective conditions would most likely work out an arrangement that would give the other carrier all the rights, because it has the equity to perform the work."
1986.85-792,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3492.078,3498.248,What's the best way for us to satisfy ourselves that his indeed been the practice?
1986.85-792,3,29579,john_ob_clarke_jr,,3498.248,3503.052,"Your Honor,... I would ask that's that you take a look at the Texas and New Orleans case."
1986.85-792,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3562.321,3565.09,"Your time has expired, Mr. Clarke."
1986.85-792,4,27892,henri_f_rush_jr,,3568.91,3571.66,"Yes, I do."
1986.85-792,4,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3729.711,3730.78,"Thank you, Mr. Rush."
