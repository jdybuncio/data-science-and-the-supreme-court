2015.14-1175,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,8.52,"We'll hear argument next in Case 14-1175, Franchise Tax Board of California v. Hyatt. Mr. Clement."
2015.14-1175,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,8.52,15.705,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The States entered the Union saddled with substantial war debts."
2015.14-1175,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,66.81,67.46,There is one --
2015.14-1175,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,67.46,68.86,-- there is nothing in Federal law --
2015.14-1175,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,68.86,76.49,"There's one -- there's one significant difference there, Mr. Clement, which is that States are on a par with each other."
2015.14-1175,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,110.465,112.94,"Well, Justice Kagan, here's why I disagree."
2015.14-1175,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,132.925,140.245,"Well, for sure, Mr. -- Mr. Clement, you know, you couldn't go to war with the neighboring State anymore, and that's a difference."
2015.14-1175,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,151.155,152.875,"Well, Justice Kagan, two points."
2015.14-1175,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,161.41,168.89,Is there anything in our -- in -- in our jurisprudence or our constitutional tradition that say States can protect each other by retaliating against each other?
2015.14-1175,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,168.89,190.04,"Well, that's the second point I was going to make, Justice Kennedy, which is it's an odd thing to think that the framers, who had just experienced the Articles of Confederation where they had unsatisfied judgments and the potential that, if the State of New York went after the State of Georgia because Georgia hadn't complied with the requisition for funds, that there would be civil war."
2015.14-1175,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,196.43,202.015,"I -- I mean, I -- I thought that -- I thought that it's illegal for a State to ban Washington apples."
2015.14-1175,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,202.015,203.98,"Well, there is that."
2015.14-1175,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,206.36,217.54,"Mr. Clement, to take you down to the practical level, and we're not getting involved with war, take Nevada against Hall."
2015.14-1175,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,249.575,250.59,Absolutely.
2015.14-1175,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,284.39,285.14,I'm sorry.
2015.14-1175,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,310.43,311.44,"Well, their --"
2015.14-1175,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,311.44,326.645,All -- all -- all I have to do is what? There's no noncitizen of -- of a State who can ever be held -- who could ever sue a State for whatever bad acts they've had.
2015.14-1175,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,326.645,332.03,"Two points, Justice Sotomayor. First of all, let's take a Nevada resident, and let's say California comes in."
2015.14-1175,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,359.49,359.77,What -- what's the --
2015.14-1175,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,359.77,362.04,-- for States to agree to waive their sovereign immunity.
2015.14-1175,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,362.04,363.195,Why would they do that?
2015.14-1175,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,363.195,363.63,"Well, for --"
2015.14-1175,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,363.63,375.015,"I -- I -- I could understand them getting together, which they haven't done, to agree upon limits to each other's or waivers of sovereign immunity."
2015.14-1175,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,379.025,380.78,I suppose consideration --
2015.14-1175,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,380.78,382.875,If they -- if they don't think that they're forced to?
2015.14-1175,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,382.875,384.92,"Well, considerations of convenience."
2015.14-1175,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,403.205,417.5,And we have here 34 states tell us that they didn't like this rule. 45. How come they haven't gotten together and done an agreement among all of them?
2015.14-1175,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,417.5,420.62,Because it would be very burdensome to do that.
2015.14-1175,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,432.21,438.415,There's no question that they gave -- this is why the Eleventh Amendment -- they gave up a lot of things to the Federal government.
2015.14-1175,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,449.32,450.02,Two things --
2015.14-1175,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,450.02,451.27,It's not in the Constitution.
2015.14-1175,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,451.27,453.07,"Two things principally, Your Honor."
2015.14-1175,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,469.57,474.06,And that's what Hall said didn't exist.
2015.14-1175,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,528.81,532.45,"You say ""comity."" I would say, as a starting point, law of nations."
2015.14-1175,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,542.985,543.37,Okay.
2015.14-1175,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,543.58,544.02,So --
2015.14-1175,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,544.02,550.645,So when did it change from comity to an obligation?
2015.14-1175,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,550.645,558.45,"Upon the framing of the Constitution, just as it did with respect to every other sovereign immunity principle."
2015.14-1175,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,573.17,594.285,"I would have thought you would answer that the obligation was an obligation of international law, that comity was an obligation of international law insofar as it extended to sovereign immunity of each State not being haled into the courts of another State."
2015.14-1175,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,595.89,596.13,Yeah.
2015.14-1175,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,608.165,610.48,"But two points are important, Justice Ginsburg."
2015.14-1175,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,638.76,660.935,"Well, Mr. Clement, haven't we now recognized that there is no automatic immunity for a sovereign nation, another nation? That -- the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act said, yeah, sometimes, sometimes we respect the sovereignty of that foreign nation, but sometimes we don't, like in commercial deals."
2015.14-1175,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,660.935,671.615,"Right, Justice Ginsburg, and I don't think that you want to resolve this case on the law of nations' immunity principles, either in 1789 or today."
2015.14-1175,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,705.27,724.365,"There is -- there is a certain irony, isn't there, that California is the State that gave us a Nevada against California, right? And California then was saying, oh, yes, we can sue the sovereign in Nevada in our courts if they come into our State and hurt our people."
2015.14-1175,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,731.285,738.81,"Well, I -- I think the FTB is asking you -- which is an arm of California -- is asking you to overrule Hall."
2015.14-1175,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,748.55,751.05,"Well, California has joined the amicus brief, has it not?"
2015.14-1175,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,751.05,754.2,"They didn't, but I think that's because they felt that an arm of State was --"
2015.14-1175,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,754.2,754.57,"Well, what's that --"
2015.14-1175,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,754.57,766.2,"-- already here, so I think, you know, that -- that that explains that. But I want to make one point very clear, which is this Court has a whole host of State sovereign immunity cases dealing with the Federal courts."
2015.14-1175,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,807.44,807.81,"Well, what do you --"
2015.14-1175,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,807.81,808.94,Everybody on this Court --
2015.14-1175,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,808.94,833.655,"Mr. Clement, what do you do with -- I mean, one time we had -- had this issue, and the argument that you're making was -- was made in -- in Alden, and the Court spent over two pages distinguishing Nevada v. Hall on that very point, that there -- when there are two sovereigns involved, then it's different."
2015.14-1175,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,833.655,840.94,"Oh, absolutely, and that's because Alden is the only case that involves sovereign immunity in the State sovereign immunity context."
2015.14-1175,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,857.33,868.945,"But in -- in -- in Hall it does say, we determine the Constitution did not reflect an agreement between States to respect the sovereign immunity of one another."
2015.14-1175,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,868.945,880.47,"Well, I think that's because -- I assume that comes from the part of Alden where Alden is dealing with Hall as a given, and it's saying that the result in Alden does not require the overruling of Hall."
2015.14-1175,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,933.9,937.39,"Well, they are not totally bizarre."
2015.14-1175,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,973.615,975.28,"Well, I don't think so, Justice Breyer."
2015.14-1175,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1017.1,1020.485,"Well, I'd like to get your response to the second part of this."
2015.14-1175,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1111.5,1112.05,"I think, Justice Breyer --"
2015.14-1175,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1112.05,1113.21,I'd love your view on that.
2015.14-1175,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1113.21,1126.4,"-- and I'm going to give you my best answer on that, which is ultimately loop back to Hall. So my best answer is the way to think about this is Nevada has said, we're going to apply Nevada law, not California law, and Hyatt I says that they can do that."
2015.14-1175,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1145.275,1145.6,Right.
2015.14-1175,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1145.6,1173.57,"Now, if -- rather, if Nevada did the exact same thing to a citizen of California in a damage cap that applied not to sovereigns but to citizens, I read my friend on page 52 of his brief to say that that would violent the Privileges and Immunities Clause of Article IV, that you couldn't just say, well, no, that's a benefit only for Nevada residents. So his position ultimately is the sovereign is worse off than the citizen, which can't be right. Now, I think there are two ways to respond to that complete anomaly."
2015.14-1175,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1216.425,1240.67,"Mr. Clement, I -- I assume, but maybe I'm wrong, that it -- it follows from your argument that a -- a State could not adopt the equivalent of the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act and make -- make other States suable in -- in their State courts for commercial activities."
2015.14-1175,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1240.67,1244.78,"Not -- not of its own force. I mean, I think one way of thinking about this is I don't think --"
2015.14-1175,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1244.78,1246.72,I don't know what you mean: Not of its own force.
2015.14-1175,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1246.72,1250.37,"Well, they -- they might be able to agree to that mutually as a waiver of their sovereign --"
2015.14-1175,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1250.37,1250.73,"No, no, no."
2015.14-1175,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1252.78,1253.23,Right.
2015.14-1175,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1253.23,1257.945,-- a State legislature enacting a statute that is the equivalent of the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act.
2015.14-1175,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1257.945,1258.17,Yes.
2015.14-1175,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1258.17,1268.03,"Any foreign State that is doing business, not just foreign country, foreign State that is doing business in this -- in this State can be sued if it's -- if it's --"
2015.14-1175,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1268.03,1268.23,Right.
2015.14-1175,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1270.98,1271.78,But -- but that does raise --
2015.14-1175,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1271.78,1282.595,"So that -- that creates something of an -- of an anomaly which is that foreign States can be sued, but -- but your sister State can't. That's a little strange, isn't it?"
2015.14-1175,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1282.595,1283.04,No.
2015.14-1175,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1327.58,1334.305,"But, Mr. Clement, Justice Scalia's question does suggest that there are sovereign interests on both sides of this."
2015.14-1175,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1384.945,1392.085,"Justice Kagan, I think there's two reasons that it is glaringly obvious that the States would have made exactly the choice I'm suggesting."
2015.14-1175,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1410.27,1425.4,"But it -- wasn't it -- didn't -- didn't Chief Justice John Marshall explain that, as to a foreign country, yes, there was a rule of comity, but it was not -- it was not binding."
2015.14-1175,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1438.13,1446.19,"Well, Justice Ginsburg, two points about that. First of all, here is what Chief Justice Marshall says about the amenability of the sovereign to sue."
2015.14-1175,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1465.35,1467.225,"He didn't put it in terms of raw power, did he?"
2015.14-1175,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1467.225,1470.86,"I -- I -- I think if you read the whole opinion, that's exactly what he's saying."
2015.14-1175,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1545.33,1556.25,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Farr."
2015.14-1175,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1556.25,1626.46,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Since much of the discussion this morning has turned on the possible overruling of Nevada v. Hall, I'd like to start, if I might, by setting out what I think are the two main reasons why Nevada v. Hall shouldn't be overruled. First of all, the Court in Nevada v. Hall, unlike the Board in its argument, took account of the fact that, after the formation of the Union, the States retained a great deal of their essential sovereign attributes, and that it was fundamentally inconsistent with those sovereign attributes for another State to declare itself immune as of right from its jurisdiction. The second reason is that the Board has failed to show that the ordinary political processes -- in particular an agreement among the 46 States, which are now represented before the Court, saying they all agree there should be absolute immunity in each other's courts -- why they can't reach that agreement and -- and have that effectively be the law going forward without the intervention of this Court and without the need for this Court --"
2015.14-1175,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1626.46,1628.935,"They would need the intervention of Congress, I assume, right?"
2015.14-1175,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1628.935,1630.17,"I'm sorry, Justice Scalia?"
2015.14-1175,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1630.17,1632.27,They would need the intervention of Congress.
2015.14-1175,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1632.27,1633.75,I do not believe they would need --
2015.14-1175,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1633.75,1634.24,Why wouldn't they?
2015.14-1175,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1634.24,1636.01,-- the intervention of Congress. Because this is not --
2015.14-1175,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1636.01,1640.39,I thought compacts between States always required approval by the Congress.
2015.14-1175,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1640.39,1642.5,"I -- I beg to differ, Justice Scalia."
2015.14-1175,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1645.505,1647.5,The Cuyler case.
2015.14-1175,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1647.5,1657.21,"That's correct, that -- that the question is whether an agreement among the States is an aggregation of State power at the expense of the Federal government."
2015.14-1175,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1682.54,1696.34,But that seems to me quite disruptive of the union that the Congress contemplates in that States would make different arrangements with each other.
2015.14-1175,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1703.745,1705.39,"Well, Justice Kennedy, there's always --"
2015.14-1175,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1705.39,1712.82,"For instance, California Franchise Tax Board has -- collects tax from people all over the -- all over the United States."
2015.14-1175,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1719.915,1726.11,"Well, you do have the 45 States supporting California in this case, making the total of 46."
2015.14-1175,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1730.7,1737.31,Do you say we're just going to throw the States back on themselves; all the States negotiate with each other? That's not part of our constitutional tradition at all.
2015.14-1175,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1737.31,1740.91,"Well, Justice Kennedy, I -- I guess I do disagree with that."
2015.14-1175,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1781.52,1781.93,If this --
2015.14-1175,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1781.93,1787.25,What is your first reason for saying keep -- keep Nevada?
2015.14-1175,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1787.25,1797.875,"The first reason, Justice Ginsburg, is that Nevada v. Hall recognized, in a way that the Board never does, that there are two sovereign interests at stake here."
2015.14-1175,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1810.42,1836.4,"Well, I think Mr. Clement says that there are two answers to that. One is that they actually never exercised that sovereign interest, so it didn't mean very much to them. And the other is that in exercising that sovereign interest, they would be violating norms of international law, so that they wouldn't have really thought that that was a significant and exercisable interest. But those are his two arguments against that."
2015.14-1175,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1836.4,1836.67,Right.
2015.14-1175,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1890.2,1900.465,"So if the -- if the States thought that they had retained this power, why have you not cited any cases in which this was exercised before Nevada v. Hall?"
2015.14-1175,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1900.465,1904.76,Because there basically are no cases where the power was exercised.
2015.14-1175,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1990.815,2007.39,"Mr. Farr, I'm concerned about -- about the Eleventh Amendment, which, of course, does not prevent a -- its words do not prevent a State from being sued in Federal court."
2015.14-1175,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2022.99,2024.37,It prompts --
2015.14-1175,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2024.37,2026.365,-- the -- the Eleventh Amendment.
2015.14-1175,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2026.365,2026.71,Uh-huh.
2015.14-1175,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2027.865,2069.02,"We -- we have held -- it was Hans which held that it's also citizens of the same State that cannot sue in Federal court, but that's not in the Eleventh Amendment. That rested upon -- this is what Justice Hughes said it rested upon, ""Manifestly, we cannot rest, we cannot assume that the letter of the Eleventh Amendment exhausts the restrictions upon suits against nonconsenting States. ""Behind the words of the constitutional provisions are postulates which limit and control. There is the essential postulate that"" -- ""that the controversies as contemplated shall be found to be of a justiciable character."
2015.14-1175,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,2105.66,2109.805,"I think the answer to that, Justice Scalia, is because the situations are very different."
2015.14-1175,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2205.895,2218.4,"The -- the assurances were based upon the postulate, the assumption, that no State, of course, can be haled into the -- into the courts of another sovereign without its consent."
2015.14-1175,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,2226.84,2231.475,"But, Justice Scalia, to be blunt about it, there is no such postulate."
2015.14-1175,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2297.47,2300.535,How do you explain Hans v. Louisiana?
2015.14-1175,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,2300.535,2305.415,Hans v. Louisiana is the second part of the triangle.
2015.14-1175,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2345.87,2360.63,"So Mr. Farr, Mr. Clement suggests that it's unthinkable that a State would be so concerned about being haled into Federal court but not just as concerned or even more so about being haled into suit of another State. What is the response to that?"
2015.14-1175,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,2360.63,2386.125,"The response to that is that -- that that argument just doesn't give proper weight to the balance of power and the difference in the balance of power between the Federal government and State governments and between the State governments horizontally. When you're -- to go back again to the formation, Justice Kagan, if -- if one is looking at the situation that the States were facing at that time, they're forming a new union."
2015.14-1175,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2434.68,2442.04,Why -- why do you say it was so -- so clearly established that a superior sovereign could not be sued in the courts of a lesser sovereign?
2015.14-1175,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,2442.04,2442.94,Because that would -- I'm sorry.
2015.14-1175,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2442.94,2449.7,"I -- I thought we invented that system of -- of two sovereigns, a superior sovereign and a -- and a lesser sovereign."
2015.14-1175,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,2456.23,2456.65,As I --
2015.14-1175,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2456.65,2459.715,-- as a superior sovereign you can't be sued in a State court?
2015.14-1175,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,2459.715,2464.72,"I think if one looks at English common law, you have stratifications in English common law."
2015.14-1175,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2465.265,2467.62,There are no sovereigns in England except the King.
2015.14-1175,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,2467.62,2471.52,"Well, the King was not answerable in lesser courts."
2015.14-1175,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2474.07,2474.885,That's a different point.
2015.14-1175,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,2474.885,2475.08,Okay.
2015.14-1175,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2475.94,2477.18,If -- if -- I don't want --
2015.14-1175,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,2477.18,2477.89,Pardon me.
2015.14-1175,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2478.785,2501.22,"Well, I -- I -- I just want you at some point to give three minutes -- I mean, I will accept for argument's sake that the great issue in Philadelphia in 1787 was a division of power between the Federal government and the States, not questions of what States could do in respect to each other."
2015.14-1175,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,2509.395,2510.25,That's correct.
2015.14-1175,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2510.66,2512.635,And therefore -- therefore --
2015.14-1175,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,2512.635,2513.11,Excuse me.
2015.14-1175,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2513.11,2516.61,-- we have two cases on it. We went through the whole thing.
2015.14-1175,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,2626.34,2641.71,"Well, I think that -- that the important part there is that the only Federal basis that they have really identified that conceivably could support this claim is the Full Faith and Credit Clause, because it is a Federal law."
2015.14-1175,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2642.995,2648.74,But the Full Faith and Credit Clause reinforced by it is the same policy there --
2015.14-1175,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,2648.74,2649.25,Well --
2015.14-1175,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2649.25,2651.24,-- that exists under the Commerce Clause too --
2015.14-1175,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,2651.24,2651.82,That's -- that's part of it.
2015.14-1175,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2651.82,2653.555,-- and the Privileges and Immunities Clause.
2015.14-1175,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,2653.555,2681.96,"That's -- that's the part I want to get to because, if one applies the Full Faith and Credit Clause -- remember, of course, the Court did this in Hyatt I and -- and rejected California's argument that its immunity law, giving absolute immunity, has to apply, and Nevada did not -- Nevada has to apply that. So the Court has already crossed that bridge, at least to some extent. Now, I agree with you at that point there was not a judgment, so there was no comparison of -- of the damages."
2015.14-1175,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2716.17,2722.695,"Nevada's law is great. Nevada's law says if you're a Nevada worker -- State, you get -- you don't have to pay a dime."
2015.14-1175,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,2724.22,2724.435,Right.
2015.14-1175,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2724.435,2731.15,"But if you're California or some other State, you have to pay 40 million."
2015.14-1175,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,2731.15,2731.76,No -- no.
2015.14-1175,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2744.85,2745.5,I understand that.
2015.14-1175,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,2747.73,2747.9,Well --
2015.14-1175,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2747.9,2751.535,-- in the Constitution or something else if I were to write the words that I suggested?
2015.14-1175,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,2751.535,2752.03,Because --
2015.14-1175,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2752.03,2759.555,"That once they go beyond their own immunities, they run out of steam and they have no reason for not following California's law."
2015.14-1175,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2759.555,2761.26,You don't think that's right.
2015.14-1175,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2762.65,2764.43,"I know he doesn't think it's right, and I want to have the reason."
2015.14-1175,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,2764.43,2808.55,"No, I don't think that's right. And -- and Justice Ginsburg, thank you, because I'd like to point out -- I think maybe by going step by step, I didn't get to the step I want to get to quickly enough. But the step that I want to get to is there is no requirement in the Full Faith and Credit Clause that goes on top of are you competent to legislate with respect to the torts at issue? In other words, when -- when a State says, we're going to apply our own law to a lawsuit that it is competent to legislate about, has legislative jurisdiction, it doesn't have to answer a second question that says, well, you -- if we're going to allow you to do that, can you show us a public policy of yours that would be offended by applying the law? But --"
2015.14-1175,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2808.55,2811.03,"Well, but it marriages in all kinds of things."
2015.14-1175,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,2824.16,2830.43,"But -- but I -- I want to draw a distinction between the constitutional test, which is are you competent to legislate."
2015.14-1175,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2846.585,2859.47,I'm not following -- I guess I'm not -- the -- the California law that is being given or that is argued to be given full faith and credit here is what? The California law on --
2015.14-1175,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,2859.47,2859.59,No.
2015.14-1175,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2859.59,2860.31,-- sovereign immunity?
2015.14-1175,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,2860.31,2864.95,"I -- I -- you -- you're -- you're well right to be confused, Justice Scalia, because --"
2015.14-1175,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2864.95,2870.24,All California says about sovereign immunity is you can't be -- we can't be sued in our courts.
2015.14-1175,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,2873.92,2874.445,Well --
2015.14-1175,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2874.445,2877.68,"And if they did, would they have the jurisdiction to say that? I don't know."
2015.14-1175,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,2877.68,2887.53,"I don't think -- well, because of what -- what the Court said in Hyatt I, they don't have the power to enforce their own immunity and their laws on another State if that --"
2015.14-1175,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2887.53,2891.36,"What's -- what's being given full faith and credit, then, under the argument here? What --"
2015.14-1175,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,2891.36,2906.57,"The original argument -- the fact is that the Board has changed its argument about full faith and credit, and that's why it's confusing. In its brief, originally, the Board said we're asking that Nevada apply California's law of immunity."
2015.14-1175,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3058.605,3073.765,"It's a little odd that the Nevada courts say comity as far as punitive damages is going -- we're not going to slap California with punitive damages, but no comity before -- above 50,000."
2015.14-1175,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,3073.765,3084.85,"Well, I think that -- its explanation of that actually makes quite good sense. They say, you know, when we're compensating our people, we're not just compensating. Compensation serves two purposes."
2015.14-1175,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3134.09,3144.52,"Well, you seem to be arguing that no matter how hostile one State is to another, there would be no requirement -- there would be no requirement for equal treatment."
2015.14-1175,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,3160.895,3162.42,"Well, first of all --"
2015.14-1175,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3162.42,3164.26,-- there would be no -- there would be no remedy for that.
2015.14-1175,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,3171.225,3174.59,"Well, I don't see why it isn't in the interest of both States."
2015.14-1175,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3226.65,3230.52,Except California has unlimited damages for its own people.
2015.14-1175,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,3230.52,3254.68,"But -- that's correct, Justice Ginsburg. But if you're looking at the relationships between the two States, which is what we're looking at here, and the question of how States treat each other, reciprocity actually is more important. It's no solace to Nevada to say, well, you had to pay unlimited damages in California, but they only have to pay $50,000 to your citizens because they have a different rule."
2015.14-1175,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3261.275,3272.585,"If -- if Nevada didn't want to give that California tax people the benefit of no punitive damages, that -- it could do that, right? It would be a matter of comity?"
2015.14-1175,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,3272.585,3275.39,"To be honest with you, I have my doubts about that."
2015.14-1175,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3356.82,3368.31,"And don't you think the -- before your time is up, to answer the argument based on Kiowa Tribe, that is, that Indian tribes are immune from suit by individuals in State courts."
2015.14-1175,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,3378.065,3380.63,"Well, let me just answer."
2015.14-1175,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3408.695,3409.68,"Thank you, counsel."
2015.14-1175,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,3409.68,3409.87,Thank you.
2015.14-1175,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3409.87,3411.745,"Mr. Clement, four minutes."
2015.14-1175,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,3411.745,3416.14,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Three basic points in rebuttal."
2015.14-1175,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3560.52,3560.69,Mr. --
2015.14-1175,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,3560.69,3566.255,So I tried to finish with some anomalies here because we've talked about a couple of them.
2015.14-1175,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3655.11,3656.06,"You know, can I just ask you to --"
2015.14-1175,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,3656.06,3656.325,Sure.
2015.14-1175,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3656.325,3661.38,On that last point -- I think this is a very hard case straight up.
2015.14-1175,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,3668.165,3672.87,"My special justification is workability, consistency with precedent."
2015.14-1175,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3684.34,0.0,"Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted."
