2018.17-1484,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.92,"We'll hear argument next in Case 17-1484, Azar versus Allina Health Services. Mr. Kneedler."
2018.17-1484,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,7.92,41.0,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Section 1395hh did not require CMS to go through notice-and-comment rulemaking before it could furnish its calculation of one component of a hospital's reimbursement to the contractors that perform the initial determination of reimbursement for the agency. That calculation was not binding on the agency, the courts, or Respondents, and it could be challenged on administrative appeal, as, in fact, Respondents did here."
2018.17-1484,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,41.0,44.88,I have a -- a sort of problem with this.
2018.17-1484,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,92.68,94.4,So several points.
2018.17-1484,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,94.4,95.52,A statement of policy.
2018.17-1484,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,95.52,97.2,"Several points, Justice Sotomayor."
2018.17-1484,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,117.04,133.56,"Well, that's what I'm -- that's what I'm having a problem with. It's every single provider is going to be given a fraction that incorporates your policy, and that binds what they're going to get."
2018.17-1484,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,133.56,134.2,"No, it -- it --"
2018.17-1484,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,134.2,138.8,Because they have to use that fraction in the claims they made against you.
2018.17-1484,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,138.8,141.88,It -- it only governs what the contractor does.
2018.17-1484,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,148.4,160.92,"From you -- from the contractor, from the agency, they're only going to get the fraction as you told the contractor to calculate it."
2018.17-1484,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,160.92,162.28,Only if they don't appeal.
2018.17-1484,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,164.32,193.12,"I -- I just don't understand what difference it means -- it means -- I mean, even a regulation or a rule may have legal meaning only until it's accepted, but even a rule can be challenged later on appeal. The grounds for that challenge might be different, but I can go into court and say it's ultra vires."
2018.17-1484,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,208.52,225.84,"Well, if I -- if I may, in our view, 1395hh codifies for the Medicare program what this Court referred to in Chrysler Corporation as the central distinction in the APA between substantive and interpretive rules. And this Court in Guernsey --"
2018.17-1484,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,225.84,233.44,"Well, the problem I have is that the provision adds something. It's not just rule or regulation; it's statement of policy."
2018.17-1484,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,252.44,257.84,"Well, again, several points -- several points about that."
2018.17-1484,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,277.08,277.56,"Mr. Kneedler, why didn't --"
2018.17-1484,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,277.56,278.84,-- and set aside on appeal.
2018.17-1484,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,278.84,286.56,-- why didn't Congress just say this is like the APA? Why does it change the language at all?
2018.17-1484,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,286.56,287.08,Well --
2018.17-1484,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,287.08,298.96,I have to give some meaning different than the APA to Congress's express choice of a different articulation of the standard.
2018.17-1484,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,298.96,311.92,"Well, first of all, when -- when Congress first enacted the provisions or amended the provisions in the rulemaking in 1986, it said certain regulations -- regulations have to go through notice and comment."
2018.17-1484,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,373.36,376.24,"Is -- is this right? I mean, I -- it's very complicated, what you're saying."
2018.17-1484,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,412.04,412.6,And that --
2018.17-1484,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,412.6,418.16,"And, basically, what they're doing is saying to the agency, don't run around this."
2018.17-1484,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,435.08,437.48,That -- that is exactly -- that is exactly our position.
2018.17-1484,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,437.6,441.0,So why didn't you say that was the answer to what Justice Sotomayor said? (Laughter.)
2018.17-1484,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,441.0,442.68,"Well, the problem I have with that --"
2018.17-1484,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,442.68,444.76,I -- I -- I tried to start down that path --
2018.17-1484,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,444.76,445.36,-- counsel --
2018.17-1484,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,445.36,445.68,-- but I -- but that --
2018.17-1484,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,445.68,447.24,-- but -- but let me -- let me stop you.
2018.17-1484,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,458.88,459.92,The House bill.
2018.17-1484,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,459.92,467.48,-- the House bill -- was leading them to believe that a different standard was necessary because they changed it.
2018.17-1484,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,488.56,489.08,It -- it --
2018.17-1484,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,489.08,502.6,"Because it tells me they are significantly concerned about things that make major changes, substantive changes in how people are being paid."
2018.17-1484,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,502.6,506.92,"And -- and here's -- here's what matters there, as -- as I pointed out."
2018.17-1484,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,561.76,575.8,"So the answer is that it didn't do what it's trying to do in 1986. What it talked about was any regulation, which could have included interpretive regulations. I would have found out, because I read the House reports."
2018.17-1484,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,600.72,600.96,Yes.
2018.17-1484,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,601.32,602.12,Am I right or not right?
2018.17-1484,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,602.12,603.08,"Yes, we agree."
2018.17-1484,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,629.16,632.04,"Mr. Kneedler, this is where I get stuck."
2018.17-1484,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,752.64,753.24,Okay.
2018.17-1484,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,808.64,815.48,"But then you would be using the word ""substantive"" in two different ways in two very nearby provisions, wouldn't you?"
2018.17-1484,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,815.48,820.8,"Well, but we -- but we think that they -- that they have a different effect."
2018.17-1484,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,856.2,886.2,"Mr. Kneedler, there's a lot of words there, but I'm not sure there's an answer to Justice Kagan's question. So I'm -- I'm going to give you an opportunity to try again, because it's very important to me as well. Aren't you using the word ""substantive"" in two different senses, first in the APA's -- what I call the APA sense in (a), and then what I'll call the other traditional legal sense in (e)? So you're conceding to your colleague on the other side that it is used in that sense at least in (e), I believe."
2018.17-1484,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,886.2,891.0,"Well, it -- it doesn't say substantive rule or substantive standard, which would be the --"
2018.17-1484,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,891.0,894.28,Substantive -- it says substantive change to an interpretive rule.
2018.17-1484,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,894.28,894.56,Right.
2018.17-1484,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,894.56,896.68,"Which is a nonsense under your view, I believe."
2018.17-1484,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,896.68,903.6,"But -- but substantive there, we -- we think in substance is whatever -- no, I'm -- I'm -- I'm serious, is what it refers to."
2018.17-1484,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,925.0,931.96,"Again, a lot of words, but I think at the end of the day you are agreeing that Congress is using that word in two different senses, right?"
2018.17-1484,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,931.96,947.4,"We -- we -- we think the phrase ""substantive change"" here is different from substantive legal standard, which is -- we think is the same as substantive -- as substantive rule. And, I'm sorry, I -- I forgot the third point you asked me."
2018.17-1484,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,947.4,950.28,"Statement of policy, because that's hanging me up too."
2018.17-1484,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,950.28,950.68,Okay.
2018.17-1484,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,973.6,974.48,This one does.
2018.17-1484,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,974.48,976.56,"-- interpretation, but it doesn't have the force of law."
2018.17-1484,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,976.56,979.88,So you're -- you're agreeing it's incoherent as written.
2018.17-1484,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,984.0,984.24,Well --
2018.17-1484,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,984.24,989.84,"As written, it's incoherent because a statement of policy is, by definition, not a substantive rule?"
2018.17-1484,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,989.84,1003.68,"Yes, but I think it -- I think it serves the purpose that Justice Breyer was identifying, basically saying we don't care what you call it, whether you call it a rule, whether you call it a requirement, whether you call it a statement of policy. A rule, after all, includes interpretive rules."
2018.17-1484,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1022.92,1023.8,What would be the --
2018.17-1484,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1023.8,1024.76,-- that it only covers --
2018.17-1484,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1024.76,1025.4,What would be the point --
2018.17-1484,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1025.4,1027.0,-- substantive legal standards.
2018.17-1484,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1027.0,1034.8,"What would be the point of that, though, if a statement of policy couldn't have operative legal effect on anyone anyway?"
2018.17-1484,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1034.8,1037.12,"Well, again, if -- if -- if that was the --"
2018.17-1484,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1037.12,1040.6,"I mean, a party would simply say that's just a statement of policy."
2018.17-1484,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1042.08,1051.84,"Well, but if -- but if it -- if it purports to, as the language the Court used in Chrysler, to establish a substantive legal standard, it's not just a statement of policy."
2018.17-1484,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1053.84,1058.32,"Well, then it's not a statement -- then the argument would be it's not a statement of policy, right?"
2018.17-1484,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1058.32,1060.48,"Right, that -- that -- that is true, but that -- but that --"
2018.17-1484,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1060.48,1060.92,Okay.
2018.17-1484,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1060.92,1065.6,-- that doesn't mean that -- that doesn't mean it's not -- it's not a statement of policy within the precise meaning of the APA.
2018.17-1484,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1065.6,1067.08,"Well, they don't want a run-around."
2018.17-1484,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1067.08,1067.36,Right.
2018.17-1484,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1067.36,1071.12,"But, (e), they don't run around it by calling it a statement of policy when you're --"
2018.17-1484,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1071.12,1071.24,Right.
2018.17-1484,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1071.24,1071.92,-- changing the substantive --
2018.17-1484,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1071.92,1072.56,"Yes, but it's at least --"
2018.17-1484,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1072.56,1101.92,"And -- and I have a different question, which is (e), which is because they are using the word ""substantive change"" there possibly in a different sense. So -- so -- so I -- I agree with that, and I -- but I thought that (e) has something to do that's not involved here. (e) is a kind of codification of a different common law rule of administrative law that, when you do something retroactively that's important, Mr. Agency, you better have a reason."
2018.17-1484,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1104.24,1104.4,Right.
2018.17-1484,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1104.4,1107.56,"If you're changing policy, go look at it and explain it to us."
2018.17-1484,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1107.56,1107.76,Right.
2018.17-1484,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1107.76,1110.36,"Something this Court has said many, many times."
2018.17-1484,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1110.36,1110.56,Right.
2018.17-1484,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1110.56,1112.2,And I thought that's what (e) is about.
2018.17-1484,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1112.2,1112.4,Yes.
2018.17-1484,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1112.4,1113.28,It's a different subject.
2018.17-1484,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1113.28,1115.2,That -- that is -- that's correct in our view.
2018.17-1484,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1138.84,1139.56,May -- may --
2018.17-1484,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1139.56,1151.04,And so it distinguishes right -- right in there the reg -- the sort of regulations that (a) is talking about and these -- these non-binding sorts of things that -- that either way they should be made retroactive.
2018.17-1484,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1158.44,1184.08,"May -- may I take you back, Mr. Kneedler, to one of Justice Sotomayor's original questions, which is just what, on your theory, this provision ends up actually accomplishing? Because, as I understand the 19 -- the 1986, the -- the prior year's provision, Congress essentially already said, for Medicare substantive rules, you have to go through notice and comment."
2018.17-1484,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1198.96,1202.68,"Well, again, the House would have done something broader in 1987."
2018.17-1484,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1205.8,1208.16,But are you saying -- I want to make sure I understand this.
2018.17-1484,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1214.0,1214.36,Yes.
2018.17-1484,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1236.36,1253.52,"I mean, it is a little bit odd, don't you agree, Mr. Kneedler, because, if the compromise was not to do anything beyond 1986, then you would think that people would just say, okay, let's not do it. Not put in a new -- a new -- a new statute saying precisely the same thing."
2018.17-1484,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1253.52,1260.64,"Well, the -- the bill was in conference -- in conference at that point, and there were several other things that were in the bill at that point."
2018.17-1484,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1274.6,1278.52,It's entirely superfluous?
2018.17-1484,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1278.52,1280.64,I -- I -- I don't think it's --
2018.17-1484,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1280.64,1281.08,It does nothing?
2018.17-1484,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1281.08,1282.52,"No, I don't think it's superfluous."
2018.17-1484,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1282.52,1283.4,It does nothing new?
2018.17-1484,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1283.4,1287.64,"Well, it -- it -- it substitutes -- it -- it elaborates -- it elaborates on --"
2018.17-1484,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1287.64,1290.76,But substantively -- sorry -- it does nothing new?
2018.17-1484,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1290.76,1294.2,"No, it -- it -- it reiterates through the use of such --"
2018.17-1484,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1294.2,1297.48,"It reiterates, okay. It reiterates what's already the law --"
2018.17-1484,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1297.48,1298.64,"Well, it was not -- it was not in the --"
2018.17-1484,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1298.64,1300.28,-- which is to say it is superfluous.
2018.17-1484,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1300.28,1302.92,It was not in the statute in 1986.
2018.17-1484,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1302.92,1303.44,Can I -- can I take you --
2018.17-1484,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1303.44,1304.72,The statute referred to regulation --
2018.17-1484,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1304.72,1315.28,Can I take you back just to one other problem I have? You want us to -- to -- to view this statute as very carefully using APA terminology when it comes to substantive.
2018.17-1484,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1332.64,1345.6,"No, I don't -- I don't think so because the -- the statement of policy is in the opening clause, which refers to rules, which could include interpretive rules, requirement, or statement of policy. Those are descriptions of the kind of agency issues --"
2018.17-1484,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1345.6,1348.6,But when is ever a statement of policy binding?
2018.17-1484,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1348.6,1349.12,Pardon me?
2018.17-1484,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1349.12,1358.68,"Meaning, when is a statement -- if it's not a rule or regulation, if it's just a statement of policy, when is it ever binding as you've defined ""binding""?"
2018.17-1484,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1358.68,1359.0,I --
2018.17-1484,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1359.0,1361.68,Isn't policy something that can be challenged?
2018.17-1484,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1361.68,1372.48,"It -- it -- it is, but I think it's important for the Court to focus on the -- on the operative language, which is whether it changes -- establishes or changes a substantive legal standard."
2018.17-1484,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1413.44,1423.48,"But I look at the subsequent history of this in -- in the D.C. Circuit, and I look at Clarian Health West, and your fears there are overstated."
2018.17-1484,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1449.92,1455.56,"Well, Clarian did not go to the substantive provisions for reimbursement."
2018.17-1484,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1459.4,1461.56,That's my point. That's my point.
2018.17-1484,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1461.56,1462.32,"Yes, but it --"
2018.17-1484,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1462.32,1463.88,Which is not everything is going to come under this.
2018.17-1484,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1463.88,1471.16,"It's not everything, but it -- but it -- but it certainly would subject to notice-and-comment rule -- rulemaking a broad swath of what has never been done."
2018.17-1484,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1471.28,1472.84,"Well, on that -- on that --"
2018.17-1484,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1472.84,1474.8,-- this is 30 years later in HHS --
2018.17-1484,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1474.8,1491.2,"-- on that -- on that, though, I don't doubt it's more convenient for the government to proceed through adjudication of an individual case and announce a new rule that applies to the whole of society without inviting comment and providing notice to everyone affected."
2018.17-1484,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1517.76,1525.72,"Well, first of all, the agency has tried to go through notice-and-comment rulemaking twice on this. It did -- it did it in 2004, when the issue was brought to its attention."
2018.17-1484,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1543.32,1549.92,"Could I very quickly ask you, given Clarian Health, what consequences are you afraid of?"
2018.17-1484,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1549.92,1557.24,"Afraid of, again, the broad swath of -- of manual provisions that -- I mean, that -- that really just dealt with procedures."
2018.17-1484,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1593.56,1605.12,"Thank you, Mr. Kneedler. Mr. Shah."
2018.17-1484,1,38316,pratik_shah,,1605.12,1627.04,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: By making the legal determination to count Part C days as Part A entitled days in the Medicare fraction, the agency's 2014 issuance reduced the payment right of hospitals nationwide by -- and this is according to the agency's own estimate -- billions of dollars. That is --"
2018.17-1484,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1627.04,1629.44,But it's not -- it's not binding at all.
2018.17-1484,1,38316,pratik_shah,,1629.44,1630.56,"Well, Your Honor --"
2018.17-1484,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1630.56,1632.0,Interim calculation.
2018.17-1484,1,38316,pratik_shah,,1632.0,1635.72,I -- I think it's binding in every normal sense of the word.
2018.17-1484,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1686.08,1692.36,"But doesn't it make sense if you've got -- I don't know exactly -- I mean, how many of these interim calculations do they have?"
2018.17-1484,1,38316,pratik_shah,,1692.36,1701.4,"Well, when you're talking about interim calculations for the DSH adjustment, there's only two calculations. There's the Medicaid -- Medicare fraction and the Medicaid fraction."
2018.17-1484,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1705.96,1706.32,I think in --
2018.17-1484,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1706.32,1717.28,"Well, but, I mean, how many every year or whatever the payment schedule is? My -- my understanding is they were using this to tell you how to calculate what you owe, but not until the, I don't know, the final bill comes in."
2018.17-1484,1,38316,pratik_shah,,1717.28,1717.84,"Oh, okay."
2018.17-1484,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1724.12,1724.28,Right.
2018.17-1484,1,38316,pratik_shah,,1724.28,1725.76,So this happens once a year.
2018.17-1484,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1782.92,1786.44,"Well, then they're wrong, because the SG is telling us that they do have that power."
2018.17-1484,1,38316,pratik_shah,,1786.44,1787.08,"Well, okay."
2018.17-1484,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1787.08,1793.44,"And so, therefore, your complaint is to go to a court and say they didn't do what they admit they were supposed to do --"
2018.17-1484,1,38316,pratik_shah,,1793.44,1794.44,"Well, Justice Breyer--"
2018.17-1484,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1794.44,1795.8,-- which is that they treat the substantive matter --
2018.17-1484,1,38316,pratik_shah,,1795.8,1802.0,"Justice Breyer, the government made that exact argument to the district court, and the district court found that the board was right."
2018.17-1484,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1802.28,1805.56,That's what both of these things seem to me to be somewhat side issues.
2018.17-1484,1,38316,pratik_shah,,1808.0,1808.32,Right.
2018.17-1484,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1808.32,1847.88,"And I accept that. But the basic problem to me is whether or not this statute, in using words like policy and so forth, is saying: Agency, when you have a legislative rule, which is defined as a rule that establishes or changes a legal -- substantive legal standard, when you have that kind of rule and don't hide it under a statement of policy or some other way, when it's doing that, use notice-and-comment. Now, if you aren't doing that, you can use notice-and-comment."
2018.17-1484,1,38316,pratik_shah,,1851.68,1851.84,Right.
2018.17-1484,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1851.84,1855.32,That has considerable importance even beyond this area.
2018.17-1484,1,38316,pratik_shah,,1858.4,1858.56,Sure.
2018.17-1484,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1884.6,1886.2,"Well, yes, you know that --"
2018.17-1484,1,38316,pratik_shah,,1886.2,1886.56,Yeah.
2018.17-1484,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1886.56,1892.56,"-- and I know that. But there are many, many people perhaps in the United States, and including many who work in agencies --"
2018.17-1484,1,38316,pratik_shah,,1892.56,1893.36,"Well, Your Honor, the --"
2018.17-1484,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1893.36,1894.08,-- who don't know that.
2018.17-1484,1,38316,pratik_shah,,1902.36,1903.32,Yes.
2018.17-1484,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1903.32,1908.92,-- then we arrive at the same conclusion that it already said it. But many people don't read House reports.
2018.17-1484,1,38316,pratik_shah,,1919.84,1920.12,Well --
2018.17-1484,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1920.12,1922.48,"And they show exactly what they mean, okay?"
2018.17-1484,1,38316,pratik_shah,,1922.48,1923.2,"Well, a --"
2018.17-1484,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1923.2,1925.0,That's the argument on the other side.
2018.17-1484,1,38316,pratik_shah,,1925.0,1933.76,"Well, a couple responses. If you want to ignore the text and look at the House report, I would suggest we look at the 1987 House report, which is the one that led to Section (a)(2)."
2018.17-1484,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2132.12,2135.32,"Could you give meaning to legal, substantive legal?"
2018.17-1484,1,38316,pratik_shah,,2135.32,2135.72,Sure.
2018.17-1484,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2136.64,2148.88,"Because that -- that's where the strongest argument, I think your adversary makes, which is generally we think of legal as binding. So, if you can deal with that, I think --"
2018.17-1484,1,38316,pratik_shah,,2148.88,2149.12,Sure.
2018.17-1484,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2149.12,2151.72,-- everything else you're saying falls into place.
2018.17-1484,1,38316,pratik_shah,,2151.72,2152.08,Sure.
2018.17-1484,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2277.28,2285.68,Do you have any other case that that might be when the conference report says we're reflecting recent cases? Is there anything else other than Bowen that you think it might be referring to?
2018.17-1484,1,38316,pratik_shah,,2285.68,2287.04,"That -- that's the -- I mean, we've looked."
2018.17-1484,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2348.56,2350.76,What about the practical --
2018.17-1484,1,38316,pratik_shah,,2350.76,2351.04,Yes.
2018.17-1484,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2351.04,2369.32,"-- the practical? And the reason is practical is relevant is you make a very coherent argument for one view that, at one time, the D.C. Circuit waffled between that a legislative rule was an important rule. And the other side of it is, no, it might or might not be."
2018.17-1484,1,38316,pratik_shah,,2433.12,2433.28,Right.
2018.17-1484,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2433.28,2435.16,-- but you see the practical problem.
2018.17-1484,1,38316,pratik_shah,,2435.16,2435.48,No.
2018.17-1484,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2435.76,2436.48,You don't see it or you --
2018.17-1484,1,38316,pratik_shah,,2436.48,2437.2,I do see your --
2018.17-1484,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2437.2,2438.4,That's why I want to know the answer.
2018.17-1484,1,38316,pratik_shah,,2438.4,2438.84,I see your concern.
2018.17-1484,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2438.84,2438.88,Yeah.
2018.17-1484,1,38316,pratik_shah,,2438.88,2441.16,But here is why your concern is misplaced here.
2018.17-1484,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2517.04,2530.8,"But does the statute apply only to provider manuals or does it provide, say, let's say, to 320 or 240 million Americans or 120 million Americans who get all kinds of things from Medicare?"
2018.17-1484,1,38316,pratik_shah,,2530.8,2531.44,"Well, Your Honor --"
2018.17-1484,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2531.44,2534.08,And perhaps thousands of hospitals and thousands of services.
2018.17-1484,1,38316,pratik_shah,,2539.6,2543.48,"Well, the problem that the government points to are these manuals."
2018.17-1484,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2544.28,2546.16,"No, and I'm pointing to a different problem."
2018.17-1484,1,38316,pratik_shah,,2546.16,2546.4,Okay.
2018.17-1484,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2546.4,2547.6,I'm pointing to a question --
2018.17-1484,1,38316,pratik_shah,,2547.6,2547.92,So here --
2018.17-1484,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2547.92,2550.16,-- of whether this is limited to provider manuals.
2018.17-1484,1,38316,pratik_shah,,2550.16,2563.92,"So here's -- here's -- well, it's limited to the terms of the statute. It has to be a rule, requirement, or statement of policy that changes or alters a substantive legal standard affecting one of the three categories of things."
2018.17-1484,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2564.04,2564.52,"Well, you explained away the --"
2018.17-1484,1,38316,pratik_shah,,2564.52,2565.92,A right to payment --
2018.17-1484,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2565.92,2569.68,"You -- you explained away the last 5,000 pages of the manual."
2018.17-1484,1,38316,pratik_shah,,2569.68,2569.92,Yes.
2018.17-1484,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2569.92,2571.64,But what about the first thousand? (Laughter.)
2018.17-1484,1,38316,pratik_shah,,2571.64,2571.96,Okay.
2018.17-1484,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2672.48,2674.68,"That's a prospective payment manual, but read this."
2018.17-1484,1,38316,pratik_shah,,2674.68,2675.36,This is not a manual.
2018.17-1484,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2675.36,2678.2,It says it governs the scope of benefits.
2018.17-1484,1,38316,pratik_shah,,2678.2,2678.48,Yes.
2018.17-1484,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2678.88,2680.68,Not just -- and the eligibility --
2018.17-1484,1,38316,pratik_shah,,2680.68,2681.32,Right.
2018.17-1484,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2681.32,2687.2,-- of individuals to furnish or receive services or benefits.
2018.17-1484,1,38316,pratik_shah,,2687.2,2687.36,Right.
2018.17-1484,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2687.36,2694.76,"So suddenly reading that, I think it governs medicine and healthcare provided 80 million people or 100 million people."
2018.17-1484,1,38316,pratik_shah,,2694.76,2694.96,Sure.
2018.17-1484,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2696.44,2698.28,Am I right or wrong?
2018.17-1484,1,38316,pratik_shah,,2698.28,2704.08,"First of all -- first, it would cover it if it falls under the terms of the statute, but here is why that doesn't create a workability problem."
2018.17-1484,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2773.72,2774.44,Do you have any idea --
2018.17-1484,1,38316,pratik_shah,,2774.44,2775.36,That doesn't implicate (a)(2).
2018.17-1484,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2775.36,2781.24,Do you have any idea why this change wasn't put through the ordinary rulemaking notice and --
2018.17-1484,1,38316,pratik_shah,,2781.24,2783.28,"Yes, Your Honor, because they tried."
2018.17-1484,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2788.36,2789.4,I've now forgotten.
2018.17-1484,1,38316,pratik_shah,,2790.76,2791.04,Right.
2018.17-1484,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2791.16,2792.48,I remember the 2013.
2018.17-1484,1,38316,pratik_shah,,2792.48,2792.96,Yes.
2018.17-1484,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2792.96,2794.12,But I don't remember the --
2018.17-1484,1,38316,pratik_shah,,2794.12,2794.24,Yes.
2018.17-1484,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2890.44,2897.16,"Well, I guess the way the government puts it is they decided not to proceed through rulemaking but to proceed through adjudication."
2018.17-1484,1,38316,pratik_shah,,2897.16,2902.28,"Well, Your Honor, as the D.C. Circuit said, this looks nothing like an adjudication."
2018.17-1484,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2916.48,2918.2,It's a big adjudication.
2018.17-1484,1,38316,pratik_shah,,2918.2,2953.76,"Well -- well, I think what distinguishes the adjudication from the rulemaking is, does it have general applicability? That's the definition in the APA. And this, as the D.C. Circuit said in its opinion, and the fact is the government's counsel in the D.C. Circuit oral argument conceded, when asked at oral argument, doesn't this policy have effect to every single hospital in the nation -- nationwide, and the answer is yes, it does. And not only that, it's prospective because these fractions are used, again, for every hospital nationwide to calculate their interim payments for the intervening year until the new fractions come out."
2018.17-1484,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2953.76,2954.4,"Well, but --"
2018.17-1484,1,38316,pratik_shah,,2954.4,2956.48,So this looks nothing like an adjudication.
2018.17-1484,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2956.48,2968.64,"-- if it is -- well, I guess, again, I mean, we can hear on rebuttal, but, I mean, it's an adjudication where they're doing what you'd like to see people do in adjudication, which is apply the same rules to similarly situated parties."
2018.17-1484,1,38316,pratik_shah,,2968.64,2968.88,Well --
2018.17-1484,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2968.88,2970.16,There just happens to be a lot of them.
2018.17-1484,1,38316,pratik_shah,,2970.16,2970.4,Right.
2018.17-1484,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3011.88,3016.52,So are -- you're saying this is not something that could have been done through adjudication?
2018.17-1484,1,38316,pratik_shah,,3016.52,3018.76,"Well, Your Honor, not in the way --"
2018.17-1484,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3018.76,3023.04,The -- the agency could not choose adjudication as a means of establishing this policy?
2018.17-1484,1,38316,pratik_shah,,3023.04,3027.16,Not as a means of establishing it nationwide for every hospital nationwide.
2018.17-1484,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3068.4,3072.84,"Thank you, counsel. Four minutes, Mr. Kneedler."

Subsection (e), by the way, was enacted at a later time, and so its text doesn't necessarily shed light on what Congress did in 1987. The term ""rule"" in the lead-in to subsection (a)(2) includes statements of policy."

In Chenery II, this Court did allow the government to engage in retroactive adjudications that affect substantive rights, but expected that it would be a rare thing that that would happen and that most of these kinds of actions would happen through rulemaking. This, of course, is the Court's -- the government's claiming the power to affect every Medicare provider in the country retroactively through these seriatim adjudications."

And the agency -- and this is the teaching of Vermont Yankee, the agency has to have the flexibility to choose."

2018.17-1484,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3283.76,3293.24,I thought in all the history I read that was motivating them is the agency's change of policy of doing less than a rulemaking.
