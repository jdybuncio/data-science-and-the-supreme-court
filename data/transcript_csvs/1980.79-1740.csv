1980.79-1740,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,9.972,We will hear arguments first this morning in Ball against James.
1980.79-1740,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,13.341,17.226,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1980.79-1740,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,373.983,376.785,There's nothing in the Constitution that says Arizona can't do what?
1980.79-1740,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,377.502,383.339,Cannot encourage private investment in water reclamation.
1980.79-1740,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,399.699,406.119,"And the principal way by which Arizona has done that is by making this a governmental entity, is that--"
1980.79-1740,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,406.119,418.246,"By making it a governmental... well, it makes it a governmental entity for the purpose of making its... for very limited purposes... and the very limited purpose, as the Arizona Supreme Court has said, is in order to allow it to carry out its economic objectives."
1980.79-1740,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,429.368,434.522,"--It had the power to condemn before this, didn't it?"
1980.79-1740,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,434.522,443.811,"By virtue of Arizona statutes, Justice Stewart, ARS, Section 121111, virtually any entity in the state of Arizona has the power to condemn."
1980.79-1740,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,443.811,454.102,"And Mr. Lee, does the state regulate the rates charged for electricity in any way, directly or indirectly?"
1980.79-1740,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,454.102,454.852,No.
1980.79-1740,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,479.567,484.704,"The state does regulate the electric rates of private utilities, doesn't it?"
1980.79-1740,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,484.704,486.054,"That is correct, that is correct."
1980.79-1740,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,486.054,493.091,"And under the existing legislation, could the state regulate the rates of this District?"
1980.79-1740,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,493.091,496.559,"There is some question about that, Justice Powell."
1980.79-1740,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,543.305,550.425,"Mr. Lee, I think you said earlier that whether or not it may regulate rates, there are other respects in which the state may regulate--"
1980.79-1740,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,550.425,550.775,Yes.
1980.79-1740,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,564.468,567.42,--Bonds are subject to periodic review in what sense?
1980.79-1740,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,567.42,572.472,--By the Arizona Corporation Commission which is the same entity which sets the rates for private corporations.
1980.79-1740,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,572.472,574.44,Is that the issuance or terms or what?
1980.79-1740,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,574.44,584.046,"The statute doesn't specify, in fact, it has been matters related to the bonds that have been reviewed by the Arizona Corporation Commission."
1980.79-1740,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,620.003,624.905,"To amend the state constitution, it has to be proposed by the legislature and then voted--"
1980.79-1740,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,624.905,629.792,"--That is correct, proposed by the legislature, but voted on by the people at the following election."
1980.79-1740,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,629.792,630.509,--And a simple majority--
1980.79-1740,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,630.509,635.561,"And a simply majority, in both instances, or it can be done by initiative."
1980.79-1740,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,635.561,637.429,--And then you are arguing that it's easy?
1980.79-1740,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,637.429,645.684,"Well, it is certainly, Justice Marshall, not the task that it has been to amend the United States... to amend the United States Constitution."
1980.79-1740,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,732.805,740.027,"Then Mr. Lee, what kind of governmental powers does the Project exercise now?"
1980.79-1740,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,740.027,746.248,The Supreme Court has said only those that are absolutely necessary to enable it to carry out its business purpose.
1980.79-1740,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,833.334,836.719,Salyer did not involve the generation of electricity?
1980.79-1740,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,836.719,838.386,"That is correct, that is correct."
1980.79-1740,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,841.904,842.19,Did not.
1980.79-1740,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,842.19,848.627,"And in our view, the only significance there is simply that that's the way that they make the money that makes the reclamation--"
1980.79-1740,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,848.627,853.997,And how many electric utility customers are there in this case?
1980.79-1740,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,853.997,858.965,"--There are over 300,000; there are about 320,000, I believe."
1980.79-1740,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,858.965,862.451,And how many beneficiaries of the... how many voters--
1980.79-1740,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,862.451,863.369,How many voters?
1980.79-1740,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,878.379,882.014,--How many people are voters?
1980.79-1740,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,882.014,888.268,"Well, I'm not certain that I know the answer to that question, but it would be more than--"
1980.79-1740,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,888.268,892.153,"Well how many, do you know how many votes... you must know how many votes were cast in the last election?"
1980.79-1740,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,892.153,892.786,--Yes.
1980.79-1740,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,901.775,903.458,Total number of people entitled to vote?
1980.79-1740,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,903.458,905.227,--Of the total eligible--
1980.79-1740,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,905.227,905.793,Voters?
1980.79-1740,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,905.793,906.71,--Of the total eligible voters.
1980.79-1740,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,911.647,917.901,Could you tell me what remedy the Ninth Circuit envisioned?
1980.79-1740,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,919.487,920.403,"No, I can't."
1980.79-1740,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,927.69,935.612,"--What were... well, I suppose I should ask your colleague, and I will... what remedy he had in mind?"
1980.79-1740,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,935.612,937.312,"--Well, I think I can answer that."
1980.79-1740,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,991.963,992.696,Excuse me.
1980.79-1740,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,997.95,1000.586,"--All but about 15 percent, Justice Stevens."
1980.79-1740,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1000.586,1001.369,About 15 percent.
1980.79-1740,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1002.754,1026.453,"The case is similar in this respect to the San Antonio School District case where the majority of this Court pointed out that what was really involved in that case more basically than equal protection, were matters of fiscal and economic policy, which lie within the responsibility and the expertise of state legislatures rather than this Court."
1980.79-1740,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1051.001,1058.405,Are you saying that under the Arizona constitution the legislature could forbid all nuclear power?
1980.79-1740,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1058.405,1059.257,"--Oh, I think so."
1980.79-1740,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1061.224,1063.559,They could do the same with fossil fuel?
1980.79-1740,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1063.559,1065.328,I think that is correct.
1980.79-1740,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1065.328,1077.302,"But you're not saying, I gather, Mr. Lee, that the Arizona legislature could transfer the voting power from the landowners to the electrical consumers are you?"
1980.79-1740,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1077.302,1080.004,"I'm not sure, Justice Brennan."
1980.79-1740,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1102.417,1111.123,"I'm a little puzzled, frankly, and perhaps I have the same difficulty Justice White does, don't we necessarily have to know what the class is that's entitled to equal treatment?"
1980.79-1740,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1112.825,1113.625,That is correct.
1980.79-1740,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1113.625,1131.852,"And some way... if your opponent is right, all members of whatever class it is are entitled to equal right to vote, whether they are all consumers or all residents or all property owners; don't we have to know what the theory of the violation is and won't that dictate the remedy?"
1980.79-1740,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1131.852,1136.588,"I've been searching for the theory of the violation in this case for some time, Justice Stevens, and I hope that Mr. Meyerson will respond to that."
1980.79-1740,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1174.63,1186.087,"Well Mr. Lee, we are reviewing a judgment for the Ninth Circuit, not some plaintiff's views, what do you think the violation was the Ninth Circuit found?"
1980.79-1740,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1186.087,1186.853,Well--
1980.79-1740,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1186.853,1189.453,"How did it, you can read its opinion."
1980.79-1740,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1190.388,1208.182,"--I think that what the Ninth Circuit said was exactly what the Plaintiffs are saying, as I understand them, that because of the changes in size that the District has taken on a different kind of function that has made it something like a city."
1980.79-1740,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1213.284,1215.786,Well wasn't it any more specific than that?
1980.79-1740,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1215.786,1225.092,"--What it said is, that these functions have acquired an independent significance of their own, and I have to read it... I have to read that into that... I am not--"
1980.79-1740,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1225.092,1226.411,What functions?
1980.79-1740,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1229.696,1231.296,"--Yes, yes sir."
1980.79-1740,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1331.523,1341.314,"Well I take it then, your argument really is a functional one and you don't rely on the fact that the landowners have special burdens to any great extent?"
1980.79-1740,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1341.314,1341.864,To--
1980.79-1740,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1341.864,1345.3,You'd be making the same argument if there were no lien on their property?
1980.79-1740,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1345.3,1346.016,--That is correct.
1980.79-1740,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1349.685,1351.537,"Which there won't be one of these days, right?"
1980.79-1740,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1351.537,1351.987,"Well, I'm not certain."
1980.79-1740,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1376.852,1387.124,I would... you certainly wouldn't argue that the development of water or flood control wouldn't be a proper governmental function?
1980.79-1740,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1387.124,1387.96,--Of course not.
1980.79-1740,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1388.943,1401.167,"And perhaps in effect, do you think the Ninth Circuit is saying that in a state like Arizona that necessarily is a governmental operation so important to everyone that everybody... ought to vote on it or something?"
1980.79-1740,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1401.167,1403.95,Possibly that is what the Ninth Circuit is saying.
1980.79-1740,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1403.95,1407.587,"And that's in conflict with what the State Supreme Court has said, is it not?"
1980.79-1740,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1407.587,1430.284,"That is concurrent with what the State Supreme Court has said and I believe that it's in conflict with the thrust of what this Court necessarily held in Salyer; that you look to function... and that water conservation... we're not engaged in flood control, the only reason that we're engaged in electric service is just to make more effective the flood control and the Arizona Supreme Court has also held that... and--"
1980.79-1740,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1430.284,1437.888,Well certainly no one suggests that power generation is... exclusively a public function?
1980.79-1740,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1437.888,1442.223,"--Indeed, this Court held squarely the contrary in Jackson v. Metropolitan Edison."
1980.79-1740,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1442.223,1449.46,"Mr. Lee, your argument so far is that... most of your time is gone... has emphasized the limited purpose requirement of Salyer."
1980.79-1740,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1451.512,1452.429,Thank you Justice Brennan.
1980.79-1740,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1467.189,1469.422,"--Before you get into it, may I just ask one question?"
1980.79-1740,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1469.422,1470.141,--Yes.
1980.79-1740,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1470.141,1475.459,I gather there's about two billion dollars of these general... bonds--
1980.79-1740,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1475.459,1476.795,"Of the total obligations, yes."
1980.79-1740,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1476.795,1477.245,--Yes.
1980.79-1740,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1480.113,1481.363,"In general obligations,--"
1980.79-1740,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1481.363,1487.852,"--Well, now, may there be a default merely by a change in the voting constituency?"
1980.79-1740,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1487.852,1488.685,--I don't know.
1980.79-1740,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1489.568,1493.922,"I mean, is there a covenant in the bonds which a default--"
1980.79-1740,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1493.922,1494.922,"--No, there would not be."
1980.79-1740,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1494.922,1504.878,"--Well, and I gather there are covenants which require the proceeds of the electrical service to be applied in the payment of the general obligation."
1980.79-1740,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1512.634,1522.423,"I think those general obligation bonds are pretty secure and I doubt that there would be a default in, virtually in any... because the lands are very secure."
1980.79-1740,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1522.423,1524.442,--Which would trigger any lien on the land?
1980.79-1740,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1524.442,1525.175,That is correct.
1980.79-1740,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1593.535,1604.741,"Of course, the District is permitted to exercise one of their prerogatives of the sovereign, namely, to have its obligations be tax free?"
1980.79-1740,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1604.741,1605.727,--That is correct.
1980.79-1740,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1616.634,1620.336,Mr. Meyerson.
1980.79-1740,1,17853,bruce_e_meyerson,,1620.336,1624.138,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1980.79-1740,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1666.315,1670.702,"Well, cases of this kind, that's kind of begging the question, isn't it?"
1980.79-1740,1,17853,bruce_e_meyerson,,1682.091,1683.46,"That's right, Your Honor--"
1980.79-1740,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1683.46,1686.895,Isn't the issue here whether this is an entity of government?
1980.79-1740,1,17853,bruce_e_meyerson,,1686.895,1692.048,"--Well this of course is an entity of government, because it is a political subdivision of the state of Arizona, Your Honor."
1980.79-1740,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1696.267,1706.042,Was the Salyer case decided on the ground that the entity there was so like a business that the rule of Reynolds v. Sims was inapplicable?
1980.79-1740,1,17853,bruce_e_meyerson,,1707.692,1714.612,"--No, Justice Stewart, I think the rationale of Salyer was the Court accepted the fact that there was state action because there was a political subdivision--"
1980.79-1740,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1714.612,1721.1,"It wasn't at all based on the proposition that the entity there was so like a business, was it?"
1980.79-1740,1,17853,bruce_e_meyerson,,1721.1,1722.535,--Well if the Court--
1980.79-1740,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1722.535,1723.885,"I haven't read it recently, but I--"
1980.79-1740,1,17853,bruce_e_meyerson,,1723.885,1734.943,--I think the Court first concluded that because no general public services were provided and because there was a disproportionate effect on landowners--
1980.79-1740,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1734.943,1735.326,--Right.
1980.79-1740,1,17853,bruce_e_meyerson,,1735.326,1742.263,"--A rational basis test should be used to evaluate the acreage voting system, rather than the compelling interest standard."
1980.79-1740,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1770.032,1788.81,"Well Mr. Meyerson, what if the District did not generate electricity, but simply engaged in flood control activities under authorization from the Arizona legislature and the... it could levy unpaid assessments for that purpose."
1980.79-1740,1,17853,bruce_e_meyerson,,1792.695,1816.895,"Justice Rehnquist, I would, because we're not in 1903 and we're not in 1937; this is 1981, where the Arizona legislature has recognized that ground water depletion is a state wide and local crisis in the Phoenix area where there are flood control problems, where this is the District that controls the water supplies for a metropolitan area of 1.5 million people."
1980.79-1740,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1829.887,1831.087,How many people were involved in Salyer?
1980.79-1740,1,17853,bruce_e_meyerson,,1831.087,1835.124,"There were only 77 people involved, Justice Marshall, in the Salyer case."
1980.79-1740,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1849.718,1850.834,And which class?
1980.79-1740,1,17853,bruce_e_meyerson,,1855.622,1863.459,"--The class of... Justice Stewart, the class of residents of the District who own no property or only own fractional acres of property."
1980.79-1740,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1863.459,1867.512,Not those residents who are users of electricity or water?
1980.79-1740,1,17853,bruce_e_meyerson,,1867.512,1868.229,That's correct.
1980.79-1740,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1868.229,1872.897,"But all residents of the geographical boundaries of the District otherwise qualified to vote, correct?"
1980.79-1740,1,17853,bruce_e_meyerson,,1872.897,1873.699,That is correct.
1980.79-1740,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1875.133,1878.601,"But then, Mr. Meyerson, why does the case have to go back to the state legislature?"
1980.79-1740,1,17853,bruce_e_meyerson,,1883.653,1887.541,"Justice Stevens, I think that that could well be the ultimate outcome, but--"
1980.79-1740,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1887.541,1888.841,"Not could well be, it must be."
1980.79-1740,1,17853,bruce_e_meyerson,,1888.841,1894.361,"--It must be, except the Arizona legislature would have discretion, perhaps, to adopt an appointed board."
1980.79-1740,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1904.653,1913.509,Would it be constitutional for the government to appoint a committee of landowners to select the board of directors?
1980.79-1740,1,17853,bruce_e_meyerson,,1913.509,1923.965,"--I think this Court has held that when the state adopts an appointive system of government within the general terms, the states are free to do what they will--"
1980.79-1740,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1923.965,1928.518,"And the governor could delegate that power to precisely the same people who are now the electors, I suppose?"
1980.79-1740,1,17853,bruce_e_meyerson,,1928.518,1931.47,--That would be a realm of discretion left to the legislature.
1980.79-1740,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1931.47,1933.07,You'd have a Pyrrhic victory if he did that.
1980.79-1740,1,17853,bruce_e_meyerson,,1933.07,1935.022,"Well, I hope that would not happen."
1980.79-1740,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1947.746,1949.182,But is it just a matter of labels?
1980.79-1740,1,17853,bruce_e_meyerson,,1955.852,1958.304,Well... I think that this Court--
1980.79-1740,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1958.304,1963.941,And it would seem to me that you've conceded that the state constitutionally could have precisely the same people do the selecting.
1980.79-1740,1,17853,bruce_e_meyerson,,1963.941,1980.734,"--Well the state constitutionally can appoint a dentist to the dental board, it can appoint a cosmetologist to the cosmetology board; when we are engaged in the appointive process there is more lee way given to the state than we are... then we have in the electoral process."
1980.79-1740,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1991.859,1996.077,"And here, Arizona has decided this is not that kind of a situation."
1980.79-1740,1,17853,bruce_e_meyerson,,2004.164,2006.88,--Well I think it is quite different.
1980.79-1740,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2043.689,2065.303,"What about agricultural cooperatives that are, say, furnishing a great share of the food for the people of the city and... they have elections, they run their own business, set their own prices,... a rather vital function to be furnishing food, people have to eat."
1980.79-1740,1,17853,bruce_e_meyerson,,2071.139,2072.058,--No.
1980.79-1740,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2077.61,2091.12,"Well isn't it your theory that... and the theory of the Court of Appeals that the furnishing, the development of water and its control is so important that it should be considered a governmental function?"
1980.79-1740,1,17853,bruce_e_meyerson,,2091.12,2093.303,"Justice White, I don't think that was the holding of the Court of Appeals?"
1980.79-1740,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2093.303,2094.822,Well what's your position?
1980.79-1740,1,17853,bruce_e_meyerson,,2094.822,2100.142,"I think that in Arizona is an essential and important function, but I don't think that's the legally determinative--"
1980.79-1740,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2100.142,2101.159,"What is it, then?"
1980.79-1740,1,17853,bruce_e_meyerson,,2101.159,2117.618,"--The legally determinative factors in this case, Your Honor, I think are that this is a political subdivision created by the state of Arizona, and that it's given powers and authority that substantially affect people in important ways, by providing essential electric and water services."
1980.79-1740,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2117.618,2122.905,"Well how much different is that than what I said, except for the fact you've added that it is a public entity?"
1980.79-1740,1,17853,bruce_e_meyerson,,2122.905,2125.607,I think that's a major distinction in the American system--
1980.79-1740,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2125.607,2132.697,"Well... so, but you don't say every public entity that's doing anything is subject to your rule?"
1980.79-1740,1,17853,bruce_e_meyerson,,2132.697,2133.513,"--That's right, Justice White--"
1980.79-1740,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2133.513,2139.701,So it's a public entity that's really engaged in a function that is important enough to all the people?
1980.79-1740,1,17853,bruce_e_meyerson,,2139.701,2140.667,--Of course.
1980.79-1740,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2142.403,2154.11,"Well isn't there another relevant, Mr. Meyerson, in your... in your submission, and that is that the state has set up a method of election for the people who are going to run the public entity?"
1980.79-1740,1,17853,bruce_e_meyerson,,2154.11,2155.16,--That's exactly right.
1980.79-1740,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2155.16,2159.764,"And you say that when that's done, it's got to be on a one man one vote basis?"
1980.79-1740,1,17853,bruce_e_meyerson,,2159.764,2160.18,"That's right,--"
1980.79-1740,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2160.18,2162.863,Unless it falls within the Salyer exception?
1980.79-1740,1,17853,bruce_e_meyerson,,2162.863,2163.215,--That's right.
1980.79-1740,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2167.267,2173.854,"But it's very important, is it not, to your submission, that the state has set up a system of election?"
1980.79-1740,1,17853,bruce_e_meyerson,,2173.854,2177.822,That is critical to our case; that the state has adopted an election process.
1980.79-1740,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2181.274,2181.758,Excuse me.
1980.79-1740,1,17853,bruce_e_meyerson,,2200.837,2223.018,"Mr. Chief Justice Burger, I think this Court has given some higher consideration to municipal type functions such as electric and water activities in the Cipriano case, because there, in a municipal bond election this Court held that you could not restrict voting to property owners because the activity of the municipal utility affected all citizens."
1980.79-1740,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2247.652,2253.137,So you wouldn't be taking this position if the District didn't sell water to the city?
1980.79-1740,1,17853,bruce_e_meyerson,,2253.137,2262.412,"If all the District water was used solely for agricultural purposes, that would have an effect on the merits of our case."
1980.79-1740,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2262.412,2266.614,Well does it affect... how much of an effect?
1980.79-1740,1,17853,bruce_e_meyerson,,2266.614,2285.258,"I don't think it would have the effect that it would result... that it would change the outcome, Your Honor, because here the District finances all of its activities primarily through electric sales, and the electric activities have a significant impact on the entire lifestyle and economic livelihood of the Phoenix metropolitan area."
1980.79-1740,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2286.841,2295.031,Are you suggesting that the furnishing of electric power is inherently or primarily a governmental function?
1980.79-1740,1,17853,bruce_e_meyerson,,2295.031,2297.481,"--No, I'm not suggesting that, Chief Justice Burger, at all."
1980.79-1740,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2328.618,2335.939,What would you say about a drainage district in Florida that's purpose was to drain the land rather than to bring water to it?
1980.79-1740,1,17853,bruce_e_meyerson,,2338.558,2358.771,"Justice Rehnquist, I think we'd have to examine whether or not those drainage activities had the type of far reaching effect that that this Court singled out in Salyer, that is, whether it would be a general public service and perhaps it would not be in your example... but then we'd have to look at whether its activities disproportionately affected the landowners as a class."
1980.79-1740,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2407.804,2415.041,"I suppose the... that holding of the Arizona law has been in connection with tort liability, sovereign immunity, hasn't it?"
1980.79-1740,1,17853,bruce_e_meyerson,,2415.041,2415.858,"That's right, Justice Stewart."
1980.79-1740,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2420.112,2421.028,Entirely different context.
1980.79-1740,1,17853,bruce_e_meyerson,,2421.028,2422.047,--It's a different context.
1980.79-1740,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2455.184,2461.872,Does the District have the power to impose general taxes or just real estate taxes?
1980.79-1740,1,17853,bruce_e_meyerson,,2461.872,2463.705,"It is an acreage tax, Justice Stevens."
1980.79-1740,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2463.705,2464.555,So it would have to be in acres?
1980.79-1740,1,17853,bruce_e_meyerson,,2464.555,2466.34,That's right.
1980.79-1740,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2566.69,2568.273,"Excuse me, Mr. Meyerson."
1980.79-1740,1,17853,bruce_e_meyerson,,2580.697,2582.715,"That's right, Justice Brennan."
1980.79-1740,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2582.715,2588.117,"And some of that money, I gather, are the proceeds of electric generation, is it not?"
1980.79-1740,1,17853,bruce_e_meyerson,,2588.117,2588.619,That's right.
1980.79-1740,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2588.619,2612.234,"Now suppose you had an expanded voting scheme, which, as you suggest, would take in all of the non landowners in the District, could they then take that money now used on irrigation projects and lower electric utility rates?"
1980.79-1740,1,17853,bruce_e_meyerson,,2612.234,2616.786,"Justice Brennan, I think that today's... day of inflation, lower rates are probably not in the horizon, but--"
1980.79-1740,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2616.786,2617.636,"I know, but could it--"
1980.79-1740,1,17853,bruce_e_meyerson,,2617.636,2627.577,"--It could, but I'd like to emphasize that in paragraph 60 of the stipulation of facts we agreed that the precise amount of the subsidy is not fixed."
1980.79-1740,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2636.183,2643.27,"--Yes, but they now because of their voting power, don't they now control the allocation?"
1980.79-1740,1,17853,bruce_e_meyerson,,2643.27,2643.904,"--That's right, they--"
1980.79-1740,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2643.904,2645.039,"They do, in fact."
1980.79-1740,1,17853,bruce_e_meyerson,,2645.039,2646.039,--And they do in fact.
1980.79-1740,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2646.039,2658.38,"And if they... if there were a new board elected by a district wide constituency, I take it they would say well we won't give that much to water irrigation, rather we'll reduce electrical rates."
1980.79-1740,1,17853,bruce_e_meyerson,,2658.38,2670.77,"They might do that, Justice Brennan, but I'd like to emphasize that this Court has said, time after time, in the Carrington v. Rash case, and in the Evans v. Cornman case, that the mere fact that one group may vote the way the people who are--"
1980.79-1740,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2670.77,2679.809,"Well, I'm sure you recognize what I'm getting at is the second element, the disproportionate impact element of Salyer, whether or not that is satisfied."
1980.79-1740,1,17853,bruce_e_meyerson,,2679.809,2680.476,--Well Justice Brennan.
1980.79-1740,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2805.805,2807.74,Is proxy voting permitted?
1980.79-1740,1,17853,bruce_e_meyerson,,2807.74,2816.846,"I don't believe it is, Justice White You simply have to be a qualified elector in the state of Arizona--"
1980.79-1740,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2816.846,2823.182,"Do you know if... in those elections where you say 400 to 600 people did the voting, how many acres were voted, do you know?"
1980.79-1740,1,17853,bruce_e_meyerson,,2823.182,2824.816,--I can tell you very quickly.
1980.79-1740,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2824.816,2826.718,"Well, if it's in the stipulation--"
1980.79-1740,1,17853,bruce_e_meyerson,,2826.718,2845.446,"In 1970, 621 voters voted 19,000 acres; 1974, 900 voters voted 43,000 acres... that was 1972, excuse me, and in 1974, 561 voters voted 15,000 acres."
1980.79-1740,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2845.446,2848.048,--Do they vote at regular polling places?
1980.79-1740,1,17853,bruce_e_meyerson,,2848.048,2850.5,"They are not regular polling places, Justice Brennan."
1980.79-1740,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2853.636,2858.09,"And so, that's just a tiny fraction of the eligible acres?"
1980.79-1740,1,17853,bruce_e_meyerson,,2858.09,2859.006,That's right.
1980.79-1740,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2860.09,2864.493,And how many... do you know how many eligible people there are to vote?
1980.79-1740,1,17853,bruce_e_meyerson,,2864.493,2865.409,--In our stipulation--
1980.79-1740,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2865.409,2866.861,How many people are landowners?
1980.79-1740,1,17853,bruce_e_meyerson,,2866.861,2873.782,"--In our stipulation, there were 359,000 property owners in the District."
1980.79-1740,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2874.249,2876.917,Who all... who would be eligible to vote?
1980.79-1740,1,17853,bruce_e_meyerson,,2876.917,2895.713,"--Who would be eligible to vote, but of course, most of them would be homeowners who would be voting fractional votes, out of that... we are never able to identify the number of one acre votes and above... but those 359,000 I would suspect, are primarily homeowners who are the people who own one quarter and one eighth, one sixteenth of a vote."
1980.79-1740,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2895.713,2904.734,Well doesn't the District notify the members of when and where the election is going to be held?
1980.79-1740,1,17853,bruce_e_meyerson,,2904.734,2927.5,"Justice Rehnquist, in recent years they have placed ads in the paper and I believe bill stuffers go out in the electric bills, but frankly as you can see from the history of the voting pattern, when you ask people to vote an eighth of a vote or a sixteenth of a vote, that is so antithetical to democratic processes, that people just don't go out and do that."
1980.79-1740,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2946.147,2955.503,Do you know how many landowners there are who... who could make up... who would own a majority of the acres?
1980.79-1740,1,17853,bruce_e_meyerson,,2955.503,2959.055,"--I'm sorry, Justice White, I really don't know that."
1980.79-1740,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2973.981,2986.888,"It's rather strange if a very few people could vote a majority of the land, it's very strange that a majority of the eligible land has never been voted, apparently?"
1980.79-1740,1,17853,bruce_e_meyerson,,2991.192,3006.619,"Justice White, I'm afraid that what has happened over the years is that because people with very large land holding... holdings have been able to control this entity by casting relatively few individual votes; that has so discouraged--"
1980.79-1740,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3006.619,3016.825,"Yes, but if a few landowners... if a few very large landowners, not very many, could cast more than 19,000 acres, could vote more--"
1980.79-1740,1,17853,bruce_e_meyerson,,3016.825,3020.293,"--Well now, over 50 percent of the land is urbanized."
1980.79-1740,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3029.132,3040.254,"--Well then, let's suppose that every landowner in the District owned only one... less than an acre."
1980.79-1740,1,17853,bruce_e_meyerson,,3045.992,3050.311,I guess theoretically that might work.
1980.79-1740,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3050.311,3051.328,"Theoretically, yes."
1980.79-1740,1,17853,bruce_e_meyerson,,3051.328,3053.013,"But, that hasn't happened and that isn't the case."
1980.79-1740,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3053.013,3066.571,"Well I don't know, if you can't tell us how many people are around in this District who own large acres of land, one of your fundamental complaints is that just a few people can run this District?"
1980.79-1740,1,17853,bruce_e_meyerson,,3066.571,3072.225,It's one of our fundamental practical complaints; it's not one of our fundamental legal complaints.
1980.79-1740,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3087.835,3100.394,"But don't you say the tendency is in the opposite direction,... more and more subdivisions so that there will be more and more one acre votes and less and less large landowner votes."
