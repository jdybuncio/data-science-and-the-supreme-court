1971.71-119,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,48.399,"The arguments next in 119, Trbovich against United Mine Workers."
1971.71-119,0,32532,joseph_l_rauh_jr,,50.187,54.806,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the court.
1971.71-119,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,404.541,405.986,This isn’t a jury trial isn’t?
1971.71-119,0,32532,joseph_l_rauh_jr,,405.986,408.604,"No sir, it's in front of Judge Brian."
1971.71-119,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,408.604,410.787,"You said, you want to add two more--"
1971.71-119,0,32532,joseph_l_rauh_jr,,410.787,412.667,Two issues sir.
1971.71-119,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1567.115,1571.589,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the court."
1971.71-119,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1771.039,1773.011,Can I ask you Mr. Solicitor?
1971.71-119,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1779.457,1793.085,"No Mr. Justice, I'm understand that he is going ahead on the basis of his decision and the decision of the Court of Appeals should the case come to a conclusion before you decide it, I don't know what would happen."
1971.71-119,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1804.427,1811.428,"I gather Mr. Rauh once more than just to present that material, he wants to fight on the side of the secretary."
1971.71-119,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1811.428,1822.724,"Yes, he wants to, I assume, but he would I suppose be entitled to recall witnesses for cross examination and other items of that kind."
1971.71-119,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1832.816,1834.333,There was no jury involved.
1971.71-119,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1834.333,1848.98,"Certainly, no jury involved, and certainly if the court's decision is adverse to our position, the secretary will cooperate and trying to put the court's decision into practical effect."
1971.71-119,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2010.044,2018.83,"Do you also agree with Mr. Rauh that, that preempts any state actions?"
1971.71-119,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2018.83,2024.02,"As to a suit after the election, yes Mr. Justice."
1971.71-119,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2394.839,2401.25,"And I gather Mr. Solicitor, does that position take you to the point however inadequate?"
1971.71-119,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2404.955,2414.729,Mr. Justice there is always of course the situation of no good faith of complete walking away and not meeting your responsibility.
1971.71-119,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2414.729,2432.311,"Well, I wasn't thinking so much of that is, in this case Mr. Rauh urges on us that there are two question, two issues that that side thinks ought to be submitted and litigated, and that I gather are not to be."
1971.71-119,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2432.311,2434.455,"Yes, Mr. Justice."
1971.71-119,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2434.455,2443.035,And you have agreed with him that the last sentence for 403 precludes their seeking a remedy anywhere else with respect to this election.
1971.71-119,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2443.035,2449.544,"Anywhere, no Mr. Justice, we do not and I think that's important."
1971.71-119,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2512.952,2518.161,Were these two issues that they want litigated in this action?
1971.71-119,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2521.348,2536.476,"They are addressed to setting aside the past election, but the secretary having made investigation has decided that these are not grounds upon which he thinks it appropriate to proceed, and our position is that the Congress has made him the exclusive judge of that."
1971.71-119,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2536.476,2538.547,That's what I was trying to get to.
1971.71-119,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2546.046,2549.021,"As to the past election, I would agree."
1971.71-119,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2549.021,2560.072,"Doesn't that suggest that there is at least a question under the last sentence of 24, unless the applicant's interest is adequately represented by existing court?"
1971.71-119,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2560.072,2563.696,"Well, that – you meant under Rule 24 with respect to --"
1971.71-119,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2563.696,2564.558,I might rule --
1971.71-119,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2564.558,2594.67,"And that -- my answer to that would be impart that Congress has allocated the determination of this question to the Secretary, and that under Rule 82 and the Enabling Act and decisions of this court, the rule cannot extend the jurisdiction of the District Court which is limited exclusively to actions by the Secretary."
1971.71-119,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2684.272,2707.939,"Mr. Solicitor General, suppose that we disagreed with you that Rule 24(a) was irrelevant in this case, but agreed with you that the Secretary is the only one who can bring the action, he is the only one who can specify the issues, but nevertheless in trying out those issues that he controlled."
1971.71-119,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2725.602,2729.513,I am not sure Mr. Justice.
1971.71-119,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2765.81,2767.934,"Well, who decides the issues?"
1971.71-119,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2767.934,2785.55,"Alright, is not presenting every argument that they would like to have presented, and I think that turns somewhat upon the question, what you mean by representation, particularly in the light of a statute which prescribes that a remedy shall be the exclusive remedy."
1971.71-119,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2811.467,2827.98,"Well, as I read the opinion below, they did not consider 24(a) on its own footing, except with respect to the financial records and reports issue."
1971.71-119,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2840.61,2849.824,"I think that's very close to accurate Mr. Justice and if one reads exclusive, to mean exclusive, then Section 24(a) becomes irrelevant."
1971.71-119,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2849.824,2862.152,"If the court decided that; that was error, I suppose 24(a) should be considered, I suppose the Court of Appeals should consider it first."
1971.71-119,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2873.018,2878.695,But what would you think would be the scope of their consideration on the subject?
1971.71-119,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2878.695,2881.963,I can't quite say Mr. Chief Justice.
1971.71-119,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2908.851,2915.815,"Mr. Solicitor General that whether you are right or wrong, but you certainly are consistent."
1971.71-119,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2915.815,2917.223,"Not always Mr. Justice, but --"
1971.71-119,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2917.223,2918.497,I mean yesterday and today.
1971.71-119,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2918.497,2922.353,"Between yesterday and today, I am."
1971.71-119,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2922.853,2928.489,The agencies of government can take of themselves and the outsiders must be kept out.
1971.71-119,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2928.489,2930.756,Not quite Mr. Justice.
1971.71-119,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3395.154,3396.28,Mr. Rauh.
1971.71-119,2,32532,joseph_l_rauh_jr,,3396.28,3398.813,May I please the court.
1971.71-119,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3398.813,3399.916,You have six minutes left.
1971.71-119,2,32532,joseph_l_rauh_jr,,3399.916,3401.111,Thank you sir.
1971.71-119,2,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3461.924,3463.963,This is apart from the two issues that the --
1971.71-119,2,32532,joseph_l_rauh_jr,,3463.963,3469.45,"Yes, precisely sir, however, we don't need that point."
1971.71-119,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3627.37,3629.91,"Thank you Mr. Rauh, thank you Mr. Solicitor General."
