2004.03-1164,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,0.0,6.449,We will now hear argument in Veneman against the Livestock Marketing Association.
2004.03-1164,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,7.743,10.837,"Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court:"
2004.03-1164,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,48.364,56.477,"Mr. Kneedler, will you tell us how this case differs, if it does, from what was before the Court in United Foods?"
2004.03-1164,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,59.436,68.584,"Well, the important distinction is that the two grounds that... on which we are defending the statute here were not addressed in United Foods."
2004.03-1164,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,76.807,78.691,We've never addressed that in--
2004.03-1164,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,78.691,80.332,"--In none of these cases, and--"
2004.03-1164,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,80.332,80.97,--in these cases--
2004.03-1164,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,80.97,81.302,--Right.
2004.03-1164,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,81.302,81.755,--have we?
2004.03-1164,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,81.755,82.935,The Court has not.
2004.03-1164,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,100.468,105.84,"Does it remain government speech even if you don't say, ""This is your government speaking""?"
2004.03-1164,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,105.84,106.166,It--
2004.03-1164,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,106.166,111.862,"If you say, you know, ""America's cattlemen are speaking"", is it government speech?"
2004.03-1164,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,111.862,116.016,"--It does... for purposes of this Court's government speech doctrine, it does."
2004.03-1164,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,116.452,116.952,Why is that?
2004.03-1164,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,117.427,120.721,"--And the Court... the Court's decision in Rust, I think, is the best illustration of that."
2004.03-1164,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,120.721,125.716,"Yeah, but Rust did not... Rust was not a case in which the doctor was saying,"
2004.03-1164,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,143.341,152.312,"Well, it... all those statements say... and there are advertisements in the record that say that the advertising is funded by America's beef producers, which is, of course, accurate, because they--"
2004.03-1164,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,152.312,152.939,"Well, it's accurate--"
2004.03-1164,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,152.939,153.319,--they pay for it.
2004.03-1164,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,153.319,159.337,--but it also contains the implication that who... he who pays is the person whose speech is being broadcasted.
2004.03-1164,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,159.337,180.056,"Well, but, again, in Rust, the doctor who spoke... I think the patient who went to see the doctor for counseling would have... would have assumed or believed that the doctor was... in the immediate encounter, that the doctor was speaking, and yet the Court, in its subsequent cases, has regarded Rust as a situation of government speech."
2004.03-1164,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,204.775,205.661,"--Yeah, but some people--"
2004.03-1164,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,205.661,206.099,"--on the advertising, itself."
2004.03-1164,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,206.099,210.384,"--may be more resistant to an... to an ad that says,"
2004.03-1164,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,217.402,231.137,"Well, I... and I think in Rust, some people would have been resistant to the idea that your government wants you to engage in family planning, but what the... what the Court said about Rust was that the government had established a program with a central message about counseling."
2004.03-1164,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,236.044,245.363,"Well, but if you... if you say the Act can be... say, because this is just an as-applied challenge, you're asking us to assume that we can put on a label that's not true,"
2004.03-1164,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,250.089,252.13,"Well, it would be accurate--"
2004.03-1164,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,252.13,255.47,And you're having us save the statute by just putting a label on it that isn't accurate.
2004.03-1164,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,255.47,260.91,"--Well, they're... I'm sure that a label could be devised that would... that would be accurate."
2004.03-1164,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,279.923,281.308,"But, Mr. Kneedler--"
2004.03-1164,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,281.308,284.417,"--that is actually to be used, so there is specific approval by the Secretary."
2004.03-1164,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,284.417,294.816,"--But there is... there's another tape put out by the government, on meat, and that... what is the government speech?"
2004.03-1164,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,335.214,340.709,"Well, the government, in the concern... in situations where it may be concerned about public health, doesn't say, ""Don't eat meat""."
2004.03-1164,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,380.749,382.948,"Mr. Kneedler, is meat fungible?"
2004.03-1164,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,386.146,390.882,"--Well, there are... there are... there are, to be sure, different cuts of meat, but the... but the basic--"
2004.03-1164,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,390.882,393.531,"I mean, even quality of meat within the... some is tougher than others."
2004.03-1164,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,393.531,394.2,--Well--
2004.03-1164,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,394.2,396.256,It's not like milk or wheat.
2004.03-1164,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,396.256,410.52,"--But Congress could reasonably determine, under this statute, that there are... that there are... that beef has many things in common, that it is a generic problem... or generic food or generic commodity, and the industry--"
2004.03-1164,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,410.52,413.321,"At some level, it certainly is, I suppose."
2004.03-1164,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,420.832,421.616,--It is fungible in--
2004.03-1164,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,421.616,438.418,"May I ask you whether, in deciding the government's speech doctrine, is it the Secretary's formal right to control, as set out in the statute, that we look to, or do we look to the Secretary's actual record of oversight--"
2004.03-1164,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,438.418,442.769,--We think the... we think the formal legal control is sufficient.
2004.03-1164,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,481.607,494.612,"Is it at all possible to do here what has been done in the union cases, where... I mean, it's pretty hard for me to believe that there aren't... that meat... that cattle growers don't, by and large, like beef."
2004.03-1164,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,526.369,527.914,"Well, I think that--"
2004.03-1164,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,527.914,528.853,Is it possible to work that out?
2004.03-1164,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,528.853,535.772,"--What has... what has been proposed by the... by the Respondents in this case, of course, is to make it voluntary, so that people--"
2004.03-1164,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,535.772,536.438,"Yeah, but, I mean, if you make it--"
2004.03-1164,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,536.438,536.787,--can opt out.
2004.03-1164,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,536.787,542.394,"--totally voluntary, what you're going to discover is, all of a sudden, the beef people, rather than write a check, will say,"
2004.03-1164,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,545.683,546.922,Well--
2004.03-1164,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,546.922,548.173,That saves them the money.
2004.03-1164,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,548.173,549.01,"--Well, and I--"
2004.03-1164,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,549.01,551.402,And I tend to doubt that that's their view.
2004.03-1164,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,551.402,552.023,"--Well, and--"
2004.03-1164,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,552.023,554.012,Some may view... object to certain content.
2004.03-1164,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,555.835,557.97,--I think it... I think it would not be feasible.
2004.03-1164,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,562.575,565.606,"It would be... in the union cases, it's hard enough."
2004.03-1164,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,572.486,573.98,--Absolutely.
2004.03-1164,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,601.055,601.832,Mr. Kneedler--
2004.03-1164,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,601.832,602.183,What the numbers--
2004.03-1164,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,602.183,605.71,--can I come back to Rust versus Sullivan?
2004.03-1164,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,614.56,615.373,--This Court--
2004.03-1164,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,615.373,627.605,"This is government subsidizing speech by private organizations, and it chose to subsidize one type of speech, but not another."
2004.03-1164,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,627.605,628.296,--Yeah--
2004.03-1164,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,628.296,629.884,"Did we say, in the opinion, that this was--"
2004.03-1164,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,629.884,649.608,"--Not in Rust, but in the Court's subsequent cases, Rosenberger, Southworth... in particular, in Velazquez... this Court said that Rust has come to be understood by the Court as a government speech case, because the government prescribed a message, and it's government speech whether or not the government speaks for itself or enlists others to transmit the message."
2004.03-1164,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,649.608,653.88,"--Well, for the precise purpose at issue here, I think it makes a lot of difference."
2004.03-1164,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,662.631,663.593,But--
2004.03-1164,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,663.593,664.321,--I think that's a really--
2004.03-1164,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,664.321,664.937,--but there's really no--
2004.03-1164,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,664.937,671.898,"--strong proposition, that whenever you're subsidizing any private enterprise, the speech of that private enterprise becomes public speech."
2004.03-1164,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,671.898,682.494,"--There's really no need to get to that point here, because the Beef Board, which is the entity that does the speaking, is, I think, unquestionably a government body."
2004.03-1164,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,688.573,689.223,That's fine.
2004.03-1164,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,702.437,705.643,"--Well, I think--"
2004.03-1164,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,705.643,706.604,And Rust doesn't stand for that.
2004.03-1164,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,706.604,717.272,"--what... I think, as this Court has come to explain Rust, as being issues of government speech... but, as I say, there is no need... there is no need for the Court to get to that situation."
2004.03-1164,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,727.143,732.882,"--This is a question perhaps more for the Respondent than for you, but I would like your comment on it."
2004.03-1164,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,752.101,759.972,I think... I think they would say that that... that there's something different about general taxes and excise taxes or focus taxes.
2004.03-1164,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,763.239,763.604,But why can't--
2004.03-1164,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,763.604,764.012,--in history or--
2004.03-1164,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,764.012,765.053,--why can't you just do that?
2004.03-1164,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,769.941,772.515,"--I'm sorry, do... maybe I misunderstood your question."
2004.03-1164,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,772.515,773.252,Why can't the government--
2004.03-1164,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,773.252,773.837,Were you asking why focus--
2004.03-1164,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,773.837,775.136,--why can't the government adopt my solution?
2004.03-1164,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,775.136,776.997,"--Well, I... and maybe I misunderstood."
2004.03-1164,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,782.714,785.202,It's put into the general fund of the... of the Treasury.
2004.03-1164,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,785.202,796.264,"--I... they may say that that's the same thing, but I... they were drawing a distinction between paying for it out of general funds... income tax or something... that we all would pay for."
2004.03-1164,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,805.728,812.633,"But then you'd come within the protections of Frothingham versus Mellon, and Massachusetts versus Mellon, if you did it that way."
2004.03-1164,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,812.633,836.823,"--Yes, there would be standing objection... objections at that point, but we think, in terms of the merits of the argument, the notion that a person would have a First Amendment objection to paying an excise tax because of the uses to which the excise taxes are being put is really extraordinary and finds no basis in cases like Abood and Keller, which have to do with private association... an association with private speech--"
2004.03-1164,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,836.823,837.206,But then you could--
2004.03-1164,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,837.206,837.82,--no government speech.
2004.03-1164,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,837.82,839.849,--probably restructure this Act to get to the result you want.
2004.03-1164,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,839.849,840.419,Yes.
2004.03-1164,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,884.601,894.076,"Mr. Kneedler, this theory is one that wasn't brought up at all in Wileman, if I remember correctly."
2004.03-1164,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,911.247,918.352,"--Yes, because the government did not reach the government speech... or the Court did not reach the government speech argument in United Foods."
2004.03-1164,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,932.853,935.812,You wouldn't want to treat beef and mushrooms inconsistently.
2004.03-1164,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,936.561,937.38,--Well--
2004.03-1164,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,937.38,938.914,--But there is--
2004.03-1164,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,938.914,939.385,--I think--
2004.03-1164,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,939.385,946.886,"--the public perception of these ads... it says, ""Eat meat""... it's quite different from saying,"
2004.03-1164,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,954.156,972.796,"--But what the... what the United States is doing is responding to this classic collective-action problem by establishing a government program to meet the situation where the industry, itself, will... is unable to conduct the advertising because of... because of, what I said, the fungibility of the product--"
2004.03-1164,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,972.796,973.071,--But then--
2004.03-1164,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,973.071,973.261,--and all.
2004.03-1164,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,973.261,988.26,--isn't it more realistic to describe this as the government facilitating the private speech of the many people in this industry who don't have a big budget to advertise on--
2004.03-1164,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,988.26,988.685,I think--
2004.03-1164,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,988.685,988.912,--on their own?
2004.03-1164,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,988.912,991.135,"--doctrinally, it is government speech."
2004.03-1164,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1002.511,1003.136,Do you want to save your time?
2004.03-1164,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1003.136,1003.56,--Please.
2004.03-1164,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1003.56,1011.054,Mr. Garre.
2004.03-1164,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1011.054,1017.117,"Thank you, Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court:"
2004.03-1164,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1026.694,1029.536,"If we can just continue on government speech, because that's where--"
2004.03-1164,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1029.536,1029.751,Yeah.
2004.03-1164,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1029.751,1030.704,--where we left off.
2004.03-1164,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1038.942,1040.079,Justice Kennedy--
2004.03-1164,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1040.079,1041.55,It ought to be out of the general fund.

2004.03-1164,2,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2138.048,2138.389,--Right.
2004.03-1164,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2138.389,2139.338,--does that make a difference?
2004.03-1164,2,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2139.338,2140.758,I think it makes an emotional difference.
2004.03-1164,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2140.758,2143.022,But no legal difference.

2004.03-1164,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2594.114,2595.611,So the answer is--

2004.03-1164,2,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2856.286,2856.434,--Okay.
2004.03-1164,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2856.434,2862.34,"--could the government, nevertheless, insist on the industry financing advertising advocating the government's position?"
2004.03-1164,2,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2862.34,2865.217,"Well, not advocating; reporting what the government position is."
2004.03-1164,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2882.958,2884.725,"So, in this case--"
2004.03-1164,2,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2884.725,2884.999,--is impermissible.

2004.03-1164,2,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2898.48,2898.629,All right?
2004.03-1164,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2906.654,2908.944,--But what's the answer to my question?
2004.03-1164,2,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2908.944,2917.424,"If the question is, Can retail grocers be required to put on the beef packages they sell,"
2004.03-1164,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2927.638,2928.115,In other words--
2004.03-1164,2,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2928.115,2929.405,--to defend than the cigarette package.
2004.03-1164,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2929.405,2932.005,"--I think the question, or at least the version I have of it--"
2004.03-1164,2,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2932.005,2932.169,Yes.
2004.03-1164,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2932.169,2944.749,"--is, we have this case, exactly, and the only difference is, instead of getting these people to eat... say, ""Eat beef"", what they say do is, they get people together and say, ""Don't eat too much beef""."
2004.03-1164,2,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2945.274,2945.456,Well--
2004.03-1164,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2945.456,2946.273,"--""too much"", because that--"
2004.03-1164,2,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2946.273,2946.445,--Yeah.
2004.03-1164,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2946.445,2947.061,--makes it more realistic.
2004.03-1164,2,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2950.32,2952.673,The program is facially unconstitutional.
2004.03-1164,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2979.803,2980.135,All right.
2004.03-1164,2,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3004.833,3005.598,Or maybe--
2004.03-1164,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3005.598,3006.781,First Amendment problem--
2004.03-1164,2,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3006.781,3007.603,--talking about the war in Iraq.

2004.03-1164,2,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3022.716,3023.29,--than Social Security.
2004.03-1164,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3023.29,3023.461,--your position is.
2004.03-1164,2,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3025.021,3039.32,"My position is that once the revenue is part of the government's general fund, the government's subject to doctrines that I don't think are First Amendment doctrines about government propaganda... there may be limits on the government's ability--"
2004.03-1164,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3039.32,3039.706,"Okay, then--"
2004.03-1164,2,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3039.706,3040.132,--to defend it.
2004.03-1164,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3040.132,3040.542,--He's just going back to--
2004.03-1164,2,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3040.542,3040.999,Subject to that--
2004.03-1164,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3040.999,3041.248,"--Okay, then it does not have--"
2004.03-1164,2,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3041.248,3041.912,--it's not a First Amendment problem.
2004.03-1164,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3041.912,3042.598,--it's not a First Amendment problem.
2004.03-1164,2,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3044.267,3044.672,That's correct.
2004.03-1164,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3044.672,3045.397,Okay.
2004.03-1164,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3045.397,3051.818,--Is that... is that an answer to the question that Justice Kennedy urged in the opening argument?
2004.03-1164,2,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3072.508,3100.24,"If the structure is they take the money from you and put it in this elaborate machinery which comes out with statements you're forced to support, the statements that don't have behind them the accountability checks of the Federal Government, which has to answer to taxpayers and answer to the public for the stuff it puts out... that is... if that's what it is, it doesn't matter what you call it, it remains unconstitutional."
2004.03-1164,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3122.863,3124.027,--But suppose--
2004.03-1164,2,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3124.027,3124.26,--that these people--
2004.03-1164,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3124.26,3124.928,--we don't have that?
2004.03-1164,2,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3138.54,3141.756,--And we're going to eliminate the cattlemen's Beef Board and all of these things--
2004.03-1164,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3141.756,3142.168,Yes.
2004.03-1164,2,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3142.168,3142.775,--that are supposed to represent you--
2004.03-1164,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3142.775,3147.484,But we are... but where this money is coming from to pay this is--
2004.03-1164,2,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3147.484,3150.663,"--I would be happy to represent the cattlemen in that circumstance, saying,"
2004.03-1164,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3203.78,3209.617,"May I go back to one of your reasons, which was that they are being singled out to pay for this?"
2004.03-1164,2,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3228.554,3254.295,"I think that there's a point beyond which, for institutional reasons, it would be very problematic for Courts to say that you could trace the dollars into the treasury and those institutional reasons would be, I think, an instance of under-enforcement of a constitutional norm, because the underlying constitutional principle that you ought not to be able, by some gimmick, to get some people to support speech they don't believe in, that would be there."
2004.03-1164,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3313.038,3313.746,"Yes, but on the other hand--"
2004.03-1164,2,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3313.746,3314.555,--you'd be--
2004.03-1164,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3314.555,3321.091,--you're running into the problem that the taxpayer can be compelled to pay taxes to support activities that he doesn't support at all.
2004.03-1164,2,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3322.736,3323.471,"--Well, we do that all the time."
2004.03-1164,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3323.471,3324.12,--the other extreme.
2004.03-1164,2,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3324.496,3324.91,We do that all--
2004.03-1164,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3324.91,3325.414,--do it all the time.
2004.03-1164,2,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3325.414,3325.675,--the time.
2004.03-1164,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3325.675,3326.459,And when are we crossing--
2004.03-1164,2,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3326.459,3326.835,That's the--
2004.03-1164,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3326.835,3327.046,--the line?
2004.03-1164,2,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3327.046,3328.147,"--that's why we have elections, in part."
2004.03-1164,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3328.147,3328.542,Pardon me?
2004.03-1164,2,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3328.542,3328.752,Right?
2004.03-1164,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3341.037,3341.414,But it is--
2004.03-1164,2,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3341.414,3342.2,--would allow complete chaos.
2004.03-1164,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3342.2,3347.32,"--inconsistent with the basic principle on which you rely, that the individual should not be compelled to support speech--"
2004.03-1164,2,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3347.32,3348.05,Well--
2004.03-1164,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3348.05,3348.384,--with which he disagrees.
2004.03-1164,2,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3348.384,3354.08,--to support... supporting speech is somewhat different from supporting activities that you don't agree with.

2004.03-1164,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3359.427,3360.53,--isn't that--
2004.03-1164,2,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3360.53,3360.717,--I'm sorry.
2004.03-1164,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3360.717,3363.893,--Don't you go back to the answer you gave me?
2004.03-1164,2,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3375.953,3376.972,Or any structure.
