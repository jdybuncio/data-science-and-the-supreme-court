1958.66,0,20008,charles_p_scully,,23.488,29.074,"Mr. Chief Justice and Associate Justices of the Supreme Court, may it please the Court."
1958.66,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,103.642,105.544,That testimony showed what?
1958.66,0,20008,charles_p_scully,,105.544,117.712,That they presented the contract to the employer for examination and that they stated they would not request him to sign it until the employees joined or agreed to join.
1958.66,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,154.989,162.534,Would you be good enough to state the case in -- in its chronological sequence so that one gets the full comfort of --
1958.66,0,20008,charles_p_scully,,162.534,163.001,"Yes, Your Honor."
1958.66,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,163.001,165.561,-- (Voice Overlap) significant in what you've just called our attention?
1958.66,0,20008,charles_p_scully,,165.561,168.654,"All right, Your Honor."
1958.66,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,542.776,544.634,What do you -- go on --
1958.66,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,544.634,550.578,"I'll just want to say this that you give us, this procedural background, and would you give us the factual effect."
1958.66,0,20008,charles_p_scully,,550.578,551.127,"Yes, Your Honor."
1958.66,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,551.127,552.779,It wasn't in the very (Voice Overlap) --
1958.66,0,20008,charles_p_scully,,552.779,553.193,Right.
1958.66,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,553.193,554.998,-- and just -- just so with the orientation.
1958.66,0,20008,charles_p_scully,,554.998,555.32,Right.
1958.66,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,756.076,758.621,Was that the only -- it was the only signs?
1958.66,0,20008,charles_p_scully,,758.621,769.189,That was the only sign and the record will disclose that it is the first time that such type of a sign had been used by the union.
1958.66,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,912.04,918.132,"Do you also state, before you get in argument, what conceive to be issues before this Court."
1958.66,0,20008,charles_p_scully,,930.437,934.316,I believe that the concise question involved in this --
1958.66,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,934.316,935.088,They just want -- and they just want that --
1958.66,0,20008,charles_p_scully,,935.088,942.019,"I believe it can be summarized to one and it may have subdivisions, Your Honor, but Mr. Justice, I believe the issue was this."
1958.66,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,981.052,994.92,"Exactly the correction I assumed you will try that no decision of this Court, the period of cases even with problems, if we have any, has decided this particular question you just raised, is that right?"
1958.66,0,20008,charles_p_scully,,994.92,1004.713,"I -- I think Your Honor that while the certain decisions may be construed, I -- I believe that the precise point has not been completely decided in any decision of this Court."
1958.66,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1004.826,1010.516,You do not happen to know that we've already reached a favorable result your way.
1958.66,0,20008,charles_p_scully,,1014.641,1015.236,"No, Your Honor."
1958.66,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1043.326,1047.426,"Mr. Scully, is there any dispute as to whether there was any violence in there?"
1958.66,0,20008,charles_p_scully,,1047.426,1071.559,"There is no dispute and in the first decision in this case, this Court itself specifically stated that the conduct was peaceful, and you will find that in the appendix to our petition for certiorari and it's on page 50, in which this Court stated, “The union's commence peaceful picketing to enforce their demand.”"
1958.66,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1439.526,1452.183,"And before you do that, I was looking -- whether the -- which is just extension opinion, dealt with the bearing of adversity upon problem now before us."
1958.66,0,20008,charles_p_scully,,1452.183,1457.531,"I do not believe it does, Your Honor."
1958.66,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1606.479,1616.699,Mr. Plant.
1958.66,1,36476,marion_b_plant,,1616.699,1621.667,Mr. Chief Justice and the other members of this Honorable Court.
1958.66,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1746.302,1762.965,"Was this -- was affixed to the (Inaudible) to take a case by the Board or anybody seizing for it based, so far as there's any -- avowal of their action, the reasons for their action."
1958.66,1,36476,marion_b_plant,,1766.027,1766.647,"No, they just --"
1958.66,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1766.647,1768.033,In the technical sense?
1958.66,1,36476,marion_b_plant,,1768.033,1768.347,"No, Your Honor."
1958.66,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1768.347,1780.39,Did they say exercising the discretion that the Board has as to what cases be taken and what not be taken in the inevitable character making that determination.
1958.66,1,36476,marion_b_plant,,1782.864,1791.322,"They -- and I -- I think that it was in the exercise of their discretion, may determine that the case did not meet their jurisdictional standards, so-called."
1958.66,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1791.322,1792.557,The monetary?
1958.66,1,36476,marion_b_plant,,1792.557,1793.578,Yes.
1958.66,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1793.578,1794.541,Pardon me?
1958.66,1,36476,marion_b_plant,,1794.541,1798.01,They determined that the case did not meet their monetary standards.
1958.66,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1798.01,1800.713,"Yes, but not the statutes already excluded."
1958.66,1,36476,marion_b_plant,,1800.713,1804.998,"No, I -- I don't know what case would fall without the statutes."
1958.66,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1804.998,1807.892,But I just --
1958.66,1,36476,marion_b_plant,,1807.892,1814.373,"Now, the trial court awarded an injunction and damages."
1958.66,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1854.977,1859.086,The kind of unfair as denounced by what law?
1958.66,1,36476,marion_b_plant,,1859.086,1860.376,Under the Federal Act.
1958.66,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1860.376,1861.33,Under the Federal Act.
1958.66,1,36476,marion_b_plant,,1861.33,1862.993,Yes.
1958.66,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1873.923,1875.293,May I -- may I interrupt you again --
1958.66,1,36476,marion_b_plant,,1875.293,1875.344,Yes.
1958.66,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1875.344,1876.696,-- Mr. Plant?
1958.66,1,36476,marion_b_plant,,1896.784,1897.374,Well --
1958.66,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1897.374,1898.775,Is that a fair statement?
1958.66,1,36476,marion_b_plant,,1898.775,1900.623,"That is not quite a complete statement, Your Honor."
1958.66,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1900.623,1902.275,"All right, you go on."
1958.66,1,36476,marion_b_plant,,1902.275,1906.944,There were two possible violations that the Federal Act involved.
1958.66,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1933.046,1933.936,Of the State.
1958.66,1,36476,marion_b_plant,,1933.936,1936.46,Of the Federal Government.
1958.66,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1956.874,1957.09,"Well, I --"
1958.66,1,36476,marion_b_plant,,1957.09,1959.531,We therefore find the distortions.
1958.66,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1959.531,1964.137,"If I press this point, forgive me but I think -- it's my way of thinking about conclusion."
1958.66,1,36476,marion_b_plant,,1964.137,1964.704,Yes.
1958.66,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1964.704,1981.238,"Whether it was privileged or not, there was the determination that there was a violation of the National Act by the state authority after the National Board had declined to find out whether there was or there wasn't."
1958.66,1,36476,marion_b_plant,,1981.238,1987.415,"Yes, I think that the California Supreme Court said that this picketing violated the -- the National Act."
1958.66,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2164.277,2167.166,There is no question in this case of any violence at all --
1958.66,1,36476,marion_b_plant,,2167.166,2169.502,No violence.
1958.66,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2413.95,2414.708,May I -- may I ask again?
1958.66,1,36476,marion_b_plant,,2414.708,2416.835,Yes.
1958.66,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2416.835,2421.306,"-- of which constitutes, you said a violation of both state and federal law."
1958.66,1,36476,marion_b_plant,,2421.306,2422.155,Right.
1958.66,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2422.155,2437.242,"But in a way, in saying that and at least, I think pass on or pass over or include what is the essential practice in this case."
1958.66,1,36476,marion_b_plant,,2452.836,2461.318,"Well, of course you're quite true, Your Honor, that the federal substantive law where it applies supersedes state law and I didn't mean to imply otherwise."
1958.66,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2461.318,2469.339,"I -- I didn't mean to -- I -- I think that's a fair enough of with having it appear, if one analyzes it, and that's what it gets down to."
1958.66,1,36476,marion_b_plant,,2492.346,2494.296,It might reach a contrary conclusion as to the facts.
1958.66,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2494.296,2502.162,"It might reach a contrary conclusion and then the state court couldn't say -- couldn't start to discourage them, could it?"
1958.66,1,36476,marion_b_plant,,2502.162,2516.825,"Well, I -- I think it could for this reason, Your Honor, that the question whether the employer would be violating the -- well, wait, let's -- let's come back just a moment here."
1958.66,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2535.958,2536.306,Wasn't it -- wasn't that --
1958.66,1,36476,marion_b_plant,,2536.306,2540.28,I'm relying simply on my own knowledge of the Board and the Court's decisions.
1958.66,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2540.28,2542.552,Wasn't that the starting point of the first decision?
1958.66,1,36476,marion_b_plant,,2542.552,2544.181,That was the starting point of the first decision.
1958.66,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2544.181,2549.538,Wasn't that -- wasn't that assumed that it were under Section --
1958.66,1,36476,marion_b_plant,,2549.538,2549.773,I don't --
1958.66,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2549.773,2552.403,"(Voice Overlap) of course, if you --"
1958.66,1,36476,marion_b_plant,,2552.403,2552.554,It was --
1958.66,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2552.554,2576.297,"-- if you defend here and say to us that there is no preemption, there can't be no preemption because California was in the scope of its own state authority as condemned conduct no matter what the Labor Board says in another relationship or another situation."
1958.66,1,36476,marion_b_plant,,2624.719,2624.787,Maybe --
1958.66,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2624.787,2630.184,You must try in order -- in order to deny -- in order to say no.
1958.66,1,36476,marion_b_plant,,2646.353,2647.353,"We have that, Your Honor."
1958.66,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2648.306,2649.341,When --
1958.66,1,36476,marion_b_plant,,2649.341,2656.626,The decision of the California Supreme Court as I say was -- the second decision was based purely upon California law.
1958.66,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2665.916,2666.101,Well --
1958.66,1,36476,marion_b_plant,,2666.101,2667.191,In the first --
1958.66,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2667.191,2673.547,Maybe the law was -- the second decision is the state law that you give damages.
1958.66,1,36476,marion_b_plant,,2673.547,2674.556,Right.
1958.66,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2674.556,2681.655,"But -- but that -- I know the (Inaudible) as I'm talking about, to remedial matters as against subsequent."
1958.66,1,36476,marion_b_plant,,2702.796,2704.519,The same in the two cases?
1958.66,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2704.519,2704.665,Yes.
1958.66,1,36476,marion_b_plant,,2704.665,2706.806,Preventative relief and damages?
1958.66,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2706.806,2716.459,"No, that's the -- that the damage relief is in relation to the substantive -- the same substantive matter for which an injunction couldn't be granted according to (Voice Overlap)."
1958.66,1,36476,marion_b_plant,,2716.459,2719.031,"Right, Your Honor."
1958.66,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2721.909,2727.009,You are taking somewhat the argument of the dissent in the Guss case --
1958.66,1,36476,marion_b_plant,,2727.009,2731.972,"Well, I've seen so many arguments I can't recall, [Laughs] Your Honor."
1958.66,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2758.598,2768.862,"The reason I interrupting you so much is, these are very tricky -- these are very -- almost you might call a subtle distinction the Court has had to go."
1958.66,1,36476,marion_b_plant,,2768.862,2770.275,Indeed they are.
1958.66,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2770.275,2776.045,And -- and I think one has to watch each step if he -- if he were to put -- to putting it.
1958.66,1,36476,marion_b_plant,,2776.045,2778.251,Yes indeed.
1958.66,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2949.594,2952.675,Then when -- you are very confident about that.
1958.66,1,36476,marion_b_plant,,2957.719,2976.389,"Well, if the Board found that it was protected, Your Honor, the Board will be wrong and would be reversed by this Court because I don't think that this Court would ever hold that the Act protects conduct designed to force an employer to do that which the Act forbids."
1958.66,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2985.307,2998.311,But -- but does that -- does that conclusion follow from -- or is that not permit the conclusion that -- for them to picket without violence is not compelling the employer to do that?
1958.66,1,36476,marion_b_plant,,2998.311,2998.759,"Well, it's --"
1958.66,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2998.759,3000.569,That's my trouble.
1958.66,1,36476,marion_b_plant,,3000.569,3001.494,I don't know.
1958.66,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3011.598,3011.858,In what --
1958.66,1,36476,marion_b_plant,,3011.858,3016.956,The idea here is of course that it's always possible.
1958.66,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3037.677,3044.018,"When you said that, has gone a long way to illuminate the whole problem (Inaudible)"
1958.66,1,36476,marion_b_plant,,3094.461,3098.617,"Well, Your Honor, I respectfully -- respectfully disagree with you."
1958.66,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3098.833,3101.844,"That's one of my questions, to elicit comments and illuminate --"
1958.66,1,36476,marion_b_plant,,3101.844,3109.251,"As Justice Stewart said yesterday, the fact that a man is killed does not mean that there has been a murder."
1958.66,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3160.695,3172.206,"Well, I suggested the fact that is -- what you're doing is to cast some -- that's a very different difficulties about Laburnum as others have raised difficulties."
1958.66,1,36476,marion_b_plant,,3206.509,3214.158,"Well, I -- I just don't see that they differ a bit, Your Honor because if that Laburnum case had been presented to the Board, it might very well."
1958.66,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3215.154,3217.092,"It might -- well, all of it this which is why we're telling this also --"
1958.66,1,36476,marion_b_plant,,3217.092,3217.889,(Inaudible)
1958.66,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3217.889,3218.258,-- to a non-demonstration.
1958.66,1,36476,marion_b_plant,,3218.258,3219.223,Yes.
1958.66,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3225.579,3229.947,"Well then, this Court have said, that's -- as I would have guessed -- called it in."
1958.66,1,36476,marion_b_plant,,3248.023,3250.951,"Well now, let -- let me point this out to Your Honor."
1958.66,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3325.188,3327.349,What do you had caused the bill?
1958.66,1,36476,marion_b_plant,,3327.349,3340.975,He was speaking against it.
1958.66,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3440.907,3443.918,And gave us all these troubles.
1958.66,1,36476,marion_b_plant,,3443.918,3449.097,"Well, I [Laughs] -- sometimes I think we tend to create some of our own troubles, Your Honor."
1958.66,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3449.097,3449.415,That's okay a comment.
1958.66,1,36476,marion_b_plant,,3453.066,3476.347,"Now, I submit that Congress was not in the least bit concerned over the possibility that a federal or State Court might decide a factual or legal issue presented under Section 303 than the Board might decide them in a -- an unfair labor practice proceeding under Section 8 (b)."
1958.66,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3534.296,3536.046,Where is it cited?
1958.66,1,36476,marion_b_plant,,3536.046,3536.843,What is that?
1958.66,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3536.843,3538.377,"Well, I don't see it in your brief."
1958.66,1,36476,marion_b_plant,,3538.377,3540.758,"That's not our brief, Your Honor."
1958.66,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3566.233,3567.53,In the orange --
1958.66,1,36476,marion_b_plant,,3567.53,3568.951,"Yes, it's here."
1958.66,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3704.423,3721.477,What is your distinction between giving injunctive remedy as an expression of state policy which this Court have included in this kind of a case and giving money damage.
1958.66,1,36476,marion_b_plant,,3721.477,3724.546,"The main distinction is this, Your Honor."
1958.66,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3819.81,3844.777,"Except as to the starting point from which the money damage flows, and be ascertained by the state court's order says and within refusal of the Board to give a cease and desist order because on their view of the testimony, find out of it and what the state court is on."
1958.66,1,36476,marion_b_plant,,3844.777,3846.978,"There's always that possibility, Your Honor."
1958.66,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3869.944,3887.387,"Well, can we assume that if the Board found -- the fact that the state courts found this, it wouldn't grant this in this order if the Board -- when does the Board, finding that there was a violation of the Federal Act, decline to issue a cease and desist order."
1958.66,1,36476,marion_b_plant,,3901.941,3904.639,"An example doesn't occur to me off hand, Your Honor."
1958.66,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3921.89,3925.78,You helped me to be more troubled than I have already been about that.
1958.66,1,36476,marion_b_plant,,3925.78,3926.379,[Laughs]
1958.66,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3926.379,3928.942,(Inaudible)
1958.66,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4413.886,4419.068,"I might say, have been talking about federal courts as distinguished from the state courts."
1958.66,1,36476,marion_b_plant,,4419.068,4421.78,"I find nothing to indicate it, Your Honor."
1958.66,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4431.28,4434.139,"Well, but the section didn't say that there were, does -- had it?"
1958.66,1,36476,marion_b_plant,,4438.043,4438.279,Right.
1958.66,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4438.279,4439.759,That would -- would be an addition.
1958.66,1,36476,marion_b_plant,,4439.759,4440.395,Right.
1958.66,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4440.395,4445.819,But -- but did it say either in the federal or in the state courts?
1958.66,1,36476,marion_b_plant,,4445.819,4446.025,No.
1958.66,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4448.437,4468.159,"Well, do you -- you take it from that -- that the Congress gave courts right to the states to prescribe for any remedies they chose from their reports and that this should -- this act should only be in addition to those rights?"
1958.66,1,36476,marion_b_plant,,4468.159,4470.589,"No, I will not generalize to that extent, Your Honor."
1958.66,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4470.589,4471.024,"Well, to which (Voice Overlap) --"
1958.66,1,36476,marion_b_plant,,4471.024,4475.64,My point is -- my point is simply this.
1958.66,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4492.284,4493.695,If any would submit.
1958.66,1,36476,marion_b_plant,,4493.695,4494.159,What is that?
1958.66,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4494.159,4495.122,"Shall any, would submit, grants --"
1958.66,1,36476,marion_b_plant,,4495.122,4495.509,That's right.
1958.66,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4495.509,4496.706,-- a parallel.
1958.66,1,36476,marion_b_plant,,4496.706,4497.451,That's right.
1958.66,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4514.189,4518.165,(Inaudible)
1958.66,1,36476,marion_b_plant,,4518.165,4519.795,What is your --
1958.66,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4519.795,4522.503,"I'm much interested in the use to making it to your brief, I say I'm much interested in the use to making it to your brief."
1958.66,1,36476,marion_b_plant,,4537.86,4542.278,"Well, I think it demonstrates the congressional approach, Your Honor."
1958.66,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4664.839,4668.874,"Before you sit down, I'd like to ask you a few words."
1958.66,1,36476,marion_b_plant,,4690.255,4705.57,"The only significance I attribute to the presence of violence in that case was that in the circumstances of that case, it rendered the union's conduct tortuous."
1958.66,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4825.441,4826.433,You --
1958.66,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4826.433,4833.832,"Mr. Scully, go on with your -- with your argument."
1958.66,2,20008,charles_p_scully,,4833.832,4867.936,"If the Court please, I believe that we should reply briefly to certain portions of Mr. Plant's arguments and I do not believe it's necessary for us to repeat our contention with respect to the primary determination being made by the Board rather than the state court where there is protected or prohibited activities in our factual -- in our reference to the transcript as the evidence which under Weber, we believe, would clearly indicate a protected rather than a prohibited activity."
1958.66,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5000.971,5030.905,"What do you say -- what do say to Mr. Plant's suggestion that the relief the remedy which is available to the Board at least in to this Court is analogous to it and therefore maybe in conflict with an injunction by the state court, but those in conflict can possibly arise in giving damages -- that's with damages."
1958.66,2,20008,charles_p_scully,,5030.905,5036.396,"Well, I think the first answer is the argument which we have pressed and which I believe you indicated to Mr. Plant, namely --"
1958.66,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5036.396,5036.674,I hope --
1958.66,2,20008,charles_p_scully,,5036.674,5037.145,-- that it is not --
1958.66,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5037.145,5039.625,"-- (Voice Overlap) argument, I hope I indicated difficulties."
1958.66,2,20008,charles_p_scully,,5039.625,5044.934,That -- that it is not the form of the procedure as this Court noted in -- in Oliver yesterday.
1958.66,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5085.266,5087.412,That's the first -- is that the first –-
1958.66,2,20008,charles_p_scully,,5087.412,5089.816,"That's the first decision, yes."
1958.66,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5134.152,5147.22,"Is there anything -- is there anything in the second opinion, the January 16th of last year except inferentially that the Court still stands on that?"
1958.66,2,20008,charles_p_scully,,5147.22,5161.724,I -- I think that the whole reading of the opinion indicates that that is still the underlying thought of the Court and that it is not privileged conduct because it is violative of the National Labor Relations Act.
1958.66,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5399.04,5405.199,But the inconsistency here results except wholly abstractness?
1958.66,2,20008,charles_p_scully,,5440.527,5440.638,Well --
1958.66,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5440.638,5442.854,Except abstractly considered.
1958.66,2,20008,charles_p_scully,,5442.854,5445.981,"Well, first of all, Your Honors, so that our position is clear."
1958.66,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5522.845,5539.868,"Where in fact, it refused to take hold and where in fact the San Diego State Council didn't press that or didn't try to assert to that unfair labor practice, is that right?"
1958.66,2,20008,charles_p_scully,,5539.868,5540.58,That's right.
1958.66,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5540.58,5553.371,"So that in fact, now, I'm asking to whether this can be the fact that -- that the Congress, on which your whole argument ultimately stress, isn't an abstract conflict."
1958.66,2,20008,charles_p_scully,,5553.371,5553.948,"No, Your Honor."
1958.66,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5591.339,5607.754,"That is why the union are helpless creatures and can't show that the complaints that was sought to be filed was -- was purposely diluted or that they can't actively themselves file as you claim, a violation of the Labor Board as well."
1958.66,2,20008,charles_p_scully,,5607.754,5613.565,"Well, but I understand Your Honor is that where the Courts -- where the Board declines to accept it."
1958.66,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5613.565,5614.823,"Well, that's what I'm saying."
1958.66,2,20008,charles_p_scully,,5614.823,5615.168,And -- and --
1958.66,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5615.168,5620.037,"And the Board, the remedy is always that the Board could take hold, then there's no problem, is there?"
1958.66,2,20008,charles_p_scully,,5620.037,5620.283,No.
1958.66,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5620.83,5621.605,All right.
1958.66,2,20008,charles_p_scully,,5636.772,5640.327,"Or -- well, if that's -- if that is the approach Your Honor is --"
1958.66,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5640.327,5640.466,(Voice Overlap)
1958.66,2,20008,charles_p_scully,,5640.466,5656.29,"-- Mr. Justice have taken, then I suggest this, Your Honor, that if the Board for some sound reasons, some sound reason, says, ""We do not wish to take and occupy this labor management sphere,"" it therefore remains unregulated."
1958.66,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5678.528,5692.806,"I'm saying here that the statute is -- it construe in the administrative application made of it by the Board that this thing is to be modeled out instead of litigated out, is that right?"
1958.66,2,20008,charles_p_scully,,5692.806,5697.256,"Well, let's say that it is to be left unregulated by the State, Your Honor."
1958.66,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5697.256,5702.463,"Well, I say -- or that I don't think that -- I'm -- I'm going to be real, what is called realistic."
1958.66,2,20008,charles_p_scully,,5704.584,5705.837,"Well, but you could have an argument."
1958.66,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5705.837,5721.119,"You appeal for the intention of Congress and you must rest on the proposition that Congress, by allowing the Board, will shed itself of -- of actions or revolve any actions."
1958.66,2,20008,charles_p_scully,,5724.854,5727.523,I think that's what the first Garmon case can be construed as wholly.
1958.66,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5727.523,5728.534,That is what I'm saying.
1958.66,2,20008,charles_p_scully,,5728.534,5729.156,That's correct.
1958.66,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5731.323,5733.848,I just wan to know what this gets down to.
1958.66,2,20008,charles_p_scully,,5733.848,5745.483,"So that we submit if I may go back to the 303 argument, Your Honor, because Mr. Plant has inferred that for the purpose of supporting his arguments, 303 also covers state courts."
