1957.7,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,22.669,"Number 7, J. D. Conley et al., Petitioners, versus Pat J. Gibson, General Chairman of Locals 6051 and 28 et al."
1957.7,0,33516,joseph_c_waddy,,26.619,35.573,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1957.7,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,134.878,143.859,"Mr. Waddy, would it interfere with what you had planned to put before the Court if you told us at the outset exactly what the facts are in this case?"
1957.7,0,33516,joseph_c_waddy,,143.859,144.522,"Well, that is this --"
1957.7,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,144.522,153.532,I mean the human fact and what it means and what it doesn't mean before we get on to this -- to me still very difficult problem.
1957.7,0,33516,joseph_c_waddy,,153.532,153.93,That is right.
1957.7,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,153.93,154.712,Could you do that?
1957.7,0,33516,joseph_c_waddy,,154.712,155.061,Yes.
1957.7,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,158.049,158.555,I'm sorry.
1957.7,0,33516,joseph_c_waddy,,158.555,166.749,I simply wanted the Court to know that within the -- this framework of reference that I have mentioned.
1957.7,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,315.895,323.274,"When you say the maintenance of these two locals, would you mind telling us how these two locals came into existence?"
1957.7,0,33516,joseph_c_waddy,,323.274,328.469,"So far as my information is, they came into existence years ago."
1957.7,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,345.368,348.934,That is -- this was an old condition when the Railway Labor Act was passed.
1957.7,0,33516,joseph_c_waddy,,348.934,350.499,That is correct so far as I understand.
1957.7,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,403.94,408.561,"Now, let's see if I understand this because this can be either important thing."
1957.7,0,33516,joseph_c_waddy,,413.395,416.124,"No, the agreement has been in effect since 1939."
1957.7,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,416.124,416.394,Yes.
1957.7,0,33516,joseph_c_waddy,,417.956,420.925,It is not subject just -- it's renewable subject to the Railway Labor Act.
1957.7,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,420.925,421.201,Yes.
1957.7,0,33516,joseph_c_waddy,,421.201,422.254,30 days notice.
1957.7,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,422.254,436.811,"Well, if you get 30 days notice if -- if notice is given that there's desire to wage increase, what -- how is it going -- how is the collective bargaining process gone about since 1951?"
1957.7,0,33516,joseph_c_waddy,,436.811,453.819,"My information is that the union, the international, formulates the demands and makes the demand from the carrier and the carrier negotiates with the international or because most of these wage movements since 1951 had been at the national level."
1957.7,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,453.819,465.06,"Well, then -- but you said a minute ago that if any bargaining is done with the -- with the railroad at the lower level, that it's all done by the -- by Local 28."
1957.7,0,33516,joseph_c_waddy,,465.06,465.211,That's right.
1957.7,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,465.211,465.822,Is that right?
1957.7,0,33516,joseph_c_waddy,,465.822,466.077,That's correct.
1957.7,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,466.077,475.928,"And what I want to know is what -- what is the subject matter of the bargaining from which if I understood you, the Negro local is excluded?"
1957.7,0,33516,joseph_c_waddy,,475.928,480.606,"Well, any matter that might come up because the Brotherhood --"
1957.7,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,480.606,481.749,"Well, give us a specific --"
1957.7,0,33516,joseph_c_waddy,,481.749,482.885,All right.
1957.7,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,497.114,498.47,"Seniority questions, none?"
1957.7,0,33516,joseph_c_waddy,,498.47,500.671,"Seniority questions, yes."
1957.7,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,500.671,511.421,And suppose -- suppose the 6051 wants to have a change in the -- in the existing terms about seniority.
1957.7,0,33516,joseph_c_waddy,,511.71,513.076,6051 has no -- no --
1957.7,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,513.076,516.548,What would if -- but suppose the membership of 6051 --
1957.7,0,33516,joseph_c_waddy,,516.548,516.692,Would have --
1957.7,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,516.692,519.116,"-- either some wrong to be righted, what can they do?"
1957.7,0,33516,joseph_c_waddy,,519.116,520.823,They'd have to go through Local 28.
1957.7,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,520.823,522.346,They'd have to stay to the -- whatever the person --
1957.7,0,33516,joseph_c_waddy,,522.346,524.311,To the General Chairman of Local 28.
1957.7,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,524.311,525.007,Will you do this for us?
1957.7,0,33516,joseph_c_waddy,,525.007,526.491,Would you do this for us?
1957.7,1,22408,edward_j_hickey_jr,,2161.722,2164.993,May it please the Court.
1957.7,2,33516,joseph_c_waddy,,5946.265,5951.568,May it please the Court.
1957.7,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6127.864,6134.361,"By saying, you're compelled to join this 6051 or whatever it was."
1957.7,2,33516,joseph_c_waddy,,6142.791,6148.304,My understanding of the allegation compelled is that they cannot join Local 28.
1957.7,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6175.071,6193.299,"Would you -- would you urge that if this -- if this complaint unfound nothing except the way you just interpreted compelled, namely, that there is a white local and a colored local period."
1957.7,2,33516,joseph_c_waddy,,6208.86,6212.036,I would regard that as stating a cause of action but I think we have more here --
1957.7,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6212.036,6213.893,"No, I'm not -- I'm not -- don't go beyond that."
1957.7,2,33516,joseph_c_waddy,,6213.893,6214.013,Yes.
1957.7,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6214.013,6220.202,I just want you to address yourself for the moment of an allegation or complaint that is boiled on to that?
1957.7,2,33516,joseph_c_waddy,,6220.202,6222.139,That is a compelling (Voice Overlap) --
1957.7,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6222.139,6224.963,-- a compelled segregated colored union.
1957.7,2,33516,joseph_c_waddy,,6224.963,6227.707,I would say to that in itself would state a cause of action.
1957.7,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6227.707,6234.486,"And what -- on what legal theory, on what legal -- what's the right that would have been?"
1957.7,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6234.486,6246.579,I would certainly say it would have been the requirement of the Railway Labor Act and what this Court said in the Howard case that the union could not use the provisions of the statute or to discriminate.
1957.7,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6247.428,6253.07,"Discriminate is merely -- in the make up, the racial make up of the two unions."
1957.7,2,33516,joseph_c_waddy,,6253.07,6257.336,But -- but it would be pursuant under the union shop agreement pursuant to the statutory power --
1957.7,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6257.336,6257.478,Yes.
1957.7,2,33516,joseph_c_waddy,,6257.478,6259.855,-- to compel them to join the union otherwise it couldn't compel.
1957.7,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6259.855,6260.549,No.
1957.7,2,33516,joseph_c_waddy,,6277.735,6279.429,I would certainly say.
1957.7,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6279.429,6281.395,Not if it will go to the Constitution.
1957.7,2,33516,joseph_c_waddy,,6281.395,6287.821,I would say -- I would say that if the Railway Labor Act permits it then the Railway Labor Act will be unconstitutional.
1957.7,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6287.821,6288.978,Thank you Mr. Waddy.
