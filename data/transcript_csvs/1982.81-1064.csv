1982.81-1064,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,6.951,We will hear arguments next in City of Los Angeles against Lyons.
1982.81-1064,0,24351,frederick_n_merkin,,80.296,84.217,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1982.81-1064,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,307.781,309.281,You speak of training.
1982.81-1064,0,24351,frederick_n_merkin,,312.061,315.248,"The case need not be decided on training, this case need not."
1982.81-1064,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,382.284,384.096,"Well, you had a number of deaths here, didn't you?"
1982.81-1064,0,24351,frederick_n_merkin,,384.096,387.282,"There are deaths in the record, yes."
1982.81-1064,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,387.282,388.798,"A number of them, aren't there?"
1982.81-1064,0,24351,frederick_n_merkin,,388.798,389.609,There are indeed.
1982.81-1064,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,389.609,390.422,16.
1982.81-1064,0,24351,frederick_n_merkin,,390.422,392.608,"There are at least, yes."
1982.81-1064,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,392.608,395.124,Let me ask another question.
1982.81-1064,0,24351,frederick_n_merkin,,397.029,397.638,Yes.
1982.81-1064,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,397.638,399.122,It expires in ten days.
1982.81-1064,0,24351,frederick_n_merkin,,399.122,399.872,That's right.
1982.81-1064,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,399.872,401.652,What's the city going to do then?
1982.81-1064,0,24351,frederick_n_merkin,,401.652,404.448,"I don't know, and I don't know that the city knows."
1982.81-1064,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,404.448,405.854,You're representing them.
1982.81-1064,0,24351,frederick_n_merkin,,406.276,436.293,"I don't know, and part of the reason for that is that the city submits that this is the kind of thing that is subject to reasonable debate, indeed there's a debate going on, not just within city government but to some extent nationwide; and that these decisions, especially in this particular situation, are such that there may be tentative decisions such as we have already now from the city of Los Angeles, that are subject to change and modification."
1982.81-1064,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,436.293,441.449,"Mr. Merkin, can you tell us at least who will probably make that decision--"
1982.81-1064,0,24351,frederick_n_merkin,,441.449,441.808,Yes.
1982.81-1064,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,441.808,443.182,--about which Mr. Justice Blackmun inquired?
1982.81-1064,0,24351,frederick_n_merkin,,443.182,448.352,"Yes, and I can tell you a little bit about how and on what basis that decision will be made, I believe."
1982.81-1064,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,467.687,472.873,"Is the commission holding off until this Court rules, in effect?"
1982.81-1064,0,24351,frederick_n_merkin,,472.873,473.607,No.
1982.81-1064,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,488.601,497.379,But in any events I gather there'll be no outstanding restraint which would prevent the restoration of the practice if the commission decides to restore it?
1982.81-1064,0,24351,frederick_n_merkin,,497.379,504.812,"That is correct, and the commission and the city government as a whole believes that these tactics."
1982.81-1064,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,528.882,539.551,What is the policy that you would have this Court hold the city is free to adopt if it wants to with regard to the use of these holds?
1982.81-1064,0,24351,frederick_n_merkin,,539.551,545.814,I think the policy is derived from two different notions.
1982.81-1064,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,552.498,553.295,"No, no."
1982.81-1064,0,24351,frederick_n_merkin,,566.806,583.454,"--Returning to the description of the control holds themselves, the latitude that I think, Justice O'Connor, that we speak of is to use the holds in circumstances such as they were most recently used before."
1982.81-1064,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,606.43,618.847,Would it be all right if the rule said that they should only use it unless the application of such force is necessary to prevent serious bodily harm to the opinion?
1982.81-1064,0,24351,frederick_n_merkin,,620.003,622.861,"That is a reasonable approach, but it's not--"
1982.81-1064,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,622.861,626.0,"Well, isn't that what the court said?"
1982.81-1064,0,24351,frederick_n_merkin,,626.0,627.391,"--That is what the court said, but the court--"
1982.81-1064,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,627.391,629.296,"That's what the court said, didn't it?"
1982.81-1064,0,24351,frederick_n_merkin,,629.296,631.921,"--The district court did make that determination, yes."
1982.81-1064,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,631.921,632.623,"Well, what's wrong with it?"
1982.81-1064,0,24351,frederick_n_merkin,,632.623,633.826,There are two problems.
1982.81-1064,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,633.826,634.685,You just said it was all right.
1982.81-1064,0,24351,frederick_n_merkin,,634.685,638.48,"There are two problems wrong with that, Mr. Justice Marshall."
1982.81-1064,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,650.069,651.537,"Excuse me, Mr. Merkin."
1982.81-1064,0,24351,frederick_n_merkin,,664.33,664.673,--Yes.
1982.81-1064,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,664.673,667.859,"Everything that you used to be able to do, you want still to do."
1982.81-1064,0,24351,frederick_n_merkin,,667.859,669.375,"Constitutionally, yes."
1982.81-1064,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,669.375,673.294,"And you want us to say that you're free to do it, isn't that right?"
1982.81-1064,0,24351,frederick_n_merkin,,673.294,676.246,"Well, that the policy that was followed, yes."
1982.81-1064,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,676.246,682.775,You want us to say that constitutionally you're completely free to follow the practice you followed before you were enjoined?
1982.81-1064,0,24351,frederick_n_merkin,,682.775,684.556,"That is correct, yes."
1982.81-1064,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,684.556,688.053,Subject to being sued by people who are injured.
1982.81-1064,0,24351,frederick_n_merkin,,688.053,693.63,"Subject to being sued and defending those suits in, for example, a damages action brought under the Monell decision."
1982.81-1064,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,693.63,698.221,"Well, what recourse does a man have whom you kill?"
1982.81-1064,0,24351,frederick_n_merkin,,705.203,711.405,"Well, the individual, the deceased him or herself does not have any personal recourse, of course."
1982.81-1064,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,729.195,746.094,"Well, isn't the answer to the question that the decedents' representatives would have the same right as though a police car had negligently run them down on the street and killed them in the our suit of someone else?"
1982.81-1064,0,24351,frederick_n_merkin,,749.093,750.342,"--No, we do not."
1982.81-1064,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,750.342,750.998,Thank you.
1982.81-1064,0,24351,frederick_n_merkin,,762.525,762.821,Yes.
1982.81-1064,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,762.821,765.399,--which has been affirmed by the Court of Appeals.
1982.81-1064,0,24351,frederick_n_merkin,,771.194,771.412,Yes.
1982.81-1064,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,771.412,774.207,You're asking us to say some of the findings are clearly erroneous?
1982.81-1064,0,24351,frederick_n_merkin,,792.388,793.028,That's quite correct.
1982.81-1064,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,835.37,849.428,"The thing that puzzles me is, you brought the case up by appeal, rather than taking advantage of the normal opportunity of a trial litigant to adduce additional evidence at the trial court level and straighten out all these factual matters."
1982.81-1064,0,24351,frederick_n_merkin,,865.342,869.419,"--Mr. Justice Stevens, to that I would say there are really two issues we brought to the Court."
1982.81-1064,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,882.742,886.288,"You're saying that no one would have standing to challenge this practice, is that right?"
1982.81-1064,0,24351,frederick_n_merkin,,886.288,891.083,"By declaratory or injunctive relief, no."
1982.81-1064,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,896.722,897.331,No one could challenge it.
1982.81-1064,0,24351,frederick_n_merkin,,901.171,901.968,--Because it is remote.
1982.81-1064,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,903.328,904.702,"Well, there are 16 cases."
1982.81-1064,0,24351,frederick_n_merkin,,907.872,910.434,"I can't give you a mathematical formula, Mr. Justice Stevens."
1982.81-1064,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,938.018,940.484,"Does that figure appear in the record, Mr. Merkin?"
1982.81-1064,0,24351,frederick_n_merkin,,946.857,948.699,--We know by extrapolation.
1982.81-1064,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,967.567,972.268,"Mrs. Merkin, if you're talking about standing, you don't have to get killed to have standing."
1982.81-1064,0,24351,frederick_n_merkin,,1000.413,1006.395,You cannot sue for equitable relief in circumstances where the threat of injury is so remote.
1982.81-1064,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1006.395,1009.285,"But there's some injury to everybody who's subjected to it, isn't there?"
1982.81-1064,0,24351,frederick_n_merkin,,1014.001,1017.938,"There is a possibility of injury indeed, okay."
1982.81-1064,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1018.967,1028.12,"But only 935 people have been hurt, so we don't think there's a sufficient probability to justify anybody having standing to litigate, to challenge the practice?"
1982.81-1064,0,24351,frederick_n_merkin,,1030.275,1032.978,--We're talking about the Constitution.
1982.81-1064,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1032.978,1033.993,Yes.
1982.81-1064,0,24351,frederick_n_merkin,,1033.993,1040.24,"And the Constitution talks about... truly, it speaks relatively, I think, in this area, the compared to what."
1982.81-1064,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1040.24,1047.801,"The Constitution speaks of ""individual rights"", ""individual""."
1982.81-1064,0,24351,frederick_n_merkin,,1047.801,1049.486,"Yes, Mr. Justice Marshall."
1982.81-1064,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1049.486,1054.657,"So each one of those 900 would have a constitutional right, wouldn't they?"
1982.81-1064,0,24351,frederick_n_merkin,,1054.657,1065.386,"But see, I think standing... and the Court's decisions seem to suggest this, Mr. Justice Marshall and Mr. Justice Stevens, require that the threat to the individual be quite meaningful."
1982.81-1064,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1069.573,1073.071,"Well, when the police puts his arm around my neck, can I object then?"
1982.81-1064,0,24351,frederick_n_merkin,,1073.071,1075.944,"--You can object, certainly."
1982.81-1064,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1075.944,1114.741,"Mr. Merkin, there was a motion in this case to dismiss the writ as improvidently granted or dismiss on the grounds of mootness, and as I read the Respondent's brief they assert not that the case is actually moot in the technical sense, because of course I guess there's an action for damages pending, but that the need for the preliminary injunction has disappeared in view of the department's change of policy, and therefore that we should simply vacate the preliminary injunction and presumably let the case proceed in the district court."
1982.81-1064,0,24351,frederick_n_merkin,,1133.343,1135.124,"Yes, Mr. Justice Rehnquist."
1982.81-1064,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1178.67,1191.381,"Mr. Merkin, the policy of using these control holds is based... is expressed in the regulations or the training manual, isn't it?"
1982.81-1064,0,24351,frederick_n_merkin,,1191.381,1191.616,Yes.
1982.81-1064,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1191.616,1197.645,And they are authorized only in order to overcome resistance?
1982.81-1064,0,24351,frederick_n_merkin,,1197.645,1200.269,"Yes, generally."
1982.81-1064,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1200.269,1202.16,"Well, that's the policy."
1982.81-1064,0,24351,frederick_n_merkin,,1202.955,1206.016,That's not the full panoply of the policy.
1982.81-1064,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1207.329,1220.497,"Well, is an officer free to... according to the policy, is an officer free to apply a control hold to a person he's arresting for a traffic offense who is entirely peaceful?"
1982.81-1064,0,24351,frederick_n_merkin,,1220.497,1221.338,Of course not.
1982.81-1064,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1221.338,1226.181,Would that violate... that would violate the regulations?
1982.81-1064,0,24351,frederick_n_merkin,,1226.181,1232.069,"It would be out of policy indeed, Mr. Justice White, and probably... it could be unconstitutional."
1982.81-1064,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1232.069,1246.657,"Would a person to whom the control hold is erroneously applied, erroneously in terms of what he's told to do, would a person who is subjected to that kind of control hold have a cause of action under California law?"
1982.81-1064,0,24351,frederick_n_merkin,,1246.657,1247.173,Yes.
1982.81-1064,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1257.356,1264.29,"Well now, do you think the injunction forbids the use of the control holds at all?"
1982.81-1064,0,24351,frederick_n_merkin,,1267.477,1268.054,"No, it does not."
1982.81-1064,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1268.054,1269.022,What does it do?
1982.81-1064,0,24351,frederick_n_merkin,,1272.428,1273.77,No.
1982.81-1064,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1273.77,1275.067,What does it say?
1982.81-1064,0,24351,frederick_n_merkin,,1275.067,1276.176,It rewrites the regulation.
1982.81-1064,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1293.732,1295.403,The training bulletin says:
1982.81-1064,0,24351,frederick_n_merkin,,1310.318,1311.6,--Apparently so.
1982.81-1064,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1349.709,1351.816,Doesn't the gun sort of get control?
1982.81-1064,0,24351,frederick_n_merkin,,1351.816,1354.988,"Excuse me, Mr. Justice Marshall?"
1982.81-1064,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1354.988,1357.689,Doesn't a loaded gun usually get control?
1982.81-1064,0,24351,frederick_n_merkin,,1357.689,1359.72,"It usually does, when people are acting rationally."
1982.81-1064,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1359.72,1362.422,Why do you have to choke him to death?
1982.81-1064,0,24351,frederick_n_merkin,,1362.422,1364.953,"Well, you don't have to choke people to death."
1982.81-1064,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1384.85,1394.332,"If you're looking at the city policy or what the rules are, the governing rule about the control holds, a person is not going to have a control hold applied to him unless he resists."
1982.81-1064,0,24351,frederick_n_merkin,,1394.332,1397.08,Almost always--
1982.81-1064,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1397.08,1399.376,Isn't that what the training manual says?
1982.81-1064,0,24351,frederick_n_merkin,,1399.376,1401.094,"--Yes, that's the policy."
1982.81-1064,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1401.094,1419.415,"And so you have to count... as far as the city's liability is concerned or as far as the validity of the policy is concerned, the control hold is only applied, supposedly, if there's been resistance to the arrest."
1982.81-1064,0,24351,frederick_n_merkin,,1419.415,1434.018,"Yes, but there's one additional predicate I would add here, that it's only where the officer has tried lower force techniques and they failed, or at the time it just didn't seem reasonable to try to twist the arm or bend the wrist to cause pain."
1982.81-1064,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1440.25,1443.952,"Well, again... again, my question still stands."
1982.81-1064,0,24351,frederick_n_merkin,,1451.574,1453.324,"When it's necessary to use force, that is correct."
1982.81-1064,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1457.23,1469.349,"Well, if the person to be arrested or confronted is entirely peaceful, there would never be an occasion to use a control hold, as far as the policy is concerned."
1982.81-1064,0,24351,frederick_n_merkin,,1469.349,1478.969,"That is correct, and that is Respondent's... Respondent's charge here is that when he had his encounter with the officer department the control hold was put on for no reason whatsoever, that he did nothing to prompt it."
1982.81-1064,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1478.969,1481.921,"That's a violation of the regulation, or it's a violation of his duty."
1982.81-1064,0,24351,frederick_n_merkin,,1481.921,1482.546,Exactly.
1982.81-1064,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1491.011,1505.506,"Well, in terms of standing, in terms of showing some future risk to himself, he would have to show that, not only that he is liable to be stopped for a traffic incident again, but another policeman is likely to disobey his orders."
1982.81-1064,0,24351,frederick_n_merkin,,1505.506,1507.598,"There are two cases he's bringing, in a sense."
1982.81-1064,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1518.141,1518.532,"Well, I know."
1982.81-1064,0,24351,frederick_n_merkin,,1526.435,1527.669,That's correct.
1982.81-1064,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1527.669,1532.058,"That he resists, and in short that he is committing an illegal act himself."
1982.81-1064,0,24351,frederick_n_merkin,,1532.058,1532.558,Yes.
1982.81-1064,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1565.559,1566.341,To the same person.
1982.81-1064,0,24351,frederick_n_merkin,,1566.341,1567.902,To the same person.
1982.81-1064,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1567.902,1570.994,There was no class certification here?
1982.81-1064,0,24351,frederick_n_merkin,,1570.994,1573.072,There was no class certification.
1982.81-1064,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1576.946,1583.975,Mr. Mitchell.
1982.81-1064,1,36383,michael_r_mitchell,,1583.975,1586.708,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1982.81-1064,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1604.263,1605.731,But it would like to cease complying.
1982.81-1064,1,36383,michael_r_mitchell,,1605.731,1607.372,--Pardon?
1982.81-1064,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1607.372,1608.919,It would like to cease complying.
1982.81-1064,1,36383,michael_r_mitchell,,1620.477,1623.069,"No, that's not correct, Justice White."
1982.81-1064,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1637.361,1642.343,"Well, when did the moratorium occur, before or after the entry of the preliminary injunction?"
1982.81-1064,1,36383,michael_r_mitchell,,1642.343,1646.497,"After entry of the preliminary, by a year and a half."
1982.81-1064,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1648.154,1649.122,"It had been stayed, hadn't it?"
1982.81-1064,1,36383,michael_r_mitchell,,1650.777,1652.51,--The injunction has always been stayed.
1982.81-1064,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1653.135,1654.072,"So it was a voluntary decision, then?"
1982.81-1064,1,36383,michael_r_mitchell,,1654.072,1654.604,--Correct.
1982.81-1064,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1654.604,1663.726,"Mr. Mitchell, from my point of view the threshold question here is the standing to bring this case."
1982.81-1064,1,36383,michael_r_mitchell,,1712.282,1715.625,"Well, Your Honor, it's a complex question."
1982.81-1064,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1725.231,1733.822,"Let's assume, then, that on one occasion a police car in hot pursuit collided with his car and did very substantial damage and injured him."
1982.81-1064,1,36383,michael_r_mitchell,,1739.491,1742.161,"Well, it's certainly not--"
1982.81-1064,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1742.161,1743.614,Other than for damages?
1982.81-1064,1,36383,michael_r_mitchell,,1755.236,1763.731,"--No, Your Honor, he would not, because that policy would not be that police cars collide broadside with citizens' cars."
1982.81-1064,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1777.976,1789.971,"But the rule is, as I understand it, the rule is that you are not supposed to apply these control holds, you're not supposed to choke them, unless it's necessary to overcome resistance."
1982.81-1064,1,36383,michael_r_mitchell,,1789.971,1800.171,"Your Honor, if you'll look at the record, the city training officer says that, Mr. Speer... his deposition is at page--"
1982.81-1064,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1800.171,1801.39,"Well, is the policy written or isn't it?"
1982.81-1064,1,36383,michael_r_mitchell,,1801.39,1803.404,"--It's written several different ways, Your Honor."
1982.81-1064,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1803.935,1805.325,Where is it in the record?
1982.81-1064,1,36383,michael_r_mitchell,,1805.325,1827.362,"At number 74, page 21, 30, and 91 in the official record, and the training bulletin... the training bulletin, at the city's petition for cert, 41A in the appendix."
1982.81-1064,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1829.315,1834.297,"You say that 41A, is that policy the city policy or isn't it?"
1982.81-1064,1,36383,michael_r_mitchell,,1834.297,1835.875,"Well, it's not the city policy today."
1982.81-1064,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1835.875,1837.389,"Well, I know, but was it?"
1982.81-1064,1,36383,michael_r_mitchell,,1841.232,1847.964,To subdue any resistance or if an officer felt a bodily attack was going to be made upon him.
1982.81-1064,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1852.211,1860.958,"So if a person... if an officer simply applies the control hold for no reason whatsoever, he's disobeying his instructions."
1982.81-1064,1,36383,michael_r_mitchell,,1860.958,1861.646,Absolutely.
1982.81-1064,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1984.611,1986.189,"It was a traffic violation, wasn't it?"
1982.81-1064,1,36383,michael_r_mitchell,,1986.189,1988.219,"--Yes, it was, for a traffic violation."
1982.81-1064,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2018.473,2035.139,"Mr. Mitchell, was it the position of the Respondent for purposes of getting the preliminary injunction that the Los Angeles city police routinely use these choke holds for routine traffic stops?"
1982.81-1064,1,36383,michael_r_mitchell,,2035.139,2039.793,"No, it was not, Your Honor, not that they did that routinely."
1982.81-1064,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2049.914,2059.299,"And in any event, Mr. Lyons would continue to have his damages action, would he not?"
1982.81-1064,1,36383,michael_r_mitchell,,2059.299,2062.266,"If he lives, if he lives."
1982.81-1064,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2117.229,2129.412,"Was there any evidence in the record, Mr. Mitchell, about the conduct of these various people that had the fatal consequences?"
1982.81-1064,1,36383,michael_r_mitchell,,2139.751,2164.336,"Your Honor, the record shows that apparently several of them were under the influence of various drugs, and that may have well contributed to their deaths, because when you're under the influence of narcotic-type drugs, including alcohol, you're insensitive to paint and so when a police officer puts a choke hold on you and seeks to obtain your compliance by causing you paint like that bar arm control, you don't feel it."
1982.81-1064,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2303.216,2304.7,How can you say that?
1982.81-1064,1,36383,michael_r_mitchell,,2310.65,2315.853,Because I have seen... and it's not in the record... the massive outrage and outcry of that community.
1982.81-1064,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2319.85,2322.896,"You would not object, then, to vacating the injunction?"
1982.81-1064,1,36383,michael_r_mitchell,,2325.706,2326.409,That's correct.
1982.81-1064,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2326.409,2331.424,But I don't know when the stay expires.
1982.81-1064,1,36383,michael_r_mitchell,,2339.421,2339.937,Not in the least.
1982.81-1064,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2339.937,2345.622,"Well, how would we... on what basis would we vacate the injunction, that the case is just not ripe?"
1982.81-1064,1,36383,michael_r_mitchell,,2348.543,2356.039,"I can say it's moot, Your Honor, because my client walks the streets of Los Angeles these days with none of that fear that he had before."
1982.81-1064,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2358.929,2366.224,"Well, I don't know how we can do that, how we have all that knowledge of what the reality is in Los Angeles."
1982.81-1064,1,36383,michael_r_mitchell,,2366.224,2368.94,He has no controversy any more.
1982.81-1064,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2370.814,2372.875,"Well, I don't quite understand."
1982.81-1064,1,36383,michael_r_mitchell,,2383.2,2386.668,"Well, there are several counts down there for damages that remain."
1982.81-1064,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2387.964,2398.398,"Oh, then as far as you would go would be vacate the injunction, but otherwise let the lawsuit proceed, is that it?"
1982.81-1064,1,36383,michael_r_mitchell,,2398.398,2399.054,"Yes, Your Honor."
1982.81-1064,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2399.054,2401.162,Does your client agree with you?
1982.81-1064,1,36383,michael_r_mitchell,,2401.162,2402.66,Your Honor?
1982.81-1064,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2402.66,2405.129,Does your client agree with you?
1982.81-1064,1,36383,michael_r_mitchell,,2405.129,2407.44,That it should be dismissed at this point?
1982.81-1064,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2407.44,2407.691,Yes.
1982.81-1064,1,36383,michael_r_mitchell,,2407.691,2408.532,"Yes, Your Honor, he does."
1982.81-1064,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2408.532,2410.017,When did he tell you that?
1982.81-1064,1,36383,michael_r_mitchell,,2410.017,2412.453,After the moratorium was imposed.
1982.81-1064,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2414.483,2416.343,What's his position right now?
1982.81-1064,1,36383,michael_r_mitchell,,2420.309,2425.402,"--I haven't spoken to him this morning, Your Honor, but I don't think that his position has changed."
1982.81-1064,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2436.023,2449.001,"Well, isn't that itself more or less a confession that the Kamenish doctrine really doesn't apply to you and that there is a real prospect that the moratorium could shift, and if it does you'll be back in district court right away?"
1982.81-1064,1,36383,michael_r_mitchell,,2449.001,2453.624,"Justice Rehnquist, there's chances that they could do hundreds and hundreds of different things."
1982.81-1064,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2464.948,2480.161,"Under your suggested disposition, if we vacate it and you go back to trial, I gather all of the issues, constitutional and everything else, would have to be resolved in any event by the district court in the first instance, would they not?"
1982.81-1064,1,36383,michael_r_mitchell,,2493.951,2500.058,"--Your Honor, the way the complaint is drafted, those are not raised with respect to the primary count, count one."
1982.81-1064,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2507.165,2508.477,In this specific instance.
1982.81-1064,1,36383,michael_r_mitchell,,2508.477,2509.633,In this specific instance.
1982.81-1064,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2509.633,2514.646,Is this a 1983 suit?
1982.81-1064,1,36383,michael_r_mitchell,,2515.162,2516.49,"Yes, it's a 1983 suit."
1982.81-1064,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2516.49,2526.517,I guess it's your position that all that's gone on in the past in this case is just wasted effort?
1982.81-1064,1,36383,michael_r_mitchell,,2526.517,2528.924,"No, Your Honor, I don't take that position at all."
1982.81-1064,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2528.924,2530.343,I don't see what else you can say.
1982.81-1064,1,36383,michael_r_mitchell,,2536.169,2537.466,"Since 1977, Your Honor."
1982.81-1064,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2537.466,2540.449,And all of that's just going to be washed down the drain?
1982.81-1064,1,36383,michael_r_mitchell,,2540.449,2542.572,"Your Honor, I think this case--"
1982.81-1064,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2542.572,2545.681,You say you'll start again after the moratorium's lifted?
1982.81-1064,1,36383,michael_r_mitchell,,2545.681,2548.461,"--Your Honor, if it's lifted we will."
1982.81-1064,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2548.461,2548.945,Didn't you just say that?
1982.81-1064,1,36383,michael_r_mitchell,,2548.945,2549.43,"Yes, we will."
1982.81-1064,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2549.43,2554.053,So you wasted your time and you've wasted other people's time all along.
1982.81-1064,1,36383,michael_r_mitchell,,2554.053,2555.77,"No, Your Honor."
1982.81-1064,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2556.614,2558.192,"Well, I object to you wasting mine."
1982.81-1064,1,36383,michael_r_mitchell,,2572.342,2573.403,"--Well, Your Honor--"
1982.81-1064,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2573.403,2577.777,"I don't suppose... you don't know for sure what the judge will do, if you have to prove your case all over again."
1982.81-1064,1,36383,michael_r_mitchell,,2577.777,2584.587,"--Your Honor, my understanding is that on the 9th of November the police commission must make a decision as to whether the moratorium is lifted or not."
1982.81-1064,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2584.587,2587.008,"Supposing they say, we're going to lift it."
1982.81-1064,1,36383,michael_r_mitchell,,2591.427,2591.724,"No, Your Honor."
1982.81-1064,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2598.987,2603.236,"Yes, but you may not get it, and you're saying you don't care if we lift the one that's now protecting your client."
1982.81-1064,1,36383,michael_r_mitchell,,2603.236,2605.142,This one has never been in effect.
1982.81-1064,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2605.142,2606.173,"Well, because it's been stayed."
1982.81-1064,1,36383,michael_r_mitchell,,2625.791,2626.274,Indeed.
1982.81-1064,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2626.274,2632.147,So you'll be back in the district court if you have to bet but you think the chances are 99 out of 100 that you won't have to be?
1982.81-1064,1,36383,michael_r_mitchell,,2632.147,2632.772,Precisely.
1982.81-1064,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2632.772,2636.567,"That also is very relevant to your standing, too, isn't it?"
1982.81-1064,1,36383,michael_r_mitchell,,2636.567,2638.128,Standing to be here today?
1982.81-1064,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2638.128,2638.878,To ask for an injunction.
1982.81-1064,1,36383,michael_r_mitchell,,2648.875,2650.468,Because the city has changed its policy.
1982.81-1064,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2650.468,2651.578,Yes.
1982.81-1064,1,36383,michael_r_mitchell,,2651.578,2652.982,And now it only chokes when it should.
1982.81-1064,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2652.982,2662.432,"It not only has changed its policy, but you say you have no fear with respect to its present policy."
1982.81-1064,1,36383,michael_r_mitchell,,2662.432,2662.948,Correct.
1982.81-1064,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2662.948,2665.118,So you don't need an injunction.
1982.81-1064,1,36383,michael_r_mitchell,,2665.118,2665.696,Absolutely.
1982.81-1064,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2665.696,2670.772,When will you get to trial on your case in the ordinary course of events down there?
1982.81-1064,1,36383,michael_r_mitchell,,2670.772,2676.098,"With that calendar, probably not until next summer, late spring."
1982.81-1064,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2676.098,2679.956,"It's going to be a protracted trial, I gather?"
1982.81-1064,1,36383,michael_r_mitchell,,2679.956,2680.816,I'm sorry?
1982.81-1064,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2680.816,2682.049,It's going to be a long trial?
1982.81-1064,1,36383,michael_r_mitchell,,2682.049,2683.924,"Yes, Your Honor, I expect it will be."
1982.81-1064,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2683.924,2688.016,The city indicates it'll go on for a very long time.
1982.81-1064,1,36383,michael_r_mitchell,,2692.843,2697.902,"Yes, Your Honor, assuming the moratorium is not lifted, absolutely."
1982.81-1064,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2805.484,2816.198,"Mr. Mitchell, am I right, the only judgment before us is the judgment of the Court of Appeals affirming the preliminary injunction, isn't it?"
1982.81-1064,1,36383,michael_r_mitchell,,2816.198,2817.854,--Yes.
1982.81-1064,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2817.854,2824.273,"And there was another judgment, was there not, that's not here at this time?"
1982.81-1064,1,36383,michael_r_mitchell,,2824.273,2826.755,"Justice Brennan, there was a Lyons I, if you like--"
1982.81-1064,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2826.755,2827.271,Yes.
1982.81-1064,1,36383,michael_r_mitchell,,2827.271,2830.082,--where the court did reinstitute the lawsuit.
1982.81-1064,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2834.566,2841.236,"But the only one before us now is the affirmance by the Ninth Circuit of the preliminary injunction, isn't it?"
1982.81-1064,1,36383,michael_r_mitchell,,2841.236,2843.672,"No, Your Honor, I think they're both before you now."
1982.81-1064,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2845.811,2848.029,"Well, what do we do with the other one under your submission?"
1982.81-1064,1,36383,michael_r_mitchell,,2848.029,2854.761,"--Well, if you dismiss as improvidently granted and vacate the injunction, you needn't do anything else."
1982.81-1064,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2854.761,2858.916,"Well, we're not dismissing as improvidently granted if we vacate the injunction."
1982.81-1064,1,36383,michael_r_mitchell,,2858.916,2860.007,I beg your pardon?
1982.81-1064,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2860.007,2864.35,"We're not dismissing as improvidently granted if we vacate the injunction, are we?"
1982.81-1064,1,36383,michael_r_mitchell,,2866.833,2868.677,Indeed.
1982.81-1064,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2873.722,2895.057,"Mr. Mitchell, if every policeman on the beat had carried out the instructions in the manual that Justice White read earlier in the argument, would there be any problem, that is, that it's used only when it's necessary to subdue violence?"
1982.81-1064,1,36383,michael_r_mitchell,,2895.057,2899.587,That wasn't the words I heard Justice White read.
1982.81-1064,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2899.587,2900.931,"Well, that's the essence of it, isn't it?"
1982.81-1064,1,36383,michael_r_mitchell,,2900.931,2903.554,The essence is to subdue any resistance.
1982.81-1064,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2909.631,2914.987,"Well, it says ""necessary to subdue resistance"", ""necessary""."
1982.81-1064,1,36383,michael_r_mitchell,,2918.861,2928.435,"Mr. Justice White, a police officer may subjectively feel that it's necessary for him to choke a black man on the streets of Los Angeles because--"
1982.81-1064,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2928.435,2933.433,That isn't what the bulletin says.
1982.81-1064,1,36383,michael_r_mitchell,,2938.337,2940.15,"--Well, combined with the--"
1982.81-1064,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2940.15,2940.868,It may be objectively.
1982.81-1064,1,36383,michael_r_mitchell,,2942.711,2944.132,"--I don't think it is, Your Honor."
1982.81-1064,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2945.991,2948.13,You'll find out in your trial.
1982.81-1064,1,36383,michael_r_mitchell,,2950.114,2957.877,"--Well, I don't think you should leave people to a damage remedy in a situation like this, not with this overwhelming threat."
1982.81-1064,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2960.486,2964.202,"Well, this overwhelming threat that you say you don't need any protection against any more."
1982.81-1064,1,36383,michael_r_mitchell,,2964.202,2967.654,"--Well, it's gone, and hopefully it'll be gone forever."
1982.81-1064,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2970.776,2972.855,"Do you have anything further, Mr. Merkin?"
1982.81-1064,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2972.855,2974.072,"Excuse me, Mr. Merkin."
1982.81-1064,2,24351,frederick_n_merkin,,2981.133,2983.21,"The one you stated, Mr. Justice Brennan."
1982.81-1064,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2989.661,2990.333,Not no.
1982.81-1064,2,24351,frederick_n_merkin,,2993.191,2994.191,--No other judgments.
1982.81-1064,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2994.191,2994.518,That's the only one.
1982.81-1064,2,24351,frederick_n_merkin,,2994.518,2995.549,"Only judgment, yes."
1982.81-1064,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2995.549,2996.721,And that is stayed by the courts.
1982.81-1064,2,24351,frederick_n_merkin,,2996.721,2997.548,And that is stayed.
1982.81-1064,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2997.548,3000.905,But there's a special standing issue even in that judgment.
1982.81-1064,2,24351,frederick_n_merkin,,3000.905,3002.172,That's right.
1982.81-1064,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3073.83,3078.328,Respondent could have said that when you filed your petition for certiorari.
1982.81-1064,2,24351,frederick_n_merkin,,3083.466,3084.888,"--Well, I--"
1982.81-1064,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3084.888,3088.573,"Couldn't respondent have said we don't care about the injunction, and let it go."
1982.81-1064,2,24351,frederick_n_merkin,,3088.573,3091.665,"--Respondent could have said that, yes."
1982.81-1064,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3091.665,3092.962,"You wouldn't be up here, would you?"
1982.81-1064,2,24351,frederick_n_merkin,,3092.962,3093.274,That's right.
1982.81-1064,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3093.274,3098.976,"I think in fairness to respondent, though, the moratorium hadn't taken place at the time you filed your petition, had it?"
1982.81-1064,2,24351,frederick_n_merkin,,3098.976,3100.288,I don't believe so.
1982.81-1064,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3121.014,3125.107,And we didn't take action on that motion.
1982.81-1064,2,24351,frederick_n_merkin,,3125.107,3125.591,That's right.
1982.81-1064,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3127.106,3138.819,"Mr. Merkin, do you think we could safely assume, in view of what's been said in court today, that if we were to dismiss the write as improperly granted, that your opponent means what he says and he would just go in and move to dismiss the injunction before the district court?"
1982.81-1064,2,24351,frederick_n_merkin,,3140.303,3142.021,I don't think that's a fair assumption.
1982.81-1064,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3142.583,3146.629,"He's, in effect, represented to the Court that he's prepared to do that, as I understand what he said."
1982.81-1064,2,24351,frederick_n_merkin,,3157.906,3168.574,"--Mr. Justice Stevens, I think he's saying vacate... he's not concerned about the preliminary injunction, but his primary causes for declaratory injunctive relief I think he still wishes to pursue."
1982.81-1064,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3173.711,3181.427,It would seem to me that a couple of good lawyers would be able to settle this case and save the damage issue without requiring this Court to do very much about it.
1982.81-1064,2,24351,frederick_n_merkin,,3181.427,3188.205,"Well, there is a problem that the city faces with respect to the doctrines enunciated by the Ninth Circuit."
1982.81-1064,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3199.108,3201.919,"That narrows your complaint down to the standing issue, then, doesn't it?"
1982.81-1064,2,24351,frederick_n_merkin,,3201.919,3203.606,"Well, that--"
1982.81-1064,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3203.606,3207.417,You'd like an advisory opinion on the standing issue is what I understand.
1982.81-1064,2,24351,frederick_n_merkin,,3207.417,3209.431,--I don't believe it's advisory.
1982.81-1064,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3209.431,3212.742,Maybe you'll get a different panel in the Ninth Circuit next time.
1982.81-1064,2,24351,frederick_n_merkin,,3214.133,3214.289,Perhaps.
1982.81-1064,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3220.521,3222.973,"Thank you, gentlemen, the case is submitted."
