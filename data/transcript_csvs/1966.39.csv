1966.39,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,41.758,"Number 39, Abbott Laboratories et al., Petitioners versus John W. Gardner, Secretary of Health Education Welfare et al."
1966.39,0,25401,gerhard_a_gessell,,43.014,47.747,"Mr. Chief Justice, May it please the Court."
1966.39,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,120.133,122.04,"They asked for a declaratory judgment, didn't they?"
1966.39,0,25401,gerhard_a_gessell,,122.04,128.591,Declaratory judgment and an injunction Mr. Justice Stewart under the Administrative Procedure Act.
1966.39,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,221.598,223.33,"Reprehensible, Mr. Gessell?"
1966.39,0,25401,gerhard_a_gessell,,223.33,226.864,I think it's seriously reprehensible Mr. Justice Fortas.
1966.39,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,684.141,689.228,"And Judge Friendly saw no real distinction between your case and his case, did he?"
1966.39,0,25401,gerhard_a_gessell,,689.228,715.247,"On the question of the rightness Mr. Justice Stewart, of the controversy, there are substantial differences between the two proceedings (Voice Overlap) but on the questions of whether this type of threat from a regulation creates a right controversy, there was agreement -- there is agreement, and the two cases are all the same."
1966.39,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,715.247,720.701,"Well, you agree and Judge Friendly agrees, I think counsel in the next case don't entirely agree."
1966.39,0,25401,gerhard_a_gessell,,720.701,734.244,Counsel in the next case have a very trouble some problem because they have numerous factual issues and they seek to distinguish the two cases I suppose because of that.
1966.39,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,750.575,770.878,"What do you -- how do you draw the line Mr. Gessell between administrative actions that are reviewable on injunction and administrative actions where you have to wait until summing -- the actions taken by the agency, what's the -- how would you define it as theoretical or general manner?"
1966.39,0,25401,gerhard_a_gessell,,770.878,785.097,"Well, as I read the Administrative Procedure Act to start there, if the process of rule making is complete, this Court has said that is a final agency action."
1966.39,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,785.097,790.344,Would you apply it only in the cases where there has been rule making?
1966.39,0,25401,gerhard_a_gessell,,790.344,792.815,I think that is all we have before us here --
1966.39,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,792.815,792.878,"Well, how --"
1966.39,0,25401,gerhard_a_gessell,,792.878,805.905,-- I am sure there are types of -- there are types of agency action short of rule making which perhaps because of their emergency character or something else would fall in a different basis.
1966.39,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,805.905,807.404,"Well, let's go to another field."
1966.39,0,25401,gerhard_a_gessell,,856.623,857.436,"Oh, yes and it is --"
1966.39,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,857.436,860.233,-- that is now -- that is a novel position --
1966.39,0,25401,gerhard_a_gessell,,860.233,860.495,No.
1966.39,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,860.495,861.933,Isn't that an administrative law?
1966.39,0,25401,gerhard_a_gessell,,861.933,862.681,"No, it is."
1966.39,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,863.451,863.616,"Well, tell me --"
1966.39,0,25401,gerhard_a_gessell,,863.616,863.824,-- of this --
1966.39,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,863.824,865.547,"Well, tell me what supports it?"
1966.39,0,25401,gerhard_a_gessell,,876.969,877.937,No.
1966.39,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,924.542,925.002,No --
1966.39,0,25401,gerhard_a_gessell,,925.002,927.257,-- decided without enforcement of the regulations.
1966.39,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,927.257,927.711,Yes.
1966.39,0,25401,gerhard_a_gessell,,967.282,967.575,"No, we just say --"
1966.39,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,967.575,968.192,Or do you mean --
1966.39,0,25401,gerhard_a_gessell,,968.192,979.495,"-- that the statute doesn't permit this, that in terms of the merit in broadcasting, this goes beyond and that there is no power on the part of the Secretary --"
1966.39,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,979.495,979.697,Would you want --
1966.39,0,25401,gerhard_a_gessell,,979.697,982.748,-- to change the meaning of the statute.
1966.39,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,982.748,987.312,You raise the question of the reasonableness of the regulation?
1966.39,0,25401,gerhard_a_gessell,,988.274,992.442,"Well, we -- we consider it unreasonable but the way the case has come up there isn't any --"
1966.39,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,992.442,995.315,"I am not asking what you consider, do you so allege?"
1966.39,0,25401,gerhard_a_gessell,,995.315,995.98,Yes we do.
1966.39,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,995.98,996.964,Alright.
1966.39,0,25401,gerhard_a_gessell,,1020.069,1024.038,"Well, I think not for two reasons."
1966.39,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1036.58,1038.239,You mean the Commissioner concedes --
1966.39,0,25401,gerhard_a_gessell,,1038.239,1038.829,Yes --
1966.39,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1038.829,1038.941,-- that this is --
1966.39,0,25401,gerhard_a_gessell,,1038.941,1045.357,-- the cross motions for summary judgment here and all of our allegations of our complaint are accepted as fact.
1966.39,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1045.357,1052.232,"Well, that's kind of extraordinary isn't it that Commissioner would concede that his own regulation is confusing?"
1966.39,0,25401,gerhard_a_gessell,,1052.232,1058.359,"Well, Your Honor I think the reason for it, I think it isn't extraordinary because it is confusing."
1966.39,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1427.913,1431.818,"Mr. Gessell, you may continue your argument."
1966.39,0,25401,gerhard_a_gessell,,1431.818,1447.862,"My colleagues over lunch hour, indicated I may have missed the import of one of your questions Mr. Justice Fortas or at least I have not made clear one point that's essential to our position."
1966.39,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1491.255,1491.761,What is --
1966.39,0,25401,gerhard_a_gessell,,1491.761,1492.133,-- some of that.
1966.39,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1492.133,1495.222,What is the definition of drug in the Act?
1966.39,0,25401,gerhard_a_gessell,,1495.222,1511.447,"Well, here we're concerned with prescription drugs and those are the drugs you normally know Mr. Justice Douglas as sold by prescription and of course the audience to which this literature is directed, either advertising or labeling is to the position."
1966.39,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1534.111,1542.328,This has nothing to do with the label that appears upon the bottle that you get at the drugstore and the filling of prescription?
1966.39,0,25401,gerhard_a_gessell,,1542.328,1545.043,It will be on that -- it will be on that label.
1966.39,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1553.804,1557.737,"But prescription is used technically -- do you mean that, which is prescribed by a physician --"
1966.39,0,25401,gerhard_a_gessell,,1557.737,1558.094,Yes.
1966.39,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1558.094,1559.332,-- don't you?
1966.39,0,25401,gerhard_a_gessell,,1559.332,1561.473,And sold only under -- not only by pharmacists.
1966.39,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1561.473,1563.992,Not drugs that are sold on the shelves of --
1966.39,0,25401,gerhard_a_gessell,,1563.992,1564.515,That's right.
1966.39,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1566.197,1566.331,Yes.
1966.39,0,25401,gerhard_a_gessell,,1566.331,1567.58,Or things of that kind.
1966.39,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1567.58,1568.223,That's what I was getting.
1966.39,0,25401,gerhard_a_gessell,,1568.223,1569.333,Right.
1966.39,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1569.333,1585.085,"Mr. Gessell, I take it that there's no question with what -- even if you lose this case, but you can get judicial review to the validity of this regulation under the statute, just a question of when I take it --"
1966.39,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1585.085,1587.568,Or do you get into criminal cases?
1966.39,0,25401,gerhard_a_gessell,,1587.568,1593.349,The government tries to avoid the criminal case by saying they're not going to bring any even though the statute lets them do it.
1966.39,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1622.603,1627.791,You'd be making -- you'd still be here and making the same argument that there were no criminal enforcement procedures?
1966.39,0,25401,gerhard_a_gessell,,1627.791,1640.983,I would be here making the argument in the event there was any particular move by the Government against a particular label or ad of a particular company at some particular time.
1966.39,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1640.983,1644.5,"Yes, but you would be here now -- or in this thing?"
1966.39,0,25401,gerhard_a_gessell,,1644.5,1647.635,"That's right, if they had done that I would be here."
1966.39,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1647.635,1649.942,"Well, they have the -- they haven't done that yet."
1966.39,0,25401,gerhard_a_gessell,,1649.942,1658.309,No say they're going to enforce the statute and they say it's an enforcement statute and the regulation says shall --
1966.39,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1658.309,1658.697,"Well, how do you --"
1966.39,0,25401,gerhard_a_gessell,,1658.697,1659.95,-- (Voice Overlap) of command.
1966.39,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1659.95,1673.777,"How do you explain the Congress saying you may have pre-enforcement review in regulations under A, B, C, and D or whatever it was and one of the statutes listed is not this one?"
1966.39,0,25401,gerhard_a_gessell,,1673.777,1682.623,"Well, what I say with respect to that is that the savings clause enabled us to --"
1966.39,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1682.623,1682.951,"Well, I know."
1966.39,0,25401,gerhard_a_gessell,,1702.126,1712.304,"Well, there is a -- the statute -- is Your Honor referring to Section 502 (e)?"
1966.39,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1712.304,1714.172,"Maybe, I don't know what the --"
1966.39,0,25401,gerhard_a_gessell,,1714.172,1714.859,Or --
1966.39,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1714.859,1716.778,I don't remember the specific --
1966.39,0,25401,gerhard_a_gessell,,1716.778,1718.339,Or are you referring to --
1966.39,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1718.339,1725.219,I thought Congress did say that there could be pre-enforcement review upon any sort of the regulation under a certain section?
1966.39,0,25401,gerhard_a_gessell,,1725.219,1730.298,"Yes, there are -- under certain sections, there is a review in the Court of Appeals."
1966.39,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1730.298,1730.916,Yes.
1966.39,0,25401,gerhard_a_gessell,,1732.093,1733.979,Direct review in a Court of Appeals.
1966.39,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1762.879,1772.33,"But without that provision in the Act, do you say that -- that under those sections you could go right in the District Court?"
1966.39,0,25401,gerhard_a_gessell,,1772.33,1773.315,Yes.
1966.39,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1794.116,1794.554,You may.
1966.39,0,25401,gerhard_a_gessell,,1794.554,1798.089,-- any questions.
1966.39,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1798.089,1800.513,Mr. Lewin.
1966.39,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,1800.513,1803.912,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1966.39,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1881.827,1889.971,"Now, either that in some fashion -- you're not implying, are you, that there's any question of vagueness or uncertainty about what these regulations require?"
1966.39,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,1889.971,1890.227,No.
1966.39,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1890.227,1890.701,Are you?
1966.39,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,1890.701,1891.108,"No, not at all."
1966.39,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1891.108,1892.209,Very clear?
1966.39,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,1892.209,1899.277,"The only -- the only thing I'm referring to Mr. Justice Stewart is just that this is not a total revolutionary change in the way, but --"
1966.39,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1899.277,1900.377,But it's a very precise fact.
1966.39,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,1900.377,1900.598,It's a very precise change --
1966.39,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1900.598,1901.713,It's interesting --
1966.39,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,1901.713,1901.93,Yes.
1966.39,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1901.93,1904.066,"-- on how we have to change their way of doing business, isn't it?"
1966.39,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,1904.066,1904.917,That's right.
1966.39,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1905.58,1911.831,"Very precise, ascertainable, no argument about what these regulations mean and they're precise and narrow."
1966.39,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,1911.831,1911.988,Yes sir.
1966.39,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1911.988,1916.027,"It's just every time the word appears (Voice Overlap), it must have to appear in the other form."
1966.39,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,1916.027,1917.139,That's right.
1966.39,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1923.312,1923.807,Nor do they claim error?
1966.39,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,1923.807,1925.128,And I hope that -- pardon?
1966.39,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1925.128,1925.881,They don't claim that (Voice Overlap) --
1966.39,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,1925.881,1926.607,No.
1966.39,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1955.022,1955.482,Yes.
1966.39,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,1955.482,1955.59,And that's --
1966.39,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1955.59,1966.159,"But some of the area of your argument, I'd like to hear what possible harm is there in getting the thing decided now, not harm in due course."
1966.39,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,1966.159,1988.65,"The issue of rightness which is common about these cases is one, which is this Court noted well ago in the Rochester Telephone case in 327 U.S. is not limited to administrative regulations or administrative law problems but applies across the Board to a variety of instances in which statutes maybe construed."
1966.39,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1995.73,1998.454,What do you mean precisely about rightness?
1966.39,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,1998.454,2014.459,"Whether, Mr. Justice Black, whether the issue presented the legal issue which is presented for decision by the Court is appropriate to be heard now or at some point when it's more definite and certain who is hurt and how they're hurt."
1966.39,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2043.919,2051.733,"Do you put that together with having the same meaning, hypothetical or future those words have the same meaning?"
1966.39,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,2051.733,2052.913,No.
1966.39,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2053.51,2055.09,I thought you used them that way.
1966.39,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,2055.09,2061.648,"No, we think they're quite different but we think they're both -- both elements that enter into this question."
1966.39,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2061.648,2064.708,Would you think that the case or controversy?
1966.39,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,2064.708,2070.411,I think there is a case or controversy in the -- in maybe in a broad sense of what case or controversy means.
1966.39,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2072.772,2072.978,"Well, that's."
1966.39,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,2072.978,2074.284,-- used to term case or controversy.
1966.39,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2074.284,2081.023,(Voice Overlap) District Court in its declaratory judgment action could the exercise of discretion and not to entertain.
1966.39,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,2081.023,2085.484,"Well, that --that's established law under the Declaratory Judgment Act certainly."
1966.39,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2150.148,2167.476,"Do you take this case as alleging that at this stage now that this is permitted to go on, at this stage he is already liable to suffer irreparable injury or that that's not the case?"
1966.39,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,2167.476,2173.26,"Well, we think he is alleging that he is going to be suffering irreparable injury but he's focusing --"
1966.39,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2173.26,2175.297,Suppose it's true?
1966.39,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,2175.297,2179.836,"Well, we think -- we think he's focusing on the wrong thing Mr. Justice Black."
1966.39,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2208.824,2208.949,And that would --
1966.39,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,2208.949,2209.802,-- but the real issue --
1966.39,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2209.802,2211.707,-- make him suffer irreparable injury?
1966.39,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,2211.707,2212.373,Yes.
1966.39,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2231.2,2231.275,Do you mean --
1966.39,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,2231.275,2231.585,-- other than --
1966.39,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2231.585,2233.616,Do you mean he doesn't have to make any preparation?
1966.39,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,2233.616,2245.965,"He doesn't -- he doesn't have to change his labels today if he in good faith believes that the Food and Drug Administration is an error in its construction of the statute, then he continues to use his own labels in labeling."
1966.39,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2245.965,2248.106,Could they be prosecuted criminally?
1966.39,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,2248.106,2250.578,"Theoretically, they could be prosecuted criminally Mr. Justice Black."
1966.39,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2250.578,2251.65,But why?
1966.39,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,2253.92,2254.644,"Well, because we think --"
1966.39,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2254.644,2257.696,What we theoretically might occur if that's the law.
1966.39,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,2257.696,2258.452,True.
1966.39,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2314.861,2315.317,And they went?
1966.39,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,2315.317,2316.314,-- there's intention of doing.
1966.39,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2316.314,2316.833,And they went?
1966.39,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,2316.833,2317.555,They went --
1966.39,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2317.555,2318.89,They went into trial?
1966.39,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,2318.89,2319.137,Right.
1966.39,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2319.137,2322.288,"And happened to win, supposed they hadn't won?"
1966.39,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,2322.288,2324.689,"Well, if they hadn't won then -- then that -- and then the statute --"
1966.39,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2324.689,2328.463,"Then they had made a mistake in not trying to stop it before, wouldn't they?"
1966.39,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,2328.463,2329.066,No.
1966.39,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2349.859,2353.138,"Well, they could of course under the young doctrine if they had gone that far?"
1966.39,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,2353.138,2353.967,"Oh, yes."
1966.39,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2356.601,2365.566,"On the civil side, how about the remedies that the administration would have against a drug company, on the civil side."
1966.39,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,2365.566,2371.669,"The remedies are two Mr. Justice Douglas, there is seizure or injunction, the Attorney General on --"
1966.39,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2371.669,2373.731,What is seizure in chaos (ph)?
1966.39,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,2373.731,2393.425,"Seizure in chaos (ph) in any case of misbranding, seizing a shipment or whatever product, a carton of the goods and having a suit, a viable action then in the District Court in which the Attorney General is required to establish that the drugs are misbranded and therefore subject to seizure."
1966.39,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2437.348,2439.975,"But they don't have to do that, do they?"
1966.39,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,2439.975,2441.032,No.
1966.39,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2441.032,2445.769,These are the same remedies that are applicable generally under the Food and Drug Act --
1966.39,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,2445.769,2445.99,"Oh, yes."
1966.39,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2445.99,2446.905,-- are they not?
1966.39,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,2446.905,2447.243,Yes sir.
1966.39,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2447.243,2477.534,"Now, has there been a successful injunction suit under the other applications of those remedies under Food and Drug Act in a decision of Court of Appeals or this Court supporting an injunction brought by drug company against the provisions under other parts of Food and Drug Act?"
1966.39,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,2477.534,2478.608,"No, not by a drug company."
1966.39,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2482.455,2487.42,"No, I'm talking of -- as I remember that -- then, let me ask you this I have forgotten."
1966.39,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,2496.507,2497.942,Yes.
1966.39,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2497.942,2499.956,"Now, and they have issued rules, have they not?"
1966.39,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,2499.956,2501.094,Yes.
1966.39,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2501.094,2512.978,"Now, is there any precedent for an injunctive proceeding brought by a drug company to enjoin the enforcement of those rules?"
1966.39,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,2512.978,2513.821,"No, none."
1966.39,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2519.087,2523.138,"And those remedies being the same as the remedies here, is that right?"
1966.39,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,2523.488,2523.687,No.
1966.39,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2523.687,2527.467,-- to say seizure?
1966.39,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,2527.467,2527.631,Right.
1966.39,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2527.631,2530.063,-- or injunction or criminal prosecution?
1966.39,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,2530.063,2536.458,"When the Food and Drug Administration believes that a drug company is violating the Act, it has those remedies."
1966.39,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2556.775,2557.622,I understand that.
1966.39,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,2637.76,2638.01,As I understand --
1966.39,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2638.01,2639.382,-- as I have asked with Mr. Gessell.
1966.39,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,2639.382,2639.559,Yes.
1966.39,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2758.033,2765.428,"Mr. Lewin, are there in this record the labels of drugs that would be affected here?"
1966.39,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,2765.428,2765.908,"No, Mr. Justice."
1966.39,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2765.908,2770.736,Are there in this record copies of advertisements that would be affected here?
1966.39,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,2770.736,2771.848,"No, there are none."
1966.39,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2771.848,2833.517,"So that is it fair to say that in the sense what is being -- what petitioners are seeking to have the Court's rule on is a there's a question which can I use this without invading his abstract in the sense that they're asking us to rule that the secretary's construction of the statute is unjustified as an abstract matter and that we allow -- we do no take into account whether in view of actual examples, actual factual record, the construction -- the Secretary's construction of the statute as within the area of rational judgment that some people urge is a factor in construing the propriety of the exercise of delegated power."
1966.39,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,2833.517,2839.039,"That now, that's precisely our principal objection to what their claim is."
1966.39,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2839.039,2854.86,"Well, is it your objection then that they could file proper cause at this juncture, under some circumstances to get the relief they asked but that the facts here led -- were not sufficient, is that it?"
1966.39,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,2854.86,2864.226,We think they could if the Food and Drug Administration did something to any one of them that in any way raised a present controversy.
1966.39,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2866.555,2880.553,"But I understood the allegation was that they adopted this and they did raise a present controversy because they claim, may not be equal to the Young ex parte, Young allegations."
1966.39,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,2888.154,2891.567,But nothing that -- that harms any one of them --
1966.39,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2891.567,2891.642,I said --
1966.39,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,2891.642,2896.197,-- in such a way that they would not be harmed if they waited until something happened to them.
1966.39,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2898.104,2898.287,I --
1966.39,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,2898.287,2899.015,-- there is --
1966.39,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2899.015,2914.28,I understood him to charge or maybe not that they do hit them now and that there will be such tremendous expenses and such tremendous change and such tremendous differences that will work irreparable harm.
1966.39,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,2927.96,2932.746,We think it is a question of degree definitely Mr. Justice Black but we think that the allegations here --
1966.39,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2932.746,2933.355,Would you not --
1966.39,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,2933.355,2934.016,-- in the circumstance.
1966.39,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2934.016,2936.371,-- take the position that is impossible for them --
1966.39,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,2936.371,2936.587,No.
1966.39,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2936.587,2941.181,-- under the present situation to file a good claim?
1966.39,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,2941.181,2943.717,"Well, to attack this regulation --"
1966.39,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2943.717,2943.926,To attack this?
1966.39,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,2943.926,2950.402,"Without -- yes, without the Food and Drug Administration doing anything more or the Attorney General doing anything more, we think they could not present the challenge --"
1966.39,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2950.402,2958.001,Or there is always in effect criminal offense and they could be put in jail if they violate it.
1966.39,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,2958.001,2959.009,That's right and that's true --
1966.39,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2959.009,2959.248,What's the difference --
1966.39,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,2959.248,2960.19,-- of every criminal statute --
1966.39,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2960.19,2963.055,What's the difference in that in principle in ex parte Young?
1966.39,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,2963.055,2973.505,Because it's true of every criminal statute Mr. Justice Black that if you violate it you may be put in jail and that's doesn't entitle you to go to court and say may I now violate the statute --
1966.39,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2973.505,2973.785,But if you --
1966.39,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,2973.785,2975.52,-- because I propose (Voice Overlap) --
1966.39,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2975.52,2976.85,"(Voice Overlap) it does, doesn't it?"
1966.39,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,2976.85,2979.587,"Well, if it makes you today."
1966.39,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2979.587,2983.992,"(Voice Overlap) number of offenses cumulated, piling up time after time."
1966.39,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,2983.992,2992.388,"Well, we -- I don't think this Court has ever held really in the -- in the context of a criminal statute that you can do that, even if you -- even if you could show you are a repeated offender --"
1966.39,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2992.388,2995.182,I thought they had in criminal cases.
1966.39,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,3005.374,3027.462,"Not I think where -- the only claim is that the party responsible for administering the criminal statute is construing it, it's applicable to my case whereas really it shouldn't – it's certainly true where there are criminal statutes which in someway affect a constitutional right and --"
1966.39,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3027.462,3029.274,Have they alleged that here?
1966.39,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,3029.274,3030.227,I don't think they do.
1966.39,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3030.888,3031.641,They did not?
1966.39,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,3031.641,3032.362,No.
1966.39,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3032.448,3040.875,"I think they have a -- how could they have clarified -- what you seem to agree with Justice Fortas, making it more specific?"
1966.39,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,3040.875,3046.306,"Well, if they applied for example with a new drug or with an antibiotic for certification."
1966.39,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3046.306,3048.428,"No, well, I'm talking about this complaint."
1966.39,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,3048.428,3048.61,No.
1966.39,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3069.795,3077.441,Have you -- do you people say that they have misconstrued the regulations they -- they read it the wrong way?
1966.39,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,3077.441,3078.019,No.
1966.39,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3078.019,3082.342,Do you disclaim any preference to prosecute them if they refuse to do this?
1966.39,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,3082.342,3085.253,We say we will not until the regulation -- until the validity of the --
1966.39,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3085.253,3085.309,I --
1966.39,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,3085.309,3085.932,-- regulation has been --
1966.39,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3085.932,3090.932,Until the validity but -- but in the meantime it would've been covering the situation.
1966.39,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,3095.235,3096.977,Right but --
1966.39,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3096.977,3116.641,"You're saying that they can't get into protection until you first promulgate this particular regulation or see whether or not -- that's -- but nevertheless that they have violated and that that year of the time they could be prosecuted, you do not disclaim purpose to prosecute, do you?"
1966.39,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,3116.641,3120.941,"Well, we disclaim a purpose to prosecute in the sense of criminal prosecution, yes."
1966.39,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3126.481,3127.585,Civil forfeitures?
1966.39,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,3127.585,3156.242,"Either civil forfeitures or through the new drug clearance procedures provided for under the Act which any one of these companies can submit a new drug or an antibiotic for certification, refused to have it labeled in accordance with this regulation and then appeal from the refusal of Food and Drug Administration to certify the antibiotic or to approve a new drug for sale, appeal from that under the procedures in the Food and Drug Act which authorize to review directly in a Court of Appeals."
1966.39,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3156.242,3165.904,"(Inaudible) I assume that it's the revision, but the Congress didn't intend to have this kind of an action --"
1966.39,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,3165.904,3166.396,Right.
1966.39,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3166.396,3171.747,-- whether it's a case of controversy or whether it's right or anything of that kind.
1966.39,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,3178.421,3178.818,Right.
1966.39,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3258.755,3259.378,"But Mr. Lewin, this --"
1966.39,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3259.378,3277.845,"The natural tendencies of administrator and I don't see it -- I don't say that's in any disparaging way as to get submission rather than context and that this strategy was designed, I imagine, to get sufficient acceptance?"
1966.39,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,3277.845,3278.304,Yes.
1966.39,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3278.304,3317.346,"And, Mr. Lewin, is it fair -- is it fair to say that that is the underlying idea of the Food and Drug Act and that the Act has somewhere in some respects a peculiar place in our regulatory system, that is to say I don't know of hand of any other statute that has -- this prompt seizure power (Inaudible), but isn't that bound in with the purpose of the statute dealing with in their old days that was justified on the grounds you were dealing with dangerous drugs."
1966.39,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,3326.057,3362.941,"That's right and we think that the -- that the fact, the review scheme that the statute provide we think is really exclusive at to these kinds of procedures the kind of proceeding is calculated to get expeditious resolution of this -- of these kind of questions because if this suit had not been brought when it was it would've been a matter of weeks or months before an application would have been made for a new drug or would have been passed on by the Food and Drug Administration, it would've been up in the Court of Appeals, and this very regulation in all its parts would've been before the Court of Appeals for review."
1966.39,2,25401,gerhard_a_gessell,,3792.761,3806.291,I would like to deal with two words that have been used this afternoon “premature and abstract” and I'd like to simply give you one example of what the Government said as the way we should deal with this problem.
1966.39,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3834.193,3866.069,"If they do that now, won't they Mr. Gessell, with all kinds of regulations and rulings you're going there with the Food and Drug with the new drug application, then you've got to go through the varying process of getting a clearance on that but so far as I know, nobody is ever here before succeeded in getting an injunction against the enforcement of the class of regulations."
1966.39,2,25401,gerhard_a_gessell,,3913.396,3916.402,My answer to that is very clear and simple.
1966.39,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3924.002,3925.373,"Well, why is this different?"
1966.39,2,25401,gerhard_a_gessell,,3925.941,3941.146,Because the statute does not cover a proceeding of this kind relating to this type of regulation which issued without any evidentiary hearing which -- issued without any factual basis.
1966.39,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3942.851,3943.013,Do you think it have --
1966.39,2,25401,gerhard_a_gessell,,3943.013,3945.444,-- they just say business on what we think the statute means.
1966.39,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3945.444,3952.564,"You don't have an adversary, evidentiary hearing generally in Food and Drug."
1966.39,2,25401,gerhard_a_gessell,,3952.564,3956.031,You do with respect to the kind of case you put to be Mr. Justice.
1966.39,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3961.825,3963.555,"Well, that's the legislative hearing."
1966.39,2,25401,gerhard_a_gessell,,3963.555,3964.456,And that's the type of regulation --
