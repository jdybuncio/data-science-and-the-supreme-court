1972.72-10,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,26.365,"We'll hear arguments next in number 72-10, Moor against Alameda, the County of Alameda."
1972.72-10,0,39362,ronald_m_greenberg,,29.624,33.088,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1972.72-10,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,146.703,158.001,"Mr. Greenberg, is it your position that, that is a nationwide rule in effect that regardless of the relationship of a county to a particular state, it should be one rule throughout the country?"
1972.72-10,0,39362,ronald_m_greenberg,,158.001,176.171,"Barring at least a circumstance which would show that the state is in essence, the real party in interest in the case is correct and I can't think of a political subdivision such as a county in any state in the union where that would be the case."
1972.72-10,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,242.159,258.874,"This was always kind of an off-hand casual way I gather, the Ninth Circuit originating with a brief opinion by the late District Judge Mathis that was accepted by the Ninth Circuit and then everything else was built on that?"
1972.72-10,0,39362,ronald_m_greenberg,,258.874,263.536,There are really only two opinions by the Ninth Circuit that even enunciate that point.
1972.72-10,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,286.351,298.566,In other cases and you are quite correct in my understanding that there are many of them which do hold that a county is a citizen for diversity purposes.
1972.72-10,0,39362,ronald_m_greenberg,,303.869,324.028,"I would say, two clear examples of the two District Courts within the Ninth Circuit who have refused to follow the Ninth Circuit holding, the Oregon case and the Arizona case, which at length analyzed the nature of the county and showed quite conclusively that it wasn't the state of Oregon or the state or Arizona."
1972.72-10,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,353.13,359.911,Why is the state not a citizen of the state?
1972.72-10,0,39362,ronald_m_greenberg,,359.911,363.037,"Starting with the Eleventh Amendment, you can't sue a state, the ---"
1972.72-10,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,363.037,364.924,"Well, but of course, that's a different reason."
1972.72-10,0,39362,ronald_m_greenberg,,374.463,387.695,I think that this Court has held and many courts have held that a state cannot be a citizen of itself and that's a firmly established rule that we don't even question in this case.
1972.72-10,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,394.115,400.639,You say the state is -- part of your assertion is that the county is not equivalent to state?
1972.72-10,0,39362,ronald_m_greenberg,,400.639,400.922,Correct.
1972.72-10,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,400.922,402.27,Although it is a subdivision of the state?
1972.72-10,0,39362,ronald_m_greenberg,,402.27,404.328,That is correct.
1972.72-10,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,411.331,416.33,What about the Municipal corporation chartered by the state?
1972.72-10,0,39362,ronald_m_greenberg,,416.33,427.543,They have long been held to be citizens of a state for diversity jurisdiction purposes and the most recent enunciation by the California Supreme Court has said that counties are quasi corporations of that nature.
1972.72-10,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,575.815,583.421,"How does in California cases that rule over that the -- that also, that the county may not be a plaintiff."
1972.72-10,0,39362,ronald_m_greenberg,,589.328,599.566,"To my knowledge, no case has been cited to us and as result of the Tort Claims Act, the law says the county can sue and be sued."
1972.72-10,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,699.133,713.088,Does the California Tort Claims Act have an exemption or exception with respect to governmental discretionary functions?
1972.72-10,0,39362,ronald_m_greenberg,,713.088,716.874,"No, and in this case, there would be no such exception that would apply."
1972.72-10,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,716.874,721.046,"Well, do they have any in the act itself?"
1972.72-10,0,39362,ronald_m_greenberg,,723.612,726.106,Not to my knowledge.
1972.72-10,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1002.56,1007.09,"Well, if you are right your diversity jurisdiction point, we don't reach this, do we?"
1972.72-10,0,39362,ronald_m_greenberg,,1007.09,1008.498,That's not correct.
1972.72-10,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1012.878,1015.338,"No, I was thinking about the pendent jurisdiction argument."
1972.72-10,0,39362,ronald_m_greenberg,,1016.92,1017.861,"No, that is in both."
1972.72-10,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1045.782,1047.157,What's the other case?
1972.72-10,0,39362,ronald_m_greenberg,,1047.157,1047.407,Rundle.
1972.72-10,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1051.099,1060.364,"Say again, if you were right on your diversity point and then you don't have to reach any other questions in Moor, is that right?"
1972.72-10,0,39362,ronald_m_greenberg,,1060.364,1073.48,"With the possible exception of 1988, the Civil Rights Act because the diversity jurisdiction question would leave open whether or not the county was vicariously liable for the Civil Rights Act."
1972.72-10,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1073.48,1075.581,It's a small question?
1972.72-10,0,39362,ronald_m_greenberg,,1075.581,1078.302,"That's correct and in that sense, one would not have to reach it."
1972.72-10,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1078.302,1080.44,"No, unless it was the action."
1972.72-10,0,39362,ronald_m_greenberg,,1084.955,1088.916,"Neither or both, the Civil Rights Acts jurisdiction and --"
1972.72-10,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1088.916,1093.415,"Because finding a diversity jurisdiction in Moor, doesn't answer either question?"
1972.72-10,0,39362,ronald_m_greenberg,,1093.415,1093.621,No.
1972.72-10,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1098.557,1101.496,"Also, there is no possibility about the kind of diversity in that --"
1972.72-10,0,39362,ronald_m_greenberg,,1101.496,1110.631,"No, it was never even raised, never argued, both of these people were shot at the same time in same place and perhaps with the same shot."
1972.72-10,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1134.419,1138.951,Is it either/or in your view?
1972.72-10,0,39362,ronald_m_greenberg,,1147.136,1161.822,"Clearly, if we decide on the basis â€“ well, if you decide that there is a Federal jurisdiction under the Civil Rights Acts, then you really don't have pendent party joinder anymore, you just have traditional Pendent jurisdiction joinder because now you are joining claims against whom you, a party --"
1972.72-10,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1161.822,1162.792,You already have the party in your 1983 action?
1972.72-10,0,39362,ronald_m_greenberg,,1162.792,1162.955,"Yes, right."
1972.72-10,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1162.955,1175.086,"Well, then you must be suggesting, you have to reach in Rundle, the pendent party if you treat Moor as proper diversity case?"
1972.72-10,0,39362,ronald_m_greenberg,,1175.086,1175.6,Correct.
1972.72-10,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1175.6,1180.81,And then you have to get to the pendent party to bring Rundle in --
1972.72-10,0,39362,ronald_m_greenberg,,1180.81,1180.879,Or --
1972.72-10,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1180.879,1184.123,"Even if you lose out, if you lost out on the 1988?"
1972.72-10,0,39362,ronald_m_greenberg,,1184.123,1185.893,Correct.
1972.72-10,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1185.893,1187.242,To bring the county in?
1972.72-10,0,39362,ronald_m_greenberg,,1187.242,1187.68,Pardon?
1972.72-10,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1187.68,1188.449,To bring the county in?
1972.72-10,0,39362,ronald_m_greenberg,,1188.449,1190.552,"To bring the county, correct."
1972.72-10,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1195.474,1205.725,"But just saying you can join a party through pendent jurisdiction, that tells us what kind of a claim that party might have?"
1972.72-10,0,39362,ronald_m_greenberg,,1205.725,1209.165,"No, one would think you would clearly have the state law claims."
1972.72-10,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1209.165,1210.658,"Well, is that all you are saying?"
1972.72-10,0,39362,ronald_m_greenberg,,1214.398,1217.371,I am saying as follows.
1972.72-10,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1268.696,1282.736,"I don't -- what I don't understand, Mr. Greenberg, if you prevail in Moor on the diversity point and also prevail on the pendent party claim, why haven't you got everything you want?"
1972.72-10,0,39362,ronald_m_greenberg,,1282.736,1282.884,Oh!
1972.72-10,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1286.842,1287.151,And on the pendent party --
1972.72-10,0,39362,ronald_m_greenberg,,1287.151,1290.113,-- and Civil Rights Acts jurisdiction or pendent Party.
1972.72-10,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1290.113,1292.725,"I don't know, pendent party only."
1972.72-10,0,39362,ronald_m_greenberg,,1308.527,1311.294,It's all state law vicarious liability that's being imposed.
1972.72-10,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1311.294,1312.785,Then don't you have enough?
1972.72-10,0,39362,ronald_m_greenberg,,1312.785,1315.695,"Correct, if I could get the county into the case."
1972.72-10,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1315.695,1326.079,(Inaudible) suppose we decide the point that would it been possible for you to get everything you want in the state law and in the state court action?
1972.72-10,0,39362,ronald_m_greenberg,,1326.079,1340.453,"Theoretically yes because there is concurrent jurisdiction on the Civil Rights Act, but I think that we tried to explain to the Court on our brief that given the nature of this case which involves Federal Constitutional Rights."
1972.72-10,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1365.45,1372.748,"That's is true of course in almost all of these cases, but at least you wouldn't be up here and battling the jurisdiction?"
1972.72-10,0,39362,ronald_m_greenberg,,1372.748,1376.361,"No, but I might have been similarly thrown out of the state court altogether."
1972.72-10,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1376.361,1385.235,(Inaudible) the court's power under pendent jurisdiction.
1972.72-10,0,39362,ronald_m_greenberg,,1400.19,1401.656,No question about it.
1972.72-10,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1441.481,1447.253,Very well Mr. Greenberg.
1972.72-10,1,37825,peter_w_davis,,1456.963,1460.946,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1972.72-10,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1607.123,1616.102,"This is an argument I take it that under 1983, in light of Monroe and Pape, there could be no action against the county?"
1972.72-10,1,37825,peter_w_davis,,1616.102,1617.042,That's correct.
1972.72-10,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1617.042,1626.798,"And therefore, since there is no jurisdiction over the proceeding against the county, you can't bring in 1988 to infuse California law, is that it?"
1972.72-10,1,37825,peter_w_davis,,1626.798,1626.829,Yes.
1972.72-10,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1626.829,1628.569,Under the Federal cause --
1972.72-10,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1628.569,1629.942,There is no Federal cause of action.
1972.72-10,1,37825,peter_w_davis,,1629.942,1631.094,There is no federal course of action.
1972.72-10,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1633.31,1637.023,Well that's what he says there is no federal cause of action in the 1983 against county?
1972.72-10,1,37825,peter_w_davis,,1637.023,1638.028,And they have admitted that.
1972.72-10,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1638.028,1639.24,"Right, under Monroe and Pape."
1972.72-10,1,37825,peter_w_davis,,1639.24,1639.74,Right.
1972.72-10,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1639.74,1646.831,And your argument probably is that therefore there is no jurisdiction in the sense required by 1988 before you can go on to state law?
1972.72-10,1,37825,peter_w_davis,,1646.831,1648.982,That's correct.
1972.72-10,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1661.128,1661.956,Alright.
1972.72-10,1,37825,peter_w_davis,,1661.956,1679.973,"And in addition to that, plaintiff has not met at all the arguments that you cannot use 1983 simply by its own terms where there is an adequate remedy, the Federal remedy is adequate and you cannot use it to bring in an inconsistent state law and both of those considerations are present here."
1972.72-10,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1887.788,1889.301,Who is the defendant to that?
1972.72-10,1,37825,peter_w_davis,,1889.301,1890.125,The same defendants.
1972.72-10,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1897.893,1899.79,"Alright, who is the plaintiff?"
1972.72-10,1,37825,peter_w_davis,,1899.79,1901.03,Rundle.
1972.72-10,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1918.313,1923.715,That is under the Liability Act applicable to municipalities and counties?
1972.72-10,1,37825,peter_w_davis,,1925.635,1927.649,That's correct under the Tort Claims Act.
1972.72-10,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1927.649,1937.81,"You have mentioned this liability insurance earlier, enlarge a little on that will you?"
1972.72-10,1,37825,peter_w_davis,,1939.242,1951.058,"Outside of the record, all of the individual defendants are individually insured for, I believe, it's 200,000 for one injury and 500,000 or 800,000 for all injuries."
1972.72-10,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1970.206,1972.076,The compensatory damages only?
1972.72-10,1,37825,peter_w_davis,,1972.076,1973.413,Yes.
1972.72-10,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1978.84,1986.752,Is that in substitution for liability of the municipal corporation or is it in addition to that?
1972.72-10,1,37825,peter_w_davis,,1986.752,1992.859,"In the case of a Federal Civil Rights Act, I would take the position that it's in substitution for it."
1972.72-10,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1999.767,2002.459,That is why the county is joined and the State Court action.
1972.72-10,1,37825,peter_w_davis,,2005.176,2006.31,That's correct.
1972.72-10,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2079.154,2083.967,That leaves an alternative to be invoked and achieving both?
1972.72-10,1,37825,peter_w_davis,,2083.967,2090.308,"Well, that's also possible, but as a practical matter if you allow suit against the public entity, you don't get suits against the individuals offer."
1972.72-10,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2090.308,2094.625,Didn't you say the counties are joined with the policemen in the state action?
1972.72-10,1,37825,peter_w_davis,,2094.625,2097.983,"In this particular case, they are, but in many, many cases, they are not."
1972.72-10,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2100.363,2102.446,Clear up one the thing for me
1972.72-10,1,37825,peter_w_davis,,2113.019,2114.184,No.
1972.72-10,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2118.694,2120.098,"And the Tort Claims Act, I gather?"
1972.72-10,1,37825,peter_w_davis,,2120.098,2123.172,"In the tort, that's part of the Tort Claims Act, yes."
1972.72-10,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2123.172,2133.096,"In other words, if it's something that generates punitive damages, the policeman is on his own frolic (ph) or the employee is on his own?"
1972.72-10,1,37825,peter_w_davis,,2133.096,2133.764,That's correct.
1972.72-10,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2149.296,2150.578,Would you raise your voice a little?
1972.72-10,1,37825,peter_w_davis,,2150.578,2151.028,I am sorry.
1972.72-10,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2151.028,2153.718,I think if you get more near to the center of that microphone.
1972.72-10,1,37825,peter_w_davis,,2153.718,2154.359,I am sorry.
1972.72-10,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2162.099,2164.677,"Essentially, like that of the Federal Act?"
1972.72-10,1,37825,peter_w_davis,,2164.677,2169.574,"Yes, Your Honor."
1972.72-10,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2169.574,2176.719,"Well, are you suggesting that might reach all police action?"
1972.72-10,1,37825,peter_w_davis,,2176.719,2177.064,No.
1972.72-10,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2177.064,2178.158,By the county?
1972.72-10,1,37825,peter_w_davis,,2178.158,2179.738,"In this case, no."
1972.72-10,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2213.367,2216.545,Is that what they presented right here?
1972.72-10,1,37825,peter_w_davis,,2216.545,2217.038,It makes a difference --
1972.72-10,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2217.038,2220.634,"(Inaudible) so far, does it make any difference?"
1972.72-10,1,37825,peter_w_davis,,2220.634,2222.802,"No, it does not."
1972.72-10,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2222.802,2226.076,Okay.
1972.72-10,1,37825,peter_w_davis,,2226.076,2250.944,"If I may though, Mr. Justice White read, the issue relevant to the present study of course is whether public entities not withstanding their immunity from direct liability under the Civil Rights Act should assume financial responsibility (whether through payment of insurance premiums to protect their personnel or through assumption of payments of judgments against such personnel) for violations by their police officers of that act."
1972.72-10,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2388.222,2392.844,"Now let's see, this is an argument addressed to the second point of pendent parties?"
1972.72-10,1,37825,peter_w_davis,,2392.844,2403.115,"That would also be an argument addressed to the discretion issue on the pendent parties, but I think it is an argument that's present here when the plaintiff says he wants to bring in a state law of causes of action wholesale through 1988."
1972.72-10,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2409.144,2413.454,And what about (Inaudible) with respect to Moor?
1972.72-10,1,37825,peter_w_davis,,2413.454,2417.538,Diversity is a problem.
1972.72-10,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2418.991,2423.131,"But if you agree, it's not a question of (Inaudible)"
1972.72-10,1,37825,peter_w_davis,,2423.131,2425.641,That's correct.
1972.72-10,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2435.615,2437.597,Let me get it straight.
1972.72-10,1,37825,peter_w_davis,,2458.198,2460.741,That is close to the situation in Hatridge.
1972.72-10,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2476.712,2481.128,And if you are wrong on diversity then this -- do we have to face up to the --?
1972.72-10,1,37825,peter_w_davis,,2481.128,2492.954,"Yes, I would take the position that even though it makes more sense in that situation than in the instant situation, I think that it's still is an extension of pendent jurisdiction which is not authorized."
1972.72-10,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2492.954,2495.963,"Well, in the discretionary sense."
1972.72-10,1,37825,peter_w_davis,,2504.318,2505.923,"The pendent question correct, yes."
1972.72-10,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2505.923,2510.185,"I know, but should we decide it here or should we send it back, if you are wrong on diversity?"
1972.72-10,1,37825,peter_w_davis,,2513.679,2518.572,You would have to decide whether there is power in any event.
1972.72-10,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2535.22,2555.856,"Well, in a diversity case, at least my understanding that in order for there to be diversity jurisdiction, all of the plaintiffs have to be a diverse citizenship from all of the defendants and once you have a plaintiff and a defendant who do not have diverse citizenship, diversity is defeated, isn't it?"
1972.72-10,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2555.856,2557.21,There are separate suits like that?
1972.72-10,1,37825,peter_w_davis,,2557.21,2559.427,"There are separate suits, but they have been consolidated."
1972.72-10,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2559.427,2562.952,"Does that mean, you destroy federal constitution."
1972.72-10,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2566.702,2568.422,That would be (Inaudible)?
1972.72-10,1,37825,peter_w_davis,,2568.422,2570.322,"That point has not been argued, but it makes sense --"
1972.72-10,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2570.322,2570.908,"Well, isn't it true?"
1972.72-10,1,37825,peter_w_davis,,2570.908,2576.344,"-- to me and I agree with it that if the cases are consolidated, then there would not be complete diversity since once requires --"
1972.72-10,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2576.344,2578.32,"And diversity is defeated, isn't?"
1972.72-10,1,37825,peter_w_davis,,2583.187,2584.359,That's correct.
1972.72-10,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2584.359,2588.83,Neither party -- neither party broke up?
1972.72-10,1,37825,peter_w_davis,,2588.83,2590.983,The --
1972.72-10,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2590.983,2593.449,If the court permits (Inaudible)
1972.72-10,1,37825,peter_w_davis,,2593.449,2597.734,"Well, these work all are assigned under the related case rule to the same judge."
1972.72-10,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2597.734,2602.351,"Related, that means in every county they are related case (Voice Overlap)"
1972.72-10,1,37825,peter_w_davis,,2602.351,2606.994,"No, but that's not -- I believe the cases were also consolidated."
1972.72-10,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2606.994,2610.79,By whom?
1972.72-10,1,37825,peter_w_davis,,2610.79,2611.666,"I am sorry, Your Honor."
1972.72-10,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2615.544,2623.396,How could you consolidate a diversity case with another case and then thereby defeat a diversity case?
1972.72-10,1,37825,peter_w_davis,,2630.817,2638.898,"Federal jurisdiction is limited and if the case falls within or without the preview of the jurisdictional statutes, the chips have to fall as they may."
1972.72-10,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2638.898,2646.537,"But if cases are consolidated, don't they each stand on their individual merits?"
1972.72-10,1,37825,peter_w_davis,,2646.537,2659.142,"Conceptually, I don't know what the difference is between two individual actions with identical complains except for the diversity point in one which are consolidated and one complaint that has both in it and under the live situation --"
1972.72-10,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2659.142,2662.534,They would have consolidated in one complaint?
1972.72-10,1,37825,peter_w_davis,,2662.534,2665.472,Consolidated in one action with two separate complaints which say the same thing.
1972.72-10,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2665.472,2668.654,"Well, that's a lot different?"
1972.72-10,1,37825,peter_w_davis,,2668.654,2671.788,Is it really conceptually different as a practical matter than --
1972.72-10,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2671.788,2675.099,"I am not talking about conception, I am talking about actually."
1972.72-10,1,37825,peter_w_davis,,2677.475,2679.444,Yes.
1972.72-10,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2679.444,2683.361,"Well, aren't they then individual cases?"
1972.72-10,1,37825,peter_w_davis,,2683.361,2686.578,"Technically, I think that they are except that --"
1972.72-10,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2686.578,2695.504,"The fact that they are consolidated for the purpose of convenience, defeat one on diversity?"
1972.72-10,1,37825,peter_w_davis,,2695.504,2696.454,I think that it is --
1972.72-10,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2696.454,2704.904,Or supposed we both sue General Motors for something and mine is on diversity and yours is not.
1972.72-10,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2708.281,2718.795,"Well, that maybe so but if I want to come in and say I am pendent and said I want to be part of this law suit, that's is different, isn't?"
1972.72-10,1,37825,peter_w_davis,,2726.618,2727.105,I think in your point --
1972.72-10,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2727.105,2728.321,You cannot have it both ways.
1972.72-10,1,37825,peter_w_davis,,2728.321,2729.883,"Mr. Justice White, yes, that's very true."
1972.72-10,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2729.883,2737.556,"Well, did anybody argue the Strawbridge against Curtiss point in the lower court, the complete diversity of plaintiffs and defendants?"
1972.72-10,1,37825,peter_w_davis,,2737.556,2741.198,"On the consolidated issue, no."
1972.72-10,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2756.269,2764.291,"Before you get in to that, you started to say something about California, a county is simply, on that point, something else intervened."
1972.72-10,1,37825,peter_w_davis,,2764.291,2767.287,Thank you Mr. Chief Justice.
1972.72-10,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2767.287,2769.539,You want to finish that?
1972.72-10,1,37825,peter_w_davis,,2769.539,2783.829,"I think that in California, whatever the situation might be in other states, the California law makes it clear that a California county is simply a subdivision of the state and has whatever powers the state delegates to it."
1972.72-10,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2848.842,2851.556,You think this argument as to is in San Francisco?
1972.72-10,1,37825,peter_w_davis,,2851.556,2853.125,"No, not as to the city."
1972.72-10,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2859.586,2872.666,"Are you saying that this is unique to California county, and do you think that this is behind the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuitâ€™s decisions in this area even though not articulated?"
1972.72-10,1,37825,peter_w_davis,,2872.666,2874.073,I think it must be.
1972.72-10,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2882.114,2885.334,"Well, have they are ever articulated this as well?"
1972.72-10,1,37825,peter_w_davis,,2899.784,2900.79,Makes it not a citizen of the state.
1972.72-10,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2900.79,2902.421,"Well, alright, not a citizen."
1972.72-10,1,37825,peter_w_davis,,2906.442,2907.93,They have said just what you said.
1972.72-10,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2911.976,2924.481,"Ordinarily, of course, we accept here, did you know, what a Court of Appeal says is the state law, but we are not positioned with this one on issue?"
1972.72-10,1,37825,peter_w_davis,,2924.481,2929.973,The plaintiff has pointed out authorities to the effect if whether it is a citizen or as a matter of federal law and not a state law.
1972.72-10,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2934.523,2944.352,"So far, everything you have told us about California counties, I think, it could have been said about the counties in any state that I know about."
1972.72-10,1,37825,peter_w_davis,,2951.99,2955.399,I am not sure what the status of counties in other states is.
1972.72-10,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2955.399,2964.316,"I am not sure certainly with every state, but the states I am familiar with are just as you told is California in creatures of the state?"
1972.72-10,1,37825,peter_w_davis,,2964.316,2969.066,The decisions I have read haven't given any great analysis to this either including Cowles.
1972.72-10,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3004.897,3009.388,(Inaudible) the county court houses in the California.
1972.72-10,1,37825,peter_w_davis,,3011.457,3014.815,According to the County of Morin case it's owned by the state.
1972.72-10,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3031.973,3034.563,Your cities are not creatures of the state?
1972.72-10,1,37825,peter_w_davis,,3034.563,3044.217,Cities are creatures of the state under different constitutional provisions and under different legislating provisions and they have different powers and different duties.
1972.72-10,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3044.217,3047.086,You say they were -- the cities are incorporated?
1972.72-10,1,37825,peter_w_davis,,3047.086,3047.688,Yes.
1972.72-10,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3047.688,3049.855,And counties are not?
1972.72-10,1,37825,peter_w_davis,,3049.855,3052.912,"I do not think not in the same sense of the word, no."
1972.72-10,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3052.912,3057.143,Doesn't a county put up part of the judges salary or is coming to entirely from the state?
1972.72-10,1,37825,peter_w_davis,,3057.143,3063.885,"I am not sure Justice Rehnquist, but I believe that they are -- I was told that they were paid by the state."
1972.72-10,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3065.873,3071.466,Are your school districts citizen for purpose of the diversity --
1972.72-10,1,37825,peter_w_davis,,3071.466,3082.899,"The school districts, assuming that they are all the same and I don't know that would be again a legislative creature only and nothing enacted under different laws --"
1972.72-10,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3082.899,3083.842,So your answer is yes?
1972.72-10,1,37825,peter_w_davis,,3083.842,3089.721,"-- and probably would be yes, yes."
1972.72-10,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3089.721,3093.416,San Francisco would be under Monroe and Pape?
1972.72-10,1,37825,peter_w_davis,,3093.416,3094.913,I may have to back up a minute on that.
1972.72-10,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3296.811,3301.092,"Thank you Mr. Davis, Mr. Greenberg, you have a few minutes left."
1972.72-10,2,39362,ronald_m_greenberg,,3301.092,3302.934,Let me correct a couple of points.
1972.72-10,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3317.559,3325.664,"So there is no claim (Inaudible) here that if Moor is a diversity case, Rundle is pendent?"
1972.72-10,2,39362,ronald_m_greenberg,,3325.664,3326.919,"No, none at all."
1972.72-10,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3327.099,3328.425,You couldn't make the argument?
1972.72-10,2,39362,ronald_m_greenberg,,3328.425,3333.739,"No, Rundle will stand to fall on the Civil Rights Acts in pendent jurisdiction or points."
1972.72-10,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3333.739,3341.043,"Because as soon as it became pendent, they are no longer be jurisdictional of the Federal Court, isn't that correct?"
1972.72-10,2,39362,ronald_m_greenberg,,3341.043,3341.2,Oh!
1972.72-10,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3345.861,3355.373,"Yeah, but the whole concept of diversity jurisdiction is that all appellees are of diverse in citizenship from all the defendants, and if they are not, there is no jurisdiction of a Federal Court?"
1972.72-10,2,39362,ronald_m_greenberg,,3355.373,3364.862,"Well, except in Courts of Appeal, I am sure they got along that point and pendents and claims of citizens of the same states, once they had jurisdiction of the entire matter, but we are not raising that at all."
1972.72-10,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3388.821,3396.168,"Well now before you leave that, you said that Ninth Circuit is responsible for consolidating these cases for appeal only."
1972.72-10,2,39362,ronald_m_greenberg,,3404.606,3406.741,"At the moment, that is correct and that is their posture."
1972.72-10,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3418.393,3422.712,"Of course, they will be specially be tried separately for one is in the State Court and what is in the Federal Court?"
1972.72-10,2,39362,ronald_m_greenberg,,3422.712,3424.331,No question about that.
1972.72-10,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3424.331,3428.649,And I gather the actions pending in the state courts are also to be tried --
1972.72-10,2,39362,ronald_m_greenberg,,3428.649,3429.219,No.
1972.72-10,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3464.287,3465.386,You mean only in Rundle -- also?
1972.72-10,2,39362,ronald_m_greenberg,,3465.386,3466.275,Only in Rundle.
1972.72-10,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3466.275,3466.839,Oh!
1972.72-10,2,39362,ronald_m_greenberg,,3467.959,3480.059,"And that we have never done anything with the State Court action include serving it until about a month ago when under California law, if a case is not served within three years of filing, it is automatically dismissed."
1972.72-10,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3488.34,3489.581,What you mean the federal cases?
1972.72-10,2,39362,ronald_m_greenberg,,3491.975,3494.23,"Right, but we are talking about Rundle because it's got the companion state case."
1972.72-10,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3494.23,3496.205,"I see, I see."
1972.72-10,2,39362,ronald_m_greenberg,,3496.205,3507.097,I would hate to think that our client in Rundle would be prejudiced by our seeking to protect him and to obviate the very thing that we are trying to obviate having to go two courts with the same case.
1972.72-10,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3507.097,3513.342,"But then I say you would have avoided all this, had you gone full steam ahead on the state side for both cases?"
1972.72-10,2,39362,ronald_m_greenberg,,3513.342,3530.7,"Just as in any pendent jurisdiction case, with diversity case I suppose, sure, we had that option, but we chose the federal forum because we felt we would get -- there were many factors which dictated our going into the federal forum and I would -- jury, they were balancing factors."
1972.72-10,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3603.295,3606.216,Or the contrary?
1972.72-10,2,39362,ronald_m_greenberg,,3606.216,3607.229,But they are not.
1972.72-10,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3622.594,3629.139,"What it done on basis of as far as the record is concerned that counties are usually richer than anybody, any individual?"
1972.72-10,2,39362,ronald_m_greenberg,,3629.139,3631.085,I think that's is a fair assumption.
1972.72-10,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3631.085,3632.049,But that's your argument?
1972.72-10,2,39362,ronald_m_greenberg,,3632.049,3632.727,Correct.
1972.72-10,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3632.727,3633.838,And you have no evidence on it?
1972.72-10,2,39362,ronald_m_greenberg,,3633.838,3641.133,"No and perhaps or court take judicial notice on it, but the county has got of deeper pocket than the shot -- the deputy who shot my client."

1972.72-10,2,39362,ronald_m_greenberg,,3703.129,3721.932,"No, Monroe says and Monroe is concerned only with 1983 liability, footnote 2 of that opinion makes clear that's the only section that was before the Court and the Court held that on the basis of the Sherman Amendment debates, Congress did not intend to impose liability by virtue of 1983."
1972.72-10,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3721.932,3727.471,Didn't the Court also say that a city was not a person within the meeting of 1983?
1972.72-10,2,39362,ronald_m_greenberg,,3727.471,3728.192,It's correct.
1972.72-10,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3732.701,3733.05,Alright.
1972.72-10,2,39362,ronald_m_greenberg,,3733.05,3735.105,That's not our position here.
