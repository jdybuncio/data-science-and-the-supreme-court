1955.351,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,26.25,"Number 351, R.V. Archawski et al. versus Basil Hanioti."
1955.351,0,27142,harry_d_graham,,27.881,31.882,If it please the Court.
1955.351,0,27142,harry_d_graham,,34.178,36.181,"Yes, you may proceed."
1955.351,0,27142,harry_d_graham,,36.181,60.578,"Now, this is an admiralty action involving some 350 odd passengers who, back in 1947, prepaid passage fares for voyages on board a Honduran flagship known as the City of Athens, to various ports in Europe."
1955.351,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,617.395,623.502,What was the theory -- what was the theory of decisions told here?
1955.351,0,27142,harry_d_graham,,653.762,656.892,"They cited two of their own precedents, Your Honor."
1955.351,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,656.892,660.199,Yes I know but why do I want know way back that sends their precedence.
1955.351,0,27142,harry_d_graham,,665.616,671.359,"One, is a question -- is a question of whether or not these passenger's actions are in quasi contract."
1955.351,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,671.359,672.862,Well I assume they are -- assume that --
1955.351,0,27142,harry_d_graham,,672.862,673.99,Assume they are?
1955.351,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,673.99,677.216,Just law of recovery if the contract is frustrated.
1955.351,0,27142,harry_d_graham,,677.216,680.395,Well that was the very subject the Chief Clark left with Your Honor and --
1955.351,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,680.395,681.378,I --
1955.351,0,27142,harry_d_graham,,681.378,683.172,He apparently doesn't know the history.
1955.351,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,683.172,689.811,"I would like to know that -- there must have been something as I can go very objective to that inclusion, what was it?"
1955.351,0,27142,harry_d_graham,,689.811,693.559,The earlier cases were the two cases that this Court itself had cited.
1955.351,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,703.839,710.661,You tell me -- you said a little while ago the play back (Inaudible)
1955.351,0,27142,harry_d_graham,,710.661,710.988,Yes.
1955.351,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,710.988,712.6,(Inaudible)
1955.351,0,27142,harry_d_graham,,712.6,713.543,"That's correct, sir."
1955.351,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,713.543,718.54,"Now, how did they get off and what do regard as the right (Inaudible)"
1955.351,0,27142,harry_d_graham,,718.54,726.543,"The passengers on the Cobb case, there had been a breach of the contract of carriage."
1955.351,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,738.168,746.134,"But it can't be -- it's common law -- on a contract (Inaudible) as something, that was a technical common law action on the contrary."
1955.351,0,27142,harry_d_graham,,746.134,753.875,"Well, they held that that was an implied agreement annexed to the contract of transportation."
1955.351,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,762.147,774.555,"Well, what I want to know is well, what lead the Court to disregard in event that the -- I did a content in order find out the source of error and error received."
1955.351,0,27142,harry_d_graham,,774.555,788.767,"Well, on that -- on that particular question, Your Honor, I cannot answer what was in the minds of the Court of Appeals."
1955.351,0,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,880.439,881.521,That was the Silva case?
1955.351,0,27142,harry_d_graham,,881.521,883.486,"That was the Silva case, Your Honor."
1955.351,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,989.634,992.636,I don't rest on the Krauss case.
1955.351,0,27142,harry_d_graham,,992.636,995.175,"I -- I rest on the Krauss case, You Honor."
1955.351,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1005.789,1007.684,That would rest down the Krauss case.
1955.351,0,27142,harry_d_graham,,1007.684,1008.569,"That is correct, sir."
1955.351,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1008.569,1014.417,That Judge Hand said that they -- they did not (Inaudible)
1955.351,0,27142,harry_d_graham,,1014.417,1015.833,"That's correct, sir."
1955.351,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1015.833,1019.016,Some of the very (Inaudible)
1955.351,0,27142,harry_d_graham,,1019.016,1020.695,"It was dicta, Your Honor."
1955.351,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1022.977,1023.479,What?
1955.351,0,27142,harry_d_graham,,1023.479,1025.141,It appeared to be dicta in the Krauss case.
1955.351,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1025.141,1037.577,"Do you think there's a difference between saying the contract imply the facts that they shouldn't overcharge and say the contract implies with the fact that if you don't get any report, you stay back for the considerations."
1955.351,0,27142,harry_d_graham,,1037.577,1049.564,I see no distinction whatsoever.
1955.351,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1049.564,1053.191,I don't see why -- I don't see why it's particularly there.
1955.351,0,27142,harry_d_graham,,1053.191,1062.584,"The question before the Court in Krauss case was whether or not, the libelant could enforce his claim for this overpayment in rem."
1955.351,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1088.799,1094.851,"But if he didn't have the cause of action, he wouldn't have a lien to being derived from the cause of action."
1955.351,0,27142,harry_d_graham,,1094.851,1096.752,That's correct.
1955.351,1,28507,israel_convisser,,1179.677,1180.322,May it please the Court.
1955.351,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1180.322,1182.704,Mr. Convisser.
1955.351,1,28507,israel_convisser,,1182.704,1195.815,"I was retained to argue this case only about a week ago, and so I must apologize to this bench for the fact that my research has not been as extensive as I should have liked to have been."
1955.351,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1212.635,1216.799,So you're going to raise -- raise things not raised heretofore?
1955.351,1,28507,israel_convisser,,1216.799,1220.254,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1955.351,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1221.444,1223.933,What -- what -- what point is that that you're going to do?
1955.351,1,28507,israel_convisser,,1223.933,1243.388,That this is an action in tort which is exclusively a land tort and basically outside the cognizance of admiralty that the rule in admiralty is that jurisdiction of torts is controlled by locality or situs.
1955.351,1,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,1276.972,1280.044,Does the record show those are the facts that support that argument?
1955.351,1,28507,israel_convisser,,1280.044,1282.794,The case came up on very shortened transcripts.
