1975.74-1542,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,8.42,"We will hear arguments first this morning in number 1542, Union Electric Company against the Environmental Protection Agency."
1975.74-1542,0,44647,william_h_ferrell,,11.245,18.353,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1975.74-1542,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,840.39,853.593,Are you suggesting Mr. Ferrell that none of these of factors could have been anticipated in time for a different type of review?
1975.74-1542,0,44647,william_h_ferrell,,853.593,880.202,"Well, I do in my brief and I will now point out that we think from constitutional point of view, there are three different methods that the constitutional requirement should be met and when you talk about a different type of review in a sense you have to look at the two periods of time."
1975.74-1542,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,949.323,957.082,"But did not the Eighth Circuit say in effect that even if you had raised this within a 30-day period, they would not have listen to it?"
1975.74-1542,0,44647,william_h_ferrell,,957.082,958.841,They did say that.
1975.74-1542,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1000.635,1005.506,"Yes, but I thought Judge Gibson's opinion said you cannot consider that until you bring in an employee?"
1975.74-1542,0,44647,william_h_ferrell,,1005.506,1032.96,"Yes, I mean, it is a little hard to say what is exactly part of the opinion, what is the dicta, but he did say that this is a political matter that these technical factors and economic factors are matters of politics, matters which the judiciary cannot touch matters beyond the judiciary."
1975.74-1542,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1044.771,1056.662,"How would Union Electric -- what constitutional problem would Union Electric ran into, at least if its allegations were in fact true, but it could not raise this until the enforcement proceeding?"
1975.74-1542,0,44647,william_h_ferrell,,1056.662,1059.513,"Well, there is the other."
1975.74-1542,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1071.431,1075.769,But whether you say there is a constitutional issue if we do not rule let us say under --
1975.74-1542,0,44647,william_h_ferrell,,1075.769,1091.735,"No, in fact I say that if you rule as has I think the Seventh Circuit in the Indiana in Michigan Electric Company case, former Justice of this Court was ahead of the time there."
1975.74-1542,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1191.843,1197.001,Mr. Ferrell as I listen to you I was just thinking about the interest of the State of Missouri.
1975.74-1542,0,44647,william_h_ferrell,,1216.216,1270.084,"Well, the variance procedure this Court did, I think Mr. Justice Rehnquist was the author of the opinion, decided one and only one case under the Clean Air Act and that is a variance approved by the state under the state law may thereafter be consider a revision of an implementation plan and approved by the Environmental Protection Agency under to be precise I think it is 101 or 110 (c) of the Clean Air Act, if there will not be any jeopardy to the maintenance of the National Air Quality Standards."
1975.74-1542,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1362.959,1373.906,"Mr. Ferrell, what is the government referring to at page 10 of its brief with a year before some appropriate state agency now on matters of a Missouri Clause?"
1975.74-1542,0,44647,william_h_ferrell,,1373.906,1379.185,"Well, we say that that is not correct."
1975.74-1542,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1386.331,1389.712,But do you have a proceeding pending before some --
1975.74-1542,0,44647,william_h_ferrell,,1389.712,1393.723,"We always have application, whenever we have a variance we have an application for it."
1975.74-1542,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1394.425,1395.247,And what is the --
1975.74-1542,0,44647,william_h_ferrell,,1395.247,1397.012,But right now they are all applications.
1975.74-1542,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1397.012,1400.522,What is the status of that proceeding at the moment?
1975.74-1542,0,44647,william_h_ferrell,,1407.579,1416.053,I think the reason is just waiting on this decision and I think everybody quit.
1975.74-1542,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1453.78,1459.264,Under Missouri practice are you permitted to ask for a hearing if you need that in order to validate your defenses?
1975.74-1542,0,44647,william_h_ferrell,,1459.264,1461.155,"Well, it would be on collusive."
1975.74-1542,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1461.155,1461.589,Pardon me?
1975.74-1542,0,44647,william_h_ferrell,,1461.589,1463.798,It will only be collusive.
1975.74-1542,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1463.798,1466.704,But would it satisfy the Federal requirement if that is the only problem –-
1975.74-1542,0,44647,william_h_ferrell,,1466.704,1468.749,"Well, there are two methods of getting a hearing."
1975.74-1542,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1555.379,1560.121,Very well Mr. Ferrell.
1975.74-1542,1,38388,peter_r_taft,,1562.307,1566.094,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1975.74-1542,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1715.565,1727.299,I take if you will agree with your friend that there are no circumstances under which a plant like this can be closed as it might be true in some other types of --
1975.74-1542,1,38388,peter_r_taft,,1727.299,1728.277,"Yes, yes I would."
1975.74-1542,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1749.657,1752.034,"What is the ultimate solution then, Mr. Taft?"
1975.74-1542,1,38388,peter_r_taft,,1784.351,1794.299,"No, Your Honor, I would suggest that this can be brought up in enforcement that in this case of a shutdown of electric plants, you would have to balance again the health factors involved."
1975.74-1542,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1841.531,1851.321,"Mr. Taft, when would an equitable decree of this kind be handed down by Court?"
1975.74-1542,1,38388,peter_r_taft,,1871.736,1879.386,"That Your Honor, I think it would be in a Trial Court when an enforcement proceeding is brought under such in 113 because at that time that could be heard."
1975.74-1542,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1879.386,1882.335,When the parties have reached an impasse?
1975.74-1542,1,38388,peter_r_taft,,1882.335,1883.996,"That would be correct, Your Honor."
1975.74-1542,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1883.996,1889.129,The utility would say we got to put the lights out.
1975.74-1542,1,38388,peter_r_taft,,1897.144,1908.093,"I would suggest to the Court that if you look under Section 113 that when he enters an order first, an order of compliance, it requires a conference."
1975.74-1542,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1955.521,1967.88,"You are suggesting that the decree of the Eighth Circuit, the judgment of the Eight Circuit be affirmed and that the parties then proceed to the point where they have a type of hearing you are now describing?"
1975.74-1542,1,38388,peter_r_taft,,1967.88,1968.081,"Yes, Your Honor."
1975.74-1542,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1968.081,1980.129,"That it would be any res judicata the effect of the Eighth Circuit decision, would the company be free to raise every issue that it raised there?"
1975.74-1542,1,38388,peter_r_taft,,1980.129,1991.957,They would be free to raise any question or issue that has not been reviewed by the Court of Appeals on the action of the administrator of the EPA.
1975.74-1542,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2029.292,2039.731,Is that the section that provides in substance that the plan must be implemented as promptly as practicable and in any event within three years?
1975.74-1542,1,38388,peter_r_taft,,2039.731,2041.931,"Yes, Your Honor, 110 (a) (2), yes."
1975.74-1542,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2041.931,2057.106,"Well, do you think the requirement that the plan be put into effect as promptly as practicable is affected by the feasibility of the plan as it affects a given utility for example?"
1975.74-1542,1,38388,peter_r_taft,,2057.106,2063.114,"May it please the Court, three years has passed and as result we have run into the absolute barrier of the three years."
1975.74-1542,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2068.328,2072.422,However impractical the plan may be after the three years?
1975.74-1542,1,38388,peter_r_taft,,2072.422,2074.592,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1975.74-1542,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2105.685,2112.351,"I am not sure I can reconcile that with your footnote on the bottom page 36, Mr. Taft."
1975.74-1542,1,38388,peter_r_taft,,2153.428,2154.529,May it please the Court.
1975.74-1542,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2181.761,2183.354,That is not a (Inaudible) constitutional.
1975.74-1542,1,38388,peter_r_taft,,2191.71,2192.362,Right.
1975.74-1542,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2380.209,2384.689,"Excuse me, I do not have the statute, that is part of the statute in front of me just to follow you."
1975.74-1542,1,38388,peter_r_taft,,2388.32,2389.954,The governor of the state must --
1975.74-1542,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2389.954,2396.901,"Supposing that the state is against the utility as it is here and the state is satisfied, what can the utility do to raise a 110 (f) issues?"
1975.74-1542,1,38388,peter_r_taft,,2397.3,2397.91,It cannot.
1975.74-1542,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2398.548,2402.258,"So, that really is not relevant to Union Electric’s argument here then, is it not?"
1975.74-1542,1,38388,peter_r_taft,,2402.258,2404.469,I do not know if they tried.
1975.74-1542,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2404.469,2407.519,Let me put it just a little differently.
1975.74-1542,1,38388,peter_r_taft,,2411.452,2411.988,That is correct.
1975.74-1542,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2411.988,2416.321,-- they may not raise technological factors as I understand your position.
1975.74-1542,1,38388,peter_r_taft,,2434.43,2436.069,I am not sure if many would.
1975.74-1542,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2436.069,2436.583,I do not think there will be any?
1975.74-1542,1,38388,peter_r_taft,,2436.583,2440.23,(Voice Overlap) Most of them would be for a different kind of plaintiff.
1975.74-1542,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2443.098,2450.444,"So really, if we are talking about the review of the request of a utility, this provision really is a nullity?"
1975.74-1542,1,38388,peter_r_taft,,2450.444,2455.852,"Well, I do not think it would have tremendous benefit to them, no."
1975.74-1542,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2456.91,2458.157,I just could not think of any one.
1975.74-1542,1,38388,peter_r_taft,,2459.308,2461.436,But there are many that could come in under that.
1975.74-1542,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2466.912,2472.228,"Yes, an environmental proof might come in and say the standards are not strict enough that sort of thing?"
1975.74-1542,1,38388,peter_r_taft,,2472.228,2474.667,It is more likely to be the kind you get.
1975.74-1542,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2474.667,2488.245,"Mr. Taft, before you go on, do you consider the decisions in this area in I think the Fourth, Sixth, and Seventh Circuits are in conflict with the decision of the Eighth Circuit in this case?"
1975.74-1542,1,38388,peter_r_taft,,2488.245,2503.327,"I would say that the Sixth and Seventh as far was directly before the Court namely that under Section 307 (b), a review proceeding of the plan where the administrator’s action on the plan cannot bring up these factors."
1975.74-1542,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2514.343,2515.642,What about the Fourth?
1975.74-1542,1,38388,peter_r_taft,,2515.642,2523.933,"The Fourth and Third, both I think are in direct conflict, yes."
1975.74-1542,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2635.272,2638.539,"Mr. Taft, may I ask another procedural question."
1975.74-1542,1,38388,peter_r_taft,,2649.922,2654.133,I am informed that they can bring a declaratory judgment action any time.
1975.74-1542,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2656.092,2657.887,(Voice Overlap) State Court.
1975.74-1542,1,38388,peter_r_taft,,2658.223,2660.025,"Yes, in the State Courts."
1975.74-1542,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2688.029,2698.826,But Missouri is under some constraint I suppose in granting a variance in that it may not so amend its plan that it could no longer meet the approval of the administrator?
1975.74-1542,1,38388,peter_r_taft,,2698.826,2700.39,That is correct.
1975.74-1542,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2724.453,2734.092,"What happens, Mr. Taft, if the state runs a variance which the EPA does not agree with or approve?"
1975.74-1542,1,38388,peter_r_taft,,2734.092,2742.777,"Well, whether the EPA agrees or not, if it meets the primary air quality standards under 110 (a) (2) it must approve."
1975.74-1542,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2742.777,2744.076,"Well, who decides that?"
1975.74-1542,1,38388,peter_r_taft,,2744.076,2746.69,"Well, the EPA must."
1975.74-1542,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2746.69,2751.287,Suppose I am proposing a confrontation?
1975.74-1542,1,38388,peter_r_taft,,2751.287,2763.136,"Well, if the EPA says that they do not meet the primary air quality standard under the variance, then you have a question that will go to the Court of Appeals on review under 307."
1975.74-1542,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2763.136,2769.268,Are the sanctions done against the state or against the utility?
1975.74-1542,1,38388,peter_r_taft,,2769.268,2792.568,"Well, the review itself, if the review upheld the utility would be that the revision would direct I suppose a number of things among other things, it could direct the EPA to approve the change if in fact the utility was right that the primary air quality standards were still met under the variance."
1975.74-1542,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2825.958,2830.833,"You do not question, I take it, the right to be heard somewhere, do you?"
1975.74-1542,1,38388,peter_r_taft,,2830.833,2831.73,"I do, Your Honor."
1975.74-1542,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2831.73,2833.454,You do?
1975.74-1542,1,38388,peter_r_taft,,2833.454,2838.263,"Well, I believe that they can be heard under the state implementation plan in the state courts?"
1975.74-1542,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2838.263,2847.241,"But again, are you suggesting no right to a due process hearing before a utility plan is closed down?"
1975.74-1542,1,38388,peter_r_taft,,2849.663,2853.92,"Your Honor, I think that there may be constitutional grounds or maybe due process grounds."
1975.74-1542,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2855.351,2860.138,"Well, you are entitled to a due process hearing before the automobile can be repossessed?"
1975.74-1542,1,38388,peter_r_taft,,2860.138,2867.902,"Well, that clearly is an enforcement type hearing where absolutely you are entitled to an adjudicatory hearing before a court."
1975.74-1542,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2869.34,2874.3,So you agree that the utility is entitled to a due process hearing somewhere?
1975.74-1542,1,38388,peter_r_taft,,2874.3,2877.111,"Yes, I do not know what the grounds could be heard on."
1975.74-1542,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2880.108,2885.378,The ground would be either that the plant would shutdown.
1975.74-1542,1,38388,peter_r_taft,,2953.023,2960.039,"May it please the Court, I think and this goes into the enforcement on where it should be heard, assuming that there is a thing there to be heard."
1975.74-1542,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3303.186,3305.688,"Mr. Taft, let me just get one thing off my mind."
1975.74-1542,1,38388,peter_r_taft,,3319.486,3325.604,"May it please the Court, I am not sure what -- I am not conceding what the standards would be or what could be raised."
1975.74-1542,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3332.027,3337.199,You are not -- you are saying it is possible that their argument might be successful in an enforcement proceeding.
1975.74-1542,1,38388,peter_r_taft,,3341.497,3347.737,"Well, the question is what the grounds could be that they would raise and I think you have to go case by case when that happens."
1975.74-1542,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3349.349,3358.677,Is it the position of the Solicitor General or does he have a position on whether these issues maybe raised in an enforcement proceeding?
1975.74-1542,1,38388,peter_r_taft,,3358.677,3372.184,"Your Honor, I think that it would not be strictly that the plan is void if feasibility is not economically or technologically achievable because the power to close was there and Congress saw it."
1975.74-1542,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3383.467,3387.526,"(Voice Overlap) danger of close, I mean, it is always possible to close?"
1975.74-1542,1,38388,peter_r_taft,,3387.526,3388.412,"Well, at that point the Health --"
1975.74-1542,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3388.412,3401.112,I think the question would be if the defendant could show that it was impossible to comply without closing would that be a defense in an enforcement proceeding or an issue that could be properly be raised in enforcement proceeding?
1975.74-1542,1,38388,peter_r_taft,,3401.112,3418.344,"If it were electricity and turning out the lights, if it were a marginal and weak plant that is not involved with utilities which is producing say some product and produces SO2, it is a marginal plan, it is a weak company, it cannot comply."
1975.74-1542,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3421.429,3434.997,"Well, the question, if that is an issue that the defendant in the judgment of the Solicitor General, is that an issue which can appropriately be raised in an enforcement proceeding (a) civil (b) criminal?"
1975.74-1542,1,38388,peter_r_taft,,3434.997,3437.479,"(a) Yes, I think it can be raised."
1975.74-1542,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3468.394,3473.392,"Meanwhile the utilities must be a little bit uncertainty, is that not so?"
1975.74-1542,1,38388,peter_r_taft,,3473.392,3474.163,"Yes, Your Honor."
1975.74-1542,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3499.101,3507.18,"Mr. Taft, we are dealing with the utility and I supposed that it is regular industry, I suppose it is regulated by the state, is it not?"
1975.74-1542,1,38388,peter_r_taft,,3507.18,3508.477,That is correct.
1975.74-1542,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3508.477,3512.951,And its rate will have to have state approval?
1975.74-1542,1,38388,peter_r_taft,,3512.951,3513.235,"Yes, Your Honor."
1975.74-1542,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3513.235,3520.477,And I suppose that it is obligated to perform service until it is permitted to close.
1975.74-1542,1,38388,peter_r_taft,,3528.042,3529.406,The state is heavily involved.
1975.74-1542,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3548.823,3557.455,"There is no chance any way the utility will say, well, I must obey the law, namely the Clean Air Act and therefore I shall shutdown and tell nobody."
1975.74-1542,1,38388,peter_r_taft,,3558.022,3559.167,If you helping me out.
1975.74-1542,2,44647,william_h_ferrell,,3568.368,3582.612,"If I may Your Honor, I would like to take only one or two minutes to not to respond point by point and then extend the argument that have been made."
