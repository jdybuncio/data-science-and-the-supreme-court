1975.74-754,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,14.992,We will hear arguments first this morning in number 74-754 United States against Mandujano.
1975.74-754,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,17.509,21.025,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1975.74-754,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,276.714,283.937,"Excuse me, Mr. Frey you mentioned that he had been advised of his privilege on more than one occasion?"
1975.74-754,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,283.937,288.127,"Yes, it is on bottom of page 5, top of page 6."
1975.74-754,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,288.127,299.74,"I wish then to ask, I gather in Court of Appeals though at page 1190 the warnings that were given were not adequate in advisory although even though the appellees Fifth Amendment rights against self-incrimination?"
1975.74-754,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,299.74,302.777,"Well, that of course is a matter of debate."
1975.74-754,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,305.937,310.317,"Yes, I see but do we have an issue whether they were or were not adequate?"
1975.74-754,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,310.317,320.396,"Well, it is a subsidiary issue if you get pass the question of whether any warning is required then there would be question as the adequacy of the warnings that were given."
1975.74-754,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,320.396,325.672,"Mr. Frey, is there any question that he did not understand what was asked and what he answered?"
1975.74-754,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,325.672,326.615,"Well, it is --"
1975.74-754,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,326.615,333.911,"As I read the testimony, he sounds perfectly capable of speaking English and he did have a Tenth grade education."
1975.74-754,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,333.911,345.735,"Well, Mr. Justice Blackmun, when he was first told that you are required to answer all the questions, I ask you accept for the ones that you feel would tend to incriminate you, do you understand that?"
1975.74-754,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,367.269,378.507,"But I take it he –- Well, am I correct in my impression that he had no struggle with the English language despite his Spanish surname?"
1975.74-754,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,378.507,384.893,I think that the appendix does not reveal any substantial difficulty in understanding.
1975.74-754,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,411.495,414.855,Did Cavalier had his name appear before this grand jury?
1975.74-754,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,414.855,417.721,I believe he had not at that point.
1975.74-754,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,417.721,425.207,"What did you say the purpose was of asking him questions, the answers to which prosecutor already knew?"
1975.74-754,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,425.207,427.402,"Well, the prosecutor explained that."
1975.74-754,1,36477,michael_allen_peters,,1820.924,1825.624,Mr. Chief Justice and members of the Supreme Court.
1975.74-754,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1997.232,2002.519,What provision of the constitution do you think requires that?
1975.74-754,1,36477,michael_allen_peters,,2002.519,2020.657,"Well, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, I believe that the Fifth Amendment against the compulsion, against testifying against oneself incorporates that aspect --"
1975.74-754,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2020.657,2035.309,"What will you do with our Monia case where we say that if you want to claim the Fifth Amendment, you have to do it before the grand jury that if you voluntarily answer, it is not compelled?"
1975.74-754,1,36477,michael_allen_peters,,2035.309,2046.687,"Well, I would say that Monia applies to the normal grand jury witness whereas here we have a special creature, the period of defendant concept."
1975.74-754,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2046.687,2050.577,Why is that different for purposes of the Fifth Amendment?
1975.74-754,1,36477,michael_allen_peters,,2050.577,2081.929,"Well, here a normal ordinary grand jury witness when he subpoenaed to appear, and I would say that even a defendant who is subpoenaed to appear is not entitled to any kind of pre-warnings until the special prosecutor or the grand jury specifically go into the actual evidence which they have on that individual."
1975.74-754,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2115.022,2125.174,Is there any indication in Monia that the witness there was warned or that he had a particularly clear understanding.
1975.74-754,1,36477,michael_allen_peters,,2125.174,2129.5,I really do not recall the facts of Monia that clearly Justice Rehnquist.
1975.74-754,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2129.5,2132.879,But you just made a statement that he had an obvious language problem.
1975.74-754,1,36477,michael_allen_peters,,2151.322,2151.873,Yes Your Honor.
1975.74-754,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2151.873,2159.676,"And that means through the second year or end of high school, he should be able to read and write."
1975.74-754,1,36477,michael_allen_peters,,2161.488,2172.886,"Well, based on Mr. Mandujano’s -- the school systems these days, Justice Blackmun are lack a lot to be desired."
1975.74-754,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2204.836,2206.144,"Well, he certainly speaks very well."
1975.74-754,1,36477,michael_allen_peters,,2212.118,2215.037,"Well, it is not the misuse of the word."
1975.74-754,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2222.281,2235.481,"If you look at the middle of appendix 15 where they were cross-examining or examining him about whether he bought heroine and he answered, “No Sir, I used to shoplift all the time.”"
1975.74-754,1,36477,michael_allen_peters,,2245.644,2246.562,Well let us say that the --
1975.74-754,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2246.562,2247.813,Just below mid-page.
1975.74-754,1,36477,michael_allen_peters,,2262.838,2289.974,"Indeed, we are Mr. Chief Justice but I would point out that here he may have a partial understanding of some of the questions and some of the words association but indeed, when he is asked a simple thing like what is the address that he is living."
1975.74-754,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2336.664,2338.796,Have you ever been in San Antonio?
1975.74-754,1,36477,michael_allen_peters,,2338.796,2341.866,I have been there on a couple occasions Justice.
1975.74-754,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2341.866,2343.87,They have a very good school system.
1975.74-754,1,36477,michael_allen_peters,,2347.753,2351.147,"Well, I would just make a presumption that --"
1975.74-754,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2351.147,2359.275,And the presumption is that if a person with a tenth grade education understands English.
1975.74-754,1,36477,michael_allen_peters,,2368.709,2381.931,"Well Mr. Justice Marshall, I would say that my limited experience of understanding the school system, my wife being a school teacher herself."
1975.74-754,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2395.73,2401.126,Well are you a better judge of a person’s reading ability than the school officials?
1975.74-754,1,36477,michael_allen_peters,,2401.126,2402.571,Possibly not.
1975.74-754,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2402.571,2403.83,Possibly?
1975.74-754,1,36477,michael_allen_peters,,2404.253,2405.134,"No, Justice Marshall."
1975.74-754,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2405.134,2417.864,"Well, they say he has got (Inaudibe) by saying that in your opinion he has not got a tenth grade education?"
1975.74-754,1,36477,michael_allen_peters,,2417.864,2426.46,"Yes, Justice Marshall."
1975.74-754,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2457.027,2458.476,Mr. Peters --
1975.74-754,1,36477,michael_allen_peters,,2458.476,2459.056,"Yes, Justice."
1975.74-754,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2459.056,2467.754,Would your position be the same if the respondent had been a Ph.D.?
1975.74-754,1,36477,michael_allen_peters,,2467.754,2476.742,"I would say, yes my position would be the same in that here they as in the instance of the Ph.D."
1975.74-754,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2509.41,2523.325,"So, your argument about the tenth grade education and the possible limitations of respondent’s capacity to understand English are peripheral to your central position here?"
1975.74-754,1,36477,michael_allen_peters,,2523.325,2558.789,I would say Mr. Justice Powell that that is true but the overall argument and the final result of the Fifth Circuit’s decision show and intend to show that his whole atmosphere before the grand jury on Mr. Mandujano was overwhelming and his tenth grade education was just one aspect of his whole presence and understanding.
1975.74-754,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2558.789,2569.54,Would your position require us to examine the facts in each case to determine whether or not the atmosphere was coercive?
1975.74-754,1,36477,michael_allen_peters,,2569.54,2583.844,"Mr. Justice Powell, I would say that it would not be on a basis of a case to case examination of the individual facts."
1975.74-754,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2642.13,2644.525,Does only the perjury count here?
1975.74-754,1,36477,michael_allen_peters,,2651.345,2654.729,Mr. Justice White I am not certain I understand your question.
1975.74-754,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2654.729,2659.291,"Well, the case that he was indicted on two counts, was he?"
1975.74-754,1,36477,michael_allen_peters,,2659.291,2664.491,Yes was one for the count of attempt to distribution of one ounce of heroin.
1975.74-754,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2664.491,2666.403,"Now he has been convicted on that, has he not?"
1975.74-754,1,36477,michael_allen_peters,,2666.403,2667.021,"Yes, he has Your Honor."
1975.74-754,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2667.021,2670.138,Without the benefit of – Without this evidence.
1975.74-754,1,36477,michael_allen_peters,,2670.138,2670.703,That is correct Your Honor.
1975.74-754,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2670.703,2692.551,"And so if we were to decide that even if Miranda Warnings should have been given and were not nevertheless, his answers were admissible in a perjury prosecution."
1975.74-754,1,36477,michael_allen_peters,,2695.817,2698.549,I would say that --
1975.74-754,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2698.549,2701.158,Is that right or not?
1975.74-754,1,36477,michael_allen_peters,,2701.158,2702.788,Mr. Justice White I would say no.
1975.74-754,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2717.948,2731.306,That is what Court of Appeals said normally answers -- even if you should have not been asked a question; you are not supposed to lie in the answer in many ways.
1975.74-754,1,36477,michael_allen_peters,,2732.734,2734.983,"Yes, Mr. Justice White."
1975.74-754,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2734.983,2739.494,And the Court of Appeals says we will make a slight in role on that rule in this case.
1975.74-754,1,36477,michael_allen_peters,,2746.184,2748.384,"I apparently, I did not understand you question Mr. Justice White."
1975.74-754,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2751.349,2754.016,"That would finish the case, would it not?"
1975.74-754,1,36477,michael_allen_peters,,2763.413,2769.932,That is correct.
1975.74-754,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2783.744,2786.407,No doubt about that but --
1975.74-754,1,36477,michael_allen_peters,,2790.78,2791.566,That is correct.
1975.74-754,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2791.566,2793.057,We would have said that.
1975.74-754,1,36477,michael_allen_peters,,2797.479,2799.79,Yes Mr. Justice Brennan.
1975.74-754,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2887.333,2902.514,"But even if you are right about the warnings that it is unfair the government to call someone whom as you described in the Fifth Circuit describes a putative defendant, that does not give the man called a license to perjure himself, does it?"
1975.74-754,1,36477,michael_allen_peters,,2902.514,2935.172,"Well, that would apply in all other cases except before the case before the bar and as the Lower Courts have held that there must be some exception consider the analogy of Miranda if there is a fair to give Miranda Warnings at the time for risk, statements would be suppressed and we are asking for the same remedy to compensate and counter this totally unfair proceeding in which my client was participated in."
1975.74-754,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2935.172,2943.995,"Well, but suppose you suppress statements where he might have claimed the Fifth Amendment but did not, because you say he did not get a warning."
1975.74-754,1,36477,michael_allen_peters,,2953.964,2991.414,"Well, he was put in a position where in the government rarely concedes that in a companion case arising out of the Western District of Texas in Rangel(ph), they felt that indeed warnings were to be given and they did not petition this Court to consider that question because they felt that Mr. Rangel because of the implications of the so called warning given that he was compelled and given the Murphy Waterfront --"
1975.74-754,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2991.414,2994.37,Was he convicted of perjury too?
1975.74-754,1,36477,michael_allen_peters,,2994.37,3006.443,They did proceed in neither the substantive nor the perjury count in Mr. Rangel’s case.
1975.74-754,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3162.14,3164.835,Mr. Peters let me interrupt you.
1975.74-754,1,36477,michael_allen_peters,,3188.594,3201.962,Oh Mr. Justice Blackmun I think that indeed the Miranda Warnings as they have been established by this Court should apply but I think also that --
1975.74-754,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3201.962,3204.718,Including the right to counsel?
1975.74-754,1,36477,michael_allen_peters,,3204.718,3206.13,Including right to counsel.
1975.74-754,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3206.13,3210.808,Where would he be in the grand jury room?
1975.74-754,1,36477,michael_allen_peters,,3210.808,3229.28,"I would say that if he were not in the grand jury room and I know this is not the practice in the Federal Courts but if you were not in the grand jury room, the grand jury itself might think that every departure confer with this counsel with obviously indicate --"
1975.74-754,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3229.28,3236.383,"Who on that approach appoints as in indigent, if the witness is an indigent and has no counsel?"
1975.74-754,1,36477,michael_allen_peters,,3240.069,3244.824,It would be the presiding judge of the grand jury.
1975.74-754,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3244.824,3252.234,"You mention about the federal grand jury, under Texas State procedure, is the counsel allowed in the grand jury room?"
1975.74-754,1,36477,michael_allen_peters,,3252.234,3283.956,No Your Honor but I would point out that in reading the post this morning that Illinois has adapted a state proceeding wherein they have incorporated the basis of the respondent’s position in this case including having the presence of counsel seated in the grand jury room with his client during the entire proceeding and they have incorporated this under Illinois Law.
1975.74-754,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3283.956,3291.81,Of course the state may do anything at once within federal constitutional limits or its own State Constitution?
1975.74-754,1,36477,michael_allen_peters,,3291.81,3298.661,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice."
1975.74-754,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3408.154,3418.427,"But when they asked him about the crime itself, he may not only claim the Fifth Amendment but he may perjure himself according to your submission?"
1975.74-754,1,36477,michael_allen_peters,,3418.427,3422.694,"Yes, Mr. Justice Rehnquist that is my position."
1975.74-754,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3422.694,3423.953,And with the impunity.
1975.74-754,1,36477,michael_allen_peters,,3423.953,3470.166,"And with impunity in this limited instance, it is a counter measure of fundamentally unfair proceeding and I would ask this Court to adapt the Betts versus Brady decision in which the Fifth Circuit relies on and that is totally fundamentally unfair that the individual in this limited instance, the statements must be suppressed and I would ask this Court to suppress and affirm the Court decisions below."
1975.74-754,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3470.758,3471.757,Thank you gentlemen.
