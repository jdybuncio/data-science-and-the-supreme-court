1980.79-983,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,12.141,"We will hear argument first this morning in 79-983, United States v. Will, and 79-1689, United States v. Will."
1980.79-983,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,15.193,19.545,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1980.79-983,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,323.526,325.895,And that can be downward as well as upward?
1980.79-983,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,325.895,334.234,"The President's recommendation could conceivably be downwards, and generally it is downwards rather than upward."
1980.79-983,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,468.488,472.206,"Mr. Geller, what was the basis of the District of Court's jurisdiction?"
1980.79-983,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,472.206,474.024,The Tucker Act.
1980.79-983,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,474.024,480.628,Would the Government be in a better position here if the Tucker Act had been repealed or never been enacted?
1980.79-983,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,480.628,491.186,"Well, there would be some question whether judges would have a right to sue because they're claiming under the Compensation Clause of the Constitution."
1980.79-983,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,566.936,575.274,"Now, this deals with the 4.8 that might otherwise have become effective on October 1... what?"
1980.79-983,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,576.459,582.28,"Well, actually, I was just referring to the 1977 legislation which wiped out--"
1980.79-983,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,582.28,586.832,"Well, the 29-whatever-that-percentage-was, that became effective when?"
1980.79-983,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,587.665,589.098,"--That became... March of '77, that's right."
1980.79-983,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,596.854,608.161,"Well, do we have any case here that involves the 4.8-whatever-that-percentage-was, effective in October of '76, or is that--"
1980.79-983,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,608.161,609.361,"Yes, that is in this case."
1980.79-983,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,611.53,618.267,--And you just said that the increase in 29-whatever-it-was that became effective in March of '77--
1980.79-983,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,618.267,618.867,Right.
1980.79-983,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,618.867,623.755,--what bearing did that have on the 4.8?
1980.79-983,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,623.755,627.29,That set a new base salary level for judges.
1980.79-983,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,627.29,634.063,"And in doing that did Congress supersede whatever the increase was, the 4.8?"
1980.79-983,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,634.063,634.713,"Well, no."
1980.79-983,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,648.554,654.374,"What you're saying is, Congress meant to eliminate that 4.8 in light of the 29 that became effective in March, '77?"
1980.79-983,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,654.374,661.046,"Well, what Congress meant to eliminate in light of the 30 percent increase judges got was the 7.2 percent salary increase--"
1980.79-983,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,661.046,661.963,That's what I'm trying to get to.
1980.79-983,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,661.963,662.413,--Yes.
1980.79-983,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,662.413,664.082,And it had no bearing on the 4.8?
1980.79-983,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,664.082,668.534,Only in the sense that the base salary had been paid.
1980.79-983,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,668.534,677.24,"No, what I'm trying to get at is, did Congress say anything in respect to the 29-point... that it was supersede any of the 4.8?"
1980.79-983,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,677.24,677.773,No.
1980.79-983,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,677.773,678.342,All right.
1980.79-983,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,678.342,690.399,But there are a number of statements in the legislative history that talk about superseding the 7.2 percent that was going to become effective in October of '77 because it would have been two salary increases in one year.
1980.79-983,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,690.399,707.075,"Well, then, you don't think, then, that that quadrennial increase was effective to wipe out any entitlement to any prior cost-of-living increases?"
1980.79-983,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,707.075,711.146,"Well, it only became effective in March, 1977."
1980.79-983,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,723.871,725.021,If they were entitled to it?
1980.79-983,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,725.021,725.954,If they were entitled to it.
1980.79-983,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,726.787,0.0,I see.
1980.79-983,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,738.678,738.845,That's right.
1980.79-983,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,741.278,0.0,I got it.
1980.79-983,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,741.444,744.646,--the only relevance it has to this lawsuit is the back pay issue.
1980.79-983,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,744.646,752.05,So it did effect a permanent disentitlement to the 4.8 percent?
1980.79-983,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,752.05,753.502,As a continuing matter.
1980.79-983,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,753.502,754.469,"Yes, all right; fine."
1980.79-983,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,754.469,756.621,"Mr. Geller, let me get this clear."
1980.79-983,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,771.63,772.13,That's right.
1980.79-983,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,783.836,790.858,"Well, your brief doesn't make this clear, but it's... but that's wholly consistent with your position, I must say."
1980.79-983,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,790.858,803.999,"Just as if the current salary, the current quadrennial review process that's now beginning will set a new salary level for judges, presumably, unless the President or Congress doesn't go along with the recommendations."
1980.79-983,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,817.409,820.361,Provided that the new level is higher than the percentages involved?
1980.79-983,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,820.361,823.063,"--Providing that it is, yes."
1980.79-983,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,823.063,824.629,"If it's not, of course, then the issue will remain."
1980.79-983,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,824.629,825.348,That's right.
1980.79-983,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,825.348,826.081,All right.
1980.79-983,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,841.774,848.444,"Well, that just sets the base salary for district judges."
1980.79-983,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,861.521,864.24,"""As adjusted, each judge""... and this is the district judge..."
1980.79-983,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,872.912,0.0,--Right.
1980.79-983,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,874.628,877.278,That is the statutory salary that a judge receives.
1980.79-983,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,877.278,881.782,"--Well, that is the statute that sets forth the components of a judge's salary and it refers to other statutes."
1980.79-983,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,884.651,887.27,"It says, ""Each judge shall receive"" that salary."
1980.79-983,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,889.722,898.743,"Well, I don't even mention that because there's a separate statute for each branch of the federal judiciary, and all it does is relate how all the other statutes work."
1980.79-983,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,898.743,900.427,"Well, that's all it does, but it does do that."
1980.79-983,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,900.427,900.827,Yes.
1980.79-983,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,904.414,907.016,"That language is mandatory, is it not?"
1980.79-983,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,907.016,912.385,That is the salary that a district judge gets as provided in Section 135.
1980.79-983,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,912.385,914.468,And then there's a separate statute for circuit judges and--
1980.79-983,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,914.468,918.539,"Circuit judges, Supreme Court Justices, and for other parts of the federal judiciary."
1980.79-983,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,918.539,921.824,"--But each one is similar, or is it?"
1980.79-983,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,921.824,922.441,That's right.
1980.79-983,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,947.689,960.866,"Mr. Geller, for a moment, on the September 30, '78, statute, is that the only one of these statutes in which Congress expressly limited the effect of the statute to the then, to the year involved?"
1980.79-983,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,960.866,961.399,No--
1980.79-983,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,961.399,961.882,"It says,"
1980.79-983,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,971.924,972.19,--Yes.
1980.79-983,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,983.481,987.749,Each of the Acts by its terms applies only to one year.
1980.79-983,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,987.749,988.683,That's right.
1980.79-983,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,988.683,995.087,"Now, is that the Act that was signed by the President late in the afternoon of October 1?"
1980.79-983,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,995.087,998.907,"No, I'm just talking about the 1979."
1980.79-983,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,998.907,999.907,I know that.
1980.79-983,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1002.193,1005.061,"No, the '76 Act was signed on October 1st."
1980.79-983,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1005.061,1009.847,And was signed but... sometime later in the day of October 1st?
1980.79-983,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1009.847,1013.167,"Well, sometime on October 1st."
1980.79-983,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1014.833,1018.452,"But it was substantially after midnight, or one minute after--"
1980.79-983,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1018.452,1020.654,I assume that it was not signed substantially after--
1980.79-983,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1020.654,1023.939,--And that presents a question about your--
1980.79-983,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1023.939,1026.391,--There is a question--
1980.79-983,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1026.391,1027.307,--Under the diminution clause in there.
1980.79-983,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1027.307,1028.057,--That's correct.
1980.79-983,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1036.08,1054.891,"Well, Mr. Geller, as part of the facts... I take it this is part of the facts... on October 1, 1979, the Government seems to agree, at least in its brief, that the October 1 increase did go into effect--"
1980.79-983,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1054.891,1055.591,Yes.
1980.79-983,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1055.591,1059.112,--along with the increase that had been suspended for the prior year.
1980.79-983,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1059.112,1059.878,That's right.
1980.79-983,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1059.878,1063.064,So that it's for a total of 12.9 percent--
1980.79-983,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1063.064,1063.097,12.9 percent.
1980.79-983,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1063.097,1064.263,--did go into effect?
1980.79-983,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1064.263,1064.897,Yes.
1980.79-983,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1071.851,1075.469,Or for any other part of the Executive Branch or not?
1980.79-983,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1075.469,1087.211,"Or for any other part of the Executive Branch although, just to complicate matters further for officials other than judges, salary doesn't take effect on October 1st but on the first pay period after October 1st."
1980.79-983,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1088.377,1089.21,I see; I see.
1980.79-983,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1090.01,1104.637,"--Appellees representing the classes of federal judges affected by these pay acts brought these actions under the Tucker Act in February, 1978, and October, 1979."
1980.79-983,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1206.537,1209.254,"Well, did the District court have jurisdiction?"
1980.79-983,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1209.254,1211.672,It had jurisdiction under the Tucker Act.
1980.79-983,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1211.672,1215.31,Even if the judge was disqualified?
1980.79-983,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1215.31,1217.626,"Well, I'm now going to get to the question of his qualifications."
1980.79-983,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1217.626,1218.678,"But let's assume he was, though."
1980.79-983,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1218.678,1223.897,"Assuming he was disqualified, we don't view the question of disqualification as jurisdictional in nature."
1980.79-983,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1226.516,1229.884,In which event we would have appellate jurisdiction?
1980.79-983,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1229.884,1230.32,Exactly.
1980.79-983,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1230.32,1231.286,Even if we were disqualified?
1980.79-983,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1231.286,1232.62,That is our view.
1980.79-983,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1313.889,1336.672,"If you were drawing a disqualification statute for judges, wouldn't this be one of the very first things that you would consider, a case in which they were passing on their own salaries?"
1980.79-983,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1336.672,1342.576,"Yes, and it is, I think clearly within the judicial recusal statute that... this situation."
1980.79-983,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1370.41,1377.297,"Mr. Geller, would you tell me your understanding of, if you had to state the rule."
1980.79-983,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1378.647,1390.538,"My understanding is that when every judge is disqualified from hearing a case, then no judge is disqualified simply by virtue of the disqualifying factor."
1980.79-983,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1409.066,1411.784,"And this is not a matter of statutory construction, is it?"
1980.79-983,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1411.784,1416.588,"--Well, I suppose there would be a separate question presented--"
1980.79-983,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1416.588,1421.992,Does it appear that Congress ever addressed this question when they drafted that 455?
1980.79-983,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1421.992,1426.044,--There is precious little discussion in the history of it.
1980.79-983,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1426.044,1429.396,"And certainly, on the face of it, it's flat and mandatory that--"
1980.79-983,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1429.396,1437.769,We think it would have been quite remarkable that Congress would have intended to abrogate the rule of necessity without saying so.
1980.79-983,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1437.769,1440.12,--Then you are suggesting we read in the rule of necessity?
1980.79-983,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1440.12,1440.587,Yes.
1980.79-983,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1442.27,1443.253,Imply it or what?
1980.79-983,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1443.253,1450.943,"Well, there were previous judicial recusal statutes before Section 455 and the rule of necessity was applied to them."
1980.79-983,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1454.661,1458.299,"Well, I gather you are saying then that this is a statutory construction question?"
1980.79-983,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1458.299,1461.666,--I think it is a common law rule which Congress has not abrogated.
1980.79-983,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1461.666,1465.035,"And so we should say, except where the rule of necessity applies?"
1980.79-983,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1465.035,1465.402,Yes.
1980.79-983,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1465.402,1466.352,And add it on to the statute?
1980.79-983,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1466.352,1467.185,Excuse me.
1980.79-983,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1467.351,1470.137,We should add on to the statute an exception?
1980.79-983,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1470.137,1478.291,"I think it's a well recognized exception that was read into all the previous judicial recusal statutes, and, yes, I think the Court should do the same here."
1980.79-983,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1478.291,1490.531,"If all the members of this Court were disqualified under 455, what would be the consequence in terms of the judgments that you're asking to be reviewed?"
1980.79-983,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1491.566,1497.47,"It would depend, Mr. Chief Justice, on why the Court decided that the members of this Court were disqualified."
1980.79-983,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1515.249,1518.868,"Well, if we're disqualified to sit, how can we decide anything?"
1980.79-983,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1518.868,1533.127,"Well, I think under the same rationale that allows this Court to determine whether it has jurisdiction or even in cases where the Court clearly doesn't have jurisdiction because the issue is moot."
1980.79-983,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1540.831,1544.101,"You told us at the outset that this is not a matter of jurisdiction, I thought?"
1980.79-983,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1544.101,1553.724,"--That's correct, and why I think I'm consistent in saying that the Court would have the power to send the case back to the District Court with instructions to vacate that judgment."
1980.79-983,1,33821,kevin_m_forde,,2535.372,2537.89,"Your Honors, may it please the Court:"
1980.79-983,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2557.403,2558.953,I'm having a little difficulty hearing you.
1980.79-983,1,33821,kevin_m_forde,,2558.953,2560.203,"--I'm sorry, Justice Brennan."
1980.79-983,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2592.09,2603.379,What canon of ethics imposes a duty on the judiciary to file a suit urging other judges to raise their salary?
1980.79-983,1,33821,kevin_m_forde,,2603.379,2613.169,--Canon 1 of the American Bar Association Canons of Judicial Ethics says it's the responsibility of a judge to preserve the independence of the judiciary.
1980.79-983,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2681.398,2692.538,Yet the Disqualification Act requires a judge to disqualify himself if he owns one share of stock in a corporation that is litigated before the Court.
1980.79-983,1,33821,kevin_m_forde,,2692.538,2694.471,That's correct.
1980.79-983,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2756.593,2758.295,"Now, and what is the rule of necessity?"
1980.79-983,1,33821,kevin_m_forde,,2762.414,2764.616,"If every judge is disqualified, then nobody is disqualified."
1980.79-983,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2764.616,2772.972,"It wouldn't apply, for example, if four members of this Court were for some reason or another disqualified but five were not?"
1980.79-983,1,33821,kevin_m_forde,,2772.972,2774.339,It wouldn't apply.
1980.79-983,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2774.339,2779.542,"This Court couldn't act because there wouldn't be a quorum, but it wouldn't be applicable there, would it?"
1980.79-983,1,33821,kevin_m_forde,,2779.542,2781.425,I don't know; that's an interesting question.
1980.79-983,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2782.577,2791.45,"Well, your rule, as I've phrased it, would not be applicable, which is that the rule of necessity is applicable only if all judges are disqualified."
1980.79-983,1,33821,kevin_m_forde,,2791.45,2805.61,"I think there is an instance, Justice Stewart, where, if my recollection is correct, Chief Justice Stone invoked the rule by implication, at least, because the Court couldn't get a quorum."
1980.79-983,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2815.216,2821.285,"But in any event, in this case, every federal judge is for one reason or two reasons disqualified?"
1980.79-983,1,33821,kevin_m_forde,,2821.285,2822.536,There's no question about that.
1980.79-983,2,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,5301.55,5303.852,"Just a few things, Mr. Chief Justice."
1980.79-983,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,5358.371,5359.771,"Well, it's not entirely technical."
1980.79-983,2,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,5368.644,5373.064,"No, our view is that they could refuse to give it to anyone under the Adjustment Act."
1980.79-983,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,5375.181,5384.254,"Under your view, they could raise the salaries of all government personnel except judges, under the Comparability Act and the Adjustment Act."
1980.79-983,2,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,5384.254,5391.86,"--Well, clearly they could raise up all the salaries under the Comparability Act and do as they've done over the last four years and say, no one under the Adjustment Act can get any raises."
1980.79-983,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,5397.496,5408.887,"Under your view... now, let's get this clear... under your view, as I understand it, Congress clearly could say, henceforth the Adjustment Act shall apply to all federal employees except judges."
1980.79-983,2,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,5408.887,5410.204,"Well, let's not--"
1980.79-983,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,5410.204,5410.923,Isn't that correct?
1980.79-983,2,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,5410.923,5412.756,"--Well, yes, but let me, let's not confuse two things."
1980.79-983,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,5415.975,5416.827,"Well, I understand."
1980.79-983,2,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,5418.143,5418.577,--Right.
1980.79-983,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,5419.527,5421.195,"Article III doesn't apply; therefore, they can do it."
1980.79-983,2,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,5421.195,5421.879,--Exactly; that's right.
1980.79-983,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,5430.199,5430.532,I understand.
