1975.74-100,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,39.561,We will here arguments next in 74-100 Garner against the United States.
1975.74-100,0,17862,burton_marks,,41.857,45.262,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1975.74-100,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,90.796,102.946,"Would he have complied with statute if he had inserted in the year in question, term self-employed speculator?"
1975.74-100,0,17862,burton_marks,,102.946,104.89,Probably not.
1975.74-100,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,146.596,149.345,How about tips?
1975.74-100,0,17862,burton_marks,,154.879,155.879,Payment for tips?
1975.74-100,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,155.879,156.705,Yes.
1975.74-100,0,17862,burton_marks,,156.705,158.974,"Perhaps, it might be."
1975.74-100,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,161.247,170.268,Could he -- could he have answered the question or declined to respond on Fifth Amendment grounds?
1975.74-100,0,17862,burton_marks,,170.268,176.619,"As to his occupation, I do not know."
1975.74-100,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,176.619,178.882,Has not the Treasury Department ruled on that?
1975.74-100,0,17862,burton_marks,,178.882,181.89,They did with respect to Mr. Garner at least --
1975.74-100,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,181.89,183.172,No previously?
1975.74-100,0,17862,burton_marks,,183.172,183.867,Pardon me.
1975.74-100,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,184.937,188.327,"No, previously?"
1975.74-100,0,17862,burton_marks,,188.327,195.452,I really do not know whether they did or not.
1975.74-100,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,299.522,305.481,I do not know that I follow you there Mr. Marks.
1975.74-100,0,17862,burton_marks,,324.418,327.23,"Well, he had not even committed the crime."
1975.74-100,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,343.243,354.707,"Well, but then how was the fact that he admitted to being a wager in 1965 incriminating on the charge that he was -- did in 1968?"
1975.74-100,0,17862,burton_marks,,354.707,370.704,"Well, that was one of the arguments and one of the objections that was raised and there is a footnote in our petition and in our brief, that there is a subsidiary question that was just glossed over and that is how are these returns admissible in any case?"
1975.74-100,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,370.835,373.746,(Voice overlap) the Fifth Amendment?
1975.74-100,0,17862,burton_marks,,373.746,394.268,"Correct, but we also because Haines, Grosso, and Marchetti had just come out, the question of the Fifth Amendment privilege as being applicable to the tax returns was very vital and that was an objection that was raised and that was what the Ninth Circuit finally landed on, that is the important question which is here."
1975.74-100,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,394.268,396.735,What if the prosecution?
1975.74-100,0,17862,burton_marks,,396.735,397.379,"I beg your pardon, sir."
1975.74-100,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,397.379,425.853,"What if the prosecution, instead of putting in the tax returns to establish the fact that he was a gambler, had brought in three bartenders who said over the same period of time that he had bought drinks on the house on many occasions because he was -- made a big killing on the races and he was the best professional gambler in whatever state he was operating?"
1975.74-100,0,17862,burton_marks,,425.853,429.765,I still think it would have been irrelevant unless (Voice Overlap).
1975.74-100,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,429.765,431.395,Would it be admissible?
1975.74-100,0,17862,burton_marks,,431.395,432.108,Would it be admissible?
1975.74-100,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,432.108,434.542,Yes as establishing his occupation?
1975.74-100,0,17862,burton_marks,,434.542,443.979,"Not unless it was exactly at the time in which he was alleged to have committed the crime and he said to the public at large, I am a professional gambler and that is my business."
1975.74-100,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,443.979,447.124,My question assumed that it was covering the same period?
1975.74-100,0,17862,burton_marks,,447.124,449.662,Then it would be admissible as admission against his interest?
1975.74-100,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,449.662,457.577,"Yes, well, but how do you distinguish that from his answering and making the same statement on his tax return?"
1975.74-100,0,17862,burton_marks,,457.577,459.659,Because --
1975.74-100,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,459.659,467.818,When -- unless you can demonstrate that he was absolutely required to put the truth of the matter in the tax return?
1975.74-100,0,17862,burton_marks,,467.818,481.235,"Well, the -- the regulations and the statute require that he put in truthful information and this Court in Max (Ph) versus U.S. said, he better put in truthful information or he cannot assert the privilege under any circumstances."
1975.74-100,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,481.235,483.465,What about my previous question to you.
1975.74-100,0,17862,burton_marks,,487.618,490.719,"Well, if he had done it --"
1975.74-100,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,490.719,496.191,Or refusal to answer on Fifth Amendment grounds right in the return itself?
1975.74-100,0,17862,burton_marks,,496.191,534.764,"Well, the return would not be admissible because it would not have any evidentially value I assume or based on other ground that I forget the case, you could not use the person’s assertion of the privilege against him as an inference of guilt which is a different subject altogether, but I perceive in our case and this is why a very interesting proposition, in Sullivan, this Court said many years ago, you cannot take the privilege against the whole tax return."
1975.74-100,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,956.371,964.045,Is there a constitutional guarantee of the privacy of income tax returns or is it a statutory provision?
1975.74-100,0,17862,burton_marks,,964.045,973.139,I believe that the -- the constitutional guarantee is there in the Ninth and Tenth Amendments.
1975.74-100,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1006.407,1010.172,How do you explain Grand Juries under that theory?
1975.74-100,0,17862,burton_marks,,1010.172,1022.496,"Well frankly, I -- I have -- grand juries I would -- could accept Calandra except for the fact that they are controlled by the United States Attorney’s Office."
1975.74-100,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1022.496,1029.825,"Well, but the -- the fact of the matter is there are cases over a long period of time that said that government has a right to everybody’s testimony."
1975.74-100,0,17862,burton_marks,,1038.54,1046.179,"Yes, but there is this one protection that the citizen has to raise the privilege against self-incrimination."
1975.74-100,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1046.179,1049.049,And that is what you acclaimed here is about (Voice Overlap)?
1975.74-100,0,17862,burton_marks,,1049.049,1077.802,"Right, and in this case, Congress has said in effect or it seems to be the Congress said in effect and also so has the Internal Revenue Service that you must answer every question on the return and you must answer truthfully and as in Garner’s case when he did in fact assert his privilege against self-incrimination, the Internal Revenue Service sent back a letter and said your returns are incomplete."
1975.74-100,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1200.646,1208.297,"But really all that is in here is the admissibility in evidence at the trial of the tax return, is it not?"
1975.74-100,0,17862,burton_marks,,1208.297,1213.291,Actually that is all what we are really talking about and if Marchetti --
1975.74-100,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1213.291,1221.204,"If tax returns could be used for investigation is another subject in other day, is it not?"
1975.74-100,0,17862,burton_marks,,1221.204,1224.592,"Yes, but how do they get then into the courtroom?"
1975.74-100,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1225.536,1230.631,"What is involved here is the admissibility in evidence at this trial or the tax returns itself, is it not?"
1975.74-100,0,17862,burton_marks,,1230.631,1235.058,That is the -- the specific question here and the question of whether or not I could have objected it.
1975.74-100,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1235.058,1242.701,"And I do not think, why do you need to take on the question of the use of tax returns in preliminary investigation by government agency?"
1975.74-100,0,17862,burton_marks,,1242.701,1243.839,Because --
1975.74-100,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1243.839,1245.434,That is not involved in this case is it?
1975.74-100,0,17862,burton_marks,,1245.434,1267.864,"Oh! It is, because if you are -- if you are going to take the Sullivan-Bayer’s approach that there was nothing incriminating at the time he made the statement then you -- and there is nothing involved in the -- in a permeated criminal statute then Garner never had a right to raise the Fifth Amendment objection at the time of trial."
1975.74-100,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1280.014,1296.474,"Well, as I said, you correct me if am wrong, but I thought you said that I was correct in my understanding that what it is involved in this case is the admissibility in evidence that this person at your client’s trial of his previous tax returns?"
1975.74-100,0,17862,burton_marks,,1296.474,1297.602,That is right but –
1975.74-100,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1297.602,1306.714,So why is there involved here any of the questions that you have talked about involving the confidentiality of the person's tax returns?
1975.74-100,0,17862,burton_marks,,1306.714,1312.448,Because the majority said he could not raise his Fifth Amendment privilege at trial.
1975.74-100,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1315.795,1325.652,"And that is the issue, whether or not he was too late, when at trial, he objected to the admissibility of the tax return, that is the issue, is it not?"
1975.74-100,0,17862,burton_marks,,1325.652,1346.963,"And I am analogizing this to Marchetti in the sense that the statute and the way that the income tax reporting statute is being used is discriminatory, therefore, unconstitutional, therefore, the Fifth Amendment applies as well as it did in Marchetti because you are permeated with government use of -- unlawful use of the statute."
1975.74-100,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1347.992,1371.597,"Mr. Marks before you sit down, before you reach the ultimate question that Mr. Justice Stewart was posting, do you not have a threshold question that is critical in this case as to whether or not the responses in the return that can send you were compelled in a Fifth Amendment sense?"
1975.74-100,0,17862,burton_marks,,1389.43,1391.129,They were compelled.
1975.74-100,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1391.129,1394.68,But why in light of -- in light of what Sullivan said?
1975.74-100,0,17862,burton_marks,,1394.68,1402.186,"Well, Sullivan, again I have to say, Sullivan was in 1925."
1975.74-100,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1402.186,1402.901,Right.
1975.74-100,0,17862,burton_marks,,1402.901,1403.882,Alright.
1975.74-100,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1425.95,1430.124,That was the form and his question asking (Voice Overlap) you do not know?
1975.74-100,0,17862,burton_marks,,1430.124,1431.106,That is right.
1975.74-100,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1485.549,1491.059,"I understood you to say that in two earlier returns he gave some different answer, did I misunderstand you?"
1975.74-100,0,17862,burton_marks,,1491.059,1491.817,That is right.
1975.74-100,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1538.144,1545.474,Very well.
1975.74-100,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,1547.786,1551.215,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1975.74-100,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1794.844,1813.14,"Is the availability of a person’s tax returns to agencies other than the Internal Revenue Bureau, all covered specifically and authorized by statute or is it a matter of regulation or just an inter agency understanding and agreements?"
1975.74-100,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,1813.14,1820.706,"Under the internal revenue code, the President must authorize and has done so through regulations."
1975.74-100,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1832.599,1837.648,(Inaudible)
1975.74-100,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,1837.648,1848.52,I am now looking at the index and we cite those regulations apparently on pages 25 and 36 of our brief.
1975.74-100,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1848.52,1857.573,Is it true that the petitioner says that anybody in the U.S. Attorney’s office can get it?
1975.74-100,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,1857.573,1874.722,"The regulation provides that the Department of Justice and the United States Attorney’s have the right to inspect the taxpayers' return “for necessary in the performance of official duty,” so that they do have access within the limits of that regulation."
1975.74-100,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1874.722,1880.444,"And how many employees are there in the U.S. Attorney’s offices all over the country, in the thousands, is it not?"
1975.74-100,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,1880.444,1881.85,"Well, I cannot answer that Mr. Justice Marshall."
1975.74-100,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1881.85,1883.278,(Inaudible)
1975.74-100,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,1883.278,1884.478,I would guess so.
1975.74-100,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1884.478,1888.336,And any of them can get my tax return about the same as --?
1975.74-100,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,1888.336,1890.156,"Well, I would not think so Mr. Justice Marshall."
1975.74-100,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1912.002,1914.946,It says that anybody can do it?
1975.74-100,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,1914.946,1926.541,"No Mr. Justice Marshall, if -- we do not quote full text of the regulation here, but we do say that the United States Attorneys by regulation have the right to inspect the return."
1975.74-100,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1933.048,1942.174,"Well, again an Assistant U.S. Attorney subpoena anybody and issue subpoena on anybody without approval of the U.S. Attorney, certainly he does it everyday?"
1975.74-100,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,1942.174,1949.707,"That may well be, I am not sure what bearing that has on the construction of this regulation and I am not sure just what the exact terms of the regulation are."
1975.74-100,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1949.707,1951.585,(Inaudible)
1975.74-100,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,1951.585,1957.698,"That is correct, but there is broad access for purposes of investigation of criminal activities."
1975.74-100,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2104.772,2115.082,"Now Mr. Jones, how do you reconcile what you are telling us now with the experience that this taxpayer had with respect to this 1973 return?"
1975.74-100,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,2115.082,2119.148,"Well, I do not think it is very difficult to reconcile that."
1975.74-100,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2124.148,2125.723,With an explanatory letter?
1975.74-100,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,2125.723,2126.991,With an explanatory letter.
1975.74-100,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2166.612,2168.481,(inaudible) with the criminal prosecution --
1975.74-100,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,2168.481,2183.345,"Well, I do not think it is fair to say it was threatening him with prosecution, but pointing out that a failure to provide might subject him as indeed it might if his claim of privilege was invalid and in bad faith to a criminal prosecution."
1975.74-100,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2501.721,2503.17,"Your brief, 15 (Inaudible)?"
1975.74-100,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,2503.17,2505.098,Page 15 of our brief.
1975.74-100,2,17862,burton_marks,,3400.697,3402.46,Thank you Mr. Chief Justice.
1975.74-100,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3428.751,3431.292,(Inaudible)
1975.74-100,2,17862,burton_marks,,3431.292,3433.485,"Alright, I will pass it."
1975.74-100,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3434.018,3440.277,"Is it, I mean, whatever they will come out, that is not issue, but maybe some other day?"
1975.74-100,2,17862,burton_marks,,3440.277,3442.167,Right.
1975.74-100,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3496.968,3499.888,(Inaudible)
1975.74-100,2,17862,burton_marks,,3499.888,3509.266,"The compulsion was applied in the first instance by the statute, in the second instance when they were used or attempted to be introduced to trial."
1975.74-100,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3509.266,3519.321,"Assuming there was no compulsion with respect to the tax return, assume that legally, he was not compelled then, let us just assume that --"
1975.74-100,2,17862,burton_marks,,3519.321,3520.122,That he made --
1975.74-100,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3520.122,3526.565,Do you say there was still compulsion within the meaning of Fifth Amendment by the government offering them against his will to trial?
1975.74-100,2,17862,burton_marks,,3526.565,3529.666,"Yes, but under a different theory."
1975.74-100,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3545.208,3552.123,"Otherwise, you run into the Monia case or the Kordel case."
1975.74-100,2,17862,burton_marks,,3552.123,3572.036,"Well, Kordel is different because in Kordel, the civil proceedings were right at the same time, the criminal proceedings were and Kordel if he was not smart enough to know that he could assert his privilege against self-incrimination during the criminal -- civil proceeding when he was having criminal proceedings against him, then that is his tough luck."
1975.74-100,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3575.149,3579.559,(Inaudible)
1975.74-100,2,17862,burton_marks,,3579.559,3583.972,"[Laughter]I would not say it, but I think he was."
1975.74-100,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3583.972,3603.661,But Monia stands -- Monia stands the same proposition even more clearly perhaps in Kordel and a witness testifies as a third party witness and does not tie in his constitutional right against compulsory self-incrimination.
1975.74-100,2,17862,burton_marks,,3607.028,3617.073,"Well, to whatever extent you want to rely on Monia, I believe that it is wrong where the question of waiver may or may not be involved."
1975.74-100,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3626.201,3630.415,"But Monia does not -- Monia says that if you do not claim your privileges, it is wrong?"
1975.74-100,2,17862,burton_marks,,3630.415,3631.364,It is wrong.
1975.74-100,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3631.364,3635.38,But the government's position does not rest in waiver?
1975.74-100,2,17862,burton_marks,,3635.38,3637.078,That is right.
1975.74-100,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3637.078,3639.25,No compulsion at the end of first place?
1975.74-100,2,17862,burton_marks,,3639.25,3643.134,The government refused to discuss the waiver question because if you get into knowing waivers --
1975.74-100,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3643.134,3645.475,It is involved?
1975.74-100,2,17862,burton_marks,,3645.475,3647.688,It is involved because a person cannot have a privilege --
1975.74-100,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3647.688,3650.816,Probably you do not need to get to waiver if there is no compulsion?
1975.74-100,2,17862,burton_marks,,3650.816,3654.892,If a person has a privilege against self-incrimination --
1975.74-100,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3654.892,3655.93,There is no such privilege.
1975.74-100,2,17862,burton_marks,,3658.884,3666.994,"But if he does not know that he is incriminating himself and then at a later point it turns out that he was, he has a right to assert his privilege."
1975.74-100,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3669.061,3670.629,"That is in Monia, I guess."
1975.74-100,2,17862,burton_marks,,3670.629,3673.464,"No, it is not."
1975.74-100,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3674.061,3675.151,Thank you gentlemen.
1975.74-100,3,33866,keith_a_jones,,3678.385,3679.827,"Yes, I do Mr. Chief Justice."
1975.74-100,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3699.14,3701.61,Ir was all withdrawn on the rehearing?
1975.74-100,3,33866,keith_a_jones,,3701.61,3704.785,On rehearing in fact the only issue considered was --
1975.74-100,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3704.785,3706.817,The original claims were all withdrawn?
1975.74-100,3,33866,keith_a_jones,,3706.817,3709.355,That is correct.
