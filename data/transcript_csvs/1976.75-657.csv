1976.75-657,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,13.971,"We'll hear arguments first this morning in 75-657, The United Steelworkers against Usery, the Secretary of Labor."
1976.75-657,0,18959,carl_b_frankel,,19.579,23.87,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1976.75-657,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,224.418,229.01,The quote you are quoting the Secretary and when he is -- and where did he say that?
1976.75-657,0,18959,carl_b_frankel,,229.01,231.883,It's in the regulation and in the brief.
1976.75-657,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,233.707,236.228,Current regulation and it's also in the brief?
1976.75-657,0,18959,carl_b_frankel,,236.228,240.803,"Yes, at page 15 of the Secretary's brief where he paraphrases the regulation."
1976.75-657,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,240.803,244.684,"When you say regulation, do you mean it is the part of the interpretive bulletin?"
1976.75-657,0,18959,carl_b_frankel,,244.684,248.338,"While he issues an interpretive regulation, it's published in the CFR."
1976.75-657,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,257.673,266.554,Is the Secretary give an authority by Congress to issue regulations the way the SEC have enforced the law or are these just interpretation?
1976.75-657,0,18959,carl_b_frankel,,266.554,271.318,"They are interpretations, Your Honor."
1976.75-657,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,271.318,278.192,"What other sanctions, if any, are there for non-attendance of meetings?"
1976.75-657,0,18959,carl_b_frankel,,278.192,280.393,There are no sanctions.
1976.75-657,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,299.248,303.969,"Mr. Frankel, I find some indecision or difference in the brief in records."
1976.75-657,0,18959,carl_b_frankel,,308.079,309.438,"Every month, Your Honor."
1976.75-657,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,331.712,334.145,"What's, what that says?"
1976.75-657,0,18959,carl_b_frankel,,334.145,336.352,"But it was one meeting, it's considered one meeting."
1976.75-657,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,336.352,341.926,"Well, but was the same thing be duplicated on Thursday morning as went on Wednesday --"
1976.75-657,0,18959,carl_b_frankel,,341.926,350.956,"Yes, the same business would occur, would arise and what they frequently do is cumulate the votes on any issue on which a vote has to be taken."
1976.75-657,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,350.956,357.895,"Well, I take the people that came Thursday morning wouldn't get the benefit of the discussion in that area that took place Wednesday afternoon."
1976.75-657,0,18959,carl_b_frankel,,357.895,360.944,"Oh they might not, that is correct."
1976.75-657,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,368.561,373.715,"You had some excuses here, didn't you, it --"
1976.75-657,0,18959,carl_b_frankel,,373.715,377.947,Work and meeting and the Union actively.
1976.75-657,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,377.947,384.444,How many people would have qualified by virtue of the excuses?
1976.75-657,0,18959,carl_b_frankel,,384.444,386.271,"There is no way of knowing, Your Honor."
1976.75-657,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,427.463,432.834,Well can you do that nine months ago?
1976.75-657,0,18959,carl_b_frankel,,436.609,437.443,Every three years.
1976.75-657,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,437.443,445.33,"Every three years, so that you have to go back 36 months to shore up your excuses?"
1976.75-657,0,18959,carl_b_frankel,,445.33,450.343,"To determine whether or not the member worked at the time there was a meeting, yes."
1976.75-657,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,450.343,455.303,"Well I gather the, as the meeting roll shows by name who attended?"
1976.75-657,0,18959,carl_b_frankel,,455.303,455.996,That is correct.
1976.75-657,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,455.996,460.663,And so if he is a nominee and you find his name on the meeting roll only 18 times out --
1976.75-657,0,18959,carl_b_frankel,,460.663,462.046,There is no reason to check.
1976.75-657,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,462.046,462.65,That is right.
1976.75-657,0,18959,carl_b_frankel,,464.916,465.795,Then there is a reason to check.
1976.75-657,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,465.795,470.311,"Then you have to find out the days that he was absent why, is that it?"
1976.75-657,0,18959,carl_b_frankel,,470.311,474.114,Well when we have to find out whether he worked on the day on which there was --
1976.75-657,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,474.114,475.576,Well it's something else I gather.
1976.75-657,0,18959,carl_b_frankel,,477.825,478.409,"Oh, Union that's correct."
1976.75-657,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,478.409,482.24,He might for example he might have been member of grievance committee.
1976.75-657,0,18959,carl_b_frankel,,486.544,487.219,That 's correct.
1976.75-657,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,487.219,490.921,And that would be an adequate excuse?
1976.75-657,0,18959,carl_b_frankel,,490.921,492.009,Yes sir.
1976.75-657,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,492.009,494.934,"That is a kind of inquiry you have to make, if he falls short?"
1976.75-657,0,18959,carl_b_frankel,,494.934,496.484,That is correct.
1976.75-657,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,496.484,500.102,"Who has to bear that proof, the member?"
1976.75-657,0,18959,carl_b_frankel,,500.102,502.698,"No, Your Honor, the tellers would do that."
1976.75-657,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,524.376,530.931,"But I do not quite understand, if he were -- if his excuse was that he was working, I thought you said there was a split meeting."
1976.75-657,0,18959,carl_b_frankel,,533.55,554.614,"Well, Your Honor, their over time and indeed in this particular case there was one member who qualified by virtue of a combination and he had an additional, according to the Secretary's investigation, he had additional nine credits over 16 meetings which he had attended."
1976.75-657,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,622.86,624.738,Who appoints the tellers?
1976.75-657,0,18959,carl_b_frankel,,624.738,633.746,The tellers are either elected or they are appointed subject to ratification by the membership.
1976.75-657,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,633.746,635.129,At a regular meeting?
1976.75-657,0,18959,carl_b_frankel,,635.129,636.076,At a regular meeting.
1976.75-657,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,636.076,642.198,Is it a stated meeting in which the purpose of the meeting is announced in advance?
1976.75-657,0,18959,carl_b_frankel,,642.198,648.368,"Usually, it's not the nomination meeting, but I don't recall a constitutional provision that says, when it had to be done."
1976.75-657,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,653.157,657.258,And how long in advance of the elections is the nomination meeting?
1976.75-657,0,18959,carl_b_frankel,,657.258,662.449,"Usually a month or it could be less, though it varies in 5200 locals you have, --"
1976.75-657,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,662.449,663.82,Each has it's own autonomy in that respect?
1976.75-657,0,18959,carl_b_frankel,,663.82,665.346,Yes.
1976.75-657,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,665.346,670.177,Because between the data of nomination of the election it's a very short period.
1976.75-657,0,18959,carl_b_frankel,,674.744,681.825,"Well, Your Honor because usually there are only a few people as to whom there is a question and it doesn't impose that much of a burden."
1976.75-657,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,729.82,740.52,By what process could the eligibility be made more stringent that is moving from half of the meetings to three quarters of the meetings?
1976.75-657,0,18959,carl_b_frankel,,740.52,750.543,"Some unions have done that and we would not, it is our position that such a rule would be valid because it imposes two heavy a burden on the member."
1976.75-657,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,750.543,753.508,What about 60%?
1976.75-657,0,18959,carl_b_frankel,,753.508,757.177,"I don't think 60 -- I don't think we should require more than half, Your Honor."
1976.75-657,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,757.177,761.05,"Well, whatâ€™s the basis, how do you arrive at these --"
1976.75-657,0,18959,carl_b_frankel,,761.05,785.467,"Well, it's difficult to do, I agree, but I think from the standpoint of our rule that to ask a member to spend an hour or 45 minutes, or an hour-and-a-half or two hours every other month is not too difficult a burden and that adds up to roughly 32 hours in a three-year period."
1976.75-657,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,785.467,789.036,How many people in this Local had qualified?
1976.75-657,0,18959,carl_b_frankel,,789.036,792.43,"By virtue of meeting attendants alone, 22."
1976.75-657,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,792.43,793.545,Out of how many?
1976.75-657,0,18959,carl_b_frankel,,793.545,795.716,About 660.
1976.75-657,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,795.716,805.755,So apparently an enormous proportion of the membership do find it either difficult or for some other reason do not attend the meeting?
1976.75-657,0,18959,carl_b_frankel,,805.755,811.04,"I think, it's for some other reason other than for being difficult, Your Honor, I don't think --"
1976.75-657,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,811.04,812.658,Because the meetings are so dull?
1976.75-657,0,18959,carl_b_frankel,,812.658,816.37,Or because they don't have the interest in attending.
1976.75-657,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,829.22,833.334,"Okay, this Union isn't doing nearly as well as the voters of this country, is it?"
1976.75-657,0,18959,carl_b_frankel,,833.334,833.859,No.
1976.75-657,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,846.038,855.786,"If the eligibility were increased that is to 60 or two-thirds or three-fourths, what is the process by which a Local Union would make that change?"
1976.75-657,0,18959,carl_b_frankel,,855.786,859.278,"A Local Union could not make that change in the Steelworkers, Your Honor."
1976.75-657,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,859.278,860.362,Then how would it be made --
1976.75-657,0,18959,carl_b_frankel,,860.362,873.685,"It will have to be made at convention, at the Steelworkers' convention which imposes these requirements nationwide for all Steelworker Locals and from which Steelworker Locals are not, cannot deviate."
1976.75-657,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,877.246,882.855,"At these national conventions, you have the leadership of the Union's --"
1976.75-657,0,18959,carl_b_frankel,,882.855,884.382,"In some instances, yes Your Honor."
1976.75-657,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,889.643,895.258,"The non-attenders, the people with poor attendance records aren't likely to show up at the National convention, are they?"
1976.75-657,0,18959,carl_b_frankel,,895.258,904.706,"I would say having attended five or four of them that the dissidents do attend meetings, do get elected to become delegate --"
1976.75-657,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,904.706,909.803,"Well, may they be elected delegates, if they don't attend, if they don't meet this attendance requirement?"
1976.75-657,0,18959,carl_b_frankel,,909.803,911.646,"Yes, not this attendance requirement."
1976.75-657,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,912.977,913.915,And what is the other one?
1976.75-657,0,18959,carl_b_frankel,,913.915,918.435,"As I recall, it's half of the year."
1976.75-657,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,921.486,933.827,"The matter of all that is essentially, the establishment is in control of a National Convention, using the word establishment in quotation marks, of course."
1976.75-657,0,18959,carl_b_frankel,,933.827,937.435,"Your honor, my experience is that, that is not true."
1976.75-657,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,938.277,947.497,"Well, how could these 660 who didn't attend or the non-attenders of the 660, get to a national convention?"
1976.75-657,0,18959,carl_b_frankel,,947.497,949.623,Well the non-attenders --
1976.75-657,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,949.623,952.182,They aren't eligible?
1976.75-657,0,18959,carl_b_frankel,,952.182,953.265,-- would not be eligible.
1976.75-657,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,962.977,965.273,"Well, in this Local, there would be, how many 26 --"
1976.75-657,0,18959,carl_b_frankel,,965.273,968.341,There is no way to know because nobody did a check for a year.
1976.75-657,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,968.341,974.335,"Well, so as of the time you gave me the figure of 22 numbers out of 660?"
1976.75-657,0,18959,carl_b_frankel,,974.335,982.613,That was on a three-year basis and it didn't include employees or members who were eligible by virtue of combination.
1976.75-657,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1003.392,1005.189,Incidentally are there many?
1976.75-657,0,18959,carl_b_frankel,,1009.629,1020.11,"There are 12 international unions representing approximately 25% of the membership, of trade-union membership which have meeting attendance rules."
1976.75-657,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1022.316,1025.523,But that's suggested 75%.
1976.75-657,0,18959,carl_b_frankel,,1025.523,1026.392,It does not.
1976.75-657,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1026.392,1028.684,"-- of organized labor, do not?"
1976.75-657,0,18959,carl_b_frankel,,1028.684,1032.625,"No it doesn't suggest that for this reason, Your Honor."
1976.75-657,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1052.757,1057.956,"Any, have a rule, the kind of part of the steelworkers?"
1976.75-657,0,18959,carl_b_frankel,,1057.956,1058.902,A three-year rule?
1976.75-657,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1061.763,1066.191,So that means the Steelworkers in the other union are farthest out?
1976.75-657,0,18959,carl_b_frankel,,1066.191,1067.677,"Well, no Your Honor."
1976.75-657,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1086.552,1088.19,"Well, let me emphasis the other fact."
1976.75-657,0,18959,carl_b_frankel,,1092.765,1094.836,"Well, there was a union that had a 70% --"
1976.75-657,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1094.836,1097.702,-- because somebody has to be up in front.
1976.75-657,0,18959,carl_b_frankel,,1097.702,1099.265,We are using the armed bargaining.
1976.75-657,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1100.58,1105.993,"Why don't you admit that, there is not anything nefarious about it, I just wanted to get into focus?"
1976.75-657,0,18959,carl_b_frankel,,1105.993,1120.369,"There is a union that had a 75% rule; the Glass Bottle Blowers had a 75% requirement and there is another way of looking at stringency, Your Honor some unions require 50% attendance in each year."
1976.75-657,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1128.003,1144.244,"I suppose from the point of view of the union, if you averaged 80 or 90% attendance at the meeting, you have could count on the members when they cast their ballots at election to realize that the one of the candidates had never come to meetings and wasn't that very good bet."
1976.75-657,0,18959,carl_b_frankel,,1158.874,1162.312,"Well, that maybe Your Honor."
1976.75-657,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1162.312,1167.779,"In fact, doesn't -- one of the purposes of the rule as I remember was to encourage meeting attendance, is that right?"
1976.75-657,0,18959,carl_b_frankel,,1167.779,1173.744,"It not only to encourage meeting attendance, Your Honor, but to encourage those who oppose the leadership of the Union."
1976.75-657,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1173.744,1181.293,"Well I understand, but just to confining it to encouraging meeting attendance, it really has not succeeded in that purpose at all, has it?"
1976.75-657,0,18959,carl_b_frankel,,1181.293,1187.551,"Well, it's hard to tell what point there is success and at what point there isn't."
1976.75-657,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1195.523,1197.962,And you mean that most of the Locals has less 10% --
1976.75-657,0,18959,carl_b_frankel,,1197.962,1199.138,No I have no way of knowing.
1976.75-657,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1233.326,1240.99,"But they must decide under the rule at least 18 months in advance of the election, if they want to oppose the leadership, must they not?"
1976.75-657,0,18959,carl_b_frankel,,1240.99,1244.977,No they must decide whether they wish to run for office â€“
1976.75-657,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1244.977,1245.842,At least 18 months in advance.
1976.75-657,0,18959,carl_b_frankel,,1245.842,1247.504,18 months in advance.
1976.75-657,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1247.504,1250.878,Do you think just that 18 months time period is kind of unreasonable?
1976.75-657,0,18959,carl_b_frankel,,1250.878,1252.967,"Your Honor, I have this problem."
1976.75-657,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1267.68,1268.881,Why he would have to make it too late?
1976.75-657,0,18959,carl_b_frankel,,1268.881,1275.402,"Well, because if the time would have gone by for him to qualify."
1976.75-657,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1305.976,1316.23,"Well, just the only thought that runs through my mind is the fact that you can hypothesize a whole host of invalid rules; it doesn't seem to me very persuasive as to whether this is a real --"
1976.75-657,0,18959,carl_b_frankel,,1316.23,1326.808,"The problem I am getting to is that the Secretary is also rescinded a -- to his original part, the regulation which permitted a two-year rule."
1976.75-657,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1327.413,1333.366,So we are not deciding what was reason or unreasonable about the Secretary has done in another situations.
1976.75-657,0,18959,carl_b_frankel,,1338.07,1364.597,"That's correct, Your Honor, but in order to determine what is reasonable, in order to determine what is reasonable given the fact that the Secretary says, that a meeting attendance rule is itself reasonable then there has to be some measuring period and what we are saying is the Secretary hasn't given us any way to knowing what that measuring, what kind of appropriate measuring period they are giving."
1976.75-657,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1364.597,1365.579,Let me put it this way.
1976.75-657,0,18959,carl_b_frankel,,1380.707,1393.151,"The reason I would give Your Honor, is that if we didn't do that then we will remove the incentive for opponents of the leadership to attend early in the term, in the first 18 months, that is the reason."
1976.75-657,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1393.151,1399.003,But what if he doesn't know until within the 18 month the period that he disagrees with the leadership.
1976.75-657,0,18959,carl_b_frankel,,1409.098,1409.736,That is correct.
1976.75-657,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1409.736,1413.341,"No, that's not true if you have attended every meeting?"
1976.75-657,1,32657,john_p_rupp,,1794.422,1797.951,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1976.75-657,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1828.633,1837.994,"And even that assumes, does it not, that they have got to attend all the meetings after that, but attended not in the court --"
1976.75-657,1,32657,john_p_rupp,,1837.994,1859.432,"Well, I say as early as and I'll return to that at a moment, but so long as the person desiring to run for office has not attended a significant number of meetings in the early part of the term, the burden that can result from operation of the rule is a requirement to attend all 18 meetings, proceeding the election."
1976.75-657,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1859.432,1867.849,Isn't there a possibility that the one steelworker who is interested enough in the union to go to the meetings without tunning for office?
1976.75-657,1,32657,john_p_rupp,,1867.849,1869.503,"Yes, Mr. Justice Marshall."
1976.75-657,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1869.503,1876.129,"Well, wasn't that duty of -- you don't know how many workers they are like that, didn't they?"
1976.75-657,1,32657,john_p_rupp,,1876.129,1878.886,"We don't know -- well, we do have some indication from this --"
1976.75-657,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1878.886,1881.496,"They are enjoying it, they just like to go to meeting?"
1976.75-657,1,32657,john_p_rupp,,1881.496,1885.227,There are some people of course who are interested in attending Union meetings to see some --
1976.75-657,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1885.227,1889.421,"Well, that's not included in your figure?"
1976.75-657,1,32657,john_p_rupp,,1889.421,1890.137,"Yes, it is."
1976.75-657,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1890.137,1893.755,Well how many are they?
1976.75-657,1,32657,john_p_rupp,,1893.755,1903.613,The register -- the meeting attendance register in this case reflects the number of members who attended each and every meeting during the three-year period preceding the 1970 election.
1976.75-657,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1950.457,1954.556,How many went to one less than number of meeting?
1976.75-657,1,32657,john_p_rupp,,1954.556,1959.106,We know that three members went to more than 15 meetings but fewer of them 18 minutes.
1976.75-657,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1959.106,1961.104,How many attend the 12 meetings?
1976.75-657,1,32657,john_p_rupp,,1961.104,1962.099,The record doesn't reflected.
1976.75-657,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1962.099,1963.778,That's right.
1976.75-657,1,32657,john_p_rupp,,1965.184,1968.134,"Yes, the record doesn't reflect it."
1976.75-657,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2011.819,2020.644,Didn't you Mr. Rupp have burden of proof and wasn't I mistaken a while ago when I said that Mr. Justice Stevens had perhaps not stated the issue correctly.
1976.75-657,1,32657,john_p_rupp,,2026.808,2029.064,"I believe that the Secretary did have the burden of proof, that is right."
1976.75-657,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2029.064,2033.575,And that is whether not you proved that these were not reasonable?
1976.75-657,1,32657,john_p_rupp,,2033.575,2034.411,That is correct.
1976.75-657,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2040.876,2046.727,"Why, why you are just apply for a law suit under the Act, don't you? You have a burden proving it."
1976.75-657,1,32657,john_p_rupp,,2050.328,2052.574,"No, no, we are not, the Secretary has not --"
1976.75-657,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2052.574,2057.849,Is he a plaintiff in the ordinary sense or is he a plaintiff in a representative sense?
1976.75-657,1,32657,john_p_rupp,,2057.849,2059.864,That is a point that I want to make.
1976.75-657,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2067.619,2074.567,"Anymore than the justice department is when it brings an anti-trust suit, is that correct?"
1976.75-657,1,32657,john_p_rupp,,2074.567,2076.717,I think that he has entitled to somewhat greater weight.
1976.75-657,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2076.717,2077.451,Why?
1976.75-657,1,32657,john_p_rupp,,2077.451,2089.851,"Because the legislative history of this Act as this Court found in the Hotel Employees case and again Glass Bottle Blowers case, the decision to entrust the administration of this statute to the Secretary of Labor --"
1976.75-657,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2089.851,2094.795,"The administration of anti-trust laws that justice department do, aren't they?"
1976.75-657,1,32657,john_p_rupp,,2094.795,2096.978,"Yes they are, but not in quite the same sense."
1976.75-657,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2105.585,2109.406,So is the Assistant Attorney General under the Anti-trust Division?
1976.75-657,1,32657,john_p_rupp,,2109.406,2114.003,"Well that is correct, and I don't want to make a big point of this."
1976.75-657,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2120.518,2125.136,And you do then concede that you have the burden of proving that in a Federal Court?
1976.75-657,1,32657,john_p_rupp,,2125.136,2128.384,And I do concede that the Secretary has the burden.
1976.75-657,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2128.384,2144.22,"Isn't the purpose of committing the oarsmen function to the Secretary and denying the individual member to right to sue, wasn't that designed to screen out frivolous claims and protect the Unions from having to defend too many claims in this case, but perhaps supposing even harder and more --"
1976.75-657,1,32657,john_p_rupp,,2144.22,2146.699,Well that may have been one of the motives.
1976.75-657,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2170.518,2174.311,And that is the individual can sue himself?
1976.75-657,1,32657,john_p_rupp,,2174.311,2175.112,He can't.
1976.75-657,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2175.112,2180.89,He can't and the Secretary is required to investigate and make a decision to whether to sue or not?
1976.75-657,1,32657,john_p_rupp,,2180.89,2181.457,That is correct.
1976.75-657,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2181.457,2184.703,And his decision not to sue is reviewable?
1976.75-657,1,32657,john_p_rupp,,2184.703,2185.533,I believe that it is.
1976.75-657,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2185.533,2198.758,"And has a difference -- different, different antitrust different situation where the anti-trust -- there may be complaints filed at Antitrust Division but nobody is about to review the Assistant Attorney General's decision not to file the case?"
1976.75-657,1,32657,john_p_rupp,,2198.758,2200.123,"That is correct, it's also different than (Voice Overlap)"
1976.75-657,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2200.123,2203.076,But an individual can sue under anti-trust laws?
1976.75-657,1,32657,john_p_rupp,,2203.076,2204.333,An individual can sue.
1976.75-657,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2204.333,2205.39,Yes.
1976.75-657,1,32657,john_p_rupp,,2205.39,2207.763,"Yes, yes."
1976.75-657,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2207.763,2213.3,That's what I thought.
1976.75-657,1,32657,john_p_rupp,,2213.3,2223.151,"We submit -- our basic submission here is that the Secretary has shown by overwhelming evidence, the unreasonableness of this rule."
1976.75-657,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2223.151,2226.137,"What rule, what degree?"
1976.75-657,1,32657,john_p_rupp,,2226.137,2251.601,"Well, let me say that the Secretary's regulations, which where promulgated by the Secretary in an effort to provide some guidance to Unions affected by the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act, list a number of factors that are to be taken into account in determining the reasonableness of a rule."
1976.75-657,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2298.929,2304.167,"This is what the Secretary considered why, as it predicate to whether or not he is going to file the suit?"
1976.75-657,1,32657,john_p_rupp,,2304.167,2306.001,That's correct.
1976.75-657,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2306.001,2311.073,That's the only reason why he considers these things?
1976.75-657,1,32657,john_p_rupp,,2311.073,2316.713,What he is attempting to do is provide guidance to Unions that are reflected by the statute?
1976.75-657,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2316.713,2327.392,"Yes, but when a particular case comes up, he goes through this process that you have described for us, only to determine whether or not he is going to file a law suit, does he?"
1976.75-657,1,32657,john_p_rupp,,2327.392,2349.152,"Well he goes through it in the first instance to decide whether to contact the International Union or the Local involved to attempt to convince them and change the rule, there is that kind of an administrative process if I can call it that, that precedes the filing of the complaint and effort is made in every case to try to resolve differences between the Secretary and the Union short of litigation."
1976.75-657,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2370.783,2375.779,Well that's true I suppose lots of litigation is settled before it's gets to court.
1976.75-657,1,32657,john_p_rupp,,2389.805,2390.963,That is one of the purposes.
1976.75-657,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2390.963,2392.184,"Well, wasn't that the purpose?"
1976.75-657,1,32657,john_p_rupp,,2392.184,2412.233,"It was not, well perhaps, simply stated perhaps that is the purpose, the overriding purpose, but Congress also had other kinds of things in mind that are related to avoiding the perpetuation in office of incumbent leadership, by incumbent leadership."
1976.75-657,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2418.8,2427.447,"In order to accomplish that basic legislative purpose, in order to avoid the risk of unfairly or inequitably continuing incumbent leadership."
1976.75-657,1,32657,john_p_rupp,,2429.456,2431.415,"Yes, that is the overriding purpose."
1976.75-657,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2431.415,2457.13,"And shouldn't that therefore be the focus of the Secretary's inquiry as to any rule and determine whether or not it is reasonable to find out whether it would tend to perpetuate, unfairly perpetuate incumbent union leadership and he could determine that by normal rational predictive, intellectual processes or to which would be contributed to the past history, wouldn't that be true?"
1976.75-657,1,32657,john_p_rupp,,2470.692,2490.045,"Well, it is the Secretary's position that if one or two percent of the membership are eligible to run for office because of a candidacy restriction, that is prime facie evidence of a violation of the Act."
1976.75-657,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2495.834,2498.473,"By looking at the record, that is how you prove it."
1976.75-657,1,32657,john_p_rupp,,2500.742,2507.768,One would never know precisely whether those people were maintained in office because they happen to be enlighten leadership and they were able to carry the.
1976.75-657,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2507.768,2517.148,"But if they were not maintained in office, then you would know that, in any event incumbent leadership had not been maintained in the office?"
1976.75-657,1,32657,john_p_rupp,,2517.148,2520.94,"Well, but Congress's purpose here was not to turned out union office for --"
1976.75-657,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2520.94,2526.78,"But if in fact the record show they had not been, you would not need to take step two, would you?"
1976.75-657,1,32657,john_p_rupp,,2526.78,2528.989,If the record show that they had not been turned out?
1976.75-657,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2528.989,2533.468,"Had not been retained, then that would be the end of it?"
1976.75-657,1,32657,john_p_rupp,,2533.468,2538.858,"No, I do not believe that is the case."
1976.75-657,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2549.665,2551.049,You may just passing the office back?
1976.75-657,1,32657,john_p_rupp,,2551.049,2553.558,"Passing the office back and forth, we have seen that."
1976.75-657,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2566.046,2570.85,My basic question was simply this.
1976.75-657,1,32657,john_p_rupp,,2600.976,2616.843,"Well, the focus of the Secretary's inquiry is on whether Union members have had an opportunity for free and democratic election which is perhaps another way of stating your point."
1976.75-657,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2677.892,2697.418,"Mr. Rupp, if I can get you back to my original question, how could a union lawyer looking at what you just read me about ten minutes ago, and draw a up a rule that would be acceptable?"
1976.75-657,1,32657,john_p_rupp,,2697.418,2698.256,It is difficult.
1976.75-657,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2699.509,2701.894,Is it -- would not it made impossible?
1976.75-657,1,32657,john_p_rupp,,2701.894,2702.787,"No, I will not."
1976.75-657,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2703.154,2705.802,I said one that is sure to pass muster?
1976.75-657,1,32657,john_p_rupp,,2705.802,2706.259,No.
1976.75-657,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2706.259,2711.778,"Sure I said, that is impossible?"
1976.75-657,1,32657,john_p_rupp,,2711.778,2713.857,"Well, if sure means a 100 assurance, I suppose that is impossible."
1976.75-657,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2713.857,2731.682,"I mean you studied, you worked with it, I am not too sure you could draw (Inaudible) under those rules because they do not say one month, two months, six years, eight years, one percent, eleven percent; it has nothing that you put your finger on?"
1976.75-657,1,32657,john_p_rupp,,2731.682,2733.329,"Well, we have to recall."
1976.75-657,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2733.329,2769.132,"One way to get at this be to look at the actual attendance records which in this case, on this record shows that only 22 out of 660 people were eligible for a number of union offices and the Secretary might have appropriately to answer this inquiry, look to what figures would enable one-fourths, let us say of the 660 to be eligible and then fix the attendance requirements to fit that larger number."
1976.75-657,1,32657,john_p_rupp,,2769.132,2775.747,"Well, of course it would be ideal if that kind of predictability were possible and perhaps in some Unions it is."
1976.75-657,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2775.747,2780.546,"And when you do that, would you also realize that this is an International Union with how many Locals?"
1976.75-657,1,32657,john_p_rupp,,2780.546,2782.309,"With 5,200 Locals."
1976.75-657,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2782.309,2792.821,"And you are going to get a rule that this Local, the 5,000 Locals all lose because of this one Local?"
1976.75-657,1,32657,john_p_rupp,,2792.821,2794.648,"No, that is not the case."
1976.75-657,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2817.972,2818.932,I am not talking about that.
1976.75-657,1,32657,john_p_rupp,,2831.84,2833.408,Our position is precisely that.
1976.75-657,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2833.408,2835.499,"That means all 5,000 Locals?"
1976.75-657,1,32657,john_p_rupp,,2835.499,2844.715,But the reason is not only because it happens to eliminate to disqualify from seeking Union office.
1976.75-657,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2878.497,2885.7,What is reasonable in the Steelworkers?
1976.75-657,1,32657,john_p_rupp,,2885.7,2897.48,"Well, it is exceedingly difficult to me to stand here and say that the Secretary is going to say that a two-year, 50% rule is okay, that a one-year, 50% rule is okay, we do not have that experience in the Steelworkers Union."
1976.75-657,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2897.48,2899.392,What is reasonable?
1976.75-657,1,32657,john_p_rupp,,2899.392,2900.743,A reasonable rule.
1976.75-657,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2900.743,2903.87,"Isn't that, what we to decide whether it is reasonable or not?"
1976.75-657,1,32657,john_p_rupp,,2903.87,2904.667,"Yes, that is correct."
1976.75-657,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2904.667,2910.966,Isn't it a part of that could be very well as to what is reasonable?
1976.75-657,1,32657,john_p_rupp,,2910.966,2911.761,"Yes, of course."
1976.75-657,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2911.761,2918.355,"Well, what is reasonable?"
1976.75-657,1,32657,john_p_rupp,,2918.355,2921.381,I simply cannot give you a precise rule.
1976.75-657,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2929.613,2939.599,Is it anymore a requirement now to fix that thing is than it was for the Judge who was trying this case originally?
1976.75-657,1,32657,john_p_rupp,,2945.714,2946.042,That is correct.
1976.75-657,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2946.042,2948.762,Not the affirmative of what is reasonable?
1976.75-657,1,32657,john_p_rupp,,2953.829,2963.614,"The Steelworkers will then look at the situation that prevails and they are now 5,200 Locals, they were 3700 Locals at the time this litigation began."
1976.75-657,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2983.786,2987.186,"Well, that just leaves them at sea, it seems to me."
1976.75-657,1,32657,john_p_rupp,,3006.9,3012.822,"Well, it certainly is not a fact question or factual disputes involved in this record, I think they are minor."
1976.75-657,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3140.896,3151.898,"Mr. Rupp does the record tell us what would happen in this case, if there were less people who were eligible to run than there were vacant officers, that could happen --"
1976.75-657,1,32657,john_p_rupp,,3151.898,3158.804,"Yes, yes, we do know what happens in that circumstance because it occurred here."
1976.75-657,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3200.945,3206.466,Does the record tell us whether that is a purely a local practice or whether that is consistent with international constitution?
1976.75-657,1,32657,john_p_rupp,,3206.466,3208.736,I do not think the record tells us.
1976.75-657,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3339.473,3341.932,How many of the 23 are incumbents?
1976.75-657,1,32657,john_p_rupp,,3341.932,3344.443,Are incumbents?
1976.75-657,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3346.685,3347.533,Almost a half.
1976.75-657,1,32657,john_p_rupp,,3347.533,3348.094,That is right.
1976.75-657,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3401.462,3403.731,Is that decision cited?
1976.75-657,1,32657,john_p_rupp,,3403.731,3407.419,"We do not have a cite yet, but I have given copies to court clerk."
1976.75-657,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3411.05,3411.999,Usery?
1976.75-657,2,18959,carl_b_frankel,,3670.408,3674.037,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1976.75-657,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3715.062,3720.534,Of course I understood you said it was burden on those who wanted to be candidates?
1976.75-657,2,18959,carl_b_frankel,,3725.965,3728.816,"Well, we get back to the other point, Your Honor."
1976.75-657,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3746.364,3753.126,And you do not think that is affected by these enormous number of who do not comply with that?
1976.75-657,2,18959,carl_b_frankel,,3753.126,3754.672,"They chose not to, Your Honor."
1976.75-657,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3802.807,3803.783,Your time has expired.
