2019.18-6135,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.24,"We'll hear argument first this term in Case Number 18-6135, Kahler versus Kansas. Ms. Schrup."
2019.18-6135,0,63166,sarah_schrup,,7.24,19.28,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: For centuries, criminal culpability has hinged on the capacity for moral judgment, to discern and to choose between right and wrong."
2019.18-6135,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,135.16,139.2,"Well, before you do that, you're relying on due process."
2019.18-6135,0,63166,sarah_schrup,,193.72,195.08,"Yes, it would, Justice Ginsburg."
2019.18-6135,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,212.8,229.48,"But I -- I would have thought you would want collateral consequences imposed, as I understood your submission, because the idea is that someone acquitted by reason of insanity would not go free but would instead be committed to mental care."
2019.18-6135,0,63166,sarah_schrup,,229.48,230.8,"Yes, that's right, Your Honor."
2019.18-6135,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,231.08,241.52,"Well, why wouldn't that -- if that's the consequence of the system Justice Ginsburg was talking about, guilty but insane, I don't understand why that's not exactly the sort of course you're looking for."
2019.18-6135,0,63166,sarah_schrup,,241.52,249.24,"Well, I want to rewind a little bit, Your Honor, because really what we're talking about is the mechanism to be able to show that you lack moral capacity."
2019.18-6135,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,279.68,280.0,My --
2019.18-6135,0,63166,sarah_schrup,,280.0,280.36,-- well --
2019.18-6135,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,280.36,288.08,My hypothetical is the question of where the person is incarcerated is determined second.
2019.18-6135,0,63166,sarah_schrup,,317.84,322.24,"Well, Your Honor, I -- you know, to the extent -- so I guess I would go back to history on this."
2019.18-6135,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,362.56,364.76,You're talking about lack of moral capacity.
2019.18-6135,0,63166,sarah_schrup,,380.84,390.64,"So the right-and-wrong principle, Your Honor, includes both knowledge of legal wrong and knowledge of moral wrong. There's very little light between the two. So --"
2019.18-6135,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,390.64,391.84,"Well, I don't know that that's the case."
2019.18-6135,0,63166,sarah_schrup,,400.92,403.16,"Justice Alito, it's not about a belief."
2019.18-6135,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,413.68,414.88,If the --
2019.18-6135,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,414.88,415.76,What's the answer --
2019.18-6135,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,415.76,430.48,"-- person -- I -- if the person has the capacity to know that what he did was a violation of the criminal law, and that's the defense that is provided by a state, is that unconstitutional?"
2019.18-6135,0,63166,sarah_schrup,,430.48,430.8,No.
2019.18-6135,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,456.48,483.48,"Well, there are many, many people who believe, maybe not so much for murder, but certainly for a lot of other offenses, that things that are violations of the law are nevertheless moral. And so if that were the general rule in criminal law, that you cannot be convicted if you -- if you know that -- if you believe that what you've done is moral, that would revolutionize criminal law."
2019.18-6135,0,63166,sarah_schrup,,504.56,508.28,"Your Honor, it's not about the diagnosis."
2019.18-6135,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,531.64,547.44,"Well, what is the answer to my question? Is it sufficient if the person has something that is considered to be a mental disorder in the DSM? And it has been calculated that one in five people in the United States has some mental disorder."
2019.18-6135,0,63166,sarah_schrup,,559.68,566.44,"Justice Alito, they should be given the opportunity to at least try. This shouldn't be legislatively cut off at the knees."
2019.18-6135,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,579.16,579.44,Ms. --
2019.18-6135,0,63166,sarah_schrup,,579.44,579.6,-- and --
2019.18-6135,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,579.6,580.08,Ms. Schrup --
2019.18-6135,0,63166,sarah_schrup,,580.08,580.36,Yes?
2019.18-6135,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,580.36,603.32,"Can I ask you about a premise of your argument? And it's that if we look to history, and if history supports what you say, then we're obligated to go with it now. And I -- I just want to ask how and why that's so, because there are many ways in which understandings of criminal culpability change over the years."
2019.18-6135,0,63166,sarah_schrup,,636.0,639.76,"Well, Your Honor, because that's the test that this Court has set out for due process."
2019.18-6135,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,646.2,665.68,"Well, the -- I mean, the test that was set out by this Court for due process, I mean, I could give you some ways in which the criminal law of olden times seems remarkably archaic to us now, marital rape exception, maybe sodomy laws."
2019.18-6135,0,63166,sarah_schrup,,692.6,710.44,"Well, we are -- we actually have sort of a perfect complements, Justice Kagan, because we have not only the history that goes back maybe a thousand years, and certainly since the mid 1500s, but we also have the modern practice, a fundamental -- a rule of fundamental fairness currently in operation in 48 of 53 U.S. jurisdictions. So it's not just the history."
2019.18-6135,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,714.84,755.32,"With respect to history, can we take into account the reality, in the old days at common law, the result of the insanity defense would be you were sent to bedlam, where the conditions were often far worse than in prison? So someone might decide, no, I'm not going to plead insanity, because then I'll end up with an incarceration worse than prison. Do we take that into account in deciding the function of the insanity defense?"
2019.18-6135,0,63166,sarah_schrup,,755.32,757.08,I don't think you need to take it into account.
2019.18-6135,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,787.96,797.08,The things that I -- I think is underlying a lot of the debate is the expansive notion of what counts as evidence.
2019.18-6135,0,63166,sarah_schrup,,840.84,852.6,"Your Honor, Mr. -- Mr. Chief Justice, let me just tell you why those facts are in there and why they're not -- why they're there and that will shed light on it. What we know is that Mr. Kahler had a major depressive disorder."
2019.18-6135,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,864.28,864.8,But that he --
2019.18-6135,0,63166,sarah_schrup,,864.8,865.72,But it doesn't --
2019.18-6135,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,865.72,870.48,-- borrows tools instead of purchasing them? That sounds like the reasonable option. (Laughter.)
2019.18-6135,0,63166,sarah_schrup,,870.48,877.08,"Well, you can't -- Mr. Chief Justice, you can't take that one fact out of context."
2019.18-6135,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,890.88,910.32,"What -- what would be put before the jury, that is, what now, what evidence in this record would you point to to show that Kahler was unable to tell right from wrong? What evidence is there that he was unable to make that distinction?"
2019.18-6135,0,63166,sarah_schrup,,910.32,921.4,"On the current record -- which, of course, was not developed with a right and wrong principle -- I would point you to the Joint Appendix at 87 where his expert said that he -- he couldn't rule out short-term disassociation."
2019.18-6135,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,936.0,936.48,"Well, he had the --"
2019.18-6135,0,63166,sarah_schrup,,936.48,937.56,-- the same for every defendant.
2019.18-6135,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,937.56,941.84,He had the opportunity and every incentive to do that at the penalty phase.
2019.18-6135,0,63166,sarah_schrup,,999.04,1001.56,"Justice Alito, I'll answer the first part."
2019.18-6135,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1027.4,1031.64,"But is that realistic? I'm on a jury and I say: Well, now I -- I've convicted this guy."
2019.18-6135,0,63166,sarah_schrup,,1041.08,1047.16,It is realistic because we know from the briefs that they -- that jurors are swayed by what they decide at the guilt phase.
2019.18-6135,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1068.0,1071.76,You've referred several times to the jury.
2019.18-6135,0,63166,sarah_schrup,,1106.88,1109.04,"Well, two points, Justice Kavanaugh."
2019.18-6135,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1117.8,1118.32,Well --
2019.18-6135,0,63166,sarah_schrup,,1118.32,1119.56,-- evidentiary mechanisms.
2019.18-6135,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1119.56,1134.52,"Sorry to interrupt, but I think one of the debates was, in fact, about putting it into a mens rea defense as Kansas has done, in part because the concept as a separate defense was too confusing for jurors."
2019.18-6135,0,63166,sarah_schrup,,1151.48,1153.08,"Justice Kavanaugh, they have abolished."
2019.18-6135,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1170.12,1170.4,Ms. --
2019.18-6135,0,63166,sarah_schrup,,1170.4,1171.2,-- of criminal culpability.
2019.18-6135,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1171.2,1192.8,"Ms. Schrup, do you have any information about how this works in the 46 states that have the rule that you prefer? In other words, how often do people raise insanity defenses? How often do juries actually find insanity? If this were in one of the other 46 states, how would it operate? But -- or -- or not if this case was."
2019.18-6135,0,63166,sarah_schrup,,1209.28,1212.68,"So, Justice Kagan, it's not in the record."
2019.18-6135,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1223.12,1227.48,"And, counsel, can I just -- one other question about the extent of how far this goes."
2019.18-6135,0,63166,sarah_schrup,,1245.68,1249.52,"I don't think that you draw the line, Justice Gorsuch, at punishment."
2019.18-6135,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1249.52,1259.64,"So an insanity defense is required with respect to any criminal complaint, even a regulatory strict liability misdemeanor?"
2019.18-6135,0,63166,sarah_schrup,,1259.64,1266.72,"This Court has never -- well, so it's our position -- we're making a facial challenge, so it's our position it should be applied everywhere."
2019.18-6135,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1266.72,1267.0,Okay.
2019.18-6135,0,63166,sarah_schrup,,1267.0,1271.08,But this Court has never definitively ruled on the extent of strict liability crimes.
2019.18-6135,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1301.76,1306.64,"If a state adopted the irresistible impulse defense, would that be unconstitutional?"
2019.18-6135,0,63166,sarah_schrup,,1306.64,1310.36,This Court in Leland said that it is not a constitutional floor.
2019.18-6135,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1311.8,1318.84,"No, not whether it's required, but would that be unconstitutional because it does not ask whether the person knew right from wrong?"
2019.18-6135,0,63166,sarah_schrup,,1318.84,1325.16,"I think, yes, it would -- it would also have to include the right-and-wrong principle. I'd like to turn briefly to the Eighth Amendment."
2019.18-6135,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1373.8,1382.2,"The Kansas Supreme Court didn't reach that question, so you are asking to -- us to decide it as a matter of first impression."
2019.18-6135,0,63166,sarah_schrup,,1382.2,1402.2,"No, Justice Ginsburg. And this -- you know, was vetted at the cert stage, and I would point this Court to the addendum to -- at our cert reply at page 18 and 19, because there it's clear that this notion of applying wrongfulness to the insanity defense came up at oral argument, was argued, and in that post-argument memo, counsel said we believe that this issue is presented."
2019.18-6135,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1407.96,1433.52,"What do you do with the statement of Justice Marshall for a plurality in Powell versus Texas? ""Nothing could be less fruitful than for this Court to be impelled into defining some sort of insanity defense -- or insanity test in constitutional terms."" I think pointing out the difficulty of us, through the Due Process Clause, wading into this policy debate and figuring out what the line is."
2019.18-6135,0,63166,sarah_schrup,,1433.52,1437.52,"Justice Kavanaugh, that -- and Powell was not an abolition case, first of all."
2019.18-6135,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1454.48,1465.8,But Leland in turn said -- noted the wide disagreement among different tests and said choice of a test involves not only scientific knowledge but questions of basic policy.
2019.18-6135,0,63166,sarah_schrup,,1478.44,1489.08,"Well, Leland also recognized the right-and-wrong principle was the majority test in the majority of jurisdictions. And that holds true today because 48 jurisdictions have retained this baseline principle."
2019.18-6135,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1489.56,1491.96,Are -- are all 48 constitutional?
2019.18-6135,0,63166,sarah_schrup,,1491.96,1493.8,"If they have the right-and-wrong principle, they are."
2019.18-6135,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1494.44,1495.16,Is that a yes?
2019.18-6135,0,63166,sarah_schrup,,1495.16,1496.0,"Yes, I'm sorry."
2019.18-6135,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1496.0,1497.68,All 48 are constitutional?
2019.18-6135,0,63166,sarah_schrup,,1497.68,1498.24,Yes.
2019.18-6135,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1498.24,1505.24,Justice Marshall's -- Justice Marshall's statement in Powell was not limited in the way that you suggest.
2019.18-6135,0,63166,sarah_schrup,,1512.76,1514.64,Mr. Chief Justice?
2019.18-6135,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1514.64,1514.96,Briefly.
2019.18-6135,0,63166,sarah_schrup,,1514.96,1515.52,Okay.
2019.18-6135,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1525.44,1532.52,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Crouse."
2019.18-6135,1,63167,toby_crouse,,1532.52,1544.6,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Petitioner asked this Court to define a rule of insanity and to require the states to implement that rule in its criminal justice proceedings."
2019.18-6135,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1654.4,1655.32,Mr. Crouse --
2019.18-6135,1,63167,toby_crouse,,1655.32,1655.72,-- to have US --
2019.18-6135,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1655.72,1689.44,"I -- I understand what you're saying, but I have a problem because, as I understand the mens rea test, it takes away excusing a person who, from the 15 -- 1400s, would have been considered a lunatic, a person who hears voices and the voices tell him or her what to do, and they have no volition to fight back. They -- many of them know they're killing somebody."
2019.18-6135,1,63167,toby_crouse,,1725.92,1726.68,"Well, it -- it does."
2019.18-6135,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1748.08,1749.84,But that's not how I read your charge.
2019.18-6135,1,63167,toby_crouse,,1760.56,1760.88,Yeah.
2019.18-6135,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1760.88,1763.72,But it's not part of the mens rea test.
2019.18-6135,1,63167,toby_crouse,,1769.12,1771.96,"Do you have criminal intent, that's right."
2019.18-6135,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1772.24,1773.04,"No, no --"
2019.18-6135,1,63167,toby_crouse,,1773.04,1773.6,What I --
2019.18-6135,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1773.6,1776.2,"-- there's not -- yes, you're -- you're adding a volition."
2019.18-6135,1,63167,toby_crouse,,1781.76,1791.0,"So, as I -- I understand Petitioner's test, is they want to ask the question of whether or not the individual knows that it's either legally or morally right versus wrong."
2019.18-6135,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1795.0,1795.8,"Well, I think there --"
2019.18-6135,1,63167,toby_crouse,,1795.8,1799.96,-- after conviction then you have the opportunity to assert a right versus wrong test.
2019.18-6135,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1799.96,1807.44,"Well, but that's the point, which is that issue, which is after conviction."
2019.18-6135,1,63167,toby_crouse,,1854.84,1875.96,"I'm saying what the state of Kansas has done is it has defined its mental illness defense consistent with what the historical teachings are, dating back to Blackstone, going all the way up to the 1910, I believe it was Professor -- Dean Orville Morris indicated that up until the 19th Century, that being M'Naghten, criminal intent was what handled everything with regard to criminal insanity."
2019.18-6135,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1875.96,1920.72,"So, General Crouse, could you assume for a moment that I disagree with you on the reading of the historical record? And just let's say that the historical record actually -- that there's much more evidence than you are suggesting that a defendant had to have a guilty mind, meaning an understanding that what he was doing was immoral, as well as the inability to form specific criminal intent. And if -- if that's the case, if you look at the -- all the cases and say, you know, case after case after case what they're talking about is something more than criminal intent, what they're talking about is some kind of moral understanding, if that's the case what's your best argument that you should win?"
2019.18-6135,1,63167,toby_crouse,,1920.72,1924.84,So I think I have three. The first one is the existence of strict liability.
2019.18-6135,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1959.2,1999.84,"You know, I guess I -- I understand that there are some variations in the historical record and even in states now, but -- but there are some number of states, a great number, 46 states, 48 states, whatever it is, that go further than you do in terms of saying something more is required than the mere capacity to -- to formulate criminal intent, and that that something more in large measure is some ability to -- to -- to make moral judgments and to distinguish between right and wrong. And, again, let's just assume that -- that that's what the historical record said."
2019.18-6135,1,63167,toby_crouse,,2006.12,2009.2,I -- I could because of the nature of this Court's inquiry.
2019.18-6135,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2027.16,2045.36,"But it seems that by its nature, if the principle is, as Justice Kagan suggests, hypothetically, if it's historically established that you cannot punish people who don't know the difference between right and wrong, that certainly sounds like something that is rooted in the conscience and would be ranked as fundamental."
2019.18-6135,1,63167,toby_crouse,,2045.36,2067.36,"Well, I -- I think what the -- what the -- and I don't mean to fight the hypothetical here -- but my understanding of the history is that what has been dealt with throughout our time is how to resolve and handle mental illness within the criminal capability system. And what this Court's decision, Arizona versus Clark said, is that there is no fundamental --"
2019.18-6135,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2067.36,2069.24,You're not going to get it exactly.
2019.18-6135,1,63167,toby_crouse,,2117.48,2127.44,"So I think that's -- the difference is criminal intent in the first situation because, as I understand the hypothetical, the individual intends to commit a crime against a human being."
2019.18-6135,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2127.44,2144.6,"I -- I -- I know these are words, you see, I want it looking for something in terms of criminal law or legal purpose or human purpose or whatever that would treat the two -- why treat them differently? One answer you've given, you said it's so hard to figure out."
2019.18-6135,1,63167,toby_crouse,,2185.04,2190.52,So I -- I think that this Court's cases have historically allowed legislative --
2019.18-6135,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2190.52,2190.8,I don't care --
2019.18-6135,1,63167,toby_crouse,,2190.8,2191.04,-- bodies --
2019.18-6135,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2191.04,2193.44,-- what the cases say at this moment.
2019.18-6135,1,63167,toby_crouse,,2225.84,2229.48,So -- and I apologize for not getting to the answer of your question.
2019.18-6135,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2251.92,2252.96,You're -- you're telling me --
2019.18-6135,1,63167,toby_crouse,,2252.96,2253.32,Our -- our --
2019.18-6135,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2253.32,2265.36,"-- that states -- and you're right, particularly Kansas, do, in fact, treat he's a dog, the dog told me to do it, differently."
2019.18-6135,1,63167,toby_crouse,,2268.88,2282.04,"Well, I think it's a spectrum as to what the states believe is appropriate. In Delaware, for example, my understanding is that individual would not be convicted, whereas in Illinois that person could be convicted because they know that shooting a human being is legally wrong."
2019.18-6135,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2282.04,2303.2,"Do you think, General Crouse, that you could also eliminate consideration of the moral understanding at sentencing, in other words, take the Justice Breyer example and the dog told me to do it, would it be unconstitutional if your state did not have a procedure for considering that at sentencing?"
2019.18-6135,1,63167,toby_crouse,,2303.2,2307.0,So obviously a different question and I think it also engenders a different test.
2019.18-6135,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2315.92,2318.08,"Well, let's put the Eighth Amendment to the side."
2019.18-6135,1,63167,toby_crouse,,2330.2,2338.28,I don't believe that this Court's cases would indicate that the states have to consider the morality at sentencing or any particular time.
2019.18-6135,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2338.28,2338.84,But the --
2019.18-6135,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2338.84,2344.6,"How about -- how about the mens rea aspect of that? I -- I -- I just want to follow up on Justice Breyer's question as well, and Justice Kagan."
2019.18-6135,1,63167,toby_crouse,,2357.2,2363.96,"Well, yes, I would accept that carving out strict liability in the corporate liability context."
2019.18-6135,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2363.96,2368.0,Why? And how do you reconcile that with our strict liability cases?
2019.18-6135,1,63167,toby_crouse,,2368.0,2375.48,"Well, I -- I think what this Court has done is historically guarded mens rea because that's what separates innocent conduct from criminal conduct."
2019.18-6135,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2377.8,2388.8,So you -- you accept that there is a constitutional minimum floor below which the state -- states cannot proceed with respect to mental capacity and insanity; you just suggest that you've met that standard.
2019.18-6135,1,63167,toby_crouse,,2388.8,2388.96,I --
2019.18-6135,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2388.96,2390.72,"Is that the -- the nub of the argument, then?"
2019.18-6135,1,63167,toby_crouse,,2390.72,2392.76,I think I would finely parse that a little bit.
2019.18-6135,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2405.24,2407.16,I'm not sure I understand.
2019.18-6135,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2415.0,2415.12,No.
2019.18-6135,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2415.12,2434.88,"-- which is could -- could you do away with the mens rea defense? Could you simply say we in Kansas believe if you kill someone, regardless of the reasons, if you've done the act, you've committed murder? Period, end of story."
2019.18-6135,1,63167,toby_crouse,,2437.56,2451.2,"Again, I think that is a much more difficult situation, and I -- I -- I think that would present a -- a lot of additional problems for the State of Kansas because of this Court's requirement of having a mens rea baseline."
2019.18-6135,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2451.2,2451.48,Could you --

2019.18-6135,1,63167,toby_crouse,,2459.32,2466.72,"Yeah, so -- so I -- I think the same historical analysis that we have undergone with regard to the insanity test is something that we would have to look at."

2019.18-6135,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2469.56,2471.88,You seem very reticent about answering these questions.
2019.18-6135,1,63167,toby_crouse,,2491.16,2491.4,No.
2019.18-6135,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2493.32,2517.8,"On the history that Justice Kagan was asking about, I think your primary answer was that there's been no particular test that is historically rooted. But isn't there a baseline that is historically rooted, above which there have been a variety of tests that have been accepted by the states until, as Justice Sotomayor said, until the end of the 20th century?"
2019.18-6135,1,63167,toby_crouse,,2517.8,2531.68,"I -- I think I would agree that the states have -- organized societies have consistently struggled with how to define and handle mental illness, but I don't believe that there has been a baseline that has been established beneath which the states could go."
2019.18-6135,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2531.68,2545.76,"Well, since the early 1800s, at least, to the late 20th century in the United States, didn't every state allow some form of a separate insanity defense at the guilt phase?"
2019.18-6135,1,63167,toby_crouse,,2545.76,2551.56,My understanding is that the treatment of insanity has varied within particular parameters.
2019.18-6135,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2558.52,2577.64,"But all separate -- let me just focus on my question. All -- all the states had something separate from the mens rea approach at the guilt phase through the end of the 20th century; isn't that correct as a matter of historical practice? You can still win the case, as Justice Kagan noted, but just to make sure we're on the same page."
2019.18-6135,1,63167,toby_crouse,,2577.64,2589.2,"Yeah, and I'm not trying to -- to skip the answer, because I think Kansas actually included it as part of the guilt phase. It didn't have a separate insanity defense. So, for example, it came in with a different definition."
2019.18-6135,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2589.2,2593.8,"I mean, you're saying all states had a separate insanity defense in 1791?"
2019.18-6135,1,63167,toby_crouse,,2593.8,2596.4,I -- I -- I don't believe I was saying that --
2019.18-6135,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2596.4,2596.64,No.
2019.18-6135,1,63167,toby_crouse,,2596.64,2597.56,-- they have separate defenses.
2019.18-6135,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2604.12,2607.48,"Some of them handled it through mens rea, did they not?"
2019.18-6135,1,63167,toby_crouse,,2607.48,2608.96,They have.
2019.18-6135,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2608.96,2621.52,Does mens rea for murder or for any other criminal defense vary from case to case? Is it not the same in every case regardless of whether the person claims to be mentally ill or not?
2019.18-6135,1,63167,toby_crouse,,2621.52,2625.24,"The mens rea element would be consistent in an attempt to commit a crime, yes."
2019.18-6135,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2625.24,2649.76,"So if the mens rea element traditionally incorporated a requirement of moral capability -- of moral culpability, that would apply across the board, would it not? Not just to cases where the person says this is -- I -- I had this lack of capacity due to mental illness, but I have it due to political brainwashing or religious fanaticism or any other reason?"
2019.18-6135,1,63167,toby_crouse,,2649.76,2652.4,"That's correct, Justice Alito."
2019.18-6135,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2652.4,2656.16,"I mean, is that -- was was that the traditional understanding of mens rea?"
2019.18-6135,1,63167,toby_crouse,,2656.16,2660.8,So I don't believe that was consistent with the historical understanding of mens rea.
2019.18-6135,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2666.92,2673.6,"Would -- would you agree that historically, if you go back and you look at the cases, you see this operating in two categories of cases."
2019.18-6135,1,63167,toby_crouse,,2702.44,2707.16,So I would push back only in -- in regard to whether or not it was a moral capability.
2019.18-6135,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2723.04,2725.4,But it wasn't phrased at that.
2019.18-6135,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2738.76,2740.72,Finish your question.
2019.18-6135,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2740.72,2743.56,I'm not sure I want to. (Laughter.)
2019.18-6135,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2743.56,2744.72,"Thank you, counsel."
2019.18-6135,1,63167,toby_crouse,,2744.72,2745.04,Thank you.
2019.18-6135,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2745.04,2746.48,Ms. Prelogar.
2019.18-6135,2,62747,elizabeth_b_prelogar,,2746.48,2806.0,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Petitioner bears the burden of establishing that substantive due process principles override the Kansas legislature's judgment in this case in adopting a mens rea test of insanity, and he has not carried that burden. Petitioner suggests that this Court should recognize a theory of moral culpability and impose that uniformly across the states. But the problem with that approach is, both as a matter of history and in contemporaneous practice, there has been no agreement on the precise circumstances when mental illness should excuse criminal responsibility. And I'd like to begin, actually, with the hypotheticals that Justice Sotomayor and Justice Breyer brought up, because I think that this actually illustrates that even in contemporary jurisdictions today, there is a basic divide on when someone should be entitled to invoke the insanity defense."
2019.18-6135,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2854.16,2855.16,Excuse me.
2019.18-6135,2,62747,elizabeth_b_prelogar,,2960.64,2974.64,"And, Justice Sotomayor, Kansas here has recognized cognitive incapacity as the way that you excuse criminal responsibility when you are assessing these difficult issues of how mental illness should function to excuse criminal culpability in a criminal justice system."
2019.18-6135,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2974.64,2974.84,But that's --
2019.18-6135,2,62747,elizabeth_b_prelogar,,2974.84,2975.24,I think that --
2019.18-6135,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2975.24,2976.08,-- where we differ.
2019.18-6135,2,62747,elizabeth_b_prelogar,,2976.08,2977.56,But to the extent that what --
2019.18-6135,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2977.56,2982.52,Because you could know something is against the law and still not have the ability to conform your conduct.
2019.18-6135,2,62747,elizabeth_b_prelogar,,2999.12,2999.28,And our --
2019.18-6135,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2999.28,3003.04,"But that's a different, sort of --"
2019.18-6135,2,62747,elizabeth_b_prelogar,,3003.04,3005.4,I absolutely agree it's a different test of insanity.
2019.18-6135,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3015.8,3016.28,"But, Ms. --"
2019.18-6135,2,62747,elizabeth_b_prelogar,,3016.28,3018.12,Which would pull someone totally outside the realm of --
2019.18-6135,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3018.12,3018.68,Ms. Prelogar --
2019.18-6135,2,62747,elizabeth_b_prelogar,,3018.68,3019.0,-- criminal culpability.
2019.18-6135,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3019.0,3022.52,-- what you are suggesting as a test for insanity is not a test for insanity.
2019.18-6135,2,62747,elizabeth_b_prelogar,,3058.28,3061.92,So I don't think that there is something else here.
2019.18-6135,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3092.08,3092.24,But --
2019.18-6135,2,62747,elizabeth_b_prelogar,,3092.24,3092.6,-- for a moment --
2019.18-6135,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3092.6,3122.2,"Ms. Prelogar, let's just say I disagree with this, that when I look back at the history I see lots of cases, Rex v. Arnold, Billingham, a number of others, which make it quite clear, I mean, these are all people who had an intent to kill. And what the common law was saying was that even though they had the intent to kill, there was going to be a further inquiry into how their insanity limited their moral understanding, that -- their understanding of wrongfulness of their act."
2019.18-6135,2,62747,elizabeth_b_prelogar,,3127.88,3147.16,"Well, I want to make clear that even if you thought this was a novel approach that didn't have roots in history, the Court has many times recognized that outlier states aren't necessarily violating substantive due process. Leland versus Oregon, for example, was a case where Oregon was the only state in the nation that required defendants to prove their insanity beyond a reasonable doubt."
2019.18-6135,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3172.2,3198.8,"Well, it's -- it's less helpful to me to go over each case one by one than for you to tell me that if, you know, if I -- what I think is true is that the history, there's -- there's -- there's just a ton that suggests that -- that there was something more than a requirement that the defendant have -- be able to form an intent to kill. Does -- does Ms. Schrup then win?"
2019.18-6135,2,62747,elizabeth_b_prelogar,,3198.8,3206.08,"I don't think so, because Petitioner still bears the burden of trying to articulate with precision what that something more is."
2019.18-6135,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3206.64,3207.08,You can --
2019.18-6135,2,62747,elizabeth_b_prelogar,,3207.08,3207.32,-- think for this here --
2019.18-6135,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3207.32,3212.36,"You can, I mean, that was the point of my question, I think."
2019.18-6135,2,62747,elizabeth_b_prelogar,,3274.16,3277.36,"So these are obviously difficult questions, Justice Breyer."
2019.18-6135,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3329.88,3330.76,How does that stay --
2019.18-6135,2,62747,elizabeth_b_prelogar,,3330.76,3331.52,-- I think that these --
2019.18-6135,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3331.52,3358.76,"-- consistent with Apprendi, assuming we find that since the beginning of modern thought that there is an irreducible minimum of due process that requires the insane to be not convicted by a judge or put in a mental institution by a judge but by a jury?"
2019.18-6135,2,62747,elizabeth_b_prelogar,,3358.76,3360.96,"May I answer, Mr. Chief Justice?"
2019.18-6135,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3360.96,3361.72,Yes.
2019.18-6135,2,62747,elizabeth_b_prelogar,,3361.72,3365.72,"There would still be a question, Justice Sotomayor, of how you define who is the insane."

2019.18-6135,3,63166,sarah_schrup,,3546.36,3555.16,"It was tied to common law intent, if we use the term mens rea, but it was tied to common law intent, which is a very different term than what they used, Justice Alito."

So that's your historical position."

2019.18-6135,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3568.68,3595.52,"And how do you reconcile that with the fact that mens rea does not vary from crime to crime? So if that was the understanding of mens rea, that would apply in every case and there would have to be moral blame worthiness in every case, not just those where the -- the -- the lack of blame worthiness is attributable to mental -- to a mental disorder, however that is defined?"

2019.18-6135,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3612.0,3616.52,-- to the person who said I assassinated this political leader because he is an evil person --
2019.18-6135,3,63166,sarah_schrup,,3616.52,3616.56,Oh.
2019.18-6135,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3616.56,3618.76,-- and he is going to do evil things.
2019.18-6135,3,63166,sarah_schrup,,3618.76,3625.64,"No, Justice Alito, because the only people that were -- that this has traditionally been applied to are the insane and maybe infants and that's what --"
2019.18-6135,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3625.64,3631.24,"And that's what you are arguing for, a separate insanity defense, and that was M'Naghten."
2019.18-6135,3,63166,sarah_schrup,,3643.8,3653.24,"Our position is that to the extent it was tied to mens rea, inherent in the notion of mens rea was the ability to choose between right and wrong. So that is very different."
2019.18-6135,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3657.8,3669.8,"I mean, these 18th Century cases that talk about moral capability or lack thereof in mens rea in the same breadth are hard to understand, but you have to take into account -- may I finish my sentence --"
2019.18-6135,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3669.8,3670.28,Certainly.
2019.18-6135,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3670.28,3671.68,-- Mr. Chief Justice? (Laughter.)
2019.18-6135,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3671.68,3683.44,That you have to take into account that people -- that the 18th Century and early 19th Century understanding of how the human mind works was very different from what we have today.
2019.18-6135,3,63166,sarah_schrup,,3691.16,3692.04,Mr. Chief Justice?
2019.18-6135,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3692.04,3692.8,You may.
2019.18-6135,3,63166,sarah_schrup,,3692.8,3696.76,I want to answer this succinctly.
2019.18-6135,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3711.16,3712.08,"Thank you, counsel."
