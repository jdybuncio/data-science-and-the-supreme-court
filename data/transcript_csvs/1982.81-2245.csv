1982.81-2245,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,8.103,"We will hear arguments next in Nevada against United States, et al.--"
1982.81-2245,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,101.255,112.279,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, I represent the state of Nevada, and I will be followed by Mr. Girard, representing the Truckee-Carson Irrigation District, or TCID."
1982.81-2245,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,320.103,321.881,Who were the Orr Ditch defendants?
1982.81-2245,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,321.881,328.098,"The Orr Ditch defendants were some 744 claimants to the Truckee River, Your Honor."
1982.81-2245,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,328.098,331.019,Wholly... who had pre-existing rights?
1982.81-2245,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,331.019,333.362,"That's correct, of varying priorities."
1982.81-2245,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,333.362,336.361,Wholly aside from those who would get water from the Newlands?
1982.81-2245,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,336.361,337.234,I'm sorry.
1982.81-2245,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,337.234,341.484,Wholly aside from those who would get water from the Newlands.
1982.81-2245,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,341.484,352.181,"Yes, these claimants, Your Honor, I think eight of them actually proceeded the reservation claims, and most of them came between then and 1902, and some came after 1902."
1982.81-2245,1,24009,frederick_g_girard,,817.025,824.773,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the government contends in this case that it owns the project water rights."
1982.81-2245,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,896.929,904.316,Did the government quantify the Newlands water right they were claiming in terms of what acreage they planned to water?
1982.81-2245,1,24009,frederick_g_girard,,904.316,917.094,"Yes, the degree provides, Justice White, for the allocation of water to 232,000 of acres, or gives the government the right to divert water for 232,000 acres."
1982.81-2245,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,917.094,921.076,"Was that land all under private ownership then, or did the United States own it?"
1982.81-2245,1,24009,frederick_g_girard,,921.076,922.671,Both.
1982.81-2245,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,926.278,932.556,"But water was allocated for all of it, and all of it, I take it, has later become privately owned."
1982.81-2245,1,24009,frederick_g_girard,,932.556,933.539,That is correct.
1982.81-2245,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,945.658,953.219,Were any contracts entered into for the delivery of water before the final decree?
1982.81-2245,1,24009,frederick_g_girard,,953.219,957.875,"Yes, certainly--"
1982.81-2245,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,957.875,958.546,Long before.
1982.81-2245,1,24009,frederick_g_girard,,958.546,959.466,--Certainly I would say the majority.
1982.81-2245,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,959.466,960.64,When was the Newlands finished?
1982.81-2245,1,24009,frederick_g_girard,,960.64,966.384,"The physical project was finished about in 1919, I would guess, Judge."
1982.81-2245,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,967.028,969.227,And when was water first delivered to them.
1982.81-2245,1,24009,frederick_g_girard,,969.227,973.603,"--Water was first delivered... well, the first delivery of water was 1908."
1982.81-2245,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,976.882,981.159,"Well, I suppose, then, they were delivered under contract with private owners?"
1982.81-2245,1,24009,frederick_g_girard,,981.159,981.786,Right.
1982.81-2245,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,981.786,985.503,"Or really, was it with a contract with TCID, or--"
1982.81-2245,1,24009,frederick_g_girard,,985.503,988.501,"No, TCID was not in existence until 1926."
1982.81-2245,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,988.985,989.422,--Yes.
1982.81-2245,1,24009,frederick_g_girard,,991.625,992.78,--The United States.
1982.81-2245,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,994.359,996.609,And what did TCID have to do with it?
1982.81-2245,1,24009,frederick_g_girard,,996.609,1001.183,TCID became the operator of the project in 1926.
1982.81-2245,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1001.183,1001.951,For the United States?
1982.81-2245,1,24009,frederick_g_girard,,1001.951,1003.917,"For the United States, under a contract which--"
1982.81-2245,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1003.917,1009.057,"And bound, was it, to observe the contracts the United States had entered into?"
1982.81-2245,1,24009,frederick_g_girard,,1009.057,1017.46,"--Yes, and incidentally, TCID itself entered into some contracts with some of the landowners who had purchased their water rights after 1926."
1982.81-2245,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1017.46,1017.99,Right.
1982.81-2245,1,24009,frederick_g_girard,,1017.99,1032.578,"And TCID itself in the Orr Ditch decree was given the right to divert the water allocated to the United States, and the decree was allocated to TCID to divert in the Truckee River agreement, which was a part of the decree."
1982.81-2245,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1032.578,1039.075,So was all the water generated by Newlands covered by contract with private owners?
1982.81-2245,1,24009,frederick_g_girard,,1039.075,1049.26,"There are contract water rights on the Newlands project covering 73,002 acres, not 232,000 acres."
1982.81-2245,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1054.381,1057.006,"So that is all the water there is available, I take it."
1982.81-2245,1,24009,frederick_g_girard,,1057.006,1059.52,"That's correct, from both rivers, the Carson and the Truckee."
1982.81-2245,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1059.52,1072.984,"If you divide up the Truckee and the Carson between the... the Orr Ditch defendants, the Newlands water contractees, and the reservation, you have used all the water."
1982.81-2245,1,24009,frederick_g_girard,,1073.639,1079.981,"That's correct, except for years where you, you know, where you have like a million acres flowing down the river."
1982.81-2245,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1079.981,1080.355,Yes.
1982.81-2245,1,24009,frederick_g_girard,,1080.355,1083.682,"Which just goes to Pyramid Lake, but in a normal year, that's correct, Justice White."
1982.81-2245,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1084.558,1094.226,"Mr. Girard, I read Ickes against Fox as turning at least in part on the nature of the Washington system for water rights."
1982.81-2245,1,24009,frederick_g_girard,,1098.566,1105.611,"--Nevada has a system appropriation in nature, and you file an appropriation, you acquire a water right by a permit."
1982.81-2245,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1154.246,1166.039,You think then the United States has simply in effect or actually sold water to these private owners.
1982.81-2245,1,24009,frederick_g_girard,,1166.039,1167.182,They have sold--
1982.81-2245,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1167.182,1168.679,They sold water rights to them.
1982.81-2245,1,24009,frederick_g_girard,,1168.679,1172.021,"--Sold them a water right, and it is designated as such in the conveyances."
1982.81-2245,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1172.021,1172.945,And so they are owned.
1982.81-2245,1,24009,frederick_g_girard,,1175.457,1177.504,The water right... that's correct.
1982.81-2245,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1177.504,1185.205,"And you say the effect of this suit or this judgment is to set aside those conveyances to some extent, anyway?"
1982.81-2245,1,24009,frederick_g_girard,,1185.205,1188.593,"The plain fact of the matter is, this suit has prevailed."
1982.81-2245,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1195.729,1200.292,I don't know whether they really purchased it.
1982.81-2245,1,24009,frederick_g_girard,,1204.414,1206.773,In this case the project users.
1982.81-2245,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1207.6,1209.242,Have they ever paid it off?
1982.81-2245,1,24009,frederick_g_girard,,1209.242,1215.614,"--Ninety-five percent of the purchase of the land and the water rights have been paid off today, since this project."
1982.81-2245,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1455.968,1468.697,"Mr. Girard, why isn't TCID bound by whatever knowledge the U.S. government had in connection with the case?"
1982.81-2245,1,24009,frederick_g_girard,,1476.71,1483.518,"--No, I... TCID came into the picture, was not in existence until 1926."
1982.81-2245,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1492.468,1493.407,All right.
1982.81-2245,1,24009,frederick_g_girard,,1493.407,1504.634,"TCID was designated by the trial court as a class representative of the project farmers, and when I make that statement, I really mean it as far as the project farmers, not the entity."
1982.81-2245,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1506.993,1510.553,But you have also some contract obligations to them.
1982.81-2245,1,24009,frederick_g_girard,,1510.553,1512.336,"Yes, and we fully perform them."
1982.81-2245,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1536.559,1543.777,Mr. Pelcyger.
1982.81-2245,2,40187,robert_s_pelcyger,,1543.777,1561.068,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the Pyramid Lake Reservation was established in 1859 for the Pyramid Lake Paiute Tribe of Indians, whose name for themselves is Cui-ui Dicato, cui-ui eaters."
1982.81-2245,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1584.601,1588.442,That was their historic... that was their ancestral country?
1982.81-2245,2,40187,robert_s_pelcyger,,1588.442,1590.018,"Yes, sir, it was their historic home."
1982.81-2245,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1614.038,1617.587,"Counsel, I am curious about one thing which is totally irrelevant."
1982.81-2245,2,40187,robert_s_pelcyger,,1620.445,1646.825,"The lake... the salinity level of the lake is 5,500 parts per million, which compares to the ocean, for example, of 35,000 parts per million of total dissolved solids, so it is about one-seventh as... less salty than the ocean, but compared to the river, the river is only, say, 250 parts per million or 500 parts per million, so it is much saltier than the ocean, and the fish--"
1982.81-2245,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1646.825,1647.839,There is no outlet to the lake at all?
1982.81-2245,2,40187,robert_s_pelcyger,,1647.839,1652.414,"--There is no outlet, but the fish need the fresh water to spawn in."
1982.81-2245,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1656.383,1658.68,Can they get up now?
1982.81-2245,2,40187,robert_s_pelcyger,,1658.68,1660.427,They can get up now.
1982.81-2245,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1666.55,1667.443,And are they using it?
1982.81-2245,2,40187,robert_s_pelcyger,,1667.443,1672.64,"Yes, they are, and last year there were 15,000 fish that ascended that fishway to spawn."
1982.81-2245,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1672.64,1673.206,And returned?
1982.81-2245,2,40187,robert_s_pelcyger,,1673.206,1674.188,And returned.
1982.81-2245,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1675.202,1679.25,"Are the cutthroat trout gone completely, or have they been--"
1982.81-2245,2,40187,robert_s_pelcyger,,1679.25,1685.451,"No, there is an interesting biological question that biologists like to debate about."
1982.81-2245,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1729.261,1732.509,--Because they couldn't get above the Derby Dam?
1982.81-2245,2,40187,robert_s_pelcyger,,1732.509,1734.459,"--No, because they couldn't get out of the lake--"
1982.81-2245,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1734.459,1734.943,I see.
1982.81-2245,2,40187,robert_s_pelcyger,,1735.758,1754.639,"--The obscure question is whether the eggs that were taken from the Pyramid Lake, Lahontan cutthroat trout, and were deposited all over the western United States prior to 1940, whether that gene pool still exists in these other places and are now being restored to the lake by getting eggs from those fish."
1982.81-2245,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1843.603,1847.963,"What fish were the Indians selling to the Army, or to the white settlers?"
1982.81-2245,2,40187,robert_s_pelcyger,,1847.963,1848.868,--The trout.
1982.81-2245,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1850.757,1851.709,All right.
1982.81-2245,2,40187,robert_s_pelcyger,,1851.709,1861.018,"The trout is now an endangered species... I'm sorry, the trout is now a threatened species."
1982.81-2245,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1871.89,1878.948,"Well, is that information any more reliable than information we got that the snake doddle was about to go?"
1982.81-2245,2,40187,robert_s_pelcyger,,1878.948,1880.574,"--I can't speak to that, Justice Marshall."
1982.81-2245,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1910.327,1925.695,"Do you have any response to the assertion by Nevada that there was formal adversity in the 1926 TRO and in the final decree, as they pointed out in the reply brief?"
1982.81-2245,2,40187,robert_s_pelcyger,,1925.695,1927.228,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1982.81-2245,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1970.879,1983.189,"Nevada also argues that you don't need adversity, as Judge Schroeder felt in her dissent, in a water litigation, that everyone in the case is bound, whether or not they were adverse to one another."
1982.81-2245,2,40187,robert_s_pelcyger,,1983.189,1984.562,But you need justiciability.
1982.81-2245,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1986.796,1994.744,Is justiciability a requirement of... kind of a federal requirement in water rights?
1982.81-2245,2,40187,robert_s_pelcyger,,1994.744,1999.056,"--Well, justiciability is a constitutional requirement."
1982.81-2245,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1999.056,1999.961,It's an... yes.
1982.81-2245,2,40187,robert_s_pelcyger,,1999.961,2013.691,"And the issue here, the reason that justiciability is important relates to the identity of claims issue of res judicata, because there is no question that the fishery water right was not actually litigated in Orr Ditch."
1982.81-2245,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2015.972,2018.078,Why do you say a fishery water right?
1982.81-2245,2,40187,robert_s_pelcyger,,2028.654,2029.73,--It's not just an argument.
1982.81-2245,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2033.294,2035.478,"--Okay, so the government forgot to put in some evidence."
1982.81-2245,2,40187,robert_s_pelcyger,,2035.478,2036.293,"--Well, I don't think it's that."
1982.81-2245,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2049.895,2050.581,There you are.
1982.81-2245,2,40187,robert_s_pelcyger,,2058.937,2061.452,Who had an interest in the Newlands water right?
1982.81-2245,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2061.452,2061.889,Yes.
1982.81-2245,2,40187,robert_s_pelcyger,,2061.889,2064.093,"The United States and the project farmers, and TCID."
1982.81-2245,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2064.093,2070.464,"The project farmers did, and you wouldn't... would you say that they were adverse to the... any more water for the Indians?"
1982.81-2245,2,40187,robert_s_pelcyger,,2070.464,2071.7,Were they adverse to it?
1982.81-2245,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2072.698,2078.119,Did they have adverse interests in the water right?
1982.81-2245,2,40187,robert_s_pelcyger,,2078.119,2079.257,There is no question but that there was a conflict.
1982.81-2245,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2087.958,2096.907,"Well, by the time of the final decree, it wasn't just the United States that was asking for a water right, or whose water right was being adjudged."
1982.81-2245,2,40187,robert_s_pelcyger,,2106.012,2108.028,--I am not suggesting that.
1982.81-2245,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2110.465,2117.976,Or that they could reallocate any way they wanted to the Newlands water right just because it was adjudicated to them in 1943 or--
1982.81-2245,2,40187,robert_s_pelcyger,,2117.976,2122.071,"No, I think the point of the United States is that... and I will let them speak for themselves... that--"
1982.81-2245,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2122.071,2123.007,"--Yes, well, I have read their brief."
1982.81-2245,2,40187,robert_s_pelcyger,,2123.007,2123.74,--Okay.
1982.81-2245,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2160.851,2168.377,"Well, you insist that the fishery water right is some sort of a separate kind of right from the Indian claim under the Winters doctrine generally."
1982.81-2245,2,40187,robert_s_pelcyger,,2173.907,2175.264,It was clearly distinguished by the government.
1982.81-2245,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2217.78,2221.918,--But aren't all water rights appurtenant to land?
1982.81-2245,2,40187,robert_s_pelcyger,,2227.353,2228.901,"Yes, but the land is different."
1982.81-2245,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2264.636,2266.337,"Now, that's what I wanted... you mentioned that earlier."
1982.81-2245,2,40187,robert_s_pelcyger,,2270.43,2271.912,That finding is... Let me quote it to you.
1982.81-2245,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2281.486,2282.691,Finding 9?
1982.81-2245,2,40187,robert_s_pelcyger,,2283.299,2284.017,Excuse me?
1982.81-2245,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2284.017,2284.329,Finding 9?
1982.81-2245,2,40187,robert_s_pelcyger,,2285.035,2285.456,Yes.
1982.81-2245,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2334.372,2340.197,"The finding doesn't quite say that they would have asked for more water if they weren't acting in both capacities, though."
1982.81-2245,2,40187,robert_s_pelcyger,,2342.588,2356.863,"Well, I think you can safely say by analogy to the criminal cases, to Cuyler against Sullivan and Wood against Georgia, that it certainly shows that the conflict influenced the conduct of the litigation and adversely affected it from the tribe's standpoint."
1982.81-2245,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2369.795,2379.622,"Well, is there any evidence other than... taken apart from the finding, what is the evidence that the government would have sought more water on behalf of the Indians had they not represented the other group?"
1982.81-2245,2,40187,robert_s_pelcyger,,2379.622,2393.862,"Because every time the issue was brought up, and there were specific recommendations made to assert the water right, the reason that it was not asserted had nothing to do with it wasn't meritorious, it wasn't a primary purpose of the reservation."
1982.81-2245,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2485.013,2504.087,"Mr. Kneedler, you may proceed when you are ready."
1982.81-2245,3,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2504.087,2507.49,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, I would like to make something clear at the outset of my argument."
1982.81-2245,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2553.691,2565.515,"Suppose, Mr. Kneedler, they had been absolute parties, named parties by the... in the case by the time of the final decree by virtue of their... by virtue of their contracts with the United States."
1982.81-2245,3,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2565.515,2568.217,"I think that might well have made a difference, Mr. Justice White."
1982.81-2245,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2568.217,2569.808,"Might well, or would?"
1982.81-2245,3,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2569.808,2571.886,"Well, it is certainly a distinguishing factor."
1982.81-2245,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2575.478,2609.181,"I would think it would, but you think this case is different just because the United States was sitting there with a bunch of contracts with landowners, and they got a final decree in the United States' favor for the Newlands Project, knowing all the time that they had contracted away all of that water that was available, and that... don't you think that the United States at least ought to be subject to specific performance of their contracts rather than... rather than take the water away and let the... and have to pay for it?"
1982.81-2245,3,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2609.181,2611.634,There are several responses.
1982.81-2245,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2670.84,2673.804,"Well, the amount of water was adjudicated to Newlands."
1982.81-2245,3,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2673.804,2675.648,"--To the United States, and--"
1982.81-2245,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2675.648,2676.116,Yes.
1982.81-2245,3,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2676.116,2676.962,--but the decree... the decree went--
1982.81-2245,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2676.962,2680.023,And the United States had already contracted it all away.
1982.81-2245,3,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2680.023,2681.927,--But the decree itself went no further.
1982.81-2245,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2692.533,2698.718,But Ickes against Fox surely says that the government doesn't get beneficial title to the water that's adjudicated in that way.
1982.81-2245,3,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2698.718,2710.48,"Yes, but the right that the project water users are asserting is not a right that was adjudicated, was recognized by the decree in Orr Ditch."
1982.81-2245,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2716.177,2717.679,Then that had already been done.
1982.81-2245,3,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2717.679,2722.269,"The contracts were entered into over a period of time, by the time of the final decree."
1982.81-2245,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2722.269,2723.786,"Well, it had all been done by the time of the final decree."
1982.81-2245,3,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2723.786,2724.504,Virtually all.
1982.81-2245,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2726.301,2736.701,"Well, don't you think the United States was just, in a way, not only a representative of the tribe, but a representative of the landowners in the final decree?"
1982.81-2245,3,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2739.606,2744.059,"Well, in terms of the text of the final decree, in fact, the answer is no."
1982.81-2245,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2746.512,2749.385,But what about for the purposes of res judicata?
1982.81-2245,3,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2749.385,2761.583,"--Well, for... I think that's quite important for the purposes of res judicata, because what we are talking about under res judicata is looking at the confines of the decree and what effect should be given to the decree."
1982.81-2245,3,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2798.02,2805.344,"Mr. Kneedler, is it conceded that many of these landowners actually paid the United States for the water rights they now enjoy?"
1982.81-2245,3,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2805.344,2807.765,Yes.
1982.81-2245,3,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2807.765,2820.571,"And if the government, the United States should ultimately prevail in this case, would it be the obligation of the United States government to condemn those rights and pay compensation."
1982.81-2245,3,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2820.571,2829.879,"I... at this point, Justice Powell, I am not at liberty to concede that the United States would be liable for damages."
1982.81-2245,3,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2829.879,2830.71,Isn't it--
1982.81-2245,3,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2830.71,2835.892,Certainly there would be a cause of action for either breach of contract or for taking.
1982.81-2245,3,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2847.841,2852.652,--Isn't it your position that the United States as a fiduciary defaulted in its duty?
1982.81-2245,3,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2852.652,2855.355,As a fiduciary to the tribe.
1982.81-2245,3,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2855.355,2855.948,Yes.
1982.81-2245,3,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2855.948,2858.884,"Yes, it is quite firmly our--"
1982.81-2245,3,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2858.884,2862.977,And the United States now wants to default in its duty to the landowners?
1982.81-2245,3,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2862.977,2867.973,"--Justice Powell, I don't suggest that the current circumstances are easy ones."
1982.81-2245,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2883.794,2889.336,"Mr. Kneedler, after the $8 million settlement, may the United States still be sued, as you suggest?"
1982.81-2245,3,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2892.867,2893.975,It forecloses the tribe.
1982.81-2245,3,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2899.037,2904.332,"The case is very, very worrisome, because any way it is decided, someone will lose."
1982.81-2245,3,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2912.56,2939.626,"--But when we look to the circumstances of the case, Justice Powell, what we have is a fishery water right that... a use to which the water of the Truckee was put from time immemorial by the Indians involved in this suit, a use to which it was being put at the time this very case was brought, and the District Court's findings in this case concur with what Mr. Pelcyger said."
1982.81-2245,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3002.082,3014.419,"--Do you think that conflict of interest, however, wouldn't prevent res judicata from attaching if the Newlands landowners had been parties at the time of the final decree?"
1982.81-2245,3,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3014.419,3019.653,"Well, I think that would be a different case, because the--"
1982.81-2245,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3019.653,3023.026,I thought you said a while ago it would be dispositive of the res judicata question.
1982.81-2245,3,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3023.026,3024.511,--I said it might well be dispositive.
1982.81-2245,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3036.351,3039.661,Do you defend the opinion of the Court of Appeals?
1982.81-2245,3,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3039.661,3047.845,"Yes, the position of the United States is that there is no need to disturb the water rights of the defendants who were sued in Orr Ditch."
1982.81-2245,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3047.845,3048.376,That is the judgment.
1982.81-2245,3,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3049.312,3050.938,Yes.
1982.81-2245,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3054.405,3062.025,"You are relying on the ground here, at least one of your grounds, that the Court of Appeals did not use, I take it."
1982.81-2245,3,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3062.025,3063.23,--No.
1982.81-2245,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3113.272,3130.39,"One of your arguments, I take it, wholly independent of res judicata, is that the water was adjudicated to the United States, and that as long as you... and that you can take the water away from one of your contractees and give it to somebody else just as long as you are willing to pay the contractees."
1982.81-2245,3,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3130.39,3131.841,"--No, Justice White, that is not--"
1982.81-2245,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3131.841,3132.906,I thought that was the message of your brief.
1982.81-2245,3,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3132.906,3134.107,"--Well, there--"
1982.81-2245,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3134.107,3135.293,You say you can--
1982.81-2245,3,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3136.841,3137.87,--That may be--
1982.81-2245,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3137.87,3141.119,You can reallocate your water any way you want to as long as you are willing to pay whoever you hurt.
1982.81-2245,3,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3141.119,3143.244,"--Well, that may be--"
1982.81-2245,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3143.244,3146.586,And who knows that 40 years from now you won't be coming back to rewrite history again.
1982.81-2245,3,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3146.586,3153.882,"--Well, we are not... as I said, we are not asserting the right to do this on the basis of a right to reallocate."
1982.81-2245,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3156.362,3160.347,"You certainly... I must have misread your brief, Mr. Kneedler."
1982.81-2245,3,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3160.347,3162.769,"--Well, what... our--"
1982.81-2245,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3162.769,3164.516,Which is certainly possible.
1982.81-2245,3,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3164.516,3167.171,"--Well, and perhaps I didn't express myself very well there."
1982.81-2245,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3179.135,3187.663,"Then you went on and said, we may reallocate our water right, and if the landowners have any beef, they can come and try to get paid."
1982.81-2245,3,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3189.133,3200.785,"--But the reallocation point, though, we relied upon to reinforce the conclusion that the decree didn't go further, that the private defendants in the lawsuit are permitted to reallocate their water."
1982.81-2245,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3204.658,3207.125,I thought what I suggested was your opening argument.
1982.81-2245,3,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3207.125,3214.574,"Well, we... it may well be that the United States could go further and without any... and do--"
1982.81-2245,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3214.574,3215.731,As you did.
1982.81-2245,3,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3215.731,3217.01,--Well--
1982.81-2245,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3217.01,3219.042,"Well, you may be right."
1982.81-2245,3,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3219.947,3226.771,"--We may be, but it is not necessary to go that far in this case, because all this case involves is the question of res judicata, which depends on the decree."
1982.81-2245,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3280.44,3286.294,"Mr. Kneedler, is there a federal rule of res judicata that should apply in this case, or does it depend on the law of the state of Nevada?"
1982.81-2245,3,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3286.294,3294.384,We would submit that there would be a federal rule of res judicata because the rights being asserted here were federal rights.
1982.81-2245,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3294.384,3296.057,How about Allen against McCurry?
1982.81-2245,3,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3301.178,3303.147,"Well, this is a suit brought in federal court, though, so--"
1982.81-2245,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3303.147,3304.508,"Well, so was that."
1982.81-2245,3,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3312.393,3329.043,"--Offhand I do not, but I would think ordinarily that the... there might be a separate question of whether federal law would adopt state law, but ordinarily I would think in a federal suit brought by the United States to declare federal water rights that there would be a federal rule of res judicata."
1982.81-2245,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3425.365,3427.174,"Do you have anything further, Mr. Prettyman?"
1982.81-2245,4,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,3427.174,3429.44,"Just a few points, Mr. Chief Justice."
1982.81-2245,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3479.53,3486.354,Could you take water... Where is the dam that--
1982.81-2245,4,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,3486.354,3490.495,"Derby Dam, Your Honor, is... after it leaves what we call the Meadows--"
1982.81-2245,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3490.495,3490.916,--Yes.
1982.81-2245,4,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,3490.916,3496.039,"--which is where most of the farmers are located other than Newlands, it goes down the river."
1982.81-2245,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3506.44,3510.593,But the dam is above the split.
1982.81-2245,4,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,3510.593,3512.204,The dam is at the split.
1982.81-2245,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3512.204,3512.968,Is at the split?
1982.81-2245,4,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,3512.968,3513.767,"Yes, sir."
1982.81-2245,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3513.767,3517.546,But you could water... you could bring water to the reservation from behind the dam?
1982.81-2245,4,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,3517.546,3519.64,"Yes, you--"
1982.81-2245,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3519.64,3523.075,And that water that is stored is available to the... physically available.
1982.81-2245,4,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,3523.075,3523.403,--Yes.
1982.81-2245,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3570.229,3571.025,"Thank you, gentlemen."
