1968.10,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,36.271,"Number 10, WHYY, Inc., Appellant versus Borough of Glassboro, et al."
1968.10,0,31810,james_m_marsh,,38.41,39.679,May it please the Court.
1968.10,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,274.193,276.239,This is a real property tax?
1968.10,0,31810,james_m_marsh,,276.239,284.983,It's partly real property and partly personal property and all the realty in New Jersey plus the site and everything that's in it as I understand.
1968.10,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,284.983,286.047,"The land, the buildings, --"
1968.10,0,31810,james_m_marsh,,286.047,286.67,"The land, the buildings, --"
1968.10,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,286.67,287.338,And the content?
1968.10,0,31810,james_m_marsh,,287.338,289.62,"The equipment, yes sir."
1968.10,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,304.918,309.049,You have no quarrel with this amended statute.
1968.10,0,31810,james_m_marsh,,309.049,318.235,"No sir, we're happy with the amended statute and we were saying we have it retroactive or take some other remedial action but strictly prospect on operation."
1968.10,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,517.197,527.76,"Mr. Marsh, I understand when you say that you're perfectly satisfied with the new law as it stands in the present time so far as two or three years."
1968.10,0,31810,james_m_marsh,,527.76,530.042,"For future years, we are exempt, as I understand."
1968.10,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,530.042,530.954,I beg your pardon.
1968.10,0,31810,james_m_marsh,,530.954,531.447,"Yes, for future years --"
1968.10,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,531.447,532.914,So you're satisfied with that.
1968.10,0,31810,james_m_marsh,,546.79,553.16,The question of the technical compliance with the New Jersey statute was not decided by Supreme Court in New Jersey.
1968.10,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,553.16,554.939,"No, I didn't ask you that."
1968.10,0,31810,james_m_marsh,,569.687,570.319,"Yes, Your Honor."
1968.10,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,570.319,570.827,You would.
1968.10,0,31810,james_m_marsh,,570.827,574.602,It all requires as a nonprofit educational television station.
1968.10,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,576.145,577.234,"Yes, so --"
1968.10,0,31810,james_m_marsh,,577.234,584.914,There will be no prob -- this law had been on the books when this case came up I think even the Supreme Court of New Jersey would have grant us an exemption.
1968.10,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,612.457,620.651,Do you consider this new legislation as overruling the Supreme Court of New Jersey in your case?
1968.10,0,31810,james_m_marsh,,620.651,631.149,"I would like to view it that way but I don't -- it's hard to say what, for one legislature to decide what other legislature meant where they correcting it or where they changing it."
1968.10,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,644.503,644.92,I see.
1968.10,0,31810,james_m_marsh,,644.92,652.157,"And we have no way of knowing but we certainly feel that had this law been affected at that time, there was no doubt about our exemption."
1968.10,1,33216,john_w_trimble,,702.987,704.858,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1968.10,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,704.858,714.851,"Before you begin, I noticed that the Attorney General was in this case in the Superior Court and New Jersey Supreme Court, am I correct that the Attorney General is not here?"
1968.10,1,33216,john_w_trimble,,714.851,718.312,"The Attorney General, Your Honor was never in this matter."
1968.10,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,737.469,747.834,"-- my problem of course, my personal problem, my son is an Attorney General and I just like to be sure whether I'm qualified -- disqualified?"
1968.10,1,33216,john_w_trimble,,747.834,756.978,"Well, they have entered their appearance for the State of New Jersey but they've only entered a statement in lieu of a brief."
1968.10,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,987.775,988.43,Where's that follows?
1968.10,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,988.43,990.567,What does the new Act do precisely?
1968.10,1,33216,john_w_trimble,,990.567,1003.169,The new Act simply says that nonprofit corporations whether they be domestic or foreign or exempt under I think the new citation is 3.6 (a) or something.
1968.10,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1093.877,1097.11,Have they raised up petition for certification?
1968.10,1,33216,john_w_trimble,,1097.11,1124.536,"I believe it was on an appeal, a direct appeal but for the first time raised a federal issue at which time the Attorney General did contact me and suggested at which I was doing at the time, that I enter a motion to dismiss for failure to raised any federal issue, any constitutional issue up to that point since there was no dissent and the appellate division there was no grounds for an appeal to New Jersey Supreme Court."
1968.10,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1160.481,1168.13,Well on the posture here is that the New Jersey's Supreme Court has decided a federal constitutional question.
1968.10,1,33216,john_w_trimble,,1168.13,1172.801,"Oh, I argue of course that they waived the rule to hear the case."
1968.10,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1172.801,1174.025,"Well, whether, whatever or however?"
1968.10,1,33216,john_w_trimble,,1174.025,1174.259,Right.
1968.10,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1174.259,1175.827,"But they have decided it, have they?"
1968.10,1,33216,john_w_trimble,,1175.827,1183.985,They have decided that the -- the cons -- the statute is constitutional under the constitutional tagged first raised there.
1968.10,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1214.548,1222.846,"Suppose the law had provided that it could not be raised in the law of court -- state law, but have to be raised with the Supreme Court?"
1968.10,1,33216,john_w_trimble,,1222.846,1226.634,"Suppose the law required it, it could not be raised below?"
1968.10,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1226.634,1231.457,In the trial court but had to be raised in the appellate court.
1968.10,1,33216,john_w_trimble,,1231.457,1237.721,"Well, Your Honor, I can't foresee of any type of a rule that said you could not raised a constitutional issue at a trial level."
1968.10,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1237.721,1243.747,-- some courts that are too small they do not want them to pass on constitutional questions.
1968.10,1,33216,john_w_trimble,,1253.944,1261.036,The state Supreme Court did accept the case and acknowledge it and perhaps it was not raised but we want to let hear this case anyhow.
1968.10,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1278.132,1279.797,And then decided what they decided.
1968.10,1,33216,john_w_trimble,,1279.797,1283.706,They decided that as one of the points raised and upheld the --
1968.10,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1283.706,1291.803,"It's the point -- if the constitutionality was determined under the federal constitution and the highest court to which it should go, wasn't it?"
1968.10,1,33216,john_w_trimble,,1291.803,1293.369,"That's true, Your Honor."
1968.10,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1293.369,1313.25,"In our review of state case have we ever said that that the constitutional question must be raised in the lowest court where, it became pertinent or have we merely said that “It is an adequate state ground for not deciding the federal question.”"
1968.10,1,33216,john_w_trimble,,1320.007,1325.107,"Well, I think the latter part of your statement is correct that this court has held it that way that and --"
1968.10,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1325.107,1329.818,That's what I felt.
1968.10,1,33216,john_w_trimble,,1329.818,1339.723,Now the – as we stated the Channel 12 is now exempt from this time on from 68 on we're only arguing about back taxes.
1968.10,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1454.981,1458.328,What's the reason for the last one?
1968.10,1,33216,john_w_trimble,,1458.328,1473.735,"Your Honor, the New Jersey Supreme Court handled that problem briefly and I do not say that the statements they made is the end of the reasons that might be put forth on why you should be incorporated in New Jersey to --"
1968.10,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1473.735,1478.178,I thought you might have a better one.
1968.10,1,33216,john_w_trimble,,1478.178,1487.75,For instance and of course this is all we're trying to fathom what the legislature had in mind some 25 years ago when they enacted this situation.
1968.10,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1547.161,1550.975,Can you put the tax on?
1968.10,1,33216,john_w_trimble,,1550.975,1560.061,"We asked them to incorporate, if they had incorporated and follow the law for some reason on benounce to me a very simple procedure."
1968.10,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1629.082,1646.233,"Do I understand you to say that unless there is a (Inaudible), do you think of some statute will at least justify the statute?"
1968.10,1,33216,john_w_trimble,,1646.233,1660.022,"I feel in the surface of it, it appears that it does discriminate against a foreign corporation as compared to a local corporation basically on the balance that --on the grounds that they did not incorporate in the State of New Jersey."
1968.10,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1660.022,1666.055,(Inaudible)
1968.10,1,33216,john_w_trimble,,1666.055,1683.317,"I haven't raised that point and I think they are, I don't think there is any question that the – if you're alluding to the problem of whether corporations are allowed to raise the Equal Protection Clause as not being a person."
1968.10,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1699.083,1714.413,"Does the amended statute a repeal of the New Jersey Supreme Court decision or is it a clarification of the Act, the original Act."
1968.10,1,33216,john_w_trimble,,1714.413,1723.063,"It's a repeal effective January 1, 1968 of the New Jersey decision in this matter."
1968.10,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1723.063,1731.257,How do you make the differentiation as to whether it was repeal or barely clarification of it?
1968.10,1,33216,john_w_trimble,,1731.257,1748.819,"Well, the language of it as its set forth that it's clearly aimed, of course, the information I have and the knowledge I have of this matter is without the record, and that it wouldn't be fair to bring out why I feel that this is clearly meant to repeal it."
1968.10,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1786.942,1801.63,"I thought Mr. Trimble that Mr. Marsh conceded that this new legislation didn't overrule the Supreme Court decision for the years to which that decision apply, but simply amended the statute to provide the exemption for the future."
1968.10,1,33216,john_w_trimble,,1801.63,1801.971,Yes.
1968.10,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1801.971,1802.966,I ceded that.
1968.10,1,33216,john_w_trimble,,1802.966,1809.34,"He did but I think the Chief Justice's question was “What was the background of this, whether it was a clarification or repeal?”"
1968.10,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1896.359,1905.423,"Well, but you're not suggesting are you that exemptions are not subject to constitutional restraints?"
1968.10,1,33216,john_w_trimble,,1905.423,1908.944,"Exemptions for nonprofit corporations, I think that they should be --"
1968.10,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1908.944,1910.647,Tax exemptions generally are.
1968.10,1,33216,john_w_trimble,,1910.647,1912.937,I think they should be --
1968.10,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1912.937,1920.948,"Are the states are free to discriminate for example in the granting exemptions, without regard to the federal constitutional restraint?"
1968.10,1,33216,john_w_trimble,,1920.948,1936.107,"Well, I think that it should be reviewable but I don't think in the same light Your Honor, as a profit corporation New Jersey could very well become the maker of nonprofit corporations without the state putting any type of guidelines on what they have to do to get in here."
1968.10,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1982.1,1996.231,So you have an agency or an officer in New Jersey who is responsible for supervising the nonprofit corporations as they do in some states.
1968.10,1,33216,john_w_trimble,,2006.589,2012.463,"Well, I'm sure that the Attorney General's office has some type of control but for taxing purposes --"
1968.10,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2012.463,2013.466,I don't mean for tax.
1968.10,1,33216,john_w_trimble,,2013.466,2013.748,Tax?
1968.10,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2014.987,2031.631,"Yes, to determine, for instance to determine whether they are actually carrying out their educational activities or whether they're using it as a cover-up for something else."
1968.10,1,33216,john_w_trimble,,2031.631,2033.882,I don't know whether I could give a direct answer to that.
1968.10,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2033.882,2034.917,"Well, I don't think --"
1968.10,1,33216,john_w_trimble,,2034.917,2041.887,I don't think unless there was a complaint lies against someone that was circumventing the nonprofit status.
1968.10,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2070.547,2078.714,"I think the order of our argument is that you complete you're argument now, and Mr. Marsh then conclude his."
1968.10,1,33216,john_w_trimble,,2078.714,2082.358,Thank you.
1968.10,2,31810,james_m_marsh,,2229.098,2229.873,May I please the Court.
1968.10,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2229.873,2230.153,Mr. Marsh.
1968.10,2,31810,james_m_marsh,,2230.153,2232.048,Just to clarify a few matters.
1968.10,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2272.052,2277.858,"Well, i thought you say Mr. Marsh that the new statute had no retroactive application that's why you didn't --"
1968.10,2,31810,james_m_marsh,,2277.858,2282.817,"No, it does not but as far as Davis passage in this relation, the Supreme Court of New Jersey decision had none --"
1968.10,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2282.817,2285.0,Intervene in the Superior Court and the Supreme Court?
1968.10,2,31810,james_m_marsh,,2285.0,2288.267,"Yes, it intervened between any Superior Court's decision and the Supreme Court's decision."
