1978.78_orig,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,64.768,"We'll hear arguments next in number 78 Original, State of California against Arizona and the United States."
1978.78_orig,0,16111,allan_goodman,,67.559,71.049,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1978.78_orig,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,125.237,131.874,Is it agreed Mr. Goodman that lands in question here are within the political boundaries of California?
1978.78_orig,0,16111,allan_goodman,,131.874,154.647,"Mr. Justice Blackmun some of the lands are within California entirely, some of the lands like a stride of the interstate border the 8.6 mile southern reach of the river, it has the political border running approximately through the center, but just approximately it does vary, but the political boundary will not change as a result of this litigation, it will remain the same."
1978.78_orig,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,181.918,187.415,"But there's no question I gather Mr. Goodman as to the definition of the lands in dispute, is it?"
1978.78_orig,0,16111,allan_goodman,,194.109,205.068,"We have put them on generally, one of the disputes maybe over which riverbed is an issue here there were several main channels of the Colorado River at different times."
1978.78_orig,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,205.068,207.544,And that have changed the boundaries of the lands and disputes?
1978.78_orig,0,16111,allan_goodman,,207.544,211.596,That would make a substantial difference is to where the sovereign lands were located.
1978.78_orig,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,252.46,253.542,"We don't have them here, do we?"
1978.78_orig,0,16111,allan_goodman,,253.542,255.514,They're not part of the record in the action.
1978.78_orig,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,260.974,262.811,"I see, it doesn't help me too much."
1978.78_orig,0,16111,allan_goodman,,262.811,269.665,"It doesn't help me too much either [Attempt to Laughter] Your Honor, it requires some elaboration."
1978.78_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,269.665,272.494,"These are questions of title not boundary, right?"
1978.78_orig,0,16111,allan_goodman,,272.494,277.811,"That is correct Your Honor, these are questions of title."
1978.78_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,286.822,291.055,"But you're asking, you want your title quited (ph)?"
1978.78_orig,0,16111,allan_goodman,,291.055,294.722,That's correct Mr. Justice White.
1978.78_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,294.722,300.032,Usually to acquire a title you say what property you're acquiring title to?
1978.78_orig,0,16111,allan_goodman,,300.032,302.177,We have done that in the exhibit to the complaint Your Honor.
1978.78_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,305.761,319.346,"I know, but suppose the defendants say that you haven't described the lands correctly?"
1978.78_orig,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,319.346,327.125,Depending upon what you've said to me â€“ asked me earlier as to the navigability of 1850 and so forth?
1978.78_orig,0,16111,allan_goodman,,327.125,329.988,"They would have to, they could then respond quite in that manner."
1978.78_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,329.988,339.285,"First of all, what I mean, the question -- I suppose many questions of fact could arise in this case, it's just isn't a question of law and order?"
1978.78_orig,0,16111,allan_goodman,,339.285,342.148,"No, it's not a question of law only Your Honor but --"
1978.78_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,342.148,345.449,That's all I wanted to know --
1978.78_orig,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,345.449,354.403,Your answer to the question of Mr. Justice White which was put in terms of your title and you are representing the State of California.
1978.78_orig,0,16111,allan_goodman,,362.253,366.423,"We're answering solely on behalf of the Sovereign, if I made or began to respond to --"
1978.78_orig,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,366.423,368.395,"Very important difference, isn't it, that you have to keep in mind here."
1978.78_orig,0,16111,allan_goodman,,368.395,370.079,Yes.
1978.78_orig,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,373.22,389.407,"The Sovereign, the tile of the sovereign lands brings us probably a clear original jurisdiction case whereas the title of the individual citizen claimant brings another question, doesn't it?"
1978.78_orig,0,16111,allan_goodman,,389.407,391.808,"Yes, it very well may Your Honor."
1978.78_orig,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,391.808,394.818,"These lands on the Arizona side, are they political boundary?"
1978.78_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,394.818,395.259,No.
1978.78_orig,0,16111,allan_goodman,,395.259,400.363,Some of the lands are on the Arizona side in the 2.6 mile upper reach of the river.
1978.78_orig,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,422.895,427.97,What I was trying to get at I'm afraid I haven't understand it fully yet.
1978.78_orig,0,16111,allan_goodman,,436.7,439.3,We're as far as --
1978.78_orig,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,439.3,440.879,I mean just answer that yes or no.
1978.78_orig,0,16111,allan_goodman,,440.879,442.594,The answer for that is no Your Honor.
1978.78_orig,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,459.896,464.874,"Alright, but what about this land there, do you agree to that?"
1978.78_orig,0,16111,allan_goodman,,464.874,467.119,They simply will not give any -- give us an answer yes or no.
1978.78_orig,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,470.207,473.369,But do you agree with that that is the map of existed?
1978.78_orig,0,16111,allan_goodman,,473.369,479.133,"Well, this is the map adopted by the California State Land's Commission which is the basis for the Exhibit A to our complaint."
1978.78_orig,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,479.133,482.554,"So you don't mind that, do you, you agree to that then?"
1978.78_orig,0,16111,allan_goodman,,482.554,484.219,"Yes, we're quite sure."
1978.78_orig,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,484.219,485.937,What does the government agree with that?
1978.78_orig,0,16111,allan_goodman,,485.937,489.763,I don't know I'm afraid Mr. Justice Marshall that you have to ask this to the Solicitor General.
1978.78_orig,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,494.494,495.723,I agree with my brothers.
1978.78_orig,0,16111,allan_goodman,,514.23,524.047,"Well, I think should the Court grant the motion and appoint a special master then the master would take it, take evidence on the subject and the lands would become fixed."
1978.78_orig,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,528.547,536.493,"For example, you've got a strip the land here that I can understand, but you say you don't know where the strip of land is."
1978.78_orig,0,16111,allan_goodman,,536.493,539.889,No Your Honor California knows where the strip of land is.
1978.78_orig,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,539.889,541.766,You say you know where you think it is?
1978.78_orig,0,16111,allan_goodman,,541.766,543.849,"Well, we know where the land is."
1978.78_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,562.657,569.267,"Well, your meats and bounds description will vary from Arizona to California because they use different meridians."
1978.78_orig,0,16111,allan_goodman,,569.267,572.758,We've accounted for that Your Honor in the description.
1978.78_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,574.917,576.294,San Bernardino Basin Meridian.
1978.78_orig,0,16111,allan_goodman,,576.294,577.861,"That's exactly correct, Your Honor."
1978.78_orig,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,618.454,623.297,Unless the presence of the United States causes the controversy really doesn't overlook?
1978.78_orig,0,16111,allan_goodman,,623.297,634.692,"Your Honor I don't think so, because as this Court said, albeit indicted United States versus Nevada."
1978.78_orig,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,706.792,709.011,Are you suggesting that --
1978.78_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,709.011,719.924,Are you suggesting that it is because of the Constitution that Arizona and California may not litigate in the District Court even if both of them consent?
1978.78_orig,0,16111,allan_goodman,,719.924,721.702,No Mr. Justice White --
1978.78_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,721.702,725.055,Is it just because of the statute of Section 1251?
1978.78_orig,0,16111,allan_goodman,,725.055,736.762,"I recognize that early on this Court held that the Clause 2 of Article 3 Section 2 did not preclude suits between states and lower courts, but the Congress in the first judiciary act --"
1978.78_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,736.762,737.121,Yes.
1978.78_orig,0,16111,allan_goodman,,737.121,753.312,"Continued to this day provided that until 1948 it was, if the suit - if any State were a party after 48 if the controversy were between two states that this Court had exclusive as well as original jurisdiction."
1978.78_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,766.291,773.266,"Well, what you do with 1346(f) then, it says that District Courts have exclusive jurisdiction."
1978.78_orig,0,16111,allan_goodman,,773.266,779.094,"Mr. Justice Rehnquist, the answer to that lies in the legislative history of Section 1346(f)."
1978.78_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,835.877,858.535,Certainly your answer doesn't comport with the use of the terms in Section 28 USC 1251 with the Judiciary Act of 1789 where the Congress said the Supreme Court shall have original and exclusive jurisdiction of where it was talking about this Court as opposed to lower Federal Courts.
1978.78_orig,0,16111,allan_goodman,,858.535,869.602,"I think the term exclusive are used in two different respects Mr. Justice Rehnquist, in 1346(f) the sole purpose of the term is to preclude suits in State Courts and that's worn out by the legislative history."
1978.78_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,904.964,910.907,You say as a matter of prudence we ought to construe it that way even though there is some doubt in order to avoid the Constitution.
1978.78_orig,0,16111,allan_goodman,,910.907,920.042,"Exactly, in order to avoid the unconstitutional construction, the legislative history should be relied upon to confer to construe 1346(f) constitutionally."
1978.78_orig,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,920.042,922.983,Mr. Goodman if we should deny leave to file.
1978.78_orig,0,16111,allan_goodman,,925.842,933.323,"Mr. Justice Blackmun, I don't think we have any remedy then, we have no other form in which we can litigate both against the United States and against Arizona."
1978.78_orig,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,933.323,942.594,"Well, you certainly could sue the United States alone and California Federal Court, I take it and would Arizona commend then?"
1978.78_orig,0,16111,allan_goodman,,942.594,950.227,"By our understanding of the jurisdiction provision Your Honor, under Article 3, we could not sue both Arizona and the United States in District Court, there is no statute --"
1978.78_orig,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,950.227,953.183,That was my question.
1978.78_orig,0,16111,allan_goodman,,960.627,981.158,"It has said that it would consent, but my first argument is Your Honor that Arizona doesn't have the power to consent, because number 1, Article 3 Section 2 clauses 1 and 2 do not permit and Section 1251A1 provides this Court shall have exclusive jurisdiction in actions between the states to say, also to say --"
1978.78_orig,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,981.158,987.268,"Well, that's an argument that there would just be no jurisdiction in the District Court though Congress has said there shall not be."
1978.78_orig,0,16111,allan_goodman,,987.268,989.645,That's exactly correct Mr. Justice Brennan.
1978.78_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,989.645,993.961,"Then you could also sue, could you sue Arizona alone in this Court?"
1978.78_orig,0,16111,allan_goodman,,993.961,997.304,We could sue if the Court granted leave Arizona alone in this Court.
1978.78_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1005.537,1010.77,Could the government commend here optionally?
1978.78_orig,0,16111,allan_goodman,,1010.77,1017.758,"Well, they have suggested as much and that would be fine with us."
1978.78_orig,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1017.758,1019.663,But only as the part of the land.
1978.78_orig,0,16111,allan_goodman,,1019.663,1024.66,"And that's exactly the problem Mr. Justice Brennan, because we feel the entire area has to be adjudicated."
1978.78_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1024.66,1033.992,"What the government says is if we take it here someday they all come in, but limited only to a given segment, is that it?"
1978.78_orig,0,16111,allan_goodman,,1033.992,1035.9,That's my understanding of this Mr. General's brief Your Honor.
1978.78_orig,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1035.9,1042.579,I think you should cover everything with simultaneous suits here and in California Federal Court.
1978.78_orig,0,16111,allan_goodman,,1042.579,1052.594,"Mr. Justice Blackmun, we would not have one judgment binding on all the parties if we try to do that and that's our problem, we had two separate judgments."
1978.78_orig,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1104.39,1112.215,What you would be able to do is bring in this Court both the State and United States as to all the lands and disputes.
1978.78_orig,0,16111,allan_goodman,,1112.215,1115.968,We want to do it in one action so that we can have one enforceable judgment.
1978.78_orig,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1165.822,1178.423,"We'll resume there at 1 o'clock, the council."
1978.78_orig,0,16111,allan_goodman,,1181.926,1185.339,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court that is correct.
1978.78_orig,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1185.339,1186.19,"Yeah, thank you."
1978.78_orig,0,16111,allan_goodman,,1186.19,1187.614,You're very welcome Mr. Justice Brennan.
1978.78_orig,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1187.614,1191.275,"At some point, someone will explain the map."
1978.78_orig,0,16111,allan_goodman,,1191.275,1198.149,"Very well Your Honor, the clerk's office was kind enough to make copies of them during the lunch-recess."
1978.78_orig,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1278.535,1282.551,Now what's the segment that the government says that might be willing to consume?
1978.78_orig,0,16111,allan_goodman,,1282.551,1291.702,"Mr. Justice Brennan, it's the upper segment it's the North of -- the Court will see the pilot channel on the Palo Verde Lagoon that area to the north is a segment."
1978.78_orig,0,16111,allan_goodman,,1297.897,1301.191,"It's up above that right, right there."
1978.78_orig,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1353.543,1360.004,Do you mean this by the -- I mean you don't mean by the -- by the Constitution.
1978.78_orig,0,16111,allan_goodman,,1360.004,1363.957,"Yes in response to earlier question I answered that, I didn't mean to --"
1978.78_orig,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1363.957,1369.889,"Because Congress said that two states could litigate in the District Court, they could."
1978.78_orig,0,16111,allan_goodman,,1369.889,1370.398,That's correct.
1978.78_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1410.163,1416.284,"Mr. Goodman, I would just love to take up the time of the rest of the Court."
1978.78_orig,0,16111,allan_goodman,,1428.786,1434.648,"In our request for continuing jurisdiction Mr. Justice Rehnquist, we do ask the Court to decide that question."
1978.78_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1445.045,1445.41,Yes.
1978.78_orig,0,16111,allan_goodman,,1445.41,1452.333,Along the border this dispute is south of blithe.
1978.78_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1465.006,1474.315,My concern was familiarity from expert testimony as to factual matters not with the legal matter.
1978.78_orig,0,16111,allan_goodman,,1474.315,1483.942,"This case is extremely significant since Pollard's Lessee v. Hagan, it's been clear that question to the sovereign lands adjudication is appropriate for this Court's decision."
1978.78_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1509.583,1512.293,"Well, as the United States an indispensable party here."
1978.78_orig,0,16111,allan_goodman,,1512.293,1513.581,How are they?
1978.78_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1513.581,1514.077,Are they?
1978.78_orig,0,16111,allan_goodman,,1514.077,1523.349,"Yes, Your Honor we think that we cannot litigate the question of the central line without having the United States because it is the owner of the upland."
1978.78_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1523.349,1529.995,And the United States position is that you shouldn't be able to get into any court.
1978.78_orig,0,16111,allan_goodman,,1529.995,1537.202,"I think the technical strict reading would be yes, they say that they would intervene in this Court."
1978.78_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1537.202,1539.356,But they say that they haven't given concern.
1978.78_orig,0,16111,allan_goodman,,1539.356,1540.195,That's correct.
1978.78_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1540.195,1547.28,And they say that you are not subject to Arizona and you can't litigate in the District Court.
1978.78_orig,0,16111,allan_goodman,,1547.28,1548.081,That's correct.
1978.78_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1548.081,1550.194,So there is no judicial.
1978.78_orig,0,16111,allan_goodman,,1550.194,1555.246,Our position on that Your Honor was 1346 F is being read by the United States to deny the purpose.
1978.78_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1555.246,1555.779,I understand.
1978.78_orig,0,16111,allan_goodman,,1555.779,1558.818,Okay. I thank the Court very much.

1978.78_orig,1,34304,louis_claiborne,,1563.015,1566.664,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1978.78_orig,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1732.934,1755.863,"The situation being Mr. Claiborne, if there were not problem between the two states which you had private action require title, private on either one side or the other, but with Federal riparian rights involved, where the Federal Government just intervene in that private action?"
1978.78_orig,1,34304,louis_claiborne,,1755.863,1769.763,"Mr. Chief Justice, the private parties could by Virtue of 2409(a) sue the United States, sovereign immunity having been waived by the Congress in the appropriate District Court and there would have been no problem or whatever."
1978.78_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1782.571,1795.157,"Would Arizona be an indispensable party if California sued the United States in the District Court, which it could?"
1978.78_orig,1,34304,louis_claiborne,,1795.157,1801.782,"Mr. Justice White, I would have thought for the same reasons that the United States is an indispensable party, so would Arizona."
1978.78_orig,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1814.611,1821.773,"Mr. Claiborne, jury 2409(a) has waiving sovereign immunity only for suits in the District Court?"
1978.78_orig,1,34304,louis_claiborne,,1821.773,1845.001,"2409(a) itself, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, of course does not say that, but at the very time when that statute was written Section 1346 of the judicial court was amended by the same legislation, so as to provide that suits under 2409(a) shall be within the exclusive jurisdiction of the District Courts."
1978.78_orig,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1889.36,1899.635,"But if you read exclusive in 1346 as meaning exclusive of this Court, there are, to put mildly, grave constitutional difficulties, are they or not?"
1978.78_orig,1,34304,louis_claiborne,,1899.635,1902.397,I would have thought not Mr. Justice Rehnquist.
1978.78_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1942.445,1949.16,What is the basis for your saying that the United States is indispensable party in this case?
1978.78_orig,1,34304,louis_claiborne,,1949.16,1967.943,"Mr. Justice White, for the same reason that California has joined this is in the first place that the location and width of the bed which is half of which they claim in the old bed of the Colorado River affects Federal lands on either side of that area."
1978.78_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1972.897,1981.311,Why can't California and Arizona settle their dispute in litigation without having the United States around?
1978.78_orig,1,34304,louis_claiborne,,1981.311,1984.766,"Well, Mr. Justice White the first problem is where they would do that."
1978.78_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1984.766,1987.196,"Well, they do it here?"
1978.78_orig,1,34304,louis_claiborne,,1987.196,1994.812,The United States is willing to facilitate matters at least in part by intervening so as to make that possible.
1978.78_orig,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2004.92,2010.112,And that's why the United State submits to this North of the.
1978.78_orig,1,34304,louis_claiborne,,2010.112,2023.222,"I would make that more clear than it's just been, north of this pilot cut junction, which is the smaller distance to the North on the map, the 2.7 miles I believe it is."
1978.78_orig,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2082.69,2095.987,Do you think the -- what authority do you need to submit to an adjudication in this Court to settle this title?
1978.78_orig,1,34304,louis_claiborne,,2099.663,2108.853,At least whether the matters have been litigated or not I'm not aware Mr. Justice White but it's always be fought the attorney general and solicitor general had authority toâ€¦
1978.78_orig,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2108.853,2114.845,Himself to way by becoming plaintiff and to do that by intervention.
1978.78_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2114.845,2127.063,"Maybe becoming plaintiff, but he just, he wouldn't have authority just to not raise your sovereign immunity defense here as a party defendant."
1978.78_orig,1,34304,louis_claiborne,,2127.063,2132.193,It might come to the same thing Mr. Justice White it's always been fought proper to do by informally --
1978.78_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2132.193,2137.435,So what is the limitation that you would insist on this Court to become a third party to this case?
1978.78_orig,1,34304,louis_claiborne,,2138.589,2158.301,"Only that we would limit the controversy to that portion of the land South of the pilot cut that is to say the 8.6 miles as shown on this plan, on the ground that the Federal title North of that has been established by the survey."
1978.78_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2159.736,2168.317,Or it just are there some -- are there some legal principles involved in this case or is it all just a factual fake?
1978.78_orig,1,34304,louis_claiborne,,2168.317,2174.868,"Mr. Justice White, it's difficult to know what's involved in the case at this stage of course --"
1978.78_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2174.868,2182.218,If it's there is a major if the major part of its legal principle would be settled by litigating the segment south of the pilot cut.
1978.78_orig,1,34304,louis_claiborne,,2182.218,2185.299,"Well, indeed, Mr. Justice White."
1978.78_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2185.299,2195.954,Is that clear if you were allowed to come in only as to that lower segment what then is the status of title as to that Northern segment?
1978.78_orig,1,34304,louis_claiborne,,2195.954,2197.965,There is -- there remains a difficulty at California --
1978.78_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2197.965,2200.793,But then how are we ever going to solve the outsider with those views?
1978.78_orig,1,34304,louis_claiborne,,2200.793,2206.841,I regret to say that the result as I see that the United States being indispensable as to whole of the area.
1978.78_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2251.856,2255.168,Whose rule State or Federal?
1978.78_orig,1,34304,louis_claiborne,,2255.168,2258.272,I think in this instance they're common Mr. Justice White.
1978.78_orig,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2258.272,2274.978,"Mr. Claiborne, if you are right as the indispensable parties within the logic of your position require that we dismiss the case as between the States even though you don't make any intervention at all?"
1978.78_orig,1,34304,louis_claiborne,,2274.978,2288.265,"There is precedent Mr. Justice Rehnquist for this granting leave subject to an undertaking by the United States, which I now give to intervene within a specific period of time so as to allow the suit to go forward."
1978.78_orig,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2288.265,2294.565,"Well, let me ask you this supposing if the United States is sued in the Supreme Court of Los Angeles County to acquire title."
1978.78_orig,1,34304,louis_claiborne,,2304.142,2313.811,No Mr. Justice Rehnquist I think he would properly be instructed to oppose or simply to plaintiff to make no appearance.
1978.78_orig,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2313.811,2319.843,Do you think the attorney general can give leave to be sued in the Supreme Court of Los Angeles County?
1978.78_orig,1,34304,louis_claiborne,,2319.843,2324.23,I think he can by way of intervention certainly if there were jurisdiction --
1978.78_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2324.23,2325.003,The State Court.
1978.78_orig,1,34304,louis_claiborne,,2325.003,2326.425,If there were jurisdiction otherwise?
1978.78_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2326.425,2331.207,"Yeah, I know, but I thought what you said earlier, I forget these numbers."
1978.78_orig,1,34304,louis_claiborne,,2333.004,2342.479,"Well, I'm perhaps was indulging of on assumption hypothetical that I shouldn't have the answer of course is yes Mr. Justice Brennan."
1978.78_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2365.665,2376.636,"Really, I would take it the suit in a State Court of Attorney General went in said sure, here we are service, sue us and he got a judgment against the United States still went very good."
1978.78_orig,1,34304,louis_claiborne,,2376.636,2383.51,"It might be more respectful to the Court, Mr. Justice Brennan to appear for the purpose of opposing --"
1978.78_orig,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2383.51,2393.273,"It would good until this Court or perhaps Court of Appeals got hold of it and said there was not jurisdiction, but officially it would be a valid judgment?"
1978.78_orig,1,34304,louis_claiborne,,2393.273,2396.588,"Indeed, Mr. Chief Justice and it would be wasteful of judicial resource."
1978.78_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2396.588,2407.402,And suppose we have raised file subject to the United States meaning that the United States intervene within whatever reservations within that reservation.
1978.78_orig,1,34304,louis_claiborne,,2407.402,2408.608,Safe thing to do.
1978.78_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2408.608,2419.846,"There was an adjudication which settled the title to some particular land say the land South of this cut, I would suppose you would think the land with the title would be settled there then."
1978.78_orig,1,34304,louis_claiborne,,2419.846,2420.878,There is got to be a --
1978.78_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2420.878,2424.137,If you intervene then submitted with respect to.
1978.78_orig,1,34304,louis_claiborne,,2424.137,2425.168,Exactly so.
1978.78_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2425.168,2445.981,"Well, then what becomes of the suggestion that that title to land in a suit against the United States or involving the United States is within the exclusive jurisdiction of the District Court. Can you waive that too or --?"
1978.78_orig,1,34304,louis_claiborne,,2445.981,2455.107,Mr. Justice White I don't think 1346 therefore to be read in saying that the government's title can only be tried in a District Court.
1978.78_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2462.887,2465.9,There is the exclusive jurisdiction now.
1978.78_orig,1,34304,louis_claiborne,,2465.9,2470.183,"Indeed and I can get around those words, but I don't."
1978.78_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2470.183,2473.001,It certainly deprives the State Courts of jurisdiction doesn't it?
1978.78_orig,1,34304,louis_claiborne,,2473.001,2475.815,But this would not know Mr. Justice White.
1978.78_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2475.815,2482.816,"You think it deprives the State Court of Jurisdiction, but not this Court to adjudicate the title to the United States."
1978.78_orig,1,34304,louis_claiborne,,2482.816,2493.096,"I don't think 1346 deprives the State Court any more than, it's only suits under 2409 that limited to the District Court."
1978.78_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2575.727,2579.894,Mr. Claiborne before you sit down it just one thing I did not understand.
1978.78_orig,1,34304,louis_claiborne,,2599.958,2615.018,"Because an action in which the United States is plaintiff or intervener is not an action which is governed by 2409, 2409 simply waived the statute, when the United State is neither plaintiff nor intervener."
1978.78_orig,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2615.018,2624.775,"No, but supposing United States is a defendant as I seek to name them, supposing we held it could be, why couldn't it still be a 2409 action and you still have your 12 year defense."
1978.78_orig,1,34304,louis_claiborne,,2624.775,2647.932,"Well, if the Court Mr. Justice Steven withhold that the United States can be suit in this Court of because 2409 has waived sovereignty of this Court as well as the District Court then the only thing that prevents that is the word exclusive in 1346 (f) and if we construe exclusive is just excludes State Court's jurisdiction had all the problems solved."
1978.78_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2652.36,2655.862,"And also with respect to your 12 year defense, you still fit a certainty."
1978.78_orig,1,34304,louis_claiborne,,2655.862,2664.763,I may say that we can think of no good reason while the government ought to be subject to suit on its title in a District Court and not in this Court.
1978.78_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2694.714,2697.727,The only problem is the world exclusive in 1346 (f).
1978.78_orig,1,34304,louis_claiborne,,2697.727,2698.672,That is entirely right.
1978.78_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2698.672,2702.148,Okay.
1978.78_orig,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2702.148,2709.293,"Mr. Goodman, excuse me, yes Mr. Kolsurd."
1978.78_orig,2,39695,russell_kolsrud,,2709.293,2713.082,Yes Mr. Chief Justice may it please the Court.
1978.78_orig,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2901.716,2904.249,I am not clear what do you mean discretion.
1978.78_orig,2,39695,russell_kolsrud,,2904.249,2918.146,"Discretion to here I think that the word were that this Court would exercise its original jurisdiction only in appropriate cases, so the question is, is this an appropriate case?"
1978.78_orig,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2918.146,2928.447,"But it wasn't the intimation in Arizona versus the New Mexico that it wasn't appropriate because the State really it wasn't representing its own interest, but rather the interest of a private plaintiff."
1978.78_orig,2,39695,russell_kolsrud,,2928.447,2958.182,"That was one aspect of the case, the concurring opinion of Mr. Justice Stevens indicated that, however I think the Court's primarily concern was that Arizona was actually the issues presented by Arizona were actually being tried in a separate lawsuit in New Mexico by sort of a project and other private citizens, although Arizona was not involved in that case, the issues themselves were being adjudicated in New Mexico."
1978.78_orig,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2987.591,2989.879,It doesn't call for boundary dispute.
1978.78_orig,2,39695,russell_kolsrud,,2989.879,3000.427,"It's not a boundary dispute at all as a matter of fact it's merely a question of who owns, where do you draw the lines between two land owners in California, it's factual."
1978.78_orig,3,16111,allan_goodman,,3858.759,3861.582,Mr. Chief Justice may it please the Court.
1978.78_orig,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4019.184,4021.379,And not by Finally --
1978.78_orig,3,16111,allan_goodman,,4021.379,4025.614,"Finally, Your Honor we think it doesn't exist after Corvallis."
1978.78_orig,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4025.614,4027.012,I know but how about Corvallis.
1978.78_orig,3,16111,allan_goodman,,4027.012,4046.278,"That's exact, thank you Honor I was just with respect to Mr. Justice Rehnquist's opinion for the Court in Corvallis, this land near to the state under the equal shooting doctrine by virtue of our sovereignty and thus it is a Constitution which should determine what rights arise and how those rights are decided as to that federal land."
1978.78_orig,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4049.686,4053.55,Do you mean the choice of Laws of Constitutional question?
1978.78_orig,3,16111,allan_goodman,,4053.55,4054.171,That's right.
1978.78_orig,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4054.171,4057.848,But what if you decide the State Law decide to govern.
1978.78_orig,3,16111,allan_goodman,,4057.848,4061.401,I think Mr. Justice White in this case State Law may have.
1978.78_orig,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4061.401,4062.878,"Entirely, the entire controversy."
1978.78_orig,3,16111,allan_goodman,,4062.878,4099.062,"Yes, may govern the entire controversy, the question, the next question that comes is was the affect of the source of the States Law, source of the grant upon the United States contention of 1346 -- can the Congress affect or change the grant, excuse me, can a grant of -- can the inuring of the trust land in the states is superseded by a grant, by a Statute of the Congress."
