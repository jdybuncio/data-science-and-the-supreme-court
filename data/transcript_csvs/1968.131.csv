1968.131,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,24.4,"No.131, Carmine Vincent Palmieri versus Florida."
1968.131,0,37935,phillip_goldman,,25.792,29.799,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1968.131,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,124.352,131.481,Are you -- is it your contention that he was arrested without probable cause?
1968.131,0,37935,phillip_goldman,,131.481,137.443,"Your Honor, I don't think there's any doubt when he was arrested without probable cause."
1968.131,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,143.959,145.842,Does the record show what --
1968.131,0,37935,phillip_goldman,,145.842,146.526,The record showed --
1968.131,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,146.526,151.367,"By what information the arresting officers have at the time he was arrested, the time they arrested him?"
1968.131,0,37935,phillip_goldman,,151.367,157.417,That's specifically except that the only evidence they used at the trial was the illegal evidence which they gathered at a later time.
1968.131,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,157.417,158.994,"Well, that's not my question."
1968.131,0,37935,phillip_goldman,,158.994,162.274,"No, sir they have -- the record does not speak as to what they have."
1968.131,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,162.274,178.293,I thought in reading the briefs and without calling them that the record did show that he was arrested only after the victim of the holdup had identified his picture -- as the picture of the man who had held him up.
1968.131,0,37935,phillip_goldman,,178.293,183.161,"Mr. Justice Stewart, if the Court please, this is an argument made by the respondent --"
1968.131,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,183.161,185.265,"Not in term of argument, I'm talking about the facts."
1968.131,0,37935,phillip_goldman,,185.265,200.774,"No, I say this is an argument advanced by that but the record does not reflect that the record reflects on page 15 that they took some photographs of two after the arrest to the prosecuting witness and that he identified one of the photographs."
1968.131,1,27622,howard_mendelow,,1198.167,1201.401,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1968.131,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1223.96,1226.739,I think that's what I understand you to say on page 10 of your brief?
1968.131,1,27622,howard_mendelow,,1226.739,1227.835,"We did, sir."
1968.131,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1227.835,1231.207,Further the victim picked out the petitioner's picture prior to arrest.
1968.131,1,27622,howard_mendelow,,1231.207,1231.968,"Yes, sir."
1968.131,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1235.866,1237.17,What is this about?
1968.131,1,27622,howard_mendelow,,1237.17,1245.637,"The fact is that he did pick out a picture and that is the extent of the record, Your Honor but we feel in our argument we have so stated that the court --"
1968.131,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1245.637,1246.699,Did he pick out a picture?
1968.131,1,27622,howard_mendelow,,1246.699,1252.112,A picture but it does not designate that he picked out a picture of the petitioner in this matter.
1968.131,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1252.112,1256.768,"You mean, what you're telling us now is that the picture he picked out was someone other than --"
1968.131,1,27622,howard_mendelow,,1256.768,1257.585,We do not know sir.
1968.131,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1257.585,1258.239,"Oh, I see."
1968.131,1,27622,howard_mendelow,,1258.239,1261.172,The record is not clear and it does not --
1968.131,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1261.172,1271.755,"The record simply doesn't show any -- am I right in my understanding that in no time, has there been any plain that the arrest was illegal?"
1968.131,1,27622,howard_mendelow,,1271.755,1283.887,"That is correct, Mr. Justice Stewart and in no time was it raised on direct appeal and at no time was it raised on petitioner -- on the certified question accommodating the petitioner for writ of certiorari in the Florida Supreme Court."
1968.131,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1283.887,1290.097,"So, for that reason there was no canvassing of the issue as to what probable cause there might have been or other than --"
1968.131,1,27622,howard_mendelow,,1290.097,1291.035,Other than what is reflected in the record per se.
1968.131,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1291.035,1294.992,-- by with respect to the knowledge of arresting officer.
1968.131,1,27622,howard_mendelow,,1294.992,1298.465,Other than what is reflected in the record per se.
1968.131,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1306.339,1309.507,"Mr. Mendelow, what was the charge with when he was arrested?"
1968.131,1,27622,howard_mendelow,,1309.507,1311.489,(Voice Overlap) He was charged --
1968.131,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1311.489,1312.025,When he was arrested?
1968.131,1,27622,howard_mendelow,,1312.025,1315.964,-- the record does not reflect any charge but we would assume --
1968.131,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1315.964,1323.854,Is there anything in the record that any time that shows any charge that was ever filed during the whole 10 days.
1968.131,1,27622,howard_mendelow,,1323.854,1325.13,"Yes, there is Your Honor."
1968.131,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1325.13,1326.994,Where is it?
1968.131,1,27622,howard_mendelow,,1326.994,1329.683,"By reasonable inference, a petitioner --"
1968.131,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1329.683,1333.679,I particularly said in the record.
1968.131,1,27622,howard_mendelow,,1333.679,1333.846,"No, sir."
1968.131,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1333.846,1339.487,"So, you held him for 10 days without any charge at all?"
1968.131,1,27622,howard_mendelow,,1339.487,1348.782,"We would assume he was arrested and booked for a charge but it does not reflect in the record, it does reflect in the record that he was arrested."
1968.131,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1348.782,1350.121,Just on general principle?
1968.131,1,27622,howard_mendelow,,1350.121,1353.468,"No sir, I would assume not."
1968.131,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1353.468,1362.716,"Well, I -- don't you think that to hold a man for 10 days requires the state to show what he was being held for?"
1968.131,1,27622,howard_mendelow,,1362.716,1363.966,"I would think it would, Your Honor."
1968.131,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1363.966,1366.341,And in this case it does not show anything.
1968.131,1,27622,howard_mendelow,,1366.341,1369.719,Not specifically per se in the record.
1968.131,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1369.719,1373.287,What does in the record helps you on this point?
1968.131,1,27622,howard_mendelow,,1373.287,1387.375,The fact that he was arrested and 25 hours after his arrest a lineup was held and the victim of the particular robbery that he was arrested for came in and picked him out of six-man lineup.
1968.131,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1387.375,1392.62,Did he pick him out or they picked the shortest man out who was there?
1968.131,1,27622,howard_mendelow,,1392.62,1397.48,"Mr. Justice Marshall, there were two lineups held in this case."
1968.131,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1455.754,1459.388,And was he charged then?
1968.131,1,27622,howard_mendelow,,1459.388,1466.662,The ultimate charge was placed against him 10 days after his initial arrest.
1968.131,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1466.662,1470.369,How many days after he was identified?
1968.131,1,27622,howard_mendelow,,1471.293,1471.977,Eight days.
1968.131,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1471.977,1472.429,Eight days.
1968.131,1,27622,howard_mendelow,,1472.429,1477.191,"Eight days, Your Honor but a petition for writ of habeas corpus was filed."
1968.131,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1494.222,1499.033,But the fact that there's -- now they're asking no issue of an illegal residence case?
1968.131,1,27622,howard_mendelow,,1499.033,1500.704,"Correct sir, Mr. Justice White."
1968.131,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1500.704,1504.676,And the Supreme Court of Florida said (Inaudible)?
1968.131,1,27622,howard_mendelow,,1504.676,1505.488,That is correct.
1968.131,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1505.488,1507.71,(Inaudible)
1968.131,1,27622,howard_mendelow,,1507.71,1511.062,They're still is in as far as State of Florida is concerned.
1968.131,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1515.878,1518.369,Who is it -- even if the record does not (Inaudible)?
1968.131,1,27622,howard_mendelow,,1518.369,1519.71,"Correct, Your Honor."
1968.131,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1519.71,1523.688,And no detention at your risk? Not found on (Inaudible).
1968.131,1,27622,howard_mendelow,,1523.688,1525.442,That is correct.
1968.131,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1525.442,1533.033,When was the petition for habeas corpus filed with relation to that second lineup?
1968.131,1,27622,howard_mendelow,,1533.033,1535.048,"The record does not reflect that, Your Honor."
1968.131,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1536.546,1545.866,"Well, I suppose you could --you could tell me what date the lineup was on and what date the petitioner was filed detention."
1968.131,1,27622,howard_mendelow,,1545.866,1550.387,"No, because it hasn't been made in exhibit or part of the exhibit in this file."
1968.131,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1648.972,1656.493,"How does the fact, there's a lot of facts in the lineup to get into the evidence of thought?"
1968.131,1,27622,howard_mendelow,,1656.493,1660.777,The first witness called by the State was the victim Loy Dill.
1968.131,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1699.175,1705.373,"Well, I'm trying to get a -- were the facts in the lineup, what are the direct examination or cross exam?"
1968.131,1,27622,howard_mendelow,,1705.373,1712.231,"They were --initially, they were brought out on direct examination and then they were brought out on cross-examination."
1968.131,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1723.59,1735.679,Is there anything else sir that occurred during the time of the detention which I think that it's agreeing was unlawful in the Florida Law?
1968.131,1,27622,howard_mendelow,,1746.18,1751.591,I will submit Mr. Justice Fortas that nothing other than two lineups --
1968.131,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1751.591,1752.521,Two lineups?
1968.131,1,27622,howard_mendelow,,1752.521,1753.246,That's correct.
1968.131,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1753.246,1757.589,Is there any evidence in this record of prolonged questioning?
1968.131,1,27622,howard_mendelow,,1757.589,1783.176,"There is no evidence in the record and the record in fact and the appendix which is before the court that indicates any question of any way manner or form, nor was petitioner's conviction based upon any inculpatory statements or exculpatory statements or any admission or any statement whatsoever made by him while in custody."
1968.131,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1783.176,1809.923,"Alright, that's what sort of baffling about this case that is to say that do we have before this record showing that the man was kept in jail for 10 days and have violation of Florida Statute which requires that it be taken before the magistrate and the courts below seemed to agree that there was some violation of the Florida Statute."
1968.131,1,27622,howard_mendelow,,1815.236,1816.676,That is correct.
1968.131,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1828.408,1847.541,"But am I correct or incorrect in saying that the --in recalling that the court below seems to agree that it's a violation of the Florida Statute which says, number one, indicates of maybe the remedy as not to set aside of the conviction."
1968.131,1,27622,howard_mendelow,,1852.674,1858.299,"Basically, you are correct, Mr. Justice Fortas, I will try to refine that a little bit in the cause of my argument finally."
1968.131,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1858.299,1860.873,Thank you.
1968.131,1,27622,howard_mendelow,,1860.873,1878.25,Petitioner contends or asks this Court to extend the McNabb-Mallory Rule and make it applicable to the States and also make it applicable to confessions.
1968.131,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1882.106,1884.146,"You mean, make it applicable to the lineup?"
1968.131,1,27622,howard_mendelow,,1884.146,1888.437,"Excuse me, make it applicable to the lineup, I'm sorry."
1968.131,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2095.81,2111.056,"Mr. Mendelow, do you know the case where the Supreme of Court of Florida has said that they need to comply with the statutes required the thing for magistrate as grounds for reversal of the criminal case?"
1968.131,1,27622,howard_mendelow,,2111.056,2113.497,No case to my knowledge has ever been decided on the cases --
1968.131,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2113.497,2118.543,"Now, what good is the statute if it's not followed?"
1968.131,1,27622,howard_mendelow,,2118.543,2132.387,"Your Honor, the Supreme Court of Florida has consistently held that a preliminary hearing is not a critical stage in a criminal prosecution case and may I explain why."
1968.131,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2158.999,2161.626,No questions about from the counsel or anything?
1968.131,1,27622,howard_mendelow,,2161.626,2171.723,I've assumed that that's what the magistrate would do when the accused just presented before and I'm only reading the literal or interpreting the literal expression of the statute.
1968.131,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2183.126,2189.847,I don't know the answer but Mr. Goldman said that this man was held incommunicado.
1968.131,1,27622,howard_mendelow,,2189.847,2191.686,I don't believe the record reflects that.
1968.131,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2191.686,2193.091,They've just held as any other --
1968.131,1,27622,howard_mendelow,,2193.091,2196.83,He was held pursuant to a lawful arrest.
1968.131,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2201.461,2204.948,In what charge was he booked?
1968.131,1,27622,howard_mendelow,,2205.529,2219.595,"Mr. Justice Marshall, you asked me the question a little while ago and I'm afraid that I didn't have the answer to Mr. Justice Fortas, I can only assume from the record that he was booked for the crime for which he was ultimately tried."
1968.131,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2219.595,2222.327,You don't know whether that's so or not?
1968.131,1,27622,howard_mendelow,,2222.327,2246.927,"Well, the only way I can bring this clear to the Court, I do not know but the only way I can infer from the record is that 25 hours after his arrest, he was placed in a lineup and the victim of this particular robbery that he was arrested for was called down to identify someone --"
1968.131,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2246.927,2258.748,"Is there any -- and you also said in response to Justice Marshall's question as I understand it that, there are no cases under this Florida Statute?"
1968.131,1,27622,howard_mendelow,,2258.748,2260.098,"Yes, there are."
1968.131,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2260.098,2276.26,"Well, what's the maximum period of detention? How long can a person be held without being charged or taken before a magistrate?"
1968.131,1,27622,howard_mendelow,,2281.062,2288.268,I just don't know the answer for it Mr. Justice Fortas.
1968.131,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2342.301,2343.556,"Mr. Mendelow, let me ask you?"
1968.131,1,27622,howard_mendelow,,2343.556,2345.02,"Yes, Mr. Justice White."
1968.131,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2345.02,2355.103,"Awhile ago, you indicated with that the issue of illegal arrest hasn't been made in this proceeding."
1968.131,1,27622,howard_mendelow,,2357.859,2359.313,"Yes, it was before the trial court."
1968.131,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2359.313,2361.436,(Inaudible) from the oral motion and written?
1968.131,1,27622,howard_mendelow,,2361.436,2363.001,"Yes, it was, Your Honor."
1968.131,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2363.001,2366.644,"And now, where did that point to us then?"
1968.131,1,27622,howard_mendelow,,2366.644,2368.554,Down to direct appeal.
1968.131,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2368.554,2373.003,But I don't quite when he mentioned it in the District Court of Appeals?
1968.131,1,27622,howard_mendelow,,2373.003,2375.917,That's correct because it wasn't presented.
1968.131,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2375.917,2379.371,Is that the point raise in those parts?
1968.131,1,27622,howard_mendelow,,2379.371,2380.56,Not to my knowledge.
1968.131,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2380.56,2381.418,It is not --
1968.131,1,27622,howard_mendelow,,2381.418,2391.053,The point raised in the District Court was the detention and sufficiency.
1968.131,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2398.143,2412.175,"In Florida, after preliminary hearing it's found that there's no probable cause?"
1968.131,1,27622,howard_mendelow,,2412.175,2420.006,"No, because there are many, many circumstances why a magistrate would say there'd be no probable cause."
1968.131,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2456.001,2458.392,(Inaudible)?
