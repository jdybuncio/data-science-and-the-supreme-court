1969.33_orig,0,21143,don_langston,,44.873,45.936,May it please the Court.
1969.33_orig,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,45.936,47.329,Mr. Langston.
1969.33_orig,0,21143,don_langston,,47.329,62.335,This is an original action brought by the State of Arkansas against the State of Tennessee under constitutional provision for original actions boundary disputes between states.
1969.33_orig,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,260.235,266.676,Are there any residents or any residential buildings on the properties on that area?
1969.33_orig,0,21143,don_langston,,266.676,268.885,No Your Honor.
1969.33_orig,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,274.218,279.238,What is its value?
1969.33_orig,0,21143,don_langston,,279.238,281.99,"Close to half million dollars, I believe Your Honor."
1969.33_orig,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,281.99,288.063,"I mean, what -- its valuable quality, what are its valuable qualities?"
1969.33_orig,0,21143,don_langston,,288.063,294.408,It can be farmed with row crops and it has very much timber on it Your Honor.
1969.33_orig,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,294.408,298.431,What kind of timber?
1969.33_orig,0,21143,don_langston,,298.431,306.967,Just hardwood timber and things of that nature that will grow and low type areas of the Alluvial Valley of the Mississippi River.
1969.33_orig,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,306.967,310.361,Anyone been farming it?
1969.33_orig,0,21143,don_langston,,310.361,314.171,Parts of it are being farmed as crops.
1969.33_orig,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,319.371,323.233,How far from the Arkansas side of the river?
1969.33_orig,0,21143,don_langston,,323.233,324.955,It's attached to the Arkansas side of the river.
1969.33_orig,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,324.955,325.746,That is to it?
1969.33_orig,0,21143,don_langston,,325.746,330.613,"Yes sir, Your Honor."
1969.33_orig,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,330.613,335.36,You should file it.
1969.33_orig,0,21143,don_langston,,335.36,362.553,"There is a marked area along there, but the area of photograph, which is located in the back of the State of Tennessee is free which is on A 11 Appendix A 6 will show that it is -- this is a 1929 map and the attachment to the State of Arkansas is even more now than it was in that particular time."
1969.33_orig,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,363.657,371.794,"Sometimes it's been separated from the mainland and sometimes the sandbar builds up and it's connected, is that it?"
1969.33_orig,0,21143,don_langston,,371.794,382.919,"There are trees and vegetation and things that do connect it to the State of Arkansas, which have been filled in by sediment and it is attached to the State of Arkansas."
1969.33_orig,1,27999,heard_h_sutton,,2195.316,2214.654,"Mr. Chief Justice, Mr. Associate Justice, the state of Tennessee urges that you overrule the exceptions of the State of Arkansas that you approve and confirm the report of the Master and in a decree in this Court as he recommends."
1969.33_orig,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2240.524,2251.087,Will you draw that isle up a little bit nearer to -- and still leave room for yourself of course but --
1969.33_orig,1,27999,heard_h_sutton,,2251.087,2253.03,"Now, Your Honor this --"
1969.33_orig,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2253.03,2254.193,"Just for a moment, can you see?"
1969.33_orig,1,27999,heard_h_sutton,,2254.193,2257.122,Can you see Mr. Justice?
1969.33_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2257.122,2262.17,I think you're going to have to speak with the microphone –-
1969.33_orig,1,27999,heard_h_sutton,,2262.17,2265.371,These drawings are in the exhibits.
1969.33_orig,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2274.643,2282.283,"Now, will you get us oriented with the where North is, is North in the conventional top of the map position here?"
1969.33_orig,1,27999,heard_h_sutton,,2282.283,2285.424,Your Honor ordinarily the top of the map is North and --
1969.33_orig,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2285.424,2286.777,"It doesn't look like now, does it?"
1969.33_orig,1,27999,heard_h_sutton,,2286.777,2295.727,It will be so on all of these drawings and there are only about three drawings where that rule is not used.
1969.33_orig,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2302.13,2304.891,Would you alert us when you are dealing with any exception?
1969.33_orig,1,27999,heard_h_sutton,,2304.891,2307.533,Yes sir.
1969.33_orig,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2334.217,2336.85,The outer side of the blue the mark --
1969.33_orig,1,27999,heard_h_sutton,,2336.85,2347.94,"Yes blue is the water, the white is Arkansas and this pink color is the Tennessee lands on which titles were traced to these accretions."
1969.33_orig,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2347.94,2351.194,Is that map reproduced in any of the --
1969.33_orig,1,27999,heard_h_sutton,,2351.194,2366.878,"No sir, not in the brief but there is a report by Mr. Rogers, it's Tennessee's exhibit 10 and in that report he places these maps in a reduced form so that you have the complete set up in there."
1969.33_orig,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2366.878,2368.568,That would be in the original record I suppose to --
1969.33_orig,1,27999,heard_h_sutton,,2368.568,2370.087,That would be in original record.
1969.33_orig,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2370.087,2372.202,But not in anything that's been submitted to us?
1969.33_orig,1,27999,heard_h_sutton,,2372.202,2375.027,No sir.
1969.33_orig,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2470.144,2483.084,"Before you go on, does the orange colored area represents or tell us what portion of the total area in dispute is represented by the orange colored area here?"
1969.33_orig,1,27999,heard_h_sutton,,2483.084,2493.336,"Well, the orange colored area is the land added by accretions to the original Tennessee lands holding because the rivers moving this way."
1969.33_orig,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2493.336,2498.996,Was that -- is the orange part all of the land that is in dispute?
1969.33_orig,1,27999,heard_h_sutton,,2498.996,2500.204,None at this time.
1969.33_orig,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2663.024,2665.334,As of the date of that map.
1969.33_orig,1,27999,heard_h_sutton,,2665.334,2665.598,Yes sir.
1969.33_orig,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2665.598,2674.58,"To which you now addressing yourself though just for purposes of clarification, where do you say that boundary between these two states."
1969.33_orig,1,27999,heard_h_sutton,,2674.58,2676.05,It is still in the thalweg.
1969.33_orig,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2676.05,2677.646,The center of the channel.
1969.33_orig,1,27999,heard_h_sutton,,2677.646,2682.795,Of the channel of the river as it goes around that beam.
1969.33_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2682.795,2685.226,The distance traveled may not be the center?
1969.33_orig,1,27999,heard_h_sutton,,2685.226,2686.894,It may not be the center but --
1969.33_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2686.894,2688.938,(Inaudible)
1969.33_orig,1,27999,heard_h_sutton,,2688.938,2699.905,"Your Honor, there are -- it was a case from this Court that it remains in the thalweg which is generally the deepest part of the river not always but it's where the boats go."
1969.33_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2699.905,2706.598,That rank has been very well kept like that because of the Arkansas.
1969.33_orig,1,27999,heard_h_sutton,,2706.598,2741.963,"According to measurements now on these maps in 1904 and the later one 1912, the engineers actually measured the depth of the water that's colored blue here and by examining those maps carefully you can see how deep the water is and those measurements mostly in most cases would be like one foot here, two feet, five feet, ten feet, thirty feet, fifty feet and within ten feet of the bank it would be 30 feet deep on the out of rim of the wheel."
1969.33_orig,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2845.99,2848.074,What do you mean zero water?
1969.33_orig,1,27999,heard_h_sutton,,2848.074,2852.757,I won't explain that in detail later -- I might as well do it now.
1969.33_orig,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2906.656,2908.705,That's low water?
1969.33_orig,1,27999,heard_h_sutton,,2908.705,2913.632,"No sir, low water is 3.2 feet above zero."
1969.33_orig,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2935.473,2939.286,"That low water you say is 3.2 deep, where at the Matthews Gate?"
1969.33_orig,1,27999,heard_h_sutton,,2939.286,2940.087,At Matthews.
1969.33_orig,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2969.525,2979.424,But that does not mean that up here when a 3.2 feet at the Memphis case if there is 3.2 feet of water up what we are talking about.
1969.33_orig,1,27999,heard_h_sutton,,2979.424,2981.394,It will only give you a comparison.
1969.33_orig,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2981.394,2984.527,It's just as that is the point of low water and that's writing in the --
1969.33_orig,1,27999,heard_h_sutton,,2984.527,2986.219,"That's right, you will know."
1969.33_orig,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3022.246,3025.97,Isn't there a difference between high water and flood water?
1969.33_orig,1,27999,heard_h_sutton,,3025.97,3030.826,The flood waters as we speak of are when they get above that figure.
1969.33_orig,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3147.607,3153.411,It would help me with the topic counsel if could see comparison again that the one you showed –
1969.33_orig,1,27999,heard_h_sutton,,3153.411,3155.221,"Well I was going down, yes sir."
1969.33_orig,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3155.221,3159.822,"A flash, you just turn it up for a moment so we can make comparison."
1969.33_orig,1,27999,heard_h_sutton,,3159.822,3162.715,This is as it is today.
1969.33_orig,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3178.564,3180.03,Where is the river?
1969.33_orig,1,27999,heard_h_sutton,,3180.03,3184.151,The river is at this point.
1969.33_orig,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3184.151,3198.467,"Which – taking the island which is on the former picture, the last to previous exhibit, identify that on the second one for me at least that would help."
1969.33_orig,1,27999,heard_h_sutton,,3198.467,3201.462,That would be this area.
1969.33_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3215.021,3216.384,You better go ahead now.
1969.33_orig,1,27999,heard_h_sutton,,3216.384,3218.78,"Yes, Your Honor, we will go through from begin and the end."
1969.33_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3218.78,3224.319,"I'm sorry, I beg your attention, what is the overlay?"
1969.33_orig,1,27999,heard_h_sutton,,3224.319,3231.393,The over lay is also a copy of the aerial photograph of 1965.
1969.33_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3371.06,3377.096,What statement it is?
1969.33_orig,1,27999,heard_h_sutton,,3377.096,3385.911,"Your Honor, on page seven of the Master's report in the second paragraph."
1969.33_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3407.786,3423.346,"So he's really saying if the erosion and accretion occur lays that high water or at extra ordinary high water, he is saying that as long as that could happen, the boundary could change."
1969.33_orig,1,27999,heard_h_sutton,,3423.346,3426.336,He says that if erosion and accretion occur.
1969.33_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3426.336,3428.734,No matter whether it's an high water or low water anything?
1969.33_orig,1,27999,heard_h_sutton,,3428.734,3435.2,"That's right, you say that just like Mr. Smith said it is not the stage of the river that causes this."
1969.33_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3451.495,3470.059,"Well, I suppose if this channel like that lake channel, that old with the old channel that north and west they weren't -- I suppose to be absolutely dry six months of the year or nine months of the year and that at very high water, there could be water running through which would erode the banks."
1969.33_orig,1,27999,heard_h_sutton,,3470.059,3475.74,"Your Honor that would depend on -- merely to think it is possible, yes and as a matter of fact the low is that."
1969.33_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3475.74,3478.905,"And under the Master's rule, the state line would change then?"
1969.33_orig,1,27999,heard_h_sutton,,3478.905,3491.85,"Yes sir, if it erodes, this court has said itself that so long as the old channel can be moved by erosion and accretion."
1969.33_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3491.85,3497.124,Even though it's no longer an active channel or for navigation or for anything else.
1969.33_orig,1,27999,heard_h_sutton,,3497.124,3504.147,"That's the point Your Honor, if there is enough water in there to cause it to erode, it is an active channel."
1969.33_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3506.588,3516.111,I know it is but just a little sort of a -- it's not really the arm -- it's just the sort of inactive arm with the Mississippi River?
1969.33_orig,1,27999,heard_h_sutton,,3516.111,3516.601,Yes sir.
1969.33_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3517.893,3525.163,Although that inactive arm is sufficient to -- is still effective to change the boundary?
1969.33_orig,1,27999,heard_h_sutton,,3525.163,3526.413,"I don't think so, no sir."
1969.33_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3528.429,3537.447,"I know but if there was a lot of -- and certainly there was a large flood and water went through that channel, it would and it eroded, the boundary would change."
1969.33_orig,1,27999,heard_h_sutton,,3537.447,3545.393,"Your Honor, there had been two very high and extremely bad floods."
1969.33_orig,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3567.311,3570.886,"As you're active in what sense, active in the sense -- object you have used?"
1969.33_orig,1,27999,heard_h_sutton,,3570.886,3575.923,That you have erosion and accretion there.
1969.33_orig,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3575.923,3580.342,Used for navigation or just capable of being used for navigation?
1969.33_orig,1,27999,heard_h_sutton,,3580.342,3583.568,"Well, Your Honor let me answer that in this fashion."
1969.33_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3634.727,3655.291,"I suppose you would agree that if there are these various stages of the river which I take it everyone agrees, there are that channel could be stagnant in the sense that there would be no erosion or accretion at the lowest stages of the river."
1969.33_orig,1,27999,heard_h_sutton,,3669.867,3677.036,"No sir Your Honor, let me explain there and let's take this particular situation as an example."
1969.33_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3689.203,3692.628,You mean the channel was closed to navigation?
1969.33_orig,1,27999,heard_h_sutton,,3692.628,3693.812,The channel closes itself.
1969.33_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3693.812,3695.465,But it wasn't physically closed?
1969.33_orig,1,27999,heard_h_sutton,,3695.465,3697.48,"Yes sir, that's what I wanted to explain."
1969.33_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3742.508,3748.296,When do you think stagnation occurred and erosion stopped?
1969.33_orig,1,27999,heard_h_sutton,,3748.296,3751.189,We have a map to back us up Your Honor.
1969.33_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3773.085,3774.928,"Well, we got to look at it?"
1969.33_orig,1,27999,heard_h_sutton,,3774.928,3777.114,Yes sir.
1969.33_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3869.022,3872.482,"You think in 1929, the river was stagnant."
1969.33_orig,1,27999,heard_h_sutton,,3872.482,3872.819,Yes sir and it has --
1969.33_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3872.819,3874.389,I mean that old channel was stagnant?
1969.33_orig,1,27999,heard_h_sutton,,3874.389,3878.43,Yes it has not moved since that time at all.
1969.33_orig,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3903.363,3909.556,But now when you have that overlay where is the main channel of the river?
1969.33_orig,1,27999,heard_h_sutton,,3909.556,3910.879,Right here Your Honor.
1969.33_orig,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3910.879,3912.801,The boats used that?
1969.33_orig,1,27999,heard_h_sutton,,3912.801,3916.881,"That is the avulsive or our new channel, just as their old channel --"
1969.33_orig,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3916.881,3922.406,"Approximately what's the width of that channel, it's of course, it looks very narrow on this map."
1969.33_orig,1,27999,heard_h_sutton,,3922.406,3924.423,Are you talking about as it is today?
1969.33_orig,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3924.423,3925.773,As it is today.

1969.33_orig,1,27999,heard_h_sutton,,4003.755,4004.471,It's the dark line.
1969.33_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4004.471,4006.543,Everybody agrees that was 1912?

1969.33_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4041.229,4049.832,"You mean they still agree that in the lower part of that channel, it was still active and not to be considered an active channel for purpose of moving the state line."

1969.33_orig,3,27999,heard_h_sutton,,5803.193,5804.673,He would have to cross the river.

1969.33_orig,3,27999,heard_h_sutton,,5805.488,5806.514,They used a boat.
1969.33_orig,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5806.514,5807.521,A boat?
1969.33_orig,3,27999,heard_h_sutton,,5807.521,5813.214,This was a negro man that went over there and farmed for a while and I think the high water came along and wiped them out --
1969.33_orig,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5813.214,5815.286,Just an ordinary boat was there?

1969.33_orig,3,27999,heard_h_sutton,,5883.339,5887.521,It would be that mile across the river to this land.

1969.33_orig,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5999.346,6001.613,Was there any house owner?

1969.33_orig,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6005.858,6009.414,What kind of house?
1969.33_orig,4,21143,don_langston,,6009.414,6011.87,"Pretty primitive, if I remember."
1969.33_orig,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6011.87,6013.482,Does the evidence show?

1969.33_orig,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6227.795,6230.925,Is it getting any?
1969.33_orig,4,21143,don_langston,,6230.925,6240.815,I think severance taxes maybe all for timber and few things like that but I don't think that taxes would be very much.

1969.33_orig,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,6325.461,6337.289,"Well, I suppose it's not uncommon on land boundaries for the farmers to have the farm –they have got couple of hundred acres in one state and spill over into the next state."
1969.33_orig,4,21143,don_langston,,6339.378,6349.862,"I wouldn't think so, of course here the river would make it too feasible but you could own some on both sides."

1969.33_orig,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6455.486,6480.917,"Well, not up to the north and west relief into that territory and it doesn't seem to me that even if you have some difference about what to test or to be when the old channel dies if you both agree that that state line in 1912 was where that maps showed it was?"
1969.33_orig,4,21143,don_langston,,6480.917,6482.896,We don't agree where it was Your Honor.
1969.33_orig,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6482.896,6484.226,In 1912?
1969.33_orig,4,21143,don_langston,,6484.226,6486.612,That's right.
1969.33_orig,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6495.289,6517.009,"Well if the state line is where he says that was in 1912 to the north and the west, Cow Island or that segment of Cow Island, the state line is where he said it was all the accretions and where on the Tennessee side of that line."
1969.33_orig,4,21143,don_langston,,6517.009,6518.448,That's not our position Your Honor.

1969.33_orig,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6528.831,6529.604,Isn't it?
1969.33_orig,4,21143,don_langston,,6529.604,6530.6,Yes.

1969.33_orig,4,21143,don_langston,,6571.533,6592.932,Your Honor it's our position that this evolved area keep eroding away and got to where Smith scar was whenever the thalweg died.
1969.33_orig,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6624.066,6630.359,Is there anything in the record that shows why Arkansas filed this suit?
1969.33_orig,4,21143,don_langston,,6630.359,6640.325,"Your Honor, we filed this lawsuit on the basis of request from officials of Crittenden County who were prevailed upon by the private citizens who were involved there."
1969.33_orig,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6640.325,6644.178,Is that shown in the record?
