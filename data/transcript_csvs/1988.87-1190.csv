1988.87-1190,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.842,"We'll hear argument first this morning on No. 87-1190, United States against Broce."
1988.87-1190,0,39136,roy_t_englert_jr,,11.855,28.88,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this case presents the question of whether defendants who plead guilty to two facially valid indictments have the right to claim later, for the first time on collateral attack, that they were guilty of only one crime, despite what the indictment said."
1988.87-1190,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,244.402,250.915,"Well, what about the... how, were they sentenced separately for the two conspiracies?"
1988.87-1190,0,39136,roy_t_englert_jr,,250.915,251.227,--Yes.
1988.87-1190,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,262.926,269.189,Was there some acknowledgement that they might have been sentenced consecutively?
1988.87-1190,0,39136,roy_t_englert_jr,,269.189,271.609,"--That was explicit in the plea agreements, yes, your Honor."
1988.87-1190,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,271.609,272.546,Explicit?
1988.87-1190,0,39136,roy_t_englert_jr,,272.546,273.171,Explicit.
1988.87-1190,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,321.574,326.602,Were these two conspiracies included in that overall one?
1988.87-1190,0,39136,roy_t_englert_jr,,326.602,331.132,"Yes, the theory of Beachner, your Honor, is that there was just one conspiracy on every--"
1988.87-1190,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,331.132,331.85,Including these two?
1988.87-1190,0,39136,roy_t_englert_jr,,331.85,336.271,"--Including these two, every highway construction project in Kansas throughout the 60's and 70's."
1988.87-1190,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,420.361,425.829,All of these proceedings after the plea agreement and since were under Rule 35?
1988.87-1190,0,39136,roy_t_englert_jr,,425.829,429.109,"They purported to be brought under Rule 35, your Honor."
1988.87-1190,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,443.336,449.85,Do you think that anything that can be brought under Rule 35 can also be brought under Federal habeas?
1988.87-1190,0,39136,roy_t_englert_jr,,449.85,453.098,"--No, not necessarily, your Honor."
1988.87-1190,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,563.756,566.208,"Mr. Englert, can I ask you a question?"
1988.87-1190,0,39136,roy_t_englert_jr,,597.102,601.929,"Your Honor, I'd like to be able to say that, but I don't think I can in this case."
1988.87-1190,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,603.708,604.192,I understand.
1988.87-1190,0,39136,roy_t_englert_jr,,604.192,611.113,"And so, there is no substantive offense that corresponds to the conspiracy offense, the conspiracy to rig bids."
1988.87-1190,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,613.846,614.33,I understand.
1988.87-1190,0,39136,roy_t_englert_jr,,633.306,645.175,"--Well, your Honor, that's consistent with what the Sixth Circuit said, in a case called in re Grand Jury Proceedings, Involving Delard Electric Company and the Sergeant Electric Company, in a conspiracy in Kentucky."
1988.87-1190,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,657.921,660.107,"Braverman, you think, is the obstacle to that?"
1988.87-1190,0,39136,roy_t_englert_jr,,660.107,661.998,That is the obstacle we see.
1988.87-1190,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,759.537,765.534,"You don't really get to any double jeopardy claim, because on the facts to which the defendant agreed, there was no dud."
1988.87-1190,0,39136,roy_t_englert_jr,,767.361,768.579,"That's precisely right, your Honor."
1988.87-1190,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,782.449,785.697,"Well, isn't there some argument that they didn't agree to those facts at all?"
1988.87-1190,0,39136,roy_t_englert_jr,,792.257,795.084,"I'm not aware of any such argument, your Honor."
1988.87-1190,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,795.693,798.942,You think the indictment was clear enough to make that clear?
1988.87-1190,0,39136,roy_t_englert_jr,,798.942,801.223,--I think the indictment was clear enough to take that clear.
1988.87-1190,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,801.223,802.94,Isn't there some argument that it wasn't?
1988.87-1190,0,39136,roy_t_englert_jr,,802.94,807.423,"There is some argument that the indictment was vague, but even... I think that argument is quite wrong."
1988.87-1190,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,994.739,1003.657,"Mr. Englert, is it really true that you could say so categorically, in Menna, that there was no factual admission there?"
1988.87-1190,0,39136,roy_t_englert_jr,,1023.369,1027.804,"Your Honor, I don't think that would be a factual admission."
1988.87-1190,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1027.804,1032.475,Whether or not it there was a prior trial for the same offense?
1988.87-1190,0,39136,roy_t_englert_jr,,1033.192,1036.879,"Well, it was undisputed that there was a prior trial for the same offense in that case."
1988.87-1190,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1041.034,1048.061,"Well, you mean it would be... this case should come out differently if it were undisputed that in fact there was only one conspiracy?"
1988.87-1190,0,39136,roy_t_englert_jr,,1048.061,1051.467,If it had been undisputed at the time--
1988.87-1190,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1051.467,1052.201,"No, not at the time."
1988.87-1190,0,39136,roy_t_englert_jr,,1063.166,1063.603,--That's correct.
1988.87-1190,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1063.603,1065.666,I don't see why it's any different in Menna.
1988.87-1190,0,39136,roy_t_englert_jr,,1077.222,1083.158,"Well, all I can say, your Honor, is the Court certainly didn't look at it that way."
1988.87-1190,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1119.549,1127.531,"Well, but once again, you wouldn't, you wouldn't say... would you say to make a difference in this case, if there was doubt whether there was one conspiracy or two at the time?"
1988.87-1190,0,39136,roy_t_englert_jr,,1129.234,1133.03,There was no doubt raised by the defendants.
1988.87-1190,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1149.383,1152.366,"Okay, but that's a different point from which you've been... from the one that you've been urging on us."
1988.87-1190,0,39136,roy_t_englert_jr,,1163.658,1168.484,--It's not just plausibly disputed.
1988.87-1190,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1237.504,1261.759,"Just to pursue that... if in Menna there had been an allegation that there had been prior conduct disposed of by an earlier plea and a further assertion that the earlier plea was for a different transaction, or a different occurrence, then there would have been double jeopardy?"
1988.87-1190,0,39136,roy_t_englert_jr,,1261.759,1267.023,"--I think not, if there had been an assertion it was for a different transaction or occurrence."
1988.87-1190,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1279.518,1288.593,"But your response to Justice Scalla was that it depends on whether or not it's a dispute matter in taking, in the taking of the plea."
1988.87-1190,0,39136,roy_t_englert_jr,,1288.593,1307.977,"Yes, and I think if the disputed matter had been whether there were separate occurrences giving rise to the two charges in Menna, that would be a factual dispute between the Government and the defendant, that the defendant would have to put in issue in order to have a right to raise that issue."
1988.87-1190,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1307.977,1318.378,"And if there had been any factual allegations of the prior conviction in Menna, there would then... the case would then be like the instant one?"
1988.87-1190,0,39136,roy_t_englert_jr,,1318.378,1320.221,"I'm sorry, I didn't hear you."
1988.87-1190,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1320.221,1324.281,"The case would be like the instant one, if there had been factual allegations of what occurred in Menna?"
1988.87-1190,0,39136,roy_t_englert_jr,,1324.281,1325.0,I think so.
1988.87-1190,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1336.636,1343.852,"Well, except when we talk about ""on the face"", we talk about the records that we can look to to the make the determination."
1988.87-1190,0,39136,roy_t_englert_jr,,1351.052,1353.473,"I think not, your Honor."
1988.87-1190,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1480.58,1489.482,"You don't raise a double jeopardy issue, at least you don't raise one successfully, before you plead guilty, because... you raise a multiplicity objection."
1988.87-1190,0,39136,roy_t_englert_jr,,1489.482,1489.685,Yes.
1988.87-1190,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1489.685,1494.372,"Jeopardy doesn't attach until either the first witness is sworn or, you know, whatever, on a court trial."
1988.87-1190,0,39136,roy_t_englert_jr,,1494.372,1495.807,"Of course, your Honor."
1988.87-1190,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1517.784,1519.83,Very well.
1988.87-1190,1,25095,glenn_e_casebeer_iii,,1522.032,1522.798,Thank you.
1988.87-1190,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1522.798,1524.469,How do you pronounce your client's name?
1988.87-1190,1,25095,glenn_e_casebeer_iii,,1524.469,1525.593,Broce.
1988.87-1190,2,39136,roy_t_englert_jr,,3297.852,3299.164,"Thank you, your Honor."
1988.87-1190,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3407.746,3409.667,"Nor, frequently people feel that way when they lose."
1988.87-1190,2,39136,roy_t_englert_jr,,3409.667,3410.824,"--Yes, your Honor."
1988.87-1190,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3413.275,3415.681,"Thank you, Mr. Englert."
