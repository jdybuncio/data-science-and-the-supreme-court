1996.95-1853,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.547,"We'll hear argument now in No. 95-1853, William Jefferson Clinton v. Paula Corbin Jones."
1996.95-1853,0,38678,robert_s_bennett,,9.839,13.912,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1996.95-1853,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,32.014,44.562,Is the request to totally dismiss the suit or to permit delay of the trial and any court appearance... in-court appearance or that position or that sort of thing?
1996.95-1853,0,38678,robert_s_bennett,,44.562,48.686,It is to delay the trial of the case and to--
1996.95-1853,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,48.686,49.377,How about discovery?
1996.95-1853,0,38678,robert_s_bennett,,49.377,52.489,--And the discovery of the case.
1996.95-1853,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,52.879,57.715,"How about discovery of people who are not the President, other witnesses and things like that?"
1996.95-1853,0,38678,robert_s_bennett,,57.715,59.665,"--That is correct, Your Honor."
1996.95-1853,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,60.516,62.009,You... you want to delay that as well?
1996.95-1853,0,38678,robert_s_bennett,,62.009,63.759,--I want to delay that as well.
1996.95-1853,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,64.138,70.493,Should that be a general rule if preservation of evidence becomes crucial in a case?
1996.95-1853,0,38678,robert_s_bennett,,70.493,88.405,"--As we discussed in the District Court below, Justice O'Connor, we have agreed, and the District Court noted, that if there's a danger of the loss of any evidence, that we would cooperate to preserve it and make use of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure."
1996.95-1853,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,88.405,93.11,"Well, what if you wouldn't go up and what if the District Court... what if the court below disagreed with you?"
1996.95-1853,0,38678,robert_s_bennett,,93.11,95.411,"Well, that's--"
1996.95-1853,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,95.411,99.334,"I mean, what... I'm trying to figure out what the rule of law you're urging upon us here."
1996.95-1853,0,38678,robert_s_bennett,,99.334,115.726,"--The rule of law that we are urging upon you, Justice Scalia, is unless there are exceptional circumstances in a case, the President of the United States should not be subject to litigation, either at trial or in discovery."
1996.95-1853,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,122.682,135.281,"Is that issue a Federal... is it a Federal... suppose the suit were in State court, and the State court decided that the testimony of someone who was not the President is important to be preserved."
1996.95-1853,0,38678,robert_s_bennett,,137.491,140.453,"Yes, it's a Federal question, because--"
1996.95-1853,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,140.453,146.637,"So if that State court's jurisdiction would be appealable here, or would the whole case be removable to Federal court, or--"
1996.95-1853,0,38678,robert_s_bennett,,146.637,154.163,"--Well, I don't know how you would move a case from State court unless there is diversity."
1996.95-1853,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,169.145,173.579,--But the constitutional ruling you're asking of us is not that the suit cannot be brought.
1996.95-1853,0,38678,robert_s_bennett,,173.579,175.39,"Well, we're asking--"
1996.95-1853,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,175.39,176.601,So you're saying that the suit can be brought.
1996.95-1853,0,38678,robert_s_bennett,,178.364,184.466,--We are saying the suit against the President of the United States can be brought.
1996.95-1853,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,186.418,186.868,Right.
1996.95-1853,0,38678,robert_s_bennett,,186.868,188.39,It can be brought in a Federal court.
1996.95-1853,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,188.551,188.711,Right.
1996.95-1853,0,38678,robert_s_bennett,,200.07,201.962,"--Yes, Your Honor, I believe that they do."
1996.95-1853,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,201.962,202.683,They do.
1996.95-1853,0,38678,robert_s_bennett,,214.141,226.55,"I believe that's correct, Your Honor, particularly in this case, where the plaintiff had almost 20 months when Mr. Clinton was... was the governor."
1996.95-1853,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,226.55,227.671,Mr. Bennett--
1996.95-1853,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,227.671,256.411,"--And I take it that... I take it that since you say... and I think you're correct that this must be a privilege that's applicable in State courts, otherwise it would be a loser and it wouldn't give the protection you think the President needs... I take it that means you cannot rely on separation of powers as the constitutional theory, as the constitutional premise, for your argument; you have to rely on some other constitutional doctrine?"
1996.95-1853,0,38678,robert_s_bennett,,256.411,259.293,"I don't agree with that, with all due respect, Your Honor."
1996.95-1853,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,278.056,278.287,Right.
1996.95-1853,0,38678,robert_s_bennett,,290.905,307.926,"Well, but I... I would find it hard to believe that this Court would say that separation of powers would apply in a Federal court proceeding, but that any county or State judge could virtually destroy the power of the President under the Constitution in his Article II duties."
1996.95-1853,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,307.926,309.936,"Well, I... I understand there's a Federal interest."
1996.95-1853,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,321.096,325.049,Then it's Federal sovereignty.
1996.95-1853,0,38678,robert_s_bennett,,338.058,339.31,I... I understand.
1996.95-1853,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,339.31,344.983,The supremacy clause... I don't know whether that bears on it... but certainly not separation of powers.
1996.95-1853,0,38678,robert_s_bennett,,344.983,346.674,"I... I understand that, Your Honor, but--"
1996.95-1853,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,346.674,360.632,"Mr. Bennett, is there any experience in States with the temporal immunity with respect to a governor that you are asserting here with respect to the chief officer--"
1996.95-1853,0,38678,robert_s_bennett,,360.632,361.864,"--We have found none, Your Honor."
1996.95-1853,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,361.864,376.733,--And is it necessary... you said we must decide this as a constitutional matter because of the State court situation... this could be dealt with in the Federal courts as a matter of Federal common law.
1996.95-1853,0,38678,robert_s_bennett,,415.854,420.326,"I'm not quite sure I understand the question, Your Honor, but I think I do."
1996.95-1853,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,450.666,458.312,"Well, I... I find it difficult to adopt such a Federal common law rule if it were... if it were so easily frustratable."
1996.95-1853,0,38678,robert_s_bennett,,479.889,490.224,"Yes, I agree it would be very silly for any county judge or any State judge to start deciding on the priorities of the President of... of the United States."
1996.95-1853,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,490.224,491.837,So I have to get to State courts somehow.
1996.95-1853,0,38678,robert_s_bennett,,497.4,511.831,"Oh, that's of most importance to this Court, particularly since the fact that you now have long-arm statutes which were not common in the days of our founders, and you could drag the President into any court."
1996.95-1853,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,535.177,537.297,"Or even worse, any Federal court."
1996.95-1853,0,38678,robert_s_bennett,,539.858,541.881,--Or any... or in any Federal court.
1996.95-1853,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,578.045,592.097,"Well, the record in Fitzgerald was based on a fear that unless you gave the President absolute immunity, as I understand the opinion, you... you... he would not vigorously exercise his official powers as President."
1996.95-1853,0,38678,robert_s_bennett,,594.988,602.613,"I agree with you, Mr. Justice... Mr. Chief Justice, that... that element is not present here."
1996.95-1853,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,618.653,623.067,"But, Mr. Bennett, that sentence that you feature was followed up by... by these words,"
1996.95-1853,0,38678,robert_s_bennett,,644.021,644.562,No.
1996.95-1853,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,667.613,667.813,But I think we're mixing up two things.
1996.95-1853,0,38678,robert_s_bennett,,684.747,685.448,Right.
1996.95-1853,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,686.916,689.988,"And there are different considerations involved in the two, are there not?"
1996.95-1853,0,38678,robert_s_bennett,,689.988,690.088,--Yes.
1996.95-1853,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,722.932,738.143,"But, in effect, I... I assume you're arguing that it is interference or the risk of interference with the actual presidential duties during the 4-year term that is the source of whatever privilege you request; isn't that right?"
1996.95-1853,0,38678,robert_s_bennett,,738.143,738.423,That's correct.
1996.95-1853,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,738.423,738.914,Right.
1996.95-1853,0,38678,robert_s_bennett,,763.059,767.012,"Well, Mr. Justice Souter, it's the realities of real-world litigation."
1996.95-1853,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,769.974,771.486,"Well, it's going to keep you busy."
1996.95-1853,0,38678,robert_s_bennett,,778.562,800.457,"--But in the real world of litigation, Mr. Justice Souter, do you think when Mr. Davis, as he... as he claims, that he's going to be deposing all of the troopers; and any time the President of the United States has come into contact with a member of the opposite sex, he intends to inquire of that; this is a conspiracy complaint; they talk about pattern of conduct--"
1996.95-1853,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,800.457,803.048,"Yes, but, Mr. Bennett--"
1996.95-1853,0,38678,robert_s_bennett,,803.048,806.43,--don't you think I'm going to have to talk to the President of United States about all those events?
1996.95-1853,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,806.43,807.181,"--Well, I assume--"
1996.95-1853,0,38678,robert_s_bennett,,809.464,816.518,I think some trial courts would say they are not and some trial courts might... might say they are.
1996.95-1853,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,818.829,820.992,How long do you think... how long... how long do you think it will take to try this case?
1996.95-1853,0,38678,robert_s_bennett,,820.992,824.024,It's impossible to say.
1996.95-1853,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,838.186,855.185,But... but there are... there are two elements here really... a concern about some conflict with a judge deciding how to weigh the interests of the President in attending a NATO meeting or something versus a desire to avoid damage control politically.
1996.95-1853,0,38678,robert_s_bennett,,859.959,868.877,I... I think the President is a political figure and... and deals in the political... political marketplace.
1996.95-1853,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,868.877,883.197,"Yet could be the concern about damage control, at bottom, would motivate, not necessarily this President, but any President, in wanting to spend a little time with the lawyer as these allegations are made."
1996.95-1853,0,38678,robert_s_bennett,,886.459,890.612,"Well, Your Honor, I don't think we can... I think... there's no perfect answer to this."
1996.95-1853,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,898.569,902.653,Why can't we wait until the President asserts such a conflict?
1996.95-1853,0,38678,robert_s_bennett,,922.275,928.689,"Well, I'm not so sure, in today's climate, that it is unlikely to arise."
1996.95-1853,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,937.186,938.458,"Thank you, Mr. Bennett."
1996.95-1853,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,940.97,949.448,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1996.95-1853,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,975.959,990.75,"Yeah, but to the extent that Nixon v. Fitzgerald involved some activity of the President that relates to his duties in office as President, that is an element that does not extend to this case."
1996.95-1853,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,990.75,992.052,"--That is correct, Justice O'Connor."
1996.95-1853,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,992.052,996.116,"And there may have been Folsom language, as there often is, in Court opinions."
1996.95-1853,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,1006.685,1010.558,"You are correct, Justice O'Connor, that it is a different issue in Fitzgerald."
1996.95-1853,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1024.936,1042.588,"Well, what is it in the Constitution that makes the immunity, let's say, of a Federal judge or the immunity of any Federal employee for acts of official duty binding in a State court, where that activity might itself constitute a tort under State law?"
1996.95-1853,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,1050.993,1051.283,Yes.
1996.95-1853,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1057.126,1069.134,"--So if there is a separation of powers doctrine that creates a... a... call it a Federal common law-type immunity, then that immunity for judges or anyone else is binding upon the State courts because of the supremacy?"
1996.95-1853,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,1069.134,1070.945,"--That is absolutely court, Justice Scalia, in--"
1996.95-1853,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1070.945,1073.807,"No, but not if it's based on the separation of powers."
1996.95-1853,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,1073.807,1080.402,--I believe that the Fitzgerald immunity clearly applies to actions brought in State court.
1996.95-1853,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1088.577,1102.928,"But isn't the reason for that that the immunity in a Federal court would be meaningless if it were subject to an end run, and that's how the supremacy clause translates a separation of powers doctrine into a State court immunity; isn't that the way it works?"
1996.95-1853,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,1102.928,1104.077,--That is exactly correct.
1996.95-1853,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1104.077,1112.375,"But a good... a good deal of your Federal official immunity for Federal comes by statute from Congress, not from the Constitution."
1996.95-1853,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,1112.375,1113.894,"Yes, some of that comes by--"
1996.95-1853,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1113.894,1120.26,And that of course isn't... we're not faced with a situation where Congress has passed a law granting this immunity.
1996.95-1853,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,1120.26,1122.711,"--That is correct, Mr. Chief Justice--"
1996.95-1853,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1122.711,1131.529,Let me... I don't understand how Nixon v. Fitzgerald requires you to say that it is separation of powers that somehow gets to the State courts.
1996.95-1853,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,1145.559,1146.33,"--Well, Justice--"
1996.95-1853,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1146.33,1148.472,You don't need separation of powers to get there.
1996.95-1853,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,1148.472,1148.662,--No.
1996.95-1853,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1152.443,1152.643,"Right, right."
1996.95-1853,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,1152.643,1153.344,Nixon v.--
1996.95-1853,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1153.344,1155.565,So that keeps the State courts out.
1996.95-1853,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,1159.609,1160.09,"--Yes, that is correct."
1996.95-1853,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1160.09,1160.64,Okay.
1996.95-1853,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,1170.405,1170.576,No.
1996.95-1853,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1170.576,1182.523,"On the other hand, the case such as Toddles case, which says that a State... or a State court... cannot enjoin a Federal official, have to do with a Federal official in the course of his duties."
1996.95-1853,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,1182.523,1185.256,"That is correct, Justice Kennedy."
1996.95-1853,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1197.854,1200.145,"Mr. Dellinger, can I ask you about that?"
1996.95-1853,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,1200.145,1200.315,Yes.
1996.95-1853,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1200.315,1211.782,"Your brief and the brief of the Petitioner both make a lot about the fact that the President is... you know, it's a full-time job and he... he's very... and any intrusion upon his time is intruding."
1996.95-1853,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,1237.41,1247.067,"Justice Scalia, the singularity and unitariness of the executive are what makes it distinguishable from every other official, and it's not possible--"
1996.95-1853,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1247.067,1274.575,"But we see Presidents riding horseback, chopping firewood, fishing for stick fish--"
1996.95-1853,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,1280.551,1281.112,--Justice Scalia--
1996.95-1853,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1281.112,1286.265,"But, really, the notion that he doesn't have a minute to spare is... is just not... not credible."
1996.95-1853,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,1286.265,1290.376,"--Justice Scalia, President Reagan said quite aptly, Presidents don't have vacations; they have a change of scenery."
1996.95-1853,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1324.89,1328.873,Perhaps you can help me with this aspect of that argument.
1996.95-1853,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,1386.814,1391.435,"Well, I think that certainly political pressures would cut against that."
1996.95-1853,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1421.457,1424.799,"Well, Mr. Dellinger, suppose it's a child custody matter."
1996.95-1853,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,1444.112,1448.704,"--Justice O'Connor, I believe that that would be... that's the most appealing case for an exception I've heard."
1996.95-1853,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1450.917,1457.78,"Well, so there's no automatic rule that the Court has to dismiss the minute the thing is filed; you acknowledge that?"
1996.95-1853,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,1457.78,1458.091,--Well--
1996.95-1853,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1458.091,1465.577,Or suppose a President in the future owns some part... great parcel of land somewhere and it's bubbling up with poisons.
1996.95-1853,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,1471.853,1475.195,--I am not suggesting that there's a balancing test or a case-by-case determination.
1996.95-1853,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1496.452,1500.876,"Well, once you assume that, arguendo, you don't have a firm rule, and you begin to lose me."
1996.95-1853,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,1500.876,1501.097,--No--
1996.95-1853,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1501.097,1508.631,"Because I don't like cases... I do not like courts engaging in case-by-case balancing and saying, This intrudes on the presidency too much, this doesn't intrude."
1996.95-1853,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,1508.631,1509.332,--This is not a matter--
1996.95-1853,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1509.332,1511.202,"You give me a clear line, and I might buy it."
1996.95-1853,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,1511.202,1516.905,"--The fact that you have a rule, and an operative rule, and it tells courts what to do does not mean that you can never make an exception."
1996.95-1853,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1518.347,1518.567,Is that right?
1996.95-1853,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,1518.567,1520.017,That's true of prior restraints.
1996.95-1853,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1520.247,1523.06,"General Dellinger, there was a list in many of the briefs."
1996.95-1853,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,1545.268,1549.722,--We believe that there should be a rule that any civil litigation against a President should be postponed.
1996.95-1853,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1569.618,1580.305,"What are those demands in respect to a deposition, say, kept under seal, of non-White House witnesses?"
1996.95-1853,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,1593.943,1606.001,"--I think it could interfere with the workings of the presidency, and therefore would urge that discovery be postponed, except for lost evidence that Mr. Bennett has acknowledged that he would accommodate."
1996.95-1853,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1623.352,1624.954,But surely the range of matters--
1996.95-1853,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,1634.311,1655.444,"--Mr. Chief Justice, the... when this country adopted the 25th amendment, it was a recognition by Congress and the courts that the President's office was singular, as Chairman Emmanuel Cellars said when he proposed the amendment to Congress, the Nation cannot permit the office of the President to be vacant even for a moment."
1996.95-1853,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1655.444,1656.434,But let's say it is singular.
1996.95-1853,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,1721.351,1721.361,Justice Scalia--
1996.95-1853,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1721.361,1725.134,Why isn't that enough to protect the President from all that we're worried about?
1996.95-1853,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,1725.134,1731.439,"--Because I think that risks both, failing to protect the President and risks undercutting the role of the courts."
1996.95-1853,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1735.683,1738.054,The beautiful thing about it is it takes the courts out of the scene.
1996.95-1853,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,1743.32,1743.73,--It totally undercuts--
1996.95-1853,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1743.73,1744.218,This way it's absolute.
1996.95-1853,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,1753.744,1770.126,"--Justice Scalia, that would... the approach that would have litigation go on... and perhaps no President could responsibly agree to attend, which is why putting the President to a task at every step and putting the courts at that task of making a decision about which of the President's duties."
1996.95-1853,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1773.549,1776.961,"But under that rule, the court wouldn't have to make any decision."
1996.95-1853,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,1786.207,1797.807,--You would put the President to the burden of being concerned with litigation constantly and having to raise at each point a refusal to participate or to cut off his testimony.
1996.95-1853,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1798.888,1807.333,"General Dellinger... General, but you're not just talking about when the President is called to testify; you are talking about all the other people in the litigation--"
1996.95-1853,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,1807.333,1808.014,--That is correct.
1996.95-1853,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1808.014,1810.467,--that's what makes it unlike the legislative hearing?
1996.95-1853,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,1810.467,1818.962,The... the absorption of the President with the rest of the trial and the hearing places the Article III judiciary in a very difficult position.
1996.95-1853,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1856.6,1858.05,"Thank you, General Dellinger."
1996.95-1853,2,25205,gilbert_k_davis,,1860.852,1899.377,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1996.95-1853,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1970.293,1971.394,Mr. Davis--
1996.95-1853,2,25205,gilbert_k_davis,,1971.394,1971.705,"Yes, sir."
1996.95-1853,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1971.705,2002.626,"--what do you do when a State court tells the President, you're going to lose this lawsuit unless you appear for a hearing on June 2, and the President says, you know, Your Honor, I have a NATO meeting I'm supposed to go to, heads of State, and you know, you have a testy district judge or local State court judge... you've encountered some of them... and they say, this is my courtroom and, you know, I expect you here on June 2."
1996.95-1853,2,25205,gilbert_k_davis,,2002.626,2003.856,Your Honor--
1996.95-1853,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2003.856,2004.967,And you say there's no remedy for that.
1996.95-1853,2,25205,gilbert_k_davis,,2004.967,2008.708,"--Justice Scalia... no, I say that there is a remedy for that."
1996.95-1853,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2023.551,2026.911,"And who judges that, the judge does?"
1996.95-1853,2,25205,gilbert_k_davis,,2047.006,2051.947,"Justice Ginsburg... I'm not sure who I should respond to first, but--"
1996.95-1853,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2051.947,2052.429,It's the same question.
1996.95-1853,2,25205,gilbert_k_davis,,2052.809,2059.234,"--Justice Ginsburg, there are ample traditional powers."
1996.95-1853,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2099.884,2101.534,But what law would govern that?
1996.95-1853,2,25205,gilbert_k_davis,,2106.028,2110.921,"No, I think first the President must make the claim, if he--"
1996.95-1853,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2110.921,2121.769,"--And what law would control, Federal or State, when a President says I can't be there because I have to do something that's connected with my office?"
1996.95-1853,2,25205,gilbert_k_davis,,2121.769,2144.033,"--I hope I'm not on unsettling ground here, but I would suggest, as Justice O'Connor I think first mentioned, that the Supremacy Clause, the structure... and here is a separation of powers issue perhaps, at least where the Constitution parceled out, structurally, power and gave to the President all executive power."
1996.95-1853,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2155.641,2156.783,And who decides that?
1996.95-1853,2,25205,gilbert_k_davis,,2163.468,2165.979,--I think the simple assertion--
1996.95-1853,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2165.979,2171.043,"--The simple assertion by the President, if he's willing to take the political heat and say, I don't have enough time to come to this hearing--"
1996.95-1853,2,25205,gilbert_k_davis,,2171.043,2172.033,--I think--
1996.95-1853,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2172.033,2173.836,--would you allow that absolutely to control?
1996.95-1853,2,25205,gilbert_k_davis,,2173.836,2178.237,--I would allow it to control with this possible caveat.
1996.95-1853,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2190.636,2193.32,Can't you leave political pressures to take care of that?
1996.95-1853,2,25205,gilbert_k_davis,,2196.322,2196.853,"Well, I would agree."
1996.95-1853,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2196.853,2199.274,What in your view is an interference?
1996.95-1853,2,25205,gilbert_k_davis,,2243.103,2251.308,"I think that the rule here, Justice Breyer, is an actual, imminent interference with his job and a claim that he makes."
1996.95-1853,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2251.308,2253.609,--I've just given you the example.
1996.95-1853,2,25205,gilbert_k_davis,,2259.333,2259.964,"Yes, sir."
1996.95-1853,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2259.964,2261.497,That is an interference?
1996.95-1853,2,25205,gilbert_k_davis,,2261.497,2264.456,I think that may well be an interference.
1996.95-1853,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2271.201,2274.944,"Now, he comes and says that, and how in your view should this be decided?"
1996.95-1853,2,25205,gilbert_k_davis,,2277.358,2279.478,"On the torrent of litigation, or how--"
1996.95-1853,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2279.478,2305.374,"No, how... when the... when your side, for example, takes dozens of depositions, and each one turns up what I call peripheral or satellite issues about who said what to whom where, and where the paper is and where it isn't and so forth, and he says, I don't have time to talk to my lawyers about all of these details because there are so many, and they require so much thought, and that's his claim of interference."
1996.95-1853,2,25205,gilbert_k_davis,,2307.347,2325.546,"--Justice Breyer, if he relates that to his official duties so that it is taking his time and his mental processes away from his official duties, then I think that is an interference that would justify him not--"
1996.95-1853,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2325.546,2329.631,"Well, so you don't defend the judgment of the court of appeals below."
1996.95-1853,2,25205,gilbert_k_davis,,2338.346,2339.227,"--Oh, no."
1996.95-1853,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2339.337,2346.923,"--to go forward, but you take the position that that discovery may not go forward if the President asserts, gee, this is taking my time."
1996.95-1853,2,25205,gilbert_k_davis,,2357.729,2357.91,--No.
1996.95-1853,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2358.901,2363.564,But that is precisely what you just told Justice Breyer is the rule.
1996.95-1853,2,25205,gilbert_k_davis,,2363.564,2364.325,"--No, Your Honor."
1996.95-1853,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2364.325,2366.177,What is the thing you're asserting?
1996.95-1853,2,25205,gilbert_k_davis,,2368.329,2368.569,All right.
1996.95-1853,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2378.083,2381.695,Depositions of third parties out of State?
1996.95-1853,2,25205,gilbert_k_davis,,2381.695,2384.797,--It's hard to conceive that they would be--
1996.95-1853,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2384.797,2398.738,"But if the President comes in and says, look, I want to keep track of this stuff, I need to meet with my lawyer, and I want to see what's going on here, it's interfering with my duties, what is the lower court to do?"
1996.95-1853,2,25205,gilbert_k_davis,,2398.738,2406.412,"--Well, I think the lower court has its function and its duty to decide whether that is a good faith claim."
1996.95-1853,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2406.412,2408.794,"That goes beyond my question, you understand."
1996.95-1853,2,25205,gilbert_k_davis,,2412.397,2420.831,"And if it is not, then you may have a conflict between the person of the President and a judge."
1996.95-1853,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2423.052,2431.067,So the trial court judge at the State court level is to determine whether the offer... the complaint made by the President's lawyer is made in good faith or not?
1996.95-1853,2,25205,gilbert_k_davis,,2431.067,2447.339,"--I think he must make the claim of actual interference with his duties, that as another example, the torrent of litigation has come... is so much, that I am only responding now to civil complaints."
1996.95-1853,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2447.339,2451.293,But don't we know that that's inevitable in a suit like this?
1996.95-1853,2,25205,gilbert_k_davis,,2468.256,2468.726,"Yes, sir."
1996.95-1853,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2468.726,2469.435,--there's an emotional commitment--
1996.95-1853,2,25205,gilbert_k_davis,,2469.435,2469.895,"Yes, sir."
1996.95-1853,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2469.895,2474.129,--that's far more extensive than some time chart would indicate.
1996.95-1853,2,25205,gilbert_k_davis,,2474.129,2475.039,I don't--
1996.95-1853,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2475.039,2477.562,"And I think that's part of what the President is saying, is--"
1996.95-1853,2,25205,gilbert_k_davis,,2477.562,2478.001,--Well--
1996.95-1853,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2478.001,2482.915,--if he's going to defend this lawsuit it will absorb substantial energies.
1996.95-1853,2,25205,gilbert_k_davis,,2482.915,2489.811,"--I don't believe, Justice Kennedy, that the Constitution protects him in his personal capacity."
1996.95-1853,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2489.811,2505.949,"Well, what if the President's attorney came before the Court at the cert stage and asserted in the petition for certiorari this is causing the President to spend too much time on this."
1996.95-1853,2,25205,gilbert_k_davis,,2518.849,2524.252,I don't think the Supreme Court of the United States is a fact-finding body on that subject.
1996.95-1853,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2524.252,2525.483,But the only fact is--
1996.95-1853,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2525.483,2531.206,"--But we have an issue of law that is consuming a great deal of time, effort, and anxiety."
1996.95-1853,2,25205,gilbert_k_davis,,2531.206,2538.012,"Yes, but that issue again is a matter to be addressed to a trial judge, who is--"
1996.95-1853,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2538.012,2541.845,But I thought the only issue was good faith.
1996.95-1853,2,25205,gilbert_k_davis,,2555.723,2564.669,"--Well, I think the court... I think... perhaps I should also suggest that a court suspicious of the good faith of that assertion--"
1996.95-1853,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2564.669,2565.869,"No, let's--"
1996.95-1853,2,25205,gilbert_k_davis,,2565.869,2569.031,"--is entitled to require a showing, just as in the--"
1996.95-1853,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2569.031,2574.754,"--But all of this showing, all of this inquiry goes to the good faith of the request."
1996.95-1853,2,25205,gilbert_k_davis,,2574.754,2577.867,"--Goes to the interference, whether--"
1996.95-1853,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2577.867,2600.403,"Goes to... I thought you were saying it goes to the good faith of the claim of interference, and that is a different thing, I think, that you are allowing thereby from an inquiry into the degree of interference and whether the interference is serious enough to warrant the stay or what-not."
1996.95-1853,2,25205,gilbert_k_davis,,2610.441,2618.624,"--I think as a practical matter, and I'm not suggesting the good faith as a rule of law, as a practical matter in--"
1996.95-1853,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2618.624,2639.88,"Probably try to take it out of the immunity context with respect to lesser officers... you know, the Fitzgerald case has been featured in the briefs and in this argument, but Harlow came down the same day, and in that case this Court said that discovery can be peculiarly disruptive of effective government."
1996.95-1853,2,25205,gilbert_k_davis,,2651.007,2668.249,"--Justice Ginsburg, I believe that the immunity question, if it exists, if the concept that has been suggested to this Court of temporal immunity, if it exists, bars proceedings whether they're pretrial or trial."
1996.95-1853,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2680.796,2681.868,And I asked--
1996.95-1853,2,25205,gilbert_k_davis,,2694.606,2695.047,I don't think it's a privilege.
1996.95-1853,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2701.802,2703.304,Whatever you call it.
1996.95-1853,2,25205,gilbert_k_davis,,2703.304,2705.595,"--Well, I think the best way to call this is a trial."
1996.95-1853,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2713.432,2713.632,"No, no."
1996.95-1853,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2716.313,2723.997,"May I ask a question in that regard about third party depositions, and we're concerned about their impact on the office of the President and so forth."
1996.95-1853,2,25205,gilbert_k_davis,,2745.342,2749.796,--I think the trial judge always has the opportunity and the duty to balance the interests--
1996.95-1853,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2749.796,2753.177,So it would be permissible to him to narrow discovery and the scope of inquiry--
1996.95-1853,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2753.177,2759.5,"--Mr. Davis, I don't think you're answering some of the questions quite as frankly as we might hope you would."
1996.95-1853,2,25205,gilbert_k_davis,,2764.843,2765.865,--I don't think he is bound--
1996.95-1853,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2765.865,2773.411,"And there is a difference between a President's claim simply saying, I can't come now."
1996.95-1853,2,25205,gilbert_k_davis,,2790.352,2829.138,"--I do believe, Chief Justice, that a court has, if it is suspicious of a President's assertion of a claim, has a right to inquire into the bona fides of that claim, and if the court found in its belief that the President did not make that claim and that there... properly that there was not an interference with his duties, I think the court would go... could... can't take any exercise of jurisdiction over his person, but could go forward with the other kinds of remedies that it might have."
1996.95-1853,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2829.138,2832.841,Is that the holding of the Eighth Circuit that we're reviewing?
1996.95-1853,2,25205,gilbert_k_davis,,2832.841,2837.172,"The Eighth Circuit never considered, I don't think, the minutiae--"
1996.95-1853,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2837.172,2840.925,It sounds different to me than what we read in the Sixth--
1996.95-1853,2,25205,gilbert_k_davis,,2840.925,2841.974,--The Eighth Circuit said--
1996.95-1853,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2841.974,2842.475,--in the Eighth Circuit opinion.
1996.95-1853,2,25205,gilbert_k_davis,,2842.475,2854.432,"--No, the Eighth Circuit said that, sensitive to proper judicial case management and sensitive to the interests of the parties, including the President, this case should proceed, and I--"
1996.95-1853,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2854.432,2854.953,Mr. Davis--
1996.95-1853,2,25205,gilbert_k_davis,,2854.953,2858.647,--responding as a sensitivity to those questions.
1996.95-1853,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2858.647,2875.157,"--Mr. Davis, I am unlikely to favor a disposition that allows any judge, Federal or State, to sit in judgment of the President's assertion of whether his executive duties are too important or not."
1996.95-1853,2,25205,gilbert_k_davis,,2923.6,2945.574,"I would not find it acceptable because I think the presumption is that this case, which does not have a risk to it in the likely event that it goes forward... if it were to go forward does not have a risk of interference with the functions of the presidency, and it's a case of a--"
1996.95-1853,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2945.574,2946.966,"Well, what if the President says so?"
1996.95-1853,2,25205,gilbert_k_davis,,2953.272,2955.445,"--Well, Justice Scalia--"
1996.95-1853,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2955.445,2955.796,And he has to make that claim.
1996.95-1853,2,25205,gilbert_k_davis,,2955.796,2971.007,"--he has given depositions, and he has arranged his calendar, and the court would... under the new Federal rules, as I understand it, would have a conference with him, what protections do you need, and would... could enter an order to that, and he gives available dates."
1996.95-1853,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2991.731,2999.836,"But you still insist that the court pass judgment on... if the President can't come to some compromise, you think the court will sit in judgment on whether, indeed, he's too busy?"
1996.95-1853,2,25205,gilbert_k_davis,,2999.836,3003.85,"--Well, his option is just not to obey, because I have a--"
1996.95-1853,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3003.85,3004.301,And suffer judgment.
1996.95-1853,2,25205,gilbert_k_davis,,3004.301,3007.343,--constitutional and statutory function to perform.
1996.95-1853,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3007.343,3008.344,And suffer judgment.
1996.95-1853,2,25205,gilbert_k_davis,,3008.344,3009.564,He could suffer judgment.
1996.95-1853,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3011.775,3023.151,"When you say that the President can in good faith make an assertion of privilege that would be honored if it's in good faith, it seems to me that you give away most of your case."
1996.95-1853,2,25205,gilbert_k_davis,,3044.106,3071.614,"Well, the question came to me initially and my bright line rule was not the good faith rule, it was the actual imminent risk to the President performing his duties, and an assertion of the claim, and we got to the point of the assertion of the claim, and I merely suggested that the... that if the President was not in good faith 10 times in a row, that the court might make an inquiry into that."
1996.95-1853,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3100.485,3107.87,"Mr. Davis, what is at risk for you taking into account two things."
1996.95-1853,2,25205,gilbert_k_davis,,3129.005,3134.049,"--Well, what is at stake, and this is... these interests I think are substantial to the plaintiff."
1996.95-1853,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3178.8,3181.024,"She hasn't alleged anything like that, has she?"
1996.95-1853,2,25205,gilbert_k_davis,,3181.024,3185.124,"No, no, but you asked me what interests are involved in the delay."
1996.95-1853,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3201.266,3204.588,"Well, witnesses' memories also fade, do they not?"
1996.95-1853,2,25205,gilbert_k_davis,,3204.588,3206.458,"--They fade, and they become incapacitated."
1996.95-1853,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3214.793,3226.412,"I thought as far as witnesses' memories were concerned, I thought that Mr. Bennett had conceded that you could have something like Rule 27 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, depositions to perpetuate testimony?"
1996.95-1853,2,25205,gilbert_k_davis,,3226.412,3230.385,"--But discovery depositions, Your Honor?"
1996.95-1853,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3230.385,3230.595,Yes.
1996.95-1853,2,25205,gilbert_k_davis,,3230.595,3232.005,Where leads are developed?
1996.95-1853,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3235.428,3235.598,No.
1996.95-1853,2,25205,gilbert_k_davis,,3243.524,3250.748,"Mr. Bennett I found to be very accommodating, but this Court is going to be enunciating a constitutional doctrine."
1996.95-1853,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3250.748,3266.468,"Well, I'm not so sure about that, because even in the Fitzgerald case Justice Powell had a footnote where he suggested that Congress might pass a law authorizing such a claim against the President."
1996.95-1853,2,25205,gilbert_k_davis,,3275.074,3280.927,That is the remedy that the President... that the President could seek if he fears this interference.
1996.95-1853,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3281.628,3282.079,"No, no."
1996.95-1853,2,25205,gilbert_k_davis,,3294.328,3295.129,"--Oh, I think--"
1996.95-1853,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3295.129,3295.619,--by law.
1996.95-1853,2,25205,gilbert_k_davis,,3295.619,3296.168,--Yes.
1996.95-1853,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3296.168,3297.049,By a mere law.
1996.95-1853,2,25205,gilbert_k_davis,,3297.049,3302.783,I... the justice... Chief Justice Burger was very skeptical of that.
1996.95-1853,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3322.258,3330.402,"And of course Congress can apparently make constitutional by statute what is otherwise unconstitutional under the Commerce Clause, can't it?"
1996.95-1853,2,25205,gilbert_k_davis,,3331.841,3334.542,"Yes, sir, but that--"
1996.95-1853,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3334.542,3341.548,"So even if that were true, it wouldn't be unheard of in our strange jurisprudence."
1996.95-1853,2,25205,gilbert_k_davis,,3341.548,3345.902,"--Justice Scalia, I'm not sure I want to be a part of that."
1996.95-1853,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3345.902,3346.724,"No, but it's true."
1996.95-1853,2,25205,gilbert_k_davis,,3365.778,3367.03,That would be mine.
1996.95-1853,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3375.979,3382.691,"Well, it would if there's a Federal... if the immunity's as a matter of Federal common law and not Federal constitutional law."
1996.95-1853,2,25205,gilbert_k_davis,,3382.691,3385.112,"--Yes, but it is not here."
1996.95-1853,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3437.598,3441.941,"Well, it's often true, and litigants always don't trust one another completely."
1996.95-1853,2,25205,gilbert_k_davis,,3447.455,3454.819,"--This is a very, relatively simple, as far as fact pattern case."
1996.95-1853,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3454.819,3456.769,I'm not asking you to describe the case.
1996.95-1853,2,25205,gilbert_k_davis,,3456.769,3457.07,I--
1996.95-1853,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3457.07,3459.173,I'm asking you to tell me how long you think it will take to try it.
1996.95-1853,2,25205,gilbert_k_davis,,3459.173,3472.37,"--Depending on stipulations, Justice Stevens, I would say 4 or 5 days perhaps, but that's just a guess, and it may... and we don't know if the case will be narrowed by--"
1996.95-1853,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3472.37,3473.972,Why would it take 4 or 5 days?
1996.95-1853,2,25205,gilbert_k_davis,,3473.972,3478.086,"--Well, I'm thinking of what some jurisdictions do."
1996.95-1853,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3501.721,3506.526,"One of the major concerns, of course, is the extent to which you plan to go into collateral matters."
1996.95-1853,2,25205,gilbert_k_davis,,3506.526,3513.491,"--I can't, and I wouldn't bind, because I'm not certain whether they are admissible."
1996.95-1853,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3523.368,3533.717,"Suppose, because there are other parties involved, that it were 10 days of trial, 2 working weeks, and... pick a number... 15 depositions."
1996.95-1853,2,25205,gilbert_k_davis,,3537.256,3537.496,It could very well be.
1996.95-1853,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3539.579,3545.363,"And if it then were in that degree, you think that he'd be entitled to an order deferring the litigation?"
1996.95-1853,2,25205,gilbert_k_davis,,3545.363,3562.466,"--If there was no way, at that time... this is ab initio, but at that time, if there was no other way to accommodate his needs, the presidency's needs for him to perform that job, then a continuance might very well be appropriate."
1996.95-1853,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3562.466,3566.608,"That's something of a perverse incentive, then, because then he has the incentive to ask for a long trial."
1996.95-1853,2,25205,gilbert_k_davis,,3566.608,3567.88,He may indeed--
1996.95-1853,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3567.88,3568.661,Mr. Davis--
1996.95-1853,2,25205,gilbert_k_davis,,3568.661,3569.279,--if he wants to avoid a trial.
1996.95-1853,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3569.279,3604.773,"--Mr. Davis, if we can trust the court to make that judgment, and if we can trust the court to make all the specific judgments on an instance-by-instance basis which you think is the appropriate way, why can't we also trust the court to make a judgment up front that there are going to be so many specific instances, and the so many specific instances are going to be so costly to the President that the only practical thing is to make a blanket judgment now based upon its good judgment?"
1996.95-1853,2,25205,gilbert_k_davis,,3611.308,3620.092,"In an appropriate circumstance, and you're getting to the question of a stay by the district judge as a discretionary matter rather than as a--"
1996.95-1853,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3620.092,3621.815,"Well, they're all discretionary."
1996.95-1853,2,25205,gilbert_k_davis,,3621.815,3623.125,"--Well, I think she did this--"
1996.95-1853,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3623.125,3628.077,"I mean, it's an exercise of the court's discretion in each instance."
1996.95-1853,2,25205,gilbert_k_davis,,3635.843,3640.225,"--Well, the court needs to have a factual basis on which to exercise discretion."
1996.95-1853,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3640.225,3643.628,"Okay, and let's assume that the President's lawyers come in and they provide one."
1996.95-1853,2,25205,gilbert_k_davis,,3643.628,3648.083,If they do provide a factual basis that justifies a continuance--
1996.95-1853,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3648.083,3648.323,Okay.
1996.95-1853,2,25205,gilbert_k_davis,,3648.323,3651.883,--then certainly the court has authority to do it.
1996.95-1853,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3651.883,3652.063,So the only thing--
1996.95-1853,2,25205,gilbert_k_davis,,3652.063,3652.604,That's a matter of discretion.
1996.95-1853,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3652.604,3663.422,"--The only thing we're really arguing about, then, is whether there ought to be a blanket rule that can be invoked simply by saying, I want this deferral for 4 years."
1996.95-1853,2,25205,gilbert_k_davis,,3663.422,3664.241,Exactly.
1996.95-1853,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3664.241,3675.45,"As distinct from a rule in which the President's lawyers are going to come in and say, these are the practical stakes involved, and they therefore justify a 4-year continuance."
1996.95-1853,2,25205,gilbert_k_davis,,3677.011,3678.37,"That's all we're arguing about, yes, sir."
1996.95-1853,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3711.144,3713.16,"Thank you, Mr. Davis."
