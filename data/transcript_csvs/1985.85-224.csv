1985.85-224,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,12.974,"Mr. Kotler, you may proceed whenever you are ready."
1985.85-224,0,31313,jonathan_kotler,,12.974,14.391,Thank you.
1985.85-224,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,96.128,109.304,"The calculation I made, counsel... Their request was for $495,708, is that right, their original request?"
1985.85-224,0,31313,jonathan_kotler,,109.304,113.506,"That took in the number of hours that doubled, the multiplier of two, yes."
1985.85-224,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,113.506,115.891,"And, the court allowed them $245,000."
1985.85-224,0,31313,jonathan_kotler,,115.891,116.541,Yes.
1985.85-224,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,119.177,125.564,"And, what was your offer of settlement?"
1985.85-224,0,31313,jonathan_kotler,,125.564,128.433,"Our last offer of settlement was $25,000."
1985.85-224,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,128.433,129.233,Twenty-five?
1985.85-224,0,31313,jonathan_kotler,,129.233,130.166,"Yes, Your Honor."
1985.85-224,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,171.476,175.345,"Mr. Kotler, you referred to a private 1983 case."
1985.85-224,0,31313,jonathan_kotler,,179.147,180.432,I think there are.
1985.85-224,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,188.938,197.127,You are talking about a case that results simply in an award of a damage judgment to a particular individual?
1985.85-224,0,31313,jonathan_kotler,,197.127,199.643,--I would characterize that as a private 1988 case.
1985.85-224,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,283.816,292.339,Wasn't there some problem about identifying the officers responsible for the unfortunate fracas?
1985.85-224,0,31313,jonathan_kotler,,292.339,293.672,"That is correct, Justice Blackmun."
1985.85-224,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,294.874,298.659,What would you as an attorney have done had you represented the other side?
1985.85-224,0,31313,jonathan_kotler,,298.659,306.849,"--I would have taken discovery as the attorneys for the other side did, and once I found out who was involved, I would have dismissed those that were not involved."
1985.85-224,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,311.734,316.686,Just as you have refused to make a larger offer and got caught under the rule.
1985.85-224,0,31313,jonathan_kotler,,316.686,335.581,"--The offer that we made was within $8,000 of the eventual jury verdict, so I don't think it was that far off, but I don't think I would have continued to have litigated against people that I knew two years before the trial, and that is when it was, two years before the trial, had no liability or not culpability whatsoever."
1985.85-224,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,375.373,379.942,Are all of the officers still employed by the City of Riverside?
1985.85-224,0,31313,jonathan_kotler,,379.942,386.096,"To my knowledge, they are, Your Honor, and the one lieutenant who was found to have culpability is now the chief of police."
1985.85-224,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,448.067,450.919,"Counsel, one last question and I will stop interrupting you."
1985.85-224,0,31313,jonathan_kotler,,456.239,465.612,"That they would be entitled to a contingency or fee based on the prevailing market rates for similar litigation, yes, I would."
1985.85-224,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,468.047,469.916,"So, the amount is irrelevant then."
1985.85-224,0,31313,jonathan_kotler,,475.385,481.64,--I think it would be just as outrageous if it was five times or four times or three times if that is what Your Honor means.
1985.85-224,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,481.64,498.416,"Well, suppose... my premise was, suppose the recovery was for $500,000 and fees were allowed here roughly equal to... I suppose... what a contingency fee basis would be in your state."
1985.85-224,0,31313,jonathan_kotler,,505.338,519.229,"If the result in this case would wind up being contingency fee approximating the same amount here... that would have to be, I guess, in about $600,000 or $700,000 in judgments."
1985.85-224,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,530.904,541.429,"If they would have recovered $500,000, the original fee that asked for was roughly equivalent to the amount of that hypothetical recovery."
1985.85-224,0,31313,jonathan_kotler,,547.665,549.015,In attorneys' fees.
1985.85-224,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,549.015,555.652,That was their request if the calculations in the record are correct.
1985.85-224,0,31313,jonathan_kotler,,555.652,559.556,"I am sorry, Your Honor, I don't seem to understand your question."
1985.85-224,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,560.889,572.963,"Well, Lopez, $316,000 and some odd dollars, Cazares, $173,000, law clerks and others and miscellaneous, an additional $7,000."
1985.85-224,0,31313,jonathan_kotler,,581.219,584.688,"--No, the court didn't cut them in half, the court just refused to award a multiplier."
1985.85-224,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,585.838,586.373,"Oh, I see."
1985.85-224,0,31313,jonathan_kotler,,586.373,591.675,"--The court gave them everything they asked for, every hour they asked for, based on $125 an hour."
1985.85-224,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,591.675,593.36,Four hundred and ninety-five included the multipliers.
1985.85-224,0,31313,jonathan_kotler,,593.36,594.896,"Multiplier of two, yes, Your Honor."
1985.85-224,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,594.896,600.531,"Mr. Kotler, can I ask you a question, because I am a little confused in view of your discussion with Justice Blackmun."
1985.85-224,0,31313,jonathan_kotler,,611.655,612.471,That is correct.
1985.85-224,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,612.471,617.142,"And that would be true however big the verdict was, is that not right?"
1985.85-224,0,31313,jonathan_kotler,,617.142,617.859,That is correct.
1985.85-224,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,617.859,618.511,That is one argument.
1985.85-224,0,31313,jonathan_kotler,,629.783,630.402,No.
1985.85-224,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,635.021,635.737,Yes.
1985.85-224,0,31313,jonathan_kotler,,635.737,637.389,Basically that is where the court begins.
1985.85-224,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,660.088,677.031,"Well, would you ask them to put on evidence in effect that if they had to go out and raise money... every now and then you read in the paper about someone who is raising money to finance an important piece of litigation... he should get paid what a competent counsel would charge if a war chest were created for him or what is it?"
1985.85-224,0,31313,jonathan_kotler,,677.031,678.05,"No, Justice Stevens, I would not."
1985.85-224,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,690.19,696.194,That would always mean the fee would have to be less than the recovery because contingent fees are always paid out of the recovery then.
1985.85-224,0,31313,jonathan_kotler,,696.194,700.146,"Would be less than the recovery, but assuming an award of a million dollars--"
1985.85-224,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,700.146,707.902,"But, if that is the test... Isn't it true in California also that contingency fees are general a percentage of the recovery?"
1985.85-224,0,31313,jonathan_kotler,,707.902,716.091,"--If your question is would it always be less than the total recovery in a case, a private case winding up in money damages only, the answer is yes."
1985.85-224,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,716.091,724.329,"So, what would you do with a case like Carey against Piphus where the court says there is a one dollar nominal damage or just say there are not fees in those cases."
1985.85-224,0,31313,jonathan_kotler,,724.329,734.302,"No, because I think it is clear under the Carey case and under Hensley and under Blum the court, trial court still retains a certain amount of discretion to--"
1985.85-224,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,734.302,735.636,"Well, why not in a case like this then?"
1985.85-224,0,31313,jonathan_kotler,,735.636,745.342,"--I think the trial court had discretion, but I think the discretion must be exercised consistent with the factors and guidelines that this Court said had to be used in the Hensley case."
1985.85-224,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,755.531,757.965,"Well, you are really telling me two different things."
1985.85-224,0,31313,jonathan_kotler,,773.142,773.392,Okay.
1985.85-224,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,778.479,790.77,"Well, if it is not absolute, why isn't it fair to infer in this case... the district judge looked at it and said, well, in view of the time spent the lawyers have to get more than $30,000 and the only way we can figure out how to do it is to move on to a lodestar."
1985.85-224,0,31313,jonathan_kotler,,790.77,792.972,That brings me to my second point.
1985.85-224,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,809.581,814.55,"What do you do with a nominal damage case then if that is the result, a dollar?"
1985.85-224,0,31313,jonathan_kotler,,814.55,818.271,"Well, fortunately, under my theory, you would start with thirty-three cents and then you could raise it."
1985.85-224,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,818.271,819.871,To may 10 or 15 or something like that.
1985.85-224,0,31313,jonathan_kotler,,819.871,821.704,"No, not at all, not at all."
1985.85-224,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1011.077,1016.88,"Well, Mr. Kotler, I thought a moment ago you said that there had been prayers for injunctive relief, at least at the beginning of the suit."
1985.85-224,0,31313,jonathan_kotler,,1016.88,1017.413,That is correct.
1985.85-224,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1025.569,1037.294,"Well, suppose some injunctive relief were granted or some declaratory relief as well as damages, how would you then suggest the court approach the fee problem?"
1985.85-224,0,31313,jonathan_kotler,,1037.294,1039.477,It would depend on the nature of the injunctive relief.
1985.85-224,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1053.803,1066.694,Do you think that it is arguable that even though this is private litigation that the precedential value it sets may have value above and beyond the individual plaintiffs?
1985.85-224,0,31313,jonathan_kotler,,1066.694,1069.096,Is it arguable?
1985.85-224,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1097.664,1100.45,May I ask this question?
1985.85-224,0,31313,jonathan_kotler,,1152.585,1158.572,"Justice Powell, I am saying the record herein shows that that finding is, on its face, absurd."
1985.85-224,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1158.572,1160.005,That that finding is what?
1985.85-224,0,31313,jonathan_kotler,,1160.005,1160.922,Is absurd.
1985.85-224,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1160.922,1161.441,Absurd?
1985.85-224,0,31313,jonathan_kotler,,1161.441,1162.024,"Yes, sir."
1985.85-224,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1163.907,1165.643,Did the Court of Appeals find it clearly erroneous?
1985.85-224,0,31313,jonathan_kotler,,1165.643,1167.143,"No, the Court of Appeals did not."
1985.85-224,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1167.143,1169.595,Did you argue that it was absurd up there?
1985.85-224,0,31313,jonathan_kotler,,1169.595,1170.797,We argued it was erroneous.
1985.85-224,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1174.763,1190.559,"And, two pages later, the Court of Appeals, which I know you don't like these findings, they found the time expended by plaintiffs' counsel in conducting this litigation was clearly reasonable and necessary to serve the public interest as well as the private interest."
1985.85-224,0,31313,jonathan_kotler,,1193.761,1200.165,I think the problem we have in this particular case is there is a finding that the time couldn't reasonably be separated.
1985.85-224,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1239.973,1241.575,May I ask this question?
1985.85-224,0,31313,jonathan_kotler,,1248.629,1249.598,"Yes, I did."
1985.85-224,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1249.598,1252.55,Did the trial court supervise discovery?
1985.85-224,0,31313,jonathan_kotler,,1252.55,1263.006,"There were no motions to cut off discovery as I recall, and there certainly were no attempts to stop depositions."
1985.85-224,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1263.006,1269.66,The district judge in the eastern district of Virginia will not permit discovery to go beyond six months without his prior approval after hearing.
1985.85-224,0,31313,jonathan_kotler,,1272.261,1275.646,Not in the central district that I am aware of.
1985.85-224,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1275.646,1276.831,"Oh, really."
1985.85-224,0,31313,jonathan_kotler,,1276.831,1281.2,I can say that in this particular case discovery--
1985.85-224,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1281.2,1286.687,Lawyers will go on forever in discovery as long as they can run up chargeable hours.
1985.85-224,0,31313,jonathan_kotler,,1286.687,1291.858,"--The problem, Justice Powell, in this case was that there were not multiple discoveries taken of the same people."
1985.85-224,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1295.56,1296.793,All 32 defendants?
1985.85-224,0,31313,jonathan_kotler,,1296.793,1297.66,--Excuse me?
1985.85-224,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1297.66,1299.245,All 32 defendants.
1985.85-224,0,31313,jonathan_kotler,,1299.245,1309.57,"Certainly there was discovery of all 32 defendants and there were different kinds of discovery as to all 32 defendants, but there also was discovery taken of people who were not named as defendants, quite a bit of discovery."
1985.85-224,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1315.723,1324.745,"Mr. Kotler, on the second finding that Justice Powell mentioned about the case serving the public interest, did you challenge that finding in the Court of Appeals?"
1985.85-224,0,31313,jonathan_kotler,,1330.816,1333.049,I can't recall whether we did or not.
1985.85-224,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1334.618,1339.255,"But, would you not agree that we have to accept that as a valid finding of fact for purposes of our decision?"
1985.85-224,0,31313,jonathan_kotler,,1339.255,1342.041,"Only in terms of the record, Your Honor, and the record... There was nothing--"
1985.85-224,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1342.041,1345.076,We can go behind it and read through the record and decide whether we agree.
1985.85-224,0,31313,jonathan_kotler,,1345.076,1350.897,--I don't think the Court is allowed to make findings that are clearly erroneous and to that extent the Court is bound by the record.
1985.85-224,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1363.637,1367.439,How long had these lawyers been out of law school when the litigation began?
1985.85-224,0,31313,jonathan_kotler,,1368.889,1371.541,I believe one was one year and one was two or three years.
1985.85-224,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1371.541,1381.163,Did they have a flat rate of $125 an hour for the entire period or was it a raising scale as they acquired experience?
1985.85-224,0,31313,jonathan_kotler,,1381.163,1389.168,"Mr. Chief Justice, there was absolutely nothing in the record, not word one, as to what their normal billing rate was during any period of time."
1985.85-224,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1389.168,1391.12,It is clear what they charged here.
1985.85-224,0,31313,jonathan_kotler,,1391.12,1391.687,"Yes, sir."
1985.85-224,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1391.687,1395.172,"Or tried to charge, $125 an hour?"
1985.85-224,0,31313,jonathan_kotler,,1395.172,1396.088,That is correct.
1985.85-224,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1416.751,1425.357,"Well, there is a finding, is there not, No. 13, that that is the hourly rate typical in the market for comparable service by comparable lawyers?"
1985.85-224,0,31313,jonathan_kotler,,1428.726,1434.063,"Not only do I think that is clearly erroneous, but I can state for a fact that we did challenge that one in the court."
1985.85-224,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1434.063,1436.599,"And, did the Court of Appeals agree with you or disagree with you?"
1985.85-224,0,31313,jonathan_kotler,,1436.599,1439.149,I don't recall if the Court.
1985.85-224,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1440.701,1442.736,At least they didn't set the finding aside.
1985.85-224,0,31313,jonathan_kotler,,1442.736,1443.769,"--No, they certainly did not."
1985.85-224,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1443.769,1451.592,Did you introduce evidence to the effect that the $125 an hour was unreasonable?
1985.85-224,0,31313,jonathan_kotler,,1451.592,1461.114,"We introduced evidence that... basically attacking the affidavit by the one person who filed an affidavit on their behalf, saying that that is not sufficient."
1985.85-224,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1461.114,1464.4,"But, you had no evidence as to the prevailing rate in the community?"
1985.85-224,0,31313,jonathan_kotler,,1464.4,1468.602,There was no evidence one way or the other as to the prevailing rate in the community.
1985.85-224,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1574.287,1580.541,"Well, counsel, don't you start off in trouble where the defendants are police officers?"
1985.85-224,0,31313,jonathan_kotler,,1584.327,1589.981,"I am focusing on the relief, Your Honor, not the defendants, on the relief obtained by the lawsuit."
1985.85-224,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1589.981,1590.897,Would it be the same?
1985.85-224,0,31313,jonathan_kotler,,1590.897,1594.949,"I don't think so, in this case, there were no policies or practices changed."
1985.85-224,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1613.077,1624.452,"Was there any evidence offered to show what they customarily charge, what their charges were in other cases, these particular lawyers?"
1985.85-224,0,31313,jonathan_kotler,,1624.452,1624.785,Nothing.
1985.85-224,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1662.391,1667.945,Mr. Lopez?
1985.85-224,1,25667,gerald_p_lopez,,1667.945,1670.231,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1985.85-224,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1706.837,1711.741,Suppose they had recovered a jury verdict of $3 million.
1985.85-224,1,25667,gerald_p_lopez,,1716.978,1724.983,"I think that the size of the verdict, just as is true of the nature of the right vindicated, is irrelevant to the finding of social value."
1985.85-224,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1726.167,1727.852,Did you say social value?
1985.85-224,1,25667,gerald_p_lopez,,1727.852,1728.302,--Social value.
1985.85-224,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1784.772,1790.693,"My question was if you had recovered $3 million in this case, not some hypothetical."
1985.85-224,1,25667,gerald_p_lopez,,1790.693,1797.43,"If we had recovered $3 million in this case, it would not by definition add to the social value of the merit of the case."
1985.85-224,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1798.616,1802.734,Did the jury decide the social value of this case?
1985.85-224,1,25667,gerald_p_lopez,,1802.734,1806.286,--By definition when they concluded that these claims were meritorious.
1985.85-224,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1934.385,1940.622,"Are you saying that all cases filed under 1983 have ""social value""?"
1985.85-224,1,25667,gerald_p_lopez,,1940.622,1942.641,"--If, and only if, they win."
1985.85-224,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1942.641,1944.593,If they win.
1985.85-224,1,25667,gerald_p_lopez,,1944.593,1945.993,"If, and only if, they win."
1985.85-224,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1945.993,1947.961,"And, if they don't win, they don't have social value."
1985.85-224,1,25667,gerald_p_lopez,,1947.961,1950.261,For purposes of 1988 that is precisely right.
1985.85-224,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2004.396,2027.944,"Well, do you think there is an argument that these findings and allowances were clearly erroneous in view of the fact that so many of the defendants were found not responsible in the last analysis and that a good amount of the work went to pursuit of their liability?"
1985.85-224,1,25667,gerald_p_lopez,,2027.944,2031.129,"I think that is a very tough practical question, both in this case and in any other case."
1985.85-224,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2031.129,2040.319,And then I think also the fact that the total amount of recovery was so much less than that sought.
1985.85-224,1,25667,gerald_p_lopez,,2048.425,2050.141,"Both go to reasonableness, Justice O'Connor."
1985.85-224,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2156.977,2160.679,"Are you referring to, Mr. Lopez, Judge Pfaelzer's experience in private practice?"
1985.85-224,1,25667,gerald_p_lopez,,2160.679,2166.233,"--And, in her experience on the Police Commission of the City of Los Angeles, yes, both, Your Honor."
1985.85-224,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2265.782,2275.305,"These findings, Mr. Lopez, read plaintiffs' counsel are entitled to be compensated at the prevailing market rates within that area."
1985.85-224,1,25667,gerald_p_lopez,,2282.041,2299.753,"Immodesty aside, Your Honor, Congress recognized and cited Johnson as the case which said that while the years out matter, if someone is good enough to gain the kind of wage that is typically paid to more experienced people, that is what they are to be paid."
1985.85-224,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2299.753,2300.772,Now let's come back to my question.
1985.85-224,1,25667,gerald_p_lopez,,2311.211,2313.263,If they were as good as--
1985.85-224,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2313.263,2315.047,"Never mind, never mind."
1985.85-224,1,25667,gerald_p_lopez,,2320.583,2325.72,--I think that that varies depending on what kind of firm you are working for and what kind of client you are charging.
1985.85-224,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2338.897,2342.849,"Well, is the expertise measured something by the result they got?"
1985.85-224,1,25667,gerald_p_lopez,,2344.466,2357.026,"It is certainly one of the 12 factors that is relevant to the expertise, to be sure, which is why I would like to return to the question of what exactly was the product of these many hours of litigation?"
1985.85-224,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2475.186,2516.513,"Mr. Lopez, you said a moment ago you were interested in what concerned my work beneath the Court's surface or something to that effect and a concern that at least lurks on my part is in my 16 years of private practice you could try a case very, very well for a private client and have every expectation of getting a reasonable fee, the client fully able to pay, and if you get a judgment for $35,000 where perhaps you had expected a judgment for half a million dollars, you simply cannot bill that client a quarter of a million dollars."
1985.85-224,1,25667,gerald_p_lopez,,2516.513,2523.766,--I think that is often the case in litigation outside the boundaries of fee-shifting statutes and 1988 in particular.
1985.85-224,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2534.474,2546.949,"There may be, but are you suggesting then that 1988 was simply... when it used the term ""reasonable fee"" was intending to transmute what the normal experience in private practice was?"
1985.85-224,1,25667,gerald_p_lopez,,2546.949,2548.149,"Absolutely, Your Honor."
1985.85-224,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2656.003,2665.959,"Do you think, Mr. Lopez, that understanding is the same in the authorization for fee shifting, the Fair Labor Standards Act, the Antitrust Act, earlier fee shifting statutes?"
1985.85-224,1,25667,gerald_p_lopez,,2665.959,2675.584,Actually it differs enormously little which is what my study of all the statutes suggests; that is the fee shifting statutes have actually gone back to something like a hundred years ago.
1985.85-224,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3061.415,3071.639,Does the record show why or when you dropped your request for an injunction?
1985.85-224,1,25667,gerald_p_lopez,,3071.639,3085.716,"In our brief we clarify what was actually an incorrect statement, both by petitioners' counsel today and in the in-chambers opinion, that we did not drop the request for injunction before trial."
1985.85-224,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3114.783,3120.604,"You say you got what you wanted, but that still doesn't explain why you dropped the--"
1985.85-224,1,25667,gerald_p_lopez,,3120.604,3129.226,"--We dropped it for the best of reasons, we thought we got what we wanted and that in light of the pervasiveness of the lawless and unconstitutional conduct--"
1985.85-224,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3129.226,3134.28,--I would think your injunction might have been easy to get.
1985.85-224,1,25667,gerald_p_lopez,,3134.28,3143.302,"--Oh, precisely the opposite as perhaps you should know best in light of your opinion in O'Shea and in light of Justice Rehnquist's opinion in Rizzo and then your later opinion in Lyons."
1985.85-224,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3143.302,3145.254,You say you proved they had a policy.
1985.85-224,1,25667,gerald_p_lopez,,3145.254,3146.154,We did.
1985.85-224,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3154.21,3157.495,You mean you can't get an injunction to enjoin a policy?
1985.85-224,1,25667,gerald_p_lopez,,3157.495,3174.207,"Well, in light of Lyons, though I unfortunately disagree with you, you concluded that though there is a policy in place, unless you can demonstrate with some reasonable certainty that you shall again be the product of the unconstitutional policy, that you are not entitled to an injunction."
1985.85-224,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3176.191,3180.51,Did you withdraw your prayer for injunction after the jury verdict came in?
1985.85-224,1,25667,gerald_p_lopez,,3180.51,3181.36,"Yes, we did."
1985.85-224,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3226.623,3229.508,"And, was part of your recovery based on state causes of action?"
1985.85-224,1,25667,gerald_p_lopez,,3229.508,3231.293,"Yes, it was, Justice White."
1985.85-224,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3231.293,3233.579,"And, did you think you should be compensated on those?"
1985.85-224,1,25667,gerald_p_lopez,,3233.579,3253.726,"For the best of reasons, because Congress, both in the Senate report and the House report, the Senate report at page five, I think, and the House report at page seven, affirmed by this Court in Maher v. Gagne, says that you are entitled to both recovery on the basis of your winning pendent claim as well as on your winning civil rights claim so there was little question--"
1985.85-224,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3253.726,3256.326,"Mr. Lopez, I would just like to make one statement."
1985.85-224,1,25667,gerald_p_lopez,,3263.832,3267.367,"--I am not the first and I am certain I am not the best, Your Honor."
1985.85-224,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3267.367,3273.271,"And, if you can show me some other case of this type that took how many years?"
1985.85-224,1,25667,gerald_p_lopez,,3273.271,3274.938,"It took four and a half years, Your Honor."
1985.85-224,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3274.938,3278.39,"That took that long to try, I would like to know of the case."
1985.85-224,1,25667,gerald_p_lopez,,3278.39,3280.258,"It took four and a half years for discovery, Your Honor."
1985.85-224,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3280.258,3283.794,"Well, that took four and a half years of discovery I would like to know."
1985.85-224,1,25667,gerald_p_lopez,,3283.794,3288.863,"I would gladly submit a quite lengthy list of those cases even in the central district, Your Honor."
1985.85-224,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3288.863,3289.763,Do you mean a whole page?
1985.85-224,1,25667,gerald_p_lopez,,3289.763,3291.915,"If you would like it, Your Honor, I would be happy to do that."
1985.85-224,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3291.915,3293.851,"If you could show me one, I would appreciate it."
1985.85-224,1,25667,gerald_p_lopez,,3293.851,3296.719,Actually there are some cited in our brief.
1985.85-224,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3296.719,3298.186,Are they all in Riverside?
1985.85-224,1,25667,gerald_p_lopez,,3298.186,3301.171,"No, they are in the central district, Your Honor."
1985.85-224,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3301.171,3303.04,"Oh, they are all in the central district."
1985.85-224,1,25667,gerald_p_lopez,,3306.509,3306.809,Hardly.
1985.85-224,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3320.55,3323.335,"If you hadn't had it that long, you wouldn't have had that much of a fee, would you?"
1985.85-224,1,25667,gerald_p_lopez,,3323.335,3327.287,"If they hadn't tried to avoid what we are trying to learn, we certainly wouldn't have been in there that long."
1985.85-224,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3328.053,3328.787,Right.
1985.85-224,1,25667,gerald_p_lopez,,3328.787,3340.159,"Petitioners, both here and in their brief, ignore both what Congress did and what the District Court found."
1985.85-224,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3382.922,3386.974,"Do you have anything further, Mr. Kotler?"
1985.85-224,2,31313,jonathan_kotler,,3386.974,3387.992,"Yes, I do."
1985.85-224,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3387.992,3389.226,You have two minutes remaining.
1985.85-224,2,31313,jonathan_kotler,,3389.226,3409.239,"At the outset I would like to point out that the Seventh Circuit two weeks ago in a case called Kirchoff versus Flynn, Seventh Circuit No. 85-2187, set forth a ruling precisely of the nature of the one we want today."
1985.85-224,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3438.424,3439.574,What is the case?
1985.85-224,2,31313,jonathan_kotler,,3439.574,3443.912,"I am sorry, Justice, it is Kirchoff, K-I-R-C-H-O-F-F."
1985.85-224,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3443.912,3446.712,Would you leave the title and citation with the Clerk.
1985.85-224,2,31313,jonathan_kotler,,3446.712,3447.964,I would be happy to.
1985.85-224,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3461.422,3462.79,Was the city held liable?
1985.85-224,2,31313,jonathan_kotler,,3462.79,3465.076,"Yes, there was a judgment against--"
1985.85-224,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3465.076,3467.276,On what theory if there was no policy?
1985.85-224,2,31313,jonathan_kotler,,3467.276,3469.361,--That these officers who were--
1985.85-224,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3469.361,3470.98,Respondent superior?
1985.85-224,2,31313,jonathan_kotler,,3470.98,3471.696,--I believe so.
1985.85-224,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3471.696,3479.149,"They were the persons who had authority to make policy, weren't they, or not?"
1985.85-224,2,31313,jonathan_kotler,,3479.149,3483.62,They were the persons who did what they did.
1985.85-224,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3489.791,3492.309,What is the basis for the judgment against the city?
1985.85-224,2,31313,jonathan_kotler,,3492.309,3497.38,--That the city was negligent and the city violated 1983 claims.
1985.85-224,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3532.736,3534.17,"Thank you, gentlemen."
