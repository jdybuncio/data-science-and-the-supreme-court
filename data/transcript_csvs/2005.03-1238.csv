2005.03-1238,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,8.876,11.243,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2005.03-1238,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,71.112,74.181,"I would have thought that, but we've held otherwise."
2005.03-1238,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,74.181,78.495,"Well, I don't know that we've... I don't know of any case where this Court has held otherwise."
2005.03-1238,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,78.495,89.015,"Well, we've held that they're... that the principal activity consists of doffing... donning and doffing the clothes required, haven't we?"
2005.03-1238,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,89.015,110.972,"Well, this Court said that donning and doffing was a principal activity in contradistinction to a preliminary or postliminary activity for purposes of Section 4(a)(2), but the Court specifically said, in Steiner, that that holding does not apply to matters that are specifically excluded under Section 4(a)(1), which deals with walking time, Justice Scalia."
2005.03-1238,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,110.972,113.46,"So, you think Steiner is irrelevant?"
2005.03-1238,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,113.46,117.21,"For... no, I don't think it's irrelevant to the workplace."
2005.03-1238,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,120.63,123.77,"Well, it is if we don't accept the continuous workday rule."
2005.03-1238,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,131.885,134.042,"Well, we don't have any quarrel with the continuous workday rule."
2005.03-1238,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,149.858,150.379,"No, but your argument--"
2005.03-1238,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,150.379,150.82,--or primary activities.
2005.03-1238,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,150.82,153.689,--assumes that there is only one actual place.
2005.03-1238,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,179.598,181.002,"No, I don't think so."
2005.03-1238,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,201.965,203.579,"So, you're saying that--"

2005.03-1238,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,203.771,207.754,"--so called ""integral activities"" are not principal activities."
2005.03-1238,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,207.754,207.934,Right.
2005.03-1238,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,210.249,210.401,They felt otherwise.
2005.03-1238,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,210.401,228.215,"Mr. Phillips, I... the Steiner opinion explicitly agreed with the lower court in that case, which said that the term ""principal activity or activities"" embraces all activities that are integral and indispensable."
2005.03-1238,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,228.215,228.706,--Right.
2005.03-1238,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,228.706,236.048,"And if... if you think that putting on the clothes fall within that, then that covers walking, too--"
2005.03-1238,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,236.048,236.639,It--
2005.03-1238,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,236.639,237.292,--after that.
2005.03-1238,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,237.292,243.862,--The problem with that analysis is that the court was only analyzing Section 4(a)(2) for these purposes.
2005.03-1238,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,268.105,268.847,"But, Mr. Phillips--"

2005.03-1238,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,302.837,319.036,"Because you have to read the language (a)(1) within the context of what Congress was trying to achieve by the Portal to Portal Act, which was to absolutely and categorically exclude walking time from being part of mandatorily compensated activities of a particular employee."
2005.03-1238,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,319.036,326.951,"But it is included if it's... once the workday begins, if there's a rotation, you walk from one station to the other."
2005.03-1238,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,331.123,331.455,Right.
2005.03-1238,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,332.629,341.444,"So, if your date... if the principal activity is donning and doffing, then the walking time thereafter would also be included."
2005.03-1238,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,341.444,347.353,"--But, Justice Ginsburg, if you step back and think about this language in the context of the words that are written here, it says,"

2005.03-1238,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,354.642,355.024,--Or activities.
2005.03-1238,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,392.517,395.405,"But what do you think about the possibility,"
2005.03-1238,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,426.889,430.038,"Well, there are two parts about that that are worth focusing on."
2005.03-1238,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,477.723,479.258,Not necessarily excluded.
2005.03-1238,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,481.584,485.847,"--Well, except that, under their theory of this case, it is always excluded."
2005.03-1238,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,493.61,494.644,"But ""in certain""--"
2005.03-1238,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,494.644,495.044,--that language.
2005.03-1238,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,495.044,498.223,"--that footnote... that's where I actually got the idea... it says,"
2005.03-1238,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,515.164,515.517,Right.
2005.03-1238,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,515.517,516.388,The Secretary's.
2005.03-1238,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,516.388,527.913,"No, but... and if we were talking about that in the context of other kinds of activities... if you're back in the (a)(2) world of looking at whether something's preliminary or postliminary, I have less of a problem with dealing with that."
2005.03-1238,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,585.004,590.993,"Mr. Phillips, can I call your attention to the text of Section 254(a)?"
2005.03-1238,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,615.306,616.509,Yes.
2005.03-1238,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,616.509,618.887,--for the

2005.03-1238,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,625.717,626.078,Right.
2005.03-1238,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,626.408,627.552,"--Justice Scalia, but... which I think is an important--"
2005.03-1238,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,627.552,627.752,Okay.
2005.03-1238,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,627.752,627.993,--word.
2005.03-1238,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,627.993,629.386,(2)
2005.03-1238,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,651.224,651.694,Right.
2005.03-1238,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,652.165,659.345,"How can we possibly sever (1) and (2) and say that for purposes of one, it means one thing; for purposes of two, it means something else?"
2005.03-1238,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,659.345,670.619,"--Because when the court was interpreting (a)(2) in Steiner, it wasn't interpreting (a)(2) to determine whether something was a preliminary or postliminary activity in connection with ""said preliminary... primary activities""."
2005.03-1238,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,717.35,726.676,"But, Mr. Phillips, it says it... either something is before... preliminary; or after... postliminary."
2005.03-1238,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,740.369,740.85,It's work--
2005.03-1238,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,740.85,741.823,--principal activity?
2005.03-1238,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,741.823,745.292,--that's mandatorily compensable under the Fair Labor Standards Act.
2005.03-1238,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,787.761,790.849,"So, your approach introduces, really, a third concept."
2005.03-1238,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,801.983,802.173,Right.
2005.03-1238,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,813.456,817.509,"Well, unless they were saying those activities were, in fact, principal activities."
2005.03-1238,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,827.821,831.643,"--Well, I don't think that creates any particular problem, but what you end up doing, Mr.--"
2005.03-1238,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,842.825,844.87,"Well, how does... how does your analysis apply?"
2005.03-1238,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,849.285,850.599,--You mean after they've--
2005.03-1238,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,850.599,852.073,"Yeah, I mean, the--"
2005.03-1238,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,852.073,852.734,--arrived at the actual place--
2005.03-1238,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,852.734,856.223,"--the equipment is only good for, you know, an hour, two hours, then they have to get new ones."
2005.03-1238,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,857.507,858.118,--Right.
2005.03-1238,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,858.118,860.858,"--they have to doff the other equipment, don new equipment, and walk back."
2005.03-1238,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,864.248,864.428,No.
2005.03-1238,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,865.381,865.792,Why not?
2005.03-1238,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,865.792,879.462,"--We don't have any quarrel with the argument that once you, for the first time, arrive at your actual place of performing the principal activity for which you were hired, which is cutting beef or whatever it happens to be in your hypothetical... once you arrive there, that does begin the workday."
2005.03-1238,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,891.118,894.116,But do you have compensated activities that do not begin the workday?
2005.03-1238,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,894.116,898.689,"Yes, you do have compensated... and that's true for lots of different situations, Justice Kennedy."
2005.03-1238,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,909.934,919.303,What happens with the microchip or a laboratory with highly contagious viruses where there's got to be two hours of scrubbing and then there's a walk?

2005.03-1238,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,933.114,933.645,--But then there's... but then there's--
2005.03-1238,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,933.645,934.398,"--therefore, it's compensable."
2005.03-1238,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,934.398,935.149,--but then there's a walk.
2005.03-1238,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,935.651,942.061,"The walk is not compensable, because Congress didn't want you to have walking until you got to the actual place where you would perform the services."
2005.03-1238,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,950.357,951.541,But the problem--
2005.03-1238,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,951.541,952.692,"--the understanding of ""principal activity""."
2005.03-1238,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,952.692,967.446,"--Mr. Phillips, the problem I continue to have is that I thought Steiner embraced, explicitly, the notion that principal activity embraces all activities that are integral and indispensable."
2005.03-1238,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,972.071,972.382,No.
2005.03-1238,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,972.382,974.376,--or make some changes in it?
2005.03-1238,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,975.56,980.616,I want you to limit Steiner to the very unusual facts that arose in that particular context.

2005.03-1238,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,990.598,991.058,What we do--
2005.03-1238,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,991.058,993.744,--so unusual about the facts--
2005.03-1238,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,993.744,993.906,--I'm sorry?
2005.03-1238,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,993.906,994.246,--What was so unusual about the facts in Steiner?
2005.03-1238,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,995.06,1005.371,"Well, no, I... the notion that if you didn't shower and change, you would expose not only yourself, but your family and everybody else to the risks of lead poisoning is a pretty extraordinary--"

2005.03-1238,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1016.375,1022.101,"Right, well, I would... I would argue that you could make a... you could make a claim that none of that donning and doffing ought to be compensable."
2005.03-1238,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1042.964,1043.253,But you're--

2005.03-1238,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1045.32,1046.223,"--No, no, I didn't mean... finish."
2005.03-1238,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1046.223,1060.516,"But I still don't think that, even if you accept that that is compensable conduct within the meaning of Steiner, which I... that's what it's talking about... but Steiner, Justice O'Connor, doesn't say anything about the fact that there was going to have to be walking or traveling, or the workday."
2005.03-1238,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1101.108,1101.789,You would say that's--
2005.03-1238,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1101.789,1102.27,--a theory that supports that.

2005.03-1238,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1108.509,1112.511,"Well, sharpening tools is the easiest one, because you do that right on your workplace."

2005.03-1238,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1118.398,1118.71,--but your time shouldn't start from then.
2005.03-1238,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1118.71,1120.052,--that's not the hypothetical.

2005.03-1238,2,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,2960.017,2972.053,"Well, first of all, that question arises not under the Portal Act, which only applies before the principal activities begin and after they end, but under the Fair Labor Standards Act, itself."

2005.03-1238,2,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,3154.163,3169.009,"--It's a required wait anytime, in order to get to the production floor on time, the employee has to be at the donning station in a sufficient period of time to get there, and if there's a wait at that time, then he's being required to wait."
2005.03-1238,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3169.009,3178.086,"Mr. Goldstein acknowledged that that issue, the pre donning wait, was not decided below."

2005.03-1238,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3189.241,3196.051,"But it wasn't, obviously, decided in the first circuit, because they ruled against the employee's position."
2005.03-1238,2,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,3196.051,3196.292,But they said
2005.03-1238,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3203.513,3208.026,But the... but the question of when... what waiting are we talking about?
2005.03-1238,2,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,3215.97,3229.871,"--Well, I'm... my memory, at least, of the court of appeals opinion, is that it was saying that the wait before the donning was not compensable, because it was a preliminary activity."
2005.03-1238,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3234.947,3236.641,Do we have to decide the second question?

2005.03-1238,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3244.926,3245.469,I don't mean that.

2005.03-1238,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3252.37,3253.271,It's a thorough brief.
2005.03-1238,2,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,3253.271,3259.26,"--Justice Breyer, if you do not want to decide that question, you don't have to decide it."
2005.03-1238,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3259.26,3260.594,I don't do things on the ground--
2005.03-1238,2,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,3260.594,3260.955,The Court granted--
2005.03-1238,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3260.955,3261.137,--I'd like it or not.

2005.03-1238,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3268.448,3270.805,"Mr. Gornstein, one thing I'm curious about."
2005.03-1238,2,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,3275.589,3276.02,Forty nine.

2005.03-1238,2,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,3279.429,3279.679,It should have.

2005.03-1238,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3418.98,3419.281,They decided--
2005.03-1238,3,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3419.281,3419.611,--as possible.
2005.03-1238,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3419.611,3420.264,--no waiting time.
2005.03-1238,3,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3436.601,3452.079,"Well, I think, Justice Ginsburg, if they specifically decide that there is no waiting time that's covered here, and the plaintiffs have sought compensation for both pre and post waiting time, then the issue is squarely posed, and they've certainly posed it in their petition, and the court granted it."
2005.03-1238,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3459.762,3469.893,"Well, it seems the court below said waiting time isn't covered, so we're not going to engage in any debate about what... if waiting time is... were covered, which waiting time?"
2005.03-1238,3,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3469.893,3483.152,"--Right, but that just goes to the question... I think it disposes of the issue of, if you have waiting time that otherwise looks to be fairly ordinary preliminary/postliminary activity, it, nevertheless, can be converted into primary activity under their interpretation of the statute."
2005.03-1238,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3552.731,3554.056,"Thank you, Mr. Phillips."
