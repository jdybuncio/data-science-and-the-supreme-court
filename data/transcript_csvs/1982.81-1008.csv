1982.81-1008,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,69.05,"Mr. Martin, I think you may proceed whenever you are ready."
1982.81-1008,0,40008,robert_martin,,69.05,70.971,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1982.81-1008,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,270.531,275.997,"Do you have any regrets in having made that decision to petition for clarification, Mr. Martin?"
1982.81-1008,0,40008,robert_martin,,275.997,289.039,"Well, I think not, because we were in a position in the fall in which we were not getting our tariffs paid, and we had to do something to clarify the problem."
1982.81-1008,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,311.326,314.201,Did you give any consideration to going before the Commission?
1982.81-1008,0,40008,robert_martin,,314.201,319.589,"Well, we did go before the Commission virtually simultaneously."
1982.81-1008,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,343.081,355.933,"Mr. Martin, did the railroads argue below that the CADC should not declare the tariffs unlawful because the San Antonio failed to comply with the filed rate doctrine?"
1982.81-1008,0,40008,robert_martin,,355.933,357.246,"Yes, yes, we did."
1982.81-1008,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,679.601,696.892,"In the Commission procedures is there any practice parallel to the one in probate matters of a dependent relative revocation so that when a subsequent order is set aside, it revives the last proceeding?"
1982.81-1008,0,40008,robert_martin,,696.892,697.922,"No, Your Honor."
1982.81-1008,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,700.0,700.718,"Have they ever ordered, have they ever done that?"
1982.81-1008,0,40008,robert_martin,,700.718,701.218,--No.
1982.81-1008,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,790.886,796.384,"In other words, under the new tariff that nullified any prior tariff?"
1982.81-1008,0,40008,robert_martin,,796.384,800.725,"--Well, what would happen is--"
1982.81-1008,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,800.725,801.319,"I am speaking of the Commission now, not the Court."
1982.81-1008,0,40008,robert_martin,,801.319,803.88,--The Commission wouldn't enter a tariff.
1982.81-1008,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,913.071,933.406,"Do you think that the Court of Appeals, Mr. Martin, was attempting to interpret Commission intent in deciding the effect of its previous order or that its ruling as to the effect of its own decision or order wasn't based on what it conceived to be the intent of the Commission?"
1982.81-1008,0,40008,robert_martin,,933.406,943.731,"It said that it was not based on its own intent or subjective determination as to what the rate level should be, and it said that it was the effect of its order."
1982.81-1008,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1003.675,1008.268,"Mr. Martin, would you clarify one thing for me before you sit down."
1982.81-1008,0,40008,robert_martin,,1027.806,1028.775,"No, ma'am, they did not."
1982.81-1008,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1049.377,1055.234,And did San Antonio ever actually file a complaint with the Commission or just something with the Board?
1982.81-1008,0,40008,robert_martin,,1055.234,1056.107,"No, they did not."
1982.81-1008,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1060.482,1060.825,Okay.
1982.81-1008,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1061.279,1068.838,Mr. Schulder.
1982.81-1008,1,23151,elliott_schulder,,1068.838,1073.101,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1982.81-1008,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1160.894,1163.549,"Well, the Commission didn't think so initially, did they?"
1982.81-1008,1,23151,elliott_schulder,,1163.549,1165.361,"--Well, the Commission--"
1982.81-1008,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1165.361,1171.701,Or did it think that it was being usurped but that it would just knuckle down to it?
1982.81-1008,1,23151,elliott_schulder,,1171.701,1183.712,"--The Commission's initial position was that the legal effect of the Court of Appeals remand decision was to revive the San Antonio I, the earlier Commission order--"
1982.81-1008,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1183.712,1186.368,But its attitude wasn't that that was proper?
1982.81-1008,1,23151,elliott_schulder,,1186.368,1191.49,--Its attitude was that that would create an inequity and that the Court of Appeals should try to correct the inequity.
1982.81-1008,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1191.49,1201.065,"But was its position, however, that the Court had overstepped its authority, or did it take a position on that?"
1982.81-1008,1,23151,elliott_schulder,,1201.065,1204.298,"No, I don't believe it took a specific position on that."
1982.81-1008,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1217.87,1223.836,"But Conrail wasn't the first case of this genre, was it?"
1982.81-1008,1,23151,elliott_schulder,,1223.836,1241.314,"Well, Conrail was... Conrail was the first case in which a majority of this Court held that a reviewing court has no authority at all with which to set rates or determine rate policy in the context of a remanded proceeding."
1982.81-1008,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1440.077,1450.074,"Would you comment just to refresh my recollection on the appealability question, the jurisdictional question as to whether it's timely?"
1982.81-1008,1,23151,elliott_schulder,,1450.074,1463.13,San Antonio has raised the point that the petition in this case was not timely filed because it was filed in excess of 90 days from the Court of Appeals initial remand decision.
1982.81-1008,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1502.849,1516.156,"Was any order entered or any mandate handed down by the Court of Appeals with respect to Judge Wilkie's opinion, or does his opinion stand simply alone on that?"
1982.81-1008,1,23151,elliott_schulder,,1516.156,1520.513,Do you mean on the petition for clarification of mandate?
1982.81-1008,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1520.513,1520.966,Yes.
1982.81-1008,1,23151,elliott_schulder,,1520.966,1521.903,I am not sure.
1982.81-1008,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1521.903,1526.355,"Well, not the petition, but Judge Wilkie's opinion is here, of course."
1982.81-1008,1,23151,elliott_schulder,,1531.79,1534.243,I am not aware one way or the other.
1982.81-1008,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1534.243,1537.757,Is there any mandate from which an appeal is taken; I guess that's my question.
1982.81-1008,1,23151,elliott_schulder,,1537.757,1542.722,I am not aware one way or the other whether there was a subsequent mandate issued at that point.
1982.81-1008,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1544.456,1548.501,Mr. Slover.
1982.81-1008,2,46275,william_l_slover,,1548.501,1551.938,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1982.81-1008,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1827.219,1834.045,"Isn't the Court of Appeals action, however, equivalent to something like an injunction?"
1982.81-1008,2,46275,william_l_slover,,1834.045,1841.134,"Well, I think we would all agree, as the Court said, that the effect of its action was the same."
1982.81-1008,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1870.499,1874.996,Let assume that ultimately it is found that their action was correct.
1982.81-1008,2,46275,william_l_slover,,1889.88,1924.163,"Well, of course, Your Honor, we submit that this Court's decision and the Arizona Grocery case is dispositive on that point, that neither the Commission... in other words, for example, the Commission itself could not have at the end of the proceeding said, we have examined this initial rate and we find that at some point in the past it became unsatisfactory, so we are going to set a rate for the future and also adjust for the past."
1982.81-1008,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1944.531,1945.576,Either way?
1982.81-1008,2,46275,william_l_slover,,1945.576,1947.795,That's correct.
1982.81-1008,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1948.841,1949.075,Either way--
1982.81-1008,2,46275,william_l_slover,,1949.075,1950.247,--it was the other situation.
1982.81-1008,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1950.247,1954.995,"--if the rate proves too low, the railroads can never go back."
1982.81-1008,2,46275,william_l_slover,,1954.995,1958.68,That is exactly what that case says.
1982.81-1008,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1958.68,1959.04,Yes.
1982.81-1008,2,46275,william_l_slover,,1959.04,1985.545,"So the difficulty that we have with the so-called affects test that they're striving to extend Conrail beyond injunctions is that none of the considerations which bothered the court in Conrail... in other words, when a court enters an injunction, it has to decide, one, who is going to win on the merits or the probability of success; and secondly, irreparable injury."
1982.81-1008,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2029.527,2039.602,Do you think that the Court of Appeals here did try to determine what the Commission had intended by its various San Antonio orders?
1982.81-1008,2,46275,william_l_slover,,2039.602,2042.163,--I... I do not know the answer to that.
1982.81-1008,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2071.074,2081.225,"When you say it construed the rate order, I take it then you mean it construed the effect it thought the Commission would want the rate order to have?"
1982.81-1008,2,46275,william_l_slover,,2081.225,2086.255,I simply don't know that I would... that I would go that far.
1982.81-1008,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2121.616,2125.458,What do you do about the filed rate point?
1982.81-1008,2,46275,william_l_slover,,2125.458,2127.3,"Well, in--"
1982.81-1008,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2127.3,2130.159,Because I guess there was a tariff outstanding.
1982.81-1008,2,46275,william_l_slover,,2130.159,2132.252,"--Well, let me say about the filed rate."
1982.81-1008,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2182.857,2183.67,"Well, now--"
1982.81-1008,2,46275,william_l_slover,,2183.67,2184.717,--the priority--
1982.81-1008,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2184.717,2185.246,--he may not have.
1982.81-1008,2,46275,william_l_slover,,2191.571,2192.477,"--Well, it--"
1982.81-1008,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2192.477,2196.18,And do you think that it's properly posed here and--
1982.81-1008,2,46275,william_l_slover,,2196.18,2197.585,--I absolutely do not.
1982.81-1008,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2197.585,2199.99,"--Well, assume we disagree with you."
1982.81-1008,2,46275,william_l_slover,,2202.068,2228.792,"Well, I think that the... the Interstate Commerce Act is very clear because the provision section 107601 that requires the carriers to file the rates is subject to the exception that where there are outstanding rate orders, they have to... they are forbidden from publishing, charging, or collecting any other rate but the rate in the order."
1982.81-1008,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2256.373,2258.936,--But the tariff was filed pursuant to another rate order.
1982.81-1008,2,46275,william_l_slover,,2258.936,2262.138,Which the Court of Appeals vacated.
1982.81-1008,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2262.138,2264.466,"Yes, but the tariff was still there."
1982.81-1008,2,46275,william_l_slover,,2264.466,2268.777,"Well, we... the liability--"
1982.81-1008,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2268.777,2270.402,The tariff was still--
1982.81-1008,2,46275,william_l_slover,,2270.402,2270.715,--of the tariff--
1982.81-1008,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2270.715,2271.074,"--there, wasn't it?"
1982.81-1008,2,46275,william_l_slover,,2271.074,2271.84,"--Well, it was."
1982.81-1008,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2290.755,2298.532,What's the railroad supposed to do when the... after the... is it supposed to withdraw that tariff or file a new one or what?
1982.81-1008,2,46275,william_l_slover,,2298.532,2299.938,--That's what we would submit.
1982.81-1008,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2310.388,2318.244,Are you saying that the net effect then of the Court of Appeals order was that it required the railroads to file a new tariff?
1982.81-1008,2,46275,william_l_slover,,2318.244,2319.884,--Absolutely.
1982.81-1008,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2319.884,2323.039,And you say that's not contrary to the filed rate doctrine?
1982.81-1008,2,46275,william_l_slover,,2323.039,2325.538,"Yes, we would submit that, or an exception."
1982.81-1008,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2328.599,2329.912,May I interrupt with a question there?
1982.81-1008,2,46275,william_l_slover,,2329.912,2330.349,"--Yes, sir."
1982.81-1008,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2330.349,2334.861,"Under your view, could they, the railroads, have immediately refiled the existing tariffs?"
1982.81-1008,2,46275,william_l_slover,,2334.861,2335.908,They could not have.
1982.81-1008,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2338.454,2340.937,Could they have filed any tariff above the San Antonio I rate?
1982.81-1008,2,46275,william_l_slover,,2340.937,2341.531,--Yes.
1982.81-1008,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2357.416,2361.008,"Well, then they could not have exceeded the San Antonio I rate, under your view?"
1982.81-1008,2,46275,william_l_slover,,2361.008,2361.32,--Yes.
1982.81-1008,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2366.599,2370.441,So there just is no room for a filed tariff; it wouldn't have done any good to file another tariff?
1982.81-1008,2,46275,william_l_slover,,2370.441,2374.659,"They could have filed one after San Antonio, but we take--"
1982.81-1008,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2374.659,2375.611,No; why would they do that?
1982.81-1008,2,46275,william_l_slover,,2375.611,2383.904,--that the... that the order is in effect; you either file at the order or the order supplants the tariff.
1982.81-1008,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2383.904,2387.075,"Well, but they have to file tariffs."
1982.81-1008,2,46275,william_l_slover,,2393.994,2398.961,"They have to conform their tariff to that order, which at that point was the only viable order."
1982.81-1008,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2456.938,2459.795,"But that's really what the filed rate doctrine is all about, isn't it?"
1982.81-1008,2,46275,william_l_slover,,2459.795,2464.059,"--I... I do not see it as that, no."
1982.81-1008,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2464.059,2468.792,"Well, do you think you could pay some other rate than the filed rate?"
1982.81-1008,2,46275,william_l_slover,,2468.792,2480.725,"We believe that if you have... in other words, there are cases that if you have loss and damage, if your goods are set off, that you can set off--"
1982.81-1008,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2480.725,2486.801,"Yes, but supposing it's just a disagreement about the reasonableness of a filed rate."
1982.81-1008,2,46275,william_l_slover,,2486.801,2491.595,--Then we submit that we could... we could withhold payment pending litigation.
1982.81-1008,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2495.407,2496.436,Is there some case in this Court that supports that?
1982.81-1008,2,46275,william_l_slover,,2496.436,2503.981,"--Well, in many of the cases that have been cited in the brief, that is what in fact took place."
1982.81-1008,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2522.989,2532.047,But the Court of Appeals left open the possibility that the San Antonio II and III... is that what you call them?
1982.81-1008,2,46275,william_l_slover,,2532.047,2532.626,Yes.
1982.81-1008,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2532.626,2537.109,"San Antonio II and III rates, or the San Antonio III rates, could be reestablished by the Commission?"
1982.81-1008,2,46275,william_l_slover,,2537.109,2539.919,"Yes, Your Honor, but not retroactively."
1982.81-1008,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2539.919,2541.731,"Well, I don't know."
1982.81-1008,2,46275,william_l_slover,,2552.133,2556.554,"But, Your Honor, that's a critical distinction in this case."
1982.81-1008,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2559.865,2561.037,I understand.
1982.81-1008,2,46275,william_l_slover,,2561.037,2562.162,And so while it's true--
1982.81-1008,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2562.162,2562.506,I understand that.
1982.81-1008,2,46275,william_l_slover,,2573.439,2574.048,--That's correct.
1982.81-1008,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2574.048,2578.452,"And I suppose on the remand, if the Commission wanted to, it could have suspended that tariff."
1982.81-1008,2,46275,william_l_slover,,2578.452,2587.057,"Well, of course, at the time this litigation came up, as you mentioned in the direct arguments, the Commission was taking our position."
1982.81-1008,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2587.057,2587.775,"Yes, I know."
1982.81-1008,2,46275,william_l_slover,,2587.775,2596.929,"They had attempted to file tariffs, and they did take the position that we espouse; namely, that tariffs in conflict with the rate order could not be filed."
1982.81-1008,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2597.616,2600.303,"Well, it's already filed."
1982.81-1008,2,46275,william_l_slover,,2600.303,2605.722,"--Well, they were filed, but we consider them to be null and void--"
1982.81-1008,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2605.722,2609.174,The Commission never ordered them suspended or revoked or withdrawn.
1982.81-1008,2,46275,william_l_slover,,2609.174,2616.608,--But they... we concluded that they were null and void because they were in conflict with the outstanding rate order.
1982.81-1008,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2648.299,2654.063,Assume hypothetically that this Court reverses the Court of Appeals.
1982.81-1008,2,46275,william_l_slover,,2664.182,2673.351,"Well, as we see it, if you reverse the Court of Appeals, you would have to also reverse yourself in Arizona Grocery."
1982.81-1008,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2673.695,2676.724,"Well, let's lay that aside for the moment."
1982.81-1008,2,46275,william_l_slover,,2694.624,2710.898,"--Well, as you understand, this... this... this proceeding is going on in various continuing facets, and I presume that if you were to reverse, this disputed period would become part of that ongoing proceeding."
1982.81-1008,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2716.255,2733.811,"May I ask you, I know you rely heavily on Arrizona Grocery, but isn't that a case in which the court held that reparations could not be granted when the rate had previously been determined to be lawful by the Commission and the Commission later changed its mind?"
1982.81-1008,2,46275,william_l_slover,,2733.811,2745.525,"--Well, as Mr. Justice White mentioned, I think that's... the Arizona Grocery situation is something of the reverse of this situation where the Commission prescribed a higher rate--"
1982.81-1008,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2745.525,2746.211,Yes.
1982.81-1008,2,46275,william_l_slover,,2746.211,2748.195,--and then they prescribed a lower rate.
1982.81-1008,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2748.195,2751.163,"After the shipments had already taken place, pursuant--"
1982.81-1008,2,46275,william_l_slover,,2751.163,2751.413,Right.
1982.81-1008,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2751.413,2754.396,--to the first rate which had been approved before the shipment took place.
1982.81-1008,2,46275,william_l_slover,,2754.396,2757.91,And they... they tried to get the carrier to ante up the difference--
1982.81-1008,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2757.91,2759.785,"No, I think the--"
1982.81-1008,2,46275,william_l_slover,,2759.785,2760.504,--to lower--
1982.81-1008,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2760.504,2760.768,"--Oh, I see."
1982.81-1008,2,46275,william_l_slover,,2760.768,2763.626,--down the difference of the second shipment.
1982.81-1008,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2763.626,2764.798,The shipper sued for reparations.
1982.81-1008,2,46275,william_l_slover,,2764.798,2765.33,Right.
1982.81-1008,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2765.33,2767.234,And their claim was disallowed.
1982.81-1008,2,46275,william_l_slover,,2767.234,2768.078,Correct.
1982.81-1008,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2768.078,2772.968,"Now, why is that inconsistent with your position here... I mean with the position of your opponents here?"
1982.81-1008,2,46275,william_l_slover,,2772.968,2787.572,"Well, in both cases this... well in the Arizona case and, as we submit, the fact, the situation in this case, the rate order cannot be retroactively adjusted."
1982.81-1008,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2788.756,2791.849,"Well, after it has been finally approved by the Commission then."
1982.81-1008,2,46275,william_l_slover,,2795.848,2814.451,"--Well, we... we claim that the San Antonio I rate order is the only legitimate valid rate order that's stood the test of... of administrative procedure and was sanctioned by a reviewing court."
1982.81-1008,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2830.349,2831.162,"Well, I understand your argument."
1982.81-1008,2,46275,william_l_slover,,2836.926,2859.714,"Well, we take our actions in many ways were guided by this Court's discussion in Arizona Grocery where it said, where the Commission prescribes a rate, it speaks in its legislative capacity, and it says $10, and that $10 must govern."
1982.81-1008,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2941.821,2942.728,Let me try again.
1982.81-1008,2,46275,william_l_slover,,2942.728,2944.196,Yes.
1982.81-1008,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2944.196,2954.426,"If we were to reverse the Court of Appeals and vacate its judgment, then is San Antonio III rate structure the prevailing rate for this whole period?"
1982.81-1008,2,46275,william_l_slover,,2954.426,2956.378,Yes.
1982.81-1008,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3012.386,3022.851,"And if we affirm the Court of Appeals, then San Antonio I rates are applicable and it's open to them to try to get--"
1982.81-1008,2,46275,william_l_slover,,3022.851,3023.241,Correct.
1982.81-1008,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3034.128,3043.779,"--But that still leaves a couple of years of rates at the San Antonio I level long after the San Antonio I tariff was filed, doesn't it?"
1982.81-1008,2,46275,william_l_slover,,3043.779,3049.012,"--No, it leaves, I think, the time period is... is about six or seven months or eight months."
1982.81-1008,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3049.667,3051.152,How much money would be involved?
1982.81-1008,2,46275,william_l_slover,,3051.152,3055.853,--I believe the figure has been computed at approximately $19 million.
1982.81-1008,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3164.698,3168.166,May I ask one other question about the consequences of an affirmance?
1982.81-1008,2,46275,william_l_slover,,3177.866,3183.379,"Well, we had some doubts about it, but those doubts did not--"
1982.81-1008,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3183.379,3186.16,"In other words, what I am really asking is if you were... are you entitled to--"
1982.81-1008,2,46275,william_l_slover,,3186.16,3188.877,--No.
1982.81-1008,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3188.877,3191.112,--recover the excess--
1982.81-1008,2,46275,william_l_slover,,3191.112,3191.673,We're really--
1982.81-1008,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3191.673,3194.891,"--of over the San Antonio I rate for the period subsequent to May 7, '81?"
1982.81-1008,2,46275,william_l_slover,,3194.891,3202.512,"--Well, that issue is pending at the Interstate Commerce Commission as to what the--"
1982.81-1008,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3202.512,3204.417,It seems to me one possible--
1982.81-1008,2,46275,william_l_slover,,3204.417,3204.886,--They are now--
1982.81-1008,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3204.886,3211.9,--consequence of your view would be that the revival of the San Antonio I rates required that that be the ceiling until--
1982.81-1008,2,46275,william_l_slover,,3211.9,3213.179,--It was vacated.
1982.81-1008,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3213.179,3213.617,--today.
1982.81-1008,2,46275,william_l_slover,,3213.617,3221.364,"And... no, it... we... we take the position that that be the ceiling until it was properly vacated."
1982.81-1008,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3224.16,3228.674,"And that was consistent in your view, with... they were permitted to do that under the Court of Appeals mandate?"
1982.81-1008,2,46275,william_l_slover,,3228.674,3235.483,They were permitted to get to work on that the afternoon of Judge Wilkie's decision.
1982.81-1008,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3249.15,3256.177,"But for purposes of our analyzing your argument here, we can assume that you accept the validity of the May 7th action of the--"
1982.81-1008,2,46275,william_l_slover,,3256.177,3256.677,--That is correct.
1982.81-1008,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3256.677,3257.786,"--May 7, '81, action of the Commission?"
1982.81-1008,2,46275,william_l_slover,,3257.786,3258.224,"Yes, Your Honor."
1982.81-1008,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3258.224,3278.263,"Well, could, that afternoon without a hearing or anything else, could the Commission have amended its San Antonio I order to the extent that it just permitted the... well could it just have withdrawn it that afternoon?"
1982.81-1008,2,46275,william_l_slover,,3278.263,3281.012,We would have argued that they could not have.
1982.81-1008,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3296.568,3303.33,You don't think they could have done something to the order that would have permitted the railroads to file new tariffs immediately?
1982.81-1008,2,46275,william_l_slover,,3303.33,3309.126,"Well, I guess the question there is one of how much they could have done."
1982.81-1008,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3348.766,3360.105,I take it the Commission's position now is that the railroad tariffs that were filed based on San Antonio III are still in effect?
1982.81-1008,2,46275,william_l_slover,,3360.105,3369.475,"Well, as has been pointed out, the Commission's position is a little like a chameleon here."
1982.81-1008,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3379.472,3388.672,"Well, at some point in this proceeding the Commission took the position that the railroad tariffs that were on file were the governing rates."
1982.81-1008,2,46275,william_l_slover,,3388.672,3389.233,--Right.
1982.81-1008,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3389.233,3396.715,And that is in effect saying the railroad should be permitted to file a new tariff at the San Antonio III level.
1982.81-1008,2,46275,william_l_slover,,3396.715,3397.949,That's correct.
1982.81-1008,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3399.793,3402.166,"Do you have anything further, Mr. Martin?"
1982.81-1008,3,40008,robert_martin,,3402.166,3413.037,I'd just like to address a couple of the questions that have been raised.
1982.81-1008,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3465.766,3466.671,"Wait a minute, now."
1982.81-1008,3,40008,robert_martin,,3473.794,3478.635,"--From 1978 to '79, the San Antonio II level was charged."
1982.81-1008,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3483.837,3484.665,May '80.
1982.81-1008,3,40008,robert_martin,,3484.665,3485.65,Yes.
1982.81-1008,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3486.603,3493.256,"Now, the Commission cannot get the railroads to give up any of those collected rates?"
1982.81-1008,3,40008,robert_martin,,3493.256,3493.912,"Yes, sir."
1982.81-1008,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3493.912,3495.802,On what basis?
1982.81-1008,3,40008,robert_martin,,3495.802,3503.862,Because the issue of the validity of the maximum rate that the railroads charged from '78 to '80 was the question that was before the Commission in San Antonio III.
1982.81-1008,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3521.026,3523.946,I take it your colleague on the other side doesn't agree with that.
1982.81-1008,3,40008,robert_martin,,3533.85,3540.846,"--No, if that's what he said he's wrong, because the problem is with respect to the hole in the middle."
1982.81-1008,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3584.266,3589.529,"If the Court of Appeals is reversed, the status quo ante is restored, I take it?"
1982.81-1008,3,40008,robert_martin,,3589.529,3592.34,"The carrier's tariff is on file today, Your Honor."
1982.81-1008,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3603.148,3607.694,Can they recover from San Antonio the shortfall in the interim?
1982.81-1008,3,40008,robert_martin,,3607.694,3614.91,"If you reverse, we will be able to go back and collect from them for that interim period of nine months our tariff."
1982.81-1008,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3738.345,3739.892,"Thank you, gentlemen."
