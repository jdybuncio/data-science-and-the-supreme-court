2009.08-1394,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,5.791,"We'll hear argument next today in Case 08-1394, Skilling v. United States."
2009.08-1394,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,7.027,15.883,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The dramatic collapse of Enron had profound reverberations experienced throughout the Houston economy and citizenry."
2009.08-1394,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,73.186,92.243,"What do we take from trial counsel at the end of the voir dire process announcing that if he had had extra preemptory challenges, he would have used them only against 6 of the 12 people that were finally selected?"
2009.08-1394,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,101.282,106.89,"--Well, Your Honor, to be clear even one juror who should have been excluded and wasn't would have been enough, but--"
2009.08-1394,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,106.89,107.842,That's a different -- that's a different question.
2009.08-1394,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,107.842,108.216,--Sure.
2009.08-1394,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,108.216,120.211,"You are taking a broader proposition and saying that the presumption could not under any set of circumstances be overcome, and that's what I'm trying to probe."
2009.08-1394,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,120.211,120.788,"Yes, Justice Sotomayor."
2009.08-1394,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,135.969,136.343,I'm sorry.
2009.08-1394,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,152.636,171.863,"--That's right, and that's what I was trying to say, Your Honor, that the reason why trial counsel identified six specific jurors was that there were six other jurors who would have been on the venire as to whom we had applied -- as to whom we had asserted a cause challenge that was denied, and because of that we had to use a preemptory to strike those jurors, which left us without--"
2009.08-1394,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,171.863,173.813,But that means that there were six that were okay.
2009.08-1394,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,173.813,174.453,"--Well, no."
2009.08-1394,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,196.228,204.741,"Tell me what in the process itself, outside of your general proposition that no process could find fair jurors?"
2009.08-1394,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,207.567,211.829,"The process was deficient in a couple of respects, Your Honor: First, with respect to time and scope."
2009.08-1394,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,308.947,316.13,"But he did -- he did give time for counsel to ask additional questions, trial counsel."
2009.08-1394,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,316.13,316.489,--He -- he did.
2009.08-1394,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,316.489,320.895,He asked both sides if they had additional questions.
2009.08-1394,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,320.895,328.894,"He gave some time, Justice Ginsburg, but he made clear before the voir dire began that that opportunity was going to be limited both in time and scope."
2009.08-1394,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,384.667,389.18,"You made a change of venue motion at the outset, right?"
2009.08-1394,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,389.18,390.556,We did.
2009.08-1394,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,391.679,404.813,And I'm unaware of any case in which we have said a change is mandatory when what's involved is money rather than life or limb.
2009.08-1394,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,408.299,428.491,"--Sure, it was, Your Honor, and by no means would we in any way diminish the -- the profound human tragedy that accompanied the Oklahoma City case, but I think the reality of the sentiment on the ground in Houston was that Houston citizens, as we pointed out in our brief, in fact referred to the -- to what happened in the wake of the collapse of Enron in terms that were similar to the way they referred to terrorist attacks."
2009.08-1394,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,431.442,436.114,"Well, what was remarkable about some of those questionnaires, there were a lot of people didn't read the newspapers."
2009.08-1394,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,440.299,451.015,"That's true, Justice Ginsburg, but I'd like to clarify one aspect of that, if I could, and that's that our argument is not -- and it hasn't been at any point in this proceeding -- that pretrial publicity caused the passion and prejudice in the community."
2009.08-1394,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,510.021,510.911,But there was some follow-up to that.
2009.08-1394,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,510.911,519.532,"--There -- there was a bit of follow-up to that, Your Honor, but I think the nature of the follow-up is -- is quite illuminating on what we think are some of the fatal flaws in this voir dire process."
2009.08-1394,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,520.269,538.121,"Do you really think that if -- if there had been a much more lengthy voir dire and if the trial judge had been more willing to -- to grant motions to dismiss for cause, that it would have -- that it would not have been possible to find a fair and impartial jury in the district?"
2009.08-1394,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,538.121,542.617,"--Well, our first -- certainly, there should have been a more intensive voir dire, Justice Alito."
2009.08-1394,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,593.798,609.401,"Well, rule 21 says that the judge must grant a transfer if the judge is satisfied that a prejudice against -- that so great a prejudice against the defendant exists in the transferring district that the defendant cannot obtain a fair and impartial trial there."
2009.08-1394,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,609.401,610.134,Correct.
2009.08-1394,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,610.134,619.679,"Well, doesn't that suggest that if you could find a fair and impartial jury with an adequate voir dire, then the transfer need not be granted?"
2009.08-1394,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,619.679,624.503,"Well, I think it has to be read against the context of whether we can be confident that you can find that fair and impartial jury."
2009.08-1394,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,648.509,649.211,Because you think--
2009.08-1394,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,649.211,649.523,And that's the danger here.
2009.08-1394,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,649.523,649.991,"--they're going to lie, right?"
2009.08-1394,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,649.991,650.49,I'm sorry.
2009.08-1394,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,650.49,651.945,Because you think they're going to lie?
2009.08-1394,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,651.945,652.6,"No, that's--"
2009.08-1394,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,652.6,657.567,"When they fill out the form and say this is what I've heard, and this -- I can fairly evaluate the law and the arguments?"
2009.08-1394,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,657.567,658.301,"--No, no."
2009.08-1394,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,743.809,747.649,Was there a challenge for cause against her?
2009.08-1394,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,747.649,756.494,"--There -- there wasn't a specific challenge for cause against her, Your Honor, but -- but again, we challenged everybody on the basis that voir dire wouldn't adequately ferret out biases in this case."
2009.08-1394,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,819.233,824.465,"How do you say we -- in your opinion, if we agreed with your basic idea -- if, which is totally hypothetical."
2009.08-1394,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,824.465,824.919,Sure.
2009.08-1394,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,824.919,828.478,"If we agreed with that, how would we sketch the lines?"
2009.08-1394,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,844.611,845.613,Right.
2009.08-1394,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,845.613,848.065,And judges have to -- have to run their trials.
2009.08-1394,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,867.383,869.852,"Justice Breyer, it is by nature a contextual inquiry."
2009.08-1394,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,882.502,883.002,"See, the problem with--"
2009.08-1394,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,883.002,885.22,--I'm sorry.
2009.08-1394,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,886.047,886.484,--No.
2009.08-1394,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,887.436,895.621,"I -- I -- anticipating what you might feel, which is that that language may not be self-evident as to the circumstances in which a deeper inquiry is--"
2009.08-1394,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,895.621,898.027,I didn't ask you -- I just asked you to do your best.
2009.08-1394,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,898.027,898.838,"--Yes, and that--"
2009.08-1394,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,898.838,900.261,So we've got the wave of public passion--
2009.08-1394,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,900.261,900.729,--Wave--
2009.08-1394,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,900.729,901.634,--And what about the second half?
2009.08-1394,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,901.634,914.018,"--Wave of public passion, and I guess the substrata that I would put beneath that, especially for this category of cases, is pervasive animus directed towards the defendant as responsible for a harm felt by the entire community."
2009.08-1394,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,914.018,914.205,All right.
2009.08-1394,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,928.353,941.817,"I think what the trial court has to do is two things, Your Honor: First, for a juror who has laid bare his or her biases, that juror should not be allowed on the panel, and an assurance of fairness from that sort of juror isn't enough."
2009.08-1394,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,960.371,966.838,"What happens if -- I gather -- that a -- that a trial judge has a panel in front of him and people say, yes, I think he is guilty?"
2009.08-1394,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,986.611,994.172,"To be clear, Justice Breyer, that ordinary practice would only be altered in the very rare category of cases that involve a wave of public passion."
2009.08-1394,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1052.88,1053.492,--Can I look at--
2009.08-1394,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1053.492,1054.538,--in order to ferret out biases that may be latent.
2009.08-1394,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1054.538,1063.393,--Is there any place in the record I could look to see questions that you would have posed absent the judge's limitations?
2009.08-1394,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1063.393,1067.187,"There are, Justice Sotomayor."
2009.08-1394,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1070.073,1070.404,I'm sorry.
2009.08-1394,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1070.685,1071.106,--I'm sorry.
2009.08-1394,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1104.856,1108.854,"Counsel, can I -- perhaps it's time for you to shift gears, if I could--"
2009.08-1394,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1108.854,1109.509,--Sure.
2009.08-1394,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1109.509,1111.119,--and move to the statutory question.
2009.08-1394,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1111.119,1111.556,Sure.
2009.08-1394,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1111.556,1113.681,I don't understand why it's difficult.
2009.08-1394,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1127.096,1138.216,"Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I think part of the problem with that sort of rendition is that that -- I think nobody suggests that any dishonest conduct falls within the compass of this law, that no pre-McNally case suggests that."
2009.08-1394,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1142.358,1145.528,"No, there has to be -- there has to be a right to honesty."
2009.08-1394,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1149.088,1167.658,"--But I don't think that you've advanced the ball, with all due respect, that much by saying there has a right to honest services, because I think what -- at the end of the day, what that would mean is that any situation in which there's a fiduciary duty or even if there's not a fiduciary duty, but at least any situation in which there is a fiduciary duty, a nondisclosure of deception would give rise to a Federal felony prosecution."
2009.08-1394,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1251.481,1251.98,I'm sorry.
2009.08-1394,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1253.029,1255.513,"--A disclosed interest, where the interest is disclosed."
2009.08-1394,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1283.609,1286.312,And I thought part of the government's theory was not--
2009.08-1394,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1286.312,1286.748,--an honest services prosecution.
2009.08-1394,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1286.748,1289.213,--wasn't limited to the compensation.
2009.08-1394,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1335.427,1343.018,"I think, Justice Ginsburg, the government's theory on how the honest services fraud statute applies in this case is laid out at page 49 and 50."
2009.08-1394,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1356.308,1357.451,What 49 and 50?
2009.08-1394,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1358.48,1359.478,--Of the government's brief.
2009.08-1394,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1403.489,1405.879,May I -- I just don't -- because I'm looking at page 50.
2009.08-1394,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1418.467,1423.073,"--It -- it does, Your Honor, but the interest at issue -- and I'm reading from page 50."
2009.08-1394,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1458.542,1459.743,"Why -- why do you put in the i.e.> [""]?"
2009.08-1394,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1462.493,1464.695,"--Because the stock is the compensation, Your Honor."
2009.08-1394,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1480.671,1482.251,I think we'll ask the government to do that.
2009.08-1394,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1482.251,1499.713,"And the danger with that theory is that it would have the capacity to convert almost any workplace lie into a Federal felony, for the following reason: That, in a variety of situations, an employee might -- might engage in an act of deception to his employer with respect to a work-related matter."
2009.08-1394,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1536.29,1539.04,What you've just explained is why you think the statute is very broad.
2009.08-1394,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1540.756,1542.678,"--Well, there are two different arguments, Your Honor."
2009.08-1394,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1569.807,1571.901,"Thank you, counsel."
2009.08-1394,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1574.556,1598.499,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: When Judge Lake approached this case with the question of how to select a jury, he had 15 years of experience in selecting juries, and he informed the parties that it was his experience that voir dire conducted by the trial judge is more effective at eliciting the potential biases of a juror than the oftentimes tendentious voir dire that's conducted by the parties."
2009.08-1394,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1626.942,1636.686,Can you tell me of any other high-profile case comparable to this in which the voir dire lasted only 5 hours?
2009.08-1394,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1636.686,1642.824,"--Judge -- Justice Sotomayor, I'm not familiar with the length of voir dire in particular cases."
2009.08-1394,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1644.088,1648.838,Are you aware of any that's been reported where the selection was 5 hours only?
2009.08-1394,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1648.838,1654.945,"--No, I'm not aware of any, but I don't think that there is any problem with this voir dire, and I think there is really--"
2009.08-1394,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1654.945,1655.662,There's no problem?
2009.08-1394,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1755.415,1768.927,"--Well, Justice Breyer, I think that there was a fair trial in this case, and I think that a full reading of the voir dire reveals that individuals sitting from this vantage point with a cold record who were not there may have different viewpoints about--"
2009.08-1394,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1768.927,1781.078,"I'd never heard of an instance where a trial judge would not challenge for cause -- but I'm not saying it doesn't happen -- where the juror herself is a victim of the offense to the tune of $50,000 to $60,000."
2009.08-1394,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1787.139,1789.232,--I don't think that there's any per se disqualification.
2009.08-1394,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1800.025,1802.583,How -- but is it occasional or accidental?
2009.08-1394,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1839.149,1840.522,"Well, none sat in this case."
2009.08-1394,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1842.787,1844.6,"Well, but -- but the judge didn't strike her for cause."
2009.08-1394,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1848.987,1855.142,I don't think that a -- what this Court may perceive as an error in the denial of one for-cause challenge--
2009.08-1394,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1855.142,1856.205,"No, but it's not just one."
2009.08-1394,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1877.446,1887.894,"--Well, Justice Breyer, I think that reading the entire voir dire reflects that the judge was interested in determining whether these jurors were qualified to sit."
2009.08-1394,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1929.329,1929.657,Excuse me.
2009.08-1394,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1931.096,1932.375,--935a.
2009.08-1394,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1934.922,1937.952,"Go ahead with it, but they didn't challenge 63 for cause, so I guess they waived it."
2009.08-1394,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1937.952,1944.386,"They did not challenge 63 for cause, but they -- but they came to this Court today and tried to use 63 as an object lesson of what was wrong with the voir dire."
2009.08-1394,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2045.754,2050.222,Let's try juror number -- let's try 76: Judge:
2009.08-1394,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2073.067,2084.766,"Well, Justice Breyer, this Court has recognized -- and it has recognized this as long ago as Chief Justice Marshall in the Burr case -- that people come to court with opinions in highly publicized cases."
2009.08-1394,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2131.072,2138.57,"--Were -- were these colloquies that are reported, the -- the pages we have just been reviewing, heard by the entire jury pool?"
2009.08-1394,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2138.57,2139.428,They were not--
2009.08-1394,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2139.428,2143.039,Or were they just -- where the person -- the juror was standing in front of the bench for this?
2009.08-1394,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2143.039,2144.506,"--That's correct, Justice Kennedy."
2009.08-1394,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2207.9,2217.118,It's hard for me to think that the voir dire would have been much shorter even if there had been no showing of pervasive prejudice.
2009.08-1394,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2217.118,2219.396,I think that what Judge--
2009.08-1394,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2219.396,2222.82,Five hours sounds to me about standard for a case of this difficulty.
2009.08-1394,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2222.82,2238.39,"--I -- I think that's not necessarily correct at all, and it would not have been the case that in a normal trial there would have been as detailed a 14-page questionnaire as there was in this case, that was designed to elicit any and all connections to Enron."
2009.08-1394,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2267.021,2269.033,It took many days after it had been transferred.
2009.08-1394,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2269.033,2281.637,"--It did, and Denver itself was exposed, probably almost as much as Oklahoma City, to the pretrial publicity, and a terrorist act of that magnitude, Mr. Chief Justice, really strikes at the heart of the entire nation."
2009.08-1394,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2284.136,2293.085,"It was very -- the atmosphere in Oklahoma City was very different from that anywhere else, in terms of the impact of the bombing on that particular community."
2009.08-1394,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2293.085,2293.568,--Agreed.
2009.08-1394,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2351.732,2352.137,"Oh, no, no."
2009.08-1394,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2370.268,2379.341,"--I don't think so, Mr. Chief Justice, because the honest services component actually, and the component of this trial, was really a subset of the securities fraud."
2009.08-1394,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2447.438,2456.638,"Well, a concession that a bribe or a kickback scheme statute would not be vague is hardly a concession that this statute as written is not vague."
2009.08-1394,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2461.84,2480.331,"--I don't think that in this case, Justice Kennedy, the Court needs to rewrite the statute so much as to recognize that what happened in McNally was this Court said that the mail fraud statute has two clauses, scheme to defraud and scheme for obtaining money or property by false representations and pretenses."
2009.08-1394,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2533.684,2539.089,"Well, suppose you have a statute that -- that makes it criminal to -- to do any bad thing, okay?"
2009.08-1394,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2548.662,2549.976,"No, Justice Scalia, but--"
2009.08-1394,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2549.976,2567.172,"I mean, just because you can pick something that everybody would agree comes within a denial of honest services, doesn't -- doesn't mean that when you say nothing but honest services, you're saying something that -- that has sufficient content to -- to support a criminal prosecution."
2009.08-1394,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2567.172,2571.092,"--But this is not like a statute, Justice Scalia, that says prohibiting any bad thing."
2009.08-1394,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2580.463,2594.41,"And there were cases that -- that -- some of which included bribery, but others of which included a variety of -- of other actions, some of which were allowed by some courts and some of which were disallowed by some courts."
2009.08-1394,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2597.456,2620.963,"--I think that there was a solid enough content for this Court to be able to respond to the McNally decision by giving shape to the crime in accordance with the paradigm cases that the lower courts had done and logical implications of those cases, just as if it had concluded, in accordance with Justice Stevens's dissent, that the statute did protect intangible rights in the phrase ""scheme to defraud""."
2009.08-1394,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2620.963,2629.521,"But if -- if you're going to say that the statute refers to a term of art, the whole point of a term of art is that it's a shorthand for defining something."
2009.08-1394,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2641.282,2658.917,"I think it's a term of art in the sense that it referred to a -- a body of law that until quite recently, when defendants began making vagueness arguments, was understood to refer to the kinds of schemes that had been prosecuted before this Court held that ""scheme to defraud"" was limited to money or property."
2009.08-1394,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2659.728,2660.82,"No, I'm with you there."
2009.08-1394,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2688.685,2701.523,"--I think it's clear enough at the core, this Court can say so and can provide definition, and it can use its standard tools of interpretation of criminal statutes to dispose of cases that are at the periphery and ensure that there is--"
2009.08-1394,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2701.523,2706.928,"It kind of -- it puts the prospective defendant, I guess, in an awfully difficult position, though, if he has got to wait."
2009.08-1394,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2718.376,2731.619,"--Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I don't think it puts a defendant in a very bad position at all, because this statute is only triggered when there's an intent to deceive, an intentional fraudulent act taken to deprive the victim of whatever right exists in question."
2009.08-1394,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2731.619,2739.773,"What was -- Mr. Dreeben, what was the jury told when this honest services count was given to the jury?"
2009.08-1394,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2743.022,2750.052,"Well, the jury instruction, Justice Ginsburg, appears on page 1086a of the Joint Appendix."
2009.08-1394,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2799.014,2799.731,"But it's circular, isn't it?"
2009.08-1394,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2799.731,2801.841,"--The -- I would agree, Justice Scalia."
2009.08-1394,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2843.979,2850.667,So that covers the case that your friend put of the employee using the computer for personal use?
2009.08-1394,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2853.085,2858.927,"--Well, whether the employee had a fiduciary duty in that respect would be, I think, quite a litigable question."
2009.08-1394,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2871.05,2871.424,I'm sorry.
2009.08-1394,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2878.825,2882.729,"Not all employees are fiduciaries, no, Justice Scalia."
2009.08-1394,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2886.465,2888.493,Where do you get the fiduciary limitation?
2009.08-1394,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2888.493,2891.274,--I think that it's inherent in that--
2009.08-1394,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2891.274,2892.087,"All it says is ""honest services""."
2009.08-1394,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2892.836,2893.335,--Well--
2009.08-1394,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2893.335,2897.27,--any employee has the obligation to provide honest services.
2009.08-1394,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2897.27,2909.094,"--I think, Justice Scalia, that you cannot successfully attempt to understand Congress's reaction to this Court's decision in McNally without some cognizance of the McNally decision and the preexisting law."
2009.08-1394,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2909.094,2913.437,"What authority do I look to, to see that some employees are fiduciaries and others are not?"
2009.08-1394,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2913.437,2917.372,"That would be a standard agency law principle, Justice Kennedy, and--"
2009.08-1394,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2917.372,2923.074,"If I look in the Restatement of Agency, and they have a section that applies to fiduciaries and non-fiduciaries, both of whom are employees?"
2009.08-1394,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2923.074,2941.393,"--Normally, Justice Kennedy, no such complexities are necessary, and I think that this Court can resolve this case without introducing such complexities, because the core duties of loyalty that have formed the core of the honest services prosecutions are universal."
2009.08-1394,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2943.393,2955.701,"I would assume that any employee, even at the lowest level of the corporate structure, who has corporate property, a car or something, has a duty to protect that car for the employer."
2009.08-1394,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2955.701,2957.807,But that's not an honest services case.
2009.08-1394,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2981.984,2991.151,"Were there any pre-McNally cases that involved a situation like this, where the benefit to the employee was in the form of the employee's disclosed compensation?"
2009.08-1394,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2991.151,3001.696,"There were not to my knowledge, Justice Alito, and I would frankly acknowledge that this case is a logical extension of the basic principle that we have urged the Court to adopt in the nondisclosure cases."
2009.08-1394,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3058.189,3074.324,"Could I -- the following hypothetical: I'm a councilperson in a jurisdiction that's considering a tax increase or a tax break, and I vote for the tax break, and I happen to have property that qualifies."
2009.08-1394,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3077.448,3079.522,"It may well be, Justice Sotomayor."
2009.08-1394,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3096.516,3107.777,"Please tell me what I look to, to discern -- if I'm a councilperson, to discern what needs to be disclosed or not disclosed?"
2009.08-1394,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3107.777,3112.652,"--I think in the first instance, you will inevitably, as a councilperson, turn to your local law."
2009.08-1394,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3135.095,3135.89,So could--
2009.08-1394,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3135.89,3150.088,"--or -- if I could just finish this part of the answer -- or can point to circumvention-type activity, using of shell companies to conceal an interest, then the government is not going to be able to have an indictable case on honest services fraud."
2009.08-1394,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3150.915,3156.46,"That doesn't give me a whole lot of comfort, I mean, just because there's an intent to deceive."
2009.08-1394,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3186.01,3200.614,"--But this Court has recognized in numerous cases, Justice Scalia, that a mens rea element requiring an intent to deceive, an intent to violate the law, is exactly what helps prevent statutes that might otherwise be considered too vague from falling--"
2009.08-1394,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3200.614,3203.301,"You can -- well, you focus on what you just put together."
2009.08-1394,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3234.88,3235.831,"--I'm not saying that, Justice Breyer."
2009.08-1394,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3235.831,3236.237,You're not saying that.
2009.08-1394,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3236.237,3237.488,I'm saying that in the ordinary case--
2009.08-1394,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3237.488,3241.579,"Then if you're not saying that, what the person has to carry around with them is an agency treatise."
2009.08-1394,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3242.031,3271.613,"--Well, I think that what happens, Justice Breyer, is that unless the government does have some sort of legal platform like that to show that there was knowledge of a duty, it's not possible for the government to bring its proof to the court and establish that the individual acted with the requisite mens rea, unless there is activity that reveals an intent to circumvent the law and to withhold the information, as in Justice Sotomayor's example, information about a property interest that might well affect the deliberations of the council."
2009.08-1394,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3275.52,3282.188,"Yes, I mean, of course they intend to -- it's not the case that is obvious; it's the case that is not obvious that worries me, and--"
2009.08-1394,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3282.188,3282.812,--I don't see any of those--
2009.08-1394,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3282.812,3286.513,"--in the case that is not obvious, of course they intend to withhold information."
2009.08-1394,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3291.044,3299.698,"--Justice Breyer, I think if you look at the cases in which this has happened, there is -- there's not like a deliberation on somebody's part -- oh, do I have to disclose or not disclose?"
2009.08-1394,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3311.88,3324.155,"--Mr. Dreeben, would you clarify the issue that came up: Is the government's theory focused simply on the compensation or does it involve the sale of shares?"
2009.08-1394,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3324.155,3325.718,--It involves the sale of shares as well.
2009.08-1394,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3381.63,3382.32,"Thank you, counsel."
2009.08-1394,2,42056,sri_srinivasan,,3385.6,3387.678,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2009.08-1394,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3495.071,3497.944,So either this was too little or Martha Stewart was too much?
2009.08-1394,2,42056,sri_srinivasan,,3498.677,3501.77,"Well, I think the former rather than the latter--"
2009.08-1394,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3501.77,3503.735,"Well, but it's -- it's a different model of it."
2009.08-1394,2,42056,sri_srinivasan,,3520.168,3534.491,"--Well, you don't necessarily need all of that, Your Honor, but I think with respect to the way in which the district court, in fact, conducted this voir dire, if I could just take -- if I could just direct the Court's attention to one juror in particular -- and, Justice Breyer, this is -- maps onto some of the points you were making."
2009.08-1394,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3601.583,3604.991,"Then on 932, she does answer it, and says, ""He's assumed innocent""."
2009.08-1394,2,42056,sri_srinivasan,,3610.535,3610.863,Not until--
2009.08-1394,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3610.863,3614.002,And so the judge looks her in the eye and says -- fine.
2009.08-1394,2,42056,sri_srinivasan,,3614.002,3617.438,"--Well, not -- not until this happens first, Justice Breyer, between 932a and 933a."
2009.08-1394,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3623.185,3623.591,I see.
2009.08-1394,2,42056,sri_srinivasan,,3623.778,3623.981,And her answer is--
2009.08-1394,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3623.981,3625.182,--I'll read that again.
2009.08-1394,2,42056,sri_srinivasan,,3631.367,3632.275,--I believe that they are.
2009.08-1394,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3635.679,3636.849,"Thank you, counsel."
2009.08-1394,2,42056,sri_srinivasan,,3636.849,3637.177,Thank you.
2009.08-1394,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3637.177,3637.317,Counsel.
