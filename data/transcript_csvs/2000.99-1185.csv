2000.99-1185,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.329,"We'll hear argument next in Number 99-1185, Mark Seling v. Andre Brigham Young."
2000.99-1185,0,36051,maureen_a_hart,,71.504,75.986,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court--
2000.99-1185,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,183.144,211.032,"Ms. Hart, I suppose you could have a situation where on habeas some prisoner, some person being held under a statutory scheme of this type could come in and say, on Federal habeas, I'm being held under circumstances that violate the Constitution, and make an individual challenge, isn't that so?"
2000.99-1185,0,36051,maureen_a_hart,,211.032,228.197,--I think that in habeas an individual who's subject to confinement could come in and the purpose of habeas would be for that person to indicate that for some constitutional reason the very fact or duration of his or her confinement violates the Constitution.
2000.99-1185,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,228.197,228.363,Right.
2000.99-1185,0,36051,maureen_a_hart,,231.852,233.892,"No, Your Honor."
2000.99-1185,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,245.955,253.267,"Now, there is an ongoing 1983 class action, is there, covering this very facility?"
2000.99-1185,0,36051,maureen_a_hart,,253.267,254.819,"Yes, there is, Your Honor."
2000.99-1185,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,254.819,264.269,"And under that action, presumably this respondent would be affected by the outcome of that?"
2000.99-1185,0,36051,maureen_a_hart,,264.269,265.705,I believe that's correct.
2000.99-1185,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,280.949,287.674,"Why is that a constitutional claim? I mean, what constitutional claim does he have other than the double jeopardy claim?"
2000.99-1185,0,36051,maureen_a_hart,,287.674,289.18,"In this case, Your Honor?"
2000.99-1185,1,38789,robert_c_boruchowitz,,1700.006,1700.39,"Yes, sir."
2000.99-1185,2,36051,maureen_a_hart,,3504.982,3506.642,Thank you.
2000.99-1185,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3606.847,3613.828,Could you answer the question I... supposing he proves that everybody who's been committed pursuant to this statute has been punished?
2000.99-1185,2,36051,maureen_a_hart,,3613.828,3631.194,"--Then everyone committed pursuant to the statute would be entitled to go into either State court or Federal court and get those remedies, get those conditions remedied, but they do not go to the validity of whether... they do not go back to the character of Washington's statute."
2000.99-1185,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3655.758,3676.454,"But on your view the reason he could not, on Justice Stevens' hypothetical, argue that the court had made a mistake in finding the statute across the board to be a civil statute is that the character of the statute on your view must be determined on the text of the statute, on the basis of the statutory text alone, is that it?"
2000.99-1185,2,36051,maureen_a_hart,,3679.001,3680.961,Under the Hudson test.
2000.99-1185,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3680.961,3682.389,"Thank you, Ms. Hart."
