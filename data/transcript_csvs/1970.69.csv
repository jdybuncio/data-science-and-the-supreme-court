1970.69,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,8.326,"Arguments of this time in No. 69, Wyman against James."
1970.69,0,18028,brenda_soloff,,12.454,16.785,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1970.69,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,113.434,120.931,Does advance notice of the caseworker's visit normally given or is it not?
1970.69,0,18028,brenda_soloff,,120.931,122.853,"It was given in this case, Mr. Justice."
1970.69,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,122.853,125.508,"I know it was, but I saw many affidavits in the appendix?"
1970.69,0,18028,brenda_soloff,,125.508,131.281,There is a policy in New York City that it be given.
1970.69,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,141.433,143.737,But in any event in this case it's conceded that there was an advance notice?
1970.69,0,18028,brenda_soloff,,143.737,151.858,"In this case, there definitely was advance notice for approximately a week."
1970.69,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,406.97,413.179,"Mrs. Soloff, there is a no relevant HEW regulations on this subject, is it?"
1970.69,0,18028,brenda_soloff,,413.179,443.999,"There is an HEW -- if you mean Mr. Justice, is there a regulation specifically requiring home visits, there is only for a quality control sample of cases, but there is such a requirement for an investigation of a selected sample and I think, it's important to note in this context that the appellees apparently don't challenge the fact that you can make home visits to this selected sample."
1970.69,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,443.999,446.491,What's the sample?
1970.69,0,18028,brenda_soloff,,446.491,460.29,"It's not that I know of specifically designated in the regulation, but each household is a potential member of that sample and it seems to me that constitutionality doesn't rest on a number of homes that you include in the sample."
1970.69,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,473.18,479.615,And the idea that under that regulation the purposes of the visits would be precisely the purpose of the (Inaudible)?
1970.69,0,18028,brenda_soloff,,479.615,481.645,"Yes, Mr. Justice."
1970.69,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,481.645,485.918,"Both at sample, tell me something more about that, will you?"
1970.69,0,18028,brenda_soloff,,488.518,511.303,"I am not completely familiar with the mechanics of how these -- a sample is selected, but I do know that each state is required to furnish a sample that will be adequate at least for HEW purposes, will be deemed to be adequate to determine if in fact eligibility requirements are being met."
1970.69,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,511.303,518.921,"Well, is there any significance which HEW to the fact that apparently HEW requires only visits?"
1970.69,0,18028,brenda_soloff,,524.606,537.357,"I think there is no constitutional significance to it Mr. Justice, as far as whether or not there is a significance in the fact that they may deemed this adequate."
1970.69,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,566.576,574.063,"Unless you delete a proscription beyond the sample, in the fact that that's all HEW refer?"
1970.69,0,18028,brenda_soloff,,574.063,580.456,There -- I think you cannot strictly say that the regulation which says that you must do so much says that you can do no more.
1970.69,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,580.456,586.892,What do the state authorities do in compliance with the HEW requirement of sample of visits?
1970.69,0,18028,brenda_soloff,,586.892,592.198,"They provide statistics to HEW, based on selected sample of cases."
1970.69,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,592.198,596.827,"Well, I mean what do New York societies do in compliance to that regulation?"
1970.69,0,18028,brenda_soloff,,596.827,598.884,They prepare reports for HEW.
1970.69,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,598.884,604.038,"Well, I know but they must be reports of, what, a sample of visits or what?"
1970.69,0,18028,brenda_soloff,,604.038,604.428,"Well, no."
1970.69,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,654.528,664.685,Now if the investigation including the home visits deemed only at a surveillance to determine eligibility or continued eligibility?
1970.69,0,18028,brenda_soloff,,664.685,668.846,It's eligibility and continued eligibility in a full sense.
1970.69,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,688.016,697.961,Now is that a condition for eligibility that it works?
1970.69,0,18028,brenda_soloff,,697.961,699.542,"Yes, Mr. Justice."
1970.69,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,699.542,725.324,"How do you when -- would you just indicate briefly, specifically how a home visit contributes to determining eligibility based on those few factors which determine eligibility, not some peripheral matters that might be able to -- that might interest the social worker?"
1970.69,0,18028,brenda_soloff,,725.324,732.445,The home visit can verify of course first the residence.
1970.69,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,746.808,749.321,Now what's that got to do with eligibility?
1970.69,0,18028,brenda_soloff,,749.321,757.664,It has to do with the possibility of resources and this is in terms on initial eligibility I am speaking now.
1970.69,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,762.179,766.322,How does the home visit contribute to that?
1970.69,0,18028,brenda_soloff,,766.322,781.448,"By seeing what is in the home, the worker maybe able to have an idea of whether or not the conditions which the claimant -- which the client has stated exists, do in fact exist."
1970.69,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,789.582,799.535,"Well, now that's what I don't understand a home visit, do you want to see if the aid is being used for the child, is that it?"
1970.69,0,18028,brenda_soloff,,799.535,800.318,That's right Mr. Justice.
1970.69,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,800.318,802.17,How do you tell that?
1970.69,0,18028,brenda_soloff,,802.17,821.192,"You can tell by the functioning, the relationship of the child to the home whether there are adequate facilities for the child in the home, whether the child is receiving the kind of care which does now or may create a dangerous situation which must --"
1970.69,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,821.192,831.22,"Let's assume that the child isn't receiving adequate care in your judgment, does that terminate eligibility?"
1970.69,0,18028,brenda_soloff,,831.22,832.166,Under the --
1970.69,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,832.166,836.354,Or does it just provides some ground for taking some action under some other law?
1970.69,0,18028,brenda_soloff,,836.354,850.72,"Well, but the ground -- if the ground -- the ultimate result is a neglect proceeding which the statute specifically provides, the Federal Social Security Act provides must be done if there is a danger to the child."
1970.69,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,861.767,865.44,"Well, let's see, does that mean the example of an investigation is closed."
1970.69,0,18028,brenda_soloff,,888.059,901.629,"No, Your Honor, Mr. Justice, it means that steps must be taken to protect the child even if it means either introducing another person into the home to care for the child or removing the child from the home."
1970.69,1,33589,jonathan_weiss,,1834.605,1837.314,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1970.69,2,18028,brenda_soloff,,3636.84,3640.498,"I would just like to say that, I would address myself to Mr. Justice Brennan's first --"
1970.69,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3640.498,3641.566,Could you please just speak a little louder?
1970.69,2,18028,brenda_soloff,,3641.566,3642.466,I am sorry.
1970.69,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3688.13,3701.424,"Well I thought that is what Mr. Weiss said, the termination hearing amounts to nothing more than an inquiry, it was a refusal, and if it's found that it was refusal, then automatically an order is entered, terminating benefits."
1970.69,2,18028,brenda_soloff,,3702.988,3720.205,"I say that we have no other case but this one, Mr. Justice and what happened in this case was that no reason was advanced why the visit should not be made and so that the flat face of the record appears to support that the position whereas it's not least bit necessary."
1970.69,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3720.205,3734.275,"But suppose that it had been said that, I can give you this information, whatever it is you want, without you making a home visit, this is the way I will supply it or whatever, that tender was made."
1970.69,2,18028,brenda_soloff,,3743.86,3761.401,"Then I think it is up to -- again we're talking somewhat in the dark, that she did not go to a state fair hearing, but I think that the result would be up to the referee to determine if the department was correct that the option was unacceptable, that the alternative was unacceptable."
1970.69,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3761.401,3766.878,Doesn't the either a statute or a regulation require a home visit regularly?
1970.69,2,18028,brenda_soloff,,3766.878,3770.302,The statute requires an initial home visit.
1970.69,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3788.182,3789.529,So --
1970.69,2,18028,brenda_soloff,,3789.529,3793.624,So that the referee would have some latitude in this respect.
1970.69,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3793.624,3810.697,"You mean the policy of New York as stated in the statute or in the regulation, does not -- is in fact that there must be a home visit in order to assure the welfare department of continued eligibility."
1970.69,2,18028,brenda_soloff,,3810.697,3811.559,That's right.
1970.69,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3811.559,3816.9,So they must think that there is some other ways of doing it or that they just don't care actually.
1970.69,2,18028,brenda_soloff,,3816.9,3829.521,"It's not that they don't care, it's that there is the possibility, but that is alternative means, but that it's also possible that alternative means will not work."
1970.69,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3834.501,3841.442,"What are that means whatever, worked in verifying just the fact that three children are living in the home?"
1970.69,2,18028,brenda_soloff,,3841.442,3844.657,I can't think that another one would work as effectively.
1970.69,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3860.467,3875.998,"I suppose if you had unlimited funds, you could put a 24 hours surveillance on the house and if for 30 days no children were seen coming or going, that might lead to an inference that they were either very ill or that there weren't any children there."
1970.69,2,18028,brenda_soloff,,3875.998,3879.194,"I suppose that, that is possible Mr. Justice."
1970.69,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3916.369,3926.211,Does the record show how many children they are and what are their ages and how much they draw?
1970.69,2,18028,brenda_soloff,,3926.211,3928.53,Mrs. James says one child.
1970.69,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3941.975,3945.818,"How much is contributed, anything for rent?"
1970.69,2,18028,brenda_soloff,,3945.818,3951.82,New York state case went separately from its grants for other --
1970.69,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3951.82,3954.212,Does she get anything for rent here?
1970.69,2,18028,brenda_soloff,,3954.212,3956.892,"Yes, New York pays rent apart from the --"
1970.69,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3956.892,3962.329,How much does she get for the rent of the house in which she lived with the child?
1970.69,2,18028,brenda_soloff,,3962.329,3971.762,"I don't remember what her last -- her last rent that I recall was in the neighborhood of $100 a month, but I don't remember precisely because she has moved a number of times."
1970.69,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3971.762,3974.096,How big is the house?
1970.69,2,18028,brenda_soloff,,3974.806,3981.577,"It's an apartment, It's an apartment I believe, it's three or four rooms."
1970.69,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3981.577,3991.798,"Ms. Soloff, if you have heard my hypothetical, a factual situation I presented to Mr. Weiss about the foster homes."
1970.69,2,18028,brenda_soloff,,4007.002,4013.012,"I believe it does, but I can't cite the section of the law in which that happens, it would be under the family law, I think."
1970.69,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4013.012,4021.896,"But certainty, it'd be astonishing if they place children in home and then made no check on them to determine whether they were being properly cared for wouldn't it?"
1970.69,2,18028,brenda_soloff,,4021.896,4022.355,They do.
1970.69,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4025.975,4026.938,Thank you.
1970.69,2,18028,brenda_soloff,,4026.938,4027.196,Thank you.
1970.69,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4027.196,4028.093,Thank you Ms. Soloff.
