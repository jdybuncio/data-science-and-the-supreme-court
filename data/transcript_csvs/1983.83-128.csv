1983.83-128,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,53.033,"Mr. Frey, you may proceed whenever you're ready."
1983.83-128,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,53.033,57.02,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1983.83-128,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,138.824,141.693,Were they free to communicate with the outside?
1983.83-128,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,141.693,148.212,"They were free to make phone calls to the outside, to lawyers or to others."
1983.83-128,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,296.076,296.993,"Excuse me, Mr. Frey."
1983.83-128,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,302.13,315.287,"In this particular case, the time of indictment is the time that we say that the right of appointment of counsel attaches, the right to assistance of counsel and for indigents appointment of counsel."
1983.83-128,1,18776,charles_p_diamond,,1724.953,1727.305,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1983.83-128,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1885.106,1891.36,Where would he have been had there been no murders or other injuries?
1983.83-128,1,18776,charles_p_diamond,,1891.36,1895.895,He would have remained within his general population at the Lompoc Penitentiary.
1983.83-128,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1911.674,1912.891,You say he couldn't do anything.
1983.83-128,1,18776,charles_p_diamond,,1916.825,1920.612,In limited circumstances they had limited access to make telephone calls.
1983.83-128,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1920.612,1921.162,"They did, right."
1983.83-128,1,18776,charles_p_diamond,,1924.148,1933.354,"That was the extent to which they could communicate with the outside world, coupled with the potential of having visits, if a visitor showed up to see them."
1983.83-128,2,31386,joel_levine,,2677.767,2680.969,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1983.83-128,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2751.998,2757.333,"What do you mean ""works""... that avoids a conviction?"
1983.83-128,2,31386,joel_levine,,2757.333,2768.691,"--Well, hopefully so, Your Honor, but what I'm specifically speaking about is remedies such as suppression of a statement or suppression of part of a government's... of the government's evidence."
1983.83-128,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2770.477,2773.679,How would you have a remedy that affects that?
1983.83-128,2,31386,joel_levine,,2773.679,2780.232,"--Well, my point is that there can be no other remedy on this type of a case other than dismissal of the indictment."
1983.83-128,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2785.136,2788.454,You mean if there's been a denial of the right to counsel?
1983.83-128,2,31386,joel_levine,,2788.454,2789.588,That's right.
1983.83-128,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2790.79,2798.444,"In other words, it doesn't help you to prove that there's a right to counsel when you say you don't get these kinds of remedies."
1983.83-128,2,31386,joel_levine,,2798.444,2800.146,"--Well, Your Honor, in a sense you do."
1983.83-128,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2844.841,2847.877,Could they have telephoned you with respect to these matters?
1983.83-128,2,31386,joel_levine,,2847.877,2849.562,If they knew us.
1983.83-128,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2849.562,2859.267,Could the clients that you're now representing have telephoned you and got advice over the telephone or by visits which were allowed?
1983.83-128,2,31386,joel_levine,,2859.267,2871.758,"Well, that would have been the case had somebody who was associated with them retained an attorney such as myself, and if these defendants, we have to assume, had the ability to pay for an attorney."
1983.83-128,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2919.825,2931.633,How much better off with respect to being able to prepare his defense would he have been in the general prison population than in the control unit?
1983.83-128,2,31386,joel_levine,,2931.633,2933.116,"Well, in the control unit--"
1983.83-128,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2933.116,2943.623,"Because I guess you can see that if he had been released to the control unit he could have asked for counsel forever and wouldn't have been entitled to it, even if he was indigent."
1983.83-128,2,31386,joel_levine,,2943.623,2944.256,"--Well, Your Honor--"
1983.83-128,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2944.256,2946.173,Until there had been a charge filed.
1983.83-128,2,31386,joel_levine,,2946.173,2948.108,--I understand that.
1983.83-128,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2948.108,2949.058,Isn't that right?
1983.83-128,2,31386,joel_levine,,2949.058,2953.479,I think he has a tremendous advantage by going to the general population.
1983.83-128,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2956.498,2960.216,"Well, he's not going to get an attorney appointed for him, so what does he do to help himself?"
1983.83-128,2,31386,joel_levine,,2960.216,2960.7,--Okay.
1983.83-128,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3008.466,3015.703,"So he's... when he's in the general prison population he is going to be conducting, gathering these facts himself?"
1983.83-128,2,31386,joel_levine,,3015.703,3018.238,--He has the right to do it and maybe the potential--
1983.83-128,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3018.238,3020.957,He also has the right to be killed.
1983.83-128,2,31386,joel_levine,,3020.957,3026.343,"--That's absolutely true, Your Honor, and unfortunately in a prison setting that occurs more often than not."
1983.83-128,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3037.049,3038.401,"Well, let's back up a minute."
1983.83-128,2,31386,joel_levine,,3043.203,3044.572,--Even if he were in isolation.
1983.83-128,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3044.572,3046.389,"Yes, sir, is that right?"
1983.83-128,2,31386,joel_levine,,3046.389,3047.357,That's absolutely right.
1983.83-128,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3047.357,3051.476,Would a lawyer be able to go out and talk to all the prisoners?
1983.83-128,2,31386,joel_levine,,3051.476,3053.511,He would have a right to attempt to do so.
1983.83-128,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3053.511,3055.478,Would he be able to do so?
1983.83-128,2,31386,joel_levine,,3055.478,3057.547,"I think within certain limitations, yes."
1983.83-128,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3057.547,3060.415,Like two or three?
1983.83-128,2,31386,joel_levine,,3060.415,3063.45,"Well, Your Honor, maybe two or three a day."
1983.83-128,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3067.235,3073.658,"There are opportunities, but I mean every prisoner out there is going to have a lawyer going around talking to the prisoners?"
1983.83-128,2,31386,joel_levine,,3075.874,3080.495,"Well, not the lawyers, Your Honor."
1983.83-128,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3086.482,3088.934,I agree with what was said earlier.
1983.83-128,2,31386,joel_levine,,3092.453,3094.922,"Well, Your Honor, I think the--"
1983.83-128,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3094.922,3096.055,Am I right?
1983.83-128,2,31386,joel_levine,,3096.055,3100.059,"--If I were an accused in that position, I would prefer to have a lawyer."
1983.83-128,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3102.359,3108.062,Do you know of a lawyer that would go down into the prison yard and talk to prisoners at random?
1983.83-128,2,31386,joel_levine,,3108.062,3109.597,"--We did it in this case, Your Honor."
1983.83-128,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3109.597,3110.147,What?
1983.83-128,2,31386,joel_levine,,3110.147,3112.282,We did it in this case and it's a matter of record in this case.
1983.83-128,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3112.282,3112.899,You did?
1983.83-128,2,31386,joel_levine,,3112.899,3113.866,"Yes, Your Honor."
1983.83-128,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3113.866,3115.918,But you weren't paid?
1983.83-128,2,31386,joel_levine,,3115.918,3116.951,"No, this was after indictment."
1983.83-128,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3117.77,3120.503,This was done by the paid lawyer?
1983.83-128,2,31386,joel_levine,,3120.503,3122.972,--I don't see why a paid lawyer would not do it.
1983.83-128,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3122.972,3126.69,Let me see if I understand you.
1983.83-128,2,31386,joel_levine,,3132.161,3132.494,No.
1983.83-128,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3134.411,3136.463,You mean those who were not your clients?
1983.83-128,2,31386,joel_levine,,3136.463,3136.846,That's right.
1983.83-128,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3183.991,3191.497,"Well, Mr. Levine, you succeeded in producing a large number of witnesses, did you not, at the trial?"
1983.83-128,2,31386,joel_levine,,3191.497,3192.314,I--
1983.83-128,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3192.314,3197.401,How many witnesses from the former prison population were you able to produce?
1983.83-128,2,31386,joel_levine,,3197.401,3202.802,"--Justice O'Connor in response to your question, that comes up in the government's brief time and time again."
1983.83-128,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3300.049,3301.249,"Well, how did you get into this case?"
1983.83-128,2,31386,joel_levine,,3301.249,3303.999,"Appointed after indictment, Your Honor."
1983.83-128,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3303.999,3311.038,And suppose there had been a release after 90 days into the general prison population.
1983.83-128,2,31386,joel_levine,,3320.377,3323.012,"Not according to Judge Sneed's opinion, there would not."
1983.83-128,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3324.395,3329.499,And so he would then have had to proceed on his own?
1983.83-128,2,31386,joel_levine,,3329.499,3330.549,That's correct.
1983.83-128,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3334.601,3335.434,I understand.
1983.83-128,2,31386,joel_levine,,3335.434,3338.319,The choice was being given to the Bureau of Prisons.
1983.83-128,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3363.703,3375.678,Even with the risks that might be attendant and were thought to attend such a release into the general population?
1983.83-128,2,31386,joel_levine,,3375.678,3379.396,"Well, there would have been a risk with every prisoner being released."
1983.83-128,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3460.682,3479.161,"Do you think that there are some rather unusual difficulties in investigating this kind of case, as you have said it was for you, and that those difficulties would also attend the government's inquiry to try to get information from these prisoners?"
1983.83-128,2,31386,joel_levine,,3479.161,3494.955,"Your Honor, the way one of these cases is typically investigated... and I know in the brief that I supplied the Court with I outlined a step-by-step approach to how they found their evidence in this case, and the dates upon which they found it."
1983.83-128,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3537.029,3539.548,"It's also safe, isn't it?"
1983.83-128,2,31386,joel_levine,,3539.548,3540.817,Absolutely.
1983.83-128,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3620.683,3623.551,"Well, do you have anything further, Mr. Frey?"
1983.83-128,3,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3623.551,3624.737,A couple of things.
1983.83-128,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3633.692,3640.996,How many of these defendants charged with murder had these long life sentences?
1983.83-128,3,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3640.996,3642.046,I think they all.
1983.83-128,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3771.247,3782.372,"Mr. Frey, if one of these people had plenty of money and apart from prison regulations, would he have had a constitutional right to retain counsel of his choice before indictment?"
1983.83-128,3,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3782.372,3797.564,"Well, I kind of discussed that a little bit back in December in the Flanagan case, but that would sound to me something like a substantive due process right, and I am not sure what this Court would find."
1983.83-128,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3833.838,3840.56,"Or some other reason to hold them in confinement... I mean, in control units."
1983.83-128,3,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3840.56,3841.66,"--Well, it could be confined in a mental institution."
1983.83-128,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3841.66,3843.179,Or under the control unit.
1983.83-128,3,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3849.999,3851.366,"Well, I want to make a point."
1983.83-128,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3905.001,3905.684,"Thank you, gentlemen."
