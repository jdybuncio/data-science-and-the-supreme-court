1992.91-1526,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,11.32,"We'll hear argument next in No. 91-1526, Ferris J. Alexander v. the United States."
1992.91-1526,0,33573,john_h_weston,,61.392,62.841,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1992.91-1526,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,109.123,121.472,"Well, is... what... which of our cases do you rely on, Mr. Weston, for the proposition that when obscenity is charged, it is presumed that it is not obscene?"
1992.91-1526,0,33573,john_h_weston,,123.393,144.857,"The mere fact of an accusation, Mr. Chief... if I understand the Court's question, the mere fact of an accusation does not serve to deprive the material that is being challenged of its protected status until such time as a court ultimately and finally determines that it is not obscene."
1992.91-1526,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,145.798,148.77,"Well, is that just a burden of proof proposition?"
1992.91-1526,0,33573,john_h_weston,,154.794,155.696,"--Not at all, Your Honor."
1992.91-1526,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,212.362,212.612,Yes.
1992.91-1526,0,33573,john_h_weston,,219.338,233.807,"Well, with all respect, I see no difference with respect to that, Your Honor, that if the material is presumed to be protected until it is ultimately deprived judicially of its protected status, under that circumstance, it retains the presumption of protectedness and simply may not be removed."
1992.91-1526,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,271.292,274.764,Do I understand that all this material was burned?
1992.91-1526,0,33573,john_h_weston,,274.764,275.773,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1992.91-1526,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,299.789,303.401,These were also called sexually oriented materials or not?
1992.91-1526,0,33573,john_h_weston,,303.752,305.004,Not... the record--
1992.91-1526,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,305.004,306.163,--The Last of the Mohicans?
1992.91-1526,0,33573,john_h_weston,,307.756,308.755,"--The record does not reflect that, Your Honor."
1992.91-1526,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,311.486,313.449,What was the business in question?
1992.91-1526,0,33573,john_h_weston,,313.449,316.571,--The businesses represented a number of different businesses.
1992.91-1526,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,319.554,319.804,What... adult bookstores.
1992.91-1526,0,33573,john_h_weston,,322.536,324.847,"Much was probably adult video, Justice Scalia."
1992.91-1526,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,348.993,349.882,"As far as the seizure is concerned, but--"
1992.91-1526,0,33573,john_h_weston,,349.882,350.973,And the destruction.
1992.91-1526,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1880.918,1884.041,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1992.91-1526,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1919.814,1922.425,Do you think it's entirely invisible to the First Amendment--
1992.91-1526,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1922.425,1923.627,--It is--
1992.91-1526,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1923.627,1924.698,--after R.A.V.?
1992.91-1526,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1924.698,1940.268,"--To the extent that a final determination has been made that it is obscene, the First Amendment does not care and thus, in that sense, it is invisible once it has been... in terms of First Amendment values, yes."
1992.91-1526,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1942.11,1943.699,Do you think that's consistent with the holding in R.A.V.?
1992.91-1526,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1943.699,1951.096,I don't think it's inconsistent with the holding in R.A.V. because R.A.V. did not seem to call into question... or R.A.V. was obviously concerned with content basis.
1992.91-1526,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2072.043,2078.706,Is there anything in the record to show us the extent of the forfeiture or what was taken?
1992.91-1526,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2078.706,2078.967,Yes.
1992.91-1526,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2126.149,2130.743,"Why don't you just tell us about the record, rather than share it with us."
1992.91-1526,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2130.743,2155.068,"--The record tells us, Mr. Chief Justice, that there were essentially here 10 businesses and adult theaters that were engaged in the sale of literature and movies that all partook of the same nature."
1992.91-1526,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2244.676,2246.389,"Mr. Starr, is that part of your case?"
1992.91-1526,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2246.389,2247.448,"--Yes, it is."
1992.91-1526,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2248.089,2249.271,That was necessary to prove that?
1992.91-1526,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2249.271,2258.956,"--It's not necessary, but it's part of my case in the sense that if you read the indictment, the indictment alleged various tax offenses and fraud--"
1992.91-1526,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2258.956,2262.528,Is it not correct that the obscenity offenses were the only predicate offense?
1992.91-1526,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2262.528,2265.15,"--Absolutely, and I don't want to mislead the Court--"
1992.91-1526,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2265.15,2267.493,Then why do we talk about the other offense?
1992.91-1526,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2270.374,2275.717,--Because it tells us about the nature of this enterprise and the criminality of the enterprise in--
1992.91-1526,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2275.717,2280.81,But is that... tell me this because I really am curious because the statute is a difficult statute to understand.
1992.91-1526,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2293.389,2294.499,--Absolutely not.
1992.91-1526,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2305.698,2309.307,"Well, but you had a pattern of racketeering with six obscenity offenses."
1992.91-1526,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2310.579,2311.801,--But we were--
1992.91-1526,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2311.801,2312.68,Under the statute I mean.
1992.91-1526,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2312.68,2314.513,--But we were prepared to show much more--
1992.91-1526,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2314.513,2314.733,No.
1992.91-1526,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2323.258,2331.674,"--To show that, in fact, there was a pattern of racketeering, and then the other elements of the enterprise, that the enterprise was used in the offense."
