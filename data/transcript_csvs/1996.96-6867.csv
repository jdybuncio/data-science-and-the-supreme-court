1996.96-6867,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.606,"We'll hear argument next in Number 96-6867, Joseph Roger O'Dell v. J. D. Netherland."
1996.96-6867,0,40421,robert_s_smith,,55.735,58.02,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1996.96-6867,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,107.202,111.637,"Mr. Smith, I'd like to ask you a hard question at the outset."
1996.96-6867,0,40421,robert_s_smith,,129.616,138.741,"The split on this Court as to whether the Simmons rule was required by the Constitution, I believe the Court was 7 to 2 on that issue, Your Honor, it's my understanding."
1996.96-6867,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,1475.575,1479.877,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1996.96-6867,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1506.444,1512.098,"Well, I'm not sure... I don't... or I think you're referring to counsel's response to my question."
1996.96-6867,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,1532.493,1533.261,But counsel--
1996.96-6867,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1533.261,1537.713,It's the misrepresentation I think that is... was of concern to me and was of concern to him.
1996.96-6867,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,1537.713,1544.569,"--Correct, and I don't believe there's ever been a claim in this case that the prosecutor misrepresented the law to this jury, and in fact--"
1996.96-6867,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1544.569,1567.416,"But isn't it clear that the impression that a jury would take from the argument was the impression that, under the law as it existed, this individual could be paroled and placed out on the street again so that he could commit the kind of depredations that he prosecutor quite accurately was referring to as his past acts, and that in fact was not so, was it?"
1996.96-6867,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,1567.416,1582.075,"--He was not allowed... correct, he was not allowed a Simmons instruction, but if this prosecutor had in any way directed this jury that O'Dell was going to get out on parole, that would have been an issue that would have been reversed immediately and automatically by the supreme court."
1996.96-6867,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1582.075,1582.575,"No, but isn't that--"
1996.96-6867,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,1584.627,1595.168,"There was never an objection to the prosecutor's argument in any way, shape, or form, and if it had been, and if the record had supported that, the Virginia supreme court would have reversed that conviction."
1996.96-6867,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1595.168,1598.22,"Okay, but he is arguing that he had a right to rebut something."
1996.96-6867,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,1598.22,1599.62,"Yes, the Simmons right."
1996.96-6867,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1599.62,1602.922,That it would have been relevant to put in this information about the law.
1996.96-6867,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,1602.922,1603.774,"That's right, but the type--"
1996.96-6867,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1603.774,1604.658,I'm sorry.
1996.96-6867,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,1605.158,1606.643,--I'm sorry.
1996.96-6867,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1606.643,1624.437,"What I was going to say... my question was going to be, isn't it the case that what he wants to rebut was an implication about the law which in fact is not correct, i.e., the implication that under the law he could be paroled for this offense?"
1996.96-6867,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,1630.608,1634.893,"That is the Simmons claim, and in 1994 that would have been error."
1996.96-6867,2,40421,robert_s_smith,,3021.391,3048.275,"Mr. Chief Justice, I just want to address briefly the idea that the death sentence here was the result of the fear that he would be dangerous in prison, which has been an argument made both in the harmless error context and also in the context of suggesting that it was reasonable to... a reasonable jurist in 1983 might have taken that approach."
1996.96-6867,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3112.634,3113.067,It might recur.
1996.96-6867,2,40421,robert_s_smith,,3127.394,3127.927,Within--
1996.96-6867,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3127.927,3137.6,"I mean, I understand that, you know, that's not how we ultimately concluded, but I don't know that you couldn't have looked at it that way at that time and just said, we don't want to get into all these things."
1996.96-6867,2,40421,robert_s_smith,,3137.6,3152.942,"--I guess I just... I respectfully submit, Justice Scalia, that what is obviously happening is that you have someone whom the prosecution is portraying successfully as a terrifying individual, that for him to be able to say, I'm facing life without parole is such an obvious thing."
1996.96-6867,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3155.978,3163.5,"Now, did the defendant so testify in front of the jury and tell the jury that he wouldn't be eligible for release?"
1996.96-6867,2,40421,robert_s_smith,,3163.5,3164.217,"No, Your Honor."
1996.96-6867,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3164.217,3165.186,That didn't occur.
1996.96-6867,2,40421,robert_s_smith,,3167.686,3168.888,I don't think that's what Ms. Baldwin said.
1996.96-6867,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3239.917,3240.917,"Thank you, Mr. Smith."
