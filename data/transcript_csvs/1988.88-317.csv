1988.88-317,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.737,We'll hear argument next in No. 88-317 in Jack R. Duckworth versus Gary James Eagan.
1988.88-317,0,21717,david_michael_wallman,,13.189,15.224,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1988.88-317,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,160.8,167.872,Is that because of the... the only problem in the view of the court below was this language of
1988.88-317,0,21717,david_michael_wallman,,173.324,174.026,"--That's correct, Justice O'Connor."
1988.88-317,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,176.209,179.245,Are they still using that in Indiana?
1988.88-317,0,21717,david_michael_wallman,,179.245,180.447,"--I don't believe so, your Honor."
1988.88-317,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,188.067,191.136,--in his case or after the '72 decision?
1988.88-317,0,21717,david_michael_wallman,,191.136,195.421,"Well, apparently it was utilized after the '72 decision or we wouldn't have this case."
1988.88-317,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,199.992,203.627,What language is used now instead of that?
1988.88-317,0,21717,david_michael_wallman,,203.627,209.598,The... the... I frankly don't know what Hammond does in that regard.
1988.88-317,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,215.167,220.053,Has your office done anything to have those old forms put in the wastebasket?
1988.88-317,0,21717,david_michael_wallman,,220.053,224.957,We have communicated to them the decision in this case.
1988.88-317,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,224.957,230.511,Is there some specific origin for this wording?
1988.88-317,0,21717,david_michael_wallman,,234.229,235.831,"It's come up in a number of cases, your Honor."
1988.88-317,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,247.973,253.008,Do you take the position that the warning is factually correct?
1988.88-317,0,21717,david_michael_wallman,,253.008,254.409,"It is factually correct, your Honor."
1988.88-317,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,273.956,274.29,"Well, isn't--"
1988.88-317,0,21717,david_michael_wallman,,285.579,290.966,Indiana statutory law provides for the appointment of counsel at the time the individual is first taken to court.
1988.88-317,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,290.966,291.416,At arraignment?
1988.88-317,0,21717,david_michael_wallman,,291.416,293.418,At first appearance.
1988.88-317,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,293.418,294.453,First appearance.
1988.88-317,0,21717,david_michael_wallman,,298.405,301.357,"Yes, it does, as long as we don't, force him to answer questions."
1988.88-317,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,301.357,304.725,"Well, isn't that the explanation of why this is such a common formulation?"
1988.88-317,0,21717,david_michael_wallman,,328.591,330.543,"That's our view, your Honor."
1988.88-317,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,350.104,352.956,Does the record indicate whether he was street wise?
1988.88-317,0,21717,david_michael_wallman,,355.492,361.246,"I believe in the pre-sentence investigation, which is a part of the record, he had had some earlier charges."
1988.88-317,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,368.668,372.87,"--Mr. Wallman, what do they do in Indiana if the suspect says,"
1988.88-317,0,21717,david_michael_wallman,,380.475,384.677,We would be in violation of the Constitution if we continued the interview at that point.
1988.88-317,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,384.677,385.244,"--Well, I understand... if you continued."
1988.88-317,0,21717,david_michael_wallman,,399.037,403.489,We have no statutory law that would demand that outcome.
1988.88-317,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,403.489,404.441,"No, I didn't say that demands it."
1988.88-317,0,21717,david_michael_wallman,,407.46,407.827,That's correct.
1988.88-317,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,407.827,409.11,--and then counsel is appointed.
1988.88-317,0,21717,david_michael_wallman,,411.245,411.812,"That's correct, your Honor."
1988.88-317,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,411.812,412.212,Yes.
1988.88-317,0,21717,david_michael_wallman,,426.005,427.539,"In our view that's correct, your Honor."
1988.88-317,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,430.541,430.874,"No, I understand--"
1988.88-317,0,21717,david_michael_wallman,,430.874,431.743,--who refuses to waive his--
1988.88-317,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,431.743,432.276,--you can't accept the statement.
1988.88-317,0,21717,david_michael_wallman,,437.729,443.216,"--Well, if one were available readily available... and happened to be on the site and would volunteer,--"
1988.88-317,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,443.216,445.6,"Yeah, but you don't have any procedure for dealing with that situation."
1988.88-317,0,21717,david_michael_wallman,,445.6,447.452,--We have no immediate procedure for dealing with that.
1988.88-317,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,448.352,456.708,"Of course, isn't the reason for that the likelihood that once he had the attorney he wouldn't answer questions anyway?"
1988.88-317,0,21717,david_michael_wallman,,456.708,467.416,The reason for that is the statutory provision that indicates he shall have a counsel appointed at the time of his first appearance in court.
1988.88-317,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,474.253,475.202,That's not devious.
1988.88-317,0,21717,david_michael_wallman,,480.889,485.96,--I would presume that's correct in all... in virtually all Miranda cases that reach any court in this country.
1988.88-317,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,683.489,684.639,"Thank you, Mr. Wallman."
1988.88-317,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,693.964,696.447,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1988.88-317,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,818.778,825.765,"Well, in that view would you say that it's preferable that this additional statement be given in all Miranda warnings?"
1988.88-317,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,825.765,826.082,No.
1988.88-317,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,837.907,838.173,Why?
1988.88-317,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,838.173,840.792,--it causes unnecessary litigation.
1988.88-317,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,840.792,843.41,"Well, why does I cause unnecessary... well, we're here now."
1988.88-317,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,847.797,850.416,We don't think the Court has to decide whether it's preferable or not.
1988.88-317,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,860.688,861.805,"Well, what is the government's view?"
1988.88-317,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,865.923,866.24,No.
1988.88-317,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,871.961,875.046,"Well, if this is factually correct, why not add it."
1988.88-317,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,875.046,877.731,--Because it's not factually correct in every jurisdiction.
1988.88-317,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,886.92,889.388,"Well, this is factually correct in the State of Indiana."
1988.88-317,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,889.388,890.855,--In the State of Indiana this is absolutely correct.
1988.88-317,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,890.855,896.359,And presumably some other states that don't appoint until there's a first appearance in court for an indigent.
1988.88-317,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,896.359,896.742,Yes.
1988.88-317,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,984.0,987.302,In the federal system do you ever go to the Federal Defender Program directly?
1988.88-317,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,993.273,1005.513,"It can be done ahead of time in the sense that... at least my experience in Philadelphia in the federal system... the Federal Defendant Program is always available, and when the person was taken into custody, two calls would be made."
1988.88-317,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1023.792,1029.363,"You know, there's no reason why we have to pick and choose among permissible Miranda warnings, is there?"
1988.88-317,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,1035.032,1035.683,"Yes, Chief Justice."
1988.88-317,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1051.644,1056.096,Do you think this warning complied with the Seventh Circuit decision in Williams against Toomey?
1988.88-317,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,1056.096,1057.263,"No, obviously it did not."
1988.88-317,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1057.263,1067.254,How do you explain Indiana continuing to use a form that had been specifically held improper by the Seventh Circuit even if the Seventh Circuit was wrong?
1988.88-317,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,1067.254,1069.356,I have no firsthand knowledge of how Indiana--
1988.88-317,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1069.356,1070.856,Because apparently it's a printed form they used.
1988.88-317,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,1070.856,1072.975,--It makes no sense.
1988.88-317,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1076.594,1077.044,Yes.
1988.88-317,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,1077.044,1079.129,Or to seek further review.
1988.88-317,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1086.901,1088.034,"Well, they couldn't seek further review."
1988.88-317,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,1095.105,1096.59,"Well, it was a Seventh Circuit decision."
1988.88-317,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1096.59,1099.292,It was a Seventh Circuit decision but Indiana couldn't have sought further review.
1988.88-317,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,1099.292,1100.542,That's true.
1988.88-317,2,21717,david_michael_wallman,,1100.542,1104.077,"Well, of course, the Supreme Court of Indiana isn't bound by the Seventh Circuit."
1988.88-317,3,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,1107.363,1112.85,"And, in fact, the Indiana Supreme Court has taken the view that warnings such as this are... do comply with Miranda."
1988.88-317,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1119.104,1120.506,A pretty good reason.
1988.88-317,3,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,1120.506,1128.109,"Finally, one final point with respect to the compliance or whether Prysock calls for a different result."
1988.88-317,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1177.475,1178.661,"Thank you, Mr. Lazerwitz."
1988.88-317,4,26918,howard_b_eisenberg,,1180.194,1183.696,"Mr. Chief Justice, your Honors, and may it please the Court:"
1988.88-317,4,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1223.356,1228.76,"Well, now, it seems to me that the warning he was given said,"
1988.88-317,4,26918,howard_b_eisenberg,,1234.831,1235.314,Yes.
1988.88-317,4,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1235.314,1236.781,That's pretty clear.
1988.88-317,4,26918,howard_b_eisenberg,,1236.781,1239.883,Not when the entire admonition is read.
1988.88-317,4,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1239.883,1241.818,"The second sentence says,"
1988.88-317,4,26918,howard_b_eisenberg,,1251.673,1255.861,It is factually correct; it is Constitutionally deficient.
1988.88-317,4,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1255.861,1265.183,"Well, didn't Miranda itself in the opinion say there is no requirement the state have a station-house lawyer present to advise people?"
1988.88-317,4,26918,howard_b_eisenberg,,1265.183,1268.152,We don't advocate a station-house attorney Justice O'Connor.
1988.88-317,4,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1280.527,1286.347,"But as I read this warning, it is in all respects accurate."
1988.88-317,4,26918,howard_b_eisenberg,,1286.347,1287.564,It's factually accurate in that--
1988.88-317,4,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1287.564,1292.334,And it meets with the requirements we laid down in the Miranda decision.
1988.88-317,4,26918,howard_b_eisenberg,,1292.334,1293.702,--I respectfully disagree.
1988.88-317,4,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1298.988,1302.123,But that comes up only when there is an interrogation.
1988.88-317,4,26918,howard_b_eisenberg,,1311.914,1312.248,That's right.
1988.88-317,4,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1326.091,1328.96,But that isn't what the Seventh Circuit said.
1988.88-317,4,26918,howard_b_eisenberg,,1331.209,1331.56,Yes.
1988.88-317,4,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1343.719,1352.039,"So, a defendant in custody can vindicate his Miranda warnings by saying,"
1988.88-317,4,26918,howard_b_eisenberg,,1356.31,1358.479,"--That's right, Mr. Chief Justice, he can."
1988.88-317,4,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1361.514,1364.114,"So, he should say, ""I won't answer questions""."
1988.88-317,4,26918,howard_b_eisenberg,,1365.849,1366.283,"Well, yes."
1988.88-317,4,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1368.251,1369.818,That's all Miranda requires.
1988.88-317,4,26918,howard_b_eisenberg,,1369.818,1376.623,"--Miranda, respectfully, Mr. Chief Justice, requires that there be an ability to provide counsel or there will be no interrogation."
1988.88-317,4,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1376.623,1378.84,Where does it say that?
1988.88-317,4,26918,howard_b_eisenberg,,1378.84,1379.975,"Your Honor, the court said there--"
1988.88-317,4,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1379.975,1381.342,Where?
1988.88-317,4,26918,howard_b_eisenberg,,1381.342,1391.783,"--At page 475, this Court cited the language in Connolly v. Cochran, saying there must be an offer of counsel at the interrogation, and a valid waiver."
1988.88-317,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1392.3,1393.25,If there is an interrogation--
1988.88-317,4,26918,howard_b_eisenberg,,1393.25,1393.985,--If there is an interrogation.
1988.88-317,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1393.985,1396.168,--an offer of counsel at the interrogation.
1988.88-317,4,26918,howard_b_eisenberg,,1403.008,1403.841,I think that's right.
1988.88-317,4,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1405.876,1407.326,That's all Miranda requires.
1988.88-317,4,26918,howard_b_eisenberg,,1407.326,1408.126,"--Well, I--"
1988.88-317,4,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1408.126,1414.731,"Under the view you're propounding, you would require reversal even if the standard Miranda warning were given."
1988.88-317,4,26918,howard_b_eisenberg,,1414.731,1415.965,"--No, Justice Kennedy, that's not my--"
1988.88-317,4,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1415.965,1426.456,You're opening statement to us was that interrogation may not proceed unless there exists a mechanism for giving a lawyer if requested.
1988.88-317,4,26918,howard_b_eisenberg,,1426.456,1426.989,--That's right.
1988.88-317,4,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1427.356,1433.027,"And if that mechanism doesn't exist in Indiana, then even the standard Miranda warning won't suffice."
1988.88-317,4,26918,howard_b_eisenberg,,1433.027,1438.947,--Miranda represents a balancing between the interests of the prosecution and the interests of the defendant.
1988.88-317,4,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1450.755,1464.629,"Suppose we assume there is no ability to produce an attorney for all interrogations and for this one in Indiana if requested, and suppose further a standard Miranda warning is given, what result?"
1988.88-317,4,26918,howard_b_eisenberg,,1464.629,1472.068,The confession is admissible because you have to look at what was told to the suspect.
1988.88-317,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1485.126,1501.187,"The Miranda argument, wasn't the rule set down with the FBI's warning which says that when the man asks for a lawyer all questioning must stop?"
1988.88-317,4,26918,howard_b_eisenberg,,1501.187,1501.854,That's correct.
1988.88-317,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1502.304,1503.456,And that was before the Court?
1988.88-317,4,26918,howard_b_eisenberg,,1503.456,1504.089,Yes.
1988.88-317,4,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1518.383,1519.916,"Well, it wasn't a holding in Miranda."
1988.88-317,4,26918,howard_b_eisenberg,,1523.335,1525.87,"Well, I suppose that's true to some extent."
1988.88-317,4,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1568.399,1581.123,"Well, this Court in Oregon v. Elstead said that... and other cases too... said that a defect in Miranda warnings does not in and of itself constitute a violation of the Constitution."
1988.88-317,4,26918,howard_b_eisenberg,,1581.123,1582.156,That's correct.
1988.88-317,4,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1582.156,1584.541,And we're here on federal habeas.
1988.88-317,4,26918,howard_b_eisenberg,,1584.541,1585.777,That's right.
1988.88-317,4,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1585.777,1593.181,I'm wondering why we should even consider a claim like this on federal habeas.
1988.88-317,4,26918,howard_b_eisenberg,,1602.52,1618.331,"Because his constitutional right to self-incrimination was violated under the rationale of Miranda, which says that unless the suspect is informed of his right to counsel at the time of the interrogation and waives that, the Fifth Amendment is violated."
1988.88-317,4,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1618.331,1624.318,"--Well, as I said, we've held in Oregon against Elstad that it's not a Fifth Amendment violation."
1988.88-317,4,26918,howard_b_eisenberg,,1624.318,1634.857,"Well, I read Oregon and Elstad, Justice O'Connor, to mean that deviation from the traditional Miranda warnings do not constitute a Constitutional violation."
1988.88-317,4,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1640.927,1648.265,"Well, the Seventh Circuit went off on the ground that this was some kind of deviation from the Miranda warning."
1988.88-317,4,26918,howard_b_eisenberg,,1648.265,1648.665,--Well--
1988.88-317,4,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1648.665,1650.367,That's exactly what they went off on.
1988.88-317,4,26918,howard_b_eisenberg,,1655.853,1658.472,--Because it is more than just a deviation of words.
1988.88-317,4,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1675.396,1677.381,"Well, the warning goes on."
1988.88-317,4,26918,howard_b_eisenberg,,1697.744,1709.552,"Well, Justice O'Connor, I think that the reasonable understanding of those words were that this man had no ability to obtain counsel before or during the interrogation."
1988.88-317,4,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1773.428,1778.463,"Well, what's that got to do with the merits of the case now it's in this Court?"
1988.88-317,4,26918,howard_b_eisenberg,,1778.463,1780.815,"Well, I think it does have some relevance here."
1988.88-317,4,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1785.802,1790.706,And the Supreme Court of Indiana could at any time say the Seventh Circuit's decision was wrong.
1988.88-317,4,26918,howard_b_eisenberg,,1790.706,1791.723,"And, indeed, they have."
1988.88-317,4,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1791.723,1795.508,People would get out on habeas because the Seventh Circuit has--
1988.88-317,4,26918,howard_b_eisenberg,,1795.508,1795.775,That's right.
1988.88-317,4,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1795.775,1803.847,"--but I don't see why it's such an affront, as you seem to say, that they should not have followed Seventh Circuit in this issue if they felt it was wrong."
1988.88-317,4,26918,howard_b_eisenberg,,1803.847,1810.085,My submission is that they have to provide counsel in the way that Miranda requires.
1988.88-317,4,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1855.43,1858.448,"Well, there were differences of opinion in the courts, were there not?"
1988.88-317,4,26918,howard_b_eisenberg,,1858.448,1859.767,--There certainly were.
1988.88-317,4,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1869.289,1871.091,"Because they think it's all right, I suppose."
1988.88-317,4,26918,howard_b_eisenberg,,1871.091,1873.443,They why did they give a different instruction the next day?
1988.88-317,4,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1873.443,1874.143,I don't know.
1988.88-317,4,26918,howard_b_eisenberg,,1874.143,1874.927,"Well, the record suggests--"
1988.88-317,4,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1954.579,1961.566,"Suppose in this case the standard Miranda warning were given and the suspect then says,"
1988.88-317,4,26918,howard_b_eisenberg,,1976.509,1977.844,That's a closer case.
1988.88-317,4,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1984.098,1987.9,There is no... they are just describing reality.
1988.88-317,4,26918,howard_b_eisenberg,,1987.9,1988.4,Well--
1988.88-317,4,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1988.4,1989.8,That's all they're doing.
1988.88-317,4,26918,howard_b_eisenberg,,1989.8,1994.554,"--an accurate description of an unconstitutional procedure doesn't make it proper, Justice Kennedy."
1988.88-317,4,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1994.554,1996.687,It's not an unconstitutional procedure if he waives.
1988.88-317,4,26918,howard_b_eisenberg,,1998.272,1999.356,If you--
1988.88-317,4,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1999.356,2006.462,"You see, you're asking us in effect to hold something unconstitutional when it's factually accurate."
1988.88-317,4,26918,howard_b_eisenberg,,2009.146,2015.883,--You can waive counsel but only after knowingly being informed of what your rights are.
1988.88-317,4,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2224.887,2226.287,"Thank you, Mr. Eisenberg."
1988.88-317,5,21717,david_michael_wallman,,2231.391,2232.024,"Thank you, your Honor."
1988.88-317,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2294.9,2311.576,"Of course, even if you're right that this is defensible under Miranda, it's also true that you might avoid some litigation by changing the Miranda warning a little bit."
1988.88-317,5,21717,david_michael_wallman,,2311.576,2313.695,"Well, your Honor... that's correct, Justice White."
1988.88-317,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2314.695,2319.366,Unless you think... Unless you think there's really some advantages to this formulation.
1988.88-317,5,21717,david_michael_wallman,,2319.366,2324.218,"--Well, we think it is, as a practical matter, the kind of question that arises on a fairly regular basis."
1988.88-317,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2376.016,2382.404,What do they do in this jurisdiction... when they give them this particular Miranda warning?
1988.88-317,5,21717,david_michael_wallman,,2389.426,2390.076,"Well, in essence they--"
1988.88-317,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2390.076,2391.06,"Do they say, ""Do you understand""?"
1988.88-317,5,21717,david_michael_wallman,,2397.514,2406.202,"--Well, the full Miranda itself... and we're only discussing a part of it... appears on page 133 of the Joint Appendix, and it does indeed make those statements."
1988.88-317,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2411.673,2412.189,--But then what?
1988.88-317,5,21717,david_michael_wallman,,2414.841,2420.195,"--Well, then if the individual wishes to make a statement or the interview continues, then the questions and answers are recorded."
1988.88-317,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2420.195,2421.145,How do you know?
1988.88-317,5,21717,david_michael_wallman,,2423.247,2424.699,Yes.
1988.88-317,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2425.066,2427.385,"He never says, ""I waive"", or anything like that?"
1988.88-317,5,21717,david_michael_wallman,,2428.551,2429.851,"--Well, this Miranda--"
1988.88-317,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2429.851,2430.837,"--""Do you have any questions""?"
1988.88-317,5,21717,david_michael_wallman,,2442.66,2446.029,--It indicates that he's read these and he waives his right--
1988.88-317,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2446.029,2447.129,Okay.
1988.88-317,5,21717,david_michael_wallman,,2447.129,2449.131,--to counsel.
1988.88-317,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2449.131,2450.531,"Well, it certainly doesn't mean that."
1988.88-317,5,21717,david_michael_wallman,,2453.016,2454.368,To counsel at the time of the interview.
1988.88-317,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2454.368,2456.835,--He's waiving his right to counsel ate the time of the interview?
1988.88-317,5,21717,david_michael_wallman,,2456.835,2461.022,Yes.
1988.88-317,5,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2461.022,2471.83,"Well, now, in this case I take it Mr. Eagan signed, as part of the Miranda warning that was first given--"
1988.88-317,5,21717,david_michael_wallman,,2471.83,2472.347,--Yes?
1988.88-317,5,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2472.347,2473.147,--a waiver--
1988.88-317,5,21717,david_michael_wallman,,2473.147,2473.63,Yes.
1988.88-317,5,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2473.63,2474.314,"--in which he says,"
1988.88-317,5,21717,david_michael_wallman,,2486.773,2490.875,That's correct.
1988.88-317,5,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2490.875,2492.327,"So, he said affirmatively,"
1988.88-317,5,21717,david_michael_wallman,,2496.529,2496.945,That's correct.
1988.88-317,5,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2496.945,2497.462,--questioning?
1988.88-317,5,21717,david_michael_wallman,,2497.462,2499.481,"On page 133 of the Joint Appendix,"
1988.88-317,5,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2507.753,2508.087,"In that,"
1988.88-317,5,21717,david_michael_wallman,,2511.889,2518.376,At the suppression hearing and during testimony I believe the testimony from the officers were that he did... both were done.
1988.88-317,5,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2518.376,2520.061,He had done both?
1988.88-317,5,21717,david_michael_wallman,,2520.061,2520.495,Yes.
1988.88-317,5,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2521.929,2525.048,"And when they read it to him, did they read the waiver language too?"
1988.88-317,5,21717,david_michael_wallman,,2525.048,2530.868,I believe the testimony in the suppression hearing and at trial was to the effect he read the entire document.
1988.88-317,5,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2530.868,2532.368,He read it himself?
1988.88-317,5,21717,david_michael_wallman,,2532.368,2532.902,I believe so.
1988.88-317,5,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2583.085,2584.001,"Thank you, Mr. Wallman."
