1979.78-1248,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,83.049,"We will hear arguments next in 78-1248, GTE Sylvania v. Consumers Union."
1979.78-1248,0,27964,harry_l_shniderman,,88.219,92.945,"Mr. Chief Justice, and if the Court please."
1979.78-1248,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,245.011,272.879,"Mr. Shniderman, since so much of this case seems to depend on procedural history and so forth, was the theory of your case in Delaware solely a reverse FOIA case or was it partly a Chrysler-type case that there was some protection given to providers that couldn't be furnished regardless of whether an agency wanted to or not?"
1979.78-1248,0,27964,harry_l_shniderman,,272.879,280.618,"Well, it was really a -- I guess in view of Chrysler, it is clear that a reverse FOIA case is really --"
1979.78-1248,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,280.618,281.371,There is no such thing --
1979.78-1248,0,27964,harry_l_shniderman,,281.371,282.372,-- there is no such thing.
1979.78-1248,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,594.454,606.851,"We would have to say, I suppose, that the requesters had a right to intervene in the Delaware action and to appeal the injunction against disclosure?"
1979.78-1248,0,27964,harry_l_shniderman,,606.851,611.691,I would suppose they would have had such a right and they still may have such a right.
1979.78-1248,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,618.883,622.25,I mean if we were to lay down a general legal --
1979.78-1248,0,27964,harry_l_shniderman,,622.25,623.097,Of course.
1979.78-1248,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,722.545,724.346,By virtue of --
1979.78-1248,0,27964,harry_l_shniderman,,724.346,734.73,"By virtue of temporary restraining order in the Delaware court, by virtue of a temporary injunction and by virtue of a permanent injunction, all in another court."
1979.78-1248,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,736.452,753.776,"Just to be sure, you have told us that the respondents could have intervened at any time in taking part or sought to intervene at any time and then if allowed take part in that proceeding and have a direct attack on the injunction --"
1979.78-1248,0,27964,harry_l_shniderman,,753.776,753.856,Yes.
1979.78-1248,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,753.856,755.966,-- by way of court review.
1979.78-1248,0,27964,harry_l_shniderman,,755.966,759.172,"And, Mr. Chief Justice, it is very common in the reverse situation."
1979.78-1248,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,808.719,825.744,"Well, under your position, you would almost have to take the opposite position if they had first filed an action under the Freedom of Information Act before your clients had filed an action for an injunction against disclosure, wouldn't you, if you rely on comity?"
1979.78-1248,0,27964,harry_l_shniderman,,825.744,830.189,I would suppose that would be true and I would suppose we would have intervened.
1979.78-1248,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,851.501,867.138,"The agencies have set up internal procedures whereby they notify in advance, don't they, at least that was true in Chrysler, that the Secretary of Defense notify Chrysler ten days in advance that he is going to release them in case Chrysler wanted to do anything about it?"
1979.78-1248,0,27964,harry_l_shniderman,,867.138,877.018,"Yes, of course, and because a party who is going to get what he asked for really has no cause of action and that comes to a second point as to whether there is a case of controversy."
1979.78-1248,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1079.059,1083.762,Thank you.
1979.78-1248,1,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1084.754,1090.657,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court --"
1979.78-1248,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1090.657,1105.587,"Mr. Geller, did the Court of Appeals reject the argument that the District Court suit in the District of Columbia should be dismissed because there just isn't any wrongful withholding?"
1979.78-1248,1,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1105.587,1111.576,"The interesting thing about the D.C. Circuit's decision, Mr. Justice White, is they never addressed that question."
1979.78-1248,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1111.576,1112.939,"It was presented though, wasn't it?"
1979.78-1248,1,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1112.939,1113.817,It was.
1979.78-1248,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1113.817,1115.809,But I don't see anything in the opinion about it.
1979.78-1248,1,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1115.809,1117.741,That is an interesting point.
1979.78-1248,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1117.741,1121.147,"Mr. Geller, is that true as to both of the opinions of the D.C. Circuit?"
1979.78-1248,1,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1121.147,1121.735,"Yes, I believe it is."
1979.78-1248,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1121.735,1122.865,"It was presented both times, I mean?"
1979.78-1248,1,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1122.865,1123.999,"Yes, I believe so."
1979.78-1248,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1243.712,1247.225,"Mr. Geller, do you think there are going to be any more reverse FOIA actions?"
1979.78-1248,1,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1247.225,1249.303,"Well, we use the phrase --"
1979.78-1248,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1249.303,1252.537,"After Chrysler, which said there were no such thing --"
1979.78-1248,1,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1252.537,1258.435,"I understand that the FOIA itself doesn't give any rights to submitters, but we use the phrase reverse FOIA action here --"
1979.78-1248,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1258.435,1259.633,Just as a shorthand --
1979.78-1248,1,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1259.633,1262.145,"Yes, just as a shorthand, as Mr. Shniderman --"
1979.78-1248,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1262.145,1264.17,Let's call them Chrysler actions.
1979.78-1248,1,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1264.17,1268.09,"I would be happy to call them Chrysler actions, if that would please the Court."
1979.78-1248,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1268.09,1270.941,"Except that may be gone pretty soon, too."
1979.78-1248,1,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1270.941,1276.567,Perhaps I will continue to call them reverse FOIA actions.
1979.78-1248,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1276.567,1289.224,What you mean is action based on some statute which forbids an agency to whom information has been furnished by a private person from disclosing it to someone else.
1979.78-1248,1,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1289.224,1301.262,"That's right, and here there are allegations that the Trade Secrets Act and section 6(b)(1) of the Consumer Product Safety Act prohibited the agency from disclosing the television accident reports."
1979.78-1248,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1401.184,1402.61,That is a pretty general ground.
1979.78-1248,1,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1407.667,1409.117,We did not.
1979.78-1248,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1412.117,1413.508,But you didn't file --
1979.78-1248,1,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1413.508,1417.307,"No, but it was not because we did not believe that the D.C. Circuit's decision was wrong."
1979.78-1248,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1419.477,1424.335,You do concede that there are eleven Courts of Appeals in the country?
1979.78-1248,1,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1424.335,1429.026,I do concede that there are eleven.
1979.78-1248,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1429.026,1431.492,Soon to be fifteen.
1979.78-1248,1,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1431.492,1438.774,But we think in the FOIA area there is a strong analogy to be drawn to cases involving in rem or quasi-in rem jurisdiction.
1979.78-1248,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1532.873,1539.627,"It was on the competitive theory, competition is good for the judiciary as it is for business?"
1979.78-1248,1,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1539.627,1544.287,"That was the reason that they did not offer, but they offered several others which we think are equally meritless."
1979.78-1248,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1769.974,1773.462,"You can't really enter a plea information, can you?"
1979.78-1248,1,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1773.462,1791.658,"Well, it has been suggested, but there is certainly no case that the, I mean the requesters and Judge Robinson in the D.C. Circuit, in an effort to explain what they meant by ""creative approach,"" listed every conceivable procedural remedy that might exist in this area, but there are no cases that ever applied it and we don't think it would be workable."
1979.78-1248,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1791.658,1807.959,"Is the government's position that the court in the -- the court handling the second suit, the later suit, should hold its hand from the very outset, or do you say that comity picks up when there has been a judgment in one court or the other?"
1979.78-1248,1,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1807.959,1814.241,"Well, we think that the first, the second court in this case, the D.C. Circuit, District Court, could have stayed its action."
1979.78-1248,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1814.241,1816.942,I know it could have stayed its action.
1979.78-1248,1,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1819.95,1820.174,Yes.
1979.78-1248,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1820.174,1824.455,Or would it have then erred to go ahead until there has been a judgment?
1979.78-1248,1,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1824.455,1825.864,"Yes, it would have been error."
1979.78-1248,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1825.864,1844.232,"It would have been error to go ahead, even though predictably -- let's assume the District of Columbia District Court thought that the docket in this court is much freer, much more -- much quicker than the court in Delaware."
1979.78-1248,1,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1846.807,1847.318,I don't think so.
1979.78-1248,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1862.451,1874.751,"I know, but the threshold issue, the threshold issue on the -- I suppose is whether a permanent injunction ought to issue."
1979.78-1248,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1874.751,1885.319,"Well, but under Walker v. Birmingham, it is not being improperly withheld, even though the injunction is erroneous, because the remedy is to appeal the injunction."
1979.78-1248,1,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1885.319,1886.832,"Precisely, and that's what the commission did here."
1979.78-1248,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1894.249,1902.533,"So you feel you must interpose that, the injunction, to answer my question?"
1979.78-1248,1,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1906.239,1913.006,"Assuming that no temporary restraining order had been entered in the Delaware case in this Court, then we wouldn't have our first argument, which is the improperly withheld --"
1979.78-1248,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1913.006,1915.768,Until one court or the other had come to judgment?
1979.78-1248,1,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1915.768,1928.264,"No, we think that the principles of comity would apply here, even if the first court did not come to judgment, because I think, for the reason I gave, the analogy to the in rem or quasi-in rem unless you apply a bright line test --"
1979.78-1248,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1928.264,1930.934,"I guess we don't need to settle that, because there is a judgment."
1979.78-1248,1,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1930.934,1931.387,Absolutely.
1979.78-1248,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1935.12,1946.283,"Mr. Geller, I don't see how that case could arise, because if there is no injunction, presumably if Mr. Shniderman's argument is correct, anyway, you would have simply turned the documents over, notwithstanding the pendency of the Delaware action."
1979.78-1248,1,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1946.283,1954.829,"Well, we said that we would have turned -- as I recall, we said in late March or early April, 1975, that we were planning to turn the documents over on May first."
1979.78-1248,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1954.829,1958.852,"And if there had been no injunction before May first, should we not assume that you would have done what you said you were going to do?"
1979.78-1248,1,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1958.852,1959.662,"Yes, but --"
1979.78-1248,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1959.662,1961.46,So this hypothetical couldn't arise?
1979.78-1248,1,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1961.46,1973.161,"Well, it could arise in the situation where on April 10th the submitters ran into the Delaware District Court and asked for a temporary restraining order, which I think it's unlikely, you're right, the Delaware District Court might have refused."
1979.78-1248,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1976.765,1985.386,"But Mr. Justice White's question was, assuming just the pending case and no order, and my understanding of the government's position on all along has been, if there were no order, we would have turned the documents over."
1979.78-1248,1,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1985.386,1986.882,"Well, that's absolutely right; that's right."
1979.78-1248,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1986.882,1989.581,"You would have been obliged to turn it over, would you not?"
1979.78-1248,1,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1989.581,1994.778,"Well, the commission has taken the position that it's not exempt, and we would have turned it over; that's correct."
1979.78-1248,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1994.778,1998.009,"Mr. Geller, do you think there's a case in controversy here?"
1979.78-1248,1,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1998.009,1998.852,"Yes, we do."
1979.78-1248,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2009.085,2012.188,By virtue of the joinder under Rule 19?
1979.78-1248,1,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,2012.188,2013.067,No.
1979.78-1248,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2026.823,2031.283,So the District of Columbia -- so the Court of Appeals should have done what?
1979.78-1248,1,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,2031.283,2041.986,The D.C. Court of Appeals we think should have reversed on the ground that the documents were not being improperly withheld and that the requesters had not stated a cause of action under the FOIA.
1979.78-1248,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2041.986,2042.886,The Court of Appeals --
1979.78-1248,1,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,2042.886,2045.807,"Excuse me, that's right, Judge Ritchey had, although on a different --"
1979.78-1248,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2045.807,2049.581,So you think the Court of Appeals is correct in deciding the case on the merits but simply that it decided the wrong way --
1979.78-1248,1,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,2049.581,2049.831,"Yes, that's right."
1979.78-1248,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2051.179,2055.5,"Well, would it have been all right for them to just say we are going to wait?"
1979.78-1248,1,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,2055.5,2056.733,"Well, I don't think that --"
1979.78-1248,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2056.733,2057.436,What about comity?
1979.78-1248,1,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,2060.246,2062.292,The bottom line is that we think that the --
1979.78-1248,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2062.292,2064.322,It isn't to dismiss.
1979.78-1248,1,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,2064.322,2065.096,"Well, it could be --"
1979.78-1248,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2065.096,2068.183,It is to wait to see if the other case really stands up.
1979.78-1248,1,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,2068.183,2069.75,"That's right, that is a possibility."
1979.78-1248,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2070.627,2071.146,Possibility?
1979.78-1248,1,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,2072.587,2083.71,"Well, we don't think there is any practical difference between Judge Ritchey's having said I am going to stay my order, because if a permanent injunction was issued in Delaware and never overturned that stay would have been an indefinite duration."
1979.78-1248,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2083.71,2085.844,"I agree with you, but what if it was over-turned?"
1979.78-1248,1,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,2085.844,2090.172,If it was overturned then it is conceivable that these requesters could have just asked for the documents at that point.
1979.78-1248,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2091.319,2098.417,"If you reverse -- if you affirm the District Court, it is a dismissal."
1979.78-1248,1,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,2098.417,2099.149,That's right.
1979.78-1248,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2099.149,2102.694,"Well, that isn't the bottom line on the comity case."
1979.78-1248,1,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,2103.158,2110.449,"No, I think that the cases in this Court have said that under rules of comity a case can be dismissed, it need not be stayed."
1979.78-1248,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2118.628,2120.554,Very well.
1979.78-1248,2,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2122.88,2126.587,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1979.78-1248,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2208.738,2213.411,"Isn't that usually a reason for venuing a case, though, counsel?"
1979.78-1248,2,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2213.411,2214.77,"Absolutely, Your Honor."
1979.78-1248,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2352.737,2357.743,"Mr. Morrison, I trust before you are through you will explain your views about the improperly withheld argument?"
1979.78-1248,2,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2357.743,2359.603,"Why don't I do that now, Mr. Justice Stevens."
1979.78-1248,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2366.099,2367.659,But made.
1979.78-1248,2,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2367.659,2368.716,Barely.
1979.78-1248,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2369.196,2370.253,"Well, made."
1979.78-1248,2,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2374.32,2379.253,"Mr. Justice White, I am saying that it was barely made because I can't say to you now that it wasn't made."
1979.78-1248,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2383.743,2384.096,You are not saying --
1979.78-1248,2,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2384.096,2386.714,The issue is here and I am prepared answer it on the merits.
1979.78-1248,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2392.717,2397.309,Was there a petition for rehearing for this last --
1979.78-1248,2,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2397.309,2398.885,"No, there was not, Your Honor."
1979.78-1248,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2400.125,2400.51,Yes.
1979.78-1248,2,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2400.51,2402.872,-- but not the second time.
1979.78-1248,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2402.872,2405.256,"Where was it barely raised, this time or the time before?"
1979.78-1248,2,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2406.591,2407.859,I think only the time before.
1979.78-1248,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2413.464,2415.402,"Well, that is what this argument is about, isn't it?"
1979.78-1248,2,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2415.402,2416.328,"Yes, Your Honor."
1979.78-1248,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2416.328,2420.254,"That is what this whole point is, the existence of an injunction."
1979.78-1248,2,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2420.254,2421.124,That's right.
1979.78-1248,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2422.073,2427.916,"If they had disobeyed that injunction, what could have been the consequence?"
1979.78-1248,2,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2427.916,2428.708,"I'm sorry, Your Honor?"
1979.78-1248,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2428.708,2432.157,"If they had disobeyed that injunction, what could have been the consequences?"
1979.78-1248,2,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2432.157,2435.453,We have never suggested the Product Safety Commission disobey that injunction.
1979.78-1248,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2435.453,2437.436,"No, no, no."
1979.78-1248,2,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2437.436,2441.858,We believe that they should not disobey the injunction under Walker v. Birmingham.
1979.78-1248,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2444.398,2450.82,What I understood you to suggest is that the agency should disobey that injunction.
1979.78-1248,2,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2450.82,2452.243,"No, Your Honor, I did not suggest that."
1979.78-1248,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2475.226,2479.86,Is there a case from this Court ever holding to that effect?
1979.78-1248,2,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2479.86,2481.197,"No, Your Honor."
1979.78-1248,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2496.189,2498.743,"Mr. Morrison, don't forget to answer my question about improper withholding."
1979.78-1248,2,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2498.743,2499.437,I'm trying.
1979.78-1248,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2499.437,2501.803,"I know you're trying, but it is really terribly important."
1979.78-1248,2,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2501.803,2503.296,"I know it is, Your Honor, and --"
1979.78-1248,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2503.296,2508.534,"Regardless of how it got here or the equities or all the rest of it, we really have to address that."
1979.78-1248,2,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2508.534,2514.135,"There is now a final injunction, affirmed on appeal, petition for certiorari pending."
1979.78-1248,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2548.763,2551.826,"Well, I didn't realize this was a jurisdictional argument."
1979.78-1248,2,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2554.663,2556.009,Well --
1979.78-1248,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2556.009,2562.24,"The court adjudicates your case that you file and say you lose, there isn't any improper withholding."
1979.78-1248,2,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2562.24,2575.253,"But as soon as the temporary -- but the argument is made that as soon as the temporary restraining order is entered, there can no longer -- the basis of withholding is no longer that there is a statutory right to withhold but that there is a temporary restraining order."
1979.78-1248,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2579.314,2583.007,"Well what about the argument, that is what I am trying to figure out."
1979.78-1248,2,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2583.007,2583.087,Now --
1979.78-1248,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2583.087,2587.198,"At any time during this case, could they, were they wrongfully withholding documents?"
1979.78-1248,2,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2587.198,2588.855,There are two things that are wrong with that argument.
1979.78-1248,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2592.892,2593.492,But you didn't.
1979.78-1248,2,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2593.492,2603.687,"-- and filed a case and they had gotten a temporary restraining order some place else in another case without us being a party, at that point our case would have to be dismissed under this argument."
1979.78-1248,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2622.54,2634.02,"So if the agency says I'm withholding the documents because I have been ordered to or I will be held in contempt if I don't, they nevertheless are wrongfully withholding?"
1979.78-1248,2,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2634.02,2635.671,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1979.78-1248,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2636.55,2638.866,What is your second reason?
1979.78-1248,2,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2638.866,2672.249,"I thought, Your Honor, the first that it was simply not a way of dealing with it, that it might be the case if we had a situation in which the manufacturers had gone in and requested and brought an action, had gotten a temporary restraining order, gotten preliminary injunction, a permanent injunction in the District Court affirmed on appeal, two years later we came in, at that point we might have a case in which not that we would be precluded from proceeding at all but that we might have to go back to the original forum."
1979.78-1248,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2672.249,2690.657,"Well, you are saying that FOIA is so broad and Congress didn't intend to strip a court of its equitable powers, and yet I understood a moment ago that you agreed that under Walker v. Birmingham the only way to challenge an injunction was to appeal it, not to disobey it."
1979.78-1248,2,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2695.529,2696.96,"No, Your Honor that is not what I meant."
1979.78-1248,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2718.837,2721.874,And disagreeing with the other forum?
1979.78-1248,2,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2721.874,2724.745,"Well, Your Honor, I think that we would have to -- the case would have to be transferred."
1979.78-1248,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2739.908,2746.017,"Mr. Morrison, you say relitigate, didn't you, just now?"
1979.78-1248,2,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2746.017,2748.26,"If I said it, I didn't mean it in that sense."
1979.78-1248,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2748.26,2751.277,"Well, was that Freudian moving in on you?"
1979.78-1248,2,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2751.277,2751.944,I don't know.
1979.78-1248,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2752.772,2753.76,"Well, that is what you are trying to do."
1979.78-1248,2,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2754.83,2756.512,We are trying out first chance to litigate.
1979.78-1248,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2757.896,2765.698,"What would happen to the Third Circuit case that is on appeal here, on cert here?"
1979.78-1248,2,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2767.937,2770.15,We believe that we should have been joined as --
1979.78-1248,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2770.15,2772.628,What would happen to that case?
1979.78-1248,2,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2776.307,2779.24,"No, Your Honor, they could not."
1979.78-1248,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2779.24,2783.702,"There are no procedures for transferring a case from one Court of Appeals to another, is there?"
1979.78-1248,2,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2783.702,2785.365,"At that point, no."
1979.78-1248,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2786.349,2791.936,"That is the point where we are now, is there is a Court of Appeals judgment and cert is pending here."
1979.78-1248,2,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2791.936,2804.015,"If this Courg rants certiorari, in our view, and decides the case, if it affirms the decision below we would not be legally bound by the outcome because we were not parties to the Delaware proceeding."
1979.78-1248,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2808.527,2817.524,"How about as far as the fact that the agency would not be violating FOIA because it is not wrongfully withholding, the injunction has been affirmed?"
1979.78-1248,2,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2817.524,2827.271,"I would say at that point, Your Honor, if we had brought a lawsuit after this Court affirmed the decision, I might have to go to Delaware to open the proceeding there and both sides of --"
1979.78-1248,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2827.271,2829.667,Meanwhile the agency would not be wrongfully withholding.
1979.78-1248,2,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2829.667,2845.216,"I could presumably, if I had to join the agency up in Delaware, if their argument is right that it is pursuant only to a court order, it is the court order at that point that would preclude me from proceeding on the merits and I don't see how it is wrongfully withholding now I could ever relitigate."
1979.78-1248,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2858.438,2859.351,"No, Mr. Morrison."
1979.78-1248,2,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2863.315,2867.727,They consented to it in most cases and everybody has agreed that it is virtually automatic.
1979.78-1248,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2877.312,2879.752,That isn't true without a permanent injunction.
1979.78-1248,2,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2881.046,2895.231,"No, we were tossed out and the argument on improper withholding was made at both temporary restraining and the preliminary injunction stage, and that is when we lost our case in the District of Columbia, the District Court initially, because we were told we could not proceed."
1979.78-1248,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2921.467,2925.616,"Well, why didn't you do that on this case if you have it all settled?"
1979.78-1248,2,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2926.507,2931.479,Because I don't think that is a sensible way for this Court or other courts to resolve these controversy --
1979.78-1248,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2931.479,2945.392,"Well, what if the District Court in which you apply your new tactics if you lose this case says the agency says it is going to give you the records, you say you want them, what are you arguing about?"
1979.78-1248,2,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2946.706,2953.783,But we will get in there before they decide because most of them don't make it in the 10 or 20 days that the statute specifically authorizes --
1979.78-1248,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2953.783,2955.694,What about the ones which do?
1979.78-1248,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2955.694,2961.165,Do you take a position that a wrongful withholding occurs when an agency says we need time to evaluate your request?
1979.78-1248,2,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2961.165,2961.604,"Yes, Your Honor."
1979.78-1248,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2962.928,2966.385,It is wrongful withholding unless they send you the documents by return mail?
1979.78-1248,2,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2966.385,2969.682,"No, within 10 days plus the extension."
1979.78-1248,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2990.263,2993.619,What if those statutory time frames have not passed?
1979.78-1248,2,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2993.619,2995.884,"Your, Honor, there are not going to be very many of those cases."
1979.78-1248,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2995.884,2998.75,But what about the few of them that there are?
1979.78-1248,2,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2998.75,3033.931,"At that point, Your Honor, I think what would happen is -- what we urge is that the government is in the middle of all of these cases, it is the responsibility of the government who claims to be a stakeholder here and has no other interest besides doing that, to say we've got to try to do what we can, either join the parties under Rule 19, which we say they should have done here when we are known requesters, not a hypothetical 200 million but known requesters who have been asking for these documents, or move to transfer under 1404(a) which incidentally the government finally got around to doing after the first decision in the D.C. Circuit."
1979.78-1248,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3068.915,3076.523,Why prefer the forum in which the government agency is located to the forum in which either the submitter or the requesters are located?
1979.78-1248,2,16500,alan_b_morrison,,3076.523,3079.308,"I'm not suggesting that you have to do that, Mr. Justice Rehnquist."
1979.78-1248,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3116.882,3121.205,Why don't you bring in Hawaii while you are at it?
1979.78-1248,2,16500,alan_b_morrison,,3121.205,3122.619,"Well, we can do that, Your Honor."
1979.78-1248,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3122.619,3128.731,"Then you are going to create a whole new branch of law, depending on case by case situations as to whether --"
1979.78-1248,2,16500,alan_b_morrison,,3128.731,3135.357,"Just as we resolve other issues where there are two parties filing lawsuits in just the patent area, it happens all the time."
1979.78-1248,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3211.563,3216.571,"Could the reverse be true, Mr. Morrison, you could have multiple requesters all over the country and not be able to consolidate them all?"
1979.78-1248,2,16500,alan_b_morrison,,3216.571,3224.911,"Well, I believe we would, Hour Honor, and that is because there is a special venue provision under the FOIA that permits an action to be brought in the District of Columbia."
1979.78-1248,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3266.192,3277.438,"Mr. Morrison, it may be that the TRO is automatic, but you don't suggest that District judges around the United States, when the government argues there is no legal basis for the submitters to get an injunction, that they automatically enter injunctions right and left, do you?"
1979.78-1248,2,16500,alan_b_morrison,,3277.438,3278.425,"No, I don't, Your Honor."
1979.78-1248,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3278.425,3280.726,They must at least be a legal basis for the claim.
1979.78-1248,2,16500,alan_b_morrison,,3280.726,3281.558,I agree.
1979.78-1248,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3281.558,3287.428,"Shouldn't we presume that all judges are equally competent to weigh the merits of these claims, all Federal District judges?"
1979.78-1248,2,16500,alan_b_morrison,,3287.428,3294.563,"That is correct, Your Honor, but we do have a problem of forum shopping and that is what it is, and the question is what are we going to do about it."
1979.78-1248,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3297.884,3307.348,"But really if there is a colorable legal basis, it persuades the district judge that the documents should not be released, they shouldn't be pell-mell released just to protect the forum of the other side?"
1979.78-1248,2,16500,alan_b_morrison,,3307.348,3309.718,I agree.
1979.78-1248,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3309.718,3313.454,"Congress could stop the forum shopping, couldn't it?"
1979.78-1248,2,16500,alan_b_morrison,,3313.454,3314.513,"That is, of course, true."
1979.78-1248,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3318.47,3321.62,"So your answer is yes, but you would rather have us do it?"
1979.78-1248,2,16500,alan_b_morrison,,3321.62,3323.104,"No, I am here in court now, Your Honor --"
1979.78-1248,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3323.104,3325.284,Because you don't have to go all the way up to Delaware.
1979.78-1248,2,16500,alan_b_morrison,,3326.246,3328.798,"Or California, as other cases have been involved."
1979.78-1248,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3328.798,3330.906,"Well, California isn't involved in this."
1979.78-1248,2,16500,alan_b_morrison,,3333.839,3338.222,"And they object to taking a trip to the District of Columbia, with all due respect, Your Honor, because they don't want to be here and we don't want to be up there."
1979.78-1248,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3338.222,3349.385,Neither of you like Amtrak.
1979.78-1248,2,16500,alan_b_morrison,,3349.385,3356.468,"Your Honor, this race to the courthouse theory which has been put forth is going to produce unnecessary and premature litigation."
1979.78-1248,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3416.327,3424.386,"Do you have anything further, Mr. Shniderman?"
1979.78-1248,3,27964,harry_l_shniderman,,3424.386,3437.216,"Your Honors, first of all, in response to some questions from the Justice, I do want to point out the improperly withheld point was fully briefed in the court below."
1979.78-1248,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3443.189,3445.09,Both times or the first time or the second time?
1979.78-1248,3,27964,harry_l_shniderman,,3445.09,3458.808,"It was briefed more sketchily the first time because we were placing greater emphasis on the case of controversy, but it was there by both the government incidentally and by us."
1979.78-1248,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3458.808,3460.202,But more fully the second time?
1979.78-1248,3,27964,harry_l_shniderman,,3460.202,3462.48,"Yes, more fully the second time."
1979.78-1248,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3533.148,3534.875,So you say there still isn't one?
1979.78-1248,3,27964,harry_l_shniderman,,3534.875,3540.607,"There still isn't one, and that is one of the reasons why we are in this bind here, wasting this Court's time --"
1979.78-1248,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3540.607,3550.316,So you say that is a threshold issue that you urge and that we must decide at the doorstep because that question is always open?
1979.78-1248,3,27964,harry_l_shniderman,,3550.316,3552.869,"No, Mr. Justice, you need not decide it."
1979.78-1248,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3555.605,3560.265,"Well, we can't decide anything else if we decide there is not a case of controversy."
1979.78-1248,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3560.265,3563.227,So don't we have to decide that before we can reach anything else?
1979.78-1248,3,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3564.956,3566.338,Because that is jurisdictional --
1979.78-1248,3,27964,harry_l_shniderman,,3566.338,3568.768,"Of course, that is quite acceptable to us."
1979.78-1248,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3568.768,3571.152,"Well, I mean isn't that inevitable --"
1979.78-1248,3,27964,harry_l_shniderman,,3571.152,3572.713,I think it's good practice and --
1979.78-1248,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3572.713,3573.761,You've raised it --
1979.78-1248,3,27964,harry_l_shniderman,,3573.761,3580.795,"Although this Court and other courts upon occasion do avoid the jurisdictional issue, there are, for example --"
1979.78-1248,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3580.795,3583.71,We assume we have jurisdiction and therefore we decide the merits?
1979.78-1248,3,27964,harry_l_shniderman,,3583.71,3595.341,"Well, this case is now in the United States Supreme Court and it is still undecided in the District Court whether Warwick, one of the twelve manufacturers, was properly served with process."
1979.78-1248,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3601.368,3602.72,"Thank you, counsel."
